'''''Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings''''' is a [[real-time strategy]] [[video game]] developed by [[Ensemble Studios]] and published by [[Microsoft]]. Released in 1999 for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Classic Mac OS|Macintosh]], it is the second game in the ''[[Age of Empires]]'' series. An expansion, ''[[Age of Empires II: The Conquerors|The Conquerors]]'', was released in 2000.

''The Age of Kings'' is set in the [[Middle Ages]] and contains thirteen playable civilizations. Players aim to gather resources, which they use to build towns, create armies, and defeat their enemies. There are five historically based campaigns, which constrict the player to specialized and story-backed conditions. There are three additional [[Single-player video game|single-player]] game modes, and [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] is supported. Despite using the same [[game engine]] and similar [[Source code|code]] to its predecessor, development of ''The Age of Kings'' took a year longer than expected, forcing Ensemble Studios to release ''[[Age of Empires: The Rise of Rome]]'' in 1998 instead. The design team focused on resolving significant issues in ''Age of Empires'', but noted on release that some problems remained.

Reception of ''The Age of Kings'' was highly positive. The significant number of new features was praised, as were the gameplay improvements. Some reviewers, however, were critical of the presentation of units—they were seen as bland and uninteresting—while others considered ''The Age of Kings'' to be too similar to its predecessor, ''[[Age of Empires (video game)|Age of Empires]]''. Three months after its release, two million copies of ''The Age of Kings'' had been shipped, and it topped sales charts in seven countries. The game won multiple awards and is today considered a classic of its type, having had a significant impact on future games in its genre. Both the original ''Age of Empires II'' and the expansion pack were later released as ''The Gold Edition''.

In April 2013, ''Age of Empires II: HD Edition'' was released on the [[Steam (software)|Steam]] [[digital distribution]] platform for Windows operating systems. The ''HD Edition'' includes both the original game and the expansion ''The Conquerors'', as well as updated graphics for high-resolution displays. It also supports user-generated content through the [[Steam Workshop]] and multiplayer games provided through the Steam servers. Three expansions have been released for the ''HD Edition'': ''[[Age of Empires II: The Forgotten|The Forgotten]]'' in 2013, ''The African Kingdoms'' in 2015, and ''Rise of the Rajas'' in 2016.

==Gameplay==
''The Age of Kings'' focuses on building towns, gathering resources, creating armies and ultimately conquering opponents by destroying their units and buildings. Players conquer rival towns and empires as they advance one of 13 civilizations through four "Ages": the [[Dark Age]], the [[Feudalism|Feudal Age]], the Castle Age (being the [[High Middle Ages]]), and the Imperial Age, reminiscent of the [[Renaissance]]—a 1000-year timeframe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-date=January 3, 2013 |url=http://www.firingsquad.com/games/aoe2diary/ |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130103073907/http://www.firingsquad.com/games/aoe2diary/ |title=Age of Empires 2: Designer Diary |publisher=FiringSquad |first=Bob |last=Colayco |date=October 16, 1999 |accessdate=December 17, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Advancing to a new Age unlocks new units, structures, and technologies, but players must first build certain buildings from their current age and then pay a sum of resources (typically food and gold).&lt;ref name=manual31&gt;''Game Reference – Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings'', Microsoft Corporation, p.31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilian units, called "villagers", are used to gather resources; they are either male or female—gender does not affect their abilities. Resources can be used to train units, construct buildings, and research technologies, among other things; for example, players can research better armour for [[infantry]] units. The game offers four types of resources: food, wood, gold, and stone. Food is obtained by hunting animals, gathering berries, harvesting livestock, farming, and shore fishing and fishing from boats. Wood is gathered by chopping down trees. Gold is obtained from either gold mines, trade or collecting relics in a [[monastery]], and stone is collected from stone mines. Villagers require checkpoints, typically depository buildings (town center, mining camp, [[Mill (grinding)|mill]], and [[lumber yard]]), where they can store gathered resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamespot.com/gamespot/guides/aoe2_gg/p4_02.html |title=Overview of Resources |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|first=Elliott |last=Chin |accessdate=September 18, 2008 |archivedate=March 10, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310031400/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/guides/aoe2_gg/p4_02.html |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each civilization can purchase upgrades that increase the rate of gathering these resources. Players can construct a [[marketplace]] for trade; players can trade wood, stone, and food for gold, and use gold to buy other resources. Market prices fluctuate with every transaction.&lt;ref name=preview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/05/14/age-of-empires-ii-the-age-of-kings-2 |title=Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings Preview |publisher=IGN |first1=Jason |last1=Bates |first2=Steve |last2=Butts |date=May 14, 1999 |accessdate=July 4, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820081458/http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/05/14/age-of-empires-ii-the-age-of-kings-2 |archivedate=August 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, markets and docks can also generate gold by using trading carts or cogs which are used to visit foreign markets and ports; once they return to the player's market/dock, gold is added to the stockpile. The amount of gold a trade unit earns on each trip is related to the distance it had to travel to a foreign market; more gold is earned on longer trips. It is possible to trade with enemies' markets or docks, but the player's trading units may be attacked or destroyed by enemy units in the process. Players do not need to keep trading manually, as once they select the port or market the trading units infinitely continue to trade.

There are five campaigns in ''The Age of Kings'', containing historically based scenarios such as [[Genghis Khan]]'s invasion of [[Eurasia]], [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Barbarossa]]'s [[Crusade]], or [[Saladin]]'s defence of the [[Holy Land]]. In the [[Joan of Arc]] and [[William Wallace]] campaigns, the player can control a unit based on its namesake; in others, players take orders from guiding spirits representative of the army's commander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamespot.com/gamespot/guides/aoe2_gg/p6_01.html |title=Campaign Walk-throughs |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|first=Elliott |last=Chin |accessdate=September 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205163050/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/guides/aoe2_gg/p6_01.html |archivedate=December 5, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional game modes are available to the player in ''The Age of Kings''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamespot.com/gamespot/guides/aoe2_gg/p4_01.html |title=The First Age, and How to Get Started |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|first=Elliott |last=Chin |accessdate=September 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704045233/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/guides/aoe2_gg/p4_01.html |archivedate=July 4, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; One mode, [[random map]], generates a map from one of several randomly chosen map generating scripts, with players starting in the Dark Age with a Town Center, three villagers (or more depending on civilization), and a scout unit. The game can be won through military conquest, by constructing a special building known as a Wonder and keeping it standing for a certain amount of time, or by obtaining control of all relics on the map for a set amount of time. [[Deathmatch]] mode allows players to begin with large amounts of resources, creating a focus on military dominance, while in the [[regicide]] mode each player is given a king unit, winning by killing all of the other monarchs.

===Units and civilizations===
[[File:Age ii feudal age celts.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Celts|Celtic]] civilization in the [[Feudalism|Feudal Age]]. The Town Center is visible and has several farms surrounding it; villagers of both sexes work there and elsewhere to gather resources. A scout on horseback is also at the ready. Military buildings such as the [[barracks]], archery range, and [[stable]] are visible, as well as economic buildings—the market, [[blacksmith]] and mill. The right-bottom corner of the screenshot shows the player's walls and a gate.]]

Every player has a limit to the number of units they can create—a population limit—but may not immediately use the entire potential population.&lt;ref name=preview/&gt; The population capacity, which can be capped at anywhere between 75&lt;ref name="manual28"&gt;Game Reference – Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, Microsoft Corporation, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt; and 200 in intervals of 25,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Matt |last=Wadleigh |url=http://www.thunderboltgames.com/reviews/article/age-of-empires-2-the-age-of-kings-review-for-pc.html |title=Age of Empires 2: The Age of Kings |publisher=ThunderboltGames.com |date=June 17, 2003 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209155946/http://thunderboltgames.com/reviews/article/age-of-empires-2-the-age-of-kings-review-for-pc.html |archivedate=February 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is based on the number of houses, Castles, or Town Centers—the main building in a player's town—which have been built. ''The Age of Kings'' introduced two significant new features for unit management: the idle villager button, which helps players identify villagers that have not been assigned a task, and the town bell, which sends all a player's villagers into their Town Center, Castle, or tower for safety;&lt;ref name="GamePro"/&gt; units garrisoned within these three buildings, especially archers, increase the building's firepower (towers fire more arrows with units garrisoned inside) including the town center, which cannot fire anything at all without someone garrisoned there.

''The Age of Kings'' also includes five types of military units: infantry, [[archers]], [[cavalry]], [[siege]] weaponry, and [[navy|naval]] units. Certain types of infantry, archers, and cavalry are "counter units" with special defenses against other types of units. The three human classes of military generally follow a [[rock-paper-scissors]] model. For example, infantry are generally powerful against buildings but weak against cavalry, thus the infantry counter units—[[spear]]men and [[pikemen]]—have attack bonuses against cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamespot.com/gamespot/guides/aoe2_gg/p3_02.html |title=Infantry |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|first=Elliott |last=Chin |accessdate=September 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525180027/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/guides/aoe2_gg/p3_02.html |archivedate=May 25, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each Civilization in ''The Age of Kings'' has one or two special units that are exclusive to that Civilization. For instance, the [[British people|Britons]] have access to [[longbow]]men, an archery unit with increased range. These Civilization-specific units are generally more powerful, but still follow the basic rock-paper-scissors model. The [[monk]] is a special kind of military unit that has the ability to convert enemy units to the player's civilization, and to heal allied units. Monks are also used to collect relics. Relics accumulate gold once held in the player's monastery—the more relics are captured, the faster the gold is accumulated. Collecting all relics on the map is one method by which a player can win a random map game, depending on the victory setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Elliott |last=Chin |accessdate=October 3, 2008 |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|url=http://gamespot.com/gamespot/guides/aoe2_gg/p3_18.html |title=Monks |archivedate=October 7, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007175909/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/guides/aoe2_gg/p3_18.html |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a player has all the relics in their monasteries, a timer is shown to all players. If an opposing player does not destroy a monastery holding a relic after the set time, then that player wins.

Players choose to play as one of 13 civilizations split into four architectural styles—[[Western Europe]]an, [[Eastern Europe]]an, [[Middle East]]ern, and [[East Asian]]—that determine building appearance in-game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planetageofempires.gamespy.com/View.php?view=GameInfo.Detail&amp;id=79&amp;game=4 |title=Age of Kings – Buildings |website=PlanetAgeofEmpires |publisher=[[GameSpy]] |archivedate=September 20, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920050959/http://planetageofempires.gamespy.com/View.php?view=GameInfo.Detail&amp;id=79&amp;game=4 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The civilizations have varying strengths and weaknesses with regards to economics, technology, and battle, and each has access to one or more different, very powerful "Unique Units".&lt;ref name="GameSpotRev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamespot.com/pc/strategy/ageofempires2theaok/review.html |title=Age of Empires: The Age of Kings for PC review |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |first=Greg |last=Kasavin |authorlink=Greg Kasavin |date=October 12, 1999 |accessdate=September 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210211023/http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/ageofempires2theaok/review.html |archivedate=December 10, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamespot.com/gamespot/guides/aoe2_gg/p3_11.html |title=Unique Units |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |first=Elliott |last=Chin |accessdate=September 18, 2008 |archivedate=December 12, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212012749/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/guides/aoe2_gg/p3_11.html |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, each civilization provides an individual team bonus in team games.&lt;ref name=manual14&gt;Game Reference – Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, Microsoft Corporation, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; To add variety, each civilization has a set of [[sound bite]]s in its native language that are uttered by units when selected or instructed to perform a task.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt;

===Buildings===
The buildings in ''The Age of Kings'' are split into the economic&lt;ref name=manual48&gt;Game Reference – Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, Microsoft Corporation, p.48.&lt;/ref&gt; and military buildings categories.&lt;ref name="manual54" /&gt; Buildings can research technologies and upgrades that increase economic, military or unit-based efficiency, as well as provide resources for the player.&lt;ref name=manual48/&gt;

The most important economic building is the Town Center, where villagers are created, all types of resources can be stored, some technologies are researched, and the player can advance to the next Age. The Town Center can fire arrows at enemy units within range if villagers or archers are garrisoned while under attack.&lt;ref name=guide1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guidesarchive.ign.com/guides/11531/pg1.html |title=Age of Empires 2: Age of Kings Prima FastTrack Guide |publisher=IGN |accessdate=September 28, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202004043/http://guidesarchive.ign.com/guides/11531/pg1.html |archivedate=December 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other economic buildings available include storage buildings for resources, farms, docks (the dock may also produce several military ships), and houses to support a higher population.&lt;ref name=manual4853&gt;Game Reference – Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, Microsoft Corporation, pp.&amp;nbsp;48–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Military buildings include unit-producing buildings such as barracks, archery ranges, stables, and castles, as well as defensive buildings such as walls and towers.&lt;ref name=manual5458&gt;Game Reference – Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, Microsoft Corporation, pp.&amp;nbsp;54–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Military buildings can perform research to improve the abilities of military units, increasing their strength, defensive capabilities, or other attributes.&lt;ref name=manual54&gt;Game Reference – Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, Microsoft Corporation, p.54.&lt;/ref&gt; Castles are a key offensive and defensive building as they can build [[trebuchet]]s, train the civilization's "unique unit/s", and fire a hail of arrows at enemy units within range, with garrisoned units firing extra arrows.&lt;ref name=manual55&gt;Game Reference – Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, Microsoft Corporation, p.55.&lt;/ref&gt; Castles can only be built after a player has reached the Castle Age, although in some game options, players begin with an already-built castle as early as the Dark Age.&lt;ref name=manual13&gt;Game Reference – Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, Microsoft Corporation, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

After advancing to the Imperial Age, players can also construct a Wonder, an extremely expensive non-military building. On many gameplay modes, building a Wonder triggers a victory countdown—unless it's destroyed within a certain timeframe, the building player wins. Every civilization's Wonder is in the shape of a landmark unique to that historical culture—the [[Temple of Heaven]] for the Chinese, for example, or [[Notre Dame (Paris)|Notre Dame]] for the Franks.

===Single player campaigns===
"The Age of Kings" originally shipped with five extensive campaigns: William Wallace ([[Celts]]), Joan of Arc ([[Franks]]), Saladin ([[Saracens]]), Genghis Khan ([[Mongols]]) and Barbarossa ([[Teutons]]). The campaigns are sorted numerically to distinguish difficulty—The William Wallace Campaign being the easiest, and Barbarossa being the most challenging.

'''William Wallace'''

The Campaign of William Wallace acts as a tutorial campaign, much like the original ''[[Age of Empires]]'' game, and emphasises on how to move units, collect and gather resources, obtain and store holy relics and defeat the enemy, which in this Campaign is presented as the [[England|English]] during the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], commanded by the evil, torturous but skilled commander [[Edward Longshanks]].

'''Joan of Arc'''

Joan of Arc puts the player in command of the battered, bloodied and demoralised [[France|French]] during the [[Hundred Years War]] against England. At the beginning of the campaign, nearly every major and decisive battle fought by the French has always led to defeat to the English. In France's darkest hour though, a seventeen-year-old girl—[[Joan of Arc]] intends to save France by the command of [[God]]. She intends to drive the English from France forever. Her presence at the [[Siege of Orleans]] earns her the nickname 'The Maid of Orleans', and she earns the confidence of the uncrowned [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] by being given command of the entire French Army, although the Dauphin's advisors begin to plot against Joan of Arc. At several turning points in the Hundred Years' War, namely the [[Loire Campaign]] where the entire English and [[Burgundy|Burgundian]] forces were cleared out, hope for a free France begin to inspire more men to join the fight under Joan of Arc.

However, the crowned Charles VII's advisors convince the King not to send the promised reinforcements to Joan at the pivotal [[Siege of Paris (1429)|Siege of Paris]]. Joan of Arc retreats to the Castle at [[Siege of Compiègne|Compiègne]] where the English and Burgundian troops lay siege. Trapped outside the safety of the [[Castle]], Joan is captured by the Burgundians, trailed by the [[England|English]] as a [[heretic]], and burned at the stake. The final campaign mission, the [[Battle of Castillon]], has one of Joan's most trusted Lieutenants muster a huge force of vengeful French troops, and utterly destroy the English and Burgundian forces around and in Castillon, ending the Hundred Years' War and expelling the English from France, spare [[Calais]].

'''Saladin'''

This campaign takes places years after the events that led to the [[First Crusade]] and capture of [[Jerusalem]]. Saladin (who the player acts as throughout this campaign) is first tasked with establishing himself in [[Egypt]] and removing the [[Crusades|Crusaders]] there, in order to become [[Sultan]] of [[Egypt]]. A villainous Crusader by the name of [[Reynald de Chatillon]] has continuously violated the fragile peace between the Crusaders and the Saracens, causing great concern to Saladin. Raids by Crusaders in the [[Red Sea]] are eventually suppressed by the Saracens. At the [[Battle of Hattin]], the Saracens win a decisive victory over the combined strength of the [[Knights Templar]], [[Knights Hospitallers]], [[Jerusalem]] and the [[English people|English]] Crusaders, capture Reynold de Chatillon (who is the only prisoner executed by Saladin personally) and obtain a piece of the [[True Cross]] as an important relic.

With the strength of the Crusaders now heavily reduced since Hattin, Saladin launches the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|Siege of Jerusalem]] to free it from Crusader control. However, the Saracens must take great care not to destroy the Monasteries within the holy city, and must also deal with Templar and Hospitaller encampments that flank the city. The Siege is successful, the [[Holy Land]] now once again in Saracen control, spare the Crusader states of [[Tiberias]], [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]], but are subsequently captured by Saladin. When the [[Pope]] is informed of the Crusader defeat in the [[Middle East]], the [[Third Crusade]] is launched, threatening to undo Saladin's conquest. The final mission tasks the player with defending a heavily fortified [[Citadel]] from constant Crusader attacks, most notably King [[Richard I of England|Richard of England]], as well as constructing the [[Great Mosque of Samarra]], the unique Wonder building available to the Saracens in game.

'''Genghis Khan'''

The [[Genghis Khan]] concentrates on the rise of the divided, constantly warring tribes of [[Mongolia]] into the mighty, fearsome [[Mongol Empire]]. Early missions of the campaign concentrate on uniting the several steppe tribes whilst also dealing with the '[[Qara Khitai|Kara-Khitai]]', sworn enemies of Genghis Khan. With the other tribes either united or destroyed, Genghis now sets his eyes on world domination. The vast riches of the Khwaremia domain in [[Persia]] would be the obvious choice, but despite a pledge of support to the Mongols, the technologically superior [[China|Chinese]] Kingdoms have refused, thereby setting another example where [[Mongol conquest of China|Genghis directs his next campaign]]. With the entirety of China now under Mongolian rule, the Mongol horde now has the [[trebuchet|technology]] capable of knocking down the fortifications of Persia, and beyond.

The following conquests of [[Khwarezmia]] and the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Russian Principalities]], the latter by [[Subutai]] leaves [[Europe]] as the last continent yet to be conquered. However, Genghis Khan who is now 80 years old, dies before the conquest can be complete. His son, Ogatai, promises to continue the war, marking [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Poland]] as the first target. The Mongols, using numerical superiority alone, are able to defeat the mounted Knights of Poland, [[Bohemia]] as well as the several German Duchies that rally to Poland's support. The final mission of the Genghis Khan campaign focuses on [[Pax Mongolica]], the term used to describe the height of power enjoyed by the Mongolian Empire. The last major power in Eastern Europe, [[Hungary]], is all that stands in the way of Mongolia's further incursions into Europe.

'''Barbarossa'''

This campaign focuses on the expansion of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] by integrating the squabbling German duchies under the rule of [[Frederick Barbarossa]], the first Holy Roman Emperor. The first campaign missions sees the player establishing Barbarossa's dominance over the [[Central Europe]]an powers of [[Austria]], [[Saxony]], [[Bavaria]], Bohemia, and Burgundy, as well as [[Swabia]] by collecting relics. Although having established dominance, Barbarossa still finds rivals to challenge his Empire's power in the form of [[Poland]], as well as [[Henry the Lion]], a respected ally of Barbarossa. Henry is spared his life and titles as long as he promises to fully declare allegiance to Barbarossa.

With Central Europe now under the Empire's dominance, Barbarossa turns his attention to [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Italy]], namely [[Milan]] and the [[Papal States|Pope]]. The rise of the Holy Roman Empire has challenged the power of the Pope in Europe, hence why Barbarossa must be able to [[Lombard League|subjugate the Italian realms who plot against him.]] Once again, Henry the Lion betrays Barbarossa, only this time he is stripped of his titles and forced into [[exile]] whilst Barbarossa is able to ascertain his superiority in Italy. The [[Third Crusade]] begins in the Middle East, and Barbarossa pledges his Empire's support to the coming campaign. But the Holy Roman Empire's army is far too strong for any navy to carry, forcing Barbarossa to march his troops through hostile [[Constantinople]] and [[Anatolia]], which is crawling with [[Seljuk Turks]]. During this march, Barbarossa drowns by the weight of his armour in a river current, leaving his army to continue to the [[Dome of the Rock]] in Jerusalem with their dead Emperor to fulfill his wishes.

===Multiplayer===
''The Age of Kings'' supports [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] over the [[Internet]], or via a [[local area network]] (LAN). Up to eight players can take part in one game, with all of the single player game modes available. The [[MSN Gaming Zone]] supported the game until the service closed on June 19, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zone.msn.com/en/general/article/aoferetiring.htm |title=Age of Empires matchmaking on MSN Games has been retired&amp;nbsp;– thank you so much for playing! |publisher=[[MSN Games]] |date=June 19, 2009 |accessdate=September 17, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513130056/http://zone.msn.com/en/general/article/aoferetiring.htm |archivedate=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/E81lrpGzeEx7SPrmeUYNQK/An-underground-community-is-bringing-Age-of-Empires-II-back.html|title=An underground community is bringing Age of Empires II back to life|publisher=HT Media Ltd|date=June 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, various multiplayer gaming services such as [[GameRanger]] support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Age of Empires II: HD Edition Review 10:36|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOVWu8P-Woo&amp;t=10m36s|publisher=YouTube.com|date=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since April 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/news/a464169/age-of-empires-2-hd-edition-coming-to-steam|title='Age of Empires 2: HD Edition' coming to Steam|publisher=Digital Spy|date=March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steam (software)|Steam]] supports in-game multiplayer for [[High-definition video#HD in video gaming|HD]] resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/shout/overclock/age-empires-2-evergreen-not-forgotten-1340374 |title=Age of Empires 2: Evergreen, not Forgotten|publisher=The Daily Star|date=January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.redbull.com/in-en/age-of-empires-indian-micro-community |title=Welcome to India's best kept Age of Empires secret|publisher=Red Bull|date=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; requiring an internet connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Age of Empires II: HD Edition Review 9:31|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOVWu8P-Woo&amp;t=9m31s|publisher=YouTube.com|date=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Prior to the completion of ''[[Age of Empires (video game)|Age of Empires]]'', [[Ensemble Studios]] had signed a contract with [[Microsoft]] for a sequel. The design team chose to set ''The Age of Kings'' in the [[Middle Ages]] as a logical progression from the [[ancient era]] setting of ''Age of Empires''. The design team was conscious of attempting to capture the broad appeal of the first game without making the game's design too similar. Nonetheless, they attempted to appeal to the vast demographic who played ''Age of Empires''.&lt;ref name="Gama1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20000307/pritchard_01.htm |title=Postmortem: Ensemble Studios' Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings&amp;nbsp;— Catching Up |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |first=Matt |last=Pritchard |date=March 7, 2000 |accessdate=September 20, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922183620/http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20000307/pritchard_01.htm |archivedate=September 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Age of Kings''{{'}}s design team intended to complete the game within a year by using [[source code|code]] from the original and reusing the [[Genie (game engine)|Genie]] [[game engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/gdcarchive/2000/terrano.doc|title=The Art of Empires|format=[[.doc]]|website=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=September 22, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922103001/http://www.gamasutra.com/features/gdcarchive/2000/terrano.doc|archivedate=September 22, 2008|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several months into the process they found they would not be able to complete a game of the quality they sought in that time. Ensemble Studios informed Microsoft they would need another year and instead created ''[[Age of Empires: The Rise of Rome]]'', an easily developed expansion pack of ''Age of Empires'', as a compromise which could be released for Christmas 1998.&lt;ref name="Gama1"/&gt; To help meet the next year's deadline, additional [[programmer]]s, artists, and designers were employed.&lt;ref name="Gama2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20000307/pritchard_02.htm |title=Postmortem: Ensemble Studios' Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings&amp;nbsp;— What Went Right |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |first=Matt |last=Pritchard |date=March 7, 2000 |accessdate=September 20, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624171958/http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20000307/pritchard_02.htm |archivedate=June 24, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;!----&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; To overcome another significant objection to ''Age of Empires''—that of path finding—the team completely redesigned the [[game engine]]'s movement system.&lt;ref name="Gama2"/&gt;

The original ''Age of Empires'' had been criticized for its [[artificial intelligence]] (AI). Because the original AI did not "[[Game artificial intelligence#Cheating AI|cheat]]" by attributing itself extra resources or using other techniques the human player could not, it was easier to defeat than in many other real-time strategy games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/games/empires/behind_dave.htm|title=Dave Pottinger|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=September 20, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429220619/http://www.microsoft.com/games/empires/behind_dave.htm|archivedate=April 29, 2008|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''The Age of Kings'', Ensemble Studios attempted to develop a more powerful AI system that did not compromise by cheating. Industry veteran Mario Grimani led Ensemble Studios in the creation of the new system. ''The Age of Kings'' saw the introduction of a [[event-driven programming|triggers]] system for its scenario editor. The triggers allow messages to be displayed, or actions to take place, based on pre-set criteria or "events".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/08/27/age-of-empires-ii-the-barbarossa-campaign |title=Age of Empires II: The Barbarossa Campaign |author=Greg Street |date=August 27, 1999 |website=IGN |accessdate=July 6, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160718221017/http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/08/27/age-of-empires-ii-the-barbarossa-campaign |archivedate=July 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scenario editor was also improved by the new AI system. The AI and trigger systems interacted regularly in the single player campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/09/10/age-of-empires-ii-the-genghis-khan-campaign |title=Age of Empires II: The Genghis Khan Campaign |author=Greg Street |date=September 10, 1999 |website=IGN |accessdate=July 6, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809033729/http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/09/10/age-of-empires-ii-the-genghis-khan-campaign |archivedate=August 9, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team was less successful in resolving other issues; programmer Matt Pritchard complained following the release of ''Age of Empires'' that there was still no process by which [[patch (gaming)|patches]] could be issued. Extensive [[cheating in video games|cheating]] in multiplayer games of ''Age of Empires'' came as a result of several bugs in the game, which resulted in Microsoft promising Ensemble Studios there would be a patch process for ''The Age of Kings''. On release, there were several bugs that needed immediate attention, but the patch process was not yet ready. The first patch was released 11 months later.&lt;ref name="Gama3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20000307/pritchard_03.htm |title=Postmortem: Ensemble Studios' Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings&amp;nbsp;— What Went Wrong |website=[[Gamasutra]] |first=Matt |last=Pritchard |date=March 7, 2000 |accessdate=September 21, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922194858/http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20000307/pritchard_03.htm |archivedate=September 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MSDls"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/games/age2/downloads.htm |title=Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings Downloads |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |accessdate=September 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007064333/http://www.microsoft.com/Games/Age2/downloads.htm |archivedate=October 7, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ensemble Studios developed a new [[terrain rendering|terrain system]] for ''The Age of Kings'', with [[3D graphics|3D]] presentation capabilities that were vastly superior to those of ''Age of Empires''. Pritchard noted an improvement in the team's artistic abilities following their work on the past two games, and he is noted as saying that "''AoK'' became a showcase for their improved talent".&lt;ref name="Gama2"/&gt; However, he complained about the lack of an art asset management tool, while other departments gained new tools and automated procedures to assist in design and [[play test]]ing.&lt;ref name="Gama2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gama3"/&gt;

The [[soundtrack]] for ''The Age of Kings'' was directed by [[Stephen Rippy]], who has since taken that role for [[Age of Empires#Music|all games in the ''Age of Empires'' series]]. Music for the game was split into two categories. For "in game" music, Rippy's team took musical elements from a variety of cultures and combined them to create a mixed sound. "Pre-game" music was designed to be unique to the civilization in question. Campaigns based on historical figures would include "a theme that will at least be rooted in [the character's] culture".&lt;ref name="FSM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/daily/article.cfm?articleID=3268 |first=Peter |last=Suciu |date=May 1, 2001 |title=Soundtracks on CD-ROM: Stirring Music That Accompanies the Interactive |magazine=[[Film Score Monthly]] |accessdate=September 29, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330080808/http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/daily/article.cfm?articleID=3268 |archivedate=March 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[demo (gaming)|demo]] of ''The Age of Kings'' was released on October 16, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/games/age-of-empires-ii/pc-709972 |title=Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings (demo edition) |publisher=IGN |accessdate=July 6, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160626193932/http://www.ign.com/games/age-of-empires-ii/pc-709972 |archivedate=June 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured the learning campaign, a sample of a random map game, and the ability to play via the MSN Gaming Zone.&lt;ref name="MSDls" /&gt; Much to Ensemble Studios' disappointment, numerous incomplete versions of the game were leaked. These were picked up by [[warez]] sites, and sold illegally throughout the [[Pacific Rim]]; warez versions of the game were even sold outside Microsoft's offices in [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name="Gama3"/&gt;

===High-definition remake===
In 2012, [[Hidden Path Entertainment]] began working on a high-definition [[Video game remake|remake]] of ''Age of Empires II'', an effort spearheaded by Matt Pritchard, an original Ensemble lead programmer. On March 7, 2013, its release was announced, branded as ''Age of Empires II: HD Edition''. It has improved graphics, widescreen support and new multiplayer options through [[Steam (software)|Steam]]. It was released on April 9, 2013, and there was a pre-order available on April 5.&lt;ref name=hdedition&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-03-07-age-of-empires-2-hd-edition-announced-will-rome-onto-steam-next-month |title=Age of Empires 2 HD Edition announced, will Rome onto Steam next month |last=Phillips |first=Tom |website=[[Eurogamer]] |publisher=Gamer Network |date=March 7, 2013 |accessdate=March 7, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310034310/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-03-07-age-of-empires-2-hd-edition-announced-will-rome-onto-steam-next-month |archivedate=March 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Age of Kings'' received "universal acclaim", according to video game [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt;

According to [[Eurogamer]]'s Geoff Richards, "the list of new features and improvements over the original game is over a page long".&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt; ''[[GamePro]]''{{'}}s review similarly focused on "new additions to the genre itself" which it argued made ''The Age of Kings'' outstanding. These included the idle unit button and town bell.&lt;ref name="GamePro"/&gt; [[GameSpy]]'s Carlos Salgado was appreciative of other features; he praised the ability to create individual profiles for different players and to customize [[hotkey]]s.&lt;ref name="GameSpy"/&gt; Meanwhile, [[IGN]] appreciated the new abilities given to the villager unit—the review stated villagers "now play an important role not only in the collection of resources, but also in town defense and even in combat."&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt;

[[AllGame]]'s Michael L. House enjoyed the use of sound bites in civilizations' native languages, which he said was "very influential in developing an era-enhancing atmosphere".&lt;ref name="Allgame"/&gt; Eurogamer said this feature "gives [villagers] a personality, rather than the standard 'Acknowledged' grunt of military [[real-time strategy|RTS]] games", also stating that the use of female villagers provided a good variety.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt; [[Game Revolution]]'s review explained that by being set in a more recent epoch of human history, ''The Age of Kings'' was able to "add character to an otherwise impersonal style of gameplay".&lt;ref name="GameRev"/&gt; ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' approved of ''The Age of Kings''{{'}} use of shorter, more focused campaigns, compared to its predecessor,&lt;ref name="CVG"/&gt; while Game Revolution noted that even in slower sections of the campaign, the historical narrative helped maintain player interest.&lt;ref name="GameRev"/&gt; [[GameSpot]] said that with the screen full of units, "you can begin to imagine how their historical equivalents once prospered",&lt;ref name="GameSpotRev"/&gt; while GameSpy said ''The Age of Kings'' presents "realism rarely seen in the RTS genre".&lt;ref name="GameSpy"/&gt; IGN staff argued that while the strengths and weaknesses attributed to different civilizations made the game more realistic, the fact that they were still mostly the same prevented ''The Age of Kings'' from "delivering the same battlefield impact of ''[[StarCraft]]'' or ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun|Tiberian Sun]]''".&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt;

House also praised the gameplay interface, which he said "couldn't be simpler", as well as the advanced grouping and path-finding systems.&lt;ref name="Allgame"/&gt; Nash Werner of ''GamePro'' said that the formation tools were wonderful, and complained only that they could not be assigned to naval units.&lt;ref name="GamePro"/&gt; ''Computer and Video Games'' generally agreed, stating that "the controls are very user-friendly and well explained".&lt;ref name="CVG"/&gt; GameSpot's [[Greg Kasavin]] wrote that despite the game's improved graphics, "there's nothing foreign about its appearance" and that most game features will be "immediately recognizable if you've played a real-time strategy game before".&lt;ref name="GameSpotRev"/&gt; ''[[PC Zone]]'' agreed, but in a negative sense—it argued that ''The Age of Kings'' "is essentially an update of a two-year-old game".&lt;ref name="PCZone"/&gt;

''The Age of Kings'' was highly influential on its genre.

===''HD Edition''===
''Age of Empires II: HD Edition'' received mixed reviews with aggregate review website Metacritic assigning a score of 68 out of 100 based on reviews from 20 critics.&lt;ref name=metacritic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/age-of-empires-ii-hd-edition |title=Age of Empires II: HD Edition |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=December 20, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701013305/http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/age-of-empires-ii-hd-edition |archivedate=July 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics agreed that the ''HD Edition'' changed very little from the original game. Daniel Starkey of Destructoid added that the reluctance to change the game features encourages "a much more aggressive, and obsessive style of play". He highlights the fact that many of the problems of trying to run the original game on a modern computer are gone, and calls its compatibility with [[Steam (software)#Other functions|Steam's Workshop]] "an amazing bonus".&lt;ref name=destructoid&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/review-age-of-empires-ii-hd-edition-251841.phtml |title=Review: Age of Empires II HD |publisher=Destructoid |author=Daniel Starkey |accessdate=December 20, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205014751/http://www.destructoid.com/review-age-of-empires-ii-hd-edition-251841.phtml |archivedate=December 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Dean of Eurogamer was less forgiving; although he agreed that the Workshop compatibility was a good addition and praised the players in the online community as "remarkably calm and friendly", he thought that the game should have been updated more, citing its "boring campaign" and poorly-aged gameplay mechanics: "It just doesn't play very well, and its flaws are more blatant than ever before". Underscoring his criticisms of the lack of significant changes to the game, he described it as "a mouldy time-capsule that will likely mar your memories of the original".&lt;ref name=Eurogamer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-12-age-of-empires-2-hd-review |website=[[Eurogamer]] |publisher=Gamer Network |author=Paul Dean |accessdate=December 20, 2013 |title=Age of Empires 2 HD review |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205015139/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-12-age-of-empires-2-hd-review |archivedate=December 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansions and sequels==

A [[PlayStation 2]] [[porting|port]] was released by [[Konami]] in 2001, and a [[Nintendo DS|NDS]] spinoff, ''[[Age of Empires: The Age of Kings]]'' was released in 2006.

An expansion for ''The Age of Kings'', ''[[Age of Empires II: The Conquerors|The Conquerors]]'', was released in 2000. It introduced numerous new game features, including unique technologies for each civilization, and five new civilizations. Two of these, the [[Aztec]]s and the [[Maya civilization|Mayans]], represent the [[New World]] and have new distinctive architectural style. Other new civilizations are the [[Spaniards|Spanish]], [[Huns]], and [[Koreans]].

The third historical game in the series, ''[[Age of Empires III]]'', was released in 2005. The game portrayed the [[European colonization of the Americas]]. Aside from one significant feature, the [[Age of Empires III#Home Cities|home city]], the game's design was similar to that of its predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/pc/age_of_empires_3 |title=Age of Empires III&amp;nbsp;— PC Review |publisher=[[Game Revolution]] |author=Joe Dodson |accessdate=October 3, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725140601/http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/pc/age_of_empires_3 |archivedate=July 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[multiplayer]]-only ''[[Age of Empires Online]]'' was released in 2012. While the game was freely accessible, it featured premium content which could either be earned through gameplay or purchased, enabling the player to use higher-tier equipment and new game modes. Active development of the game ended on January 1, 2014, when executive producer Kevin Perry stated that adding new content was "no longer cost effective," and announced that the game would be moving from "development phase" to its "support phase".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/age-of-empires-online-no-longer-in-active-development/1100-6402016/ |title=Age of Empires Online no longer in active development |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |author=Martin Gaston |accessdate=January 2, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101084404/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/age-of-empires-online-no-longer-in-active-development/1100-6402016/ |archivedate=January 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game servers were subsequently shut down on July 1, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/rip-age-of-empires-online/1100-6420872/ |title=RIP Age of Empires Online |website=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |author=Eddie Makuch |accessdate=January 2, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104192240/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/rip-age-of-empires-online/1100-6420872/ |archivedate=January 4, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gajah Mada'''

The campaign starts with a mission explaining the origins of the [[Majapahit|Majapahit Empire]], wherein [[Raden Wijaya]] leads the Javanese to victory against the [[Mongols]], the [[Singhasari]], and the [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]]. Gajah Mada proper then appears on the scene to rescue King [[Jayanegara]] from the city of [[Trowulan]], which is surrounded by rebels. However, Jayanegara is dissolute and is soon assassinated. His sister, [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi|Tribhuwana]], takes power and appoints Gajah Mada as her prime minister. Gajah Mada then swears his famous [[Sumpah Palapa]] oath to unify [[Nusantara]], whereupon he will not eat any food containing spices until the whole Indonesian archipelago is unified. The Majapahit empire then proceeds to expand settlements to the islands of [[Bali]], [[Sulawesi]], and [[Borneo]], and has conflicts with the [[Sunda (clan)|Sunda]], [[Dharmasraya|Dhamasraya]], and [[Temasek]]. The queen regent then abdicates to let her now-matured son, [[Hayam Wuruk]], ascend the throne, and the Majapahit Empire then expands to the east by destroying the Docks of [[Makassar]], [[Kutai]], and [[Luwu]]. The sole group which remains are the Sunda, and Gajah Mada manipulates them into a trap by arranging for a marriage between his king and a [[Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi|Sunda princess]]. Whereas the Sunda believe that the marriage will result in an alliance, Gajah Mada has written into the contract that via the marriage, the Sunda will submit to Majapahit rule, unbeknownst to Hayam Wuruk. The result is the [[Battle of Bubat|Pasunda Bubat]] Massacre, wherein all the Sunda princes are killed and Hayam Wuruk's bride commits suicide out of grief. Gajah Mada is then summoned to the king and exiled for his actions.

'''Suryavarman I'''

Suryavarman starts by launching a campaign against and killing King [[Udayadityavarman I]] in the city of [[Angkor]]. Following the successful crushing of a rebellion led by [[Jayaviravarman]], who is killed in the battle, Suryavarman sends an envoy through hostile territory to the [[Chola]], offering lavish gifts in exchange for an alliance against the [[Tambralinga]]. The Chola and Khmer then launch a [[two-pronged attack]] against the Tambralinga and the thalassocracy of [[Srivijaya]]. After defeating these two powers, Suryavarman then deals with domestic threats from the [[Dai Viet]], [[Cham people|Cham]], [[Indrapura (Champa)|Indrapura]], and [[Lavo]], which have sought to take advantage of the king's distraction with foreign conquests.

'''Bayinnaung'''

1538 AD: Bayinnaung starts out as the loyal follower of King [[Tabinshweti]]. Together, they march against the [[Hanthawaddy]] who harbor the [[Mon people|Mon]] king, [[Takayupti]], and capture the city of [[Prome]], in spite of the raids led by the [[Shan people|Shan]]. 1543 AD: At this time, Bayinnaung assists the king in the conquest of [[Ava Kingdom|Ava]] by the killing of its king, [[Hkonmaing]], and fending off opposition by the Shan and the [[Rakhine people|Rakhine]]. They must amass a sufficient sum of gold in order for Tabinshweti to be crowned in the religious city of [[Pagan]]. 1550 AD: Tabinshweti encounters a Portuguese merchant who leads him into alcoholic habits, leading to Bayinnaung acquiring increased authority as first minister. Tabinshweti is ultimately killed on orders of [[Smim Sawhtut]], and Bayinnaung must avenge his death by putting down the rebellions led by the possible pretenders, including Smim Sawhtut in his stronghold of [[Pegu]], [[Rakkate]], Thado Dhamma Yaza, and [[Smim Htaw]]. 1563 AD: Bayinnaung, now [[Cakkavati]] and King of the [[Toungoo Empire]], seeks to expand eastward by bringing relics to the neighboring kingdoms to show his devotion. He faces the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]], led by King [[Chakkraphat]], Bayinnaung's vassal [[Lan Na]], and [[Lan Xang]] along the way, in addition to various [[nat (spirit)|nats]]. 1580 AD: Bayinnaung ends the campaign by entering into a meditative state as his sons [[Nanda]] and [[Thinga Dathta]] lead the conquest of the Rakhine city of [[Mrauk U]], and lead him to the four Buddhist temples in the region.

'''Lê Lợi'''

Lê Lợi is the leader of an uprising against the [[Fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam|Ming Empire]]. The campaign starts in 1418, where Lê Lợi is leading a guerrilla band in destroying all the Ming towers in the Vietnamese villages, with the help of the [[Trịnh]] and [[Nguyễn]] families. He then defends a fort in [[Chí Linh]] with the help of [[Lê Lai]], who disguises himself as Lê Lợi and sallies forth to lead a suicidal [[frontal assault]] upon the enemy, giving his life so that Lê Lợi and his troops can escape, once they have destroyed the towers to the east. Lê Lợi then advances upon [[Hanoi]] and succeeds in capturing the city. Afterwards, he marches towards the Ming capital of [[Nghệ An]], but finds himself on the way there obliged to deal with a fortress garrisoned by [[Cam Banh]], a vassal of the Chinese. The Chinese send in their veteran general, Wang Tong, to relieve the fortress, but he is too late to stop Lê Lợi from capturing it. Lê Lợi then splits his forces into three groups: Dinh De to lead the cavalry upon [[Đông Đô]] to keep Wang Tong occupied, [[Le Trien]] to move north to intercept the Chinese reinforcements under Liu Sheng, and [[Luu Nhan Chu]] and [[Bui Bi]] to Nghệ An. Miraculously, this triple plan works, prompting the Ming to accept a peace deal. However, the local Vietnamese vassals of the Ming will not accept this, prompting a final showdown with Wang Tong. Peace is finally concluded, and [[Dai Viet]] is allowed to exist as a tributary state of the Ming.

==Gameplay==
The player begins with a ship stocked with the necessary items to start a settlement. The player is able to order it to explore until he/she finds an island that is suitable for settling and building a new colony. If the settlers are satisfied with everything they need, they will go up to the next stage. As they move through each stage, they will demand more things. In continuous play mode the player can choose up to three rivals, which will advance about the same rate as the player. As the settlers advance through each stage of settlement, the player can build warships and send to possessed island and build beachheads and then attack military buildings. If the player captures all of them, the island is theirs. The story mode is similar, but the player needs to fulfill specific tasks to proceed.

==Critical reception==
[[Metacritic]] recorded a score of 78/100 based on 14 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anno 1701: Dawn of Discovery|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ds/anno-1701-dawn-of-discovery|work=Metacritic|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; IGN gave it 7.8/10, calling it "versatile" and "lots of fun".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ANNO 1701 Review|url=http://uk.ign.com/games/1701-ad/nds-893951|work=IGN|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''anti-romance''', sometimes referred to as a [[satire]], is a type of story characterized by having an [[apathy|apathetic]] or self-doubting [[anti-hero]] cast as the [[protagonist]], who fails in the object of his journey or struggle. Most anti-romances take place in urban settings, and frequently feature insanity, depression, and the meaning of reality as major themes. An anti-romance is the [[antithesis]] of a [[romance (heroic literature)|romance]].

==Major anti-romances==
[[J. D. Salinger]]'s ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' is probably the most famous and successful anti-romance, though there are many others, including [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s ''[[The Crying of Lot 49]]'', "[[Araby (story)|Araby]]" by [[James Joyce]] and [[Joseph Heller]]'s ''[[Catch-22]]''.

The film ''[[Three Colors: Red]]'' (1994) has been considered an anti-romance.

'''''Black and Blue''''' is a musical revue celebrating the [[Black people|black]] culture of dance and music in [[Paris]] between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].

Based on an idea by Mel Howard and conceived by Hector Orezzoli and Claudio Segovia, it consists of songs by artists such as [[W. C. Handy]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Fats Waller]], [[Eubie Blake]], and [[Big Maybelle]] and skits peppered with bits of bawdy humor.

==Productions==
The revue was first presented at the Chatelet Theatre in [[Paris]] in 1985 which included [[Sandra Reaves-Phillips]]. The [[Broadway theatre|Broadway production]] opened on January 26, 1989 at the [[Minskoff Theatre]]&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Frank.[http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?_r=1&amp;res=950DE7D8153CF934A15752C0A96F948260&amp;oref=slogin "Review/Theater; Black Blues and Jazz"]''The New York Times'', January 27, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;and closed on January 20, 1991 after 829 performances and 32 previews. Directed by Orezzoli and Segovia and choreographed by [[Henry LeTang]], [[Cholly Atkins]], [[Frankie Manning]], and [[Fayard Nicholas]] the cast of forty-one singers, dancers, and musicians included [[Ruth Brown]], [[Linda Hopkins]], [[Carrie Smith]], [[Savion Glover]], [[Claude Williams (musician)|Claude Williams]], [[Roland Hanna]], [[Grady Tate]], [[Jimmy Slyde]], [[Bill Easley]], Jimmy "Preacher" Robins, Lon Chaney (the jazz tap dancer, not the actor) and [[Bunny Briggs]]. [[Dianne Walker]] was the show's curator and sustainer of the choreography and stage direction, as well as a featured dancer.

The score included "St. Louis Blues," "I Can't Give You Anything But Love," "In a Sentimental Mood," "Am I Blue?," "Stompin' at the Savoy," and the title tune.      

The [[cast album|original cast recording]] won a [[Grammy Award]].

Following the Broadway engagement, Howard took ''Black and Blue'' on two [[Europe]]an tours, performing at such venues as The Chatelet Theater in [[Paris]], The Thalia in [[Hamburg]], Theater des Westens in [[Berlin]], The Deutsches Theater in [[Munich]], and The Carre Theater in [[Amsterdam]].

A television production directed by [[Robert Altman]] aired on [[PBS]] in 1993. The ''Variety'' reviewer wrote:"'Black and Blue' never looked as good on Broadway as it does in Robert Altman's keenly observed, briskly paced small-screen version of the rhythm and blues revue. This is a slightly reduced edition of Altman's February 1991 taping at the Minskoff Theater, sold as a pay-per-view in Japan."&lt;ref&gt;Gerard, Jeremy.[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117900456.html?categoryid=32&amp;cs=1 "TV Reviews:Great Performances 'Black And Blue'"]''Variety'' (requires subscription), February 17, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Daewon Media was founded in 1973 in South Korea as 'One Production', and in 1974 the name was changed to 'Daiwon Productions'.  In 1977, Daiwon Animation Ltd was formed, and the company entered into an OEM agreement with Japan's [[Toei Animation]] to provide technical assistance work on its animation productions.

Daewon moved into the area of domestic animation production, and in 1982 released ten theater animations.  In 1985 and 1986, Daiwon signed OEM agreements with several United States animation companies, including [[Hanna-Barbera]].

In 2001, Daewon registered on the [[KOSDAQ]] stock market, and later that year, the Daewon Digital Broadcasting and Anione TV, an animation television channel, were launched, with funding from several Japanese investors.&lt;ref name="bandai1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bandai.co.jp/e/releases/images/3/2904.pdf|title=Bandai to Invest in South Korean Animation|date=2001-10-24|publisher=Bandai|accessdate=2015-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="toeicorp1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corp.toei-anim.co.jp/ir/2001/10/post_1.php |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150427072651/http://corp.toei-anim.co.jp/ir/2001/10/post_1.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-04-27 |script-title=ja:韓国におけるアニメーション専門衛星放送会社への出資について |date=2001-10-24 |publisher=Toei Animation |language=Japanese |accessdate=2008-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Daewon licensed the rights for television and comic distribution of ''[[One Piece]]'' and ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'' from [[TV Tokyo]] and [[Toei Animation]], respectively.

In the [[United States of America]], the '''Day of Dialogue''' is an annual student-focused event that challenges [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref name=cnn11112010&gt;{{cite news|url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2010/11/11/new-christian-sponsor-takes-over-event-challenging-homosexuality/|title=

==History==

===ADF's Day of Truth===
The "Day of Truth" event was first organized in 2005, primarily through the efforts of the Alliance Defense Fund, with the endorsement of several major conservative and anti-LGBT organizations, including the Christian ministry group Focus on the Family and the [[Southern Baptist Convention]]'s Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission.&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"&gt;"[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7477978#.WWp8qoqQz5K Group Makes Noise Over Day of Silence: Day of Truth Designed to Counter Gay-Supportive Observance]". [[Associated Press]]. April&amp;nbsp;12, 2005. Via [[MSNBC]]. Retrieved 2017-07-15.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Alliance Defense Fund, the event was established in order to "counter the promotion of the homosexual agenda and express an opposing viewpoint from a Christian perspective."&lt;ref name="dayoftruth.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dayoftruth.org/about/default.aspx |title=Learn About It: The Day of Truth Is Scheduled for April 20, 2009 |website=Day of Truth. ''dayoftruth.org'' |publisher=Alliance Defence Fund |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411040308/http://www.dayoftruth.org/about/default.aspx |archive-date=2009-04-11 |access-date=2017-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the ADF-sponsored "Day of Truth" website stated that the event gave students "an opportunity to speak the Truth in love and have an honest conversation about homosexuality", and encouraged participating students to wear T-shirts and pass out cards with the following message:&lt;blockquote&gt;''I'm speaking the Truth to break the silence. True tolerance means that people with differing&amp;nbsp;— even opposing&amp;nbsp;— viewpoints can freely exchange ideas and respectfully listen to each other. It's time for an honest conversation about homosexuality. There's freedom to change if you want to. Let’s talk.''&lt;ref name="dayoftruth.org" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
ADF claims that students who have attempted to speak against same-sex relationships and behavior have been censored or, in some cases, punished for their actions under campus [[hate-speech]] rules, such as Tyler Chase Harper, a high school student whose bigotry sparked the first Day of Truth. Harper was suspended for wearing a T-shirt that read "Be Ashamed" and "Our School Embraced What God Has Condemned," and on the back read, "Homosexuality is Shameful" and "Romans 1:27." The Alliance Defense Fund filed an unsuccessful federal lawsuit against school officials on behalf of Harper, claiming his religious freedoms were violated. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbcbaptistpress.org/bpnews.asp?ID=20459 |publisher=[[Baptist Press]] |title='Day of Truth' Provides Response to Homosexual-Themed Day |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927031224/http://www.sbcbaptistpress.org/bpnews.asp?ID=20459 |date=March 29, 2005 |last=Foust |first=Michael |archive-date= 2013-09-27 |access-date=2017-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="silenced"/&gt; The Supreme Court ruled that the case was moot because Harper had already graduated, declined to further consider it, and ordered the lower court to [[Vacated judgment|vacate]] their decision against Harper, leaving future matters open for litigation as though the previous trial had never occurred.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/030507.ZOR.html Supreme Court Summary Disposition ]&lt;/ref&gt;
 		 
According to ADF, over 1,100 students in 350 schools participated in the first Day of Truth, in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dayoftruth.org/resources/default.aspx?cid=3560#common5 Day of Truth participation statistics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626034511/http://www.dayoftruth.org/resources/default.aspx?cid=3560 |date=2008-06-26 }}, Day of Truth website&lt;/ref&gt; 
 		 
The second Day of Truth was held on April 27, 2006, with nearly 3,000 students from more than 800 schools participating, according to ADF statistics. In February, ADF alleged that various unnamed bloggers opposed to the Day of Truth had attempted to undermine the event by swamping the Day of Truth web site with requests for brochures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alliancedefensefund.org/news/story.aspx?cid=3736 Breaking the silence: Day of Truth message undeterred by activist's intolerance], Alliance Defense Fund&lt;/ref&gt; 	

According to ADF, more than 7,000 students participated in the third Day of Truth, which was held on April 19, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.onenewsnow.com/legal-courts/2008/01/18/settlement-allows-nj-high-school-students-to-acknowledge-day-of-truth Settlement allows NJ high school students to acknowledge Day of Truth]". ''OneNewsNow.com''. [[American Family Association]]. January&amp;nbsp;18, 2008. Retrieved 2017-07-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  
 		 
In one of several Day of Truth-related legal actions, ADF filed a federal lawsuit in 2006 on behalf of a student who they claim was prevented by his school from participating in the event, despite allowing the Day of Silence.&lt;ref name=silenced&gt;"[https://www.adflegal.org/detailspages/press-release-details/adf-attorneys-seek-justice-for-high-school-student-silenced-on-day-of-truth ADF attorneys seek justice for high school student silenced on Day of Truth]" (press release).

[[Kevin Jennings]] of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network ([[GLSEN]]) has described the event as "a publicity stunt cooked up by a conservative organization with a political agenda; it’s an effort by adults to manipulate some kids."&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com"/&gt; In response, Mike Johnson of ADF contends that “We wouldn’t have come up with the Day of Truth if Christian kids hadn’t been silenced in the first place. . . .  The public school is part of the free market of ideas — if the other side is going to advance their point of view, it’s only fair for the Christian perspective to present their view, too."&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com" /&gt;

===After ADF===
ADF announced that beginning in 2009, it passed on its leadership role in the Day of Truth to an [[ex-gay]] organization, [[Exodus International]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://dayoftruth.org/?page_id=224 Hostile Questions : Day of Truth]&lt;/ref&gt; which had already participated in running the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dayoftruth.org/docs/dayoftruthhomosexualityfaq.pdf Homosexuality FAQ Sheet]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Day of Truth website&lt;/ref&gt; On October 6, 2010, Exodus International said it would no longer be supporting or leading the Day of Truth since it had become too divisive and confrontational.&lt;ref name=cnn11112010/&gt;

On November 6, 2010, Focus on the Family announced it had acquired the Day of Truth event and was renaming it to the Day of Dialogue. Focus on the Family said it would maintain  the event's goal of "encouraging honest and respectful conversation among students about God's design for sexuality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.focusonthefamily.com/about/newsroom/news-releases/20101111-new-focus-on-day-of-truth-now-day-of-dialogue|title=New Focus on Day of Truth: Now "Day of Dialogue|publisher=[[Focus on the Family]]|date=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12106">'''Direct response television''' ('''DRTV''') is any [[Television advertisement|television advertising]] that asks consumers to respond directly to the company — usually either by calling an [[toll-free telephone number]], sending an [[SMS]] message, or by visiting a web site. This is a form of [[direct response marketing]].

There are two types of direct response television, short form, and long form. Short form is any DRTV [[Television advertisement|commercial]] that is two minutes or less in length. Long form direct response is any television commercial longer than two minutes. This was the accepted term for an [[infomercial]] from 1984 until "infomercial" came into vogue in 1988. The most common time period available for purchase as "long form" infomercial media is 28 minutes, 30 seconds in length. Long form is used for products that need to educate the consumer to create awareness and typically have a higher price. A relatively small amount or media time may be purchased in lengths less than 30 minutes but more than 2 minutes. Five minutes is the most commonly available time of these lengths.

Direct response television campaigns are commonly managed by specialist Direct Response or DRTV agencies with a full range of strategic, creative, production, media, and campaign services. They may also be managed by media buying agencies who specialize in direct response. In either case, these agencies purchase two types of air-time in two ways.  The first is to purchase off of a station or broadcast network's rate-card for time.  The second is to purchase remnant airtime, which is time that stations were not able to sell, and need to fill quickly or cheaply to avoid broadcasting dead-air.  This is cheaper for agencies, but they have less control over when their commercials will run.  As DRTV has gained presence outside of its start in the United States, local agencies have developed in many countries.

To qualify as DRTV, the advertising must ask the consumer to contact the advertiser directly by phone, by text message, or via the web. In the early days of DRTV, this was nearly always to purchase the product. Over time, a wide range of consumer actions have become used. And, many consumers watch the advertising but choose to purchase at retail without ever contacting the company. Typically for every unit sold on TV, anywhere from 3 to as high as 15 units might be sold at retail depending on retail distribution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.targetmarketingmag.com/article/the-drtv-x-factor-celebrity-endorsements-80716/1 Retail Impact]&lt;/ref&gt;

== DRTV as sales channel ==
When it first appeared, DRTV was used to market goods and services directly from the manufacturer or [[wholesaler]] to the consumer, bypassing [[retail]]. Over time, it has also become used as a more general advertising medium and is now used by a wide range of companies --- often to support retail distribution.  Non-profit organizations also benefit from DRTV by making a direct appeal to viewers to make a donation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/3-surprising-lessons-major-nonprofit-learned-when-it-analyzed-its-advertising-171588/]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Many types of companies use DRTV. Marketing companies who specialize in DRTV continue to use the format to offer product exclusively sold through TV. Many of these items find their way to retail shelves once their television campaign has ended or has matured.  For example, the [[Dirt Devil]] Broom Vac was [[BKV#History|only available on TV for three months]] before retail launch. Mass merchant retailers often have "[[As seen on TV (marketing)|as seen on TV]]" sections in their stores.

== DRTV as advertising for brand marketers and retailers ==
Starting in the 1990s, many brand manufacturers began to use DRTV as a part of their advertising mix. In these cases, most products featured on DRTV are also available at retail. The DRTV campaigns ask for direct consumer action either to purchase the product or to obtain a coupon which they can use at the retail store. Companies who have used DRTV for these purposes include DuPont (Teflon),&lt;ref&gt;Haire, Thomas. "DuPont's Teflon Slides Into DRTV," ''Response'', September 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton-Beach, Space Bag, Rubbermaid, P&amp;G, Toyota, Philips Consumer Electronics, Bissell, Evinrude, and Sears (Craftsman brand).

DRTV has also become a commonly used advertising medium for insurance companies, mortgage companies, cell phone providers, credit card companies, and a host of other services. Companies using this approach include Blue Shield, AAA Insurance (CSAA),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.responsemagazine.com/response-magazine/easy-aaa-859 (CSAA)]&lt;/ref&gt; Bank of America,&lt;ref&gt;Hawthorne, Timothy R., ''The Complete Guide to Infomercial Marketing''. NTC Business Books, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Citibank Credit Cards, DirecTV, Dish Network, and many more.

Lead generation has become a large segment of many DRTV campaigns. Typically these campaigns collect leads and close the sale at a later date via direct mail, email, or phone specialists. Other uses of DRTV include branding via hybrid campaigns, whereas you create awareness of the product and drive retail sales with no firm response goal. This is sometimes called Brand Response TV, (BRTV).

== DRTV Advertising Agencies ==
There are numerous DRTV advertising agencies that specialize in short form and long form direct response advertising.

•[https://atomicdirect.com Atomic Direct] is a DRTV specialist which has pioneered campaigns which maximize the combination of direct and retail sales driven by DRTV and created campaigns for Kobalt Tools (Lowe's), AAA of California, Rubbermaid, the Mission Towel, and DuPont.

A '''dolphinarium''' is an [[public aquarium|aquarium]] for [[dolphin]]s. The dolphins are usually kept in a large pool, though occasionally they may be kept in pens in the open sea, either for research or for public performances. Some dolphinariums consist of one pool where dolphins perform for the public, others are part of larger parks, such as [[marine mammal park]]s, [[zoo]]s or [[theme parks]], with other animals and attractions as well.

While [[cetaceans]] have been held in captivity since the 1860s, the first commercial dolphinarium was opened only in 1938. Their popularity increased rapidly until the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Johnson 1994"/&gt; Since the 1970s, increasing concern for [[animal welfare]] led to stricter regulation, which in several countries ultimately resulted in the closure of some dolphinariums. Despite this trend, dolphinariums are still widespread in Europe, Japan and North America.

The most common species of dolphin kept in dolphinariums is the [[bottlenose dolphin]], as it is relatively easy to train and has a long lifespan in captivity. While trade in dolphins is internationally regulated, other aspects of keeping dolphins in captivity, such as the minimum size and characteristics of pools, vary among countries.&lt;ref name="UNEP"/&gt; Though animal welfare is perceived to have improved significantly over the last few decades, many animal rights groups still consider keeping dolphins captive to be a form of [[animal abuse]].

==History==

Barnum's Museum Boiled Two Whales Alive &amp;#124; Smart News &amp;#124; Smithsonian |publisher=Smithsonianmag.com |date=2015-07-20 |accessdate=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; dolphins were first kept for paid entertainment in the [[Marineland of Florida|Marine Studios]] dolphinarium founded in 1938 in [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]], [[Florida]]. It was here that it was discovered that dolphins could be trained to perform tricks. Recognizing the success of Marine Studios, more dolphinariums began keeping dolphins for entertainment.&lt;ref name="Johnson 1994"&gt;"Following P.T. Barnum's ill-fated display of white whales in his New York Museum in 1860, it was not until 1913 that cetaceans were again seen in captivity, this time when C. H. Townsend, curator of the New York Aquarium, stumbled upon the idea exhibiting dolphins as an unbeatable novelty to attract the crowds.", "During feeding time at Marine Studios, it is said, dolphins gradually fell into the habit of jumping up to catch the fish that were thrown to them, and this miniature spectacle always amused the public, the keepers and curator. Then a year later in 1939, Cecil M. Walker, then responsible for maintenance of the water purification pumps on the night-shift, observed one evening how a dolphin pushed a pelican feather across the surface of the water towards him. "Just for the hell of it" he took the proffered feather and threw it back into the water, whereupon, to his great surprise, the dolphin brought it back again. The game continued with Walker experimenting with a ball, an inner tube of a bicycle, small stones and other objects. As the game took shape with other dolphins joining in the act, it began to resemble the repertoire seen today in every dolphinarium in the world.", quotes from ''The rose-tinted menagerie''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, keeping dolphins in zoos and aquariums for entertainment purposes increased in popularity after the 1963 [[Flipper (1963 film)|''Flipper'' movie]] and subsequent [[Flipper (1964 TV series)|''Flipper'' television series]]. In 1966, the first dolphin was exported to [[Europe]]. In these early days, dolphinariums could grow quickly due to a lack of legislation and lack of concern for [[animal welfare]].

New legislation, most notably the 1972 [[Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972|Marine Mammal Protection Act]] in the [[United States]], combined with a more critical view on animal welfare, forced many dolphinariums around the world to close. A prominent example is the [[United Kingdom]]; in the early 1970s there were at least 36 dolphinariums and traveling dolphin shows, however, the last dolphinarium closed its doors in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;"In the golden heyday of the industry, there were at least 36 assorted dolphinaria or itinerant dolphin shows in the UK.", quote from ''The rose-tinted menagerie''&lt;/ref&gt; The last dolphinarium in [[Hungary]] was closed in 1992. In 2005 both [[Chile]] and [[Costa Rica]] prohibited keeping cetaceans captive.&lt;ref name="UNEP"&gt;{{cite web|title=UNEP:Guidelines and criteria associated with marine mammal captivity|year=2006|url=http://www.cep.unep.org/meetings-events/4th-spaw-stac-1/ig25-inf8en.pdf/view|accessdate=22 November 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308043541/http://www.cep.unep.org/meetings-events/4th-spaw-stac-1/ig25-inf8en.pdf/view|archivedate=8 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, around 60 dolphinariums currently exist across Europe, of which 34 are within the [[European Union|EU]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oceancare.org/en/press/2009/07/dolphinaria.php Oceancare:Dolphinariums in Europe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613102825/http://oceancare.org/en/press/2009/07/dolphinaria.php |date=2010-06-13 }}, retrieved November 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of dolphinariums#Japan|Japan]], [[List of dolphinariums#Mexico|Mexico]] and the [[List of dolphinariums#United States|United States]] are also home to a relatively large number of dolphinariums.

==Design==
[[Image:Brookfield zoo fg10.jpg|alt=Two dolphins jumping high in the air in an indoor pool before an audience|thumb|right|The [[Brookfield Zoo]] dolphinarium in [[Chicago]] ]]
Many varied designs exist, but basic dolphinarium design for public performances often consists of stands for the public around a semi-circular pool, sometimes with glass walls which allow underwater viewing, and a platform in the middle from which the trainers direct and present the show.

The water in the pools has to be constantly filtered to keep it clean for the dolphins and the spectators, and the temperature and composition of the water has to be controlled to match the conditions dolphins experience in the wild. In the absence of a common international regulation, guidelines regarding the minimum size of the pools vary between countries.&lt;ref name="UNEP"/&gt; To give an indication of pool sizes, the ''European Association for Aquatic Mammals'' recommends that a pool for five dolphins should have a [[surface area]] of {{convert|275|m2|ft2|abbr=on}} plus an additional {{convert|75|m2|ft2|abbr=on}} for every additional animal, have a depth of {{convert|3.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} and have a water volume of at least {{convert|1000|m3|ft3|abbr=on}} with an additional {{convert|200|m3|ft3|abbr=on}} for every additional animal. If two of these three conditions are met, and the third is not more than 10% below standard, the EAAM considers the pool size to be acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marineconnection.org/docs/EAAM%20Regulations.doc Recommended EAAM dolphin housing standards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822104002/https://www.marineconnection.org/docs/EAAM%20Regulations.doc |date=August 22, 2007 }}, retrieved 22 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animals==
[[Image:Shamu Stadium.jpg|alt=Three orcas jumping at a trainer's command in an artificial pool, while being shown on a big screen television|thumb|right|[[Killer whales]] performing in ''[[Shamu (SeaWorld show)|Shamu]] stadium'' at [[SeaWorld Orlando|SeaWorld]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Florida]]]]

===Species===
Various species of dolphins are kept in captivity as well as several other small whale species such as [[Harbour Porpoise]]s, [[Finless Porpoise]]s and [[beluga whale|Belugas]], though in those cases the word dolphinarium may not be fitting as these are not true dolphins. [[Bottlenose Dolphin]]s are the most common species of dolphin kept in dolphinariums as they are relatively easy to train, have a long lifespan in captivity and a friendly appearance. Hundreds if not thousands of Bottlenose Dolphins live in captivity across the world, though exact numbers are hard to determine. [[Orca]]s are well known for their performances in shows, but the number of Orcas kept in captivity is very small, especially when compared to the number of bottlenose dolphins, with only 44 [[captive orcas]] being held in aquaria as of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orcahome.de/orcastat.htm Orcas in Captivity - A look at killer whales in aquariums and parks] (when viewed 23rd of November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Of all Orcas kept in captivity, the majority are located in the various [[SeaWorld San Diego|SeaWorld]] parks in the United States. Other species kept in captivity are [[Atlantic Spotted Dolphin|Spotted Dolphins]], [[False Killer Whale]]s, [[Pilot Whale]]s and [[Common Dolphin]]s, [[Commerson's Dolphin]]s, as well as [[Rough-toothed Dolphin]]s, but all in much lower numbers than the Bottlenose Dolphin. There are also fewer than ten [[Amazon River Dolphin]]s, [[Risso's Dolphin]]s, or [[Tucuxi]] in captivity. There are few to almost no [[Spinner Dolphin]]s in captivity at the time. Two unusual and very rare [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] dolphins known as [[Wolphins]] are kept at the Sea Life Park in [[Hawaii]], which are a cross between a Bottlenose Dolphin and a False Killer Whale. Also two Common/Bottlenose hybrids reside in captivity: one at [[Discovery Cove]] and the other SeaWorld San Diego.

===Trade and capture===
[[Image:Dolsling.jpg|alt=A dolphin in a sling being lowered by staff into one of two dolphin tubs on back of a truck|thumb|Dolphin being loaded onto a truck after having been captured in a drive hunt in Futo, Japan.]]
In the early days, many Bottlenose dolphins were wild-caught off the coast of Florida. Though the Marine Mammal Protection Act, established in 1972, allows an exception for the collection of dolphins for public display and research purposes when a permit is obtained, Bottlenose dolphins have not been captured in American waters since 1989. In most Western countries, breeding programs have been set up to provide the dolphinariums with new animals. To achieve a sufficient birth rate and to prevent inbreeding, [[artificial insemination]] (AI) is occasionally used. The use of AI also allows dolphinariums to increase the [[genetic diversity]] of their population without having to bring in any dolphins from other facilities.

The trade of dolphins is regulated by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (also known as the Washington Convention or [[CITES]]). Endangered dolphin species are included in CITES’ Appendix I, in which case trade is permitted only in exceptional circumstances. Species considered not to be threatened with extinction are included in Appendix II, in which case trade “must be controlled in order to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival”. Most cetacean species traded for display in captivity to the public or for use in swimming with dolphins and other interaction programs are listed on Appendix II.&lt;ref name="UNEP"/&gt;

However, live dolphins trade still continues. A live Bottlenose Dolphin is estimated to be worth between a few thousand to several tens of thousands of [[US dollar]]s, depending on age, condition and prior training. Captures are reported to be on the rise in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]] and the [[Caribbean]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/captive_marine/facts/held_captive_developing_nations.html The Humane Society: Held Captive: Developing Nations, (2009)], retrieved 22 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cuba]] has also been an exporter of dolphins in recent years, this being organized by the ''Acuario Nacional de Cuba''.&lt;ref&gt;"But it is in Fidel Castro's revolutionary Cuba that dolphin catching in South America has been given a new lease of life, under the auspices of the quasi state-run enterprise Acuario Nacional.", quote from ''The rose-tinted menagerie''&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the [[Solomon Islands]] have also allowed the collection and export of dolphins for public display facilities.&lt;ref&gt;HONIARA, Solomon Islands (Reuters) - A cargo plane arrived in the lawless Solomon Islands Monday to pick up wild dolphins captured to order for a Mexican syndicate in what activists have blasted as an environmental crime, regional media reported.

Several American dolphinariums had also done so. This practice was halted in 1993, when the US [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] refused a permit for [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom|Marine World Africa USA]] to import four False Killer Whales caught in a Japanese drive hunt.

==Criticism==

===Animal welfare===
[[Image:Dolphinarium Varna.jpg|alt=A dolphin interacts with two trainers on a stage at indoor pool; the audience stands are empty. Large windows allow light in.|thumb|right|The Festa Dolphinarium in [[Varna]], [[Bulgaria]]]]
Many animal welfare groups such as the [[World Animal Protection]] consider keeping dolphins in captivity to be a form of [[animal abuse]]. The main arguments are that dolphins do not have enough freedom of movement in pools, regardless of pool size, (in the wild, dolphins swim hundreds of miles every day) and do not get enough stimulation.  Dolphins often show repetitive behavior in captivity and sometimes become aggressive towards other animals or people. In some cases, the behavior of dolphins in captivity also results in their own death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldanimalprotection.us.org/our-work/animals-wild/marine-animals-captivity Marine animals in captivity], [[World Animal Protection]]. Retrieved 18 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lifespan of dolphins in captivity is another subject of debate. Research has shown that Orcas indeed have a much lower survival rate in captivity;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orcanetwork.org/nathist/releasability/survival.htm Orcanetwork:Survival rates in captivity], retrieved November 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; however, there is no significant difference between wild and captive survival rates for Bottlenose dolphins.&lt;ref&gt;Willis, K. 2007. "Life Expectancy of Bottlenose Dolphins in Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums' North American Member Facilities: 1990 - present". Presented at the 2007 meeting of the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums.&lt;/ref&gt; This does not, however, reflect a global state of affairs: for example, Bottlenose dolphins in captive facilities in [[Jamaica]] suffer from extremely high mortality rates.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Management Consultants Ltd. (2007), [http://www.marineconnection.org/docs/JET%20EIA%20assessment.pdf Review of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) For the Proposed Dolphin Park in Paradise, Hanover] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123055920/http://www.marineconnection.org/docs/JET%20EIA%20assessment.pdf |date=2009-11-23 }}, page 3, section Mortalities. Article retrieved November 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scientists suggest that the "unusually high" intelligence of dolphins&lt;ref name="io9"/&gt; means that they should be recognized as "non-human persons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dolphins deserve same rights as humans, say scientists|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-17116882|accessdate=18 February 2016|work=BBC News|date=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)|Indian Ministry of Environment and Forests]] prohibited the captivity of dolphins on these grounds, finding it "morally unacceptable to keep them captive for entertainment purpose".&lt;ref name="io9"&gt;{{cite news|title=No, India did not just grant dolphins the status of humans|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/no-india-did-not-just-grant-dolphins-the-status-of-hum-1149482273|accessdate=18 February 2016|work=io9|date=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[House of Commons of Canada]] passed Bill S-203, ''Ending the Captivity of Whales and Dolphins Act'', and sent it to the [[Senate of Canada]]. Two facilities would be affected, [[Marineland of Canada]] and the [[Vancouver Aquarium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/liberal-government-ban-cetaceans-1.4524432 |title= Ottawa to ban capture of dolphins, whales |work=CBC|date= February 8, 2018|accessdate=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Progressive Conservatives in the Senate were accused of using procedural obstruction to keep the bill from moving to a vote. In June 2018, such senators added amendments intended to exclude Marineland and the Vancouver Aquarium from being covered by the bill. After three years, the eventual outcome was not yet known in October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/ipolitics/federal/2018/10/04/bill-to-ban-whale-and-dolphin-captivity-is-being-stalled-in-the-senate-again.html|title=Bill to ban whale and dolphin captivity is being stalled in the Senate — again|first=Holly|last=Lake|date=May 4, 2017|publisher=Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4830">'''ETSI Satellite Digital Radio''' ('''SDR''' or '''ETSI SDR''') describes a standard of [[satellite radio|satellite digital radio]]. It is an activity of the European standardisation organisation [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute|ETSI]].

It addresses systems where a satellite broadcast directly to mobile and handheld receivers in [[L band]] or [[S band]] and is complemented by terrestrial transmitters. The broadcast content consists of multicast audio ([[digital radio]]), video ([[mobile TV]]) and data (program guide, text and graphical information, as well as off-line content). The satellite component allows geographical coverage at low cost, whereas the terrestrial component improves reception quality in built up areas. The specifications considers [[conditional access]] and [[Digital Rights Management]].&lt;ref&gt;ETSI TR 102 525 v1.1.1 (2006-09) Satellite Earth Stations and Systems (SES); Satellite Digital Radio (SDR) service; Functionalities, architecture and technologies&lt;/ref&gt;

[[1worldspace]] will use ETSI SDR in its new network covering Europe from 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investor.worldspace.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=189783&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=993940&amp;highlight= WORLDSPACE(R) Satellite Radio Signs Fraunhofer IIS to Develop 'Blueprint' for European Satellite Radio Receivers]&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[Ondas Media]] has announced to use ETSI SDR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ondasmedia.com/news/ondas-09.html ONDAS Media: Helping to Set the Standards for Satellite Digital Radio in Europe (Ondas Media)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ETSI SDR is also similar to the [[Sirius XM Radio]], the [[S-DMB]] used in South Korea for multimedia broadcasting since May 2005, the [[China Multimedia Mobile Broadcasting]] (CMMB) and the defunct [[MobaHo!]] service (2004-2009). The [[DVB-SH]] specifications, which the [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB Project]] has created, target similar broadcast systems as ETSI SDR.

==ETSI SDR Standard==
The ETSI SDR standard allows implementation of parts of such networks in an interoperable way. So far, ETSI has standardized the physical layer of the air interface (radio interface). This allows implementation of demodulators in integrated circuits. The physical layer is described by the following parts of ETSI EN 302 550:

* ETSI EN 302 550-1-1 "Satellite Earth Stations and Systems (SES); Satellite Digital Radio (SDR) Systems; Part 1: Physical Layer of the Radio Interface; Sub-Part 1: Outer Physical Layer"
* ETSI EN 302 550-1-2 "Satellite Earth Stations and Systems (SES); Satellite Digital Radio (SDR) Systems; Part 1: Physical Layer of the Radio Interface; Sub-Part 2: Inner Physical Layer Single Carrier Modulation"
* ETSI EN 302 550-1-3 "Satellite Earth Stations and Systems (SES); Satellite Digital Radio (SDR) Systems; Inner Physical Layer of the Radio Interface; Part 1: Physical Layer of the Radio Interface; Sub-Part 3: Inner Physical Layer Multi Carrier Modulation" 

These three parts replace the previous ETSI SDR standards ETSI TS 102 550, ETSI TS 102 551-1 and ETSI TS 102 551-2. 

The following technical report contains guidelines for the use of these standards:
* ETSI TR 102 604 ''Satellite Earth Stations and Systems (SES); Satellite Digital Radio (SDR) Systems; Guidelines for the use of the physical layer standards''

The following technical report describes the facts and assumptions on which the SDR standards are based:
* ETSI TR 102 525 "Satellite Earth Stations and Systems (SES); Satellite Digital Radio (SDR) service; Functionalities, architecture and technologies"
Note that in this document the word "may" replaces the word "shall" due to a decision of the ETSI Board in June 2006.

All ETSI specifications are [[open standard]]s available at [http://pda.etsi.org/pda/queryform.asp ETSI Publications Download Area] (this will open ETSI document search engine; free registration is required to download PDF files).

'''Emily Litella''' is a fictional character created and performed by [[comedian]] [[Gilda Radner]] in a series of appearances on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite news|last=Barone |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Barone (pundit) |title=At NASA, an Emily Litella Moment |newspaper=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] |pages= |date=September 28, 2005

|access-date=September 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on a person in her early life, Emily Litella is a popular character in Radner's comedy repertoire.

==Premise==
Emily Litella is an elderly woman with a hearing problem who appeared 26 times on ''SNL's'' ''[[Weekend Update]]'' [[editorial|op-ed segment]] in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="Fruchter"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fruchter|first=Rena|title=I'm Chevy Chase ... and You're Not|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mqgsolG6bv0C&amp;pg=PT199|date=January 17, 2013|publisher=Random House|location=London|isbn=978-0-7535-2114-4|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://snl.jt.org/char.php-i=6.html |title=Emily Litella, played by Gilda Radner |work=SNL Archive |accessdate=April 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attired in a frumpy dress, sweater and [[The Nerds|Lisa Loopner]] glasses, Litella was introduced with professional dignity by the news anchors, who could sometimes be seen cringing slightly in anticipation of the [[malapropism]]s they knew would follow. These [[Sketch comedy|sketches]] were, in part, a parody of the [[Fairness Doctrine]], which at the time required broadcasters in the United States to present opposing viewpoints on public issues. 

Litella would peer through her reading glasses and, in the character's high-pitched, warbly voice, would read a prepared statement in opposition to an [[editorial]] that the TV station had supposedly broadcast. Litella would become increasingly agitated as her statement progressed. Midway in her commentary, it became apparent to the anchor, and the audience, that Litella had misheard or misunderstood the subject of the editorial to which she was responding. A typical example: 

{{quote|What is all this fuss I hear about the Supreme Court decision on a "deaf" penalty? It's terrible! Deaf people have enough problems as it is!&lt;ref name="Baskin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baskin|first=Edie|editor=Anne P. Beatts|others= John Head|title=Saturday Night Live|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O4SFAAAAIAAJ|year=1977|publisher=Avon Books|isbn=978-0-380-01801-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The news anchor would  interrupt Litella to point out her error, along the lines, "That's ''death'' penalty, Ms. Litella, not ''deaf'' ... ''death''."&lt;ref name="Baskin" /&gt; Litella would wrinkle her nose, say something like, "Oh, that's very different," then meekly turn to the camera and say, smiling, "Never mind!"&lt;ref name="ShalesMiller2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shales|first1=Tom |last2= Miller|first2=James Andrew|title=Live From New York: An Uncensored History Of Saturday Night Live|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aNDb1d2i9KkC&amp;pg=PT125|date=November 16, 2008|publisher=Little, Brown|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-316-04582-7|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other misheard topics to which Litella responded included "saving Soviet jewelry" [Jewry],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shales |first=Tom |date=22 May 1989 |title=The Afterglow of Gilda Radner; The Nutty but Nice Graduate of Saturday Night |newspaper=The Washington Post |location=B01}}&lt;/ref&gt; "endangered feces" [species],&lt;ref name="ShalesMiller2008" /&gt; "violins on television" [violence],&lt;ref name="Sorensen"&gt;{{cite book|last= Sorensen|first=Roy A.|title=Pseudo-Problems: How Analytic Philosophy Gets Done|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=81wJ_j6x86EC&amp;pg=PA108|date=January 22, 2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-203-04868-9|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; "presidential erections" (elections) and "flea erections" (free elections),&lt;ref name="Robinson2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Peter M.|title=The Dance of the Comedians: The People, the President, and the Performance of Political Standup Comedy in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Tgf-lXwsiAC&amp;pg=PA200|year=2010|publisher=Univ of Massachusetts Press|location=Amherst &amp; Boston|isbn=978-1-55849-785-6|pages=200–}}&lt;/ref&gt; "conserving natural racehorses" &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[natural resource]]s&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;,&lt;ref name="Sorensen" /&gt; "firing the handicapped" [hiring],&lt;ref name="Fruchter" /&gt; and "making Puerto Rico a steak" [state].&lt;ref name="Malloy1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Malloy|first=Merrit|title=The Quotable Quote Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=THQb3KuhyWwC|date=August 30, 1990|publisher=Carol Publishing Group|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-8065-1220-4|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; About the last of these topics, she complained, "Next thing you know, they'll want a baked potato with sour cream!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Saltzman|first=David A. |date=March 2008 |title=Never Mind |journal=Life Insurance Selling |volume=83 |issue=3 |pages=112–114 |oclc=2906328 &lt;!--|issn=0024-3140--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Litella played against news anchor [[Chevy Chase]] (whom she often called "Cheddar Cheese"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Joey the dachshund: 'OK, OK, I get it. I'm short. Must you keep reminding me?' |date=8 November 2011 |newspaper=Saint Paul Pioneer Press |location=Bulletin Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;), he would be somewhat sympathetic to her. But when [[Jane Curtin]] took over the anchor role, she would scold Litella, "Every week you come on and you get it wrong," to which Litella would reply, "Bitch!"&lt;ref name="ShalesMiller2008" /&gt;

==History==
Radner based Litella on her childhood nanny, Elizabeth Clementine Gillies, known as "Dibby", who was allegedly hard of hearing.&lt;ref name="Jackson_1998"&gt;{{cite book | last=Jackson | first=Kenneth T. | title=The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives: 1986-1990 | page=718 | publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons | year=1998 | isbn=0684804913 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nHURAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Elizabeth+Clementine+Gillies%22&amp;dq=%22Elizabeth+Clementine+Gillies%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjq8d-sufTOAhUG_R4KHce1AzcQ6AEIKTAC | accessdate=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Radner_2015"&gt;{{cite book | last=Radner | first=Gilda | title=It's Always Something | publisher=Simon and Schuster | date= June 2, 2015 | isbn=1501126636 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XwrzCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=%22Elizabeth+Clementine+Gillies%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjq8d-sufTOAhUG_R4KHce1AzcQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Elizabeth%20Clementine%20Gillies%22&amp;f=false | accessdate=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[running gag]] "Never mind" became a lighthearted [[catchphrase]] of the era.&lt;ref name="Robinson_2002"&gt;{{cite book | last=Robinson | first=Marc | title=Brought to You in Living Color | publisher=Wiley | year=2002 | page=134 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WRfuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22never++mind%22+%22emily%22+%22catchphrase%22&amp;dq=%22never++mind%22+%22emily%22+%22catchphrase%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwio_eOmtvTOAhUIGB4KHZ4dB5oQ6AEIHjAA | accessdate=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stein_2013"&gt;{{cite book | last=Stein | first=Ellin | title=That's Not Funny, That's Sick: The National Lampoon and the Comedy Insurgents Who Captured the Mainstream | publisher=W.

In her first appearance on ''SNL'', the character of Emily Litella was an author who appeared as an interview subject on a show called "Looks At Books".  Though she had the same wavery voice and somewhat frumpy wardrobe as she would in later episodes, Litella did not appear to have a hearing problem in this appearance.  All subsequent ''SNL'' appearances by Litella were at the newsdesk, and featured the by-now much more familiar "editorial reply" iteration of the character.

Outside of ''Saturday Night Live'', Radner played the character briefly on ''[[The Muppet Show]]''.  At the top of that episode, Miss Litella is discovered [[wikt:backstage|backstage]] by [[stage manager]] [[Scooter (Muppet)|Scooter]], where she is vociferously complaining about the indignity of her appearing in something so silly as "The Muffin Show", whereupon Scooter gently persuades Miss Litella that she would be appearing on "The Muppet Show", not "The Muffin Show". After hearing this reassurance, she withdraws her objection, and meekly apologizes to Scooter by saying, "Never mind."

The character also appeared in Radner's 1979 one-woman [[off-Broadway]] show, ''Gilda Live'', in which  Litella took a job as a [[substitute teacher]] in [[Bedford-Stuyvesant]], replacing a teacher who had been a victim of a stabbing by one of his students, which put him in the hospital.

Miss Litella further cautioned her new students to be very careful where they put their toes, as the regular teacher's "stubbing" was the third such "stubbing", as Miss Litella put it, at the school that week alone; and that the "stubbings" must be pretty serious, in order to have put their teacher in hospital indefinitely. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

A similar character, Anthony Crispino (played by [[Bobby Moynihan]]), made his first appearance on a ''[[Weekend Update]]'' in [[Saturday Night Live (season 37)|Season 37]], and became a recurring character.&lt;ref name="EW_Busis_2014-12-07"&gt;{{cite news | last=Busis | first=Hillary | title=Saturday Night Live recap: 'James Franco and Nicki Minaj' | work=Entertainment Weekly | date=December 7, 2014 | url=http://www.ew.com/recap/saturday-night-live-james-franco-nicki-minaj | accessdate=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spending money on [[entertainment]] was out of the question for most people. The United States put the nation back to work, including artists and entertainers in its assistance programs. The entertainers, in turn, provided cheap or free amusements for people, which allowed them to forget about their troubles for a while.&lt;ref name="LOC"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Art and Entertainment in the 1930s and 1940s | work = Great Depression and World War II, 1929-1945 | publisher = Library of Congress | date = 2002-09-26 | url = http://memory.loc.gov/learn//features/timeline/depwwii/art/art.html | accessdate = 2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movies==

Many films still highly cherished today were created during the 1920s. During that period, [[Walt Disney]], the pioneer animator, produced films Americans loved to see. One of his best known animations was the tale of the ''[[Three Little Pigs (film)|Three Little Pigs]]'', originally produced in 1933. This is another of his that became a part of American culture. Half a century later, his productions are still famous and frequently viewed by children and adults. Many flicks were created during this time, including, ''[[42nd Street (film)|42nd Street]]'', ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]''.

[[Comedies]] were popular films in the 1930s. A good laugh eased the mind and brought joy in a time of adversity. Towards the late 1930s, films that showed how America was fighting against the Great Depression became popular as well.

==Radio==
Listening to [[radio broadcasting]] became a source of nearly free entertainment for millions of Americans. The radio stations had a little bit of everything for all ages, young and old. One of the most common radio shows for young children was ''[[Little Orphan Annie#Radio|Little Orphan Annie]]''.&lt;ref name="Time of Depression"&gt;{{Cite web |last= |first=Anisa &amp; Michelle |title=The 1930s: A Time of Depression |work= |publisher=Kyrene School District No. 2098 |url=http://www.kyrene.k12.az.us/schools/brisas/sunda/decade/1930.htm#entertainment |accessdate=2010-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214221354/http://www.kyrene.k12.az.us/schools/brisas/sunda/decade/1930.htm#entertainment |archivedate=2010-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show is about an adventurous young girl who had an equally adventurous dog named Sandy. Together, Annie and Sandy would try to solve mysteries. The show was so loved by children that they soon began to purchase small items of merchandise such as pins of Annie. Later, an actual film was released to the public.&lt;ref name="Time of Depression"/&gt; Adults listened to newscasts, radio theater, the [[Grand Ole Opry]], soap operas, and sermons as well.

==Background==
Set more than 21,000 years in the future, the background story of ''Eve Online'' explains that humanity, having used up most of Earth's resources through centuries of explosive population growth, began colonizing the rest of the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref name="eve_background"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveonline.com/background/ |title=Eve Online background story page |accessdate=January 15, 2008 |author=CCP Games |publisher=eveonline.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222195922/http://www.eveonline.com/background/ |archivedate=February 22, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="amarr_timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://community.eveonline.com/backstory/races/amarr/timeline/|title=Timeline of the Amarr Empire|accessdate=January 15, 2008|author=CCP Games|publisher=eveonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As on Earth, this expansion also led to competition and fighting over available resources, but everything changed with the discovery of a natural wormhole leading to an unexplored galaxy subsequently dubbed "New Eden." Dozens of colonies were founded, and a structure, a gate of sorts (which bears the inscription "EVE" on the New Eden side), was built to stabilize the wormhole that linked the colonies of New Eden with the rest of human civilization. However, when the wormhole unexpectedly collapsed, it destroyed the gate as well as the connection between the colonies of New Eden and the Milky Way. Cut off from the rest of humanity and supplies from Earth, the colonies of New Eden were left starving and disconnected from one another; many died out entirely. Over the millennia the descendants of the surviving colonists managed to rebuild their own societies, but by this time the memories and knowledge of humanity's origins, of Earth and the Milky Way galaxy, as well as the history of the settling of New Eden, was lost; what little information that survived transmission over the generations was misunderstood, lost in translation, and/or consigned to mythology. Five major distinct societies rose to prominence from the surviving colonies, each growing into interstellar spaceflight-capable civilizations. The states based around these societies &lt;!--The Amarr, Caldari, and the Federation contain descendants of colonists from multiple planets, so don't replace "these states" with "these colonies"--&gt; make up the five major factions in ''Eve Online'': the Amarr Empire, the Caldari State, the Gallente Federation, the Minmatar Republic and the Jove Directorate.

===Races===
[[File:The four playable EVE races as seen during character creation.png|250px|thumb|left|The four playable races in ''Eve Online'' as seen on the character creation menus]]
The Amarr, a militantly theocratic empire, was the first of the playable races to rediscover faster-than-light travel.&lt;ref name="amarr_timeline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="amarr_background"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://community.eveonline.com/backstory/races/amarr/|title=Background on the Amarr race|accessdate=January 15, 2008|author=CCP Games|publisher=eveonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of physical proximity, the space occupied by this society is physically nearest to the demolished EVE gate. Armed with this new technology and the strength of their faith in their god, the Amarr expanded their empire by conquering and enslaving several races, including the Minmatar race, who had only just begun colonizing other planets.&lt;ref name="minmatar_background"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://community.eveonline.com/backstory/races/minmatar/|title=Background on the Minmatar race|accessdate=January 15, 2008|author=CCP Games|publisher=eveonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="minmatar_timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://community.eveonline.com/backstory/races/minmatar/timeline/|title=Timeline of the Minmatar tribes|accessdate=January 15, 2008|author=CCP Games|publisher=eveonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generations later, after the intense culture shock of encountering the Gallente Federation, and in the wake of a disastrous attempted invasion of Jovian space, many Minmatar took the opportunity to rebel and successfully overthrew their enslavers, forming their own government. However, much of their population remain enslaved by the Amarr, and some, having adopted the Amarrian religion and sided with their masters during the revolution, were released from bondage and incorporated into the Empire as commoners in the Ammatar Mandate. The free Minmatar Republic, taking as inspiration the ideals and practices of the Gallente Federation, is presently a strong military and economic power actively seeking the emancipation of their brethren and all other slaves.

The Gallente and the Caldari homeworlds are situated in the same star system.&lt;ref name="gallente_background"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://community.eveonline.com/backstory/races/gallente/|title=Background on the Gallente race|accessdate=January 15, 2008|author=CCP Games|publisher=eveonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gallente_timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://community.eveonline.com/backstory/races/gallente/timeline/|title=Timeline of the Gallente Federation|accessdate=January 15, 2008|author=CCP Games|publisher=eveonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gallente homeworld was originally settled by descendants of the French colonists of [[Tau Ceti]]; Caldari Prime on the other hand was purchased by a multinational megacorporation that began to terraform it.&lt;ref name="caldari_background"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://community.eveonline.com/backstory/races/caldari/|title=Background on the Caldari race|accessdate=January 15, 2008|author=CCP Games|publisher=eveonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="caldari_timeline"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://community.eveonline.com/backstory/races/caldari/timeline/|title=Timeline of the Caldari State|accessdate=January 15, 2008|author=CCP Games|publisher=eveonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terraforming of Caldari Prime was incomplete at the time of the EVE wormhole's collapse, however, and the planet remained environmentally inhospitable for millennia. The Gallente restored themselves to a high-functioning technological society some hundred years before the Caldari, building the first lastingly democratic republic of New Eden in the form of the Gallente Federation. Originally the Caldari composed a member race within the Federation, but cultural animosity between the two peoples spiralled into a war during which the Caldari seceded from the Federation to found their own Caldari State. The war lasted 93 years, with neither nation able to overwhelm the other.&lt;ref name="caldari_background" /&gt;&lt;ref name="caldari_timeline" /&gt; The planet Caldari Prime was initially retained by the Gallente Federation during the war, and did not become part of the new Caldari State. Much more recently, however, a Caldari offensive managed to recapture their lost homeworld, a fact which is viewed with abhorrence by the Gallente, who see the presence of a significant Caldari fleet about the planet as a mass hostage taking.

Both the Gallente Federation and Caldari State are economically- and trade-oriented nations. However, the Gallente favour [[Economic liberalism|liberal economic]] policies, encourage individual [[entrepreneurship]] and [[social democracy]], and maintain a [[Progressivism|progressive]] approach to social welfare, whereas the Caldari State is organised as a form of [[statism|statist]] [[corporatocracy]]; the Caldari State itself is owned by and operated on behalf of a few [[Trust (monopoly)|trust]]-like megaconglomerates. The Gallente Federation's official policies regarding multiculturalism and encouragement of diversity attracts many immigrants to Gallente space; a third of all ethnic Minmatars reside as citizens there. As the Caldari did not share this enthusiasm for diversity with the Gallente, the Caldari State at the time of its formation found itself at a relative population deficit compared to its Gallente adversary; rather than encourage massive immigration to and diversity within the State, this population shortage was rectified by a Statewide programme of artificial reproduction, producing a generation of so-called 'Tube Children' raised by the Caldari State apparatus to enlarge the labour pools available to the megacorporations that ruled the State.

The Jovians (a non-playable race) were also descended from colonists. Unlike the other races of ''Eve Online'', they maintained a relatively high-functioning technological society after the collapse of the EVE wormhole and did not need to spend millennia recapitulating ancient societal developments as the others did, and while the other four major races were still grounded, Jovian history saw two major periods of spacefaring empire.&lt;ref name="jovian_background"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://community.eveonline.com/backstory/races/jove/|title=Background on the Jovian race|accessdate=January 15, 2008|author=CCP Games|publisher=eveonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They expanded outward and eventually turned to genetic engineering in order to mold themselves into a species more suited for deep-space life and long-range interstellar exploration. Genetic experimentation/manipulation was not without its drawbacks, however: by the time period in which players enter the Eve Online universe, the millennia of human genetic manipulation has rendered the Jovians barely recognizable as human; more critically, the Jovian manipulation of their genetics has resulted in the eventually-fatal "Jovian Disease," an inherited psychological disorder which, despite the best efforts of the Jovians to reverse it, has affected every individual of the Jovian race and thus crippled their civilization. Having experienced a catastrophic population decline (the Jovian societal structure is believed to be barely maintained by their immensely-advanced technological systems), the Jovians have effectively retreated to inhabit a region of space inaccessible to outsiders.&lt;ref name="scientific_article_capsule"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveonline.com/background/eggers/ |title=Scientific article "Polyvessel Pilot, Capsule Cleared Part 1: The Capsule &amp; The Clone" |accessdate=June 22, 2008 |author=CCP Games |publisher=eveonline.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228231245/http://www.eveonline.com/background/eggers/ |archivedate=February 28, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to different backgrounds and histories, each of the races have characteristic philosophies of starship design. Minmatar ships tend to be quite fast but fragile, and rely on their high speed and maneuverability to evade the tracking systems of heavier weapons, while themselves using projectile weapons such as artillery or autocannons, more sophisticated kin to [[Gun|today's munitions technology]]. Amarr ships are ponderous, densely armored, and pack batteries of powerful [[laser]]-based energy weaponry. Gallente ships are sleek and designed to favor armor plating; they specialize in deploying fleets of robotic drones while mounting hybrid weapons that operate using superconducting magnets to accelerate mass toward targets at great speed (see [[Railgun]]). Finally, Caldari ships are typically poorly armored and not particularly fast but utilize powerful energy shields, and make extensive use of torpedo/missile launchers and hybrid guns, favoring engagement at extreme ranges.&lt;ref name="weapons_guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.eveonline.com/wiki/Weapons_guide |title=Weapons guide |accessdate=October 23, 2009 |author=CCP Games |publisher=eveonline.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111064750/http://wiki.eveonline.com/wiki/Weapons_guide |archivedate=January 11, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are exceptions to these general rules in each race.

==Gameplay==
{{Main|Gameplay of Eve Online}}
Players start the game by either selecting a previously created character or by creating a new one. Each ''Eve Online'' account allows for up to three characters.&lt;ref name="player_guide_char_creation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveonline.com/guide/en/mn03.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822065509/http://www.eveonline.com/guide/en/mn03.asp|archivedate=August 22, 2008|title=Eve Online Player Guide, Chapter 3, Character Creation|accessdate=September 3, 2008|publisher=eveonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a player creates a new character, they start by choosing one of the four playable races – Amarr, Gallente, Minmatar, or Caldari. Each race is further divided into three bloodlines that give characters different pre-defined appearances, which can be finely tuned by the player.

Unlike many other MMOs, where there are numerous copies of the game universe intended to run at once (i.e., servers), ''Eve Online'' is functionally a single-universe game. There are technically four copies of the universe running: the main server "Tranquility", the Chinese-based "Serenity", the ''event'' test server "Duality"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Duality |title=EVE Online Duality server |accessdate=April 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110323153927/http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Duality |archivedate=March 23, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that is a semi-public test server, and the test server "Singularity" (also "Sisi") which is a general, public test server.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Singularity |title=EVE Online Singularity server |accessdate=April 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314154000/http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Singularity |archivedate=March 14, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A new test server was announced called "Buckingham" to replace "Singularity" as the main EVE Online test server while "Singularity" was used for [[Dust 514]]/EVE Online joint testing. As DUST 514 is no longer active, "Singularity" is now the main test server again and "Buckingham" is a closed test server for the CCP developers.&lt;ref name="buckinghamstatus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Buckingham |title=Buckingham - EVElopedia |accessdate=June 3, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310220503/http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Buckingham |archivedate=March 10, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Universe===
The playing environment in ''Eve Online'' consists of more than 5000 star systems,&lt;ref name="DevBlog498"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/econ-dev-blog-market-overview-for-mineral-markets/|title=Econ Dev Blog – Market Overview for Mineral Markets|accessdate=December 14, 2014|last=Guðmundsson|first=Eyjólfur|date=August 3, 2007|publisher=eveonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as 2500 randomly accessible wormhole systems, taking place in 23341 C.E.&lt;ref name="apocrypha_blog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.eveonline.com/wiki/Apocrypha |title=Apocrypha – EVElopedia – The EVE Online Wiki |publisher=Wiki.eveonline.com |accessdate=April 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115205956/http://wiki.eveonline.com/wiki/Apocrypha |archivedate=January 15, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Systems are classified by their Security Status, on a decimal scale from −1.0 to 1.0.&lt;ref name="syssecurity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/System_security |title=System security |accessdate=October 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107170010/http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/System_security |archivedate=November 7, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="0.0security"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/0.0 |title=0.0 |accessdate=October 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015042935/http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/0.0 |archivedate=October 15, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="allakhazamsecurity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eve.allakhazam.com/wiki/EVE_Guide_Security_Status_Explained|title=EVE Guide Security Status Explained|accessdate=October 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems are categorized into three groups, each determining the response from CONCORD ('''Con'''solidated '''Co'''-operation and '''R'''elations Comman'''d''') [[Non-player character|NPC]] law enforcement units.&lt;ref name="chronicle_concord"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveonline.com/background/potw/jul04.asp |title=Chronicle "CONCORD" |accessdate=December 15, 2008 |author=CCP Games |publisher=eveonline.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307031807/http://www.eveonline.com/background/potw/jul04.asp |archivedate=March 7, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Star systems classed as 0.5–1.0 security are considered "high security" and any unauthorized/unprovoked attack by a character on another character anywhere in the system will result in the appearance of law enforcement. These units will attack and destroy the aggressor, and are designed to reinforce in such strength that they will always win an engagement. However, CONCORD is not preventative, but punitive, meaning there is a short window between beginning an attack and getting destroyed where a player (or group of) can destroy another player's ship. Systems classified as 0.1–0.4 are considered "low security", where CONCORD law enforcement units will not destroy aggressors, but do monitor unprovoked acts of aggression and have automated sentry guns in some locations. Unprovoked attacks will flag the aggressor as a free target for other players, and attacks within sight of sentry guns will cause them to fire on the aggressor. Systems classified 0.0 to −1.0 are called "zero space" or "null sec", and feature no law enforcement; individual systems, or groups of systems, may be controlled by player alliances, up to the creation of player-owned empires reaching across entire "regions" (an aggregate group of star systems). Wormhole systems are accessible only by wormholes that randomly appear and disappear, and are also lawless space, showing as −1.0. However, player-run corporations cannot claim sovereignty in wormhole systems. Star systems contain different types of celestial objects, making them more or less suitable for different kinds of operations. Typically, players find asteroid fields, planets, stations, stargates, and moons in a system. Many of the game's most profitable income sources are found in dangerous null or low security systems, giving players incentive to engage in high-risk, high-reward activities in which they must survive the possible harassment of other players who may also enter the system.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Combat and travel===
[[Image:Eve Online - Empyrean Age screenshot.jpg|300px|thumb|An artist's rendering of ''Rifter''-class frigates after a successful attack against an ''Armageddon''-class battleship]]
The game's primary mode of play is flying around in space ships. Players can dock at stations, where they are safe and can use station services such as repairing, refitting, and the regional market. All space combat takes place in real time at sub-light speeds from around 100&amp;nbsp;m/s to in excess of 8000&amp;nbsp;m/s, depending on ship size and setup. While players can manually control their ships as in space combat simulators such as ''[[Wing Commander (video game)|Wing Commander]]'' or ''[[Star Wars: X-Wing|X-Wing]]'' following the release of the Rhea expansion on December 9, 2014, most opt instead to give commands such as Orbit, Approach or Align to their flight computer, which does its best to comply. Weapon aiming, however, cannot be done manually; instead, the player locks on to an opponent and orders their weapons to fire, and the result is determined through calculations based on factors such as range, velocity, weapon tracking, and a degree of randomness.

Travel across distances longer than hundreds of kilometers is done primarily with the ship's Warp Drive, which every ship and escape pod has, though the player may "slow boat" across distances, traveling without warp drive. The player issues a command to warp to an object, which must be greater than 150&amp;nbsp;km away and in the same star system, and, after an alignment maneuver, their ship will enter warp. After between a few seconds to several minutes, depending on ship speed and warp distance, the ship will arrive at the selected destination. A ship's warp drive can be temporarily disabled by warp disruption weapons, which is an essential part of combat to prevent a target from escaping.

For most ships, travel between star systems is only possible by using structures called "Stargates". Each stargate is linked to a partner stargate in another system; most star systems have more than two stargates&lt;!--two: entry and exit. only dead-ends are exceptions, of which there are few.--&gt;, forming a network through which players travel. While travel within a star system by warp drive is relatively free-form, the need to use stargates to travel between systems makes them focal points for combat.

Capital ships may travel either by stargate or by using jump drives, which require another ship to create a "Cynosural Field" which the capital ship can then jump to. While this allows the capital ship to travel instantaneously, it requires a trusted second party (or an alternate account) to create the beacon. Jump drives also consume fuel (in contrast to stargates, which require nothing), drain the ship of its capacitor, leaving it nearly defenseless until it is recharged, and incur "jump fatigue", which prevents the pilot from jumping for progressively longer periods of time after each consecutive jump. Titans are also capable of allowing other ships to instantaneously travel by creating temporary bridges to cynosural fields. Black Ops battleships can create similar, but undetectable, bridges capable of transporting only specific ship types such as Stealth Bombers.

Player-run corporations that claim sovereignty over two null sec systems within range of each other can also set up a jump bridge at a player owned starbase (POS) that is in orbit of a moon. Jump bridges allow instantaneous travel to the other system's jump bridge, at the cost of using fuel (requiring supply by the owning corporation) scaled to the mass of ships that use them. This also leads to the accumulation of jump fatigue.

===Advancement===
Unlike other [[massively multiplayer online game]]s, player characters in ''Eve Online'' advance continuously over time by training skills, a passive process that occurs in real world time so that the learning process continues even if the player is not logged in.&lt;ref name="eve_playerguide_skills"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveonline.com/guide/en/g615.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618100257/http://www.eveonline.com/guide/en/g615.asp|archivedate=June 18, 2008|title=Eve Online Player Guide, Chapter 6, Skills Guide|accessdate=February 24, 2008|author=CCP Games|publisher=eveonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skill training queue allows up to 50 skills to be scheduled, with up to a 10-year total training schedule. Before the November 4, 2014 "Phoebe" release, the skill training queue allowed skills to be scheduled to start training only up to 24&amp;nbsp;hours in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/longer-queues-expected-skill-training-above-and-beyond-24-hours/|title=Longer Queues Expected: Skill Training Above and Beyond 24 Hours|date=October 28, 2014|accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some skills require other prerequisite skills to be trained to a certain level to be trained, and some skills require more time to train than others; for example, the skill to fly a Titan-class spaceship takes 8 times as long to train as the skill to fly a frigate ship, with a significant number of prerequisite skills.

Until the Odyssey expansion, it was not possible to train more than one character per account at the same time. Odyssey introduced "Dual Character Training", which allows players to expend a PLEX (see [[#Accounts and subscriptions|accounts and subscriptions]]) in order to allow that account to train a second character for 30 days, equivalent to paying for a 30-day subscription on another account to train a single character.&lt;ref name="eve_dual_charactertraining"&gt;{{cite web|author=CCP Quant|title=Dual Character Training|publisher=CCP Games|date=May 15, 2013|url=http://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/dual-character-training/|accessdate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Odyssey 1.2 introduced the more generalized "Multiple Character Training" which allows players to expend yet another PLEX to activate this feature for a third character on the account.&lt;ref name="eve_multi_charactertraining"&gt;{{cite web|author=CCP Xhagen|title=Multiple Character Training|publisher=CCP Games|date=October 18, 2013|url=http://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/multiple-character-training/|accessdate=November 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economy===
The [[virtual economy|in-game economy]] in ''Eve Online'' is an [[open economy]] that is largely player-driven. [[Non-player character]] (NPC) merchants sell skill books used by players to learn new skills and [[blueprint]]s to manufacture ships and [[modules]]. NPC merchants also buy and sell Trade Goods. Some Trade Goods are only for trade between NPC merchants while others have a functional use and are not good for trade with NPCs. The characters themselves gather the necessary raw materials to manufacture almost all of the ships and ship modules in the game. NPC ships can be looted and salvaged for items and materials. Non-player created ships and equipment may be purchased from various NPC factions as a character gains status with them, and can be resold in the in-game economy. The in-game currency is ISK (Interstellar Kredits), which is also the [[ISO 4217|currency code]] of the [[Icelandic króna]], the real-world currency of Iceland, where the ''Eve Online'' development studio is located.

The amount of money or materials in the universe is not fixed and, as such, the economy operates under [[supply and demand]]. [[Market manipulation]] is possible on a large scale, particular examples being [[ramping]] and [[bear raid]]s. CCP does not issue refunds on in-game purchases. Hence, there is always the risk of certain types of [[confidence trick]]s or other scams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.eveonline.com/pnp/reimbursment.asp|title=Clause 8 of the Rules &amp; Policies published by CCP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economy is balanced by the automatic introduction of extra materials in underpopulated areas. This encourages a more even spread of players.&lt;ref name="vern_hilmarpeturson_evecurrency"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://virtual-economy.org/blog/interview_with_ccp_eve_currenc |title=Virtual Economy Research Network: Interview with Hilmar Pétursson and Magnús Bergsson |accessdate=January 15, 2008 |date=October 2, 2006 |first=Vili |last=Lehdonvirta |publisher=virtual-economy.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080131102331/http://virtual-economy.org/blog/interview_with_ccp_eve_currenc |archivedate=January 31, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game provides support for the trading of in-game resources, including graphs of item price history, with [[Donchian channel|Donchian Channel]] and daily average price. Some player characters operate primarily as traders, generating profits through buying, selling, and transporting goods. Others operate primarily as producers, obtaining components or raw materials and transforming them, sometimes on massive scales, into useful items such as weapons, ships, ammunition, items, or various technologies in demand by other players. Some less combat-oriented players operate as miners or salvagers, collecting and processing ores used in manufacturing or collecting salvage materials to make into items, respectively. Finally, some characters operate as mercenaries or pirates, being paid primarily to be battle-ready and either to attack or defend other profitable enterprises.

Unlike some games such as ''[[Second Life]]'', in-game currency is not freely convertible with real world currency. Players may only buy specific in-game items (such as the Pilot License Extension (PLEX), a token worth 30 days of game time) from CCP with real-world currency. The player can then sell the items on the in-game market for ISK (game currency). The reverse process, selling in-game currency or items for real-world money, is prohibited.&lt;ref name="suspension_ban_policy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveonline.com/pnp/banning.asp|title=EVE Online Suspension and Ban Policy|accessdate=February 20, 2011|publisher=ccpgames.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developers' reasoning for this policy, as related by a CCP representative at Fanfest 2010, is that free interchange of currency causes in-game banking to fall under the same regulatory domain as real-world banking. CCP would rather not place this restriction on in-game behavior, due both to the difficulty of regulatory enforcement and the desire to allow players to create illegitimate in-game banks or [[Ponzi schemes]] if they wish to do so.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Commentators have attempted to estimate the value of ''Eve Online'' entities in real-world currency based on the current value of PLEX. One such conversion valued a fleet-ready titan (the most powerful ship in the game) at [[US$]]7,600,&lt;ref name="Jostiq-cost"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://massively.joystiq.com/2010/02/08/diagram-shows-real-world-cost-of-losing-ships-in-eve-online/ | title=Diagram shows real-world cost of losing ships in EVE Online | date=February 8, 2010 | accessdate=January 31, 2013 | author=Drain, Brendan}}&lt;/ref&gt; though estimates vary. Generally, no player expends such amounts of real-world currency to acquire such sums of in-game wealth, opting instead to do activities in-game that net high amounts of profit.

In 2007, CCP was the first game developer to hire an economist, Eyjólfur Guðmundsson, to oversee ''Eve''{{'}}s in-game economy. Guðmundsson was previously dean of the faculty of business and science at the University of Akureyri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-04-18/multiplayer-game-eve-online-cultivates-a-most-devoted-following |title=Multiplayer Game 'Eve Online' Cultivates a Most Devoted Following |publisher=Businessweek |date=April 18, 2013 |accessdate=July 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eyjólfur Guðmundsson would leave CCP in 2014 to the position of [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] at the [[University of Akureyri]] in July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mbl.is/frettir/innlent/2014/05/19/eyjolfur_naesti_rektor_ha/ |title=Eyjólfur next Rector HA |publisher=Morgunblaðið |date=May 19, 2014 |accessdate=January 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Griefing===
&lt;!--{{quote|text=DON'T TRUST ANYONE |sign=CCP Games |source=EVE Community Knowledge Base, Scams and exploits, Tips}}--&gt;

Due to the game's focus on freedom, consequence, and autonomy, many behaviours that are considered [[griefing]] in most MMOs are allowed in ''Eve''. This includes stealing from other players, extortion, and causing other players to be killed by large groups of NPCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://community.eveonline.com/support/knowledge-base/article.aspx?articleId=34 |title=Scams and exploits |author=[[CCP Games]] |publisher=eveonline.com |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131122112420/http://community.eveonline.com/support/knowledge-base/article.aspx?articleId=34 |archivedate=November 22, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only malicious, prolonged and concentrated harassment where no material gain is involved and a few other actions are considered to be illicit griefing by the game's developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://community.eveonline.com/support/knowledge-base/article.aspx?articleId=336 |title=Grief play |author=[[CCP Games]] |publisher=eveonline.com |date=July 20, 2010 |accessdate=February 23, 2018 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304092931/http://community.eveonline.com/support/knowledge-base/article.aspx?articleId=336 |archivedate=March 4, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Escaping retribution by CONCORD, the NPC space police force that punishes criminal activity in higher security solar systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/CONCORD |title=CONCORD |author=EVE University |publisher=eveuniversity.org |accessdate=February 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for criminal actions is also forbidden, as CONCORD is intentionally designed by game mechanics to be unstoppable.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Ships==
{{Very long|section|date=January 2013}}
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}

Ships in ''Eve Online'' are organized into classes, from tiny frigates only a few dozen meters long to gigantic capital ships up to 17 kilometers long (as large as whole cities). Ships fill different roles and vary in size, speed, hull strength and firepower; smaller ships are generally faster and capable of disabling their targets but lack the damage output necessary to destroy larger ships, while capital ships do very high amounts of damage but have difficulty in striking smaller, mobile targets. Each of the four races has their own unique ship design preferences and varied strengths and weaknesses, although all races have ships that are meant for the same basic roles and are balanced for play against each other. This means that there is no "best ship" in ''Eve Online''. According to their preferred style of play, the player might want their characters to fly a ship with a huge cargo hold, one that is suited for mining, one that has a powerful array of weapons, or a ship that moves quickly through space; but the fluid, ever-changing nature of ''Eve Online'' means that no ship will be perfect at all of these tasks, nor is there any guarantee that the "best ship for the job" today will continue to be the best ship tomorrow.

Furthermore, unlike many online games, ''Eve'' does not feature racial bonuses; that is, characters of different races do not gain intrinsic advantages for flying ships designed by their own race. While a character will begin with more advanced skills in his own race's ships, a character of another race can reach the same proficiency through training. Thus, players are encouraged to use starships that meet their preferred style of play, and the game does not place incentives for playing as one race over another. However, the ships of different races receive unique bonuses to certain things.

Ships in ''Eve Online'' come in four size classes. Small starships include frigates (small, mobile ships good for disruption and harassment) and destroyers (slightly larger and more offensively oriented than frigates). Medium starships include cruisers (multipurpose ships with many possible roles) and battlecruisers (heavier, more combat-oriented cruisers). Battleships (heavily armed and armoured dedicated combat ships) make up the large size class. Extra-large (or capital-class) starships include carriers (offensive oriented ships that can launch wings of fighters to attack targets at extreme range), dreadnoughts (dedicated siege ships for attacking structures and other capitals), force auxiliary ships (dedicated support ships exceptional at repairing other ships), supercarriers (larger versions of carriers focused more on damage to capital class ships and powerful fleet disruption capabilities) and titans (supermassive mobile battle stations, capable of equipping doomsday devices which do massive amounts of damage to other capital ships, or have other powerful battle-affecting capabilities).

[[File:EVE Online - Gallente Frigate.jpg|300px|thumb|right|A destroyer-class ship leaving a station]]

Each spaceship within the ''Eve Online'' universe has a different set of characteristics and can be fitted with different combinations of modules subject to their fitting requirements. Ships have a wide variety of characteristics, including power grid, CPU, capacitor size and recharge rate, energy shields, armor, maximum velocity, agility, locking range and maximum number of lockable targets.  A ship's systems also receive bonuses depending on the level of various skills of the ship's pilot. These bonuses usually correspond to the role the ship has been designed for, and thus vary widely. For instance, the Caldari "Caracal" cruiser has a bonus to the rate of fire of certain missile launcher types, while the Gallente "Vexor" cruiser has a bonus to the damage and hitpoints of certain types of combat drones.

One important characteristic of a ship is the slots it has available for modules. Slots and modules come in three variants: high-, mid-, and low-power. Examples of high slot modules include weapons such as [[Gun turret|turrets]] and [[missile launchers]], [[cloaking devices]], [[tractor beam]]s, and other tools for mining and salvaging. Mid slot items include modules to improve shields or propulsion, repair [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] damage, engage in [[electronic warfare]], and "tackle" other ships to slow or stop movement and prevent escape.  Low slot items include armor enhancements and repair, increased cargo space, and improved speed, agility, computers, or power supply. Different-sized ships have different numbers and ratios of module slots.

A ship may also have 2-3 slots for rigs, modules that require no power grid or CPU, but instead require a ship resource called calibration. Installing a rig is a semi-permanent action, as a rig cannot be removed from the ship without being destroyed. Rigs come in four sizes: small, medium, large, and capital which roughly correspond to the size of the ship, and are used to affect other aspects of the ship such as maximum speed or cargo capacity, or to augment the capabilities of other modules installed in the ship. Most rigs also incur a penalty to certain aspect of the ship; for example, armor rigs reduce the maximum velocity of the ship.

All ships in the game are also classed according to ''Tech level'', from Tech I to Tech III. Tech I (or T1) ships are general purpose, easily manufactured models that perform simple, straightforward functions in an obvious way; faction ships, which are usually very expensive and very good at their intended tasks, are also T1. Tech II (T2) ships are based on T1 designs that have been modified to perform specific roles using specialized technology. T2 ships are harder to manufacture and are only produced by certain corporations, and are priced well above the T1 variants. They also require significantly greater skills to fly than their T1 variants.

The Apocrypha patch introduced into ''Eve Online'' a new type of ship: the Tech III (T3) strategic cruiser. These highly advanced starships gain their unique qualities by being manufactured from material recovered from beyond [[wormhole]]s, another new feature introduced by Apocrypha. Strategic cruisers are rare and expensive, and require unique skillsets on the part of manufacturers that allow the reverse engineering and integration of highly advanced technologies recovered from dead or dormant ancient civilizations. They differ from other ships in that they are modular. Players start with a hull and then add four subsystems to it, the choice of which can dramatically change the ship's character, giving it a different layout of module slots, different preferred weapon systems, and abilities such as being able to fit covert cloaks or ignore some warp disruption effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CCP |url=https://community.eveonline.com/news/patch-notes/patch-notes-for-apocrypha-1 |title=Patch Notes for Apocrypha |publisher=EVE Community |date=October 3, 2009 |accessdate=October 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Rhea, Aegis, Tiamat, and Carnyx patches introduced four new Tech III tactical destroyers.  While these lack the modular nature of their strategic cruiser big brothers, they can dynamically swap between three "modes", augmenting their offensive, defensive, or propulsion capabilities, respectively, as needed by the pilot, even in the midst of combat.  This gives these tactical destroyers substantially superior offensive, defensive, or evasive capabilities compared to other lower-tech destroyers, though they can only focus on one of the three capabilities at a time.

==Players and communities==
Players have several interaction options when playing ''Eve Online''. Every activity is possible for solo players but larger and more complicated tasks become more feasible for groups, such as pirate clans or corporations.

===Corporations and alliances===
Players can organize themselves into corporations (similar to [[Clan (computer gaming)|guilds or clans]] in other MMOs). Corporations are run by one chief executive officer (CEO) who controls the corporation's assets. The CEO assigns roles to corporation members such as director, accountant and personnel manager. Corporations may also band together to form alliances. Corporations and alliances come in different shapes and sizes. Some player groups write press releases about new business openings and send out [[Initial public offering|IPO]] information to potential in-game venture capital investors. Alliances can control enough star systems that their territory can be plotted on the ''Eve Online'' game map.&lt;ref name="eve_map_territorial_control"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dl.eve-files.com/media/corp/Verite/influence.png |title=Eve Online territorial control map (regularly updated) |accessdate=October 15, 2008 |author="Verite Rendition" }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alliances based in lawless space often form unofficial political power blocs with other alliances. These power blocs are typically referred to as "coalitions". Unlike formally established alliances, coalitions are similar in nature to Japanese ''[[keiretsu]]''{{snd}} an informal 'business arrangement' in which several corporations band together to provide mutual financial, military and/or industrial support.

Corporations take up numerous business models such as mining, manufacturing or "ratting" (hunting NPC pirates for their bounties and loot). Corporations can levy income taxes on their members, which skim off a percentage of every member's earnings. Many corporations offer a variety of benefits to their members, such as free or discounted ships, equipment, formal training, and organized corporate group operations.

Among the many activities that corporations can organize is piracy. Actions considered piracy generally involve breaking the in-game law, and can come in a variety of forms. Pirates may [[camping (computer gaming)|camp]] stargates waiting for other players to arrive, attack players operating in asteroid belts or hunt for players carrying out an NPC agent-assigned mission. Because these activities are considered to be "illegal" within the game mechanics, pirate characters often will have [[Gameplay of Eve Online#Security status system|low security status]] and may even be branded as outlaws by CONCORD. Likewise, victims of overt piracy may retaliate without intervention from CONCORD, often via an expressed right to destroy the pirate ship (i.e., "kill right"). Although piracy activities are "illegal" within the game universe, they are not against the rules of the game, i.e., there will only be in-game retaliation and punishment for them.

Illegally attacking another player in secure space will result in a loss of security standing; CONCORD, the interstellar NPC police, will arrive shortly to destroy the aggressor's ship. There are, however, legal ways to attack other players in high-security space.

Whole corporations and whole alliances can officially declare war on (or "war-dec") other corporations or alliances for a weekly fee, permitting all members of the involved corporations or alliances to attack each other without loss of security status or the intervention of CONCORD.&lt;ref name="EveKBCorporationWars"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.eveonline.com/Pages/KB/Article.aspx?id=163 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20110810035650/https://support.eveonline.com/Pages/KB/Article.aspx?id=163 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 10, 2011 |title=Eve Online Support: Corporation Wars |accessdate=January 15, 2008 |author=CCP Games |publisher=eveonline.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The weekly fee can be eliminated if the war declaration is reciprocated. War declarations will clearly flag a player's enemies, so the player can determine who can legally attack and be attacked.

===Demographics===
: N.B.: Demographic data for this game has ''not'' been collected uniformly or regularly.
In March 2006, CCP made a deal with [[Optic Communications]] to start working on bringing ''Eve Online'' to the Chinese gaming audience. Closed [[alpha testing]] was held on a small cluster for some time, with about 3,000 players chosen from an initial pool of 50,000.&lt;ref name="devblog_biginchina"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/big-in-china/ |title=Big in China |accessdate=December 15, 2014|date=April 11, 2006|author=LeKjart|publisher=eveonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese open beta test began on June 13, 2006, and proved to be very popular, gaining numbers comparable to ''Eve Online'''s main server cluster.&lt;ref name="GamingHorizonBetaLaunch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebump.com/go/eve_online_chinese_beta_launches |title=Article "Eve Online Chinese Beta Launches" |accessdate=January 15, 2008 |date=June 15, 2006 |author=The Gaming Horizon Archive |work=gamebump.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221011135/http://www.gamebump.com/go/eve_online_chinese_beta_launches |archivedate=December 21, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avoid the shock of quickly adding thousands of new players to the current server (Tranquility), CCP Games decided to launch ''Eve'' in China on its own server (Serenity).&lt;ref name="devblog_biginchina" /&gt; In 2011, CCP allowed its licensing agreement with [[CDC Games]], which had acquired Optic in July 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20080124005466/en/CDC-Games-Announces-Promotion-John-Huen-Chief |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=CDC Games Announces Promotion of John Huen to Chief Operating Officer |newspaper=[[Business Wire]] |location=Beijing |date=January 24, 2008 |accessdate=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to expire. CCP created a new partnership with [[TianCity]] to relaunch Serenity on December 11, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=CCP Loktofeit |date=December 11, 2012 |title=CCP Games and TianCity Relaunch EVE Online in China |url=http://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/press-releases/ccp-games-and-tiancity-relaunch-eve-online-in-china/ |publisher=eveonline.com |location=Reykjavik, Iceland |accessdate=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The code base between Serenity (serving China) and Tranquility (serving the rest of the world) is synchronised, so that feature development is distributed to both server clusters, although the game worlds are not connected. ''Eve Online'' fully supports [[Unicode]] and has a back-end system to enable localization of each and every aspect of the game's content and UI.&lt;ref name="TenTonHammerFanFestCoverage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eve.tentonhammer.com/index.php?module=ContentExpress&amp;func=display&amp;ceid=21&amp;meid=39 |title=TenTonHammer: Day Three – 'The 5th Horseman' with Oveur, Hellmar's Keynote |accessdate=January 15, 2008 |date=November 20, 2006 |work=eve.tentonhammer.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821063308/http://eve.tentonhammer.com/index.php?module=ContentExpress&amp;func=display&amp;ceid=21&amp;meid=39 |archivedate=August 21, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 7, 2011, CCP announced that it planned to partner with [[Nexon Co. Ltd.]] to bring a "fully localized game client and product services for CCP's award winning... EVE Online" to Japan in the fall. Localized services for Japanese players would enable them to access the game in their native language through the Tranquility server, which currently hosts over 350,000 subscribers from around the world in three languages: English, German and Russian.&lt;ref name="CCP Press Release"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveonline.com/pressreleases/default.asp?pressReleaseID=72 |title=CCP and Nexon Announce Strategic Partnership for EVE Online in Japan |accessdate=August 22, 2011 |date=July 7, 2011 |work=eveonline.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810190256/http://www.eveonline.com/pressreleases/default.asp?pressReleaseID=72 |archivedate=August 10, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 5, 2013, ''Eve Online'' claimed a new record for the maximum number of simultaneous pilots online with 65,303 concurrent accounts logged on to the same server at the same time. This record was set on the eve of ''Eve Online'' 10 year birthday and topped the previous record of 63,170 set January 23, 2011. ''Eve Online'' typically experiences the highest number of users on Sundays and the peak player records have almost exclusively been broken on Sundays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;m=2979625#post2979625|title=[UPDATE - SUCCESS NEW PCU RECORD (65,303)] - PCU Record Attempt and EVE Birthday Celebration

This was once again broadcast via live streaming video by Eve TV&lt;ref name="evetv" /&gt; The tournament saw 40 Alliances&lt;ref name="AllianceContestants"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dl.eve-files.com/media/corp/lemonde/contestants.JPG|title=3rd alliance tournament contestant list|accessdate=January 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; pitting five-man teams against each other. Once again, the Band of Brothers&lt;ref name="band_of_brothers" /&gt; alliance emerged as the winner. Of particular note in this tournament was the fielding of an Imperial Apocalypse by the Interstellar Alcohol Conglomerate. The ship was destroyed in the semi-finals of the tournament by the COW (Cult of War) team. A last-minute attempt to arrange an 8&amp;nbsp;billion ISK ransom for the ship fell through.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Volunteer program===
The Interstellar Services Department (ISD) is a group of volunteers, made up of subscribed players, who assist in a variety of tasks like answering questions from players, bug hunting and QA testing, covering player-driven news,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/05/20/new-edens-virtual-reporters/ |author=James Egan |title=New Eden's virtual reporters |newspaper=Joystiq |publisher=Massively |date=May 20, 2008 |accessdate=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and writing game fiction. It includes ECAID (Equipment Certification and Anomaly Investigations Division), STAR (Support, Training and Resources), IC (Interstellar Correspondents), M (Mercury), CCL (Community Communication Liaisons), and YARR (Yulai Archives &amp; Records Repository Team).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://community.eveonline.com/community/volunteer-program/ |title=Volunteer Program - EVE Community |accessdate=September 8, 2015 |author=CCP Games |publisher=eveonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
According to the developers, ''Eve Online'' evolved from the classic computer game ''[[Elite (video game)|Elite]]'', which itself was based on concepts from the science-fiction role-playing game ''[[Traveller (role-playing game)|Traveller]]''. ''Eve'' combined concepts from ''Elite'' with the multi player chat and player-versus-player aspects of ''[[Ultima Online]]''.&lt;ref name="Evolution and Risk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20050923/rossignol_01.shtml|title=Evolution and Risk: CCP on the Freedoms of Eve Online|accessdate=September 13, 2007|last=Rosignol|first=Jim|date=September 23, 2005|publisher=Gamasutra}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Elite'' had four single-player aspects of missions,&lt;ref name="Ian's FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iancgbell.clara.net/elite/faq.htm#A5|title=Elite FAQ|accessdate=September 13, 2007|last=Bell|first=Ian|date=Autumn 1999|publisher=Ian Bell}}&lt;/ref&gt; mining, trade routes and combat with random hostile NPC's&lt;ref name="Elite Manual"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iancgbell.clara.net/elite/manual.htm|title=Space Traders Flight Training Manual|accessdate=September 13, 2007|last=Holdstock|first=Rob|year=1984|publisher=Acorn}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which are aspects of the first incarnations of ''Eve Online''.&lt;ref name="eaves outs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=89181|title= Eve Online 'eaves out some shots|accessdate=September 13, 2007|last=Bishop|first=Stuart|date=March 27, 2003|publisher=CVG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the original developers of ''Elite'', [[David Braben]], believes ''Eve Online'' is a reimplementation of the 1980s game, not its true successor.&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A: David Braben"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6162140.html?part=rss&amp;tag=gs_news&amp;subj=6162140|title=Q&amp;A: David Braben—from Elite to today|accessdate=September 13, 2007|last=Boyes|first=Emma|date=November 27, 2006|publisher=GameSpot News(CNET)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the developers (John Cameron, James Cassidy, Joe Chaney) also believe that this game creates a world where players can become someone else only possible in their imaginations.

Both the server and the client software for ''Eve Online'' are developed in [[Stackless Python]], a variant of the [[Python programming language]]. Stackless Python allows a relatively large number of players to perform tasks without the overhead of using the [[call stack]] used in the standard Python distribution. This frees the game developers from performing some routine work and allows them to apply changes to the game universe without resetting the server.&lt;ref name="eve_online_faq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveonline.com/faq/faq_07.asp |title=EVE ONLINE F.A.Q. |accessdate=August 5, 2008 |publisher=[[CCP Games|CCP hf]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222195343/http://www.eveonline.com/faq/faq_07.asp |archivedate=February 22, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Eve cluster is taken offline daily for database and server maintenance.&lt;ref name="daily_downtime"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;bid=817|title=Death to Downtimes!|accessdate=August 24, 2011|date=October 29, 2010|publisher=[[CCP Hunter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compatibility===
On March 14, 2006, the ''Eve Online'' development team announced that they would be upgrading the graphics engine of ''Eve Online'' to a [[DirectX]] 10 / [[Windows Vista]] graphics platform.&lt;ref name="devblog_graphics_vista"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;bid=323|title=Dev blog "A Little Thing Called Vista ..."|accessdate=January 15, 2008|date=April 14, 2006|author=Redundancy|publisher=eveonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revelations patch 1.4 had patch notes quoted as saying that the current ''Eve Online'' client should work in Vista "as well as it does in XP."&lt;ref name="patchnotes_xp_vista"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveonline.com/updates/patchnotes.asp?patchlogID=127|title=Patch notes for Revelations patch 1.4|accessdate=January 15, 2008|author=CCP Games|publisher=eveonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 10, 2007, [[CCP Games]] announced that the new ''Trinity 2'' graphics engine will be using DirectX 9.0.&lt;ref name="devblog501"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;bid=501|title=Dev blog "That November Expansion Of Ours"|accessdate=January 15, 2008|date=September 10, 2007|author=CCP Oveur|publisher=eveonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was released on December 5, 2007.&lt;ref name="EvePressRelease38"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveonline.com/pressreleases/default.asp?pressReleaseID=38 |title=Eve Online Press Release – 11/28/07 |accessdate=November 29, 2007 |author=CCP Games |date=December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417011608/http://www.eveonline.com/pressreleases/default.asp?pressReleaseID=38 |archivedate=April 17, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Official support for [[Linux]] and [[Macintosh|Mac]] platforms, using [[Transgaming Technologies]] [[Cedega (software)|Cedega]] and [[TransGaming Technologies|Cider]] ([[Fork (software)|forks]] of [[Wine (software)|Wine]]) for Linux and Mac compatibility, was introduced with the Revelations 2.3 patch released on November 6, 2007.&lt;ref name="Revelations23MacLinuxSupport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&amp;nid=1629&amp;tid=1&amp;sid=539642555 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625075136/https://www.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&amp;nid=1629&amp;tid=1&amp;sid=539642555 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 25, 2018 |title=revelations 2.3 with mac and linux support now in public testing on multiplicity |accessdate=November 3, 2007 |author=CCP kieron |date=November 3, 2007 |work=eveonline.com |publisher=[[CCP Games]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EscapistLinuxAndMacCompatability"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/78605-New-EVE-Online-Client-Offers-Official-Linux-and-OS-X-Support|title=New Eve Online Client Offers Official Linux and OS X Support|accessdate=November 5, 2007|author=Andy Chalk|date=November 5, 2007|work=The Escapist News |publisher=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Fanfest 2008 Transgaming announced and demonstrated that the Premium graphics client is now running on Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard. In February 2009 CCP announced that they planned to discontinue the official Linux client with the next major patch,&lt;ref name="devblog_625"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;bid=625|title=an update on linux support|accessdate=February 11, 2009|author=CCP Games|publisher=eveonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and advised on using third-party programs to run the Windows version of the client under Linux (namely [[Wine (software)|Wine]]).&lt;ref name="eve_kb_499"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.eveonline.com/Pages/KB/Article.aspx?id=499 |title=How to run EVE Online under Linux |accessdate=February 11, 2009 |author=CCP Games |publisher=eveonline.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009014838/http://support.eveonline.com/Pages/KB/Article.aspx?id=499 |archivedate=October 9, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.winehq.org/AppsThatSupportWine |title=AppsThatSupportWine – The Official Wine Wiki |publisher=Wiki.winehq.org |date=August 8, 2010 |accessdate=April 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603231747/http://wiki.winehq.org/AppsThatSupportWine |archivedate=June 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The discontinuation of the official Linux client was primarily because the game ran better using the Windows client via Wine than it did with the official one, as a result many Linux users were already using Wine instead.

===Third-party applications and the Eve API Project===
Third-party applications supplement players' ''Eve Online'' experience. Some of these, such as automated applications designed to claim publicly available contracts accidentally put up without an associated cost, can result in a ban if discovered,{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} while others are endorsed, tacitly or explicitly, by CCP. EVEMon, a [[.NET Framework|.NET]] application that monitors and forecasts skill training times, is one example of an explicitly authorized external application.&lt;ref name="EveMonBattleClinic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://evemon.battleclinic.com/|title=EveMon – Main Page|accessdate=January 15, 2008|first=Timothy|last=Fries}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DevUsingEVEMon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&amp;threadID=513772&amp;page=1#9|title=Eve Online Forums: CCP Employee Using EveMon|accessdate=January 15, 2008|date=April 30, 2007|author=CCP kieron|publisher=eveonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another such application, Eve Fitting Tool or EFT, allows players to try different ship setups and see how certain skills and modules will affect that ship.&lt;ref name="eft_announcement_topic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&amp;threadID=548883&amp;page=1|title=Eve Fitting Tool v2.9.1 – Quantum Rise|accessdate=February 23, 2009|author=Gripen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third-party applications to monitor character information and skill training exist for both the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iPhone]] mobile platforms.&lt;ref name="CapsuleerForIphone"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/app/capsuleer-for-eve-online/id291118202?mt=8|title=Capsuleer (For EVE Online) for iPhone, iPod touch and iPad|accessdate=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AuraForAndroid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.androlib.com/android.application.com-aideronrobotics-android-aura-AEz.aspx|title=Aura for EVE Online v0.7.2 Application for Android|accessdate=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, CCP announced the Eve API Project; third-party utilities such as EVEMon now interface with character data, market, and other data through an [[Application programming interface|API]].&lt;ref name="devblog467"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;bid=467|title=Dev blog "The Eve API Project"|accessdate=January 15, 2008|date=May 15, 2007|author=CCP Garthagk|publisher=eveonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eleventh expansion of ''Eve Online'', "Apocrypha," was released on March 10, 2009, and introduced features such as further graphics updates as started in the [[Expansions of Eve Online#Trinity|Trinity]] expansion; the ability for players to group their vessels' weapons for easier interaction;&lt;ref name="eve_quantum_rise_weapongrouping"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;bid=596 |title=Dev blog "Weapon Grouping" |accessdate=November 1, 2008 |author=CCP Ytterbium |date=October 23, 2008 |publisher=[[CCP Games|CCP hf]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; changes to autopilot routes and avoidance of player-defined star systems.&lt;ref name="eve_quantum_rise_features"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/press-releases/eve-online-quantum-rise-multiplies-mmo-power-1/ |title=Press release "EVE Online: Quantum Rise Multiplies MMO Power" |accessdate=December 15, 2014 |date=October 15, 2008 |author=[[CCP Games|CCP hf]] |publisher=eveonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The twelfth expansion, "Dominion," was released on December 1, 2009, and overhauled the sovereignty system,&lt;ref name="Dominion Expansion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveonline.com/expansions/dominion |title=Eve Online Dominion |accessdate=May 7, 2014 |author=CCP Games |publisher=eveonline.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508031051/http://www.eveonline.com/expansions/dominion |archivedate=May 8, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the thirteenth expansion, "Tyrannis," released on May 26, 2010, added planetary interaction as well as the online platform "EVE Gate".&lt;ref name="Tyrannis Expansion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveonline.com/expansions/tyrannis |title=Eve Online Tyrannis |accessdate=May 7, 2014 |author=CCP Games |publisher=eveonline.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508042708/http://www.eveonline.com/expansions/tyrannis |archivedate=May 8, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, expansions have added features such as conquerable and constructible space stations, massive capital ships, advanced versions of existing ships, or ''Epic Arcs'' for players to master. Apocrypha included an overhauled probing system, wormholes, a smarter and tougher AI and customizable Tech 3 ships as its major features.&lt;ref name="eve_apocrypha_press_release"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/press-releases/eve-online-apocrypha-uncovers-a-new-version-of-the-universe-itself-1/ |title=Press release "EVE Online: Apocrypha Uncovers a New Version of the Universe Itself" |date=January 8, 2009 |accessdate=December 15, 2014 |author=CCP Games |publisher=eveonline.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominion, which became available for download on December 1, 2009, included an overhaul of the sovereignty system, more realistic astronomy, the Titan Doomsday weapon functionality being changed and the in-game web browser with Chromium's WebKit. It also included a redesign of the UI and in-game mailing system. Tyrannis added new features, such as the ability to exploit planetary resources, a social networking program called EVE Gate, new technology for ships, and graphical updates.

====Rapid release cycle====
On May 6, 2014 at their yearly Fanfest convention, CCP announced the move from the current development cycle of two expansions per year, to ten feature-releases per year on a rapid release cycle. Senior Producer of EVE Online Andie Nordgren (CCP Seagull) stated that the move was to necessary for future developments to have a more flexible release cycle, rather than the deadline imposed on the previous system, allowing smaller patches and changes to be deployed more rapidly and large projects not having to be rushed due to the expansion deadline.&lt;ref name="2014 EVE Keynote"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k07Uu7qUEa0 |title=Fanfest 2014 - EVE Online Keynote |accessdate=May 7, 2014 |date=May 6, 2014 |author=CCP Games |publisher=youtube.com  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A New Frontier: EVE Online Doing Away With Expansions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/05/05/eve-online-update-schedule/ |title=A New Frontier: EVE Online Doing Away With Expansions |accessdate=May 7, 2014 |date=May 5, 2014 |author=Nathan Grayson |publisher=rockpapershotgun.com  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in September 2015, Nordgren announced that CCP, while continuing with a five-week release cycle, would return to intermittently releasing large scale expansions for ''EVE''.  She described the new release cycle as a "hybrid form", where expansions would be "a set of big, connected features" with no fixed number per year, while the feature-releases would continue to bring "quality of life changes, ship balance changes, visual upgrades" and other smaller additions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/looking-behind-and-looking-ahead-an-update-from-executive-producer-ccp-seagull/ |title=Looking behind and looking ahead - an update from EVE Executive Producer CCP Seagull |accessdate=December 13, 2015 |date=September 17, 2015 |author=CCP Seagull |publisher=eveonline.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first new expansion, announced at EVE Vegas 2015, will introduce a new modular starbase called a Citadel, and will overhaul capital-class ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://massivelyop.com/2015/10/24/eve-vegas-2015-citadel-expansion-details-revealed/ |title=EVE Vegas 2015: Citadel expansion details revealed |accessdate=December 13, 2015 |date=October 24, 2015 |author=Brendan Drain |publisher=Massively OP }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its release date is set for spring of 2016.

===Planned future developments===
The developers have been working on a game feature to allow players to exit pods and interact with other player avatars in the communal setting of a station interior.&lt;ref name="devblog401"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;bid=401 |title=Dev blog "Walking in Stations" |accessdate=January 15, 2008 |date=November 17, 2006 |author=t0rfiFrans |publisher=eveonline.com  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first iteration, called Captain’s Quarters, was released on June 21, 2011.&lt;ref name=devblog914&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;bid=914 |title=Dev blog "Incarna. Welcome your future." |accessdate=May 30, 2011 |date=May 25, 2011 |author=CCP Zulu |publisher=eveonline.com  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second iteration, with stylised quarters for each race, was released with the Crucible expansion.&lt;ref name="devblog947"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;bid=947 |title=Dev blog "Summer and Incarna 1.1" |accessdate=August 24, 2011 |date=August 19, 2011 |author=CCP Fallout |publisher=eveonline.com  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Player interaction in station environments has not yet been announced and only preliminary details have emerged.

The ability to enter a planet's atmosphere and to interact with its surface is mentioned as one of the future development plans. The "Future Vision" trailer portrays Dreadnaught-class ships performing planetary orbital bombardments on Dust battlefields. The first glimpse trailer of Dust 514 ended with a ship exploding in the atmosphere.  However, the interaction between Dust and Eve has not been fully defined and no official confirmation has yet been provided.  At Eve Fanfest 2005, a working prototype was demonstrated in which a Caldari Crow interceptor could be seen navigating a makeshift landscape superimposed on a nebula.  However, this effort was later abandoned.  CCP has stated that full-scale integration of such features requires an enormous effort and is only planned for post-Revelations ([[Expansions of Eve Online|expansion]]) production phases, 2006.&lt;ref name="devblog282"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;bid=282 |title=Dev blog "YARRBQ – My Fanfest Experience, Red Moon Rising, Kali and China" |accessdate=January 15, 2008 |date=October 23, 2005 |author=Oveur |publisher=eveonline.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, it was stated that, until a proven in-game reason is found for planetary access, further work on this feature will not have a high priority.

====Dust 514====
{{Main|Dust 514}}
During the 2009 [[Games Convention]] in [[Cologne]], Germany, CCP unveiled ''[[Dust 514]]'', a console-based [[MMOFPS]] title meant to integrate with the ''Eve Online'' universe. According to developers, players hired by ''Eve Online'' alliances would fight over planets.&lt;ref name="eve_at6_day6_preflight14"&gt;{{cite video |people=CCP Soundwave, Noah Ward, KIAEddZ, Verone (commentators) |date=February 13, 2009 |title=Eve Online – AT6 Day 6 Finals – Studio pre fight 14 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlF31FpmMX4 |format=FLV |medium=Video commentary |publisher=CCP Games |location=Reykjavík, Iceland |accessdate=March 4, 2009 |time=11min 54s }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Eve Online'' Creative Director Torfi Frans Ólafsson, at the recent Eve Online Fanfest, the Dominion release is planned to involve sovereignty, the ownership of districts on planets that are capable of creating industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Torfi Frans (presenter) |date=October 6, 2009 |title=EVE Online Fanfest 2009 – CCP Presents! |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNhPig8inEY |format=FLV |medium=Trailer |publisher=CCP Games |location=Reykjavík, Iceland |accessdate=October 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This player ownership system will be dynamic as it will be subject to PvP diplomacy as well as subjugation. The latter allows for linking with ''Dust 514'', whereby players within ''Eve Online'' will be able to contract, in-game, ''Dust 514'' players to take control of planetary regions within the ''Eve Online'' universe and these 'mercenaries' will then vie with other ''Dust 514'' players hired by the opposing faction. The integration between the console MMOFPS game and the ''Eve Online'' MMORPG is both through community interaction and through the changeable battlefields based on the planetary architecture of a common universe{{snd}} the outcome of these battles in ''Dust 514'' will affect the status and ownership of the corresponding planets in ''Eve Online'' as well. At E3 2011, it was announced that ''Dust 514'' is a PlayStation 3 exclusive with a PS Vita tie-in, both to be released in spring of 2012.

===Source code leak===
On May 20, 2011, leaked ''EVE Online'' [[source code]] was published by someone on a [[GitHub]] repository.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geek.com/games/eve-online-source-code-posted-online-dmca-takedown-quickly-follows-1382821/ |title=Eve Online source code posted online, DMCA takedown quickly follows |first=Matthew |last=Humphries |date=May 25, 2011 |accessdate=November 7, 2015 |publisher=geek.com |quote=It looks as though someone has posted the source code for the space MMO Eve Online there.

The ''Eve Online'' soundtrack was composed by Jón Hallur Haraldsson, also known as Real-X. A digital soundtrack titled ''EVE Online: Original Soundtrack, Vol. 1'' was released on [[iTunes]] on August 12, 2009. The soundtrack comes with an audio book track ''EVE Chronicle – Taught Thoughts''. The soundtrack has since been removed from iTunes.

The game itself contains an extensive in-game soundtrack. On December 4, 2012, the "Retribution" expansion of Eve Online was released. Among its features was the removal of the Jukebox, which enabled players to select their favorite songs to play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eveonline.com/retribution/atmospheric-audio |title=Atmospheric Audio |accessdate=June 24, 2014 |date=December 4, 2012 |publisher=CCP Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; In tandem with this, CCP Games announced that the entire game soundtrack (consisting of music in the game at the time) would be available to download for free from [[SoundCloud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://soundcloud.com/ccpgames/sets/eve-online-in-game-tracks |title=EVE Online - Soundtrack |accessdate=June 24, 2014 |date=December 4, 2012 |publisher=CCP Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soundtrack consists of 74 songs, with a running time of nearly seven hours.

==Public perception==

===Virtual crime===
[[Piracy]] (in the ship-to-ship sense) is part of the game, as is [[protection racket]]eering, theft, and [[ransom]].&lt;ref&gt;

One infamous example was a corporate infiltration and [[wikt:heist|heist]] where one corporation infiltrated a target corporation over the course of nearly a year. They then performed a virtual assassination on the target's CEO and proceeded to steal corporate property to which they had gained access.  The target corporation lost billions of ISK worth of property (amounting to about $16,500 USD) and a great deal of prestige; the CEO's expensive ship and cybernetic implants were destroyed in the attack.&lt;ref name="GHSCAssassination"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=180867&amp;site=pcg |title=Murder Incorporated |accessdate=July 12, 2008 |last=Francis |first=Tom |date=February 29, 2008 |publisher=PC Gamer |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080131073037/http://computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=180867&amp;site=pcg |archivedate=January 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events of this nature are debated both inside the game world and in the media.&lt;ref name="SoftpediaNewsEIBScam"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Eve-Online-Economy-Suffers-700-billion-ISK-Scam-33737.shtml |title=Eve Online Economy Suffers 700&amp;nbsp;billion ISK Scam |accessdate=July 3, 2007 |last=Stefanescu |first=Tudor |date=August 24, 2007 |publisher=Softpedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a player [[#Corporations and alliances|alliance]] known as Goonswarm was contacted by a disgruntled director of rival alliance Band of Brothers, one of the largest alliances in the game at that time. The defecting director then stripped Band of Brothers of a large quantity of assets including ships, money and territory, and disbanded the alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Graham |first=Flora |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7905924.stm |title=The struggle among the stars |publisher=BBC News  |date=February 23, 2009 |accessdate=April 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A player-run bank known as 'EBank' was also involved in controversy in 2009 when Ricdic, the CEO of the bank, withdrew 200 billion ISK and converted it into real world currency to pay for medical expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8132547.stm|title=Billions stolen in online robbery|date=July 3, 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=February 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2009/07/16/ccp-on-the-ebank-scandal|title=CCP on the EBank Scandal|first=Jason|last=Ocampo|website=BBC News|accessdate=February 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such dangers are an inherent part of ''Eve Online'''s virtual economy and thus are purposely not dealt with by the developers.&lt;ref name="faq67spy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveonline.com/faq/faq_06.asp |title=Frequently Asked Questions, section 6.7: Can I be a corporate spy? |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |author=[[CCP Games|CCP hf]] |publisher=[[CCP Games|CCP hf]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222194735/http://www.eveonline.com/faq/faq_06.asp |archivedate=February 22, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Players are expected to make financial decisions based (among other factors) on the possibility of other players' [[fiduciary]] [[malfeasance]], much as in real-life economics.

The most common acts of piracy in Eve are [[Wiktionary:gank|ganking]], gate [[Camping (video gaming)|camping]], and small gang warfare. Every pirate corporation in ''Eve Online'' has its own preferred activities, strategies, and tactics. Some utilize cheap but high damage ships to "suicide gank" and kill players in high-security space (where they should theoretically be safe) quickly before CONCORD law enforcement units arrive to destroy them (thus "suiciding"), in the knowledge that certain ships they destroy will be carrying valuable commodities or expensive gear capable of recovering the cost of the pirate vessels lost in the gank. Others choose to set up gate camping fleets consisting of varied ship types and roles capable of rapidly disabling and destroying any unwitting passersby, thereby locking down star systems and killing or robbing whoever tries to pass through. Other pirates choose to roam in very fast and versatile skirmish ships, such as interceptors, recons, or heavy assault ships, killing anyone they encounter in lightning attacks. On gaining the upper hand in a fight many pirates will ask the victim for an ISK ransom, in exchange for sparing their ship or escape pod.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}&lt;!-- for this whole paragraph --&gt;

Suicide ganking has declined in overall popularity since the release of the ''Crucible'' expansion; while players may opt to insure their ships against loss using in-game currency, pilots will no longer be reimbursed if their ship is destroyed by CONCORD.  Such changes have been the subject of intense debate on the game's official forums, with opinions divided on whether or not players should be truly 'safe' while flying.

===Developer misconduct===
Instances of developer misconduct in ''Eve Online'' have been substantiated, leading to debates and controversy. On February 9, 2007, a player known as [[Anthony Zboralski|Kugutsumen]]{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} hacked an enemy corporation's private forum to find out and reveal that ''Eve Online'' developer t20 had provided his corporation, Reikoku, with six valuable blueprints, giving them an advantage over competing corporations.&lt;ref name="Eve Online"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/on-recent-allegations/ |title=Dev Blog "On recent allegations" |accessdate=February 9, 2007 |date=February 9, 2007 |publisher=eveonline.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some within the ''Eve Online'' community asked for t20's dismissal. While an apology letter was left for the community in the form of a dev blog, he remained an ''Eve Online'' developer until late 2008. Kugutsumen was permanently banned from the ''Eve Online'' universe for violating the game's [[terms of service]] and [[Software license agreement|end-user license agreement]] by revealing t20's real name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/interviews/1233-Jumpgate-EVE-Devs-Update-Another-Chat-with-Kugutsumen  | title=Jumpgate: EVE Devs Update - Another Chat with Kugutsumen |accessdate=February 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to public concerns, CCP decided to set up an internal affairs division whose responsibility is to monitor the activities of both privileged and player accounts operated by CCP staff in-game.&lt;ref name="devblog429"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;bid=429 |title=Dev blog "CCP's director of internal affairs: an introduction" |accessdate=December 4, 2007 |author=CCP Arkanon |date=February 13, 2007 |publisher=[[CCP Games|CCP hf]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In part due to the matters above, CCP invited users to stand for the first Council of Stellar Management (CSM) in March 2008, resulting in 66 candidates seeking election to nine positions.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/07/arts/07eve.html |title=Article "In a Virtual Universe, the Politics Turn Real" |accessdate=January 26, 2008 |first=Seth |last=Schiesel |date=June 7, 2007 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dev_blog_csm_timeline_xhagen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;bid=545 |title=Dev blog "The Council of Stellar Management" |accessdate=June 15, 2008 |author=CCP Xhagen |date=March 18, 2008 |publisher=eveonline.com  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="csm_overview_pdf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveonline.com/download/devblog/CSMSummary.pdf |format=PDF |title=The CSM – A Summary Explanation of the Council of Stellar Management |accessdate=June 15, 2008 |first=Pétur Jóhannes |last=Óskarsson |date=April 18, 2008 |publisher=eveonline.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313011413/http://www.eveonline.com/download/devblog/CSMSummary.pdf |archivedate=March 13, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dev_blog_csm_results_xhagen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;bid=562 |title=Dev blog "Council of Stellar Management: The Results Are in!" |accessdate=June 15, 2008 |author=CCP Xhagen |date=May 21, 2008 |publisher=eveonline.com  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a requirement that candidates release their full real names in addition to stating their in-game details.&lt;ref name="forum_post_xhagen_csm_real_names"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&amp;threadID=729021&amp;page=3#78 |title=Eve Online forum topic "The Council of Stellar Management, new blog by Xhagen" |accessdate=June 15, 2008 |author=CCP Xhagen |date=March 19, 2008 |publisher=eveonline.com  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May, after a two-week voting period, the first Council was elected, comprising seven men and two women; three each from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, two from the USA and one from Denmark, their ages ranging from 17 to 52.&lt;ref name="dev_blog_csm_results_xhagen" /&gt;

The remit of the Council has been changed since it was first proposed and is now seen by CCP primarily as a route for players to make requests for changes and improvements to the game mechanics, presentation, and game content of ''Eve Online''. The first four Councils served for six months, after which new ones were to be elected.&lt;ref name="csm_overview_pdf" /&gt; Each individual was only permitted to serve twice. Each CSM gets the authority to put requests to CCP three times during their term of office which CCP have stated must be answered; once in person in Iceland and twice by e-mail, with most of the costs of their visit to Iceland being borne by CCP.&lt;ref name="csm_overview_pdf" /&gt; The rules were changed for the fifth CSM to feature one-year terms with two Iceland trips and four email requests, as well as the abolition of the two-term limit.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The first meeting of the CSM with CCP took place in Reykjavik between June 19 and 23, 2008, and included not only the nine CSM members but a number of developers, designers, [[Gamemaster|game masters]], and producers from CCP and members of print and video media.&lt;ref name="NYT_on_CSM"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/28/arts/television/28eve.html?ref=arts |title=Face to Face: A Council of online gamers |accessdate=June 28, 2008 |first=Seth |last=Schiesel |date=June 28, 2008 |work=new York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; Matters discussed by players on the ''Eve Online'' forums were reviewed in detail and whilst some were rejected for technical reasons, many were accepted by CCP as useful improvements to the game which would be introduced either in an early so-called point release or added to the development plans for a future major update.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Nominations for the second CSM opened on September 26, 2008, with voting commencing on November 9. The following third Council of Stellar Management included a modified age restriction: candidates under the age of 21 are then no longer eligible as CSM members.&lt;ref name="blog_post_csm_2_starting"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;bid=582 |title=Dev blog "First CSM Term Close to Ending, Warming up for the Second One!" |accessdate=September 26, 2008 |author=CCP Xhagen |date=September 25, 2008 |publisher=eveonline.com  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with the eighth CSM, a [[single transferable vote]] system was introduced, allowing voters to select up to 14 candidates.&lt;ref name="joystiq_csm_8"&gt;"{{Citation

==Accounts and subscriptions==
Users start playing ''Eve Online'' by creating a free account (known as an Alpha account), being invited to the game as via the game's Recruit-A-Friend program, or purchasing the ''Eve Online'' Special Edition retail box.&lt;ref name="eve_specialedition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveonline.com/pressreleases/default.asp?pressReleaseID=53 |title=CCP and Atari Announce Contents of EVE Online Retail Box |accessdate=April 6, 2008 |author=CCP Games |publisher=eveonline.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301014935/http://www.eveonline.com/pressreleases/default.asp?pressReleaseID=53 |archivedate=March 1, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alpha accounts are freely available through both the ''Eve Online'' website and the [[Steam (software)|Steam content delivery system]]. The accounts through the Recruit-A-Friend program function identically to normal Alpha accounts, but start with some additional unallocated skill points (worth approximately 5-6 days worth of training time) on their first character. In addition, if the recruited account is subsequently converted to a subscription account (known as an Omega account), the referrer is rewarded with 30 free days of subscription time or the equivalent amount of PLEX.

Alpha accounts are free and allow players to access most of the ''Eve Online'' game, with exceptions. Alpha players cannot train skills for some advanced ship types or modules, including all Tech 2 ships and most Tech 2 modules.  Alpha accounts can also only passive train up to 5 million skill points using the normal skill training system.  After that limit, the only way they can acquire more skill points is by converting to Omega, or by using skill point injectors (available on the in-game market).  In December, 2017, an additional item called a Daily Alpha Injector was added to the game, available for purchase via the official game store for PLEX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eveonline.com/article/new-alpha-training-option/ | title=New alpha training option! |author=[[CCP Games]] |publisher=eveonline.com |date=November 14, 2017 |accessdate=February 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This item is only usable by Alpha accounts, is only usable once per day, awards an amount of skill points roughly equal to a full 24 hours of training time, and costs slightly more than 1/30th as much as a 30 day subscription.  This allows Alpha accounts to progress at a similar rate and cost to an Omega account even beyond the 5 million skill point limit, but to purchase that progression in smaller increments than a full 30-day subscription.  Alpha accounts are limited to a specific list of skills and levels in those skills, and are unable to inject skill points into disallowed skills or beyond the maximum level in allowed skills.  Alpha accounts have approximately 20.5 million skillpoints worth of skills available to them.

Omega accounts that lapse on their subscription are downgraded to Alpha accounts.  These accounts don't ''lose'' any skill points or skills, but any skills or skill levels beyond those allowed for an Alpha account are inactive and cannot be used to fulfill the prerequisites of modules or ships, nor do the passive effects of those skills take effect.  Functionally, Omega accounts that lapse into Alpha accounts can only access and use any of those skills that are on the Alpha skill list (and thus may not be able to fly ships that they could as an Omega pilot), but if they later upgrade back to Omega, they regain access to their full skill list.

As of June 2008, Eve Time Codes (or ETCs) are available exclusively in 60-day increments. Before then, they were also offered in 30-, 50-, 90-, 100- and 120-day increments. Discontinued cards remain valid. Players using ETCs are treated like normal subscribers in every way. Eve Time Codes are available through CCP's online store as well as via online resellers.&lt;ref name="EveETCResellerPage"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://secure.eveonline.com/etc.aspx |title=Officially maintained Eve Time Code resellers |accessdate=January 15, 2008 |author=CCP Games |publisher=eveonline.com  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cards purchased through resellers are usually delivered through email for immediate use while codes issued through the ''Eve Online'' store are issued via postal mail or in-game item, and as such ETCs do not violate the EULA and can be bought and sold within the game.&lt;ref name="bk_498"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.eveonline.com/Pages/KB/Article.aspx?id=498 |title=Buying 30 day Concord Pilot License Extension through the EVE Online website |accessdate=February 12, 2009 |author=CCP Games |publisher=eveonline.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417111903/http://support.eveonline.com/Pages/KB/Article.aspx?id=498 |archivedate=April 17, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no distinguishing differences in functionality between digital and hard-copy codes. Both provide the exact amount of specified game time, are entered into the same account section and can be exchanged between players for ISK using a secure exchange system facilitated by a "Timecode Bazaar" forum.

In November 2008, CCP introduced PLEX, the CONCORD Pilots License EXtension, which is an in-game item that can be used to extend a subscription for 30 days.  PLEX can be purchased on the Eve Online website for real money, or inside the game for ISK.  60-day ETCs can be converted to two 30-day PLEX within the Eve Online client, which can then be sold via the in-game market. PLEX is the reason that the cost of in-game assets can be translated into real-life money. As the price of a PLEX is around €15, it can be calculated how much a certain ship or implant is theoretically worth in a real currency.

In May 2017, CCP converted PLEX into smaller increments.  All existing PLEX were converted to 500 of the new PLEX (which are exclusively referred to as PLEX in-game, rather than Pilot License EXtension, though the acronym meaning remains unchanged).  30 days subscriptions now cost 500 PLEX, effectively the same cost as previously.  The previous premium currency, Aurum, was retired and converted to PLEX at the same exchange rate as PLEX could be exchanged for Aurum previously (1 old PLEX per 3500 Aurum, so 1 new PLEX per 7 Aurum), provided the account had at least 1000 Aurum to convert.  All items in the premium store that used to cost Aurum now cost an equivalent number of PLEX.  This allowed CCP to market more granular deals on PLEX, as well as price certain services for PLEX with more granularity.  For example, Multiple Character Training used to cost 1 PLEX, the same prices as 30 days of subscription time, but now costs 450 PLEX, 90% of the cost of 30 days of subscription time.  In the same patch, CCP also introduced the PLEX Vault, a safe and secure way of moving PLEX around in-game without risking the item being lost if one's ship were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eveonline.com/article/plex-changes-on-the-way |title=PLEX changes on the way! | author=[[CCP Games]] |publisher=eveonline.com |date=March 16, 2017 |accessdate=February 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 10, 2009, a boxed edition is available in shops. The distribution is being managed by [[Atari]].&lt;ref name="eve_atari_boxed_version" /&gt; The boxed edition includes a 60-day ETC, instant standings update to facilitate quicker entry into factional warfare, exclusive online new player guide, and an exclusive expanded cargo hold shuttle. Although marketed as included in the retail box, the bonus items are only available to new accounts created with the 60-day ETC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tentonhammer.com/node/64591 |title=EVE Online Box Edition Features Tons of Extras! |accessdate=March 3, 2009 |author=Savanja |work=tentonhammer.com |publisher=Master Games International |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226210726/http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/64591 |archivedate=February 26, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Eve Online'' received mixed reviews at the launch of the game in 2003 but more favorable reviews later in its lifecycle. The original version received 75% on [[GameRankings]] and 69/100 on [[Metacritic]].{{r|GR|MC}} The ''Special Edition'' released in 2009 has an aggregate score of 88/100 on Metacritic.&lt;ref name="MCSE" /&gt;

In 2013, ''[[PC Gamer]]'' placed ''Eve Online'' at #12 on their list of 100 Greatest Games of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/11/19/eve-rubicon-interview-on-star-gates-space-colonisation-and-valkyrie/|title=Eve Rubicon interview: on star gates, space colonisation and Eve Valkyrie|author=|date=|work=PC Gamer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] added ''Eve Online'' to its [[List of video games in the Museum of Modern Art|permanent collection of video games]]. The game is showcased as a "day in the universe" video. To create this, CCP Games called upon ''Eve Online''{{'}}s large player-base to provide gameplay footage of the game. Furthermore, CCP Games contributed a large amount of data from its servers, which were compiled to produce a "stunning view" of the accomplishments of player collaborations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/05/12/eve-online-exhibit-to-become-a-permanent-fixture-at-new-yorks-museum-of-modern-art/|title=Eve Online exhibit to become a permanent fixture at New York’s Museum of Modern Art|publisher=''[[VentureBeat]]''|last=Takahashi|first=Dean|date=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, CCP said that they had made deals to create both a comic book and a television series based on ''Eve Online''. The comic, titled ''Eve: True Stories'', was released by [[Dark Horse Comics]] and made available for free online in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/eve-true-stories-the-comic-book-based-on-true-events-20.000-years-into-the-future|title=DARK HORSE PRESENTS EVE: TRUE STORIES – ISSUE #1 OUT NOW!}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, a physical version of the graphic novel containing bonus material was made available that same year. To make the television series, CCP signed a deal with Icelandic director [[Baltasar Kormákur]]. As of May 2013, no information has been given about the title or the premiere date of the television series. The storylines from both the graphic novel and the television series will be based on actual player-driven events that happened in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccpgames.com/en/public-relations/press-releases/article/74964/ccp-games-and-dark-horse-team-up-for-eve-comic-and-sourcebook-projects/ |title=CCP Games and Dark Horse Team Up for EVE Comic and Sourcebook Projects |publisher=CCP Games |date=April 27, 2013 |accessdate=May 4, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503104322/http://www.ccpgames.com/en/public-relations/press-releases/article/74964/ccp-games-and-dark-horse-team-up-for-eve-comic-and-sourcebook-projects/ |archivedate=May 3, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccpgames.com/en/public-relations/press-releases/article/74963/ccp-games-signs-deal-eve-universe-television-series-baltasar-kormakur/ |title=CCP Games Signs Deal to Develop EVE Universe Television Series with Baltasar Kormákur |publisher=CCP Games |date=April 27, 2013 |accessdate=May 4, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503104307/http://www.ccpgames.com/en/public-relations/press-releases/article/74963/ccp-games-signs-deal-eve-universe-television-series-baltasar-kormakur/ |archivedate=May 3, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamefilms.com/baltasar-kormakur-talks-eve-online-tv-series/|title=‘EVE Online’ TV series update from Baltasar Kormákur|author=|date=|work=VIDEO GAME FILMS|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817135627/http://www.videogamefilms.com/baltasar-kormakur-talks-eve-online-tv-series/|archivedate=August 17, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Corvus hawaiiensis FWS.jpg|thumb|The [[Hawaiian crow|ʻalalā]] has been extinct in the wild since 2002]]

An '''extinct in the wild''' ('''EW''') [[species]] is one which has been [[Conservation status|categorized]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] as known only by living members kept in captivity or as a naturalized population outside its historic range due to massive habitat loss.&lt;ref&gt;IUCN, [http://www.iucnredlist.org/documents/redlist_cats_crit_en.pdf 2001 IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria:  Version 3.1] p.14  Last visited: 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pinta Island tortoise]] (''Geochelone nigra abingdoni'') had only one living individual, named [[Lonesome George]], until his death in June 2012.&lt;ref name=planetark&gt;{{Cite web|title=Lonesome George faces own Galapagos tortoise curse |first=Simon |last=Gardner |url=http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/9708/newsDate/06-Feb-2001/story.htm |date=6 February 2001 |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604055952/http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/9708/newsDate/06-Feb-2001/story.htm |archivedate=4 June 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tortoise was believed to be entirely extinct in the mid-20th century, until Hungarian [[malacology|malacologist]] [[József Vágvölgyi]] spotted Lonesome George on the [[Galapagos Islands|Galapagos island]] of Pinta on 1 December 1971. Since then, Lonesome George has been a powerful symbol for conservation efforts in general and for the Galapagos Islands in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Nicholls|first=H|year=2006|title=Lonesome George: The Life and Loves of a Conservation Icon|publisher=Macmillan Science|location=London|url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/henry|isbn=1-4039-4576-4|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his death on 24 June 2012, the subspecies is again believed to be extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-18574279 |title=Last Pinta giant tortoise Lonesome George dies |publisher=BBC News |date=24 June 2012 |accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the discovery of 17 hybrid Pinta tortoises located at nearby Wolf Volcano a plan has been made to attempt to breed the subspecies back into a pure state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2237292/Lonesome-Georges-extinct-species-reintroduced-Galapagos-Islands-scientists-using-cross-breeding.html |title=Not so Lonesome (George) after all: Scientists believe they can resurrect extinct species of famous tortoise by cross-breeding |publisher=The Daily Mail |date=23 November 2012 |accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all species that are extinct in the wild are rare. For example, ''[[Ameca splendens]]'', though extinct in the wild,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Contreras-Balderas, S. &amp; Almada-Villela, P. | title = ''Ameca splendens'' | journal = [[The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] | volume = 1996 | page = e.T1117A3259262 | publisher = [[IUCN]] | date = 1996 | url = http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/1117/0 | doi = 10.2305/IUCN.UK.1996.RLTS.T1117A3259262.en | access-date = 14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a popular fish among [[aquarist]]s for some time, but hobbyist stocks have declined quite a lot more recently, placing its survival in jeopardy.&lt;ref name = kelleyetal2006&gt;{{aut|Kelley, J.L.; Magurran, A.E. &amp; Macías García, C.}} (2006): Captive breeding promotes aggression in an endangered Mexican fish. ''Biological Conservation'' '''133'''(2): 169–177. {{doi|10.1016/j.biocon.2006.06.002}} (HTML abstract)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ultimate purpose of preserving biodiversity is to maintain ecological function.  When a species exists only in captivity, it is [[Ecological extinction|ecologically extinct]].

==Reintroduction==
{{Main|Reintroduction}}
Reintroduction is the deliberate release of species into the wild, from captivity or relocated from other areas where the species survives. This may be an option for certain species that are endangered or extinct in the wild. However, it may be difficult to reintroduce EW species into the wild, even if their natural habitats were restored, because survival techniques, which are often passed from parents to offspring during parenting, may be lost. While conservation efforts may preserve some of the [[genetics]] of a species, the species may never fully recover due to the loss of the natural [[memetics]] of the species.

An example of a successful reintroduction of an EW species is [[Przewalski's horse]], which as of 2018 is considered to be an [[Endangered species]], following reintroduction started in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212234213/http://www.zsl.org/info/media/press-releases/null,1790,PR.html|title=An extraordinary return from the brink of extinction for worlds last wild horse|date=2012-02-12|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Futuremark Oy''' was a Finnish [[software development]] company that produced [[computer benchmark]] applications for home, business, and press use. Futuremark was acquired by [[UL (safety organization)|UL]] on 31 October 2014,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.ul.com/newsroom/pressreleases/ul-signals-strategic-expansion-into-performance-benchmarking-services-with-futuremark-acquisition/ |title=UL Signals Strategic Expansion into Performance Benchmarking Services with Futuremark Acquisition {{!}} UL|date=3 November 2014|work=UL|access-date=25 April 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was formally merged into the company on 23 April 2018.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/futuremark-rebranded-as-ul,36940.html |title='Futuremark' Is No More; Benchmark Maker Adopts Parent Company's 'UL' Branding |date=23 April 2018 |work=Tom's Hardware|access-date=25 April 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 1997 as "Futuremark" by members of the former [[demoscene]] group [[Future Crew]], the company is the leading producer of [[Benchmark (computing)|computer benchmark]] applications in the world. Its software is used by many computer review magazines and websites and is popular within the gaming community; high scores in its 3DMark benchmarks are considered as bragging rights among computer gamers who use it as a way to gauge their computer's performance relative to that of others'.

Soon after being founded the company altered its trading name to "MadOnion.com"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.futuremark.com/pressroom/pressreleases/20409/ Futuremark press release Nov 9th 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; until finally settling on "Futuremark Corporation" in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.futuremark.com/pressroom/pressreleases/20433/ MadOnion press release Dec 11th 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[3DMark]] series has been the company's most popular and successful to date.

Futuremark's applications are distributed via the Internet as well as offline media. In addition to its benchmarking software, the company has also provided services such as IHV/ISV customised benchmarks, 3D demos as well as online and data services.

In March 2007, Futuremark launched a website specialising in news and reviews of PC games, called [http://www.yougamers.com YouGamers].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.futuremark.com//pressroom/pressreleases/50642/ Futuremark press release Mar 7th 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, Futuremark announced the formation of the Futuremark Games Studio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.futuremark.com/pressroom/pressreleases/52482/ Futuremark press release Jan 29th 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2008, at the Leipzig Games Convention, Futuremark Games Studio announced details of its first game, [[Shattered Horizon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.futuremark.com/pressroom/pressreleases/53949/ Futuremark press release Aug 19th 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, Futuremark's mobile and embedded business unit was spun off and renamed [[Rightware]].

In March 2012, Futuremark sold its game development division to [[Rovio Entertainment]] (developer of the ''[[Angry Birds]]'' franchise) for an undisclosed sum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cio.com/article/703004/Angry_Birds_Creator_Acquires_Games_Developer?taxonomyId=3194 Angry Birds creator acquires games developer], visited 3 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The sale was intended to allow the company to focus on its benchmarking software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ratcliffe |first=Chris |title="Angry Birds" creator adds Futuremark Game Studio’s team to fleet of talent |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/techology/angry-birds-creator-adds-futuremark-game-studios-team-to-fleet-of-talent/2012/03/27/gIQAHWooeS_story.html |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=28 March 2012 |date=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 October 2014,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Futuremark was acquired by [[UL (safety organization)|UL]] for an undisclosed sum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.brightsideofnews.com/2014/11/03/futuremark-gets-acquired-underwriters-laboratories/ |title=Futuremark Acquired by Underwriters Laboratories |last=Hartley |first=Darleen |date=3 November 2014 |work=Bright Side of News |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 April 2018, Futuremark was rebranded as UL.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Futuremark website was closed, and its content was moved to a new [https://benchmarks.ul.com UL Benchmarks] website.

'''Helen Dale''' (born '''Helen Darville'''; 24 January 1972), known for a time by her [[pen name]] '''Helen Demidenko''', is an Australian writer and lawyer. She served as a senior adviser to [[David Leyonhjelm]], a [[Liberal Democratic Party (Australia)|Liberal Democrat]] member of the [[Australian Senate]], from 2014 through to the election in 2016. She has been a contributing writer to ''[[Quillette]]'' since 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://quillette.com/2018/06/27/who-we-are/ |title=Who We Are |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |publisher=Quillette |date=June 27, 2018 |access-date=September 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://quillette.com/author/helen-dale/ |title=Helen Dale, Author at Quillette |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |publisher=Quillette |access-date=September 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A daughter of British immigrants, Darville was educated at [[Redeemer Lutheran College]] in [[Rochedale, Queensland|Rochedale]], a suburb of [[Brisbane]]. While studying English literature at the [[University of Queensland]], she wrote ''The Hand that Signed the Paper,'' a novel about a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] family who collaborated with the Nazis in the [[Holocaust]]. In 1993, the novel won [[The Australian/Vogel Literary Award]] for an unpublished manuscript.

Dale published her book in 1994 under the pseudonym Helen Demidenko and won the [[Miles Franklin Award]], becoming the award's youngest winner. The following year, she was the subject of a major Australian literary controversy because she had falsely claimed Ukrainian ancestry as part of the basis of the book (and her pseudonym).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.australianhumanitiesreview.org/archive/demidenko/heyward.1.html|title=Helen Darville aka Helen Demidenko - Update|work=Australian Humanities Review|date= |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The misrepresentation has been described as a "[[literary hoax]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hums3001.unsw.wikispaces.net/Literary+Hoaxes#Literary%20Hoaxes-Examples-Helen%20Demidenko/Darville |title=hums3001 - Literary Hoaxes |publisher=Hums3001.unsw.wikispaces.net |date= |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]].''&lt;ref name=knox/&gt; The novel was subsequently reissued under her legal name, then Helen Darville. It won the 1995 [[ALS Gold Medal|Australian Literary Society Gold Medal]].

After teaching, Dale returned to university, gaining her law degree in 2002. She later did post-graduate law study at Oxford and completed an LLB degree in 2012 at the University of Edinburgh. She returned to Australia and became a senior adviser to [[David Leyonhjelm]], a [[Liberal Democratic Party (Australia)|Liberal Democrat]] member of the [[Australian Senate]], but at the end of May 2016 Leyonhjelm revealed that Dale had left his employ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aston|first1=Heath|title=Senator David Leyonhjelm's plan to pay cash, 'ignore tax' in new hire for Liberal Democratic Party|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2016/senator-david-leyonhjelms-plan-to-pay-cash-ignore-tax-in-new-hire-for-liberal-democratic-party-20160530-gp76ix.html|accessdate=2016-05-30|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Hand that Signed the Paper'': novel and controversy==

===Contents===
Darville's debut novel, ''The Hand that Signed the Paper'', tells the story of a Ukrainian family trying to survive a decade of [[Stalinist purges]] and state-imposed poverty and famine. The family comprises the parents, a daughter, and two sons. They suffer abuse by the drunken local commissar and are refused treatment by the village doctor and his wife (a secular Jew). Many Ukrainians hail the German invaders as liberators from Soviet oppression. Many volunteered for the German armed forces&amp;mdash;[[Wehrmacht]], [[SS]], and [[Ordnungspolizei]]. The novel stresses the arbitrariness of the assignments to military units. A Ukrainian could as easily end up fighting on the front alongside the Wehrmacht as be in a death squad.

The two young brothers are separated in military assignments: 16-year-old Evheny to [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Einsatzgruppen]] C (a mobile killing squad) and the elder 19-year-old Vitaly to the SS training facility for Ukrainians at [[Trawniki]] in Poland. Evheny is implicated in the massacre at [[Babi Yar]] outside Kiev, while Vitaly is posted to [[Treblinka extermination camp]] as a guard. Evheny is later sent to a front-line [[Waffen SS]] formation on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], while Vitaly is posted to northern Italy. He is part of German anti-partisan activity in the wake of Italy's withdrawal from the Axis alliance.

===Style===
The novel is told primarily from the point of view of Kateryna, sister of the two brothers, and Magda, Vitaly's [[Common-law marriage|common-law wife]] from the Polish village near the Treblinka extermination camp. Kateryna has a relationship with a German SS [[Hauptsturmführer]]. Magda assists a Jewish prisoner to escape after the Treblinka prisoner revolt in August 1943. The family's story is gradually revealed by Fiona, Evheny's Australian-born daughter, who starts investigating the past after her uncle Vitaly is charged in the early 1990s with war crimes in World War II.

The novel was frank about the anti-semitism of its major characters (who blame Jews for the excesses of Communism), and Darville represented the lives of Ukrainian military men in a sympathetic manner, rather than featuring their victims as is more usual in Holocaust literature. These elements attracted accusations of antisemitism and condemnation of the book by leaders of Australia's Jewish community. There was a perception that the attitudes of the author "Helen Demidenko" may have been informed by her Ukrainian ethnic identity, until her [[pseudonym]] was revealed along with her false representation of the book as history.

===Controversy===
The novel won the [[Miles Franklin Award]], one of the most prestigious literary awards in Australia. At the time, the media discovered Helen Dale's identity and legal name. This promoted much debate on the nature of identity, ethnicity, and authenticity in Australian literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Susanna|last=Egan|title=The Company She Keeps: Demidenko and the problems of imposture in autobiography|journal=Australian Literary Studies|date=October 2004|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6396/is_4_21/ai_n29152127/|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ken|last=Stewart|title=Those infernal pictures: reading Helen Darville, her novel and her critics|journal=Australian Literary Studies|date=May 1997|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6396/is_n1_v18/ai_n28692326/?tag=content;col1|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the adverse publicity for the author, the novel won the 1995 Australian Literary Society Gold Medal.

When Dale submitted her novel to the [[University of Queensland Press]] in 1993, she said it was based upon recorded interviews with her own relatives, among others her uncle "Vitaly Demidenko". After the awards, the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' mistakenly reported in 2005 that the novel had been submitted as a non-fiction book.&lt;ref name=knox&gt;{{cite news|first=Malcolm|last=Knox|title=The Darville Made Me Do It|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=9 July 2005|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/books/the-darville-made-me-do-it/2005/07/08/1120704550613.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The author's 1993 note accompanying her manuscript had read: "The things narrated in this book really happened, the things they did [are] historical actualities." Then Dale wrote that she was presenting her book as fiction, saying: "But this is also a work of fiction. I have presented it as fiction...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://ah.brookes.ac.uk/researcharchive/conferences/calp/papers/china.pdf |title=Under the Influence of Prize Culture:Helen Demidenko and the Australian/Vogel, Miles Franklin,and ALS Gold Medal Awards |first=Corey |last=China |date= |year=2003 |conference=Culture and the Literary Prize Conference |conference-url= |editor= |others= |volume= |edition= |book-title= |publisher= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609224823/http://ah.brookes.ac.uk/researcharchive/conferences/calp/papers/china.pdf |archive-date=9 June 2011 |location= |pages= |format=PDF |id= |isbn= |bibcode= |oclc= |doi= |access-date= |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript= |language= |page= |at= |trans-title= |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books that discuss the scandal===
The controversy that surrounded ''The Hand that Signed the Paper'' inspired the publication in 1996 of two books that assessed the novel and issues of authenticity: [[Robert Manne]]'s ''The Culture of Forgetting: Helen Demidenko and the Holocaust'' and Andrew Riemer's ''The Demidenko Debate''. Manne is very critical of Darville's book.&lt;!--On what grounds? --&gt; Riemer is not, believing her approach was consistent with fiction, even if she tried to exaggerate the specific historic basis of her work.&lt;!-- Needs expansion --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Riemer, Andrew|date=1996|title=The Demidenko Debate|location=St Leonards, NSW|publisher=Allen and Unwin|page=84|isbn=1-86448-109-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later work and recent years==
In 1995, Darville published a short story, "Pieces of the Puzzle", in the Australian culture journal ''[[Meanjin]]''. The byline was 'Demidenko', although the journal noted that the author had "taken back" her legal name of Darville. She has said that she had met Ukrainian witnesses to the war and the Holocaust, and based the story on their accounts. The [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] wrote to her demanding that she identify these possible war criminals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Dale was briefly a columnist with the Brisbane daily newspaper ''[[The Courier-Mail]]''. She was dismissed for accusations of plagiarism after repeating jokes originally from the '[[Evil Overlord List]]' in one of her columns and passing them off as her own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=David |last=Greason |title=The Review – TZADIK |publisher=Australia/Israel &amp; Jewish Affairs Council |journal= |url=http://www.aijac.org.au/review/1997/222/tzad222.html |accessdate=26 September 2006 |date= |volume= |number= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012013532/http://www.aijac.org.au/review/1997/222/tzad222.html |archivedate=12 October 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Australian]]|title=Editor dumps Darville|page=3|date=5 February 1997|url=|accessdate=|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued to write freelance features for other [[News Corporation]] newspapers and magazines, and occasionally the [[Fairfax Media|Fairfax]] press. In 2017, an investigation by [[BuzzFeed]] revealed that Dale had also plagiarised a number of social media posts in her [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]] feeds. BuzzFeed asked Dale why she had been lifting the tweets. She replied over Twitter direct message: "Cos it's amusing and I don't like Twitter. And don't you have more important stuff to be writing about?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/markdistefano/dale-pulls-tweets|title=An Award-Winning Novelist Is Lifting Viral Tweets|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Darville was again accused of anti-semitism after interviewing [[David Irving]], a [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]], for ''Australian Style'' magazine during his [[slander and libel|libel]] trial in London. (It was decided against him.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Cauchi|title=Irving View Under Attack|work=[[The Age]]|date=29 February 2000|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/d/darville-helen/australian_business_intelligence.html|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She wrote a post-September 11 article in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Helen|last=Darville|title=Were we US-Bashers wrong all along?|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=1 October 2001|url=http://www.thinkcentre.org/article.cfm?ArticleID=1126 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After working as a secondary teacher for several years in Australia and the UK, Darville returned to the University of Queensland in 2002 to study law. Graduating with a first class honours degree in law in 2005,{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}she commenced work as a [[judge's associate]] for Peter Dutney, a justice of the [[Supreme Court of Queensland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris|last=Merrit|title=Hand Not Signed to This Paper|work=[[The Australian]]|date=15 March 2007|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/hand-not-signed-to-this-paper/story-e6frg6oo-1111113157633|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since gaining her law degree, Darville has also appeared on the [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] program ''[[Insight (SBS TV, Australia)|Insight]]'', and as a guest of the [[University of Melbourne]]'s Publishing and Communications Program. She is associated with the [[Australian Skeptics]], and has written for both their in-house magazine and ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]],'' a conservative journal. In 2007 Darville was reported to be working on a second novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|authorlink=Frank Devine|author=Devine, Frank|title=Literary rebirth in progress for the hand that signs the blog|work=[[The Australian]]|date=11 January 2007|url=http://blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au/yoursay/index.php/theaustralian/comments/literary_rebirth_in_progress_for_hand_that_signs_the_blog|accessdate=16 August 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070917075110/http://blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au/yoursay/index.php/theaustralian/comments/literary_rebirth_in_progress_for_hand_that_signs_the_blog/|archivedate=17 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''High-definition television in Australia''' is available via cable, [[IPTV]], satellite and terrestrial television. The first [[High-definition television|high-definition broadcasts]] began in 2001 and since then the number of channels available to view has grown to a maximum of 27 that can be viewed on pay-TV service, [[Foxtel]].

==Broadcasters==
===ABC===
On 1 January 2002, the [[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC]] began a prime-time simulcast of ABC's Sydney station ABN, except that it had no watermark and was upconverted from standard definition to [[1080i]] [[High-definition television|high definition]]. On 1 January 2005 it changed to [[576p]] to accommodate the launch of new channel ABC2 and gradually expanded its operating hours.

On 1 January 2008, the ABC's high definition simulcast was rebranded as '''ABC HD''', relaunching as a high definition multichannel with its own logo and branding. The channel was also enhanced to [[720p]] to mark the start of native high-definition content.

Throughout its multichannel era, ABC HD continued providing a high definition simulcast of ABN Sydney. As a result, viewers outside of New South Wales would see Sydney-based news bulletins and other localised content. The purpose of this as of 2008, was to provide high-definition versions of ABC1 shows when available (Prior to this, the broadcaster relied on regulation exemptions that allowed it to meet a high-definition [[Production quota|quota]] using content upscaled from [[standard definition]]).

There were exceptions to the ABC1 simulcast: During the [[2008 Summer Paralympics]] in Beijing, ABC HD became a dedicated sports broadcaster, simulcasting the dedicated coverage on ABC2 for most of the day. The 2009 VFL Grand Final was shown exclusively live on ABC HD. For a time up until ABC HD branding ceased, ABC HD screened a "7:30 Select" national highlights package instead of the Sydney version of ''Stateline''.

On 10 June 2010, ABC HD's unique branding was replaced with that of ABC1, reverting the channel to an ABN Sydney simulcast. ABC HD ceased being a simulcast of ABC1 from 6 July 2010 in [[Tasmania]] and the ACT; 7 July 2010 in [[Queensland]], South Australia, Western Australia and [[Northern Territory]]; and on 8 July 2010 in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[New South Wales]], all replaced by a looped pre-launch promotion for [[ABC News 24]] on channel 24. This made ABC the second broadcaster in Australia to permanently discontinue the high definition simulcast of its main channel, following the removal of [[Ten HD]] to create Ten's former sports and now entertainment channel [[One (Australian TV channel)|One]] in 2009.

ABC Director of Television Richard Finlayson confirmed that the ABC will recommence simulcasting in HD in June 2016. However, in contrast to its past, ABC HD will provide regional-specific simulcasting, not just a nationwide simulcast of [[ABN (TV station)|ABN Sydney]]. As a result, [[ABC News 24]] will be reduced to a standard definition broadcast.

On 6 December 2016, the ABC HD recommenced simulcasting in high definition, upgrade to 1080i high-definition format via Freeview and Optus D1. As a result, [[ABC News 24]] was reduced to a [[standard definition]] broadcast on channel 24.

===Seven Network===
In 2004, after the 2001 introduction of [[Digital terrestrial television in Australia|digital terrestrial television]] in Australia, the [[Seven Network]] began a part-time high definition simulcast on digital channel 70 under the name '''7 HD Digital'''. This simulcast showcased native high definition content alongside standard definition services on Seven. During the times that native high definition content was unavailable for simulcasting, a promo loop that showcased extracts from a variety of Seven's programs was broadcast.

'''7HD''' was officially announced on 15 September 2007, with the [[Seven West Media]] announcing their intention to start a [[High-definition television|high definition]] multichannel, that was initially expected to launch in December 2007. However, 7HD became the first [[Free-to-air]] [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial television]] channel introduced to metropolitan areas since 1988, when it launched prior on 15 October 2007, with ''[[25th Hour]]'' being the first program broadcast at 10:30pm.

The channel replaced Seven's existing [[High-definition television|high definition]] service 7 HD Digital, a part-time [[simulcast]] of its [[Standard-definition television|standard definition]] and [[analog television|analogue]] services. Due to an amendment of the ''[[Broadcasting Services Act 1992]]'' in 2006, the ''Broadcasting Legislation Amendment ([[Digital television]]) Act 2006'', television networks are now permitted to launch digital multichannels, provided that they are broadcast exclusively in [[High-definition television|high definition]]. The channel expanded its broadcast schedule on 10 December 2007 to include daytime programming which had previously been a full simulcast of the main channel. 7HD breakaway programming ceased transmission on Sunday 4 October 2009 in preparation for the launch of [[7TWO]] a few weeks later on 1 November. 7HD then returned to being a full high definition simulcast of Seven, before finally being replaced by [[7mate]] on 25 September 2010.

On 10 May 2016, 7HD returned as a high definition simulcast on channel 70.

===Nine Network===
From the launch of digital TV on 1 January 2001, the [[Nine Network]]'s [[High-definition television|high definition]] service, a [[simulcast]] of its [[Standard-definition television|standard definition]] and [[analog television|analogue]] services, was heavily simulcasting Nine's standard definition content [[video scaler|upconverted]] to HD. From 2002, this was interspersed with a loop of high definition demonstration material during business hours, for viewing in the showrooms of television retailers, at the conclusion of an equivalent service by [[Network Ten]].

2002 saw the first revenue-generating broadcast in native HD in Australia, with the drama [[Judging Amy]]. Nine increased its native HD output in the lead-up to the commencement of the HD quota on 1 July 2003, from which point it broadcast a minimum of 1,040 hours of native HD content per year.  The largest portion of this was [[Today (Australian TV program)|The Today Show]].

9HD was officially announced as a part-time (or "breakaway") multichannel on 27 September 2007, to replace the [[Nine Network]]'s existing high definition simulcast service through the use of an amendment to the ''[[Broadcasting Services Act 1992]]'' in 2006. The ''Broadcasting Legislation Amendment ([[Digital television]]) Act 2006'' permitted television networks to launch digital multichannels, provided that they are broadcast exclusively in [[High-definition television|high definition]].

Although originally expected to be the first [[free-to-air]] [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial television]] channel introduced to metropolitan areas since 1988, meant that 9HD was not the first [[High-definition television|high definition]] multichannel in Australia. Following this, plans for a November launch in 2007 were postponed until 2008. On 10 March 2008, [[PBL Media]] announced that it would launch the channel on 17 March 2008 at 10:30pm, with its first program, ''[[Nightline (Australian news program)|Nightline]]''.

The re-branded 9HD officially commenced transmission on 17 March 2008 from [[PBL Media]]'s four metropolitan [[owned-and-operated station]]s, [[TCN]] Sydney, [[GTV (Australia)|GTV]] [[Melbourne]], [[QTQ]] [[Brisbane]] and [[NTD (television station)|NTD]] [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], in addition to [[WIN Corporation]]'s two metropolitan stations [[NWS (TV station)|NWS]] [[Adelaide]], and [[STW]] [[Perth]] as well as on its regional stations [[RTQ]] [[Queensland]], [[WIN Television|WIN]] southern [[New South Wales]], [[VTV (TV station)|VTV]] [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and [[TVT (TV station)|TVT]] [[Tasmania]]. The first official program on launch night began at 19:00, [[Nine News]]'s [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] daily main national nightly television news bulletin program ''[[Nine News|Nine Television News]]''.

All 9HD breakaway programming ceased transmission on Sunday 2 August 2009 in preparation for the launch of [[9Go!|GO!]] (now 9Go!) on 9 August. As a result, 9HD became a full simulcast of Nine's main channel.

9HD was replaced by the [[9Gem]] multichannel on 26 September 2010, which unlike the previous incarnation, was a full-time breakaway and branded separately (with one exception being the [[London Olympics]]).  This removed the HD simulcast of Channel Nine entirely to allow a third channel to fit on Nine's [[DVB-T]] multiplex (due to technical and regulatory limitations).  As a result, Nine lost all youth, news and comedy content in HD, but instead screened female, crime and lifestyle content on its only HD facility.

For the purposes of some sport such as cricket, GEM was still used on an occasional basis to broadcast HD under the [[Nine's Wide World of Sports|Wide World of Sports]] brand, though not necessarily as a simulcast with Nine.  As such, this was generally limited to events outside of [[prime time]], while those with more prominence continued to be shown on the [[Nine Network]].

On 26 November 2015, Nine recommenced simulcasting in HD on channel 90. As a result, [[9Gem]] was moved to channel 92 and reduced to [[standard definition]].

This revival marked 9HD's switch to [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] broadcasting, allowing the broadcaster to operate at full quality in [[1080i|1920x1080i50]] resolution using a lower bitrate than in 2007. This gives the network the ability to provide all the other multichannel services launched since 2009, such as [[9Go!]], at the same time.

===Network Ten===
From the revamp of its production and circle logo and of the slogan ''Seriously Ten'' on 1 February 2001, this was interspersed with a loop of high definition demonstration material during business hours, for viewing in the showrooms of television retailers, at the conclusion of an equivalent service by [[Network Ten]].

Ten HD was officially announced on 14 September 2007, to replace Network Ten's existing high definition service, a simulcast of its standard definition and analogue services, through the use of an amendment to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 in 2006. The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television) Act 2006 permitted television networks to launch digital multichannels, provided that they are broadcast exclusively in high definition.

Although originally expected to be the first free-to-air commercial television channel introduced to metropolitan areas since 1988, the surprise launch of Seven Media Group's HD offering, [[7HD]], on 15 October 2007, two months before transmissions were scheduled to begin, meant that Ten HD was launched as the second high-definition multichannel in Australia. PBL Media announced the creation of a similar multichannel, 9HD, on 27 September, which was launched on 17 March 2008.

Ten's parent company, and shareholder in metropolitan ratings system OzTAM, Ten Network Holdings Limited, began discussions with the ratings system operator to have digital multichannels, such as Ten HD and [[ABC2]], included in television ratings for the first time on 17 September 2007. As well as this, on the same day, it was announced that the national weekend editions of Ten News would be timeshifted from Ten onto Ten HD, an hour delayed at 6 pm, to directly compete with Seven News and National Nine News. This would have seen Ten News formally broadcast at 6 pm for the first time since 1992, however, the timeslot was later amended to 5.30 pm.

In preparation for the launch of Ten HD, Ten's digital terrestrial channel line-up was updated on 19 November 2007, with changes consisting of LCN1 redirecting Network Ten's current high-definition simulcast. Following this, on 21 November 2007, Ten Network Holdings Limited announced that it would launch the channel on 16 December 2007 at 5.00 pm, with the first program, ''[[Totally Wild]]''.

Ten HD officially commenced transmission on 16 December 2007 from the network's five metropolitan owned-and-operated stations in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, and Perth. Prior to the official launch, at 5.00 pm the first program, Totally Wild, was broadcast. Following this, for the first time since 1992, Ten News and Sports Tonight were broadcast in direct competition with Seven News and National Nine News, timeshifted by thirty minutes to 5.30 pm and 6.00 pm respectively.

The first official program on launch night began at 8.30 pm, the 2001 movie Black Hawk Down. This was followed by Bon Jovi's Lost Highway Tour at 11.30 pm and Video Hits Presents: The Music of Supernatural at 12.25 am. Video Hits Up-Late marked the end of the first night of transmission for Ten HD at 12.50 am.

In the lead-up to the opening night, the channel promised up to eleven hours of time-shifted programming from Ten in addition to fifty hours of exclusive programming, which included live sport, entertainment, films, documentaries, science fiction and news. This consisted of six movies per week, in addition to National Geographic documentaries in the afternoon, from 3pm to 5pm, music-oriented programming following the Sunday Night Movie, along with a primetime breakaway schedule on Thursdays and from 10.30 pm to 11.30 pm Monday to Wednesday.

In addition to high definition broadcasting on channel 1, a standard definition simulcast of [[Ten HD]] was provided on channel 11 as '''Ten SD2'''.

From 2009, commercial networks in Australia were allowed to broadcast a standard definition subchannel. Rather than introduce a new digital service, Ten decided to relaunch Ten HD as a sports-only channel, to be named One HD (now One), and use its standard definition simulcast on channel 11 to broadcast a standard definition simulcast called One SD. Before One HD's official launch, most breakaway programming shown on Ten HD ceased from 1 January 2009, and only showed a high-definition broadcast of the existing Ten digital service, along with a few sports-based breakaway programs. Ten HD officially shut down on 25 March 2009, with One HD launching the following day.

After the Nine Network restarted broadcasting [[9HD]] in November 2015, Ten confirmed that it was working on rebroadcasting Ten HD. However, they did not put a time frame on it, stating that they are "working through some technical and rights issues". On 11 February 2016, some smart TVs began receiving notification messages advising of Ten HD through a "ghost broadcast" that soon disappeared.

Ten later recommenced simulcasting in high definition on 2 March 2016 on channel 13 from 3pm, in time for the 2016 season of the Virgin Australia Supercars Championship. As a result, One was reduced to a standard definition broadcast on both channel 1 and channel 12.

Ten uses MPEG-4 technology to broadcast the channel.

===SBS===
The [[SBS (Australian TV channel)|SBS]] HD multichannel was launched on 14 December 2006. It broadcasts identical programming to SBS, but in 1080i HD via Freeview and Optus D1.

==Platforms==
===Terrestrial===
====Freeview====
The [[Freeview (Australia)|Freeview]] brand was launched in November 2008 with teaser commercials promising 15 channels in 2009. The first new "Freeview" channel started on 26 March 2009 with Network Ten's One sports channel. Further advertising began on 26 April 2009, with the first Freeview certified devices appearing in retailers from May 2009. In June 2010, the second phase of devices, marked as "Freeview EPG" devices, became available in retail stores, designed to work with the newly launched interactive EPG built on MHEG-5. This Freeview EPG will cease operating on 24 November 2017.

===Satellite &amp; Cable===
====Foxtel====
[[Foxtel]] has been carrying HD channels since 2008. {{As of|2016}} it has over 20 HD channels, a mix of basic and premium subscription, free-to-air and free-to-view services.

HD broadcasts are received using the [[Foxtel|Foxtel IQ3]] service or a [[Foxtel|Foxtel HD+]] receiver. A selection of HD push-video on demand content is also available through [[Foxtel|Foxtel Anytime]] on Foxtel HD+ receivers.

====Free-to-air====
[[ABC News (TV channel)|ABC News]], [[7mate]], [[7HD]], [[9HD]], [[Ten HD]], [[SBS (Australian TV channel)|SBS HD]] along with regional networks [[WIN HD]], [[Prime7|Prime7HD]] and [[9HD]] with NBN are available unencrypted and without subscription on digital satellite, and may be received by anybody with suitable equipment – a high-definition satellite receiver and a satellite dish.

'''Hindu jokes''' are a class of [[ethnic joke]]s in India based on the lifestyle of the [[Hindu]]s and some of the common religious beliefs in [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name=Elst&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6039">{{IC|date=October 2016}}'''The Humber School of Comedy''' (''Comedy: Writing and Performance'' program) was founded in 1999, at [[Humber College]] in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada. Courses include stand-up, improvisation, scriptwriting, sketch comedy, and business aspects of the profession.

[[Lesbian]], [[gay]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) characters have been depicted in [[video games]] since the 1980s. In the [[history of video games]], LGBT characters have been almost nonexistent for a long time, reflecting the overall [[heteronormativity]] of the medium. While there has been a trend towards greater representation of LGBT people in video games, they are frequently identified as LGBT in secondary material, such as comics, rather than in the games themselves.&lt;ref name="Kotaku 4 October 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dale|first1=Laura Kate|title=The Video Game Characters You Never Knew Were LGBT|url=http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2017/10/04/the-video-game-characters-you-never-knew-were-lgbt|accessdate=8 October 2017|work=[[Kotaku]] UK|date=4 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depictions of LGBT characters==
{{See also|List of LGBT characters in video games}}

A number of recurring [[Trope (literature)|tropes]], [[Theme (literature)|theme]]s and [[archetype]]s have developed in the gaming industry in regard to LGBTQ+ identity. These are similar to how other forms of popular culture, such as Hollywood films and [[television program|TV shows]], dealt with LGBTQ+ themes.

As in other media, LGBT characters in games often suffer from the "[[bury your gays]]" trope, a long-lasting narrative convention that requires that LGBT characters die or meet another unhappy ending. According to ''[[Kotaku]]'', these characters are "largely defined by a pain that their straight counterparts do not share". Facing challenges that "serve as an in-world analogy for anti-LGBTQ bigotry", they are defined by tragedy that denies them a chance at happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Alexandra |first1=Heather |title=Let Queer Characters Be Happy |url=https://kotaku.com/let-queer-characters-be-happy-1827147707 |accessdate=8 July 2018 |work=Kotaku}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comical gender confusion===
A common method of introducing LGBT characters is to reveal their sexual orientation through [[Sexual inversion (sexology)|gender inversion]]. A male character's homosexuality is often indicated by making him a [[sissy]] character with [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] or flamboyant mannerisms, dress, and speech. The underlying assumption is that homosexuals are also frequently transgender and, therefore, possess mannerisms [[stereotype|stereotypical]] of the opposite sex. This technique has been widely used in Hollywood movies (to circumvent the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]]'s ban on "sexual perversion"), as well as in [[Vaudeville]]. Although mainly used in video games for its comedic value, [[Gender dysphoria|gender confusion]] has also been used as a tool to offer [[social commentary]] about [[sexism]] or [[homophobia]]. The censorship codes of Nintendo and Sega limited the usage of gender inversion to exclusion of [[cross-dressing]] until 1994.

===Transgender characters in video games===
The ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' character [[Birdo]], who was described as thinking he was a girl and wanting to be called "Birdetta" in early editions of the English instruction manual (the Japanese one simply stating that Catherine, as the character is known in Japan, wishes to be called "Cassie" because it sounds cuter), was changed to a more definite female until ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' introduced the concept of Birdo's gender being "[[Indeterminate gender|indeterminate]]". Similarly, the [[Infocom]] game ''[[Circuit's Edge]]'' features several transgender characters.

[[Capcom]] created ''[[Final Fight (video game)|Final Fight]]'' for the [[Amusement arcade|arcade]] in 1989. The game involved players choosing among three fighters on a quest to save the mayor's daughter, who was [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] by a criminal gang known as Mad Gear. In 1990, Capcom presented Nintendo with a version of the game for the 16-bit [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES). According to [[David Sheff|David Sheff's]] book ''[[Game Over (book)|Game Over]]'', Nintendo stated that Capcom could not put a female enemy in a video game published for the SNES, as that violated Nintendo's ban on violence against women. Capcom countered that there were no female enemies in the game, revealing that the female characters Roxy and [[Poison (Final Fight)|Poison]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fight|developer=Capcom|platform=Super Famicom|language=Japanese|level=[http://www.videogameden.com/sfc/extra/fif.pdf Instruction manual, page 25]}}&lt;/ref&gt; were [[Transsexualism|transsexual]]s. The characters were nevertheless removed from the international versions of the [[Final Fight (SNES video game)|SNES port]] (the Japanese Super [[Famicom#Famicom Disk system|Famicom]] version retained the characters).&lt;ref name=gameover_page225&gt;{{cite book|title=Game Over|last=Sheff|first=David|authorlink=David Sheff|page=225|quote=With Capcom USA, Phillips's team edited some of the grislier games that came in from its Japanese parent company, although Capcom's own censors weeded out the most offensive touches When a Capcom USA representative suggested that it was tasteless to have the game's hero beat up a woman, a Japanese designer responded that there were no women in the game. 'What about the blonde named Roxy?' the American asked. The designer responded, 'Oh, you mean the transvestite!' Roxy was given a haircut and new clothes.|isbn=0-679-40469-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1993, Sega obtained the rights to release the game for their [[Sega CD]]. In a sign of Sega's more liberal policies, Poison and Roxy could remain in the international versions, but with less-provocative clothing,&lt;ref name="ignFFwalkthrough"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.faqs.ign.com/articles/108/1084283p1.html|title=Final Fight: Double Impact Walkthrough/Achievement Guide V0.6|author=Paul Acevedo|publisher=[[ign.com]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928235242/http://uk.faqs.ign.com/articles/108/1084283p1.html|archivedate=2011-09-28|df=}} "Poison and Roxy are present in the US version, but their clothes have been redrawn to cover their chests and thighs. The image of Jessica shown in the intro was censored as well"{{Dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there could be no indication of their supposed transgender status.  (Sega of America later removed a homosexual boss and unlockable playable character called Ash from the international versions of ''[[Streets of Rage 3]].'')

The character Vivian in ''[[Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door]]'' is hinted at being transgender, but Nintendo removed all references to this in the English translation.

Krem in ''[[Dragon Age Inquisition]]'' is openly transgender and is fully accepted by peers. Iron Bull, his close friend, will leave the party if the player character acts [[Transphobia|transphobic]].

In the 2016 [[role-playing video game]] ''[[Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear]]'', there is an optional [[dialogue tree]] in which the [[Cleric (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|cleric]] Mizhena mentions that she was raised as a boy, indicating that she is a [[trans woman]]. This, along with a reference to the [[Gamergate controversy]], attracted [[Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear#Controversy|contention]] resulting in [[online harassment]] and insults towards the developers, especially against the game's writer Amber Scott.&lt;ref name="eurogamer1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-04-05-new-baldurs-gate-expansion-siege-of-dragonspear-off-to-a-rough-start|title=New Baldur's Gate expansion Siege of Dragonspear off to a rough start | last=Purchese|first=Robert |website=[[Eurogamer]] | date=April 5, 2016 | accessdate=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's Steam, GOG and Metacritic pages were bombarded with complaints that the transgender reference constituted "political correctness," "[[LGBT]] [[tokenism]]", "[[SJW]] [[Pandering (politics)|pandering]]" and pushing a [[political agenda]].&lt;ref name=polygon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/4/5/11371428/baldurs-gate-dragonspear-trans-statement | title=Vitriol and harassment hit developers of new Baldur's Gate expansion | last=Campbell | first=Colin | website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | date=April 5, 2016 | accessdate=April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eurogamer1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/04/05/baldurs-gates-expansion-adds-diversity-and-of-course-some-people-hate-it/ | title=Baldur's Gate's expansion adds diversity, and of course some people hate it (update) | website=[[VentureBeat]] | last=Grubb | first=Jeff | date=April 5, 2016 | accessdate=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On an April 2016 post, [[Beamdog]] announced they would expand Mizhena's story, saying in part, "In retrospect, it would have been better served if we had introduced a transgender character with more development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.pcgamer.com/baldurs-gate-siege-of-dragonspear-mod-cuts-transgender-reference/ | first=Andy | last=Chalk | title=Update: Beamdog cuts "ethics" joke from Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear | website=[[PC Gamer]] | date=April 6, 2016 | accessdate=April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Tumburro of ''[[CraveOnline]]'' termed this as "spineless and disappointing" stating that Beamdog's founder Trent Oster refused to acknowledge the transphobic criticisms leveled at the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.craveonline.com/entertainment/975659-beamdogs-response-baldurs-gate-controversy-spineless-disappointing | first=Paul | last=Tumburro | title=Beamdog's Response to the Baldur's Gate Controversy is Spineless and Disappointing | website=CraveOnline | date=April 12, 2016 | accessdate=November 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gay characters in adventure games===
In the 1995 game ''[[The Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight Mystery]]'', an interactive movie point and click adventure, the main character meets more than one homosexual character (amongst them his "antagonist"), some of whom express romantic feelings. A semi-historical-subplot about the romantic feelings of [[Ludwig II of Bavaria|Ludwig II]] is also an important part of the storyline.

''[[Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle]]'' featured a futuristic beauty contest that featured oddly-dressed humans. One person with whom the player can interact is Harold, who is dressed like a woman but is referred to as a man by other characters as well as referring to himself as one. Harold has a very overstated French accent and is effeminate—he could be read as gay, although cross-dressing does not necessarily have a connection to sexuality or gender. The sprite of the character is based on that of [[George Washington]], who also appears in the game.

===Gay characters in fighting games===
Having gay male characters in [[fighting game]]s can challenge the perception of homosexuality and masculinity. Nevertheless, hints about a particular character's sexual orientation in a fighting game often take the form of stereotypical femininity in an otherwise tough masculine character.

In 1994, Sega of America made various changes to the fighting game ''Streets of Rage 3'' from its original Japanese counterpart ''Bare Knuckle 3''. Among the changes was the removal of the boss named Ash (with a straight character named Shiva replacing him) who was suspected to be gay due to his attire. Ash was removed from the [[Western culture|western]] edition of the game, but remained a playable character with the aid of the [[Game Genie]]. Thus, Sega unintentionally became the first major video game company in the west to give the player the option of choosing a gay character.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The ''[[Street Fighter]]'' character [[Zangief]] has long been thought of as being homosexual,{{according to whom|date=February 2018}} since [[Bara (genre)|large hairy men]] are in fact a common stereotypical image of male homosexuals in Japan, although this was disputed in ''[[Capcom Fighting Evolution]]'', where he was seen dreaming about women in his ending, though the game is [[Canon (fiction)|non-canon]]. Another ''Street Fighter'' character, [[Street Fighter (video game)|Eagle]], who appears in the original ''[[Street Fighter (video game)|Street Fighter]],'' as well as in ''[[Capcom vs. SNK 2]]'', has been confirmed to be gay, as a tribute to [[Queen (band)|Queen]] singer [[Freddie Mercury]], whom Eagle is also modelled after, although several of Eagle's quotes clearly displaying his orientation were censored in the North American version of the game. In the more recent ''[[Super Street Fighter IV]]'', the female fighter [[Juri (Street Fighter)|Juri Han]] is hinted at possibly being a lesbian, especially evident in [[Chun-Li]] and [[Cammy]]'s rival [[cutscene]]s where Juri seems to flirt with them before proceeding to trying to kill them. When Juri Han's official profile was first released, it mentioned that she loves large breasts. However, Juri has also been known to flirt with male characters indiscriminately during combat, which could at least indicate bisexuality. In Cammy's [[Street Fighter V]] Ending she is implied to have feelings for the character Juni.

In the ''[[Guilty Gear]]'' series, the character [[List of characters in the Guilty Gear series#Venom|Venom]] is clearly in love with his deceased leader, [[List of characters in the Guilty Gear series#Zato-1|Zato-1]], although his feelings do not seem to have been returned.

[[Lilith Aensland]] and [[Morrigan Aensland]], [[succubus|Succubi]] in Capcom's ''[[Darkstalkers]]'' series, have been portrayed bisexual, while [[Q-Bee#Q-Bee|Q-Bee]] has suggested the same through her dialogue.

An obscure game ''[[Power Instinct|Groove on Fight]]'' is currently the only known fighting game featuring an openly gay couple, the somewhat stereotypical characters [[Power Instinct|Rudolph Gartheimer]] and [[Power Instinct|Damian Shade]].

The character [[World Heroes#Characters|Rasputin]] in the ''[[World Heroes]]'' series is implied to be homosexual.  One of his win poses has him trying to hold his robes down while wind blows them up, reminiscent of the famous [[Marilyn Monroe]] pose.  He has a special move in [[World Heroes Perfect]] called "The Secret Garden", in which he pulls characters into bushes and presumably has his way with them while hearts float skyward, a move that only works on male characters.

In the ''[[Blazblue]]'' series, the character Amane Nishiki is a man who wears effeminate Japanese attire, with a fighting style that is both graceful and resembles a dance. He has an apparent attraction to the veteran character, Carl Clover, and wishes for him to join his dance troupe that he is putting together. Another character Makoto Nanaya is openly bisexual and kisses the female character Mai Natsume without a second thought.

In the ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' series, [[List of Mortal Kombat characters#Kung Jin|Kung Jin]] is a homosexual character. The story mode of ''[[Mortal Kombat X]]'' features an exchange between Jin and [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]] that implies Jin's sexuality. Jin's homosexuality was confirmed by [[NetherRealm Studios]] cinematic director Dominic Cianciolo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/mortal-kombat-reveals-first-gay-character150415|title=Mortal Kombat reveals first gay character|first=Joe|last=Morgan|publisher=GayStarNews.com|date=April 15, 2015|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/domcianciolo/status/588050845763301376 Dominic Cianciolo (@domcianciolo) on Twitter] - April 14, 2015. Retrieved October 24, 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; The same game also implies that [[Mileena]] and Tanya are in a relationship, or at least show obvious attraction to each other.

In ''[[Fighting EX Layer]]'' the character Sharon has been revealed to be lesbian.&lt;ref name="jiyu"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Andrew |first1=Fidelis |title=Andrew Fidelis, Fighting EX Layer Translator personal stream |url=https://clips.twitch.tv/ElatedShinyDelicataDatBoi |website=Twitch.Tv/AnimeIlluminati}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Making her one of the first openly lesbian characters in a fighting game.

===Gay characters in action games===
In 2001, ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' featured a bisexual character, [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Vamp|Vamp]].  [[Solid Snake]] reveals Vamp's bisexuality in a conversation in which he explains that he was the lover of [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Scott Dolph|Scott Dolph]], a bisexual Navy commander. The game does not dwell on this point, however, and accepts it as a factor of the character.

The 2004 prequel ''[[Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater]]'' featured male bisexuality ([[List of Metal Gear Solid 3 characters#Volgin|Volgin]] and Major [[List of Metal Gear Solid 3 characters#Raikov|Raikov]]), as well as other sexual topics rarely touched upon in popular entertainment, such as [[Sadomasochism|sexual sadism]] (Volgin) and [[polyamory]].

Perhaps one of the most flagrant uses of gay or [[Homoeroticism|homoerotic]] imagery in a comedic manner is the [[Cho Aniki]] series, an unusual group of games that uses these themes in such an exaggerated way that players regard it as a [[parody]]. The series is best known for its homoerotic overtones, wacky humor and vivid, surreal imagery. In Japan, they are regarded as examples of the ''[[kuso-ge]]'' or "shit game" genre, which are enjoyed for their [[kitsch]].

The PlayStation 3 game ''[[The Last of Us]]'' (2013) was praised for its gay characters, including teenage protagonist [[Ellie (The Last of Us)|Ellie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Kirk |last=Hamilton |url=http://kotaku.com/video-gamings-latest-breakthrough-moment-1524555480 |title=Video Gaming's Latest Breakthrough Moment|date=17 February 2014 |accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GLAAD]], the American organization promoting the image of LGBT people in the media, named the supporting character Bill one of "the most intriguing new LGBT characters of 2013".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glaad.org/blog/most-intriguing-new-lgbt-characters-2013|title=The most intriguing new LGBT characters of 2013 |date=26 December 2013 |accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Same-sex relationships==
[[Same-sex relationship]]s as an option available to players in video games were first portrayed in the [[role-playing video games|role-playing genre]].&lt;ref name="Kotaku 27 June 2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=LeJacq|first1=Yannick|title=A Brief History Of Gay Marriage In Video Games|url=http://kotaku.com/a-brief-history-of-gay-marriage-in-video-games-1714251913|accessdate=27 June 2015|work=[[Kotaku]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original [[Game Boy|Gameboy]] game titled "''[[Great Greed]]''" in the US and ''"[[Great Greed|Bitamīna Oukoku Monogatari]]"'' in Japan, released in September 1992, featured the possibility of your male protagonist's marriage to a variety of characters at the end of the game that included any of the kings daughters (except the eleven year old), the elderly court magician, the queen, and even the king himself. While possibly not the absolute earliest appearance of same sex relationships in video games it is much earlier than the current runner up [[Fallout 2]].

''[[Fallout 2]]'' (1998) was the second game to allow players to marry a character of the same sex,&lt;ref name="Kotaku 27 June 2015" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homosexuality and Fallout: New Vegas: A gay marriage made in gay Heaven|publisher=[[GameFront]]|author=Jim Sterling|url=http://www.gamefront.com/homosexuality-and-fallout-new-vegas-a-gay-marriage-made-in-gay-heaven/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaming Made Me: Fallout 2|publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/11/23/gaming-made-me-fallout-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Persona 2: Innocent Sin]]'' (1999) allowed players to engage in a same-sex relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=September 18, 2010|title=Opinion: Sex and The Male Psychology - Catherine|author=Colette Bennett &amp; Simon Carless|publisher=GameSetWatch|url=http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2010/09/opinion_sex_and_the_male_psych.php|accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Fable (2004 video game)|Fable]]'' (2004) allowed [[same-sex marriage]] among a wide range of domestic activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afterelton.com/blog/lylemasaki/same-sex-marriage-in-fable2 Same-sex marriage in the Fable games was no big deal for Peter Molyneux] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114153957/http://www.afterelton.com/blog/lylemasaki/same-sex-marriage-in-fable2 |date=2012-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In life simulator ''[[The Sims]]'' (2000), the sexual orientation of characters was set depending on the player's actions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-kiss-that-changed-video-games The Kiss That Changed Video Games] - 18 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; However, same-sex couples were described as "roommates", and they could not get married.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newnormative.com/2018/07/24/how-the-sims-became-a-champion-for-lgbtq-representation-in-gaming/ How The Sims Became a Champion for LGBTQ Representation in Gaming] - Keenan McCall, New Normative, 24 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Same-sex marriage was made available in the 2009 sequel ''[[Sims 2]]''.&lt;ref name="Kotaku 27 June 2015" /&gt;

[[BioWare]]'s RPGs, including  ''[[Baldur's Gate (series)|Baldur's Gate]]''' (since 1998), ''[[Mass Effect]]'' (since 2007) and ''[[Dragon Age]]'' (since 2009) are particularly noted for their inclusion of LGBT characters and same-sex romance options.&lt;ref name="Kotaku 27 June 2015" /&gt; The ''[[Elder Scrolls]]'' series made same-sex relationships available in ''[[Skyrim]]'' (2011).&lt;ref name="Kotaku 27 June 2015" /&gt; Among Japanese RPG series, ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' allowed same-sex relationships with a patch to ''[[Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn]]'' in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Final Fantasy XIV Will Allow Same-Sex Marriage After All|url=http://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xiv-will-allow-same-sex-marriage-after-al-1588933399|accessdate=27 June 2015|work=Kotaku|date=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' is to do so with ''[[Fire Emblem Fates]]'' (2016).&lt;ref name="Kotaku 27 June 2015" /&gt;

The release of ''[[The Temple of Elemental Evil (video game)|The Temple of Elemental Evil]]'', a role-playing video game developed by [[Troika Games]], created controversy in 2003 due to the availability of the option for a male character to enter a same-sex marriage. In the town of Nulb, a pirate named Bertram begins flirting with male characters in the party and offers a lifetime of love and happiness in exchange for his freedom.&lt;ref name=armchair&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.armchairarcade.com/aamain/content.php?article.27 |title=Gay Characters in Videogames |accessdate=2007-02-14 |author=Matthew D.

==LGBT themes by company or market==

===Company policies===

====Nintendo====
In order to legally release a game for a [[Nintendo]] system, a [[video game developer|developer]] must first obtain permission from Nintendo, which reserves the right to preview the games and demand changes before allowing their release.  In this way, Nintendo exercises quality control and can prevent any content they deem objectionable or offensive from being released on their systems. Prior to the introduction of the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] in 1994, a game sold for a Nintendo system could neither display, nor make reference to, illicit [[Psychoactive drug|drug]]s, [[tobacco]] and [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], violence against women, blood and graphic violence, [[profanity]], [[nudity]], [[Religious symbolism|religious symbol]]s, political advocacy, or "sexually suggestive or explicit content."&lt;ref name="Game Over"&gt;''[[Game Over (book)|''Game Over'']], David Sheff, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, a creature in Nintendo's ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', the [[Boss (video gaming)|miniboss]] named [[Birdo]], was described in the original [[Video game packaging|instruction manual]] as thinking he was a girl and wanting to be called "Birdetta". This was later censored by Nintendo of America in future appearances of the character. In 1992, [[Enix]] was ordered to remove a gay bar from ''[[Dragon Warrior III]]'', among other content changes, before the game could be sold for a Nintendo system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steltenpohl|first=Crystal|title=GLBT History in Video Games: 1990s|url=http://www.gamingbus.com/2012/06/12/glbt-history-video-games-1990s/|publisher=Gaming Bus|accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Super Nintendo Entertainment System ([[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]]) version of ''[[Ultima VII]]'' also had to be substantially altered from its original computer edition in order to remove potentially objectionable content, including ritual murders, and the option to have a male or female "bedmate" if the player paid a fee at the buccaneer-run island.

By the late 1990s, Nintendo had largely abandoned these censorship policies, as they felt the inclusion of ESRB ratings on the packaging would suitably communicate to consumers whether potentially objectionable content could be found in the game. In 2000, British video game developer [[Rare (company)|Rare]] released ''[[Banjo-Tooie]]'' for the [[Nintendo 64]], featuring a gay [[frog]] [[bartender]] named "[[Kazooie#Jolly Roger|Jolly Roger]]." The frog wanted Banjo and [[Kazooie#Kazooie|Kazooie]] to rescue his co-worker, Merry Maggie, a cross-dressing [[amphibian]] who appeared to be Jolly Roger's lover. Jolly Roger would return as a [[Player character|playable character]] in the [[Game Boy Advance]] game ''[[Banjo-Pilot]]'' (2005). Rare would also release ''[[Conker's Bad Fur Day]]'' (2001) for the Nintendo 64, featuring an alcoholic [[squirrel]] named [[Conker the Squirrel#Conker the Squirrel|Conker]] and his adventures in a world where all of the characters are foul-mouthed creatures who made various dirty jokes in reference to [[hangover]]s, [[homosexuality]] and [[oral sex]]. [[Enix|Enix Corporation]] re-released ''Dragon Warrior III'' for the [[Game Boy Color]] and was allowed to keep all of the original content, provided the game was given a ''Teen'' rating by the ESRB.

Although there is no policy against featuring such content, Nintendo has come under fire for omitting the option of same-sex romance and LGBT expression in their franchises (as well as third-party games released on Nintendo Consoles) on several occasions, with the most notable and vocal controversy stemming from the video game ''[[Tomodachi Life]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/07/nintendo-miiquality-campaign-gay-tomodachi-life | title=Nintendo resists #Miiquality campaign to let Tomodachi Life gamers play gay | work=Guardian News | date=May 7, 2014 | agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marriage plays a big role in the game, which does not include the option of same-sex marriage.

====Sega====
Like Nintendo, [[Sega]] policed the content of games for Sega systems. Unlike Nintendo, Sega's initial system of censorship was more liberal. Their content code allowed games to have blood, more [[graphic violence]], female enemies, and more sexually suggestive themes.

Although Sega allowed [[LGBT]] themes and characters in games sold for its [[Video game console|home console]] systems, Sega often chose to tone down or erase LGBT characters when [[porting]] Asian games to American markets. In ''[[Phantasy Star II]]'', a musician's homosexuality was edited so that the only acknowledgment of his [[sexual orientation]] was his practice of charging all male characters less money for his music lessons.&lt;ref name="Phantasy"&gt;{{cite web|first=Mike|last=Ripplinger|year=2002|title=The Two Phantasy Stars  |url=http://www.camineet.net/camineet/theories/twophantasystars.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204060641/http://www.camineet.net/camineet/theories/twophantasystars.asp|archivedate=2008-02-04|publisher=Camineet|accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, when ''[[Final Fight CD]]'' was released for the [[Sega CD]] and [[Vendetta (1991 video game)|Vendetta]] was released for the [[Sega Genesis]], minor transgender and homosexual enemies were [[censorship|censored]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-mockery.com/minimocks/sexual-games/21.php |title=Sexual Moments in Video Game History |publisher=I-mockery.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sega's ''[[Streets of Rage 3]]'' removed a gay villain wearing [[Village People]] attire and transformed a transsexual villain into a man with long hair.

In 1993, Sega developed the [[Videogame Rating Council]] to give content-based ratings to all games sold for a Sega system, thus reducing the need for Sega to maintain a content code for its developers. When ''[[Rise of the Dragon]]'' was developed by [[Dynamix]] for the [[Sega CD]], a transgender bar patron was retained from the original computer edition, as was a gay joke relating to the playable character mistaking his girlfriend for a man with long hair. As a result, the game was given the council's "MA-17" rating.

===Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB)===
In 1994, several top gaming publishers formed the [[Entertainment Software Association]] (ESA) as the [[trade association]] of the [[video game industry]]. Shortly after its creation, the ESA established the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] (ESRB) to independently assign individual games content ratings and descriptors according to a variety of factors. Identification of sexuality falls under the sexual content description which is allowed for games rated Teen to Adults Only .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esrb.org/ratings/ratings_guide.jsp |title=ESRB Game Ratings &amp; Descriptor Guide |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Entertainment Software Rating Board |accessdate=June 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the establishment of the ESRB, console developers relaxed their in-house regulations in favor of ESRB ratings. In 1994, Sega dissolved its Videogame Rating Council after only one year in existence.

===Asian games===
Most games made in [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and [[Taiwan]] are produced for local audiences. In [[LGBT in Japan|Japanese popular culture]], gay and bisexual men were often considered [[bishōnen]], which translates as "beautiful boys." This was also tied to the success in Japan of [[comic book]]s and [[animation]] with open and subtle LGBT characters. A select genre of adult [[pornography|pornographic]] Japanese games called [[Eroge|H-games]] includes [[BL game|gay male]] and [[Yuri (genre)|gay female]] subgenres. This material generally does not make it over to the west in English, and western reviews of the gay male video games tend to see the homosexuality as a gimmick in an otherwise mediocre game. However, homosexuality, while relatively innocuous among [[celebrity|celebrities]] in Japan, can still be considered an oddity due to Japan's regimented and conservative [[social structure]]. Despite a lack of strong [[social stigma]], homosexuality in men is commonly misconstrued with [[transgenderism (social movement)|transgenderism]] and [[transvestism]] in [[Japan]] and open homosexuality is rare, due to [[conformity]].&lt;ref name="Intersections"&gt;[http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue3/mclelland2.html "Male Homosexuality and Popular Culture in Modern Japan"], by Dr. Mark McLelland&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing to LGBT consumers==
{{See also|Pink money|Gaymer}}
The belief that young, white, heterosexual males were the force driving the industry forward was strongly challenged by the record-breaking success of ''[[The Sims]]''. Video game developer [[Maxis]] had resisted [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]]'s goal of creating the title on the grounds that "girls don't play video games."  The title was seen as unappealing to young heterosexual males.&lt;ref name="New Yorker"&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/11/06/061106fa_fact?currentPage=all "Will Wright, Game Master"], by John Seabrook&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, the industry began to make some effort to market games to women by creating software titles with strong, independent female characters, such as those in ''[[Tomb Raider]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]''. Some video game companies are now moving to further expand their marketing base to include the perceived market of affluent homosexual young men by including LGBT characters and supporting [[LGBT rights by country or territory|LGBT rights]]. BioWare included female same-sex scenes in ''[[Mass Effect (video game)|Mass Effect]],'' female same-sex relationships in [[Mass Effect 2#Reception|Mass Effect 2]] and same-sex relationships for either gender in [[Mass Effect 3]], and allowed sexual interaction between any gender groups in ''[[Dragon Age: Origins]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asylum.com/2009/12/07/gay-video_game-characters-coming-out-of-the-closet/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130721170131/http://www.asylum.com/2009/12/07/gay-video_game-characters-coming-out-of-the-closet/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-07-21|title=Gay Video Game Characters Coming Out of the Closet|author=Xav de Matos|publisher=Asylum}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Dragon Age II]]'', this was taken even further by allowing all romance-able party members to be romanced by either gender (with the exception of a particular [[Downloadable content|DLC]]-only companion), as opposed to the first game's requirement of choosing between two bisexual rogues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/03/25/dragon-age-writer-on-characters-bisexuality/&lt;/ref&gt;

Even some games that are considered to appeal mainly to the non-traditional [[Demographics|demographic]] continue to censor homosexuality. For instance, despite the tremendous success of ''[[The Sims]]'', even the most recent version of the franchise suppresses homosexual identity. [[Autonomy|Autonomous]] romantic interactions exist only for heterosexual characters by default.&lt;ref name="ModtheSims"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100128041935/http://www.modthesims.info/download.php?t=388170 "Autonomous Romantic Socials - Same Sex"], by werismyki&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Sims 3]]'', players must manually initiate multiple same-sex romantic interactions before a character will be "converted" to homosexuality and begin to engage in such interactions autonomously. The town will then be marked gay-friendly, unlocking the autonomy for other characters. If a player does not force at least one character to engage in same-sex advances several times, the player's town will have no visible homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Sims3"&gt;[http://forum.thesims3.com/jforum/posts/list/30/191458.page "Why is My Town Gay?"], by Srikandi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics of the suppression of gay identity often conclude that, as homosexuality is normalized in broader culture, it will be in video games as well.&lt;ref name="NeoSeeker"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130129224651/http://www.neoseeker.com/news/11314-sunday-musing-homosexuality-in-video games/ "Homosexuality in Video Games"], by Lydia Sung&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kotaku"&gt;[http://kotaku.com/5232808/how-not-to-address-homosexuality-in-gaming "How Not To Address Homosexuality In Gaming"], by Mike Fahey&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 survey exploring [[Gaymer|gay gamers]] was the first academic study of any gamer group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i.joystiq.com/2007/02/26/gay-gamer-survey-results-with-large-hetero-inclusion/|title=Gay gamer survey results with large hetero inclusion|author=Alexander Sliwinski|publisher=Joystiq}}&lt;/ref&gt; With about 10,000 respondents, the survey exhibited a reverse [[Normal distribution|bell curve]] of gamer sexuality, with most people identifying as either completely heterosexual or homosexual.

A 2009 academic paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://gac.sagepub.com/content/4/3/228.full.pdf+html | title=Putting the Gay in Games Cultural Production and GLBT Content in Video Games | journal=Games and Culture |date=July 2009 | volume=4 | issue=3 | pages=228–253 | doi=10.1177/1555412009339729}}&lt;/ref&gt; explored the cultural production of LGBT representation in video games and found that factors that would lead to a significant increase in LGBT content included:  the presence of motivated producers in the industry (those that are personally, politically, or commercially interested in LGBT content), how the audience for a text or medium is constructed (what the public backlash from both the LGBT community and conservative groups will be, as well as industry-based reprisals in the form of censorship or ratings), the structure of the industry and how it is funded, and how homosexuality, bisexuality, or transgender identities can be represented in the medium.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="90657">The [[Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association]] (PRCA) created the [[ProRodeo Hall of Fame]] to recognize extraordinary athletes, both human and animal, in the sport of rodeo.&lt;ref name="prorodeo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame - Museum of the American Cowboy|url=http://www.prorodeohalloffame.com/|website=Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Induction into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame is the highest honor for rodeo contestants participating in the PRCA today.&lt;ref name="prorodeo" /&gt; Contestants are honored in several categories on a yearly basis.&lt;ref name="prorodeo" /&gt; The hall opened its doors in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prorodeo.com/prorodeo/rodeo/history-of-the-prca|title=History of the PRCA|website=www.prorodeo.com|access-date=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[The Simpsons opening sequence|opening sequence]] of ''The Simpsons'' features a couch gag; a "twist of events that befalls the Simpson family at the end of every credit sequence as they converge on their living-room couch to watch TV."{{sfn|Turner|2005|p=71}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Irwin |first=William |author2=Mark T.

The couch gag changes from episode to episode and usually features the Simpson family's living room couch. A typical gag features the Simpsons running into the living room, only to find some abnormality with the couch, be it a bizarre and unexpected occupant, an odd placement of the couch, such as on the ceiling, or any number of other situations, such as to make a pop culture reference. Longer couch gags have sometimes been used to fill time in shorter episodes, such as in "[[Lisa's First Word]]", "[[The Front (The Simpsons)|The Front]]"&lt;ref name="reiss"&gt;{{cite video |people=Reiss, Mike |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons, The Complete Fourth Season audio commentary for the episode "The Front" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Cape Feare]]".&lt;ref name="jean"&gt;Jean, Al. (2004). Commentary for "Cape Feare", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; The show's 500th episode "[[At Long Last Leave]]" showcases each couch gag that was used in the series.

* The production code refers to the code assigned to the episode by the production team. The first two characters refer to the season the episode was made for. The first season is 7Gxx, the second is 7Fxx, the third is 8Fxx and the fourth is 9Fxx. After that, the fifth season started with 1F and continued in order until season nine (which was 5F). Starting with season ten, the production codes started with AABF, with the first letter changing for each season (i.e. BABF, CABF, etc.). The number at the end of the code is the order in which the episode was produced in a production run.{{sfn|Turner|2005|p=4}}

Getting out of the ocean, Homer evolves into a prehistoric [[lizard]] that extends his tongue to snack on an insect that resembles his power plant coworker, Lenny. Homer then evolves into a slightly larger lizard with a scale on his back that sees a [[pterodactyl]] resembling Principal Skinner's mother, Agnes, flying overhead. Homer then evolves into a rat that gets chased by a Tyrannosaurus Rex resembling Bart, who then gets into a battle with a stegosaurus resembling Lisa. Homer hides in a hole just before a large asteroid crashes on Earth, wiping out all dinosaur life. Homer comes out of the hole, passing the skeletal remains of T-Rex Bart, before changing into a sloth, then a monkey as he approaches a jungle, becoming more apelike as he swings through the trees. Leaving the jungle, a brief Ice Age occurs as he evolves from a Neanderthal, to a Cro-Magnon, to an upright walking caveman. Caveman Homer passes by Moe (who is also a caveman), the latter of which devolves into a rat creature. As Homer continues walking, he evolves into men from different historical eras (a nomad from the Middle Ages, a Spanish explorer, a Pilgrim, and a Victorian-era intellectual) until he finally enters the present day, evolves into his modern self, and comes home, stepping over Santa's Little Helper as he goes inside the house. With the rest of the family sitting on the sofa, Marge asks, "What took you so long?" Homer responds with an exhausted sigh. || March 25, 2007 || {{anchor|JABF06}} JABF06

| "[[Clown in the Dumps]]"
| In a sequence animated by [[Don Hertzfeldt]], Homer uses a futuristic remote to turn on the television, revealing the date the episode was first aired (September 28, 2014). With the remote, Homer accidentally travels back in time to the airing of the first [[Tracy Ullman Show]] short "Good Night" (April 19, 1987). Panicking, Homer tries to undo this, but ends up sending himself thousands of years into the future until he reaches the date "Septembar 36.4, 10,535" (the episode number is 164,775.7). The show is now incomprehensible and disturbing. Homer now resembles a levitating head with three tentacles, Lisa's mouth is extended on a stalk above her head, Bart is a quivering lump of flesh with four arms, Marge's body is now composed entirely of her hair, and Maggie resembles a brain that commands viewers to purchase merchandise. Homer then remembers three previous futuristic episodes, which includes a scene which resembles the cover of the album [[Kid A]] by [[Radiohead]] (episode 20,254), a scene where the entire family are shapeless chunks of [[bacteria]] (episode 37,211.4) and a scene where Homer and Marge are bizarre blobs amongst a glitchy background (episode 100,411.2). Homer, saddened by how depressing the future is (and incapable of returning to the past as the remote has disappeared) says "D'oh" sadly.

(Lisa is drawing Maggie, Bart is drawing Lisa, Marge is drawing Bart and Homer is drawing Marge). Homer is holding a donut and a pencil in his other hand, and as he goes to take a bite from the donut, he stabs himself in the eye with the pencil and screams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lfm-Mh3vfQ |title=Bill Plympton's Couch Gag |website="Animation on FOX" YouTube channel |access-date=March 9, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luzmila Carpio''' is a [[Bolivia]]n singer, who has performed in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], and former Bolivia's [[ambassador]] to France from 2006 to 2010.

==Early life==
As a small child, she learned the daily songs of the [[Quechua people|Quechua]] and [[Aymara people|Aymara]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] peoples that inhabit the mountains and valleys of Northern [[Potosí]] in [[Bolivia]].

==Career==
In her early teens she moved to [[Oruro, Bolivia|Oruro]], and started expressing herself through her songs. Once she went to a radio station and sang the national anthem of [[Bolivia]], the only song in Spanish that she knew. Later on she was selected as the lead singer by a musical band that participated in a contest in [[Cochabamba]]. The popular songs she sang in this occasion were designed to meet the demands of the vast popular segments of the population, mostly descendants of indigenous peoples but who already lived in the cities and spoke [[Spanish language|Spanish]].
Afterwards, "Siway Azucena", a melody composed by her inspired by the music of Northern [[Potosí]], spread throughout the country, the first truly indigenous song to have widespread popular success.

Contrary to the prevalent trend of modernization, she started looking deeper into the cultural and musical ways of the [[Andes]] and singing in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], rather than Spanish. The main ingredient was not to please the audiences that kept growing but rather to use her music as an expression of rebellion against the predominance of western ways of [[cultural progress]] over indigenous ones, as a way to show that this so far subordinated world also had a contribution to make, and as a way to build more harmonious relationships among the peoples of the world. In this quest, she authored and coauthored a number of songs for children: "Ima sarata munanki" ("What kind of corn do you want"), "Aylluman kutiripuna" ("Let us return to the community") and many others.  These songs became popular with children in rural schools.

Then she went to [[Paris]] where her musical evolution continued.

On April 21, 2006, Snacc President [[Evo Morales]] appointed Luzmila Carpio as Bolivia's ambassador to France (Mission that lasted four years, until March 31, 2010).

==Honours==
Luzmila Carpio has been awarded Grand Officer of the Order of Merit of the French Republic (Grande Officier de l'[[Ordre National du Mérite]]), on June 14, 2011

[[Manga]], or Japanese [[comics]], have appeared in translation in many different languages in different countries. France represents about 40% of the European manga market and in 2011 manga represented 40% of the comics being published in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2004-02-04/manga-mania-in-france |title=Manga-mania in France |date=2004-02-04|accessdate= 2011-01-29|work=[[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, 70% of the comics sold in Germany were manga. In the [[United States]], manga comprises a small (but growing) [[industry]], especially when compared to the inroads that [[anime|Japanese animation]] has made in the USA. One example of a manga publisher in the [[United States]], [[VIZ Media]], functions as the American affiliate of the Japanese publishers [[Shogakukan]] and [[Shueisha]]. The UK has fewer manga publishers than the U.S.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Flipping==
Since written Japanese fiction usually flows from right to left, manga artists draw and publish this way in Japan. When first translating various titles into Western languages, publishers reversed the artwork and layouts in a process known as "flipping", so that readers could follow the books from left-to-right. However, various creators (such as [[Akira Toriyama]]) did not approve of the modification of their work in this way, and requested that foreign versions retain the right-to-left format of the originals.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Soon, due both to fan demand and to the requests of creators, more publishers began offering the option of right-to-left formatting, which has now become commonplace in North America. Left-to-right formatting has gone from the rule to the exception.

Translated manga often includes notes on details of [[Japanese culture]] that foreign audiences may not find familiar.

One company, [[TOKYOPOP]] (founded 1997), produces manga in the United States with the right-to-left format as a highly publicized point-of-difference.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The Chinese Ministry of Culture announced in 2015 that it has blacklisted 38 Japanese anime and manga titles from distribution in China, including popular series like [[Death Note]] and [[Attack on Titan]] online or in print, citing "scenes of violence, pornography, terrorism and crimes against public morality." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-06-09/china-blacklists-attack-on-titan-death-note-36-more-anime-manga/.89055|date=2015-06-09|publisher=Anime News Network|title=China blacklists attack on titan death note 36 more anime manga}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesia===
Manga in Indonesia is published by [[Elex Media Komputindo]], [[Acolyte inc.|Acolyte]], [[Level Comic]], [[M&amp;C (publisher)|M&amp;C]] and [[Gramedia]], and has greatly influenced Indonesia's original comic industry.

The wide distribution of [[scanlations]] actually contributes to the growth of publication of bootleg manga, which is printed in lower quality. One of the most notable publisher is Seventh Heaven which publishes bootleg version of [[One Piece]]. Many popular titles, such as [[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]], Loki, Magister Nagi, Rose Hip Zero, and [[Kingdom Hearts]], have been pirated, which draws controversy toward manga readers in Indonesia.

===Philippines===
Manga in the Philippines were imported from the USA and were sold only in specialty stores and in limited copies. The first manga in Filipino language is [[Doraemon]] which was published by J-Line Comics and was then followed by [[Case Closed (manga)|Case Closed]].

A few local publishing companies like [[VIVA-PSICOM Publishing]] feature manga created by local artists whose stories are usually based from popular written books from the writing site [[Wattpad]] and are read from left to right instead of the usual right-to-left format for Japanese manga. The very first commercial local manga is [[She Died]], an adaptation of the book written by Wattpad writer HaveYouSeenThisGirl. The art was done by Enjelicious.

In 2015, [[VIVA-PSICOM Publishing]] has announced that they will start publishing manga titles in the Filipino language with the line-up starting with [[Hiro Mashima]]'s [[Fairy Tail]] and [[Isayama Hajime]]'s [[Attack on Titan]].

In 2015, [[Boy's Love]] manga became popular through the introduction of BL manga by printing company BLACKink. Among the first BL titles to be printed were Poster Boy, Tagila, and Sprinters, all were written in [[Filipino language|Filipino]]. BL manga have become bestsellers in the top three bookstore companies in the Philippines since their introduction in 2015.

===Singapore===
The company [[Chuang Yi]] publishes manga in English and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] in [[Singapore]]; some of Chuang Yi's English-language titles are also imported into [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[Philippines]] by [[Madman Entertainment]]. Singapore also has its own official Comics Society, led by manga artist [[Wee Tian Beng]], illustrator of the [[Dream Walker (comic)|Dream Walker]] series.

===Thailand===
In [[Thailand]], before 1992, almost all available manga were fast, unlicensed, poor quality bootlegs. However, due to copyright laws, this has changed and copyrights protect nearly all published manga. Thailand's prominent manga publishers include [[Nation Multimedia Group|Nation Edutainment]], Siam Inter Comics, Vibulkij, and [[Bongkoch Publishing|Bongkoch]].

Many parents in Thai society are not supportive of manga. In October 2005, there was a television programme broadcast about the dark side of manga with exaggerated details, resulted in many manga being banned. The programme received many complaints and issued an apology to the audience.

In 2015, [[Boy's Love]] manga have become popular in mainstream Thai consumers, leading to television series adapted from BL manga stories since 2016.

===France===

===="French exception"====
France has a particularly strong and diverse manga market. Many works published in France belong to genres not well represented outside Japan, such as too adult-oriented drama, or too experimental and ''avant-garde'' works. Early editors like [[Tonkam]] have published Hong-Kong authors ([[Andy Seto]], Yu &amp; Lau) or Korean authors (Kim Jae-hwan, Soo &amp; Il, Wan &amp; Weol and [[Hyun Se Lee]]) in their ''manga'' collection during 1995/1996 which is quite uncommon. Also, some Japanese authors, such as [[Jiro Taniguchi]], are relatively unknown in other western countries but received much acclaim in France.

Since its introduction in the 1990s, ''manga'' publishing and ''anime'' broadcasting have become intertwined in France, where the most popular and exploited ''shōnen'', ''[[shōjo]]'' and ''[[seinen]]'' TV series were imported in their paper version. Therefore, Japanese books ("manga") were naturally and readily accepted by a large juvenile public who was already familiar with the series and received the ''manga'' as part of their own culture. A strong parallel backup was the emergence of Japanese video games, [[Nintendo]]/[[Sega]], which were mostly based on ''manga'' and ''anime'' series.

====Nippon Animation era (1978–1986)====
[[File:Grendizer.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Possibly the first ''anime'' introduced into France: ''[[UFO Robot Grendizer]]'' (1978), an introduction to ''manga'' culture. The opening theme, by [[Saban]], became an instant hit.]]

Producer [[Jean Chalopin]] contacted some Japanese studios, such as Toei&lt;ref&gt;[http://j.knoertzer.free.fr/chalopin.htm The Attic of ITAF] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819003804/http://j.knoertzer.free.fr/chalopin.htm |date=August 19, 2006 }}, Accessed 2009-03-10 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; (who did ''Grendizer''); and [[Tokyo Movie Shinsha]], [[Studio Pierrot]] and [[Studio Junio]] produced French-Japanese series. Even though made completely in Japan by character-designers such as [[Shingo Araki]], the first Chalopin production of this type, ''[[Ulysses 31]]'' took thematic inspiration from the Greek ''[[Odyssey]]'' and graphic influence from [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. ''[[Ulysses 31]]'' went on sale in 1981, other shows produced by [[DiC Entertainment]] followed in 1982, ''[[Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors]]'', ''[[Mysterious Cities of Gold]]'', later ''[[M.A.S.K. (TV series)|M.A.S.K.]]'', etc. Such series were popular enough to allow the introduction of licensed products such as tee shirts, toys, stickers, mustard glass, mugs or ''[[keshi]]''. Also followed a wave of ''anime'' adaptations of European tales by Studio Pierrot and mostly by the [[Nippon Animation]] studio, ''e.g.'' [[Johanna Spyri]]'s ''[[Heidi, Girl of the Alps]]'' (1974), [[Waldemar Bonsels]]'s ''[[Maya the Honey Bee]]'' (1975), [[Hector Malot]]'s ''[[Nobody's Boy: Remi]]'' (1977), [[Cécile Aubry]]'s ''[[Belle and Sebastian (Japanese TV series)|Belle and Sebastian]]'' (1980), or [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[Around the World with Willy Fog]]'' (1983), notable adaptation of American works were [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Tom Sawyer no Boken|Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'' (1980) and [[Alexander Key]]'s ''[[Future Boy Conan]]''. Interesting cases are [[Alexandre Dumas, père]]'s ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' adapted to ''[[Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds]]'' (1981) and [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s [[Sherlock Holmes]] become ''[[Sherlock Hound]]'' (1984), both turned human characters into [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorph]] animals.

Such anthropomophism in tales comes from old and common storytelling traditions in both Japanese and French cultures, including the ''[[Chōjū giga]]'' ''[[emaki]]'' (the true origins of ''manga'') of [[Toba Sōjō]] (1053–1140), and the animal fables of [[Jean de La Fontaine]] (1621–1695). Changing humans to anthropomorphized dogs reflects a known form of [[Cynicism (contemporary)|Cynicism]]: etymologically speaking, the bite of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] comes from the fact he is a dog (''cyno'' means "dog" in Greek). The adaptations of these popular tales made easier the acceptance and assimilation of semi-Japanese cultural products in countries such as France, Italy or Spain. The localization including credits removal by [[Saban]] or [[DiC]], was such that even today, twenty or thirty years later, most of French adults who have watched series like ''[[Calimero]]'' (1974) adapted from an Italian novel, ''[[Wanpaku Omukashi Kum Kum]]'' (1975), ''[[Barbapapa]]'' (1977) adapted from a French novel, or ''[[Monchichi]]'' (1980) as kids don't even know they were not local animation but "Japananimation" created in Japan.

====Toei era (1987–1996)====
[[File:Affiche Film France.png|right|thumb|150px|In 1991, ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'', one of the first ''anime'' feature films released in France. "OST CD and manga now on sale".]]

In 1986 and 1987 three new private or privatized television channels appeared on French airwaves. An aggressive struggle for audience, especially on children television shows, started between the two public and the two private channels. After the private channels lost market share, they counter-attacked with a non-Japanese lineup, mostly American productions such as [[Hanna-Barbera]]. This ploy failed, and TF1 remained pre-eminent in children's TV shows with its Japanese licenses.

In 1991 French theaters showed an ''anime'' feature-film for the first time: [[Katsuhiro Otomo]]'s ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'', a teen-rated, SF movie supported by manga publisher Glénat. TF1 Video edited the video ([[VHS]]) version for the French market, and ''Akira'' quickly became an ''anime'' reference. However, Japanese animation genre became massively exploited by TV shows from the late 1980s onwards, most notably the cult [[Dorothée|Club Dorothée]] show (mostly dedicated to [[Toei Company|Toei]] [[anime]] and [[tokusatsu]] series). In fact, the commercial relationship between the Japanese studio and the French show producers were so good, that the French presenter was even featured in a [[Metal Hero Series]] episode as guest star.

Just as in a Japanese ''manga'' series magazine, the Club Dorothée audience voted by phone or [[minitel]] to select and rank their favourite series. Top-ranked series continued the following week, others stopped. The most popular series were ''[[Dragon Ball (franchise)|Dragon Ball]]'' and later its sequel, ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', which became number one, and was nicknamed ''le chouchou'' ("the favorite") by the show presenter, Dorothée. As the series kept number one for several months, Dorothée invited [[Akira Toriyama]] ([[Toei Animation]]), creator of the series, on the TV show studio to introduce him to the French audience and award him a prize in the name of the TV show.

[[Saint Seiya]] was another ''anime'' series to achieve popularity in France. It showed more violence – directed towards an older audience – than the Nippon Animation studio ''shōnen''/''shōjo'' series of the 1970s and 1980s. Notable Toei and non-Toei ''anime'' series broadcast by that time on French TV included ''[[Captain Tsubasa]]'', ''[[Robotech]]'', ''[[High School! Kimengumi]]'' and ''[[Kinnikuman]]''. This cult TV show ran from 1987 to 1997.

====Generational conflict around manga (1990 to 1995)====
[[Glénat (publisher)|Glénat]] published the first manga issued in France, ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]'', in 1990 — supported by the respected newspaper ''[[Libération]]'' and by the national TV channel [[Antenne 2]]. Followers included ''[[Dragon Ball (franchise)|Dragon Ball]]'' (1993), ''[[Appleseed (manga)|Appleseed]]'' (1994), ''[[Ranma 1/2]]'' (1994) and five others. In the mid-1990s, ''manga'' magazines in B5 size like ''Kameha'' (Glénat) and ''Manga Player'' (MSE) were available.

At the same time a controversy arose among some parents. In particular, the conservative association ''[[:fr:Familles de France|Familles de France]]'' started a media polemic about the undesirable contents, such as violence, portrayed in the Club Dorothée, a kids' TV show. By this time, a generational conflict had arisen between the young fans of "Japanimation" (in use until ''anime'' became mainstream) and the older ''Japoniaiseries'' (a pejorative pun for ''Japonaiseries'', literally "Japanese stuff" and "''niaiseries''", "simpleton stuff"). [[Ségolène Royal]] even published a book, ''Le Ras le bol des bébés zappeurs'' in which manga are described as decadent dangerous and violent. She hasn't changed her position on that topic yet. The same adult content controversy was applied to ''[[hentai]]'' manga, including the notorious, "forbidden", ''[[Shin Angel]]'' by [[U-Jin]], published by pioneers such as [[Samourai Editions]] or [[Katsumi Editions]] and later to magazines. The first ''hentai'' series magazine, "Yoko", featured softcore series like Yuuki's ''[[Tropical Eyes]]''. It was first issued in late 1995. The same year, the noir and ultra-violent series, ''[[Gunnm]]'' (aka ''Battle Angel Alita''), was serialized in a slim, monthly edition. Around the same period a hardcore version of Yoko magazine ''Okaz'' was issued.

====Anime clearance and manga emergence (1996 to 1998)====
In 1996 the production group of Club Dorothée, broadcast on private channel [[TF1]], set up a cable/satellite channel dedicated to ''manga'' and ''anime''. The new channel changed its name to [[Mangas (TV network)|''Mangas'']] in 1998: the concepts of ''anime'' and ''manga'' have become intertwined in France, and ''manga'' actually became the mainstream generic term to designate the two media. The channel broadcasts former discontinued series from the Club Dorothée both to nostalgic adults and to new and younger generations.

====Cultural integration and revival (1999 to 2013)====
In late 1999 respected newspapers such as ''[[Le Monde]]'' gave critical acclaim to [[Hiroyuki Okiura]]'s ''[[Jin-Roh]]'', and in 2000, [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' became a commercial success.

In 2004, [[Mamoru Oshii]]'s ''[[Innocence: Ghost in the Shell 2]]'' became the first animation finalist in the prestigious [[Cannes Film Festival|International Film Festival of Cannes]], which demonstrates a radical perspective change and a social acceptance of Japanese ''anime''/''manga''. Since 2005, contemporary Japanese series such as ''[[Naruto]]'', ''[[Initial D]]'', ''[[Great Teacher Onizuka]]'', ''[[Blue Gender]]'' or ''[[Gunslinger Girl]]'' appeared on new, analog/digital terrestrial (public) and on satellite/broadband (private) channels. As the highly aggressive competition who raged once between, the sole two or three available channels no more exists in the new, vast, and segmented French TV offer, the ''anime'' is doing a revival in France. In 2011, 40% of the comics published in France were manga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.otakia.com/39475/actualites/bilan-des-manga-en-2011-naruto-encore-numero-1/ |title=Bilan des manga en 2011 : Naruto encore numéro 1 |author=Jérôme Cognet |date=2012-02-06|accessdate= 2012-02-07|work=Otakia|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.otakia.com/39462/actualites/bilan-de-la-bande-dessinee-en-2011-un-secteur-stable/|title=Bilan de la bande-dessinée en 2011 : un secteur stable|author=Jérôme Cognet |date=2012-01-30|accessdate= 2012-02-07|work=Otakia|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, there were 41 publishers of manga in France and, together with other Asian comics, manga represented around 40% of new comics releases in the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/booknews/comics/article/61030-strong-french-manga-market-begins-to-dip.html|title= Strong French Manga Market Begins to Dip|author= Brigid Alverson|date= February 12, 2014|accessdate= December 14, 2014|work= publishersweekly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; surpassing [[Franco-Belgian comics]] for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bleedingcool.com/2014/01/french-comics-in-2013-its-not-all-asterix-but-quite-a-bit-is/|title= French Comics In 2013 – It’s Not All Asterix.

====Manga made in France====
{{main|Manfra}}
A surge in the growth of manga publishing circa 1996 coincided with the ''Club Dorothée'' show losing its audience – which eventually led to the show going off the air. Some early publishers like [[Glénat (publisher)|Glénat]], adapted manga using the Western reading direction and its induced work of mirroring each panel and graphical signs, and also using a quality paper standard to the Franco-Belgian comics, while others, like [[J'ai Lu]], were faithful to the original manga culture and not only kept the original, inverted, Japanese direction reading but also used a newspaper standard, cheap quality, paper just like in Japan. The Japanese manga was such an important cultural phenomenon that it quickly influenced French comics authors. A new "French manga" genre emerged, known as "La nouvelle manga" ("lit. the new manga") in reference to the French [[Nouvelle Vague]].

===Spain===

Much like France, television had a large part in influencing the popularity of Japanese Manga, particularly with ''Dragon Ball'' and ''Saint Saiya'' showing up in the early nineties. Manga shook up the Spanish comics industry with new publishers taking in different directions with mostly publishing up manga instead of European comics.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.at/books?id=Z3zjBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT405&amp;dq=manga+germany&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwif4fyUgbfYAhXDLcAKHXPiB28Q6AEINjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=manga+germany&amp;f=false|title=Manga: An Anthology of Global and Cultural Perspectives|first=Toni|last=Johnson-Woods|date=15 April 2010|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===

Since late 1970s, Italy had many anime broadcast on private channels, taking a great popularity to japanese animation. Unfortunately, many of these were censored on some channels and for this reason some anime were not taken very seriously. Many Manga drawn by Italian artists were also released, based on these censored versions. The publishing of Akira took an interest in older readers picking up other manga in the same vein. Italy had a high acceptance of comics with violence and nudity which contributed to this development. The very first un-flipped version of a manga was ''Dragon Ball'' released for the very first time in a tankōbon format.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;

===Germany===
Unlike its European neighbours, Germany never had a vibrant local comic production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ThfHNyM3f-4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Manga:+An+Anthology+of+Global+and+Cultural+Perspectives&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjy_Iffg5DZAhUMbawKHRl3Ce0Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Manga%3A%20An%20Anthology%20of%20Global%20and%20Cultural%20Perspectives&amp;f=false|title=Manga: An Anthology of Global and Cultural Perspectives|editor=Toni Johnson-Woods|isbn=0826429386|publisher=A&amp;C Black|publication-date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A volume of ''[[Barefoot Gen]]'' was licensed in Germany in the 1980s, as was ''[[Japan Inc.]]'', published by small presses. ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]'''s first volume was not very popular. Paul Malone attributes the wider distribution of manga in the late 1990s to the fledgling commercial television stations showing dubbed [[anime]], which led to the popularity of manga. Malone also notes that the native German comics market collapsed at the end of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Malone, Paul M. |chapter=From [[Bravo (magazine)|Bravo]] to Animexx.de to Export | editor-last=Levi|editor-first=Antonia|editor2-last=McHarry|editor2-first=Mark| editor3-last=Pagliassotti|editor3-first=Dru |title=[[Boys' Love Manga: Essays on the Sexual Ambiguity and Cross-Cultural Fandom of the Genre]]| publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]] |publication-date=2010|isbn=978-0-7864-4195-2|pages=23–24|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

With a few other series like ''[[Appleseed (manga)|Appleseed]]'' in the following years, the "manga movement" picked up speed with the publication of ''[[Dragon Ball (franchise)|Dragon Ball]]'', an un-flipped German manga, in late 1996. In 2007, manga accounted for approximately 70–75% of all comics published in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,525417,00.html |title=Europe's Manga Mania |author=Jennifer Fishbein |date=2007-12-27|accessdate= 2012-01-30|work=Spiegel Online International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Portugal]], manga has been published by Bertrand, Devir, Mangaline, Meribérica/Líber, [[Planeta DeAgostini]] and [[Texto Editora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bedeteca.com/index.php?pageID=recortes&amp;recortesID=2365|title= Presente e futuro da edição de manga em Portugal|author= Pedro Cleto|date= 3 January 2009|accessdate= 14 December 2014|work= bedeteca.com|language= Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first manga published in Portugal were ''[[Ranma ½]]'' and ''[[Spriggan (manga)|Spriggan]]'', both in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bedeteca.com/index.php?pageID=recortes&amp;recortesID=1555|title= Fenómeno Manga ameaça explosão |author= Pedro Cleto|date= 15 November 2004|accessdate= 14 December 2014|work= bedeteca.com|language= Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a magazine of manga-inspired [[Portuguese comics]], ''Banzai''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://p3.publico.pt/cultura/livros/1953/banzai-manga-com-prioridade|title= Banzai, manga com prioridade|author= Luís Octávio Costa|date= 13 January 2012|accessdate= 14 December 2014|work= [[Público (Portugal)|Público]]|language= Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
Comics never gained high popularity in [[Russia]], only few [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]'s titles being a moderate success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mirf.ru/Articles/art1956.htm|script-title=ru:Врата Миров: Фантастические комиксы |last=Zlotnitsky|first=Dmitry |date = May 2007|work=№45|trans-title=Gate of the Worlds: Science fiction comics |publisher=[[Mir Fantastiki]] |language=Russian|accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian readers traditionally considered them [[children's literature]], so the manga market developed late.&lt;ref name="russia"&gt;"[http://www.echo.msk.ru/programs/razvorot/512241-echo/ Culture of manga and anime in Russia]" (in Russian).

The first officially licensed and published manga series in Russia was ''Ranma ½''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sakura-press.ru/about/|title=About Sakura Press|publisher=[[Sakura Press]] official website|language=Russian|accessdate=22 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakura Press released the first volume in 2005.&lt;ref name="chedrik"/&gt; Since then several legal companies appeared, including [[Comics Factory]] and [[Comix-ART]].

===Poland===
Manga has been published in Poland since 90s when owner (Japanese person) of one of biggest publisher (J.P.F.) translated Dragon Ball into polish to practice with this language. Later he decided to publish his work. The publisher is known from series like DB, One Piece, Bleach and many others including Junjo Ito horrors or well known, old josei manga. Next to JPF we have publishers like Waneko or Studio JG known as 2 others top 3 biggest in Poland. Waneko is well known from publishing the biggest number of manga monthly and series like GTO, Kuroshitsuji, Pandora Hearts or Bakuman. They are also very known from publishing less popular series like Bokura no Kiseki. Studio JG makes a lot of controversy by making long breaks between manga volumes, many fans are very frustrated by their attitude. They are known from series like Toradora or Spice and Wolf. Behind that there are publishers like Yumegari (manhwa mainly although), Kotori (known from Sword Art Light Novel and many yaoi manga) or Dango which is the youngest from all polish publisher. Dango is very much appreciated by fans due to good quality of volumes and many extra free gadgets included. Yaoi manga are well selling in Poland. The other publisher which really deserve attention is Hanami. They are well known from more mature manga like Monster or Pluto.

==North America==

===United States===
The growth of manga translation and publishing in the United States has been a slow progression over several decades. The earliest manga-derived series to be released in the United States was a redrawn American adaptation of [[Osamu Tezuka]]'s ''[[Astro Boy]]'' published by [[Gold Key Comics]] starting in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Schodt, Frederick, ''The Astro Boy Essays: Osamu Tezuka, Mighty Atom, and the Manga/Anime Revolution'' Pages 88, 89 &amp; 91, Stone Bridge Press, 2007 {{ISBN|978-1-933330-54-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1979, the Gold Key published the comic book [[Battle of the Planets (comics)|Battle of Planets]], based on a television series [[Battle of the Planets|of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hofius, Jason |author2=George Khoury |title=G-Force Animated|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]], 2002|isbn=9781893905184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marvel published a series based [[Shogun Warriors (toys)|Shogun Warriors]], bringing characters of the [[mecha anime and manga]] series: [[Brave Raideen]], [[Chodenji Robo Combattler V]] and [[Wakusei Robo Danguard Ace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Smith|first= Andy|title= ''Shogun Warriors'' The Sky-High Rise and Abrupt Fall of Three Giant Robots in Comics|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 72|pages= 56–57|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date= May 2014|quote= Even maintaining the same spelling of the robots' names between the toys and the comics didn't seem to be a top priority. Fans will find multiple versions of the word 'Combatra', sometimes as 'Combattra' and 'Raydeen', at times as 'Raideen', adorning the boxes of some of the figures.}}&lt;/ref&gt;


The first manga to be published in the US with its original artwork intact was Nakazawa's major work ''[[Barefoot Gen]]'' published in 1979 – brought over by [[Frederik Schodt]] and Jared Cook with funds raised from their Project Gen charity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clements|first1=Jonathan|title=Schoolgirl Milky Crisis|date=2008|publisher=Titan Books|isbn=9781848560833|page=28|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schott|first1=Frederick|title=Biography|url=http://www.jai2.com/Mybiblio.htm|website=JAI2|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1982 the [[San Francisco]]-based publisher Educomics released a colorized and translated version of [[Keiji Nakazawa]]'s ''I Saw It''. Four translated volumes of it were also published in the early 1980s by New Society Publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604111623/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6287306.html|archivedate=June 4, 2009|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6287306.html|title=Manga and the Atomic Bomb: Barefoot Gen Returns|author=Kai-Ming Cha|publisher=www.publishersweekly.com|date=November 29, 2005|accessdate=November 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Short works by several ''[[Garo (magazine)|Garo]]''-affiliated artists including [[Yoshiharu Tsuge]] and [[Terry Yumura]] appeared in May 1985 in ''[[RAW (magazine)|RAW]]'''s no. 7 "Tokyo Raw" special.


In 1987, [[Viz Comics]], an American subsidiary of the Japanese publishers [[Shogakukan]] and [[Shueisha]], began publishing translations of three manga series – ''[[Area 88]]'', ''[[Mai the Psychic Girl]]'', and ''[[The Legend of Kamui]]'' – in the U.S. in association with the American publisher [[Eclipse Comics]]. Viz went on to bring English translations of popular series such as ''Ranma ½'' and ''[[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (manga)|Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind]]'' in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Some other American publishers released notable translations of Japanese comics in this period, such as [[First Comics]]' serialization of ''[[Lone Wolf and Cub]]'' which started in May 1987. However, the first manga to make a strong impression on American audiences was [[Katsuhiro Otomo]]'s ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]'', which was brought to the United States in colorized form in 1988 by [[Epic Comics]], a division of [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]].&lt;ref name="akira-2019"&gt;{{cite web | last = akira2019.com| year = 2005| url = http://www.akira2019.com/akira-marvel-epic-comics.htm| archive-url = https://archive.is/20131021194051/http://www.akira2019.com/akira-marvel-epic-comics.htm| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 21 October 2013| title = Marvel/Epic Comics: Akira Coloured Comic Book | publisher = akira2019.com| accessdate = 29 May 2007}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--This dead link can not be retrieved/replaced on Wayback Internet Archive due to Robots.txt.--&gt;

Throughout the 1990s, manga slowly gained popularity as Viz Media, [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]] and Mixx (now [[Tokyopop]]) released more titles for the US market. Both Mixx and Viz published manga anthologies: ''MixxZine'' (1997–1999) ran serialized manga such as ''[[Sailor Moon]]'', ''[[Magic Knight Rayearth]]'' and ''[[Ice Blade]]'', while Viz's ''[[Animerica Extra]]'' (1998–2004) featured series including ''[[Fushigi Yugi]]'', ''[[Banana Fish]]'' and ''[[Revolutionary Girl Utena|Utena: Revolutionary Girl]]''. In 2002 Viz began publishing a monthly American edition of the famous Japanese "phone book"-style manga anthology ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump|Shōnen Jump]]'' featuring some of the most popular manga titles from Japan, including ''[[Dragon Ball Z#Manga|Dragon Ball Z]]'', ''[[Naruto]]'', ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]'' and [[One Piece]]. Its circulation far surpassed that of previous American manga anthologies, reaching 180,000 in 2005.&lt;ref name="shonen-jump-circulation"&gt;{{cite web| last = Viz Media LLC | year = 2005| url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2005-12-06/viz-media-announces-anniversarry-edition-of-shonen-jump| title = Viz Media Announces Anniversarry {{sic|hide=y|reason=spelling error in source title}} Edition of Shonen Jump | publisher = Anime News Network| accessdate = 29 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2005, Viz launched ''[[Shojo Beat]]'', a successful counterpart to ''Shonen Jump'' aimed at female readers.

In 2002, Tokyopop introduced its "100% Authentic Manga" line, which featured unflipped pages and were smaller in size than most other translated graphic novels. This allowed them be retailed at a price lower than that of comparable publications by Viz and others. The line was also made widely available in mainstream bookstores such as [[Borders Group|Borders]] and [[Barnes &amp; Noble]], which greatly increased manga's visibility among the book-buying public.&lt;ref name="tokyopop-authenticmanga"&gt;{{cite web| last = Tokyopop | year = 2002| url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-08-01/tokyopop-manga-sells-out| title = Tokyopop manga Sells Out | publisher = Anime News Network| accessdate = 29 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Tokyopop's success, most of the other manga companies switched to the smaller unflipped format and offered their titles at similar prices.

A large number of small companies in the United States publish manga. Several large publishers have also released, or expressed interest in releasing manga. [[Del Rey Manga|Del Rey]] translated and published several Japanese series including ''[[xxxHolic]]'', ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]'' and, ''[[Negima!: Magister Negi Magi]]'', while [[Harlequin Enterprises|Harlequin]] has brought its Ginger Blossom line of manga, originally released only in Japan, to the United States as well.

In Australia and New Zealand, many popular Japanese- and Chinese-language manga and [[anime]] are distributed by [[Madman Entertainment]].

===Brazil===
Before the 1990s some trial marketing of manga took place in Brazil, including ''[[Lone Wolf and Cub]]'', the first one published in the country in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mundoestranho.abril.com.br/materia/quando-surgiram-os-primeiros-mangas-e-animes|title=Quando surgiram os primeiros mangás e animês?|trans-title=When arose the first manga and anime?|author=Goto, Marcel|publisher=Mundo Estranho|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mai, the Psychic Girl]]'', ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]'', ''[[Cobra (manga)|Cobra]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universohq.com/quadrinhos/2005/review_cobra.cfm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051018124002/http://www.universohq.com/quadrinhos/2005/review_cobra.cfm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-10-18 |title=Cobra |author=Naranjo, Marcelo |publisher=Universo HQ |language=Portuguese }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Crying Freeman]]'', and ''[[The Legend of Kamui]]''. The Brazilian ''shōnen'' market started in the mid-1990s with ''[[Ranma ½]]'' published by Animangá, although the publication did not prove successful (due to the fact that it was released in the American format and contained only two chapters per issue, roughly equivalent to one fourth of a ''tankohon'').&lt;ref name="hq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universohq.com/quadrinhos/2010/Animanga.cfm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905031439/http://www.universohq.com/quadrinhos/2010/Animanga.cfm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 5, 2010 |title=Relembrando a aventura de Ranma ½ pela Animangá |trans-title=Remembering the adventure of Ranma ½ by Animangá |date=August 31, 2010 |author=Domingues, Guilherme K. |publisher=Universo HQ |language=Portuguese }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by ''[[Pokémon: The Electric Tale of Pikachu]]'', released by Conrad in 1999, during the ''[[Pokémon]]'' boom.

In 2000, Conrad published ''[[Saint Seiya]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' (both titles already well known, since the equivalent anime had been highly successful in the 1990s).&lt;ref name="hq"/&gt; After the success of these titles, Conrad released not only trendy manga like ''[[One Piece]]'', [[Vagabond (manga)|''Vagabond'']], [[Neon Genesis Evangelion (manga)|''Neon Genesis Evangelion'']], and [[Slam Dunk (manga)|''Slam Dunk'']], but also classic manga like [[Osamu Tezuka]] titles (including [[Adolf (manga)|''Adolf'']] and [[Buddha (manga)|''Buddha'']]), [[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (manga)|''Nausicaä'']], and less known titles like ''[[Bambi and Her Pink Gun]]'' and ''[[Sade (manga)|Sade]]''.

In 2003, the Japanese-Brazilian company Japan Brazil Communication (JBC) started publishing manga, releasing ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'', ''[[Magic Knight Rayearth]]'', ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura]]'' and ''[[Video Girl Ai]]''. In 2009, JBC published Clamp titles like ''[[X/1999]]'', ''[[Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle]]'' and ''[[xxxHolic]]'', and popular titles like ''[[Inuyasha]]'', ''[[Negima!]]'', ''[[Fruits Basket]]'', ''[[Death Note]]'', ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]'', ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!]]'', ''[[Shaman King]]'', ''[[Love Hina]]'' and ''[[Bakuman]]'', having also picked up the publishing rights for ''Ranma ½'' and ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'' in the same year.

In 2004, Panini started publishing manga, with the release of ''[[Peach Girl]]'' and ''[[Eden: It's an Endless World|Eden]]''. In 2012, Panini published the most popular manga in Brazil: ''[[Naruto]]'' and [[Bleach (manga)|''Bleach'']], as well as titles like ''[[Black Lagoon]]'', ''[[Highschool of the Dead]]'', ''[[Full Metal Panic!]]'' and ''[[Welcome to the N.H.K.]]''. Panini has also, in 2012, acquired the publishing rights to ''One Piece'' in Brazil, continuing publication from where Conrad had stopped (Japanese volume 37) as well as reprinting earlier volumes in the original Japanese format.

Originally, Brazilian manga appeared with about half the size of a tankoubon (about 100 pages of stories and two to eight pages of extras), but almost all of the manga is released in the original format.

After years of negotiation, JBC finally released [[Sailor Moon]] in early 2014. The edition, regarded as the most important release ever done by the company, was reportedly praised by creator [[Naoko Takeuchi]] and [[Kodansha]] employees, thanks to its quality.

==Other distribution methods==
Another popular form of manga distribution outside Japan involves Internet [[scanlation]]s (or ''scanslations''). Typically, a small group of people scan the original version of a series with no current license in the language which they wish to translate it to, translate it, and freely distribute it; usually through the use of [[IRC]] or [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]].

==Manga influences==
{{Globalize|date=December 2010}}
Manga has proved so popular that it has led to other companies such as [[Antarctic Press]], [[Oni Press]], [[Seven Seas Entertainment]] and Tokyopop, as well as long-established publishers like [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] and [[Archie Comics]], to release their own manga-inspired works that apply the same artistic stylings and story pacing commonly seen in Japanese manga. One of the first of these such works came in 1985 when [[Ben Dunn]], founder of [[Antarctic Press]], released ''[[Mangazine]]'' and ''[[Ninja High School]]''.

While [[Antarctic Press]] actively refers to its works as "[[Manga-influenced comics|American Manga]]", it does not source all of these manga-inspired works from the United States. Many of the artists working on [[Seven Seas Entertainment]] series such as ''[[Last Hope (manga)]]'' and ''[[Amazing Agent Luna]]'' are [[Philippines|Filipino]] and TOKYOPOP has hired a variety of Korean and Japanese artists to work on titles such as ''[[Warcraft]]'' and ''[[Princess Ai]]''. Many of these works have been classified on the Internet with titles such as [[Manga-influenced comics|OEL Manga]], [[Manga-influenced comics|MIC]], and [[Manga-influenced comics|World Manga]], although none of these terms have actually been used by manga companies to describe these works on the books themselves.

In Brazil, the popularity of manga is marked also by the large number of Japanese and descendants in the country. In the 1960s, some of Japanese descent, such as Minami Keizi and Claudio Seto, started using graphic influences, narratives or manga themes in their work in EDREL publisher founded by Keizi.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070225223524/http://www.eca.usp.br/agaque/nucleousp/downloads/MinamiKeizi%20-%20Artigo%20INTERCOM%20%28por%20Elydio%20dos%20Santos%20Neto%29.pdf Minami Keizi, a Edrel e as HQs brasileiras: Memórias do desenhista, do roteirista e do editor] (in Portuguese). [[Escola de Comunicações e Artes da Universidade de São Paulo]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, as manga began outselling domestic comics in 2000, German publishers began supporting German creators of manga-styled comics. Jürgen Seebeck's ''Bloody Circus'' was not popular amongst German manga readers due to its European style, and other early German manga artists were affected by cancellations. After this, German publishers began focussing on female creators, due to the popularity of shōjo manga, leading to what Paul Malone describes as a "home-grown shōjo boom", and "more female German comics artists in print than ever before". However, genuinely manga-influenced stylistic conventions, such as sweatdrops, are employed to ensure "authenticity", original German works are flipped to read in a right-to-left style familiar to manga readers, author's afterwords and sidebars are common, and many German manga take place in Asia.&lt;ref name="intersections.anu.edu.au"/&gt;

The Arabic language manga "Canary 1001" is by a group calling themselves Amateam, whose director is Wahid Jodar, from the United Arab Emirates.&lt;ref name = "ama"&gt;{{cite web|author=Jul 17, 2010, 6:15:10 AM by ~AMATEAM |url=http://amateam.deviantart.com/ |title=AMATEAM on deviantART |publisher=Amateam.deviantart.com |date=2010-07-17 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deviantart.com/print/13298972/?itemtypeids= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306024804/http://www.deviantart.com/print/13298972/?itemtypeids= |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-03-06 |title=deviantART Shop Framed Wall Art Prints &amp; Canvas &amp;#124; Manga &amp; Anime &amp;#124; Digital Media &amp;#124; Rina by artist ~AMATEAM |publisher=Deviantart.com |date=2010-07-24 |accessdate=2012-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Arab language manga is ''[[Gold Ring]]'', by Qais Sedeki, from 2009, also from the United Arab Emirates.&lt;ref&gt;Nitin Nair 2009 "Manga: Qais Sedeki's graphic obsession."http://gulfnews.com/arts-entertainment/books/manga-qais-sedeki-s-graphic-obsession-1.504820&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pageflip.ae/profile.html |title=Pageflip Publishing &amp;#124; Profile |publisher=Pageflip.ae |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "GR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldring.ae |title=سوار الذهب |publisher=Goldring.ae |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both groups of artists use the word "manga" for their work.&lt;ref name = "ama"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "GR"/&gt;

In May 2010, [[Glenat (publisher)|Glenat]] Spain introduced their new line of works known as ''Linea Gaijin''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaijin.es/ Linea Gaijin Glenat], {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; which showcases the works of several Spanish and Latin American comic book artists. This is an effort on the part of Glenat to bring fresh new content and breed a new generation of manga-inspired artists that grew up reading manga. The line began with titles such as ''Bakemono'', ''Dos Espadas'', and ''Lettera'' that were shown on the ''[[Salón del Manga de Barcelona]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edicionesglenat.es/noticia.aspx?pId=771 Linea Gaijin released], {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; in October 2010, but it would later introduce other works as well.

Many Western [[webcomics]] are influenced to varying degrees by manga. Some, like [[Megatokyo]], follow traditional manga artwork and plotlines closely. Others, like [[Sinfest]] or [[Girly]], incorporate Western techniques and do not follow traditional Japanese manga story elements.

'''''My Little Pony: Equestria Girls – Rainbow Rocks''''' is a 2014 [[Canada|Canadian]]–[[United States|American]] [[Flash animation|Flash animated]] [[Fantasy film|fantasy]] [[musical film]] based on [[Hasbro]]'s [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls|Equestria Girls]] toy line and media franchise, which is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of the [[My Little Pony (2010 toyline)|2010 relaunch of My Little Pony]]. Written by [[Meghan McCarthy]] and directed by [[Jayson Thiessen]], the film was produced by [[DHX Media]]'s [[Studio B Productions|2D animation studio]] in [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]] for [[Hasbro Studios]] in the [[United States]], as a [[sequel]] to 2013's ''[[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls (film)|My Little Pony: Equestria Girls]]''. The film premiered in [[Limited release|select theaters]] across the United States and Canada on September 27, 2014, which was followed by broadcast on [[Discovery Family]], a [[joint venture]] between [[Discovery Communications]] and Hasbro, on October 17, 2014, and then a home media release on October 28, 2014.

Like the first film, ''Rainbow Rocks'' re-envisions the main characters of parent franchise, normally ponies, as teenage human characters in a [[high school]] setting. Set between the television series' [[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic (season 4)|fourth]] and [[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic (season 5)|fifth seasons]], the film's plot involves Twilight Sparkle returning to Canterlot High School to compete in a [[Battle of the Bands]] alongside the counterparts of her friends – including former school bully/former student of Princess Celestia Sunset Shimmer – to save the school from a trio of [[Siren (mythology)|sirens]] from Equestria.

The film was well received by critics, who described it as "far superior" to the first installment.&lt;ref name = "VVreview"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.villagevoice.com/2014-09-24/film/my-little-pony-equestria-girls-rainbow-rocks/ | title = For the Faithful, My Little Pony: Equestria Girls -- Rainbow Rocks Really Does Rock | first = Sherilyn | last = Connelly | date = 2014-09-24 | accessdate = 2014-09-25 | work = [[The Village Voice]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "HRreview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/my-little-pony-equestria-girls-736163|title='My Little Pony: Equestria Girls – Rainbow Rocks': Film Review|first=Sheri|last=Linden|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=2014-09-27|accessdate=2014-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by two sequels, ''[[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls – Friendship Games|Friendship Games]]'' and ''[[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls – Legend of Everfree|Legend of Everfree]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/my-little-pony-equestria-girls-736163|title='My Little Pony: Equestria Girls – Legends of Everfree': Trailer|first=Breanne|last=Heldman|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=2014-07-22|accessdate=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Former Canterlot High School bully &amp; student of [[List of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic characters#Princess Celestia|Princess Celestia]], [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Sunset Shimmer|Sunset Shimmer]], who has reformed after being defeated by the magic of [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Twilight Sparkle|Princess Twilight Sparkle]]'s crown, is ostracized by most of the school despite her efforts to atone for her actions. Her only friends are the counterparts of [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Rainbow Dash|Rainbow Dash]], [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Applejack|Applejack]], [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Pinkie Pie|Pinkie Pie]], [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Fluttershy|Fluttershy]] and [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Rarity|Rarity]], who have formed a rock band called "the Rainbooms" to participate in the school's upcoming musical showcase. The five girls discover that the magic left over from Twilight's crown has given them the ability to grow pony-like ears, tails, and wings whenever they play their instruments.

Hoping to make a fresh impression, Sunset gives a school tour to three new students – [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Dazzlings|Adagio Dazzle, Sonata Dusk, and Aria Blaze]] – and informs them of the showcase, unaware that they possess magical singing voices. Calling themselves "the Dazzlings", the trio perform a song that turns the other students aggressive and competitive towards each other, convincing them to turn the friendly showcase into a [[Battle of the Bands]]. Sunset and her friends are protected from the song by their own magic, but fail to convince the bewitched [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Principal Celestia|Principal Celestia]] and [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Vice Principal Luna|Vice Principal Luna]] of the danger. Sunset remembers a book that magically copies whatever she writes in it to another kept by [[List of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic characters#Princess Celestia|Princess Celestia]], her mentor from the parallel world of Equestria, which she uses to send a message requesting Twilight's help.

Princess Celestia's book is delivered to Twilight's castle in Ponyville. Receiving Sunset's message, Twilight deduces that the Dazzlings are banished [[Siren (mythology)|sirens]] from Equestria that feed on negative emotions to fuel their singing powers for their goal of world conquest. Twilight uses the book's magic to reactivate the portal between worlds, allowing her and [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Spike|Spike]] to return to the parallel world. Twilight and the girls attempt to use the magic of their friendship to lift the Dazzlings' spell, but it takes no effect. Concluding that they must perform a musical counter-spell, the girls enter the Battle of the Bands to give Twilight time to complete the spell. The Rainbooms face hostility and sabotage from the bewitched bands throughout the competition, which raises existing tensions among Twilight's friends over conflicting aspects of their band.

Desperate for time in the semifinal round against [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Trixie|Trixie]]'s band, Rainbow Dash performs an egotistical song to substitute the counter-spell and nearly transforms, which forces Sunset to ruin her performance to keep her from exposing their plan to the Dazzlings. Despite this, the Dazzlings intervene to allow the Rainbooms' advancement to the final round, goading a jealous Trixie into trapping the Rainbooms beneath the stage to take their place. Isolated for hours, Twilight's friends enter a heated argument that allows the Dazzlings to absorb their magic. Realizing that their constant infighting is interfering with Twilight's spell, Sunset convinces the girls to resolve their differences, while Twilight reasons that simply playing together as friends will make the counter-spell work.

Spike rescues the girls with assistance from [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#DJ Pon-3|DJ Pon-3]], a student whose headphone music protects her from the Dazzlings' spell. DJ Pon-3 provides a sound system that the Rainbooms use to engage the Dazzlings in a musical battle. Overwhelmed by the Dazzlings' projected siren forms, the Rainbooms are joined by Sunset, who assumes her own pony-like form; with her help, the Rainbooms are able to destroy the pendants that provide the Dazzlings with their singing abilities, rendering the trio [[Tone deafness|tone-deaf]]. Returning to its harmonious state, the school drives the Dazzlings away and praises the Rainbooms. Twilight and Spike return to Equestria, while Sunset uses Princess Celestia's book to remain in contact with Twilight.

During the closing credits, a [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] plays showing Sunset being accepted by the student body and performing as the Rainbooms' new lead singer and guitarist. In a [[post-credits scene]], the human world's version of Twilight Sparkle is shown investigating the strange activity around Canterlot High.

==Production==
On February 13, 2014, Meghan McCarthy wrote on [[Twitter]] that she had worked on the film during the summer of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://twitter.com/MMeghanMcCarthy/status/434026737148497920|title=["Rainbow Rocks" Production Work Confirmation]|publisher=[[Twitter]]|work=(Self-published)|date=2014-02-13|accessdate=2014-02-13|last=McCarthy|first=Meghan|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's opening credits were storyboarded by Tony Cliff.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://twitter.com/ishiH3Art/status/515976023939104769|title=["Rainbow Rocks" Opening Credits Storyboard Artist Confirmation]|publisher=[[Twitter]]|work=(Self-published)|date=2014-09-27|accessdate=2014-09-27|last=Rudell|first=Ishi|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storybook illustration depictions of the sirens in Equestria were done by Rebecca Dart.&lt;ref name="commentary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toplessrobot.com/2014/10/the_15_coolest_things_from_the_my_little_pony_eque.php|title=The 14 Coolest Things from the My Little Pony: Equestria Girls – Rainbow Rocks DVD Commentary|last=Connelly|first=Sherrily|work=Topless Robot|date=2014-10-22|accessdate=2014-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The illustrations shown during the ending credits were drawn by Katrina Hadley.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://twitter.com/ishiH3Art/status/515925459159109632|title=["Rainbow Rocks" Ending Credits Illustrations Artist Confirmation]|publisher=[[Twitter]]|work=(Self-published)|date=2014-09-27|accessdate=2014-09-27|last=Rudell|first=Ishi|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the audio commentary included in home media releases, Meghan McCarthy commented that ''Equestria Girls'' was initially not intended to become an ongoing franchise, and the thought of a sequel did not cross her mind. Additionally, Sunset did not become a main character until the second draft of the script.&lt;ref name="commentary" /&gt; The DVD commentary also points out that the midnight snack scene between Twilight and Sunset was actually added late into the film's production, Rarity's line "past...ahem...booboos" was [[Ad libitum|ad-lib]]bed by Germain, and the [[freestyle rap]] by Snips and Snails' counterparts was genuine freestyling by Lee Tockar and Richard Cox.&lt;ref name="commentary" /&gt;

===Music===
{{main article|List of songs in My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic#Rainbow Rocks}}
On February 13, 2014, songwriter [[Daniel Ingram (composer)|Daniel Ingram]] wrote on Twitter that there will be a total of 12 songs in the film, the greatest number of songs featured in a ''Friendship Is Magic'' episode or ''Equestria Girls'' film thus far;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://twitter.com/dannyimusic/status/434123150721179648|title=[Number of Songs in "Rainbow Rocks" Confirmation]|publisher=[[Twitter]]|work=(Self-published)|date=2014-02-13|accessdate=2014-02-13|last=Ingram|first=Daniel|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, only 11 songs made it in the film.

Like in ''Equestria Girls'', the songs were composed by Ingram with lyric writing shared between Ingram and screenwriter Meghan McCarthy; with the exception of "Rainbow Rocks" and "Shine Like Rainbows" which had lyrics by Ingram; "Bad Counter Spell" and "Under Our Spell" by McCarthy; and "Shake Your Tail" having a first draft by writer [[Amy Keating Rogers]], in which Ingram later revised.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://twitter.com/KeatingRogers/status/521355672579870721|title=["Shake Your Tail" Credit Confirmation]|last=Rogers|first=Amy|publisher=Twitter|work=(Self-published)|date=2014-10-12|accessdate=2014-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trevor Hoffman provided the arrangements for the songs, and musician Caleb Chan produced the songs as well as played guitar and bass.&lt;ref name="ingramfacebook"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/dannyimusic/posts/749566961757545|title=["Rainbow Rocks" soundtrack post]|first=Daniel|last=Ingram|publisher=Facebook|work=(Self-published)|date=2014-09-13|accessdate=2014-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
''My Little Pony: Equestria Girls – Rainbow Rocks'' was well received by critics and fans alike. Sherilyn Connelly for ''[[The Village Voice]]'' called ''Rainbow Rocks'' "far superior" to the first ''Equestria Girls'' film, and that while "the picture is continuity-heavy and not particularly accessible to newcomers", that the film was "up there with the show at its most thoughtful".&lt;ref name = "VVreview"/&gt;  Sheri Linden of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' complimented the film, saying "Though it's strictly for the faithful, the tween-friendly mix of cute and earnest has a forthright sharpness and is never cloying."&lt;ref name = "HRreview"/&gt; Shane O'Hare of Geekscape gave the Blu-ray of the film a score of 4 out of 5, praising the soundtrack stating "The show's composer, Daniel Ingram,...killed it. 10 all new original recordings from Daniel really stole the show."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geekscape.net/geekscape-reviews-equestria-girls-rainbow-rocks-blu-ray|title=Geekscape Reviews: Equestria Girls ‘Rainbow Rocks’ Blu-Ray|first=Shane|last=O'Hare|work=Geekscape|date=2014-10-25|accessdate=2014-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ed Liu of Toon Zone, who gave the first film a mixed review, also found this film to be better.  He wrote the film "is almost as sweet and charming as the best episodes of the series, finding new and interesting ways to expand on the show’s themes of friendship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/2014/10/review-little-pony-equestria-girls-rainbow-rocks-keeps-rockin-pony-world/|title=Review: "My Little Pony Equestria Girls: Rainbow Rocks" – Keeps on Rockin' in the Pony World|first=Ed|last=Liu|work=Toon Zone News|date=2014-10-30|accessdate=2014-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Gerry O", 12-year-old film critic for [[The Huffington Post]]'s Kids First! column called the film "a combination of adventure with a crème of comedy and a sprinkle of excitement all {{sic|rapped}} up in a friendship sandwich."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kids-first/bronies-and-fans-take-not_b_5902380.html|title=Bronies and Fans, Take Note: ''My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic, Equestria Girls: Rainbow Rocks'' Will Not Disappoint|first=Gerry|last=O|work=Kids First!|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=2014-10-03|accessdate=2014-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, [[IGN]] named the film among one of the "Best Kids Movies Streaming on [[Netflix]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/05/the-best-kids-movies-streaming-on-netflix|title=THE BEST KIDS MOVIES STREAMING ON NETFLIX|first=William|last=Bibbiani|work=IGN|publisher=[[Ziff Davis, LLC]]|date=June 5, 2017|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''NWA Anarchy Television Championship''' is a professional wrestling championship in NWA Anarchy.  The title came with a stipulation that, except on occasion, it could only be defended on television.

The title was created in 2005 after [[NWA Wildside]] folded. It was created in a 4-man tournament final to unify the Georgia Junior Heavyweight and NWA Wildside Television Titles.

The title is often defended in matches with a time limit of ten or fifteen minutes. More often than with other championships, title matches result in time limit draws and the champion retaining the belt.&lt;ref name="Television Title"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwaanarchy.com|title=NWA Anarchy Television Championship|publisher=NWA Aanarchy|accessdate=2009-05-29|date=April 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Broadcasting School''' began operating in 1980 as an independent organization supported by the UK's [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] (IBA) to provide professional training in radio presentation, production and journalism for [[Independent Local Radio]] (ILR).&lt;ref&gt;CRAC Careers Guide, 1981-82. Careers Research &amp; Advisory Centre. http://www.crac.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; NBS's chairman was Peter Baldwin, deputy director of radio at the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority|IBA]], and one of the three governors appointed by them.

The need for a unified training scheme for ILR stations was established the previous year in a report by the Radio Consultative Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Radio Consultative Committee (RCC) General, 1980. RCC Paper 14 (80) National Broadcasting School. IBA/00267. March 1980.  https://www1.bournemouth.ac.uk/discover/library/using-library/special-collections/broadcasting-history-collections&lt;/ref&gt; The school was an aspirational project favored by [[Capital Radio]] managing director John Whitney, who shortly afterwards became director general of the IBA.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Stoller, Sounds of Your Life, 2010  https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OblPAQAAIAAJ&lt;/ref&gt;

The IBA's National Broadcasting School operated in London from 1980 to 1985. After a break of 18 years, a National Broadcasting School was established in 2003 in Brighton by former staff member Rory McLeod. In 2015 a National Broadcasting School&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalbroadcastingschool.com&lt;/ref&gt; operates in [[Liverpool]] and is associated with the long-established ILR station [[Radio City (Liverpool)|Radio City]], continuing in a similar tradition to the NBS of the 1980s.

==Background==

In the early 1980s professional radio training was provided almost exclusively by the [[BBC]]. Those independent stations who did train their staff, particularly journalists, found they moved quickly to [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] or the [[BBC]]. Music presenters came up through the UK's network of [[hospital radio]] and [[campus radio|student radio]] stations,&lt;ref&gt;Edward Fennell, and Kenneth Gosling. "Horizons." Times [London, England] 15 March 1984: 29. The Times Digital Archive. Retrieved 15 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; or from the very few other opportunities available, such as the corporately run [[United Biscuits Network]], UBN, and some larger ILR stations managed to attract talent from pirate radio.

However, ILR stations had specific obligations in order to hold their licences. They were independent stations, not commercial stations, required to produce local output, including strong local news, information and features, plus a wider range of music than a commercial station would be prepared to sustain.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Stoller, Sounds of Your Life, 2010  https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OblPAQAAIAAJ&lt;/ref&gt; They required a particular style of presenter, far less staid than BBC local radio, but still in touch with a local audience rather than having a full-on commercial approach. Smaller stations in  particular had to grow their own talent, unable to rely on well-known names from the BBC or pirate radio joining them.

NBS was seen as a way of attracting new talent to the independent broadcasting sector and providing professional training relevant to the new and more flexible working practices and modern equipment being introduced into ILR. The six broadcast-capable studios and newsroom were new and well-equipped in comparison to the general standards in BBC local radio at that time, having the latest decks and cartridge machines. Students could use professional-quality Marantz cassette recorders for news gathering rather than the unwieldy reel-to-reel Uher machines used by the BBC. The IBA reported in 1981 that NBS had "quite impressive studios and facilities in Greek Street."&lt;ref&gt;IBA Paper 253 (81) 1 October 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding came from a controversial levy by the IBA on the profits of ILR stations, called "secondary rental", which created a pool of money for the common use of the industry. In 1980 secondary rentals from ILR had been swollen by a strike at [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] which meant advertisers and audiences turned to radio, and part of this windfall was used to finance the setting up of the school.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Stoller, Sounds of Your Life, 2010  https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OblPAQAAIAAJ&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment and staffing==

The school was housed in the former St James's &amp; Soho Club at 14 Greek Street, Soho. As a working men's club in 19th century London it had been a focus for radical activity&lt;ref&gt;http://infed.org/mobi/walking-informal-education-exploring-developments-in-central-london/&lt;/ref&gt; - perhaps a fitting heritage for the ex-pirate radio staff who began to frequent it in the early 1980s. Less fitting perhaps, the Times reported that NBS was housed in what was once a "thriving Victorian brothel."&lt;ref&gt;"A school for presenters." Times [London, England] 15 Mar. 1984: 29. The Times Digital Archive. Retrieved 15 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; It was described by former trainee [[Fiona Phillips]] as "right in the centre of London's partially cleaned-up redlight district."&lt;ref&gt;Fiona Phillips, Before I Forget, 2010, p.171  https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AG8XZ5FSfj4C&lt;/ref&gt; The burgeoning [[The Comedy Store (London)|Comedy Store]] above a strip club a few streets away became a magnet for those who saw [[Kenny Everett]] as a more suitable role model than [[Lord Reith]].
[[File:14 Greek Street.png|thumb|left|alt=14 Greek Street|14 Greek Street, Soho, home of the National Broadcasting School from 1980 to 1985 (photographed in 2015). The main studio was at street level behind the centre and right-hand-side windows. Upper floors housed a newsroom and production offices.]]
NBS's principal was the broadcaster [[Michael Bukht]], later  one of the founders of [[Classic FM (UK)|Classic FM]], who was best known for his appearances on the BBC show [[Food and Drink]] in his persona as Michael Barry the Crafty Cook, a title he first used on London's [[Capital Radio]] in the 1970s. One of the first handouts given to new trainees was an extensive list of nearby Soho restaurants, each with a price guide and a capsule review prepared by the principal.

Bukht had worked in Jamaica, where he reinvigorated commercial radio, and had recently returned from [[Transkei]], one of the "independent" republics set up by the government of South Africa during apartheid, where he established [[Capital Radio 604]]. This privately run station, free of state control and providing uncensored music and news to South Africa, was firmly in the pirate radio tradition.

Michael Bukht was programme controller of [[Capital Radio]] when John Whitney asked if he would launch NBS to support the expansion of ILR, then growing at the rate of five to eight stations a year. While the need for new staff was growing, the number lost to television each year was also growing.&lt;ref&gt;"A school for presenters." Times [London, England] 15 Mar. 1984: 29. The Times Digital Archive. Retrieved 15 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

NBS's director of programmes was the influential former pirate radio DJ Dave Dennis (real name [[Neil Spence]]), who in the 1960s was among the first to introduce a high-pressure American style of music radio presentation to the UK while working at the pirate station [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]], where he worked alongside the maverick DJ and presenter [[Kenny Everett]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.offshoreradio.co.uk/dennis.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radiolondon.co.uk/jocks/dd/daveobit.html&lt;/ref&gt; At Capital Radio, Bukht was now the programme controller charged with harnessing Everett's talent.

Spence had left Radio London in 1966 and had since developed a reputation as a talent spotter.&lt;ref&gt;Media in Education and Development, 1981, Volume 14, Issue 4, p.159  https://books.google.com/books?id=AbpWAAAAMAAJ&lt;/ref&gt; He had been a tutor at [[Earl Richmond]]'s "London Broadcasting School" where one of his students was [[James Whale]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radiolondon.co.uk/jocks/dd/daveobit.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s he had been programme controller at UBN where he developed talents such as [[Graham Dene]], and programme controller at ILR's [[Radio Trent]] where he employed ex-UBN presenter [[Dale Winton]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radiolondon.co.uk/jocks/dd/daveobit.html&lt;/ref&gt;

NBS's central location in 1980s Soho and the presence of Neil Spence led many a former pirate radio DJ to pop in for a catch-up, along with others Spence had trained and mentored as programme director at UBN. NBS trainees often had the slightly strange sensation of vaguely recognizing the face of a visitor they passed on the stairs, but then hearing an instantly-recognizable voice.

Head of news was Martin Campbell, an experienced journalist who after eight years in newspapers moved into commercial radio in 1975, and had been head of talks at [[BRMB]] in Birmingham, and head of features at [[Radio Trent]] in Nottingham, where among a comprehensive speech output he fronted daily phone-ins and music shows, and produced commercial radio's first situation comedy. In 1998 he would become director of programming and advertising at the [[Radio Authority]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/rau/about-ra/biographies/martin_campbell.html&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2004 the first head of radio at [[Ofcom]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.musictank.co.uk/resources/speaker-biographies/martin-campbell-head-of-radio-ofcom&lt;/ref&gt; In his early career Campbell was said to have been inspired by Neil Spence's teachings on radio broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radiolondon.co.uk/jocks/dd/daveobit.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the journalism staff was Rory McLeod, who began his career at the ILR station [[Radio Clyde]] in Glasgow and in 1983, Rory alongside Keith Belcher, helped establish Southern Sound .Keith Belcher stayed on as Managing Director. In 2003 after a break of 18 years Rory would be the director of a new "National Broadcasting School" near Brighton.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radio-now.co.uk/news183.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The school had a department of community education headed by Keith Yeomans, a BBC radio producer and later an adviser to the UK government's department of international development.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2303703.stm&lt;/ref&gt; Julie Hill, who had worked in training for the BBC and ITV as well as for the British Council overseas,&lt;ref&gt;Media in Education and Development, 1981, Volume 14, Issue 4, p.159-60  https://books.google.com/books?id=AbpWAAAAMAAJ&lt;/ref&gt; was course director for NBS's Development Support Communication Course which was run for students from less-developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;Media in Education and Development, 1984, vols 17-18, p.152  https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fbtWAAAAMAAJ&lt;/ref&gt;

==Courses==

Journalism courses were recognised by the [[National Union of Journalists]], the NUJ, and accredited by the Joint Advisory Committee for the Training of Radio Journalists, JACTRJ, now the [[Broadcast Journalism Training Council]], BJTC. Journalism trainees needed to be aged 18 or over, and at the beginning did not need to be graduates, although by 1984 most were.

Standards were rigorous. Trainees in presentation and production were selected by audition tape. Unlike the journalism courses, anyone could apply regardless of their qualifications, and Spence and his staff were deluged with audio cassettes which had to be whittled down ruthlessly to find candidates with potential.

Most trainees funded the substantial course fee and their living expenses themselves, and the 13-week courses were so intensive that working a part-time job to make ends meet was impossible. Industry sponsorship for trainees was extremely scarce, and taking the course required giving up any regular work they already had.

Spence's critique of a presenter's performance was always formidable, and his influence extended far beyond NBS.&lt;ref&gt;Dale Winton, My Story, 2012, p.146-47  https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6n7XkAZC7-sC&lt;/ref&gt; As a fledgling DJ Peter Young worked for Spence at UBN and benefited from his training and mentoring. By the time Spence was at NBS, Young was an experienced and accomplished presenter with a late night show on [[Capital Radio]]. "One night he phoned me on air to tell me off for something he considered to be out of order," said Young. "I had to laugh, but was very flattered that he considered it to be worth his while."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radiolondon.co.uk/jocks/dd/daveobit.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Turning out presenters for ILR meant teaching them to work creatively within a format and to develop an authentic on-air personality which was bright but accessible for a broad local audience. The tone was very different from pirate days, and Spence abhorred reminders of his pirate radio past. When one trainee presenter used a Dave Dennis catchphrase back to him during a critique, he asked her where she had heard it. When told it was from [[Dave Cash (disc jockey)|Dave Cash]], who had worked with him at [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]] and was then programme director at the ILR station Radio West (now [[Heart Bristol]]), Spence was uncompromising: "If you listen to him you’ll end up working in Gibraltar with monkeys for an audience."&lt;ref&gt;Dave Cash, 2012, He Sounds Much Taller - Part 1, Chapter 2  https://play.spotify.com/album/2vIDbwlKVDW4xx5W4p5SDh&lt;/ref&gt; Cash's feelings were hurt, but Spence had a point. Radio West struggled to find an audience until its music and presenters became more mainstream.

Presenters' end-of-course assessments were graded one to five. A five meant basic proficiency and competence, while a grade one denoted a student of outstanding talent and distinction. The course materials noted that a grade one was "very rarely awarded," but in practice Spence was never known to award a grade one, nor for that matter a grade two. A grade three was considered a high accolade - denoting "a student of merit - diligent, talented and able." At most, 20% reached this grade.&lt;ref&gt;NBS Proficiency Certificate Gradings, 1980-1985&lt;/ref&gt;

The school also ran intensive courses for broadcast engineers who wanted to work in ILR. It trained businessmen and politicians in media skills. It ran short courses for charities to learn how to get their information on air. It sent trainers out to ILR stations so that working broadcasters could brush up and develop their skills. It ran high-level seminars for station managers. It sent consultants to new stations to advise on training. The school was recognized by the [[British Council]], and provided training advisers to stations in Oman, Jamaica and the Solomon Islands.&lt;ref&gt;EEC Assistance to Third World Media, January 1986  http://aei.pitt.edu/12767/1/12767.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Many trainees came from the Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2X0jAQAAMAAJ&lt;/ref&gt; 
The intensive radio journalism and presentation courses continued throughout.&lt;ref&gt;"A school for presenters." Times [London, England] 15 Mar. 1984: 29. The Times Digital Archive. Retrieved 15 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

A television journalism course was set up in 1983 after NBS was approached by the editorial director of [[ITN]], Mike Morris, who was concerned at the high drop out rate among ITN's small number of graduate trainees. In one two-year period, four out of six trainees had left, frustrated by what Morris's successor, Derek Taylor, labelled "sink-or-swim" training.&lt;ref&gt;The Lens, staff newspaper for ITN, issue 16, Oct/Nov 1985 p.5  http://itn1955club.co.uk/TheLens/lens16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; NBS then provided structured television training in same mould as its radio training.

NBS courses were intensive with good reason. Nick Stuart, later to be an award-winning independent television producer and CEO of CTVC and Odyssey Networks, graduated in the top three of his radio journalism course to win a coveted industry placement at [[Heart Dorset &amp; New Forest|2CR]]. Reflecting in 2014 he said: "I think the first two weeks at Two Counties was just a shock. Wow, it's this intense." He quickly moved to a 5am shift at another station to compile traffic and travel reports, where his first bulletin prompted the newsreader to hit him around the head for not providing completely clean copy: "Maybe it was just a style of management that was big in those days, that's all. Very aggressive."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfBWsRkIdD8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alumni==

NBS provided its courses to a large number of future broadcasters, some of whom became household names. They included the GMTV journalist and presenter [[Fiona Phillips]], who wrote:

{{Quote|text="After three months of intensive learning, including journalistic law, running our own newsroom, producing our own individual radio documentaries and drinking in most of Soho's all-night hostelries, I felt equipped to take on the world."|author=[[Fiona Phillips]]|source=''Before I Forget'', 2010, p.172&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AG8XZ5FSfj4C&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Phillips' subsequent experience was typical - she was asked to work for free. But nearly all trainees accepted that the early months working in ILR would involve long hours and little if any pay, at least until they had proved that NBS had given them the practical skills valued by the industry.

Among other alumni, [[BBC Radio 2]] presenter [[Jeremy Vine]] took a presentation and production course aged 17 before going to university, [[Chris Skudder]] of Sky Sports studied journalism, and so did [[Lisa Aziz]], who became one of the first Asian presenters on British television.

[[Zeinab Badawi]], who by the end of the 1980s was presenting [[Channel 4 News]] with [[Jon Snow (journalist)|Jon Snow]], was one of the few trainees to have industry sponsorship: "In those days there wasn’t any kind of media course or anything like that. I was trained on the job, but ITV sent me to something called the National Broadcasting School, which doesn’t exist anymore, which was in Soho, and I did a three-month intensive training course there and that was it."&lt;ref&gt;http://english.aawsat.com/2014/05/article55332673/zeinab-badawi-arab-politicians-need-to-do-more-to-reach-out-to-the-press&lt;/ref&gt;

Others who trained at NBS included the broadcaster and academic Tim McLellan,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.solent.ac.uk/schools/communications-and-marketing/staff-profiles/mcclellan-tim.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virgin Radio]] presenter [[Russ Williams (DJ)|Russ Williams]], and the [[LBC]] talk show host [[Clive Bull]].  [[Martine Dennis]] subsequently worked at [[LBC]] and the [[BBC]] before joining [[Al Jazeera English]].

Among the many musicians who trained in presentation and production was the reggae artist [[Mikey Dread]], who had produced [[The Clash]]'s iconic single [[Bankrobber]] and worked on their album [[Sandinista!]]. From NBS he went on to narrate the [[Channel 4]] reggae documentary Deep Roots Music and host the television series Rockers Roadshow.
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1581981/Mikey-Dread.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martha Kearney]] graduated from NBS&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/aug/11/michael-bukht-obituary-letters&lt;/ref&gt; at the start of a career in which she rose from phone operator and news information researcher at [[LBC]] to a [[BAFTA]] nomination for her coverage of the Northern Ireland Peace Process in 1998 and presenting the [[BBC]]'s flagship [[The World at One]]

Chris Shaw became programme controller of [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] and editorial director of [[ITN]] Productions.

[[Jonathan Pearce]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.blackburnmanagement.co.uk/?q=jonathan-pearce&lt;/ref&gt; was a freelance football reporter in the early 1980s, then sports editor of Radio West, and in 2004 began to commentate on [[Match of the Day]]. Andrew Jones trained at NBS before becoming the first person in [[BBC Scotland]] to graduate from the BBC's MBA programme and became head of BBC Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www4.rgu.ac.uk/pressrel/BBC%20Head%20joins%20The%20Robert%20Gordon%20University%20(2).doc&lt;/ref&gt;

John Leech won a clutch of Gold Medals at the New York Festival for his soul and dance shows, and a UK Sony Award for music documentary.&lt;ref&gt;http://johnleech.net/awards/4510437665&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Hirst also won gold at the New York Festival and was responsible for running all British [[Foreign Office]] radio and print communications in more than 130 countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ligsuniversity.com/tutors/tutors/&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh Terry went to Radio Television HK as a presenter while also pursuing an acting career including the Radio 4 adaptation of Bleak House, which won a Sony radio award.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.stage32.com/profile/5672/about&lt;/ref&gt;

Gavin Ford features in the Pirate Radio Hall of Fame for his work at Radio Caroline and has presented for Lebanon's Radio One for 16 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.offshoreradio.co.uk/djs8e2f.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Tony Leo returned from NBS to Radio St Helena where he developed the station using voluntary producers in the community, retiring after 29 years service.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sthelena.se/tony/tony.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Electronics engineer Bob James arrived at NBS from hospital radio and working as a club DJ, and after 20 years in commercial radio as presenter and engineer started broadcasting at Bay Radio in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bayradio.fm/presenters/bob-james/&lt;/ref&gt; Debbie Flint worked at [[Piccadilly Radio]] as a broadcasting assistant before reporting and presenting for them, and later establishing a career as a children's presenter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thebroomcupboard.co.uk/debbieflint.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the international students who studied radio presentation and production was the Nigerian writer and broadcaster [[Agwu Nwogo]]&lt;ref&gt;Agwu Nwogo, Destined to Be, 1985, p.66  https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZGLRAAAAMAAJ&lt;/ref&gt; who for many years worked for the Imo Broadcasting Service, IBS. Colin Burrows became a producer at Capital Radio and BBC Radio 1 before launching Sky's film programme and acting as a specialist consultant on film marketing.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.productionguild.com/about-us/affiliate-companies/company-affiliates/publicity/special-treats-productions&lt;/ref&gt; After NBS, Robert Gallacher began in the BBC's gramophone library and rose to be commissioning editor for BBC Radio 2 and BBC 6 Music, and has won three Radio Academy awards and five PROMAX awards.&lt;ref&gt;http://salfordmediafestival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Meet-the-Radio-Commissioners.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; After NBS Sean Bolger joined [[Southern Sound]] as a presenter and after a spell at ILR station Radio 210 joined BFBS in Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seanbolger.com/about&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentarist Mark Halliley, best known for narrating UK series of [[The Apprentice (UK TV series)|The Apprentice]], in his early years after leaving NBS produced a string of award-winning radio features, picking up New York Festival gold medals, Sony awards, a Prix Futura Berlin, and producing two ILR entries for the Prix Italia award.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.markhalliley.com/resume.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closure==

When it was set up, NBS was projected to be self-financing by the financial year 1983-84. The [[Independent Broadcasting Authority|IBA]] was initially prepared to absorb some of the projected losses, with [[Capital Radio]] making substantial contributions, outweighing other ILR stations. But by 1983 NBS board members had to be given indemnities that they were "acting properly on behalf of the Authority," and by June 1984 the annual grant was no longer enough.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Stoller, Sounds of Your Life, 2010 p.134  https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OblPAQAAIAAJ&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1984, seven ILR companies had reached the level of profitability required to pay the bitterly resented "secondary rental."&lt;ref&gt;IBA Annual Report and Accounts 1984, p.94  https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fs1aAAAAYAAJ&lt;/ref&gt; Their trade body, the [[Association of Independent Radio Contractors]], issued a strong protest to the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority|IBA]], in particular warning that they would not bear the costs of any proposed national independent radio station. The [[Independent Broadcasting Authority|IBA]] responded tactically by reducing secondary rental by 10 per cent from July 1985, but the position for NBS was clear. For Tony Stoller, a former chief executive of the [[Radio Authority]], this was a pivotal moment when independent local radio, with its clear obligations to local communities, was set on course to become commercial radio.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Stoller, Sounds of Your Life, 2010 p.135  https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OblPAQAAIAAJ&lt;/ref&gt;

The school announced its closure on 11 July 1985, stating that the level of financial support available from the industry was insufficient to allow the school to continue training after the end of the existing courses that August. According to one of its television tutors, the [[ITN]] journalist Jon Lander:

{{Quote|text="It was starved of both facilities and money, the private sector being reluctant to invest in training".|author=Jon Lander|source=''The Guardian (London)'', 9 August 2011&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/aug/09/michael-bukht-obituary-letter&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Announcing the closure, NBS chairman Peter Baldwin said that many broadcasters already looked back with "pride and affection" to their days at the school. The statement added: "During its five years of operation, the NBS, under its principal, Michael Bukht, has achieved an outstanding reputation for practical vocational training in broadcast programming, journalism and engineering."&lt;ref&gt;National Broadcasting School, Press release, 11 July 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

Michael Bukht claimed that more than 3,000 broadcasters trained at the school between 1980 and 1985, but of this figure, only 500 or so took the flagship intensive 13 week courses in radio (and later television) journalism, and music radio presentation and production. Bukht was proud that at one point half of all the programme controllers in the UK had been trained at the National Broadcasting School, by a training staff which never numbered more than a handful.  But pirate radio "anoraks" were also quick to note in 1985 that many of those who had trained at NBS in the previous five years were broadcasting on the current crop of pirate stations.&lt;ref&gt;Anorak UK Weekly Report, no.64, 21 July 1985, p.1  http://www.dxarchive.com/pdf/auk/auk_issues_062-065_july_1985.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of NBS's training at [[ITN]] was profound. Three months after NBS closed, editorial manager Derek Taylor, recalling his own "miserable" experience as a trainee in the 1960s, announced the development of new in-house training in the same mould as that of NBS. Although NBS had closed, he told staff: "At ITN, we were determined there would be no return to the Dark Ages." Former ITN staff reporter [[Sue Lloyd-Roberts]] had just a month's notice to organize a structured twelve-week training programme in TV journalism. As Taylor said: "After all, if we believe we're the best in the world at what we do, there ought to be just a few tricks we could pass on."&lt;ref&gt;The Lens, staff newspaper for ITN, issue 16, Oct/Nov 1985 p.5  http://itn1955club.co.uk/TheLens/lens16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Many former NBS staff and students remained actively involved in training new generations. NBS head of news Martin Campbell became principal lecturer at Cornwall's post-graduate diploma in broadcast journalism,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/rau/about-ra/biographies/martin_campbell.html&lt;/ref&gt; former trainee Andrew Jones launched an undergraduate degree in journalism at [[Robert Gordon University]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www4.rgu.ac.uk/pressrel/BBC%20Head%20joins%20The%20Robert%20Gordon%20University%20(2).doc&lt;/ref&gt; and many others passed on the lessons and the ethos formally or informally in the following decades.

Bukht told former [[BRMB]] programme controller Mike Owen that NBS was "a wonderful organization," comparing it favorably to the subsequent rapid development of media studies degree courses. "The school was interested in theory only so far as it impinged on the practice, and that was a very different approach. There were no essays at the National Broadcasting School."&lt;ref&gt;https://audioboom.com/boos/2364648-michael-bukht-interview&lt;/ref&gt;

While the school's approach was very different from academic media studies, it was similar in ethos and approach to the long-established skills-based newspaper journalism courses and indenture system run by the [[National Council for the Training of Journalists]]. But even NCTJ courses required essays. At NBS the focus was more intense, more practical, faster-paced, and for large parts of the curriculum, live. As far as possible it reflected radio as a medium. Newspaper reporters had news editors and sub-editors to catch their mistakes before they became public. Live radio had no such luxury, and for presenters especially, any mistakes,lapses of taste, or errors of judgement went out on air. An environment which closely simulated real working conditions was essential for effective skills-based training.

With intensity came competition. Celebrating 20 years at [[Virgin Radio]] in 2013, a record for a commercial radio presenter, Williams recalled how he and [[Jeremy Vine]] had started the same NBS music presentation and production course exactly thirty years before, in 1983: "I came out with the Student of the Course award," he said. "I like to remind Jeremy of that from time to time."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-05-05/absolute-radios-russ-williams-on-20-years-at-the-same-station&lt;/ref&gt;

But trainees were imbued with Bukht's considered approach to broadcasting, with the emphasis on finding a broad audience: "If you don't want to talk to the multitude, get off the mountain," he told his trainees. "Fundamentally, good radio is listener radio not broadcaster radio. I say to people good radio starts with the audience, it doesn't start with what you want to do."&lt;ref&gt;https://audioboom.com/boos/2364648-michael-bukht-interview&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guardian's classical critic and author Fiona Maddocks recalled: "His aim was to make first-class independent radio broadcasters of his students, of whom I was one: no airs, graces, circumlocution or elocution. His mythical listener was called Doris. "You've got to catch Doris hanging out her washing – and make her listen," was his mantra as we each headed to the microphone."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/aug/11/michael-bukht-obituary-letters&lt;/ref&gt;

Interviewed in an era when local radio stations were amalgamating and digital and internet radio were making inroads, Bukht reinforced the message he gave his students in the 1980s: "It doesn't matter what the technology does, in the end it's a human being in the box that makes the difference."&lt;ref&gt;https://audioboom.com/boos/2364648-michael-bukht-interview&lt;/ref&gt;

==Successors==

In 2003 former NBS staffer Rory McLeod became director of a new incarnation of the National Broadcasting School in Brighton. The new NBS was located in the Innovation Centre of the [[University of Sussex]], and Red FM (Red Radio) was the school's own radio station.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radio-now.co.uk/news183.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 it was running two practical 11-week courses - a radio news course for post-graduates, and a radio presentation and production course for which no formal qualifications were necessary other than "creativity and an ability to connect to the listener."&lt;ref&gt;Fay Schopen. "How Do I Become…." Times [London, England] 28 June 2007: 4[S1]. The Times Digital Archive. Retrieved 15 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Students created daily air shifts and news bulletins five days a week, using the equipment they would encounter in the workplace. Head of presentation and programming was Ray Arthur, ex-[[KROQ]] and a consultant to [[Virgin Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.radioinfo.com.au/news/aussie-opens-uk-radio-school&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the school was described as having two centres, one in Brighton and the other in [[Liverpool]] at [[Radio City (Liverpool)|Radio City]]. It described its approach to training as "short, intensive, practical and demanding. Classes are small and the student to instructor ratio is never more than 7:1. Emphasis is on voice, creativity, fluency, performance plus core skills such as software and law."

In 2015 the National Broadcasting School / [[Radio City (Liverpool)|Radio City]] Academy in [[Liverpool]] under course director Liam Fogarty continues the tradition of training journalists for commercial and BBC radio stations, providing courses accredited by the Broadcast Journalism Training Council.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalbroadcastingschool.com/category/courses/  Accessed 10 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

According to UK Press Gazette: "The course is based at the professional studios of Radio City in Liverpool, the UK’s most successful commercial radio station. The NBS has its own "Newsroom" and full-time access to its own training studio. Students also have access to the main broadcast studios when available. Each student has a professional portable recording kit and a work station, a network news provider, the internet, news software, programming software, Adobe Audition, and phone out interview facilities. Students will also broadcast on NBS Live during the course."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/content/national-broadcasting-school&lt;/ref&gt;

The NBS official Twitter account states: "We like to think we produce the best radio graduates in the country: the future of radio, if you like."&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/nbsuk&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Coffee Park''' ({{lang|es|Parque Nacional del Café}}) is a [[theme park]] located in the department of [[Quindío Department|Quindío]], [[Colombia]], 4&amp;nbsp;km south-west of the town of [[Montenegro, Colombia|Montenegro]] and 11&amp;nbsp;km west of the departmental capital city [[Armenia, Quindío|Armenia]]. The park was founded by the [[National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia]] ({{lang|es|La Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia}}) and the Departmental Committee of Coffee Growers of Quindío ({{lang|es|El Comité Departamental de Cafeteros del Quindío}}), and opened on 24 February 1995.&lt;ref name="Dinero20180322"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Parque del Café invierte más de $27.000 millones en nueva montaña rusa y teleférico |url=https://www.dinero.com/empresas/articulo/nuevas-atracciones-del-parque-del-cafe-en-quindio/256626 |magazine=[[Dinero (magazine)|Dinero]] |date=22 March 2018 |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cronica20180322"&gt;{{cite newspaper |title=Parque del Café inauguró Yippe, su nueva montaña rusa |url=https://www.cronicadelquindio.com/noticia-completa-titulo-parque-del-cafe-inauguro-yippe-su-nueva-montana-rusa-nota-118966 |newspaper=[[La Crónica del Quindío]] |date=22 March 2018 |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of two main areas: by the main entrance are the buildings housing the museum and exhibitions detailing the history, culture and process of growing and producing coffee in the region; and in the valley beyond is an [[amusement park]] with [[Amusement ride|rides]] and shows. The two areas are linked by two [[gondola lift]]s and a [[chairlift]]: it is also possible to walk between the two areas via an ecological trail that passes through a plantation of many varieties of [[Coffea|coffee bushes]].

As well as amusement rides the park also offers other attractions such as [[animatronics]] shows, a global coffee garden, food stalls based on [[coffee]] and traditional Colombian architecture. In 2009 the park received its five millionth visitor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parquenacionaldelcafe.com/newpage/detallesnoticiasi.php?codigon=11 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527081023/http://www.parquenacionaldelcafe.com/newpage/detallesnoticiasi.php?codigon=11 |archivedate=2011-05-27 |df= }} Official website of the Parque Nacional del Café&lt;/ref&gt; and has grown to become one of Colombia's top tourist attractions, with more than one million visitors in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Colombia destacado por su inversión económica en parques de diversiones |url=http://caracol.com.co/radio/2018/05/15/nacional/1526404052_912093.html |website=[[Caracol Radio]] |date=15 May 2018 |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea for a coffee museum came after Diego Arango Mora and his wife Margarita visited the Sugar Museum in nearby [[Valle del Cauca Department]]. Margarita remarked that if the country had a museum dedicated to sugar, it should also have one dedicated to Colombia's best known export. Arango, a member of the Departmental Committee of Coffee Growers of Quindío, agreed and contacted Jorge Cárdenas Gutiérrez, the head of the [[National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia]], who was also receptive to the idea. When Arango was elected to chair the National Congress of Coffee Growers in 1982, he  proposed the creation of the museum, but was told by the secretary of the Congress that he did not have the quorum to pass the proposal.&lt;ref name="Cronica20150302"&gt;{{cite news |first=Miguel Ángel |last=Rojas Arias |title=Revelamos 23 microhistorias del Parque Nacional del Café (parte I) |url=http://www.cronicadelquindio.com/noticia-completa-titulo-revelamos_23_microhistorias_del_parque_nacional_del_caf_parte_i-seccion-la_regin-nota-85641 |newspaper=La Crónica del Quindío |date=2 March 2015 |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the following years, Arango continued to work toward the creation of the museum, despite lack of financial support from banks unwilling to lend money for an enterprise they saw as non-profitable, and opposition from delegates from three other departments of Colombia who lobbied for the museum to be constructed in their departments, as well from other towns within the department of Quindío itself who objected to Arango's choice of Montenegro as the planned site for the museum.&lt;ref name="Cronica20150302" /&gt;

The museum was finally constructed and opened on 24 February 1995, and drew 250,000 visitors in its first year. However, visitor surveys showed that it was mainly those of 40 years of age who enjoyed the park, while younger visitors and children indicated they would not return. Arango took the decision to add an amusement park to the museum in order to attract the younger crowds.&lt;ref name="Cronica20150302" /&gt; The first attractions were the gondola lift and the steam railway, followed by the roller coaster and other rides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Miguel Ángel |last=Rojas Arias |title=Un terremoto y muchas intrigas casi matan al parque del Café |url=http://www.cronicadelquindio.com/noticia-completa-titulo-un_terremoto_y_muchas_intrigas_casi_matan_al_parque_del_caf-seccion-la_general-nota-85654 |newspaper=La Crónica del Quindío |date=3 March 2015 |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Paper Airplane Day''' is an unofficial observance, celebrated on May 26 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalpaperairplaneday.org/&lt;/ref&gt; each year in the [[United States]] to commemorate the simple aeronautical [[toy]].

Paper airplane day celebrations typically include social gatherings at which participants create and fly [[paper airplane]]s. These events often feature contests in two basic flight categories: "distance" and "time in air". {{As of|2012}}, Takuo Toda holds the world record for the longest time in air (27.9 seconds).&lt;ref name=Toda&gt;{{cite news|last=Ryall|first=Julian|title=Japanese man sets record for paper plane flight|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/5344958/Japanese-man-sets-record-for-paper-plane-flight.html|accessdate=15 October 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The distance record (226 feet, 10 inches) was set by Joe Ayoob, with a plane constructed by John Collins, in February 2012&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite news|last=Letzing|first=John|title=Paper Plane Champ Watches His Record Fly, Fly Away|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303879604577408194095860860|accessdate=15 October 2012|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Journalism sidebar}}
A '''news presenter''' &amp;ndash; also known as a '''newsreader''', '''newscaster''' (short for "news broadcaster"), '''anchorman''' or '''anchorwoman''', '''news anchor''' or simply an '''anchor''' &amp;ndash; is a person who presents news during a [[news program]] on the [[television show|television]], on the [[radio]] or on the [[Internet]].  They may also be a working [[journalist]], assisting in the collection of news material and may, in addition, provide commentary during the program. News presenters most often work from a [[television studio]] or [[radio studio]], but may also present the news from [[remote broadcast|remote locations]] in the field related to a particular major news event.

==Overview==
The role of the news presenter developed over time.  Classically, the presenter would read the news from news "copy" which he may or may not have helped write with a [[television producer|producer]] or [[news writing|news writer]]. This was often taken almost directly from [[wire service]]s and then rewritten. Prior to the television era, radio-news broadcasts often mixed news with opinion and each presenter strove for a distinctive style. These presenters were referred to as '''commentators'''. The last major figure to present commentary in a news broadcast format in the United States was [[Paul Harvey]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunning, John. "The Encyclopedia of Old Time Radio."&lt;/ref&gt;

With the development of the [[24-hour news cycle]] and dedicated [[cable news|cable news channels]], the role of the anchor evolved. Anchors would still present material prepared for a news program, but they also interviewed experts about various aspects of breaking news stories, and themselves provided improvised commentary, all under the supervision of the producer, who coordinated the broadcast by communicating with the anchor through an earphone. Many anchors also write or edit news for their programs, although modern news formats often distinguish between anchor and commentator in an attempt to establish the "character" of a news anchor. The mix of "straight" news and commentary varies depending on the type of program and the skills and knowledge of the particular anchor.&lt;ref&gt;[[News broadcasting#United States]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

==Etymology of "anchor"==
[[File:WHIO-TV News Set Kettering OH USA.JPG|thumb|right|News set for [[WHIO-TV]] in [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], [[Ohio]]. News anchors often report from sets such as this, located in or near the [[newsroom]].]]

The terms ''anchor'' and ''anchorman'' are derived from the usage common in [[Relay race|relay racing]],&lt;ref name="Slate-Zimmer"/&gt; specifically the [[anchor leg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Tell Me A Story: 50 Years and 60 Minutes in Television | first=Don | last=Hewitt | publisher=PublicAffairs | location=New York | date=2002 | page=55 | quote=... everybody who did what Walter Cronkite did would be called an "anchorman" ... And just as the fastest man on a relay team runs the anchor leg, Cronkite would run the anchor leg for us}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the position is typically given to the fastest or most experienced competitor on a team. In 1948, "anchor man" was used in the game show "[[Who Said That?]]" to refer to [[John Cameron Swayze]], who was a permanent panel member of the show, in what may be the first usage of this term on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futurity.org/if-cronkite-wasn%E2%80%99t-tv%E2%80%99s-first-anchorman-who-was/|title=If Cronkite wasn’t TV's first anchorman, who was?|publisher=Futurity|accessdate=October 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''anchor'' term then became commonly used by 1952 to describe the most prominent member of a panel of reporters or experts. The term "anchorman" also was used to describe [[Walter Cronkite]]'s role at the [[1952 Democratic National Convention|Democratic]] and [[1952 Republican National Convention|Republican National Conventions]], where he coordinated switches between news points and reporters.&lt;ref name="Slate-Zimmer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Zimmer|first=Ben|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2009/07/was_cronkite_really_the_first_anchorman.html|title=Was CronkiteReally the First "Anchorman"?

Anchors occupy a contestable role in news broadcasts. Some argue anchors have become sensationalized characters whose identities overshadow the news itself,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=385793965|title=Brian Williams Case Raises Fundamental Questions About An Anchor's Role|date=February 12, 2015|accessdate=April 27, 2015|publisher=National Public Radio|type=Radio broadcast}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others cite anchors as necessary figureheads of "wisdom and truth"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/q/schedule-for-friday-april-24-1.3047087/should-the-tv-news-anchor-go-the-way-of-the-dodo-1.3047127|title=Should the TV news anchor go the way of the dodo?|date=April 24, 2015|work=the q|accessdate=April 26, 2015|via=http://www.cbc.ca|type=radio broadcast}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the news broadcast. The role of the anchor has changed in recent years following the advent of [[News satire|satirical journalism]] and [[citizen journalism]], both of which relocate the interpretation of truth outside traditional professional journalism, but the place anchormen and anchorwomen hold in American media remains consistent. "Just about every single major news anchor since the dawn of the medium after World War II has been aligned with show business," says Frank Rich, writer-at-large for New York Magazine, in a polemic against commoditized news reporting, "reading headlines to a camera in an appealing way is incentivized over actual reporting".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Brian Williams]], a recurring minor character in NBC's sitcom [[30 Rock#Season 5|30 Rock]], evidences this lapse in credibility generated by the celebration of the role of the anchor. In early 2015, Williams apologized to his viewers for fabricating stories of his experiences on the scene of major news events, an indiscretion resulting in a loss of 700,000 viewers for NBC Nightly News.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Starr|first=Michael|url=https://nypost.com/2015/02/18/nbc-nightly-news-loses-700k-viewers-after-brian-williams-scandal/|title=‘NBC Nightly News’ loses 700K viewers after Brian Williams scandal|date=February 18, 2015|publisher=The New York Post|accessdate=April 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Folkenflik of NPR asserted that the scandal "corrodes trust in the anchor, in NBC and in the greater profession",&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; exhibiting the way in which the credibility of the anchor extends beyond his or her literal place behind the news desk and into the expectation of the news medium at large. CBS's long-running nighttime news broadcast [[60 Minutes]] displays this purported superfluousness of anchors, insofar as it has no central figurehead in favor of many correspondents with similarly important roles. Up-and-coming news networks like [[Vice (magazine)#VICE HBO series|Vice Magazine]]'s documentary-style reporting also eschew traditional news broadcast formatting in this way, suggesting an emphasis on on-site reporting and deemphasizing the importance of the solitary anchor in the news medium. In her essay, "News as Performance", Margaret Morse posits this connection between anchor persona newsroom as an interconnected identity fusing many aspects of the newsroom dynamic:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the anchor represents not merely the news ''per se'', or a particular network or corporate conglomerate that owns the network, or television as an institution, or the public interest; rather, he represents the complex nexus of all of them. In this way, the network anchor position is a "symbolic representation of the institutional order as an integrated totality" (Berger and Luckmann 1967, p. 76), an institutional role on par with that of the president or of a Supreme Court justice, although the role originates in corporate practices rather than political or judicial processes. [...]&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Television Studies Reader|last=Morse|first=Margaret|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=9780415283243|location=New York |page=213|editor-last=Robert C. Allan &amp; Annette Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite the anchor's construction of a commodified, aestheticized version of the news, some critics defend the role of the anchor in society, claiming that he or she functions as a necessary conduit of credibility. The news anchor's position as an omnipotent arbiter of information results from his or her place behind a typically elevated desk, wherefrom he or she interacts with reporters through a screen-within-screen spatial setup. A criticism levied against the role of anchor stems from this dynamic, insofar as anchors simply "... regurgitat[e] or reproduc[e] the report of others...", differentiating them from the productive occupations of journalists and on-site reporters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, journalism professor Elly Alboim articulates the pro-anchor position by characterizing the anchor's nightly presence as a necessary way to build familiarity and trust between the network and its viewers: "People tend to want to believe and trust in television new and start, really, from the anchor".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Beneficial or not, the anchor fits snugly into the "[[Cult of personality|personality cult]]" engendered within American society that encourages celebrity that demands a hierarchy of authority, evidenced by the negligible change in ratings following implementation of new anchors in broadcast lineups.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The identity of a particular anchor seems to influence viewer perception less than the presence of an anchor in general.

Finally, the role of the anchor correlates with the analogous, authority- and information-bearing positions already well-established in [[Politics of the United States|American politics]], and the benefits it confers upon the political realm elucidate the compatibility between these two systems of information. Once again, Morse outlines this relationship between the anchor and the larger context in which they operate: "[s]ince there are few other organs for inclusive and substantial discourse on social and cultural values in American life, the responsibility for interpreting the world and posing a political course of action and a social agenda falls on a very limited number of public personas, including such news personalities and the president".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She levies a criticism against the anchor in this case, claiming that by decreasing the number of people responsible for delivering the news, American viewers receive a bottlenecked stream of information about their surroundings. The choreography and performativity involved in the construction of the news broadcast dramatizes political processes, but in doing so, exposes its flattening of [[subjectivity]] and insistence upon itself as the final word of truth. More specifically, "the news media may do 'an important social good when using the techniques of dramaturgy to make governance more interesting to people than would be the case otherwise.' At the same time, however, 'there is an important difference between drama and democracy, with the former requiring [[Television viewer|spectators]] and the latter participants.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Campaign Talk: Why Elections Are Good for Us|last=Hart|first=Roderick|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2000|isbn=1-4008-0354-3|location=Princeton, NJ|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to perceptions of the news as a one-sided relationship with its viewers, some believe that the news works in conjunction with its audience to produce the most efficient picture possible of the world. Tom Brokaw, in speaking about his experiences as a news anchor for NBC, explained how news stories for the length of their duration tend to feed off viewers' demands, and that news is inherently a "populist medium", and that "[p]eople are not going to turn to television networks for a historically accurate and detailed description of what happened."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=42761120|title=Broadcast News: Television Coverage and Public Opinion|last=Brokaw|first=Tom|date=Spring 1993|journal=Harvard International Review|page=37}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8002">A '''poker dealer''' distributes [[Playing card|cards]] to players and manages the action at a [[poker]] table.

==Professional dealers==
Any [[casino]] with a poker room must hire a staff of dealers.  Casinos generally pay dealers [[minimum wage]].  However, a dealer's primary source of income is not salary, but [[tip (gratuity)|tip]]s from players.  Tip income may be substantial for dealers who can deal hands quickly and efficiently. (In some countries e.g., in Sweden, where all the casinos are owned by the state, Dealers and other casino personnel may not accept tips from players. This rule is complied with strictly.)

To become employable by a casino, applicants without prior experience are typically required to complete a 4-6 week training program at a dealing school.  Dealing in a casino may require working late hours and remaining seated for long periods of time.  Dealers also commonly work [[holiday]]s, since these are especially busy days for casinos.  Having to deal with difficult individuals may be another drawback to dealing at a casino&amp;mdash;some players are [[Verbal abuse|abusive]] to dealers.

[[Poker tournament|Major poker tournaments]] also hire dealers.  For a given tournament stop, the tournament coordinator will hire dealers on contract for the duration of the tournament, which may be a few days to a few weeks.  [[Room and board]] may or may not be provided by the tournament management; the dealer is typically responsible for his own travel expenses.

==Mechanics of dealing==
Dealers must be proficient in [[Shuffle|shuffling]] the deck, distributing the cards to the players, and, if required by the game being dealt, turning up the [[community card]]s in the center of the table.    There are two methods of distributing the cards, "American"-style and "European"-style.

===Shuffling===
To shuffle the cards, the dealer follows a sequence defined by the casino.  First all cards are spread out on the table and pushed around randomly.  This is called "scrambling" or "washing" the cards.  Then the cards are collected and squared into a deck.  At this point a typical shuffling sequence might be: riffle, riffle, box, riffle.  Professional dealers always keep both halves of the deck very low to the table while shuffling. Some casinos have automatic shufflers built into the table that shuffle a different deck of cards while the previous hand is being played, which speeds up the game. 

Finally, a cut card is placed on the table and the deck is [[Cut (cards)|cut]] onto the card.  The cut card is held on the bottom of the deck for the entire hand, to keep the bottom card from being exposed.

===American-style dealing===
In American-style dealing, the deck is held in one hand, and the dealer uses the thumb of their deck hand to slide the top card of the deck toward their pitching hand.  The pitching hand clasps the card between the thumb and index finger while at the same time the mid-point of the card touches the face (nail) of the middle finger.  It is the extension of the middle finger that 'pitches' the card off the top of the deck and a 'whoosh' should be heard as each card exits the top of the deck.

The ability to pitch cards accurately is critical, since the cards must be delivered in a way that players at the table can not see the undersides of the cards.  

===European-style dealing===
European-style dealers touch only the top of each card being dealt.  The card is pushed off the top of the deck to the table surface in front of the dealer.  The dealer then propels the card toward the recipient, usually imparting some spin to the card to encourage sliding.

===Burning and turning===
Before dealing a community card, the top card off the deck is [[Burn card|burned]], or discarded.  The rationale for burning is that the top card on the deck is visible to players during the previous betting round, so that a [[Cheating in poker|cheat]] might be able to spot a mark on the top card and therefore gain an advantage on his opponents.

When burning, the deck must be held low and the burn card kept level with the table surface.  Casinos watch carefully to make sure a dealer does not "flash", or inadvertently expose, the burn cards to players at the table.

In [[community card poker|flop]] games, the three community cards comprising the [[flop (poker)|flop]] are turned up simultaneously, never one at a time.

==Responsibilities during a hand==
Dealers control the action during a hand.  This may include prodding players to act, verbally announcing actions of players to the rest of the table, and correcting players who act out of turn.

Dealers also must manage the [[Pot (poker)|pot]].  The dealer must verify the amount of bets and raises by players, collect folded hands, maintain side pots, and read players' hands at showdown to identify the winner or winners.  In games with a [[rake (poker)|rake]], the dealer also must keep track of the amount of money in the pot and remove the appropriate amount for the house.

At times the dealer needs to communicate with the floor, or other casino staff.  Some casinos equip the dealers with a [[Headphones|headset]] or [[walkie-talkie]] for this purpose, while in other casinos the dealer must shout over the ambient noise.  The following table shows some common calls a dealer may make, and their meanings:

:{| class="wikitable" width="100%"
! align="left" | Call !! align="left" | Meaning
|-
| {{nowrap|"Floor" or "Decision"}} || Requests the floor manager to come to resolve a dispute.
|-
| "Seat open" || Announces that a player has left the game and a seat is now available.
|-
| "Player in" || Notifies the floor or brush that a vacant seat has been filled.
|-
| "Players checks" || Requests a chip runner to retrieve chips for a player.
|-
| "Fill" || Requests a chip runner to bring chips to fill the dealer tray.  This tray must be kept full of low denomination chips in a high limit game, so that change may be made in the pot so that the rake may be taken out.
|-
| "Set up" || Requests replacement decks be brought to the table.
|-
| "Pick up" ||  For cash games, used when an absent player's chips should be removed from the table to free the seat.  Also, for single-table [[Satellite tournament|satellites]], used to request the staff to come collect the cash entry fees from the table.
|-
| "Playover" || Alerts the floor that a new player will be playing in a seat taken by an absent player, until the absent player returns.  Usually a "playover box" or some other object is used to separate the seated player's money and chips from those of the person playing over.
|-
| "Winner" ||  Used in single-table satellites to announce that the game has completed and the prize is to be paid.
|-
| "Brush" || Calls the floor to deal with a game participation problem, for example if a game must be broken due to insufficient players.
|-
| {{nowrap|"Service" or "Cocktails"}} || Alerts the floor that a player wants a beverage and/or food.
|-
|}

==Online dealing==
[[Online poker]] sites use [[Random number generation]] (RNGs) when dealing cards. A successful RNG distributes cards in an unpredictable and random way.

'''BHRT''' ('''Bosnian-Herzegovinian Radio Television'''; [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]: ''Bosanskohercegovačka radiotelevizija (BHRT)'' / Босанскохерцеговачка радиотелевизија (БХРТ)), formerly known as '''PBSBiH''' ('''Public Broadcasting Service of Bosnia and Herzegovina'''; Serbo-Croatian: ''Javni radiotelevizijski servis Bosne i Hercegovine'' / Јавни радиотелевизијски сервис Босне и Херцеговине), is an umbrella broadcasting organization and the only member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

It was known as '''RTVBiH''' ('''Radio Television of Bosnia and Herzegovina'''; Serbo-Croatian language: ''Radiotelevizija Bosne i Hercegovine (RTVBiH)'' / Радиотелевизија Босне и Херцеговине (РТБиХ)) from 1992 until 1998, when it was restructured into the current service. On 1 January 1993, RTVBiH was admitted as an active member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]]. The membership  was transferred to the new parental broadcasting organisation PBSBiH in 2000.

RTVBiH (and consequently BHRT) grew out of [[RTV Sarajevo]] in 1992, one of eight principal broadcasting centers of former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], others being RTV [[Ljubljana]], RTV [[Zagreb]], [[RTV Belgrade]], [[RTV Novi Sad]], RTV [[Podgorica|Titograd]], [[RTV Pristina]], and RTV [[Skopje]].

BHRT currently consists of three organizational units:

* [[BHT 1]] – National public television channel ({{lang|bs|Bosanskohercegovačka televizija}}), also available in HD on cable and satellite
* [[BH Radio 1]] – National public radio service ({{lang|bs|BH radio 1}})
* [[MP BHRT]] – Music Production of BHRT ({{lang|bs|Muzička Produkcija BHRT}})

There is a public corporation in the establishment which should be consisted of all public broadcasters in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]:

* '''BHRT''' as the state level radio-television broadcaster.
* [[RTVFBiH]] (Radiotelevizija Federacije Bosne i Hercegovine) which operates on own channels and frequencies in the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] entity and broadcasting mainly in [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] standard varieties of [[Serbo-Croatian]] language.
* [[RTRS]] (Radiotelevizija Republike Srpske) which operates on own channels and frequencies in the [[Republika Srpska]] entity, broadcasting mainly in [[Serbian language|Serbian]] standard variety of Serbo-Croatian language.
In June 2016, BHRT announced it will be suspending broadcasting at the end of June, as a consequance of insufficient funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bhrt.ba/saopstenja-za-javnost/saopstenje-upravnog-odbora/ |title=SAOPŠTENJE UPRAVNOG ODBORA |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=30 June 2016 |website=BHRT |access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) expressed strong concern as this would have been the first time a public service broadcaster in Europe would have to interrupt its broadcasting because of financial difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ebu.ch/news/2016/06/ebu-alarmed-at-threat-to-public |title=EBU alarmed at threat to Public Service Broadcasting in Bosnia Herzegovina |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=1 June 2016 |website=EBU  |access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Revolver''''' is an original [[graphic novel]] created, written, and drawn by [[Matt Kindt]].  It was published by [[DC Comics]]' [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] in July [[2010 in comics|2010]].

It tells the story of Sam, a man who lives each day twice: first in a normal world, and then again in an [[alternate world]] which is falling apart. Sam must learn why the second universe exists, and choose which one to live in.

==Publication history==
Kindt credits the idea for ''Revolver'' to his fascination with the end of the world, and says he was looking to mix ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]'' with ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/life/comics/2010-07-15-revolver15-ST_N.htm 'Revolver' spins a tale of two realities], [[USA Today]], July 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

It was first published in hardcover by the [[Vertigo (comics)|Vertigo]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[DC Comics]] in July, [[2010 in comics|2010]].

==Plot==
After a night out drinking, Sam wakes with a hangover. When he arrives at the newspaper office where he works, he discovers it has been bombed and the city ([[Chicago]]) is in a panic.  Helping his boss, Jan, evacuate, the two are confronted by her ex-boyfriend. During a panicked scuffle, Sam kills the ex-boyfriend. He returns with Jan to his apartment, where they fall asleep. Sam wakes the next morning alone, and his injuries have vanished. He discovers it is the same day, and that the city is not under attack. He is certain what he remembers was not a dream.

Sam continues to live each day twice, alternating between the two worlds. In the chaotic one, he works with Jan and two other coworkers to produce a leaflet-style newspaper reporting the disasters. In the calmer one, he grows increasingly frustrated with how superficial his life is. He uses his time in the calmer world to learn skills that aid him in the more frantic one, such as [[hot-wiring]] a car. He and Jan become close in one world while remaining distant and unfriendly in the other. Meanwhile, Sam's relationship with his girlfriend Maria becomes sour.

The man suspected of being the mastermind of the bombings, P. K. Verve, is a motivational speaker in the calmer world. Suspecting a connection between Verve and the dual worlds, Sam seeks to meet the motivational speaker. He convinces the unfriendly Jan to finance his trip by blackmailing her with a confession she made in the chaotic world.

When Sam finally meets Verve, he learns that both of them are alternating worlds. Verve claims the two divergent worlds were created when his brother died in a government-arranged plane crash one day, and was alive the next. Verve has used his motivational speaking to travel and learn secrets which he then uses to commit terrorist acts as vengeance in the other. Hoping Sam will be his ally, Verve arranges for them to meet in the chaotic world.

Sam meets with the military, and takes a tracer with him to the meeting. After confirming he is with Verve, the military bombs the hideout, killing them both. Sam wakes in the calmer world, and stops entering the alternate one. He abandons his former lifestyle, and convinces Maria to leave town with him. They head for one of Verve's seminars, and Sam is planning to kill him.

==Reception==
The book received mostly positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=27274 Kindt fires his "Revolver"], [[Comicbookresources.com]], July 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew Meylikhov of Multiveristy Comics felt that "Revolver sufficiently proves exactly why Kindt is perhaps one of the more underrated talents in comics today"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multiversitycomics.com/2011/08/off-cape-revolver-by-matt-kindt.html Off The Cape: Revolver by Matt Kindt], Multiversity Comics, Aug 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rock and Roll Hall of Fame''', located on the shore of [[Lake Erie]] in [[downtown Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], recognizes and archives the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of [[rock and roll]]. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by [[Atlantic Records]] founder and chairman [[Ahmet Ertegun]]. In 1986, [[Cleveland]] was chosen as the Hall of Fame's permanent home.

==Foundation and museum==
Founder Ahmet Ertegun assembled a team that included attorney Suzan Evans, ''Rolling Stone'' magazine editor and publisher [[Jann S. Wenner]], attorney [[Allen Grubman]], and record executives [[Seymour Stein]], [[Bob Krasnow]], and Noreen Woods. The Foundation began inducting artists in 1986, but the Hall of Fame still had no home. The search committee considered several cities, including Philadelphia (home of [[Bill Haley]] and ''[[American Bandstand]]''), Memphis (home of [[Sun Studio]]s and [[Stax Records]]), Detroit (home of [[Motown|Motown Records]]), Cincinnati (home of [[King Records (United States)|King Records]]), New York City, and Cleveland.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Cleveland lobbied for the museum, citing that [[WKNR|WJW]] disc jockey [[Alan Freed]] both coined the term "[[rock and roll]]" and heavily promoted the new genre—and that Cleveland was the location of Freed's [[Moondog Coronation Ball]], the first major rock and roll concert. In addition, Cleveland cited radio station [[WMMS]], which played a key role in breaking several major acts in the U.S. during the 1970s and 1980s, including [[David Bowie]], who began his first U.S. tour in the city, [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Roxy Music]], and [[Rush (band)|Rush]] among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/exhibits/wmms--a-cleveland-legend-turns-40/|title=Exhibits|website=Rockhall.com|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleveland was also one of the premier tour stops for most rock bands.

Civic leaders in Cleveland pledged $65 million in public money to fund the construction. A petition drive was signed by 600,000 fans favoring Cleveland over Memphis, and Cleveland ranked first in a 1986 ''USA Today'' poll asking where the Hall of Fame should be located. On May 5, 1986, the Hall of Fame Foundation chose Cleveland as the permanent home of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum.  Sam Phillips of Sun Studios fame and many others were stunned and disappointed that it ended up in Cleveland.  "The hall of fame should've been in Memphis, certainly," wrote [[Peter Guralnick]], author of an acclaimed two-volume Elvis Presley biography.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Guralnick (author of ''Sam Phillips: The Man Who Invented Rock 'n' Roll''), an interview, "Bostonia," Winter-Spring 2016, pp. 52-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleveland may also have been chosen as the organization's site because the city offered the best financial package. As ''The Plain Dealer'' music critic Michael Norman noted, "It was $65 million... Cleveland wanted it here and put up the money." Co-founder Jann Wenner later said, "One of the small sad things is we didn't do it in New York in the first place," but then added, "I am absolutely delighted that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is in Cleveland."

During early discussions on where to build the Hall of Fame and Museum, the Foundation's board considered the Cuyahoga River. Ultimately, the chosen location was along East Ninth Street in downtown Cleveland by [[Lake Erie]], east of [[Cleveland Stadium]].

At one point in the planning phase, when a financing gap existed, planners proposed locating the Rock Hall in the then-vacant May Company Building, but finally decided to commission architect [[I. M. Pei]] to design a new building. Initial CEO Dr. [[Larry R. Thompson]] facilitated I. M. Pei in designs for the site. Pei came up with the idea of a tower with a glass pyramid protruding from it. The museum tower was initially planned to stand 200&amp;nbsp;ft (61 m) high, but had to be cut down to 162&amp;nbsp;ft (49 m) due to its proximity to [[Burke Lakefront Airport]]. The building's base is approximately 150,000 square feet (14,000 m2). The groundbreaking ceremony took place on June 7, 1993. [[Pete Townshend]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Sam Phillips]], [[Ruth Brown]], [[Sam Moore]] of [[Sam and Dave]], [[Carl Gardner]] of the [[Coasters]] and [[Dave Pirner]] of [[Soul Asylum]] all appeared at the groundbreaking.

The museum was dedicated on September 1, 1995, with the ribbon being cut by an ensemble that included [[Yoko Ono]] and [[Little Richard]], among others, before a crowd of more than 10,000 people. The following night an all-star concert was held at the stadium. It featured [[Chuck Berry]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Al Green]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[John Fogerty]], [[John Mellencamp]], and many others.

In addition to the Hall of Fame inductees, the museum documents the entire history of rock and roll, regardless of induction status. Hall of Fame inductees are honored in a special exhibit located in a wing that juts out over Lake Erie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum Timeline: 1995–2010|url=http://www.cleveland.com/popmusic/index.ssf/2010/08/rock_and_roll_hall_of_fame_and_3.html|work=Article|publisher=The Plain Dealer/Cleveland.com|accessdate=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic impact===
Since 1986, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has selected new inductees. The formal induction ceremony has been held in New York City 26 times (1986–92, 1994–96, 1998–2008, 2010–11, 2014, 2016 and 2017); twice in Los Angeles (1993 and 2013); and four times in the Hall of Fame's home in Cleveland (1997, 2009, 2012 and 2015).  Beginning in 2018, the induction ceremonies will alternate each year between Cleveland and New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Grzegorek, Vince|date=April 8, 2016|title=Rock Hall President: Induction to Take Place in Cleveland Every Other Year Beginning in 2018|url=http://clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2016/04/08/rock-hall-president-induction-to-take-place-in-cleveland-every-other-year-beginning-in-2018|work=CleveScene.com|publisher=[[Cleveland Scene]]|accessdate=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The 2009 and 2012 induction weeks were made possible by a [[public–private partnership]] between the City of Cleveland, the State of [[Ohio]], the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and local foundations, corporations, civic organizations and individuals. Collectively these entities invested $5.8 million in 2009 and $7.9 million in 2012 to produce a week of events, including free concerts, a gospel celebration, exhibition openings, free admission to the museum, and induction  ceremonies filled with both fans and VIPs at Public Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Soeder|first=John|title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is going strong, 15 years after opening|url=http://www.cleveland.com/popmusic/index.ssf/2010/08/rock_and_roll_hall_of_fame_and_4.html|work=Article|publisher=The Plain Dealer/Cleveland.com|accessdate=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Millions viewed the television broadcast of the Cleveland inductions; tens of thousands traveled to Ohio during induction week to participate in Induction-related events. The economic impact of the 2009 induction week activities was more than $13 million, and it provided an additional $20 million in media exposure for the region. The 2012 induction week yielded similar results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Soeder|first=John|title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductions, done 'the Cleveland way,' are a hit|url=http://www.cleveland.com/rockhall/index.ssf/2012/04/rock_and_roll_hall_of_fame_ind_17.html|work=Article|publisher=The Plain Dealer/Cleveland.com|accessdate=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are seven levels in the building. On the lower level is the [[Ahmet Ertegun|Ahmet M. Ertegun]] Exhibition Hall, the museum's main gallery. It includes exhibits on the roots of rock and roll ([[gospel]], [[blues]], [[rhythm &amp; blues]] and [[folk music|folk]], [[Country music|country]] and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]). It also features exhibits on cities that have had a major impact on rock and roll: [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Detroit]], London and [[Liverpool]], [[San Francisco]], Los Angeles, New York and [[Seattle]]. There are exhibits about [[soul music]], the Fifties, [[Sun Records]], [[Atlantic Records]], [[hip hop music]], Cleveland's rock and roll legacy, the music of the Midwest, rock and roll radio and dee-jays, and the many protests against rock and roll. This gallery also has exhibits that focus on individual artists, including [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Jimi Hendrix]] and others. Finally, the Ahmet M. Ertegun Exhibition Hall includes two theaters, one of which features a film about the roots of rock and roll and one that features films on various subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=A look inside the redesign of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum: Interactive Graphic|url=http://www.cleveland.com/popmusic/index.ssf/2012/03/a_look_inside_the_redesign_of.html|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]|accessdate=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first floor of the museum is the entrance level. It includes a cafe, a stage that the museum uses for various special performances and events throughout the year, and a section called "Backstage Stories." The second floor includes several interactive kiosks that feature programs on [[one-hit wonders]] and the Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. This level also includes a gallery with artifact-filled exhibits about [[Les Paul]], [[Alan Freed]], [[Sam Phillips]] and the evolution of audio technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Swank|first=Niki|title=Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame: the heart of rock and roll|url=http://www.bxmagazine.com/article.asp?ID=1274|work=Builders Exchange Magazine|accessdate=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visitors enter the Hall of Fame section of the museum on the third floor. This section includes "The Power of Rock Experience," which includes one of [[Jonathan Demme]]'s final works, a film shown in the Connor Theater. The film includes musical highlights from some of the Hall's induction ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Troy L. |title=Rock Hall premieres its spellbinding 'The Power of Rock Experience'|url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2017/06/the_power_of_rock_experience_g.html |website=[[Cleveland.com]]|accessdate=September 10, 2017|date=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors exit the Hall of Fame section on the fourth floor.

Finally, the top two levels of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame feature large, temporary exhibits. Over the years, numerous exhibits have been installed on these two levels, including exhibits about [[Elvis Presley]], [[hip-hop]], [[the Supremes]], [[the Who]], [[U2]], [[John Lennon]], [[the Clash]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], ''Women Who Rock'', and the [[Rolling Stones]].

===Architecture===
[[File:Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.jpg|thumb|The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, showing [[Lake Erie]] in the foreground]]
Designed by [[I. M. Pei]] and structurally engineered by Leslie E. Robertson Associates, the building rises above the shores of [[Lake Erie]]. It is a combination of geometric forms and cantilevered spaces that are anchored by a 162-foot tower. The tower supports a dual-triangular-shaped glass "tent" that extends (at its base) onto a 65,000-square-foot plaza that provides a main entry facade.

The building houses more than 55,000 square feet of exhibition space, as well as administrative offices, a store, and a café.

"In designing this building," Pei said, "it was my intention to echo the energy of rock and roll. I have consciously used an architectural vocabulary that is bold and new, and I hope the building will become a dramatic landmark for the city of [[Cleveland]] and for fans of [[rock and roll]] around the world." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=The House That Steel Built: A Showcase of Interesting and Aesthetic Projects|url=http://www.lera.com/files/rock%26roll_AISC.pdf|work=Business Literature|publisher=American Institute of Steel Construction|accessdate=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibit history==
{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2017}}
Since 1997, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has featured numerous temporary exhibits that range in size from major exhibits that fill the top two floors of the museum to smaller exhibits that are often installed in the main exhibition hall on the lower level.

The museum's first major exhibit opened on May 10, 1997. It was called ''I Want to Take You Higher: The Psychedelic Era, 1965 – 1969''. It included artifacts from numerous artists, including [[John Lennon]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[John Sebastian]], [[Jefferson Airplane|the Jefferson Airplane]], and [[Janis Joplin]], as well as artifacts related to the [[Monterey International Pop Festival]] and [[Woodstock]].

That exhibit was followed by ''Elvis is in the Building'', an exhibit about the "King of Rock and Roll", which ran from August 8, 1998, to September 5, 1999.  This year-long tribute was the first ever special exhibit devoted to a single artist, Elvis Presley, the first inductee into the RRHOF in 1986.  Graceland supplied a significant selection of representative artifacts for this special tribute spanning Elvis' life and legendary career.&lt;ref&gt;(see Larry G. Keeter, "Elvis Is In the Building," "Elvis International Forum," Summer 2000,  pp.&amp;nbsp;28–29)&lt;/ref&gt;  Next, the museum curated ''Roots, Rhymes and Rage: The Hip-Hop Story''. That was the first major museum exhibit to focus on hip-hop. It ran from November 11, 1999, to August 6, 2000. It was followed by ''Rock Style'', an exhibit that focused on rock and roll and fashion. It featured clothing from [[Buddy Holly]] to [[Alice Cooper]], from [[Ray Charles]] to [[David Bowie]] and from [[Smokey Robinson]] to [[Sly Stone]]. After it closed in Cleveland, ''Rock Style'' traveled to other museums in the U.S.

[[File:Rock-roll-annex-76-Mercer.jpg|thumb|upright|The former Annex in Soho in New York City (now closed)]]
Other temporary exhibits have included ''Lennon: His Life and Work'', which ran from October 20, 2000, to January 1, 2003. It was followed by ''In the Name of Love: Two Decades of [[U2]]'' and then ''Reflections: The [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]] Supreme Legacy Collection''. A major exhibition on display during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in 2016 was ''Louder than Words: Rock, Power, Politics.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Troy|title=Rock Hall announces 'Rock, Power and Politics' exhibit to coincide with Republican National Convention|url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/12/rock_halls_rock_power_and_poli.html|work=Article|publisher=The Plain Dealer/Cleveland.com|accessdate=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other large temporary exhibits have focused on [[the Clash]] (''Revolution Rock: The Story of the Clash''), [[the Doors]] (''Break on Through: The Lasting Legacy of the Doors''), [[the Who]]'s ''[[Tommy (album)|Tommy]]'' (''Tommy: The Amazing Journey''), and [[Bruce Springsteen]] (''From Asbury Park to the Promised Land: The Life and Music of Bruce Springsteen''). Another thematic temporary exhibit focused on the role of women in rock and roll (''Women Who Rock: Vision, Passion, Power''). Many of these exhibits travel to other museums after closing in Cleveland. The museum's current major temporary exhibit is about the history of the magazine [[Rolling Stone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Troy|title=Rock Hall exhibit lays out Rolling Stone magazine's remarkable impact|url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2017/05/rock_halls_new_rolling_stone_e.html|work=Article|publisher=The Plain Dealer/Cleveland.com|accessdate=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame also curates many smaller temporary exhibits. Over the years, these exhibits have focused on such topics as the [[Vans Warped Tour]], [[the Concert for Bangladesh]], Woodstock's 40th anniversary, [[Austin City Limits]], the [[Monterey International Pop Festival]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], [[Marty Stuart]], [[Paul Simon]], [[Graham Nash]], and [[John Mellencamp]].

The museum also devotes exhibits to photography and artwork related to rock and roll. Among the photographers whose work has been featured at the Hall of Fame are George Kalinsky, Alfred Wertheimer, Tommy Edwards, Kevin Mazur, Janet Macoska, Lynn Goldsmith, Mike McCartney, Robert Alford,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yarborough|first=Chuck|title="Just Can't Get Enough: The Photography of Robert Alford" opens Sept. 19 at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|url=http://www.cleveland.com/music/index.ssf/2012/09/just_cant_get_enough_the_photo.html|work=Article|publisher=The Plain Dealer/Cleveland.com|accessdate=June 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and George Shuba. The museum also featured the artwork of Philip Burke in one of its temporary exhibits, and a later exhibit featured Herb Ritts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum / Past Exhibits|url=https://www.rockhall.com/exhibits/past/|work=Official Website|accessdate=March 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yarborough|first=Chuck|title='Herb Ritts: The Rock Portraits': Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's captivating exhibit spotlights photographer's skill at capturing stars' essence (review)|url=http://www.cleveland.com/music/index.ssf/2015/03/herb_ritts_the_rock_portraits.htmllwork=Article|publisher=The Plain Dealer/Cleveland.com|accessdate=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public programs===
The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum produces numerous public programs, including concerts, interviews, lectures, film screenings, and other events that help tell the story of rock and roll.
Every February, the museum celebrates [[Black History Month]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hake|first=A.|title=Rock Hall Announces Black History Month Events|url=http://downtown.woio.com/news/events/89102-rock-hall-announces-black-history-month-events|work=Article|publisher=WOIO/19 Action News|accessdate=March 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; by hosting concerts, film screenings and lectures that illustrate the important role African-Americans have played in the history of rock and roll. Since the program began in 1996, such artists as [[Robert Lockwood, Jr.]], [[the Temptations]], [[Charles Brown (musician)|Charles Brown]], [[Ruth Brown]], [[the Ohio Players]], [[Lloyd Price]], [[Little Anthony and the Imperials]], and [[Al Green]] have appeared at the museum during Black History Month.

Another program is the Hall of Fame Series. This series began in April 1996 and features interviews with Hall of Fame inductees in a rare and intimate settings, most often in the Museum's Foster Theater. The interviews are usually followed by a question-and-answer session with the audience and, often, a performance by the inductee. Among the inductees who have taken part in this series are Darryl "DMC" McDaniels of [[Run-D.M.C]]., [[Lloyd Price]], [[Marky Ramone]], [[Seymour Stein]], [[Ray Manzarek]] of [[the Doors]], [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Bootsy Collins]], Ann and Nancy Wilson of [[Heart (band)|Heart]], and [[Jorma Kaukonen]] of the [[Jefferson Airplane]].

A similar program is the Legends Series. The only real difference between this program and the Hall of Fame Series is that it features artists who have not yet been inducted into the Hall of Fame. [[Peter Hook]] of [[Joy Division]], [[Spinderella]] of [[Salt n Pepa]], [[Tommy James]], and [[the Chi-Lites]] are among the artists who have participated in the Legends Series.

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's most acclaimed program is the annual American Music Masters series. Each year the museum celebrates one of the Hall's inductees with a week-long series of programs that include interviews, film screenings, and, often, a special exhibit. The celebration ends with an all-star concert held at a Cleveland theater. The concerts include a diverse mix of artists, from Hall of Fame inductees to contemporary musicians.

The American Music Masters series began in 1996 with ''Hard Travelin': The Life and Legacy of Pete Seeger''. Since then, the programs have honored the following inductees: [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] (1997), [[Robert Johnson]] (1998), [[Louis Jordan]] (1999), [[Muddy Waters]] (2000), [[Bessie Smith]] (2001), [[Hank Williams]] (2002), [[Buddy Holly]] (2003), [[Lead Belly]] (2004), [[Sam Cooke]] (2005), [[Roy Orbison]] (2006), [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] (2007), [[Les Paul]] (2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=D.X.|first=Ferris|title=Slash, Billy Gibbons Jam for Les Paul at Rock Hall's American Music Master's Concert|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/slash-billy-gibbons-jam-for-les-paul-at-rock-halls-american-music-masters-concert-20081117|work=Article|publisher=Rolling Stone Magazine|accessdate=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Janis Joplin]] (2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DeMarco|first=Laura|title=Rock Hall to honor Janis Joplin in American Music Masters series|url=http://www.cleveland.com/music/index.ssf/2009/08/rock_hall_to_honor_janis_jopli.html|work=Article|publisher=The Plain Dealer/Cleveland.com|accessdate=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fats Domino]] and [[Dave Bartholomew]] (2010), [[Aretha Franklin]] (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Soeder|first=John|title=Aretha Franklin Honored in Rock and Roll Hall of Fame American Music Masters Tribute|url=http://www.cleveland.com/popmusic/index.ssf/2011/11/aretha_franklin_honored_in_roc.html|work=Article|publisher=The Plain Dealer/Cleveland.com|accessdate=March 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chuck Berry]] (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doyle|first=Patrick|title=Chuck Berry Praises Obama, Laments Fading Health|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/chuck-berry-praises-obama-laments-fading-voice-20121027|work=Article|publisher=Rolling Stone Magazine|accessdate=March 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll ===
{{anchor|The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll}}
Hall of Fame museum curator James Henke, along with "the museum's curatorial staff and numerous rock critics and music experts", created an unordered list of  "500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/site/faq/|title=FAQ - The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|website=Rockhall.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipea/A0150472.html | title=500 Songs That Shaped Rock|website=Infoplease.com | accessdate=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list is part of a permanent exhibit at the museum, and was envisioned as part of the museum from its opening in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artcom.com/Museums/nv/mr/44114-10.htm|title=Artcom Museums Tour: Rock and Roll Hall of Fame &amp; Museum, Cleveland, OH - Moving Companies|website=Art.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains songs recorded from the [[Stagger Lee (song)|1920s]] through the 1990s. The oldest song on the list is "[[Wabash Cannonball]]", written circa 1882 and credited to J. A. Roff. Since then, however, an additional 160 songs have been added, and the list is now simply referred to as "The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll". The most recent songs on the list are [[Gnarls Barkley]]'s "[[Crazy (Gnarls Barkley song)|Crazy]]" and [[My Chemical Romance]]'s "[[Welcome to the Black Parade]]", both released in 2006.&lt;ref name="655 Songs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rockhall.com/exhibits/one-hit-wonders-songs-that-shaped-rock-and-roll/ |title=Experience The Music: One Hit Wonders and The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll |publisher=Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628094517/http://rockhall.com/exhibits/one-hit-wonders-songs-that-shaped-rock-and-roll/ |archive-date=28 June 2011 |access-date=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beatles and the Rolling Stones are the most represented on the 660-song list, with eight songs each.

===25th anniversary concert===
The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame celebrated its 25th anniversary with a concert series over two days on October 29 and 30, 2009 at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York. The celebration included performances by [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[U2]], [[Patti Smith]], [[Bruce Springsteen]] &amp; [[the E Street Band]], [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]], [[Dion DiMucci]], [[Metallica]], [[James Taylor]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Ray Davies]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Paul Simon]], [[Jeff Beck]], [[Buddy Guy]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Little Anthony &amp; the Imperials]], and [[Crosby, Stills and Nash]].

==Inductees==
[[File:Eric-Clapton 1975.jpg|thumbnail|220px|English guitarist, singer, and songwriter [[Eric Clapton]] is the only three-time inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]

{{See also|List of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees}}
Artists are inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at an annual induction ceremony. Over the years, the majority of the ceremonies have been held at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] in New York City. However, on January 12, 1993, the ceremony was held in Los Angeles, and was held there again in 2013. On May 6, 1997, about a year and a half after the opening of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, the ceremony was held in Cleveland. It returned to Cleveland in 2009 and again in 2012. Current plans call for the ceremony to be in Cleveland every three years. 
Generally, the number of inductees ranges from about a half-dozen to a dozen. Virtually all living inductees have attended the ceremonies, and they are presented with their Hall of Fame award by an artist who was influenced by that inductee's music. Both the presenter and the inductee speak at the ceremonies, which also include numerous musical performances, by both the inductees and the presenters.
The first group of inductees, inducted on January 23, 1986, included [[Elvis Presley]], [[James Brown]], [[Little Richard]], [[Fats Domino]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[Sam Cooke]], the [[Everly Brothers]], [[Buddy Holly]], and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]. [[Robert Johnson]], [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], and [[Jimmy Yancey]] were inducted as Early Influences, [[John Hammond (producer)|John Hammond]] received the Lifetime Achievement Award and [[Alan Freed]] and [[Sam Phillips]] were inducted as Non-Performers.

===Performers===
A nominating committee composed of rock and roll historians selects names for the "Performers" category (singers, vocal groups, bands, and instrumentalists of all kinds), which are then voted on by roughly five hundred experts across the world. Those selected to vote include academics, journalists, producers, and others with music industry experience. Artists become eligible for induction 25 years after the release of their first record. Criteria include the influence and significance of the artists' contributions to the development and perpetuation of rock and roll. To be selected for induction, performers must receive the highest number of votes, and also greater than 50% of the votes. Around five to seven performers are inducted each year.&lt;!--It is *not* impossible for 5 to 7 nominees to each receive 50 percent or more of a vote, as the number of nominees is not specified, and voters can select multiple nominees. There were seven inductees in this category in 2004, and eight in 2001. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/induction-process/|title=Induction Process|website=Rockhall.com|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, six additional groups, [[the Miracles]], [[the Famous Flames]], [[the Comets]], [[the Blue Caps]], [[the Midnighters]], and [[the Crickets]], were inducted as performers by a special committee due to the controversial exclusions when their lead singer was inducted. "There was a lot of discussion about this," said Terry Stewart, a member of the nominating committee. "There had always been conversations about why the groups weren't included when the lead singers were inducted. Very honestly, nobody could really answer that question – it was so long ago... We decided we'd sit down as an organization and look at that. This is the result."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/popmusic/index.ssf/2012/02/crickets_famous_flames_comets.html|title=Crickets, Famous Flames, Comets, Miracles, Midnighters and Blue Caps added to Rock Hall induction ceremony|author=Soeder, John|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=February 9, 2012|accessdate=February 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Influences===
Early Influences includes artists from earlier eras, primarily [[country music|country]], [[folk music|folk]], [[jazz]], and [[blues]], whose music inspired and influenced rock and roll artists. Other notable artists that have been inducted as Early Influences include [[Bill Kenny (singer)|Bill Kenny]] &amp; [[The Ink Spots]], country musicians [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] and [[Hank Williams]], blues musicians [[Howlin' Wolf]] and [[Muddy Waters]], and jazz musicians [[Jelly Roll Morton]] and [[Louis Armstrong]]. After [[Nat King Cole]] and [[Billie Holiday]] in 2000, no one was inducted in this category until 2009, when rockabilly singer [[Wanda Jackson]] was selected. Unlike earlier inductees in this category, Jackson's career almost entirely took place after the traditional 1955 start of the "rock era".

===Ahmet Ertegun Award for Lifetime Achievement===
Formerly the "Non-Performers" award, this category encompasses those who primarily work behind the scenes in the music industry, including record label executives, songwriters, record producers, disc jockeys, [[tour promoter|concert promoter]]s and [[Journalism|music journalists]]. This category has had at least one inductee every year except 2007 and 2009. Following the death of the Hall of Fame's co-founder [[Ahmet Ertegun]], this award was renamed in his honor in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/late-ertegun-honoured-with-new-hall-of-fame-award_1062079|title=Late Ertegun Honoured With New Hall Of Fame Award|author=|work=Contactmusic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Award for Musical Excellence===
Formerly the "Sidemen" award, this category was introduced in 2000 and honors veteran [[session musician|session]] and concert players who are selected by a committee composed primarily of producers. The category was dormant from 2004 through 2007 and re-activated in 2008. This honor was renamed the "Award for Musical Excellence" in 2010. According to Joel Peresman, the president of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, "This award gives us flexibility to dive into some things and recognize some people who might not ordinarily get recognized."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/popmusic/index.ssf/2010/12/neil_diamond_alice_cooper_dr_j.html|title=Neil Diamond, Alice Cooper, Dr. John, Darlene Love and Tom Waits headed into Rock Hall|date=December 15, 2010|accessdate=December 20, 2010|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]|author=Soeder, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Library and archives==
[[File: RocknRollHall 2015 LHCollins 600.jpg |thumb|right|350px |The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio November 2015]]
The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's Library and Archives is the world's most comprehensive repository of materials related to the history of rock and roll. The Library and Archives is located in a new building on the Metro Campus of Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland's [[Campus District]].

The Library and Archives' mission is to collect, preserve and provide access to these materials. The Library and Archives operates on two levels: people may come into the library and read the books and magazines, listen to music and other recordings, and watch videos and films. More serious scholars, historians and journalists may also make an appointment for access to the archival collections under the supervision of the staff archivists.

The library is composed of books, academic dissertations, and other references. It also includes popular magazines, scholarly journals and trade publications; commercial audio and video recordings, and research databases.

The archival collections include music-business records from record executives, artist managers, labels, historic venues, recording studios, specialists in stage design and lighting, and long-running concert tours. The collections also contain important individual items, such as personal letters penned by [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], handwritten working lyrics by [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[LL Cool J]], papers from music journalists such as [[Sue Cassidy Clark]], and rare concert recordings from [[CBGB]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Opens Archives to the Public|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-opens-archives-to-the-public-20120118|publisher=Rolling Stone Magazine|accessdate=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Graff|first=Gary|title=Rock Hall Opening Library and Archives This Week|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/511232/rock-hall-opening-library-and-archives-collection-this-week|work=Article|publisher=Billboard Magazine|accessdate=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Soeder|first=John|title=Rock Hall Library and Archives set to open Tuesday|url=http://www.cleveland.com/popmusic/index.ssf/2012/01/rock_hall_library_and_archives.html|work=article|publisher=The Plain Dealer/Cleveland.com|accessdate=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The most frequent criticism of the Hall of Fame is that the nomination process is controlled by a few individuals who are not themselves musicians, such as founder [[Jann Wenner]] (co-founder and [[editor-in-chief]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine), former foundation director Suzan Evans, and writer [[Dave Marsh]], reflecting their personal tastes rather than the views of the rock world as a whole. A former member of the nominations board once commented that "At one point Suzan Evans lamented the choices being made because there weren't enough big names that would sell tickets to the dinner. That was quickly remedied by dropping one of the [[doo-wop]] groups being considered in favor of a 'name' artist ... I saw how certain pioneering artists of the '50s and early '60s were shunned because there needed to be more name power on the list, resulting in '70s superstars getting in before the people who made it possible for them. Some of those pioneers still aren't in today."&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,1966,00.html |title=Rock Hall of Fame Fallout: 'There Is Resentment Building Up' |accessdate=April 4, 2001 |author=Friedman, Roger |date=April 4, 2001 |publisher=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]] is often considered "The Godmother/Grandmother of Rock &amp; Roll",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00xf8k7/the-godmother-of-rock-roll-sister-rosetta-tharpe |title=The Godmother of Rock &amp; Roll: Sister Rosetta Tharpe |work=[[BBC Four]] |date=May 24, 2011 |accessdate=March 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/black-culture/shows/list/rock-and-roll-rosetta-tharpe/|title=Godmother of Rock and Roll: Sister Rosetta Tharpe|work=PBS|accessdate=March 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was not chosen for induction until 2017. [[Velvet Underground]] drummer [[Maureen Tucker]] has dismissed the Hall of Fame as the "Hall of Lame".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://olivier.landemaine.free.fr/dougyule/dystory.html|title=Doug Yule - Story|website=Olivier.landemaine.free.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also controversy in the lack of transparency in the selection process. Janet Morrissey of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"With fame and money at stake, it's no surprise that a lot of backstage lobbying goes on. Why any particular act is chosen in any particular year is a mystery to performers as well as outsiders – and committee members say they want to keep it that way."&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/business/in-rock-hall-of-fame-vote-a-battle-of-industry-egos.html|title=Battle of the Bands (and Egos) for the Rock Hall of Fame|author=Morrissey, Janet|date=December 3, 2011|accessdate=December 5, 2011|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Jon Landau]], the chairman of the nominating committee, says they prefer it that way. "We've done a good job of keeping the proceedings nontransparent. It all dies in the room."&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt;

According to [[Fox News]], petitions with tens of thousands of signatures were also being ignored, and some groups that were signed with certain labels or companies or were affiliated with various committee members have even been put up for nomination with no discussion at all.&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt; The committee has also been accused of largely ignoring certain genres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2009/12/getting-progressive-the-rock-hall-voted-in-genesis-whos-still-missing.html|title=Getting progressive: The Rock Hall votes in Genesis. Is Yes or Procol Harum next?|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 29, 2009|accessdate=January 20, 2010|author=Boehm, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to author [[Brett Milano]], "entire genres get passed over, particularly [[progressive rock]], '60s [[Top 40]], New Orleans [[funk]] and a whole lot of [[African-American music|black music]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2007-03-11-rock-hall-main_N.htm|title=Dispute rocks the hall|date=March 12, 2007|accessdate=January 20, 2010|work=USA Today|author=Gundersen, Edna}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, since the mid-2000s (decade), numerous [[hip hop]] artists have been inducted, including [[Tupac Shakur]] (class of 2017), [[N.W.A]] (class of 2016) and [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]] (class of 2007).&lt;ref name="Friedman2"/&gt;

Another criticism is that too many artists are inducted. In fifteen years, 97 different artists were inducted.&lt;ref name="Bream"/&gt; A minimum of 50% of the vote is needed to be inducted; although, the final percentages are not announced and a certain number of inductees (five in 2011) is set before the ballots are shipped.&lt;ref name="Bream"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/457/story/931216.html |title=Three strikes, they're in |accessdate=January 17, 2007 |author=Friedman, Roger |date=January 12, 2007 |work=Star Tribune |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071020112245/http://www.startribune.com/457/story/931216.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = October 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee usually nominates a small number of artists (12 in 2010) from an increasing number of different genres. Several voters, including [[Joel Selvin]], himself a former member of the nominating committee, did not submit their ballots in 2007 because they did not feel that any of the candidates were truly worthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/11/14/DDBITBMBD.DTL |title=View: Rock and Roll Hall offers lackluster candidates |accessdate=December 7, 2007 |author=Selvin, Joel |authorlink=Joel Selvin|date=November 14, 2007 |work=San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the British [[punk rock]] band [[The Sex Pistols]], inducted in 2006, refused to attend the ceremony, calling the museum "a piss stain" and "urine in wine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302091236/http://www.thefilthandthefury.co.uk/ |url=http://www.thefilthandthefury.co.uk/ |title=Official announcement from the Sex Pistols regarding the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame |date=February 24, 2006 |archivedate=March 2, 2008 |work=[[Sex Pistols]] – The Filth and the Fury}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[BBC Radio 6 Music]]'s Annual [[John Peel]] Lecture in 2013, the singer [[Charlotte Church]] accused the museum of [[gender bias]], stating, "Out of 295 acts and artists in the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame, 259 are entirely male, meaning that [[Tina Weymouth]]'s part in [[Talking Heads]] makes them one of the 36 female acts."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/permalink/2013/10/15/church Transcript: Paul Resnikoff, "I'm Charlotte Church. And This Is How Women Are Routinely Demoralized by the Music Industry…,"] Digital Media News, October 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/jpl|title=BBC Radio 6 Music - The John Peel Lecture - Downloads|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the actual percentage of woman inductees is 8.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scrollkit.com/s/GGR9Eju|title=scroll kit|website=Scrollkit.com|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combining all the categories, there have been 719 inductees, out of which 61 have been women, none of whom has been inducted more than once or awarded the Lifetime Achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/|title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: Inductees|website=Rockhall.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2016 inductee [[Steve Miller (musician)|Steve Miller]] voiced a litany of criticisms directed at the hall, both during his induction speech and, especially, in interviews after it. His complaints included a lack of female inductees, not  enough support by the hall for music education, and treatment of inductees at the award ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/64693-steve-miller-rips-the-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame/|title=Steve Miller Rips the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame - Pitchfork|website=Pitchfork.com|accessdate=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007 vote controversy===
On March 14, 2007, two days after that year's induction ceremony, Roger Friedman of [[Fox News]] published an article claiming that [[the Dave Clark Five]] should have been the fifth inductee, as they had more votes than inductee [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]]. The article went on to say "Jann Wenner used a technicality about the day votes were due in. In reality, The Dave Clark Five got six more votes than Grandmaster Flash. But he felt we couldn't go another year without a rap act."&lt;ref name="Friedman2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,258664,00.html#2 |title=Rock Hall Voting Scandal: Rock Group Actually Won |accessdate=April 6, 2007 |author=Friedman, Roger |date=March 14, 2007 |publisher=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Monkees controversy===

In June 2007, Monkee [[Peter Tork]] complained to the ''[[New York Post]]'' that Wenner had blackballed [[the Monkees]], commenting:

{{bquote|[Wenner] doesn't care what the rules are and just operates how he sees fit. It is an abuse of power. I don't know whether the Monkees belong in the Hall of Fame, but it's pretty clear that we're not in there because of a personal whim. Jann seems to have taken it harder than everyone else, and now, 40 years later, everybody says, 'What's the big deal? Everybody else does it.' [Uses studio artists or backing bands.] Nobody cares now except him. He feels his moral judgment in 1967 and 1968 is supposed to serve in 2007.}}

In a Facebook post, fellow Monkee [[Michael Nesmith]] stated that he does not know if the Monkees belong in the Hall of Fame because he can only see the impact of the Monkees from the inside, and further stated: "I can see the HOF (Hall of Fame) is a private enterprise. It seems to operate as a business, and the inductees are there by some action of the owners of the Enterprise. The inductees appear to be chosen at the owner's pleasure. This seems proper to me. It is their business in any case. It does not seem to me that the HOF carries a public mandate, nor should it be compelled to conform to one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nesmith|first=Michael|title="Should The Monkees be included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?", you ask.|url=https://www.facebook.com/michaelnesmith/posts/400891016595629|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=May 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saptak means "gamut" or "the series of seven [[Musical note|note]]s". It denotes the set of [[swaras]], Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni which comprise a [[musical scale]] in [[Indian classical music]]. In [[Sanskrit]], '''saptak''' literally means "containing seven" and is derived from the Sanskrit word ''sapta'' which means "seven".

The basic saptak is called the '''Madhya Saptak''' ([[Devanagari]]: मध्य सप्तक). For notes with lower frequencies, the artist may use the '''Mandra Saptak''' ([[Devanagari]]: मंद्र सप्तक)', which is a lower octave than the Madhya Saptak. For notes with higher frequencies, the upper octave or the '''Taar Saptak''' ([[Devanagari]]: तार सप्तक) is used.

The usual scale of Indian music spans from Sa in the Madhya Saptak to Sa in the higher, Taar Saptak. This makes eight notes instead of the seven in each Saptak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chandrakantha.com/articles/indian_music/saptak_scale.html Saptak - The Indian Scale&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=June 2012}}&lt;!--why/how so? the eighth is the same as the first...--&gt;

Generally, a [[raga]] involves notes from three saptaks. The notes in the lower octave are denoted by an apostrophe before the note representation (or a dot below the note representation) and the notes in the upper octave are denoted by an apostrophe after the note representation (or a dot above the note representation).

For example:

*Mandra Saptak : Ş or 'S
*Madhya Saptak : S
*Taar Saptak   : Ŝ or S'

On August 9, 2014, '''Michael Brown Jr.''', an 18-year-old [[African American]] man, was fatally shot by a white police officer, 28-year-old '''Darren Wilson''', in the city of [[Ferguson, Missouri]], a suburb of [[St. Louis]].{{sfn |USDOJ |2015 | p=6}}  Brown was accompanied by his friend Dorian Johnson who was 22.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/michael-brown-robbed-convenience-store-stole-cigarillos-darren-wilson-shooting-dorian-1729359|title=Michael Brown Robbed Convenience Store, Stole Cigarillos Before Darren Wilson Shooting, Dorian Johnson Says|date=November 25, 2014|work=International Business Times|access-date=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson said that an altercation ensued when Brown attacked Wilson in his police vehicle for control of Wilson's gun until it was fired.{{sfn | USDOJ | 2015 | loc=pp. 80–81, &amp;sect;1. Shooting at the SUV}} Brown and Johnson then fled, with Wilson in pursuit of Brown. Wilson stated that Brown stopped and charged him after a short pursuit. In the entire altercation, Wilson fired a total of twelve bullets, including twice during the struggle in the car;&lt;ref name=CNN.Told/&gt; the last was probably the fatal shot. Brown was hit a total of six times from the front.&lt;ref name=ABC.Survived/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYPost.Shot/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Autopsy/&gt;

This event ignited [[Ferguson unrest|unrest in Ferguson]]. Although a subsequent FBI investigation found that there was no evidence that Brown had his hands up in surrender or said "don't shoot" before he was shot, protesters believed that he had done so, and used the slogan "[[Hands up, don't shoot]]" in protest.  Protests, both peaceful and violent, continued for more than a week in Ferguson; police established a nightly curfew.&lt;!--ref name=Economist.Police/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC.Nixon/--&gt; The response of area police agencies in dealing with the protests was strongly criticized by the media and politicians. There were concerns over insensitivity, tactics, and a [[police militarization|militarized response]].&lt;!--ref name=Guardian.Points/&gt;&lt;ref name=IJR.Nixon/&gt;&lt;ref name=USAToday.Military/&gt;&lt;ref name=WashPost.Military/--&gt; Missouri governor [[Jay Nixon]] ordered local police organizations to cede much of their authority to the [[Missouri State Highway Patrol]].

A [[grand jury]] was called and given extensive evidence from [[Bob McCulloch (prosecutor)|Robert McCulloch]], the St. Louis County Prosecutor. On {{nowrap|November 24}}, 2014, McCulloch announced the [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]] grand jury had decided not to [[indictment|indict]] Wilson.&lt;ref name=Fox.Gunshots/&gt; On {{nowrap|March 4}}, 2015, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] reported the conclusion of its own investigation and cleared Wilson of civil rights violations in the shooting. It found forensic evidence supported the officer's account, that witnesses who corroborated the officer's account were credible, and that witnesses who had incriminated him were not credible, with some admitting they had not directly seen the events.&lt;ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yahoo.Feds/&gt; The U.S. Department of Justice concluded Wilson shot Brown in self-defense.&lt;ref name=LATimes.Federal/&gt;{{sfn |USDOJ |2015 | pp=80–82}}

=== Morning ===
Surveillance video which was publicly released in the 2017 documentary film ''Stranger Fruit'' shows Michael Brown walking into Ferguson Market and Liquor at 1:13&amp;nbsp;a.m., twelve hours before he entered the store for the final time. The footage shows Brown handing a young clerk a brown package, believed by the filmmaker to be marijuana, and then receiving an unpurchased package of cigarillos from the store. After the video was rediscovered and made public in 2017, some, including Brown's family, said they believed Brown had left the package there for safekeeping and later returned to retrieve it. The store owner disputed this through an attorney who dismissed claims that the store traded him "cigarillos for pot." The lawyer claimed "[t]he reason he [Brown] gave it back is he was walking out the door with unpaid merchandise and they [the staff] wanted it back."&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Wrinkle/&gt; The store's attorney said the video had been in the hands of Brown's family and law enforcement since the initial investigation, and said the video had been edited to remove the portion where the store clerk returned Brown's package to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/ferguson-market-disputes-claims-as-new-michael-brown-documentary-prompts/article_fc382406-dbd5-5f53-aeda-4de3f2d5d31e.html|title=Ferguson Market disputes claims as new Michael Brown documentary prompts new protest|work=stltoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, on March 13, 2017, unedited footage from the store was released by the St. Louis county prosecutor to try to settle questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/ferguson-video-about-death-of-michael-brown-rekindles-unrest-arrests/article_d484096d-dbe1-5818-b2c7-4a7c21fad2f3.html|title=Ferguson video about death of Michael Brown rekindles unrest, arrests|last=Currier|first=Christine Byers, Joel|work=stltoday.com|date=March 14, 2017|access-date=June 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incident ==
At {{nowrap|11:47 a.m.}}, Wilson responded to a call about a baby with breathing problems and drove to Glenark Drive, east of Canfield Drive.&lt;ref name=STLToday.Radio/&gt; About three minutes later and several blocks away, Brown was recorded on camera stealing a box of Swisher cigars and forcefully shoving a Ferguson Market clerk. Brown and his friend, Dorian Johnson, left the market at about {{nowrap|11:54 a.m.}}&lt;ref name=KWMU.Know/&gt; At 11:53, a police dispatcher reported "stealing in progress" at the Ferguson Market and described the suspect as a black male wearing a white T-shirt running toward QuikTrip. The suspect was reported as having stolen a box of Swisher cigars.&lt;ref name=STLToday.Radio/&gt; At 11:57, the dispatch described the suspect as wearing a red [[St. Louis Cardinals]] hat, a white T-shirt, yellow socks, and khaki shorts, and that he was accompanied by another male.&lt;ref name=STLToday.Radio/&gt; At {{nowrap|12:00 p.m.}}, Wilson reported he was back in service and radioed units 25 and 22 to ask if they needed his assistance in searching for the suspects.&lt;ref name=STLToday.Radio/&gt; Seven seconds later, an unidentified officer said the suspects had disappeared.&lt;ref name=STLToday.Radio/&gt; Wilson called for backup at 12:02, saying "[Unit] 21. Put me on Canfield with two. And send me another car."&lt;ref name=STLToday.Radio/&gt;

Initially, reports of what happened next differed widely among sources and witnesses, particularly with regards to whether Brown was coming towards Wilson when the shots were actually fired. At noon on {{nowrap|August 9}}, Wilson drove up to Brown and Johnson as they were walking in the middle of Canfield Drive and ordered them to move off the street. Wilson continued driving past the two men, but then backed up and stopped close to them.&lt;ref name=CBS.Suspect/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Autopsy/&gt;&lt;ref name=IBTimes.Johnson/&gt;&lt;ref name=USAToday.Cigars/&gt; A struggle took place between Brown and Wilson after the former reached through the window of the police SUV, a [[Chevrolet Tahoe#Police package|Chevrolet Tahoe]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Recount/&gt; Wilson's gun was fired twice during the struggle from inside the vehicle, with one bullet hitting Brown's right hand.&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Recount/&gt;&lt;ref name=WashPost.Chaos/&gt; Brown and Johnson fled and Johnson hid behind a car.&lt;ref name=CNN.Shooting/&gt; Wilson got out of the vehicle and pursued Brown.&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Happened/&gt; At some point, Wilson fired his gun again, while facing Brown, and hit him with at least 6 shots.&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Autopsy/&gt; Brown was unarmed and died on the street.&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Recount/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN.Violence/&gt; Less than 90 seconds passed from the time Wilson encountered Brown to the time of Brown's death.&lt;ref name=Newsweek.90Seconds/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes.90Seconds/&gt;

An unidentified officer arrived on the scene and, 73 seconds after Wilson's call, asked where the second suspect was. Thirty-one seconds later, a supervisor was requested by Unit 25. At {{nowrap|12:07 p.m.}}, an officer on scene radioed to dispatch for more units.&lt;ref name=STLToday.Radio/&gt; Also at 12:07, the {{nowrap|St. Louis}} County police were notified and county officers began arriving on scene at around {{nowrap|12:15 p.m.}} The {{nowrap|St. Louis}} County detectives were notified at {{nowrap|12:43 p.m.}} and arrived about {{nowrap|1:30 p.m.}}, with the forensic investigator arriving at about {{nowrap|2:30 p.m.}}&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Body/&gt;

Police dispatched a dozen units to the scene by {{nowrap|1:00 p.m.}} with another dozen, including two canine units, by {{nowrap|2:00 p.m.}} Gunshots were recorded in Ferguson police logs at {{nowrap|2:11 p.m.}}, and by the ambulance dispatch again at {{nowrap|2:14 p.m.}}, which led to the response of 20 units from eight different municipal forces in the next 20 minutes. As the situation deteriorated, the police commanders had investigators seek cover and detectives assisted in crowd control. At {{nowrap|2:45}}, four canine units arrived on scene, and the [[SWAT]] team arrived at {{nowrap|3:20 p.m.}}&lt;ref name=STLToday.LeftThere/&gt; The medical examiner began his examination at around {{nowrap|3:30 p.m.}} and concluded about half an hour later, with the body being cleared to be taken to the morgue.&lt;ref name=STLToday.LeftThere/&gt;&lt;ref name=Newsweek.Scene/&gt; At {{nowrap|4:37 p.m.}}, Brown's body was signed in by workers at the morgue.&lt;ref name=STLToday.LeftThere/&gt;

== Investigations ==

===Police===
Brown was fatally shot by Wilson at about 12:02&amp;nbsp;p.m. The Ferguson Police Department was on the scene within minutes, as were crowds of residents, some expressing hostility toward the police. Paramedics covered the body with sheets. About {{nowrap|20 minutes}} after the shooting, the Ferguson Police Chief turned over the homicide investigation to the St. Louis County Police Department (SLCPD). The arrival of SLCPD detectives took about {{nowrap|70 minutes}}, as they were occupied with another crime scene {{nowrap|37 minutes}} away. On arrival at 1:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., they put up privacy screens around the body. Their investigation was slowed due to safety concerns regarding the sound of gunfire in the area and some hostile members of the crowd encroaching on the crime scene. An investigator from the St. Louis County Medical Examiner's office arrived at 2:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. Brown's body was removed at 4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |USDOJ |2015 | pages=8–9}}, Section B. Initial Law Enforcement Investigation&lt;/ref&gt; Local residents criticized authorities for leaving Brown's body in the street for 4 hours in an action seen as demeaning and disrespectful.&lt;ref name=STLToday.LeftThere/&gt;

===Department of Justice===
On {{nowrap|August 11}}, 2014, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) opened a civil rights investigation into the incident.&lt;ref name=WashPost.FBI/&gt;  A spokeswoman for the FBI's St. Louis field office said the decision to open an investigation was not motivated by the protests and riots which had ensued.&lt;ref name=NBC.FBI/&gt; Forty FBI agents went door-to-door looking for potential witnesses who may have had information about the shooting.&lt;ref name="Fox.Curfew" /&gt;  Additionally, attorneys from the [[United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division|Civil Rights Division]] and from the [[United States Attorney|United States Attorney's Office]] were participating in the investigation.&lt;ref name="Vox.FBI" /&gt;

On {{nowrap|March 4}}, 2015, the federal investigation cleared Wilson of civil rights violations in the shooting. The investigation concluded there was no evidence upon which prosecutors could rely to disprove Wilson's asserted belief that he feared for his safety, that witnesses who contradicted Wilson were not credible, that forensic evidence and credible witnesses corroborated Wilson's account, and that the facts did not support the filing of criminal charges against Wilson.&lt;ref name=Yahoo.Feds/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Cleared/&gt;{{sfn |USDOJ |2015 | p=12}} Credible witnesses did not support accounts that Brown had his hands up in surrender. He was not shot in the back. Forensic evidence showed he was moving toward Wilson. Numerous witnesses were found to have given accounts of actions they were unable to see from their vantage points, or to be recounting others' accounts.&lt;ref name=Yahoo.Feds/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Cleared/&gt;{{sfn |USDOJ |2015 | p=12}}

==Grand jury hearing==
The [[Grand juries in the United States|grand jury]] was made up of members who had been impaneled in May 2014 for a regularly scheduled term, to hear all cases put forward by the prosecuting attorney's office. There were three black members (one man and two women) and nine whites (six men and three women), an ethnic breakdown that roughly reflects the [[Race (human classification)|racial]] makeup of {{nowrap|St. Louis}} County,&lt;ref name=STLToday.Jury/&gt; which is about 30% black, and 70% white.&lt;ref name=CSM.Deliberations/&gt; On {{nowrap|August 20}}, 2014, the grand jury started hearing evidence in the case ''State of Missouri v. Darren Wilson'', in order to decide whether a crime was committed and if there was probable cause to believe Wilson committed it.&lt;ref name=LATimes.Grand/&gt;

There was intense interest focused on the grand jury. [[Bob McCulloch (prosecutor)|Robert P. McCulloch]], the elected prosecuting attorney for {{nowrap|St. Louis}} County, was in charge of the prosecution but did not participate in the direct handling of the grand jury hearing.&lt;ref name=STLAmerican.Struggle/&gt;&lt;ref name=WashPost.Outcome/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYer.HowNot/&gt; It was handled by two Assistant Prosecuting Attorneys of McCulloch's office: Kathi Alizadeh and Sheila Whirley.&lt;ref name=WashPost.Outcome/&gt; McCulloch announced an unusual process: the grand jury would hear all the evidence, the proceedings would be transcribed, and the materials would be made public if the grand jury did not indict.&lt;ref name=WashPost.Fair/&gt;

The grand jury took 25 days, over the span of three months, to hear more than 5,000 pages of testimony from 60 witnesses and then deliberate on whether or not to indict Wilson.&lt;ref name=WashPost.Fair/&gt;&lt;ref name=USAToday.Charges/&gt;&lt;!-- Ref bundle --&gt; Most grand juries complete their work in a matter of days.&lt;ref name=WashPost.Fair/&gt; The grand jury was not [[Jury sequestration|sequestered]] during the process.&lt;ref name=NPR.Examining/&gt; &lt;!--On {{nowrap|September 16}}, Wilson testified before the grand jury for more than four hours and, according to sources with knowledge of the investigation{{who|date=November 2014}}, Wilson was "cooperative". Wilson was not obligated to testify.&lt;ref name=STLToday.Appears/&gt; The transcript of Wilson's testimony from {{nowrap|September 16}} was released after the grand jury's decision was announced.&lt;ref name=County.Transcript5/&gt; On {{nowrap|November 17}}, Governor Nixon declared a state of emergency and activated the [[Missouri National Guard]] prior to the grand jury decision being announced.&lt;ref name=CNN.Emergency/&gt; &lt;ref name=KWMU.Wrangled/&gt;--&gt;

On the night of {{nowrap|November 24}}, Prosecutor McCulloch reported in a 20-minute press conference that the grand jury had reached a decision in the case and would not indict Wilson.&lt;ref name=CNN.Fires/&gt;

Following his announcement, McCulloch released thousands of pages of grand jury documents, with materials published on the Internet for public perusal.&lt;ref name=NPR.Testimony/&gt; The documents include transcripts of the proceedings, expert statements, and the testimony of some witnesses.&lt;ref name=SeattleTimes.Evidence/&gt; On {{nowrap|December 8}}, more witness interviews and more than 50 brief audio recordings between the police dispatchers and responding police officers were released.&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Audio/&gt; On {{nowrap|December 13}}, a third release included the transcripts of witness interviews, including one with Dorian Johnson.&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Files/&gt; A video of the two-hour interview of Johnson by FBI and county police was withheld.&lt;ref name=DFP.Withheld/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC.Federal/&gt;

Robert P. McCulloch was the main focus of much of the criticism throughout the process and well into its aftermath. Attorney Raul Reyes characterized McCulloch as not being impartial, as his father was a police officer killed in an incident with a black suspect and other members of his family served with the {{nowrap|St. Louis}} Police Department.&lt;ref name=CNN.Unfair/&gt;  A petition calling for McCulloch to recuse himself gained 70,000 signatures.&lt;ref name=NBC.Petition/&gt;&lt;ref name=STLToday.Controversy/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Objectivity/&gt;&lt;ref name=STLToday.Petitions/&gt; Governor Jay Nixon declined to remove McCulloch and said doing so would potentially jeopardize the prosecution.&lt;ref name=STLToday.Remove/&gt; McCulloch dismissed the claims of bias, and later said he regretted not speaking publicly about his background at the time.&lt;ref name=WashPost.Outcome/&gt;&lt;ref name=KTRS.McGraw/&gt;

Legal analysts raised concerns over McCulloch's unorthodox approach, &lt;!-- Explain normal process and role of prosecutor --&gt;saying this process could have influenced the grand jury to decide against indictment and that they were given too much material to assess.&lt;ref name=USAToday.Probe/&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes.Strategy/&gt; The analysts highlighted the significant differences between a typical grand jury proceeding in Missouri and how Wilson's case was handled.&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Happened/&gt;

== Evidence ==

===Shooting scene===
Evidence presented to the grand jury showed the shooting scene extended approximately {{Convert|184|ft}} along Canfield Drive, near where it intersects Copper Creek Court. The two-lane street runs in an approximately west-to-east direction and has sidewalks and curbs on both sides. Immediately prior to the incident, Brown was walking eastbound on Canfield and Wilson was driving westbound. Evidence at the scene was generally clustered around Wilson's SUV on the western side of the scene and near Brown's body, which was in the eastern part of the area.
{{center|'''Diagram of shooting scene'''{{R|STLToday.Map|NYTimes.Documents|NYTimes.Happened|WashPost.Collected}}}}
[[File:Michael Brown shooting scene diagram.svg|frameless|1000px|center]]

The {{Convert|30|ft|adj=on}} western area included Wilson's police vehicle, which was angled slightly toward the right curb with its left-rear corner on the center line. Evidence included two bracelets, a baseball cap, and two [[.40 S&amp;W|.40 caliber]] spent [[Cartridge (firearms)|casings]]. One of these casings was found at the western edge of the scene and the other was located near the rear driver's side of the police vehicle. There were two groups of red stains near the driver's side of the vehicle and a left [[flip-flops|sandal]] was also located in the vicinity. The right sandal was approximately {{Convert|44|ft}} east of the western area.

The eastern area, which was approximately {{Convert|124|ft}} east of the western area, was about {{Convert|29|ft}} wide. Brown's body was situated along the center-line of the road with his head oriented in a westerly direction. The distance from the driver's door of the SUV to Brown's head was about {{Convert|153|ft}}. Two groups of red stains were located at the extreme eastern edge of the scene, with the furthest under {{Convert|22|ft}} from Brown's feet.

One apparent projectile was found near the body. There were ten spent {{nowrap|.40-caliber}} casings scattered on the south side of the road near Brown's body. The distribution of the casings, combined with most of the casings being east of the body, was consistent with the officer moving backward while firing.&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Documents/&gt; Blood spatter approximately 25 feet behind Brown's body suggested he was moving toward Wilson when he was killed.&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Happened/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Trusting/&gt;

=== DNA ===
Brown's DNA was found on the gun. His DNA was also found on the left thigh of Wilson's pants and on the inside driver's door handle of Wilson's police SUV,&lt;ref name=WashPost.Chaos/&gt; the result of Brown's spilled blood staining Wilson's pants and the door handle.&lt;ref name=PPH.Tussle/&gt; Wilson's DNA was found on Brown's left palm but was not found under Brown's fingernails or on his right hand.&lt;ref name=WashPost.Chaos/&gt;

Dr. Michael Graham, the St. Louis medical examiner, said blood was found on Wilson's gun and inside the car, and tissue from Brown was found on the exterior of the driver's side of Wilson's vehicle; this evidence was consistent with a struggle at that location. According to Judy Melinek, a San Francisco pathologist who commented on the case as an expert, the official autopsy, which said Brown's hand had foreign matter consistent with a gun discharge on it, supported Wilson's testimony that Brown was reaching for the weapon,&lt;ref name=STLToday.Autopsy/&gt; or indicated the gun was inches away from Brown's hand when it went off.&lt;ref name=WashPost.Chaos/&gt;

According to the detective who performed tests on the gun, he had to decide whether to perform a DNA test or dust for fingerprints, because only one test can be performed without affecting the other.&lt;ref name=WashPost.Chaos/&gt; He found the gun stored in an unsealed envelope, contrary to the customary evidence-handling protocol.&lt;ref name=WSJ.Testimony/&gt; Documents released after the grand jury proceedings show Wilson washed blood from his hands and checked his own gun into an evidence bag, both actions described by media outlets as unorthodox procedures for such a case.&lt;ref name=STLToday.Tidbits/&gt;&lt;ref name=WashPost.Unorthodox/&gt;

}} were performed on Brown's body, with all three noting Brown had been shot at least six times, including twice in the head. He received no shots in his back.&lt;ref name=WashPost.Friend/&gt;

The county autopsy report described gunshot entry and exit wounds to Brown's right arm coming from both the front ([[Dorsoventral|ventral]], [[Standard anatomical position|palms facing forward]]) and the back (dorsal, palms facing backward).&lt;ref name=County.Autopsy/&gt;

====County====
The local medical examiner autopsy report released to state prosecutors said Brown was shot in the front part of his body. When Mary Case, the {{nowrap|St. Louis}} County medical examiner, was asked to provide details, she declined to comment further, citing the ongoing investigation into Brown's death.&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Accounts/&gt;&lt;ref name=WashPost.County/&gt; The official county autopsy was later leaked to the ''{{nowrap|St. Louis}} Post-Dispatch''.&lt;ref name=PBS.Autopsy/&gt;&lt;ref name=STLToday.Autopsy/&gt;

The narrative report of investigation from the office of the medical examiner of {{nowrap|St. Louis}} agreed with Wilson's testimony.&lt;ref name=STLToday.Autopsy/&gt; It noted Brown had sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the head, torso, and right arm, as well as a single gunshot wound to the inside of his right hand near his thumb and palm; it also noted Brown's body had [[abrasion (medical)|abrasions]] to the right side of his face and on the back of his left hand.&lt;ref name=STLToday.Autopsy/&gt;

The autopsy noted the absence of [[stippling]], powder burns around a wound that indicate a shot was fired at a relatively short range. Dr. Michael Graham, the {{nowrap|St. Louis}} medical examiner, notes gunshot wounds within an inch of the body do not always cause stippling. Microscopic examination of tissue taken from the thumb wound detected the presence of a foreign material consistent with the material which is ejected from a gun while firing.&lt;ref name=STLToday.Autopsy/&gt; The gunshot wound to the top of Brown's head was consistent with Brown either falling forward or being in a lunging position; the shot was instantly fatal.&lt;ref name=STLToday.Autopsy/&gt;

A toxicology test performed by a {{nowrap|St. Louis}} University laboratory revealed the presence of [[THC]], the active ingredient in [[marijuana]], in Brown's blood and urine. The presence of THC indicates Brown had used marijuana within a few hours of his death, but it could not be determined whether or not Brown was impaired at the time of his death.&lt;ref name=STLToday.Autopsy/&gt;

====Independent====
At the request of Brown's family, on {{nowrap|August 17}} a preliminary autopsy was conducted by Dr. [[Michael Baden]], a former chief medical examiner for the City of New York (1978–1979). This autopsy was limited because the previous county autopsy had washed, embalmed, and taken evidence off the body.&lt;ref name=KTVI.Baden/&gt;&lt;ref name=USAToday.Pathologist/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN.Transcript/&gt;&lt;ref name=PBS.Evidence/&gt;

According to Baden's report, Brown was shot six times into his front: four of the bullets entered his right arm, one entered his right eye on a downward trajectory, and one entered the top of his skull.&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Autopsy/&gt; All of the rounds were fired from a distance of at least one foot.&lt;ref name=LATimes.Autopsy/&gt; One of the shots shattered his right eye, traveled through his face, then exited his jaw and reentered his collarbone. The shot that entered the top of his skull caused the fatal injury.&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Autopsy/&gt; Brown could have survived the first bullet wounds, but the bullet that entered the top of his head resulted in a fatal injury.&lt;ref name=SeattleTimes.Hands/&gt;

Baden had no access to the clothing of the victim, and had not yet seen the x-rays showing where bullets were in the body. He could not determine if any gunpowder residue was on that clothing. Baden concluded there was too little information to forensically reconstruct the shooting.&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Autopsy/&gt; At least two commentators noted the results of both autopsies contradicted some aspects of some eyewitness accounts, which had reported Wilson shot Brown in the back&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Autopsy/&gt; and that Wilson shot Brown while holding Brown's neck.&lt;ref name=WashPost.Autopsy/&gt; In later analysis, Baden reclassified one of Brown's chest wounds as an entry wound.&lt;ref name=KSDK.Crump/&gt;

Dr. Baden was assisted by Shawn Parcells, who does not have a degree or other credentials in medicine or pathology.&lt;ref name=WDAF.Credentials/&gt;&lt;ref name=KCStar.Assistant/&gt; Dr. Thomas Young, former [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] Medical Examiner, said Parcells is giving out forensic pathology opinions when he is not qualified to do so.&lt;ref name=WDAF.Credentials/&gt; Dr. Mary Case, who performed the initial autopsy, said Parcells' involvement could cause issues with the second autopsy.&lt;ref name=DailyCaller.Examiner/&gt; Parcells said all he did was assist Dr. Baden.&lt;ref name=KMBC.Pathologist/&gt;

====Federal====
Attorney General Holder ordered a third autopsy of Brown's body.&lt;ref name=STLToday.Holder/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBS.Autopsy/&gt; Its findings matched the other two autopsies, but its detailed findings were initially withheld from the public due to the ongoing investigation.&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Accounts/&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes.Documents/&gt; The federal autopsy report was among a group of documents released by the {{nowrap|St. Louis}} County Prosecutor's Office on {{nowrap|December 8}}, two weeks after the grand jury chose not to indict Wilson.&lt;ref name=LATimes.Documents/&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes.FederalAutopsy/&gt;

===Audio recording of gunshots===
On {{nowrap|August 27}}, CNN released an audio recording purported to contain the sounds of the shooting.&lt;ref name=CNN.Analyzing/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN.Audio/&gt; The recording was made by an anonymous third-party who happened to be recording a video-text message at the time of the incident.&lt;ref name=NBC.Probing/&gt; [[Glide (software)|Glide]], a video messaging service, confirmed the audio had been recorded on their site at {{nowrap|12:02 p.m.}} on the day of the shooting.&lt;ref name=CNN.Captured/&gt;&lt;ref name=Glide.Verifies/&gt; The twelve-second recording contains a series of shots, a short pause, and then a second series of shots.&lt;ref name=NBC.Probing/&gt;

Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg says he heard six shots, a pause, and then four additional shots. Ginsberg said, "I was very concerned about that pause ... because it's not just the number of gunshots, it's how they're fired. And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up."&lt;ref name=CNN.Audio/&gt; CNN's law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes noted most accounts of the shooting say there was a single shot earlier in the incident near the vehicle that is not audible in the recording.&lt;ref name=CNN.Alleged/&gt;&lt;ref name=WashPost.Audio/&gt; The recording was also analyzed by [[ShotSpotter|SST, Inc.]], a company specializing in [[gunfire locator]] technology. That analysis found the sound of ten gunshots and seven gunshot echoes within seven seconds, with a three-second pause after the sixth shot. The company's analysis also said all ten rounds were fired from within a radius of {{convert|3|ft|m}}, indicating the shooter was not moving.&lt;ref name=WashPost.Acoustic/&gt;

=== Handling ===

''The Washington Post'' said there were unorthodox forensic practices shown in the published testimony of Wilson and other law enforcement officials. It said Wilson washed blood off of his hands without photographing them first. It also said Wilson submitted his gun to evidence by himself, and that initial interviews of Wilson were conducted with other personnel present and were not taped. It described Wilson's face injuries after the shooting as photographed by a local detective at the Fraternal Order of Police building, instead of at Ferguson Police headquarters. An investigator with the {{nowrap|St. Louis}} County Medical Examiner's office testified he decided not to take measurements at the crime scene nor did he photograph the scene, instead relying on photographs taken by the {{nowrap|St. Louis}} County Police Department.&lt;ref name=BostonGlobe.Unorthodox/&gt;

== Witness accounts ==

Multiple witnesses saw part or all of the event and have given interviews to the media, testified to the grand jury, and were interviewed by the U.S. Department of Justice.  The witness accounts were conflicting on various points.&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Accounts/&gt;&lt;ref name=IBTimes.Accounts/&gt;&lt;ref name=HLN.Accounts/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN.Narratives/&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes.Witnesses/&gt;&lt;ref name=KTVI.Stories/&gt; David A. Klinger, a [[criminologist]] at the [[University of Missouri–St. Louis|University of Missouri–{{nowrap|St. Louis}}]], said eyewitness testimony often differs from witness to witness, a phenomenon commonly known as the [[Rashomon effect]].&lt;ref name=STLToday.Witness/&gt;

An [[Associated Press]] review of the grand jury found numerous problems in the witness testimony, including statements that were "inconsistent, fabricated, or provably&lt;!-- "PROVABLY" IS CORRECT PER SOURCE. DO NOT CHANGE TO "PROBABLY". --&gt; wrong". Several of the witnesses admitted changing their testimony to fit released evidence, or other witness statements.&lt;ref name=AP.Papers/&gt; Prosecuting attorney Robert McCulloch said, "I thought it was important to present anybody and everybody, and some that were, yes, clearly not telling the truth, no question about it."&lt;ref name=Guardian.Lied/&gt;

The Department of Justice investigation into the shooting determined witnesses who corroborated Wilson's account were credible while those who contradicted his account were not. The witnesses that claimed Brown was surrendering or did not move toward Wilson were not credible; the report said their claims were inconsistent with the physical evidence, other witness statements, and in some cases prior statements from the same witness. No witness statements that pointed to Wilson's guilt were determined to be credible. Twenty-four statements were determined to lack any credibility, while eight which were found credible corroborated Wilson's account. Nine did not completely contradict nor corroborate Wilson's account.&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Cleared/&gt; Several witnesses reported fear of reprisals from the community for providing evidence that corroborated Wilson's account.&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Cleared/&gt;

===Wilson's interview and testimony===
[[File:Darren wilson bruise.jpg|thumb|Bruising on Wilson's face after the shooting]]
Wilson gave his account of the incident in an interview with a detective on {{nowrap|August 10}}, and in testimony before the grand jury in September. Wilson said he had just left a call involving a sick person when he heard on his radio that there was a theft in progress at a local convenience store. Wilson heard the description of the suspects and soon after observed two black males walking down the middle of the street. Wilson pulled up to them and told the two to walk on the sidewalk, and Johnson replied, "we're almost to our destination". As they passed his window, Brown said "fuck what you have to say".&lt;ref name=CBS.Documents/&gt;

Wilson then backed up about ten feet to where they were and attempted to open his door. After backing up, Wilson told the two to "come here", and Brown told him in reply, "what the fuck are you gonna do". Wilson shut the door and Brown approached him and he opened the door again "trying to push him back", while telling him to get back. Brown "started swinging and punching at me from outside the vehicle", and Brown had his body against the door. Wilson said the first strike from Brown was a "glancing blow", and at that point he was trying to get Brown's arms out of his face. This was when Brown turned to his left and handed Johnson several packs of the stolen cigarillos he had been holding.&lt;ref name=CBS.Documents/&gt; Wilson then grabbed Brown's right arm trying to get control, but Brown hit him in the face. Wilson said he "felt like a 5-year-old holding onto [[Hulk Hogan]]" while he attempted to restrain Brown when he reached through his police car window.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg.HulkHogan/&gt; Wilson said it "jarred" him back and he yelled at Brown numerous times to stop and get back. Wilson said he thought about using his mace and his [[Expandable baton|baton]], but he was unable to reach either of them. He then drew his weapon and pointed it at Brown and told him to stop or he would shoot him, while ordering him to the ground.&lt;ref name=CBS.Documents/&gt;

According to Wilson, Brown then said "you're too much of a fucking pussy to shoot me" and grabbed for his gun and twisted it, pointing it at him, into his hip area. Wilson placed his left hand against Brown's hand and his other hand on the gun and pushed forward with both his arms. The gun was somewhat lined up with Brown, and Wilson pulled the trigger twice, but the weapon failed to discharge. On the next try, the gun fired and Brown then attempted to hit him multiple times inside his vehicle. Wilson shot at Brown again, but missed and he took off running east, while Wilson exited his vehicle and radioed for backup. Wilson followed him, yelling for him to stop and get on the ground, but he kept running. Brown eventually stopped and turned and made a "grunting noise" and started running at him with his right hand under his shirt in his waistband. Brown ignored Wilson's commands to stop and get on the ground, so Wilson fired multiple shots at him, paused and yelled at him to get on the ground again, but Brown was still charging at him and had not slowed down. Wilson then fired another set of shots, but Brown was still running at him. When Brown was about eight to ten feet away, Wilson fired more shots, with one of those hitting Brown in the head, which brought him down with his hand still in his waistband. Wilson said two patrol cars showed up approximately fifteen to twenty seconds after the final shot. When his supervisor arrived, he was sent to the police station.&lt;ref name=CBS.Documents/&gt;

Wilson told detectives Brown had reached his right hand into his waistband and that the hand still appeared to be in the waistband after Brown was shot. The medical investigator at the scene of the shooting did not take any photographs and testified to the grand jury that Brown's left hand was under his dead body, near the waistband, and the right hand was extended outwards.&lt;ref name=CNN.Testimony/&gt;

On {{nowrap|November 26}}, Wilson gave his first public interview about the shooting to [[ABC News]]' [[George Stephanopoulos]].&lt;ref name=ABC.Discusses/&gt;

===Corroborating Wilson's testimony===
Numerous witness accounts were consistent with Wilson's account and also agreed with the physical evidence at hand. Many witnesses corroborated that Wilson acted in self-defense during the event. A number of the witnesses who corroborated Wilson's account of events expressed fear and apprehension in testifying, saying they had been harassed or threatened by individuals from the Ferguson community.&lt;ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/&gt;{{rp|pp.27–34}} The following are a sample of the witnesses whose accounts aligned with Wilson's testimony.

Witness 102 was a 27-year-old biracial male. He said he saw Wilson chase Brown until Brown abruptly turned around. Brown did not put his hands up in surrender but made some type of movement similar to pulling his pants up or a shoulder shrug and then made a full charge at Wilson. Witness 102 thought Wilson's life was threatened and he only fired shots when Brown was coming toward him.&lt;ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/&gt;{{rp|pp.27–28}}

After the shooting Witness 102 remained in the neighborhood for a short period of time, and corrected a couple of people who claimed Wilson "stood over [Brown] and shot while [he was] on the ground". In response, Witness 102 said Wilson shot Brown because Brown came back toward Wilson. Witness 102 "kept thinking" Wilson's shots were "missing" Brown because Brown kept moving.&lt;ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/&gt;{{rp|p.28}} Witness 102 did not stay in the neighborhood for long, and left the area shortly afterward because he felt uncomfortable. According to the witness, "crowds of people had begun to gather, wrongly claiming the police shot Brown for no reason and that he had his hands up in surrender". Two black women approached Witness 102, mobile phones set to record, asking him to recount what he had witnessed. Witness 102 responded that they would not like what he had to say. The women responded with racial slurs, calling him names like 'white motherfucker'."&lt;ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/&gt;{{rp|p.28}}

Witness 103, a 58-year-old black male, testified that from his parked truck he saw "Brown punching Wilson at least three times in the facial area, through the open driver's window of the SUV... Wilson and Brown [had] hold of each other's shirts, but Brown was 'getting in a couple of blows [on Wilson]'."&lt;ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/&gt;{{rp|p.29}} Wilson was leaning back toward the passenger seat with his forearm up, in an effort to block the blows. Then Witness 103 heard a gunshot and Brown took off running. Wilson exited the SUV, appeared to be using his shoulder microphone to call into his radio, and chased Brown with his gun held low ... Brown came to a stop near a car, put his hand down on the car, and turned around to face Wilson. Brown's hands were then down at his sides. Witness 103 did not see Brown's hands up. Wanting to leave, Witness 103 began to turn his car around in the opposite direction that Brown had been running when he heard additional shots. Witness 103 turned to his right, and saw Brown "moving fast" toward Wilson. Witness 103 then drove away."&lt;ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/&gt;{{rp|p.29}}

Witness 104, a 26-year-old biracial female, witnessed the end of the altercation from a minivan:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Witness 104] saw Brown run from the SUV, followed by Wilson, who "hopped" out of the SUV and ran after him while yelling "stop, stop, stop". Wilson did not fire his gun as Brown ran from him. Brown then turned around and "for a second" began to raise his hands as though he may have considered surrendering, but then quickly "balled up in fists" in a running position and "charged" at Wilson. Witness 104 described it as a "tackle run", explaining Brown "wasn't going to stop". Wilson fired his gun only as Brown charged at him, backing up as Brown came toward him. Witness 104 explained there were three separate volleys of shots. Each time, Brown ran toward Wilson, Wilson fired, Brown paused, Wilson stopped firing, and then Brown charged again. The pattern continued until Brown fell to the ground, "smashing" his face upon impact. Wilson did not fire while Brown momentarily had his hands up. Witness 104 explained it took some time for Wilson to fire, adding that she "would have fired sooner". Wilson did not go near Brown's body after Brown fell to his death.&lt;ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/&gt;{{rp|p.30}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Witness 108, a 74-year-old black male, told detectives the police officer was "in the right" and "did what he had to do", and that statements made by people in the apartment complex about Brown surrendering were inaccurate. Witness 108 later told investigators he "would have fucking shot that boy, too", and mimicked the aggressive stance Brown made while charging Wilson. He explained Wilson told Brown to "stop" or "get down" at least ten times, but instead Brown "charged" at Wilson. Witness 108 also told detectives there were other witnesses on Canfield Drive who saw what he did.&lt;ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/&gt;{{rp|p.32}}

Witness 109, a 53-year-old black male, said he decided to come forward after seeing Dorian Johnson "lie" about the events on television.&lt;ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/&gt;{{rp|p.32}} He said when Wilson asked the two boys to get out of the street, Brown responded something to the effect of "Fuck the police." Afterward, Wilson got out of his car and Brown hit him in the face. Witness 109 said he saw Wilson reach for his taser but dropped it and then grabbed a gun, after which Brown grabbed for Wilson's gun. According to 109, at one point Brown ran away from Wilson, but turned around and charged toward the officer. He said Wilson fired in self-defense, and did not appear to be shooting to kill at first.&lt;ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/&gt;{{rp|p.33}}

Witness 113, a 31-year-old black female, made statements that corroborated Wilson's account. She said she was afraid of the "neighborhood backlash" that might come from her testimony, and feared offering an account contrary to the narrative reported by the media that Brown held his hands up in surrender.&lt;ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/&gt;{{rp|pp.33–34}} She also told investigators she thought Wilson's life was in danger.

Witness 136 was in his apartment using a video chat application on his mobile phone while the shooting occurred. After hearing the first few shots, he recorded the remainder of his chat on his phone and turned it over to the FBI. The recording is about 12 seconds long and captured a total of 10 gunshots. The gunshots begin after the first four seconds. The recording captured six gunshots in two seconds. After a three-second pause, a seventh gunshot is heard. A pause of less than one second gave way to the final three-shot volley within two seconds. The recording was not time-stamped. As detailed below, this recording is consistent with several credible witness accounts as well as Wilson's account, that he fired several volleys of shots, briefly pausing between each one.&lt;ref name=DOJ.ShootingReport/&gt;{{rp|pp.24–25}}

===Contradicting Wilson's testimony===
Several witnesses who originally testified against Wilson were also interviewed by the prosecution. They admitted to lying under oath as to the truthfulness of their testimony.&lt;ref name=WJLA.Lied/&gt;&lt;ref name=HuffPost.Lied/&gt; At least one witness took an account from a newspaper; this witness was later discredited by investigators during the process.&lt;ref name=HuffPost.Lied/&gt;

Witness 22, who originally claimed she saw Wilson kill Brown in cold blood, admitted she lied to investigators and never saw the incident at all. She said she was just passing along information which her boyfriend told her he saw.&lt;ref name=WJLA.Lied/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN.Credibility/&gt;&lt;ref name=WashPost.Inconsistency/&gt; The court transcript reads:

{{quote|''Prosecution''': You gave two statements, were both of those statements true?

'''Witness 22''': No. I just felt like I want to be part of something... I didn't see what I told the FBI what [''sic''] I saw.}}

Prosecutors also played the grand jury a 10-minute police interview with a man who claimed to have witnessed the shooting. They then played a phone call in which that man admitted he actually had not seen the incident at all.&lt;ref name=CNN.Credibility/&gt; Another witness insisted another officer was with Wilson at the time of the shooting. (By all other accounts, Wilson was the only officer present when he shot Brown). This witness described having a clear view of what transpired despite there being a building between the witness' location and where the incident took place.&lt;ref name=CNN.Credibility/&gt;

Witness 35 said Brown was "on his knees" when Wilson shot him in the head. Under questioning, his testimony fell apart, and he admitted fabricating it.&lt;ref name=CNN.Credibility/&gt;

{{quote|'''Prosecution''': What you are saying you saw isn't forensically possible based on the evidence. Are you telling us that the only thing that's true about all of your statements before this is that you saw that police officer shoot him at point blank range?
 
'''Witness 35''': Yes.&lt;ref name=CNN.Credibility/&gt;}}

Another witness described Brown on his hands and knees pleading for his life. After a prosecutor confronted the witness and told them what they had seen was not forensically possible based on the evidence, the witness later asked to leave.&lt;ref name=CNN.Credibility/&gt;

Another witness—number 37—testified that, during a confrontation at Wilson's vehicle, Wilson shot Brown point blank in the chest—but Brown did not fall over and was not clearly bleeding as he ran away. This witness gave several different accounts of how many shots were fired. While he was further pressed for answers as to the truthfulness of his statements, he instead posed questions in return, refusing to elaborate on his statements.

{{quote|'''Prosecution''': You told three different stories in the time we've been here today. So I want to know which one is really your memory or did you see this at all?

'''Witness 37''': If none of my stuff is making any sense, like why do y'all keep contacting me?&lt;ref name=CNN.Credibility/&gt;}}

===Dorian Johnson===
Johnson, a friend of Brown, who was with him that day, gave his account of the incident to media outlets in August and testified before the grand jury in September. In media interviews, Johnson said Wilson pulled up beside them and said, "Get the f— on the sidewalk."&lt;ref name=CNN.Friend/&gt;&lt;ref name=MSNBC.Recounts/&gt;&lt;ref name=USAToday.Witness/&gt; The young men replied they were "not but a minute away from [their] destination, and [they] would shortly be out of the street".&lt;ref name=USAToday.Witness/&gt; Wilson drove forward without saying anything further and abruptly backed up, positioning his vehicle crosswise in their path. Wilson tried to open his door aggressively and the door ricocheted off both of their bodies and closed back on Wilson.&lt;ref name=CNN.Shooting/&gt; Wilson, still in his vehicle, grabbed Brown around his neck through the open window, and Brown tried to pull away, but Wilson continued to pull Brown toward him "like tug of war".&lt;ref name=LATimes.Witnesses/&gt;&lt;ref name=BostonGlobe.Autopsy/&gt; Johnson said Brown "did not reach for the officer's weapon at all", and was attempting to get free, when Wilson drew his weapon and said, "I'll shoot you" or "I'm going to shoot", and fired his weapon hitting Brown.&lt;ref name=MSNBC.Recounts/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN.Streets/&gt;&lt;ref name=RiverfrontTimes.Why/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yahoo.Crowd/&gt;&lt;ref name=STLToday.Fatal/&gt; Following the initial gunshot, Brown freed himself, and the two fled. Wilson exited the vehicle, and fired several rounds at the fleeing Brown, hitting him once in the back.&lt;ref name=CNN.Shooting/&gt;&lt;ref name=USAToday.Witness/&gt; Brown turned around with his hands raised and said, "I don't have a gun. Stop shooting!" Wilson then shot Brown several more times, killing him.&lt;ref name=CNN.Shooting/&gt;&lt;ref name=Time.Roots/&gt;

In his testimony to the grand jury, Johnson said he and Brown had walked to a convenience store to buy cigarillos, but Brown instead reached over the counter and took them and shoved a clerk on his way out the door.&lt;ref name=IBTimes.Cigarillos/&gt; Johnson testified that on their walk back home, Brown had the cigarillos in his hands in plain sight and two Ferguson police cars passed them, but did not stop.&lt;ref name=IBTimes.Cigarillos/&gt; When Wilson encountered them, he told the two to "get the fuck on the sidewalk" and Johnson told him they would be off the street shortly as they were close to their destination.&lt;ref name=NPR.Friend/&gt; Johnson testified Wilson was the aggressor from the beginning and that for no apparent reason, he backed his vehicle up and tried to open his door, but Brown shut it, preventing him from getting out.&lt;ref name=NPR.Friend/&gt; Johnson said Wilson then reached out and grabbed Brown by the neck and the two were engaged in a "tug of war", and Wilson said "I'll shoot". Johnson said he never saw Brown hit Wilson and did not think Brown grabbed for Wilson's gun, but that a shot was fired.&lt;ref name=NPR.Friend/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fox.Witness/&gt; At that point, Johnson said they both ran and Wilson fired while Brown was running away, Brown turned around and "at that time Big Mike's hands was up, but not so much in the air, because he had been struck".&lt;ref name=Fox.Witness/&gt; Johnson told the jurors Brown said "I don't have a gun", was mad and tried to say again "I don't have a gun", but "before he can say the second sentence or before he can even get it out, that's when the several more shots came." In his testimony, Johnson maintained Brown did not run at Wilson prior to the fatal shots.&lt;ref name=Fox.Witness/&gt;

{{See also|Ferguson unrest}}

=== August 9–14 ===
Peaceful protests and [[civil disorder]] broke out the day following Brown's shooting and lasted for several days. This was in part due to the belief among many that Brown was surrendering, as well as longstanding racial tensions between the majority-black population and the majority-white city government and police.&lt;ref name=WashPost.Even/&gt; As the details of the original shooting event emerged from investigators, police grappled with establishing curfews and maintaining order, while members of the Ferguson community demonstrated in various ways in the vicinity of the original shooting. On {{nowrap|August 10}}, a day of memorials began peacefully, but some crowd members became unruly after an evening candlelight vigil.&lt;ref name=NBC.Looting/&gt; Local police stations assembled approximately 150 officers in riot gear.&lt;ref name=ChiTrib.Protests/&gt; Some people began looting businesses, vandalizing vehicles, and confronting police officers who sought to block off access to several areas of the city.&lt;ref name=NBC.Looting/&gt; Widespread media coverage examined the post-[[September 11 attacks|9/11]] trend of local police departments arming themselves with military-grade weapons when dealing with protests.&lt;ref name=USAToday.Military/&gt;&lt;ref name=WashPost.Military/&gt; In the days following the shooting, state and federal officials weighed in on the matter. On {{nowrap|August 12}}, President [[Barack Obama]] offered his condolences to Brown's family and community.&lt;ref name=KMOV.Obama/&gt; On {{nowrap|August 14}}, Senator [[Rand Paul]] of Kentucky said in an op-ed in ''[[Time Magazine]]'', that the event was a tragedy and that police forces need to be demilitarized.&lt;ref name=Time.Paul/&gt;

=== August 15–30 ===
On {{nowrap|August 15}}, a report and video showing the robbery of a convenience store by Brown was released by the Ferguson Police Department. Brown was accompanied by his friend Dorian Johnson. The report and video were part of a packet that included information about the shooting afterward.&lt;ref name=NPR.Name/&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes.Veteran/&gt;&lt;ref name=KSDK.StrongArm/&gt; The report containing frames of the surveillance footage showed Brown grabbing a box of cigarillos, followed by an apparent struggle or confrontation between Brown and a store clerk.&lt;ref name=WashPost.Three/&gt;&lt;ref name=WashPost.Suspect/&gt; The statutory deadline in the Sunshine Law, Missouri's equivalent of the federal Freedom of Information Act, was the cited reason for the release following requests by ''{{nowrap|St. Louis}} Post-Dispatch'', [[Judicial Watch]] and others.&lt;ref name=DevinJames.Karr/&gt;&lt;ref name=STLToday.Mislead/&gt;&lt;ref name=KPLR.Timeline/&gt;

The Department of Justice had urged the video not be released, saying a release would inflame tension.&lt;ref name=NBC.Feds/&gt; Missouri Governor [[Jay Nixon]] identified the release as an attempt to disparage Brown during the investigation that would inflame the community.&lt;ref name=Guardian.Points/&gt;&lt;ref name=IJR.Nixon/&gt; Brown's family released a statement in which they condemn the way the police chief chose to disseminate information, calling it [[character assassination]] following the "[[execution-style murder]]" of their son.&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Emotions/&gt;

The {{nowrap|August 15}} release of information was criticized as part of an erratic and infrequent release of information by the police.&lt;ref name=Fox.Cedes/&gt; Previously, the police withheld the name of the officer involved in the shooting, citing safety concerns following death threats against the unnamed officer.&lt;ref name=NPR.Name/&gt;  The {{nowrap|St Louis}} County Police incident report lacked details.&lt;ref name=Time.Report/&gt; The Ferguson Police incident report was obtained by the ACLU after a request and subsequent lawsuit.&lt;ref name=ACLU.Report/&gt; Wilson did not file an incident report&lt;ref name=Time.Report /&gt; and there was no Ferguson Police use-of-force report related to the incident.&lt;ref name=Yahoo.Report/&gt; The Ferguson Police Department refused to commit to a deadline for releasing a full autopsy report.&lt;ref name=Time.Roots/&gt;

When the report and video were released, the police said Wilson had known Brown was a suspect in the robbery.&lt;ref name=NYDailyNews.Bombshell/&gt; In a media conference, Ferguson's chief of police [[Thomas Jackson (police officer)|Tom Jackson]] said the robbery was unrelated to the initial contact, and had nothing to do with Wilson stopping Brown and Johnson.&lt;ref name=NPR.Name/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYDailyNews.Bombshell/&gt; Jackson later clarified Wilson recognized Brown as a suspect because he saw a box of cigars in his hand.&lt;ref name=USAToday.Cigars/&gt;&lt;ref name=STLToday.Jesse/&gt; Eugene O'Donnell, a former district attorney in New York City who now serves as a professor at the [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]], said, while the police officer may have stopped Brown for jaywalking, Brown may have been thinking the officer knew about the robbery: "Obviously the cop's reaction is not affected, but what could be affected is [Brown's] reaction to the cop."&lt;ref name=LATimes.Matters/&gt;

A Pew Research Center Survey published on August 18 suggested differences in American public opinion between whites and blacks. It indicated 80% of blacks and 37% of whites believed the shooting "raises important issues about race".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.people-press.org/2014/08/18/stark-racial-divisions-in-reactions-to-ferguson-police-shooting/|title=Stark Racial Divisions in Reactions to Ferguson Police Shooting|last=|first=|date=August 18, 2014|website=Pew Research Center|access-date=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On {{nowrap|August 24}}, St. Louis held their annual Peace Fest, which had a particular focus on Mike Brown. In attendance was Mike Brown's father, Mike Brown Sr., as well as the parents of Trayvon Martin (an unarmed black teen who was shot and killed in Florida in 2012).&lt;ref name=USAToday.Peace/&gt;

In August, Chief Jackson said Wilson had been injured in the incident.&lt;ref name=CNN.Threats/&gt;  Wilson's medical record shows his injuries were diagnosed as a facial contusion, a term used to describe a bruise.&lt;ref name=Atlantic.Injury/&gt;

Brown's funeral was held on {{nowrap|August 25}} and was attended by an estimated 4,500 people.&lt;ref name=KSDK.Church/&gt;&lt;ref name=WashPost.White/&gt; [[Al Sharpton]] delivered one of two eulogies.&lt;ref name=CNN.Hope/&gt;&lt;ref name=KCStar.Mourners/&gt;

On {{nowrap|October 22}}, anonymous sources leaked to the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch|{{nowrap|St. Louis}} Post-Dispatch]]'' what they described as Wilson's grand jury testimony,&lt;ref name=NYMag.Justice/&gt; following other leaks on Wilson's version of the events.&lt;ref name=DailyMail.Blow/&gt; The Justice Department issued a statement that it "considers the selective release of information in this investigation to be irresponsible and highly troubling. Since the release of the convenience-store footage, there seems to be an inappropriate effort to influence public opinion about this case."&lt;ref name=NYMag.Justice/&gt; Wilson's defense team denied they were behind the leaks, saying they "[were] not in possession of any of the disclosed reports or the investigative report".&lt;ref name=NYMag.Justice/&gt; The {{nowrap|St. Louis}} County prosecutor spokesperson said his office would not investigate the leaks because they could not force journalists to divulge their sources, and "you can tell by the information they have that the leaks are not coming from the grand jury or the prosecutor's office."&lt;ref name=DFP.Feds/&gt; The leaks concerning grand jury testimony were condemned by the Justice Department as inappropriate effort to influence public opinion about this case.&lt;ref name=NYMag.Justice/&gt; The leaks referred to evidence supporting Wilson's testimony and decreased the likelihood of an indictment whilst fanning the flames of angry protesters.&lt;ref name=Time.Leaks/&gt;

=== November 24–early December ===

[[File:Ferguson Day 6, Picture 44.png|thumb|Clashes between police and protesters]]

Following the grand jury announcement, protests, some of them violent, broke out in Ferguson and other cities across the United States. Several Ferguson businesses were looted and fires set by protesters. Protests erupted in 170 cities across the U.S., including&lt;ref name=Economist.Belong/&gt; [[St Louis]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Seattle]], [[Albuquerque]], [[New York City]], [[Cleveland]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Oakland]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Atlanta]], [[Chicago]], and [[Boston]].&lt;ref name=BBC.Protests/&gt; Numerous media reports and legal experts criticized the process for failing to return an indictment in cases concerning law enforcement officers.&lt;ref name=CSM.Rarely/&gt;&lt;ref name=538.Rare/&gt;

A December 2014 opinion poll by Washington Post-ABC News showed a majority of blacks do not believe that they receive treatment equal to whites by the police or the criminal justice system. Six out of ten white Americans believe the police treat races equally with roughly half of white Americans believing the criminal justice provides equal treatment, but there is a sharp partisan divide between white Americans. [[Conservatism in the United States|Conservative]] or [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] white Americans are far more likely to say whites and blacks receive equal treatment in the justice system than the [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] or [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] white Americans.&lt;ref name=WashPost.Partisan/&gt;{{refn|group=note|The poll was conducted {{nowrap|December 11–15}}, 2014, with a random national sample of 1,012 adults with an overall margin of error of 3.5 percentage points, but an error margin of 11 points for results among African Americans and Hispanics.&lt;ref name=WashPost.Partisan/&gt;}}

=== March 2015 ===
On {{nowrap|March 4}}, the U.S. Department of Justice announced Wilson would not be charged in the shooting.  Its report said "[t]here is no evidence upon which prosecutors can rely to disprove Wilson's stated subjective belief that he feared for his safety," and that accounts that Brown put his hands up are "inaccurate because they are inconsistent with the physical and forensic evidence".&lt;ref name=ABC.NotCharge/&gt;

President Obama reacted to the announcement, stating, "The finding that was made [by the Department of Justice] was that it was not unreasonable to determine that there was not sufficient evidence to charge Officer Wilson. That was an objective, thorough, independent federal investigation." He further added, "We may never know exactly what happened. But Officer Wilson like anybody else who is charged with a crime benefits from due process and a reasonable doubt standard."&lt;ref name=ABC.Obama/&gt;

=== International reactions ===
Various heads of state and foreign news organizations have commented on the shooting and subsequent protests including the Chinese [[Xinhua News Agency]], Germany's ''[[Der Spiegel]]'',&lt;ref name=LATimes.International/&gt; Egypt's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Egypt)|Ministry of Foreign affairs]],&lt;ref name=DNEgypt.Restraint/&gt; the Iranian [[Islamic Republic News Agency]],&lt;ref name=LATimes.International/&gt; protesters throughout the Middle East,&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Advice/&gt; the Russian Foreign Ministry,&lt;ref name=LATimes.International/&gt; Spain's ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'',&lt;ref name=WashPost.World/&gt; the British ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'',&lt;ref name=MetroUK.Dehumanise/&gt; and others.&lt;ref name=LATimes.International/&gt;

[[Amnesty International]] (AI) sent a team of human rights observers, trainers, and researchers to Ferguson. It was the first time the organization deployed such a team in the United States.&lt;ref name=LATimes.Backfire/&gt;&lt;ref name=BuzzFeed.Amnesty/&gt; In a press release, AI USA director [[Steven W.

The report cited the use of lethal force in Brown's death, racial discrimination and excessive use of police force, imposition of restrictions on the rights to protest, intimidation of protesters, the use of tear gas, [[rubber bullets]], and [[long range acoustic device]]s, restrictions imposed on the media covering the protests, and lack of accountability for law enforcement policing protests.&lt;ref name=Amnesty.Abuses/&gt;&lt;ref name=Time.Amnesty/&gt;

== Reactions to grand jury decision ==
[[File:NYC Mike Brown-Ferguson protest Union Square 11.JPG|thumb|Protesters react the day following the grand jury decision in [[Union Square, Manhattan]] in [[New York City]].]]
The grand jury process was atypical because of significant and numerous departures from other normal grand jury proceedings. The American grand jury process operates in secret, with the proceedings, evidence and testimony rarely being released to the public in cases of no indictment. From the beginning, McCulloch desired to provide transparency to the process and had the proceeding transcribed with the intention of releasing the materials to the public if there was no indictment. [[Paul G. Cassell|Paul Cassell]], former U.S. federal judge, said the investigative grand jury was unique because they were investigating with no assurance that any criminal conduct was present, in contrast to normal grand jury proceedings which have been screened for probable cause by a prosecutor. McCulloch's intentions to present all the evidence resulted in the proceedings which took far longer than regular grand juries which decide within days.&lt;ref name=WashPost.Fair/&gt;

Earlier in the hearing, the prosecution presented a 1979 Missouri statute allowing officers to use deadly force "to effect the arrest or prevent the escape from custody [of a person]". Before the grand jury deliberated, jurors were told to disregard the previous instructions and use case law from the [[Tennessee v Garner]] ruling, which said it was unconstitutional for police officers to use deadly force to apprehend non-dangerous fleeing suspects.&lt;ref name=KWMU.Wrangled/&gt; Missouri Attorney General [[Chris Koster]], acknowledged the grand jury was given information based on the state law before being informed that deadly force cannot be used merely to prevent the escape of an unarmed suspect.&lt;ref name=KWMU.Wrangled /&gt;&lt;ref name=RawStory.Misled/&gt; ''[[MSNBC]]'s'' [[Lawrence O'Donnell]] argued that this change amounted to a deliberate attempt by the prosecution to make it impossible to indict Wilson.&lt;ref name=Donnell.Last&gt;{{cite AV media | title=The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell – "Rewrite" segment | publisher=MSNBC | date=November 26, 2014 | medium=Television}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew F. Branca, a Massachusetts lawyer focusing on self-defense law, attributed O'Donnell's comments as a [[straw man]] because self-defense is a completely independent and sufficient justification for the use of deadly force.&lt;ref name=LegalInsurrection.Decision/&gt; The {{nowrap|St. Louis}} Public Radio later clarified that even if Wilson was indicted and convicted at trial based on the Garner ruling, the conviction could be challenged on the basis that Missouri law permitted the use of deadly force.&lt;ref name=KWMU.Wrangled /&gt;

The prosecution's handling of the case received particular attention. Roger Parloff said prosecutors do not usually exclude truly exculpatory evidence and that prosecutors do not typically indict if they believe the accused is not guilty, disagreeing with the notion that McCulloch should have presented evidence with the purpose of obtaining an indictment.&lt;ref name=Fortune.Deaths/&gt; Jay Sterling Silver said the grand jury case indicated a conflict of interest between local prosecutors and police, as the former needs to maintain a good relationship with law enforcement.&lt;ref name=TimesDispatch.Silver /&gt; [[Mark O'Mara]] said the unusual process was to avoid arguments that the presentation was to effect a particular result, yet despite this McCulloch was still criticized for the decision. Paul Callan, former deputy chief of homicide in the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office, gave a layered response which asserted the choice to present all the evidence was unusual, but not unprecedented in controversial cases. Callan said some prosecutors use the grand jury process as political cover in cases which would not succeed at trial, and in cases in which subsequent investigations and civil lawsuits would raise further criticism.&lt;ref name=CNN.Credibility/&gt; William Fitzpatrick, of the National District Attorneys Association, said it was not strange for prosecutors in police-involved cases to provide all available evidence and not ask for a specific charge and defended McCulloch's inclusion of evidence.&lt;ref name=LATimes.Strategy/&gt; [[Jeffrey Toobin]] agreed the exoneration may have been well-justified because a conviction would have been very unlikely at a trial, but the process that was used does not inspire confidence in the legal system.&lt;ref name=CNN.Credibility/&gt; In a later interview, McCulloch defended the choice to include all evidence and not skew the presentation just for the sake of getting an indictment.&lt;ref name=KTRS.McGraw/&gt;

''The New York Times'' described prosecutors' questioning of Wilson as "gentle" and said it contrasted with the sharp challenges to witnesses whose accounts seemed to contradict Wilson's, and reported this had led some to question whether the process was as objective as McCulloch had claimed. The ''Times'' reported prosecutors asked witness after witness if Brown appeared to be reaching for a weapon when confronting Wilson, though few of them said this. Furthermore, contradictions in testimony by Wilson and other law-enforcement officers were left unchallenged by prosecutors.&lt;ref name=NYTimes.Trusting/&gt; CNN legal analyst [[Sunny Hostin]] criticized the prosecutors for asking softball questions during the cross examination of Wilson's testimony, and referred particularly to the fact that no witness could corroborate Wilson's story that he had warned Brown twice to lay down on the ground, and when asked, witnesses said they did not hear him say that.&lt;ref name=RawStory.Fanciful/&gt;

After the grand jury's decision was announced, Brown's stepfather, Louis Head, turned to a crowd of demonstrators who had gathered, and yelled "Burn this bitch down", according to a ''New York Times'' video.&lt;ref name=CNN.Stepfather/&gt; Moments before, he had said "If I get up [on the platform] I'm gonna start a riot."&lt;ref name=AlJazeera.Stepdad/&gt; He later apologized for the outburst.&lt;ref name=CNN.Sorry/&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Michael Brown Plaque.jpg|thumb|Bronze plaque in memory of Michael Brown on sidewalk where shooting incident occurred]]
By September 24, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson publicly apologized to the family of Michael Brown.&lt;ref name=USAToday.Apology/&gt; By March 12, five months later, Thomas Jackson resigned from the Ferguson Police Department.&lt;ref name=NPR.ChiefResign/&gt; On {{nowrap|November 29}}, Wilson resigned from the Ferguson police force with no [[Severance package|severance]], citing security concerns.&lt;ref name=Reuters.Resigned/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN.Resigns/&gt; Wilson's lawyer said Wilson "will never be a police officer again" as he does not want to put other officers at risk due to his presence.&lt;ref name=NBC.Cop/&gt;  The [[National Bar Association]], an organization of African American lawyers and judges, made a complaint to the Missouri Department of Public Safety demanding Wilson's police officer license be revoked.&lt;ref name=STLToday.Revocation/&gt; Wilson's attempts to obtain employment as a police officer have been unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=NYer.Cop/&gt;

'''Subjective expected relative similarity (SERS)''' is a normative and descriptive theory that predicts and explains cooperation levels in a family of games termed ''Similarity Sensitive Games (SSG)'', among them the well-known [[Prisoner's Dilemma]] game (PD).&lt;ref name = "fischer2012" &gt;Fischer, I. (2012). Similarity or reciprocity? On the determinants of cooperation in similarity-sensitive games. Psychological Inquiry, 23(1), 48-54.&lt;/ref&gt; SERS was originally developed in order to (i) provide a new rational solution to the PD game and (ii) to predict human behavior in single-step PD games. It was further developed to account for: (i) repeated PD games, (ii) evolutionary perspectives and, as mentioned above, (iii) the SSG subgroup of 2x2 games.
SERS predicts that individuals cooperate whenever their subjectively perceived similarity with their opponent exceeds a situational index derived from the game’s payoffs, termed the similarity threshold of the game. SERS proposes a solution to the rational paradox associated with the single step PD and provides accurate behavioral predictions.The theory was developed by Prof. [[Ilan Fischer]] at the [[University of Haifa]].

== The Prisoner's Dilemma  ==
{{Main|Prisoner's Dilemma}}
{{in5|n}}The dilemma is described by a 2 x 2 payoff matrix that allows each player to choose between a cooperative and a competitive (or defective) move. If both players cooperate, each player obtains the reward (R) payoff. If both defect, each player obtains the punishment (P) payoff. 
However, if one player defects while the other cooperates, the defector obtains the temptation (T) payoff and the cooperator obtains the sucker’s (S) payoff, where &lt;br /&gt;
T &gt; R &gt; P &gt; S  (and, ''R'' ≥  {{sfrac|''T'''+'''S''|2}}  assuring that sharing the payoffs awarded for uncoordinated choices does not exceed the payoffs obtained by mutual cooperation).

Given the payoff structure of the game (see Table 1), each individual player has a [[dominant strategy]] of defection. This dominant strategy yields a better payoff regardless of the opponent’s choice. By choosing to defect, players protect themselves from exploitation and retain the option to exploit a trusting opponent. Because this is the case for both players, mutual defection is the only [[Nash equilibrium]] of the game. However, this is a deficient equilibrium (since mutual cooperation results in a better payoff for both players).&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;Fischer, I. (2009). Friend or foe: subjective expected relative similarity as a determinant of cooperation. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 138(3), 341.&lt;/ref&gt;

| T, S || P, P
|}
&lt;small&gt;''Table 1'':Payoffs are denoted as temptation (T), reward (R), punishment (P) and sucker (S)&lt;/small&gt;

===The Repeated Prisoner's Dilemma Game===
Players that knowingly interact for several games (where the end point of the game is unknown), thus playing a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game, may still be motivated to cooperate with their opponent while attempting to maximise their payoffs along the entire set of their repeated games. Such Players face a different challenge of choosing an efficient and lucrative strategy for the repeated play. This challenge may become more complex when individuals are embedded in an ecology, having to face many opponents with various and unknown strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod, R., &amp; Hamilton, W. D. (1981). The evolution of cooperation. Science, 211(4489), 1390-1396.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod, Robert (1984), The Evolution of Cooperation, Basic Books, {{ISBN|0-465-02122-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Nowak&gt;Nowak, M., &amp; Sigmund, K. (1993). A strategy of win-stay, lose-shift that outperforms tit-for-tat in the Prisoner's Dilemma game. Nature, 364(6432), 56-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The SERS Theory  ==

{{in5|n}}SERS assumes that the similarity between the players is subjectively and individually perceived (denoted as ''p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', where '' 0 ≤ p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 1''). Two players confronting each other may have either identical or different perceptions of their similarity to their opponent. In other words, similarity perceptions need neither be symmetric nor correspond to formal logic constraints.  After perceiving ''p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', each player chooses between cooperation and defection, attempting to maximize the expected outcome. This means that each player estimates his or her expected payoffs under each of two possible courses of action. The expected value of cooperation is given by&lt;br /&gt;
''R × p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; + S × (1-p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;)'' and the expected payoff of defection is given by ''P x p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; + T x (1 - p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;)''. Hence, cooperation provides a higher expected payoff whenever &lt;br /&gt;
''R x p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; + S x (1 - p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) &gt; P x p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; + T x (1 - p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;)'' which may also be expressed further as:&lt;br /&gt;
{{in5|n}} Cooperate if ''p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:125%;"&gt;{{sfrac|T-S|T-S+R-P}}&lt;/span&gt;''. Defining ''p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;*=&lt;span style="font-size:125%;"&gt;{{sfrac|T-S|T-S+R-P}}&lt;/span&gt;'', we obtain a simple decision rule: cooperate whenever ''p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;*'', where ''p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' denotes the level of perceived similarity with the opponent, and ''P&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;*'' denotes the similarity threshold derived from the payoff matrix.

[[File:SERS.png|framed|center|Fig. 1: The SERS Decision Tree for single step PD games. The expected value of cooperation is given by &lt;br/&gt; '' R × p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; + S × (1-p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;)'', the expected value for defection is given by ''P x p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; + T x (1 - p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'').  Thus cooperation should be preferred over defection whenever ''R x p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; + S x (1 - p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) &gt; P x p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; + T x (1 - p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;)'', or when ''p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;*'']]

To illustrate, consider a PD payoff matrix with T = 5, R = 3, P = 1, S = 0. The similarity threshold calculated for the game is given by:&lt;br /&gt;
'' p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;*= {{sfrac|5 - 0|5 - 0 + 3 - 1}} ≈ 0.71''. Thus a player perceiving the similarity with the opponent, ''p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', exceeding ''0.71'' should cooperate in order to maximise his expected payoffs.

===Empirical evidence===
Several experiments were conducted to test whether SERS provides not only a normative theory but also a descriptive theory of human behaviour.&lt;br /&gt;
For example, an experiment involving 215 university undergraduates revealed an average of 30% cooperation rate for a payoff matrix with  ''p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;* = 0.8'' and an average of 46% cooperation rate for a payoff matrix ''p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;* = 0.63''. 
Participants cooperated 47% under high level of induced similarity and only 29% under low level of induced similarity.
The cooperation rate for manipulating the perception of similarity of the opponent, revealed an increase from 67% to 80% of cooperation for the lower similarity threshold and from 40% to 70% cooperation for the higher similarity threshold. &lt;br /&gt;
Other experiments with various similarity induction methods and payoff matrices further confirmed SERS's status as a descriptive theory of human behaviour.&lt;ref name="fischer2012"/&gt;

===The SERS Theory for Repeated PD Games===
Experiments on the impact of SERS on repeated games  are presently being conducted and analysed at the University of Haifa and the [[Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods]] in Bonn.

===Similarity Sensitive Games===

The PD game is not the only similarity sensitive game. Games for which the choice of the action with the higher expected value depends on the value of ''p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' are defined as Similarity Sensitive Games (SSGs), whereas others are nonsimilarity sensitive. Focusing only on the 24 completely rank-ordered and symmetric games, we can mark 12 SSGs. After eliminating games that reflect permutations of other games generated either by switching rows, columns, or both rows and columns, we are left with six basic (completely rank-ordered and symmetric) SSGs.
These are games for which SERS provides a rational and payoff-maximizing strategy that recommends which alternative to choose for any given perception of similarity with the opponent&lt;ref name="fischer2012"/&gt;

Developing the SERS theory into an evolutionary strategy yields the ''Mimicry and Relative Similarity (MaRS)'' algorithm.
Fusing enacted and expected mimicry generates a powerful and cooperative mechanism that enhances fitness and reduces the risks associated with trust and cooperation. When conflicts take the form of repeated PD games, individuals get the opportunity to learn and monitor the extent of similarity with their opponents. They can then react by choosing whether to enact, expect, or exclude mimicry. This rather simple behavior has the capacity to protect individuals from exploitation and drive the evolution of cooperation within entire populations. MaRS paves the way for the induction of cooperation and supports the survival of other cooperative strategies. The existence of MaRS in heterogeneous populations helps those cooperative strategies that do not have the capacity of MaRS to combat hostile and random opponents. Despite the fact that MaRS cannot prevail in a duel with an unconditional defector, interacting within heterogeneous populations allows MaRS to fight unpredictable and hostile strategies and cooperate with cooperative ones, including itself. The operation of MaRS promotes cooperation, minimizes the extent of exploitation, and accounts for high fitness levels.
Testing the model in computer simulations of behavioral niches, populated with agents that enact various strategies and learning algorithms, shows how mimicry and relative similarity outperforms all the opponent strategies it was tested against, pushes noncooperative opponents toward extinction, and promotes the development of cooperative populations.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, I., Frid, A., Goerg, S. J., Levin, S. A., Rubenstein, D. I., &amp; Selten, R. (2013). Fusing enacted and expected mimicry generates a winning strategy that promotes the evolution of cooperation. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 110(25), 10229-10233.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mimicry and Relative Similarity Theory.png|frame|center|400x600px|''Fig. 2: The transition of MaRS among three mimicry modes: enacted, expected, and excluded. Each transition is conditioned upon the detection of up-to-date similarity levels by the passive similarity index p&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;, the reactive similarity index p&lt;sub&gt;sr&lt;/sub&gt;, or both. The criterion for sufficient similarity is the similarity threshold p&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;* defined by SERS]]''

The '''TV parental guidelines''' are a [[television content rating system]] in the United States that was first proposed on December 19, 1996, by the [[United States Congress]], the television industry and the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), and went into effect by January 1, 1997, on most major [[terrestrial television|broadcast]] and [[cable network]]s in response to public concerns&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cable agrees to monitor violence |first=Richard |last=Katz |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15142788.html |newspaper=[[Multichannel News]] |publisher=[[NewBay Media]] |date=January 17, 1994 |accessdate=March 11, 2013}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; about increasingly explicit sexual content, graphic violence and strong profanity in television programs. It was established as a voluntary-participation system, with ratings to be determined by the individually participating broadcast and cable networks.

The ratings are generally applied to most television series, television films and edited broadcast or basic cable versions of theatrically released films; [[pay television|premium channels]] also assign ratings from the TV parental guidelines on broadcasts of some films that have been released theatrically or on [[home video]], either if the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] did not assign a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|rating]] for the film or if the channel airs the unrated version of the film.

The ratings were designed to be used with the [[V-chip]], which was mandated to be built into all television sets manufactured since 2000, but the guidelines themselves have no legal force, and are not used on sports or news programs or during [[Television advertisement|commercial advertisements]]. Many online television services, such as [[Hulu]], [[Amazon Video]] and [[Netflix]] also use the guidelines system, along with digital video vendors such as the [[iTunes Store]] and [[Google Play]].

==Development of the guidelines==
In the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]], the [[United States Congress]] called upon the entertainment industry to establish, within one year, a voluntary television rating system to provide parents with advance information on material in television programming that might be unsuitable for their children. This rating system would work in conjunction with the [[V-chip]], a device embedded in television sets that enables parents to block programming they determine to be inappropriate.&lt;ref name="Industry Letter"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Jack Valenti]]|title=Letter to William F. Caton of the FCC from the television industry establishing a voluntary system of parental guidelines for rating television programming|date=January 17, 1997|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Cable/Public_Notices/1997/fc97034a.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=July 24, 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 29, 1996, all segments of the entertainment industry, led by the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] (NAB), the [[National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association]] (NCTA), and the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA), joined together and voluntarily pledged to create such a system. They agreed that the guidelines would be applied by broadcast and cable networks in order to handle the large amount of programming that must be reviewed – some 2,000 hours a day. The guidelines would be applied episodically to all programming based on their content, except for news, sports and advertising.&lt;ref name="Industry Letter" /&gt;

On December 19, 1996, the industry announced the creation of the TV Parental Guidelines, a voluntary system of guidelines providing parents with information to help them make more informed choices about the television programs their children watch. The guidelines were modeled after the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|movie ratings system]] created by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] in 1968. The television industry agreed to insert a ratings icon on-screen at the beginning of all rated programs, and to encode the guidelines for use with the V-chip.&lt;ref name="TV Ratings"&gt;{{cite news |title=TV Networks Ring in the Ratings to Start the New Year |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-156963998.html |work=[[Albany Times Union]] |date=January 2, 1997 |accessdate=July 24, 2013}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The industry also created a Monitoring Board, composed of TV industry experts, to ensure accuracy, uniformity and consistency of the guidelines and to consider any public questions about the guideline applied to a particular program.&lt;ref name="Industry Letter" /&gt; The TV Parental Guidelines went into use on January 1, 1997.&lt;ref name="TV Ratings"/&gt;

In response to calls to provide additional content information in the ratings system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Parents Do Not Find New Television Ratings System Helpful, Study Says |agency=Knight Ridder|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-53026532.html |department=Business News |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=September 25, 1998 |accessdate=July 24, 2013}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; on August 1, 1997, the television industry, in conjunction with representatives of children's and medical advocacy groups, announced revisions to the rating system. Under this revised system, television programming would continue to fall into one of the six ratings categories (TV-Y, TV-Y7, TV-G, TV-PG, TV-14 or TV-MA), but content descriptors would be added to the ratings where appropriate, based on the type(s) of objectionable content included in the individual program or episode: D (suggestive dialogue), L (coarse language), S (sexual content), V (violence) and FV (fantasy violence – a descriptor exclusively for use in the TV-Y7 category).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commission Seeks Comment on Revised Industry Proposal for Rating Video Programming (CS Docket No. 97-55)|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Cable/Public_Notices/1997/fcc97321.html|work=Public Notice|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|accessdate=July 24, 2013|date=September 9, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, the proposal stated that the icons and associated content symbols would appear for 15 seconds at the beginning of all rated programming, and that the size of the icons would be increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Revised Industry Proposal for Rating Video Programming|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/vchip/revprop.html|publisher=Publication from the television industry|accessdate=July 24, 2013|author=Jack Valenti et. al|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524072947/http://transition.fcc.gov/vchip/revprop.html|archivedate=May 24, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notice of proposed rulemaking on technical requirements to enable blocking of programs based on program ratings (FCC 97–340, ET Docket No. 97-206)|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Engineering_Technology/Notices/1997/fcc97340.pdf|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|accessdate=July 24, 2013|format=PDF|date=September 25, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revised guidelines were supported by leading family and child advocacy groups, as well as television broadcasters, cable systems and networks, and television production companies. Finally, the revised proposal called for five representatives of the advocacy community to be added to the TV Parental Guidelines Monitoring Board. On March 12, 1998, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] found that the Industry Video Programming Rating System was acceptable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Implementation of Section 551 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 Video Programming Ratings (FCC 98-35, CS Docket No. 97-55)|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Cable/Orders/1998/fcc98035.html|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|accessdate=July 24, 2013|date=March 13, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted technical requirements for the V-chip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technical Requirements to Enable Blocking of Video Programming based on Program Ratings (FCC 98-36, ET Docket No. 97-206)|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Engineering_Technology/Orders/1998/fcc98036.html|publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]]|accessdate=July 24, 2013|date=March 13, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ratings==
&lt;!-- Please do not add program examples without a reliable source to back up your claim. Thank you. --&gt;

===TV-Y===
[[File:TV-Y icon.svg|50px|right]]
''This program is designed to be appropriate for all children.''&lt;ref name="fcc.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://transition.fcc.gov/vchip/ |title=V-chip: Viewing Television Responsibly |website=FCC V-chip |publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]] |year=2000 |accessdate=July 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Programs rated TV-Y are designed to be appropriate for children of all ages. The thematic elements portrayed in programs with this rating are specifically designed for a very young audience, including children from ages 2–6.

===TV-Y7===
[[File:TV-Y7 icon.svg|50px|right]]
''This program is designed for children age 7 and above.''&lt;ref name="fcc.gov" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Programs rated TV-Y7 are designed for children age 7 and older. The FCC states that it "may be more appropriate for children who have acquired the developmental skills needed to distinguish between make-believe and reality."&lt;ref name="fcc.gov" /&gt;
Programs given the "FV" content descriptor exhibit more 'fantasy violence',&lt;ref name="fcc.gov" /&gt; and are generally more intense or combative than other programs rated TV-Y7.

===TV-G===
[[File:TV-G icon.svg|50px|right]]
''Programs suitable for all ages.''&lt;ref name="fcc.gov" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Programs rated TV-G are generally suited for all audiences, though they may not necessarily contain content of interest to children. The FCC states that "this rating does not signify a program designed specifically for children 10 years of age and older, (and) most parents may let younger children watch this program unattended."&lt;ref name=TVGL/&gt; The thematic elements portrayed in programs with this rating contain little or no violence, mild language, and no sexual dialogue or situations.&lt;ref name="TVGL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguidelines.org/ratings.htm |title=Understanding the TV Ratings |date=January 22, 2010 |website=The TV Parental Guidelines |publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]] |accessdate=July 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TV-PG===
[[File:TV-PG icon.svg|50px|right]]
''This program contains material that parents may find unsuitable for younger children.''&lt;ref name="fcc.gov" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Programs rated TV-PG contain material that parents or guardians may find [[age-appropriateness|inappropriate for younger children]]. Programs assigned a TV-PG rating may include some inappropriate language, very little sexual content or suggestive dialogue and/or violence.

===TV-14===
[[File:TV-14 icon.svg|50px|right]]
''This program contains some material that many parents would find unsuitable for children under 14 years of age.''&lt;ref name="fcc.gov" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Programs rated TV-14 may contain some material that parents or adult guardians may find unsuitable for children under the age of 14. The FCC warns that "Parents are cautioned to exercise some care in monitoring this program and are cautioned against letting children under the age of 14 watch unattended."&lt;ref name="fcc.gov"/&gt; Programs with this rating contain crude humor, drug/alcohol use, moderate language, strong violence (may include some amounts of blood and gore), intense sexual content and moderate suggestive themes or dialogue.

===TV-MA===
[[File:TV-MA icon.svg|50px|right]]
''This program is specifically designed to be viewed by adults, and therefore may be unsuitable for children under 17.''&lt;ref name="fcc.gov" /&gt;&lt;br&gt; Some content may be unsuitable for children. This rating was originally '''TV-M''' prior to the announced revisions to the rating system in August 1997, but was changed due to a trademark dispute and in order to remove confusion with the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]]'s (ESRB) "M for Mature" rating for [[video games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Aversa |first=Jeannine |title=Trademark Problem: TV-M To Become TV-MA |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19970313&amp;slug=2528555 |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=March 13, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rating is very seldom used by broadcast networks or local television stations due to FCC restrictions on program content, although it is commonly applied to television programs featured on certain [[cable channel]]s (basic and premium networks) and streaming networks for both mainstream and [[softcore pornography|softcore]] programs. Broadcast programming which has carried a TV-MA warning includes the pilot of the short-lived [[CBS]] police series ''[[Brooklyn South]]'' and documentaries such as [[Ken Burns]]' [[The Vietnam War (TV series)|''The Vietnam War'']] on [[PBS]], along with a few 10 p.m. ET drama series episodes with sensitive content. Programs with this rating commonly include dark humor, frequent use of profanity, intense violence (may include blood and gore) or strong sexual themes.

===Content descriptors===
Some thematic elements, according to the FCC, "may call for parental guidance and/or the program may contain one or more of the following" sub-ratings, designated with an alphabetic letter:
*'''D''' – [[Innuendo|Suggestive dialogue]] (once rarely used with the TV-MA rating, now discontinued)
*'''L''' – [[Profanity|Coarse or crude language]]
*'''S''' – [[Human sexuality|Sexual situations]]
*'''V''' – [[Research on the effects of violence in mass media|Violence]]
*'''FV''' – [[Fantasy violence]] (exclusive to the TV-Y7 rating)

Up to four content descriptors can be applied alongside an assigned rating, depending on the kind of suggestive content featured in a program. The FV descriptor is an exception due to its sole use for the TV-Y7 rating, which can have no descriptor other than FV. As the rating increases pertaining to the age, the content matters generally get more intensive. These descriptors allow for 44 possible combinations for all the ratings total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxkansas.com/entertainment/features/ratings|title=TV Ratings|last=|first=|date=June 10, 2013|website=|publisher=[[KSAS-TV]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721122653/http://www.foxkansas.com/entertainment/features/ratings|archive-date=July 21, 2013|dead-url=bot: unknown|accessdate=July 24, 2013|quote=In all there are 44 combinations of symbols for the TV Parental Guideline system.|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'suggestive dialogue' descriptor is used for TV-PG and TV-14 rated programs only. The violence descriptor was used for TV-Y7 programs until the creation of the 'FV' descriptor in 1997.&lt;ref name="Mifflin 1997"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19970625&amp;id=ur4wAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=v_wDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4720,3158097 | title=Impasse Snags Proposed TV Rating System | work=[[The Ledger]] | date=June 25, 1997 | accessdate=February 13, 2014 | author=Mifflin, Lawrie | pages=A1, A4 | edition=Lakeland | location=Lakeland, Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
For the first 15 seconds of every rated program lasting a half-hour or less, a large rating icon appears in the upper-left hand corner of the screen; previously this had a compulsory design but currently goes with a network's branding scheme, and may not necessarily utilize the skeleton of the icon, merely going with text. The icon was much smaller until June 2005 and only appeared on-screen for 7.5 seconds. For every rated program running an hour or longer, a rating appears in the upper-left hand corner of the television screen at the beginning of each half-hour. Starting in June 2005, many networks now display the ratings after every commercial break, in addition to the beginning of the program. Ratings icons formerly appeared in the [[4:3]] [[safe area (television)|safe area]], even with a [[16:9]] [[high-definition television|HD-designed]] presentation, but have moved into the top-left corner of the 16:9 picture as time has gone on.

==Viewer discretion advisories==
Some programs may voluntarily display a disclaimer regarding the show's objectionable content with the TV rating prior to the program starting, along with audibly repeating the same, with the reason for the rating (e.g. suggestive dialogue, drug and alcohol abuse, language, sexual situations, violence, nudity) and strongly cautioning parents to decide whether the program is suitable for their children. Several channels (including [[USA Network]] and [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]) insert special caution boards for strong language mid-show at the end of commercial breaks, almost always occurring before a series uses the word "[[fuck]]" in dialogue uncensored.

Viewer discretion advisories are mostly used for programs rated TV-MA where content may be unusual for the tone the series or event may usually have or for strong content. They are also commonly used for television broadcasts of theatrical films, albeit depending on the content and rating, though said content might also be edited out.

'''TeenNick''' was an evening block of [[Nickelodeon (UK and Ireland)|Nickelodeon UK]] from 20 July 2009 until August 2010. It was hosted by Olly Murray and Nathan A. Thomas. Olly Murray launched TeenNick solely and various Nickelodeon stars (for example [[Miranda Cosgrove]]) occasional  took co-host spaces. '''TeenNick''' varied programmes (see below) for teenagers and below and has often had interviews, singers and chats with the hosts. However, the programming is retained in the block with the Nickname. The block ended suddenly in August 2010 without notice. According to Nickelodeon on their official Twitter page, there is no plans at the moment to bring back TeenNick.

==Logo==
Like [[Nicktoons (UK and Ireland)|Nicktoons]], the logo is not the same colour as the logo used in the United States - the word 'Teen' is white and the 'Nick' is orange.

==Big Thursday==
Big Thursday was a programming block in March 2010 on Thursdays that aired new episodes of ''[[iCarly]]'', ''[[True Jackson, VP]]'', ''[[The Troop]]'' and ''[[Big Time Rush]]'' in the future. It also aired the [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards]] on April 1. It aired from 4:55pm to 6:30pm. Nickelodeon recently moved new episodes to Fridays. Now Nickelodeon shows new episodes on either Monday, Wednesday, Friday or Saturday. Never Tuesday or Thursday unless it's a premiere week.

'''''The Frisky''''' was a women’s entertainment and lifestyle website, first launched in 2008.  In 2011, [[Buzzmedia]] (now [[SpinMedia]]) acquired ''The Frisky'' from their previous publisher [[Turner Broadcasting Systems]].&lt;ref name=R&gt;{{cite news|title=BUZZMEDIA Acquires Top Women`s Entertainment &amp; Lifestyle Website The Frisky from Turner Broadcasting|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/11/idUS148274+11-Feb-2011+BW20110211|accessdate=4 September 2015|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2010, ''The Frisky'' had more than 2 million average monthly readers (as measured by [[comScore]]) making it one of the leading woman’s interest sites in the United States.&lt;ref name=R/&gt; ''The Frisky'' was described as newer women's media, as compared to traditional women’s magazines such as ''[[Redbook]]'', ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'', ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'', and the ''[[Ladies Home Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Reynolds, Glenn|authorlink=Glenn Reynolds|title=Where big GOP bucks could matter|url=https://nypost.com/2012/12/13/where-big-gop-bucks-could-matter/|accessdate=4 September 2015|work=[[New York Post]]|date=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, ''The Frisky'' cancelled adult film star [[James Deen]]'s sex advice column and removed ads and links to Deen's official website after Deen was accused of multiple counts of rape and sexual assault.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Porn industry groups cut ties to star James Deen amid sexual assault claims|date=November 30, 2015|author=Carroll, Rory|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/30/james-deen-sexual-assault-accusations-stoya-porn-industry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, SpinMedia closed. 

[[Celebuzz]], The Frisky, and [[The Superficial]] were sold to [[CPX Interactive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = More SpinMedia sites sold (RIP SpinMedia)| work = BrooklynVegan| accessdate = 2017-01-02| url = http://www.brooklynvegan.com/more-spinmedia-sites-sold-rip-spinmedia/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Frisky was redirects to [[Celebuzz]].

In 2018, The Frisky has a new owner.

'''Tiatr''' is a type of [[musical theatre]] popular in the state of [[Goa]] on the west coast of [[India]] as well as in [[Mumbai]] and with expatriate communities in the [[Middle East]], London and other cities where Konkani speakers have a considerable presence. The [[drama]]s are performed mainly in the [[Romi Konkani|Roman Konkani]] dialects and include music, dancing and singing. Tiatr performers are called ''tiatrists''.

==Etymology==
[[File:On the tiatr stage, Goa.JPG|thumb|Tiatr is a popular form of Konkani theatre. Seen here is Tomazinho Cardozo.]]
The word ''tiatr'' comes from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word for [[theatre]], ''teatro''. Earlier  variations were Theatro, Thiatro and Tiatro.&lt;ref name=AndreFernandes&gt;{{cite book|last=Fernandes|first=André Rafael|title=When the curtains rise...

==Description==
Tiatr today revolves around social, religious and political themes. It is considered to be a mirror of Goan culture. The drama consists of 6 or 7 acts called ''pordhe'' . The acts are interspersed by songs which need not be directly linked to the content or the issues of the main drama. There are 2 or 3 songs between each of the acts.

Tiatrist have always demonstrated a very high degree of social awareness. Most of the themes of tiatr are concerned with social problems confronting the people.

The Tiatr is an instance where mass support plays a crucial role. It is one of those arts which despite centuries of Portuguese suppression and post-liberation neglect from the state governments, has not just survived but also thrived and reinvented itself in many ways.

[[File:Scene from a tiatr (a popular form of Konkani theatre) in Goa.JPG|thumb|Photo shows an actor.]]The tiatr as a dramatic form has been traditionally dominated and patronised by Christian community, but over the years several young Hindu artists have been performing in the tiatr, which are also seen by people from the Hindu community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://goachronicle.com/home/tiatrs/7-tiatr-the-unique-theatre-from-goa# |title=Archived copy |access-date=22 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326001948/http://goachronicle.com/home/tiatrs/7-tiatr-the-unique-theatre-from-goa# |archive-date=26 March 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lone Muslim so far has  been mimicry artist Sheikh Amir.&lt;ref name=AndreFernandes /&gt;

==Songs==
Songs integral to the plays are known as 'Kants'.&lt;ref name=AndreFernandes /&gt; Other songs, called ''kantaram'' are generally either comedic or based on topical, political and controversial issues that are interspersed through the performance. These musical interludes are independent of the main theme of the play. The songs are often satirical and unsparing of the politics and politicians of Goa. The music is provided by a live band including [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]], [[trumpet]], [[saxophone]], [[bass guitar]] and [[drums]].

==Tiatr today==
Besides the regular commercial shows, tiatrs are held as part of the celebrations of nearly every church and chapel feast in the State.

The Goa Kala Academy organises a state level Tiatr competition every year while the Tiatr Academy organises a Popular Tiatr competition for dramas which have exceeded 25 performances .

Tiatr songs and performances are recorded and sold on [[CD]] and [[DVD]] in [[Goan]] and Middle Eastern markets.

Although efforts have been made to preserve the art form as a tradition of Goa, there have been calls for greater recognition of [[Mumbai]] based tiatrists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-06-02/goa/28156598_1_tiatr-academy-tomazinho-cardozo-tiatrists 'Mumbai-based tiatrists ignored'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102064712/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-06-02/goa/28156598_1_tiatr-academy-tomazinho-cardozo-tiatrists# |date=2 November 2012 }}

==Khell tiatr==
There is another version of the Tiatr called the ''Khell Tiatr'', whose performance is restricted to the festivals of Carnival, Intruz and Easter. It differs from the Konkani Tiatr in another respect, that is that its songs are integrated with the main drama and do not deviate in content from it.

==History==
Prior to the emergence of tiatr, entertainment in Konkani was mainly through ''zagors'' and ''khells''. Both of them had their distinct style. While the ''zagor'' was more lyrical, the ''khell'' had dialogues and while the former was more popular in [[Bardez]], the latter was firmly entrenched in [[Salcete]].

Costancio Lucasinho Caridade Ribeiro, more popularly known as Lucasinho Ribeiro, who was from [[Assagao]] was seeking employment in [[Bombay]]. Passionate about the performing arts, he was highly impressed with the stylised Italian [[opera]]s performed there. He took up a job for an [[Italian opera]] troupe which was touring Indian cities at the time, staging an opera called 'Italian Boy'. When the troupe left India, Lucazinho Ribeiro bought the costumes used in the play with the intention of staging a Konkani play on the style of the Italian Opera. His collaborators in the effort were Caetaninho Fernandes of [[Taleigao]] and João Agostinho Fernandes of Borda, [[Margao]].

On [[Easter]] Sunday, 17 April 1892 the first tiatr performance ever, ''Italian Bhurgo'', adapted from the Italian play, was staged at the New Alfred Theatre, Bombay.&lt;ref name="Ntpratap"/&gt; This day is celebrated as ''Tiatr Dis'' (Tiatr Day). Hence, the Goan art form of tiatr was the product of the meeting of Goan culture and the opera of Italy, which, incidentally is the birthplace of the opera, and the tiatr was born in Bombay. Since there were many different scenes in this tiatr and as it required different stage sets, they thought of dropping the curtain and introducing songs and dances in front of the curtain. This was needed to entertain the audience while the Stage Setting was being done behind the curtain. These songs and dances did not have any relevance to the theme of the play.

The first original tiatr script was written and directed by João Agostinho Fernandes, entitled ''Belle de Cavel'' or ''Sundori Cavelchi'' in 1895 in Bombay and for all his consistent devotion and encouragement over fifty years, he was conferred the title ''Pai Tiatrist'' (Father Tiatrist).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Fernandes, André Rafael|year=2010|title=When the curtains rise... Understanding Goa’s vibrant Konkani theatre|publisher=Goa 1556, with the Tiatr Academy of Goa|location=Goa|page=''xiv''|isbn=978-93-80739-01-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mrs. Regina Fernandes, wife of the playwright João Agostinho Fernandes, became the first female tiatr actor in "Bhattkara" on 22 November 1904. ''Divorce'', a tiatr written and directed by Airistides Dias was the first konkani tiatr to complete 100 performances on 5 October 1980.

However, as time passed the standard of Zagor as well as Khell deteriorated in quality with the introduction of elements of vulgarity. Educated people stopped patronizing the Zagor as well as the Khell. While tiatr was making its presence felt, its original form – the zagors and the khells - were dying a slow death and the zagor finally stopped being performed while the khells continued.

But in 1956 the khell underwent a dramatic change. Given its state at that time, Antonio Moraes thought it fit to take the khell from the street performance to a stage performance. Helped by his friend and colleague Antonio Marian, the khell was performed on a stage for the first time with a backdrop and other paraphernalia associated with theatre.  The first Khell Tiatr 'Sandlolo Put' written and directed by Antonio Moraes was staged on the third day of Carnival of March 1956. However, this form became very popular only in the 1970s when Rosario Rodrigues coined the term khell tiatr and came up with extremely successful shows. Thus, the ground-based plays known as Khells evolved onto the stage and further into 'Non-stop dramas' but have now generally dropped this label and are generally referred to as Tiatrs.

Tiatr contributed to keeping the Konkani language alive during Portuguese colonial rule, when Konkani was suppressed. Tiatrists played a major role in the struggle to make Konkani the officials language of Goa.

In 2007, the [[Government of Goa]] started the Tiatr Academy of Goa [ TAG ] to facilitate the development of  ''Tiatr''. In 2008 legislation was approved granting 15 lakh  [[rupee]]s to the newly formed [[Tiatr Academy of Goa]].&lt;ref name="Ntpratap"&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Seth Riggs at the "Margareta Svensson and Seth Riggs Summer Vocal Workshop" in Varberg, Sweden July 26, 2013.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Vocal coach [[Seth Riggs]] at a 2013 vocal workshop]]
A '''vocal coach''', also known as a '''voice coach''' (though this term often applies to those working with speech and communication rather than singing), is a [[music teacher]], usually a piano accompanist, who helps [[singer]]s prepare for a performance, often also helping them to improve their [[singing]] technique and take care of and develop their voice, but is not the same as a [[voice teacher|singing teacher]] (also called a "voice teacher"). Vocal coaches may give private music lessons or group workshops or [[masterclass]]es to singers. They may also coach singers who are rehearsing on stage, or who are singing during a recording session. Vocal coaches are used in both [[Classical music]] and in [[popular music]] styles such as [[rock (music)|rock]] and [[gospel music|gospel]]. While some vocal coaches provide a range of instruction on singing techniques, others specialize in areas such as breathing techniques or diction and pronunciation.

==Roles==

===Other roles===
A vocal coach is sometimes responsible for writing and producing vocal arrangements for [[four-part harmony]] for backup vocalists or helping to develop [[countermelody|counter melodies]] for a secondary vocalist. Some vocal coaches may also advise singers or bands on lyric-writing for a music production. Some critics allege that in some cases where popular music recordings credit a singer for work as a vocal coach during a recording, this may be a subtle way of acknowledging a [[ghostwriting]] role, in which the coach writes lyrics for a singer-songwriter or rapper.

In the 2000s, the increasing use of recording software which contains vocal processing algorithms and digital pitch correction devices is replacing some of the roles of the vocal coach. In the 1970s, if a producer wanted to record a single with a popular sports star with few vocal skills, the celebrity would need weeks of vocal coaching to learn their song and improve their tone and diction. In the 2000s, the vocals are often processed through pitch correction software instead, and rhythm can be corrected with Pro Tools. This enables 2000s-era producers and audio engineers to in order to make an untrained performer's singing sound closer to that of a trained vocalist.

==Training and experience==
The training and education of vocal coaches vary widely. Many vocal coaches are former or current professional [[singer]]s. Some vocal coaches have extensive formal training, such as a Bachelor of Music, a Master of Music, a Conservatory diploma, or degrees in related areas such as foreign languages or diplomas in human kinetics, posture techniques, or breathing methods. On the other hand, some vocal coaches may have little formal training, and so they rely on their extensive experience as a performer. For example, a native German language speaker who moves to the US may begin providing German diction coaching to amateur vocal students, and over several decades, this vocal coach may develop a broad range of on-the-job experience in coaching German-language singing styles such as [[lieder]] and [[Wagnerian opera]].

Vocal coaches may also come to their profession through other routes, such as related musical professions or from other fields. Some vocal coaches, for example, are rehearsal pianists with decades of experience accompanying singers, or former or current choral, music theater, or symphony conductors. More rarely, vocal coaches may come to the profession from a non-musical route. For example, a specialist in [[Alexander Technique]], [[yoga]], or medical aspects of the throat and vocal cords may begin to specialize in coaching and training singers.

The vocal coaching field is competitive, especially at the highest professional levels. Salaries vary greatly, as do the conditions of work. While a small number of top vocal coaches can command very high hourly or daily rates, most vocal coaches, like most other music and arts professionals, tend to have salaries which are below the average for other professions which require a similar amount of education and experience, such as economists or bank managers. The work conditions vary widely, from part-time or occasional freelance work for individual singers, opera companies, or record companies, to full-time contracts or multi-year jobs for universities (coaching vocal performance students and students in opera courses) or music theater companies.

==Methods of instruction==
While vocal coaches use many different techniques to teach singing, they will usually instruct students in one or more of the following methods:

* Private singing lessons (usually in 30-minute, 45-minute or 60-minute increments)
* Group lessons (this is two or more students working with the vocal coach; for example, a [[barbershop quartet]] might get coaching as a group)
* Recording studio coaching that takes place in a [[recording studio]] with a [[microphone]] and [[multitrack recording]] equipment, which is operated by an [[audio engineer]]. Singing for recordings requires different singing techniques than singing at live shows. To give one example, when a singer is performing at a small [[coffeehouse]] gig without a microphone, she does not need to worry about "plosive" consonants (such as the letter "p"); however, when singing in front of a microphone, words with the letter "p" can be overemphasized by the microphone, due to the nature of the way we produce these sounds.
* Workshops (by definition a workshop involves a number of students and the vocal coach; as well, there may be an audience watching the workshop process)
* Digitally or through online singing lessons (e.g., via [[Skype]] or [[Facetime]]) in which audio or video is transmitted of the instructor singing and the student imitates the instructor. The instructor can also hear the student sing and provide coaching on her or his singing. In most cases, there is a small delay in the audio transmitted during digital voice lessons so the instructor is not able to actively accompany the student. Instead, the voice teacher plays a tone or chord and demonstrates the scale or exercises which he wishes for the student to sing. The student then imitates the instructor. The instructor can then modulate the scale upwards while the student follows singing the same scale pattern.
* [[Accompaniment]] by a pianist is often part of vocal coaching. The vocal coach may double as a vocal coach and as an accompanist. In other cases, the vocal coach may hire an accompanist to play during the coaching sessions. The piano is one of the most common instruments used for accompaniment, as it can be used to play [[bassline]]s, [[chord (music)|chords]] and [[melody|melodies]] at the same time. Other instruments may also be used (e.g., guitar, Hammond organ, etc.) but are less common.

==Nomenclature: vocal coach vs. voice teacher==
Within the community of voice teachers, there has been some debate about the terms "vocal coach" and "[[voice teacher]]".

While many believe the terms are synonymous, some professionals in the music community hold that the terms have slightly different meanings.

The terms "voice teacher" and "singing teacher" are most often used to refer to a teacher that has been educated and instructs [[vocal pedagogy]], while a vocal coach may not possess the same education level.

In universities, for example, it would be rare to have a professor of voice refer to themselves as a vocal coach, even though they may teach private lessons.

Additionally, the term "voice teacher" or "singing teacher" normally refers to an instructor whose main role is developing the singing voice. The term "vocal coach", on the other hand, may be appropriated by someone who works on stage performance, vocal style or a host of other subjects that are related to voice, but not necessarily teach singing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.octavehighereast.com/singing-coach/|title=Singing Coach vs Voice Teacher: What's the Difference?|date=2017-07-30|work=Octave Higher East|access-date=2017-07-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yuri Borisovich Levitan'''  ({{lang-ru|Юрий Борисович Левитан}}, 2 October 1914 – 4 August 1983) was the primary Soviet radio announcer during and after [[World War II]]. He announced on [[Radio Moscow]] all major international events in the 1940s–60s including the [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack on the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941]], the [[Victory Day (9 May)|surrender of Germany on 9 May 1945]], the [[Death and state funeral of Joseph Stalin|death of Joseph Stalin on 5 March 1953]], and the [[Vostok 1|first manned spaceflight on 12 April 1961]].&lt;ref name="RBTH"&gt;{{cite web| last = Belenitskaya | first = Olga | title = Moscow is speaking: The voice that brought hope to a nation | website = Russia Behind the Headlines | date = 16 April 2015 | url = http://rbth.co.uk/arts/2015/04/16/moscow_is_speaking_the_voice_that_brought_hope_to_a_nation_45303.html | accessdate = 6 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Levitan was born to a Jewish family in Vladimir to a [[tailor]] and a housewife. In the early 1930s he traveled to Moscow hoping to become an actor, but was rejected because of his provincial manners. However, he secured a position on a Moscow radio station owing to his characteristic deep voice. In January 1934, after hearing his broadcast, [[Joseph Stalin]] called up the radio station and requested that from then on Levitan read his announcements. Consequently, Levitan became not only the personal announcer for Stalin, but the leading Soviet radio personality.&lt;ref name="RBTH"/&gt;

After the German invasion in 1941 Levitan was evacuated to  [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]], because Moscow radio stations were taken down to avoid German bombardment. At the time, he lived in a secret location due to his importance as the nation's foremost radio personality. In March 1943, he was secretly transported to [[Samara|Kuybyshev]], where the Soviet radio committee met. During all those years away from Moscow, his reports began with his trademark "Attention, Moscow is speaking!" ({{lang-ru|Внимание, говорит Москва!}}) Levitan made some 2000 radio announcements during the war; he recorded recreations of many of them in the 1950s, when he reproduced them in studio for archiving purposes.&lt;ref name="RBTH" /&gt;

After the war, Levitan reported on events on [[Red Square]] and state proclamations. Between 1978 and 1983, he announced the annual "[[Minute of Silence]]" to commemorate the [[Victory Day (May 9)|Victory Day]] in Russia. In 1980, he was awarded the title of [[People's Artist of the USSR]]. He died from a [[heart attack]] in 1983, and was buried in the famed [[Novodevichy Cemetery]] in Moscow.&lt;ref name="RBTH" /&gt;
