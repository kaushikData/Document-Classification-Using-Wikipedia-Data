'''AMSOIL Arena''' is a multipurpose [[arena]] in [[Duluth]], [[Minnesota]], home to the [[UMD Bulldogs men's ice hockey|UMD Men's]] and [[UMD Bulldogs women's ice hockey|UMD Women's]] hockey teams. It opened in 2010, replacing the [[Duluth Entertainment Convention Center]] Arena on the waterfront near Duluth's landmark [[Aerial Lift Bridge]].

Naming rights for 20 years were purchased by [[AMSOIL]], a [[corporation]] based in [[Superior, Wisconsin]], for $6 million, one-third up front.&lt;ref name="DNT11may2010"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/content/6-million-its-amsoil-arena |title=For $6 million, it's Amsoil Arena |last=Kuchera |first=Steve |date=May 11, 2010 |newspaper=Duluth News Tribune |access-date=February 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hanson|first1=Howie|title=Naming rights for new Duluth arena; UMD names new chancellor|url=http://www.startribune.com/naming-rights-for-new-duluth-arena-umd-names-new-chancellor/93423339/|website=Star Tribune|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The facility cost nearly $80 million; about half ($38 million) paid by the State of Minnesota through a 2008 bond bill, another 27% (about $21.6 million) by a voter-approved city food-and-beverage tax increase, 12% (about $9.6 million) by [[University of Minnesota-Duluth|UMD]], and the last 11% (about $8.8 million) by the DECC. Construction ran from September 2008 to December 2010, and included a 475-space parking garage with a [[skywalk]] connecting it to the arena.&lt;ref&gt;url=http://umdbulldogs.com/sports/2013/8/30/Amsoil-Arena.aspx?path=general&lt;/ref&gt;

The first event held at the arena was on December 30, 2010. UMD men's hockey team lost 0-5 to North Dakota before a crowd of 6,764, tied for the team's highest home attendance that season.

In their first season in the arena, the UMD men's hockey team won the [[NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship]]. In 2012, the arena hosted the [[2012 NCAA Division I Women's Ice Hockey Tournament]], in which [[Minnesota Golden Gophers women's ice hockey|Minnesota]] beat [[Wisconsin Badgers women's ice hockey|Wisconsin]], 4-2.

The arena's attendance record was set on June 20, 2018 during a President [[Donald Trump]] rally, which drew 8,372 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Slater |first1=Brady |title=Trump playful in Duluth |url=https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/government-and-politics/4463195-trump-playful-duluth |accessdate=21 June 2018 |publisher=Duluth News Tribune |date=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attendance record for a sporting event was set on October 17, 2015, when UMD men's hockey team defeated their rival, [[Minnesota Golden Gophers men's hockey|Minnesota]], 3-0 in front 7,569 fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Record GPA, Record Attendance Among UMD's 2015-2016 Athletic Highlights|url=http://umdbulldogs.com/news/2016/6/30/general-record-gpa-record-attendance-among-umds-2015-16-athletic-highlights.aspx?mobile=skip|website=The Official Site of the University of Minnesota-Duluth|date=July 12, 2016|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aero Warriors''' is a nickname for four [[Muscle car|muscle cars]], also called '''aero-cars''', developed specifically to race on the [[NASCAR]] circuit by [[Dodge]], [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]], [[Ford]] and [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] for the 1969 and 1970 racing seasons. The cars were based on production stock cars but had additional aerodynamic features. 

The first Aero Warrior was the 1969 [[Ford Torino Talladega]]. The [[Ford Torino|Torino]] already had a [[fastback]] design; the Talladega added a longer, slightly rounded front end. The second Aero Warrior was the 1969 [[Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II]]. The Cyclone was nearly identical to the Torino with the only major distinctions being the front grille and rear taillights. Another aero car is the [[Dodge Charger Daytona]], which had a more radical aerodynamic nose as well as a high-mounted wing at the rear. The final Aero Warrior was the 1970 [[Plymouth Superbird]] (based on the [[Plymouth Road Runner]]), which had the same aerodynamic additions as the Daytona. Because of their wings, the [[Mopar]] Aero Warriors are sometimes called the '''Winged Warriors'''. 

Due to NASCAR [[Homologation (motorsport)|homologation]] rules a minimum number (500) of these cars had to be offered for sale to the public so there are approximately 3,000 of these cars in private ownership. The Aero Warriors were successful in winning many races, but NASCAR made rule changes that equalized the advantages in 1971. Plymouth made a Superbird prototype in 1971 but it did not go into production.

'''All Saint's United''' are an Antigua and Barbuda [[association football|football]] playing club in the [[Antigua and Barbuda 1st Division]]. The All Saints United Football Club was founded in 1996 where two teams of the community Westend Pressers and Attackers came together in unity to form the club. The team's motto is "When conviction runs deep courage rises to sustain it".

After the merger between the two home teams, the team played in the First Division League for several years. In 2005–2006 the team reigned supreme in the First Division League where they were promoted to the [[Antigua and Barbuda Premier Division]]. The team went into the league under the leadership of Alphanso Danials (former president) and retired coach Eliston Thomas. The team's highest league position was 2nd place in the 2010/11 season.

In the 2013/2014 season changes were made to the club: [[Danny Benjamin]] was sacked as manager, head coach [[Rowan Benjamin]] stepped down and took on the technical director role and former Attackers midfielder [[Tracey Allen]] became the head coach. They were later relegated to the first division. After 2 unsuccessful attempts to gain promotion All Saints United hired Schyan Jeffers at the start of the 2016/17 season.

The '''Bank of England club''' is a nickname in English [[association football]] for a football club which has a strong financial backing. It was used to refer to [[Arsenal F.C.]] in the 1930s as well as in recent times for being the last of the [[Premier League]]'s [[Big Four (English football)|Big Four]] clubs to be owned primarily by English investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/13040475 |title=BBC Sport - US businessman Stan Kroenke agrees bid to buy Arsenal |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2011-04-11 |accessdate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and usage==

===Arsenal===

[[File:Arsenal Stadium Highbury east facade.jpg|thumb|[[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury's]] Art Deco east facade]]

The name "Bank of England club" or "Bank of England team" caught after the [[World football transfer record|record-breaking spending]] of Arsenal in the 1920s and 1930s. [[Bernard Joy]] recalled that people "sneered at the 'Bank of England' methods of team building" after the five-digit figure paid for [[David Jack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Joy|first1=Bernard|title=Forward, Arsenal!|date=2009|publisher=GCR Books Limited|isbn=9780955921117|page=49|edition=illustrated, reprint|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zxavt42c3t0C|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenal continued to spend considerable sums on other players, including [[Alex James (footballer)|Alex James]], and, in 1938, broke the [[Progression of British football transfer fee record|English transfer record]] again with the purchase of [[Bryn Jones (footballer, born 1912)|Bryn Jones]].

Arsenal's new home in [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]] had provided them with considerable resources, such that, in 1935, they became the first club to earn over £100,000 from gate receipts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Terrace Heroes: The Life and Times of the 1930s Professional Footballer|author=Graham Kelly|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0714653594|year=2005|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accompanied by £2,500 earned from match day programme sales and financial reserves of over £60,000, the "Bank of England club" moniker became regularly used to describe Arsenal.&lt;ref name="sport" /&gt; It was also used to refer to the perceived grandeur of Arsenal's surroundings after the 1930s construction of Highbury's [[Art Deco]] stands and [[terrazzo]] "Marbled Halls".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/blighty/2011/04/takeover_arsenal |title=The takeover of Arsenal: The most English of football clubs goes American |work=The Economist |date=2011-04-12 |accessdate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This lasted until the [[Second World War]], when Arsenal's Highbury stadium was requisitioned as an [[Air Raid Precautions]] post and was bombed. The cost of repairing Highbury and gaining no income from being able to play home [[Wartime League]] matches eliminated most of Arsenal's cash reserves, which meant that the "Bank of England club" descriptor gradually became less used and redundant.&lt;ref name="sport"&gt;{{cite book|title=Terrace Heroes: The Life and Times of the 1930s Professional Footballer|author=Graham Kelly|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0714653594|year=2005|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, when [[Stan Kroenke]] became the majority shareholder of Arsenal, a number of media commentators observed that the "last domino fell" with the original "Bank of England club" becoming majority owned by foreign investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David |last=Bond |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/davidbond/2011/04/will_kroenkes_purchase_change.html |title=What does Kroenke's purchase mean for Arsenal? |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sunderland===
The "Bank of England club" has also been used to describe [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in the late 1940s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/columns/story/_/id/1021393/first-xi:-fa-cup-giant-killings?cc=5739# |title=First XI: FA Cup giant-killings |publisher=ESPN |date=2012-02-16 |accessdate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1950s, where they spent large amounts of money intending to win trophies. However, the move was not successful as Sunderland failed to win any trophies during the period and were relegated in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.shieldsgazette.com/sport/football/sunderland-afc/bank-of-england-club-should-be-warning-to-real-fergie-1-1245250 |title=Bank of England club should be warning to Real |publisher=Shields Gazette |date=2009-07-29 |accessdate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Everton===
[[Everton F.C.|Everton]] have also been labelled as the "Bank of England club" in 1970. This came from chairman [[John Moores (British businessman)|John Moores]] giving manager [[Harry Catterick]] large amounts of money to spend. This was successful as Everton won [[Football League First Division|the First Division]] title in 1970. However, a large exodus of players in the months afterwards meant that Everton were unable to continue as they had done in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-lancashire/plain/A882885 |title=Everton Football Club |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FIDE gave the qualifiers until January 11 to decide upon participation and sign the contract,&lt;ref name="candidates contract"&gt;[http://www.fide.com/component/content/article/1-fide-news/9266-2016-candidates-tournament-announcement-.html 2016 Candidates Tournament] Announcement and Contract (FIDE)&lt;/ref&gt; and all accepted even though [[Veselin Topalov]] was open in his dislike of Moscow as a location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsbg.ru/sport/105-sport/13568-bolgarskij-grossmejster-nedovolen-vyborom-moskvy-dlja-provedenija-turnira-pretendentov.html Bulgarian grandmaster unhappy with choice of Moscow for the Candidates Tournament] (Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chess-news.ru/en/node/20415 Danailov Says Choosing Moscow for the Candidates is "Outrageous"] (Chess-News Russia)&lt;/ref&gt; Topalov did not attend the opening ceremony,&lt;ref name="chesscom round3"&gt;[https://www.chess.com/news/second-loss-for-topalov-aronian-joins-leaders-at-candidates-tournament-2992 Second Loss For Topalov, Aronian Joins Leaders At Candidates' Tournament] (Chess.Com)&lt;/ref&gt; leaving himself open to a forfeiture of 5% of his prize money to each of FIDE and the organizers, by 3.11.2 of the Regulations.

The ratings and rankings in this table are taken from the March 2016 FIDE list. They are provided for information purposes only, and were not used for seeding. Notable highly ranked players who did not qualify include [[Vladimir Kramnik]], a former World Champion and the world number 2 as of March 2016, and [[Maxime Vachier-Lagrave]], the world number 5.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ratings.fide.com/toparc.phtml?cod=393 Top 100 Players March 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; The age column is in years as of 15 March 2016. FIDE uses a country-diversion system, so that Svidler and Karjakin, similarly Nakamura and Caruana, are paired together in rounds 1 and 8, to avoid conflicts in late rounds,&lt;ref name="fc_2016" /&gt; as seen in the pairings.&lt;ref name="pairings"&gt;[http://www.fide.com/component/content/article/1-fide-news/9421-candidates-tournament-2016-pairings.html Candidates Tournament Pairings (2016)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rounds 1–3===
The first round saw Anand beat Topalov after mutual blunders around move 20, then again around move 40, to get an early lead as all other games were drawn, two of them right at the (minimal) 30-move mark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldchess.com/2016/03/11/candidates-results-anand-wins-three-other-games-are-draws Anand wins, three other games are draws] (WorldChess)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldchess.com/2016/03/11/d%C3%A9j%C3%A0-vu-anand-takes-early-lead-at-candidates Deja Vu: Anand takes early lead] (WorldChess)&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly went Round 2, with two of the 3 draws occurring in 30 moves, while Nakamura missed a tactic against Karjakin and played a large unforced blunder on move 29 resulting in loss.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldchess.com/2016/03/12/karjakin-joins-anand-as-co-leader-of-candidates Karjakin joins Anand as co-leader] (WorldChess)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldchess.com/2016/03/12/flash-report-karjakin-wins-after-nakamura-blunders-other-games-drawn Karjakin wins after Nakamura blunders] (WorldChess)&lt;/ref&gt;

Round 3 saw both leaders draw, as Giri made two knight sacrifices before forcing an early draw by repetition against Karjakin, while Anand had a nagging edge against Caruana that eventually evaporated. Meanwhile, Aronian joined the leaders by beating a very off-form Topalov with Black, while Svidler as Black out-prepared Nakamura in a complicated Semi-Slav line to move 25, but failed to convert a pawn-up endgame in which [[Mark Dvoretsky]] questioned his lack of killer instinct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldchess.com/2016/03/13/flash-report-round-3-aronian-wins-to-join-leaders-other-games-drawn  Aronian wins to join leaders] (WorldChess)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldchess.com/2016/03/13/three-lead-candidates-after-three-rounds Three lead after three rounds] (WorldChess)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rounds 4–6===
After a rest day, two of the leaders faced each other in Round 4, with Karjakin as White choosing a passive opening and coming up with an early novelty against Anand, and then saddling him with [[hanging pawns]] (''see diagram''). He then switched to a pressing endgame against Black's pawn weaknesses, and soon after the time control an Anand miscue led to his immediate resignation. This was Karjakin's first career victory over Anand at classical time controls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldchess.com/2016/03/15/flash-report-round-4-karjakin-wins-and-is-sole-leader Karjakin Wins and is Sole Leader] (WorldChess)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldchess.com/2016/03/15/karjakin-takes-charge-of-candidates Karjakin takes charge] (WorldChess)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nakamura and Giri drew in just over an hour in 30 moves in a game that might have been completely pre-analyzed, while Svidler and Aronian drew a rook ending at the time control. The game between Caruana and Topalov saw a [[Giuoco Piano#Giuoco Pianissimo: 4.d3|Giuoco Pianissimo]] opening, before Topalov opened up the position and later blundered in time pressure, but Caruana spoiled a large advantage right after the time control by miscounting the pieces, and in the end a double rook endgame was drawn.

In Round 5, all the games were drawn, three of them at move 30 and the other at move 40.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldchess.com/2016/03/16/flash-report-all-games-are-drawn-in-round-5 All games drawn in Round 5] (WorldChess)&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the previous round, here when Karjakin himself had [[hanging pawns]] it did not matter (''see diagram'') and he drew comfortably.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldchess.com/2016/03/16/a-day-of-draws-leaves-karjakin-in-the-lead Day of draws leaves Karjakin in the lead ] (WorldChess)&lt;/ref&gt;

Round 6 had Svidler losing out of opening against Anand, while Karjakin held a materially imbalanced position to a draw against Caruana. The Topalov-Giri game saw a practical novelty already at move 3, with a resulting drawn knight endgame after the 60-move mark. In the game Aronian-Nakamura, Aronian nurtured an advantage for some time, but the endgame appeared to be drawn. But on move 74, Nakamura made a [[Touch-move rule|fingerfehler]] and touched his king, forcing him to make a losing move (''see diagram''). The incident was controversial as Nakamura initially tried to claim ''[[j'adoube]]'', the international term to convey that one intends to adjust the piece, not move it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puRR65UUKAs Touch Move in Aronian-Nakamura ] (YouTube, WorldChess)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Crowther, [http://theweekinchess.com/chessnews/events/fide-candidates-2016/nakamura-in-touch-move-drama-at-the-end-of-candidates-round-6 Nakamura in touch move drama at the end of Candidates Round 6], ''[[The Week in Chess]]'', 17 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; This win brought Aronian into the lead with Karjakin, with Anand just behind, going into the second rest day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldchess.com/2016/03/17/flash-report-rd.-6-anand-and-aronian-win-aronian-leads-with-karjakin Anand and Aronian win, Aronian leads with Karjakin] (WorldChess)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rounds 7–13===
{{section-stub|date=March 2018}}

===Round 14===
The tournament winner was decided in the final round game between Karjakin (playing white) and Caruana. Before this round, these were the only two players who could win the tournament, having 7.5 points each. For Caruana to win the tournament, he needed to win the game, or draw and rely on Anand to win with black against Svidler.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.chessbase.com/post/candidates-r13-it-s-karjakin-or-caruana Candidates R13: It's Karjakin or Caruana!], [[Chessbase]], March 27, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

Caruana chose the [[Sicilian Defence]], signalling his intention to play for a win. Karjakin continued with the [[Sicilian Defence#Open Sicilian: 2.Nf3 and 3.d4|Open Sicilian]]. Caruana took the initiative and it appeared as if a win for black could be possible. His pawns were attacking the white king that had castled on the queenside. However, his own king had not castled and became a requirement for the defense of three pawns on d, e, and f file. Eventually, this weakness (aided by an imprecise move 36...Re4?) led to the collapse of the black defense. Caruana resigned on move 44, making Karjakin the winner and challenger for the World Chess Championship 2016.

==Broadcast restrictions==
 
In a matter that dominated early discussion of the Candidates, Agon controversially tried to claim that only approved broadcasters were able to put forth the game moves in real time.&lt;ref name="agon exclusive"&gt;[http://www.agonlimited.com/news/2016/3/4/live-moves-and-video-from-candidates-tournament-to-be-shown-exclusively-by-worldchesscom-and-approved-broadcast-partners Moves from Candidates Tournament exclusively shown by approved broadcast partners] (Agon)&lt;/ref&gt; However, a similar restriction was attempted by [[Sofia]] organizers first for the [[World Chess Championship 2010#Challenger Match|Topalov-Kamsky match]] in 2009 and then the [[World Chess Championship 2010]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessvibes.com/?q=columns/bulgarian-organizers-take-chessbase-to-court Bulgarian organizers take ChessBase to court] (ChessVibes)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://interviews.chessdom.com/chessbase-copyright-danailov ChessBase copyright, Danailov interview] (Chessdom)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gambit.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/a-fight-over-relaying-chess-moves/?_r=0 A fight over relaying chess moves] Gambit Blog (NY Times)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100605121529/http://www.dnevnik.bg/sport/2010/05/31/909514_organizatorite_na_macha_topalov_-_anand_ochakvat_pone  The organizers of the match Topalov - Anand expect at least 500 thousand. Euros if ChessBase site convicted] (Bulgarian)&lt;/ref&gt; with the end result that [[ChessBase]] was found non-culpable in a resulting lawsuit.&lt;ref name="BCF case"&gt;[http://www.chessvibes.com/?q=reports/bulgarian-chess-federation-vs-chessbase-0-1 Bulgarian Chess Federation versus ChessBase 0-1] (ChessVibes)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berlin.de/imperia/md/content/senatsverwaltungen/justiz/kammergericht/presse/16_o_270_10_urteil_vom_29.03.2010_landgericht_berlin_anonymisiert.pdf?download.html Landgericht Berlin decision 16 O 270/10] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://medienrecht-blog.com/2011/04/13/uebertragungsrechte_weltmeisterschaft_schach Internet Law Blogpost] (German)&lt;/ref&gt; The judge in that case took only half an hour to reject all demands from the Bulgarian Chess Federation (BCF), while ChessBase relied on the legal definition of a database. The most important aspect was that the judge did not agree that a chess game can be seen as a database, and therefore the BCF could not refer to their rights as database producers.&lt;ref name="BCF case" /&gt; The president of the BCF, [[Silvio Danailov]], estimated the loss at 1 million euros in a [[Forbes]] interview,&lt;ref name="ECU opinion"&gt;[http://www.europechess.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ECU-NEWSLETTER-102.pdf Danailov profile] Forbes Bulgaria, translated to English by ECU&lt;/ref&gt; though they had only asked 15000 euros from ChessVibes for retransmission rights, and crucially only spent 8000 euros themselves, which the judge found insufficiently substantiated as a realistic amount toward a database endeavor.&lt;ref name="BCF case" /&gt;

===Agon's legal position on move retransmission===
 
Agon produced a legal position white paper (Shekhovtsov &amp; Partners), asserting that chess fans should have to agree to terms and conditions that include not re-transmitting the moves elsewhere, before being allowed access.&lt;ref name="agon white paper"&gt;[http://www.agonlimited.com/s/white_paper_position.pdf Agon Limited, White Paper Position]&lt;/ref&gt; This is in line with a 2011 [[European Chess Union]] memo that produced a legal opinion from Morten Sand, indicating that contract law formed a superior basis for exploiting the chess audiences, with the expectation that viewers could be made to bear 75 euros (each) for the world championships, so that "the financial upside is huge" to generate 750000 euros.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chess.sk/files/subory/1320353998ECUCommissionforCopyrightontheuseofchessgamesfromtheECUcompetitionsreport.pdf Memo Re: Copyrights of chess games – internet transmission of chess games] ECU Copyright Commission, Section 2.4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentary from affected parties===
 
The Bulgarian website Chessdom had the strongest editorial on the matter (from CEO Anton Mihailov), calling Agon's decision a multi-level blunder, even pointing out that Agon's decision actually violates Section 4.7.3.6.4.1 of the [http://www.fide.com/FIDE/handbook/regscandidates2016.pdf Candidates Regulations] ("All live images, live broadcasting (Internet TV) pictures and all the other content for the full event details will be carried on the official domain [moscow2016.fide.com]. The organizer shall not develop any other website.").&lt;ref name="chessdom_response"&gt;[http://www.chessdom.com/agons-new-policy-puts-the-candidates-tournament-idea-in-jeopardy Agon's new policy puts the Candidates tournament idea in jeopardy] (Chessdom)&lt;/ref&gt; However, this item is enforceable only between Agon and [[FIDE]]. Their main thrust though, was:&lt;blockquote&gt;Millions of fans will not learn about this year’s Candidates matches because of AGON’s policy. Many will miss the live coverage and only learn about the games after the tournament is over, when Carlsen’s challenger is known. What is the commercial value of that? Can you calculate how much are the lost benefits for the sponsors of the event? And for the hosts? And for the players? And for the sponsors of the players?&lt;ref name="chessdom_response" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Additionally, Mihailov noted the lack of equality of arms in Agon's legal salvo: "With lawyer white paper threats you have cut any journalist’s right to properly cover the Candidates. While being with the law on their side, no sane journalist will risk losing time and/or money arguing with an organization."&lt;ref name="chessdom_response" /&gt; Two more articles were swiftly published, including a polemic against AGON's monopolistic agenda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessdom.com/agons-new-controversial-policy-is-a-step-towards-monopoly/ Agon's new controversial policy is a step towards monopoly] (Chessdom)&lt;/ref&gt; Chessdom in the end did not broadcast live moves.
 
[[Chess.com]] had an article on the matter, couching their Candidates preview with "a remarkable decision by the organizers might well be the biggest story here", while noting that it personally "lacks the technology [for automated PGN relay] and always relies on volunteers to bring grandmaster games in Live Chess."&lt;ref name="chesscom_article"&gt;[https://www.chess.com/news/candidates-to-start-friday-agon-blocks-games-transmission-by-chess-sites-5161 Candidates' To Start Friday; Agon Blocks Game Transmission By Chess Sites] (Chess.com)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the Norwegian press, [[Magnus Carlsen]] was nonchalant toward the kerfuffle, saying that everyone could just watch the Agon broadcast, with their comments and computer evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dagbladet.no/2016/03/10/sport/sjakk/magnus_carlsen/43467627 Magnus Carlsen interview] (Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[NRK]] will also have move-by-move coverage on NRK.no, according to their own interview with him.&lt;ref name="nrk mc interview"&gt;[http://www.nrk.no/sport/carlsen-fortsatt-skuffet-over-konkurrentene-1.12846681 NRK Interview with Magnus Carlsen] (Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
ChessBomb published that it would not use the Agon site due to non-agreement with terms and conditions,&lt;ref name="chessbomb_scheme"&gt;[http://blog.chessbomb.com/2016/03/candidates-2016-to-start-with.html Candidates 2016 to start with a controversy] (ChessBomb)&lt;/ref&gt; and asked for volunteers to seed their [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] setup (though later dropped this initiative).&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.chessbomb.com/2016/03/candidates-2016-how-to-help-us.html Candidates 2016, How to Help Us] (ChessBomb)&lt;/ref&gt; Implicitly, this relied on the fact that the clickwrap license presented by Agon (or World Chess Events Limited) may not in fact be valid in every viewer locale, so by allowing information to be obtained and retransmitted without contractual obligation.&lt;ref name="chessbomb_scheme" /&gt; However, after a successful Round 1 broadcast, during Round 2 their live move transmissions were essentially halted, with looming legal threats.&lt;ref name="tarjei_tweet" /&gt;

===Resulting effect===
 
[[ChessBase]] ended up taking the threats seriously, which could have been to the dismay of Agon, as the official commentators ([[Alexandra Kosteniuk]] and [[Evgeny Miroshnichenko]]) were trying to use their software in Round 1. Instead, they had to switch to manual entry from ChessBomb.&lt;ref name="chesscom report round1"&gt;[https://www.chess.com/news/anand-beats-topalov-in-first-round-candidates-tournament-6638 Anand beats Topalov in the first round] (Chess.com)&lt;/ref&gt; Alleged violators included not only ChessBomb and Chessdom, but also [[Internet Chess Club|ICC]], [[Chess24.com|Chess24]], and [[Der Spiegel]]. Although the Terms and Conditions (#10) mention New York state law as applicable to those who signed up, Merenzon sent a [[cease and desist]] letter that invoked 10 years [[imprisonment]] under Russian law.&lt;ref name="chesscom report round1" /&gt; The specifying of [[Forum selection clause|choice of venue]] and [[choice of law]] in a [[contract of adhesion]] can also be in dispute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uakron.edu/dotAsset/728194.pdf Contractual choice of law in contracts of adhesion and party autonomy] by Mo Zhang, Akron Law Review, Vol. 41, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Agon also impeded the credentials of Salim Fazulyanov, allegedly as retaliation against his website Kavkaz-Chess.ru for being the first Russian site to publish Chessdom's open letter.&lt;ref name="chessdom round1"&gt;[http://www.chessdom.com/candidates-chess-2016-round-1-live Candidates Live] (Chessdom)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Eventually Agon's own worldchess.com editorial staff broke ranks, declaring that an embargo was not the way to go, but a show.&lt;ref name="show not embargo"&gt;[http://worldchess.com/2016/03/11/win-audiences-and-sponsors-with-a-show-not-an-embargo Win Audiences and Sponsors with a Show, not an Embargo] (Agon)&lt;/ref&gt; The main argument is: holding all the trumps like live video and exclusive interviews with players (and other VIPs) should be enough, without resorting to legal blusterings. Before Round 2, Agon partially relented, dispensing with its presumptory 2-hour [[Portable Game Notation|PGN]] embargo, designating the game's end instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agonlimited.com/news/2016/3/12/zvwkqafbxzlo38pzozsa310zzcvi5s Change in the timing of the release of PGN files] (Agon)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In round 1, the moves were carried live without restriction by official partner [[NRK]].&lt;ref name="nrk mc interview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nrk rights"&gt;[http://www.fide.com/component/content/article/1-fide-news/9281-fide-and-agon-sign-historic-media-rights-with-nrk.html FIDE and Agon sign historic media rights with NRK] (FIDE press release)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nrk access"&gt;[http://www.nrk.no/sport/sjakk NRK.no access to games]&lt;/ref&gt; About 45 minutes into second round, the NRK live move transmission became suspended, causing other sites to also experience confusion.&lt;ref name="nrk access" /&gt; According to reporter Tarjei Svensen on [[Twitter]], Agon was actively pursuing lawsuits against ChessBomb, [[Chess24.com|Chess24]], [[Internet Chess Club|ICC]], and ChessGames.com,&lt;ref name="tarjei_tweet"&gt;[https://twitter.com/TarjeiJS/status/708632720302338048 Tweet] (Tarjei Svensen)&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[chilling effect]] of causing them to essentially suspend activity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/ChessBomb/status/708676377701183488 Tweet] (ChessBomb)&lt;/ref&gt; The Norwegian online newspaper site VG Direkte (also an official partner) initially stayed active (with the [[browsewrap]] language: "By viewing this page you expressly agree not to publish any information concerning the chess moves of the candidates tournament 2016 chess games until the end of such game"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://direkte.vg.no VG Direkte game access]&lt;/ref&gt; but then also suspended activity. [[Der Spiegel]] continued its live ticker of Aronian-Anand analysis throughout.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/sport/sonst/schach-kandidatenturnier-anand-gegen-aronjan-a-1081811.html Live Aronian-Anand Ticker Round 2] (Der Spiegel, German)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legal action and media coverage====
 
After Round 2, Agon officially announced its rumored legal action against the above four broadcasters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agonlimited.com/news/2016/3/12/agon-ltd-commences-legal-action-against-chess24-internetchessclub-chessgames-and-chessbomb-for-breaching-broadcast-restrictions Agon Limited commences legal action] (Agon)&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
[[The Guardian]] newspaper covered an exposé of the ruckus,&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/13/world-chess-champion-magnus-carlsen-candidates-tournament-moscow-agon World's chess fans await next move in battle over tournament broadcasts] by Stephen Moss (The Guardian)&lt;/ref&gt; noting that Agon's tactics may be hoping to at least scare off its rivals and keep the big prize (coverage of the World Championship match with Carlsen) to itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecforum.org.uk/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=8218&amp;start=60#p175859 Re: Agon ban of live move transmissions] by Paolo Casaschi (English Chess Forum)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vladimir Kramnik]] was quoted from an ensuing interview as saying: "If you want to make chess professional, if you want to help chess to grow, you have to understand very clearly that the organiser of any chess tournament has full transmission rights. Because the organiser has invested a lot of money and effort to organise the tournament, morally and legally they have full rights over the live transmission."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agonlimited.com/news/2016/3/14/former-world-champion-vladimir-kramnik-supports-agon-over-live-broadcast-rights Kramnik supports Agon] (Agon)&lt;/ref&gt; Kramnik contended such control was the way football, tennis and other sports had become successful, and by doing the same, chess could jump to a totally different level. He also imposed his own view upon any end user's opinion of the coverage, declaring that "no one is suffering" from Agon's decision. Top organizer [[Stuart Conquest]] was also quoted: "However you look at it, pretty clear that start of Candidates has been a PR [press relations] disaster for organisers / Agon / FIDE."&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/stuthefox/status/708287882738401280 Tweet] (Stuart Conquest)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Round 3 and beyond====
 
ChessBomb's whole site went down (due to a component upgrade gone wrong) 10 minutes into Round 3 without any moves having been shown, while Chess24 intermittently carried the moves of two of the four games (Giri–Karjakin and Nakamura–Svidler) in the early going. Chessgames.com similarly had Giri–Karjakin, while [[Der Spiegel]] had the Anand–Caruana game on their live ticker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/sport/sonst/schach-kandidatenturnier-die-dritte-runde-im-blog-a-1081816.html 3rd round live ticker] (Der Spiegel, German)&lt;/ref&gt; After rectification 10 minutes later, ChessBomb had all three of the above-mentioned games, and Chess24 quickly added Anand–Caruana also.
 
By round 4 the immediate frenzy appeared to have dissipated, as Grandmaster [[David Smerdon]] was given an all-clear from Agon (or World Chess Events Limited) to run a live blog.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chess.com/blog/smurfo/live-blog---2016-world-chess-candidates-round-4 Live Blog] by David Smerdon, Candidates Round 4&lt;/ref&gt; However, the main sites were still lagging in their relays by about 20–25 minutes during the opening moves. The (Agon affiliated) sites NRK and VG Direkte relayed the games with a delay of about 20 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/TarjeiJS/status/709719598866767872 Tweet ] (Tarjei Svensen)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, at approximately an hour into the games, the alternative feeds were nearly keeping pace with Agon's site, though some slowdown sporadically remained. Agon boasted that PGNs were now going to be available as Flash Reports within minutes of the finish of each game.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/theworldchess/status/709762641896579073 Tweet ] (Agon)&lt;/ref&gt; Their own onsite live commentators were still having problems getting the moves to the games at some junctures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/ChessVibes/status/709713144512442368 Tweet ] (ChessVibes)&lt;/ref&gt; Renowned trainer [[Mark Dvoretsky]] was deeply unsympathetic to Agon's position, particularly as the official site was so inconvenient to use, and he also mentioned the privacy issues with the necessity of registering there.&lt;ref name="dvoretsky"&gt;[http://chess-news.ru/node/21179 Interview, Mark Dvoretsky ] (Chess-News, Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

====After the tournament====

Agon, through a company called Turnir Pretendentov LLC (the name meaning 'Candidates Tournament' in Russian) attempted to sue eLearning Ltd. for 20 million roubles, for the live broadcasting of the moves of the Candidates Tournament on chess24.com. Agon's legal claim was rejected in its entirety on 25 October 2016. Agon are also suing ChessGames and ChessBomb; the final hearings in these cases are due to take place on 17 January 2017 and 28 February 2017 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[https://chess24.com/en/read/news/chess24-win-moscow-case-announce-new-york-line-up chess24 win Moscow case, announce New York line-up] (chess24)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Cape Verde]]''' has sent athletes to every [[Summer Olympic Games]] held since [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]], although the country has never won an [[Olympic Games#Olympic champions and medalists|Olympic medal]].  No athletes from Cape Verde have competed in any [[Winter Olympic Games]].

The only category that Cape Verde has consistently competed since it began its participation in the Olympic Games in 1996, is Men's [[Marathon]]; its rank has improved from 94th (1996) to 67th (2000), dropping to 78th (2004), and reaching the best score, 48th in 2008. Other frequent modalities chosen for competition include athletics and gymnastics.

The [[National Olympic Committee]] for Cape Verde is ''Comité Olímpico Cabo-verdiano''.  It was started in 1989 and recognized in 1993.

[[File:Casement Park.jpg|thumb|Pitch and terracing at Casement Park]]
'''Casement Park''' ({{lang-ga|Páirc Mhic Asmaint}}) is the principal [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] stadium in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], home to the [[Antrim GAA|Antrim]] [[Gaelic football|football]] and [[hurling]] teams. It is located in [[Andersonstown]] Road in the west of the city, and named after the [[Irish republicanism|republican]] revolutionary [[Roger Casement|Sir Roger Casement]] (1864-1916). {{As of|2015}} it had an official capacity of 32,282, with safety certification for 31,661, including 6,962 seated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Southern |quote=Additionally, the OBC was informed by the multi-agency review of April 2009 that further informed the safety certificate revisions in 2010.

==History==
Casement Park, one of the largest stadia in [[Ulster]], opened in June 1953, with [[Armagh Harps GFC|Armagh Harps]] defeating St John’s of [[Antrim GAA|Antrim]] in the final of the inaugural [[Ulster Senior Club Football Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=If you don't like the football, there's always Celtic under the stand! |work=Gaelic Life |publisher= |date=16 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly opened Casement Park hosted the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship|Ulster Championship final]] less than a month later, which saw [[Armagh GAA|Armagh]] overcome reigning All-Ireland champions [[Cavan GAA|Cavan]].

The ground's location in a [[Physical force Irish republicanism|republican]] neighbourhood saw incidents during [[the Troubles]] which contributed to unionist perception of the GAA as pro-republican. Rallies against [[Operation Demetrius|the introduction of internment]] were held on 12 September 1971&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Past Two Weeks |jstor=25543703 |journal=Fortnight |date=1971 |issue=24 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 19 March 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Past Three Weeks |jstor=25544024 |journal=Fortnight |date=1972 |issue=37 |pages=11–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was occupied by the [[British Army]] from  [[Operation Motorman]] on 31 July 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beaves |first1=Harry |title=Down Among the Weeds |date=2018 |publisher=Troubador |isbn=9781788037532 |page=73 |url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=bn5IDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; until October 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Past Two Weeks |journal=Fortnight |date=1973 |issue=69 |pages=14–15 : 15 |jstor=25544715 |subscription=Y |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Provisional IRA]] members displayed weapons at a rally there in August 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Coogan |first1=Tim Pat |title=The IRA |date=2002 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=9780312294168 |page=444 |url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=Z4_vCgAAQBAJ&amp;PA444  |accessdate=16 September 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1988, [[Corporals killings|two Army corporals]] who drove into a republican funeral cortège were interrogated in Casement Park before being shot on nearby waste ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Army corporals killed at IRA funeral |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/events/army_corporals_killed_at_ira_funeral |website=History - Troubles |publisher=BBC |accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anniversaries of the [[1981 Irish hunger strike|1981 hunger strike]] were marked by rallies at the stadium in 2001 and 2006, against the wishes of the [[GAA Central Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mendlowitz |first1=Andy |title=Ireland's Professional Amateurs: A Sports Season at Its Purest |date=2007 |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=9780595899869 |page=105 |url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=UcSf2l2kF3IC&amp;pg=PA105 |accessdate=16 September 2018 |language=en}}; {{cite newspaper |newspaper=The Irish News |date=10 September 2001 |title=Mystery over 'GAA fine' for hunger strike rally at Casement}}, cited in {{cite web |title=Sectarianism And Sport In Northern Ireland |page=9: §5 "Media reports relating to sectarianism and sport" |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/sport/docs/rlsnia101001.pdf#page=12 |website=Research Paper 26/01 |publisher=Northern Ireland Assembly |accessdate=16 September 2018 |date=10 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In all, Casement Park has hosted eight Ulster football finals. However, the Antrim ground has not held the provincial showpiece since 1971, with [[St. Tiernach's Park]] in [[Clones, County Monaghan|Clones]] hosting the final every year since except between 2004 and 2006 when it was moved to [[Croke Park]] such was the demand for tickets.  A major facelift of the stadium took place in 2000, a move which saw more championship games played at Casement Park. In 2006, floodlights were added which allowed hurling and football to be played in the evening. On 14 November 2016 Casement Park was officially included as part of [[IRFU 2023 World Cup bid|Ireland's 2023 Rugby World Cup bid]], which in 2017 lost to France.

==Redevelopment==
{{update section|date=September 2018}}
In 2006, proposals were raised to build a new multi-purpose stadium on the site of the old [[Maze (HM Prison)|Maze prison]] near [[Lisburn]], which was intended to host [[association football]], [[rugby union]] and [[Gaelic games]]. However, opposition to the idea led to it being dropped in favour of a new venue in the [[Sydenham, Belfast|Sydenham]] area of East Belfast. This led to [[Ulster GAA]], which was one of the partners in the Maze project, to pull out in favour of remaining at Casement Park.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/plans-for-pound128m-belfast-stadium-unveiled-1653849.html Plans for £128m Belfast stadium unveiled] - The Independent, 25 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] announced that it had granted £138m for various stadium redevelopment projects throughout Northern Ireland. Ulster GAA would receive £61.4m of this, which was to be used to redevelop Casement Park into a 40,000 all-seated stadium with £15 million of partnership investment from the Central Council of the GAA, making it the largest stadium in Ulster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/local/stadiums-fit-for-our-heroes-on-way-at-last-15110370.html Stadiums fit for our heroes on way at last] - Belfast Telegraph, 11 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2012 it was announced that the redevelopment work would start at the end of 2013 with a view to having the new stadium open by September 2015. It was expected that, after its completion, Ulster GAA would move its headquarters from St Tiernach's Park in Clones to Casement Park,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/northern-ireland/17074137 Ulster Council rubber-stamps Casement Park stadium move] - BBC News, 17 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; which would  then have a seating capacity of about 40,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Marie Louise|last=McCrory |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Dream team for stadium redesign |work=The Irish News |publisher= |date=4 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014 the granting of planning permission for the redevelopment of Casement Park was ruled unlawful.

On 28 April 2016 the team behind the Casement Park redevelopment proposals  launched a consultation process in an effort to see what the general public's views are.

'''College of Charleston Baseball Stadium at Patriots Point''' is a baseball venue located in [[Mount Pleasant, South Carolina|Mount Pleasant]], [[South Carolina]].  It is home to the [[College of Charleston Cougars]] baseball team, a member of the [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] [[Colonial Athletic Association]].  

The venue is located across [[Charleston Harbor]] from the campus of the college. The field was constructed for the start of the 2001 season, adjacent to the College of Charleston soccer and softball fields. Since the ballpark opened in 2001, the Cougars have compiled a winning percentage of over .700.&lt;ref name="facil"&gt;[http://www.cofcsports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=14800&amp;ATCLID=717502 The CofC Baseball Stadium at Patriot's Point] at cofcsports.com, URL accessed December 23, 2009. [https://web.archive.org/web/20091009153212/http://www.cofcsports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=14800&amp;ATCLID=717502 Archived] 12/23/09&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable History==

After the ballpark's original opening in 2001, the facility underwent a $3 million renovation in 2007 that expanded the press box to include two radio/television booths, partially covered the seating areas, and increased the seating capacity to 2,000.&lt;ref name="facil" /&gt; The site also includes locker rooms, a club house, an athletic training facility, practice field and a 4,200 square foot indoor practice facility.

The ballpark saw its attendance record broken in 2012, when Charleston hosted then No. 10 [[South Carolina Gamecocks]] at Patriots Point.

In May 2015, the [[Colonial Athletic Association]], of which Charleston is a member, hosted the first of two conference baseball championships at Patriots Point, the second coming in May 2016. The Patriots Point stadium is the third largest baseball facility in the CAA, behind [[Northeastern Huskies|Northeastern]] and [[UNC Wilmington Seahawks|UNCW]].

In late May 2015, the College of Charleston announced their plans to design a new athletics facility at Patriots Point. While the main addition would be a three-story athletic building adjacent to the ballpark, the plans also include the expansion of seating down the third base line at the baseball stadium. The new athletics building, which would be down the left field line of the baseball stadium, would include a weight room and sports medicine facility, locker rooms, coaches’ offices, academic spaces and a viewing deck overlooking the baseball and soccer fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=College of Charleston Announces Plans For New Athletics Facility|url=http://www.cofcsports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=14800&amp;ATCLID=210113704|website=CofCSports.com|publisher=CofCSports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Berger National Memorial''' honors the memory of [[David Mark Berger]], a 28-year-old U.S.-born [[Israelis|Israeli]] [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifter]] who was one of 11 [[Israel at the 1972 Summer Olympics|Israeli athletes]] killed by Palestinian terrorists in the [[Munich massacre]] at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]. The memorial is dedicated to his memory and to the memory of the ten other athletes who were killed.

The black steel sculpture, a design of broken [[Olympic symbols|Olympic rings]], is meant to symbolize the interruption of the Munich games by the tragic events, and the eleven segments on which the rings rest represent each athlete whose life was taken.  The sculpture was fabricated by Romanian-born David E. Davis.

The sculpture was installed on the front lawn of the Mayfield [[Jewish Community Center]] at 3505 Mayfield Road in [[Cleveland Heights, Ohio]] in 1975.  The [[national memorial]] designation was authorized on March 5, 1980.  Because of the demolition of the Mayfield Center in 2005, the memorial was moved to the Mandel Jewish Community Center at 26001 South Woodland Road in [[Beachwood, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;Stratton, Ted S. [http://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/articles/2005/07/21/news/local/memorial0722.txt "Memorial move in the works"] ''Cleveland Jewish News''. July 21, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although formally under the authority of [[Cuyahoga Valley National Park]], maintenance of the memorial is handled by the community center.

Founded in 1980, they competed in the ''[[Liga Nacional de Guatemala|Liga Nacional]]'', the top division in the nation,{{when|date=September 2016}} and played home matches at the [[Estadio Los Cuchumatanes]].

As of summer 2012, the club was disaffiliated and disbanded after not paying player salaries and going into heavy debt.

Bad ownership and mismanagement led to the downfall of the club.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxdeportes.com/sudamericana/story/terremoto-para-el-futbol-en-guatemala/&lt;/ref&gt;

A new club from the same city claiming to have no relation to Deportivo Xinabajul, was founded weeks later, they will begin play in division 3.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emol.com/noticias/deportes/2011/02/19/465573/futbol-de-guatemala-esta-de-duelo-tras-asesinato-de-vicepresidente-del-deportivo-xinabajul.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dipexercise.svg|right|thumb|300px|Dip exercise using a [[dip bar]] ]]
The '''dip or push-ups''' is an exercise used in [[strength training]]. Narrow, shoulder-width dips primarily train the [[triceps]], with major [[synergist]]s being the [[anterior deltoid]], the [[Pectoralis major muscle|pectoralis]] muscles ([[Human sternum|sternal]], clavicular, and minor), and the [[rhomboid muscles]] of the back (in that order).&lt;ref name=ex_triceps&gt;{{cite web|title=Triceps plonk skeleton,doodkDip|url=http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Triceps/BWTriDip.html|publisher=exrx.net|accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wide arm training places additional emphasis on the [[pectoral muscles]], similar in respect to the way a wide grip [[bench press]] would focus more on the pectorals and less on the triceps.&lt;ref name=ex_chest&gt;{{cite web|title=Chest Dip|url=http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/PectoralSternal/BWChestDip.html|publisher=exrx.net|accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proper form is important to avoid putting undue stress on the wrists.

==Classic meaning==
In past decades, the term '[[floor dip]]' was used in place of what is now called a [[press-up]] or [[push-up]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Modern meaning==
To perform a dip, the exerciser hangs from a [[dip bar]] or from a set of [[Rings (gymnastics)|rings]] with their arms straight down and shoulders over their hands, then lowers their body until their arms are bent to a 90 degree angle at the elbows, and then lifts their body up, returning to the starting position. Short people are able to cope better with a narrower grip, but not with a wider one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boulder Shoulders: The Best Shoulder Workout|url=https://www.jackedfactory.com/best-shoulder-workout/|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rs|date=April 2018}}

Due to natural flexibility in the shoulder joints, it is important to try to "lock" them as much as possible during this exercise.  Otherwise, the supporting rotator cuffs may become strained.

==Variation==
Usually dips are done on a [[dip bar]], with the exerciser's hands supporting his or her entire body weight. For added resistance, weights can be added by use of a [[dip belt]], weighted vest, or by wearing a backpack with weights in it. A dumbbell may also be held between the knees or ankles. For less resistance, an assisted dip/pull-up machine can be used which reduces the force necessary for the exerciser to elevate their body by use of a counterweight. One may also use resistance bands hooked under their feet to help if they lack the strength to properly perform a dip.

In the absence of this equipment, a lighter variation of the dip can be performed called the "Bench Dip". The hands are placed on one bench directly underneath the shoulders or on two parallel benches.&lt;ref name=ex_chest_bench&gt;{{cite web|title=Chest Dip (between benches)|url=http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/PectoralSternal/BWChestDipBenches.html|publisher=exrx.net|accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legs are straightened and positioned horizontally; the feet rest on another bench in front of the exerciser. This variation trains the upper body muscles in a similar though not exact manner as the normal dip, whilst reducing the total weight lifted by a significant amount. This exercise can be done also off of the edge of a sofa, a kitchen counter, or any surface that supports the lifter.

[[File:Donnaylogo.jpg|thumb|right]]

'''Donnay Sports''' is a sporting goods brand owned by the British retailer [[Sports Direct International]]. The company was founded in 1910 by Emile Donnay and was based in [[Couvin]], Belgium. Donnay manufactured wooden [[tennis racket]]s from 1934, and by the 1970s was the largest manufacturer of tennis rackets in the world. However, the company failed to adapt to the new market for [[graphite]] rackets, and entered administration in 1988. After a succession of owners, the brand was eventually sold to Sports Direct, who continue to license the use of the brand worldwide.

Donnay rackets were used professionally in Europe by [[Björn Borg]] from 1975 until his retirement in 1983. Other professionals included [[Andre Agassi]], [[Rod Laver]] and [[Greg Rusedski]].

== History ==

The company was founded in 1910 by Emile Donnay (1885 - 1972) as a wooden tool handle manufacturing co-operative with six employees.&lt;ref name=casert&gt;{{cite news|last=Casert|first=Raf|title=Racket Company Faces Bankruptcy After 'Borg Effect' Fizzles|newspaper=The Associated Press|date=August 11, 1988|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1988/Racket-Company-Faces-Bankruptcy-After-Borg-Effect-Fizzles/id-39cad462377c3abba09607810a62c0ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emile Donnay had little education and a modest background.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lavenir.net/article/detail.aspx?articleid=DMF20140107_00413703 L’info sur lavenir.net – L’actu 24h/24, 7 jours sur 7 - Page de redirection&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The company began to diversify into other wooden products, including a bow for archers, which continues to be reflected in the Donnay bow-shaped logo.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://blog.lesoir.be/amortieetlob/2013/12/17/exclusif-quelques-bonnes-feuilles-du-livre-donnay-la-legende/ Exclusif: quelques bonnes feuilles du livre “Donnay, la Légende” | amortie et lob&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924 Donnay built premises in Couvin.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;http://www.donnay.nu/history.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The company manufactured its first tennis rackets in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pro-tennis.be/national/donnay-la-legende-en-vente-uniquement-sur-pro-tennis-be/ Donnay, la légende: en vente uniquement sur pro-tennis.be | Pro-tennis.be&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1950s the company won a valuable contract to produce tennis rackets for [[Wilson Sporting Goods|Wilson]].&lt;ref name="White2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael White|title=A Short Course in International Marketing Blunders: Mistakes Made by Companies that Should Have Known Better|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zz1L3nnNmMcC&amp;pg=PA151|year=2009|publisher=World Trade Press|isbn=978-1-60780-008-8|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Björn Borg in aktie, Bestanddeelnr 930-2092.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Björn Borg]] using a Donnay racket in the final of the 1979 ABN Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam]]

By 1969 Donnay was the world's largest manufacturer of tennis rackets. By the early 1970s, Donnay was producing 2 million rackets a year, 1.3 million of which were shipped to Wilson for distribution.&lt;ref name="White2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael White|title=A Short Course in International Marketing Blunders: Mistakes Made by Companies that Should Have Known Better|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zz1L3nnNmMcC&amp;pg=PA151|year=2009|publisher=World Trade Press|isbn=978-1-60780-008-8|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production suffered in 1973, when Wilson relocated its tennis racket production to Taiwan.&lt;ref name="White2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael White|title=A Short Course in International Marketing Blunders: Mistakes Made by Companies that Should Have Known Better|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zz1L3nnNmMcC&amp;pg=PA151|year=2009|publisher=World Trade Press|isbn=978-1-60780-008-8|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 Donnay produced 1.8 million rackets, almost all made from [[Sorbus aucuparia|ash]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lavenir.net/article/detail.aspx?articleid=DMF20140101_00411282 Donnay, la légende d’une marque - lavenir.net&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The company failed to adapt to the changing market for the new lightweight [[Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer|graphite]] rackets.&lt;ref name="White2009" /&gt; The company produced only 3,000 graphite rackets in 1980, instead concentrating on wood and [[aluminium]] rackets.&lt;ref name="White2009" /&gt; The company continued to manufacture wooden rackets until 1984, by which time they were obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.lesoir.be/amortieetlob/2013/08/09/si-donnay-metait-conte-montrez-votre-interet-et-un-livre-paraitra/ Si Donnay m’était conté…. Montrez votre intérêt et un livre paraîtra | amortie et lob&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Buoyed by the success of signing up Björn Borg as a Donnay user, the company employed 600 people and manufactured around 1.5 million tennis rackets a year.&lt;ref name=casert /&gt; In 1981 Donnay reported a turnover of 2.1 billion Belgian francs. Donnay's fortunes began to fade when Borg retired in 1983.&lt;ref name="White2009" /&gt; Its success had been too closely aligned with Borg's success, and the company lost money for four years before entering administration in 1988 after amassing debts of $35 million.&lt;ref name="White2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name=tapie88&gt;{{cite news|last=Montgomery|first=Paul|title=A Former Singer Becomes Largest Owner of Donnay|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/22/business/business-people-a-former-singer-becomes-largest-owner-of-donnay.html|accessdate=22 January 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=22 September 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company had apparently lacked the negotiation skills to attract another player of Borg's standing as a figurehead.&lt;ref name=casert /&gt;

The Donnay family still controlled 55 percent of the company when it went bankrupt in 1988.&lt;ref name=casert /&gt; The Walloon and Belgian governments held the remaining shares.&lt;ref name=casert /&gt; The company was acquired by a group of investors, led by [[Bernard Tapie]] with a 51 percent stake, the Walloon government with 29 percent and [[Albert Frere]] with 20 percent.&lt;ref name=tapie88 /&gt; In 1991 Tapie sold his 58 percent stake in the company to the Walloon government for $16.2 million in order to finance the acquisition of [[Adidas]] shares.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|last=Reuters|title=Tapie Is Selling Stake in Donnay|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/28/business/company-news-tapie-is-selling-stake-in-donnay.html|accessdate=22 January 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=28 June 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government sold the factory to an Italian sports equipment manufacturer, Carbon Valley, and retained the brand rights.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In December 1992 the Walloon government took ownership of the company in order to prevent it from entering administration again.&lt;ref&gt;European Report  December 12, 1992  STATE AID: GREEN LIGHT FOR SERIES OF GRANTS FROM SPORTS TO SHIPBUILDING&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 SportsDirect acquired the worldwide rights to the Donnay brand from the Walloon government for $3.9 million.&lt;ref name=api&gt;{{cite news|title=Donnay, Famous for its Wooden Rackets, Sold To British Company|newspaper=Associated Press International|date=3 December 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the acquisition, production was based in Portugal, while 23 people remained employed at a distribution centre in Couvin.&lt;ref name=api /&gt; SportsDirect sells Donnay products as an in house brand and licences its production of Donnay branded products overseas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2936143/Sports-World-International-sales-climb-45pc-and-knock-JJB-off-top-spot.html Sports World International sales climb 45pc and knock JJB off top spot - Telegraph&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; SportsDirect also separately licenses the brand to independent manufacturers and sellers of Donnay branded products, including tennis racquet production in the United States. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xenecoretennis.com/ Xenecoretennis]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sponsorships==
Initially, Donnay sponsored Belgian tennis players, and due to the amateur nature of the sport at the time, was only allowed to provide rackets and balls, and a small fee.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Its first foreign sponsorship was with the French tennis player [[Yvon Petra]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

[[Rod Laver]], [[Margaret Court]] and [[Cliff Drysdale]] all played with Donnay rackets.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Donnay sponsored Björn Borg from 1975 to 1983, providing his racket.&lt;ref name=casert /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tennis.com/gear/2011/05/donnay-offers-money-back-guarantee-during-french/38689/ tennis.com - Donnay Offers Money-Back Guarantee During French&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; When Borg renewed the contract in 1979, it was worth $600,000 a year, plus royalties from Borg branded Donnay rackets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhnet.be/archive/borg-et-agassi-a-l-origine-du-mythe-51b7e75de4b0de6db996ea69 Borg et Agassi à l’origine du mythe - DH.be&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eczacıbaşı SK men's basketball team''' (English: Eczacıbaşı Sports Club), commonly known as '''Eczacıbaşı''', was the professional [[basketball]] department of [[Eczacıbaşı S.K.|Eczacıbaşı SK]], a [[sports club]] based in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]. The team competed in the [[Basketbol Süper Ligi|Turkish Basketball Super League]].

==History==
The men's basketball team of Eczacıbaşı SK was established in 1968 as the basketball section of the Turkish industrial group of companies [[Eczacıbaşı|Eczacıbaşı Holding]],&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eczacibasi.com/channels/1.asp?id=141 |title=Eczacıbaşı &amp;#124; Eczacıbaşı Group &amp;#124; Topluluk Profili |website=Eczacibasi.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began to compete in the lower Turkish basketball divisions. The club soon became one of the most successful teams in Turkey, having won two times the 2. Turkish Basketball League (1974, 1991) and most importantly eight times the [[Basketbol Süper Ligi|Turkish Basketball Super League]] afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://basketbol.tblstat.net/td.asp?t=37 |title=Eczacıbaşı - Türkiye Basketbol Ligi Takımı |website=Basketbol.tblstat.net |date= |accessdate=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eczacıbaşı also won the [[Turkish Basketball Presidential Cup|Presidential Cup]] in 1988 against [[Fenerbahçe Men's Basketball|Fenerbahçe]].

At the start of the 1992-93 season the board of Eczacıbaşı SK took the decision that ended their basketball department activities on 3 August 1992 (1992 because of falling for the second time), and the team was disbanded by announcing its withdrawal from the league.

==Naming history==
The stadium has been officially known as FNB Stadium since it was opened in 1989. This was due to a [[naming rights]] deal with [[First National Bank (South Africa)|First National Bank]]. During the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], as well as in the month before the tournament, the stadium was referred to as Soccer City. This was done as [[FIFA]] does not allow stadiums to be referred to by sponsored names during FIFA-sanctioned tournaments. The stadium's current name is FNB Stadium.

==Construction==
Built in 1987, the stadium underwent a major upgrade for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, with a new design inspired by the shape of an African pot, the [[calabash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/stadiums/soccer-city-johannesburg/6554681/Soccer-City-Stadium-Johannesburg-World-Cup-2010-stadium-guide.html|title=Soccer City Stadium, Johannesburg: World Cup 2010 stadium guide|date=2009-11-19|access-date=2017-12-05|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soccercity2010.co.za/news_award.asp|title=News Award|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=7 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804055452/http://www.soccercity2010.co.za/news_award.asp|archivedate=4 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The South African main contractor GLTA, part of the Aveng Group in a joint venture with the Dutch company [[Koninklijke BAM Groep|BAM]] who had a 25% stake, constructed the upgrade, which was designed by the architects HOK Sport (renamed Populous in January 2009) and Boogertman + Partners. The upgrade included: an extended upper tier around the stadium to increase the capacity to 88,958,&lt;ref name="soccercityready"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joburg.org.za/fifaworldcup/content/view/3428/276/ |title=Soccer City is ready for play |date=23 October 2009 |accessdate=23 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309043155/http://www.joburg.org.za/fifaworldcup/content/view/3428/276/ |archivedate=9 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an additional 2 executive suites, an encircling roof, new changing room facilities and new floodlights.

==Stadium design==
[[File:Mandela-Memorial-FNB- 2013-12-10-2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Inside the FNB stadium]]
The outside of the stadium is designed to have the appearance of an African pot; the cladding on the outside is a mosaic of fire and earthen colours with a ring of lights running around the bottom of the structure, simulating fire underneath the pot. No spectator is seated more than 100&amp;nbsp;metres (330&amp;nbsp;ft) from the field, and there are no restricted views in the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8092181.stm|title=World Cup: One year to go |date=2009-06-11|work=BBC News|accessdate=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stands in the FNB Stadium are articulated by ten black vertical lines; nine are aligned geographically with the nine other stadiums involved in the 2010 World Cup. Because 9 is considered to be an unlucky number in South African traditional culture,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} a tenth line was added. This tenth line is aimed at Berlin's [[Olympic Stadium (Berlin)|Olympic Stadium]], which hosted the previous World Cup final in 2006. This represents the road to the final and it is hoped that after the World Cup, each goal scored at the stadium will be placed in pre-cast concrete panels on a podium so that the full history of the tournament's scores can be seen for years to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shine2010.co.za/Community/blogs/goodnews/archive/2009/10/21/take-a-seat-at-soccer-city.aspx|title=Take a seat at Soccer City|accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Before the upgrade==
Before the upgrade, the stadium had a capacity of 80,000. The newly reconstructed stadium retains part of the original structure's west upper tier, although this and the entire lower tier were rebuilt to improve sightlines. The lower tier was completely reconstructed and divided into two segments which enabled the creation of a new lower concourse (the lower embankment concourse) linked to the existing ground level concourse.

==Major tournaments==

===1996 African Cup of Nations===
FNB Stadium served as the main venue for the tournament. It hosted the opening game, 5 other group games, a quarter final, a semi final, the 3rd place play-off and the final. The games were:

==Football==

===International football===
FNB stadium has been used by the [[South Africa national football team|South African national football team]] for both friendlies and qualification matches. It was seen as the de facto national stadium for Bafana Bafana after re-admission in 1992, who played their third ever international match there on 11 July 1992 where they drew 2-2 with Cameroon courtesy of goals from Phil and Bennett Masinga for South Africa in front of 65,000 supporters. The "old" FNB Stadium also housed the then South African Football Association (SAFA) headquarters as well as the offices of the semi-professional National Soccer League (which later traded as the professional Premier Soccer League).

[[File:FIFA World Cup 2010 Uruguay Ghana.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Uruguay v. Ghana at the FNB Stadium, 2 July 2010]]
The stadium has also hosted large continental club fixtures. It is largely remembered as the venue where Bafana Bafana lifted the 1996 Africa Cup of Nations when they beat Tunisia 2-0 in front of a full capacity in a match witnessed by then South African president, Nelson Mandela, his then deputy president and former South African State President, FW de Klerk, as well as Zulu monarch, King Zwelithini. The South African national football team also won their first ever trophy here when they lifted the Simba Four Nations Cup in 1995, in a competition featuring Egypt, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

The venue for the first leg of the [[1995 African Cup of Champions Clubs]] final, between [[Orlando Pirates F.C.|Orlando Pirates]] and [[ASEC Abidjan]]. The stadium has also hosted the [[CAF Super Cup]] twice. It hosted the [[1994 CAF Super Cup]], between [[Zamalek SC|Zamalek]] and [[Al-Ahly]], as well as the [[1996 CAF Super Cup]] between Orlando Pirates and [[JS Kabylie]]. In 2004, the stadium hosted final of the [[Vodacom Challenge]], between [[AS Vita Club]] and [[Kaizer Chiefs F.C.|Kaizer Chiefs]].

Some of the most memorable Bafana Bafana matches at the venue include the narrow 3-2 defeat to Brazil in 1996 as well as the country's memorable triumph when they secured passage through to a first ever World Cup appearance for the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France when they beat Republic of Congo 1-0 through a Phil Masinga strike in 1997.

During the 2010 FIFA World Cup, one of the most entertaining matches was played here in the quarterfinal stages when Uruguay beat Ghana 2-1 made more memorable by a blatant handball by Uruguay striker, Luis Suarez's handball which denied a Ghana and Africa a first ever semifinal appearance at the world soccer showpiece.

===Local football===
The FNB Stadium is home to Kaizer Chiefs Football Club. It is also the preferred venue for the Soweto derby football matches - the country's biggest sporting showpiece - involving Soweto based [[Premier Soccer League]] clubs, Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates. It was also the traditional home of the Iwisa Maize Meal Spectacular and later, the Telkom Charity Cup, which were charity soccer season openers in South African football from 1990 to 2006, before it was closed for renovations. The Charity Cup then returned in [[2010 Telkom Charity Cup|2010]]. The stadium was re-opened when it hosted the [[2010 Nedbank Cup]] final between [[Bidvest Wits]] and [[AmaZulu F.C. (South Africa)|Amazulu]]. The game ended, 3–0, to Bidvest Wits. [[Fabricio Rodrigues]] was the first player to score at the "new" Soccer City. The first league match at the stadium since being rebuilt, was a [[2010–11 Premier Soccer League]] match between [[Orlando Pirates F.C.|Orlando Pirates]] and [[Free State Stars]]. The first [[MTN 8]] match at the stadium was the first leg of the [[2010 MTN 8]] semifinal, between [[Orlando Pirates F.C.|Orlando Pirates]] and [[Kaizer Chiefs F.C.|Kaizer Chiefs]]. The venue has also hosted high-profile Bafana Bafana matches, including the South African national football team's 1-0 win over Spain in 2013 as well as the side's worst ever defeat when they lost 5-0 to Brazil in another international friendly in 2014. 

In May 2018, [[Mamelodi Sundowns]] hosted [[FC Barcelona]] in an exhibition match, dedicated to the late Former [[President of South Africa]] in his centenary. The match ended 3-1 in the favour of Barcelona.

==Rugby==
FNB stadium is a multi-purpose venue and hosted its first [[rugby union]] match in 2010, the [[2010 Tri Nations Series|Tri Nations match]] between [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] and [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]], won by the latter. The attendance was 94,713 which is listed as the third highest rugby attendance ever in the Southern Hemisphere and a record attendance for the redeveloped stadium until it was eclipsed on 1 August 2015 when 94,807 was recorded when Orlando Pirates played Kaizer Chiefs in the Carling Black Label Cup fixture. The stadium hosted New Zealand again in the [[2012 Rugby Championship]] on 6 October with the All Blacks defeating the Springboks 32-16 in front of 88,739. In 2013 the Springboks defeated Argentina 73–13 at FNB Stadium in front of a crowd 52,867. In 2016, the venue hosted Varsity Cup rugby fixtures.

The '''Gangneung Oval''' ([[Korean language|Korean]]: 강릉 스피드 스케이팅 경기장) is a [[speed skating rink|speed skating oval]] in [[South Korea]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://gnews.gwd.go.kr/upload/20150122/E401D211-F882-8037-5A4B-58CCC4583CA6.jpg Artificial image of the coming arena]&lt;/ref&gt; which was used for the [[Speed skating at the 2018 Winter Olympics|speed skating competitions at the 2018 Winter Olympics]]. The building of the oval was started in September 2013. The venue consists of a double track 400 metre rink and has a capacity of 8000 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=6 July 2012|title=General Overview of Competition Venues|url=http://www.pyeongchang2018.org/horizon/eng/page/sub04/sub04_02_02.asp|accessdate=12 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821010508/http://www.pyeongchang2018.org/horizon/eng/page/sub04/sub04_02_02.asp|archivedate=21 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has three floors above ground and two underground levels. The original plan was to build the venue at the [[Gangneung Science Park]], but because there was limited space due to the number of local businesses taking the opportunity to relocate, the oval was built in the [[Gangneung Olympic Park]], in the vicinity of the [[Gangneung Ice Arena]] and [[Gangneung Hockey Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pyeongchang2018.org/upload/downloads/pyeongchang2018_web_volume2.pdf|accessdate=5 October 2012|format=PDF|publisher=Newhorizons|title=Pyeongchang Volume 2|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318102233/http://www.pyeongchang2018.org/upload/downloads/pyeongchang2018_web_volume2.pdf|archivedate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date = 6 July 2012 |title=Pyeongchang 2018 move venue for Opening and Closing Ceremonies|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/olympics/winter-olympics/2018/17597-pyeongchang-2018-move-venue-for-opening-and-closing-ceremonies|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the facility was started on 29 October 2014.

'''Labatt Memorial Park''' (formerly '''Tecumseh Park''', 1877–1936) is a [[baseball]] [[stadium]] near the forks of the [[Thames River (Canada)|Thames River]] in central [[London, Ontario]], Canada. It is {{convert|8.7|acre|m2}} in size, has 5,200 seats and a natural grass field. From home plate to centre field the distance is {{convert|402|ft|m}}; from home plate to left and right field down the lines, it is {{convert|330|ft|m}}.

Labatt Park is the "oldest continually operating baseball grounds in the world", with a history dating back to 1877. Since December 31, 1936, Labatt Park has been owned by the City of London.

On September 7, 2011, [[Baseball Canada]] announced that historic Labatt Memorial Park in London, Ontario, had won its six-week-long, favourite ballpark contest, winning the final round where it went head-to-head with [[Port Arthur Stadium]] in [[Thunder Bay]], Ontario. During the two-week-long, final round of online voting, where more than 19,000 votes were cast, Labatt Park won with 63 per cent of the vote.

However, Fuller Field in [[Clinton, Massachusetts]] made it into the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] in September 2007 as the "world's oldest continually used baseball diamond/ field", dating back to 1878—a year after Tecumseh Park-Labatt Park opened in 1877—as Fuller Field's home plate and bases have purportedly remained in the same location since 1878, whereas home plate at Labatt Park has been moved (within the same field) from its original location in 1877.

In September 2008, however, Labatt Park replaced Clinton, Massachusetts' Fuller Field in the 2009 Guinness Book of World Records (page 191) as the "World's Oldest Baseball Diamond." Although it has flip flopped in the past, as of January 4, 2016, Guinness's online record for the World's Oldest Baseball Field/Diamond now states Labatt Park, London, Ontario. [http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/oldest-baseball-field-diamond World's Oldest Baseball Field]

On May 30, 1994, the park was designated by [[London City Council]] under Part IV of the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]'' as an [[historic site]] ''via'' by-Law No. L.S.P.-3237-544, with the ceremonial plaque unveiling at the front gates of the park occurring on July 1 ([[Canada Day]]), 1994, prior to a doubleheader between the [[London Majors]] and Toronto Maple Leafs of the [[Intercounty Baseball League]].

The park's designation occurred after a six-month-long lobbying effort spearheaded by the volunteer, [[non-profit organization]], The [[Friends of Labatt Park]], which has undertaken a number of initiatives during the past 24 years to enhance and promote the ballpark, its history and ambience.

A possible new stadium for the [[Montreal Expos]] was proposed (to replace the aging [[Montreal Olympic Stadium]] which the Expos had called home since the 1970s), also to be named Labatt Park. However, plans for the new stadium were shelved when the necessary public funding could not be secured. [http://www.stadiumpage.com/stpages/labatt.html]

==Commons area at the riverforks==

According to [[Seneca College]]'s Professor Bill Humber, a noted Canadian baseball historian and author, the site of today's Labatt Park was likely used for recreational games when it was a grassy commons area at the riverforks, prior to becoming Tecumseh Park in 1877.

Baseball's roots are in the immediate area around London.  The game of baseball, a derivative of the British game of [[rounders]], had probably arrived in the area from nearby [[Beachville]], Ontario, where the world's first recorded baseball game was played in 1838. (See [[Baseball Before We Knew It]] and [[Origins of baseball]] for other possible origins).

==London Tecumsehs==

The founding of the [[London Tecumsehs]] Baseball Club in 1868 ultimately led to the creation of Tecumseh Park in 1877. According to the ''London Advertiser'' of May 4, 1877, the first game at the new baseball park was held on May 3, 1877, with a contest between the London Tecumsehs and its junior team, the London Atlantics. The Tecumsehs won 5-1.

To wit: "The first regular game of baseball of the season was played yesterday afternoon in the presence of fully a thousand people. The new grounds are the most complete of every respect of  any of the kind in Canada, and but few American cities have a convenient playing field."

On May 4, 1877, the Tecumsehs met the Hartfords of Brooklyn in their first International league game. Phil Powers, the Tecumsehs' star catcher, was out with a broken finger. The London nine were defeated 6-2.

On May 24, 1877, before 8,000 fans, the National League champion [[History of the Boston Braves|Boston Red Stockings]] played the London Tecumsehs of the fledgling [[International Association (baseball)|International Association]] with its star pitcher and later Chicago White Stocking stalwart, [[Fred Goldsmith (baseball)|Fred Goldsmith]]. Boston narrowly defeated London, 7-6.

Created by London china merchant W. J. Reid, Tecumseh Park was named after the [[Shawnee]] Chief [[Tecumseh]] who fought alongside the British during the [[War of 1812]] and who died in the [[Battle of the Thames]] near [[Chatham, Ontario]], in October 1813.

Jacob Englehart, the [[Cleveland]]-born oil tycoon, a future vice president of [[Imperial Oil]] and the Tecumseh's president/principal owner, moved the team to Tecumseh Park in 1877.

Englehart soon began looking for professional players from the U.S., later signing four Americans:

* first-baseman/manager George "Juice" Latham
* pitcher [[Fred Goldsmith (baseball)|Fred Goldsmith]] of [[New Haven, Connecticut]] (believed by many to be the co-inventor of the [[curveball]] along with [[Candy Cummings]] of [[Ware, Massachusetts]])
* catcher [[Phil Powers]] and
* infielder/outfielder [[Joe Hornung]] (nicknamed "Dutchy" and "Ubbo Ubbo") from [[Carthage, New York]].

Goldsmith's first complete game with the Tecumsehs occurred on May 24, 1876, when London played Guelph Maple Leafs before 6,000 spectators at the old Fair Grounds (southeast corner of Wellington and Pall Mall streets in London), a contest that London won 8-7 in 10 innings, largely due to Goldsmith's "scientific pitching", using his innovative "skew ball."

After the Tecumsehs, Goldsmith went on to pitch for the [[Troy, New York]] Trojans in 1879, [[National League]]'s [[Chicago White Stockings (1870–89)|Chicago White Stockings]] from 1880 to 1884 and the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]]'s [[Baltimore Orioles]], also in 1884.

In addition to Englehart, the Tecumsehs' back-room movers and shakers consisted of London newspaperman Harry Gorman; Ed Moore, manager of the Tecumseh House; Richard Meredith, a future chief justice of the Supreme Court of Ontario; [[William Southam]], who was to found [[Southam News]] and to add an egalitarian touch, Jim Jury, a custodian at the collegiate institute.

The following year in 1877, the Tecumsehs played in the [[International Association (baseball)|International Association]], a rival of the [[National League]]. That year, the Tecumsehs defeated the National League's [[History of the Boston Braves|Boston Red Stockings]] in an exhibition game at Tecumseh Park and later in the season they defeated the [[Pittsburgh Allegheny]] 5-2 to win the International Association pennant. More than 6,000 people attended London's pennant-winning game in a park built to seat 600.

After the season, the Tecumsehs were offered membership in the National League, but declined. The Tecusmsehs subsequently folded on August 22, 1878, due to financial difficulties compounded by a questionable game lost by the Tecumsehs and the International Association floundered a few years later. Both were resurrected in 1888 and 1889.

Among its more notable stars in 1888 was outfielder [[Patsy Donovan]] who went on to an outstanding career in [[Major League Baseball]] as both a player and a manager.

The Tecumsehs also played at the park pre- and post-1920, with [[Charlie Gehringer|Charlie (Mechanical Man) Gehringer]] playing with the 1921–1924 Tecumsehs before he went on to a stellar career with the [[Detroit Tigers]]. Gehringer was subsequently inducted into the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[Cooperstown, New York]].

American baseball historians [[Bill Weiss]] and [[Marshall Wright]] have placed the 1920 London Tecumsehs on the list of the Top 100 Minor League Baseball Teams of all-time—coming in at #52, with a record of 86 wins and 32 losses.

On September 15, 1920, with [[Ty Cobb]] in the lineup, the Detroit Tigers defeated the London Tecumsehs 5-4 before 3,000 people at Tecumseh Park in exhibition baseball. Reserved seating for the game was $1.

The 1920 Tecumsehs clinched the first-place pennant with 15 games to play and London led the Michigan-Ontario league in attendance, with an astonishing 100,686 people watching them play.

On May 9, 1921, under manager [[George Gibson (baseball)|George (Mooney) Gibson]], the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the London Tecumsehs 8-7 at Tecumseh Park before 3,500 people in an exhibition baseball game. Before the game, Gibson and his team were presented with a silver loving cup by the London Kiwanis Club. Gibson thrilled the locals by catching the opening inning with his 1909 [[World Series]]-winning battery mate [[Babe Adams]] and singling and scoring a run in his lone at-bat. London Mayor [[Edgar Sydney Little|Syd Little]] entertained the team that evening at his home.

On September 14, 1921, the Tecumsehs won the Michigan-Ontario Baseball League championship, 1-0 over [[Bay City, Michigan]], before 1,000 people at Tecumseh Park. London scored its lone run in the first inning when third baseman [[Doc Shay]], playing his first game of the series because of illness, tripled and scores on a sacrifice fly. In three games of the series, London pitcher [[Frank Herbst]] of London allowed six hits and only one run in 33 innings. London advanced against [[Ludington, Michigan]], champions of the Central League.

On September 28, 1921, London won the best-of-seven series against Ludington 4-3, taking Game 7 10-7 at Grand Rapids, Mich. The Tecumsehs were down 3-1 in the series. A few days later, London manager [[Buzz Wetzel]] was presented with a gold watch to commemorate the win. The normally reserved Wetzel spoke, saying, "I tried to do what was right and give you the best I had and I honestly believe that the fans here have a right to be proud of their baseball team."

On May 23, 1923, Washington's pitching ace [[Walter Johnson]] was in uniform but did not pitch as the [[Washington Senators (1901–60)|Washington Senators]] defeated the Tecumsehs 13-9 in an exhibition baseball game at Tecumseh Park.

==George (Mooney) Gibson==

[[Image:George Gibson baseball card.jpg|thumb|George Gibson baseball card, 1911]]
One of the early stars to emerge from Tecumseh Park was London West resident, [[George Gibson (baseball)|George Gibson]], a young bricklayer-homebuilder turned catcher who enjoyed a lengthy playing career with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], winning the [[World Series]] in 1909 by beating [[Ty Cobb]]'s Detroit Tigers. When he arrived back at the train station in his hometown on October 27, 1909, there were more than 5,000 cheering fans to greet him. London, at the time, had approximately 35,000 residents.

Gibson played in the Major Leagues until 1918, 12 years with the Pirates and two years with the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]], appearing in 1,213 games.

Gibson first signed a pro contract in 1903 and joined the Pittsburgh Pirates two years later. He had a strong throwing arm and led National League catchers in fielding percentage several times. Known as a developer of young pitchers, Gibson later managed the Toronto Maple Leafs of the AAA [[International League]] in 1919, the Pirates (1920&amp;ndash;1922, 1932&amp;ndash;1934) and the [[Chicago Cubs]] (1925).

He was named Canada's baseball player of the half century and in 1958 was the first baseball player elected to the [[Canadian Sports Hall of Fame]]. He was subsequently inducted into the [[Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame]] &amp; Museum in 1987 and was one of the inaugural 10 inductees into the London Sports Hall of Fame in 2001.

==Thames River flood of 1883==

Tecumseh Park was damaged by a flood of the Thames River on July 11, 1883 which destroyed the original grandstands, located near today's outfield foul ball lines. Originally, home plate was located in today's left-centre field. The new replacement grandstand (1883–1937) was built facing east toward downtown London, with home plate moved to approximately the same location as it is today.

Beginning in 1892 the park was used for amateur and professional [[bicycle]] races, attracting such international stars as [[Harley Davidson]] (the ''Canadian Wheelman'', a late-19th century cycling magazine was started and published in London).

Baseball continued to be played there as well, with three more incarnations of the Tecumsehs in the International Association (1888–1889), the International League (1890), and the Canadian League (1898–1900), with the London Alerts, also of the Canadian League, playing in 1897 and 1899. Meanwhile, in 1895 the park was the site of the first-ever [[motion picture]] display in London, organized by the London Bicycle Club.

The London Cockneys played in the Class D International League in 1908 and the Class C Canadian League in 1911, while another Tecumsehs club played in the Class C and Class B Leagues from 1912 to 1915. It was during this period that [[Earle Neale]] played baseball at Labatt Park before he started his career in the Big Leagues with the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in 1916, later becoming an award-winning and innovative football coach in American pro football.

The Tecumsehs played in the Class B Michigan–Ontario League from 1919 to 1924, and during the early 1920s, the team included future [[Major League Baseball|Major League]] second-base star [[Charlie Gehringer]]. Gehringer and the Tecumsehs defeated the [[Boston Red Sox]] in an exhibition game, also in 1921. A second London team, the Indians, played in the Michigan–Ontario League in 1925. The Tecumsehs also played in the Class D Ontario League in 1930.

In 1940 and 1941, the London Pirates played in the Pennsylvania–Ontario–New York League, more commonly known as the [[PONY League]]. It was during this period that lights were installed at Labatt Park to permit night baseball. The 1941 Pirates team included pitcher Russ Getsinger and future Major Leaguers such as Jim Jordan and [[Vic Barnhart]]. Vic's brother [[Bob Barnhart]] was also a teammate on the 1941 London Pirates. Vic's father [[Clyde Barnhart]] was a star with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] throughout the 1920s including the 1925 and 1927 World Series teams.

==Negro Leagues and other players==

During the first half of the 20th Century, Labatt Park (Tecumseh Park until December 31, 1936) was regularly visited by numerous [[barnstorming]] [[Negro]] teams from the U.S., plus a much-celebrated visit by legendary African-American pitcher [[Satchel Paige]] on June 30, 1954, when Paige was barnstorming with a baseball version of the [[Harlem Globetrotters]]. Paige pitched the last three innings of an exhibition game against another legendary barnstorming ream—The [[House of David (commune)|House of David]] baseball team, who all sported beards and long hair and travelled with their own generator-powered lights (before Labatt Park installed lights in the 1940s), which featured noted baseball clown, Frank (Bobo) Nickerson.

As of October 1, 1923, The London Colored Stars, a Negro baseball team, had won 15 of 19 games and announced they "are looking for more engagements."

Additionally, numerous former players with the [[Negro Leagues]] played in the Senior [[Intercounty Baseball League]] after the Negro Leagues gradually folded after Jackie Robinson broke the "colour barrier" in 1947, including pitcher Ted Alexander of the [[Kansas City Monarchs]] and the [[Homestead Grays]] (1950-51 [[London Majors]]); [[Wilmer Fields]] ([[Brantford Red Sox]]); [[Jimmy Wilkes]] (retired jersey #5 for the Brantford Red Sox, later became a City league umpire after a decade with Brantford); Gentry (Geep) Jessup (Galt Terriers); Larry Cunningham (Galt Terriers, [[Hamilton Cardinals]]); Ed Steele (Galt) and Shanty Clifford (Galt and Brantford); Luther Clifford; Max Manning; Lester Lockett; Bob Thurman and [[Stanley Glenn]] ([[St. Thomas Elgins]]); all made numerous appearances at Labatt Park in the 1950s.

The late Wilmer (The Great) Fields is a former president of the Negro Leagues Baseball Association (NLBPA), while Stanley (Doc) Glenn is currently the president of the NLBPA.

==Bryce's 1876 and 1877 Baseball Guides==

This is the world's oldest baseball grounds still in existence. [[Image:Bryces Base Ball Guide 1876.jpg|thumb|left|Front cover to Bryce's Base Ball Guide 1876, published in London, Ont.]]
[[Image:Bryces Base Ball Guide 1876 socks.jpg|thumb|left|Baseball socks for sale in Bryce's Base Ball Guide 1876]]

A treasure-trove of information about early Canadian/Ontario "base ball" surfaced in 2002 when [[Library and Archives Canada]] purchased (for $10,000 from an [[Ottawa, Ontario]], bookseller) ''Bryce's Base Ball Guide 1876'' and ''Bryce's Base Ball Guide 1877'', two hand-coloured, 75-page booklets published by William Bryce of London, Ontario, which originally sold for a dime.

The two, four-inch (102&amp;nbsp;mm)  by seven-inch guides are considered to be the first significant publications on Canadian baseball.

Bryce, a Scottish-born bookseller, news agent and sporting goods distributor in London, had a small stake in the Tecumsehs, considered by many to be the finest ball team in the entire Dominion of Canada.

During U.S. President [[George W. Bush]]'s visit to the Library and Archives Canada building on November 30, 2004, he showed a special interest in these two early Canadian base ball books which were laid out for his perusal. See here [http://listserv.muohio.edu/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind0412b&amp;L=archives&amp;T=0&amp;P=6339]

==Tecumseh Park becomes Labatt Park==

According to the 1926 [[Geodetic Survey]] of Canada (and the subsequent detailed maps printed in 1928), there was a structure situated near what is now the main entrance to the ballpark at 25 Wilson Avenue (at the time, the two entrances to the ballpark were off of Dundas Street—now Riverside Drive—including an [[art deco]] entranceway that was demolished in the early 1980s).

According to Mooney Gibson's nephew, George Lambourn, a noted baseball historian in his own right, the residence at 27 Wilson Avenue was the home of the park's cranky caretaker, Jakey Butts, which was destroyed by the Thames River flood of 1937.

This devastating flood damaged the park again, necessitating the construction of the park's third grandstand (1937–2001) and a new clubhouse, with the local [[Labatt Brewing Company]] donating $10,000 to renovate the park, as well as deeding the park itself to the City of London on December 31, 1936, with the written provisions that the park remain a public athletic park in [[perpetuity]] and that it be renamed "The John Labatt Memorial Athletic Park."

From a sociological-historical perspective, it could be argued that the name change from Tecumseh Park to Labatt Memorial Park highlights the dramatic shift from 19th-Century [[Colonialism|colonial]] Canada (where the Shawnee Chief Tecumseh was immortalized throughout Canada for aiding the British in the War of 1812) to more modern times where businesses such as the [[Labatt Brewing Company]] exercised considerable influence on the cultural fabric of the day.

At the end of August during the 1950s, Labatt Park annually hosted athletes from across the city's playgrounds competing in a variety of sports during a two- to three-day event, called the "Junior Olympiad." (A P.U.C. Playground Supervisor's Reunion was held on June 24, 2006, at the City-owned Thames Valley Golf Course.)

==Frank Colman and Tom Burgess==

Other London notables to graduate to the Major Leagues from Labatt Park during the 1940s are Tom (Tim) Burgess (1927–2008) and [[Frank Colman]] (1918&amp;ndash;1983).

In 1936, Frank Colman started out at Labatt Park with the London Majors of the Senior Intercounty Baseball League, winning the [[Most Valuable Player]] award, batting title and Intercounty Baseball League championship. Colman was 25 when he broke into the major leagues as a right fielder with the Pittsburgh Pirates, playing with them from 1942 through 1946, before he moved to New York to play with the Yankees. He played with the Yankees in 1946 and 1947, where he roomed with Yankee catcher [[Yogi Berra]]. He finished his six-year major league career with 571 at-bats, 15 home runs and 106 RBIs.

Colman returned to London in 1954 after playing in the minor leagues and being the player/coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs of the AAA [[International League]] from 1951–1953. He bought the London Majors and, as player/ owner, won the Intercounty League title in 1956 and the Great Lakes championship in 1957 before returning to the Intercounty League in 1958 and selling the team in 1959.

Colman is also a co-founder of the [[Eager Beaver Baseball Association]] (EBBA) in London which has provided competitive league play for thousands of youngsters since its founding in 1955. In 1984, a year after Colman's death, the EBBA's all-star day in mid-July was renamed "Frank Colman Day."

Colman was inducted into the [[Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame]] &amp; Museum in 1999 and the London Sports Hall of Fame in 2005.

In a letter to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999, Yogi Berra wrote that he visited Colman at his home in Canada on several occasions.

"I've made a lot of friends in baseball through the years, but I'll always remember Frank as one of the most decent and genuine people that I ever met", Berra wrote. "I was proud that he was my friend."

Tom Burgess first signed a pro contract with St. Louis in 1946 and played right field and first base for the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] from 1954 to 1961 and right field and first base for the [[Los Angeles Angels]] from 1962&amp;ndash;1963.

&lt;div style="padding:6px; margin:6px; border:2px solid #0f0; background:#e4f2ff;"&gt;

''"[Former P.U.C. recreation director] Bill Farquharson gave me the opportunity from the playground days and I worked my way up to the big leagues where I made a living for 44 years."''—Tom (Tim) Burgess, November 28, 2005 &lt;/div&gt;

Since 1968, Burgess has been involved in [[Major League Baseball]] in a variety of managing, coaching and instructor capacities with several organizations, including the St. Louis Cardinals from 1968 to 1975, the New York Mets from 1976 to 1977, the Texas Rangers from 1980 to 1984, the Detroit Tigers from 1985 to 1987, the [[Kansas City Royals]] from 1987 to 1995. From 1996 to the present day, Burgess has been an instructor with both Baseball Canada and the Ontario Baseball Association. He was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame &amp; Museum in 1992 and the London Sports Hall of Fame in 2003.

==London Supremes and London Army Team==

During World War II (1942 onward), the park was the home field for several women's baseball, softball and fastball teams, including the London Supremes who played in the [[Michigan]]&amp;ndash;[[Ontario]] Women's Fastball League into the 1950s. In 1943 and 1944, the London Army Team won the Canadian Sandlot title.

Shortly after World War II Labatt Park was the home of the [[London Majors]], which won the Canadian Sandlot Congress in 1947 and the Can-Am Baseball Congress championship in 1948, beating the [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], General Electrics in a best-of-seven-game series at Labatt Park, as well as winning the Canadian, Ontario and Intercounty titles.

==Denny McLain and Fergie Jenkins==

In 1974, after [[Cy Young Award]]-winning pitcher [[Denny McLain]] had retired from the major leagues (two years earlier), McLain played a season for the London Majors, restricting himself to home games at Labatt Park. Due to arm problems, however, McLain only pitched nine innings for the Majors, but did play in 14 games at either shortstop, first base and catcher and batted .380, including hitting two homers in one game in London.

After Cy Young Award-winning pitcher [[Ferguson Jenkins|Fergie Jenkins]] pitched his final major league game on September 26, 1983, London Majors' owner-player [[Arden Eddie]] convinced Jenkins to pitch for the Majors in 1984-85, commuting from his home near [[Chatham, Ontario]]. The Canadian-born Jenkins is one of the few MLB players to have been inducted into both the Baseball Hall of Fame &amp; Museum in [[Cooperstown, New York]] and the [[Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame &amp; Museum]] in St.Marys, Ontario, Canada.

==Tigers, Werewolves and Monarchs==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:BeamClayplaque.jpg|thumb|left| Beam Clay Award at the front gates of Labatt Park]] --&gt;

Professional baseball declined in London after the war, with mostly amateur teams playing at Labatt Park in the following decades, until 1989 when an AA [[Eastern League (U.S. baseball)|Eastern League]] affiliate of the [[Detroit Tigers]] was established by investors/ Board of Directors, President Dan Ross, Vice President Mike Tucker, Vice President and General Manager Bob Gilson, Vice President and Assistant General Manager General Manager Bill Wilkinson and Vice President Brian Costello.

Immediately prior to the London Tigers' inaugural season at Labatt Park in 1989, numerous improvements were completed at the park costing approximately $1-million for new lights, new dressing rooms and dug outs, additional seating, field and entrance upgrades, food concession enhancements and a new {{convert|40|ft|m|sing=on}}-by-19-foot electronic scoreboard (partially sponsored by [[Labatt Breweries]]). Previously, the scoreboard was changed manually. In 1990, Labatt Park and its head groundkeeper Mike Regan, won the prestigious "Beam Clay Award" as the best natural-grass field in North America.

Broadcasting the Tigers' games on TV London with veteran local sportscaster Pete James were former Tiger greats [[Mickey Lolich]] and later, [[Denny McLain]].

The 1990 [[London Tigers]] won the Eastern League title under manager [[Chris Chambliss]] (one of the Tigers' players was [[Travis Fryman]]), but the [[Tom Runnells]]-managed Tigers relocated to [[Trenton, New Jersey]] after the 1993 season, citing declining attendance.

On January 20, 1990, In [[Houston, Texas]], Labatt Park was named the "Beam Clay Baseball Diamond of the Year" for "excellence and professionalism in maintaining an outstanding professional baseball diamond"—due to the outstanding groundskeeping work of City of London employee/supervisor, Mike Regan and his assistant Rob Garrett.

The park was considered for the filming of the 1992 movie ''[[A League of Their Own]]'' starring [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Geena Davis]], but filming could not fit around the home schedule of the Double A [[London Tigers]] of the [[Eastern League (U.S. baseball)|Eastern League]].

The [[London Werewolves]] of the fledgling [[Frontier League]] played at the park from 1999 to 2001, winning the Frontier League championship in 1999; Werewolves pitcher Brett Gray tossed 25 strikeouts on June 3, 2000 (home opener), against the [[Chillicothe, Ohio|Chillicothe (Ohio)]] Paints. The game's scorecard and Brett Gray's jersey were donated to the [[Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame]] &amp; Museum in [[St. Marys, Ontario]], by Werewolves' General Manager John Kuhn.

In 2000, former MLB star [[Ron LeFlore]] was hired as the manager of the Cook County Cheetahs of the Frontier League, visiting Labatt Park several times during the season.

In 2001 after the ''circa''-1937 main grandstand was demolished and a new, $1.97-million, wheelchair-accessible main grandstand was built (the park's fourth) and a new "pop-up" underground irrigation system was installed, the park was used as the chief baseball venue for the [[Canada Summer Games]].

In 2003 the park was also home to the [[London Monarchs (baseball)|London Monarchs]] of the short-lived [[Canadian Baseball League]], which folded mid-season due to financial difficulties. The team's manager was former Major Leaguer [[Willie Wilson (baseball)|Willie Wilson]] and featured such stars as first-baseman [[Francisco Cabrera (baseball)|Francisco Cabrera]] and pitcher [[Amaury Telemaco]]. The league's inaugural game and homeopener for the London Monarchs was held at Labatt Park on May 21, 2003, and was televised nationally on The Score. It also featured a fly-over by the Canadian [[Snowbirds]] flying team. League Commissioner Fergie Jenkins was also in attendance.

==Beehive of activity==

Along with bicycle racing, Labatt Park has in the past been used for [[soccer]], [[fastball]], [[softball]], high-school and men's football, [[track and field]], [[wrestling]], [[boxing]], winter skating, political rallies, [[showjumping]], civic receptions, the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) [[Musical Ride]] and a [[21-gun salute]] to Her Majesty [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] during her visit to London's [[Victoria Park, London (Ontario)|Victoria Park]] on June 26, 1997.

Currently, the park is home to the [[London Majors]] of the [[Intercounty Baseball League|Intercounty League]] and the London Badgers junior team, as well as several other youth and adult baseball teams. The [[Western Ontario Mustangs|UWO Mustangs]] Baseball Club managed by former London Majors/AA London Tigers/AAA Toldedo Mud Hens pitcher Mike Lumley is using the park during the 2006 Ontario University Athletics (OUA) baseball season (in 2005, the Mustangs won the OUA baseball title at Labatt Park for the first time, beating [[Brock University]]) Badgers in the final best-of-three championship series. The Western Mustangs repeated as OUA champs in 2006, beating Brock two games to nothing (7-4, 5-0) at Labatt Park on October 21.

It should also be noted that Ted Giannoulas, aka "[[The Famous Chicken]]" sports mascot, was born and raised in London, Ontario, and during the years 1965 to 1967 worked part-time at Labatt Park during baseball games changing the old manual scoreboard in right field for 25 cents a game.

==Roy McKay Clubhouse, home to the London Majors==

In 1996, the "Reasons for Designation" for the park under the ''Ontario Heritage Act'' were amended to include the ''circa''-1937, tongue-and-groove clapboard clubhouse of the London Majors, renamed the "Roy McKay Clubhouse" on August 1, 1996 (McKay was born on August 1), by Majors' longtime player/owner Arden Eddie in honour of former pitcher, manager and coach [[Roy McKay]] who died on [[Christmas Day]] in 1995, six months after falling on the porch of his Waterloo Street home. Subsequently, a large commemorative rock and bronze plaque honouring Roy McKay, jersey #16, was installed at the front of the clubhouse.

&lt;div style="padding:6px; margin:6px; border:2px solid #0f0; background:#e4f2ff;"&gt;

''"I would like to be remembered for being a devoted son and brother, a loving husband, a great father and a damn good friend."''—Roy McKay, 1933–1995 &lt;/div&gt;

To help raise money for a new cedar-shingle roof on the historic clubhouse, a ballgame dubbed "The Rumble at the Riverforks" was played at the park on May 31, 1998, featuring members of London city council, members of the local media and the London Majors' oldtimers. The game was organized by The [[Friends of Labatt Park]], SCENE magazine and the London Majors.

On June 18, 2005, veteran Intercounty Baseball League umpire Joe Serratore was married to bride Bren Ferguson at home plate before 200 friends and family members, with United Church minister [[Reverend Susan Eagle]] (who, at the time, was a member of London city council) officiating. The home-plate wedding ceremony is believed to be a first for the ballpark.

== Labatt Park Reunion, 2005==

On Saturday, July 23, 2005, the City of London in conjunction with the London Sports Council, the London Sports Oldtimers Association, the London Majors Baseball Club and The Friends of Labatt Park, organized a special, day-long event at the park to commemorate the city's 150th anniversary as an incorporated municipality (more than 10,000 residents) and the park's 128-year-old history. The event featured an open baseball clinic for youngsters run by the London Majors, vintage ball games, displays of park/ baseball memorabilia and a Majors' oldtimers' reunion.

In 2006, London photo-historian Stephen Harding spent two days photographing the interior and exterior of the Roy McKay Clubhouse and presented his photos/ report to the City's heritage planner as City staff formulate plans to make additional repairs to the 70-year-old structure.

== Got Milk? commercials spoof MLB steroid use==

In late September 2005, the San Francisco advertising firm of Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners filmed a series of five, 30-second [[Got Milk?]] TV-commercials at Labatt Park, that subsequently ran during post-season play of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB), starting on October 11. The commercials, which spoofed the ongoing steroid scandal in MLB had players "caught" using a "performance-enhancing substance"—milk. The commercials were titled "Caught", "Batting Practice", "Tabloid", "Never Poured" and "Manager."  The commercial "Never Poured" was shortlisted at the 2006 [[Cannes Film Festival]]. From the get-go, MLB demanded that the commercials be taken off the air, but the popular commercials were subsequently re-released in December 2007 and ran through January 2008.

The humorous commercials continued to run during the [[2005 World Series]], won in 4 straight games by [[Chicago White Sox|Chicago]]. An on-line poll on a [[Houston, Texas]]-based Web site revealed that 75% of more than 23,000 poll respondents found the commercials to be funny and wanted them left on the air.

==Roadway Express's 2006–2007 baseball calendar==

Labatt Park is one of three featured baseball parks in the 16-month (September 2006 to December 2007) Roadway Express baseball calendar; Labatt Park is featured in the month of October 2007 "Times of Greatness" baseball calendar published by [[Roadway Express]], based in [[Akron, Ohio]]. The print run of the calendars is 150,000.

Roadway Express is also the sponsor of the "Times of Greatness" interactive, {{convert|53|ft|m|sing=on}}-long museum travelling coast to coast in the U.S. and Canada every year, showcasing Negro League history and artifacts. Roadway Express is also a sponsor of the [[Negro Leagues Baseball Museum]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]].

Bob Paige, a longtime driver for Roadway Express, is the son of Hall-of-Fame pitcher, [[Satchel Paige]], who made a much-publicized visit to Labatt Park on June 30, 1954.

==Baseball Day in London, 2006==

PHOTO: Stephen Harding.]] 
On July 1 ([[Canada Day]]), 2006, London held its second annual Baseball Day, organized by the City of London, The Friends of Labatt Park, [[Fanshawe Pioneer Village]], the London Majors Baseball Club, the London Oldtimers' Sports Association, the London and District Baseball Association and the London Sports Council.

The day featured an open, drop-in baseball clinic with the London Majors, historical displays in the Roy McKay Clubhouse, a 1923 [[Wurlitzer]] Military Band Organ (restored and owned and operated by Ken Vinen of [[Aylmer, Ontario]]), a vintage base ball game between Fanshawe Pioneer Village's London Tecumsehs and Bruce Huff's Thames River Ratz (the Ratz won 15-3), a pitch, hit and run competition and a doubleheader between the London Majors and the Toronto Maple Leafs of the Intercounty Baseball League (London won both games, 9-1 and 3-2). The scheduled [[fireworks]] (courtesy of the City of London) after the game over the adjacent riverforks were cancelled due to high winds. Instead, they were set off the following night on July 2.

'''Marker''' has been a manufacturer of [[alpine skiing|alpine]] [[ski bindings]] since 1952. Founded in Germany by '''Hannes Marker''', the company is known for pioneering releasable binding technology. Marker's first model, the Duplex was followed in 1953 by the Simplex toe binding which was a huge success in the 1950s. New models introduced in the 1980s were major competitors on the alpine racing circuit. Marker remained independent until the 1980s, since then the company ownership switched hands several times until becoming part of the [[K2 Sports]] group, which in turn was purchased by [[Jarden]] in 2007.

==History==

===Early models===
Until the 1950s the ski industry had not split into different disciplines and used the [[cable binding]] for all purposes. The "Kandahar" style binding added clips to hold down the foot for downhill runs, and then released for cross-country striding. These bindings had no release system, and could cause serious injuries during even the most minor falls. In the early 1960s, Dr. Richard Spademan had to deal with 150 fractures during a single three-day weekend at [[Squaw Valley Ski Resort]].{{sfn|Masia|2003|p=39}}

During the early 1950s a number of skiers introduced systems to help release the foot in the event of a fall. The most worrying injuries were spiral fractures caused when the ski was forced sideways and twisted the lower leg. In 1950 Look introduced the [[Look Nevada]] binding, which allowed the boot to release from the ski when it rotated to the sides. This was used with a conventional cable binding on the heel.

Hannes Marker felt he could improve on the concept, and in 1953 he introduced the "Duplex" toe. The Duplex used two small wedge-shaped metal clips that fit over the toe of the boot's sole, holding it down, and used a spring in order to keep the boot centred. During a fall, the clips could be forced outward against their centring springs, allowing it to release the toe. Like the Nevada, the Duplex used a cable binding for the heel.

In 1953, he followed this with the "Simplex" system, which used a single metal piece that could be rotated to either side on a cam plate that allowed the boot to travel directly to the side. This was paired with a new design for the heel cable, which formerly looped around the entire boot to a lever at the front that provided tension. Marker's "LD" replaced this with just the portion of the binding at the rear of the boot, moving the lever to the cable itself.

===Rotamat===
In 1962, Look dramatically updated their line with the Nevada II toe and the Grand Prix heel binding. The Grand Prix was essentially a toe binding rotated on its side so it released upward instead of to the side, allowing release when the ski caught or was forced up toward the skier. This basic design has remained the basis for downhill ski bindings to this day.

Marker followed Look's lead in 1965, retaining their existing Simplex toe and adding the "Rotamat" heel. The Rotamat placed a release mechanism like the Grand Prix on short cables that ran to the boot's instep. This allowed the boot to release in twisting forward falls, a feature that Look would soon copy in their "turntable" mechanisms. The Rotamat's heel clip could not be easily re-set if it opened, earning it the nickname "explodamat". Several variations of the Rotamat followed, introducing plastic housings for lower weight and other changes to the design.

===M series===
In 1972, Marker replaced the Rotamat with its first step-in design, the M4 toe and M44 heel. The M4 re-introduced a two-finger design, allowing the fingers to rotate outward. The M44 heel was relatively conventional, allowing release only directly up. This was replaced in 1979 with the M4-15 Rotamat S heel, which was an improved version of the original Rotamat that was simpler to reset after release. Like the Look designs, it included a turntable under the instep that allowed the boot to rotate to the sides.

A major upgrade was released in 1981 as the M40 Racing series. This is perhaps one of their best known bindings as it was a regular feature on the racing circuit through the 1980s. This featured an updated version of the M4 toe and an entirely new heel piece with a push-button release. Another major update followed in 1985 in the M46. This introduced the Twin-Cam toe and a Salomon-like lever-release heel. This basic design has remained the pattern for Marker bindings to this day.

===Modern designs===
In 2007, Marker unveiled a new freeski binding system called the Duke. Complemented by the Jester, the new system redefined the performance parameters for freeride bindings. In 2008, the company released two new bindings, the Baron and the Griffon, that are also based on the Duke system. In 2009, the company unveiled the Jester Schizo, which lets the user switch stances to adjust for a more "park" configuration (more towards the center of the ski) or for a more "all mountain" configuration (back from the core center of the ski). The Royal Family of bindings has become so popular that in 2007, the Duke was the subject of numerous internet scams stemming from people wishing to buy the binding.

Marker has since expanded into the outerwear industry with its Marker Ltd. Apparel line.

'''Old Trafford''' is a [[association football|football]] stadium in [[Old Trafford (district)|Old Trafford]], Greater Manchester, England, and the home of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. With a capacity of 74,994,&lt;ref name="premier_league" /&gt; it is the largest club football stadium (and second largest football stadium overall after [[Wembley Stadium]]) in the United Kingdom, and the eleventh-largest in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Manchester Sightseeing Bus Tours |url=http://www.manchesterbustours.co.uk/manchester-united |accessdate=15 July 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716025339/http://www.manchesterbustours.co.uk/manchester-united |archivedate=16 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is about {{convert|0.5|mi|m}} from [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground]] and the adjacent [[Old Trafford tram stop|tram stop]].

Nicknamed "The Theatre of Dreams" by [[Bobby Charlton]],&lt;ref&gt;Barnes et al., p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Old Trafford has been United's home ground since 1910, although from 1941 to 1949 the club shared [[Maine Road]] with local rivals [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] as a result of [[World War II|Second World War]] bomb damage. Old Trafford underwent several expansions in the 1990s, and 2000s, including the addition of extra tiers to the North, West and East Stands, almost returning the stadium to its original capacity of 80,000. Future expansion is likely to involve the addition of a second tier to the South Stand, which would raise the capacity to around 88,000. The stadium's record attendance was recorded in 1939, when 76,962 spectators watched the [[FA Cup]] semi-final between [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] and [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]].

Old Trafford has hosted [[FA Cup]] semi-finals, [[England national football team|England]] fixtures, matches at the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 96]] and the [[2003 UEFA Champions League Final|2003 Champions League Final]], as well as [[rugby league]]'s annual [[Super League Grand Final]] and the final of two [[Rugby League World Cup]]s. It also hosted football matches at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], including women's international football for the first time in its history.

== History ==

=== Construction and early years ===

Before 1902, Manchester United were known as Newton Heath, during which time they first played their football matches at [[North Road (football ground)|North Road]] and then [[Bank Street (football ground)|Bank Street]] in [[Clayton, Manchester|Clayton]]. However, both grounds were blighted by wretched conditions, the pitches ranging from gravel to marsh, while Bank Street suffered from clouds of fumes from its neighbouring factories.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, following the club's rescue from near-bankruptcy and renaming, the new chairman [[John Henry Davies]] decided in 1909 that the Bank Street ground was not fit for a team that had recently won the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] and [[FA Cup]], so he donated funds for the construction of a new stadium.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Not one to spend money frivolously, Davies scouted around Manchester for an appropriate site, before settling on a patch of land adjacent to the [[Bridgewater Canal]], just off the north end of the Warwick Road in [[Old Trafford (district)|Old Trafford]].&lt;ref name="mccartney_9"&gt;McCartney (1996), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Designed by Scottish architect [[Archibald Leitch]], who designed several other stadia, the ground was originally designed with a capacity of 100,000 spectators and featured seating in the south stand under cover, while the remaining three stands were left as terraces and uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;Inglis, pp. 234–235&lt;/ref&gt; Including the purchase of the land, the construction of the stadium was originally to have cost £60,000 all told. However, as costs began to rise, to reach the intended capacity would have cost an extra £30,000 over the original estimate and, at the suggestion of club secretary [[John Bentley (football manager)|J. J. Bentley]], the capacity was reduced to approximately 80,000.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCartney (1996), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, at a time when transfer fees were still around the £1,000 mark, the cost of construction only served to reinforce the club's "[[Money bag#Nickname|Moneybags]] United" epithet, with which they had been tarred since Davies had taken over as chairman.&lt;ref&gt;Inglis, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1908, Archibald Leitch wrote to the [[Cheshire Lines Committee]] (CLC) – who had a rail depot adjacent to the proposed site for the football ground – in an attempt to persuade them to subsidise construction of the grandstand alongside the railway line. The subsidy would have come to the sum of £10,000, to be paid back at the rate of £2,000 ''per annum'' for five years or half of the gate receipts for the grandstand each year until the loan was repaid. However, despite guarantees for the loan coming from the club itself and two local breweries, both chaired by club chairman John Henry Davies, the Cheshire Lines Committee turned the proposal down.&lt;ref&gt;McCartney (1996), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The CLC had planned to build a new station adjacent to the new stadium, with the promise of an anticipated £2,750 ''per annum'' in fares offsetting the £9,800 cost of building the station. The station – [[Trafford Park railway station|Trafford Park]] – was eventually built, but further down the line than originally planned.&lt;ref name="mccartney_9"/&gt; The CLC later constructed a modest station with one timber-built platform immediately adjacent to the stadium and this opened on 21 August 1935. It was initially named United Football Ground,&lt;ref&gt;Butt (1995), p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; but was renamed Old Trafford Football Ground in early 1936. It was served on match days only by a shuttle service of steam trains from [[Manchester Central railway station]].&lt;ref&gt;Butt, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently known as [[Manchester United Football Ground railway station|Manchester United Football Ground]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Manchester Utd Football Gd (MUF) |url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/muf/details.html |publisher=National Rail |accessdate=15 July 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727132532/http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/muf/details.html |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction was carried out by Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester&lt;ref name="encyclopaedia"&gt;Barnes et al., pp. 44–47, 52&lt;/ref&gt; and development was completed in late 1909. The stadium hosted its inaugural game on 19 February 1910, with United playing host to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. However, the home side were unable to provide their fans with a win to mark the occasion, as Liverpool won 4–3. A journalist at the game reported the stadium as "the most handsomest [sic], the most spacious and the most remarkable arena I have ever seen. As a football ground it is unrivalled in the world, it is an honour to Manchester and the home of a team who can do wonders when they are so disposed".&lt;ref&gt;White (2008), p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the construction of [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in 1923, the [[FA Cup Final]] was hosted by a number of different grounds around England including Old Trafford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/thefacup/more/finals |title=FA Cup Final Venues |accessdate=11 September 2016 |work=TheFA.com |publisher=The Football Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these was the [[1911 FA Cup Final]] replay between [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], after the original tie at [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre|Crystal Palace]] finished as a no-score draw after [[Overtime (sports)#Association football|extra time]]. Bradford won 1–0, the goal scored by [[Jimmy Speirs]], in a match watched by 58,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk/1911.html |title=1911 FA Cup Final |accessdate=4 September 2008 |publisher=fa-cupfinals.co.uk |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218064001/http://www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk/1911.html |archivedate=18 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ground's second FA Cup Final was the [[1915 FA Cup Final|1915 final]] between [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. Sheffield United won the match 3–0 in front of nearly 50,000&amp;nbsp;spectators, most of whom were in the military, leading to the final being nicknamed "the Khaki Cup Final".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk/1915.html |title=1915 FA Cup Final |accessdate=4 September 2008 |publisher=fa-cupfinals.co.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311060934/http://www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk/1915.html |archivedate=11 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 December 1920, Old Trafford played host to its largest pre-Second World War attendance for a United league match, as 70,504 spectators watched the Red Devils lose 3–1 to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The ground hosted its first international football match later that decade, when [[England national football team|England]] lost 1–0 to [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in front of 49,429&amp;nbsp;spectators on 17 April 1926.&lt;ref name="mccartney_17"&gt;McCartney (1996), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The OT Story: 1910–1930 |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Visit-Old-Trafford/Stadium-Centenary/OT-100-Story/The-OT-Story-1910-1930.aspx?pageNo=4 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=18 January 2010 |accessdate=15 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013184919/http://www.manutd.com/en/Visit-Old-Trafford/Stadium-Centenary/OT-100-Story/The-OT-Story-1910-1930.aspx?pageNo=4 |archivedate=13 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unusually, the record attendance at Old Trafford is not for a Manchester United home game.

=== Wartime bombing ===
In 1936, as part of a £35,000 refurbishment, an 80-yard-long roof was added to the United Road stand (now the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand) for the first time,&lt;ref name="inglis_235"&gt;Inglis, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; while roofs were added to the south corners in 1938.&lt;ref name="rivalry"&gt;Brandon, pp. 179–180&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], Old Trafford was requisitioned by the military to be used as a depot.&lt;ref name="mccartney_20"&gt;McCartney (1996), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Football continued to be played at the stadium, but a German bombing raid on Trafford Park on 22 December 1940 damaged the stadium to the extent that a Christmas day fixture against [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] had to be switched to Stockport's ground.&lt;ref name="mccartney_20"/&gt; Football resumed at Old Trafford on 8 March 1941, but another German raid on 11 March 1941 destroyed much of the stadium, notably the main stand (now the South Stand), forcing the club's operations to move to Cornbrook Cold Storage, owned by United chairman [[James W. Gibson]].&lt;ref name="mccartney_20"/&gt; After pressure from Gibson, the [[War Damage Commission]] granted Manchester United £4,800 to remove the debris and £17,478 to rebuild the stands.&lt;ref name="inglis_235"/&gt; During the reconstruction of the stadium, Manchester United played their "home" games at [[Maine Road]], the home of their cross-town rivals, [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], at a cost of £5,000 a year plus a percentage of the gate receipts.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; The club was now £15,000 in debt, not helped by the rental of Maine Road, and the Labour MP for Stoke, [[Ellis Smith]], petitioned the Government to increase the club's compensation package, but it was in vain.&lt;ref name="inglis_235"/&gt; Though Old Trafford was reopened, albeit without cover, in 1949, it meant that a league game had not been played at the stadium for nearly 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Philip |title=How Matt Busby arrived at Manchester United |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2290610/How-Matt-Busby-arrived-at-Manchester-United.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |date=1 February 2008 |accessdate=21 August 2008 |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015045004/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2290610/How-Matt-Busby-arrived-at-Manchester-United.html |archivedate=15 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; United's first game back at Old Trafford was played on 24 August 1949, as 41,748&amp;nbsp;spectators witnessed a 3–0 victory over [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].&lt;ref&gt;White (2008), p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Completion of the master plan ===
A roof was restored to the Main Stand by 1951 and, soon after, the three remaining stands were covered, the operation culminating with the addition of a roof to the [[Stretford End]] (now the West Stand) in 1959.&lt;ref name="rivalry"/&gt; The club also invested £40,000 in the installation of proper [[floodlights (sport)|floodlighting]], so that they would be able to use the stadium for the European games that were played in the late evening of weekdays, instead of having to play at Maine Road. In order to avoid obtrusive shadows being cast on the pitch, two sections of the Main Stand roof were cut away.&lt;ref name="inglis_235"/&gt; The first match to be played under floodlights at Old Trafford was a First Division match between Manchester United and Bolton Wanderers on 25 March 1957.&lt;ref name="encyclopaedia"/&gt;

However, although the spectators would now be able to see the players at night, they still suffered from the problem of obstructed views caused by the pillars that supported the roofs. With the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]] fast approaching, this prompted the United directors to completely redesign the United Road (north) stand. The old roof pillars were replaced in 1965 with modern-style cantilevering on top of the roof, allowing every spectator a completely unobstructed view,&lt;ref name="rivalry"/&gt; while it was also expanded to hold 20,000 spectators (10,000 seated and 10,000 standing in front) at a cost of £350,000.&lt;ref name="inglis_236"&gt;Inglis, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; The architects of the new stand, Mather and Nutter (now Atherden Fuller),&lt;ref name="encyclopaedia"/&gt; rearranged the organisation of the stand to have terracing at the front, a larger seated area towards the back, and the first [[luxury box|private boxes]] at a British football ground. The east stand – the only remaining uncovered stand – was developed in the same style in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Inglis, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; With the first two stands converted to cantilevers, the club's owners devised a long-term plan to do the same to the other two stands and convert the stadium into a bowl-like arena.&lt;ref name="manutdzone"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manutdzone.com/oldtrafford/oldtrafford.htm |title=Old Trafford 1909–2006 |accessdate=11 December 2011 |publisher=manutdzone.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217222825/http://www.manutdzone.com/oldtrafford/oldtrafford.htm |archivedate=17 February 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an undertaking would serve to increase the atmosphere within the ground by containing the crowd's noise and focusing it onto the pitch, where the players would feel the full effects of a capacity crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Hibbs |title=OT atmosphere excites Ole |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2006/Aug/OT-atmosphere-excites-Ole.aspx |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=15 August 2006 |accessdate=26 January 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002143817/http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2006/Aug/OT-atmosphere-excites-Ole.aspx |archivedate=2 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the stadium hosted its third FA Cup Final, hosting 62,078 spectators for the replay of the [[1970 FA Cup Final|1970 final]] between Chelsea and [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]]; Chelsea won the match 2–1. The ground also hosted the second leg of the [[1968 Intercontinental Cup]], which saw [[Estudiantes de La Plata]] win the cup after a 1–1 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Martin |last=Macchiavello |title=Nostalgia Alá vista |url=http://edant.ole.com.ar/notas/2009/12/18/futbolinternacional/02103612.html |publisher=[[Olé (sports newspaper)|Olé]] |date=18 December 2009 |accessdate=18 July 2010 |language=Spanish |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302232407/http://edant.ole.com.ar/notas/2009/12/18/futbolinternacional/02103612.html |archivedate=2 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1970s saw the dramatic rise of football hooliganism in Britain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liv.ac.uk/footballindustry/hooligan.html |title=University of Liverpool FIG Factsheet – Hooliganism |accessdate=4 September 2008 |last=Pearson |first=Geoff |date=December 2007 |work=Football Industry Group |publisher=University of Liverpool |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913004141/http://www.liv.ac.uk/footballindustry/hooligan.html |archivedate=13 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a knife-throwing incident in 1971 forced the club to erect the country's first perimeter fence, restricting fans from the Old Trafford pitch.&lt;ref name="inglis_236"/&gt;

1973 saw the completion of the roof around the circumference of the stadium, along with the addition of 5,500 seats to the Scoreboard End and the replacement of the old manual scoreboard with an electronic one in the north-east corner. Then, in 1975, a £3&amp;nbsp;million expansion was begun, starting with the addition of the Executive Suite to the Main Stand. The suite's restaurant overlooked the pitch, but the view was still obstructed by the roof pillars. Therefore, in kind with the roofs of the United Road Stand and the Scoreboard End, the Main Stand roof was replaced with a cantilever design. The Executive Suite and cantilever roof were then extended to the full length of the stand, allowing for the relocation of the club offices from the south-east corner to the Main Stand. The south-east quadrant was then removed and replaced in 1985 with a seated section bringing the total [[seating capacity]] of the stadium to 25,686 (56,385 overall). The completion of the cantilever roof around three sides of the stadium allowed for the replacement of the old floodlight pylons, and the attachment of a row of floodlights around the inner rim of the roof in 1987.

=== Conversion to all-seater ===
[[File:Stretford end 1992.JPG|thumb|The Stretford End before its redevelopment in the early 1990s]]
With every subsequent improvement made to the ground since the Second World War, the capacity steadily declined. By the 1980s, the capacity had dropped from the original 80,000 to approximately 60,000. The capacity dropped still further in 1990, when the [[Taylor Report]] recommended, and the government demanded that all First and Second Division stadia be converted to [[all-seater stadium|all-seaters]]. This meant that £3–5&amp;nbsp;million plans to replace the Stretford End with a brand new stand with an all-standing terrace at the front and a cantilever roof to link with the rest of the ground had to be drastically altered.&lt;ref name="encyclopaedia"/&gt; This forced redevelopment, including the removal of the terraces at the front of the other three stands, not only increased the cost to around £10&amp;nbsp;million, but also reduced the capacity of Old Trafford to an all-time low of around 44,000.&lt;ref name="inglis_238"&gt;Inglis, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the club was told in 1992 that they would only receive £1.4&amp;nbsp;million of a possible £2&amp;nbsp;million from the Football Trust to be put towards work related to the Taylor Report.&lt;ref&gt;Inglis, pp. 238–239&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Old trafford february 2010.jpg|thumb|left|The redeveloped East Stand was opened at the beginning of the 2000–01 season.]]
The club's resurgence in success and increase in popularity in the early 1990s ensured that further development would have to occur. In 1995, the 30-year-old North Stand was demolished and work quickly began on a new stand,&lt;ref&gt;James, pp. 405–6&lt;/ref&gt; to be ready in time for Old Trafford to host three group games, a quarter-final and a semi-final at [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 96]]. The club purchased the Trafford Park trading estate, a {{convert|20|acre|m2|adj=on}} site on the other site of United Road, for £9.2&amp;nbsp;million in March 1995. Construction began in June 1995 and was completed by May 1996, with the first two of the three phases of the stand opening during the season. Designed by Atherden Fuller, with Hilstone Laurie as project and construction managers and Campbell Reith Hill as structural engineers, the new three-tiered stand cost a total of £18.65&amp;nbsp;million to build and had a capacity of about 25,500, raising the capacity of the entire ground to more than 55,000. The cantilever roof would also be the largest in Europe, measuring {{convert|58.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the back wall to the front edge.&lt;ref name="inglis_239"&gt;Inglis, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; Further success over the next few years guaranteed yet more development. First, a second tier was added to the East Stand. Opened in January 2000, the stadium's capacity was temporarily increased to about 61,000 until the opening of the West Stand's second tier, which added yet another 7,000&amp;nbsp;seats, bringing the capacity to 68,217. It was now not only the biggest club stadium in England but the biggest in all of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waterscape.com/in-your-area/lancashire/places-to-go/357/old-trafford |title=Old Trafford |accessdate=21 August 2008 |publisher=waterscape.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Old Trafford hosted its first major European final three years later, playing host to the [[2003 UEFA Champions League Final]] between [[A.C.

From 2001 to 2007, following the demolition of the old Wembley Stadium, the [[England national football team]] was forced to play its games elsewhere. During that time, the team toured the country, playing their matches at various grounds from [[Villa Park]] in Birmingham to [[St James' Park]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]. From 2003 to 2007, Old Trafford hosted 12 of England's 23&amp;nbsp;home&amp;nbsp;matches, more than any other stadium.

=== 2006 expansion ===
[[File:Old Trafford model.jpg|thumb|Peter Oldfield-Edwards' scale model of Old Trafford on display in the club museum in March 2010]]
Old Trafford's most recent expansion, which took place between July 2005 and May 2006, saw an increase of around 8,000 seats with the addition of second tiers to both the north-west and north-east quadrants of the ground.&lt;ref name="manutdzone"/&gt; Part of the new seating was used for the first time on 26 March 2006, when an attendance of 69,070 became a new [[Premier League]] record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Man Utd 3–0 Birmingham |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/4820120.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=26 March 2006 |accessdate=29 January 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120125023/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/4820120.stm |archivedate=20 November 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The record continued to be pushed upwards before reaching its current peak on 31 March 2007, when 76,098 spectators saw United beat [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] 4–1, meaning that just 114 seats (0.15% of the total capacity of 76,212) were left unoccupied.&lt;ref name="united4_blackburn1"&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Coppack |title=Report: United 4 Blackburn 1 |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Fixtures-And-Results/Match-Reports/2007/Mar/Report-United-4-Blackburn-1.aspx |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=31 March 2007 |accessdate=26 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216043425/http://www.manutd.com/en/Fixtures-And-Results/Match-Reports/2007/Mar/Report-United-4-Blackburn-1.aspx |archivedate=16 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a reorganisation of the seating in the stadium resulted in a reduction of the capacity by 255 to 75,957, meaning that the club's home attendance record would stand at least until the next expansion.&lt;ref name="inside_united"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morgan |first=Steve |editor1-first=Ian |editor1-last=McLeish |date=March 2010 |title=Design for life |journal=Inside United |issue=212 |pages=44–48 |publisher=Haymarket Network |issn=1749-6497 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="record_gate"&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Bartram |title=OT100 #9: Record gate |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/The-OT-100-News/2009/Nov/OT100-9-Record-gate.aspx |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=19 November 2009 |accessdate=19 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216030119/http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/The-OT-100-News/2009/Nov/OT100-9-Record-gate.aspx |archivedate=16 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and facilities ==
[[File:OldTraffordPlan-en.svg|thumb|A plan of the layout of Old Trafford. The shaded area indicates the section designated for away fans.]]
The Old Trafford pitch is surrounded by four covered all-seater stands, officially known as the Sir Alex Ferguson (North), East, Sir Bobby Charlton (South) and West Stands. Each stand has at least two tiers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Tickets-And-Hospitality/Seating-Plan.aspx |title=Seating Plan |accessdate=26 January 2011 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228083520/http://www.manutd.com/en/Tickets-And-Hospitality/Seating-Plan.aspx |archivedate=28 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the exception of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, which only has one tier due to construction restrictions. The lower tier of each stand is split into Lower and Upper sections, the Lower sections having been converted from terracing in the early 1990s.

=== Sir Alex Ferguson Stand ===
[[File:Old Trafford inside 20060726 1.jpg|thumb|left|The Sir Alex Ferguson Stand (North Stand) seen from the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand (South Stand)]]
The Sir Alex Ferguson Stand, formerly known as the United Road stand and the North Stand, runs over the top of United Road. The stand is three tiers tall, and can hold about 26,000 spectators, the most of the four stands. It can also accommodate a few fans in executive boxes and hospitality suites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Executive Club |url=http://www.executiveclub.manutd.com/ |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |accessdate=1 August 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814175027/http://www.executiveclub.manutd.com/ |archivedate=14 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened in its current state in 1996, having previously been a single-tiered stand. As the ground's main stand, it houses many of the ground's more popular facilities, including the Red Café (a Manchester United theme restaurant/bar) and the Manchester United museum and trophy room. Originally opened in 1986 as the first of its kind in the world,&lt;ref&gt;Inglis, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; the Manchester United museum was in the south-east corner of the ground until it moved to the redeveloped North Stand in 1998. The museum was opened by [[Pelé]] on 11 April 1998, since when numbers of visitors have jumped from 192,000 in 1998 to more than 300,000&amp;nbsp;visitors in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Visit-Old-Trafford/Virtual-Tour.aspx?section={9C9F8161-326A-40F0-8EB0-085348EEDCFC} |title=Virtual Tour – The Museum |accessdate=26 January 2011 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125171433/http://www.manutd.com/en/Visit-Old-Trafford/Virtual-Tour.aspx?section=%7B9C9F8161-326A-40F0-8EB0-085348EEDCFC%7D |archivedate=25 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Bartram |title=OT100 #66: Pele's visit |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/The-OT-100-News/2010/Jan/OT100-66-Peles-visit.aspx |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=14 January 2010 |accessdate=26 January 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003174455/http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/The-OT-100-News/2010/Jan/OT100-66-Peles-visit.aspx |archivedate=3 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sir Alex Ferguson statue at Old Trafford.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A bronze statue of a man wearing a coat with his arms folded.|A statue of Sir Alex Ferguson was installed at Old Trafford on 23 November 2012.]]
The North Stand was renamed as the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand on 5 November 2011, in honour of [[Alex Ferguson]]'s 25 years as manager of the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Man Utd rename Old Trafford stand in Ferguson's honour |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/15607907.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=5 November 2011 |accessdate=5 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=on}} statue of Ferguson, sculpted by [[Philip Jackson (sculptor)|Philip Jackson]], was erected outside the stand on 23 November 2012 in recognition of his status as Manchester United's longest-serving manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sir Alex Ferguson pride as Manchester United unveil statue |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20468104 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=23 November 2012 |accessdate=23 November 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124214842/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20468104 |archivedate=24 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sir Bobby Charlton Stand ===
Opposite the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand is the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, formerly Old Trafford's main stand and previously known as the South Stand. Although only a single-tiered stand, the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand contains most of the ground's executive suites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Conferences-And-Events/The-Suites.aspx |title=The Suites |accessdate=26 January 2011 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203051517/http://www.manutd.com/en/Conferences-And-Events/The-Suites.aspx |archivedate=3 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also plays host to any VIPs who may come to watch the match. Members of the media are seated in the middle of the Upper South Stand to give them the best view of the match. The television gantry is also in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, so the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand is the one that gets shown on television least often.&lt;ref name="rivalry"/&gt; Television studios are located at either end of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, with the club's in-house television station, [[MUTV (Manchester United F.C.)|MUTV]], in the East studio and other television stations, such as the [[BBC]] and [[BSkyB|Sky]], in the West studio.

The dugout is in the centre of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, raised above pitch level to give the manager and his coaches an elevated view of the game. Each team's dugout flanks the old players' tunnel, which was used until 1993. The old tunnel is the only remaining part of the original 1910 stadium, having survived the bombing that destroyed much of the stadium during the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Visit-Old-Trafford/Virtual-Tour.aspx?section={0341FBBA-96FA-42BB-896B-0D15ABAFA643} |title=Virtual Tour – Dugout |accessdate=7 February 2008 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210194159/http://www.manutd.com/en/Visit-Old-Trafford/Virtual-Tour.aspx?section=%7B0341FBBA-96FA-42BB-896B-0D15ABAFA643%7D |archivedate=10 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 February 2008, the tunnel was renamed the Munich Tunnel, as a memorial for the 50th anniversary of the 1958 [[Munich air disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Football honours Munich victims |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7228670.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=6 February 2008 |accessdate=7 February 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208215806/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7228670.stm |archivedate=8 February 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current tunnel is in the South-West corner of the ground, and doubles as an entrance for the emergency services. In the event that large vehicles require access, the seating above the tunnel can be raised by up to {{convert|25|ft|m|1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Visit-Old-Trafford/Virtual-Tour.aspx?section={B0531F7F-9461-406D-81A9-ACA2AF687CC9} |title=Virtual Tour – Player's Tunnel |accessdate=7 February 2008 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210194219/http://www.manutd.com/en/Visit-Old-Trafford/Virtual-Tour.aspx?section=%7BB0531F7F-9461-406D-81A9-ACA2AF687CC9%7D |archivedate=10 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tunnel leads up to the players' dressing room, via the television interview area, and the players' lounge. Both the home and away dressing rooms were re-furbished for the [[2018–19 Premier League|2018–19]] season, with the corridor leading to the two widened and separated to keep home and away teams apart&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2018/08/28/old-trafford-dressing-room-layout-changed-avoid-repeat-manchester/|title=Old Trafford dressing-room layout changed to avoid repeat of Manchester derby tunnel fracas|last=Wallace|first=Sam|date=2018-08-28|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

On 3 April 2016, the South Stand was renamed the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand before kick-off of the Premier League home match against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], in honour of Manchester United legend [[Bobby Charlton|Sir Bobby Charlton]] who made his Manchester United debut 60 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-35953846 | title=Sir Bobby Charlton stand unveiled at Old Trafford | publisher=BBC | date=3 April 2016 | accessdate=3 April 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404015116/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-35953846 | archivedate=4 April 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Club-News/2016/Feb/South-Stand-at-Old-Trafford-renamed-Sir-Bobby-Charlton-Stand.aspx | title=South Stand at Old Trafford to be renamed after Sir Bobby Charlton | publisher=Manchester United | work=ManUtd.com | date=15 February 2016 | accessdate=3 April 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322034948/http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Club-News/2016/Feb/South-Stand-at-Old-Trafford-renamed-Sir-Bobby-Charlton-Stand.aspx | archivedate=22 March 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== West Stand ===
{{see also|Stretford End}}
[[File:Stretford End.jpg|thumb|The West Stand, with its mosaic of seats displaying the stand's colloquial name]]
Perhaps the best-known stand at Old Trafford is the West Stand, also known as the [[Stretford End]]. Traditionally, the stand is where the hard-core United fans are located, and also the ones who make the most noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Glenn |last=Moore |title=Football: You only sing when you're standing |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-you-only-sing-when-youre-standing-1353185.html |publisher=Independent, The |location=London |date=19 November 1996 |accessdate=22 August 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111161044/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-you-only-sing-when-youre-standing-1353185.html |archivedate=11 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally designed to hold 20,000&amp;nbsp;fans, the Stretford End was the last stand to be covered and also the last remaining all-terraced stand at the ground before the forced upgrade to seating in the early 1990s. The reconstruction of the Stretford End, which took place during the [[1992–93 in English football|1992–93 season]], was carried out by [[Alfred McAlpine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Alfred McAlpine wins £7.2m contract to redevelop Stretford End at Manchester United FC's stadium |url=http://www.cnplus.co.uk/News/1992/05/28may92_uk_alfred_mcalpine_wins_72m_contract_to_redevelop_stretford_end_at_manchester_united_fcs_stadium.html |publisher=The Construction News |date=28 May 1992 |accessdate=21 August 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218064125/http://www.cnplus.co.uk/News/1992/05/28may92_uk_alfred_mcalpine_wins_72m_contract_to_redevelop_stretford_end_at_manchester_united_fcs_stadium.html |archivedate=18 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the second tier was added to the Stretford End in 2000, many fans from the old "K Stand" moved there, and decided to hang banners and flags from the barrier at the front of the tier. So ingrained in Manchester United culture is the Stretford End, that [[Denis Law]] was given the nickname "King of the Stretford End", and there is now a statue of Law on the concourse of the stand's upper tier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Denis Law |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/Legends/Denis-Law.aspx |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |accessdate=29 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228095205/http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/Legends/Denis-Law.aspx |archivedate=28 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== East Stand ===
[[File:MunichMemorialPlaqueeditJM.jpg|thumb|left|A plaque at Old Trafford honouring the victims of the [[Munich air disaster]]]]
The East Stand at Old Trafford was the second to be converted to a cantilever roof, following the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand. It is also commonly referred to as the Scoreboard End, as it was the location of the scoreboard. The East Stand can currently hold nearly 12,000&amp;nbsp;fans,&lt;ref name="manutdzone"/&gt; and is the location of both the disabled fans section and the away section; an experiment involving the relocation of away fans to the third tier of the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand was conducted during the 2011–12 season, but the results of the experiments could not be ascertained in time to make the move permanent for the 2012–13 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Away fans won't move |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Club-News/2012/May/away-fans-relocation-on-hold.aspx |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=22 May 2012 |accessdate=22 May 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525215719/http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Club-News/2012/May/away-fans-relocation-on-hold.aspx |archivedate=25 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The disabled section provides for up to 170 fans, with free seats for carers. Old Trafford was formerly divided into sections, with each section sequentially assigned a letter of the alphabet. Although every section had a letter, it is the K Stand that is the most commonly referred to today. The K Stand fans were renowned for their vocal support for the club, and a large array of chants and songs, though many of them have relocated to the second tier of the West Stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Glenn |last=Moore |title=Football: You only sing when you're standing |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-you-only-sing-when-youre-standing-1353185.html |work=The Independent |publisher=Independent Print |location=London |date=19 November 1996 |accessdate=8 February 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111161044/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-you-only-sing-when-youre-standing-1353185.html |archivedate=11 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The East Stand has a tinted glass façade, behind which the club's administrative centre is located. These offices are the home to the staff of Inside United, the official Manchester United magazine, the club's official website, and its other administrative departments.

The Manchester United club shop has had six different locations since it was first opened. Originally, the shop was a small hut near to the railway line that runs alongside the ground. The shop was then moved along the length of the South Stand, stopping first opposite where away fans enter the ground, and then residing in the building that would later become the club's merchandising office. A surge in the club's popularity in the early 1990s led to another move, this time to the forecourt of the West Stand. With this move came a great expansion and the conversion from a small shop to a "megastore". Alex Ferguson opened the new megastore on 3 December 1994.&lt;ref&gt;White (2008), p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent moves came in the late 1990s, as the West Stand required room to expand to a second tier, and that meant the demolition of the megastore. The store was moved to a temporary site opposite the East Stand, before taking up a {{convert|17000|sqft|m2}} permanent residence in the ground floor of the expanded East Stand in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Mitten, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; The floor space of the megastore was owned by United's kit sponsors, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], who operated the store until the expiry of their sponsorship deal at the end of July 2015, when ownership reverted to the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Keegan |title=Manchester United will rake in £750m from the new adidas deal... so here, Sportmail looks at what went on behind the scenes as their 13-year relationship with Nike ended |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3171849/Manchester-United-rake-750m-new-adidas-deal-Sportmail-looks-went-scenes-13-year-relationship-Nike-ended.html |work=Mail Online |publisher=Associated Newspapers |date=23 July 2015 |accessdate=6 August 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801090603/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3171849/Manchester-United-rake-750m-new-adidas-deal-Sportmail-looks-went-scenes-13-year-relationship-Nike-ended.html |archivedate=1 August 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1980s, when Manchester United Football Club owned the [[Manchester Giants]], Manchester's basketball franchise, there were plans to build a 9,000-seater indoor arena on the site of what is now Car Park E1. However, the chairman at the time, [[Martin Edwards]], did not have the funds to take on such a project, and the basketball franchise was eventually sold.&lt;ref&gt;Mitten, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2009, the car park became home to the [[Hublot]] clock tower, a {{convert|10|m|ftin|adj=on}}-tall tower in the shape of the Hublot logo, which houses four {{convert|2|m|ftin|adj=on}}-diameter clock faces, the largest ever made by the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hublot clock unveiled |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Club-News/2009/Aug/Hublot-clock-unveiled.aspx |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=28 August 2009 |accessdate=26 January 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003180702/http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Club-News/2009/Aug/Hublot-clock-unveiled.aspx |archivedate=3 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The east side of the stadium is also the site of [[Hotel Football]], a football-themed hotel and fan clubhouse conceived by former Manchester United captain [[Gary Neville]]. The building is located on the east side of Sir Matt Busby Way and on the opposite side of the [[Bridgewater Canal]] from the stadium, and can accommodate up to 1,500 supporters. It opened in the summer of 2015. The venture is conducted separately from the club and was funded in part by proceeds from Neville's testimonial match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Gemma |last=Thompson |title=Neville launches fans' HQ |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Club-News/2011/May/Nevilles-supporters-club-vision.aspx |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=17 May 2011 |accessdate=11 July 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712203325/http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Club-News/2011/May/Nevilles-supporters-club-vision.aspx |archivedate=12 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future ==
In 2009, it was reported that United continued to harbour plans to increase the capacity of the stadium further, with the next stage pointing to a redevelopment of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, which, unlike the rest of the stadium, remains single tier. A replication of the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand development and North-East and North-West Quadrants would see the stadium's capacity rise to an estimated 95,000, which would give it a greater capacity than [[Wembley Stadium]] (90,000).&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester United set to make Old Trafford bigger than Wembley |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/manutd/5276996/Manchester-United-set-to-make-Old-Trafford-bigger-than-Wembley.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |date=5 May 2009 |accessdate=5 May 2009 |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509083613/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/manutd/5276996/Manchester-United-set-to-make-Old-Trafford-bigger-than-Wembley.html |archivedate=9 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Any such development is likely to cost around £100&amp;nbsp;million, due to the proximity of the railway line that runs adjacent to the stadium, and the corresponding need to build over it and thus purchase up to 50 houses on the other side of the railway.&lt;ref name="manutdzone"/&gt; Nevertheless, the Manchester United group property manager confirmed that expansion plans are in the pipeline – linked to profits made from the club's property holdings around Manchester – saying "There is a strategic plan for the stadium&amp;nbsp;... It is not our intention to stand still".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Watch out Wembley: Manchester United chiefs plan to dwarf National Stadium with 95,000 expansion of Old Trafford |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1177346/United-chiefs-plan-dwarf-Wembley-95-000-expansion-Old-Trafford.html |work=Daily Mail |publisher=Associated Newspapers |date=5 May 2009 |accessdate=5 May 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730113622/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1177346/United-chiefs-plan-dwarf-Wembley-95-000-expansion-Old-Trafford.html |archivedate=30 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One criticism of the plans, however, is that increasing the height of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand would further reduce the amount of light coming onto the pitch, which has caused problems in similarly large stadia – such as [[Wembley Stadium]], the [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium]] and the [[San Siro]]; according to [[Alex Ferguson]], the developments on the other stands have already caused problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fergie wants 'awful' Old Trafford pitch dug and relaid in time for Manchester derby |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-511255/Fergie-wants-awful-Old-Trafford-pitch-dug-relaid-time-Manchester-derby.html |work=Daily Mail |publisher=Associated Newspapers |date=30 January 2008 |accessdate=17 May 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120723104136/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-511255/Fergie-wants-awful-Old-Trafford-pitch-dug-relaid-time-Manchester-derby.html |archivedate=23 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also suggested that, should such an expansion take place, Old Trafford could be used instead of Wembley for big matches such as [[England national football team|England]] internationals – in order to increase the ability of fans in the north of the country to watch England play; and [[FA Cup]] semi-finals – to maintain the prestige of the national stadium for the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Hatchet Man |title=Bigger than Wembley and more convenient – why a revamped Old Trafford must stage the top games |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1177537/HATCHET-MAN-Bigger-Wembley-convenient--revamped-Old-Trafford-stage-games.html |work=Daily Mail |publisher=Associated Newspapers |date=5 May 2009 |accessdate=5 May 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120724145855/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1177537/HATCHET-MAN-Bigger-Wembley-convenient--revamped-Old-Trafford-stage-games.html |archivedate=24 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016 (ten years after the previous redevelopment), talk of the redevelopment of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand re-emerged. The stadium's provision for disabled fans is below standards required by regulations. Increasing capacity for disabled supporters is estimated to reduced overall capacity by 2,300. Five different solutions have been considered for the summer of 2017. One option is to increase the capacity up to 80,000 by adding a second tier to the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, bringing it to a similar height to the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand opposite but without a third level. Replication of the corner stands on the other side of the stadium would further increase the stadium's capacity to 88,000 and increase the number of executive facilities. Housing on Railway Road and the railway line itself have previously impeded improvements to this stand but the demolition of housing and engineering advances mean that the additional tier could now be built at reduced cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mitten |first=Andy |title=Manchester United consider expanding Old Trafford capacity to hold 80,000 |url=http://www.espnfc.co.uk/club/manchester-united/360/blog/post/2838728/manchester-united-consider-expanding-old-trafford-capacity |work=[[ESPN FC]] |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=28 March 2016 |accessdate=24 April 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503123425/http://www.espnfc.co.uk/club/manchester-united/360/blog/post/2838728/manchester-united-consider-expanding-old-trafford-capacity |archivedate=3 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WikipediaHangmotor.jpg|300px|thumb|A foot-launched powered hang glider]]

A '''foot-launched powered hang glider''' ('''FLPHG'''), also called powered harness, [[nanolight]], or hangmotor, is a powered [[hang gliding|hang glider]] harness with a [[internal combustion engine|motor]] and [[propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] in [[pusher configuration]]. An ordinary [[hang glider]] is used for its [[wing]] and control frame, and the pilot can foot-launch from a hill or from flat ground, needing a length of about a football field to get airborne, or much less if there is an oncoming breeze and no obstacles.

== History ==
{{main|History of hang gliding}}

=== Adding propulsion ===

While powered [[microlight]]s (ultralights) developed from hang gliding in the late 1970s, they were also a return to the type of low-speed aircraft that were common in the earlier years of aviation, but which were superseded as both civil and military aircraft pursued more speed.&lt;ref&gt;In 1898 [[Augustus Moore Herring]] adapted a compressed air engine to a weight-shift biplane. Images: [http://www.flyingmachines.org/hrrg.html]&lt;/ref&gt; For a second time in aviation history, during the 1970s, motorization of simple gliders, especially those portable and foot-launched, became the goal of many inventors and gradually, small wing-mounted power packs were adapted. These early experiments went largely unrecorded, even in log books, let alone the [[publishing|press]], because the pioneers were uncomfortably aware that the addition of an engine made the craft liable to registration, airworthiness legislation, and the pilot liable to expensive licensing and probably, insurance. Inventors from [[Australia]], [[France]] and [[England]] produced several successful microlight [[motor glider]]s in the early 1970s &lt;ref name="orange1"&gt;[http://perso.orange.fr/pulma1/Un%20peu%20d'histoire.htm French aviation historians on FLPHG]&lt;/ref&gt; and very few were portable wings.

====Don Mitchell====
Surprisingly, what really launched the powered [[ultralight aviation]] movement in the United States was not the [[Rogallo wing|Rogallo flexible wing]] but a whole series of rigid-wing motorized hang gliders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmaa.org/histdets.asp?HistoryID=4 British Microlight Aircraft Association, History of Microlighting] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203230257/http://www.bmaa.org/histdets.asp?HistoryID=4 |date=February 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Taras Kiceniuk Jr.#Kiceniuk Icarus V|Icarus V]] flying wing appeared with its tip rudders and swept-back style wing was used as a base for some powered experiments.  Differently, a rigid biplane designed also by teenager [[Taras Kiceniuk Jr.]], the [[Taras Kiceniuk Jr.#Kiceniuk Icarus II|Icarus II]] was a foundation for a modification in Larry Mauro's [[UFM Easy Riser]] biplane&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delta-club-82.com/bible/701-hang-glider-easy-riser.htm Hang glider : EASY RISER (Larry Mauro)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; that started to sell in large numbers; Larry Mauro would power his tail-less biplane; one version was solar powered, called the [[Solar Riser]].  Hang gliding record holder [[Don Mitchell (aircraft designer)|Don Mitchell]]&lt;ref&gt;In April 1946 Mitchell completed construction of his 'Flying Wing' (not the ''Mitchell Wing'' hang glider which was developed in 1975). The American [[FAA]] issued an Experimental Airworthiness number for it. The wing was flown as a glider by Mitchell, Bolwus and Paul Tuntland. Then Mitchell mounted a Nelson 2-cycle engine on it and flew it as a powered glider with wheels for landing gear.[http://home.earthlink.net/~mitchellwing/mitchell.html]&lt;/ref&gt; fitted his [[Mitchell Wing B-10]] with a motor,&lt;ref&gt;In the early 1940s Don Mitchell first became involved with flying wing glider design and construction. But [[World War II]] interrupted his research and experiments. Then in 1974, with the advent of hang glider mania, the Mitchell Wing resurfaced. It was at that time Dr. Howard Long took an interest in the half-forgotten project and asked Mitchell to make him a flying wing hang glider. The result was the foot-launched Mitchell Wing, controllable by a 'joystick'. The Mitchell Wing astounded the world of hang gliding. George Worthington, holder of eight world records in hang gliding and author of the book ''In Search of World Records'', wrote in the book..."I predict that the Mitchell Wing will be the highest performance foot-launched hang glider we'll see for a long time." He was right, and it was from this preliminary design that Mitchell developed his later powered models: The [[Mitchell Wing B-10]] and [[Mitchell U-2 Superwing]].&lt;/ref&gt; though the pilot still had to use their legs as undercarriage, an arrangement which persisted until he designed the B-10 Mitchell Wing.&lt;ref&gt;Don Mitchell - U.S. Pacific [http://home.earthlink.net/~mitchellwing/mitchell.html], B-10 Photos: [http://home.earthlink.net/~mitchellwing/b10pics.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Barry Palmer====
{{main|Barry Hill Palmer}}
In 1963 and during his free time, aeronautical engineer [[Barry Hill Palmer|Barry Palmer]] built and experimented with a foot-launched powered hang glider at [[Bloomfield, Connecticut]]. It was powered by a {{Convert|7|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[West Bend Company|West Bend]] engine and mounted on top of a Rogallo-type flexible wing hang glider; the propeller was {{convert|3|ft|m|0}} in diameter and was made of [[balsa]] wood, covered with [[fiberglass]] and mounted in pusher configuration. However, the engine was quite underpowered and the craft could not achieve flight.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Gerard Farell on Jan. 23-24, 2007.

====Jerzy Kolecki====
In 1979, a powered backpack called the Motolotnia - White Eagle, designed by Jerzy Kolecki, became available for sale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4546938.html Power Up Company, United States Patent # 4546938]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Powered backpack Motolotnia 80 White Eagle photo of advert in ''Flight Line'' magazine, march-June 1982 [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Motolotnia80_Backpack.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Kolecki, founder of Kolecki New Aviation Engineering, [[Sweden]]&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of a 90 cc McCulloch [[chainsaw]] engine with a direct drive 61&amp;nbsp;cm (24") wooden prop, producing a quoted 77&amp;nbsp;lbf (340 N) of thrust; the rate of climb was about 150&amp;nbsp;ft/min (0.76&amp;nbsp;m/s) and flight duration was limited by the small fuel tank and engine overheating after several minutes.

Other powered harnesses to reach the market in the 1980s were The Ranger&lt;ref&gt;The Ranger, designed by Bruce Hudson, UK. Powered by the [[Solo 210]] cc engine: [http://perso.orange.fr/pulma1/Un%20peu%20d'histoire.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Relax 220.&lt;ref&gt;Relax 220, designed by [[Yves Rousseau]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Foot-launched powered hang glider (1979).jpg|thumb|right|Gerry Breen - London to Paris in FLPHG (August 25, 1979)]]

* On 7 May 1979 British pilot Gerry Breen set a new distance record for FLPHG of {{convert|325|km|mi}} from [[Wales]] to [[Norwich]], a non-stop world distance record that still stands today; using a Soarmaster, the flight took about 4 hours with a [[tailwind]] of about {{convert|25|kn|mph}} and reportedly consumed {{convert|25|L|impgal}} of fuel.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Gerard Farell on November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later, on August 25 through 28, inspired by the film "[[Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines]]" and sponsored by [[British Airways]], Breen flew his powered hang glider from [[London]] to [[Paris]]: Wishing to use a British made aircraft, Gerry Breen and Steve Hunt set about building with their version of the powered Soarmaster, but had no clutch. The unit, including glider, was considerably heavier than the Soarmaster and ''Olympus'' glider combination but the wing was much more robust. The hang glider was a ''Hiway Super Scorpion'' with a {{Convert|10|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[McCulloch (company)|McCulloch]] 125 cc engine mounted on the keel just forward of the hang strap.&lt;ref&gt;This powered hang glider, registered G-BGNL, is now held by the [http://www.british-hang-gliding-museum.co.uk/acatalog/index.html British Hang Gliding Museum].&lt;/ref&gt; The journey was plagued with mechanical failures but Breen overcame them and completed the trip.&lt;ref&gt;Despite this achievement, Breen and Hunt recognized the deficiencies of the [[keel]] mounted engine and when Breen saw a picture of Roland Magallon's [[Ultralight Trikes|trike]] in the French hang gliding magazine ''Vol Libre'', he mentioned that the days of the Soarmaster 'were numbered.'&lt;/ref&gt;
* In July 2002, [[Italy|Italian]] hang gliding champion and conservationist, [[Angelo d'Arrigo]], guided a flock of 10 endangered western [[Siberian crane]]s, bred in captivity, with an Icaro hang glider equipped with an NRG powered harness {{convert|5300|km|mi}} from the [[Arctic circle]] in [[Siberia]], across [[Kazakhstan]] to the shores of the [[Caspian Sea]] in [[Iran]], avoiding [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]] where they fall victim to the abundant guns. For the most part, he relied on the sun and wind for propulsion in order to teach the young cranes to soar long distances. This $250,000 USD experiment lasted for six months and finished in winter 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hgfa.asn.au//skysailor/Issues/0505/siberianmigration.htm Interview with Angelo d'Arrigo]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sibeflyway.org/Reintroduction-Flight-of-Hope-Project-web.html Siberian Crane Flyway coordination]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Laverty Patrick. May 24, 2009.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Patrick Laverty - altitude world record: {{convert|5348|m|ft}}, U.K., May 24, 2009]]
* On May 24, 2009, Irish pilot Patrick Laverty broke the foot-launched powered hang glider altitude world record. He used an ''Aeros Discus 15 '' hang glider coupled to a supine custom-made harness equipped with a 29&amp;nbsp;hp ROS 125 engine with the ''Supa-Tuna'' tuning lights system on a WB32 carburettor. Takeoff was at sea level and he flew to an altitude of {{convert|5348|m|ft}} ASL over Talybont, Ceredigion, [[Wales]], [[UK]].&lt;ref&gt;The altitude was recorded by a digital [[altimeter]], a [[GPS]] and the flight was filmed as well; Video:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsVXl1gYITo]&lt;/ref&gt; He carried oxygen and 10 litres of fuel, per U.K. regulations; his [[variometer]] indicated 30 to 50fpm climb rate at the time fuel ran out.

==Systems==

Currently, there are two harness configurations: [[Prone position|prone]] (face down) and sitting. Both configurations allow the pilot to takeoff and land on their feet. Foot-launched powered hang glider (FLPHG) harnesses are built around a light metal frame with the engine and propeller mounted on the rear in a [[pusher configuration]]. Current powered harnesses weigh 22–32&amp;nbsp;kg (50-70&amp;nbsp;lb) not including the safety [[parachute]] and fuel, and fold neatly into a {{convert|1.5|m|ft}} long harness bag with a handle. Most powered harnesses in production are equipped with the [[Radne Raket 120]] [[two stroke]] engine which is based on [[Husqvarna AB|Husqvarna]] XP3120 [[chainsaw]] parts. It has a displacement of {{convert|118|cm3|cuin}} and produces about {{Convert|15|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 8900 [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]] if equipped with a [[expansion chamber|tuned exhaust]]; when coupled to a 1:3.5 belt-driven [[reduction drive]] and a 52" x 22" propeller, it produces about 100&amp;nbsp;lbf (440 N) of static [[thrust]]. For heavy pilots or pilots operating from higher than {{convert|1500|m|ft}} MSL fields, a powered harness equipped with an {{Convert|18|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine is recommended.&lt;ref&gt;18 hp Harnesses such as the 'X1' or 'Wasp Venom' equipped with the Vittorazi EVO 100 cc for about 130 lbf (580 N) thrust at {{convert|7000|ft|m|-2|abbr=on}} MSL&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electric motors ==

The '''Royal Bangkok Sports Club''' ('''RBSC''', {{lang-th|ราชกรีฑาสโมสร}}{{efn|{{IPA-th|râːt.tɕʰa.krīː.tʰāː.sa.mōː.sɔ̌ːn|pron}}, {{RTGS|Ratchakritha Samoson}}}}) is an exclusive [[sports club]] in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]], best known to the public for its [[horse racing]] venue. Founded in 1901, it was the first racecourse in the country and one of the oldest golf courses. Originally serving Western expatriates and Thai aristocrats, the club was at the centre of development in the introduction of modern sport to the country during the early 20th century. The club has since maintained its exclusivity, and has a reputation as a domain of high society.

== History ==
The RBSC's history dates to 1890, when English expatriate Franklin Hurst made a request to Prince [[Devawongse Varoprakar]], the Foreign Minister, for permission to establish a club, with a racecourse and sports field, in Bangkok. Permission was granted in 1892, along with a lease of land in the Sa Pathum area (now [[Pathum Wan District]]) from the government. The original club, known as the Bangkok Gymkhana Club, remained operational for less than a decade.&lt;ref name="asianracing"&gt;{{cite web|title=Thailand|url=http://www.asianracing.org/thailand|website=www.asianracing.org|publisher=Asian Racing Federation|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, a group of expatriates and high-ranking Thais, led by Russian Consul-General [[Alexander Olarovsky]], submitted a request to establish a new club, "for the purpose of improving the standard of horse breeding and various other field sports." Royal assent was granted by King [[Chulalongkorn]], and the Royal Bangkok Sports Club was established by royal charter on 6 September 1901. It took over assets of the Gymkhana Club and secured use of the racecourse land.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.rbsc.org/index.php/history|website=Royal Bangkok Sports Club website|accessdate=13 April 2018|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olarovsky became the club's first chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ostrovenko|first1=Yevgeny D.|title=Russian-Thai relations: Historical and cultural aspects|journal=Journal of the Siam Society|date=2004|volume=92|pages=117–128|url=http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/2001/JSS_092_0h_Ostrovenko_RussianThaiRelations.pdf|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horse racing began at the club in January 1903. Other sports were gradually introduced, including cricket in 1905, golf (the second oldest course in Thailand&lt;ref name="Cohen 1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Erik|title=Golf in Thailand: From Sport to Business|journal=Southeast Asian Journal of Social Science|date=1995|volume=23|issue=2|pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in 1906, rugby in 1907 and squash in 1909.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; The RBSC served as a central venue where the Thai elite adopted modern, Western sports, building an image of Thais as a civilized people as part of the country's modernization under Chulalongkorn's reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last1=Panarut|first1=Charn|title=Sports in Pre-Modern and Early Modern Siam: Aggressive and Civilised Masculinities|type=PhD thesis|date=2017|publisher=University of Sydney|url=https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/2123/17747|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Royal Bangkok Sports Club c.1910.jpg|thumb|left|The clubhouse in around 1910]]
In 1911, the club served as the site of an aviation meet, where Belgian aviator [[Charles Van den Born]] made the first demonstration of an aeroplane flight in Siam (as Thailand was then known). From 1913 to 1914 part of the club's grounds served as the country's first airfield, known as Sa Pathum Airfield. It was used by the country's first Army pilots, before permanent facilities were established at [[Don Mueang Airport]].&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rattaphong"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rattaphong Sornsuphap|script-title=th:การพนันแข่งม้าในประเทศไทย |trans-title=Gambling on horse racing in Thailand|date=2014|publisher=College of Social Innovation, Rangsit University|url=http://www.gamblingstudy-th.org/imgadmins/research_file/2556-Rattapong-horse.pdf|accessdate=8 April 2018|language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, as a result of a dispute over funding being diverted to other sports at the expense of horse racing prize money, a group of Thai members split off from the RBSC to form the [[Royal Turf Club of Thailand]].&lt;ref name="Rattaphong" /&gt; The new club largely catered to Thai members, while the RBSC continued to remain very Western-oriented, leading them to become known as Sanam Thai (the "Thai racecourse") and Sanam Farang ("''[[Farang]]'' racecourse").&lt;ref name="Can"&gt;{{cite news|author1=แคน สาริกา|title=สนามม้า-สนามการเมือง|url=http://www.komchadluek.net/news/scoop/143615|accessdate=11 April 2018|work=Kom Chad Luek|date=31 October 2012|language=th-TH}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RBSC continued to be chaired by Western expatriates until 1941, when the Japanese Army occupied the club in the course of [[World War II]] and Prince [[Rajadabhisek Sonakul]] became the first Thai chairman.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

The club continued to grow over the years, adding new facilities and introducing new sports. Its clubhouse was first rebuilt in 1912–1915. An Olympic-sized swimming pool, the first in the country, was opened in 1933. A sports pavilion was added in 1977, and a new multi-purpose building, named the Rajkreetha Sports Complex, was opened in 2005.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

In 1978, the RBSC took over the Bangkok Riding and Polo Club (situated 1.5 km away on [[Witthayu Road]]), which was having financial difficulties.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; It became the RBSC Polo Club, and operates as a subsidiary of the RBSC, although the memberships are kept separate.&lt;ref name="Manager 8678" /&gt;

== Location and facilities ==
[[File:Rbsc race.JPG|thumb|The RBSC's grandstand is the only area open to the public]]
The RBSC occupies {{convert|227|rai|ha acre}} of land on [[Henri Dunant Road]], opposite [[Chulalongkorn University]]. (The road was previously known as Thanon Sanam Ma ({{lang|th|ถนนสนามม้า}}, "Racecourse Road") after the club.) It is surrounded on other sides by the [[Royal Thai Police Headquarters]], [[Ratchadamri Road]] and [[King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital]]/[[Chulalongkorn University Faculty of Medicine]].

The RBSC is among the most exclusive clubs in Thailand, and is highly selective of its members. Descriptions of the application process in 1990 include being proposed and seconded by existing members, going through a vetting process, and after sitting through a waiting list of up to a decade, being interviewed by the General Committee (the club's executive board), who must give unanimous approval for the application to be successful.&lt;ref name="Manager 8678"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=สุปราณี คงนิรันดรสุข|title=ประเพณีเข้าสปอร์ตคลับกว่าจะเป็นไฮโซไซตี้ต้องรอ|journal=Manager|date=December 1990|url=http://info.gotomanager.com/news/details.aspx?id=8678|accessdate=14 April 2018|language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt; New members are also required to pay an entrance fee, reportedly up to 2 million baht ($65,000) in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jorgensen|first1=Greg|title=Bangkok's top 4 private member clubs|url=https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/bangkok-top-private-member-clubs/index.html|website=CNN Travel|accessdate=14 April 2018|language=en|date=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children of current members, however, are automatically entitled to membership once they turn 20 years old.&lt;ref name="Manager 8678" /&gt; The number of members is limited at 12,500 accounts.&lt;ref&gt;RBSC Magazine, Vol.7 No.73 July 2007, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Polo Club membership, which is less exclusive, has served to help absorb the excess potential members.&lt;ref name="Manager 8678" /&gt; (RBSC members may use the Polo Club's facilities, while the reverse is not true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.rbsc.org/index.php/history-rbscpoloclub|website=Royal Bangkok Sports Club website|accessdate=15 April 2018|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

The club, once described in a golf guidebook as "one of Asia's remnants of the great age of Imperialism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=ffrench-Blake|first1=N.|last2=McManus|first2=A.|title=Thailand Golf Guide|place=Bangkok|publisher=International Golf Guides|date=1992}} Cited in Cohen 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; is also very conservative in its values, derived from its [[gentlemen's club]] origins. Although its membership is now mostly Thai (87% in 1990), proposals to amend the club's articles of association to allow more than half of the General Committee seats to be held by Thais have repeatedly failed, as have suggestions that memberships be made transferable.&lt;ref name="Manager 8678" /&gt; Up until the 2010s, women also did not have voting rights; this was changed in 2018 when gender-equal membership was implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Extraordinary general meeting No. 2/2016-2017|url=https://www.rbsc.org/images/Announcement/Announcements/RBSC/2017/AgendaMinutes_for_EGM_12_Sep_17_Eng.pdf|publisher=Royal Bangkok Sports Club|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sairol Sahari''' is a [[Brunei]]an [[association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Kasuka FC]] of the [[Brunei Super League]] as a [[defender (association football)|defender]].

Sairol began his career as a young left-sided midfielder for the [[Brunei M-League Team|Brunei team]] which played in the Malaysian league system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Malaysia 2003|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesm/malay03.html|date=17 February 2005|publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving the country's representative side in 2004, he helped NBT FC gain promotion to the [[Brunei Premier League|domestic top flight]]. He moved to [[DPMM FC]] in 2006 when the club had entered the [[Malaysia Premier League]] in Brunei FA's place. He was sent on loan to [[Indera SC]] in 2010 while DPMM was prevented from playing in the [[S.League]] due to a [[Brunei national football team#Suspension|FIFA suspension of Brunei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BPL under watchful eyes of DPMM FC|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/sports-national/2011/03/03/bpl-under-watchful-eyes-dpmm-fc|date=3 March 2011|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 April 2016, Sairol suffered an [[anterior cruciate ligament injury]] in training and was absent for the remaining [[2016 S.League]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sairol out for the season|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/sports-national/2016/04/28/sairol-out-season|date=28 April 2016|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=28 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502011805/http://www.bt.com.bn/sports-national/2016/04/28/sairol-out-season|archivedate=2 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sairol has since joined [[Kasuka FC]] as assistant coach for the [[2017 Brunei Super League]], with a view to returning to action in the next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sairol aiming to bounce back next year |url=http://www.brusports.com/2017/04/12/sairol-aiming-to-bounce-back-next-year/|date=12 April 2017|publisher=BruSports News|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He registered as a player for Kasuka for the [[2018-19 Brunei Super League|2018-19 season]] and has impressed since, scoring against [[Najip-Bakes FC|Najip-Bakes]] and [[Indera SC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SAIROL RETURNS STRONGER AFTER ACL INJURY|url=https://www.brusports.com/2018/11/17/sairol-returns-stronger-after-acl-injury/|date=17 November 2018|publisher=BruSports News|accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Still 18 years of age, Sairol was chosen to represent [[Brunei national under-23 football team|Brunei]] at the [[2001 Southeast Asian Games|2001 SEA Games]] held in [[Kuala Lumpur]], and made his sole appearance against [[Malaysia national under-23 football team|the hosts]] and only lasting about half-an-hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=South East Asian Games 2001 (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia) - Match Details|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/sea01-det.html|date=20 September 2001|publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sairol then played for the [[Brunei national under-21 football team|under-21s]] at the [[2002 Hassanal Bolkiah Trophy|2002]] and [[2005 Hassanal Bolkiah Trophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ASEAN U-21 Championship 2005 (Piala Hassanal Bolkiah)|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/asean-u21-05.html|date=17 February 2005|publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sairol made his international debut for the [[Brunei national football team|Wasps]] in 2008 (he was an unused substitute in the [[2004 AFC Asian Cup qualification|2004 Asian Cup qualifying]] matches), when his club side DPMM was sent as the nation's representatives at the [[2008 AFF Suzuki Cup qualification]] held in [[Cambodia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DPMM FC head to Cambodia|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/local_sport/2008/10/15/dpmm_fc_head_to_cambodia|date=15 October 2008|publisher=The Brunei Times|accessdate=30 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402173841/http://www.bt.com.bn/local_sport/2008/10/15/dpmm_fc_head_to_cambodia|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brunei failed to qualify after one win and one draw.

A '''sports league''' is a group of [[sports team]]s that compete against each other in a specific [[sport]]. At its simplest, it may be a local group of [[amateur sports|amateur]] athletes who form teams among themselves and compete on weekends;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://somervillearchives.omeka.net/exhibits/show/recreation1/sports-exercise/adultsports-exercise|title=Adult Sports &amp; Exercise · WHAT PARK DID YOU HANG OUT AT? · Somerville Archives|author=|date=|website=somervillearchives.omeka.net|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006011940/http://somervillearchives.omeka.net/exhibits/show/recreation1/sports-exercise/adultsports-exercise|archivedate=2015-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at its most complex, it can be an international [[professional sports league organization|professional]] league making large amounts of money and involving dozens of teams and thousands of players.

==Terminology==

===Synonyms===
In many cases, organizations that function as leagues are described using a different term, such as [[National Basketball Association|association]], [[Conference (sports)|conference]], [[Division (sport)|division]], [[league table|leaderboard]], or [[Playoff format|series]]. This is especially common in individual sports, although the term "league" is sometimes used in amateur individual sports such as [[golf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_46/b3908601.htm|title=A Golf League of Their Own|author=|date=|website=businessweek.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223083227/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_46/b3908601.htm|archivedate=2009-12-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "league" is also sometimes applied to competitions that would more traditionally be called [[tournaments]], such as the [[UEFA Champions League]], which is organized with multiple small round-robin competitions followed by a single elimination tournament to choose an overall winner.

===Leagues and league systems===
"League" and its synonyms may be used to encompass either a single competition or a related group of competitions.

Many groups use [[promotion and relegation]], where the best-ranked team(s) in the ''lower [[division (sport)|division]]'' are ''promoted'' to the ''higher division'' for the next season, and the worst-ranked team(s) in the ''higher division'' are ''relegated'' to the ''lower division'' for the next season. Under this system, the term "league" may be used to refer both to a [[league system]], a group of leagues that are tied together in a hierarchical fashion by promotion and relegation, and to the individual leagues within the league system. For example, in [[Football in England|English association football]], the [[English Football League]] (EFL) is a league system, while the term "National League" refers both to [[National League (division)|the league]] immediately below the EFL in the English pyramid and to [[National League (English football)|its associated league system]].

An alternate system of league organization which is used primarily in Australia, Canada, and the United States is a closed model which always has the same teams playing, with occasional admission of [[expansion teams]] and [[Relocation of professional sports teams|relocation of existing teams]]. There is no team movement between the higher [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|''major league'']] and the lower ''[[minor league]]s''.

In many of these closed-model leagues in Canada and the United States, they are divided into subdivisions on historical or geographical lines. These may be referred to as ''conferences'' or ''divisions''. For example, the [[National Football League]] (NFL) is divided into the [[National Football Conference]] and [[American Football Conference]]; the latter conference was formed largely from the remnants of the [[American Football League]] after it [[AFL–NFL merger|merged with the NFL]], though it now contains three original NFL teams and three expansion teams. Both the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) and [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) are divided into Eastern and Western Conferences. The conferences in the NFL, NBA, and NHL are further divided into subsets, all of which are called "divisions." These are geographically based, and teams play their divisional opponents more than any others, and then play the other clubs in their conference more than their non-conference opponents.

Baseball has a unique nomenclature, with "[[Major League Baseball]]" (MLB) the name of the overall grouping of 30 teams in two "major leagues", the [[American League]] (AL) and the older [[National League]] (NL). They are titled leagues rather than conferences for several reasons. The National League predates the American by 25 years and was considered a "major" league in comparison to its early competitors, and in a sense it simply extended this recognition to the AL, the only league of similar financial clout. In addition, the leagues played no interlocking schedule of any kind until 1995, and then added only a small amount of [[interleague play]], with the main AL-NL competition occurring between their champions in the [[World Series]]. Thus the two leagues played mostly separate competitions within the larger framework of MLB. Finally, until 2000, they were actually separate legal entities, unlike the conferences of other leagues. [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] in Japan has a similar history, with the [[Central League]] and [[Pacific League]] not founded together.

Due to this naming custom, it is common to use slightly different terms to discuss MLB. Where someone might refer to "the best [[quarterback]] in the league" and be understood to mean the overall NFL, a similar mention of "the best [[outfielder]] in the league" is almost always a reference to the American ''or'' National League, and "all of baseball" or similar is used to denote the larger status. Each of the major leagues also has its own [[List of Major League Baseball awards|set of awards]] to recognize the separation between the two, which means there are two [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|MVPs]], two [[Cy Young Award|Cy Young]] winners, etc. And since its name is constructed differently—a description of the status of two leagues rather than the title of one—it is common to hear "MLB" without "the" attached to it, as in "the most home runs in MLB this year," since one would not say "the Major League Baseball."

==League organization==
The common thread between all sports leagues is a structure that allows teams or individuals to compete against each other in a nonrandom order on a set schedule, usually called a "season," with the results of the individual competitions being used to name an overall champion.

A league championship may be contested in a number of ways. Each team may play every other team a certain number of times in a [[round-robin tournament]]. Usually, teams play equal number of games or matches at their own stadium and at other teams', because [[home advantage]] is a major factor in many sports. When teams competing for a tournament championship do not play the same teams the same number of times, it is known as an unbalanced schedule.

In such a set-up, the team with the best record becomes champion, based on either a strict win-loss-tie system or on a points system where a certain number of points are awarded for a win, loss, or tie, while bonus points might also be added for teams meeting various criteria. Many leagues also use [[playoffs]], where after teams compete in a regular season in a league format, the top teams (possibly determined by conference or division) advance to the playoffs. In some such leagues having the best regular season record is relatively unimportant, though top-seeded teams in some leagues, such as the [[NFL]], can gain byes to later rounds of the playoffs, and teams finishing with the best records usually have the advantage of playing the weakest teams that have advanced to the playoffs.

==Alternatives to traditional league organization==
While round-robin and modified round-robin competitions are the most common form of league organization, there are a number of ways to organize a sporting competition, almost all of which may be described as a "league". Many sports organizations fall on a continuum between a total lack of organization, as in a pick-up game, and a formal league such as is common at the highest level of professional team sports.

===Non-league sports===
The simplest form of competition is to allow teams to play each other whenever they see fit. In some sports, such as [[horse racing]], the main goal of the entrants is to win individual [[Purse (horse racing)|purses]], and there is little or no ranking or competition outside winning certain major races. A small amount of league organization may be imposed on these non-league sports by way of a series or [[tournament]] tying several individual events together, such as the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]].

Even in team sports that normally use a traditional league format, some teams often exist outside any league; these teams are generally known as [[Barnstorm (sports)|barnstorming]] teams and either schedule games against local professional or amateur competition or bring their own competition, such as the barnstorming [[Harlem Globetrotters]] did when they toured with the [[Washington Generals]]. As with the Globetrotters, barnstorming teams sometimes emphasize spectacle over athletic competition.

In Europe, the term "cup competition" is used to describe [[single elimination]] or [[Tournament#Knockout tournaments|knock-out]] tournaments, where the pairing of teams in each round is determined by a "draw" (see for example, the [[FA Cup#The draw|FA Cup]] in England), to distinguish it from league competition, in which every club in the [[Professional sports league organization#Structure of European leagues|league or division]] plays the other teams a pre-determined number of times in a season, usually on a home and away basis.

Further, in England, the term [[non-league football]] is used for historical reasons to describe [[association football]] teams that play in organized leagues, but not in the [[English Football League]] or [[Premier League]], the two highest levels of competition in that sport in that country.

[[Independent baseball]] is used similarly in the United States to describe [[baseball]] teams that play in leagues other than those sanctioned by [[Major League Baseball]]. These teams do play in leagues and should not be confused with barnstorming teams that play truly non-league schedules.

===Rankings and leaderboards===
Individual sports often use an alternative type of league organization where competitors are ranked against each other. In the simplest cases, such as [[boxing]], the rankings mean little and the major competition is to crown a champion in a title fight.

In other sports, the rankings and leaderboards gain importance when they are used in [[seed (sports)|seed]]ing tournaments.

In some sports, points are assigned to results at individual competitions, and the resulting points are used to generate a season rankings and determine the season champion. While not usually referred to as "leagues", but "tours" or "series", these season-long competitions with set events are very similar to league structures in team sports. Examples of this are [[motorsport]], [[tennis]], [[golf]], [[skiing]], [[beach volleyball]] and [[rugby sevens]].

===Conferences and informal leagues===
American [[college sports]] are traditionally organized into groups of teams known as "conferences."&lt;ref&gt;Some conferences, though, use "league" instead of "conference." [http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/history/overview About The Ivy League] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903051415/http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/history/overview |date=2011-09-03 }}. The Ivy League official website. Council of Ivy Group Presidents. Retrieved 2011-09-05.&lt;/ref&gt; These conferences ordinarily keep league tables and crown champions within the conference, as other sports leagues do, but the individual school also schedule a certain number of "non-conference" games that are organized independently between two schools in different conferences, or between a conference team and a non-conference team. Also, national championships in some college sports are determined by a ranking or playoff system that is independent of the individual conferences.

==Round-robin sports leagues==
Most major team sports play some form of round-robin schedule, where the goal is for each team to play a relatively balanced schedule with each other team in the league or in its league subdivision.  Within this structure, there are a few significant differences between leagues, a few of which are set forth below.

===Single-table versus unbalanced schedule===
The simplest way to organize a sports league, and still one of the most common, is in a double round-robin format where each team plays each other team twice, once at home and once away.  This ensures that every team plays an equally difficult schedule and that no team has undue [[home field advantage]].  This organization is still used in many team sports around the world.

One potential drawback of this simple double round-robin format is that the number of teams in the league determines the schedule.  Larger leagues may not be able to play as many games as such a system would require, and smaller leagues may want more games.  In addition, leagues whose teams are geographically spread out over a wide area (a common situation for leagues in North America) may face significant travel costs.  One solution is to play an unbalanced schedule, with some teams playing additional games against some other teams; this is the way [[Major League Soccer]] has traditionally been scheduled, with the additional games being played against local rivals.  Some leagues also break the league into subunits, often known as "divisions" and "conferences," each of which may itself play a balanced or unbalanced schedule.

===Cups, tournaments and playoffs===
Many sports leagues also participate in a single-elimination tournament each year.  In the United States, Mexico, and some other countries, these tournaments are commonly called "playoffs" and are played at the end of the season, with the teams qualifying for the playoffs based on their performance during the season.  In Europe, "cup" competitions are more common, with all teams playing in a single-elimination tournament that takes place during and parallel with the regular season.

==Plot==
Los Angeles newspaper reporter Eve Drake is assigned to cover a motorcycle race. There she sees Dusty Weston win a race using questionable tactics. She is asked to present the winner's trophy afterward, but when Dusty plants a kiss on her, she slaps his face.

Eve's critical article irks Dusty and his employer, J.C. Barton, who owns a motorcycle factory. At a home belonging to his mechanic pal Rocket Anderson, they discuss Eve with rival cyclist Chris Rhodes, another friend. Chris suggests softening her up and invites Eve to pay another visit. She enjoys a cycle ride until Chris and Dusty try to elude two motorcycle police officers and crash into a ditch.

Chris then suffers a leg injury in a race after Dusty's dangerous maneuver. Dusty is fired, after which Chris is given a new hydraulic bike to race that Barton needs to be a success if he is going to be able to keep his factory up and running. Chris protests that Dusty is the better rider and could win the big race on the new bike. Barton refuses to budge, and while Dusty takes a job as a trick rider for a carnival.

Chris falls in love with Eve, but she's romantically attracted to Dusty and unsure what to do. Chris punches him when Dusty says they intend to marry. Dusty then surprisingly enters the big race, competing against Chris and the new Barton bike. At the last minute, when Chris takes a spill, Dusty deliberately does the same, giving Chris a chance to get back up and be victorious. A grateful Chris congratulates his friend and Eve on their engagement.

[[File:UniversityOvalNZ.jpg|thumb|right|Otago host Northern Districts at the University of Otago Oval in February 2007.]]

The '''University of Otago Oval''' is a sports ground located at [[Logan Park, Dunedin]], New Zealand, and owned by the [[Dunedin City Council]]. The ground was originally owned by the [[University of Otago]], but ownership was transferred to the city council when a redevelopment was completed in the early 2000s.

The ground is the home of both the [[Otago Cricket Association]] and the University of Otago Rugby Football Club, and is also used as a training base for the [[Highlanders (rugby)|Highlanders]] Rugby Football team. The University of Otago Oval hosted the first game where the [[Umpire Decision Review System]] was officially used,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci-icc/content/story/436290.html |title=Official debut for enhanced review system |date= 23 Nov 2009 |publisher= Cricinfo |accessdate=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; after a test run in Sri Lanka in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/news/53230-umpiring-decision-review-system-on-the-cards|title=Umpiring decision review system on the cards – NDTV Sports|first=|last=NDTVSports.com|publisher=|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facilities ==

A media complex, which consists of television and radio commentary rooms, is situated at the northern end of the ground. Temporary scaffolding for television cameras is built at both ends of the ground (above the media complex, and on the bank at the southern end) when required. A historic grandstand is located at the southern end of the ground, and an electronic scoreboard on the north-eastern side.

The grandstand complex includes changing rooms, members’ rooms, lounges and bars, players’ viewing areas, a medical room, kitchens, offices, umpires’ rooms, a canteen and shop, media rooms and storage rooms. A building attached to the rear hosts the University Rugby Club.

== International Cricket ==

===First Test===
The University of Otago Oval became New Zealand's seventh test ground when it hosted its first [[test cricket|test match]] on 4 January 2008, between New Zealand and Bangladesh. This was Dunedin's first Test match for ten years. NZ$6 million was spent refurbishing the University of Otago Oval and it has now replaced [[Carisbrook]] as Dunedin's test-cricket venue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv3.co.nz/News/SportsNews/Story/tabid/415/articleID/42795/cat/41/Default.aspx Cricket: Black Caps check out Dunedin’s University Oval]&lt;/ref&gt;

Just one month prior to the Test match, a [[State Championship]] match between Auckland and Otago, which was scheduled to last four days, ended in less than two due to an under-prepared pitch. Auckland scored 94 and 128 and Otago 170 and 54 for 4.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/125/125312.html Otago v Auckland 3 &amp; 4 Dec 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Auckland Coach, Mark O'Donnell, had this to say about the pitch:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It was an unmitigated cock-up and a disgraceful wicket. I've been five times to [University Oval] in the last five years and on each occasion it's been substandard. They just haven't got it right. If you'd put a test attack on that surface you'd probably have killed someone once the divots dried out."&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10481377"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/story.cfm?c_id=496&amp;objectid=10481377 |title=Cricket: Dunedin debacle still disgusts O'Donnell |author=Leggat, David |date=10 December 2007 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

O'Donnell also said that those claiming that the pitch was not at fault and that poor batting had played a large part in proceedings were "deluding themselves".

As a result, [[New Zealand Cricket]] sent its chief turf assessor, Jarrod Carter, to Dunedin to help the local groundsman, Tom Tamati, prepare the test pitch.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10485065"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/category/story.cfm?c_id=29&amp;objectid=10485065 |title=Cricket: Fingers crossed for the University pitch |author=Leggat, David |date=3 January 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the University Oval's first test finished inside three days that was largely attributed to poor batting by most of the Bangladeshis rather than to the nature of the pitch: New Zealand scored 357 and the Bangladeshi openers had a 161-run partnership in the second innings. After the match [[Daniel Vettori]], New Zealand's captain, said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Everything about the whole setup was fantastic, apart from the size of the boundaries. It was a little bit farcical. They were just too small. If you bowled to [Australian batsmen] [[Matthew Hayden]] or [[Adam Gilchrist]] it would be a tough day as a spinner. Aside from that, if they can sort it out I couldn't rate it higher. It can be one of the premier test venues."&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10485540"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/4/story.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10485540 |title=Cricket: Extend boundaries and Dunedin is perfect, says Vettori |author=Leggat, David |date=7 January 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Second Test===
From 11 to 15 December 2008, New Zealand played the West Indies at the University of Otago Oval. The match was ruined by rain. The ground's drainage and the ability of the ground staff to cope with rain were criticized.

Dylan Cleaver, writing in ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]''under the headline "Dunedin not fit to stage a test" stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"At Brisbane, it rained so hard [[the Gabba]] was reduced to a lake. The next morning, play started on time at 10am. Yesterday, despite there being nary a spittle of rain since the previous evening, a ball was not delivered until 2.45pm. That borders on farcical. Until such time as the Otago Cricket Association or New Zealand Cricket invests in a decent drainage system and super-soppers, the University Oval should not host another test."&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10547938"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10547938 |title= Dunedin not fit to stage a test |author=Cleaver, Dylan |date=14 December 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dylan further described the University Oval as a "club ground".

[[Ross Dykes]], the [[Otago Cricket Association]] chief executive, said the article was insulting to Dunedin, the University Oval and the groundstaff. He confirmed the ground had drainage problems, because it had been built on reclaimed land, but rejected criticism of New Zealand Cricket or the ground staff:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We had a huge amount of rainfall and I think we probably did everything we could. ... It has to be appreciated that this ground is the old [[Pelichet Bay]], so it is reclaimed land. ... When you get that amount of rainfall, you get to a point where you can clear off the surface moisture but by trying to get more out you only end up dragging more up."&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-nz.cricinfo.com/nzvwi2008_09/content/story/382184.html Cricinfo: Questions over facilities after washout]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Third Test===
The University of Otago Oval hosted its third Test match from 24 to 28 November 2009, against Pakistan. Play was briefly interrupted by rain on the second day, and bad light plagued several of the evening sessions, but the problems of the previous Tests did not emerge. The match proved to be a cliffhanger, with a win to either side, a draw or even a tie still possible as the fifth day entered its final session. New Zealand eventually won by 32 runs, taking Pakistan's last five wickets for 54 runs in the final session of day five. The Test was hailed by some as the test of the year, notably by [[Sambit Bal]] writing for [[Cricinfo]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Dunedin provided almost everything. The drama. The twists. The contest between bat and ball. Swing and seam and pace. Stirring batting. Wickets falling in a heap and then the batsmen fighting back. ... Easily it was the best Test of the year: if it failed to move you, cricket will never be your game."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/437429.html Cricinfo:There's nothing quite like test cricket]. Retrieved 1 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Fourth Test===
The fourth Test match played at the University of Otago Oval saw New Zealand face South Africa from 7 to 11 March 2012. The two sides were evenly matched, with New Zealand gaining a slender first innings lead of 35 runs, scoring 273 to South Africa's 238. However, the Proteas rallied in their second innings, scoring 435-5d. with captain [[Graeme Smith]], [[Jacques Kallis]] and [[Jacques Rudolph]] all scoring centuries. Chasing a target of 401 to win, New Zealand reached 137/2 at close of play on day 4, setting up a tantalising end to the Test match. Unfortunately, however, no play was possible on the final day due to rain, and the match ended in a draw.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/newzealand/engine/match/520603.html Cricinfo Match Scorecard]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fifth Test===
The fifth Test match at the University of Otago Oval was contested between New Zealand and England from March 6 to 10, 2013. It was the first test in a three match series. New Zealand captain [[Brendon McCullum]] won the toss and elected to bowl, however there was no play on Day 1 due to rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McGlashan|first=Andrew|title=Opening day washed out|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/new-zealand-v-england-2013/content/story/623663.html|work=ESPNCcricinfo|publisher=ESPN EMEA |accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A poor batting display from England saw them dismissed for 167 on Day 2, with [[Neil Wagner]] and left-arm spinner [[Bruce Martin (cricketer)|Bruce Martin]] (on debut) each taking 4 wickets for New Zealand. New Zealand then racked up a huge lead, declaring at 460 for 9. Debutant opener [[Hamish Rutherford]] scored an aggressive 171 and Brendon McCullum struck 74 from 59 deliveries, while [[James Anderson (cricketer)|James Anderson]] took 4 wickets for England.  The English then went into survival mode and managed to hold on for a draw, scoring 421 for 6 by the close of play on Day 5.
