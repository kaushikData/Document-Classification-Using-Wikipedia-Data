An '''articled clerk'''  is someone who is studying to either be an accountant or a lawyer. In doing so they are put under the supervision of someone already in the profession, usually for two years. This can be compared as being an intern for a company; the only difference is once the two years is over the trainee becomes the trainer.  Trainees are obligated to sign a contract agreeing to the terms of being an articled clerk. The articled clerk signs a contract, known as "articles of clerkship", committing to a fixed period of employment. ''Wharton's Law Lexicon'' defines an articled clerk as "a pupil of a solicitor, who undertakes, by articles of clerkship, continuing covenants, mutually binding, to instruct him in the principles and practice of the profession".{{sfn|Burrill|1859|p=134}} The contract is with a specific [[partnership|partner]] in the firm and not with the firm as a whole.

Apprentice [[architect]]s can also be articled. [[Henry Percy Adams (architect)|Henry Percy Adams]] articled to Britwen Binyon (1846&amp;ndash;1909), architect.&lt;ref name=adamspainter&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.suffolkartists.co.uk/index.cgi?choice=painter&amp;pid=15 |title=ADAMS, (Harry) Percy |publisher=www.suffolkartists.co.uk |date= |accessdate=October 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== India ==
In India, the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of India]] undergo an articleship programme for a period of 3/3.5 years as the case may be, CA Students after clearing CA-IPCC/Intermediate/Inter Group 1 or Both Group are required to registered himself with a partner of a CA Firm duly registered with the Institute. Those Students during the period of articleship are also known as Articled Clerk.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Sri Lanka ==
In Sri Lanka, student members of the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka]] are required to serve as a clerk serving under articles with a member of the Institute in practice or with a member of the Institute who is a salaried employee in the service of a firm of accountants for a minimum three-year practical training period. They are known as Articled clerks during this period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.casrilanka.com/casl/images/pdf/members/parliament_act.pdf Act of Incorporation And Regulations Of The Institute Of Chartered Accountants Of Sri Lanka]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ashot Gevorkovich Egiazaryan''' (Russian: Ашот Геворкович Егиазарян; Armenian: Աշոտ Գեւորգովիչ Էկիազարյան), born July 24, 1965 in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]] is fugitive from political persecution (accounts vary), former Russian politician, and businessman.

==Career==

===Banking===
In 1988, Egiazaryan graduated from the Economics Faculty of Moscow State University with a Ph.D.  in economics, and subsequently began a career in banking.

In 1993, Egiazaryan established and became the Chairman of the Moscow National Bank (MNB).  By 1995, MNB had become one of the largest banks in Russia, housing accounts of the Administration of Moscow region, The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, Russian State Arms Export Company, The Russian Space Agency and the General Prosecutor’s Office.

In 1996, Egiazaryan was appointed Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors of “Unikombank” JSCB, a position he held from June 1996 to May 1998.

In 1999, Egiazaryan provided testimony in the criminal case regarding the embezzlement of $130 million from accounts held at MNB. The embezzled funds belonged to state-owned Rosvooruzheniye Weaponry Company. The investigation found that MNB used forged documents to withdraw the state funds.  The stolen money was then moved through the MNB-controlled Unikom bank.

MNB’s banking license was revoked in 1998, but no criminal charges were brought against Egiazaryan.

===Politics===
In 1999, Egiazaryan became a member of the State Duma and deputy chairman of the Committee on Budget and Taxes.

In October 2010, the State Duma’s Credentials and Ethics Commission recommended stripping Egiazaryan of parliamentary immunity at the request of the Investigative Committee.
  
On November 3, 2010, the State Duma followed through with a request by Russian Prosecutor General Yury Chaika and officially stripped Egiazaryan of his immunity. A total of 352 lawmakers of the Duma voted in favor of this action, with 39 deputies, all members of the Liberal Democratic Party, opposing the motion and five members abstained from the vote.&lt;ref&gt;“In the Deputy Signs of Fraud Were Found.” [http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=1528001&amp;NodesID=6 Kommersant.ru]. October 23, 2010. (Russian language)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal Indictment==
In August 2010, Europark investor Vitaly Smagin filed a lawsuit against Egiazaryan, accusing him of pledging Smagin’s stake in the Europark shopping mall in western Moscow to Deutsche Bank as collateral on an $87.5M loan.  The $87.5M loan was then used to secure a 20% interest in the Moskva Hotel project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=250 |url=http://www.wek.ru/articles/politic/76017.shtml |title=Жириновскому не простят Егиазаряна |publisher=Wek.ru |date=2010-08-26 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, after the commencement of a criminal investigation into the $87.5M fraud, Egiazaryan filed a claim in a Cyprus court complaining that a group of Russian politicians, and businessmen, including [[Suleyman Kerimov]], conspired to take over Egiazaryan’s share in the multi-billiondollar Moskva Hotel project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Belton |first=Catherine |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ef30542c-c67b-11df-8a9f-00144feab49a.html#ixzz16Cm02qTO |title=Russian tycoon’s assets frozen |publisher=FT.com |date=2010-09-22 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 15, 2010, a Cyprus court granted an injunctive freeze on Suleyman Kerimov’s assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Orphanides |first=Stelios |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-17/kerimov-set-to-challenge-asset-freeze-in-dec-14-court-hearing.html |title=Kerimov Set to Challenge Asset Freeze in Dec. 14 Court Hearing |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2010-11-17 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The case was later dismissed on February 15, 2011 and the district court of Nicosia in Cyprus lifted the injunction on Kerimov’s assets.   The court stated that Egiazaryan had failed to disclose essential facts in the original filing for the injunction and that the alleged conspiracy happened 15 months before the filing of the original complaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Orphanides |first=Stelios |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-15/cyprus-court-lifts-freeze-on-russia-billionaire-kerimov-s-assets.html |title=Cyprus Court Lifts Freeze on Uralkali, Polyus Stock |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2011-02-15 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010 the State Duma’s Credentials and Ethics Commission recommended stripping Egiazaryan of parliamentary immunity at the request of the Investigative Committee, based on accusations that Egiazaryan embezzled $87 million for his share of the Hotel Moskva project.&lt;ref&gt;“Parliament member sued for embezzlement.” Russian Financial Control Monitor. August 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, 2010, the State Duma officially stripped Egiazaryan of his immunity.&lt;ref&gt;“Duma Deputy May Lose Immunity.” [http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/duma-deputy-may-lose-immunity/420806.html Moscow Times]. October 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, investigators raided Egiazaryan’s offices at the Dayev Plaza and also conducted searches at Egiazaryan’s residences in Moscow. The search was later extended to the offices of the Europark shopping mall, of which Egiazaryan was a part owner.&lt;ref&gt;“Investigators searched the office deputy from the LDPR Ashot Yeghiazaryan.” ''[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;u=http://www.yerkramas.org/2010/11/08/sledovateli-obyskali-kabinet-deputata-ot-ldpr-ashota-egiazaryana/&amp;ei=bKbZTNPFIcb_lgeUw83LCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBUQ7gEwAA&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dhttp://www.yerkramas.org/2010/11/08/sledovateli-obyskali-kabinet-deputata-ot-ldpr-ashota-egiazaryana/%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26hs%3Ddzu%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26prmd%3Div Yerkarmas]''.

On December 17, 2010, the Russian Authorities seized three land plots belonging to Egiazaryan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Moscow Times|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/yegiazaryans-land-seized/427023.html|title=Yegiazaryan's Land Seized|date=17 December 2010|accessdate=23 January 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101222133520/http://themoscowtimes.com/news/article/yegiazaryans-land-seized/427023.html| archivedate= 22 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; One plot is located in Barvikha, and the other two in Zhukovka. Egiazaryan’s Duma office was also searched and investigators seized paperwork related to the case against him.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|author=22/4/2013 8:31 |url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20110309/162927233.htm |title=Main news of March 9 &amp;#124; World &amp;#124; RIA Novosti |publisher=En.rian.ru |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, the Basmanny district court of Moscow indicted Egiazaryan on charges of large scale fraud.    The court also attached Egiazaryan’s assets to be used to compensate Vitaly Smagin and Europark for the $87.5M that was embezzled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.sledcom.ru/news/40240.html?sphrase_id=169159 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130706102316/http://www.sledcom.ru/news/40240.html?sphrase_id=169159 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-07-06 |title=В рамках уголовного дела в отношении Ашота Егиазаряна наложен арест на денежные средства и ценные бумаги |publisher=Sledcom.ru |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the court ruling, the lower house of parliament in Russia gave approval on March 9, 2011 for Egiazaryan’s arrest on charges of large-scale fraud.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Arrival in the United States==
After being indicted for fraud in Russia, Egiazaryan fled to the United States, claiming that he feared for his life and that the fraud allegations against him were politically motivated.&lt;ref name="jewishjournal1"&gt;{{cite web|author=peter zalmayev |url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/opinion/article/hiding_in_beverly_hills_20110309 |title=Hiding in Beverly Hills &amp;#124; Opinion |publisher=Jewish Journal |date=2011-03-09 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Zalmayev]], director of the Eurasia Democracy Initiative (EDI), stated, “Egiazaryan claims he is fleeing persecution, but the real reason appears to be that he is fleeing prosecution. His lawyers are reportedly seeking political asylum for their client.”&lt;ref name="jewishjournal1"/&gt;

Egiazaryan later sued Zalmayev for defamation and Zalmayev countersued for infringement of his speech utilizing the anti-[[SLAPP|Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation]] laws of New York State.  Egiazaryan’s case was dismissed, but Zalmayev’s case continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=leagle.com |url=http://www.leagle.com/xmlResult.aspx?xmldoc=In%20FDCO%2020111208B70.xml&amp;docbase=CsLwAr3-2007-Curr |title=EGIAZARYAN v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4923">'''BPM Everywhere''' ('''BPME''') represents a strategy for coping, and possibly exploiting, the disruption that is anticipated as a result of structural changes due to technical progression known as the [[Internet of Things]] ('''IoT''').  IoT will substantially increase the number of devices connected together &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internet-of-things-research.eu/pdf/IoT_Cluster_Strategic_Research_Agenda_2011.pdf|title= Internet of Things Strategic Research Roadmap}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will increase the complexity of those connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2905717|title= Gartner Says 4.9 Billion Connected "Things" Will Be in Use in 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IoT is expected to cause the practitioners of [[Business Process Management]] ('''BPM'''), a well-established discipline concerned with management and optimizing an organizations processes, to face a number of critical issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skelta.com/products/BPM/BPM-Internet-of-Things/BPM-IoT-whitepaper.aspx|title= BPM &amp; Internet of Things – The Signal of True Disruption}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.capgemini.com/blog/capping-it-off/2013/07/why-bpm-can-no-longer-ignore-the-internet-of-things|title= Why BPM can no longer ignore the" internet of things"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bp-3.com/blogs/2015/04/internet-of-things-meet-bpm/|title= Internet of Things, meet BPM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, IT Industry magazine, Information Age said that "Simply because they connect, communicate and analyse doesn’t make an IoT thing productive or useful. To be impactful, IoT technologies need to solve real problems that typically involve multiple collaborating activities that include people, systems, and 'things'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.information-age.com/industry/software/123458642/why-internet-things-needs-process-everything-work|title= Why the Internet of Things needs the Process of Everything to work}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr. Setrag Khoshafian, a leading expert in Business Process Management (BPM), "the real transformation of the IoT will occur through the 'end-to-end digitization of processes.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business.com/technology/connecting-the-internet-of-things-bpm-and-the-human-element/|title= Connecting The Internet of Things, BPM and the Human Element}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BPME is an approach that leverages traditional [[business process modeling]] techniques together with [[process mining]] and process analytics in order to automate and distribute the job of discovering, measuring, and improving the processes.{{cn|date=March 2017}}   Nathaniel Palmer, leading analyst in the field of BPM and Director of the [[Workflow Management Coalition]] ('''WfMC'''), sees BPME as a next-generation application development platform, combining the ability to quickly adapt processes with the ability to more cost-effectively design and build better applications &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bpmeverywhere.com|title= BPM Everywhere}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Palmer views this as one most significant shifts in the way applications are currently built, as well as shift for 3-tier to 4-tier architectures.

The impact of [[Internet of Things|IoT]] on the business world in the coming decade has been compared to the impact of smart phones on the previous decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.information-age.com/technology/mobile-and-networking/123457785/next-big-thing-preparing-internet-things-enterprise|title= Next big thing: Preparing for the Internet of Things in the enterprise}}&lt;/ref&gt;   BPME is one among several potential resolution strategies, which includes Social internet of Things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.social-iot.org/|title= Social internet of Things}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surendra Reddy, CEO of Quantiply said "People, Things and Processes that run in this connected world leave behind vast digital footprints of these processes, things, people, interactions, and daily rhythms of the society. As a result, the Internet is a powerful tool to persuade, connect and engage humans and things alike serving as the common fabric of interconnection among everything".{{cn|date=March 2017}} Whilst Nathaniel Palmer suggests "Not even the emergence of the Web and Internet-based “digital native” business models can compare with the level of intimacy now available with your customers".{{cn|date=March 2017}}

'''Bill of IT''' is an exhaustive list of IT [[asset]]s and services owned by a company. The bill displays a breakdown of all the IT assets and services in relation to various items.The bill is often used by companies as a [[IT chargeback and showback|chargeback and showback]] tool because it shows the relation between specific service/asset and employee, cost center, department, location, line of business, etc. It allows companies to see what they own and how their resources are allocated in the organizations. Most bills of IT show the following element (among other details):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.cimpl.com/what-is-a-bill-of-it-and-why-is-it-important|title=What is a Bill of IT and Why is it Important?|last=Cheang|first=Henry|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Cost - What each asset/service cost (price per unit)
* Price- The price of each service/asset multiply by the quantity of service/asset (predefined unit rate)
* Budget -The full budget (cost) associated with the use of this service/asset for a year or any chosen reporting period
* Quality -The quality of the service/asset is shown through various metrics: uptime, response time (with support), etc.
* Benchmarking - Comparison of this service/asset to the company’s benchmarks (use, efficiency, etc.)

Ultimately, the goal of a bill of IT is to clarify IT investments in an organization by presenting a detailed view of IT expenses.

In 2014, she launched her own [[Cosmetics|make-up]] brand ''Lashed by Blac Chyna'' and a beauty salon in [[Encino, Los Angeles]].

==Career==
Chyna began stripping in Maryland to pay for college tuition. While attending [[Johnson &amp; Wales University]] in [[Miami]], she resumed stripping but was too exhausted to attend classes. She dropped out after repeatedly falling asleep in class, focusing instead on stripping and modeling. She borrowed the name "Blac Chyna" from a customer. While stripping at a popular Miami club, her exotic look made her popular; radio host [[Angela Yee]] described her as looking "like someone who was going to be famous."&lt;ref name="Elle"/&gt; In 2010, [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]] name-dropped her in "[[Miss Me]]".&lt;ref name="Elle"/&gt; Her rising popularity led to modeling jobs on the covers of ''Dimepiece'', ''Straight Stuntin'' and ''Black Men's Magazine''. Later in 2010, she was cast as [[Nicki Minaj]]'s stunt double in ''[[Monster (Kanye West song)|Monster]]''.&lt;ref name="Cosmo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a10300383/who-is-blac-chyna/|title=Blac Chyna's rise to fame is actually really interesting|last=Baxter-Wright|first=Dusty|work=[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]|date=July 13, 2017|accessdate=February 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In February 2013, Chyna enrolled in JLS Professional Make Up Artist School. In December 2013, she launched her online boutique entitled "88fin", filled with new clothing and products from her clothing line of the same name. That same month, Chyna launched her own brand of adhesive eyelashes called "''LASHED by Blac Chyna''". In February 2014, Chyna purchased a beauty bar in [[Encino, Los Angeles]], offering makeup courses.&lt;ref name="Cosmo"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Chyna said rapper [[Tyga]] asked her to join him on tour in 2011, but she refused. The following year, she appeared in his video "[[Rack City]]" and began a relationship with him.&lt;ref name="Elle"/&gt; Their son, King Cairo Stevenson, was born on October 16, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1695694/tyga-first-baby/|title=Tyga Welcomes His First Baby – MTV|last=Bobb|first=Maurice|work=[[MTV]]|date=November 16, 2012|accessdate=November 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two split in 2014 when he reportedly began a relationship with [[Kylie Jenner]]. Chyna and Jenner feuded with each other over social media, but Chyna mended her relationship with the Kardashians after she began dating Jenner's half-brother, [[Rob Kardashian]], in 2016.&lt;ref name="Elle"/&gt; Their daughter, Dream Renée Kardashian, was born on November 10, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/parents/rob-kardashian-blac-chyna-welcome-baby-daughter-dream-t104894|title=Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna welcome baby daughter, Dream|last=Vivinetto|first=Gina|work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|NBC Today]]|date=November 10, 2016|accessdate=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, Kardashian announced on his Instagram post that he and Chyna split.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/rob-kardashian-announces-blac-chyna-split-on-instagram-1.3208570|title=Rob Kardashian announces Blac Chyna split on Instagram|work=[[CTV News]]|date=December 18, 2016|accessdate=May 2, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170604143527/https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/rob-kardashian-announces-blac-chyna-split-on-instagram-1.3208570|archivedate=June 4, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; They reconciled a few days after but separated again in February 2017. In July 2017, Rob Kardashian posted sexually explicit photos of Blac Chyna onto social media. This action led Chyna to obtain a temporary restraining order against Kardashian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-kardashian-restraining-order-20170710-story.html|title='Devastated' Blac Chyna wins temporary restraining order against Rob Kardashian in sex images case|last=Winton|first=Richard|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 10, 2017|accessdate=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deepwater Horizon oil spill==
{{Main|Deepwater Horizon oil spill}}
On 16 June 2010, Svanberg met with US President [[Barack Obama]] to discuss BP's responsibility for the effects of the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]]. He caused a PR uproar by afterwards expressing BP's concern for the common people along the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]] whose livelihood is threatened by the oil spill by saying, "We care about the small people", drawing upon a Swedish phrase, ''den lilla människan''. The correct translation of the Swedish phrase would have been "the common person". Svanberg subsequently apologized for the term and attributed his unfortunate choice of words to a "slip in translation".&lt;ref&gt;Ann Gerhart.

'''''Chairman of the Board''''' is a 1998 comedy film directed by [[Alex Zamm]], starring [[Courtney Thorne-Smith]] and [[Carrot Top]]. In the film, a surfer and inventor named Edison inherits and runs a billionaire's company. It was poorly received by both critics and audiences.

==Plot==
Edison (Carrot Top) is a poor, failed inventor and surf bum, but soon runs into and befriends wealthy business magnate Armand McMillan ([[Jack Warden]]). When Armand passes away shortly thereafter, he leaves Edison the majority of shares in his large invention corporation, and leaves Bradford ([[Larry Miller (entertainer)|Larry Miller]]), his jealous nephew and only living relative, a surfboard as his only inheritance. Bradford attempts to derail Edison's success by stealing his formula for non-toxic [[Phosphorescence|glow in the dark]] [[gunge|gunk]] and sharing it with a consumer who covers himself in it and alleges that Edison's prize invention—a portable TV/[[TV dinner]] combo—leaks radiation. When Edison reveals the truth (and proves it with another invention), the company is saved, Bradford is arrested, Grace Kosik made a deal with the company and she will testify against Bradford, and Edison appoints his girlfriend Natalie Stockwell ([[Courtney Thorne-Smith]]) to run the company.

==Reception==
''Chairman of the Board'' has received negative reviews, currently holding a [[Rotten Tomatoes]] approval rating of 13%.

During a promotional appearance for the film on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', Thorne-Smith was the second guest after comedian [[Norm Macdonald]], who frequently interrupted Thorne-Smith's attempt to promote the movie with jokes about Carrot Top and the movie failing at the box office, going so far as to say that the film's title should be "Box Office Poison", and claimed the title is spelled "Chairman of the Bored".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL0WayC7jW0|title=norm saves the interview|accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to the apparent surprise and amusement of O'Brien, the audience, and even Thorne-Smith. This interview was selected as a top moment from ''Late Night'' in several compilation episodes and specials. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F6dXcW-_Fc |title=YouTube: Courtney Thorne-Smith and Norm Macdonald on Conan in 1997 |accessdate=2018-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedian and former ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' host [[Michael J. Nelson]] named the film the fifth worst comedy ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cracked.com/article_15047_inoperable-humor-5-worst-comedies-all-time.html |title=Inoperable Humor: The 5 Worst Comedies of All Time |accessdate=2007-03-26 |last=Nelson |first=Michael J |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher=''[[Cracked (magazine)|Cracked]]'' |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently among the 100 lowest rated movies on IMDb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/chart/bottom?tt0118836&amp;ref_=tt_awd|title=IMDb Charts: IMDb Bottom 100|accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''chief services officer''' ('''CSO''') is a position at the head of a firm carrying significant service design responsibilities. The CSO typically is responsible for developing processes and tools, both internally and externally, for producing maximum value to all stakeholders with intelligent and efficient use of potentially fluctuating human resources.

In some organizations, the same person may hold this title along with that of [[chief operations officer]] (COO) as they both are same level roles. Alternatively, a company could have one or the other, or both occupied by separate people. Often, a CSO exists in heavily client-focussed companies, while a COO exists in [[product development]] focused companies. A CSO almost always has a strong operations background and advanced degree, whereas a COO often has a background in business development. Both CSO and COO report to the [[CEO]] or managing director of a company.

'''''Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration''''' is a book, written by Amy Wallace&lt;!--NOT [[Amy Wallace]]. They are both authors from LA, but they are different people.--&gt; and [[Edwin Catmull]], about managing creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/book-review-creativity-inc-by-ed-catmull-with-amy-wallace-9238922.html|title=Book review: Creativity, Inc By Ed Catmull, with Amy Wallace|date=2014-04-05|language=en-GB|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In the book, Catmull narrates growing up idolizing Walt Disney and earning degrees in physics and computer science at the [[University of Utah]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/ed-catmull/creativity-inc/|title=CREATIVITY, INC. by Ed Catmull , Amy Wallace {{!}} Kirkus Reviews|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he was born in West Virginia, Catmull moved to Utah as a child. Despite his interests in animation, he became pursued at talent in math and studied physics and computer science during college.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303325204579463560455105746|title=Book Review: 'Creativity, Inc.' by Ed Catmull|last=Pinkerton|first=Stewart|date=2014-04-11|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, this led him to a graduate degree under [[Ivan Sutherland]], the "father of computer graphics," also at the University of Utah. Many decades before computer animation existed, Catmull began developing the programming to do 2D and 3D programming. During this time, he found himself recruited to work at [[Lucasfilm]], becoming vice president of Industrial Light and Magic's computer graphics division, until 1986 when a [[Steve Jobs]] bought it up and started Pixar. Catmull soon became Chief Technical Officer.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2008/09/how-pixar-fosters-collective-creativity|title=How Pixar Fosters Collective Creativity|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

''[[The New York Times]]'' said, "Catmull's book is quickly becoming the latest bible for the show business crowd." The book has also garnered positive reviews from ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', and ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-8129-9301-1|title=Nonfiction Book Review: Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration by Ed Catmull|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ig.ft.com/sites/business-book-award/books/2014/shortlist/creativity-inc-by-ed-catmull-and-amy-wallace|title=Creativity, Inc by Ed Catmull, Amy Wallace|last=Graphics|first=FT Interactive|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8471">{{About|deferred tax as an accounting concept|deferral of tax liabilities in cash-flow terms|tax deferral}}

{{accounting}}

A notional asset or liability to reflect corporate income taxation on a basis that is the same or more similar to recognition of profits than the taxation treatment.  '''Deferred tax''' liabilities can arise as a result of corporate taxation treatment of capital expenditure being more rapid than the accounting depreciation treatment. Deferred tax assets can arise due to net loss carry-overs, which are only recorded as asset if it is deemed more likely than not that the asset will be used in future fiscal periods. Different countries may also allow or require discounting of the assets or particularly liabilities. There are often disclosure requirements for potential liabilities and assets that are not actually recognised as an asset or liability.

== Permanent and Temporary differences==
If an item in the profit and loss account is never chargeable or allowable for tax or is chargeable or allowable for tax purposes but never appears in the profit and loss account then this is a permanent difference. A permanent difference does not give rise to deferred tax.

If items are chargeable or allowable for tax purposes but in different periods to when the income or expense is recognised then this gives rise to temporary differences. Temporary difference do give rise to potential deferred tax, but the rules on whether the deferred asset or liability is actually recognised can vary.

Temporary differences are usually calculated on the differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability recognized in the statements of financial position and the amount attributed to that asset or liability for tax at the beginning and end of the year. The differences in the charges to the profit and loss account compared to the amounts taxable or allowable can also be calculated and should reconcile the change in position at the beginning and end of the year.&lt;ref name="IAS 12.5"&gt;IAS 12.5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===
The basic principle of accounting for deferred tax under a temporary difference approach can be illustrated using a common example in which a company has fixed assets that qualify for tax depreciation.

The following example assumes that a company purchases an asset for $1,000 which is depreciated for accounting purposes on a straight-line basis of five years of $200/year. The company claims tax depreciation of 25% per year on a reducing balance basis. The applicable rate of [[corporate income tax]] is assumed to be 35%, and the net value is subtracted.

|-
! Deferred tax liability/(asset) at 35%

|}

As the tax value, or [[tax base]], is lower than the accounting value, or [[book value]], in years 1 and 2, the company should recognize a deferred tax liability. This also reflects that the company has claimed tax depreciation in excess of the expense for accounting depreciation recorded in its accounts, whereas in the future the company should claim less tax depreciation in total than accounting depreciation in its accounts.

In years 3 and 4, the tax value exceeds the accounting value, therefore the company should recognise a deferred tax asset (subject to it having sufficient forecast profits so that it is able to use future tax deductions). This reflects that the company expects to be able to claim tax depreciation in excess of accounting depreciation.

== Timing differences ==

In many cases the deferred tax outcome will be similar for a temporary difference or timing difference approach. However, differences can arise such as in relation to [[revaluation]] of [[fixed assets]] qualifying for [[tax base|tax depreciation]], which gives rise to a deferred tax asset under a balance sheet approach, but in general should have no impact under a timing difference approach.

== Justification for deferred tax accounting==

Deferred tax is relevant to the matching principle.

== Examples ==

=== Deferred tax liabilities ===

Deferred tax liabilities generally arise where tax relief is provided in advance of an accounting expense/unpaid liabilities, or income is [[accrue]]d but not taxed until  received

=== Deferred tax assets ===

Deferred tax assets generally arise where tax relief is provided after an expense is deducted for accounting purposes:

* a company may [[accrue]] an accounting expense in relation to a [[provision (accounting)|provision]] such as bad debts, but tax relief may not be obtained until the provision is utilized
* a company may incur tax losses and be able to "carry forward" losses to reduce taxable income in future years..

An asset on a company's balance sheet that may be used to reduce any subsequent period's income tax expense. Deferred tax assets can arise due to net loss carryover.

== Deferred tax in modern accounting standards ==

Modern accounting standards typically require that a company provides for deferred tax in accordance with either the [[#temporary differences|temporary difference]] or [[#Timing differences|timing difference]] approach. Where a deferred tax liability or asset is recognised, the liability or asset should reduce over time (subject to new differences arising) as the temporary or timing difference reverses.

Under [[International Financial Reporting Standards]], deferred tax should be accounted for using the principles in [[IAS 12]]: Income Taxes, which is similar (but not identical) to [[SFAS 109]] under [[US GAAP]]. Both these accounting standards require a [[#temporary differences|temporary difference]] approach.

Other accounting standards which deal with deferred tax include:

* '''[[UK GAAP]]''' - [[Financial Reporting Standard 19: Deferred Tax]] ([[#Timing differences|timing difference approach]])
* '''Mexican GAAP or PCGA''' - Boletín D-4, el impuesto sobre la renta diferido
* '''[[Canadian GAAP]]''' - [[Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants|CICA]] Section 3465
* '''[[Russia]]n PBU 18 (2002)''' ''Accounting for profit tax'' ([[#Timing differences|timing difference approach]])
*'''[[INDIAN AS]]'''-[[Institute Of Charted Account of India -AS 22 Accounting for taxes on income]]

== Derecognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities ==
Management has an obligation to accurately report the true state of the company, and to make judgements and estimations where necessary. In the context of tax assets and liabilities, there must be a reasonable likelihood that the tax difference may be realised in future years.

For example, a tax asset may appear on the company's accounts due to losses in previous years (if carry-forward of tax losses is allowed). In this case a deferred tax asset should be recognised if and only if the management considered that there will be sufficient future taxable profit to use the tax loss.&lt;ref&gt;IAS 12.34&lt;/ref&gt; If it becomes clear that the company does not expect to make profits in future years, the value of the tax asset has been ''impaired'': in the estimation of management, the likelihood that this [[tax loss]] can be used in the future has significantly fallen.

In cases where the carrying value of tax assets or liabilities has changed, the company may need to do a [[write down]], and in certain cases involving in particular a fundamental error, a restatement of its financial results from previous years. Such write-downs may involve either significant income or expenditure being recorded in the company's profit and loss for the financial year in which the write-down takes place.

[[File:antifoam.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Dosage of defoamer]]
A '''defoamer''' or an '''anti-foaming agent''' is a chemical additive that reduces and hinders the formation of [[foam]] in [[industrial process]] liquids. The terms anti-foam agent and defoamer are often used interchangeably. Commonly used agents are insoluble oils, polydimethylsiloxanes and other silicones, certain alcohols, stearates and glycols. The additive is used to prevent formation of foam or is added to break a foam already formed.

In industrial processes, foams pose serious problems.  They cause defects on surface coatings and prevent the efficient filling of containers.  A variety of chemical formulae are available to prevent formation of foams.&lt;ref&gt;Rainer Höfer, Franz Jost, Milan J. Schwuger, Rolf Scharf, Jürgen Geke, Josef Kresse, Herbert Lingmann, Rudolf Veitenhansl and Werner Erwied "Foams and Foam Control" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2000, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a11_465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
Generally a defoamer is insoluble in the foaming medium and has surface active properties. An essential feature of a defoamer product is a low [[viscosity]] and a facility to spread rapidly on foamy surfaces. It has affinity to the air-liquid surface where it destabilizes the foam [[:wikt:lamella|lamella]]s. This causes rupture of the air bubbles and breakdown of surface foam. Entrained air bubbles are agglomerated, and the larger bubbles rise to the surface of the bulk liquid more quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www4.ncsu.edu/~hubbe/DFOM.htm | author = Martin Hubbe, NC State University | title = Mini-Encyclopedia of Papermaking Wet-End Chemistry | accessdate = Nov 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first defoamers were aimed at breaking down visible foam at the surface. [[Kerosene]], [[fuel oil]] and other light oil products were used to break down foam. [[Vegetable oil]]s also found some use. Fatty [[alcohol]]s (C7 – C22) were effective but expensive antifoams. They were added to oil products to boost the efficiency.  [[Milk]] and [[cream]] were forebears for modern day emulsion type defoamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= |first1= |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first= P.R.|editor1-last= Garret |editor1-link= |others= |title= Defoaming. Theory and Industrial Applications |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= Surfactant Science Series |volume= 45 |date= |year= 1992 |month= |origyear= |publisher= CRC Press |location= |isbn= 0-8247-8770-6 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= |pages=164 |chapter=3 |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1950s, experiments with [[silicone]] based defoamers started. These were based on [[polydimethylsiloxane]] (silicone oil) dispersed in water or light oil. Silicone oils worked well, but caused surface disturbances in many applications like [[paint]]s and [[papermaking]]. In 1963 the first antifoams with [[hydrophobic]] particles ([[hydrophobic silica]]) in [[Mineral oil|light oil]] were patented. In the early 1970s, hydrophobic waxes like [[ethylene bis stearamide]] dispersed in oils developed. These types of defoamers were very efficient, but the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis of 1973]] made these too expensive and resulted in a push for reduction of the oil content. The solution was adding [[water]]. So water extended (water in oil emulsion) and water based (oil in water emulsion) defoamers appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= |first1= |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first= P.R.|editor1-last= Garret |editor1-link= |others= |title= Defoaming.

The development of silicone based defoamers has continued, using different emulsifiers and modified silicone oils. In the early 1990s, silicone emulsion defoamers that caused less surface disturbances were used in the [[wood pulp]]ing industry with great success. These caused better washing, reduced [[biological oxygen demand]] (BOD) in [[effluent]] and reduced deposits.

===Oil based defoamers===
Oil based defoamers have an oil carrier. The oil might be [[mineral oil]], [[vegetable oil]], [[white oil]] or any other oil that is insoluble in the foaming medium, except [[silicone oil]]. An oil based defoamer also contains a [[wax]] and/or [[hydrophobic silica]] to boost the performance. Typical waxes are [[ethylene bis stearamide]] (EBS), [[paraffin wax]]es, [[ester wax]]es and [[fatty alcohol]] waxes. These products might also have surfactants to improve [[emulsification]] and spreading in the foaming medium.

These are heavy duty defoamers and are normally best at knocking down surface foam.

===Powder defoamers===
Powder defoamers are in principle oil based defoamers on a particulate carrier like [[silica]]. These are added to powdered products like [[cement]], [[plaster]] and [[detergent]]s.

===Water based defoamers===
Water based defoamers are different types of oils and waxes dispersed in a water base. The oils are often mineral oil or vegetable oils and the waxes are long chain [[fatty alcohol]], [[fatty acid]] [[soap]]s or [[ester]]s. These are normally best as [[deaerator]]s, which means they are best at releasing entrained air.

===Silicone based defoamers===
[[Silicone]]-based defoamers are polymers with silicon backbones. These might be delivered as an oil or a water based emulsion. The silicone compound consists of an [[hydrophobic silica]] dispersed in a [[silicone oil]]. Emulsifiers are added to ensure that the silicone spreads fast and well in the foaming medium. The silicone compound might also contain [[silicone glycol]]s and other modified [[silicone]] fluids.&lt;ref&gt;Rainer Höfer, Franz Jost, Milan J. Schwuger, Rolf Scharf, Jürgen Geke, Josef Kresse, Herbert Lingmann, Rudolf Veitenhansl and Werner Erwied "Foams and Foam Control" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2000, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a11_465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These are also heavy duty defoamers and are good at both knocking down surface foam and releasing entrained air.
[[File:PmdsStructure.png|thumb|[[Polydimethylsiloxane]] is a widely used antifoaming agent.]]
Silicone based defoamers are also suitable in non-aqueous foaming systems like [[crude oil]] and [[oil refining]]. For very demanding applications [[fluorosilicone]]s may be suitable.

===EO/PO based defoamers===
EO/PO based defoamers contain [[polyethylene glycol]] and [[polypropylene glycol]] [[copolymer]]s. They are delivered as oils, water solutions, or water based emulsions. EO/PO copolymers normally have good dispersing properties and are often well suited when deposit problems are an issue.

===Alkyl polyacrylates===
Alkyl [[polyacrylate]]s are suitable for use as defoamers in non-aqueous systems where air release is more important than the breakdown of surface foam. These defoamers are often delivered in a [[solvent]] carrier like [[petroleum]] distillates.

==Industrial problems==
The most noticeable form of foam is foam floating on the stock surface. It is easy to monitor and relatively easy to handle and is more a cosmetic issue.  Surface foam may cause problems with liquid levels and give overflow leading to pools of oils around the equipment which is a safety concern.&lt;Ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://learnoilanalysis.com/foaming-how-to-prevent-and-cure/|title=Foaming oil how to prevent and cure{{!}} Learn Oil Analysis|website=learnoilanalysis.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, this might reduce the process speed and availability of process equipment. The main mechanical problem tends to be when foam enters the system as air is a poor lubricant, meaning metal to metal contact can occur.&lt;Ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://learnoilanalysis.com/foaming-how-to-prevent-and-cure/|title=Foaming oil how to prevent and cure{{!}} Learn Oil Analysis|website=learnoilanalysis.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Mechanical problem factors===
Mechanical factors that may generate foam and entrapped air:

* Leaky seals on pumps
* High pressure pumps
* Poor system design (tank, pump inlet, outlet and [[Manifold_(fluid_mechanics)|manifold]] design)
* [[Pressure]] release

The main classes of air that are of concern to the mechanical systems are:

* Dissolved air behaves as part of the fluid phase, except that it can come out of solution as small bubbles (entrained air)
* Entrained air consists of bubbles that are small enough to collect on top of a fluid
* [[liquid bubble|Bubbles]] that have sufficient [[buoyancy]] to rise to the surface and are described as foam

===Foam in process and coolant liquids===
Foam, entrained and dissolved air that are present in coolants and processing liquids, may cause various kinds of problems, including:

* Reduction of [[pump]] efficiency ([[cavitation]])
* Reduced capacity of [[pumps]] and [[storage tank]]s
* [[Bacteria]]l growth
* Dirt [[flotation process|flotation]] / [[Fouling|deposit]] formation
* Reduced effectiveness of the fluid solution(s)
* Eventual downtime to clean tanks
* Drainage problems in [[sieve]]s and [[filtration|filter]]s
* [[:wikt:formation|Formation]] problems (i.e. in a [[paper mill]] it may cause the [[fibers]] to form an [[inhomogeneous]] sheet)
* Cost of replenishing the liquid
* Cost of entire material rejection due to imperfections

==Test methods==
There are several ways to test defoamers.

The easiest is looking at the surface foam. All that is needed is a system for generating foam. This might be done with a round pumping system with a nozzle and a cylinder or an air injection system into a cylinder. The cylinder is fitted with a scale to measure the foam height. This equipment may have a heater to control the temperature.

Entrained air can be tested with similar equipment that has a [[density]] meter that can record changes of the liquor density over time.

Drainage can be tested with a [[Filtration|filter]] system for measuring the time to drain a liquid through the filter. The filter might be pressurized or have a [[vacuum]].

==Applications==

===Detergents===
Anti-foams are added in certain types of [[detergent]]s to reduce [[foam]]ing that might decrease the action of the detergent. For example, [[dishwasher]] detergents have to be low foaming for the dishwasher to work properly.

===Food===
When used as an ingredient in [[food]], antifoaming agents are intended to curb [[effusion]] or [[Effervescence (chemistry)|effervescence]] in preparation or serving.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The agents are included in a variety of foods such as [[chicken nuggets]] in the form of [[polydimethylsiloxane]] (a type of [[silicone]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=McDonald's |title=McDonald's USA Ingredients Listing for Popular Menu Items |url=http://www.mcdonalds.com/app_controller.nutrition.categories.ingredients.index.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513044750/http://www.mcdonalds.com/app_controller.nutrition.categories.ingredients.index.html |archivedate=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Archive.org |title=Archive of the above |url=http://www.mcdonalds.com/app_controller.nutrition.categories.ingredients.index.html#2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324052825/http://www.mcdonalds.com/app_controller.nutrition.categories.ingredients.index.html |archivedate=March 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Silicone oil]] is also added to [[cooking oil]] to prevent foaming in [[deep-frying]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===Industrial use===
Defoamers are used in many industrial processes and products: [[wood pulp]], [[paper]], [[paint]], [[industrial wastewater treatment]], [[food processing]], [[oil drilling]], [[machine tool]] industry, oils cutting [[tools]], [[hydraulics]], etc.

===Pharmaceuticals===
Antifoaming agents are also sold commercially to relieve [[bloating]].  A familiar example is the drug [[Simethicone]], which is the active ingredient in drugs such as [[Maalox]], [[Mylanta]], and [[Gas-X]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

'''Demeter International''' is the largest certification organization for [[biodynamic agriculture]], and is one of three predominant organic certifiers.&lt;ref name=coffee&gt;Commission for Environmental Cooperation and TerraChoice Environmental Services Inc, ''Environmental and Other Labelling of Coffee: the role of mutual recognition, supporting cooperative action'', May 2004. [http://crdi.org/uploads/user-S/11278532171sci_coffee_labelling.pdf Document text] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207122045/http://crdi.org/uploads/user-S/11278532171sci_coffee_labelling.pdf |date=February 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name is a reference to [[Demeter]], the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[goddess]] of [[grain]] and [[fertility]]. Demeter Biodynamic Certification is used in over 50 countries to verify that biodynamic products meet international standards in production and processing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140530033038/http://biodynamic.org.nz/demeter.html Demeter certification in New Zealand]&lt;/ref&gt; The Demeter certification program was established in 1928, and as such was the first ecological label for organically produced foods.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Diver, ''Biodynamic Farming &amp; Compost Preparation'', Alternative Farming Systems Guide: ATTRA, February 1999. [http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/PDF/biodynam.pdf Document text]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Certification is difficult to come by and must be renewed annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sonoma/08.31.05/dining-0535.html ''Biodynamic Berries: Ancient ways are the next step in organic winemaking'']&lt;/ref&gt; Demeter’s “biodynamic” certification requires biodiversity and ecosystem preservation, soil husbandry, livestock integration, prohibition of genetically engineered organisms and viewing the farm as a living “holistic organism”.&lt;ref name=coffee/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://demeter-usa.org/?page_id=5 Overview of Demeter certification requirements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730185553/http://demeter-usa.org/?page_id=5 |date=2007-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The certification verifies the fulfillment of the standards on behalf of the farmers, which in turn guarantees high quality food products to the consumers. This is rewarded by receiving a higher price for food certified with the “Demeter” label, ranging from 10-30% on average.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Rist and Lucas Rist, "Towards a post-materialist understanding of science – lessons learnt form the interface of biodynamic agriculture and research." Presented at conference ''Bridging Scales and Epistemologies: Linking Local Knowledge with Global Science in Multi-Scale Assessments'', March 2004.  [http://www.millenniumassessment.org/documents/bridging/papers/rist.stephan.2.pdf Document text]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The origin of Demeter is a Cooperative for the processing of products of the [[biodynamic agriculture]] created in Berlin, Germany, in 1927. The trademark Demeter was registered in 1928. Demeter was administered by the German agronomist Erhard Bartsch who also directed the Experimental Circle of anthroposophical (biodynamic) farmers, and who had chosen the name Demeter, jointly with the German chemist Franz Dreidax. Dreidax was responsible for the development of the Demeter criteria and the quality control.

The Demeter name was adopted internationally. In Australia, two members of the Experimental Circle, Ernesto Genoni and Ileen Macpherson founded Demeter Biological Farm in Melbourne in 1934 and operated it as a biodynamic farm for two decades (until 1954).&lt;ref&gt;John Paull (2017) [https://www.academia.edu/31572839/Ileen_Macpherson_Life_and_tragedy_of_a_pioneer_of_biodynamic_farming_at_Demeter_Farm_and_a_benefactor_of_Anthroposophy_in_Australia  Ileen Macpherson: Life and tragedy of a pioneer of biodynamic farming at Demeter Farm and a benefactor of Anthroposophy in Australia], Journal of Organics, 4(1):29-56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Paull (2017) [http://orgprints.org/32143/1/Paull2017.Demeter.JBDT.pdf Australia’s original Demeter Farm (1934-1954)], Journal of Biodynamics Tasmania, 123:16-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demeter ceased temporarily to exist in 1941 when the Nazi Government dissolved the Union for biodynamic agriculture. It was reestablished in Germany after the Second World War. In 1997 19 independent Demeter organisations came together to establish Demeter International. All continents were represented.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The '''Edwin F. Guth Memorial Award for Interior Lighting Design''' is one of the Illumination Awards presented each year by the [[Illuminating Engineering Society]] (IES). The Guth award honors the memory of the eponymous entrepreneur who acquired in his lifetime 147 patents related to the improvement of interior lighting. The award itself, “recognizes exceptional interior lighting projects that balance the functional illumination of space with the artistic application of light to enhance the occupant’s experience.”&lt;ref name=Awards&gt;{{cite web | url= http://ies.org/ia/award-categories.cfm | title=Explore IES | publisher=Illuminating Engineering Society | accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Judging criteria==

The judging criteria for the Guth Award are divided into three categories—Problem, Concept, and Solution—as well a discretionary bonus for unusual excellence. 
Judges first evaluate the project based on the complexity of the problem at hand, including the “multiplicity, variety, [and] difficulty of visual tasks; energy limitations; [and] stylistic and structural requirements.” 

Next the project concepts are evaluated, including [architectural lighting design|lighting design] concept, [lighting controls] concept, architectural integration, and originality of the approach.

Finally, the implemented solutions are evaluated on a number of levels, including energy performance and environmental responsibility, visual comfort, achievement of performance criteria, whether the project was within its budget, and ease of maintenance. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.ies.org/PDF/Awards/ia/Guth%20Judging%20Sheet%20Final%20Nov%202011.pdf | title=Edwin F.

The company was founded by [[Torgeir Stensrud]] and [[Trond Kristoffersen]], who were in 2005 convicted on charges of [[fraud]] to 7 and 9 years in prison, respectively. Stensrud and Kristoffersen were also both fined about 100 million €.

==Trond Kristoffersen==
''Trond Kristoffersen'' (13 August 1956 – August 2013) was co-founder of the Finance Credit, Norwegian businessman and convicted [[fraudster]].

[[File:Negative (4108770187).jpg|thumb|1922 building]]
The '''George Gustav Heye Center''' is a branch of the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ny.com/museums/national.museum.of.the.american.indian.html | title=National Museum of the American Indian | publisher=NY.com | accessdate=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum is part of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].  The Center features contemporary and historical exhibits of art and artifacts by and about [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].

==History==
The center is named for [[George Gustav Heye]], who began collecting Native American artifacts in 1903. He founded and endowed the Museum of the American Indian in 1916, and it opened in 1922, in a building at 155th Street and Broadway, part of the [[Audubon Terrace]] complex, in the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan| Washington Heights]] neighborhood of [[upper Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Thomas (April 13, 1988). "[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/13/nyregion/a-cramped-museum-filled-with-indian-history.html A Cramped Museum Filled With Indian History]". ''New York Times''. nytimes.com. Retrieved November 3, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; That museum closed in 1994 and part of the collection is now housed at the [[Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House]] on [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]] in [[Lower Manhattan]].  The [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts-style]] building, designed by architect [[Cass Gilbert]], was completed in 1907. It is a designated National Historic Landmark and a New York City landmark.  The center’s exhibition and public access areas total about {{convert|20000|sqft|m2}}. The Heye Center offers a range of exhibitions, film and video screenings, school group programs and living culture presentations throughout the year.

==Galleries==
The permanent collection of the Heye Center is called Infinity of Nations, and is designed to show the scope of the Smithsonian's collection. Organized by geographic regions (including Central and South America), the exhibit displays over 700 items and crosses the line from ethnology to art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/06/arts/design/06infinity.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;src=twrhp&amp;adxnnlx=1337801080-pTQulrUTWUPRUkAapqykaA | title=Grace and Culture Intertwined | publisher=New York Times | date=November 5, 2010 | accessdate=May 23, 2012 | author=Cotter, Holland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nmai.si.edu/explore/exhibitions/item/?id=901 | title=Infinity of Nations | publisher= National Museum of the American Indian | accessdate=May 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Multimedia interactions include audio and video, and feature commentary by historians on specific objects. The rotunda is frequently used as a performance space, and features murals reflecting the history of the building, done by [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]]. Other galleries include the Photography Gallery, Special Exhibit Galleries, Contemporary Galleries, the Haudenosaunee Discovery Room, the Resource Center Reference Library, a small theater (which screens daily films), and the museum store. The ground floor of the building houses the Diker Pavilion for Native Arts and Culture and the Education Center (referred to as the Tipi Room).

==Drug candidates==

===Cancer therapies===

Geron Corporation has sponsored human clinical trials of several anti-cancer products. 
* GRN163L (Imetelstat), is a drug that targets telomerase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Imetelstat Sodium|url=https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-drug?cdrid=447136|website=NCI Drug Dictionary|publisher=National Cancer Institute|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In studies conducted at [[Johns Hopkins University]], GRN163L was active against both CD138+ and CD138neg cancer stem cells and eliminated the colony forming potential of both by five weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brennan|first1=Sarah K.|last2=Wang|first2=Qiuju|last3=Tressler|first3=Robert|last4=Harley|first4=Calvin|last5=Go|first5=Ning|last6=Bassett|first6=Ekaterina|last7=Huff|first7=Carol Ann|last8=Jones|first8=Richard J.|last9=Matsui|first9=William|last10=Swarbrick|first10=Alexander|title=Telomerase Inhibition Targets Clonogenic Multiple Myeloma Cells through Telomere Length-Dependent and Independent Mechanisms|journal=PLoS ONE|date=1 September 2010|volume=5|issue=9|pages=e12487|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0012487|pmid=20824134|pmc=2931698}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, GRN163L inhibited the ''[[in vitro]]'' clonogenic growth of CD138neg Multiple Myeloma Cancer Stem Cells isolated from the bone marrow aspirates of patients with [[multiple myeloma]]. On November 3, 2014, the [[FDA]] removed the full clinical hold on imetelstat and declared the company's clinical development plan as acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/11/03/why-geron-corporation-shares-skyrocketed.aspx|title=Why Geron Corporation Shares Skyrocketed|date=November 3, 2014 |author=Alex Planes|work=The Motley Fool}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:In November 2014 Geron entered into a licensing and collaboration agreement with [[Johnson and Johnson]]'s biotech division ([[Janssen Biotech]]) to develop and commercialize GRN163L.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ir.geron.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=67323&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1989673|title=Geron Announces Global Strategic Collaboration with Janssen to Develop and Commercialize Imetelstat |website=Investor Relations: Press Release|publisher=Geron|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two active Phase 2 trials for GRN163L are scheduled for completion in 2019 and 2022, one for [[Myelofibrosis]] and the other for [[Myelodysplastic Syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=&amp;term=grn163l&amp;cntry=&amp;state=&amp;city=&amp;dist=|title=Search of: grn163l - List Results - ClinicalTrials.gov|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A trial of GRNVAC1, a telomerase vaccine being used on patients with [[prostate cancer]] was carried out at [[Duke University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harley|first1=Calvin B.|title=Telomerase and cancer therapeutics|journal=Nature Reviews Cancer|date=March 2008|volume=8|issue=3|pages=167–179|doi=10.1038/nrc2275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geron's progress with telomerase vaccines attracted a modest monetary investment in 2005 from [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2005/09/12/daily2.html | title=Geron plans stock offering, Merck buying $18M in shares | date=12 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*GRN1005, an LRP-directed conjugate of [[paclitaxel]], was in phase II clinical trials for brain cancer but discontinued based on preliminary results in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geron Scraps GRN1005, Cuts Jobs|url=https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/88169/geron-scraps-grn1005-cuts-jobs|website=Zacks Investment Research|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Geron exclusively licensed imetelstat to [[Janssen Biotech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fitzhugh|first1=Michael|title='New chapter' as Geron lands potential $935M imetelstat deal with Janssen|url=http://www.bioworld.com/content/new-chapter-geron-lands-potential-935m-imetelstat-deal-janssen-0|work=BioWorld|date=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This partnership was ended by Janssen on Sep 28th, 2018.

===Telomerase activation===

In addition to testing drug candidates that exploit cancer cell's dependence on telomerase, Geron is researching the possible applications of activating the enzyme in normal cells to delay cellular [[senescence]].  The company is in the early stages of developing a telomerase based treatment for [[HIV]] called TAT0002, which is the [[saponin]] [[cycloastragenol]] in Chinese herb [[Astragalus propinquus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/181/10/7400 TAT2 (cycloastragenol, CAS Registry no. 84605-18-5)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Geron has granted a license to Telomerase Activation Sciences to sell [[TA-65]], the telomerase activator agent also derived from [[astragalus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Borrell|first1=Brendan|title=Lawsuit challenges anti-ageing claims|url=http://www.nature.com/news/lawsuit-challenges-anti-ageing-claims-1.11090|work=Nature|date=2 August 2012|pages=18–18|doi=10.1038/488018a}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2010 Intertek/AAC Labs, an ISO 17025 internationally recognized lab, found the largest component of TA-65 to be Cycloastragenol.&lt;ref&gt;American Analytical Chemistry Laboratories Analysis Document #100710-236 of [http://www.CycloAstragenol.com/ TA-65]&lt;/ref&gt;

Geron originally investigated telomerase as a means of understanding and modifying human aging. However, Geron has ceased aging research of any kind.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===Stem cell therapies===

On January 23, 2009, Geron received [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approval to begin [[Clinical trial#Phase I|Phase I]] testing of GRNOPC1 in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/technology/2006/07/21/stem-cell-research-cz_kd_0721stemcell.html |work=Forbes |title=Despite Bush Veto, Stem Cell Research Abounds - Forbes.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204143010/http://www.forbes.com/technology/2006/07/21/stem-cell-research-cz_kd_0721stemcell.html |archivedate=February 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  GRNOPC1 is an embryonic stem cell based drug that is designed to treat specific forms of [[spinal cord injury]] through [[remyelination]] of damaged [[axon]]s.  This trial does not involve direct use of stem cells however, as GRNOPC1 is composed of [[oligodendrocyte]] progenitor cells derived from embryonic stem cell lines. Studies have shown significant restoration of mobility in animals with spinal injuries that received cells.&lt;ref name="pmid15888645"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Keirstead HS, Nistor G, Bernal G, etal |title=Human embryonic stem cell-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cell transplants remyelinate and restore locomotion after spinal cord injury |journal=J.

Geron also has several other embryonic [[stem cell treatments]] that are still in the preclinical phase, including GRNCM1, a treatment for [[heart disease]], and GRNIC1, a treatment for [[diabetes]].  In tests with diabetic mice, 80% of the mice given GRNIC1 were still alive in 50 days while the entire control group, which was given no treatment, perished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genengnews.com/news/bnitem.aspx?name=3153413 News: Geron Presents New Data That Document Progress in Development of Therapeutic Products from Human Embryonic Stem Cells. Genetic Engineering &amp; Biotechnology News - Biotechnology from Bench to Business]&lt;/ref&gt;

Geron sold its human stem cell research assets to [[Asterias]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geron Announces Record Date for Distribution of Asterias Series A Common Stock|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/geron-announces-record-date-distribution-113101473.html|website=Yahoo Finance|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====GRNOPC1====
{{main article|Human embryonic stem cells clinical trials#Geron Spinal Cord Injury Trial}}

As of October 2010 and November 2010, One of Geron's most highly publicized trial therapy products has been GRNOPC1, a stem cell therapy designed to heal severe spinal cord injuries.  The cells in the GRNOPC1 therapy have been coaxed into becoming early [[myelinated]] [[glial cells]], a type of cell that insulates [[nerve cells]].  For every GRNOPC1 cell that is injected in the patient, they become six to 10 cells in a few months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pagingdrgupta.blogs.cnn.com/2010/10/11/first-human-injected-in-human-embryonic-stem-cell-trial/?replytocom=86296 CNN Rachel Meade Reports (October 13, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;
In Oct 2011 updated results on 4 patients were released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scimitarequity.com/blog/2011/10/20/geron-gern-updates-clinical-data-from-grnopc1-spinal-cord-injury-trial/ |title=Geron (GERN) updates Clinical Data from GRNOPC1 Spinal Cord Injury Trial |date=20 Oct 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023052613/http://www.scimitarequity.com/blog/2011/10/20/geron-gern-updates-clinical-data-from-grnopc1-spinal-cord-injury-trial/ |archivedate=2011-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial was discontinued in Nov 2011.

In early 2013 [[BioTime]], whose [[CEO]] is Geron founder [[Michael D. West]], acquired 400 patents and other intellectual property related to embryonic stem cells from Geron &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Geron's Stem Cell Program Sold|url= http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/37749/title/Geron-s-Stem-Cell-Program-Sold/ |work= The Scientist |date= October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= BioTime acquires stem cell assets from Geron, raises $10 million|url= http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/biotech/2013/01/biotime-acquires-stem-cell-assets-geron.html |work= San Francisco Business Times |date= January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later went on to restart the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Funding windfall rescues abandoned stem-cell trial|url= http://www.nature.com/news/funding-windfall-rescues-abandoned-stem-cell-trial-1.15350 |work= Nature |date= June 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geron Corporation initially held exclusive rights to three cell types derived from [[embryonic stem cell]]s, as the result of paying for the research originally conducted by [[James Thomson (cell biologist)|Dr. James Thomson]] at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Westhoff|first1=Julia|title=WARF, Geron reach settlement|url=http://badgerherald.com/news/2002/01/22/warf_geron_reach_set.php|work=The Badger Herald|date=22 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patents on the other three cell types are owned by the [[Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation]] (WARF). WARF and Geron did not charge academics to study human stem cells but did charge commercial users. In 2001 WARF came under public pressure to widen access to human stem-cell technology, and they launched legal action against Geron Corporation to recover some of the previously sold rights. The two sides agreed that Geron would keep the rights to only three cell types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Regalado|first1=Antonio|last2=Hamilton|first2=David P.|title=How a University's Patents May Limit Stem-Cell Research|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115319002102509489|work=Wall Street Journal|date=18 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006, a legal challenge was mounted to overturn these patents by [[Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights|The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights]] and the non-profit patent-watchdog [[Public Patent Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kintisch|first1=E.|title=Groups Challenge Key Stem Cell Patents|journal=Science|date=21 July 2006|volume=313|issue=5785|pages=281–281|doi=10.1126/science.313.5785.281|lay-url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2006/07/groups-target-stem-cell-patents|lay-date=18 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; They contended that two of the patents granted to WARF are invalid because they cover a technique published in 1992 for which a patent had already been granted to an Australian researcher. Another part of the challenge came from the molecular biologist [[Jeanne Loring]] who stated that [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] stem cell pioneer [[James Thomson (cell biologist)|James Thomson]]'s techniques (currently patents held by WARF) are rendered obvious by a 1990 paper and two textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Loring|first1=Jeanne|title=A patent challenge for human embryonic stem cell research|url=http://www.nature.com/stemcells/2007/0711/071108/full/stemcells.2007.113.html|work=Nature Reports Stem Cells|date=8 November 2007|doi=10.1038/stemcells.2007.113}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of this legal challenge was particularly relevant to the Geron Corporation as it can only license patents that are upheld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stem Cell Patents Come Under Fire|url=http://www.genetics-and-society.org/newsdisp.asp?id=1039|work=Center for Genetics and Society|agency=Associated Press|date=19 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patents were ultimately upheld when the reexamination concluded in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warf.org/news/news.jsp?news_id=234 WARF press release]&lt;/ref&gt;

As an interim measure, on January 23, 2007 WARF relaxed the stem cell patents, allowing industry-sponsored research at academic and non-profit institutions without a license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Somers|first1=Terri|title=Stem cell scientists shout out hallelujah|url=http://legacy.sandiegouniontribune.com/uniontrib/20070123/news_1b23stems.html|work=The San Diego Union-Tribune|date=23 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; WARF will allow easier and simpler cost free cell transfers among researchers and would not require a license or agreement from California's taxpayer-funded stem cell research program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin Group Eases Stem Cell Patent Restrictions After FTCR|url=http://www.pubpat.org/warfstemcelleased.htm|website=PUBPAT|accessdate=5 September 2013|date=23 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
As a participant in the [[stem cell controversy|then-controversial]] stem cell and cloning area, Geron Corporation was asked to testify about its technology before the U.S. Congress.  In 2001, when Congress was attempting to ban all forms of cloning, then Geron [[chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Thomas Okarma]] spoke before Congress to preserve cloning for therapeutic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/2001/04/05/0305cloning.html | work=Forbes | title=Geron's Cloning Quandary - Forbes.com | date=April 5, 2001| first=Matthew | last=Herper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_22/b3835716.htm |title=Online Extra: Thomas Okarma: Don't Ban Stem-Cell Research |date=2 June 2003 |work=BusinessWeek |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522210421/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_22/b3835716.htm |archive-date=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=House Hearing, 107th Congress - The Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2001 and The Cloning Prohibition Act of 2001 |date=20 June 2001 |url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-107hhrg73733/html/CHRG-107hhrg73733.htm |website=U.S. Government Publishing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Governor Ames''''' was the first five-masted [[schooner]]. In the late 19th century, she was the world's largest cargo vessel.

She was launched on December 1, 1888, by the [[Leavitt-Storer]] [[shipyard]] of [[Waldoboro, Maine]], [[United States]], and was named for [[Oliver Ames (governor)|Oliver Ames]] (then the [[Governor of Massachusetts]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate = 2008-04-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Governor Ames'' was owned and operated by the Atlantic Shipping Company based in [[Somerset, Massachusetts]].

Although the ''Governor Ames'' was the first five-masted schooner, she was preceded by the five-masted [[Great Lakes]] [[barkentine]] ''[[David Dows]]'', which was confusingly called a schooner despite having a square-rigged foremast.  The ''David Dows'' was longer than the ''Governor Ames'' but otherwise smaller.

The schooner's first voyage, in [[sailing ballast|ballast]] to [[Baltimore, Maryland]], resulted in disaster on December 11, 1888, when the foremast snapped in high winds, taking the other masts with it and dismasting the ''Governor Ames'' completely.  The anchor chain also broke, and the schooner ran aground on [[Georges Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 |pages = 2
| format=PDF
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Refloated and towed to port, the vessel was remasted with shorter masts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
following which it sailed from Maine to [[Buenos Aires]] in [[Argentina]] with a cargo of {{convert|1896000|board feet|lk=on}} of [[spruce]] and [[pine]] [[lumber]] valued at $29,868, believed to be the largest or second largest cargo ever taken by an American vessel at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lumber trade proving profitable, she was employed for the next five years in that trade, venturing far away from the Eastern seaboard and its coal trade for which she was built.  She rounded [[Cape Horn]] to bring lumber to [[Redondo Beach, California]], and was then employed [[West coast lumber trade|hauling lumber from Pacific ports]] to [[Australia]].  Returning to the waters of the Eastern United States via Cape Horn once more, she entered the coal trade finally in Fall 1894.&lt;ref name="missing"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 30, 1899, the ''Governor Ames'' grounded in eighteen feet of water near [[Key West, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With assistance from the tug ''Childs'' and other schooners and the jettisoning of {{convert|200|short ton}} of coal, the ''Governor Ames'' was refloated the next afternoon without major damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The ''Governor Ames'' was wrecked in a gale on December 13, 1909, four miles off [[Cape Hatteras]] on the [[North Carolina]] coast, having sailed on December 9 from [[Brunswick, Georgia]], bound for [[New York, New York|New York]] with a cargo of [[railroad tie]]s piled high on her deck.  The schooner was driven onto Wimble Shoals and broke up within two hours.  Thirteen of the fourteen aboard perished, including the master, Captain King, and his wife.  The sole survivor was one Joseph Speering of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

A '''Guarantee of Origin''' ('''GO''' or '''GoO''') is a tracking instruments defined in article 15 of the [[Renewable Energy Directive 2009|European Directive 2009/28/EC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greenfact.com/|title=Greenfact|website=greenfact.com|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A GO labels electricity from renewable sources to provide information to electricity customers on the source of their energy. Guarantees of origin are the only precisely defined instruments evidencing the origin of electricity generated from renewable energy sources.

== Certificate ==
In operation, a GO is a green label or tracker that guarantees that one MWh of electricity has been produced from renewable energy sources. Guarantees of origin are traded. When a company buys guarantees of origin, as documentation for the electricity delivered or consumed, the guarantees of origin are cancelled in the electronic certificate registry.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aib-net.org/certification/c_faq/reliability&lt;/ref&gt; This single standardized instrument makes it possible to track ownership, verify claims and ensure that guarantees of origin are only sold once and that there is no double counting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aib-net.org/certification/c_faq/reliability|title=Reliability &gt;&gt;|website=www.aib-net.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In their most accomplished form, guarantees of origin are issued electronically for a controlled quantity of electricity generation (1 GO per MWh), traded and redeemed (i.e. used) by suppliers as evidence to their customers of the quality of the delivered electricity. Generation from renewable energy sources is the most sought-after attribute. A new development concerns guarantees of origin for cogeneration heat plants (or CHP). Some countries already have guarantees of origin issued for all types of electricity generation.

AIB statistics from 2016 show that Germany, Switzerland, Sweden and the Netherlands are the largest markets for guarantees of origin in Europe. While Europe's biggest market, Germany, halted its rapid growth, the Dutch market continued to grow at a faster pace than the rest, almost reaching 50 TWh in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://renewablesnow.com/news/demand-for-documented-renewable-power-in-europe-continues-to-grow-559820/ |title=Demand for documented renewable power in Europe continues to grow |publisher=Renewablesnow.com |date=2017-02-28 |accessdate=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guarantees of origin should not be confused with the [[Eugene Green Energy Standard]] or [[EKOenergy]] labelling scheme. Both provide consumers with more information about their power ([[transparency (market)|transparency]]). However, Eugene and EKOenergy go further by requiring additionality. Besides, Eugene and EKOenergy are private initiatives whereas guarantees of origin arise from European regulations.&lt;ref&gt;see Directives 2001/77/EC, [[Directive 2004/8/EC|2004/8/EC]] and logically 2003/54/EC, all applicable in the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==
The GO is standardized through the European Energy Certificate System (EECS) provided by the Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB). The [[European Energy Certificate System|EECS]] makes trade, cancelation and use of GOs standardized across AIB members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aib-net.org/certification/introduction/content|title=Content &gt;&gt;|website=www.aib-net.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==

=== Production period ===

Refers to the month and year when the electricity was produced.

=== Issued ===

GOs created in a month for electricity produced in an earlier month.

=== Transfer ===

Transfer is the delivery process of GO from one party to another.

=== Import – export ===

GOs can originate from another country than the country of consumption. GOs can be imported (exported) from another country either via import (export), or via cancellation.

=== Cancellation ===

Cancellation is analogous to physical 'use' of a GO certificate and is the method for allocating the attributes of the electricity to the single end-user. Cancelling a GO is the only way to redeem its benefits while ensuring that the certificate will not be traded, given, sold, or used by another end-user. Consumer information and avoidance of double counting is the main objective of this system.

[[Image:IL Tech &amp; Research Corridor.png|200px|thumb|right|The Illinois Technology and Research Corridor in the [[Chicago metropolitan area]]]]
The '''Illinois Technology and Research Corridor''' is a region of commerce and industry located along [[Interstate 88 (west)|Interstate 88]] in the [[Chicago metropolitan area]], primarily in [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage]], [[Kane County, Illinois|Kane]], and [[DeKalb County, Illinois|DeKalb Counties]].  The corridor is home to the headquarters or regional centers for many Fortune 1000 companies (including many specializing in research, development, logistics, and technology), several office and industrial parks, colleges and universities, research and scientific institutions, medical centers, government centers, and abundant shopping, dining, lodging, and entertainment amenities.  In addition to the I-90 [[Golden Corridor]], the I-94 [[Lakeshore Corridor]], and the I-55 Industrial Corridor, the Illinois Technology and Research Corridor is one of the principal economic centers in suburban Chicago.

S. &amp; A.M. Khademian. 2002. To manage is to govern. ''Public Administration Review'' 62 (5): 529-541.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, M.S., A.M. Khademian, and K.S. Quick. 2009. Ways of knowing, inclusive management, and promoting democratic engagement: An introduction to the special issue. ''International Public Management Journal'' 12 (2): 123-136.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the inclusive management model, managers focus on building the capacity of the public to participate in the policy process. One way this capacity is built is through the structuring and maintenance of relationships by managers. Managers operate in a myriad of relationship structures that are used for making decisions, implementing policy, and identifying public priorities. These relationships give shape, pose constraints, or present opportunities for the way public policy is pursued
== Definition ==

The [[management]] component of the compound idea of inclusive management signifies that inclusion is a managed, ongoing project rather than an attainable state.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martha Feldman|Feldman, M. S.]], and A. M. Khademian. 2000. Managing for inclusion: balancing control and participation. ''International Public Management Journal'' 3 (2): 149-167&lt;/ref&gt;  The inclusion component means something different from the commonplace use of inclusion and exclusion to reference the socioeconomic diversity of the participants.  The understanding of inclusion in this analysis emphasizes diversity in terms of the necessity of a diversity of perspectives to promote civic discovery in a deliberative setting.  Inclusion involves active boundary spanning across differences in perspectives, institutions, issues, and time, which may or may not be founded upon work to integrate socioeconomically diverse participants.

The [[Inclusion (value and practice)|inclusion]] part of the idea is perhaps best encapsulated by the "50/50 rule", a term used by public managers in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], to invoke a variety of meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Quick, K. S., and [[Martha Feldman|M. S. Feldman]]. Distinguishing inclusion and participation. Paper presented at the Public Management Research Conference, Columbus, Ohio, October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes "50/50" means that process and outcome are equally important, in other words that the effects of a process on community building are as important as the task completion.  Sometimes it means that ideally 50% of the people involved in a process have participated in prior, related processes and 50% are newcomers, such that each policy-making effort acknowledges past conversations or decisions yet remains open to new ideas that may alter the previous consensus.  From the perspective of the 50/50 rule, things like process and outcome or task and [[community]] are not in a trade-off relationship, and indeed are not even separable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martha Feldman|Feldman, M.S.]] and K.S. Quick. 2009. Generating resources and energizing frameworks through inclusive public management. ''International Public Management Journal'' 12 (2): 137-71.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this context, concluding that participation was done "for the sake of participation" rather than to effect the outcome would be a damning critique.  Keeping process and outcome, newcomers and old-timers, and past and present in play are ways of creating connections across individuals, groups, interests, and issues.  Tasks are accomplished, yet opportunities continue to be open for revising as well as for moving on to the other issues and tasks that emerge or are next in line. This sense of inclusion is part of an ongoing stream of issues and people involved in one process or concern rolling forward into another echoes theorizations of democracy and civic engagement as an ongoing inquiry and never-finished project.&lt;ref&gt;Dryzek, J.S. 1990.

== Relationships with other public management and policy-making ideas ==

Inclusive public management is a newly characterized form of [[public management]] following the more traditional forms of [[public administration]], espoused by [[Woodrow Wilson]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert B. Reich|Reich, R. B.]] (1988). ''The Power of Public Ideas''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and political scientists including [[Frank Goodnow]] and [[Charles A. Beard]]. Analyses of inclusive public management contribute to a stream of practice and research regarding [[New Public Management]] popularized by Osborne and Gaebler,&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, D. &amp; T. Gaebler, 1992. ''Reinventing Government''. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly recent contributions on reconceptualizing members of the public as partners or [[Coproduction of public services by service users and communities|coproducers of public services]] rather than as "customers" of government.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Denhardt, R. B. &amp; J.V. Denhardt. 2000. The new public service: serving rather than steering. ''Public Administration Review'' 60 (6): 549-559.&lt;/ref&gt; Inclusive public management describes some practices of [[participatory democracy]], sharing with [[deliberative democracy]] an emphasis on participants making decisions through deliberative processes rather than the mere aggregation of individual interests through [[voting]] or other mechanisms, the idea being that through deliberative processes that enable [[communicative rationality]] and [[civic discovery]],&lt;ref&gt;Reich, R.B. 1988.

== Distinguishing inclusion and participation ==
Inclusive management practices are one way to enact [[public participation]] and [[civic engagement]], which may be implemented in a variety of ways. Inclusive management practices are not the same as citizen [[Participation (decision making)|participation]] or as [[Inclusion (value and practice)|inclusion]] as the latter term is typically used in [[Democracy#Theory|democratic theory]] to denote the involvement of ethnically or socioeconomically [[Diversity (politics)|diverse]] persons or groups in a decision-making process. Instead, inclusive management theories make a distinction between inclusive practices and participatory practices, which are intersecting dimensions of any civic engagement process. Inclusion is not a term for describing participation that has been done particularly well. Indeed, participation may be done well or badly, as may inclusion. Rather, inclusion and participation are two different approaches to public engagement, with different implications for the roles of the parties involved, the kinds of decisions reached, and the kind of community fostered by engagement. A process may be characterized by one, neither, or both, along two intersecting dimensions of low to high inclusion ''and'' low to high participation.  The following table identifies the features of high participation and high inclusion.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0739456X11410979|title=Distinguishing Participation and Inclusion|first1=Kathryn S.|last1=Quick|first2=Martha S.|last2=Feldman|date=1 September 2011|publisher=|journal=Journal of Planning Education and Research|volume=31|issue=3|pages=272–290|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1177/0739456X11410979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diversity and representation ==

Quick and [[Martha Feldman|Feldman's]]&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; distinction between inclusion and participation addresses the place of [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] in [[civic engagement]].  One potential source of confusion is that the inclusion component of the term '''inclusive management''' means something different from the commonplace use of [[Inclusion (value and practice)|inclusion]] to refer to the socioeconomic [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] of participants and adequacy of [[Representation (politics)|representation]] or the [[Representative sample|proportional representativeness]] of participation in an engagement process.  Given the everyday use of the term, characterizing a process that has not had socioeconomically diverse participation as "inclusive" is confusing and may be misread as being dismissive of diversity.  Diversity certainly does have a place in inclusive practices.  Within the framework of distinguishing inclusion and participation, however, it is not an either/or proposition to decide whether a diverse process is or is not inclusive or participatory.  Nor can diversity be assigned to the dimension of inclusion or participation.  Instead, diversity can be engaged through participation- or inclusion-oriented strategies, but it has different meanings in these two orientations.

== Inclusion in terms of boundaries==

Inclusion involves transcending dichotomies or engaging boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martha Feldman|Feldman, M.S.]] and A.M. Khademian. 2001. Principles for public management practice: from dichotomies to interdependence. Governance 14 (3): 339-61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.maxwell.syr.edu/uploadedFiles/conferences/pmrc/Files/Quick%20_%20Feldman%20boundaries%20inclusive%20public%20management%20PMRC%202011.pdf|author1=Quick, K.S.|author2=M.S. Feldman|author2link=Martha Feldman|title=Boundaries and inclusive public management|conference= Public Management Research Association conference|location= Syracuse, NY|date=June 2, 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dichotomies or boundaries – such as  government/non-government, expert/local, internal/external, process/outcome, flexibility/accountability, participation/control, and the temporal or issue scope of a problem – are distinctions that inclusive managers often bring into play.

Broader [[social theory]] about the relationship of [[structure and agency]], such as [[structuration]], [[practice theory]], and [[actor-network]] theory, or regarding the nature of [[boundary-work]] and [[boundary object]]s, [[communities of practice]], and [[Jerome Bruner#The Narrative Construction of Reality|the narrative construction of reality]], are powerful instruments for analysis in showing the interdependent relations between these dichotomies and clarifying how actions that transcend these dichotomies may be enacted.

== Examples of practices ==

Prior research has identified several inclusive practices, including:

* Seeking to balance control and participation, in part by decentralizing control of an engagement process and outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, M. S. &amp; Khademian, A. M. (2000). "Managing for inclusion: Balancing control and participation". ''International Public Management Journal, 3'', 149-167.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Identifying [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] through proper analysis as an important step in optimizing participation and  inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Bryson, J. M. (2004). "What to do when stakeholders matter: Stakeholder identification and analysis techniques". ''Public Management Review, 6, 1,'' 21-53.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Performing relational and informational work to bring together political, technical, and experiential domains.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, M. S. and A.M. Khademian, 2007. Role of public manager in inclusion: Creating communities of participation. ''Governance: An International Journal of Policy, Administration, and Institutions'' 20 (2): 305-324.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Recognizing and bringing potential resources into use by aligning them with desired frameworks for public action, and energizing desired frameworks or [[Imaginary (sociology)|imaginaries]] through making the frameworks visible for public discussion and action.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, M.S. and K.S. Quick. 2009. Generating resources and energizing frameworks through inclusive public management. ''International Public Management Journal'' 12 (2): 137-71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Quick, K.S. 2010. Inclusive Public Leadership Practices: Green Stewardship and Neighborhood Planning in Grand Rapids. PhD Dissertation in Planning, Policy, and Design, University of California, Irvine.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Managing inclusion as an ongoing process of policy formation and implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, M.S. and A.M. Khademian. 2008. The continuous process of policy formation. In K. Ahmed and E. Sanchez-Triana, eds., ''Strategic environmental assessment for policies: An instrument for good governance''. World Bank, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reflectively narrating civic engagement so that the practices and outcomes of inclusive (or non-inclusive) management are available for others to participate in and evaluate.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;
* Creating platforms for community action.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

To date, researchers have identified inclusive public management practices in communities that have a longstanding commitment to engaging the public, on an ongoing basis, in addressing public concerns together. This research has focused primarily on building public potential to address public problems at the local level of government in the United States. [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], and [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] are cities where inclusive practices have been documented. However, inclusive management practices might be found at any level of government or in any location.

== Benefits ==

Inclusive public management and leadership practices have been found to improve the quality of policy designs or the viability of policies by:

* Enhancing buy-in for implementation from parties affected by the policies;
* Generating better understandings of a public problem and making new connections among people and issues that have produced new ways of seeing and addressing public problems;&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, M.S., A.M. Khademian, H. Ingram, and A.S. Schneider. 2006. Ways of knowing and inclusive management practices. ''Public Administration Review'' 66 (s1): 89-99.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Discovering and enrolling new people and resources into the work that may then be brought into play to address public problems;
* Generating new leadership by creating connections among issues and people, creating platforms for action, and lifting up champions for causes;
* Building capacity for ongoing engagement and implementation of programs and policies related to the decision-making process.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;
* Facilitating adaptive community change through inclusive processes to address public issues.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

[[File:Industrial furnace.jpg|thumb|An Industrial Furnace|320x320px]]
The purpose of an '''industrial furnace''' is to attain a higher processing temperature in comparison to open-air systems, as well as the efficiency gains of a closed system. Industrial furnaces typically deal with temperatures higher than 400 degrees Celsius.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Io4qy4z3a3MC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=industrial+furnace&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjx27ypnvTQAhWprVQKHTfNBEcQ6AEIPzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=industrial%20furnace&amp;f=false|title=Industrial and Process Furnaces: Principles, Design and Operation|last=Jenkins|first=Barrie|last2=Mullinger|first2=Peter|date=2011-08-30|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=9780080558066|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An industrial furnace is an equipment used to provide heat for a process or can serve as [[chemical reactor|reactor]] which provides heats of reaction. Furnace designs vary as to its function, heating duty, type of fuel and method of introducing combustion air.

Heat is generated by an industrial furnace by mixing fuel with air or oxygen, or from [[Electricity|electrical energy]]. The residual heat will exit the furnace as [[flue gas]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:furnace2-en.svg|thumb|309x309px|Schematic diagram of an industrial process furnace]]Fuel flows into the [[Gas burner|burner]] and is burnt with air provided from an air blower. There can be more than one burner in a particular furnace which can be arranged in cells which heat a particular set of tubes. Burners can also be floor mounted, wall mounted or roof mounted depending on design. The flames heat up the tubes, which in turn heat the fluid inside in the first part of the furnace known as the radiant section or [[Firebox (steam engine)|firebox]]. In this chamber where combustion takes place, the heat is transferred mainly by [[heat_transfer#Radiation|radiation]] to tubes around the [[fire]] in the chamber.

The [[Coolant|heating fluid]] passes through the tubes and is thus heated to the desired temperature. The gases from the combustion are known as [[flue gas]]. After the flue gas leaves the firebox, most furnace designs include a [[convection]] section where more heat is recovered before venting to the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] through the [[flue gas stack]]. (HTF=Heat Transfer Fluid. Industries commonly use their furnaces to heat a secondary fluid with special additives like anti-[[rust]] and high heat transfer efficiency. This heated fluid is then circulated round the whole plant to heat exchangers to be used wherever heat is needed instead of directly heating the product line as the product or material may be volatile or prone to [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] at the furnace temperature.)

==Components==

===Radiant section===
[[File:Middle rad sect.jpg|thumb|320x320px|Middle of radiant section]]

The radiant section is where the tubes receive almost all its heat by [[Thermal radiation|radiation]] from the flame. In a vertical, cylindrical furnace, the tubes are vertical. Tubes can be vertical or horizontal, placed along the [[refractory]] wall, in the middle, etc., or arranged in cells. Studs are used to hold the [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] together and on the wall of the furnace. They are placed about 1&amp;nbsp;ft (300&amp;nbsp;mm) apart in this picture of the inside of a furnace.

The tubes, shown below, which are reddish brown from [[corrosion]], are [[carbon steel]] tubes and run the height of the radiant section. The tubes are a distance away from the insulation so radiation can be reflected to the back of the tubes to maintain a uniform tube wall temperature. Tube guides at the top, middle and bottom hold the tubes in place.

===Convection section===
[[File:Conv sect.gif|thumb|330x330px|Convection section]]

The convection section is located above the radiant section where it is cooler to recover additional heat. [[Heat transfer]] takes place by [[convection]] here, and the tubes are finned to increase heat transfer. The first two tube rows in the bottom of the convection section and at the top of the radiant section is an area of bare tubes (without fins) and are known as the shield section ("shock tubes"), so named because they are still exposed to plenty of radiation from the firebox and they also act to shield the convection section tubes, which are normally of less resistant material from the high temperatures in the firebox.

The area of the radiant section just before flue gas enters the shield section and into the convection section called the bridgezone. A crossover is the tube that connects from the convection section outlet to the radiant section inlet. The crossover piping is normally located outside so that the temperature can be monitored and the efficiency of the convection section can be calculated. The sightglass at the top allows personnel to see the flame shape and pattern from above and visually inspect if flame impingement is occurring. Flame impingement happens when the flame touches the tubes and causes small isolated spots of very high temperature.

===Radiant coil===
This is a series of tubes horizontal/ vertical hairpin type connected at ends (with 180° bends) or helical in construction. The radiant coil absorbs heat through radiation. They can be single pass or multi pass depending upon the process-side pressure drop allowed. The radiant coils and bends are housed in the radiant box. Radiant coil materials vary from carbon steel for low temperature services to high alloy steels for high temperature services. These are supported from the radiant side walls or hanging from the radiant roof. Material of these supports is generally high alloy steel. While designing the radiant coil, care is taken so that provision for expansion (in hot conditions) is kept.

===Burner===
[[File:Burner1.jpg|thumb|325x325px|Furnace burner]]

The burner in the vertical, cylindrical furnace as above, is located in the floor and fires upward. Some furnaces have side fired burners, such as in train [[locomotives]]. The burner [[tile]] is made of high temperature refractory and is where the flame is contained. Air registers located below the burner and at the outlet of the air blower are devices with movable flaps or vanes that control the shape and pattern of the flame, whether it spreads out or even swirls around. Flames should not spread out too much, as this will cause flame impingement. Air registers can be classified as primary, secondary and if applicable, tertiary, depending on when their air is introduced.

The primary air register supplies primary air, which is the first to be introduced in the burner. Secondary air is added to supplement primary air. Burners may include a pre-mixer to mix the air and fuel for better combustion before introducing into the burner. Some burners even use steam as premix to preheat the air and create better mixing of the fuel and heated air. The floor of the furnace is mostly made of a different material from that of the wall, typically hard castable refractory to allow technicians to walk on its floor during maintenance.

A furnace can be lit by a small [[Pilot light|pilot flame]] or in some older models, by hand. Most pilot flames nowadays are lit by an ignition transformer (much like a car's spark plugs). The pilot flame in turn lights up the main flame. The pilot flame uses natural gas while the main flame can use both [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] and natural gas. When using liquid fuels, an atomizer is used, otherwise, the liquid fuel will simply pour onto the furnace floor and become a hazard. Using a pilot flame for lighting the furnace increases safety and ease compared to using a manual ignition method (like a match).

===Sootblower===
Sootblowers are found in the convection section. As this section is above the radiant section and air movement is slower because of the fins, [[soot]] tends to accumulate here. Sootblowing is normally done when the efficiency of the convection section is decreased. This can be calculated by looking at the temperature change from the crossover piping and at the convection section exit.

Sootblowers utilize flowing media such as water, air or steam to remove deposits from the tubes. This is typically done during maintenance with the air blower turned on. There are several different types of sootblowers used. Wall blowers of the rotary type are mounted on furnace walls protruding between the convection tubes. The [[lance]]s are connected to a steam source with holes drilled into it at intervals along its length. When it is turned on, it rotates and blows the soot off the tubes and out through the stack.

===Stack===
[[File:Stack damper mechanism.svg|thumb|340x340px|right|Stack damper]]

The [[Flue gas stacks|flue gas stack]] is a cylindrical structure at the top of all the heat transfer chambers. The [[Flue|breeching]] directly below it collects the flue gas and brings it up high into the atmosphere where it will not endanger personnel.

The stack [[Damper (architecture)|damper]] contained within works like a [[butterfly valve]] and regulates [[Stack effect|draft]] (pressure difference between air intake and air exit) in the furnace, which is what pulls the flue gas through the convection section. The stack damper also regulates the heat lost through the stack. As the damper closes, the amount of heat escaping the furnace through the stack decreases, but the [[pressure]] or draft in the furnace increases which poses risks to those working around it if there are air leakages in the furnace, the flames can then escape out of the firebox or even explode if the pressure is too great.

===Insulation===
Insulation is an important part of the furnace because it improves efficiency by minimizing heat escape from the heated chamber. Refractory materials such as [[firebrick]], castable refractories and [[High temperature insulation wool|ceramic fibre]], are used for insulation. The floor of the furnace are normally castable type refractories while those on the walls are nailed or glued in place. Ceramic fibre is commonly used for the roof and wall of the furnace and is graded by its [[density]] and then its maximum temperature rating. For example, 8# 2,300&amp;nbsp;°F means 8&amp;nbsp;lb/ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; density with a maximum temperature rating of 2,300&amp;nbsp;°F. The actual service temperature rating for ceramic fiber is a bit lower than the maximum rated temperature. (i.e. 2300&amp;nbsp;°F is only good to 2145&amp;nbsp;°F before permanent linear shrinkage).

===Foundations===
Concrete pillars are foundation on which the heater is mounted. They can be four nos. for smaller heaters and may be up to 24 nos. for large size heaters. Design of pillars and entire foundation is done based on the load bearing capacity of soil and seismic conditions prevailing in the area. Foundation bolts are grouted in foundation after installation of the heater.

===Access doors===
The heater body is provided with access doors at various locations. Access doors are to be used only during shutdown of heater. The normal size of the access door is 600x400 mm, which is sufficient for movement of men/ material into and out of the heater. During operation the access doors are properly bolted using leak proof high temperature gaskets.

== History ==

FIRJAN was founded in 1975, but its history dates back to earlier decades. In December 1941, the Industrial Unions Federation in Federal District (FSIDF) had to adapt itself to new provisions of the corporate system of ''[[Estado Novo (Brazil)|Estado Novo]]'' regime, and was renamed Industry Federation of Rio de Janeiro (FIRJ), keeping the goal of bringing together unions of the industrial group. At that time, Rio was the [[capital of Brazil]].

Over the next thirty years, the name would change three more times: the first change was in 1958 for Industry Federation of the Federal District (FIDF). Then in 1960, when the federal capital was moved to [[Brasilia]] and a new [[States of Brazil|federative unit]] was created, it became Industry Federation of the State of Guanabara (FIEGA). And finally, in 1975 - when the Federation of Industries of the State of Guanabara (FIEGA) merged with the Industry Federation of the State of Rio de Janeiro (FIERJ) - the new entity was renamed Industry Federation of the State of Rio de Janeiro (FIRJAN), a name that is maintained until today.

The FIRJAN System only came to be implanted in 1994, gathering FIRJAN, [[CIRJ]] and related entities [[SESI Rio]], [[SENAI Rio]] and [[IEL Rio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Beloch|first1=I.|last2=Fagundes|first2=L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8016">The '''International Underwriting Association''' of London, better known as the IUA, represents companies that trade in the [[London]] [[insurance]] market outside [[Lloyd's of London|Lloyd’s]]. They include branches or subsidiaries of nearly all the world’s largest international insurance and [[reinsurance]] companies.  
The exact size of IUA members’ contribution to the London market is not known. They wrote a total of at least £10&amp;nbsp;billion&lt;ref name="thecityuk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Insurance 2010|url=http://www.thecityuk.com/assets/Uploads/Insurance-2010.pdf|publisher=TheCityUK|accessdate=10 December 2012|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; premium during 2009, a figure that does not include income processed outside the London market bureau. This business is [[wholesale]], the bulk being made up of insurance for large [[Multinational corporation|multinational companies]] or reinsurance. Most of it is international, brought into London by brokers.
The IUA provides a forum for discussing market issues and providing [[technical support]] to practitioners. IUA members collectively own a 25% share of Xchanging Ins-sure Services (XIS), the provider of [[back office]] processing services to the London market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clarity in the midst of uncertainty: Annual Report 2010|url=http://www.iua.co.uk/imis15/IUA_Test/Documents/Annual_Report/IUA_Test/Documents/Annual_Report/annual_report_home.aspx?hkey=a81ddddd-1366-452a-8de6-fc95fa108355|publisher=IUA of London|accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
History
The IUA was formed in January 1998 from the [[merger]] of the London International Insurance and Reinsurance Market Association (LIRMA) and the Institute of London Underwriters (ILU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carter|first=Robert|title=The British Insurance Industry Since 1900|year=2009|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke, England|isbn=978-0230219649|url=http://www.palgraveconnect.com/pc/doifinder/10.1057/9780230239524|author2=Peter Falush}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main stated reason for the merger was the desire to give the London company market a single voice in dealings with [[government]], [[regulator (economics)|regulator]]s and other insurance bodies. Since the ILU had been formed in 1884, the IUA can claim to go back more than a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewer|first=Chris|title=A Problem Shared: A History of the Institute of London Underwriters, 1884-1984|year=1984|publisher=Witherby|isbn=9780900886911}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The association has always made reform of the London market a top priority, especially the replacement of out-of-date processes and increased use of [[technology]] to conduct business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Challenging the status quo to keep London relevant and efficient|url=https://www.insuranceday.com/reinsurance/challenging-the-status-quo-to-keep-london-relevant-and-efficient.htm?origin=internalSearch|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=Insurance Day|date=5 January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This led in 1999 to the creation of the IUA-Lloyd’s Forum. This soon expanded to include brokers and eventually evolved into the London Market Group, which is still active today.

==Aims and priorities==

The IUA’s mission is “To promote and enhance the business environment for international insurance and reinsurance companies operating in or through London”.&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the IUA?|url=http://www.iua.co.uk/IUA_Test/About/IUA_Test/About_the_IUA/About_the_IUA_homepage.aspx?hkey=fde5f182-0b0b-4853-a8a1-eb918f24fbf2|work=International Underwriting Association|publisher=The International Underwriting Association of London Limited|accessdate=10 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702012542/http://www.iua.co.uk/IUA_Test/About/IUA_Test/About_the_IUA/About_the_IUA_homepage.aspx?hkey=fde5f182-0b0b-4853-a8a1-eb918f24fbf2|archivedate=2 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

How this mission is interpreted has evolved over the years. From being a mainly strategic and [[lobbying]] organisation, it has become more concerned with activities that provide direct support to market professionals in their work. In 2009, the association set itself four strategic priorities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planning for the future: Group Report and Accounts 2009|url=http://www.iua.co.uk/imis15/IUA_Test/Documents/Annual_Report/IUA_Test/Documents/Annual_Report/annual_report_home.aspx?hkey=a81ddddd-1366-452a-8de6-fc95fa108355|publisher=IUA of London|accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Improving the efficiency of doing business in London;
*Advancing the development of market expertise and innovation;
*Influencing [[public policy]] and [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]] developments;
*Fostering relationships with the broking community and other client-related stakeholders.

==Committee structure==

The IUA board is elected by the membership. Reporting to the board are the committees, sub-committees and working parties, which provide the backbone of the association. These are populated overwhelmingly by market practitioners with the full-time IUA [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]] providing administrative support and implementing decisions (see chart).

These committees responsibilities include for overseeing and supporting: the IUA’s contribution to the London market modernisation programme; discussion with regulators and legislators and communicating the implications of regulatory changes to the membership; [[education]], [[training]] and [[research]]; and technical matters relating to [[underwriting]] and claims, including specialist classes of insurance and reinsurance.

IUA committees co-operate regularly with their counterparts at the Lloyd’s Market Association and the two organisations jointly run a number of [[marine insurance]] committees. Although most of its committees and sub-committees are populated by people working for IUA companies, some such as Digital Risk and Rehabilitation have cross-market membership.

==Other Activities==

The IUA holds regular lunchtime briefings and organises a number of events, most notably an annual [[catastrophe modelling]] conference, which normally attracts an international cast of speakers and delegates. It also supports an annual marine claims conference in [[Dublin]]. Its website has become an important communications tool and a repository of market statistics and other information.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;

==IUA membership==

IUA member companies come overwhelmingly from overseas, reflecting the [[globalisation]] of the insurance and reinsurance industries. As of March 2011 thirty eight of the IUA’s forty members were based overseas or part of larger overseas groups. This external influence is reflected in the [[nationality]] of many of its board members. Around a third of IUA members also have operations at the Lloyd’s as part of the growing inter-relationship of the two main parts of the London market.

As well as Ordinary Membership, there are two other categories: Associate (for active insurance companies that do not operate in London but wish to have an association with the IUA); and Affiliate (for other organisations with an interest in the insurance and reinsurance market). Membership is always granted on a corporate rather than individual basis.

The number of Ordinary member companies dropped by around 50% in the first five years of the association’s existence even as their aggregate premium [[income]] increased, reflecting the [[consolidation (business)|consolidation]] of the company insurance market into fewer, larger players. Numbers have remained stable for several years with departures from the market being balanced by new arrivals.

'''James Stuart Douglas Jr.''' (1867–1949), popularly known as '''Rawhide Jimmy''', was a Canadian-American businessman and mining executive.

==Early life==
Douglas was the son of [[James Douglas (businessman)|James Douglas]], a Canadian mining engineer and executive. Born in [[Quebec]], Jimmy Douglas grew up in [[Phoenixville, Pennsylvania]], where his father managed the Chemical Copper Company. Douglas left home at 17 and moved west to [[Manitoba]], where he [[Dominion Lands Act|homesteaded]]. Suffering from [[asthma]], he moved to the [[Arizona Territory]], in the United States, in the hope that the drier climate might provide relief.

==Career==
After a year in Sulpher Springs Valley, where he cultivated [[garden strawberry|strawberries]], he moved to [[Bisbee, Arizona|Bisbee]] at his father's request to work as an [[Metallurgical assay|assayer]] for the [[Copper Queen Mine]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Paul Browder and Thomas G. Smith; ''Independent: A Biography of Lewis W. Douglas''; Alfred A. Knopf Co.; New York; 1986; p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892 Douglas moved to [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]] to work for the Commercial Mining Company, an affiliate of the [[Phelps Dodge]] mining company. Eight years later he was transferred to [[Sonora]], [[Mexico]], to manage the copper mine and smelter at [[Pilares, Sonora|Pilares]] and [[Nacozari, Sonora|Nacozari]]; and directed construction of a railroad from [[Douglas, Arizona]] to Nacozari. While at Pilares, he acquired his nickname, "Rawhide Jimmy", because of his technique of  using rawhide to protect the rollers on mining equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert V. Young (1964), quoting Lewis W. Douglas&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, he moved to [[Cananea]], [[Sonora]], to manage the copper operations there. His tenure was marked by riots and labor problems, which were endemic to the Cananea mines.

==Speculator==
[[File:Douglas Mansion.jpg|thumb|left|The Douglas Mansion in Jerome]]
In 1912, Douglas returned to central Arizona, where he took an option on the [[United Verde Extension]] (UVX) property, a speculative venture to find the down-faulted extension of the great "United Verde" ore body near [[Jerome, Arizona]]. In 1914, with funds near exhaustion, an exploration drift cut [[Bonanza (mining)|bonanza]] copper ore. The UVX became a profitable mine. During 1916 alone, the mine produced $10 million worth of copper, silver and gold, of which $7.4 million was profit.&lt;ref&gt;Arizona Bureau of Mines Bulletin #180; 1969; Mineral and Water Resources of Arizona; p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; The UVX paid $55 million in dividends during its life (1915–1938), making Douglas a wealthy man.

==Retirement and death==
In 1939, Douglas retired to Canada, where he died of heart failure in 1949.

==Legacy==
Douglas' Jerome mansion is open to the public as the [[Jerome State Historic Park]].

Douglas' son, [[Lewis W. Douglas]], who also entered the mining business, went on to a successful political career as a [[Member of Congress|Congressman]] from 1927–33; and the [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|Ambassador to the United Kingdom]] (1947–51). The copper-roofed cottage on the hillside adjacent to the Douglas Mansion was built as a wedding present for Lewis.

'''Joseph Manchin III''' (born August 24, 1947) is an American politician serving as the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|senior]] [[United States Senator]] from [[West Virginia]], a seat he has held since 2010. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he previously served as the 34th [[governor of West Virginia]] from 2005 to 2010 and the 27th [[secretary of state of West Virginia]] from 2001 to 2005.

Manchin has been known throughout his career to be a moderate—or even conservative—Democrat, a fact which has allowed him to win elections in West Virginia even as the state shifted from one of the most heavily Democratic in the country to one of the most heavily Republican.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/10/24/451336317/west-virginia-tells-the-story-of-americas-shifting-political-climate |title=West Virginia Tells The Story Of America's Shifting Political Climate |first=Don |last=Gonyea |author-link=Don Gonyea |date=October 24, 2015 |website=[[NPR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the [[West Virginia gubernatorial election, 2004|2004 West Virginia gubernatorial election]] by a large margin and was re-elected with an even larger margin in [[West Virginia gubernatorial election, 2008|2008]]; in both years, Republican presidential candidates captured the majority of West Virginia's votes. Manchin won the special election in [[United States Senate special election in West Virginia, 2010|2010]] to fill the seat vacated by Senator [[Robert Byrd]] when he died in office. Manchin was elected to a full term in [[United States Senate election in West Virginia, 2012|2012]] with 60 percent of the vote, and was later reelected in [[United States Senate election in West Virginia, 2018|2018]] by a much narrower margin. Manchin became the state's senior U.S. Senator when [[Jay Rockefeller]] retired in 2015.

As a member of Congress, Manchin is known for his [[bipartisanship]], voting or working with [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] on issues such as abortion and gun ownership. He opposed the energy policies of President [[Barack Obama]], voted against the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]], voted for removing federal funding from [[Planned Parenthood]] in 2015, and voted to confirm most of Republican President [[Donald Trump]]'s cabinet and judicial appointees. He remains the only Democrat in the Senate to oppose [[same-sex marriage]]. However, Manchin has repeatedly voted against attempts to repeal the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (also known as Obamacare), voted to preserve funding for Planned Parenthood in 2017, and voted against the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|2017 Republican tax plan]]. Manchin has complained about the "toxic" lack of bipartisanship in Congress on almost every issue; "liberal activists argue he is too conservative for the Democratic Party, while Republicans argue he is too liberal for West Virginia."&lt;ref name="primary-challenge"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Foran |first1=Clare |title=West Virginia's Conservative Democrat Gets a Primary Challenger |date=May 9, 2017 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/joe-manchin-bernie-sanders-primary-challenge-west-virginia-senate-2018/525918/ |website=[[The Atlantic]] |accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Manchin was born in 1947 in [[Farmington, West Virginia]], a small coal mining town, the second of five children of Mary O. (née Gouzd) and John Manchin.&lt;ref name=USNews&gt;{{cite web |title=10 Things You Didn't Know About West Virginia Gov.

His father was of [[Italy|Italian]] descent and his maternal grandparents were [[Czechoslovak]] [[immigration|immigrants]].&lt;ref name=USNews/&gt;&lt;ref name=vt-z&gt;{{Cite web |last=Baxter |first=Anna |title=Day 2: Democratic National Convention |website=[[WSAZ-TV]] |date=August 26, 2008 |url=http://www.wsaz.com/political/headlines/27439319.html |accessdate=November 3, 2010 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080831005436/http://www.wsaz.com/political/headlines/27439319.html |archive-date=August 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father owned a carpet and furniture store, and his grandfather, Joseph Manchin, owned a grocery store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wvobserver.com/2010/07/a-day-with-joe-manchin/ |title=A Day with Joe Manchin |date=August 7, 2010 |newspaper=The Shepherdstown Observer |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807232205/http://www.wvobserver.com/2010/07/a-day-with-joe-manchin/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father and his grandfather both served as Mayor of [[Farmington, West Virginia]]. His uncle, [[A. James Manchin|A.J. Manchin]], was a member of the [[West Virginia House of Delegates]] and was elected as the state's [[West Virginia Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] and [[Treasurer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationaljournal.com/pubs/almanac/2006/people/wv/wvgv.htm |title=Gov.

Manchin graduated from [[North Marion High School (West Virginia)|Farmington High School]] in 1965.&lt;ref name=OurStates&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Joe Manchin III |last=Fournier |first=Eddie |title=Our States: West Virginia |date=November 2008 |pages=1–3 |publisher=[[EBSCO Publishing]] |isbn=1-4298-1207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He entered [[West Virginia University]] on a [[American football|football]] [[athletic scholarship|scholarship]] in 1965; however, an injury during practice ended his football career. Manchin graduated in 1970 with a degree in [[Bachelor of Business Administration#Information management|business administration]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=M001183 |title=Manchin, Joe, III, (1947-) |website=Biographical Directory of the U.S. Congress |accessdate=August 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went to work for his family's business, where he ran a carpet store.&lt;ref name=USNews/&gt;

Manchin was a childhood friend of [[Alabama Crimson Tide football]] coach [[Nick Saban]] and they are still close friends to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.al.com/alabamafootball/index.ssf/2014/08/nick_saban_joe_manchin.html |title=US Senator vacationed with childhood friend Nick Saban but can't cheer for him Saturday |website=AL.com |accessdate=November 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==
Manchin was elected to the [[West Virginia House of Delegates]] in 1982 at the age of 35 and was elected to the [[West Virginia Senate]] in 1986, where he served until 1996. He ran for governor in 1996, finishing second to [[Charlotte Pritt]] among a large group of candidates in the Democratic [[primary election]]. He later ran and was elected as [[Secretary of State of West Virginia]] in 2000.

==Governor of West Virginia==
Manchin announced his intention to challenge incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Governor, [[Bob Wise]], in the 2004 Democratic [[primary election]] in May 2003. Wise decided not to seek re-election after a scandal, and Manchin won the Democratic primary and [[West Virginia gubernatorial election, 2004|general election]] by large margins. His election marked the first time that two people of the same political party had followed one another in the West Virginia Governor's office since 1964.

Manchin was a member of the [[National Governors Association]], the [[Southern Governors' Association]], and the [[Democratic Governors Association]]. He was also chairman of the Southern States Energy Board, state's chair of the [[Appalachian Regional Commission]] and chairman of the Interstate Mining Compact Commission.

In July 2005, [[Massey Energy]] [[chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Don Blankenship]] sued Manchin, alleging that Manchin had violated Blankenship's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights by threatening increased government scrutiny of his coal operations in retaliation for Blankenship's political activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Massey CEO sues W.Va. governor in federal court |url=http://www.ohvec.org/links/news/archive/2005/fair_use/07_27.html |newspaper=The Herald-Dispatch |accessdate=May 26, 2012 |first=Jennifer |last=Bundy |date=July 27, 2005 |via=Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blankenship had donated substantial funds into campaigns to defeat a proposed pension bond amendment and oppose the re-election of [[Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia|state Supreme Court]] Justice [[Warren McGraw]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=West Virginia: The story behind the score |url=http://www.stateintegrity.org/westvirginia_story_subpage |website=StateIntegrity.org |accessdate=May 26, 2012 |first=Eric |last=Newhouse |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522133040/http://www.stateintegrity.org/westvirginia_story_subpage |archivedate=May 22, 2012 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he fought against a proposed increase in the [[severance tax]] on extraction of mineral resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The WV Coal Equation: Living With Past Peak Production |url=http://calhounpowerline.com/2010/04/17/wv-coal-living-with-past-peak-production/ |website=CalhounPowerline.com |accessdate=May 26, 2012 |date=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after defeat of the pension bond amendment, the state Division of Environmental Protection (DEP) revoked a permit approval for controversial new [[silo]]s near Marsh Fork Elementary School in [[Raleigh County, West Virginia|Raleigh County]]. While area residents had complained for some time that the coal operation there endangered their children, Blankenship claimed that the DEP acted in response to his opposition to the bond amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=The Rape of Appalachia |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2006/05/appalachia200605 |magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |accessdate=May 26, 2012 |first=Michael |last=Shnayerson |date=November 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2006 Sago Mine disaster]] in early January 2006 in [[Upshur County, West Virginia]], Manchin appeared to confirm incorrect reports that 12 miners had survived;{{citation needed |date=October 2011}} in actuality only one survived. Manchin later acknowledged that an unintentional miscommunication had occurred with rescue teams in the mine.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} On February 1, 2006, he ordered a stop to all coal production in West Virginia, pending safety checks, after two more miners were killed in separate accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.smdailyjournal.com/news/world/w-va-governor-asks-for-coal-production-halt-after-two/article_b1f88501-610e-599e-ae0f-a6afaad9de75.html |title=W.Va. governor asks for coal production halt after two deaths |date=February 2, 2006 |newspaper=[[San Mateo Daily Journal]] |access-date=October 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen West Virginia coal miners died from mining accidents in early 2006. In November 2006, [[SurveyUSA]] ranked him as one of the most popular governors in the country with a 74 percent approval rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Approval Ratings For All 50 Governors |date=November 20, 2006 |website=SurveyUSA |url=http://www.surveyusa.com/50State2006/State50StateGovernor061120.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manchin easily won re-election to a second term as governor in [[West Virginia gubernatorial election, 2008|2008]] against Republican [[Russ Weeks]], capturing 69.77% percent of the vote and winning every county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gov.

Due to the declining health of Senator [[Robert Byrd]], speculation focused on what Manchin's response would be if Byrd died. The governor consistently refused to comment on the subject prior to Byrd's death, except for stating that he would not appoint himself to the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|3Hw56gkJIPE|Joe Manchin stated that he would not select himself for the US senate position should Robert Byrd be unable to serve a full term}}{{dead link |date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byrd died on June 28, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Lisa |last=Lerer |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-06-28/robert-byrd-longest-serving-u-s-senator-dies-at-92.html |title=Robert Byrd, Longest-Serving U.S. Senator, Dies at 92 |magazine=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |date=June 28, 2010 |accessdate=December 29, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702010614/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-06-28/robert-byrd-longest-serving-u-s-senator-dies-at-92.html |archivedate=July 2, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Manchin appointed [[Carte Goodwin]], his 36-year-old legal adviser, on July 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/07/16/pol.byrd.vacant.seat/index.html |website=CNN |title=West Virginia governor to name Byrd replacement |author=CNN Wire Staff |date=July 16, 2010 |accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012====
{{main|United States Senate election in West Virginia, 2012}}
Manchin chose to stand for reelection to a full term in 2012. According to the Democratic firm [[Public Policy Polling]], early polling found Manchin heavily favored, leading Congresswoman [[Shelley Moore Capito]] 50–39, 2010 opponent [[John Raese]] 60–31, and Congressman [[David McKinley]] 57–28.&lt;ref name="PPP"&gt;{{cite web |title=Manchin leads Capito, Raese, McKinley for 2012 re-election |url=http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/PPP_Release_WV_0125424.pdf |website=[[Public Policy Polling]] |date=January 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchin had not endorsed his party's candidate, President Barack Obama, for the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]], saying that he had "some real differences" with the presumptive nominees of both major parties, finding fault with Obama's [[Economic policy of Barack Obama|economic]] and [[energy policy of the Obama administration|energy policies]], and questioning [[Political positions of Mitt Romney|Romney's understanding]] of the "challenges facing ordinary people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dem Senator Doesn't Know If He Will Vote For Obama |date=April 20, 2012 |url=http://washington.cbslocal.com/2012/04/20/dem-senator-doesnt-know-if-he-will-vote-for-obama/ |website=[[CBS Radio|CBS DC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manchin defeated Republican John Raese and Mountain Party candidate Bob Henry Baber with 60.49% of the total vote and won a full term in the U.S. Senate.&lt;ref name="apps.sos.wv.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.sos.wv.gov/elections/results/results.aspx?year=2012&amp;eid=13&amp;county=Statewide |title=Statewide Results : General Election - November 6, 2012 |website=West Virginia Secretary of State — Online Data Services |accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swearengin is an activist and coal miner's daughter who is supported by former members of the [[Bernie Sanders]] campaign. Swearengin criticized Manchin for voting with the Republicans and supporting the policies of [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref name="primary-challenge"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/09/justice_democrat_coal_miners_daughter_paula_swearingen_annoucnes_primary_against_west_virginia_sen_joe_manchin.html |title='Justice Democrat' Coal Miner's Daughter Paula Swearingen Announces Primary Challenge Against West Virginia Sen.

On the Republican side, Manchin was challenged by West Virginia Attorney General [[Patrick Morrisey]]. In August 2017, Morrisey publicly asked Manchin to resign from the Senate Democratic leadership team. Manchin responded, "I don't give a shit, you understand?" to a ''[[Charleston Gazette-Mail]]'' reporter when asked about Morrisey's call. "I just don't give a shit. Don't care if I get elected, don't care if I get defeated, how about that?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://wvrecord.com/stories/511174813-manchin-says-he-doesn-t-give-a-sh-t-about-morrisey-s-demand |title=Manchin says he 'doesn't give a sh-t' about Morrisey's demand |last=Dickerson |first=Chris |date=August 7, 2017 |newspaper=[[West Virginia Record]] |access-date=December 1, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the November 6, 2018 general election, Manchin was re-elected to a second full term, defeating Morrisey with 49.5% of the total vote.

===Tenure===
Manchin was sworn in by Vice President [[Joe Biden]] on November 15, 2010, succeeding interim Senator [[Carte Goodwin]]. Manchin named Democratic strategist Chris Kofinis to be his chief of staff. In 2015, Manchin announced that he would seek re-election to the Senate in [[United States Senate elections, 2018|2018]].&lt;ref name=manchinrunning/&gt;

=== Political positions ===
Joe Manchin is often considered to be a [[Centrism|moderate]]&lt;ref name="bipartisan-214865"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/03/joe-manchin-senator-profile-west-virginia-red-state-democrat-bipartisan-214865 |title=Manchin in the Middle |website=Politico |last1=Kruse |first1=Michael |last2=Everett |first2=Burgess |date=March–April 2017 |access-date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-manchin/democratic-senator-criticizes-pelosis-immigration-rhetoric-idUSKBN1FH0RC |title=Democratic senator criticizes Pelosi's immigration comment |date=January 28, 2018 |website=Reuters |accessdate=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;—or even [[conservatism|conservative]]&lt;ref name="bipartisan-214865"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/joe-manchin-bernie-sanders-primary-challenge-west-virginia-senate-2018/525918/ |title=Will Liberals Force a Conservative Democrat Out of the Senate? |last=Foran |first=Clare |date=May 9, 2017 |website=The Atlantic |access-date=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;—Democrat.

====Abortion====
Manchin identifies as "[[anti-abortion|pro-life]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2014/04/22/pro-life_democrats_squeezed_by_a_partisan_issue_122354.html |title=Pro-Life Democrats, Squeezed by a Partisan Issue |last1=Gonzalez |first1=Jose, R. |date=April 22, 2014 |website=Real Clear Politics |access-date=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has mixed ratings from both [[Abortion-rights movements|pro-choice]] and [[Anti-abortion movements|pro-life]] political action groups. In 2018, [[Planned Parenthood]], which supports legal abortion, gave Manchin a lifetime grade of 57% while [[National Right to Life Committee|National Right to Life]] (NRLC), which opposes abortion, gave Manchin a 40% score; in 2016, the NRLC scored Manchin at 75% and [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]] gave him a 100% in the same year.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/7547/joe-manchin-iii |title=Joe Manchin III's Ratings and Endorsements |website=VoteSmart.org |accessdate=July 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 3, 2015, he broke with Democratic leadership by voting in favor of a Republican-sponsored bill to terminate federal funding for [[Planned Parenthood]], a nonprofit organization that provides reproductive health services, including abortions, both in the United States and globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/03/joe-manchin-will-vote-to-defund-planned-parenthood/ |title=Joe Manchin and Joe Donnelly vote to defund Planned Parenthood |last1=Snell |first1=Kelsey |date=August 3, 2015 |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has the endorsement of [[Democrats for Life of America]], a pro-life Democratic PAC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kunc.org/post/5-senators-who-will-likely-decide-next-supreme-court-justice |title=5 Senators Who Will Likely Decide The Next Supreme Court Justice |last=Davis |first=Susan |access-date=July 3, 2018 |website=[[KUNC]] |date=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 30, 2017, however, Manchin expressed support for abortion rights providers by voting against H.J.Res. 43.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/13/donald-trump-gives-states-power-cut-planned-parent |title=Trump Gives States Power to Cut off Planned Parenthood Money |last1=Dinan |first1=Stephen |date=April 13, 2017 |newspaper=The Washington Times |accessdate=April 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pending federal regulation would have prevented states from withholding money from abortion providers.

====Afghanistan====
On June 21, 2011, Manchin delivered a speech on the Senate floor calling for a "substantial and responsible reduction in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–2014)|United States' military presence in Afghanistan]]." He said, "We can no longer afford to rebuild Afghanistan and America. We must choose. And I choose America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Manchin: It's Time to Rebuild America, Not Afghanistan |url=http://www.whsv.com/home/headlines/Manchin_Its_Time_to_Rebuild_America_Not_Afghanistan_124300294.html |date=June 21, 2011 |website=[[WHSV-TV]] |accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manchin introduced legislation to reduce the use of overseas service and security contractors. He successfully amended the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act to cap contractors' taxpayer funded salaries at $230,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchin questions military officials on contractors |url=http://www.wvgazette.com/News/politics/201203090208 |first=Paul J. |last=Nyden |date=March 9, 2012 |newspaper=Charleston Gazette |accessdate=March 9, 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130209214610/http://www.wvgazette.com/News/politics/201203090208 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bipartisanship====
In his first year in office, Manchin met one-on-one with all of his 99 Senate colleagues in an effort to get to know them better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchin marks a year in Senate |url=http://www.theintermountain.com/page/content.detail/id/547744.html |first=Carra |last=Higgins |date=November 16, 2011 |newspaper=[[The Inter-Mountain]] |accessdate=November 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126014848/http://www.theintermountain.com/page/content.detail/id/547744.html |archivedate=January 26, 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 13, 2010, Manchin participated in the launch of No Labels, a new, nonpartisan organization that is "committed to bringing all sides together to move the nation forward."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sen.

Manchin worked with Senator [[Pat Toomey]] (R-PA) to introduce legislation that would require a [[background check]] for most gun sales.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=Senate rejects gun background checks |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/04/17/guns-background-checks-manchin-senate/2090105/ |newspaper=USA Today |accessdate=April 17, 2013 |first1=Gregory |last1=Korte |first2=Catalina |last2=Camia |date=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====China====
In July 2017, he urged Trump to block the sale of the [[Chicago Stock Exchange]] to Chinese investors, arguing that China's "rejection of fundamental free-market norms and property rights of private citizens makes me strongly doubt whether an Exchange operating under the direct control of a Chinese entity can be trusted to 'self-regulate' now and in the future." He also expressed concern "that the challenges plaguing the Chinese market – lack of transparency, currency manipulation, etc. – will bleed into the Chicago Stock Exchange and adversely impact financial markets across the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Louis |first1=Brian |title=Two Chinese bidders for Chicago Exchange are said to drop out |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-chicago-stock-exchange-chinese-bidders-drop-out-20171016-story.html |date=October 13, 2017 |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |accessdate=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Donald Trump====
Manchin welcomed [[Donald Trump]]'s presidency, saying: "He'll correct the trading policies, the imbalance in our trade policies, which are horrible." He supported the idea of Trump "calling companies to keep them from moving factories overseas."&lt;ref name="bipartisan-214865"/&gt; Manchin voted for most of the Trump nominees.

====Drugs====
In June 2011, Manchin joined Senator [[Chuck Schumer]] (D-NY) in seeking a crackdown on [[Bitcoin|Bitcoin currency transactions]], saying that they facilitated [[illegal drug trade]] transactions. "The transactions leave no traditional [bank transfer] [[money trail]] for investigators to follow, and leave it hard to prove a package recipient knew in advance what was in a shipment," using an "'[[anonymity|anonymizing]] network' known as [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/08/us-financial-bitcoins-idUSTRE7573T320110608 |title=Senators seek crackdown on Bitcoin currency |first=Brett

In May 2012, in an effort to reduce prescription drug abuse, Manchin successfully proposed an amendment to the Food and Drug Administration re-authorization bill to reclassify [[hydrocodone]] as a [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule II controlled substances|Schedule II controlled substance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://wvgazette.com/News/201205230316 |title=Senators approve Manchin amendment to reclassify hydrocodone drugs |date=May 23, 2012 |newspaper=[[Charleston Gazette-Mail]] |accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Energy and environment====
Manchin sits on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and supports a comprehensive, all-of-the-above energy approach that uses coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.loganbanner.com/view/full_story/18105018/article-Manchin--Energy-belongs-to-all-of-us--regardless-of-party-labels |title=Manchin 'Energy belongs to all of us - regardless of party labels' |newspaper=[[Logan Banner]]}} {{dead link |date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manchin's first bill in the Senate dealt with what he calls the EPA's overreach. After the EPA vetoed a previously-approved permit for the Spruce Mine in Logan County, West Virginia, Senator Manchin offered the "EPA Fair Play Act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Manchin touts EPA bill in maiden Senate speech |url=http://www.dailymail.com/ap/ApTopStories/201102031081 |date=February 3, 2011 |newspaper=[[Charleston Daily Mail]] |accessdate=February 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130121100543/http://www.dailymail.com/ap/ApTopStories/201102031081 |archivedate=January 21, 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill would "clarify and confirm the authority of the Environment Protection Agency to deny or restrict the use of defined areas as disposal sites for the discharge of dredged or filled material."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=S. 272 (is) - EPA Fair Play Act |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112s272is/content-detail.html |website=U.S. Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchin said the bill would prevent the agency from "changing its rules on businesses after permits have already been granted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Senator Manchin Introduces EPA Fair Play Act Of 2011 |url=http://www.wchstv.com/newsroom/eyewitness/110203_4192.shtml |first=Martin |last=Hicks |date=February 3, 2011 |website=[[WCHS-TV]] |accessdate=February 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207001712/http://www.wchstv.com/newsroom/eyewitness/110203_4192.shtml |archivedate=February 7, 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 6, 2010, Manchin directed a lawsuit aimed at overturning new federal rules concerning [[mountaintop removal mining]]. Filed by the state Department of Environmental Protection, the lawsuit "accuses U.S. EPA of overstepping its authority and asks the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia to throw out the federal agency's new guidelines for issuing [[Clean Water Act]] permits for coal mines." In order to qualify for the permits, mining companies need to prove their projects would not cause the concentration of pollutants in the local water to rise 5 times past the normal level. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that EPA Administrator [[Lisa P. Jackson|Lisa Jackson]] said the new legislation would protect 95 percent of aquatic life by banning operators from dumping mine waste into [[stream]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=W.Va.

Manchin has received criticism from environmentalists due to his close family ties to the coal industry. He served as president of Energysystems in the late 1990s before becoming active in politics. On his financial disclosures in 2009 and 2010, his reported earnings from the company were $1,363,916 and $417,255 respectively.&lt;ref name="lucrative-ties"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sen.

On November 14, 2011, Manchin chaired his first field hearing of that committee in Charleston, West Virginia, to focus on [[Marcellus Formation|Marcellus Shale]] natural gas development and production. Manchin said, "We are literally sitting on top of tremendous potential with the Marcellus shale. We need to work together to chart a path forward in a safe and responsible way that lets us produce energy right here in America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Senator Manchin Leads Field Hearing On Marcellus Shale |url=http://www.wvmetronews.com/news.cfm?func=displayfullstory&amp;storyid=49211 |website=West Virginia Metro News |date=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manchin supports building the [[Keystone XL Pipeline]] from Canada. Manchin has said, "It makes so much common sense that you want to buy [oil] off your friends and not your enemies." The pipeline would span over 2,000 miles across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Manchin Speaks Out About 'Political Football' Pipeline Treatment |url=http://www.wvnstv.com/story/16646213/manchin-speaks-out-about-political-football-pipeline-treatment |website=[[WVNS-TV]]  |accessdate=January 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 9, 2011, Manchin introduced the "Fair Compliance Act" with Senator [[Dan Coats]] (R-IN). Their bill would "lengthen timelines and establish benchmarks for utilities to comply with two major Environmental Protection Agency air pollution rules. The legislation would extend the compliance deadline for the [[Cross-State Air Pollution Rule]], or CSAPR, by three years and the deadline for the Utility MACT rule by two years—setting both to January 1, 2017."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchin Co-Sponsors Bill to Delay EPA Air Pollution Rules |url=http://www.statejournal.com/story/16002212/manchin-co-sponsors-bill-to-delay-epa-air-pollution-rules |first=Pam |last=Kasey |newspaper=[[The State Journal]] |accessdate=November 9, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116045354/http://www.statejournal.com/story/16002212/manchin-co-sponsors-bill-to-delay-epa-air-pollution-rules |archivedate=November 16, 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manchin introduced the "American Alternative Fuels Act" on May 10, 2011, with Senator [[John Barrasso]] (R-WY). The bill would remove restrictions on the development of alternative fuels, repeal part of the 2007 energy bill restricting the federal government from buying alternative fuels and encourage the development of algae-based fuels and synthetic natural gas. Regarding the bill, Manchin said, "Our unacceptably high gas prices are hurting not only West Virginians, but all Americans, and they underscore a critical need: the federal government needs to be a partner, not an obstacle, for businesses that can transform our domestic energy resources into gas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchin introduces alternative fuels bill |url=http://www.newsandsentinel.com/page/content.detail/id/547780/Manchin-introduces-alternative-fuels-bill.html?nav=5061 |newspaper=[[The Parkersburg News and Sentinel]] |date=May 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Manchin was the only Democratic senator to support the proposed [[Energy Tax Prevention Act]], which sought to prohibit the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] from regulating [[greenhouse gas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John M. |last=Broder |title=House Panel Votes to Limit E.P.A.

Manchin criticized Obama's environmental regulations as a "war on coal" and demanded what he described as a proper balance between the needs of the environment and the coal business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Trump Seeks an Ally, or At Least an Ear, in West Virginia Democrat |url=http://fortune.com/2017/02/04/trump-joe-manchin-alliance/ |date=February 4, 2017 |magazine=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' has noted that while professing environmental concerns, he has consistently stood up for coal, saying "no one is going to stop using fossil [fuels] for a long time." He "does not deny the existence of man-made climate change," wrote the ''Los Angeles Times'', but "is reluctant to curtail it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Banerjee |first1=Neela |title=2 Senate Democrats explore how to protect coal jobs and the environment |url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-congress-climate-exchange-20141021-story.html |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, he was one of only two Democratic senators to vote to confirm [[Scott Pruitt]] as [[Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/02/17/us/politics/live-congress-votes-scott-pruitt-epa.html |title=How Senators Voted on Scott Pruitt for E.P.A.

Manchin has co-sponsored [[balanced budget amendment]]s put forth by Senators [[Mike Lee (U.S. politician)|Mike Lee]] (R-UT),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://wvgazette.com/News/201103021152?page=2 |title=Manchin questions U.S. role in Afghanistan |last=Nyden |first=Paul J. |date=March 2, 2011 |newspaper=[[Charleston Gazette]] |access-date=October 12, 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120716013501/http://wvgazette.com/News/201103021152?page=2 |archive-date=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Shelby]] (R-AL), and [[Mark Udall]] (D-CO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://wvgazette.com/News/201104261087?page=2 |title=Manchin launches 'Commonsense' tour |last=Nyden |first=Paul J. |date=April 26, 2011 |newspaper=Charleston Gazette |access-date=October 12, 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028170602/http://wvgazette.com/News/201104261087?page=2 |archive-date=October 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also voted against raising the federal debt ceiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://wvgazette.com/News/201201270144 |title=Rockefeller, Manchin cast opposite votes on debt ceiling |date=January 27, 2012 |newspaper=Charleston Gazette |accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manchin has expressed strong opposition to entitlement reform, describing Mitch McConnell's comments in October 2018 on the need to reform entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare as "absolutely ridiculous."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/21/entitlements-mcconnell-manchin-midterms-920027|title='Campaign gold': McConnell delivers election gift to Manchin and red-state Dems|work=POLITICO|access-date=2018-10-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Guns====
In 2012 Manchin's candidacy was endorsed by the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA), which gave him an "A" rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NRA-PVF Endorses Joe Manchin for U.S. Senate in West Virginia |url=http://www.nrapvf.org/news-alerts/2012/10/nra-pvf-endorses-joe-manchin-for-us-senate-in-west-virginia.aspx |website=NRA Political Victory Fund |date=October 2, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213173935/http://www.nrapvf.org/news-alerts/2012/10/nra-pvf-endorses-joe-manchin-for-us-senate-in-west-virginia.aspx |archivedate=December 13, 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|Sandy Hook shooting]], Manchin partnered with Republican senator [[Pat Toomey]] to introduce a bill that would have strengthened background checks on gun sales. The Manchin-Toomey bill was defeated on April 17, 2013, by a vote of 54–46; 60 votes would have been required to pass it.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"/&gt; Despite the fact that the bill did not pass, the NRA targeted Manchin in an attack ad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Friedman |first=Dan |title=Sen.

Manchin was criticized in 2013 for agreeing to an interview with ''[[The Journal (West Virginia newspaper)|The Journal]]'' in [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]], but demanding that he not be asked any questions about gun control or the Second Amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Simpson |first1=Connor |title=Sen.

In 2016, referring to the difficulty of keeping guns out of the hands of potential terrorists, Manchin said, "due process is what's killing us right now." This comment drew the criticism of both the [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] and the [[Cato Institute]], which accused Manchin of attacking a fundamental constitutional principle.

In 2010, Manchin called for "repairs" of the Affordable Care Act and repeal of the "bad parts of Obamacare".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/joe-manchin-obamacare-fixes-233541 |title=Manchin: I'll help GOP 'repair' Obamacare |first=Elana |last=Schor |date=January 12, 2017 |website=Politico |access-date=September 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/17/upshot/democrats-campaign-ads-pre-existing-conditions.html |title=No. 1 Aim of Democratic Campaign Ads: Protect Pre-existing Conditions |first=Margot |last=Sanger-Katz |date=September 17, 2018 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=September 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 14, 2017, Manchin expressed concern at the strict party-line vote on repealing Obamacare and said he could not, in good conscience, vote to repeal without a new plan in place.

During 2016-17, Manchin read to the Senate several letters from constituents about loved ones' deaths from opioids and urged his colleagues to act to prevent more deaths. Manchin took "an unusual proposal" to President Trump to address the crisis and called for a "war on drugs" that involves not punishment but treatment. He proposed the LifeBOAT Act, which would fund treatment.

In an interview with ''[[The Associated Press]]'', Manchin cited the advice of retired military chaplains as a basis for his decision to vote against repeal.&lt;ref name="Chaplains"&gt;{{cite web |title=Manchin: Chaplains May Leave Military If 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' is Repealed |date=December 3, 2010 |website=WOWK-TV |url=http://www.wowktv.com/story.cfm?func=viewstory&amp;storyid=90524 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101211105707/http://wowktv.com/story.cfm?func=viewstory&amp;storyid=90524 |archivedate=December 11, 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also indicated he wanted more time to "hear the full range of viewpoints from the citizens of West Virginia."&lt;ref name="Knezevich DADT"&gt;{{cite news |last=Knezevich |first=Alison |title=Manchin lone Democrat to oppose 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' repeal |url=http://www.wvgazette.com/News/201012091323 |accessdate=December 10, 2010 |newspaper=[[Charleston Gazette]] |date=December 9, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212235141/http://www.wvgazette.com/News/201012091323 |archivedate=December 12, 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A day later, he was publicly criticized at a gay rights rally for his position on the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Joe Manchin booed over 'Don't ask' vote |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1210/46244.html |website=Politico |first=Scott |last=Wong |date=December 10, 2010 |accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2013}}, he was one of three Democratic senators who still opposed same-sex marriage, and {{as of|2015|lc=y}}, he was the only Democratic senator who opposed gay marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/03/02/manchin-wont-back-dem-effort-support-marriage/ |title=Manchin won't back Dems effort in support of marriage equality |date=March 2, 2015 |newspaper=[[Washington Blade]] |access-date=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' attributed his opposition to "ideology, rather than electoral concerns," noting his votes against the repeal of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" and for the [[Defense of Marriage Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Enten |first1=Harry J. |title=The final three: the Democratic senators against gay marriage |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/10/last-democrats-against-gay-marriage |date=April 10, 2013 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Human Rights Campaign]], a PAC which supports same-sex marriage and other [[LGBT]] rights, gave Manchin an 85% scoring in line with their positions in 2016, a 0% in 2014, and a 65% in 2012.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Senior citizens====
To help locate missing senior citizens, Manchin introduced the [[Silver Alert]] Act in July 2011 to create a nationwide network for locating missing adults and senior citizens modeled after the [[AMBER Alert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wvmetronews.com/news.cfm?func=displayfullstory&amp;storyid=44122 |title=West Virginia Metro News |website=West Virginia Metro News |accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchin also sponsored the National Yellow Dot Act to create a voluntary program that would alert emergency services personnel responding to car accidents of the availability of personal and medical information on the car's owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsandsentinel.com/page/content.detail/id/557859/Bill-unveiled-for-seniors-in-emergency-situations.html?nav=5061 |title=Bill unveiled for seniors in emergency situations |newspaper=The Parkersburg News and Sentinel |accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manchin said in 2014 that he "would change Social Security completely. I would do it on an inflationary basis, as far as paying into payroll taxes, and change that, to keep us stabilized as far as cash flow. I'd do COLAs—I'd talk about [[Cost of living|COLA]] for 250 percent of poverty guidelines." Asked whether this meant he would "cut benefits to old people," Manchin said that "a rich old person...won't get the COLAs." He asked: "Do you want [[United States Chained Consumer Price Index|chained CPI]]? I can live with either one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weigel |first1=David |title=Joe Manchin, Grover Norquist, and the Economic Consensus of #ThisTown |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2014/03/18/joe_manchin_grover_norquist_and_the_economic_consensus_of_thistown.html |date=March 18, 2014 |website=Slate |accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Supreme Court nominations====
Manchin was the first Democrat to say he would vote for Trump's first nominee for the Supreme Court, [[Neil Gorsuch]]. Manchin said, "During his time on the bench, Judge Gorsuch has received praise from his colleagues who have been appointed by both Democrats and Republicans. He has been consistently rated as a well-qualified jurist, the highest rating a jurist can receive, and I have found him to be an honest and thoughtful man."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://wvrecord.com/stories/511099958-law-courts-manchin-becomes-first-democrat-to-say-he-ll-vote-for-gorsuch |title=Manchin becomes first Democrat to say he'll vote for Gorsuch |last=Dickerson |first=Chris |date=March 30, 2017 |newspaper=West Virginia Record |access-date=December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the first Democrat to announce that he would meet with Trump's second Supreme Court nominee, [[Brett Kavanaugh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/07/25/supreme-court-pick-shakes-up-west-virginia-senate-race.html |title=Supreme Court pick shakes up West Virginia Senate race |last=Doocy |first=Peter |date=July 25, 2018 |website=Fox News |access-date=July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchin was the only Democrat to vote 'yes' on the cloture of Kavanaugh's nomination, advancing the motion to a final vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/05/manchin-murkowski-vote-buck-party-lines-in-key-vote-on-kavanaugh.html |title=Facing pressure at home, Manchin and Murkowski buck party lines in key vote on Kavanaugh |last=Higgins |first=Tucker |date=October 5, 2018 |website=CNBC |access-date=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 5, 2018, he announced he would vote to confirm Kavanaugh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fandos |first1=Nicholas |last2=Stolberg |first2=Sheryl |title=Collins and Manchin Will Vote for Kavanaugh, All but Ensuring His Confirmation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/05/us/politics/brett-kavanaugh-vote-confirmed.html |accessdate=October 5, 2018 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 6, Manchin was the only Democrat to vote to confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court in a 50-48 count.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/06/us/politics/kavanaugh-live-vote-senate-confirmation.html |title=How Every Senator Voted on Kavanaugh's Confirmation |last=Daniel |first=Annie |date=October 6, 2018 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=October 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Taxes====
According to ''[[Politico]]'', Manchin sees Trump's [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]] as "a closed process" that "makes little impact in the paychecks of the people in his state." At the same time, he posited the bill contains "some good things...Initially people will benefit", although ultimately voting against it. In turn, NRSC spokesman Bob Salera stated that he had "turned his back and voted with Washington Democrats."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dovere |first1=Edward-Isaac |title='I Was An Easy Pickup': How Trump Lost Manchin on Taxes |url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/12/19/joe-manchin-interview-trump-franken-podcast-216118 |date=December 19, 2017 |website=Politico |accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Drucker |first1=David M. |title=Joe Manchin struggles to explain opposition to GOP tax bill |url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/joe-manchin-struggles-to-explain-opposition-to-gop-tax-bill |date=December 20, 2017 |website=[[The Washington Examiner]] |accessdate=March 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Terrorism====
In June 2017, he was one of five Democrats who, by voting against a Senate resolution disapproving of arms sales to [[Saudi Arabia]], ensured its failure. Potential primary opponent [[Paula Jean Swearengin]] charged that because of Manchin's vote, weapons sold to the Saudis "could possibly end up in the hands of terrorists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jilani |first1=Zaid |title=Joe Manchin was one of five Democrats who saved Saudi arms sales.

==Personal life==
Manchin is a member of the [[National Rifle Association]] and a licensed pilot.&lt;ref name="USNews" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Governor Manchin Speaks Out on Pro-Life |url=http://www.wvnstv.com/story.cfm?func=viewstory&amp;storyid=6580 |date=November 11, 2005 |accessdate=May 11, 2009 |website=WVNS-TV |publisher=West Virginia Media Holdings, LLC |last=Jones |first=Katherine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826025257/http://www.wvnstv.com/story.cfm?func=viewstory&amp;storyid=6580 |archivedate=August 26, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=W.Va.

Together they have three children: [[Heather Bresch|Heather]], Joseph IV, and Brooke.&lt;ref name="USNews" /&gt;

In 2006 and 2010 Manchin delivered commencement addresses at [[Wheeling Jesuit University]] and at [[Davis &amp; Elkins College]], receiving honorary degrees from both institutions.

In December 2012, Manchin voiced his displeasure with [[MTV]]'s new reality show ''[[Buckwild (TV series)|Buckwild]]'', set in his home state's capital Charleston, and asked the network's president to cancel the show, which, he argued, depicted West Virginia in a negative, unrealistic fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/wp/2012/12/07/joe-manchin-objects-to-mtvs-buckwild-reality-show/ |title=Joe Manchin objects to MTV's 'Buckwild' reality show |last=O'Keefe |first=Ed |date=December 7, 2012 |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show ended after its first season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  |title=Buckwild |date=January 3, 2013 |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2555880/ |website=[[IMDb]] |accessdate=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Heather Bresch===
[[West Virginia University]] (WVU) awarded Manchin's daughter, [[Heather Bresch]], an [[MBA]] in 2007, the year she became [[Chief Operations Officer|COO]] at [[Mylan Inc.]], the third largest generic pharmaceutical manufacturer in the U.S. with headquarters in Morgantown, adjacent to the WVU campus. The ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' reported that in order to justify this degree, university officials had added courses to her transcript that she had never taken and altered grades she had received. The ensuing controversy resulted in the rescinding of her MBA and the resignation of the university president, Mike Garrison, a Manchin family friend, and Garrison's legal counsel and the Dean of the Business School. A panel was convened to fully investigate the measure.&lt;ref name="huntingtonnews.net"&gt;{{cite news |title=Joe Manchin III: The Harry Houdini of West Virginia Politics |url=http://www.huntingtonnews.net/8650 |newspaper=The Huntington News |accessdate=April 26, 2012 |date=September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the MBA controversy erupted, according to ''[[The Huntington News]]'', Manchin "act[ed] as though he and his wife, Gayle, were somehow the victims of this hoax that almost cost WVU its academic credibility." According to the Huntington News, "the Manchins were seen as people willing to destroy [the university's] reputation rather than admit a mistake."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/opinion/editorials/message-for-wvu-the-board-of-governors-must-restore-credibility-394283 |title=Message for WVU: The board of governors must restore credibility |newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=May 16, 2008 |accessdate=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noting in a December 2011 editorial that the magazine ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' had promoted Heather Bresch as an "American hero" owing to her support for a pharma safety law, the ''Huntington News'' pointed out that the law also protected U.S. pharma firms like Mylan and suggested that the article was a "public makeover" engineered by "the Manchin public relations machine." It also said that Mylan "must have the only corporate Board of Directors in the country that doesn't care about one of their top execs being proven to have a phony MBA degree."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Editorial: The Manchin PR Machine Keeps Rollin'. But Who Buys It? |url=http://www.huntingtonnews.net/8650 |newspaper=The Huntington News |accessdate=March 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Manchin's call for a war on drugs, particularly opioids, and his charge that "Big Pharma" had "targeted" his state, Manchin's daughter, as noted, is the CEO of Mylan, a pharmaceutical firm that produces opioids, and Manchin himself accepted "nearly $180,000 in donations from pharmaceutical companies between 2011 and 2016."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Siegel |first1=Zachary |title=West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin: We Need To Declare A War on Drugs |url=https://www.thefix.com/west-virginia-senator-joe-manchin-we-need-declare-war-drugs |date=December 22, 2016 |website=The Fix |accessdate=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, ''[[Fortune Magazine]]'' and the ''[[Washington Post]]'' ran a total of three articles about the fact that the "CEO of the company at the center of the [[EpiPen]] controversy" was Manchin's daughter. The articles noted that skyrocketing EpiPen costs were "the next big flash point in the national debate over skyrocketing prescription drug prices," that Bresch had originally gotten her Mylan job through her father, and that her career had "risen along with her father's, a fact that has not gone unnoticed by her critics." A particular point of controversy was the fact that Bresch had transferred Mylan's official headquarters to the Netherlands, a tax dodge maneuver known as [[tax inversion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wieczner |first1=Jen |title=The Truth About Mylan CEO's 'Heather Bresch Situation' and Her MBA |url=http://fortune.com/2016/08/26/epipen-mylan-ceo-interview-heather-bresch-mba/ |date=August 26, 2016 |website=Fortune |accessdate=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family lawsuit===
In a lawsuit filed in July 2014, Dr. John Manchin II, one of Joe Manchin's brothers, sued Joe Manchin and his other brother, Roch Manchin, over a $1.7 million loan. The lawsuit alleged that Joe and Roch Manchin borrowed the money to keep the doors open at the family-owned carpet business run by Roch, that no part of the loan had yet been repaid, and that the defendants had taken other measures to evade compensating John Manchin II for non-payment.&lt;ref name="ManchinBadLoan"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/25/us-sen-joe-manchin-sued-by-brother-over-loan/ |title=Joe Manchin sued by brother over loan |date=July 25, 2014 |newspaper=The Washington Times |accessdate=January 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Manchin withdrew the suit on June 30, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gallagher |first1=Emily |newspaper=[[Times West Virginian]] |title=John Manchin drops lawsuit against two brothers |date=June 30, 2015 |url=http://wvpress.org/news/john-manchin-drops-lawsuit-against-two-brothers/ |accessdate=November 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manchin's coal interests===
In July 2011, ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran a long article headlined "Sen. Manchin Maintains Lucrative Ties to Family-Owned Coal Company." Manchin's 2009 and 2010 financial disclosures included major earnings from Enersystems Inc., "a coal brokerage that he helped run before his political star rose." Many senators earn business income, but Manchin is rare in that "he derives income from an industry while acting as one of its biggest boosters."&lt;ref name="lucrative-ties"/&gt;

===Skipping votes and convention===
On December 18, 2010, Manchin skipped the vote to repeal Don't Ask, Don't Tell and the vote on the [[DREAM Act]], regarding immigration. The [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]] criticized Manchin for attending a family Christmas gathering instead of voting on these important issues. "For a Senator who has only been on the job a few weeks," commented the NRSC, "Manchin's absence today, and the apparent lack of seriousness with which he takes the job he was elected to do, speaks volumes."&lt;ref name="Skip votes"&gt;{{cite web |title=Joe Manchin Skipped DREAM And DADT Votes For A Christmas Party |first=Jillian

==Career==
Roth explored interactive theatrical experiences in the 1999 production of ''The Donkey Show'', a disco club event combining elements of both theater and nightlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/09/theater/09theater.html?_r=2&amp; |title=A New Force on Broadway |last=Cohen |first=Patricia |work=The New York Times|date=Sep 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performed in a New York nightclub, ''The Donkey Show'' invited audiences to watch the show around them on the dance floor, and then stay after the show to celebrate at the venue. Retelling the story of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' entirely through disco hits, ''The Donkey Show'' was described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "an indication of things to come in the theatre."  The show ran for six years in New York, and has toured internationally.

Roth followed ''The Donkey Show'' with a Broadway production of ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]''. Through the course of the run, the cast included [[Dick Cavett]], [[Joan Jett]], [[Luke Perry]], [[Sebastian Bach]], [[Ana Gasteyer]], and a rotation of guest narrators including [[Jerry Springer]], [[Penn &amp; Teller]], [[Robin Leach]], [[Sally Jessy Raphael]], [[Gilbert Gottfried]], [[Cindy Adams]], and [[Dave Holmes (actor)|Dave Holmes]]. Cited by ''Newsday'' as "the young blood Broadway so desperately craves," the show was nominated for a [[Tony award|Tony Award]] for Best Musical Revival in 2001. ''The Rocky Horror Show'' was nominated for four Tony Awards, five [[Drama Desk Award]]s, two [[Outer Critics Circle Award]]s, and a [[Drama League Award]].

Roth is also the Founder and CEO of social network website Culturalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2014/legit/people-news/jordan-roth-makes-legit-moves-in-digital-space-120104 |title=Jordan Roth Makes Legit Moves in Digital Space |last=Cox |first=Gordon |work=Variety|date=January 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also hosts a popular interview series "Broadway Talks" at the 92nd Street Y, facilitating one-on-one discussions with prominent Broadway actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.92y.org/BroadwayTalks |title=Broadway Talks with Jordan Roth |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |accessdate=  September 10, 2014 |website= 92Y.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent guests have included Bono and the Edge, Daniel Radcliffe, Harry Connick, Jr., Nathan Lane, Laura Linney, Elaine Stritch and Harvey Fierstein.

Roth created Givenik.com, a service allowing theatergoers to buy discounted tickets and give 5% of their ticket price to the charity of their choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://givenik.com/ |title=Givenik.com |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |accessdate= September 10, 2014 |website= Givenik.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Givenik.com currently supports over 500 charitable organizations from major national agencies to local PTA groups.

On television, Roth has appeared on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" as their Broadway correspondent, and has played himself in a recurring role on the NBC television series "Smash."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/jordan-roth-is-now-principal-owner-of-broadways-jujamcyn-theaters |title=Jordan Roth Is Now Principal Owner of Broadway's Jujamcyn Theaters |last=Jones |first=Kenneth |work=Playbill |date=January 22, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904200700/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/jordan-roth-is-now-principal-owner-of-broadways-jujamcyn-theaters |archivedate=September 4, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jorge Antonio''' (October 14, 1917{{spaced ndash}}February 11, 2007) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] business man and political figure, a close adviser to [[President of Argentina|President]] [[Juan Domingo Perón]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/Archivo/nota.asp?nota_id=883204 |title=Falleció el empresario peronista Jorge Antonio |date=13 February 2007 |newspaper=[[La Nación]] |language=es |accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and times==
Born '''Jorge Antonio Chibene''' in [[La Boca]], [[Buenos Aires]] to [[Syria]]n immigrants (his father was an émigré who arrived in Argentina from Syria in the 19th century, and whose name was Elias Antun Esquef), Antonio grew up in [[Uruguay]] and returned to Argentina at 17 years of age. He was an orderly at the [[Colegio Militar de la Nación|National Military Academy]] in 1942, and worked in several enterprises before being appointed as the representative of [[General Motors]] and [[Mercedes Benz]] in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-80341-2007-02-13.html |title=Murió Jorge Antonio, un peronista de la primera hora |date=13 February 2007 |newspaper=[[Página/12]] |language=es |accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this post, in 1949 he met Perón again, having first met him briefly in 1943, and would become one of Perón's most important advisers.&lt;ref name="Revista Arabe"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.revistaarabe.com.ar/entrevistas_Jorge_Antonio.asp |title=Entrevista a Jorge Antonio |last=Pigna |first=Felipe |date=January 2004 |website=Revista Arabe |language=es |access-date=1 September 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115214109/http://www.revistaarabe.com.ar/entrevistas_Jorge_Antonio.asp |archive-date=15 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antonio's fortune grew, connected with his friendship with Juan Duarte,  Perón's brother-in-law. In the 1950s, Antonio bought the media companies [[Radio Belgrano]], [[TV Pública Digital (Argentina)|Canal 7]] and the [[Télam]] agency. He also invested in agribusiness and owned a bank, building his importance to the Presidency. It was reported that his fortune grew in the ten years to 1955 to US$ 215 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,861748,00.html |title=Argentina: Wealth Recovery |date=19 December 1955 |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to opponents, Antonio's wealth became emblematic of the cronyism Perón encouraged during his Presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,824193,00.html?iid=chix-sphere |title=Argentina: Dictatorship &amp; Corruption |date=30 April 1956 |magazine=Time |accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his employees was [[Adolf Eichmann]], under his assumed name of Ricardo Clement.&lt;ref name="Revista Arabe"/&gt; Antonio admitted that he knew Eichmann's real identity.&lt;ref name=clarin&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2007/02/13/elpais/p-00701.htm |title=Murió Jorge Antonio, el hombre que conocía los mayores secretos de Perón |date=13 February 2007 |newspaper=[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]] |language=es |accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was often linked  with stories of '[[Nazi Gold]]', money brought to Argentina, the [[United States]], and other safe havens by [[Nazis]] fleeing [[Germany]].

When Perón was deposed by the [[Revolución Libertadora|military coup]] of September 1955, Antonio refused to leave the country and was arrested. He was imprisoned for 17 days on a boat, then in [[Ushuaia]] for a month and later in [[Río Gallegos]] for two years. His properties were seized, and stolen with corrupted judges, by the military. In March 1957, with other Peronist leaders, he escaped from the prison and took refuge in [[Chile]]. He was able to fight off Argentine extradition appeals and eventually the government of [[Chile]] granted him asylum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,809969,00.html |title=Chile: Let Jorge Do It |date=7 October 1957 |magazine=Time |accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years, he lived in [[Cuba]] and then in [[Spain]], where he lived for 20 years. Despite animosity from Perón's wife, [[Isabel Perón|Isabel]], and the couple's chief of staff and fortune-teller, [[José López Rega]],  Antonio was a prominent adviser and financier of the exiled populist leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Page |first=Joseph A. |title=Perón: A Biography |location=New York |publisher=[[Random House]] |date=1983 |isbn=978-0-39452-297-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the 1970s Antonio was displaced by [[López Rega]], and when Perón returned to his country and was [[Argentine general election, September 1973|re-elected]] to the Presidency in 1973, Antonio opted to stay in [[Madrid]]. Except for a short stay in July 1974, on the occasion of the death of his mentor, Antonio did not return to Argentina until 1977.

He was also friend of [[Carlos Saúl Menem]], under whose presidency he once again became an influential man in the Argentinian business world. He had introduced Menem, also the son of Syrians, to Perón in 1964, though Antonio later distanced himself from the colorful Menem, who abandoned much of the populist Peronist platform during his presidency, in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=clarin/&gt;

Antonio died in 2007, a few months short of his 90th birthday. He had five children with his first wife Esmeralda, and three more were adopted in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/archivo/Nota.asp?nota_id=883483 |title=Con Jorge Antonio desapareció la última leyenda del peronismo |date=14 February 2007 |newspaper=La Nación |language=es |accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Keeree Kanjanapas''' (Thai: คีรี กาญจนพาสน์; {{zh|t=黃創山|p=Huáng Chuàngshān}}; English: Wong Chong Shan) was born in Bangkok, Thailand in 1950. His family roots are in Chaozhou (Guangdong Province). He is a Thai entrepreneur with extensive business interests in mass transit and real estate in Thailand.  He is the founder and CEO of the [[BTS Group Holdings|Bangkok Mass Transit System PCL (BTSC)]] "[[BTS Skytrain]]".&lt;ref name="BusinessWeek - Executive Profile - Keeree Kanjanapas"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/businessweek/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=8892467&amp;ticker=BTS:TB&amp;previousCapId=9858081&amp;previousTitle=WORLDSEC%20LTD|title=BTS GROUP HOLDINGS PCL - EXECUTIVE PROFILE -  Keeree Kanjanapas|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek|BusinessWeek]]|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesasia/2013/07/03/keeree-kanjanapas-rides-the-skytrain-to-a-1-2-billion-fortune/#4d46b323125c|title=Keeree Kanjanapas Rides The Skytrain To A $1.2 Billion Fortune|last=Asia|first=Forbes|newspaper=Forbes|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Seiko S. A. ==
Keeree's father Mongkol Kanjanapas (黃子明) was a businessman born in Bangkok and based in both Thailand and Hong Kong. Mongkol founded [[Stelux Holdings]] (寶光實業) and was the importer of [[Seiko]] watches. Keeree decided to use football to promote the Seiko brand and founded one of the most famous and successful football teams ever in Hong Kong, [[Seiko Sports Association]] (精工), in the 1970s and 1980s. Keeree recruited top local player [[Wu Kwok Hung]] from [[South China AA]] by offering him a HK$40,000 annual salary. With Wu and a host of foreign players, the team won a total of nine [[Hong Kong First Division League]] titles including a record seven consecutive titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesasia/2016/11/29/against-all-odds-keeree-kanjanapas-built-bangkoks-mass-transit-systems/#198847e64658|title=Against All Odds, Keeree Kanjanapas Built Bangkok's Mass Transit Systems|newspaper=Forbes Asia|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, when his plans for a super league was turned down by the [[Hong Kong Football Association]], coupled with a Stelux business downturn, Keeree dissolved the football team after a full house farewell match for Wu Kwok Hung.{{CN|date=August 2017}}

== Personal life ==
Keeree is the 13th richest man in Thailand as of 2016, up from 19th in 2012. He is worth US$1.55 billion according to [[Forbes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/keeree-kanjanapas/|title=Keeree Kanjanapas|work=Forbes|accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manuel Espinosa Batista.jpg|thumbnail|Bust of Manuel Espinosa Batista in Casco Viejo, Panamá]]
'''Manuel Espinosa Batista''' (September 12, 1857 – November 27, 1919) was a [[Colombia]]n pharmacist turned politician who campaigned for a separate [[Panama]] state and became one of "Founders of the Republic". He is known for his philanthropy.

==Early life==
Born in [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manuel Espinosa Batista|url=http://micanaldepanama.com/nosotros/sobre-la-acp/historia-del-canal/proceres/manuel-espinosa-batista/|website=micanaldepanama.com|publisher=Canal de Panama|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colombia, his father was Manuel Espinosa and his mother was Purificación Batista. At the early age of 13 he traveled to the [[Isthmus of Panama]] after being encouraged to do so by his relatives in [[Panama]]. He started to work for a pharmacy, raising money to pay for his books and pharmaceutical studies. Eventually, he became an expert pharmacist and established a [[pharmacy]] on Central Avenue in 1882, in front of the Arias-Feraud house (now known as Casa de la Municipalidad). A few months later, his great friend Jose Gabriel Duque was given a government contract to create a National Lottery and Manuel became his guarantor. Later, in 1899, Manuel became president of the company. Manual invested in, and created other business ventures.

==Political career==
Manuel Espinosa Batista started his political life by winning a place in the city council from 1897 to 1898. He was a supporter of the separatist movement, which wanted the separation of Panama from Colombia. This group of separatists was formed by [[José Agustín Arango]], [[Manuel Amador Guerrero]], [[Nicanor de Obarrio]], [[Ricardo Arias]], [[Federico Boyd]], [[Carlos Constantino Arosemena]], [[Tomás Arias]], and Manuel Espinosa Batista. Nowadays they are called the "Founders of the Republic". [[José Agustín Arango]] organized meetings in the back part of the pharmacy owned by Manuel Espinosa Batista.

Panama achieved separation from Colombia on November 3, 1903. That night the local council proclaimed the separation and convened open [[Cabildo (council)|cabildo]] in [[Panama city]] the next day. During that cabildo, Panama independence was made official in an act signed by the members of the council and the citizens who attended the event. The President of the council [[Demetrio H. Brid]] appointed the Provisional Government Junta formed by: [[José Agustín Arango]], [[Tomás Arias]] and [[Federico Boyd]] - Manuel Espinosa Batista was appointed Deputy Member of the Provisional Government Junta, and his appointment was announce to each member by a note from [[Demetrio H. Brid]]. From November 9, 1903 to December 7, 1903 Manuel Espinosa Batista temporary replaced [[Federico Boyd]] within the Junta.

==Other Interests==
Manuel Espinosa Batista not only acquired great economic, social, and political position during his life, but he was also a philanthropist. He granted scholarships to various boys with little resources, if they had willingness to study, and sent them overseas. In 1885 there was a great fire in [[Colón, Panama|Colón]] and many houses were destroyed, so he donated money to build new houses for the people who had lost everything. He also donated money to build streets in Panama city, donated money for the city's electric lighting, and for the recollection of garbage.

As a member of the city council, if there was not enough money to complete a scheme for the city, he would finance projects from his own pocket.

He also supported the orphanage administrated by the [[Salesians of Don Bosco]]. That orphanage later become the Don Bosco Technical Institute (Instituto Técnico Don Bosco), a private catholic school, which has a small building named Manuel Espinosa Batista.

==Family Life==
He was married to Elisa Remón Escobar and they had seven children: María, Elisa, Isabel, Cecilia, Carmen, Raúl and Manuel Espinosa Remón. His wife, together with Hortensia de Alfaro, backed the closing show of the first art season in the Republic of Panama in 1910. This last show of the season was in benefit of the old people's home Bolívar and the children's orphanage.

==Legacy==
Manuel Espinosa Batista died at the age of 62, on November 27, 1919. the day before the 63rd birthday of the President [[Belisario Porras]].

On December 16, 1924, the National Assembly of Panama, passed a law to commission a bronze bust sculpture of Manuel Espinosa Batista with the legend "Founder of the Republic", together with other busts of [[José Agustín Arango]], [[Tomás Arias]] and [[Federico Boyd]], members of the Provisional Government Junta and the bust of [[Manuel Amador Guerrero]], the first President of the Republic of Panama.

These busts are located in Independence Square, or Plaza Catedral, in Panama City. Later the busts of other members of the separatist movement were added to the square.

A public school and an avenue in Panama are named after Manuel Espinosa Batista.

'''"Mercy Medical Center"''' is a hospital located in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. Mercy has been recognized as the #2 hospital in the State of Maryland for 2014-15 by U.S. News &amp; World Report.

==Current Facility==
The landmark McCauley Tower building of the hospital along St. Paul Place to the west of North Calvert Street, opened in 1963 and is located at 301 St. Paul Place. Its form was quite unusual in that the upper two-thirds of the building of tan/light brown bricks spread out fifty yards out above the lower five stories.  Additionally the later Mary Bunting Tower skyscraper buildings and annexes further north along the east side of St. Paul Place and North Calvert Street to East Pleasant Street, and to the next block at the elevated Orleans Street Viaduct (over Bath Street) were built in the mid-2010s with additional parking garages attached to the east along Guilford Avenue.

==History==
===Founding===
Historically, Mercy was founded as '''"Baltimore City Hospital"''' by six [[Sisters of Mercy]], a Roman Catholic order of nuns, on November 11, 1874, which was a merger of the Washington University School of Medicine [not the same institution with a similar name now located in St. Louis, Missouri]; (also known as a later re-incarnation of the [[Washington Medical College]] of Baltimore and the College of Physicians and Surgeons,  earlier institutions from 1870, that the Sisters had been invited to assist with by local doctors.  Their buildings were located at the northwest corner of North Calvert and East Saratoga Streets, among which was a former schoolhouse and consisted of a medical dispensary under the later name of "Baltimore City Hospital" ((not to be confused with an earlier Baltimore Town and later municipal "Almshouse" (founded 1773), which relocated to the eastern city limits and became known as the "Bay View Asylum", and later known by the 1930s as "The Baltimore City Hospitals" off Eastern Avenue beyond the outer city neighborhoods of [[Highlandtown, Baltimore|Highlandtown]], [[Canton, Baltimore|Canton]] and [[Greektown, Baltimore|Greektown]]. It was west of the large suburban areas in [[Baltimore County]] of [[Essex, Maryland|Essex]], [[Middle River, Maryland|Middle River]], and northwest of [[Dundalk, Maryland|Dundalk]] and [[Sparrows Point, Maryland|Sparrows Point]]. It was acquired from the City in  1984 by [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] and [[Johns Hopkins University]] at the beginning of their joint expanded statewide medical system, and renamed "Francis Scott Key Medical Center", then later [[Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center]])). A collection of Baltimore City Hospitals' papers can be found at the National Library of Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oculus.nlm.nih.gov/bch121|title= Baltimore City Hospitals Records 1952-1965|publisher=National Library of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion===
Initially, the Mercy Hospital expanded to the north with buildings along Calvert Street towards East Pleasant Street. By the mid-1950s, the Hospital acquired the structures to the west along St. Paul Street/former Courtland Street, north of East Saratoga and south of East Pleasant Streets, which formerly housed the offices of the Baltimore City Department of Public Welfare (later known as Social Services).  These buildings had served the poor and destitute of Baltimore for several decades and a newer renovated structure was now being created on Greenmount Avenue near East Oliver Streets by the Green Mount Cemetery in the early 1950s. So the old Public Welfare structures were available for Mercy to expand into temporarily and later to replace with a new landmark symbol and tower.

Eventually the Mercy medical hospital and nursing school expanded to the west along East Saratoga Street to the neighboring Saint Paul Place&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdmercy.com/hospitalServices/AboutMercyFAQ/history.html About Mercy - History - Mercy]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reynolds Securities''' was a publicly traded brokerage firm.  Founded in 1931 by [[Richard S. Reynolds, Jr.]], the firm merged with [[Dean Witter Reynolds#Dean Witter &amp; Co. (1924-1978)|Dean Witter &amp; Co.]] to form [[Dean Witter Reynolds|Dean Witter Reynolds Organization Inc.]] in 1978, which was then the biggest merger in the history of [[Wall Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/04/archives/witter-reynolds-set-biggest-merger-in-wall-st-history-consolidation.html|title=WITTER, REYNOLDS SET BIGGEST MERGER IN WALL ST.

The firm's tagline, "We work for a world of investors.  One at a time." was adapted to "We measure success one investor at a time" and was used by [[Dean Witter]] and later [[Morgan Stanley]].

==History==

Reynolds &amp; Company was founded in 1931 in New York City by Richard S. Reynolds, Jr., a 22-year-old tobacco heir, together with Charles H. Babcock and Thomas F. Staley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1980/10/06/richard-s-reynolds-jr-dies-at-72/0f0f3ac9-e572-4fc4-85c4-754da27b32d2/|title=Richard S. Reynolds Jr. Dies at 72|date=1980-10-06|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/11/Morgan-Stanley-Dean-Witter-Company.html|title=Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Company - Company Profile, Information, Business Description, History, Background Information on Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Company|website=www.referenceforbusiness.com|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/18419892/charles-henry-babcock|title=Charles Henry Babcock (1899-1967) - Find A Grave...|website=www.findagrave.com|access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Thomas F. Staley was Reynolds’ cousin (the grandson of Major D. Reynolds, an older brother of R.J. Reynolds). In 1951, another senior partner, John D. Baker, joined the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/25/obituaries/john-baker-dies-at-89-wall-street-executive.html|title=John Baker Dies at 89; Wall Street Executive|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard S. Reynolds' father [[Richard S. Reynolds, Sr.]] founded [[U.S. Foil Company]], later [[Reynolds Metals]] (Reynolds wrap), and his great uncle was the founder of [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] (RJR). 

Like [[Dean Witter Reynolds#Dean Witter &amp; Co. (1924-1978)|Dean Witter &amp; Co.]], the company survived the Depression, generating a profit each year.  In 1934, Reynolds acquired F.A. Willard &amp; Co.&lt;ref&gt;Owen, David.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=iEwE89P6hr8C&amp;pg=RA1-PA74 The Making of the Masters].  1999&lt;/ref&gt;  With the acquisition, Reynolds tripled its sales and shifted its emphasis toward underwritings.&lt;ref name="DWHistory"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19970419005212/http://www.deanwitter.com/about/history.html Dean Witter History] (Archived).  Retrieved, June 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Reynolds passed its leadership to the next generation with Thomas F. Staley departing and naming Robert M. Gardiner to head the firm.  Under Gardiner, Reynolds embarks on major expansion,  acquiring 26 offices from A.M. Kidder &amp; Co.  Reynolds acquired another three offices and opened nine firms in new regions in the U.S. in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=DWHistory /&gt;

Reynolds was incorporated in 1971 as Reynolds Securities in advance of an initial public offering.  By early 1971, there was speculation that Merrill Lynch would sell shares to the public.  Reynolds initial public offering (and shortly thereafter Dean Witter's IPO) was part of a rush of Wall Street firms to sell an interest in their privately held businesses to public investors, following Merrill Lynch's initial public offering.&lt;ref name=newmoney&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902916,00.html New Money for Merrill Lynch]. Time Magazine, Apr. 26, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1976, Reynolds implements REYCOM, the most sophisticated high-speed wire system in the industry.  Meanwhile, the firm was continuing its expansion, acquiring its first international offices in [[Lugano]] and [[Lausanne, Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=DWHistory /&gt;  A year later, Reynolds acquired Baker Weeks &amp; Co. whose strength was securities research.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, John. [https://books.google.com/books?id=0R0WudQp0bcC&amp;pg=PA107 Struggle and survival on Wall Street]. 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of its merger with Dean Witter &amp; Co. in 1978, Reynolds Securities had over 3,100 employees in 72 offices producing gross revenues of nearly $120 million.&lt;ref name=DWHistory /&gt;

'''Sudono Salim''' (16 July 1916 – 10 June 2012), also known as '''Liem Sioe Liong''', was an [[Indonesian Chinese]] businessman of [[Fuqing]] origin. He was the richest individual in [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name="Suryadinata 139"&gt;{{Harvnb|Suryadinata|1995|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the founder and chairman of the conglomerate [[Salim Group]] before turning over its management to his youngest son [[Anthoni Salim]] (now the fifth wealthiest person in Indonesia&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/lists/2011/80/indonesia-billionaires-11_Anthoni-Salim_QIPR.html Forbes.com]&lt;/ref&gt;) in 1992.

==Early life==
In 1916, Salim was born as Lim Sioe Liong (Lin Shaoliang), in [[Fuqing]], [[Fujian]], China, the second son of a father. According to the Chinese zodiac, he was born in the Year of the Dragon, on the seventh day of the seventh month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Borsuk|first1=Richard|last2=Chng|first2=Nancy|title=Liem Sioe Liong's Salim Group : the business pillar of Suharto's Indonesia|date=2013|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|isbn=9789814459570|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, he left Fujian to join his brother Lim Ke Lok and brother-in-law Zheng Xusheng in [[Medan]], [[North Sumatra]].&lt;ref name="Suryadinata 139" /&gt; Salim diversified their [[peanut oil]] trading business into the [[cocaine]] market, which was growing rapidly from demand for production.&lt;ref name="SCMP"&gt;{{cite news | title = A Tradition of Mistrust | url = http://special.scmp.com/wchal/background/ZZZKYOJ7CPC.html | work = [[South China Morning Post]] | date = 15 March 2000 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061019184037/http://special.scmp.com/wchal/background/ZZZKYOJ7CPC.html | archivedate = 19 October 2006 | accessdate = 31 January 2010 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Medan, he supplied soldiers of the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] with medical supplies and came into contact with [[Suharto]], an officer of the army. Salim denied allegations that he also provided arms to Indonesian soldiers to resist Dutch forces.&lt;ref name="Suryadinata 140"&gt;{{Harvnb|Suryadinata|1995|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; As soldiers seized Dutch businesses following independence, his business absorbed many of their assets and gained a monopoly in the clove market,&lt;ref name="SCMP" /&gt; but he denied working with Suharto in expanding his ventures.&lt;ref name="Suryadinata 141"&gt;{{Harvnb|Suryadinata|1995|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career and family==
{{See also|Salim Group}}
In 1952, after moving to [[Jakarta]], Salim expanded his trading business by establishing connections with other ethnic Chinese businessmen in [[Singapore]] and [[Hong Kong]]. His soap factory became one of the primary suppliers to the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]]. He later expanded into textiles and banking, eventually establishing the largest private bank in Indonesia—the [[Bank Central Asia]] (BCA). The bank was nationalized following the [[1997 Asian financial crisis|Asian financial crisis]].

In 1968, after a merger, he gained the right to a [[monopoly]] on clove importation. Bogasari, a joint venture with another Hokchia businessman became the largest producer of [[flour]] in Indonesia. These two companies were said to have provided him with the capital to establish the [[cement]] giant [[Indocement Tunggal Prakarsa|Indocement]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="Suryadinata 140" /&gt;

In 1990, he established the food manufacturer [[Indofood]], the country's largest maker of instant noodles.&lt;ref&gt;http://bschool.nus.edu.sg/Portals/0/images/Media/PrintMedia/2012/Jun/20120612_Suharto-assoc-who-helped-transform-Indonesia_FT.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Witular | first = Rendi A. | title = Salim in driving seat at Indofood | url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2004/06/26/salim-driving-seat-indofood.html | work = [[The Jakarta Post]] | date = 26 June 2004 | accessdate = 1 February 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110607055040/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2004/06/26/salim-driving-seat-indofood.html | archivedate = 7 June 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Salim handed over management of the conglomerate [[Salim Group]] to his son Anthony Salim.

By 1997, the Salim Group possessed [[United States dollar|US$]]20 billion in assets and included more than 500 companies employing over 200,000 Indonesians. When the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis|Asian Financial Crisis]] hit, the conglomerate incurred US$4.8 billion in debts&lt;ref name="BusinessWeek"&gt;{{cite news | last = Shari | first = Michael | title = Indonesia: A Tycoon Under Siege | url = http://www.businessweek.com/archives/1998/b3597087.arc.htm | work = [[BusinessWeek]] | date = 28 September 1998 | accessdate = 1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had to give up control of Bank Central Asia in 1998 to the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jakarta Takes Over Big Bank After Run|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/29/world/jakarta-takes-over-big-bank-after-run.html|accessdate=31 July 2016|work=The New York Times|date=May 29, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; BCA was 30% owned by two offsprings of Suharto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The family firm (Jul 24, 1997)|url=http://www.economist.com/node/598607|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[May 1998 Indonesian riots|May 1998 riots]], Salim fled to Singapore after a mob burned his home in [[Jakarta]]; his son remained to fight off the mobs and formed the Salim Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Vatikiotis | first = Michael | title = Indonesian Food Giant Undergoes a Transformation | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/26/business/worldbusiness/26noodle.html | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 26 November 2004 | accessdate = 1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually settled in [[Los Angeles]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="BusinessWeek" /&gt; ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine listed him as the 25th wealthiest businessperson in Southeast Asia in 2004 with a [[net worth]] of [[United States dollar|US$]]655 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Doebele | first = Justin | title = Liem Sioe Liong | url = https://www.forbes.com/finance/lists/76/2004/LIR.jhtml?passListId=76&amp;passYear=2004&amp;passListType=Person&amp;uniqueId=7QBC&amp;datatype=Person | publisher = [[Forbes]] | date = 27 August 2004 | accessdate = 31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salim has three sons and one daughter.&lt;ref name="Suryadinata 140" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Chelvi | first = S.

==Death==
On June 10, 2012, a month before his 96th birthday, Salim died from natural causes in [[Raffles Hospital]], Singapore. He is buried at the [[Lim Chu Kang]] Cemetery.

'''The Partnership for Excellence''' (formerly the ''Ohio Partnership for Excellence'') is a [[nonprofit organization]] that administers a state-level award program for performance excellence in Ohio, Indiana, and West Virginia. The award is based on the [https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/publications/criteria.cfm Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence], which are developed and maintained by the [https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/about/index.cfm Baldrige Performance Excellence Program], a program of the [https://www.nist.gov/index.html National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)].
__TOC__

==History==
The Ohio Partnership for Excellence was incorporated as a 501c(3) nonprofit organization in 1998 to provide state level Baldrige assessment services and resources for interested organizations. In 2011, it was renamed The Partnership for Excellence (TPE) to reflect regional expansion that includes the states of Indiana and West Virginia.&lt;ref name="regional expansion"&gt;[http://www.thepartnershipforexcellence.org/html/press_releases/press_release_07-28-11_Program_for_IN_&amp;_WV.htm Ohio Partnership for Excellence to Expand Programs to Indiana &amp; West Virginia], July 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first award cycle was completed in 1999-2000.

In January 2008, Dr. Elaine D. Edgar was appointed to Executive Director.&lt;ref name="New Director 2008"&gt;[http://www.thepartnershipforexcellence.org/html/press_releases/press_release_01-01-08_new_director.htm Announcement of a new Executive Director for the Ohio Partnership for Excellence], January 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After retirement from the role in March 2011, she was replaced by Colonel Alfred C. Faber, Jr. who was appointed to the position of President/CEO.&lt;ref name="New Director 2011"&gt;[http://www.thepartnershipforexcellence.org/html/press_releases/press_release_03-01-11_new_president-CEO.htm New OPE President / CEO Announced], March 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with the Baldrige Community==
*TPE is a member of the [http://www.baldrigepe.org/alliance/ Alliance for Performance Excellence] – a national network of state and local Baldrige-based awards programs.
*TPE Awards are based on the most recent Criteria for Performance Excellence – updated by the Baldrige Performance Excellence Program every two years.
*Starting in 2012, unless certain conditions are met, organizations from Ohio, Indiana, and West Virginia are eligible to apply for the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award only if they have been awarded TPE's ''Governor's Award of Excellence'' in the previous five years.&lt;ref name="New Eligibility Q&amp;A 2012"&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/publications/upload/Q-A_2012_Changes_to_Baldrige_Award_Eligibility.pdf Q&amp;A: 2012 Changes to Baldrige Award Eligibility], December 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eligibility Rules"&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/publications/award_application.cfm Baldrige Award Application Forms webpage], retrieved March 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
TPE is a membership organization composed of interested individuals and organizations throughout Ohio, Indiana, and West Virginia. TPE collects annual membership dues for the January to December membership year.

==Board of Examiners==
TPE's Board of Examiners is composed of volunteer individuals who successfully complete annual training on the [https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/publications/criteria.cfm Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence]. Advisors and examiners used during the awards process are drawn from the Board of Examiners.

==Product/Service==
TPE’s main product is a feedback report to the partnering organizations that successfully complete the award process. The report contains strengths as well as opportunities for improvement (OFI) derived from both the submitted application and a site visit. This is a distinct difference from the national Baldrige Award process&lt;ref name="Baldrige Application Form"&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/publications/upload/Baldrige_Award_Application_Forms.pdf Baldrige Award Application Form], page 2&lt;/ref&gt; where only organizations with highly graded applications are granted a site visit.

TPE also provides Baldrige-related educational services such as conferences, seminars, and direct partnering with individuals and organizations.

==TPE Awards Process==
TPE provides three options for organizations wanting to improve their organizational performance:

===Advising===
One or two advisors from TPE Board of Examiners meet with the leadership team of the partnering organization to review the Criteria for Performance Excellence and assist in developing a 5-page Organizational Profile. After review of the organizational profile, TPE provides the organization with a list of strengths and opportunities for improvement. Upon successful completion of this process, the organization receives a "Spirit" recognition award at TPE's annual ''Quest for Success'' conference.

===Partnering===
One or two advisors from TPE Board of Examiners meet with the leadership team of the partnering organization to develop a 25-page application addressing the Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence at the "overall" level. After review of this application, TPE provides the organization with a list of strengths and opportunities for improvement. Upon successful completion of this process, the organization receives a "Pioneer" recognition award at TPE's annual ''Quest for Success'' conference.

===Examining===
This is the traditional 50-page application assessment mirroring the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award's assessment cycle. Organizations participating in this option submit an ''Intent to Apply'' in October before the application due date in December each year. TPE assigns a team of 7 members from the Board of Examiners to review (independently and then by consensus) the application before a 3-day site visit is conducted. TPE then provides the organization with a list of strength and opportunities for improvement. Based on the recommendations of the examiners, TPE's Board of Trustees recognizes each organization with a Bronze, Silver, Gold, or Platinum Award at the annual ''Quest for Success'' conference.
:*Platinum Level - Also called the ''Governor's Award for Excellence''
:*Gold Level - Also called the ''Achievement of Excellence'' Award
:*Silver Level - Also called the ''Commitment to Excellence'' Award
:*Bronze Level - Also called the ''Pledge to Excellence'' Award
:*In 2007, TPE also recognized two organizations with the ''Executive Director's Special Distinction'' award.

==Past ''Platinum Level - Governor's Award for Excellence'' Award Recipients==
Note:
*The Partnership for Excellence does not necessarily recognize an organization at the Platinum level every year. Awards may have been given at the Gold, Silver, or Bronze Levels only (not listed here).

{{Transport}}

'''Transport''' or '''transportation''' is the movement of humans, animals and [[cargo|goods]] from one location to another. In other words the action of transportation is defined as a particular movement of an organism or thing from a point A to the Point B.  [[Modes of transport]] include [[aviation|air]], [[Ground transportation|land]] ([[rail transport|rail]] and [[road transport|road]]), [[ship transport|water]], [[cable transport|cable]], [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] and [[space transport|space]]. The field can be divided into [[infrastructure]], [[vehicle]]s and [[business operations|operations]]. Transport is important because it enables trade between people, which is essential for the development of [[civilization]]s.

Transport [[infrastructure]] consists of the fixed installations, including [[road]]s, [[railway]]s, [[airway (aviation)|airways]], [[waterway]]s, [[canal]]s and [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] and terminals such as [[airport]]s, [[train station|railway stations]], [[bus station]]s, [[warehouse]]s, trucking terminals, refueling depots (including fueling docks and [[fuel station]]s) and [[seaport]]s. Terminals may be used both for interchange of passengers and cargo and for maintenance.

Vehicles traveling on these networks may include [[automobile]]s, [[bicycles]], [[buses]], [[train]]s, [[truck]]s, [[helicopter]]s, [[watercraft]], [[spacecraft]] and [[fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]].

Operations deal with the way the vehicles are operated, and the procedures set for this purpose, including financing, legalities, and policies. In the transport industry, operations and ownership of infrastructure can be either public or private, depending on the country and mode.

Passenger transport may be [[public transport|public]], where operators provide scheduled services, or [[private transport|private]]. Freight transport has become focused on [[containerization]], although [[Bulk material handling|bulk transport]] is used for large volumes of durable items. Transport plays an important part in economic growth and [[globalization]], but most types cause [[air pollution]] and [[Land use|use large amounts of land]]. While it is heavily subsidized by governments, good planning of transport is essential to make traffic flow and restrain [[urban sprawl]].

==History==
{{Main|History of transport}}

[[File:Bullock team.jpg|thumb|A [[Cattle|bullock]] team hauling [[wool]] in [[Australia]]]]
Humans' first means of transport involved walking, running and swimming. The [[domestication]] of animals introduced a new way to lay the burden of transport on more powerful creatures, allowing the hauling of heavier loads, or humans riding animals for greater speed and duration. Inventions such as the wheel and the sled helped make animal transport more efficient through the introduction of [[vehicle]]s. Water transport, including rowed and sailed vessels, dates back to [[time immemorial]], and was the only efficient way to transport large quantities or over large distances prior to the [[Industrial Revolution]].

The first forms of [[road transport]] involved animals, such as [[horse]]s ([[Domestication of the horse|domesticated]] in the 4th or the 3rd millennium BCE), [[ox]]en (from about 8000 BCE)&lt;ref&gt;

or humans carrying goods over [[dirt]] tracks that often followed [[game (food)|game]] [[trail]]s. Many early civilizations, including those in [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]], constructed paved roads.  In [[classical antiquity]], the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] empires built stone-paved roads to allow armies to travel quickly. Deep roadbeds of crushed stone underneath kept such roads dry. The medieval [[Caliphate]] later built [[Tarmacadam|tar-paved]] roads. The first watercraft were [[canoe]]s cut out from [[tree trunk]]s. Early water transport was accomplished with ships that were either rowed or used the [[wind]] for propulsion, or a combination of the two. The importance of water has led to most cities that grew up as sites for trading being located on rivers or on the sea-shore, often at the intersection of two bodies of water. Until the Industrial Revolution, transport remained slow and costly, and production and consumption gravitated as close to each other as feasible.

[[File:First flight2.jpg|thumb|The [[Wright brothers]]' first flight in 1903]]
The [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 19th century saw a number of inventions fundamentally change transport. With [[telegraphy]], communication became instant and independent of the transport of physical objects. The invention of the [[steam engine]], closely followed by its application in [[rail transport]], made land transport independent of human or animal muscles. Both speed and capacity increased rapidly, allowing specialization through manufacturing being located independently of natural resources. The 19th century also saw the development of the [[steam ship]], which sped up global transport.

With the development of the [[Internal combustion engine|combustion engine]] and the automobile around 1900, road transport became more competitive again, and mechanical private transport originated. The first "modern" highways were constructed during the 19th century{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} with [[macadam]]. Later, [[Tarmacadam|tarmac]] and [[concrete]] became the dominant paving materials. In 1903 the [[Wright brothers]] demonstrated the first successful controllable [[airplane]], and after World War I (1914–1918) aircraft became a fast way to transport people and express goods over long distances.&lt;ref&gt;Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 158&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II (1939–1945) the automobile and airlines took higher shares of transport, reducing rail and water to freight and short-haul passenger services.&lt;ref name=cooper277&gt;Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 277&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific spaceflight began in the 1950s, with rapid growth until the 1970s, when interest dwindled. In the 1950s the introduction of [[containerization]] gave massive efficiency gains in freight transport, fostering [[globalization]].&lt;ref name=bcn21114&gt;Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 211–14&lt;/ref&gt; International air travel became much more accessible in the 1960s with the commercialization of the [[jet engine]]. Along with the growth in automobiles and motorways, rail and water transport declined in relative importance. After the introduction of the [[Shinkansen]] in Japan in 1964, high-speed rail in Asia and Europe started attracting passengers on long-haul routes away from the airlines.&lt;ref name=cooper277 /&gt;

Early in [[U.S. history]],{{when|date=February 2016}} [[privately held company|private]] [[joint-stock]] [[corporations]] owned most [[Navigable aqueduct|aqueducts]], [[bridge]]s, [[canals]], [[railroads]], [[roads]], and [[tunnels]]. Most such transportation infrastructure came under government control in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, culminating in the [[nationalization]] of inter-city passenger rail-service with the establishment of [[Amtrak]]. Recently,{{when|date=February 2016}} however, a movement to privatize roads and other infrastructure has gained some{{quantify|date=February 2016}} ground and adherents.&lt;ref&gt;

{{further|Timeline of transportation technology}}

==Mode==
{{Main|Mode of transport}}
A mode of transport is a solution that makes use of a particular type of vehicle, infrastructure, and operation. The transport of a person or of cargo may involve one mode or several of the modes, with the latter case being called intermodal or multimodal transport. Each mode has its own advantages and disadvantages, and will be chosen for a trip on the basis of cost, capability, and route.

===Human-powered===
{{Main|Human-powered transport}}
[[File:Sherpa carrying woods.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Human-powered transport]] remains common in developing countries.]]
Human-powered transport, a form of [[sustainable transportation]], is the transport of people and/or goods using [[human]] muscle-power, in the form of [[walking]], [[running]] and [[human swimming|swimming]]. Modern [[technology]] has allowed [[machine]]s to enhance human power. Human-powered transport remains popular for reasons of cost-saving, [[leisure]], [[physical exercise]], and [[environmentalism]]; it is sometimes the only type available, especially in underdeveloped or inaccessible regions.

Although humans are able to walk without infrastructure, the transport can be enhanced through the use of roads, especially when using the human power with vehicles, such as bicycles and [[inline skates]]. Human-powered vehicles have also been developed for difficult environments, such as snow and water, by [[watercraft rowing]] and [[skiing]]; even the air can be entered with [[human-powered aircraft]].

===Animal-powered===
{{Main|Animal-powered transport}}
Animal-powered transport is the use of [[working animal]]s for the movement of people and commodities. Humans may ride some of the animals directly, use them as [[pack animal]]s for carrying goods, or harness them, alone or in [[team]]s, to pull [[sled]]s or wheeled [[vehicle]]s.

===Air===
{{Main|Aviation}}
[[File:Airfrance.a318-100.f-guga.arp.jpg|thumb|An [[Air France]] [[Airbus]] [[Airbus A320 family|A318]] lands at [[London Heathrow Airport]].|alt=White jet aircraft coming into land, undercarriage fully extended. Under each wing is a turbofan engine]]
A [[fixed-wing aircraft]], commonly called airplane, is a heavier-than-air craft where movement of the air in relation to the wings is used to generate lift. The term is used to distinguish this from [[rotorcraft|rotary-wing aircraft]], where the movement of the lift surfaces relative to the air generates lift. A [[gyroplane]] is both fixed-wing and rotary wing. Fixed-wing aircraft range from small trainers and recreational aircraft to large [[airliner]]s and military cargo aircraft.

Two things necessary for aircraft are air flow over the wings for [[lift (soaring)|lift]] and an area for [[landing]]. The majority of aircraft also need an [[airport]] with the infrastructure to receive maintenance, restocking, refueling and for the loading and unloading of crew, cargo, and passengers. While the vast majority of aircraft land and take off on land, some are capable of take-off and landing on ice, snow, and calm water.

The aircraft is the second fastest method of transport, after the [[rocket]]. Commercial jets can reach up to {{convert|955|km/h|mph}}, single-engine aircraft {{convert|555|km/h|mph}}. Aviation is able to quickly transport people and limited amounts of cargo over longer distances, but incurs high costs and energy use; for short distances or in inaccessible places [[helicopter]]s can be used.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 281&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 28, 2009, ''The Guardian'' article notes that, "the WHO estimates that up to 500,000 people are on planes at any time."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8477508 Swine flu prompts EU warning on travel to US]. ''The Guardian.'' April 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land===
{{Main|Ground transportation}}
Land transport covers all land-based transportation systems that provide for the movement of people, goods and services. Land transport plays a vital role in linking communities to each other. Land transport is a key factor in [[urban planning]]. It consists of 2 kinds, rail and road.

====Rail====
{{Main|Rail transport}}
[[File:ICE1 Schellenberg.jpg|thumb|[[InterCityExpress]], a German [[high-speed rail|high-speed]] passenger train|alt=White electric train with red cheatline emerging from tunnel in the countryside]]
[[File:R160A E Train entering World Trade Center.jpg|thumb|right|The [[New York City Subway]] is the world's largest [[rapid transit]] system by length of routes and by number of [[train station|stations]].]]

Rail transport is where a [[train]] runs along a set of two parallel [[steel]] [[rail tracks#Railway rail|rails]], known as a railway or railroad. The rails are anchored [[perpendicular]] to [[railroad tie|ties]] (or sleepers) of timber, concrete or steel, to maintain a consistent distance apart, or [[rail gauge|gauge]]. The rails and perpendicular beams are placed on a foundation made of concrete or compressed [[soil|earth]] and [[gravel]] in a bed of ballast. Alternative methods include [[monorail]] and [[maglev (transport)|maglev]].

A train consists of one or more connected vehicles that operate on the rails. Propulsion is commonly provided by a [[locomotive]], that hauls a series of unpowered cars, that can carry passengers or freight. The locomotive can be powered by [[steam locomotive|steam]], [[diesel locomotive|diesel]] or by [[electric locomotive|electricity]] supplied by [[railway electrification system|trackside systems]]. Alternatively, some or all the cars can be powered, known as a [[multiple unit]]. Also, a train can be powered by [[horsecar|horses]], [[funicular|cables]], [[gravity]], [[pneumatics]] and [[gas turbine]]s. Railed vehicles move with much less friction than rubber tires on paved roads, making trains more [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficient]], though not as efficient as ships.

[[Inter-city rail|Intercity]] trains are long-haul services connecting cities;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper ''et al'', 1998: 279&lt;/ref&gt; modern [[high-speed rail]] is capable of speeds up to {{convert|350|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, but this requires specially built track. [[Regional rail|Regional]] and [[commuter rail|commuter]] trains feed cities from suburbs and surrounding areas, while intra-urban transport is performed by high-capacity [[tram]]ways and [[rapid transit]]s, often making up the backbone of a city's public transport. [[Freight trains]] traditionally used [[box car]]s, requiring manual loading and unloading of the [[cargo]]. Since the 1960s, [[container train]]s have become the dominant solution for general freight, while large quantities of bulk are transported by dedicated trains.

====Road====
{{Main|Road transport}}
[[File:Harborfreeway2.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Harbor Freeway]] is often heavily congested at rush hour in [[Downtown Los Angeles]].]]
A road is an identifiable [[route number|route]], way or [[trail|path]] between two or more [[location (geography)|places]].&lt;ref Name="Major_Roads_of_the_United_States"&gt;{{cite web |title=Major Roads of the United States |publisher=United States Department of the Interior |date=2006-03-13 |url=http://nationalatlas.gov/mld/roadtrl.html |accessdate=24 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070413153426/http://www.nationalatlas.gov/mld/roadtrl.html |archivedate=13 April 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roads are typically smoothed, [[pavement (material)|paved]], or otherwise prepared to allow easy travel;&lt;ref Name="RoadInfrastructureStrategicFrameworkforSouthAfrica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Road Infrastructure Strategic Framework for South Africa |publisher=National Department of Transport (South Africa) |date= |url=http://www.transport.gov.za/library/docs/rifsa/infor.html |accessdate=24 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927063243/http://www.transport.gov.za/library/docs/rifsa/infor.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though they need not be, and historically many roads were simply recognizable routes without any formal [[construction]] or [[maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]].&lt;ref&gt;Lay, 1992: 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; In [[urban area]]s, roads may pass through a [[city]] or [[village]] and be named as [[street]]s, serving a dual function as urban space [[easement]] and route.&lt;ref name="difference_between_road_and_street"&gt;{{cite web | title=What is the difference between a road and a street? |work=Word FAQ |publisher=Lexico Publishing Group |year=2007 |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/help/faq/language/d01.html |accessdate=24 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common road vehicle is the automobile; a [[wheel]]ed passenger vehicle that carries its own [[car engine|motor]]. Other users of roads include [[bus]]es, [[truck]]s, [[motorcycles]], [[bicycles]] and [[pedestrians]]. As of 2010, there were 1.015 billion automobiles worldwide.
Road transport offers a complete freedom to road users to transfer the vehicle from one lane to the other and from one road to another according to the need and convenience. This flexibility of changes in location, direction, speed, and timings of travel is not available to other modes of transport. It is possible to provide door to door service only by road transport.

Automobiles provide high flexibility with low capacity, but require high energy and area use, and are the main source of [[noise pollution|noise]] and [[air pollution]] in cities; buses allow for more efficient travel at the cost of reduced flexibility.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 278&lt;/ref&gt; Road transport by truck is often the initial and final stage of freight transport.

===Water===
{{Main|Ship transport}}
[[File:Negombo canal 2.jpg|thumb|left|Built by the Dutch to transport spices, now used by the local fishermen to get to the sea, [[Negombo]] Dutch canal, [[Sri Lanka]]]]

Water transport is movement by means of a [[watercraft]]—such as a [[barge]], [[boat]], [[ship]] or [[sailboat]]—over a body of water, such as a [[sea]], [[ocean]], [[lake]], [[canal]] or [[river]]. The need for buoyancy is common to watercraft, making the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] a dominant aspect of its construction, maintenance and appearance.

In the 19th century, the first [[steam ships]] were developed, using a [[steam engine]] to drive a [[paddle wheel]] or [[propeller]] to move the ship. The [[steam]] was produced in a [[boiler]] using wood or [[coal]] and fed through a steam [[external combustion engine]]. Now most ships have an [[internal combustion engine]] using a slightly refined type of [[petroleum]] called [[bunker fuel]]. Some ships, such as [[submarine]]s, use [[nuclear power]] to produce the steam. [[Recreation]]al or [[education]]al craft still use wind power, while some smaller craft use [[internal combustion engines]] to drive one or more [[propeller]]s, or in the case of jet boats, an inboard water jet. In shallow draft areas, [[hovercraft]] are propelled by large pusher-prop fans. (See [[Marine propulsion]].)

Although it is slow compared to other transportation, modern [[sea transport]] is a highly efficient method of transporting large quantities of goods. [[Commercial vessel]]s, nearly 35,000 in number, carried 7.4&amp;nbsp;billion tons of cargo in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;The [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) 2007, p. ''x'' and p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Transport by water is significantly less costly than air transport for transcontinental [[shipping]];&lt;ref&gt;Stopford, 1997: 4–6&lt;/ref&gt; [[short sea shipping]] and [[ferry|ferries]] remain viable in coastal areas.&lt;ref&gt;Stopford, 1997: 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 280&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other modes===
[[File:Trans-Alaska Pipeline System Luca Galuzzi 2005.jpg|thumb|[[Trans-Alaska Pipeline]] for [[crude oil]]|alt=Oil pipeline winding through cold Alaskan country-side. In the background are mountains, partly snow-capped]]
[[Pipeline transport]] sends goods through a [[pipe (material)|pipe]]; most commonly liquid and gases are sent, but [[pneumatic tube]]s can also send solid capsules using compressed air. For liquids/gases, any chemically stable liquid or gas can be sent through a pipeline. Short-distance systems exist for [[sewage]], [[slurry]], [[water]] and [[beer]], while long-distance networks are used for [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]].

[[Cable transport]] is a broad mode where vehicles are pulled by [[Wire rope|cables]] instead of an internal power source. It is most commonly used at steep [[gradient]]. Typical solutions include [[aerial tramway]], [[elevator]]s, [[escalator]] and [[ski lift]]s; some of these are also categorized as [[conveyor belt|conveyor]] transport.

[[Space transport|Spaceflight]] is transport out of Earth's atmosphere into [[outer space]] by means of a [[spacecraft]]. While large amounts of research have gone into technology, it is rarely used except to put satellites into orbit, and conduct scientific experiments. However, man has landed on the moon, and probes have been sent to all the planets of the Solar System.

[[Suborbital spaceflight]] is the fastest of the existing and planned transport systems from a place on Earth to a distant "other place" on Earth. Faster transport could be achieved through part of a [[low Earth orbit]], or following that trajectory even faster using the propulsion of the rocket to steer it.

==Elements==

===Infrastructure===
{{Main|Infrastructure}}
[[File:GoldenGateBridge BakerBeach MC.jpg|thumb|Bridges, such as [[Golden Gate Bridge]], allow roads and railways to cross bodies of water.]]
Infrastructure is the fixed installations that allow a vehicle to operate. It consists of a roadway, a terminal, and facilities for parking and maintenance. For rail, pipeline, road and cable transport, the entire way the vehicle travels must be constructed. Air and watercraft are able to avoid this, since the [[Airway (aviation)|airway]] and [[sea lane|seaway]] do not need to be constructed. However, they require fixed infrastructure at terminals.

Terminals such as airports, ports, and stations, are locations where passengers and freight can be transferred from one vehicle or mode to another. For passenger transport, terminals are integrating different modes to allow riders, who are interchanging between modes, to take advantage of each mode's benefits. For instance, [[airport rail link]]s connect airports to the city centers and suburbs. The terminals for automobiles are [[parking lot]]s, while buses and coaches can operate from simple stops.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper ''et al.'', 1998: 275–76&lt;/ref&gt; For freight, terminals act as [[transshipment]] points, though some cargo is transported directly from the point of production to the point of use.

The [[transport finance|financing]] of infrastructure can either be [[government|public]] or [[private enterprise|private]]. Transport is often a [[natural monopoly]] and a necessity for the public; roads, and in some countries railways and airports are funded through [[taxation]]. New infrastructure projects can have high costs and are often financed through [[debt]]. Many infrastructure owners, therefore, impose usage fees, such as [[landing fees]] at airports, or [[toll plaza]]s on roads. Independent of this, authorities may impose [[tax]]es on the purchase or use of vehicles. Because of poor forecasting and overestimation of passenger numbers by planners, there is frequently a benefits shortfall for transport infrastructure projects.&lt;ref&gt;Bent Flyvbjerg, Mette K. Skamris Holm, and Søren L. Buhl, "How (In)Accurate Are Demand Forecasts in Public Works Projects", ''Journal of the American Planning Association'' '''71''':2, pp. 131–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vehicles===
{{Main|Vehicle}}
[[File:1992 Fiat Uno IE 1.0 Front.jpg|thumb|A [[Fiat Uno]] in 2018]]
A vehicle is a non-living device that is used to move people and goods. Unlike the infrastructure, the vehicle moves along with the cargo and riders. Unless being pulled/pushed by a cable or muscle-power, the vehicle must provide its own propulsion; this is most commonly done through a [[steam engine]], [[Internal combustion engine|combustion engine]], [[electric motor]], a [[jet engine]] or a [[rocket]], though other means of propulsion also exist. Vehicles also need a system of converting the energy into movement; this is most commonly done through [[wheel]]s, [[propeller]]s and [[pressure]].

Vehicles are most commonly staffed by a [[driving|driver]]. However, some systems, such as [[people mover]]s and some rapid transits, are fully [[automation|automated]]. For [[passenger]] transport, the vehicle must have a compartment, seat, or platform for the passengers. Simple vehicles, such as automobiles, bicycles or simple aircraft, may have one of the passengers as a driver.

===Operation===
[[File:Incheon International Airport.jpg|thumb|[[Incheon International Airport]], South Korea|alt=Tilted aerial view of modern airport. Aircraft are parked next to "arms" that extend from the central building]]
Private transport is only subject to the owner of the vehicle, who operates the vehicle themselves. For public transport and freight transport, operations are done through [[private enterprise]] or by [[government]]s. The infrastructure and vehicles may be owned and operated by the same company, or they may be operated by different entities. Traditionally, many countries have had a [[flag carrier|national airline]] and [[railway company|national railway]]. Since the 1980s, many of these have been [[privatization|privatized]]. International shipping remains a highly competitive industry with little regulation,&lt;ref&gt;Stopford, 1997: 422&lt;/ref&gt; but ports can be public-owned.&lt;ref&gt;Stopford, 1997: 29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Policy===
As the population of the world increases, cities grow in size and population - according to the United Nations, 55% of the world’s population live in cities, and by 2050 this number is expected to rise to 68%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Meredith |first=Sam |date=2018-5-17 |title=Two-thirds of global population will live in cities by 2050, UN says |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/17/two-thirds-of-global-population-will-live-in-cities-by-2050-un-says.html |work=CNBC |access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public transportation policy must evolve to meet the changing priorities of the urban world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S038611121400017X |title=The evolution of urban mobility: The interplay of academic and policy perspectives |last=Jones |first=Peter |date=July 2014 |website=Science Direct |access-date=November 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institution of policy enforces order in transportation, which is by nature chaotic as people attempt to travel from one place to another as fast as possible. This policy helps to reduce accidents and save lives.

==Functions==
Relocation of travelers and cargo are the most common uses of transport. However, other uses exist, such as the strategic and tactical [[military logistics|relocation]] of [[armed force]]s during [[warfare]], or the civilian mobility construction or emergency equipment.

===Passenger===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from the redirect "Passenger transportation"; if the section title changes, please update the redirect accordingly. --&gt;
{{Main|Travel|Public transit}}
[[File:ACTION Bus-467.jpg|thumb|A local transit bus operated by [[ACTION]] in [[Canberra]], [[Australia]]|alt=Light green, orange and white bus stopping in front of multi-story building.]]
Passenger transport, or travel, is divided into [[public transport|public]] and [[private transport]]. Public transport is scheduled services on fixed routes, while private is vehicles that provide ad hoc services at the riders desire. The latter offers better flexibility, but has lower capacity, and a higher environmental impact. Travel may be as part of daily [[commuting]], for [[business travel|business]], leisure or [[human migration|migration]].

Short-haul transport is dominated by the automobile and mass transit. The latter consists of [[bus]]es in rural and small cities, supplemented with commuter rail, trams and [[rapid transit]] in larger cities. Long-haul transport involves the use of the automobile, trains, [[coach (vehicle)|coaches]] and aircraft, the last of which have become predominantly used for the longest, including intercontinental, travel. [[Intermodal passenger transport]] is where a journey is performed through the use of several modes of transport; since all human transport normally starts and ends with walking, all passenger transport can be considered intermodal. Public transport may also involve the intermediate change of vehicle, within or across modes, at a [[transport hub]], such as a [[bus station|bus]] or [[railway station]].

Taxis and buses can be found on both ends of the public transport spectrum. Buses are the cheapest mode of transport but are not necessarily flexible, and taxis are very flexible but more expensive. In the middle is [[demand-responsive transport]], offering flexibility whilst remaining affordable.

[[International travel]] may be restricted for some individuals due to legislation and [[visa (document)|visa]] requirements.

===Medical transport===
[[File:World War I ambulance Pittsburgh 20th Century Club.png|thumb|An ambulance from World War I]]An ambulance is a vehicle used to transport people from or between places of treatment,&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Alan Skinner|Skinner, Henry Alan]]. 1949, "The Origin of Medical Terms". Baltimore: Williams &amp; Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt; and in some instances will also provide out-of-hospital medical care to the patient. The word is often associated with road-going "emergency ambulances", which form part of [[emergency medical service]]s, administering [[emergency medicine|emergency care]] to those with acute medical problems.

''Air medical services'' is a comprehensive term covering the use of air transportation to move patients to and from healthcare facilities and accident scenes. Personnel provide comprehensive prehospital and emergency and critical care to all types of patients during aeromedical evacuation or rescue operations, aboard helicopters, propeller aircraft, or jet aircraft.&lt;ref name="pmid15928284"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Branas CC, MacKenzie EJ, Williams JC, Schwab CW, Teter HM, Flanigan MC | title=Access to trauma centers in the United States. | journal=JAMA | year= 2005 | volume= 293 | issue= 21 | pages= 2626–33 | pmid=15928284 | doi=10.1001/jama.293.21.2626 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=15928284  |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid7832345"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Burney RE, Hubert D, Passini L, Maio R | title=Variation in air medical outcomes by crew composition: a two-year follow-up. | journal=Ann Emerg Med | year= 1995 | volume= 25 | issue= 2 | pages= 187–92 | pmid=7832345 | doi= 10.1016/s0196-0644(95)70322-5|doi-access=free| pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=7832345  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freight===
{{Main|Shipping}}

Freight transport, or shipping, is a key in the [[value chain]] in manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 3&lt;/ref&gt; With increased specialization and [[globalization]], production is being located further away from consumption, rapidly increasing the demand for transport.&lt;ref&gt;Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 63–64&lt;/ref&gt; Transportation creates place utility by moving the goods from the place of production to the place of consumption. While all modes of transport are used for cargo transport, there is high differentiation between the nature of the cargo transport, in which mode is chosen.&lt;ref&gt;Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 54&lt;/ref&gt; [[Logistics]] refers to the entire process of transferring products from producer to consumer, including storage, transport, transshipment, warehousing, material-handling, and packaging, with associated exchange of information.&lt;ref&gt;Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Incoterm]] deals with the handling of payment and responsibility of [[risk]] during transport.&lt;ref&gt;Bardi, Coyle and Novack, 2006: 473&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WCML freight train.jpg|thumb|[[Freight train]] with [[shipping container]]s in the [[United Kingdom]]]]
[[Containerization]], with the standardization of [[ISO container]]s on all vehicles and at all ports, has revolutionized [[International trade|international]] and [[domestic trade]], offering a huge reduction in [[transshipment]] costs. Traditionally, all cargo had to be manually loaded and unloaded into the haul of any ship or car; containerization allows for automated handling and transfer between modes, and the standardized sizes allow for gains in [[economy of scale]] in vehicle operation. This has been one of the key driving factors in international trade and globalization since the 1950s.&lt;ref name=bcn21114 /&gt;

[[Bulk material handling|Bulk transport]] is common with cargo that can be handled roughly without deterioration; typical examples are [[ore]], coal, [[cereals]] and [[petroleum]]. Because of the uniformity of the product, mechanical handling can allow enormous quantities to be handled quickly and efficiently. The low value of the cargo combined with high volume also means that economies of scale become essential in transport, and gigantic ships and whole trains are commonly used to transport bulk. Liquid products with sufficient volume may also be transported by pipeline.

[[Cargo airline|Air freight]] has become more common for products of high value; while less than one percent of world transport by volume is by airline, it amounts to forty percent of the value. Time has become especially important in regards to principles such as [[postponement]] and [[just in time (business)|just-in-time]] within the value chain, resulting in a high willingness to pay for quick delivery of key components or items of high value-to-weight ratio.&lt;ref&gt;Chopra and Meindl, 2007: 328&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to mail, common items sent by air include [[electronics]] and [[fashion]] clothing.

==Impact==
{{Main|Sustainable transport}}

===Economic===
{{Main|Transport economics}}
[[File:SeattleI5Skyline.jpg|thumb|Transport is a key component of growth and globalization, such as in [[Seattle, Washington]], United States.|alt=Skyline of city at dawn. A major highway winds itself into the downtown area.]]

Transport is a key necessity for [[Departmentalization|specialization]]—allowing production and consumption of products to occur at different locations.  Throughout history transport has been a spur to expansion; better transport allows more [[trade]] and a greater spread of people. [[Economic growth]] has always been dependent on increasing the capacity and rationality of transport.&lt;ref&gt;Stopford, 1997: 2&lt;/ref&gt; But the infrastructure and operation of transport have a great impact on the land and is the largest drainer of energy, making [[transport sustainability]] a major issue.

Due to the way modern cities and communities are planned and operated, a physical distinction between home and work is usually created, forcing people to transport themselves to places of work, study, or leisure, as well as to temporarily relocate for other daily activities. Passenger transport is also the essence of [[tourism]], a major part of [[recreation]]al transport. Commerce requires the transport of people to conduct business, either to allow face-to-face communication for important decisions or to move specialists from their regular place of work to sites where they are needed.

===Planning===
{{Main|Transport planning}}

Transport planning allows for high utilization and less impact regarding new infrastructure. Using models of [[transport forecasting]], planners are able to predict future transport patterns. On the operative level, logistics allows owners of cargo to plan transport as part of the [[supply chain]]. Transport as a field is also studied through [[transport economics]], a component for the creation of regulation policy by authorities. [[Transport engineering]], a sub-discipline of [[civil engineering]], must take into account [[trip generation]], [[trip distribution]], [[mode choice]] and [[route assignment]], while the operative level is handled through [[traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineering]].

[[File:Old Market Roundabout, Bristol.jpg|thumb|The engineering of this [[roundabout]] in [[Bristol]], United Kingdom, attempts to make traffic flow free-moving.|alt=Aerial view of roundabout, a junction of several streets. Vehicles traverse around the roundabout, which is surrounded by buildings, mostly multi-storey]]
Because of the negative impacts incurred, transport often becomes the subject of controversy related to choice of mode, as well as increased capacity. Automotive transport can be seen as a [[tragedy of the commons]], where the flexibility and comfort for the individual deteriorate the natural and urban environment for all. [[land use|Density of development]] depends on mode of transport, with public transport allowing for better spatial utilization. Good land use keeps common activities close to people's homes and places higher-density development closer to transport lines and hubs, to minimize the need for transport. There are [[economies of agglomeration]]. Beyond transportation some land uses are more efficient when clustered. Transportation facilities consume land, and in cities, pavement (devoted to streets and parking) can easily exceed 20 percent of the total land use. An efficient transport system can reduce land waste.

Too much infrastructure and too much smoothing for maximum vehicle throughput means that in many cities there is too much traffic and many—if not all—of the negative impacts that come with it. It is only in recent years that traditional practices have started to be questioned in many places, and as a result of new types of analysis which bring in a much broader range of skills than those traditionally relied on—spanning such areas as environmental impact analysis, public health, sociologists as well as economists—the viability of the old mobility solutions is increasingly being questioned.

{{Main|Transport and the environment}}

Transport is a major use of [[energy (society)|energy]] and burns most of the world's [[petroleum]]. This creates air pollution, including [[nitrous oxide]]s and [[particulate]]s, and is a significant contributor to [[global warming]] through emission of [[carbon dioxide]],&lt;ref name = "pnas_pdf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/0702958104v1.pdf |title=Climate forcing from the transport sectors |author=Fuglestvet et al., [[Center for International Climate and Environmental Research]] |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which transport is the fastest-growing emission sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5579 |title=Analysis: Nano Hypocrisy? |author=[[Worldwatch Institute]] |date=16 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By subsector, road transport is the largest contributor to global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jan Fuglestvedt et al. |title=Climate forcing from the transport sectors |journal=[[PNAS]] |date=Jan 15, 2008 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0702958104 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/105/2/454.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[ Environmental regulation]]s in developed countries have reduced individual vehicles' emissions; however, this has been offset by increases in the numbers of vehicles and in the use of each vehicle.&lt;ref name="pnas_pdf" /&gt; Some pathways to reduce the carbon emissions of road vehicles considerably have been studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/carbon-pathways-analysis-informing-development-of-a-carbon-reduction-strategy-for-the-transport-sector.html |title=Claverton-Energy.com |publisher=Claverton-Energy.com |date=2009-02-17 |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Data on the barriers and motivators to more sustainable transport behaviour is available in the UK Department for Transport study "[http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/scienceresearch/social/climatechangetransportchoices/ Climate Change and Transport Choices] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530124709/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/scienceresearch/social/climatechangetransportchoices/ |date=2011-05-30 }}" published in December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Energy use and emissions vary largely between modes, causing [[environmentalism|environmentalists]] to call for a transition from air and road to rail and human-powered transport, as well as increased [[transport electrification]] and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]].

Other environmental impacts of transport systems include [[traffic congestion]] and automobile-oriented [[urban sprawl]], which can consume natural habitat and agricultural lands. By reducing transportation emissions globally, it is predicted that there will be significant positive effects on Earth's [[air quality]], [[acid rain]], [[smog]] and climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/cleanair-airpur/Transportation-WS800CCAF9-1_En.htm |title=Transportation |author=[[Environment Canada]] |accessdate=30 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713192836/http://www.ec.gc.ca/cleanair-airpur/Transportation-WS800CCAF9-1_En.htm |archivedate=July 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Profitable triangular arbitrage is very rarely possible because when such opportunities arise, traders execute trades that take advantage of the imperfections and prices adjust up or down until the opportunity disappears.&lt;ref name="Ozyasar 2013"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Strategy for FOREX Triangulation | author = Ozyasar, Hunkar | date = 2013 | publisher = The Nest | url = http://budgeting.thenest.com/strategy-forex-triangulation-21257.html | accessdate = 2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross exchange rate discrepancies==
Triangular arbitrage opportunities may only exist when a [[bank]]'s quoted exchange rate is not equal to the market's implicit cross exchange rate. The following equation represents the calculation of an implicit cross exchange rate, the exchange rate one would expect in the market as implied from the ratio of two currencies other than the base currency.&lt;ref name="Feenstra &amp; Taylor 2008"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Macroeconomics | author = Feenstra, Robert C. | author2 = Taylor, Alan M. | year = 2008 | publisher = Worth Publishers | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-1-4292-0691-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levi 2005"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Finance, 4th Edition | author = Levi, Maurice D. | year = 2005 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-415-30900-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S_{a/\$} = S_{a/b} S_{b/\$}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;S_{a/\$}&lt;/math&gt; is the implicit cross exchange rate for dollars in terms of currency ''a''
:&lt;math&gt;S_{a/b}&lt;/math&gt; is the quoted market cross exchange rate for b in terms of currency ''a''
:&lt;math&gt;S_{b/\$}&lt;/math&gt; is the quoted market cross exchange rate for dollars in terms of currency ''b''

If the market cross exchange rate quoted by a bank is equal to the implicit cross exchange rate as implied from the exchange rates of other currencies, then a no-arbitrage condition is sustained.&lt;ref name="Feenstra &amp; Taylor 2008" /&gt; However, if an inequality exists between the market cross exchange rate, &lt;math&gt;S_{a/\$}&lt;/math&gt;, and the implicit cross exchange rate, &lt;math&gt;S_{a/b} S_{b/\$}&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists an opportunity for arbitrage profits on the difference between the two exchange rates.&lt;ref name="Madura 2007" /&gt;

==Mechanics of triangular arbitrage==
[[File:Triangular-arbitrage.svg|thumb|right|A visual representation of a realistic triangular arbitrage scenario, using sample bid and ask prices quoted by international banks.]]
Some international banks serve as [[market maker]]s between currencies by narrowing their [[bid-offer spread|bid-ask spread]] more than the bid-ask spread of the implicit cross exchange rate. However, the bid and ask prices of the implicit cross exchange rate naturally discipline market makers. When banks' quoted exchange rates move out of alignment with cross exchange rates, any banks or traders who detect the discrepancy have an opportunity to earn arbitrage profits via a triangular arbitrage strategy.&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011" /&gt; To execute a triangular arbitrage trading strategy, a bank would calculate cross exchange rates and compare them with exchange rates quoted by other banks to identify a pricing discrepancy.

For example, [[Citibank]] detects that [[Deutsche Bank]] is quoting dollars at a [[bid price]] of 0.8171 €/$, and that [[Barclays]] is quoting pounds at a bid price of 1.4650 $/£ (Deutsche Bank and Barclays are in other words willing to buy those currencies at those prices). Citibank itself is quoting the same prices for these two exchange rates. A trader at Citibank then sees that [[Crédit Agricole]] is quoting pounds at an [[ask price]] of 1.1910 €/£ (in other words it is willing to sell pounds at that price). While the quoted market cross exchange rate is 1.1910 €/£, Citibank's trader realizes that the implicit cross exchange rate is 1.1971 €/£ (by calculating 1.4650 × 0.8171 = 1.1971), meaning that Crédit Agricole has narrowed its bid-ask spread to serve as a market maker between the euro and the pound. Although the market suggests the implicit cross exchange rate should be 1.1971 euros per pound, Crédit Agricole is selling pounds at a lower price of 1.1910 euros. Citibank's trader can hastily exercise triangular arbitrage by exchanging dollars for euros with Deutsche Bank, then exchanging euros for pounds with Crédit Agricole, and finally exchanging pounds for dollars with Barclays. The following steps illustrate the triangular arbitrage transaction.&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011" /&gt;

#Citibank sells $5,000,000 to Deutsche Bank for euros, receiving €4,085,500. ($5,000,000 × 0.8171 €/$ = €4,085,500)
#Citibank sells €4,085,500 to Crédit Agricole for pounds, receiving £3,430,311. (€4,085,500 ÷ 1.1910 €/£ = £3,430,311)
#Citibank sells £3,430,311 to Barclays for dollars, receiving $5,025,406. (£3,430,311 × 1.4650 $/£ = $5,025,406)
#Citibank ultimately earns an arbitrage profit of $25,406 on the $5,000,000 of capital it used to execute the strategy.

The reason for dividing the euro amount by the euro/pound exchange rate in this example is that the exchange rate is quoted in euro terms, as is the amount being traded. One could multiply the euro amount by the reciprocal pound/euro exchange rate and still calculate the ending amount of pounds.

==Evidence for triangular arbitrage==
Research examining high-frequency exchange rate data has found that [[mispricing]]s do occur in the foreign exchange market such that executable triangular arbitrage opportunities appear possible.&lt;ref name="Fenn et al. 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = The Mirage of Triangular Arbitrage in the Spot Foreign Exchange Market | journal = International Journal of Theoretical and Applied Finance | volume = 12 | issue = 8 | year = 2009 | pages = 1105–1123 | author = Fenn, Daniel J. | author2 = Howison, Sam D. | author3 = McDonald, Mark | author4 = Williams, Stacy | author5 = Johnson, Neil F. | url = http://www.worldscinet.com/ijtaf/12/1208/S0219024909005609.html | accessdate = 2011-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In observations of triangular arbitrage, the constituent exchange rates have exhibited strong [[correlation]].&lt;ref name="Aiba et al. 2002" /&gt; A study examining exchange rate data provided by [[HSBC Bank (Europe)|HSBC Bank]] for the [[Japanese yen]] (JPY) and the [[Swiss franc]] (CHF) found that although a limited number of arbitrage opportunities appeared to exist for as many as 100 seconds, 95% of them lasted for 5 seconds or less, and 60% lasted for 1 second or less. Further, most arbitrage opportunities were found to have small magnitudes, with 94% of JPY and CHF opportunities existing at a difference of 1 [[basis point]], which translates into a potential arbitrage profit of $100 USD per $1 million USD transacted.&lt;ref name="Fenn et al. 2009" /&gt;

Tests for [[seasonality]] in the amount and duration of triangular arbitrage opportunities have shown that incidence of arbitrage opportunities and mean duration is consistent from day to day. However, significant variations have been identified during different times of day. Transactions involving the JPY and CHF have demonstrated a smaller number of opportunities and long average duration around 01:00 and 10:00 [[UTC]], contrasted with a greater number of opportunities and short average duration around 13:00 and 16:00 UTC. Such variations in incidence and duration of arbitrage opportunities can be explained by variations in [[market liquidity]] during the trading day. For example, the foreign exchange market is found to be most liquid for Asia around 00:00 and 10:00 UTC, for Europe around 07:00 and 17:00 UTC, and for America around 13:00 and 23:00 UTC. The overall foreign exchange market is most liquid around 08:00 and 16:00 UTC, and the least liquid around 22:00 and 01:00 UTC. The periods of highest liquidity correspond with the periods of greatest incidence of opportunities for triangular arbitrage. This correspondence is substantiated by the observation of narrower bid-ask spreads during periods of high liquidity, resulting in a greater potential for mispricings and therefore arbitrage opportunities. However, market forces are driven to correct for mispricings due to a high frequency of trades that will trade away fleeting arbitrage opportunities.&lt;ref name="Fenn et al. 2009" /&gt;

Researchers have shown a decrease in the incidence of triangular arbitrage opportunities from 2003 to 2005 for the Japanese yen and Swiss franc and have attributed the decrease to broader adoption of [[electronic trading platform]]s and [[algorithmic trading|trading algorithms]] during the same period. Such electronic systems have enabled traders to trade and react rapidly to price changes. The speed gained from these technologies improved trading efficiency and the correction of mispricings, allowing for less incidence of triangular arbitrage opportunities.&lt;ref name="Fenn et al. 2009" /&gt;

==Profitability==
Mere existence of triangular arbitrage opportunities does not necessarily imply that a trading strategy seeking to exploit currency mispricings is consistently profitable. [[Electronic trading]] systems allow the three constituent trades in a triangular arbitrage transaction to be submitted very rapidly. However, there exists a delay between the identification of such an opportunity, the initiation of trades, and the arrival of trades to the party quoting the mispricing. Even though such delays are only milliseconds in duration, they are deemed significant. For example, if a trader places each trade as a [[limit order]] to be filled only at the arbitrage price and a price moves due to market activity or new price is quoted by the third party, then the triangular transaction will not be completed. In such a case, the arbitrageur will face a cost to close out the position that is equal to the change in price that eliminated the arbitrage condition.&lt;ref name="Fenn et al. 2009" /&gt;

In the foreign exchange market there are many market participants competing for each arbitrage opportunity; for arbitrage to be profitable a trader would need to identify and execute each arbitrage opportunity faster than competitors. Competing arbitrageurs are expected to persist in striving to increase their execution speed of trades by engaging in what some researchers describe as an "electronic trading 'arms race'."&lt;ref name="Fenn et al. 2009" /&gt; The costs involved in keeping ahead in such a competition present difficulty in consistently beating other arbitrageurs over the long term. Other factors such as [[transaction costs]], [[brokerage]] fees, network access fees, and sophisticated electronic trading platforms further challenge the feasibility of significant arbitrage profits over prolonged periods.&lt;ref name="Fenn et al. 2009" /&gt;

'''TÜV NORD GROUP''' is a technical service provider with worldwide activities. Founded in 1869 and headquartered in [[Hanover]], [[Germany]], the Group employs more than 10,000 people in more than 70 countries of Europe, Asia, America and Africa. The Group is divided into the following operative brands and business units:

* TÜV NORD: Industrial Services, Mobility, Training, IT 
* DMT: Natural Resources
* ALTER TECHNOLOGY: Aerospace

TÜVs (German abbreviation: [[Technischer Überwachungsverein]], English: Technical Inspection Association) are German organizations that work to validate the safety of products and services of all kinds to protect humans, material assets and the environment against hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Members of the Association of TÜVs - VdTÜV|url=http://www.vdtuev.de/vdtuev/mitglieder|publisher=VdTÜV-Website|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524082823/http://www.vdtuev.de/vdtuev/mitglieder|archivedate=2012-05-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The story of TÜV NORD GROUP has its roots in the traditional boiler inspection associations founded by the industry, which in 1869 voluntarily undertook to begin monitoring and ensuring the operational safety of boilers. Gradually, the government gave the DÜV, later known as the TÜV (Technical Inspection Association) additional safety-related tasks, such as the regular inspection of automobiles, still a watchword for road safety in Germany today.

'''''Wheels'' Car of the Year''' (commonly abbreviated to COTY) is an annual automotive award presented by [[Wheels (magazine)|''Wheels'']] magazine. It is considered Australia's most prestigious automotive award, which the publisher contends, is the world's oldest continuous motoring award of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wheelsmag.com.au/car-of-the-year|title=Car of the Year|work=Wheels|accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caradvice.com.au/9704/c-class-is-2007-car-of-the-year/|title=C-Class is 2007 Wheels Car of the Year|work=Car Advice|date=22 January 2008|accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award is given to the best newly released vehicle each year.

==History==
Since 1963, ''Wheels'' has awarded the title of Car of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/hondas-cr-z-wins-wheels-car-of-the-year/news-story/1cd3763086f8cc14131f5b0029eaa49b|title=Honda's CR-Z wins Wheels Car of the Year|date=18 January 2012|work=AAP|publisher=News Corp Australia|accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its inaugural year, the French [[Renault 8]] became the inaugural COTY winner, which was built in many countries including Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shannons.com.au/club/news/renault-r8-the-first-wheels-car-of-the-year/|title=Renault R8: The First Wheels Car of the Year |first=Joe|last=Kenwright|work=Shannons|date=17 May 2013|accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original intention of COTY was to promote excellence in the Australian [[car manufacturing]] industry, dominated at the time by [[Ford]], [[Holden]], [[Chrysler]], [[Datsun]] and [[Toyota]]. With the fuel crisis in the 1970s, European makers also based in Australia, such as [[Renault]] and [[Volkswagen]], began closing their local assembly plants. With a shrinking local manufacturing base and reliability and quality issues that affected Australian-made cars, Wheels changed the basis of the award to include imported cars. At first, this was condemned by the local industry, unions and media, however, the approach permitted local products to be judged on a global basis. This, in turn, is claimed to have contributed towards a more competitive local industry and sees each winner heavily advertised as a COTY winner.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The award is given on an annual basis, except in 1972, 1979 and 1986 when, under the stewardship of the then-editor Peter Robinson, no newly released car in those years was considered worthy of the award. 

The withholding of the award in 1972 and 1979 twice coincided with the release of a new Ford Falcon (the [[Ford Falcon (XA)|XA]] and [[Ford Falcon (XD)|XD]] series). On the second occasion, as the Falcon (XD) was a sales success and leading candidate for the 1980 COTY award, the then deputy manager of [[Ford Australia]], Edsel Ford II, took out a 1-page advertisement in Wheels magazine, depicting the Falcon and other contenders as lemons and stating "There are times when being a lemon is not a bitter experience at all". This was both in answer to the award's withdrawal against the Falcon and Wheels' cover for March 1980, which was a four-wheeled lemon under the title "NO CAR OF THE YEAR".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = My tilt at the wheel | magazine = [[Wheels (magazine)|Wheels]] | page = 78 | date = May 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first imported car to win the award was the Japanese [[Honda Accord]] for 1977. In 1982, the award was shared for the first time between [[badge engineered]] cars and, in 1991, between completely different types of cars. Over the years, the COTY criteria has been further refined and, for 2004, it was amended to allow any [[Sport Utility Vehicle]] (SUV) to be eligible for the first time, permitting the Australian-made [[Ford Territory (Australia)|Ford Territory]] to take the title. For 2011, the [[Honda CR-Z]] instead became the first [[hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] to win the award.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Starting from 2015, the temporal basis of how the award is branded has been changed such that, the award now carries the year of when the winner was announced, instead of the preceding year when testing took place. Consequently, what would have been the 2015 COTY winner is instead be the winner for 2016 and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wheelsmag.com.au/features/1511/the-road-to-2016-wheels-car-of-the-year/ | title = The road to 2016 Wheels car of the Year | date = 20 November 2015 | accessdate = 1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
