'''''Aguirre, the Wrath of God''''' ({{lang-de|Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes}}), known in the UK as '''''Aguirre, Wrath of God''''', is a 1972 [[West Germany|West German]] [[Epic film|epic]] [[Historical period drama|historical]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by [[Werner Herzog]]. [[Klaus Kinski]] stars in the title role. The [[soundtrack]] was composed and performed by West German [[progressive rock|progressive]]/[[Krautrock]] band [[Popol Vuh (German band)|Popol Vuh]]. The story follows the travels of Spanish soldier [[Lope de Aguirre]], who leads a group of [[conquistador]]es down the [[Orinoco]] and [[Amazon River]] in South America in search of the legendary city of gold, [[El Dorado (legend)|El Dorado]].

Using a [[minimalism|minimalist]] approach to the story and dialogue, the film creates a vision of madness and folly, counterpointed by the lush but unforgiving Amazonian jungle. Although loosely based on what is known of the historical figure of Aguirre, Herzog acknowledged years after the film's release that its storyline is a work of fiction. Some of the people and situations may have been inspired by [[Gaspar de Carvajal]]'s account of an earlier Amazonian expedition, although Carvajal was not on the historical voyage represented in the film. Other accounts state that the expedition went into the jungles but never returned to civilization.

''Aguirre'' was the first of five collaborations between Herzog and the volatile Kinski. The director and the actor had differing views as to how the role should be played, and they clashed throughout filming; Kinski's tantrums terrorized both the crew and the local natives who were assisting the production. Shooting was entirely on location, and was fraught with difficulties. Filming took place in the [[Peru]]vian [[rainforest]] on the Amazon River during an arduous five-week period, shooting on [[tributary|tributaries]] of the [[Ucayali region]]. The cast and crew climbed mountains, cut through heavy vines to open routes to the various jungle locations, and rode treacherous river rapids on rafts built by natives.

''Aguirre'' opened to widespread critical acclaim, and quickly developed a large international [[cult film]] following. It was given an extensive [[art film|arthouse]] theatrical release in the United States in 1977, and remains one of the [[film director|director's]] best-known films. Several critics have declared the film a masterpiece, and it has appeared on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's list of "All Time 100 Best Films".  ''Aguirre'''s visual style and narrative elements had a strong influence on [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s 1979 film ''[[Apocalypse Now]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.geraldpeary.com/interviews/abc/coppola.html | last=Peary | first=Gerald | title=Francis Ford Coppola, Interview with Gerald Peary | publisher=Gerald Peary | accessdate=March 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In 1560, several score of [[Spaniards|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s, and a hundred [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] slaves, march down from the newly conquered [[Inca Empire]] in the [[Andes]] mountains into the jungles to the east, in search of the fabled country of El Dorado. Under the command of [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] (Alejandro Repullés), the men, clad in half [[personal armor|armor]], pull cannons down narrow mountainous paths and through dense, muddy jungle. On [[New Year's Eve]], reaching the end of his supplies and unable to go on without more information, Pizarro orders a group of forty men to scout ahead by raft down river. If they do not return to the main party within one week with news of what lies beyond, they will be considered lost. Pizarro chooses Don [[Pedro de Ursúa]] ([[Ruy Guerra]]) as the commander of the expedition, Don Lope de Aguirre (Klaus Kinski) as his [[second-in-command]], fat nobleman Don Fernando de Guzmán ([[Peter Berling]]) representing [[Spanish Royal Family|The Royal House of Spain]] and Brother Gaspar de Carvajal ([[Del Negro (actor)|Del Negro]]) to bring the word of God. Also accompanying the expedition, against Pizarro's better judgment, are Ursúa's mistress, Doña Inés ([[Helena Rojo]]) and Aguirre's teenage daughter, Florés (Cecilia Rivera, in her only film role).

Traveling through rapids, one of the four rafts gets caught in an [[Whitewater#Eddies|eddy]], and the others are unable to help free it. That night, gunfire erupts on the trapped raft; in the morning the men on board are found dead, with two missing. Ursúa wants the bodies to be brought back to camp for proper burial. Knowing this would slow down the expedition, Aguirre hints to Perucho (Daniel Ades) to "keep the rust off the cannon". Perucho proceeds to fire the cannon at the raft, destroying it and throwing the bodies into the river.

During the night, the remaining rafts are swept away by the rising river. Time has run out for the scouting mission, and Ursúa decides to return to Pizarro's group. Aguirre leads a [[mutiny]] against Ursúa, telling the men that untold riches await them ahead, and reminding them that [[Hernan Cortez]] won an empire in [[Mexico]] by disobeying orders. Ursúa attempts to put Aguirre in chains, but he and a soldier loyal to him are shot. Inés cares for Ursúa. Aguirre coerces the soldiers to elect the fat, lazy Don de Guzmán as the new leader of the expedition. Aguirre proclaims de Guzmán emperor of the new country and declares [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] dethroned. A farcical trial of Ursúa results in his being sentenced to death, but de Guzmán surprises Aguirre by granting Ursúa clemency.

Aguirre proves to be an oppressive leader, so terrifying that few protest his leadership. Only Inés has the courage to speak out against him. Knowing that some of the soldiers are still loyal to Ursúa, Aguirre simply ignores her.

The expedition continues on a single, newly built, large raft. An Indian couple approaching peacefully by canoe are captured by the explorers, and when the man expresses confusion when presented with a Bible, Brother Carvajal kills them for [[blasphemy]]. De Guzmán dines on the low food supplies while the men starve, and has the expedition's only remaining horse pushed off the raft because it annoys him. Soon afterwards he is found strangled near the raft's [[outhouse]]. After de Guzmán's death, Aguirre proclaims himself leader. Ursúa is then taken ashore and hanged in the jungle. The group attacks an Indian village, where several soldiers are killed by spears and arrows. The distraught Inés walks into the jungle and disappears.

On the raft again, the group of slowly starving, feverish men begin disbelieving everything they see, even when shot with arrows. The group stares in disbelief at a [[sailing ship|wooden ship]] perched in the highest branches of a tall tree, which Aguirre orders be brought down and refurbished, but Brother Carvajal refuses. In a series of final attacks by unseen assailants, the remaining survivors including Aguirre's daughter are killed by arrows. Aguirre alone remains alive on the slowly drifting raft. The raft becomes overrun by monkeys. The crazed Aguirre tells them: "I, the Wrath of God, will marry my own daughter, and with her I will found the purest dynasty the world has ever seen. Together, we shall rule this entire continent. We shall endure. I am the Wrath of God... who else is with me?" The final shot is of him waiting for the monkeys to respond.

==Production==
The idea for the film began when Herzog borrowed a book on historical adventurers from a friend. After reading a half-page devoted to Lope de Aguirre, the filmmaker became inspired and immediately devised the story. He fabricated most of the plot details and characters, although he did use some historical figures in purely fictitious ways.&lt;ref name="Herzog"&gt;Herzog, Werner. ''Aguirre, the Wrath of God'' [[DVD]], [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]], 2001, [[audio commentary]]. {{OCLC|228418112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Screenplay===
Herzog wrote the screenplay "in a frenzy", and completed it in two-and-a-half days. Much of the script was written during a {{convert|200|mi|km|adj=on}} bus trip with Herzog's football team. His teammates got drunk after winning a game and one of them vomited on several pages of Herzog's manuscript, which he immediately threw out the window. Herzog claims he cannot remember all of the things that he wrote on these pages.&lt;ref name="Herzog" /&gt;

The screenplay was shot as written, with some minor differences. In an early scene in which Pizarro instructs Ursúa to lead the scouting team down the river, in the script Pizarro mentions that in the course of the expedition Ursúa could possibly discover what happened to [[Francisco de Orellana]]'s expedition, which had vanished without a trace years before (see "Historical Accuracy" section). Later in the screenplay, Aguirre and his men find a boat and the long-dead remains of Orellana's soldiers. Further down the river, they discover another ship lodged in some tree tops. In the screenplay, Aguirre and others explore the boat but find no sign of Orellana or his men. Herzog ultimately eliminated any such references to Orellana's expedition from the film. The sequence with the boat caught in the upper branches of a tree remains, but as filmed it seems to be simply a hallucinatory vision.&lt;ref name="Fritze"&gt;Fritze, Ronald. "Werner Herzog's Adaptation of History in Aguirre, The Wrath of God", from ''Film and History'', Issue 15:4, pgs. 74-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The finale is significantly different from Herzog's original script. The director recalled, "I only remember that the end of the film was totally different. The end was actually the raft going out into the open ocean and being swept back inland, because for many miles you have a counter-current, the Amazon actually goes backwards. And it was tossed to and fro. And a parrot would scream: "El Dorado, El Dorado"..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horschamp.qc.ca/new_offscreen/werner_herzog.html|title=The Trail of Werner Herzog:  An Interview|accessdate=2007-05-08|first=Werner|last=Herzog|publisher=Off Screen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Herzog and Kinski===
Herzog's first choice for the role of Aguirre was actor Klaus Kinski. The two had met many years earlier when the then-struggling young actor rented a room in Herzog's family apartment, and Kinski's often terrifying and deranged antics during the three months he lived there left a lasting impression on the director. Years later, Herzog remembered the volatile actor and knew that he was the only possible man who could play the mad Aguirre, and he sent Kinski a copy of the screenplay. "Between three and four in the morning, the phone rang", Herzog recalled. "It took me at least a couple of minutes before I realized that it was Kinski who was the source of this inarticulate screaming. And after an hour of this, it dawned on me that he found it the most fascinating screenplay and wanted to be Aguirre."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,676082,00.html|title=The Enigma of Werner H|accessdate=&lt;!----2007-08-22----&gt;|date=20 March 2002|first=John|last=O'Mahony|work=The Guardian |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning of the production, Herzog and Kinski argued about the proper manner to portray Aguirre. Kinski wanted to play a "wild, ranting madman", but Herzog wanted something "quieter, more menacing". In order to get the performance he desired, before each shot Herzog would deliberately infuriate Kinski. After waiting for the hot-tempered actor's anger to "burn itself out", Herzog would then roll the camera.&lt;ref name="Knipfel"&gt;[[Jim Knipfel|Knipfel, Jim]]. ''Aguirre, the Wrath of God'' DVD, Anchor Bay Entertainment, 2001, [[liner notes]].&lt;/ref&gt;

On one occasion, irritated by the noise from a hut where cast and crew were playing cards, the explosive Kinski fired three [[gunshots]] at it, blowing the tip off one extra's finger.&lt;ref name="Herzog" /&gt; Subsequently, Kinski started leaving the jungle location (over Herzog's refusal to fire a sound assistant), only changing his mind after Herzog threatened to shoot first Kinski and then himself. The latter incident has given rise to the legend that Herzog made Kinski act for him at gunpoint. However, Herzog has repeatedly denied the claim during interviews, saying he only verbally threatened Kinski in the heat of the moment, in a desperate attempt to keep him from leaving the set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://weeklywire.com/ww/04-27-98/slc_ae.html |date=April 27, 1998|title=Hauntingly Herzog |accessdate=&lt;!----2007-05-08----&gt; |first=Mary|last=Dickson |work=City Weekly |location=Salt Lake City}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident is parodied in ''[[Incident at Loch Ness]]'', which Herzog co-wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=March 21, 2009|url=http://moria.co.nz/sciencefiction/incidentatlochness.htm|title=Incident at Loch Ness|accessdate=September 7, 2009|first=Richard|last=Scheib|work=Moria, The Science Fiction, Horror and Fantasy Film Review|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312051754/http://moria.co.nz/sciencefiction/incidentatlochness.htm|archivedate=12 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
The film was made for [[United States dollar|US$]]370,000, with one-third of the budget paying for Kinski's salary.&lt;ref name="Herzog1"&gt;Herzog, Werner. ''Herzog on Herzog'', edited by Paul Cronin, Faber &amp; Faber, 2003. {{ISBN|0-571-20708-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was filmed on location in the [[Peru]]vian [[rainforest]], [[Machu Picchu]] (the stone steps of [[Huayna Picchu]]),&lt;ref name="Herzog1" /&gt; and on the [[Amazon River]] [[tributary|tributaries]] of the [[Ucayali region]]. ''Aguirre'' was shot in five weeks, following nine months' worth of pre-production planning.&lt;ref name="Herzog" /&gt; The film was shot in chronological order, because Herzog believed the film crew's progress on the river directly mirrored that of the explorers' journey in the story. The director and his cast and crew floated in rafts down the [[Huallaga River|Huallaga]] and [[Nanay]] rivers through the [[Urubamba Valley]] in Peru.&lt;ref name="Herzog1" /&gt;

All of the actors spoke their dialogue in English. The members of the cast and crew came from sixteen different countries, and English was the only common language among them. In addition, Herzog felt that shooting ''Aguirre'' in English would improve the film's chances for international distribution. However, the small amount of money that had been set aside for post-synchronization "left Peru with the man in charge of the process; both absconded ''en route''."  The English-language track was ultimately replaced by a higher-quality [[German language]] version, which was [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|post-synched]] after production was completed.&lt;ref name="Overbey" /&gt; Herzog claims that Kinski requested too much money for the dubbing session, and so his lines were performed by another actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050828/PEOPLE/50828001|title=A conversation with Werner Herzog|accessdate=19 June 2007 |first=Werner|last=Herzog|publisher=www.rogerebert.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[low budget]] precluded the use of stunt men or elaborate [[special effects]]. The cast and crew climbed up mountains, hacked through thick jungle, and rode ferocious Amazonian river rapids on rafts built by natives. At one point, a storm caused a river to flood, covering the film sets in several feet of water and destroying all the rafts built for the film. This flooding was immediately incorporated into the story, as a sequence including a flood and subsequent rebuilding of rafts was shot.&lt;ref name="Herzog" /&gt;

The camera used to shoot the film was stolen by Herzog from the Munich Film School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.harpers.org/archive/2006/12/0081313
| title=The Secret Mainstream: Contemplating the mirages of Werner Herzog|date = December 2006|accessdate=&lt;!----2007-05-08----&gt; |first=Tom|last=Bissell|work=[[Harper's Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Herzog recalled:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was a very simple [[35mm]] camera, one I used on many other films, so I do not consider it a theft. For me, it was truly a necessity. I wanted to make films and needed a camera. I had some sort of natural right to this tool. If you need air to breathe, and you are locked in a room, you have to take a chisel and hammer and break down a wall. It is your absolute right.&lt;ref name="Herzog1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To obtain the monkeys used in the climactic sequence, Herzog paid several locals to trap 400 monkeys; he paid them half in advance and was to pay the other half upon receipt. The trappers sold the monkeys to someone in Los Angeles or Miami, and Herzog came to the airport just as the monkeys were being loaded to be shipped out of the country. He pretended to be a veterinarian and claimed that the monkeys needed vaccinations before leaving the country. Abashed, the handlers unloaded the monkeys, and Herzog loaded them into his jeep and drove away, used them in the shot they were required for, and released them afterwards into the jungle.&lt;ref name="Herzog" /&gt;

===Music===
{{main|Aguirre (soundtrack)}}
''Aguirre'''s [[film score|musical score]] was performed by [[Popol Vuh (German band)|Popol Vuh]], a West German [[progressive rock|progressive]]/[[Krautrock]] band. The band was formed in 1970 by keyboardist Florian Fricke, who had known Herzog for several years prior to the formation of the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurock.com/features/florian.aspx |title=Florian Fricke Interview|accessdate=2007-10-30|first=Gerhard|last=Augustin|publisher=Eurock| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071015223326/http://eurock.com/features/florian.aspx| archivedate= 15 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He had appeared as an actor in the director's first full-length film, ''[[Signs of Life (1968 film)|Signs of Life]]'' (1968), playing a pianist. ''Aguirre'' was only the first of many collaborations between the band and the director.

Popol Vuh's "hypnotic music"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/film_review.asp?ID=2561 |title=Aguirre: The Wrath of God |accessdate=2007-10-30 |first=Nick |last=Schager |publisher=Slant Magazine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213085318/http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/film_review.asp?ID=2561 |archivedate=13 December 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; for ''Aguirre'' met with considerable acclaim.  Roger Ebert wrote, "The music sets the tone. It is haunting, ecclesiastical, human and yet something else... [T]he music is crucial to ''Aguirre, the Wrath of God''..."&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19990404/REVIEWS08/904040301/1023 |title=Aguirre, the Wrath of God (1972) |accessdate=2007-10-30 |first=Roger |last=Ebert |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011154923/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19990404%2FREVIEWS08%2F904040301%2F1023 |archivedate=11 October 2007 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AllMusic]] noted, "The film's central [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] blends pulsing [[Moog synthesizer|Moog]] and spectral voices conjured from Florian Fricke's Mellotron-related "choir organ" to achieve something sublime, in the truest sense of the word: it's hard not to find the music's awe-inspiring, overwhelming beauty simultaneously unsettling. The power of the legendary opening sequence of Herzog's film...owes as much to Popol Vuh's music as it does to the director's [[Mise en scène|mise-en-scène]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r108141|pure_url=yes}} |title=Aguirre Review|accessdate=2007-10-30|first=Neate|last=Wilson|publisher=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herzog explained how the choir-like sound was created, "We used a strange instrument, which we called a '[[Mellotron|choir-organ]].' It has inside it three dozen different tapes running parallel to each other in loops. ... All these tapes are running at the same time, and there is a keyboard on which you can play them like an organ so that [it will] sound just like a human choir but yet, at the same time, very artificial and really quite eerie."&lt;ref name="Ebert" /&gt;

In 1975 Popol Vuh released an album entitled [[Aguirre (soundtrack)|''Aguirre'']]. Although ostensibly a [[soundtrack album]] to Herzog's film, the six-track [[LP album|LP]] included only two songs ("Aguirre I (L'Acrime Di Rei)" and "Aguirre II") taken from ''Aguirre, the Wrath of God''. The four remaining tracks were derived from various recordings made by the group between about 1972 and 1974. At the time of ''Aguirre'' the band members were Fricke ([[piano]], [[Mellotron]]), Fichelscher ([[electric guitar]], [[Steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitar]], [[Drum kit|drums]]), Djong Yun ([[singing|vocals]]), and Robert Eliscu ([[oboe]], [[Pan flute|pan pipe]]).

==Reception==

===Critical response===
The film was produced in part by West German television station ''[[Hessischer Rundfunk]]'', which televised the film on the same day it opened in theatres. Herzog has blamed this for the relatively poor commercial reception of the film in Germany.&lt;ref name="Herzog1" /&gt; However, outside Germany the film became an "enormous [[cult film|cult]] favorite" in "such places as Mexico, Venezuela, and Algiers."&lt;ref name="Peary"&gt;[[Danny Peary|Peary, Danny]]. ''[[Cult Movies (book)|Cult Movies]]'', Delta Books, 1981. {{ISBN|0-517-20185-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film had a theatrical run of fifteen months in Paris.&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;Young, Vernon. "Much Madness: Werner Herzog and Contemporary German Cinema", in ''[[The Hudson Review]]'', Vol. 30, No. 3 (August 1977), pp. 409-414.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aguirre'' received a theatrical release in the United States in 1977 by [[New Yorker Films]]. It immediately became a cult film, and New Yorker Films reported four years after its initial release that it was the only film in its catalog that never went out of circulation.&lt;ref name="Peary"/&gt;

In Germany, the ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' described the film as "a colour-drenched, violently physical moving painting".&lt;ref name=Baumgardt&gt;{{cite web | author=Baumgardt, Carsten| year=| work=FilmStarts| url=http://www.filmstarts.de/kritiken/37028-Aguirre-Der-Zorn-Gottes.html|title=Aguirre - Der Zorn Gottes (German language)| accessdate = 2009-03-24| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090228195344/http://www.filmstarts.de/kritiken/37028-Aguirre-Der-Zorn-Gottes.html| archivedate= 28 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' described Kinski's acting as "too theatrical" to embody God's wrath.&lt;ref name="Baumgardt" /&gt;

In the US and the UK the film received mostly positive critical notices upon release. [[Vincent Canby]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', called it "[A]bsolutely stunning&amp;nbsp;... Mr. Herzog views all the proceedings with fixed detachment. He remains cool. He takes no sides. He may even be slightly amused. Mainly he is a poet who constantly surprises us with unexpected juxtapositions ... This is a splendid and haunting work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF1739E762BC4C53DFB266838C669EDE |title= 'Aguirre, the Wrath of God' Haunting Film by Herzog, |accessdate=&lt;!----2008-06-14----&gt; |first=Vincent|last=Canby|work = The New York Times | date=April 4, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', [[Richard Schickel]] opined that "[Herzog] does the audience the honor of allowing it to discover the blindnesses and obsessions, the sober lunacies he quietly lays out on the screen. Well acted, most notably by Klaus Kinski in the title role, gloriously photographed by Thomas Mauch, ''Aguirre'' is, not to put too fine a point on it, a movie that makes a convincing claim to greatness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date=May 16, 1977 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918983,00.html?internalid=atm100 |title=Meditation on Madness|accessdate=&lt;!----2007-03-14----&gt; |first=Richard|last=Schickel|work =Time |location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time Out (company)|''Time Out's'']] [[Tony Rayns]] noted, "...each scene and each detail is honed down to its salient features. On this level, the film effectively pre-empts analysis by analysing itself as it proceeds, admitting no ambiguity. Yet at the same time, Herzog's flair for charged explosive imagery has never had freer rein, and the film is rich in [[oneiric (film theory)|oneiric moments]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/77613/aguirre-wrath-of-god.html|title=Aguirre, Wrath of God|accessdate=2007-03-14|first=Tony|last=Rayns|work =Time Out Film guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
The film's reputation through the years has continued to grow. [[J. Hoberman]] has written that ''Aguirre'' "is not just a great movie but an essential one ...

===Influence===
[[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s 1979 film ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', a film based on [[Joseph Conrad]]'s 1902 [[novella]] ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', was influenced also by ''Aguirre'', as it contains seemingly deliberate visual "quotations" of Herzog's film.&lt;ref name="Rubin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/webspaces/siskelfilmcenter/2007/february/2.html |last=Rubin |first=Martin |title=Werner Herzog: Visionary at Large |publisher=[[Gene Siskel]] Film Center |accessdate=2007-03-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224165959/http://www.artic.edu/webspaces/siskelfilmcenter/2007/february/2.html |archivedate=24 February 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=100264 |last=|first=|title=Aguirre, the Wrath of God|publisher=[[Channel 4]] Film|accessdate=2007-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davidsterritt.com/coppola.html|last=Sterritt|first=David|title=Coppola, 'Apocalypse Now,' and the Ambivalent 70's|publisher=DavidSterritt.com|accessdate=2007-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coppola himself has noted, "''Aguirre'', with its incredible imagery, was a very strong influence.

Several critics have noted that ''Aguirre'' appears to have had a direct influence on several other films.  Martin Rubin has written that "[a]mong the films strongly influenced by ''Aguirre'' are Coppola's ''Apocalypse Now'' and [[Terrence Malick]]'s ''[[The New World (2005 film)|The New World]]'' (2005)".&lt;ref name="Rubin" /&gt;  J. Hoberman agreed, noting that Herzog's "[[sui generis]] Amazon fever dream" was "the influence Malick's over-inflated ''New World'' can't shake."&lt;ref name="Hoberman" /&gt; [[Channel 4]] opined "This is an astonishing, deceptively simple, pocket-sized epic whose influence, in terms of both style and narrative, is seen in films as diverse as ''Apocalypse Now'', ''[[The Mission (1986 film)|The Mission]]'', ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'', and ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' (1999)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=100142|title=Aguirre The Wrath of God |accessdate=13 August 2007|publisher=www.channel4.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070806132003/http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=100142| archivedate= 6 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical accuracy==
Although plot details and many of the characters in ''Aguirre'' come directly from Herzog's own imagination,  historians have pointed out that the film fairly accurately incorporates some 16th-century events and historical personages into a fictional narrative. 
Herzog's screenplay merged two different expeditions: one led by [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] in 1541, which resulted in the discovery of the [[Amazon river]] by [[Francisco de Orellana]], and another one that occurred in 1560.
The expedition of [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] and his men left from the city of [[Quito]] and entered the Amazon basin in search of El Dorado. Various troubles afflicted the expedition and, sure that El Dorado was very close, Pizarro set up a smaller group led by [[Francisco de Orellana]] to break off from the main group and forge ahead, then return with news of what they had found. This group utilized a [[brigantine]] to journey down the river. 
After failing to find the legendary city, Orellana was unable to return because of the current, and he and his men continued to follow the [[Napo River]] until he reached the [[estuary]] of the Amazon in 1542.
Accompanying Orellana was [[Gaspar de Carvajal]], who kept a journal of the group's experiences.
The historic Gaspar de Carvajal (1500–1584) was a Spanish Dominican friar who had settled in Peru and dedicated himself to the conversion of the Indians. His general attitude towards the Indians was consistent with the benevolence of his better-known brother Dominican friar, Bartolomé de las Casas.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} This personality is at odds with the description in the film where Carvajal is portrayed as a cowardly priest who claimed that "the church was always on the side of the strong."{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} &lt;ref name="Fritze" /&gt;  
The film's major characters, Aguirre, Ursúa, Don Fernando, Inez and Florés, were involved in the second expedition, which left Peru in 1560 to find the city of El Dorado. Commissioned by Peru's governor, Ursúa organized an expeditionary group of 300 men to travel by way of the Amazon River. He was accompanied by his [[Mestizo|mixed-race]] mistress, Doña Inez. At one point during the journey, Aguirre, a professional soldier, decided that he could use the 300 men to overthrow the Spanish rule of Peru. Aguirre had Ursúa murdered and proclaimed Fernando as "The Prince of Peru". Fernando himself was eventually murdered when he questioned Aguirre's scheme of sailing to the Atlantic, conquering Panama, crossing the isthmus and invading Peru.  Many others who attempted to rebel against Aguirre were also killed. The surviving soldiers conquered [[Isla Margarita]] off the coast of [[Venezuela]] and made preparations to attack the mainland. However, by that time Spanish authorities had learned of Aguirre's plans, and when the rebels arrived in Venezuela, government agents offered full pardons to Aguirre's men. All of them accepted the deal. Immediately prior to his arrest, Aguirre murdered his daughter Florés, who had remained by his side during the entire journey. He was then captured and dismembered.&lt;ref name="Waller"&gt;Waller, Gregory. "Aguirre, The Wrath of God:  History, Theater, and the Camera", from ''[[South Atlantic Review]]'' 46.2 (1981), pgs. 55 – 69.&lt;/ref&gt;
Other Spanish expeditions outside the Amazon influenced the story; the conversation in which the Indians refuse a Bible comes from events before the [[Battle of Cajamarca]], in which Inca emperor [[Atahualpa]] allegedly rejected the [[Requerimiento]]. The chronicle of [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]], ''La Relación'' ("''The Account''"), mentions the appearance of a boat in a treetop after a fierce tropical storm in [[Hispaniola]]:

{{quote|Monday morning we went down to the port and did not find the ships. We saw their buoys in the water, from which we realized that they had been lost, and we went along the coast to see if we could find signs of them. Since we found nothing, we went into the woods, and a quarter of a league into them we found one of the ship's boats in some trees.|Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca.&lt;ref&gt;Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca 'The Account and Commentaries of Governor Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca'', [http://alkek.library.txstate.edu/swwc/cdv/book/7.html Chapter One]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Kinski's crazed performance bore similarities to the real Aguirre, a "true homicidal megalomaniac". Many of his fellow soldiers considered his actions to be that of a madman.&lt;ref name="Fritze" /&gt;  Kinski's use of a limp reflected one that Aguirre had, the result of a battle injury. Aguirre's frequent short but impassioned speeches to his men in the film were accurately based on the man's noted "simple but effective rhetorical ability."&lt;ref name="Waller"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12229">[[Image:Schopenhauer.jpg|thumb|Schopenhauer claimed that art provides knowledge of eternal Platonic Ideas and also results in temporary relief from the pressures of willing.]]
'''Arthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics''' result from his doctrine of the primacy of the [[Will (philosophy)|Will]] as the ''[[thing in itself]]'', the ground of life and all being; and from his judgment that individuation of the Will is [[evil]].  [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] held that [[art]] offers a way for people to temporarily escape the suffering that results from willing.&lt;ref&gt;"…aesthetic pleasure in the beautiful consists, to a large extent, in the fact that, when
we enter the state of pure contemplation, we are raised for the moment above all willing, above all desires and cares; we are, so to speak, rid of ourselves." (Schopenhauer, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', vol. I, § 68, Dover page 390)
&lt;/ref&gt; Basing his doctrine on the dual aspect of the world as will and the world as representation, he taught that if [[consciousness]] or attention is fully engrossed, absorbed, or occupied with the world as painless representations or images, then there is no consciousness of the world as painful willing. Aesthetic pleasure results from being a spectator of "the world as representation" [mental image or idea] without any experience of "the world as will" [need, craving, urge].&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer's Account of Aesthetic Experience. TJ Diffey - ''The British Journal of Aesthetics'', 1990 - Br Soc Aesthetics&lt;/ref&gt; Art, according to Schopenhauer, also provides essential knowledge of the world’s objects in a way that is more profound than science or everyday experience.&lt;ref&gt;"[A]esthetics is at the heart of philosophy for Schopenhauer: art and aesthetic experience not only provide escape from an otherwise miserable existence, but attain an objectivity explicitly superior to that of science or ordinary empirical knowledge." "Knowledge and Tranquility: Schopenhauer on the Value of Art," [[Christopher Janaway]], in Dale Jacquette (ed.), ''Schopenhauer, Philosophy and the Arts'', ch. 2, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==An extension of his philosophy==
For Schopenhauer, the Will is an aimless desire to perpetuate itself, the basis of [[life]].  Desire engendered by the Will is the source of all the sorrow in the world; each satisfied desire leaves us either with boredom, or with some new desire to take its place.  A world in thrall to Will is necessarily a world of suffering.  Since the Will is the source of life, and our very bodies are stamped with its image and designed to serve its purpose, the human intellect is, in Schopenhauer's [[simile]], like a lame man who can see, but who rides on the shoulders of a blind giant.

Schopenhauer's [[aesthetics]] is an attempt to break out of the [[pessimism]] that naturally comes from this world view.  Schopenhauer believed that what distinguished ''aesthetic experiences'' from other experiences is that contemplation of the object of aesthetic appreciation temporarily allowed the subject a respite from the strife of desire, and allowed the subject to enter a realm of purely mental enjoyment, the world purely as representation or mental image.  The more a person's mind is concerned with the world as representation, the less it feels the suffering of the world as will.&lt;ref&gt;"Schopenhauer&amp;hellip;regards art as the only means of temporarily escaping the fundamentally futile nature of reality. Art’s essential role is&amp;hellip;to enable us to escape what we already intuitively know about the irredeemable nature of what we are." ([[Andrew Bowie]], ''Aesthetics and subjectivity: from Kant to Nietzsche'', Chapter 8, "Nietzsche and the fate of Romantic thought," "Schopenhauer: music as metaphysics," Manchester University Press, 2003, Page 262.)&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer analysed [[art]] from its effects, both on the personality of the artist, and the personality of the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan Magee|Magee, Bryan]], ''The Philosophy of Schopenhauer'' (Oxford University Press, revised edition, 1977) {{ISBN|0-19-823722-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Schopenhauerian artistic genius==
Schopenhauer believed that while all people were in thrall to the Will, the quality and intensity of their subjection differed:

:Only through the pure contemplation . . . which becomes absorbed entirely in the object, are the Ideas comprehended; and the nature of ''genius'' consists precisely in the preëminent ability for such contemplation. . . . (T)his demands a complete forgetting of our own person.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' (v. 1. ss. 185)&lt;/ref&gt;

The aesthetic experience temporarily emancipates the subject from the Will's domination and raises them to a level of pure perception.  "On the occurrence of an aesthetic appreciation, the will thereby vanishes entirely from consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'' 2:415&lt;/ref&gt;  Genuine art cannot be created by anyone who merely follows standard artistic rules. A genius is required, that is, a person who creates original art without concern for rules. The personality of the artist was also supposed to be less subject to Will than most: such a person was a Schopenhauerian [[genius]], a person whose exceptional predominance of intellect over Will made them relatively aloof from earthly cares and concerns.  The [[poetry|poet]] living in a [[garret]], the [[absent-minded professor]], [[Vincent van Gogh]] struggling with madness, are all (at least in the popular mind) examples of Schopenhauer's geniuses: so fixed on their art that they neglect the "business of life" that in Schopenhauer's mind meant only the domination of the evil and painful Will.  For Schopenhauer, the relative lack of competence of the artist and the thinker for practical pursuits was no mere [[stereotype]]: it was cause and effect.

Schopenhauer believed that what gives arts such as [[literature]] and [[sculpture]] their value was the extent to which they incorporated pure perceptions.  But, being concerned with human forms (at least in Schopenhauer's day) and human emotions, these art forms were inferior to [[music]], which being a direct manifestation of will, was to Schopenhauer's mind the highest form of art.  Schopenhauer's philosophy of music was influential in the works of [[Richard Wagner]].  Wagner was an enthusiastic reader of Schopenhauer, and recommended the reading of Schopenhauer to his friends.  His published works on [[music theory]] changed over time, and became more aligned with Schopenhauer's thought, over the course of his life. Schopenhauer had stated that music was more important than [[libretto]] in opera. Music is, according to Schopenhauer, an immediate expression of will, the basic reality of the experienced world. Libretto is merely a linguistic representation of transient phenomena. Wagner emphasized music over libretto in his later works after reading Schopenhauer's aesthetic doctrine.

==Influence==
In proposing that art could offer deliverance from the Will, Schopenhauer elevated art from mere [[artisan]]ry or [[Decorative arts|decoration]], and held that art potentially offered temporary deliverance from the aimless strife of the Will in nature.  In effect, Schopenhauer turned art into a substitute religion by offering a doctrine of [[salvation]] through aesthetic experiences.  Artists were not merely skilled hands; they were [[priest]]s or [[prophet]]s of this doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, [[Will Durant]], ''[[The Story of Philosophy]]'', sub. tit. "Arthur Schopenhauer".&lt;/ref&gt;  This teaching goes far to explain Schopenhauer's appeal to members of the creative communities over the second half of the nineteenth century. His doctrine of aesthetics justified artistic work as a matter of highest importance in human society.

Schopenhauer's aesthetics remain influential today, and are perhaps the most lasting part of his [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;''The aesthetic theories of Kant, Hegel, and Schopenhauer''
I Knox - 1958 - Thames &amp; Hudson&lt;/ref&gt;  Their appeal to later generations of [[romanticism|Romantics]], and to all schools of [[bohemianism]], is demonstrated.  Wagner sent Schopenhauer a note expressing deep gratitude for Schopenhauer's discussion of music.  Schopenhauer's philosophy in general left a deep impression on a number of important writers, especially [[Thomas Hardy]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], [[Thomas Mann]], and [[Ivan Turgenev]].&lt;ref name="Magee 1977"&gt;Magee (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer's aesthetics were directly responsible for the rise of the [[symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] and their allied movements, and to the general development of the concept of [[art for art's sake]].  It deeply influenced the aesthetics of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], although he ultimately rejected Schopenhauer's conception of Will as evil, whose famous opposition of the [[Apollonian and Dionysian]] is a translation of Schopenhauer's opposition of intellect against will in terms of [[Greek mythology]].  When the [[Marxism|Marxist]] critique of [[capitalism]] was stirred into the aesthetic stew, Schopenhauer's essentially [[asceticism|ascetic]] view of the purpose of art laid the foundation for the opposition of [[kitsch]] versus the [[avant-garde]] which is found in such critics as [[Clement Greenberg]].  Contemporary beliefs that artistic creation should not be swayed by financial gains or the demands of patrons or customers, and the belief that the greatest artists are those who create new and entirely unprecedented forms of expression, rather than those who develop already existing forms, all owe a great deal to the influence of Schopenhauer.&lt;ref name="Magee 1977"/&gt;

[[George Santayana|Santayana]]  praised Schopenhauer's doctrine that [[tragedy]] benefited audiences because it helped them to deny the will&amp;ndash;to&amp;ndash;live and to turn away from life. "He [Schopenhauer] thought tragedy beautiful because it detached us from a
troubled world and did not think a troubled world
good, as those unspeakable optimists did, because it
made such a fine tragedy. It is pleasant to find
that among all these philosophers one at least was
a gentleman."&lt;ref&gt;Santayana, George, [https://archive.org/details/egotismingerman00santuoft Egotism in German Philosophy], Chapter XI.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotations==
"&amp;hellip;things are certainly beautiful to ''behold'', but to ''be'' them is something quite different." (''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. II, Ch. XLVI)

"&amp;hellip;aesthetic pleasure in the beautiful consists, to a large extent, in the fact that, when we enter the state of pure contemplation, we are raised for the moment above all willing, above all desires and cares; we are, so to speak, rid of ourselves." (''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. I, § 68)

"Perhaps the reason why common objects in ''still life'' seem so transfigured and generally everything ''painted'' appears in a supernatural light is that we then no longer look at things in the flux of time and in the connection of cause and effect &amp;hellip;. On the contrary, we are snatched out of that eternal flux of all things and removed into a dead and silent eternity. In its individuality the thing itself was determined by time and by the [causal] conditions of the understanding; here we see this connection abolished and only the ''Platonic Idea'' is left." (''Manuscript Remains'', Vol. I, § 80)

'''Boomplaas Cave''' is located in the Cango Valley in the foothills of the [[Swartberg|Swartberg mountain range]], north of [[Oudtshoorn]], [[Eden District Municipality]] in the [[Western Cape]] Province, [[South Africa]]. It has a {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep stratified archaeological sequence of human presence, occupation and hunter-gatherer/herder acculturation dating back 80,000 years. The site's documentation contributed to the reconstruction of palaeo-environments in the context of changes in climate within periods of the [[Late Pleistocene]] (12,000 - 80,000 years [[Before Present|BP]]) and the [[Holocene]] (since 12,000 years BP). The cave has served multiple functions during its occupation, such as a [[kraal]] (enclosure) for animals, a place for the storage of oil rich fruits and as a hunting camp. Circular stone hearths and calcified dung remains of domesticated sheep as well as [[Adze|stone adzes]] and pottery art (painted stones) were excavated indicating that humans lived at the site and kept animals.&lt;ref name="Mountain"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mountain|first1=Alan|title=The First People of the Cape|date=2003|publisher=New Africa Education|isbn=978-0864866233|pages=42–43|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nR2d1iJo6_UC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=Boomplaas+Cave#v=snippet&amp;q=Boomplaas%20Cave%20sheep&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/5130742/Taphonomic_and_paleoecological_change_in_the_large_mammal_sequence_from_Boomplaas_Cave_Western_Cape_South_Africa |title= Taphonomic and paleoecological change in the large mammal sequence from Boomplaas Cave, Western Cape, South Africa  | publisher= Academia |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sajs.co.za/sites/default/files/publications/pdf/SAJS%20112_5-6%20Thackeray_Sci%20Corr.pdf |title= TComparison of Holocene temperature data (Boomplaas Cave) and oxygen isotope data (Cango Caves) by J.

'''Note:''' The site is not to be confused with the [[Blombos Cave]] and is not situated in the ''Boomplaas region'', [[Chris Hani District Municipality]], [[Eastern Cape]].

==Excavation==
The excavation conducted by [[Hilary Deacon|H.J. Deacon]] from 1974 to 1979 was part of an archaeological and palaeo-ecological study (including the Klasies River Caves) to provide information on changes in vegetation and fauna, the cultural sequence and the function of the cave in the area. Together the sequences of the Boomplaas Cave and the [[Klasies River Caves|Klasies River]] have established a unique record of the last 125,000 years for the region and southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00438243.1979.9979735?journalCode=rwar20  |title= Excavations at Boomplaas cave ‐ a sequence through the upper Pleistocene and Holocene in South Africa |journal= World Archaeology |volume= 10 |issue= 3 |pages= 241 | publisher= Informa Group plc  |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2016|doi= 10.1080/00438243.1979.9979735 |year= 2010 |last1= Deacon |first1= H. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faunal remains are preserved in all layer that include bone accumulated through human occupation and the bones of rodents, accumulated by owls roosting in the cave when humans were absent. Comparative faunal samples were collected from carnivore lairs (hyena and leopard) in the valley and from other owl roosts and a vegetation survey of the surroundings was undertaken. Records provided a base for the interpretation of charcoal and plant remains and to assess the effects of climate fluctuations on vegetation and animal life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.overbergrenosterveld.org.za/1983_fynbosmammals_program.pdf  |title= PALAEOENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS OF QUATERNARY LARGE MAMMALS IN THE FYNBOS REGION by Richard G. Klein | publisher= University of Chicago   |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of the artifacts in the Upper Pleistocene sequence suggest that the boundary between the Middle and Later Stone Age traditions is placed here between 30,000 and 40,000 years BP. and that while the [[Middle Stone Age]] populations may have been anatomically modern, their behaviour patterns do not show comparable continuity with the ethnographic present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com.kh/books?id=8HKDtlPuM2oC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=Boomplaas+Cave&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LJ9TZheJDI&amp;sig=zxKJYurJ9pwc5lGj1aNTQuBFLBA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjki5W95bbOAhVGRI8KHbmvA6g4ChDoAQhUMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=Boomplaas%20Cave&amp;f=false  |title= A Dictionary of Archaeology edited by Ian Shaw, Robert Jameson | publisher= Google Books |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deposits==
The stratigraphy of the deposits is very distinct and clearly visible and is documented in terms of sets of broadly contemporary layers (members), individual layers (units) and parts of layers (sub-units). The members recognised in the Boomplaas sequence are described as follows, from the top to the bottom.
* CBM Member - late 18th century and early 19th century
* DGL Member - around 1,700 years ago
* BLD Member - 2,000 years ago
* BLA Member - 6,500 years ago
* BRL Member - 10,000 years ago
* CL Member - between 14,500 and 12,000 years ago.
* GWA/HCA Member - 17,500 years ago
* LP Member - around the Last Glacial Maximum
* LPC Member - almost 22,000 years ago
* YOL Member - between 22,000 and about 32,000 years ago
* BP Member - 32,000 years ago
* OLP Member - 42,000 years ago
* BOL Member - suggested age 65,000 years
* OCH Member - 80,000 years
* LOH Member - bedrock layer

==Notable Artifacts==
* The oldest artifacts (BOL) are triangular stone flakes with facetted platforms.
* The stone artifact assemblage of the BOL Member and of the BP Member are made primarily of [[quartzite]] and include long flake blades (longer than 100&amp;nbsp;mm ) with lateral retouch on the main flake surface.
* At the YOL Member most objects are typical Middle Stone Age artifacts.
* The artifacts associated with the CL Member are classified within the ''Robberg industry'' (LSA) (bladelet industry of southern Africa), characterized by numbers of small blades (bladelets) and the small conical cores that produced them.
* The artifacts from BLA is assigned to the ''Wilton industry'' (Late Stone Age culture in southern Africa) with a higher frequency of backed tools than in BLD and DGL, associated with small scrapers and adzes.
* Several mammal species disappear during the Pleistocene/Holocene transition and a shift from hunting larger bodied animals like zebra and wildebeest to hunting or trapping smaller grysbok-sized antelope occurs.
* Ancestral [[Khoikhoi|Khoekhoen]] settlers account for leftovers of stone tools, ornamented pottery and seed storage pits in the most recent layers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2639">The '''British Dance Council''' was formed in 1929 as the '''Official Board of Ballroom Dancing''' (OBBD). The name was changed in 1985 to the '''British Council of Ballroom Dancing''' and in 1996, the name was changed to '''British Dance Council'''.  The BDC is the recognised governing body for [[Ballroom dance|Ballroom]], [[Latin Dancing|Latin American]], [[Sequence dancing|Sequence]] &amp; Freestyle Disco dance in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.british-dance-council.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

The BDC was originally formed to establish uniformity in the teaching of Ballroom Dance nationwide, although its responsibilities are now extensive both in the UK and abroad.  The primary function of the BDC is to devise and oversee the rules for competitive dancing.  All dance competitions in the UK, both amateur and professional are governed by BDC rules.  The BDC is also the national awarding body for championship titles in the UK.

Standardisation is another key function of the BDC.  There are a number of leading dance organisations in the UK, and each of these organisations has slight differences in technique and vocabulary.  The BDC works to ensure that, where possible, teachers from any organisation will be teaching dance the same way.  This is particularly important competitively, to make sure that all dancers can understand and perform their dances within the BDC rules, regardless of which dance organisation they trained with.

'''Canada House''' ({{lang-fr|Maison du Canada}}) is a [[Greek Revival]] building on [[Trafalgar Square]] in [[London]]. It has been a Grade II* [[Listed Building]] since 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num=1217724 |desc=Canada House (including the former Royal College of Physicians)|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has served as the offices of the [[High Commission of Canada in the United Kingdom]] since 1925.

== History ==
The building which would later become known as Canada House was built between 1824 and 1827 to designs by Sir [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]], the architect of the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/daily-news/major-contest-launched-for-overhaul-of-londons-canada-house/8644294.article Major contest launched for overhaul of London's Canada House] Architects Journal, 15 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally two buildings used by the [[Union Club (UK)|Union Club]] and the [[Royal College of Physicians]]. Under the leadership of High Commissioner [[Peter Charles Larkin]] the [[Canadian government]] acquired the Union Club in 1923 for the sum of £223,000.&lt;ref name=canada&gt;[http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/united_kingdom-royaume_uni/offices-bureaux/house-maison.aspx?lang=eng Canada House – the Government of Canada's showpiece for close to a century] Canada International&lt;/ref&gt; It was Larkin's intention to centralise the work of 200 Canadian employees scattered among offices in Victoria Street in one central building. Renovations cost $1.3 million CDN and were supervised by the architect [[Septimus Warwick]], who moved the main entrance from Trafalgar Square to Cockspur Street. The designers imported Canadian furniture, carpets and maple and birch flooring. The exterior was reclad in [[Portland stone]] to match the facade of the Royal College of Physicians. The building was officially opened on 29 June 1925 by King [[George V]].&lt;ref name=canada/&gt;

When he declared Canada House open, King George said: "Canada is a great country: alike in the literal sense of vast extent from 'sea to sea' and great in achievement and in promise: and it is right and necessary that its official representatives here should be housed in a manner worthy of the Dominion and adequate to the discharge of their ever-growing and important duties."&lt;ref&gt;[http://crht.ca/king-george-v-1910-1936/ King George V, 1910–1936]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[London Blitz]], a bomb fell near the building, only {{convert|20|yd}} away from future Canadian prime minister [[Lester B. Pearson]], who was the secretary to the High Commissioner at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international.gc.ca/history-histoire/assets/images/11-Canada_House_LR.jpg Canada House, circa 1941, after the [[London Blitz]]]&lt;/ref&gt; Canada increased its presence by acquiring the future [[Macdonald House (London)|Macdonald House]], located at 1 Grosvenor Square in Mayfair, in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/good-riddance-to-grosvenor-square-canada-house-is-our-real-home/article15676855/ Good riddance to Grosvenor Square: Canada House is our real home]  The Globe and Mail, 29 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Canada House was closed by the Canadian government as a cost-cutting measure with the intention of selling it. A [[Canadian federal election, 1993|change of government]] in Canada saw this decision reversed and renovations were planned instead, beginning in 1997. The building was officially reopened by Queen [[Elizabeth II]], as [[Monarchy of Canada|Queen of Canada]], in May 1998. To commemorate the reopening, a detachment from the 3rd Battalion, [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]], came to London and mounted the [[Queen's Guard]] at Buckingham Palace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royal.gov.uk/royaleventsandceremonies/changingtheguard/overview.aspx Changing the Guard]&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada House was closed again in 2010 and re-opened in 2012 for the [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Diamond Jubilee]]. It was used as Canada Olympic House during the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London. The main work of the High Commission, including consular, public affairs, political, trade and administrative functions was then carried out from [[Macdonald House (London)|Macdonald House]] in [[Mayfair]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/united_kingdom-royaume_uni/consular_services_consulaires/index.aspx?lang=eng&amp;menu_id=22 Passport and Services]&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013 the Government of Canada announced that it would consolidate its diplomatic presence at Canada House and sell off Macdonald House.  As part of the plan the building next door to Canada House, known as 2-4 Cockspur Street, was acquired by Canada in 2013 (until this date 2-4 Cockspur Street served as headquarters of the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w4mp.org/dcms-is-moving/|title=DCMS is moving|publisher=|accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building at 2-4 Cockspur Street was constructed between 1926-29 for Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada and had served as the Canadian Army's overseas headquarters in London during World War II. Over the next two years 2-4 Cockspur Street and Canada House were renovated. As part of the renovation, 2-4 Cockspur Street was joined to Canada House in July 2014.  In November 2013 Macdonald House was sold, although as part of the transaction the diplomatic staff were permitted to stay until the renovations to Canada House were completed and the diplomatic staff did not move to Canada House until December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/Canada+sells+diplomatic+mansion+Macdonald+House+London+Indian+developer+530M/9224845/story.html Canada.com – Canada sells diplomatic mansion Macdonald House in London to Indian developer for $530M]. Retrieved 29 Nov 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian High Commission transferred all of its diplomatic functions to Canada House on 15 December 2014. The Queen and the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] once again officially reopened Canada House on 19 February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/queen-elizabeth-ii-and-duke-of-edinburgh-officially-reopen-news-photo/463835544|title=Queen Elizabeth II and Duke of Edinburgh officially reopen Canada House|publisher=Getty Images|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chemamull chile precolumblian museum.JPG|thumb|250px|Wooden statues or '''chemamüll''']]
'''Chemamüll''' ("wooden person", from [[Mapuche language|Mapuche]] ''che'' "people" and ''mamüll'' "wood") are [[Mapuche]] statues made of wood used to signal the grave of a deceased person.

==Description==
[[File:Che mamull proporcion.svg|thumb|Proportion of a chemamüll, '''Mapuche''' funeral statue, over a person.|150px]]
The ''chemamüll'' are carved wooden statues, usually more than {{convert|2|m}} tall, that represent the stylized body and head of a human being. Statues may have male or female features. The Mapuche used whole logs of either ''[[Lophozonia obliqua]]'', a hardwood, or [[Laurelia sempervirens|laurel]] for their chemamüll.

The Mapuche made chemamüll in [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian times]] in a manner similar to [[headstone]]s. According to testimony in books, chemamüll helped the deceased's soul reunite with its ancestors. This sculpture stood by the deceased during the funeral and was then erected over the grave.

'''Coquivacoa''' or '''Coquibacoa''' is an indigenous name for an area in north-west [[Venezuela]] - either the [[Gulf of Venezuela]] (as used by Colombian President [[Alfonso López Michelsen]] in 1974) or [[Lake Maracaibo]] (as others argue&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} Graziano Gasparini (1976), ''Templos coloniales de Venezuela'', E. Armitano&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas]] said that the term had never been applied to the Gulf of Venezuela and actually referred to Lake Maracaibo - {{es icon}} Leandro Area, Elke de Stockhausen (2001), ''El Golfo de Venezuela'', Instituto de Estudios Políticos, Facultad de Ciencias Jurídicas y Políticas, Universidad Central de Venezuela, p128&lt;/ref&gt;) or possibly the wider region. It may also be the name of an indigenous people itself, in particular the people fought by [[Ambrosius Ehinger]] before his 1529 establishment of [[Maracaibo]]; the name "Maracaibo" may derive from a Coquivacoa chieftain killed by Ehinger. This people may be related to (or even identical to) the [[Wayuu]] or the [[Caquetio people]].

The Spanish ''conquistador'' [[Alonso de Ojeda]] had been appointed Governor of Coquibacoa in 1502, a position that only lasted a few months. He had applied the term ''Coquibacoa'' to the [[Guajira Peninsula]], which Ojeda erroneously thought was an island.

==Legacy==
A parish in Maracaibo is named ''Coquivacoa''. [[Gran Coquivacoa]] is a [[Gaita Zuliana]] group founded in 1968. There is a regional television station named [[Coquivacoa Televisión]]. Singer [[Alí Primera]] wrote a song called ''Coquivacoa''.

There is a city named [[Chivacoa]] in [[Yaracuy]] state, founded by [[Caquetio people]].

'''Crack the Whip''' is a simple outdoor children's game that involves [[physical coordination]], and is usually played in small groups, either  on grass or ice, usually grass. One player, chosen as the "head" of the whip, runs (or skates) around in random directions, with subsequent players holding on to the hand of the previous player. The entire "tail" of the whip moves in those directions, but with much more force toward the end of the tail. The longer the tail, the more the forces act on the last player, and the tighter they have to hold on.

As the game progresses, and more players fall off, some of those who were previously located near the end of the tail and have fallen off can "move up" and be in a more secure position by grabbing onto the tail as it is moving, provided they can get back on before some of the others do. There is no objective to this game other than the enjoyment of the experience.

The game is also illustrated in [[Winslow Homer]]'s painting ''[[Snap the Whip]]'' of 1872.

As one of the oldest continuous cultures in the world, [[Koreans]] have passed down their traditional narratives in a variety of ways.&lt;ref&gt;Korean Culture, Volume 23, Issue 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Food, Cuisine, and Cultural Competency for Culinary, Hospitality, and Nutrition Professionals by Sari Edelstein&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Concise History of Korea: From the Neolithic Period through the Nineteenth Century by Michael J.

===Dance===
{{Main|Korean dance}}
[[File:Korean sword dance-Jinju geommu-03.jpg|200px|thumb|''Jinju geommu'']]

There is a distinction between court dance and folk dance. Common court dances are ''jeongjaemu'' (정재무) performed at banquets, and ''ilmu'' (일무), performed at Korean Confucian rituals. ''Jeongjaemu'' is divided into native dances (향악정재, ''hyangak jeongjae'') and forms imported from Central Asia and China (당악정재, ''dangak jeongjae''). ''Ilmu'' are divided into civil dance (문무, ''munmu'') and military dance (무무, ''mumu''). Many mask dramas and mask dances are performed in many regional areas of Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Eckersley, M. ed. 2009. Drama from the Rim: Asian Pacific Drama Book (2nd ed.). Drama Victoria. Melbourne.p54,&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional clothing is the genja, it is a special kind of dress that women wear on festivals. It is pink with multiple symbols around the neck area.

Traditional choreography of court dances is reflected in many contemporary productions.

''[[Taekkyeon]]'', a traditional Korean martial art, is central to the classic Korean dance. Taekkyeon, being a complete system of integrated movement, found its core techniques adaptable to mask, dance and other traditional artforms of Korea.

===Painting===
{{Main|Korean painting}}
[[Image:Horse back archery AD 4C.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Korean horseback archery in the fifth century]]
The earliest paintings found on the [[Korea]]n peninsula are [[petroglyph]]s of prehistoric times. With the arrival of [[Buddhism]] from [[India]] via [[China]], different techniques were introduced. These techniques quickly established themselves as the mainstream techniques, but indigenous techniques still survived. Among them were the Goguryeo tomb murals, these murals inside many of the tombs are an invaluable insight into the ceremonies, warfare, architecture, and daily life of ancient Goguryeo people. Balhae kingdom, an successor state of Goguryeo, absorbed much of traditional Goguryeo elements.&lt;ref&gt;Traditional Painting: Window on the Korean Mind By Rober Koehler et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a tendency towards naturalism with subjects such as realistic landscapes, flowers and birds being particularly popular. Ink is the most common material used, and it is painted on mulberry paper or [[silk]].

In the 18th century indigenous techniques were advanced, particularly in calligraphy and seal engraving.

During the [[Joseon]] period, new genres of Korean painting flourished, such as ''[[chaekgeori]]'' (paintings of books) and ''munjado'' (paintings of letters), revealing the infatuation with books and learning in Korean culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=책거리|url=http://folkency.nfm.go.kr/kr/topic/%EC%B1%85%EA%B1%B0%EB%A6%AC/6591|website=Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture|publisher=National Folk Museum of Korea|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moon|first1=So-young|title=Exhibition defies conventions of Korean painting|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=3020712|website=Korea JoongAng Daily|publisher=JoongAng Ilbo|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arts are both influenced by tradition and realism. For example, Han’s near-photographic "Break Time at the Ironworks" shows muscular men dripping with sweat and drinking water from tin cups at a sweltering foundry. [[Jeong Seon|Jeong Son]]’s "Peak Chonnyo of Mount Kumgang" is a classical Korean landscape of towering cliffs shrouded by mists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.korea-is-one.org/article.php3?id_article=1715 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211110010/http://www.korea-is-one.org/article.php3?id_article=1715 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-12-11 |title=A rare glimpse into a closed art world |publisher=Korea Is One |date= |accessdate=2010-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crafts===

[[File:Korea-Joseon-Lacquer drawer-01.jpg|left|200px|thumb|[[Lacquer]] drawer with mother-of-pearl inlay, at the [[National Museum of Korea]] in Seoul]]
[[File:Ox-horn_boxes.jpg|thumb|right|Set of three scalloped [[Hwagak]], Ox-horn boxes]]

There is a unique set of handicrafts produced in [[Korea]]. Most of the handicrafts are created for a particular everyday use, often giving priority to the practical use rather than [[aesthetics]]. Traditionally, metal, wood, fabric, [[lacquerware]], and [[earthenware]] were the main materials used, but later glass, leather or paper have sporadically been used.

Ancient handicrafts, such as red and black pottery, share similarities with pottery of [[China|Chinese]] cultures along the [[Yellow River]]. The relics found of the [[Bronze Age]], however, are distinctive and more elaborate.

Many sophisticated and elaborate handicrafts have been excavated, including gilt crowns, patterned pottery, pots or ornaments. During the [[Goryeo]] period the use of bronze was advanced. [[Brass]], that is [[copper]] with one third [[zinc]], has been a particularly popular material. The dynasty, however, is most prominently renowned for its use of [[celadon]] ware.

During the [[Joseon]] period, popular handicrafts were made of porcelain and decorated with blue painting. Woodcraft was also advanced during that period. This led to more sophisticated pieces of furniture, including wardrobes, chests, tables or drawers. [[Korean furniture]] represents one of the great woodworking and design heritages of Asia and the world. It is part of a craft that goes back well over a millennium, keeping alive a tradition that remains unchanged from at least the seventeenth century. It is this tradition that has made Korean furniture one of the most sought-after styles of exotic furniture by antique dealers and collectors worldwide. Immediately recognizable as Korean, this unique art was only "discovered" by the West in the late 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Traditional Korean Furniture by Edward Reynolds Wright, Man Sill Pai&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[earthenware]] on the Korean peninsula goes back to the [[Neolithic]]. The history of [[Korean pottery and porcelain|Korean Ceramics]] is long and includes both Korean pottery a later development after the traditional use of coils and hammered clay to create early votive and sculptural artifacts. During the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms period]], pottery was advanced in [[Silla]]. The [[pottery]] was fired using a deoxidizing flame, which caused the distinctive blue grey [[Celadon (color)|celadon color]]. The surface was embossed with various geometrical patterns.

In the Goryeo period, jade green celadon ware became more popular. In the 12th century sophisticated methods of inlaying were invented, allowing more elaborate decorations in different colours. In Arts of Korea, Evelyn McCune states, "During the twelfth century, the production of ceramic ware reached its highest refinement. Several new varieties appeared simultaneously in the quarter of a century, one of which, the inlaid ware must be considered a Korean invention."&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn McCune, The Arts of Korea: An Illustrated History&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the Chinese nor the Japanese had produced inlaid celadon, which was unique to Goryeo wares. William Bowyer Honey of the Victoria and Albert Museum of [[England]], who after World War II wrote, "The best Corean (Korean) wares were not only original, they are the most gracious and unaffected pottery ever made. They have every virtue that pottery can have. This Corean pottery, in fact, reached heights hardly attained even by the Chinese."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XrZQs-6KswMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Korea+and+East+Asia+the+story+o+a+phoenix#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Korea and East Asia: The Story of a Phoenix - Kenneth B. Lee |publisher=Google Books |date= |accessdate=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White [[porcelain]] became popular in the 15th century. It soon overtook celadon ware. White porcelain was commonly painted or decorated with copper.

During the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)|Imjin wars]] in the 16th century, Korean potters were brought back to [[Japan]] where they heavily influenced Japanese ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/pottery.shtml |title=Pottery in Japan |publisher=Onmarkproductions.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-01}} "For example, Japan's famous Hagi ware originated when Korean potters were brought back to Japan during the "pottery wars" of 1592 AD and 1597 -1598 AD."&lt;/ref&gt;
Many Japanese pottery families today can trace their art and ancestry to these Korean potters whom the Japanese captured by the thousands during its repeated conquests of the Korean peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=BC Culture |url=http://blogcritics.org/archives/2005/08/11/090643.php |title=Review: Brighter than Gold - A Japanese Ceramic Tradition Formed by Foreign Aesthetics |author=Purple Tigress |accessdate=2008-01-10 |date=August 11, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118054520/http://blogcritics.org/archives/2005/08/11/090643.php |archivedate=2008-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/08/eaj/ht08eaj.htm |title=Muromachi period, 1392-1573 |publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|date=October 2002|accessdate=2008-01-10 |quote=1596 Toyotomi Hideyoshi invades Korea for the second time.

In the late Joseon period (late 17th century) blue-and-white porcelain became popular. Designs were painted in cobalt blue on white porcelain.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Korea}}
[[Image:Farmer dance.jpg|thumb|Pungmul]]
There is a genre distinction between folk music and court music. Korean folk music is varied and complex in different ways, but all forms maintain a set of rhythms (called 장단; Jangdan) and a loosely defined set of melodic modes. Korean folk musics are [[Pansori]] (판소리) performed by one singer and one drummer. Occasionally, there might be dancers and narraters. They have been designated an intangible cultural property in [[UNESCO|UNESCO's Memory of the world]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Pansori' was designated as intangible cultural property in UNESCO's Memory of the world.|url=http://news.mk.co.kr/newsRead.php?year=2003&amp;no=366779|newspaper=Maeil Business Newspaper|date=2003-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pungmul]] (풍물) performed by drumming, dancing and singing. Samul Nori is a type of Korean traditional music based on Pungmul, and [[Sanjo (music)|Sanjo]] (산조) that is played without a pause in faster tempos. [[Nongak]] (농악) means "farmers' music".

[[Korean court music]] can be traced to the beginning of the Joseon Dynasty in 1392. Korean court musics include [[Aak|A-ak]], [[Dangak|Dang-ak]] and [[Hyangak|Hyang-ak]]. Korean music is still played and sung a lot.

==Lifestyle==

===Homes===
{{Main|Korean architecture}}

[[File:Korea-Seoul-Namsangol-02.jpg|thumb|250px|Traditional house, [[hanok]] (한옥)]]
[[File:Korea south traditional house.jpg|thumb|200px|Traditional farmer's house; Folk Village, Seoul]]
Korean traditional houses are called [[Hanok]] ([[Hangul]]:한옥). Sites of residence are traditionally selected using traditional [[geomancy]]. Although geomancy had been a vital part of Korean culture and [[Korean Shamanism]] since prehistoric times, geomancy was later re-introduced by China during the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] period of Korea's history.

A house should be built against a hill and face south to receive as much sunlight as possible. This orientation is still preferred in modern Korea. Geomancy also influences the shape of the building, the direction it faces and the material the house is constructed with. 

Traditional Korean houses can be structured into an inner wing (안채, ''anchae'') and an outer wing (사랑채, ''sarangchae''). The individual layout largely depends on the region and the wealth of the family. Whereas aristocrats used the outer wing for receptions, poorer people kept cattle in the ''sarangchae''. The wealthier a family, the larger the house. However, it was forbidden to any family except for the king to have a residence of more than 99 ''kan''. A ''kan'' is the distance between two pillars used in traditional houses.

The inner wing normally consisted of a living room, a kitchen and a wooden-floored central hall. More rooms may be attached to this. Poorer farmers would not have any outer wing. Floor heating (온돌, ''[[ondol]]'') has been used in Korea since prehistoric times. The main building materials are [[wood]], [[clay]], [[tile]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], and [[thatching|thatch]]. Because wood and clay were the most common materials used in the past not many old buildings have survived into present times.

===Gardens===
[[File:Korea-Gyeongbokgung-Hyangwonjeong-01.jpg|thumb|250px|''Hyangwonjeong'', a garden in [[Gyeongbokgung]], Seoul]]

The principles of temple gardens and private gardens are the same. Korean gardening in [[East Asia]] is influenced by primarily [[Korean Shamanism]] and [[Korean folk religion]]. Shamanism emphasizes nature and mystery, paying great attention to the details of the layout. In contrast to Japanese and Chinese gardens, which fill a garden with man made elements, traditional [[Korean garden]]s avoid artificialities, trying to make a garden "more natural than nature".

The [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] pond is an important feature in the Korean garden. If there is a natural stream, often a pavilion is built next to it, allowing the pleasure of watching the [[water]]. Terraced flower beds are a common feature in traditional [[Korea]]n gardens.

The Poseokjeong site near [[Gyeongju]] was built in the [[Silla]] period. It highlights the importance of water in traditional Korean gardens. The garden of Poseokjeong features an abalone-shaped watercourse. During the last days of the [[Silla]] kingdom, the king's guests would sit along the watercourse and chat while wine cups were floated during banquets.

===Clothing===

{{Main|Hanbok}}
{{See also|List of Korean clothing}}
[[File:Korean costume-Hanbok-children.jpg|200px|thumb|''[[Hanbok]]'']]
[[File:Korea-Honrye-The bride.jpg|thumb|200px|''Hwarot'', bridal robe]]

[[File:Bride's Robe (Hwalot), 27.977.4.jpg|thumb|right|Bride's Robe (Hwalot), 19th century, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]

The traditional dress known as ''hanbok''  (한복, 韓服) (known as ''joseonot'' [조선옷] in the [[North Korea|DPRK]]) has been worn since ancient times. The ''hanbok'' consists of a shirt (''jeogori'') and a skirt (''chima'').

According to social status, Koreans used to dress differently, making clothing an important mark of social rank. Impressive, but sometimes cumbersome, costumes were worn by the ruling class and the royal family. These upper classes also used jewellery to distance themselves from the ordinary people. A traditional item of jewellery for women was a pendant in the shape of certain elements{{which|date=January 2014}} of nature which was made of precious gemstones, to which a tassel of silk was connected.

Common people were often restricted to undyed plain clothes. This everyday dress underwent relatively few changes during the Joseon period. The basic everyday dress was shared by everyone, but distinctions were drawn in official and ceremonial clothes.

During the winter people wore cotton-wadded dresses. Fur was also common. Because ordinary people normally wore pure white undyed materials, the people were sometimes referred to as the ''white-clad people''.

''Hanbok'' are classified according to their purposes: everyday dress, ceremonial dress and special dress. Ceremonial dresses are worn on formal occasions, including a child's first birthday ([[doljanchi]]), a wedding or a funeral. Special dresses are made for purposes such as shamans, officials.

Today the ''hanbok'' is still worn during formal occasions. The everyday use of the dress, however, has been lost. However, elderly still dress in hanbok as well as active estates of the remnant of aristocratic families from the Joseon Dynasty. Though this may be changing with something of a modern interest in the traditional dress among some of the young.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2016/10/29/2016102900345.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Korean cuisine}}
[[File:Korean cuisine-Bibimbap-08.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Bibimbap]]]]

[[Rice]] is the [[staple food]] of Korea. Having been an almost exclusively agricultural country until recently, the essential recipes in Korea are shaped by this experience. The main crops in Korea are rice, [[barley]], [[bean]]s and Gochujang (hot pepper paste), but many supplementary crops are used. [[Fish]] and other [[seafood]] are also important because Korea is a peninsula.

[[Fermentation (food)|Fermented]] recipes were also developed in early times, and often characterize traditional Korean food. These include [[Pickling|pickled]] fish and pickled vegetables. This kind of food provides essential [[protein]]s and [[vitamin]]s during the winter.

A number of dishes have been developed. These can be divided into ceremonial foods and ritual foods. Ceremonial foods are used when a child reaches 100 days, at the first birthday, at a wedding ceremony, and the sixtieth birthday. Ritual foods are used at funerals, at ancestral rites, shaman's offerings and as temple food.

A distinguishing characteristic of Temple Food is that it does not use the common five strong-flavoured ingredients of [[Korean cuisine]]--([[garlic]], [[Scallion|spring onion]], wild [[Allium scorodoprasum|rocambole]], [[leek]], and [[ginger]]), and meat.

[[Kimchi]] is one of the famous foods of Korea. Kimchi is pickled vegetables which contain vitamins A and C, thiamine, riboflavin, iron, calcium, carotene, etc. There are many types of kimchi including cabbage kimchi, spring onion kimchi, cucumber kimchi, [[Korean radish|radish]] kimchi, and sesame kimchi.

For ceremonies and rituals [[rice cake]]s are vital. The colouring of the food and the ingredients of the recipes are matched with a balance of [[yin and yang]].

Today, [[Korean royal court cuisine|surasang]] (traditional [[Noble court|court]] cuisine) is available to the whole population. In the past vegetable dishes were essential, but meat consumption has increased. Traditional dishes include ''[[ssam]]bap'', ''[[bulgogi]]'', ''[[sinseollo]]'', ''[[kimchi]]'', ''[[bibimbap]]'', and ''[[gujeolpan]]''.

===Tea===
{{Main|Korean tea}}

Originally tea was used for ceremonial purposes or as part of traditional herbal [[medicine]]. Some of teas made of fruits, leaves, seeds or roots are enjoyed. Five tastes of tea are distinguished in Korea: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and pungent.

===Festivals of the lunar calendar===
{{Main|Korean calendar}}

[[File:Korea-Daeboreumnal-Full Moon Festival-02.jpg|thumb|200px|Daeboreum]]

The traditional [[Korean calendar]] was based on the [[lunisolar calendar]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.koreainfogate.com/aboutkorea/item.asp?src=menu01_03 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224192903/http://www.koreainfogate.com/aboutkorea/item.asp?src=menu01_03 |date=February 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dates are calculated from Korea's [[meridian (geography)|meridian]]. Observances and festivals are rooted in Korean culture. The [[Korean calendar|Korean lunar calendar]] is divided into 24 turning points (절기, ''jeolgi''), each lasting about 15 days. The lunar calendar was the timetable for the agrarian society in the past, but is vanishing in the modern Korean lifestyle.

The [[Gregorian calendar]] was officially adopted in 1895, but traditional holidays and [[East Asian age reckoning|age reckoning]] are still based on the old calendar.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Life in Asia, Inc. |url=http://www.lifeinkorea.com/Calendar/holidays.cfm |title=Korean Holidays |publisher=Lifeinkorea.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713071101/http://www.lifeinkorea.com/Calendar/holidays.cfm |archivedate=2012-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Older generations still celebrate their birthdays according to the lunar calendar.

The biggest festival in Korea today is Seollal (the traditional [[Korean New Year]]). Other important festivals include [[Daeboreum]] (the first full moon), [[Dano (Korean festival)|Dano]] (spring festival), and [[Chuseok]] (harvest festival).

There are also a number of regional festivals, celebrated according to the lunar calendar. See also [[Public holidays in North Korea]] and [[Public holidays in South Korea]].

===Beliefs===
{{Main|Korean shamanism|Korean Buddhism|Korean Confucianism|}}

[[File:Korea-Haeinsa-21.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Haeinsa]]]]

The original religion of the Korean people was [[Shamanism]], which though not as widespread as in ancient times, still survives to this day. Female shamans or ''mudang'' are often called upon to enlist the help of various spirits to achieve various means.

[[Buddhism]] and [[Confucianism]] were later introduced to Korea through cultural exchanges with Chinese dynasties. Buddhism was the official religion of the Goryeo dynasty, and many privileges were given to Buddhist monks during this period. However, the Joseon period saw the suppression of Buddhism, where Buddhist monks and temples were banned from the cities and confined to the countryside. In its place a strict form of [[Korean Confucianism|Confucianism]], which some see as even more strict than what had ever been adopted by the Chinese, became the official philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhismtoday.com/english/world/country/027-korea.htm Buddhism in Korea, Korean Buddhism Magazine, Seoul 1997] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426080342/http://www.buddhismtoday.com/english/world/country/027-korea.htm |date=2009-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Korean Confucianism]] was epitomized by the [[seonbi]] class, scholars who passed up positions of wealth and power to lead lives of study and integrity.

Throughout Korean history and culture, regardless of separation, the traditional beliefs of [[Korean Shamanism]], [[Mahayana Buddhism]] and [[Confucianism]] have remained an underlying influence of the religion of the Korean people as well as a vital aspect of their culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asiasociety.org/countries/religions-philosophies/historical-and-modern-religions-korea Asia Society - Historical and Modern Religions of Korea]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, all these traditions coexisted peacefully for hundreds of years.

==World Heritage Sites==
There are a number of designated [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s in [[Korea]].

===Jongmyo Shrine===
{{Main|Jongmyo}}

The Jongmyo Shrine was added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] list in 1995 and is located in Seoul. The shrine is dedicated to the spirits of the ancestors of the royal family of the [[Joseon Dynasty]]. It is heavily influenced by [[Korean Confucianism|Korean Confucian]] tradition. An elaborate performance of ancient [[Korean court music|court music]] (with accompanying dance) known as ''Jongmyo jeryeak'' is performed there each year.

When it was built in 1394 it was to be one of the longest buildings in [[Asia]]. There are 19 memorial tablets of kings and 30 of their queens, placed in 19 chambers. The shrine was burnt to the ground during the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)|Imjin wars]], but rebuilt in 1608.

===Changdeokgung===
{{Main|Changdeokgung}}

[[Changdeokgung]] is also known as the "palace of illustrious virtue". It was built in 1405, burnt to the ground during the Imjin wars in 1592 and reconstructed in 1609. For more than 300 years Changdeokgung was the site of the royal seat. It is located in [[Seoul]].

The surroundings and the palace itself are well matched. Some of the trees behind the palace are now over 300 years old, besides a preserved tree which is over 1000 years old. Changdeokgung was added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] list in 1997.

===Bulguksa===
{{Main|Bulguksa}}

[[File:Seokguram Buddha.JPG|thumb|260px|[[Seokguram]] Grotto]]

[[Bulguksa]] is also known as the temple of the ''Buddha Land'' and home of the ''Seokguram Grotto''. The temple was constructed in 751 and consists of a great number of halls. There are two pagodas placed in the temple.

The ''Seokguram'' grotto is a hermitage of the Bulguksa temple. It is a granite sanctuary. In the main chamber a Buddha statue is seated. The temple and the grotto were added to the [[UNESCO]] World Heritage list in 1995.

===Tripitaka Koreana and Haeinsa===
{{Main|Haeinsa}}
{{See also|Tripitaka Koreana}}

[[Haein Temple|Haeinsa]] is a large temple in the [[South Gyeongsang]] province. It was originally built in 802 and home to the ''[[Tripitaka Koreana]]'' wood blocks, the oldest Buddhist wooden manuscripts in the world.&lt;ref name="Heritage"&gt;{{cite web |title=Tripitaka Koreana at Haeinsa Temple |url=http://www.ocp.go.kr/english/treasure/dom_hae.html |publisher=Cultural Properties Administration of South Korea |accessdate=2008-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506052257/http://www.ocp.go.kr/english/treasure/dom_hae.html |archivedate=2009-05-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The carving of these wood blocks was initiated in 1236 and completed in 1251. The wood blocks are testimony to the pious devotion of king and his people.

The word ''[[Tripitaka]]'' is [[Sanskrit]] and stands for three baskets, referring to the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] laws of aesthetics. The ''Tripitaka Koreana'' consists of 81'258 wood blocks and is the largest, oldest, and most complete collection of Buddhist scripts. Amazingly there is no trace of errata or omission on any of the wood blocks. The ''Tripitaka Koreana'' is widely considered as the most beautiful and accurate [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] canon carved in [[Hanja]].

The site was added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] list in 1995.

===Hwaseong===
{{Main|Hwaseong Fortress}}
{{See also|Korean fortress}}

[[File:Bifyu 8.jpg|thumb|250px|A frontal view of the west gate and watch tower]]

[[Hwaseong Fortress|Hwaseong]] is the fortification of the city [[Suwon]] south of [[Seoul]] in [[South Korea]]. Its construction was completed in 1796 and it features all the latest features of Korean fortification known at the time. The fortress also contains a magnificent palace used for the King's visit to his father's tomb near the city.

The fortress covers both flat land and hilly terrain, something rarely seen in [[East Asia]]. The walls are 5.52 kilometres long and there are 41 extant facilities along the perimeter. These include four cardinal gates, a [[floodgate]], four secret gates and a beacon tower.

Hwaseong was added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] list in 1997.

===Namhansanseong===
{{Main|Namhansanseong}}
{{See also|Korean fortress}}

Namhansanseong became a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Namhansanseong|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1439|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|accessdate=22 September 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sansa, Buddhist Mountain Monasteries ===
The Sansa are Buddhist mountain monasteries located throughout the southern provinces of the Korean Peninsula. The spatial arrangement of the seven temples that comprise the property, established from the 7th to 9th centuries, present common characteristics that are specific to Korea – the ‘madang’ (open courtyard) flanked by four buildings (Buddha Hall, pavilion, lecture hall and dormitory). They contain a large number of individually remarkable structures, objects, documents and shrines. These mountain monasteries are sacred places, which have survived as living centres of faith and daily religious practice to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1562|title=Sansa, Buddhist Mountain Monasteries in Korea|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historic Monuments and Sites in Kaesong===
{{Main|Kaesong}}

The Historic Monuments and Sites in Kaesong became a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Monuments and Sites in Kaesong|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1278|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|accessdate=22 September 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gochang, Hwasun and Ganghwa sites===
{{Main|Gochang, Hwasun and Ganghwa Dolmen Sites}}

The sites of ''Gochang'', ''Hwasun'' and ''Ganghwa'' were added to the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage]] in 2000. These sites are home to prehistoric graveyards which contain hundreds of different [[megalith]]s. These megaliths are [[headstone|gravestone]]s which were created in the 1st century B.C. out of large blocks of [[Rock (geology)|rock]]. Megaliths can be found around the globe, but nowhere in such a concentration as in the sites of Gochang, Hwasun and Ganghwa.

===Gyeongju Area===
{{Main|Gyeongju Historic Areas}}

The historic area around [[Gyeongju]] was added to the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage]] in 2000. Gyeongju was the capital of the [[Silla]] kingdom. The tombs of the Silla rulers can still be found in the centre of the city. These tombs took the shape of rock chambers buried in an earthen hill, sometimes likened with the [[pyramid]]s. The area around Gyeongju, in particular on the [[Namsan (Gyeongju)|Namsan]] mountain, is scattered with hundreds of remains from the Silla period. [[Poseokjeong]] is one of the most famous of these sites, but there is a great number of [[Korean Buddhism|Korean Buddhist]] art, sculptures, reliefs, [[pagoda]]s and remains of [[temple]]s and [[palace]]s mostly built in the 7th and 10th century.

===Complex of Goguryeo Tombs===
{{Main|Complex of Goguryeo Tombs}}

The [[Complex of Goguryeo Tombs]] lies in [[Pyongyang]], Pyong'an South Province, and Nampo City, South Hwanghae Province, [[North Korea]]. In July 2004 it became the first [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] site north of the 38th parallel.

The site consists of 63 individual tombs from the later [[Goguryeo]], one of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]]. It was founded around northern Korea and [[Manchuria]] around 32 BC, and the capital was moved to Pyongyang in 427. This kingdom dominated the region between the 5th and 7th century AD.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6281">'''Dinosaur erotica''', part of the larger genre of [[monster erotica]], is a subgenre of [[erotic literature]] that involves sexual encounters between humans and [[dinosaur]]s. Works include titles such as ''Taken by the T-Rex'', ''Ravished by Triceratops'' and ''A Billionaire Dinosaur Forced Me Gay''.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/feb/13/rex-appeal-literary-attraction-dinosaur-erotica|title=Rex appeal: the literary attraction of dinosaur erotica|last=Hartley|first=Emma|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=13 February 2015|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walter" /&gt; Despite being called by some in the media "the [[Kim Kardashian|Kardashian]] of erotica,"&lt;ref name="Walter" /&gt; the genre's titles have generated sales and media interest. Recently the genre has seen a surge in popularity, which can most likely be attributed to Teknotrans's Instagram account.[https://www.instagram.com/teknotransab/?hl=en]

==Themes==

Works of dinosaur erotica tend to be self-published short stories&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theamericanreader.com/life-sentences-dinosaur-erotica/|title=Life Sentences: Dinosaur Erotica|last=Roberts|first=Michael Reid|work=The American Reader}}&lt;/ref&gt; and often focus on common themes such as prehistoric female hunters who save their tribes from threatening (male) dinosaurs by having sex with them. According to Professor Clarissa Smith of the [[University of Sunderland]], who co-edits the journal ''[[Porn Studies]]'', dinosaur erotica is essentially an appeal to sexual fantasies: "The idea of having sex with [a dinosaur] is outside the realms of possibility. It’s a bit like 'magic', where all rules become suspended, and for that reason it may well allow ... for kinds of imaginative risk-taking impossible in more standard couplings."&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

==Authors and works==
Noted authors of dinosaur erotica include Christie Sims, Alara Branwen, Pippa Pout, [[Chuck Tingle]] and Hunter Fox (all pseudonyms). The genre was pioneered by Sims and Branwen, who were at [[Texas A&amp;M University]] together when they came up with the idea.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; Sims' author biography claims that "while my outward tastes are relatively simple, my inner thoughts are filled with lusty thoughts of big, strong, powerful monsters having their way with beautiful maidens".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanhatesthis/so-theres-an-author-on-amazon-who-writes-erotic-novels-about#.bt900A4rA|title=So There’s An Author On Amazon Who Writes Romance Novels About Women And Dinosaurs|last=Broderick|first=Ryan|publisher=BuzzFeed|date=2 October 2013|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her co-author Alara Branwen describes their source of inspiration in rather more mundane terms. She was working in a supermarket to help pay her bills when a co-worker mentioned how people were publishing fiction online and suggested that she should try writing erotica. After researching what sold well, she decided to experiment with the subgenre of monster erotica. Her first story, ''Doing the Dragon'' (involving a dragon having sex with a human girl), was a success and she was soon earning so much that she quit her supermarket job and went part-time at her college so that she could focus full-time on writing erotica together with Sims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/05/dinosaur-erotica-author-alara-branwen-interview_n_4049376.html|title=Dinosaur Erotica Author Alara Branwen Reveals Her Fantasies And T-Rex Sex Secrets|last=Hanson|first=Hilary|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=5 October 2013|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One day, thinking about the movie ''[[Jurassic Park]]'', she "pictured dinosaurs having their way with women. I died laughing. I was about to dismiss these thoughts as the workings of my freaky mind, but then I had an epiphany. Dinosaur erotica was something new that I’d never tried before."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2013/10/qa-the-women-who-write-dinosaur-erotica.html|title=Q&amp;A: The Women Who Write Dinosaur Erotica|work=NY Magazine|last=O'Connor|first=Maureen|date=3 October 2013|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dinosaur erotica is not the only genre tackled by the duo, who also write in other subgenres including "Dragon Beast Erotica", "[[Centaur]] Erotica" and "Dinosaur Beast Mating Erotica".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/02/dinosaur-erotica_n_4032092.html?1380744145|title=Dinosaur Erotica Will Take You Straight To Jurassic Pork|last=Hanson|first=Hilary|work=The Huffington Post|date=2 October 2013|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Sims and Branwen's titles focus on heterosexual sex, gay dinosaur erotica also exists. ''[[The Guardian]]'s'' columnist Damien Walter has published a review of Hunter Fox's short story ''A Billionaire Dinosaur Forced Me Gay'' by speculative fiction author Phronk. The review comments that the book "has no intrinsic redeeming qualities. It is horribly written, morally questionable, and even the sex in it seems like an afterthought ... It's the Kardashian of crappy erotica." Nonetheless, its mere success gives it meaning and appeal: &lt;blockquote&gt;The title alone is delightful, tapping into deep-seated cynicism about post-''[[Fifty Shades of Grey|50-Shades]]'' erotica and today’s publishing industry. Its unjustifiably high Amazon ranking delights and frustrates traditional authors and self-published authors alike. And the horrid writing only underscores how ridiculous it is that this bizarre artifact even exists.&lt;ref name="Walter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://damiengwalter.com/2013/11/30/a-billionaire-dinosaur-forced-me-gay-the-review/|title=A Billionaire Dinosaur Forced Me Gay - The Review|author=Walter, Damien|publisher=damiengwalter.com|date=30 November 2013|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Down shifting on the Rogue.jpg|thumb|275x275px|An example of what a down shifting lifestyle may allow more time for.]]
The term down-shifting in the English language refers to the act of reducing the gear of a motor vehicle while driving a [[manual transmission]]. This title or term has now been re purposed and applied to describe a [[social behavior]] or [[Social Trends|trend]] in which individuals live simpler lives to escape from what critics call the [[rat race]].

The long-term effect of downshifting can include an escape from what has been described as [[economic materialism]], as well as reduce the "stress and psychological expense that may accompany [[economic materialism]]". This new social trend emphasizes finding an improved [[Work–life balance|balance between leisure and work]], while also focusing life goals on personal fulfillment, as well as building personal relationships instead of the all-consuming pursuit of economic success.

Down-shifting, as a concept, shares many characteristics with [[simple living]]. However, it is distinguished as an alternative form by its focus on moderate change and concentration on an individual comfort level and a gradual approach to living.&lt;ref name="Tracey Smith, 2008"&gt;Tracey Smith, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, this new form of simple living began appearing in the [[mainstream media]], and has continually grown in popularity among populations living in [[Industrial society|industrial societies]], especially the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Schor 1998, p. 67;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Values and motives==
Down-shifters are people that adopt long-term [[voluntary simplicity]] in their lives. A few of the main practices of down-shifters include accepting less money for fewer hours worked, while placing an emphasis on consuming less in order to reduce their ecological footprint.  One of the main results of these practices is being able to enjoy more [[Leisure|leisure time]] in the company of others, especially loved ones.  

The primary motivations for downshifting are gaining leisure time, escaping from [[consumerism|work-and-spend cycle]], and removing the clutter of unnecessary possessions. The personal goals of downshifting are simple:  To reach a holistic self-understanding and satisfying meaning in life.&lt;ref&gt;Levy 2005, p.176&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its personalized nature and emphasis on many minor changes, rather than complete lifestyle overhaul, it attracts downshifters or participants across the socioeconomic spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;Both of Hamilton's case studies in 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  An intrinsic consequence of downshifting is increased time for non-work-related activities, which, combined with the diverse demographics of downshifters, cultivates higher levels of [[civic engagement]] and [[Social relation|social interaction]].&lt;ref name="Nelson 2007, p. 142"&gt;Nelson 2007, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope of participation is limitless, because all members of society &amp;mdash; adults, children, businesses, institutions, organizations, and governments &amp;mdash; are able to downshift.&lt;ref name="Tracey Smith, 2008"/&gt;

In practice, down-shifting involves a variety of [[behavior change (public health)|behavioral and lifestyle changes]]. The majority of these down-shifts are voluntary choices. Natural life course events, such as the loss of a job, or birth of a child can prompt involuntary down-shifting. There is also a [[Time|temporal dimension]], because a down-shift could be either temporary or permanent.&lt;ref name="Schor 1998, p. 68"&gt;Schor 1998, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==

===Work and income===
The most common form of down-shifting is work (or income) down-shifting. Down-shifting is fundamentally based on dissatisfaction with the conditions and consequences of the workplace environment.&lt;ref&gt;Schor 1998, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;  The philosophy of work-to-live replaces the social [[ideology]] of live-to-work. Reorienting economic priorities shifts the [[work–life balance]] away from the workplace.

Economically, work downshifts are defined in terms of reductions in either actual or potential [[income]], work hours, and spending levels.&lt;ref name="Schor 1998, p. 68"/&gt;  Following a path of earnings that is lower than the established market path is a downshift in potential earnings in favor of gaining other non-material benefits.

On an individual level, work downshifting is a voluntary reduction in annual income. Downshifters desire meaning in life outside of work and, therefore, will opt to decrease the amount of time spent at work or work hours.  Reducing the number of hours of work, consequently, lowers the amount earned.&lt;ref&gt;Schor 1998, pps. 66-69&lt;/ref&gt;  Simply not working [[overtime]] or taking a half-day a week for leisure time, are work downshifts.

Career downshifts are another way of downshifting economically and entail lowering previous aspirations of [[wealth]], a promotion or higher [[social status]].&lt;ref&gt;Juniu 2000, p. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;  Quitting a job to work locally in the community, from home or to start a business are examples of career downshifts.  Although more radical, these changes do not mean stopping work altogether.

Many reasons are cited by workers for this choice and usually center on a personal [[cost–benefit analysis]] of current working situations and the quality extracurricular activities. High stress, pressure from employers to increase productivity, and long [[Commuting|commutes]] can be factors that contribute to the costs of being employed.&lt;ref name="Schor 1998, p. 68"/&gt;  If the down-shifter wants more [[quality time|non-material benefits]] like leisure time, a healthy family life, or personal freedom, then, switching jobs could be a desirable option.

Work down-shifting may also be a key to considerable [[Health#Maintaining|health benefit]]s as well as a healthy [[retirement]]. People are retiring later in life than previous generations. We can see by looking at The Health and Retirement Study,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu|title=Welcome to the Health and Retirement Study|website=hrsonline.isr.umich.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; done by the Health and Retirement Study Survey Research Center, &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gustman|first=Alan|last2=Mitchell|first2=Olivia|last3=Steinmeier|first3=Thomas|date=1994-08|title=Retirement Research Using the Health and Retirement Survey|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.3386/w4813|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;women can show the long term [[Health#Maintaining|health benefits]] of down-shifting their work lives by working part time hours over a long period of years. Men however prove to be more unhealthy if they work part time from [[middle age]] till [[Retirement age|retirement]]. Men that down-shift their work life to part time hours at the age of 60 to 65 however benefit from continuing to work a part time job through a semi retirement even over the age of 70. This is an example of how flexible working policies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Suzan|last2=Roper|first2=Ian|date=2009-09-02|title=Flexible Working Arrangements: From Work–Life to Gender Equity Policies|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199234738.003.0018|journal=Oxford Handbooks Online|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199234738.003.0018}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be a key to being healthy while in retirement. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDonough|first=Peggy|last2=Worts|first2=Diana|last3=Corna|first3=Laurie M.|last4=McMunn|first4=Anne|last5=Sacker|first5=Amanda|date=2017-12|title=Later-life employment trajectories and health|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.alcr.2017.09.002|journal=Advances in Life Course Research|volume=34|pages=22–33|doi=10.1016/j.alcr.2017.09.002|issn=1040-2608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spending habits===
Another aspect of down-shifting is being a [[Ethical consumerism|conscious consumer]] or actively practicing alternative forms of consumption. Proponents of down-shifting point to [[consumerism]] as a primary source of stress and dissatisfaction because it creates a society of individualistic consumers who measure both social status and general happiness by an [[affluenza|unattainable quantity of material possessions]]. Instead of buying goods for personal satisfaction, consumption down-shifting, purchasing only the necessities, is a way to focus on quality of life rather than quantity.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2007, p. 142"/&gt;

This realignment of spending priorities promotes the functional utility of goods over their ability to convey status which is evident in downshifters being, in general, less [[brand]]-conscious.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson 2007, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; These consumption habits also facilitate the option of working and earning less because annual spending is proportionally lower. Reducing spending is less demanding than more extreme downshifts in other areas, like employment, as it requires only minor lifestyle changes.

===Policies that enable downshifting===
Unions, business, and governments could implement more [[Flextime|flexible working hours]], [[Part-time contract|part-time]] work, and other non-traditional work arrangements that enable people to work less, while still maintaining employment. Small business legislation, reduced filing requirements and reduced tax rates encourage small-scale individual [[entrepreneurship]] and therefore help individuals quit their jobs altogether and work for themselves on their own terms.&lt;ref name=GreenIllusions&gt;{{cite book|last=Zehner|first=Ozzie|title=Green Illusions|year=2012|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln and London|url=http://www.greenillusions.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environment consequences===
The catch-phrase of International Downshifting Week is "Slow Down and Green Up".&lt;ref name="Tracey Smith, 2008"/&gt;  Whether intentional or unintentional, generally, the choices and practices of down-shifters nurture environmental health because they reject the fast-paced lifestyle fueled by [[Fossil fuel|fossil fuels]] and adopt more sustainable lifestyles. The [[Manifest and latent functions and dysfunctions|latent function]] of consumption down-shifting is to reduce, to some degree, the [[carbon footprint]] of the individual down-shifter.  An example is to shift from a corporate suburban rat race lifestyle to a small eco friendly farming lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444327204577615972288993492 ''The Ultimate Growth Business; Many corporate refugees think green acres are the place to be. How do they make the transition?]'' October 12, 2012 ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Down-shifting geographically===
As a response the hectic pace of life and stresses in urban areas, downshifting geographically is a relocation to a smaller, rural, or more slow-paced community.&lt;ref name="Schor 1998, p. 68"/&gt;  This is a more drastic change, but because the access to the internet is widespread and possible, downshifting geographically does not bring total removal from mainstream culture.

==Sociopolitical implications==
Although downshifting is primarily motivated by personal desire and not by a conscious political stance, it does define societal [[overconsumption]] as the source of much personal discontent. By redefining life satisfaction in non-material terms, downshifters assume an alternative lifestyle but continue to coexist in a society and political system preoccupied with the economy. In general, downshifters are politically apathetic because mainstream politicians mobilize voters through the ''hip-pocket nerve'', proposing governmental solutions to periods of financial hardship and [[recession|economic recessions]]. This economic rhetoric is meaningless to downshifters who have forgone worrying about money.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton Jan. 2003, pps. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

Although consumers do hold the majority in the United States, the UK, and Australia, a significant minority, approximately 20 to 25 percent,&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Both 2003 Studies&lt;/ref&gt; of these countries' citizens identify themselves in some respect as downshifters. Downshifting is not an isolated or unusual choice.  Politics still centers around consumerism and unrestricted growth, but downshifting value, such as family priorities and workplace regulation, are appearing in political debates and campaigns.

Like downshifters, the [[The Cultural Creatives|Cultural Creatives]] is another social movement whose ideology and practices diverge from mainstream [[consumerism]] and according to Paul Ray, are followed by at least a quarter of U.S. citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton Nov. 2003, 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''In Praise of Slowness'', Carl Honoré relates followers of downshifting and [[simple living]] to the global [[Slow movement (culture)|Slow Movement]].

The emergence of a large and diverse class of downshifters challenges the economically bias ideas for improving society.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton Nov. 2003, pps. 35-37&lt;/ref&gt;  Downshifting and similar, [[Post-materialism|post-materialist]] ideologies are rising in popularity, but as a result of their [[grassroots]] nature, and relatively inconspicuous, non-confrontational subcultures, they represent unorganized [[List of social movements|social movements]] without political aspirations or motivating grievances.

A '''dying-and-rising''', '''death-rebirth''',  or '''resurrection deity''' is a religious [[motif (folkloristics)|motif]] in which a god or goddess dies and is [[Resurrection|resurrected]].&lt;ref name=LeemingG&gt;Leeming, "Dying god" (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burkert 1979, 99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stookey 2004, 99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miles 2009, 193"&gt;Miles 2009, 193&lt;/ref&gt; 
"[[Death or departure of the gods]]" is motif A192 in [[Stith Thompson|Stith Thompson's]] ''[[Motif (folkloristics)#Thompson’s Motif-Index|Motif-Index of Folk-Literature]]'' (1932), while "resurrection of gods" is motif A193.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;Thompson's categories
A192. Death or departure of the gods
and
A193. Resurrection of gods.

Examples of gods who die and later return to life are most often cited from the [[religions of the Ancient Near East]], and traditions influenced by them include [[Hebrew Bible|Biblical]]  and [[Greco-Roman mythology]] and by extension [[Christianity]].
The concept of a dying-and-rising god was first proposed in  [[comparative mythology]]  by [[James Frazer|James Frazer's]] seminal ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1890). Frazer associated the motif with [[fertility rite|fertility rites]] surrounding the yearly cycle of vegetation. Frazer cited the examples of [[Osiris]], [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]], [[Adonis]] and [[Attis]], [[Dionysus]] and [[Jesus Christ in comparative mythology|Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, quoted in Mettinger 2001:18, cited after Garry and El-Shamy, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Frazer's interpretation of the category has been critically discussed in 20th-century scholarship,&lt;ref&gt;summary in Mettinger (2001:15&amp;ndash;39)&lt;/ref&gt; to the conclusion that many examples from the world's mythologies included under "dying and rising" should only be considered "dying" but not "rising", and that the genuine dying-and-rising god is a characteristic feature of Ancient Near Eastern mythologies and the derived [[mystery cult]]s of [[Late Antiquity]].&lt;ref name="Gary19f"&gt; Garry and El-Shamy (2004:19f.), citing Mettinger (2001:217f.): "The world of ancient Near Eastern religions actually knew a number of deities that may be properly described as dying and rising [... although o]ne should not hypostasize these gods into a specific type ' ''the'' dying and rising god.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The [[Motif (folkloristics)|motif]] of a dying deity appears within the [[mythology]] of diverse cultures – perhaps because attributes of deities were derived from everyday experiences, and the ensuing conflicts often included death.&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt;
&lt;ref name=Garry&gt;{{cite book|title=Archetypes and Motifs in Folklore and Literature; a handbook|first1= Jane |last1=Garry |first2= Hasan |last2=M El-Shamy |date=December 1, 2004| ISBN= 0765612607 |pages= 19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lorena&gt;''Thematic Guide to World Mythology'' by Lorena Laura Stookey (Mar 30, 2004) {{ISBN|0313315051}} pages 106-107&lt;/ref&gt; These examples range from [[Baldr]] in [[Norse mythology|Norse]] mythology to the feathered serpent [[Quetzalcoatl]] in [[Aztec]] mythology to the Japanese [[Izanami]].&lt;ref name=Garry/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baldr/&gt;&lt;ref name=JapanMyth/&gt;

[[File:Odin's last words to Baldr.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Odin]] whispering to a dead [[Baldr]] as he is to be sent out to sea]]
The methods of death vary, ''e.g.'', in the myth of Baldr (whose account was likely first written down the 12th century&lt;!-- Can a source be found that not only emphasizes this point but also points out that Iceland was overwhelmingly Christian by this time? That's obviously the POINT that's being made here, but we need a source.--&gt;), he is inadvertently killed by his blind brother [[Höðr]] who is tricked into shooting a [[mistletoe]]-tipped arrow at him, and his body is then set aflame on a ship as it sails out to sea.&lt;ref name=Garry/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baldr&gt;''Norse Mythology: A Guide to Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs'' by John Lindow (Oct 17, 2002) {{ISBN|0195153820}} pages 66-68&lt;/ref&gt; Baldr does not come back to life because not all living creatures shed tears for him, and his death then leads to the "doom of the gods".&lt;ref name=Garry/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baldr/&gt; &lt;!-- Another account mentions him being resurrected AFTER Ragnarok. Why is this not included here? --&gt;

In contrast, in most variations of his story, Quetzalcoatl (whose story dates to around the first century) is tricked by [[Tezcatlipoca]] to over-drink and then burns himself to death out of remorse for his own shameful deeds.&lt;ref name=Garry/&gt;&lt;ref name=Quetz&gt;''The Myth of Quetzalcoatl'' by Enrique Florescano and Lysa Hochroth (Oct 29, 2002) {{ISBN|0801871018}} page 42&lt;/ref&gt; Quetzalcoatl does not resurrect and come back to life as himself, but some versions of his story have a flock of birds flying away from his ashes, and in some variants, Quetzalcoatl sails away on the ocean never to return.&lt;ref name=Garry/&gt;&lt;ref name=Quetz/&gt;

[[Hawaii]]an deities can die and depart the world in a number of ways; ''e.g.'', some gods who were killed on [[Lanai]] by Lanikuala departed for the skies.&lt;ref name=Garry/&gt; In contrast, Kaili leaves the world by a canoe which is never seen again.&lt;ref name=Garry/&gt; The Japanese god Izanami, on the other hand, dies of a fever and [[Izanagi]] goes to [[Yomi]], the land of gloom, to retrieve her, but she has already changed to a deteriorated state and Izanagi will not bring her back, and she pursues Izanagi, but he manages to escape.&lt;ref name=Garry/&gt;&lt;ref name=JapanMyth&gt;''Handbook of Japanese Mythology'' by Michael Ashkenazi (Nov 5, 2003) {{ISBN|1576074676}} page 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Some gods who die are also seen as either returning or bring about life in some other form, 
often associated with the vegetation cycle, or a staple food, in effect taking the form of a [[vegetation deity]].&lt;ref name=Garry/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lorena/&gt; Examples include [[Ishtar]] and [[Persephone]], who die every year.&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt; The yearly death of Ishtar when she goes underground represents the lack of growth, while her return represents the rebirth of the farming cycle.&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt; Most scholars hold that although the gods suggested in this motif die, they do not generally return in terms of rising as the same deity, although scholars such as Mettinger contend that in some cases they do.&lt;ref name=Garry/&gt;&lt;ref name=Met7221/&gt;

==Development of the concept==
The term "dying god" is associated with the works of [[James Frazer]],&lt;ref name="Miles 2009, 193"/&gt; [[Jane Ellen Harrison]], and their fellow [[Cambridge Ritualists]].&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman 2002, 163, lists divine kingship, taboo, and the dying god as "key concepts" of not only Frazer, but Harrison and others of the ritualist school, in contrast to differences among these scholars.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 19th century, in their ''[[The Golden Bough]]''&lt;ref name="Miles 2009, 193"/&gt; and ''Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion'', Frazer and Harrison argued that all myths are echoes of rituals, and that all rituals have as their primordial purpose the manipulation of natural phenomena.&lt;ref name="Miles 2009, 193"/&gt;

[[Image:Osiris-nepra.jpg|thumb|180px|The [[Osiris]]-bed, where he renews the harvest cycle in Egypt]]
Early in the 20th century, [[Gerald Massey]] argued that there are similarities between the Egyptian dying-and-rising god myths and Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Massey | first = Gerald | authorlink = Gerald Massey | coauthors = | title = Ancient Egypt, the light of the world | publisher = T. Fisher Unwin | year = 1907 | location = London | pages = 728–914 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=t00XAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Ancient+Egypt:+The+Light+of+the+World | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-1-4588-1251-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Massey's historical errors often render his works nonsensical, ''e.g.'', Massey stated that the biblical references to [[Herod the Great]] were based on the myth of "Herrut" the evil [[Lernaean Hydra|hydra]] [[Snake|serpent]], while the existence of Herod the Great can be well established without reliance on Christian sources.&lt;ref name=Porter18&gt;''Unmasking the Pagan Christ'' by Stanley E. Porter and Stephen J. Bedard 2006 {{ISBN|1894667719}} page 18&lt;/ref&gt; Massey's scholarship has been widely rejected by mainstream academics, including, among many others, Christian Evangelical writers such as Stanley E. Porter.&lt;ref name=Porter24&gt;''Unmasking the Pagan Christ'' by Stanley E. Porter and Stephen J. Bedard 2006 {{ISBN|1894667719}} page 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swiss [[psychoanalyst]] [[Carl Jung]] argued that [[archetype|archetypal]] processes such as death and resurrection were part of the "trans-personal symbolism" of the [[collective unconscious]], and could be utilized in the task of psychological integration.&lt;ref name="Crowley 2000"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Crowley |first=Vivianne |title=Jung: A Journey of Transformation:Exploring His Life and Experiencing His Ideas |year=2000 |publisher=Quest Books |location=Wheaton Illinois |isbn=978-0-8356-0782-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2012}} He also proposed that the [[myths]] of the [[pagan]] [[gods]] who symbolically died and resurrected foreshadowed [[Christ]]'s literal/physical death and resurrection.&lt;ref name="Crowley 2000"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2012}} The overall view of Jung regarding religious themes and stories is that they are expressions of events occurring in the unconscious of the individuals - regardless of their historicity.&lt;ref name=Tim287/&gt; From the symbolic perspective, Jung sees dying and rising gods as an [[archetype|archetypal]] process resonating with the [[collective unconscious]] through which the rising god becomes the greater personality in the [[Self in Jungian psychology|Jungian self]].&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt; In Jung's view, a biblical story such as the resurrection of Jesus (which he saw as a case of dying and rising) may be true or not, but that has no relevance to the psychological analysis of the process, and its impact.&lt;ref name=Tim287&gt;''Care for the Soul: Exploring the Intersection of Psychology and Theology'' by Mark R. McMinn and Timothy R. Phillips (Apr 25, 2001) {{ISBN|0830815538}} Intervarsity page 287&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bronze figurine of Egyptian god Osiris.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Bronze figurine of [[Osiris]]]]
The analysis of [[Osiris]] permeates the later religious psychology of Carl Jung more than any other element.&lt;ref name=Sauder&gt;Alane Sauder-MacGuire, "Osiris and the Egyptian Religion" in the ''Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion'' by David A. Leeming, Kathryn Madden and Stanton Marlan (Nov 6, 2009) {{ISBN|038771801X}} Springer, pages 651-653&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950 Jung wrote that those who partake in the [[Osiris myth]] festival and follow the ritual of his death and the scattering of his body to restart the vegetation cycle as a rebirth "experience the permanence and continuity of life which outlasts all changes of form".&lt;ref&gt;''The Archetypes and The Collective Unconscious'' (Collected Works of C.G. Jung Vol.9 Part 1) by C. G. Jung and R.F.C. Hull (Aug 1, 1981) {{ISBN|0691018332}} page 117&lt;/ref&gt; Jung wrote that Osiris provided the key example of the rebirth process in that initially only the [[Pharaoh]]s "had an Osiris" but later other Egyptians nobles acquired it and eventually it led in the concept of [[soul]] for all individuals in Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;''The Archetypes and The Collective Unconscious'' (Collected Works of C.G. Jung Vol.9 Part 1) by C. G. Jung and R.F.C. Hull (Aug 1, 1981) {{ISBN|0691018332}} page 128&lt;/ref&gt; Jung believed that Christianity itself derived its significance from the archetypal relationship between Osiris and Horus versus [[God the Father]] and Jesus, his son.&lt;ref name=Sauder/&gt; However, Jung also postulated that the rebirth applied to Osiris (the father), and not Horus, the son.&lt;ref name=Sauder/&gt;

The general applicability of the death and resurrection of Osiris to the dying-and-rising-god analogy has been criticized, on the grounds that it derived from the harvesting rituals that related the rising and receding waters of the [[Nile river]] and the farming cycle.&lt;ref name=Porter24/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pinch&gt;''Egyptian Mythology, a Guide to the Gods, Goddesses, and Traditions of Ancient Egypt'' by Geraldine Pinch 2004 {{ISBN|0195170245}} Oxford Univ Press page 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New Testament tools and studies''", Bruce Manning Metzger, p. 19, Brill Archive, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; The cutting down of barley and wheat was related to the death of Osiris, while the sprouting of shoots was thought to be based on the power of Osiris to resurrect the farmland.&lt;ref name=Porter24/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pinch/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bunson290&gt;''Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt'' by Margaret Bunson 1999 {{ISBN|0517203804}} page 290&lt;/ref&gt; In general rebirth analogies based on the vegetation cycle are viewed as the weakest elements in the death-rebirth analogies.&lt;ref name=Bailey/&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]] [[Dionysus]], the son of [[Zeus]] was a horned child who was torn to pieces by [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]]s who lured him with toys, then boiled and ate him.&lt;ref name=Kiki71/&gt;&lt;ref name=Anton/&gt; Zeus then destroyed the Titans by thunderbolt as a result of their action against Dionysus and from the ashes humans were formed.&lt;ref name=Anton/&gt; However, Dionysus' grandmother [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] managed to put some of his pieces back together (principally from his heart that was spared) and brought him back to life.&lt;ref name=Kiki71&gt;''Euripides and Alcestis'' by Kiki Gounaridou (Sep 3, 1998) University Press Of America {{ISBN|0761812318}} page 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anton&gt;''The Greek World'' by Anton Powell (Sep 28, 1997) {{ISBN|0415170427}} page 494&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars such as [[Barry B.

==Scholarly criticism==
[[Image:Aphrodite Adonis Louvre MNB2109.jpg|thumb|[[Aphrodite]] and [[Adonis]], ca. 410 BC, [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]]]]
The category "dying-and-rising-god" was debated throughout the 20th century, most modern scholars questioning its ubiquity in the world's mythologies.&lt;ref name="Garry"/&gt;
By the end of the 20th century the overall scholarly consensus had emerged against the category, given its limited applicability outside of [[Ancient Near Eastern religions]] and derived traditions.&lt;ref name=Garry/&gt; 
[[Tryggve Mettinger]] (who supports the category) states that there is a scholarly consensus that the category is inappropriate from a historical perspective.&lt;ref name=Met7221&gt;Mettinger, Tryggve N. D. (2001). ''The Riddle of Resurrection: Dying and Rising Gods in the Ancient Near East''. Almqvist &amp; Wiksell, pages 7 and 221&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Kurt Rudolph]]  in 1986 argued that the oft-made connection between the mystery religions and the idea of dying and rising divinities is defective.  Against this view, Mettinger (2001) affirms that many of the gods of the mystery religions do indeed die, descend to the underworld, are lamented and retrieved by a woman and restored to life.&lt;ref name="Gary19f"/&gt;

While the concept of a "dying-and-rising god" has a longer history, it was significantly advocated by Frazer's ''Golden Bough'' (1906&amp;ndash;1914). At first received very favourably, the idea was attacked by [[Roland de Vaux]] in 1933, and was the subject of controversial debate over the following decades.&lt;ref name="Mettinger2004"&gt;Tryggve Mettinger, "The 'Dying and Rising God': A survey of Research from Frazer to the Present Day", in   Batto et al. (eds.), ''David and Zion: Biblical Studies in Honor of J.J.M. Roberts'' (2004), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=Vlkb0cSBGlIC&amp;pg=PA373 373&amp;ndash;386]&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the leading scholars in the deconstruction of Frazer's "dying-and-rising god" category was [[Jonathan Z. Smith]], whose 1969 dissertation discusses Frazer's ''Golden Bough'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jonathan |last=Zittell Smith |title=The Glory, Jest and Riddle. James George Frazer and The Golden Bough|work= Yale dissertation |year=1969|url=http://rel.as.ua.edu/pdf/rel490jzsdiss.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and who in [[Mircea Eliade]]'s 1987 ''Encyclopedia of religion'' wrote the "Dying and rising gods" entry, where he dismisses the category as "largely a misnomer based on imaginative reconstructions and exceedingly late or highly ambiguous texts", suggesting a more detailed categorisation into "dying gods" and "disappearing gods", arguing that before Christianity, the two categories were distinct and gods who "died" did not return, and those who returned never truly "died".&lt;ref name=JZSmith&gt;Smith, Jonathan Z. (1987). "Dying and Rising Gods," in ''The Encyclopedia of Religion'' Vol. IV, edited by  Mircea Eliade {{ISBN|0029097002}} Macmillan, pages 521-527&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gale|first1=Thomson|title=Dying and Rising Gods|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/dying-and-rising-gods|website=Home Search Research categories|publisher=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Smith gave a more detailed account of his views specifically on the question of parallels to Christianity in ''Drudgery Divine'' (1990).&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Z. Smith "On Comparing Stories", ''Drudgery Divine: On the Comparison of Early Christianities and the Religions of Late Antiquity'' (1990), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=cTGuREaQOewC&amp;pg=PA85#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 85&amp;ndash;115].
&lt;/ref&gt;
Smith's 1987 article was widely received, and during the 1990s, scholarly consensus seemed to shift towards his rejection of the concept as oversimplified, although it continued to be invoked by scholars writing about Ancient Near Eastern mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Mettinger (2004) cites M.S. Smith, ''The Ugaritic Baal Cycle'' and H.-P. Müller, "Sterbende ud auferstehende Vegetationsgötter? Eine Skizze," TZ 53 (1997:374)&lt;/ref&gt;
As of 2009, the ''Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion'' summarizes the current scholarly consensus as ambiguous, with some scholars rejecting Frazer's "broad universalist category" preferring to emphasize the differences between the various traditions, while others continue to view the category as applicable.&lt;ref name=Bailey&gt;Lee W. Bailey, "Dying and rising gods" in:  David A. Leeming, Kathryn Madden and Stanton Marlan (eds.)  ''Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion'' (2009) {{ISBN|038771801X}} Springer, pages 266-267&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Gerald O'Collins]] states that surface-level application of analogous symbolism is a case of [[parallelomania]] which exaggerate the importance of trifling resemblances, long abandoned by mainstream scholars.&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;[[Gerald O'Collins]], "The Hidden Story of Jesus" ''New Blackfriars'' Volume 89, Issue 1024, pages 710–714, November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with an overview of the [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] ritual of growing and withering herb gardens at the [[Adonis (mythology)|Adonis]] festival, in his book ''The Gardens of Adonis'' [[Marcel Detienne]] suggests that rather than being a stand-in for crops in general (and therefore the cycle of death and rebirth), these herbs (and Adonis) were part of a complex of associations in the Greek mind that centered on spices.&lt;ref name=GardenAdonis&gt;''The Gardens of Adonis'' by Marcel Detienne, Janet Lloyd and Jean-Pierre Vernant (Apr 4, 1994) {{ISBN|0691001049}} Princeton pages iv-xi&lt;/ref&gt; These associations included seduction, trickery, gourmandizing, and the anxieties of childbirth.&lt;ref name=Batto/&gt; From his point of view, Adonis's death is only one datum among the many that must be used to analyze the festival, the myth, and the god.&lt;ref name=Batto&gt;''David and Zion'', Biblical Studies in Honor of J.J.M. Roberts, edited by Bernard Frank Batto, Kathryn L. Roberts and J. J. M. Roberts (Jul 2004) {{ISBN|1575060922}} pages 381-383&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Elinor301&gt;''Comparative Criticism'' Volume 1 by Elinor Shaffer (Nov 1, 1979) {{ISBN|0521222966}} page 301&lt;/ref&gt;

A main criticism charges the group of analogies with [[reductionism]], insofar as it subsumes a range of disparate myths under a single category and ignores important distinctions. [[Marcel Detienne]] argues that it risks making Christianity the standard by which all religion is judged, since death and resurrection are more central to Christianity than many other faiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Detienne|1994}}; see also {{harvnb|Burkert|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dag Øistein Endsjø]], a scholar of religion, points out how a number of those often defined as dying-and-rising-deities, such as a number of figures in [[Resurrection#Ancient Greek religion|ancient Greek religion]], actually died as ordinary mortals, only to become gods of various stature after they were resurrected from the dead. Not dying as gods, they thus defy the definition of “dying-and-rising-gods”.&lt;ref&gt;Dag Øistein Endsjø. ''Greek Resurrection Beliefs and the Success of Christianity.'' New York: Palgrave Macmillan 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s, Smith's scholarly rejection of the category has been widely embraced by [[Christian apologists]] wishing to defend the [[historicity of Jesus]], while scholarly defenses of the concept (or its applicability to mystery religion) have been embraced by the [[new atheism]] movement wishing to argue the [[Christ myth theory]].&lt;ref&gt;

{{Italic title}}
'''''Elene''''' is a [[poem]] in [[Old English]], that is sometimes known as '''''Saint Helena Finds the True Cross'''''. It was translated from a [[Latin]] text and is the longest of [[Cynewulf]]'s four signed poems. It is the fifth of six poems appearing in the [[Vercelli book|Vercelli manuscript]], which also contains ''[[The Fates of the Apostles]]'', ''[[Andreas]]'', ''[[Soul and Body I]]'', the ''Homiletic Fragment I'' and ''[[Dream of the Rood]]''. The poem is the first English account of the finding of the [[True Cross|Holy Cross]] by [[Helena (empress)|Saint Helena]], the mother of [[Emperor Constantine]].  The poem was written by Cynewulf some time between 750 and the tenth century. &lt;!-- (Cameron 1987) --&gt; It is written in a [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon]] [[dialect]], but certain Anglianisms and metrical evidence concerning false rhymes suggest it was written in an [[Old English|Anglian]] rather than Saxon dialect.  It is 1,321 lines long.

== Cynewulf ==

{{Main article|Cynewulf}}
Cynewulf’s signature, which is always in [[rune]]s, appears on ''[[Christ II]]'', ''[[Juliana (poem)|Juliana]]'', ''[[The Fates of the Apostles]]'' and ''Elene''.  The dialect in his poems suggests that he was either [[Mercia]]n or [[Northumbria]]n.&lt;!-- (Bjork 1998) --&gt; He was probably most active around the late 8th and early 9th centuries, though there is other research to support that he was active between the late 9th and late 10th centuries.

Cynewulf’s true identity is still unknown, but there have been efforts to narrow down the list of possible poets.  The four most favored candidates are [[Cynewulf of Lindisfarne|Cynewulf, who was the bishop of Lindisfarne]] in Northumbria in around 783; Cynulf, a [[priest]] (ca. 803); Cynewulf, the father of [[Cyneweard of Glastonbury|Bishop Cyuneweard of Wells]], who died in 975; and Cenwulf, an [[abbot]] of [[Peterborough Cathedral|Peterborough Abbey]] in around 1006).&lt;!-- (Bjork 1998) --&gt; There is not enough evidence to support any of these claims.

== Manuscript ==

''Elene'' is contained in the ''[[Vercelli Book]]'', appearing on fol. 121a-133b.

== Plot summary ==

The story is loosely based on historical events and takes place within an [[anachronistic]] setting that amalgamates wars of the fourth-century involving the [[Roman army|Romans]], the [[Huns]] and the [[Franks]]. ''Elene'' fits into a subgenre of ''[[inventio]]'', the search for sacrosanct [[relic]]s of the saints. Cynewulf’s source for the legend of St. Helena's Finding of the Cross was probably the ''Acta Cyriaci'' and a version of it is written in the ''[[Acta Sanctorum]]'' for May 4.

The poem begins with [[Constantine the Great|Constantine, emperor of Rome]], riding out to battle the Huns and Hrethgoths.  He is a mighty king made strong by God, though he is not aware of the Christian God yet.  He sees a vision in the sky and he is told that he will halt his enemies with the symbol that is shown to him by the heavens.  The battle begins and Constantine reveals the symbol that he was shown, a [[Christian cross|cross]].  The cross sends his enemies running in all directions and they are easily defeated by the Romans.

Constantine returns home and addresses an assembly on whether they know the meaning of the symbol that saved his people.  Only the wisest know that the cross is the symbol of the Lord in Heaven, [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]].  Constantine is [[Baptism|baptized]] and becomes a devout [[Christianity|Christian]], due to his experience.  He learns from the [[Bible]] how and where Christ was killed, so he orders Helen, his mother, to lead an army to the land of the [[Judaism|Jews]] to find where the true cross is buried.  She leads an army of men onto a ship and begins the journey to [[Israel]].

Once in the city of [[Jerusalem]], she calls an assembly of sage Jews and scorns them for having condemned Jesus to death, leaving them wondering what they have done to anger the queen.  Judas tells his fellow Jews that he knows the queen searches for the cross.  Judas was brought up on Christian teachings, and his brother [[Saint Stephen|Stephen]] was stoned to death for being a Christian.  The Jews refuse to help Helen find the cross, so she threatens them with death.  Frightened, they hand over Judas.  He also refuses to tell her where it is, so she locks him in a dark prison for seven days without food.  On the seventh day he cries out that he cannot take the torture any longer and will reveal where the cross is.  He leads the queen to the hill where Jesus was crucified.

[[Judas Cyriacus|Judas]] converts to Christianity in a passionate speech to God acknowledging Jesus as his Savior.  God gives Judas a smoke sign in the sky, which convinces him of his new-found belief.  He digs and finds three crosses.  A crowd forms, but no one knows which of the three was the cross of Christ.  They set the crosses up in the city hoping that Christ would show them the truth.  A corpse is brought forth, and each cross is held over him.  The third cross brings him back to life.

[[Satan]] appears in grotesque form angry that he has had a soul stolen from him.  Judas cleverly argues with Satan with his new faith, but Satan leaves with a threat that he will raise up a king to retaliate.  Helen sends word home to Constantine, who tells her to build a [[Church (building)|church]] on the hillside where the crosses were found.  She encases the true cross in [[gold]] and jewels and places it in the church.  Judas is baptized and puts away his false religion.  He is appointed to priesthood and is renamed Cyriacus because of his rebirth.

Helen then decides she needs to find the nails that held Christ up on the cross.  Cyriacus searches for them, and God again gives him a sign in the form of fire to show where they are buried.  Helen receives the gift with tears of joy, and the [[Holy Spirit]] fills her with the gift of wisdom and forever protects the saint.  She goes to a wise man to find out how she should use the nails, and he advises her to use them in the bit of Constantine’s horse so that he would always be victorious in battle.  The [[epilogue]] of the poem is devoted to the personal reflection of Cynewulf and his interpretation of [[Doomsday event|Doomsday]]. Cynewulf tells of how he has experienced a spiritual metamorphosis. His depiction of the [[Last Judgement]] resembles a sort of [[Purgatory]] where people are divided into three groups, two of which undergo cleansing to reach salvation, while the third is damned to eternal [[Hell]].

== Analysis ==

Helen is not the typical passive Old English heroine.  She is strong and autonomous, more like the women in [[Old Norse literature]] rather than the Graeco-Roman saints.&lt;!-- (Olsen 224) --&gt; Old Norse heroines are strong, assertive, and persuade physically instead of verbally.  Cynewulf purposely wanted his audience to view Helen as a strong individual.  He does not include her death in the poem as the [[Latin]] version does and he does not have her submitting to Constantine and Cyriacus as she does in the Latin version.  In fact it is the opposite.  We see Cyriacus completely submitting himself to Helen: ''hæfde Ciriacus / eall gefylled swa him seo æðele bebead, / wifes willan'' (line 1129b), ''('Cyriacus had completely done as the noble woman bade him to do, the will of the woman')''.&lt;!-- (Olsen 224) --&gt;

Helen can be understood as an [[allegory]] of the [[Christian Church]] and its mission to lead men to salvation through acceptance of the Cross.&lt;!-- (Hermann 99) --&gt; Literally, her mission is to find the true cross, but allegorically, her mission is to [[Evangelism|evangelize]] the Jews.  Helen is referred to as a warrior queen and she has an army of warriors, but they never fight.  The warriors are there to subjugate a powerful enemy, which could be Satan or non-believers.  Judas and Helen are an allegory for the relationship of the Church with its members.  Judas’s dialogue reveals him to be of the human condition; he has the capacity for saintliness and wickedness.&lt;!-- (Bjork 1985, 62) --&gt;

[[Anti-Semitism]] is a topic of discussion for scholars regarding the poem: Elene’s oppressive tactics towards the Jewish elders are rewarded in the end.&lt;ref&gt;See Fulk 2003, p.99&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Marxist]] argument can also be made when looking at how Judas eventually submits to his oppressor. He arises from the pit as a heroic-type figure and it seems the reins of authority Elene exercises only do good in the end. It is contended that this justifies the authority of royalty in Cynewulf’s time.&lt;ref&gt;See Klein 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of symbolism, the good-bad dichotomy, which is prevalent in Old English verse, finds itself in the oppositions of light and dark imagery in the poem. For instance, it is observed in the poem that Judas spends seven nights in a pit, and the 'darkness' can be seen to convey his obstinacy in refusing to see the 'light' of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;See Greenfield 1965, p.114 and Klein 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with [[alliteration]], which is a key part to all Old English poetry, there are also places in the poem where Cynewulf applies rhyme in order to emphasize certain words, such as in the battle scene (50-55a):
&lt;poem&gt;
''Ridon ymb rofne,     ðonne rand '''dynede''',
 camp wudu '''clynede''',     cyning ðreate for,
 herge to hilde.     Hrefen uppe gol,
 wan ond wælfel.     Werod wæs on tyhte.
 '''Hleopon''' hornboran,     '''hreopan''' frican,
 mearh moldan træd.''
&lt;/poem&gt;
 
''('They rode about the famous one; then the shield dinned, the battle-tarp clanged, the king advanced with a troop, a battalion to   the battle.  The raven yelled from above, dark and greedy for carrion.  The troop was on the march.  The horn-bearers ran, the  heralds called out, the horse trod the earth''),&lt;!-- (Zacher 354) --&gt; In this example, the rhymes emphasize the din of voices and the crash of weapons,&lt;!-- (Zacher 354) --&gt; which builds excitement throughout the battle scene.

'''''The Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history, society and culture''''',&lt;ref name=isbn&gt;Paper Set {{ISBN|0-85575-234-3}} Windows {{ISBN|0-85575-261-0}} Macintosh {{ISBN|0-85575-278-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited by [[David Horton (Australia)|David Horton]], is an [[encyclopedia|encyclopaedia]] published by the "Aboriginal Studies Press" at the [[Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies]] (AIATSIS) in 1994 and available in two volumes or on [[CD-ROM]] covering all aspects of [[Indigenous Australians]] lives and world (such as biography, history, art, language, sport, education, archaeology, literature, land ownership, social organisation, health, music, law, technology, media, economy, politics, food and religion). There are 2000 entries and 1000 photographs, with the CD-ROM having 250 sound items and 40 videos.

An Indigenous language map was produced in 1996. It consists of names and regions used in the encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia.  The map also shows some of the language groups in Australia with a more complete list on the reverse.&lt;ref&gt;Horton, David. Aboriginal Australia [map]. Canberra : AIATSIS, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributors==
Over 200 contributors wrote articles for the encyclopaedia.  Many of them are Indigenous writers, activists or scholars.  In an unusual decision, the editor has chosen to mention white people in the encyclopaedia only if they have some impact on Aboriginal society.&lt;ref&gt;Read, Peter. For the record. In: Australian book review. No. 165, Oct 1994, p. 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==

The CD-ROM was made available after the launch of the book version in 1994. It was criticized for user-unfriendliness due to the lack of hypertext links. Important details, such as the passing of the ''[[Native Title Act 1993]]'', were missing from the CD-FOM, as of 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, David and Keefe, Kevin.

An '''Esperanto club''' ({{lang-eo|Esperanto-klubo}}) is a [[Club (organization)|club]] of [[Esperanto]] speakers, or [[Esperantist]]s. In contrast to national or international [[List of Esperanto organizations|Esperanto organizations]], an Esperanto club usually limits its activities only to a certain city or region. Esperanto clubs have been forming the backbone of the [[Esperanto movement]] since the beginning of the movement, although recently the situation is starting to change due to the possibility of immediate and first-hand communication that is provided by the [[Internet]].

The first Esperanto club was founded in [[Nuremberg]] on 18 February 1885, before Esperanto was published (1887)&amp;nbsp;– originally it was a group of supporters of [[Volapük]], who in 1888 unanimously converted to Esperanto, under the influence of [[Leopold Einstein]]. The Nuremberg club was also the first to start publishing an [[List of Esperanto magazines|Esperanto magazine]], ''[[La Esperantisto]]''.

== Characteristics ==
Esperanto clubs may differ in a variety of ways:
* Existence of a permanent meeting place;
* Regularity and variety of activities;
* Solid member base (and collection of membership fees);
* Specialization in a certain level of Esperanto knowledge;
* Specific interest in a topic behind Esperanto itself (e.g. Esperanto [[teacher]]s club, [[student]]s club, club of Esperanto-speaking [[paramedic]]s, club linked to a science center etc.);
* Relation to a national Esperanto organization (usually the local branch of the [[Universal Esperanto Association]]);
* Regular organization of Esperanto language courses.

=== List of first Esperanto clubs ===
Following is a list of Esperanto clubs founded between 1887 and 1895, i.e. during the first nine years of Esperanto's existence (names of the founders are given in brackets):&lt;ref&gt;Zakrzweski, Adam: ''Historio de Esperanto''. 1913, 144 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1888
** [[Nuremberg]] (Christian Schmidt)
* 1889
** [[Moscow]]
** [[Sofia]] (Bogdanov)
* 1890
** [[Gelsenkirchen|Schalke]] (Trompeter)
** [[Ivanovo|Ivanovo-Voznesensk]] ([[Antoni Grabowski]])
* 1891
** [[Munich]] - "Societo E-isto-ja" = Internacia Klubo de Korespondado (L. E. Meyer of Nuremberg)
** [[Uppsala]] (S. Lundström)
** [[Murom]] (W. Brzozowski)
** [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] (dr. Haas)
** [[Saint Petersburg]] (Art. Florell)
* 1892
** [[Málaga]]
** [[Gothenburg]] (G. Backman)
** [[Osterby, Rendsburg-Eckernförde|Osterby]] (Ossian Holmquist)
** [[Erlangen]] (Fr. v. Brtesen)
** [[Schweinfurt]] (P. Kramer, Kirschner, Brand)
** [[Vilnius]] (A. Naumann)
* 1893
** [[Warsaw]] (Al. Blumental, Rubin, J. Wasniewski)
* 1894
** [[Steneby]] (Lindgven)
** [[Odessa]] (Gernet, Borovko)
** [[Reims]]-Soissons (Huisson)
** [[Helsinki]] (W. Fagershom)
* 1895
** [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] (V. Solodiĥin)

However, at the end of 1904, only three of these clubs were still in existence: Uppsala, Saint Petersburg, and Odessa. Other clubs often did not survive more than a year, as it was the case of the group in Reims, which was formed by young students of the local [[lyceum]].

==History==

[[File:The Ex and Melaku Belay.jpg|thumb|left|Melaku Belay onstage with [[The Ex (band)|The Ex]] in 2008]]
Born in 1980 in Ethiopia, Melaku Belay lived as an orphan on the streets of Addis Ababa.&lt;ref name="Unthank, 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Unthank|first1=Rachel|title=Folk: Ethiopia|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/folk/2010/02/ethiopia-by-rachel-unthank-par-1.html#more|accessdate=13 December 2016|agency=BBC|date=24 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child Belay earned a living shining shoes&lt;ref name="Niederndorfer, 2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Niederndorfer |first1=Florian |title=Ein Jazzclub steht dem Plan im Weg |url=https://www.pressreader.com/austria/der-standard/20180801/281616716175901 |accessdate=4 October 2018 |work=Der Standard |date=August 1, 2018 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; and taught himself to dance through participation in folk traditions and religious festivals.&lt;ref name="Kennedy Center bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fendika: Biography|url=https://www.kennedy-center.org/Artist/B75269|website=Kennedy Center|accessdate=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked for seven years as a dancer for tips in Addis Ababa's Kazanchis neighborhood at a local ''azmari bet''—a tavern that hosts [[azmari]] story-songsters who accompany themselves on the [[masenko]] (a one-stringed [[violin]]) or [[krar]] (a type of [[lyre]]).&lt;ref name="Britannica: azmari"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Halfpenny|first1=Eric|last2=Grame|first2=Theodore C|title=azmari: Ethiopian bard|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/azmari/article-websites|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each night after work, the young Melaku slept under the bar and eventually saved enough money to buy the club, Fendika Azmari Bet, from its owners.&lt;ref name="Unthank, 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Doyle, 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doyle|first1=Rachel B.|title=In Ethiopia’s Capital, a Resurgent Jazz Scene|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/travel/in-ethiopias-capital-a-resurgent-jazz-scene.html?_r=0|accessdate=13 December 2016|work=The New York Times|date=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When not working at the azmari bet, Melaku traveled extensively through [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Somalia]], and [[South Sudan]] to learn as many dances as he could from more than 80 tribes around the [[Horn of Africa]],&lt;ref name="Forster, 2010"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Forster|first1=Siegfried|title=L’art et l’audace des " Regards sur l’Ethiopie " – RFI|url=http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20100722-art-audace-regards-ethiopie|website=RFI Afrique|accessdate=14 December 2016|language=fr-FR|date=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the traditions of [[Gurage]], [[Welayta people#Wolayta music|Wolaita]], [[Tigrayans#Language and culture|Tigray]], [[Wollo]], [[Konso]], [[Gonder]], and [[Gojam]],&lt;ref name="Earth Beat"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fendika|url=http://earthbeat.nl/fendika/|website=Earth Beat|accessdate=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as dances from Somali and Afar regions.&lt;ref name="Matatu, 2018"&gt;{{cite news |title=Melaku Belay &amp; Fendika |url=http://www.matatu.co/routes/melaku-belay-fendika |accessdate=3 October 2018 |work=MATATU: Nomadic Cinema}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melaku also became a nationally celebrated artist in ''[[eskesta]]'', a shoulder dance style whose movements share roots with [[hip hop]]'s traditions of [[locking (dance)|locking]] and [[popping]].&lt;ref name="Cadenza, 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New Yorker"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fendika|url=http://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/dance/fendika|accessdate=13 December 2016|work=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With Ethiopia's capital city being a nexus of culture, music, and dance from other nations, Melaku incorporated these into his repertoire as well, gradually assembling a 13-piece ensemble called the Ethiocolor Cultural Band.&lt;ref name="Addis Zefen, 2014"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethiocolor releases debut album|url=http://www.addiszefen.com/news/ethiocolor-releases-debut-album/|website=Addis Zefen|accessdate=14 December 2016|date=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combining tribal dances and folk instruments with jazz, rock, theater and elaborate costumes.&lt;ref name="Ex, 2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Birabiro by Fendika|url=http://exmailorder.nl/shop/birabiro-lp|website=exmailorder.nl|publisher=The Ex|accessdate=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group became a staple at Fendika, rooted in the azmari tradition but with amplified versions of its instruments.&lt;ref name="Selam, 2014"&gt;{{cite web|title=Selam Sounds new Release: Ethiocolor|url=http://selam.se/eng/news/selam-sounds-new-release-ethiocolor|website=Selam|accessdate=14 December 2016|date=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Melaku assembled a smaller group out of the larger Ethiocolor ensemble, featuring three musicians, two dancers, and one singer. With a more portable acoustic sound and azmari folk aesthetic, the group named themselves Fendika in tribute to the establishment from which they originated.&lt;ref name="Cadenza, 2014"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fendika|url=http://www.cadenzaartists.com/fendika.html|website=Cadenza Artists|accessdate=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the Fendika venue's hosting touring artists from all over the world, the ensemble has established an international network enabling them to travel and collaborate with musicians from around the globe. They have toured the United States and eastern Africa with Boston-area [[Ethiojazz]] orchestra [[Debo Band]], and in 2010 the two groups released a joint live recording from a concert given at the [[Sauti za Busara]] African music festival in [[Zanzibar]].&lt;ref name="Hog Eye Man, 2012"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Man|first1=Hog Eye|title=Interview: Debo Band|url=http://www.tinymixtapes.com/features/danny-mekonnen-of-debo-band|website=Tiny Mix Tapes|accessdate=16 December 2016|date=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fendika has also toured throughout Europe with Dutch [[post-punk]] band [[The Ex (band)|The Ex]] and released records through the band's label.&lt;ref name="Ex, 2016" /&gt; In 2018 Fendika toured Scandinavia in collaboration with Paal Nilssen-Love’s free jazz orchestra Large Unit before embarking on their first U.S. solo tour, performing as headliners to Ethiopia Fest Chicago&lt;ref name="Meyer, 2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Meyer |first1=Bill |title=Fearless song and dance troupe Fendika headlines Ethiopia Fest Chicago 2018 |url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/fearless-song-and-dance-troupe-headlines-ethiopia-fest-chicago-2018/Content?oid=57441770 |accessdate=3 October 2018 |work=Chicago Reader |date=September 8, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Boston's Global Music Fest.&lt;ref name="GMF, 2018"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Music Festival |url=http://www.bu.edu/gmf/ |website=www.bu.edu |publisher=Boston University |accessdate=3 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francien''' is a 19th-century term in [[linguistics]] that was applied to the [[French dialect]] that was spoken in the [[Île-de-France]] region (with [[Paris]] at its centre) before the establishment of the [[French language]] as a [[standard language]].&lt;ref&gt;"Ce terme est une dénomination linguistique du XIXe siècle. En effet, avant on parlait tout simplement de françoys ou de françois (prononcé [frãswè] puis [frãsè])" (French Wikipedia).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one theory of the development of French, Francien was chosen out of all the competing oïl languages as an [[official language]] ([[Norman language|Norman]] and [[Picard language|Picard]] being the main competitors in the medieval period). The theory currently prevailing, however, is that Francien was one of the [[dialects]] in the [[dialect continuum]] on top of which an administrative language, untrammelled by perceived regionalisms, was imposed as a compromise means of communication and record to replace [[Latin]].

The existence and the definition of Francien was put forward in the 19th century, partly to support the idea of the French language as enjoying a direct and pure lineage from Latin and to minimise the contribution of the various [[Romance languages|Romance]] [[languages of France]]. Now, the question of Francien is a controversial topic in discussions of [[language policy in France]].

'''''Fuck''''' is a 2005 American documentary film by director [[Steve Anderson (director)|Steve Anderson]] about the word "[[fuck]]". The film argues that the word is an integral part of societal discussions about [[freedom of speech]] and [[censorship]]. It examines the term from perspectives which include art, linguistics, society and comedy, and begins with a segment from the 1965 propaganda film ''[[Perversion for Profit]]''. Scholars and celebrities analyze perceptions of the word from differing perspectives. Journalist [[Sam Donaldson]] talks about the versatility of the word, and comedian [[Billy Connolly]] states it can be understood despite one's language or location. Musician [[Alanis Morissette]] comments that the word contains power because of its taboo nature. The film features the last recorded interview of author [[Hunter S. Thompson]] before his suicide. Scholars, including linguist [[Reinhold Aman]], journalism analyst [[David Shaw (writer)|David Shaw]] and ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' editor [[Jesse Sheidlower]], explain the history and evolution of the word. Language professor [[Geoffrey Nunberg]] observes that the word's treatment by society reflects changes in our culture during the 20th century.

Anderson was exposed to public conceptions surrounding the word "fuck" by comedian [[George Carlin]]'s monologue "[[Seven dirty words|Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television]]". He named the film ''Fuck'' despite anticipating problems with marketing. Animator [[Bill Plympton]] provided sequences illustrating key concepts in the film. The documentary was first shown at the [[AFI Film Festival]] on November 7, 2005, at [[ArcLight Hollywood]] in [[Hollywood]].

''Fuck'''s reviews were generally mixed. Film critic [[A. O. Scott]] called the documentary a battle between advocates of morality and supporters of freedom of expression. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and the New York ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' criticized its length and other reviewers disliked its repetitiveness&amp;nbsp;– the word "fuck" is used 857&amp;nbsp;times in the film. In his 2009 book ''[[Fuck: Word Taboo and Protecting Our First Amendment Liberties]]'', law professor [[Christopher M. Fairman]] called the movie "the most important film using 'fuck'".&lt;ref name="fairman" /&gt; The [[American Film Institute]] said, "Ultimately, ''Fuck'' is a movie about free speech&amp;nbsp;... Freedom of expression must extend to words that offend. Love it or hate it, fuck is here to stay."&lt;ref name="vincelli" /&gt;

==Soundtrack==
''Fuck'' includes songs with similarly themed titles, including "[[Shut Up and Fuck]]" by American [[hard rock]] band [[Betty Blowtorch]], "Fucking Fucking Fuck" by Splatpattern and "[[I Love to Say Fuck]]" by American [[horror punk]] supergroup [[Murderdolls]]. Journalist Sam Peczek of ''Culture Wars'' compared the film's music to that in [[softcore pornography]], and observed that the soundtrack was broad in scope and helped accentuate the film's content.&lt;ref name="sampeczek" /&gt;

He decided to research the film's topic due to the word's versatility and his interest in language as a writer.&lt;ref name="naughtywordintrigues" /&gt; Early exposure by Anderson to public perception of the word "fuck" came from ''[[Class Clown]]'' by comedian George Carlin, which included his monologue "Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television".&lt;ref name="naughtywordintrigues"&gt;{{cite news|title='Naughty word' intrigues Pittsford grad|date=January 4, 2007|first=Jack|last=Garner|work=[[Democrat and Chronicle]]|location=Rochester, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tucsoncitizen"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Tucson Citizen]]|first=Jack|last=Garner|title=Carlin's list a 'precursor' to new documentary|date=January 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The director explained in an interview that he was fascinated with the word "fuck" because of its different uses. He originally proposed the idea of a film about the word in jest, later realizing that the topic could fuel a documentary.&lt;ref name="jaystonecanwest"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jay ([[CanWest News Service]])|last=Stone|work=[[National Post]]|date=November 28, 2006|title=Defusing The F-bomb: New Doc. Director tackles The Profundity Of Profanity|page=B3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Observer]]'' quoted him as saying that he was entertained by the word "fuck",&lt;ref name="rowanwalker" /&gt; and intrigued with the idea of examining how the word had been incorporated into popular culture.&lt;ref name="rowanwalker" /&gt; He wanted to analyze why some people were offended by its use and others enjoyed it, noting that the word sharpened debate about taboo language in society.&lt;ref name="rowanwalker" /&gt;

Anderson explained to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' the confusing, forbidden nature of the word "fuck" in the face of the increased pervasiveness of euphemisms for it.&lt;ref name="zoemak" /&gt; He commented on its taboo nature and demonstrated how it can be indirectly referred to, so youth understand the reference without using the word itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20040427&amp;slug=cursing27|title=Flush that potty mouth with popular euphemisms|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|first=Lynn ([[Los Angeles Times]])|last=Smith|date=April 27, 2004|page=C1; Edition: Fourth; Section: Northwest Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'', Anderson said that film directors should fight against censorship, because it can block their true message.&lt;ref name="zoemak" /&gt;

The director told CanWest News Service that he hoped the documentary would provoke a wider discussion about freedom of speech, [[sexual slang]] and its media use. Anderson questioned whether the word should be used on ''[[NYPD Blue]]'', and how parents should discuss its use with their children. He emphasized that artists and filmmakers should be free to express their views without censorship, deferring to public opinion on the appropriateness of his documentary's title.&lt;ref name="jaystonecanwest" /&gt;

Anderson stated in an interview with [[IndieWire]] that freedom of speech was not guaranteed, but a concept requiring discussion and monitoring so it is not lost. He classified the word "fuck" as being at the core of discussion about freedom of speech. He acknowledged that there are terms considered by society more vulgar than "fuck", but said that this particular word creates controversy and dialogue.&lt;ref name="indiewire"&gt;{{cite news|date=November 9, 2006|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/indiewire_interview_steve_anderson_director_of_fuck2|accessdate=April 23, 2013|title=indieWIRE Interview: Steve Anderson, director of 'Fuck'|author=IndieWire staff|work=[[IndieWire]]|quote=From the very beginning we didn't know what we were going to call it.

In the end, after much discussion and many alternate titles, we decided to simply call if "Fuck." It was the honest thing to do.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson said that its title alone distinguished his documentary from others, in terms of promotional difficulty. During production, ''Fuck'' was known as ''The Untitled F-Word Film''.&lt;ref name="indiewire" /&gt;

==={{anchor|Title choice and marketing}}Title and marketing===
[[File:Fuck film interview grid.tif|thumb|Steve Anderson said that the title of his film was ''Fuck'', but he allowed marketing designs with an asterisk.&lt;ref name="fairman" /&gt;|alt=Fuck with asterisk instead of letter U, with background of tiled images of interviewees from film]]
In an interview about the film on his website, Anderson discussed problems he encountered in naming his film ''Fuck'' instead of a censored version of the word. Anderson always wanted to call it ''Fuck'', because it succinctly described the film's contents.&lt;ref name="fairman" /&gt;{{efn|''Fuck'' is styled as ''FUCK'', ''F★CK'', or ''F*CK''&lt;ref name="baumgarten" /&gt;&lt;ref name="financialtimes" /&gt; and alternatively referred to as ''Fuck: A Documentary'' and ''The F-Bomb: A Documentary''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dvd.netflix.com/Movie/The-F-Bomb-A-Documentary/70058003|accessdate=June 8, 2013|year=2013|work=[[Netflix]]|title=The F-Bomb: A Documentary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_f_bomb_a_documentary/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027150801/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_f_bomb_a_documentary/|archivedate=October 27, 2013|accessdate=June 8, 2013|year=2013|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|title=The F-bomb: A Documentary}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} There were inherent problems with this approach, including an inability to advertise the true title in mainstream media such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''Los Angeles Times'' (they used four asterisks instead), although the real title might be permitted in [[alternative newspaper]]s such as ''[[LA Weekly]]''.&lt;ref name="fairman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jaystonecanwest" /&gt; Anderson also anticipated problems displaying the film's title during film festivals on theatre [[Marquee (sign)|marquees]].&lt;ref name="fairman" /&gt;

Anderson explained that although the title of his documentary was ''Fuck'', he allowed alternate designations using an asterisk. The film and content he controlled would refer to the title as ''Fuck'', including theatrical and DVD editions. He concluded that his struggle reflected the debate alluded to by the documentary, and this realization motivated him to stand firm on the film's title.&lt;ref name="fairman" /&gt; Because the film is about how a taboo word can impact culture, it was important to keep ''Fuck'' as its title.&lt;ref name="couldoscar"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|title=Could Oscar be a four-letter word?|date=March 27, 2006|page=1; Section: The Globe Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rainstorm Entertainment]] was confirmed in November 2003 to produce and finance the documentary, with production scheduled to begin in January 2004.&lt;ref name="rainstormswears"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rainstorm swears by doc|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=November 10, 2003|page=27|first=Dana|last=Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was completed in 2005 by Anderson's company, Mudflap Films, and produced by Rainstorm Entertainment co-founders Steven Kaplan and Gregg Daniel,&lt;ref name="ianmohr" /&gt; and Bruce Leiserowitz, Jory Weitz and Richard Ardi.&lt;ref name="daringdocu" /&gt; Financial assistance was provided by Bad Apple Films of [[Spokane, Washington]].&lt;ref name="indiewire" /&gt;

[[File:Hunter S. Thompson in Fuck film.jpg|thumb|The documentary featured the last interview with author [[Hunter S. Thompson]] before his suicide and honored Thompson's contributions to journalism.|alt=Hunter S. Thompson]]
Thirty-five media commentators were interviewed for the film.&lt;ref name="stamets" /&gt;&lt;ref name="charlesbritton" /&gt; Jory Weitz helped obtain interviews; he had cast Anderson's previous film, ''The Big Empty'', and had industry credibility as executive producer of ''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]''.&lt;ref name="indiewire" /&gt; Anderson said he intended to select interviewees with a variety of perspectives, conservative as well as liberal. He described how, as confirmations of interview subjects came in, he was surprised when Pat Boone was among the first to confirm his participation. Anderson had previously worked as a cameraman on a piece with Boone about eight years before starting work on ''Fuck''. After confirming Boone, Bill Maher and Janeane Garofalo on ''Fuck'', it became easier for Anderson to confirm other interviewees. The film included the final video interview with Hunter S. Thompson before his suicide, and Anderson dedicated it to Thompson for his contributions to journalism.&lt;ref name="rebeccabachman" /&gt;

===Impact===
''Fuck'' has been a resource for several university courses.{{efn|The film was recommended as a resource to students by Dr. Richard Stepp in his Fall 2007 course "Ethnographic and Documentary Film" at the [[University of Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Stepp|title=Ethnographic and Documentary Film|date=Fall 2007|publisher=University of Florida|work=ANT 4930|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn|See additional research by Miriam Sobre-Denton of [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]] and Jana Simonis published in the [[academic journal]] ''Communication Teacher''.&lt;ref name="sobredenton" /&gt;}} Christopher M.

In an interview with the ''Santa Barbara Independent'', Anderson said that a schoolteacher in Philadelphia had been fired for showing the documentary to his students.&lt;ref name="rebeccabachman" /&gt; The teacher had researched the documentary, and wanted to teach his students the history of the word because of its frequent use in his class.&lt;ref name="rebeccabachman" /&gt; Anderson said it was not the use of the word "fuck" in the film that cost the teacher his job, but a 38-second scene from a ''[[Fuck for Forest]]'' concert in Europe where a couple engaged in sexual intercourse onstage as environmental advocacy.&lt;ref name="rebeccabachman" /&gt; The teacher showed the DVD to his 11th-grade journalism class at [[William Penn High School (Philadelphia)|William Penn High School]] without previewing it or sending [[permission slip]]s home to parents.&lt;ref name="90minutelapse"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jill|last=Porter|title=The 90-minute lapse that killed a 19-year career: Showing a DVD about the F-Word in class was a mistake&amp;nbsp;...

''Fuck'' was featured in a 2012 analysis in the academic journal ''Communication Teacher'', "Do You Talk to Your Teacher with That Mouth? ''F*ck: A Documentary'' and Profanity as a Teaching Tool in the Communication Classroom", by Miriam Sobre-Denton of [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]] and Jana Simonis. Sobre-Denton and Simonis discussed the documentary's use for [[communication studies]] students studying university-level [[intercultural relations]]. Their research incorporated interviews with Steve Anderson, students and data from [[Postgraduate education|graduate-level]] classes in language and culture. Sobre-Denton and Simonis' conclusions correlated [[taboo word]]s with social forms of power, [[rebellion|rebelliousness]], [[professional]]ism and [[gender role]]s.&lt;ref name="sobredenton"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Communication Teacher|title=Do You Talk to Your Teacher with That Mouth?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3086">A '''gang patch''' is a term used in [[New Zealand]] to refer to the identifying insignia of a [[street gang]]. They have been linked to intimidation of members of the public by gang members.

Each of the country's gangs has its own forms of insignia, of which the most prominent is often a large symbol, frequently worn by members on their clothing as a symbol of their gang membership. The patch is often seen as being as important to gang members as a military flag is to members of an army group, and any insult to the patch is taken as being an insult to the gang as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/wellington/2414597/Gang-patch-not-worth-it-judge |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131130211747/http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/wellington/2414597/Gang-patch-not-worth-it-judge |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 November 2013 |title=Gang patch not worth it - judge |date=15 May 2009 |publisher=Dominion Post |accessdate=2009-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, the term has a more general meaning.  Being a "patched" member of a gang is to be a fully initiated member of the gang and often a ranking member of the gang's structure. The physical patches are highly valued and have been used with some success in negotiations.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_2421472"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/2421472/Gang-to-get-killers-Mob-patch-back |title=Gang to get killer's Mob patch back |date=19 May 2009 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legality ==
[[Wanganui]] District Council has banned the wearing of gang patches within parts of their jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/politics-news/mayor-welcomes-gang-patch-ban-2713357 |title=New weapon in fight against gangs |date=7 May 2009 |publisher=TVNZ |accessdate=2009-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509075344/http://tvnz.co.nz/politics-news/mayor-welcomes-gang-patch-ban-2713357 |archivedate=2009-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odt.co.nz/news/national/55142/gang-patch-ban-will-go-nationwide-laws|title=Gang patch ban will go nationwide: Laws|date=10 May 2009|publisher=Otago Daily Times|accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban was tested by judicial review in a hearing before Clifford J in November 2010.

'''''Grey Goo''''' is a [[science fiction]] [[real-time strategy]] video game [[video game developer|developed]] by [[Petroglyph Games]], produced by Six Foot, and [[video game publisher|published]] by Grey Box on January 23, 2015&lt;ref name=releasedate /&gt; for [[Microsoft Windows]].&lt;ref name=FAQ /&gt; It features a playable faction based on the [[grey goo]] scenario.

==Gameplay==
In ''Grey Goo'' players can choose one of three playable factions, the Humans, the Beta, or the Goo,&lt;ref name=GreyGooGameInfo&gt;{{cite web|title=Grey Goo Game Info |url=https://www.greybox.com/greygoo/en/info/ |website=GreyBox.com |accessdate=13 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412165124/https://www.greybox.com/greygoo/en/info/ |archivedate=April 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and use them to complete a [[single-player video game|single-player]] campaign or play in a competitive [[multi-player video game|multiplayer]] [[game mechanics#modes|mode]] [[player versus player|versus other players]]. Each faction features a unique set of units, structures, and play style as well as its own segment of the single-player campaign. The Beta faction relies on speed, mobility, and power to dominate the battle through battle machines and specific units able to mount themselves on "hard-points" for defense. The human faction is well-rounded and highly based on reconfiguration of their base. They possess teleportation technology, able to reconfigure their sentinels and other structures and also transport their units to anywhere on the battlefield.  The Goo faction features the game's namesake, self replicating nanobots that can move around the map consuming enemies and forming themselves into new units. Due to this, they only rely on pure strength and speed to destroy anything in their way. The game bases itself around "macro decisions over micro management" and features a qwert hotkey system for unit control and construction.&lt;ref name=GreyGooReveal&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zacny|first1=Rob|title=Grey Goo exclusive reveal: a throwback RTS that emphasizes macro decisions over micro management|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/grey-goo-preview/|website=PCGamer|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, maps feature terrain obstructing vision similar to games such as ''[[Defense of the Ancients|DotA]]'' and ''[[League of Legends]]''.&lt;ref name=GreyGooRTS-IGN&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hafer|first1=T.J.|title=GREY GOO: AN UNCLEAN RTS (IN A GOOD WAY)|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/15/grey-goo-an-unclean-rts-in-a-good-way|website=IGN|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The story takes place 500 years after humans first ventured outside of the [[Solar System|solar system]]. The Beta (or ''Mora'', as they call themselves), a once-spacefaring culture, has fled with the remainder of their civilization to Ecosystem 9 (which they call ''Falkannan''), the planet the game takes place on, from an unknown threat they call the Silent Ones. During a test firing of the [[wormhole]] they meant to use to return to the stars, they are attacked by enemies coming through the portal, or "Keyhole". These advanced [[Unmanned Combat Vehicle|drone]] units are first suspected to belong to the Silent Ones but are later revealed to be human in origin. As the conflict between the Beta settlers, led by Aran (Commander) Saruk, and the human forces intensifies, an explosion in orbit scatters wreckage all over their colony, from which the [[Grey goo|Goo]] emerge and attack both sides.

After a long history of war and exploration in space, during which no intelligent life was found, humans had returned to planet Earth in an attempt to seek peace and stability in a [[Post-scarcity economy|post-scarcity]] society guided by [[Artificial intelligence|AI]]. A signal is detected from the distant planet Ecosystem 9 in the outer [[Scutum–Centaurus Arm|Crux Arm]], and the starship ''LSV Darwin'', captained by Lucy Tak, is sent to investigate. Landing forces are engaged by the Beta (who are designated as such by the humans because their original planet was the "beta candidate" for intelligent life during previous [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|radio telescope surveys]], but subsequent investigation did not receive any more signals — likely a consequence of the Silent Ones' attack) and collect samples from the surface, including Goo, which promptly escapes and destroys the ''Darwin'', reaching the Beta colony site in the re-entering wreckage. Despite their initial conflict, the Beta and the now-stranded humans agree to an alliance to destroy the Goo that threatens them, which is revealed to be part of the artificially intelligent "''Pathfinder''" [[Self-replicating spacecraft|Von Neumann probe]] system sent from Earth centuries prior to chart the galaxy in advance of the human expansion. The probes were believed to have been decommissioned when exploration was abandoned, but presumably the Goo on Ecosystem 9 somehow altered its own programming, becoming self-directing.

After sacrificing himself to destroy what was believed to be the last Goo on the planet, the robotic human commander Singleton's consciousness merges with the Goo. It is revealed that the Goo are attempting not to consume life, but rather to protect it from "the growing shroud of Silence" that is expanding across the [[Milky Way|galaxy]] — the same unknown force that destroyed the Beta civilization. All previous hostile actions were merely attempts to expand in order to effectively defend the planet. With Singleton's assistance, the Goo fights back from the brink of extinction and carves a path to the Beta's Keyhole device in the hope of contacting and reuniting with the scattered Goo across the galaxy, to stand united against the Silence. Singleton attempts to negotiate with the Humans and Beta, but the Goo is forced to destroy the opposing armies. Defeated, Saruk, Tak and others who were spared watch as countless Goo masses emerge from Keyholes across the planet. In an after-credits scene it is hinted that the "growing silence" has discovered Ecosystem 9.

''[[Hardcore Gamer]]'' gave the game a 4 out of 5, stating: "''Grey Goo'' is a stand-out RTS that has found an expert way of blending old with new to create something familiar but fresh.

Just in this case, the production values have been ramped up, and it hates you just a little bit more".&lt;ref name="HonestGamers review" /&gt; GameWatcher scored it 8.0, saying that Grey Goo is "probably Petroglyph’s best game (especially if you’re not a Star Wars fan), it won’t steal the RTS crown from Blizzard or Creative Assembly but if you want a straight fun strategy you won’t regret being absorbed by Grey Goo".&lt;ref name="GameWatcher review" /&gt;

{{Haitian Vodou}}

[[Haitian Vodou]] is a [[syncretism|syncretic mixture]] of [[Roman Catholic]] rituals developed during the [[French colonial empire|French colonial period]], based on [[Traditional African religion|traditional African beliefs]], with roots in [[Dahomey mythology|Dahomey]], [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]] and [[Yoruba mythology|Yoruba]] traditions, and folkloric influence from the indigenous [[Taíno people|Taino]] peoples of [[Haiti]]. The [[Loa]], or spirits with whom Vodouisants work and practice, are not gods but servants of the Supreme Creator Bondye (pronounced Bon Dieu). In keeping with the French-Catholic influence of the faith, vodousaints are for the most part monotheists, believing that the Loa are great and powerful forces in the world with whom humans interact and vice versa, resulting in a symbiotic relationship intended to bring both humans and the Loa back to Bondye. "Vodou is a religious practice, a faith that points toward an intimate knowledge of God, and offers its practitioners a means to come into communion with the Divine, through an ever evolving paradigm of dance, song and prayers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vye Zo Komande LaMenfo|first=Mambo|title=Serving the Spirits: The Religion of Vodou|year=2011|publisher=Mambo Vye Zo Komande LaMenfo|location=United States|isbn= 978-0615535241|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hanazuki: Full of Treasures''''' is an American [[Animated series|animated]] children's [[web show]] produced by [[Titmouse, Inc.]] for [[Hasbro Studios]], with Stephen Davis of Hasbro Studios and [[Chris Prynoski]] of Titmouse serving as executive producers. Made in conjunction with a line of ''Hanazuki'' toys, it is based on characters and concepts which were developed by Hanneke Metselaar and Niko Stumpo before [[Hasbro]] purchased them in 2010. Set in a fictional galaxy comprising countless moons, the series follows Hanazuki, a childlike being called a Moonflower who uses her emotion-based powers to protect her home from being obliterated by a dark force known as the "Big Bad".

The series debuted on [[YouTube]] on January 12, 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2017/01/hasbro-studios-launches-first-animated-digital-series-hanazuki-full-of-treasures|title=Hasbro Studios launches first animated digital series Hanazuki Full of Treasures|first=Gary|last=Collinson|work=Flickering Myth|date=January 12, 2017|accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was produced in conjunction with a line of merchandise to be released later the same year, including a toyline and digital app.&lt;ref name="press"&gt;{{cite press release|date=January 12, 2017|title=Hasbro Invites You to Discover a New World Full of Treasures with HANAZUKI|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170112005150/en/Hasbro-Invites-Discover-World-Full-Treasures-HANAZUKI|location=Pawtucket, Rhode Island|publisher=Hasbro|agency=Business Wire|accessdate=May 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The web series received praise from critics, drawing favorable comparisons to other animated series such as ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]'' and ''[[Steven Universe]]'' for its storytelling, visual aesthetic, and darker undertones.&lt;ref name="mlp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bsckids"/&gt;&lt;ref name="idt"/&gt; As of May 2017, the series has amassed over 120 million views.&lt;ref name="s2"/&gt; It has been renewed for a second season, which will premiere in 2018.&lt;ref name="s2"/&gt; A third season and a feature-length film are also in development.&lt;ref name="movie"/&gt;

''Hanazuki'' began airing on [[Discovery Family]] on December 1, 2018, marking its American televised debut.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/kemo5791/status/1061490964819206144|title=Kamal Walker on Twitter|website=Twitter|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==
The series is set in a fictional galaxy of moons that is beset by the "Big Bad", a black, inky miasma that drains the life and color of anything it touches. Each moon is protected by a Moonflower, a plantlike child who uses his or her emotional states to activate magical "treasures" that are supplied by an infantile being named Little Dreamer, which can then be planted to grow trees that ward off the Big Bad. The series opens with Hanazuki, a newly born Moonflower, arriving on a moon populated by numerous denizens, including colorful rabbit-like creatures called Hemka. Several episodes focus on Hanazuki and her friends' escapades as she learns about her responsibilities and emotions, ending with her growing a colored Treasure Tree that corresponds with her mood in that episode. As the series progresses, Hanazuki encounters other Moonflowers that have failed at saving their own moons and seek to learn from Hanazuki in order to properly harness their powers against the Big Bad.&lt;ref name="animag"/&gt;

==Characters==
===Moonflowers===
Moonflowers are childlike beings who are guardians of the galaxy's moons. Created by Little Dreamer, they have white flowers on their heads and highlights that change color depending on their moods, enabling them to grow Treasure Trees that protect their moons from the Big Bad.

* '''Hanazuki''' ([[Jessica DiCicco]]) – The main character of the series. A newly born Moonflower, Hanazuki is a kind, friendly, and optimistic girl who always offers help to those who need it. She is quick to adapt to her role as her moon's guardian, allowing her to understand and control her own emotions more successfully than most other Moonflowers. 
* '''Kiazuki''' ([[Cassandra Lee Morris]]) – An older, cynical Moonflower who lives on a moon ravaged by the Big Bad. Although claiming to be more experienced than Hanazuki, Kiazuki has failed to ever grow a colored Treasure Tree of her own, and envies Hanazuki's success. She thus manipulates Hanazuki, who admires her as her "Moonflower sister", into helping her acquire treasures to restore her moon. She is later revealed to be the founder of the Garlandians, a failed emergency response team devised to combat the Big Bad.
* '''Kiyoshi''' (Vargus Mason) – A male Moonflower who protects a moon inhabited by unicorns. Because of his pessimistic nature, he is only able to grow black Treasure Trees, which are ineffective in warding off the Big Bad. Deposed and exiled for his failures, Kiyoshi receives guidance from Hanazuki to properly harness his emotional powers, eventually regaining authority of his moon.
* '''Maroshi''' ([[Marcus Toji]]) – A Moonflower from an ocean-covered world that is frozen and shattered by the Big Bad. Despite losing his home, he maintains a positive, laid-back attitude at all times, which makes him easy for others to get along with, but also appearing somewhat irresponsible. He is talented at flying through space on a [[surfboard]]-like device.&lt;!--
* '''Miyumi''' (Elise Dubois) --&gt;

===Hemka===
The Hemka (or Hemkas) are small, rabbit-like creatures that inhabit Hanazuki's moon. They speak in gibberish that others except Hanazuki can fully understand, and they have malleable bodies that allow them to merge and change into different objects. Each Hemka is of a different color and represents a specific personality trait that Hanazuki reflects.

* '''Red Hemka''' ([[Colleen Villard]]) – A feisty Hemka prone to picking fights and pulling pranks on others.
* '''Orange Hemka''' ([[Michael Sinterniklaas]]) – A wacky Hemka who often jumps around and makes silly faces.
* '''Yellow Hemka''' (Colleen Villard) – A happy Hemka who enjoys playing and remains optimistic in dangerous situations.
* '''Lime Green Hemka''' (Jessica DiCicco) – A scared Hemka who is easily startled by anything.
* '''Dark Green Hemka''' (Michael Sinterniklaas) – A mellow Hemka who speaks with a laid-back tone.
* '''Teal Hemka''' (Michael Sinterniklaas in season 1, Cassandra Lee Morris in the shorts) – A glamorous Hemka.
* '''Blue Hemka''' (Jessica DiCicco) – A sad Hemka who is constantly crying or on the verge of tears.
* '''Lavender Hemka''' (Michael Sinterniklaas) – An inspired Hemka who has creative ideas but is too shy to act on them.
* '''Purple Hemka''' (Michael Sinterniklaas) – A courageous Hemka who performs feats of derring-do.
* '''Pink Hemka''' (Michael Sinterniklaas) – A loving Hemka who shows affection for everything.
* '''Raspberry Hemka''' (Cassandra Lee Morris)
* '''Emerald Hemka''' ([[Avery Waddell]])

===Unicorns===
[[Unicorn|Unicorns]] in the series are native to Kiyoshi's moon. They possess the same colors and personality traits as the Hemka, with the additional ability to perform [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] using their horns. Most unicorns in the series are voiced by [[Debi Derryberry]].

* '''Sleepy Unicorn''' (Avery Waddell) – A unicorn who lives on Hanazuki's moon and, as his name suggests, spends most of his time sleeping. Despite his relaxed and lazy nature, he harbors a troubled past; originally named Noble Unicorn, he lives in exile from his home moon after failing to stop his brother Twisted Unicorn's revolt against Kiyoshi. Convinced that he is unfit to wield magic because of his failure, Sleepy regains his confidence to use his powers again to help Hanazuki.
* '''Twisted Unicorn''' (Avery Waddell) – Sleepy Unicorn's brother and the leader of the unicorns. Twisted is a tyrant responsible for overthrowing Kiyoshi, forcing his fellow unicorns to maintain a force field he professes will protect their moon from the Big Bad. He is eventually deposed by the combined efforts of Hanazuki, Kiyoshi, and their allies, leading Twisted to hunt them across the galaxy for revenge.

===Others===
* '''Little Dreamer''' (Colleen Villard) – Hanazuki's infant-like creator who delivers treasures to the Moonflowers. He is shown sleeping at all times and wearing different-patterned pajamas almost every time he appears.
* '''Dazzlessence Jones''' (Avery Waddell) – The self-appointed [[sheriff]] of Hanazuki's moon who resembles a [[Diamond (gemstone)|diamond]]. He helps Hanazuki maintain order, and speaks verbose words through song.
* '''Zikoro''' (Avery Waddell) – Kiazuki's sole companion on her moon, a black creature who behaves like a restless dog. He is regularly mistreated by Kiazuki, but remains loyal to her and enjoys tormenting the Hemka. After Kiazuki abandons him on Hanazuki's moon, he takes more of a liking to Hanazuki and her friends.
* '''Chicken Plant''' (Alison Martin) – A grouchy plant with the resemblance of a chicken that constantly tries eating the Hemka. She is prone to laying eggs that hatch into destructive monsters.
* '''Mirror Plant''' (Shondalia White) – A plant that translates an individual's thoughts and repeats what the subject says.
* '''Mazzadril''' (Michael Sinterniklaas) – One-eyed, four-legged beasts with horns on their heads and tentacles for mouths. Their natural habitat is the dark side of both Hanazuki's moon and Kiazuki's moon.
* '''Doughy Bunington''' ([[Pat Fraley]]) – A friendly [[gourmand]] hotdog who lives on the dark side of the moon, exiled there after thoughtlessly devouring Chicken Plant's wings.
* '''Basil Ganglia''' ([[Trevor Devall]]) – An egocentric, megalomaniacal brain who inhabits a cave on the moon's dark side. He has designs to take over Hanazuki's moon, but is helpless to carry them out due to his lack of other body parts.
* '''Flochi''' ([[Nika Futterman]]) – The creatures that inhabit Maroshi's moon, resembling fish with catlike faces. They glide across any surface in unison, with the exception of a lavender Flochi aptly named Wanderer for her more independent nature.&lt;!--

Little Dreamer, Hanazuki's creator, delivers her a popsicle-shaped treasure that is promptly stolen by the Hemkas, particularly Red Hemka, who wants to use it to repair his damaged house. Hanazuki agrees to assist Red, but her anger erupts when he and the other Hemkas continue fighting over the treasure, causing her to turn red. After the Hemkas put their fight aside fight to help her, the treasure reacts to Hanazuki's change in mood and sprouts into a red Treasure Tree, which keeps an encroaching black miasma away from the moon.

The other Hemkas take him to Sleepy Unicorn, whom they believe can restore Blue using his magical powers. However, Sleepy refuses to help due to a disastrous past experience with magic. Hanazuki becomes brokenhearted, turning blue, and futilely attempts to use magic herself to rescue Blue when he is blown away by the wind. Inspired by Hanazuki's resolve to fix her mistake, Sleepy musters the courage to save Blue and return him to normal. Blue celebrates his restoration by planting a blue Treasure Tree for Hanazuki.

==Reception==
''Hanazuki: Full of Treasures'' was met with critical praise and online popularity upon release, with several favorably comparing it to the television series ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]'' (another Hasbro property) and ''[[Steven Universe]]'' for its light-hearted tone, visual aesthetic, and methodical storytelling.&lt;ref name="mlp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bsckids"/&gt;&lt;ref name="idt"/&gt; As of May 2017, the series has accumulated over 120 million views on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="s2"/&gt;

In her review of the web series, Lauren Orsini of ''[[Forbes]]'' commented on the involvement of ''Friendship Is Magic'' writer [[Dave Polsky]] as a story editor, considering ''Friendship Is Magic'' to be lucrative to Hasbro's success, and concluding that the series was an attempt by the company to incite similar success with ''Hanazuki''.&lt;ref name="mlp"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Orsini|first1=Lauren|title=Hasbro's 'Hanazuki': An Intergalactic Love Letter To 'My Little Pony' Fans|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurenorsini/2017/01/13/hasbros-hanazuki-an-intergalactic-love-letter-to-my-little-pony-fans/#32b130e522a8|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=May 9, 2017|date=January 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later article, Orsini attributed the series' popularity on YouTube to its "spunky characters and high production values".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Orsini|first1=Lauren|title=Take A First Look At The Next Wave Of 'Hanazuki: Full Of Treasures'|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurenorsini/2017/03/09/an-exclusive-first-look-at-the-next-wave-of-hanazuki-full-of-treasures/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=May 9, 2017|date=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercedes Milligan of ''[[Animation Magazine]]'' said of the series, "''Hanazuki'' puts a modern, cross-platform spin on a premise that will be familiar to '80s kids who grew up with Rainbow Brite, et al."&lt;ref name="animag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/top-stories/hasbros-hanazuki-is-a-new-digital-treasure/|title=Hasbro’s ‘Hanazuki’ Is a New Digital Treasure|first=Mercedes|last=Milligan|work=Animation Magazine|date=January 12, 2017|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ella Anders of BSC Kids praised the opening episodes for its setting, lore, characters, and overarching storytelling. She additionally interpreted the series as a Western [[magical girl]] series that "doesn't play off the traditional magical girl path or tropes".&lt;ref name="bsckids"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anders|first1=Ella|title=First Look and Review of Hasbro’s Newest Series "Hanazuki Full of Treasures"|url=http://www.bsckids.com/2017/01/first-look-and-review-of-hasbros-newest-series-hanazuki-full-of-treasures/|website=BSC Kids|accessdate=May 9, 2017|date=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nathalie Medina of ''[[IBT Media|iDigitalTimes]]'' gave the series a score of 4 out of 5, complimenting the characters and hints of a more complex underlying story, and comparing its visual style to "a Lisa Frank folder with a 2000s aesthetic".&lt;ref name="idt"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Medina|first1=Nathalie|title='Hanazuki Full of Treasures' Review: Hasbro's Newest Addition To 'My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic' Stable Of Girl Toons|url=http://www.idigitaltimes.com/hanazuki-full-treasures-review-hasbros-newest-addition-my-little-pony-friendship-577902|publisher=iDigitalTimes|accessdate=May 9, 2017|date=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Literature}}

The '''history of [[literature]]''' is the historical development of [[writing]]s in [[prose]] or [[poetry]] that attempt to provide [[entertainment]], [[enlightenment (concept)|enlightenment]], or [[Education|instruction]] to the reader/listener/observer, as well as the development of the [[literary technique]]s used in the [[communication]] of these pieces.  Not all writings constitute [[literature]].  Some recorded materials, such as compilations of [[data]] (e.g., a [[check register]]) are not considered literature, and this article relates only to the evolution of the works defined above.

==The beginnings of literature==
{{Main|Early literature}}
{{See also|Sangam literature|Sumerian literature|Ancient Egyptian literature|Babylonian literature}}

Literature and writing, though connected, are not synonymous.  The very first writings from ancient [[Sumer]] by any reasonable definition do not constitute literature—the same is true of some of the early [[Egyptian hieroglyphics]] or the thousands of logs from ancient [[China|Chinese]] regimes.  Scholars have often disagreed concerning when written record-keeping became more like "literature" than anything else; the definition is largely subjective.

Moreover, given the significance of distance as a cultural isolator in earlier centuries, the historical development of literature did not occur at an even pace across the world.  The problems of creating a uniform global history of literature are compounded by the fact that many texts have been lost over the millennia, either deliberately, by accident, or by the total disappearance of the originating culture. Much has been written, for example, about the destruction of the [[Library of Alexandria]] in the 1st century BC, and the innumerable key texts which are believed to have been lost forever to the flames. The deliberate suppression of texts (and often their [[author]]s) by organisations of either a spiritual or a temporal nature further shrouds the subject.
[[Image: GilgameshTablet.jpg|left|thumbnail|A stone tablet containing part of the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]]]]
Certain primary texts, however, may be isolated which have a qualifying role as literature's first stirrings.
Very early examples include ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', in its [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] version predating 2000 BC, and the ''[[Egyptian Book of the Dead]]'' written down in the ''[[Papyrus of Ani]]'' in approximately 1250 BC but probably dates from about the 18th century BC.
Ancient Egyptian literature was not included in early studies of the history of literature because the writings of [[Ancient Egypt]] were not translated into European languages until the 19th century when the [[Rosetta stone]] was deciphered.

Many texts handed down by [[oral tradition]] over several centuries before they were fixed in written form are difficult or impossible to date. The core of the [[Rigveda]] may date to the mid 2nd millennium BC. The [[Pentateuch]] is traditionally dated to the 15th century, although modern scholarship estimates its oldest part to date to the 10th century BC at the earliest.

[[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' date to the 8th century BC and mark the beginning of [[Classical Antiquity]]. They also stand in an oral tradition that stretches back to the late Bronze Age.

[[India]]n [[śruti (scripture)|śruti]] texts post-dating the Rigveda (such as the [[Yajurveda]], the [[Atharvaveda]] and the [[Brahmana]]s), as well as the Hebrew [[Tanakh]] and the mystical collection of poems attributed to [[Lao Tze]], the [[Dao de jing|Tao te Ching]], date to the [[Iron Age]], but their dating is difficult and controversial. The great [[Indian epic poetry|Hindu epics]] were also transmitted orally, likely predating the [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]] period.

==Antiquity==
{{Main|Ancient literature}}

===China===
{{Main|Chinese classics|Classical Chinese poetry}}

The [[Classic of Poetry]] (or [[Shijing]]) is the oldest existing collection of Chinese poetry, comprising 305 works by anonymous authors dating from the 11th to 7th centuries BC.
The [[Chu Ci]] anthology (or [[Songs of Chu]]) is a volume of poems attributed to or considered to be inspired by [[Qu Yuan]]'s verse writing. [[Qu Yuan]] is the first author of verse in China to have his name associated to his work and is also regarded as one of the most prominent figures of Romanticism in Chinese classical literature.

The first great [[author]] on military tactics and strategy was [[Sun Tzu]], whose ''[[The Art of War]]'' remains on the shelves of many modern military officers (and its advice has been applied to the [[corporation|corporate]] world as well).  Philosophy developed far differently in China than in Greece—rather than presenting extended dialogues, the ''[[Analects of Confucius|Analects]]'' of [[Confucius]] and [[Lao Zi]]'s ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' presented sayings and proverbs more directly and [[didactic method|didactically]]. The ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' is composed of a large collection of creative anecdotes, allegories, parables, and fables; a masterpiece of both philosophical and literary skill, it has significantly influenced writers and poets for more than 2000 years from the [[Han dynasty]] to the present.

Among the earliest Chinese works of narrative history, [[Zuo Zhuan]] is a gem of classical Chinese prose. This work and the [[Shiji]] or [[Records of the Grand Historian]], were regarded as the ultimate models by many generations of prose stylists in ancient China.

=== Hebrew Literature ===

The books that constitute the Hebrew Bible developed over roughly a millennium.  The oldest texts seem to come from the eleventh or tenth centuries BCE, whilst most of the other texts are somewhat later. They are edited works, being collections of various sources intricately and carefully woven together.

The [[Authorship of the Old Testament|Old Testament was compiled and edited by various men]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Dead Sea Scrolls: A Very Short Introduction|edition= |last= Lim|first= Timothy H.|year= 2005|publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford|isbn= |page= 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; over a period of centuries, with many scholars concluding that the [[Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|Hebrew canon was solidified]] by about the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Bible: A Very Short Introduction|edition= |last= Riches|first= John|year= 2000|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0192853431|page= 37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Philip R page 50"&gt;Philip R. Davies in ''The Canon Debate'', page 50: "With many other scholars, I conclude that the fixing of a canonical list was almost certainly the achievement of the [[Hasmonean dynasty]]."&lt;/ref&gt;  The works have been subject to various literary evaluations (both secular and religious). [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] wrote: “In the Jewish Old Testament, there are men, things and speeches in so grand a style that Greek and Indian literature have nothing to compare to it. One stands with awe and reverence before these tremendous remnants of what man once was... The taste for the Old Testament is a touchstone of 'greatness' and 'smallness'.”&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond Good and Evil'', translated by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]], New York: Random House, 1966; reprinted in Vintage Books, and as part of ''Basic Writings of Nietzsche'', New York: Modern Library, 2000, 1886 (52)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical antiquity===

====Greek literature====
{{Main|Ancient Greek literature}}

Ancient Greek society placed considerable emphasis upon literature.  Many authors consider the [[Western culture|western]] literary tradition to have begun with the [[epic poetry|epic]] poems ''The [[Iliad]]'' and ''The [[Odyssey]]'', which remain giants in the literary [[western canon|canon]] for their skillful and vivid depictions of war and peace, honor and disgrace, love and hatred.  Notable among later Greek poets was [[Sappho]], who defined, in many ways, [[lyric poetry]] as a genre.

A playwright named [[Aeschylus]] changed [[Western literature]] forever when he introduced the ideas of [[dialogue]] and interacting characters to playwriting.  In doing so, he essentially invented "drama": his ''[[Oresteia]]'' trilogy of plays is seen as his crowning achievement.  Other refiners of playwriting were [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]].  Sophocles is credited with skillfully developing [[irony]] as a literary technique, most famously in his play ''[[Oedipus Rex]]''.  Euripedes, conversely, used plays to challenge societal norms and mores—a hallmark of much of Western literature for the next 2,300 years and beyond—and his works such as ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]'', ''[[The Bacchae]]'' and ''[[The Trojan Women]]'' are still notable for their ability to challenge our perceptions of propriety, gender, and war.  [[Aristophanes]], a comic playwright, defines and shapes the idea of [[comedy]] almost as Aeschylus had shaped [[tragedy]] as an art form—Aristophanes' most famous plays include the ''[[Lysistrata]]'' and ''[[The Frogs]]''.

[[Philosophy]] entered literature in the dialogues of [[Plato]], who converted the give and take of [[Socratic questioning]] into written form.  [[Aristotle]], Plato's student, wrote dozens of works on many scientific disciplines, but his greatest contribution to literature was likely his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', which lays out his understanding of drama, and thereby establishes the first criteria for [[literary criticism]].

The [[New Testament]] is an unusual collection of texts--[[John the Apostle|John]]'s ''[[Book of Revelation]]'', though not the first of its kind, essentially defines [[apocalyptic literature|apocalypse as a literary genre]].

====Latin literature====
{{Main|Latin literature}}

In many respects, the writers of the [[Roman Republic]] and the [[Roman Empire]] chose to avoid innovation in favor of imitating the great Greek authors.  [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', in many ways, emulated Homer's ''Iliad''; [[Plautus]], a comic playwright, followed in the footsteps of Aristophanes; [[Tacitus]]' ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' and ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' follow essentially the same historical approaches that [[Thucydides]] devised (the Christian historian [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] does also, although far more influenced by his religion than either Tacitus or Thucydides had been by Greek and Roman polytheism); [[Ovid]] and his ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' explore the same Greek myths again in new ways.  It can be argued, and has been, that the Roman authors, far from being mindless [[wikt:copycat|copycats]], improved on the [[genre]]s already established by their Greek predecessors. For example, Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'' creates a form which is a clear predecessor of the [[stream of consciousness genre]].  What is undeniable is that the Romans, in comparison with the Greeks, innovate relatively few literary styles of their own.

[[Satire]] is one of the few Roman additions to literature—[[Horace]] was the first to use satire extensively as a tool for argument, and [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]] made it into a weapon.

[[Augustine of Hippo]] and his ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'' do for religious literature essentially what Plato had done for philosophy, but Augustine's approach was far less conversational and more didactive.  His ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' is perhaps the first true [[autobiography]], and it gave rise to the genre of [[confessional writing|confessional literature]] which is now more popular than ever.

===India===
{{Further|Tamil literature|Indian literature|Kannada literature|Sanskrit literature}}

Knowledge traditions in India handed down philosophical gleanings and theological concepts through the two traditions of [[Shruti]] and [[Smriti]], meaning ''that which is learnt'' and ''that which is experienced'' - this included the [[Vedas]]. It is generally believed that the [[Puranas]] are the earliest philosophical writings in Indian history, although linguistic works on [[Sanskrit]] existed earlier than 1000 BC. Puranic works such as the  Indian epics: [[Ramayana]] and ''[[Mahabharata]]'', have influenced countless other works, including Balinese [[Kecak]] and other performances such as shadow puppetry ([[wayang]]), and many European works. [[Pali]] literature has an important position in the rise of [[Buddhism]]. [[Classical Sanskrit literature]] flowers in the [[Maurya period|Maurya]] and [[Gupta period]]s, roughly spanning the 2nd century BC to the 8th century AD.

==Middle Ages==
{{Main|Medieval literature}}

===Europe===

After the fall of Rome (in roughly 476), many of the literary approaches and styles invented by the Greeks and Romans fell out of favor in Europe.  In the [[millennium]] or so that intervened between Rome's fall and the [[Florentine Renaissance]], [[medieval literature]] focused more and more on faith and faith-related matters, in part because the works written by the Greeks had not been preserved in Europe, and therefore there were few models of classical literature to learn from and move beyond. What little there was became changed and distorted, with new forms beginning to develop from the distortions. Some of these distorted beginnings of new styles can be seen in the literature generally described as [[Matter of Rome]], [[Matter of France]] and [[Matter of Britain]].

Following Rome's fall, [[Islam]]'s spread across [[Asia]] and [[Africa]] brought with it a desire to preserve and build upon the work of the Greeks, especially in literature.  Although much had been lost to the ravages of time (and to catastrophe, as in the burning of the Library of Alexandria), many Greek works remained extant: they were preserved and copied carefully by Muslim scribes.

In Europe [[Hagiography|Hagiographies]], or "lives of the [[List of saints|saints]]", are frequent among early medieval texts.  The writings of [[Bede]]—''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People|Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]''—and others continue the faith-based historical tradition begun by Eusebius in the early 4th century.  Playwriting essentially ceased, except for the [[mystery play]]s and the [[passion play]]s that focused heavily on conveying Christian belief to the common people. Around 400 AD the ''Prudenti [[Psychomachia]]'' began the tradition of allegorical tales. Poetry flourished, however, in the hands of the [[troubadour]]s, whose courtly romances and ''[[chanson de geste]]'' amused and entertained the upper classes who were their patrons. [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] wrote works which he claimed were histories of Britain. These were highly fanciful and included stories of [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]] the magician and [[King Arthur]].  Epic poetry continued to develop with the addition of the mythologies of Northern Europe: ''[[Beowulf]]'' and the [[Norse saga]]s have much in common with Homer and Virgil's approaches to war and honor, while poems such as [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' take much different stylistic directions.

In November 1095 - [[Pope Urban II]] preached the [[First Crusade]] at the [[Council of Clermont]]. The crusades would affect everything in Europe and the [[Middle East]] for many years to come and literature would, along with everything else, be transformed by the wars between these two cultures. For instance the image of the [[knight]] would take on a different significance. Also the [[Islamic]] emphasis on scientific investigation and the preservation of the Greek philosophical writings would eventually affect European literature.

Between Augustine and ''The Bible'', religious authors had numerous aspects of [[Christianity]] that needed further explication and interpretation.  [[Thomas Aquinas]], more than any other single person, was able to turn [[theology]] into a kind of science, in part because he was heavily influenced by Aristotle, whose works were returning to Europe in the 13th century.

===Islamic world===
{{See also|Islamic literature}}

[[Image:Ali Baba, by Maxfield Parrish.jpg|right|thumb|"Ali Baba" by [[Maxfield Parrish]].]]

The most well known [[fiction]] from the Islamic world was ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights''), which was a compilation of many earlier folk tales told by the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] Queen [[Scheherazade]]. The epic took form in the 10th century and reached its final form by the 14th century; the number and type of tales have varied from one manuscript to another.&lt;ref name="arabianNights"&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Arabian fantasy", p. 51 {{ISBN|0312198698}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Arabian [[fantasy]] tales were often called "Arabian Nights" when translated into [[English language|English]], regardless of whether they appeared in ''The Book of One Thousand and One Nights'', in any version, and a number of tales are known in Europe as "Arabian Nights" despite existing in no Arabic manuscript.&lt;ref name="arabianNights"/&gt;

This epic has been influential in the West since it was translated in the 18th century, first by [[Antoine Galland]].&lt;ref&gt;[[L. Sprague de Camp]], ''[[Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers]]: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy'', p. 10 {{ISBN|0870540769}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many imitations were written, especially in France.&lt;ref name="arabianNights2"&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Arabian fantasy", p. 52 {{ISBN|0312198698}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various characters from this epic have themselves become cultural icons in Western culture, such as [[Aladdin]], [[Sinbad]] and [[Ali Baba]]. However, no [[medieval]] Arabic source has been traced for [[Aladdin]], which was incorporated into ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]'' by its [[French language|French]] translator, [[Antoine Galland]], who heard it from an Arab [[Christianity in Syria|Syrian Christian]] storyteller from [[Aleppo]]. The popularity of the work may in part be due to greater popular knowledge of history and geography since it was written. This meant that the plausibility of great marvels had to be set at a greater distance of time ("long ago") and place ("far away"). This is a process that continues, and finally culminates in [[fantasy fiction]] having little connection, if any, to actual times and places. A number of elements from [[Arabian mythology]] and [[Persian mythology]] are now common in modern [[fantasy]], such as [[genie]]s, [[bahamut]]s, [[magic carpet]]s, magic lamps, etc.&lt;ref name="arabianNights2"/&gt;  When [[L.

[[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', considered the greatest epic of [[Italian literature]], derived many features of and episodes about the hereafter directly or indirectly from Arabic works on [[Islamic eschatology]]: the ''[[Hadith]]'' and the ''[[Kitab al-Miraj]]'' (translated into Latin in 1264 or shortly before&lt;ref name="Heullant"&gt;I.

The [[Moors]] also had a noticeable influence on the works of [[George Peele]] and [[William Shakespeare]]. Some of their works featured Moorish characters, such as Peele's ''[[The Battle of Alcazar]]'' and Shakespeare's ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' and ''[[Othello]]'', which featured a Moorish [[Othello (character)|Othello]] as its title character. These works are said to have been inspired by several Moorish [[delegation]]s from [[Morocco]] to [[Elizabethan England]] at the beginning of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Professor Nabil Matar (April 2004), ''Shakespeare and the Elizabethan Stage Moor'', [[Sam Wanamaker]] Fellowship Lecture, Shakespeare’s [[Globe Theatre]] ([[cf.]] [[Mayor of London]] (2006), [http://www.london.gov.uk/gla/publications/equalities/muslims-in-london.pdf Muslims in London] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626154647/http://www.london.gov.uk/gla/publications/equalities/muslims-in-london.pdf |date=2008-06-26 }}, pp. 14–15, Greater London Authority)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arabic literature====
{{Main|Arabic literature|Literature of Morocco}}
[[Ibn Tufail]] (Abubacer) and [[Ibn al-Nafis]] (1213–1288) were pioneers of the [[philosophical novel]]. Ibn Tufail wrote the first fictional Arabic [[novel]] ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' (''Philosophus Autodidactus'') as a response to [[al-Ghazali]]'s ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]'', and then Ibn al-Nafis also wrote a novel ''[[Ibn al-Nafis#Theologus Autodidactus|Theologus Autodidactus]]'' as a response to Ibn Tufail's ''Philosophus Autodidactus''. Both of these narratives had [[protagonist]]s (Hayy in ''Philosophus Autodidactus'' and Kamil in ''Theologus Autodidactus'') who were [[Autodidacticism|autodidactic]] [[feral child]]ren living in seclusion on a [[desert island]], both being the earliest examples of a desert island story. However, while Hayy lives alone with animals on the desert island for the rest of the story in ''Philosophus Autodidactus'', the story of Kamil extends beyond the desert island setting in ''Theologus Autodidactus'', developing into the earliest known [[coming of age]] plot and eventually becoming the first example of a [[science fiction]] novel.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Abu Shadi Al-Roubi (1982), "Ibn Al-Nafis as a philosopher", ''Symposium on Ibn al-Nafis'', Second International Conference on Islamic Medicine: Islamic Medical Organization, Kuwait ([[cf.]] [http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html Ibn al-Nafis As a Philosopher] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206072116/http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html |date=2008-02-06 }}, ''Encyclopedia of Islamic World'').&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nahyan A.G.

''Theologus Autodidactus'' deals with various science fiction elements such as [[Abiogenesis|spontaneous generation]], [[futurology]], the [[Eschatology|end of the world and doomsday]], [[resurrection]], and the [[afterlife]]. Rather than giving supernatural or mythological explanations for these events, Ibn al-Nafis attempted to explain these plot elements using the [[Islamic science|scientific knowledge]] of [[Islamic medicine|biology]], [[Islamic astronomy|astronomy]], [[cosmology]] and [[geology]] known in his time. His main purpose behind this science fiction work was to explain [[Islam]]ic religious teachings in terms of [[Islamic science|science]] and [[Early Islamic philosophy|philosophy]] through the use of fiction.&lt;ref name=Roubi&gt;Dr. Abu Shadi Al-Roubi (1982), "Ibn Al-Nafis as a philosopher", ''Symposium on Ibn al Nafis'', Second International Conference on Islamic Medicine: Islamic Medical Organization, Kuwait ([[cf.]] [http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html Ibnul-Nafees As a Philosopher] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206072116/http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html |date=2008-02-06 }}, ''Encyclopedia of Islamic World'').&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Latin]] translation of Ibn Tufail's work, ''Philosophus Autodidactus'', first appeared in 1671, prepared by [[Edward Pococke]] the Younger, followed by an English translation by [[Simon Ockley]] in 1708, as well as [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] translations. These translations later inspired [[Daniel Defoe]] to write ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', a candidate for the title of "[[first novel in English]]".&lt;ref&gt;Nawal Muhammad Hassan (1980), ''Hayy bin Yaqzan and Robinson Crusoe: A study of an early Arabic impact on English literature'', Al-Rashid House for Publication.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Glasse (2001), ''New [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]'', p. 202, Rowman Altamira, {{ISBN|0759101906}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Amber&gt;Amber Haque (2004), "Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists", ''Journal of Religion and Health'' '''43''' (4): 357–77 [369].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wainwright&gt;Martin Wainwright, [http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,918454,00.html Desert island scripts], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 22 March 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Philosophus Autodidactus'' also inspired [[Robert Boyle]] to write his own philosophical novel set on an island, ''The Aspiring Naturalist''.&lt;ref name=Toomer-222&gt;[[G.J.

Among other innovations in Arabic literature was [[Ibn Khaldun]]'s perspective on chronicling past events—by fully rejecting supernatural explanations, Khaldun essentially invented the scientific or sociological approach to history.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

====Persian literature====
{{Main|Persian literature|Pahlavi literature}}

[[Ferdowsi]]'s ''[[Shahnameh]]'', the national epic of [[Iran]], is a mythical and heroic retelling of [[History of Iran|Persian history]]. It is the longest epic poem ever written.

From [[Persian Empire|Persian]] culture the book which would, eventually, become the most famous in the west is  the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]''. The Rubáiyát is a collection of poems by the [[Persian people|Persian]] mathematician and astronomer [[Omar Khayyám]] (1048–1122). "Rubaiyat" means "quatrains": verses of four lines.

''[[Amir Arsalan]]'' was also a popular mythical Persian story, which has influenced some modern works of fantasy fiction, such as ''[[The Heroic Legend of Arslan]]''.

Examples of early Persian proto-[[science fiction]] include [[Al-Farabi]]'s ''Opinions of the residents of a splendid city'' about a [[utopia]]n society, [[Zakariya al-Qazwini|Al-Qazwini]]'s futuristic tale of ''Awaj bin Anfaq'' about a man who travelled to Earth from a distant planet, and elements such as the [[flying carpet]].&lt;ref&gt;Achmed A. W. Khammas, [http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/artikel/23/23713/1.html Science Fiction in Arabic Literature]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ottoman literature====
{{Main|Ottoman literature}}
{{See also|Poetry of the Ottoman Empire|Prose of the Ottoman Empire}}

The two primary streams of Ottoman written literature are [[poetry]] and [[prose]]. Of the two, [[divan poetry]] was by far the dominant stream. Moreover, it should be noted that, until the 19th century, Ottoman prose did not contain any examples of [[fiction]]; that is, there were no counterparts to, for instance, the European [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]], [[short story]], or novel (though analogous genres did, to some extent, exist in both the Turkish folk tradition and in divan poetry). Until the 19th century, Ottoman prose never managed to develop to the extent that contemporary divan poetry did. A large part of the reason for this was that much prose was expected to adhere to the rules of ''sec''' (سجع, also transliterated as ''seci''), or [[rhymed prose]],&lt;ref&gt;Belge, 389&lt;/ref&gt; a type of writing descended from the Arabic ''[[saj']]'' and which prescribed that between each adjective and noun in a sentence, there must be a [[rhyme]].

===Jewish literature===
{{Further|Jewish literature|Hebrew literature}}

Medieval Jewish fiction often drew on ancient [[aggadah|Jewish legends]], and was written in a variety of languages including [[Hebrew]] and [[Judeo-Arabic]]. [[Piyyut|Liturgical Jewish poetry]] in Hebrew flourished in Palestine in the seventh and eighth centuries with the writings of [[Yose ben Yose]], [[Yanai (Payetan)|Yanai]], and [[Eleazar Kalir]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0013_0_12632.html Encyclopedia Judaica]&lt;/ref&gt;  Later Jewish poets in Spain, Provencal, and Italy wrote both religious and secular poems in Hebrew; particularly prominent poets were the Spanish Jewish poets [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]] and [[Yehuda Halevi]].  In addition to poetry and fiction, medieval Jewish literature also includes [[Jewish philosophy#Jewish philosophy before Maimonides|philosophical literature]], [[Kabbalah: Primary Texts#Primary texts|mystical (Kabbalistic) literature]], [[Musar literature#Medieval Musar literature|ethical (musar) literature]], [[Halakhic|legal (halakhic)]] literature, and [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible#Commentaries|commentaries on the Bible]].

===India===
{{Further|Indian literature| Sangam literature|Classical Sanskrit literature}}

Early Medieval ([[Gupta period]]) literature in India sees the flowering of [[Sanskrit drama]], classical [[Sanskrit poetry]] and the compilation of the [[Puranas]]. Sanskrit declines in the early 2nd millennium, late works such as the ''[[Kathasaritsagara]]'' dating to the 11th century, to the benefit of literature composed in [[Middle Indic]] vernaculars such as [[Old Bengali]], [[Old Hindi]].

===China===
[[Image:LiBai.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Li Po Chanting a Poem, by [[Liang K'ai]] (13th century)]]
{{Main|Chinese literature}}

[[Lyric poetry]] advanced far more in China than in Europe prior to 1000, as multiple new forms developed in the [[Han dynasty|Han]], [[Tang dynasty|Tang]], and [[Song dynasty|Song]] dynasties: perhaps the greatest poets of this era in Chinese literature were [[Li Bai]] and [[Du Fu]].

Printing began in Tang Dynasty China. A copy of the ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'', a key [[Buddhist]] text, found sealed in a cave in China in the early 20th century, is the oldest known dated printed book, with a printed date of 868. The method used was [[block printing]].

The scientist, statesman, and general [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095 AD) was the author of the ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'' (1088), a large book of scientific literature that included the oldest description of the magnetized [[compass]]. During the Song Dynasty, there was also the enormous historical work of the ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', compiled into 294 volumes of 3 million written [[Chinese characters]] by the year 1084 AD.

The true vernacular novel was developed in China during the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644 AD).{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Some authors feel that China originated the novel form with the ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' by [[Luo Guanzhong]] (in the 14th century), although others feel that this epic is distinct from the novel in key ways.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Fictional novels published during the Ming period include the [[Water Margin]] and the [[Journey to the West]], which represent two of the [[Four Great Classical Novels]] of Chinese literature.

===Japan===
{{Main|Japanese literature|List of Japanese classic texts}}

Classical Japanese literature generally refers to literature produced during the [[Heian Period]], what some would consider a golden era of art and literature. ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' (early 11th century) by [[Murasaki Shikibu]] is considered the pre-eminent masterpiece of Heian fiction and an early example of a work of fiction in the form of a [[novel]]. It is sometimes called the world's first novel, the first modern novel, the first [[romance novel]], or the first novel to still be considered a classic.

Other important works of this period include the ''[[Kokin Wakashū]]'' (905), a [[Waka (poetry)|waka]]-poetry anthology, and ''[[The Pillow Book]]'' (990s), the latter written by Murasaki Shikibu's contemporary and rival, [[Sei Shōnagon]], as an essay about the life, loves, and pastimes of nobles in the Emperor's court.  The ''[[iroha]]'' poem, now one of two standard orderings for the Japanese [[syllabary]], was also written during the early part of this period.

The 10th-century Japanese narrative, ''[[The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter]]'', can be considered an early example of proto-[[science fiction]]. The protagonist of the story, Kaguya-[[hime]], is a princess from the Moon who is sent to Earth for safety during a celestial war, and is found and raised by a bamboo cutter in Japan. She is later taken back to the Moon by her real [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] family. A manuscript illustration depicts a disc-shaped flying object similar to a [[flying saucer]].&lt;ref name=Richardson&gt;{{citation|title=The Halstead Treasury of Ancient Science Fiction|first=Matthew|last=Richardson|publisher=Halstead Press|location=Rushcutters Bay, NSW|year=2001|isbn=978-1875684649}} ([[cf.]] {{citation|title=Once Upon a Time|journal=Emerald City|issue=85|date=September 2002|url=http://www.emcit.com/emcit085.shtml#Once|accessdate=2008-09-17}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In this time the imperial court patronized the poets, most of whom were courtiers or ladies-in-waiting. Editing anthologies of poetry was a national pastime. Reflecting the aristocratic atmosphere, the poetry was elegant and sophisticated and expressed emotions in a rhetorical style.

==Renaissance==
{{Main|Renaissance Literature|15th century in literature|16th century in literature}}

Had nothing occurred to change literature in the 15th century but the Renaissance, the break with medieval approaches would have been clear enough.  The 15th century, however, also brought [[Johann Gutenberg]] and his invention of the [[printing press]], an innovation (for Europe, at least) that would change literature forever.  Texts were no longer precious and expensive to produce—they could be cheaply and rapidly put into the marketplace.  [[Literacy]] went from the prized possession of the select few to a much broader section of the population (though by no means universal).  As a result, much about literature in Europe was radically altered in the two centuries following Gutenberg's unveiling of the printing press in 1455.

[[William Caxton]] was the first English printer and published [[English language]] texts including ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' (a collection of oral tales of the [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] Knights which is a forerunner of the [[novel]]) and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''. These are an indication of future directions in literature. With the arrival of the printing press a process begins in which folk yarns and legends are collected within a [[frame story]] and then mass published.

In the Renaissance, the focus on learning for learning's sake causes an outpouring of literature.  [[Petrarch]] popularized the [[sonnet]] as a poetic form; [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Decameron]]'' made romance acceptable in prose as well as poetry; [[François Rabelais]] rejuvenates satire with ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]''; [[Michel de Montaigne]] single-handedly invented the [[essay]] and used it to catalog his life and ideas.  Perhaps the most controversial and important work of the time period was a treatise printed in [[Nuremberg]], entitled ''[[De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium]]'': in it, the astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]  removed the Earth from its privileged position in the universe, which had far-reaching effects, not only in science, but in literature and its approach to humanity, hierarchy, and truth.

==Early modern period==
{{Main|Early Modern literature}}
{{Further|Baroque literature|16th century in literature|17th century in literature}}

A new spirit of science and investigation in Europe was part of a general upheaval in human understanding which began with the European invasion of the [[New World]] in 1492 and continues through the subsequent centuries, even up to the present day.

The form of writing now commonplace across the world—the [[novel]]—originated from the [[early modern period]] and grew in popularity in the next century.  Before the [[modern novel]] became established as a form there first had to be a transitional stage when "novelty" began to appear in the style of the epic poem.

Plays for entertainment (as opposed to religious enlightenment) returned to Europe's stages in the early modern period.  [[William Shakespeare]] is the most notable of the early modern playwrights, but numerous others made important contributions, including [[Molière]], [[Pierre Corneille]], [[Jean Racine]], [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[Christopher Marlowe]], and [[Ben Jonson]]. From the 16th to the 18th century [[Commedia dell'arte]] performers improvised in the streets of Italy and France. Some Commedia dell'arte plays were written down. Both the written plays and the [[improvisation]] were influential upon literature of the time, particularly upon the work of Molière. Shakespeare drew upon the arts of [[jester]]s and strolling players in creating new style comedies. All the parts, even the female ones, were played by men (''[[Drag (clothing)|en travesti]]'') but that would change, first in France and then in England too, by the end of the 17th century.

The epic [[Elizabethan]] poem ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' by [[Edmund Spenser]] was published, in its first part, in 1590 and then in completed form in 1597. ''The Fairie Queen'' marks the transitional period in which "novelty" begins to enter into the narrative in the sense of overturning and playing with the flow of events. Theatrical forms known in Spenser's time such as the Masque and the [[Mummers play|Mummers' Play]] are incorporated into the poem in ways which ''twist tradition'' and turn it to political [[propaganda]] in the service of [[Queen Elizabeth I]].

The earliest work considered an [[opera]] in the sense the work is usually understood dates from around 1597. It is ''[[Dafne]]'', (now lost) written by [[Jacopo Peri]] for an elite circle of literate [[Florence|Florentine]] [[Humanism|humanists]] who gathered as the "[[Florentine Camerata|Camerata]]".

17th century is considered as the greatest era of Spanish and French literature where it is called [[Spanish Golden Age|Siglo de Oro]] and [[Louis XIV of France|Grand Siècle]] respectively. The most famous authors beside playwrights include [[Jean de La Fontaine]] and [[Charles Perrault]] known primarily for their [[fable]]s.

[[Miguel de Cervantes]]'s ''[[Don Quixote]]'' has been called "the first novel" by many literary scholars (or the first of the modern European novels). It was published in two parts. The first part was published in 1605 and the second in 1615. It might be viewed as a parody of ''Le Morte d'Arthur'' (and other examples of the [[Romance (heroic literature)|chivalric romance]]), in which case the novel form would be the direct result of poking fun at a collection of heroic folk legends. This is fully in keeping with the spirit of the age of enlightenment which began from about this time and delighted in giving a satirical twist to the stories and ideas of the past. It's worth noting that this trend toward satirising previous writings was only made possible by the [[printing press]]. Without the invention of [[mass production|mass-produced]] copies of a book it would not be possible to assume the reader will have seen the earlier work and will thus understand the references within the text.

The new style in English poetry during the 17th century was that of the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] movement. The [[metaphysical poets]] were [[John Donne]], [[George Herbert]], [[Andrew Marvell]] and others. Metaphysical poetry is characterised by a spirit of intellectual investigation of the spiritual, rather than the mystical reverence of many earlier English poems. The metaphysical poets were clearly trying to ''understand'' the world around them and the spirit behind it, instead of accepting dogma on the basis of faith.

In the middle of the century [[English Civil War|the king of England was overthrown]] and a [[Commonwealth of England|republic declared]]. In the new regime (which lasted from 1649 to 1653) the arts suffered. In England and the rest of the British Isles [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s rule temporarily banned all theatre, [[festivals]], [[jester]]s, [[mummers play]]s and frivolities. The ban was lifted when the monarchy was restored with [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. The [[Drury Lane]] theatre was favorite of King Charles.

In contrast to the metaphysical poets was [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', an [[Epic poetry|epic]] religious poem in [[blank verse]]. Milton had been Oliver Cromwell's chief propagandist and suffered when [[English Restoration|the Restoration]] came. ''Paradise Lost'' is one of the highest developments of the epic form in poetry immediately preceding the era of the modern prose novel.

An allegorical novel, ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]] from This World to That Which Is to Come'' was published by [[John Bunyan]] in 1678.

Other early novelists include [[Daniel Defoe]] (born 1660) and [[Jonathan Swift]] (born 1667).

==Modern period==

===18th century===

{{Main|18th century literature}}
{{Further|Augustan literature|French literature of the 18th century}}

This is the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and its most important authors are [[Voltaire]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Adam Smith]]. The second half of the century sees the beginnings of [[Romanticism]] with [[Goethe]].

===19th century===
{{Main|19th century literature}}

In Britain, the 19th century is dominated by the [[Victorian era]], characterized by [[Romanticism]], with [[Romantic poetry|Romantic poets]] such as [[William Wordsworth]], [[Lord Byron]] or [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and genres such as the [[gothic novel]].

In Germany, the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' period of the late 18th century merges into a [[Classicism|Classicist]] and [[Romanticism|Romantic]] period, epitomized by the long era of [[Goethe]]'s activity, covering the first third of the century. The conservative ''[[Biedermeier]]'' style conflicts with the radical ''[[Vormärz]]'' in the turbulent period separating the end  of the Napoleonic wars from the [[Revolutions of 1848]].

In Denmark, the early 19th century [[Danish Golden Age|Golden Age]] produced prolific literary authors such as [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Hans Christian Andersen]].

In the later 19th century, Romanticism is countered by [[Literary realism|Realism]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]]. The late 19th century, known as the ''[[Belle Époque]]'', with its ''[[Fin de siècle]]'' retrospectively appeared as a "golden age" of European culture, cut short by the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914.

===20th century===
{{Main|20th century literature}}

The main periods of 20th century literature are captured in the bipartite division, [[Modernist literature]] and [[Postmodern literature]], flowering from roughly 1900 to 1940 and 1945 to 1980 respectively, divided, as a rule of thumb, by  [[World War II]].

Popular literature develops its own genres such as [[fantasy literature|fantasy]] and [[science fiction]]. Ignored by mainstream [[literary criticism]], these genres develop their own establishments and critical awards, such as the ''[[Nebula Award]]'' (since 1965), the ''[[British Fantasy Award]]'' (since 1971) or the ''[[Mythopoeic Awards]]'' (since 1971).

== History of the book ==
Related to other forms of literary history, the [[history of the book]] is a field of interdisciplinary enquiry drawing on the methods of [[bibliography]], [[cultural history]], [[literary criticism]], and [[media influence|media theory]].  Principally concerned with the production, circulation, and reception of texts and their material forms, book history seeks to connect forms of textuality with their material aspects.

Among the issues within the history of literature with which book history can be seen to intersect are: the development of authorship as a profession, the formation of reading audiences, the constraints of censorship and copyright, and the economics of literary form.

'''''Hollywood 7''''' (known as '''''S Club 7 in Hollywood''''' in the U.S.) was the third series in the [[BBC]] [[television series]] starring British pop group [[S Club|S Club 7]] and the second [[television series]] shot in [[California]]. The programme was shown every week on CBBC from 27 September 2001 and 20 December 2001&lt;ref name="airdate"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://catalogue.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/series/HOLLYWOOD+7 | title=BBC Programme Catalogue - Hollywood 7 | accessdate=21 October 2007 | publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and starred all seven members of the band as fictionalized versions of themselves. The series also featured former ''[[Brady Bunch]]'' actor [[Barry Williams (actor)|Barry Williams]] as Dean Strickland, S Club 7's manager.

Following the pattern of the previous series of the show, the show was renamed ''S Club 7 in Hollywood'' for American audiences. It aired on the renamed [[ABC Family]] network from 29 September 2001 to 26 January 2002.&lt;ref name="USairdate"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://epguides.com/SClub7/ | title=L.A. 7 (A Titles &amp; Air Dates Guide) | accessdate=20 October 2007 | publisher=EpGuides.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In the first episode of the series, the group decide to give themselves 24 hours to get themselves a new manager. The group come across Dean Strickland and he adopts the seven as their new manager. Shortly into the series, the group find themselves without a record deal and so they have to search for a deal, or else they'll disband. Luckily, the group find a record company willing to sign them. Unlike ''[[Miami 7]]'' and ''[[L.A. 7]]'', which portrays the S Club 7 as struggling just to make known of their existence, ''Hollywood 7'' portrays the group's experiencing what they've been hoping for since they came to [[United States of America|the States]]: having an agent, getting a record deal, becoming publicized, etc. They film their first music video, become a support act for a Latin heart-throb, and even have their first concert. At the end of the series, the group have to move back to England to record their album and start internationally promoting S Club 7, just as they're starting to become fully assimilated into American life.

The series also saw, mirroring real life, a relationship between [[Hannah Spearritt|Hannah]] and [[Paul Cattermole|Paul]] develop.&lt;ref name=love&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/music/newsid_1608000/1608993.stm | title=S Club 7 pair admit secret love | accessdate=21 October 2007 | date=19 October 2001 | publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fifth episode of the series, they share a kiss which sends shock waves throughout the band.

[[File:Impian Kite at Melaka Flying.jpg|thumb|Malaysia's largest inflatable kite]]
'''Impian Kite''' is [[Malaysia]]’s largest hand-made inflatable [[kite]]. Since 2004, it has been listed as such in Malaysia’s Book of Records, measuring {{convert|16.7|x|36.4|m|ft}}.

The kite was made by a group of friends in [[Melaka]] and [[Malacca City|Malacca.]] 

Unable to buy a super-sized kite, this group sewed one themselves using a small automatic [[Singer sewing machine]]. Designed by only pieces of papers and imagination, and majority sewn by the main person, Edmund Cheong. Part of the team at that time, Lim Kok Tiong, Koh Hong Guan, Chong Swee Ching, Lee Poh Choon and Nicholas Cheong contributed in part of the idea, sewing and materials, space and also time. 

Today, the team is known as Team Impian, a group of kite flying friends, flies regularly at [[Klebang Beach|Pantai Klebang]]. The team regularly flies at Bintulu Kite Festival, also known as Borneo International Kite Festival, [[Bintulu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.borneokite.com/ Borneo International Kite Festival]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[South Asia]]n [[film industry|cinema]], an '''item number''' or '''item song''' is a musical number inserted into a film that does not have any relevance to the plot. The term is commonly used within [[Cinema of India|Indian]] ([[Bollywood|Hindi]], [[Cinema of Karnataka|Kannada]], [[Tamil cinema|Tamil]], and [[Cinema of Andhra Pradesh|Telugu]]) and [[Cinema of Nepal|Nepali]] films to describe a catchy, upbeat, often sexually provocative dance sequence for a song in a movie.&lt;ref name="Definition"&gt;[http://www.cylive.com/viewContent.do?id=351&amp;vt=pub Journals : Item number defined] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407174943/http://www.cylive.com/viewContent.do?id=351&amp;vt=pub |date=7 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main aim of an item number is to entertain movie-goers and to lend support to the [[Film promotion|marketability]] of the film by being featured in [[movie trailer|trailers]].&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barrett|first=Grant|title=The official dictionary of unofficial English: a crunk omnibus for thrillionaires and bampots for the Ecozoic Age|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=0-07-145804-2|year=2006 |pages=189, 190}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are favoured by [[filmmaker]]s as they afford the opportunity pick potential hit songs from the stocks, since they do not add to the continuity of the plot.&lt;ref name="Communalism"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morey|first=Peter|title=Alternative Indias: writing, nation and communalism|year=2005|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=90-420-1927-1|page=221,178|author2=Alex Tickell|editor=Peter Morey and Alex Tickell}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus a vehicle for commercial success which ensures repeat viewing.&lt;ref name="Globalization"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhattacharya Mehta|first=Rini|title=Bollywood and Globalization: Indian Popular Cinema, Nation, and Diaspora|year=2010|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=1-84331-833-4|page=42|author2=Rajeshwari Pandharipande}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A female [[actor]], [[singer]], or [[dancer]], especially someone who is poised to become a [[Movie star|star]], who appears in an item number is known as an '''item girl''' (there are '''item boys''' as well).&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt; However, second generation South Asian females are more commonly featured in item numbers than males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gera Roy|first=Anjali|title=The Body of New Asian Dance Music |ssrn=1471101|publisher=SSRN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GhoshTOI&gt;{{cite news|last=Ghosh|first=Biswadeep|title=Biggest item numbers ever!|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-12-15/news-and-interviews/28231300_1_songs-numbers-film-lovers|accessdate=25 April 2011|newspaper=Times of India|date=15 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Item numbers usually feature one or more persons other than the lead actors. Sometimes, established female and male actors will appear in item numbers (a phenomenon billed as a "special appearance" by that actor).

Although the origin of the term "item number" is obscure, it is likely that it derives its meaning from objectification of women. This is because ''item'' in Mumbai film slang is used by Indian men to objectify women.&lt;ref name="Communalism"/&gt; The classic meaning of item number refers to highly sexualized songs with racy imagery and suggestive lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Towheed Feroze|title=Hypocrisy of the reel and the real|url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/op-ed/2014/sep/29/hypocrisy-reel-and-real|accessdate=15 May 2015|publisher=Dhaka Tribune|date=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The item number would feature an item girl who appeared in the film as a dancer, usually in a bar or nightclub, and was only in the film for the duration of that song.

==History==

Up to the 1970s, Bollywood often relied on a female "vamp" character &amp;ndash; usually playing the role of a [[cabaret]] dancer, ''[[tawaif]]''/[[prostitute]]/[[courtesan]], or male gangster's moll &amp;ndash; to provide musical entertainment deemed more risqué. While film heroines also sang and danced, it was the vamp who wore more revealing clothes, smoked, drank, and sang sexually suggestive lyrics.&lt;ref name="Communalism"/&gt; The vamp was portrayed as immodest rather than evil, and her dance performances were sexualized by male producers. The trend was started by [[Cukoo|Cuckoo]] in films like ''[[Awaara]]'' (1951), ''[[Aan]]'' (1952) and ''Shabistan'' (1951).&lt;ref name="filmonomics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pixelonomics.com/bollywood-item-numbers-monica-to-munni/|title=Bollywood item numbers: from Monica to Munni|year=2010|accessdate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Item numbers had been featured in Bollywood from as early as the 30s. Azoorie in the 1930s often performed item numbers; Cuckoo was the next popular item dancer in the late 40s. Her banner year was 1949 when she was featured in over 17 films performing dances. Actress and classical dancer [[Vyjayanthimala]] was the one that introduced the classical dance number in Hindi films with her debut film Bahar (1951). The mixture of classical plus contemporary was popularized by Vyjayanthimala in films such as [[Devdas (1955 film)|''Devdas'']] (1955), [[Amrapali (film)|''Amrapali'']] (1966), ''[[Madhumati]]'' (1958), [[Sadhna (1958 film)|''Sadhna'']] (1958), [[Sunghursh]] (1968) etc. 

In the early 50s, Cuckoo introduced the Burmese-Anglo [[Helen (actress)|Helen]] as a chorus girl. In time Helen would come to be the most popular vamp of the late-50s, 60s and 70s,&lt;ref name="Global Bollywood"&gt;{{cite book|last=Anandam P|first=Kavoori|title=Global Bollywood|year=2008|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=0-8147-4799-X|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; having had performed in scores of item numbers including such popular songs as "Mera Naam Chin-Chin Choo" from the film ''[[Howrah Bridge (film)|Howrah Bridge]]'' (1958), "[[Piya Tu Ab To Aaja]]" from ''[[Caravan (1971 film)|Caravan]]'' (1971), "Mehbooba Mehbooba" from ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975) and "Yeh Mera Dil" from ''[[Don (1978 film)|Don]] '' (1978)The song's tune was also used in [[Don't Phunk with My Heart|Don't Phunk With My Heart]], "O Haseena Zulfon Wali" from [[Teesri Manzil]] and "[[Aa Jaane Jaan]]".  In films like ''[[Gunga Jumna]]'' and ''[[Zindagi (1964 film)|Zindagi]]'' the actor performed semi-classical Indian dances in songs like "Tora man bada paapi" and "Ghungarwa mora chham chham baaje". A ''[[desi]]'' bar number, "Mungra Mungra" from ''[[Inkaar (1978 film)|Inkaar]]'' was also immensely popular. In addition to her skillful dancing, her anglicised looks too helped further the vamp image.&lt;ref name="revamp"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mukherjee|first=Madhurita|title=Revamping Bollywood's sexy vamps |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2003-02-03/news-interviews/27281535_1_cinema-special-appearance-shamita-shetty|accessdate=12 November 2010|newspaper=Times of India|date=3 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helen's dominance pushed other vying item number dancers like Madhumati, [[Bela Bose]], Laxmi Chhaya, Jeevankala, Aruna, Sheela R. and Sujata Bakshi into the background and less prestigious and low budget b-movies. 

In the early part of the 1970s actresses Jayshree T., [[Bindu (actress)|Bindu]], [[Aruna Irani]] and [[Padma Khanna]] entered into what was Helen's monopoly. Another noted feature of this era was the "tribal and ''banjara''" item numbers such as the one in the [[Dharmendra]], Zeenat Aman and [[Rex Harrison]] starer ''[[Shalimar (1978 film)|Shalimar]]''. Such songs provided the necessary settings for the lead couple's love to bloom.&lt;ref name="bourgeois"&gt;{{cite book|last=Deshpande|first=Anirudh|title=Class, Power And Consciousness In Indian Cinema And Television|year=2009|publisher=Primus Books|isbn=978-81-908918-2-0|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the 1980s the vamp and the heroine merged into one figure and the lead actress had begun to perform the bolder numbers. The craze for "tribal and ''banjara''" item numbers were soon gave way to slick choreography.&lt;ref name="bourgeois"/&gt; In the late 1990s, with the proliferation of film songs based television shows, film producers had come to realise that an exceptional way to entice audiences into theaters was by spending excessively on the visualization of songs. Hence regardless of the theme and plot, an elaborate song and dance routine involving spectacularly lavish sets, costumes, special effects, extras and dancers would invariably be featured in a film. It was asserted that this contributed highly to the film's "repeat value".&lt;ref name="Ganti"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ganti|first=Tejaswini|title=Bollywood: a guidebook to popular Hindi cinema|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-28853-3|pages=86, 167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Madhuri Dixit]] is often considered to be the pioneer of the modern trend. In the late 1980s, the song "Ek Do Teen" was added to the movie ''[[Tezaab]]'' as an afterthought, but it transformed Dixit and made her a superstar.&lt;ref name="Ganti"/&gt; Her partnership with choreographer [[Saroj Khan]] has resulted in numerous hits including the controversial "Choli ke peeche kya hai" and "Dhak Dhak" (''[[Beta (film)|Beta]]'').&lt;ref name="saroj khan"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bhattacharya|first=Roshmila|title=Our heart goes ''dhak dhak'' again|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Our-hearts-go-dhak-dhak-again/Article1-629156.aspx|accessdate=29 November 2010|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=21 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the release of the film ''[[Khalnayak]]'', there were press reports stating that people were seeing the film again and again but only for the song "Choli ke peeche kya hai" that featured Dixit.&lt;ref name="Ganti"/&gt;

Although there have been many songs that fit the descriptions of item numbers in the early and mid-1990s, the term itself was coined when [[Shilpa Shetty]] danced for "Main Aai Hoon UP Bihar Lootne" in the movie ''[[Shool]]''. This is perhaps the first time the media actually referred to Shetty as an "item girl" and the scene as an "item number".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=  |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdySdhZAvh4&amp;feature=feedu |title=Latest Bollywood News&amp;nbsp;— Top 5 Trends That Gripped Bollywood |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent developments==
Since 2000, many top Bollywood stars now do item numbers, and many new women entering Bollywood find item numbers a more amenable shortcut to success, as opposed to more traditional roles with no guarantee of eventual stardom.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Former item girls in pop songs outside films, [[Rakhi Sawant]] and [[Meghna Naidu]], for example, are now in demand and very popular. Today, they are even being given lead roles in commercially successful movies.{{as of?|date=May 2012}} As of 2007, [[Mallika Sherawat]] had become the most expensive item girl, charging Rs.15 million (roughly US$375,000) for the song "Mehbooba Mehbooba" in ''[[Aap Ka Suroor - The Real Love Story]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Another example is actress [[Urmila Matondkar]], one of the most successful item girls during that time.{{Or|date=May 2011}} She was featured in "Chamma Chamma" in the 1998 film ''[[China Gate (1998 film)|China Gate]]''. [[Baz Luhrmann]]'s 2001 film musical, ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' used a westernized version of this song.

[[Malaika Arora]] and [[Yana Gupta]] are "official" item number dancers and have said in interviews that they don't want to act in movies since they already earn more than enough money just by doing one item number as opposed to full-on roles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

[[Abhishek Bachchan]] became the first "item boy" with his performance in ''[[Rakht]]''; [[Shahrukh Khan]] performed an item number of sorts during the opening credits of ''[[Kaal]]'' but later had an item number in a truer sense of the word with "[[Dard-e-disco|Dard-e-Disco]]" in ''[[Om Shanti Om]]'', where he was shot in a more typical "item girl" manner, with Khan wearing minimal clothing (though this number did have a connection, albeit tenuous, with the plot of the film). In ''[[Krazzy 4]]'', [[Hrithik Roshan]] has an item number during the end credits. [[Ranbir Kapoor]] made his debut in an item number in ''Chillar Party'' (2011); drawing inspiration from Rishi Kapoor's [[Qawwali]] song "Parda" from ''[[Amar Akbar Anthony]]''. In 2005 and 2006 actress [[Bipasha Basu]] gave blockbuster hit numbers like No Entry and Beedi Jalaile.

===2007-2010===

In the 2007 [[Telugu film]] ''[[Desamuduru]]'', the song "Attaantode Ittaantode" featuring [[Allu Arjun]] and [[Rambha (actress)|Rambha]] became a chartbuster. In the 2007 film ''[[Om Shanti Om]]'', the song "Deewangi Deewangi" had guest appearances by over [[Om Shanti Om#Cast|30 Bollywood stars]]. In 2008, the makers of ''[[Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi]]'' featured [[Kajol]], [[Bipasha Basu]], [[Lara Dutta]], [[Priety Zinta]], and [[Rani Mukerji]] playing five leading ladies opposite [[Shahrukh Khan]] in the song "[[Phir Milenge Chalte Chalte]]".

In 2010, [[Katrina Kaif]] featured in "[[Sheila Ki Jawani]]" from ''[[Tees Maar Khan (2010 film)|Tees Maar Khan]]'', and [[Malaika Arora]] featured in "[[Munni Badnaam Hui]]" from ''[[Dabangg]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/report/slide-show-1-top-item-numbers-of-2010/20101209.htm |title=The Hottest Item Numbers of 2010 - Rediff.com Movies |publisher=Rediff.com |date=9 December 2010 |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallels were drawn between Katrina and Malaika, as well as between the item numbers, in what was popularly known as the "Munni vs Sheila" debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nagpaul-D'Souza|first=Dipti|title=Munni vs Sheila: The way of the 'Item Bomb'|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/munni-vs-sheila-the-way-of-the-item-bomb/729468/1|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=Indian Express|date=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wangoo|first=Anupama|title=Sheila steals Munni's thunder|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-12-26/chandigarh/28217169_1_munni-badnaam-hui-malaika-arora-jawani|accessdate=22 December 2011|newspaper=Times of India|date=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The songs became so popular, that, soon, more films began incorporating item numbers, and with more top stars now wanting to do them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-forthcoming-item-numbers/20120626.htm |title=PIX: SIZZLING item numbers coming up! - Rediff.com Movies |publisher=Rediff.com |date=26 June 2012 |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012-2015===

In 2012, [[Katrina Kaif]] again featured in an item number "[[Chikni Chameli]]" sung by [[Shreya Ghoshal]] which became a huge hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-12-21/news-interviews/30538652_1_chikni-chameli-song-marathi-music|title=Chikni Chameli sets Kombdi’s popularity soaring|publisher=[[Times of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Deepika Padukone]] had some success item dancing, performing songs like "Party On My Mind" and "Lovely". [[Priyanka Chopra]] did many songs such as "Babli Badamash", "Pinky", and an appearance in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's [[Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela]] song "Ram Chahe Leela", of which became a blockbuster upon release. [[Mahi Gill]], [[Sonakshi Sinha]], [[Hina Khan (actress)|Hina Khan]], and [[Jacqueline Fernandez]] made their debut with  "Don't Touch My Body", "Thank God It's Friday", "Roshni Jawani" and "Jadu Ki Jappi" respectively.

Sunny Leone performed her first item dance with "''Shootout At Wadala''" from the 2013 movie "Laila", followed up with ''Baby Doll'' from [[Ragini MMS 2]]. [[Varun Dhawan]] made his debut with ''Palat Tera Hero Idhar Hai'' from the movie [[Main Tera Hero]].

=== 2017-2018 ===
In 2017, [[Amanda Rosario]] featured in the hit item number "Sarkar"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=R-Vision India|title=Sarkar {{!}} Udanchhoo {{!}} Amanda Rosario {{!}} Rani Hazarika {{!}} Latest Bollywood Item Hindi Song|date=2017-12-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2aS1OFT790|accessdate=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; sung by Rani Hazarika from the movie [[Udanchhoo]].

==Criticism and controversies==
Item numbers have been criticized for their gratuitous objectification of women.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Item numbers have also been imitated in [[Mumbai]]'s [[Dance bar|bar dancers]]. In respect of the ban on bar dancers in Mumbai, it has even been argued{{weasel-inline|date=January 2013}} that the morality of bar dancer's imitation of item numbers cannot be questioned without questioning the morality of screening of item numbers in a film in public theatres. It has also been argued{{weasel-inline|date=January 2013}} that the two are equally amoral as both objectify women for commercial gain, with likely negative effects on the male population.&lt;ref name="Mumbai bar"&gt;{{cite web|last=Agnes|first=Flavia|title=Hypocritical Morality: Mumbai’s Ban on Bar Dancers|url=http://www.manushi-india.org/pdfs_issues/PDF%20Files%20149/Flavia%20Agnes.pdf|publisher=Manushi|accessdate=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the Bollywood action thriller ''[[Khalnayak]]'' was instantly controversial for its item numbers and risqué song lyrics. While the lyrics of "Choli Ke Peechhe?" ("What's behind the blouse?") were considered vulgar by some, others defended the song on the ground that it was based on folk traditions. The song eventually set off protests all over the country and a potential ban on the song was debated in the [[Indian Parliament]]. The anger and commotion, however, only helped the song and the film become more popular, as many went to the movie theater out of curiosity, to watch [[Madhuri Dixit]] perform the song.

Recently, the [[Central Board of Film Certification]] issued a resolution declaring that item numbers will now be rated as adult content and will be banned from being shown on television channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sinha|first=Amitabh|title='Item songs' to be barred from TV|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/item-songs-to-be-barred-from-tv/1071182/|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:木曽駒 2.jpg|thumbnail|Kiso horses]]
The '''Kiso''' or '''Kiso Horse''' ({{lang-ja|木曽馬}}, kiso uma) is one of the eight indigenous [[list of horse breeds|horse breeds]] of Japan. It is the only native horse breed from [[Honshu]], the principal island of Japan.&lt;ref name=nhk/&gt; Like most other Japanese native breeds, it is critically endangered.&lt;ref name=barb/&gt;

== History ==

Japanese native horses are thought to derive from stock brought at several different times from various parts of the Asian mainland; the first such importations took place by the sixth century at the latest.{{r|imh}} Horses were used for farming – as [[pack-animal]]s although not for [[draught power]]; until the advent of [[firearms]] in the later sixteenth century, they were much used for warfare.{{r|fao|page=67}} The horses were not large: remains of some 130 horses have been excavated from battlefields dating to the [[Kamakura period]] (1185–1333 AD); they ranged from {{nobreak|110 to 140 cm}} in [[withers]] height.{{r|fao|page=67}}

The Kiso breed originates from the [[Kiso Valley]] and the [[Kiso Sanmyaku]] mountain range, in [[Nagano Prefecture]], and the [[Higashimino]] region of [[Gifu Prefecture]], in central [[Honshu]].&lt;ref name=dad/&gt;&lt;ref name=edwards/&gt;&lt;ref name=takasu/&gt; During the [[Meiji era]] (1868–1912) it was severely affected by the breeding programme of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]], which wanted taller horses and ordered that all stallions of the breed should be [[gelded]],&lt;ref name=nicol/&gt; and that only imported stallions be used to cover Kiso mares.&lt;ref name=takasu3/&gt; After the [[Second World War]] few [[pure-bred]] Kiso horses remained.&lt;ref name=obata/&gt; A single stallion, dedicated to a religious shrine, had escaped castration. His son Daisan-haruyama was born in 1951 and is the foundation stallion of the present-day breed.&lt;ref name=takasu3/&gt;

In 1899 there were 6823 Kiso horses.&lt;ref name=takasu3/&gt; Between 1965 and 1976 breed numbers fell from 510 to 32.&lt;ref name=barb/&gt; Registration of the breed began in that year, under the Kiso Pony Conservation Group,&lt;ref name=obata/&gt; which was formed in 1969,&lt;ref name=takasu3/&gt; and numbers have since slowly recovered.&lt;ref name=barb/&gt; In 2013 the total population was estimated at 150.&lt;ref name=takasu/&gt; As a result of this [[population bottleneck]], the [[effective population size]] – which has been calculated to be 45.8 – is much lower than the census population.&lt;ref name=takasu3/&gt;&lt;ref name=takasu2/&gt;

Four distinct sub-populations within the Kiso breed were identified in 2012.&lt;ref name=takasu2/&gt;

The Kiso Uma no Sato, or "Kiso horse village", at [[Kaita Kogen]] below [[Mount Kiso Ontake]], is a centre for the breeding and conservation of the Kiso breed.&lt;ref name=nhk/&gt;

==Characteristics==

The Kiso is a small horse, but mid-sized in relation to other Japanese native breeds.&lt;ref name=obata/&gt; Research published in 2011 found an average height of {{nobreak|131.9 ± 4.4 cm}}, an average thoracic circumference ([[Equine anatomy#External anatomy|girth]]) of {{nobreak|167.1 ± 10.1 cm}} and a [[cannon bone]] circumference of {{nobreak|18.3 ± 1.0 cm}}. There was little [[sexual dimorphism]]: while males were marginally larger than mares, the difference was not significant. The size of the breed has decreased since 1948; this may be due either to [[inbreeding]] or to lessening influence of the foreign stallions used before the War.&lt;ref name=takasu3/&gt;

The distribution of [[Horse coat colour|coat colours]] in Kiso horses has changed substantially since 1953: in 2011, approximately 93% of those studied were [[Bay (horse)|bay]] or dark bay, and the remainder either [[chestnut (horse)|chestnut]] or [[buckskin (horse)|buckskin]] [[dun (horse)|dun]]; in 1953, bay and dark bay made up less than 60%, and there were also small numbers of black, grey and palomino horses. All registered stallions in 2011 were bay. About 66% of the horses studied had a [[primitive markings#dorsal stripe|dorsal stripe]].&lt;ref name=takasu3/&gt;

A '''kuphar''' (also transliterated kufa, kuffah, quffa, quffah, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/104571 |chapter=kuphar, n. |title=Oxford English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a type of [[coracle]] or round boat traditionally used on the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers in ancient and modern [[Mesopotamia]]. Its circular shape means that it does not sail well against the current, as it tends to spin, but makes it safe, sturdy and easy to construct.  A kuphar is propelled by [[rowing]] or [[setting pole|poling]].&lt;ref name=Agius&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = BRILL| isbn = 9789004158634| last = Agius| first = Dionisius A.| title = Classic Ships of Islam: From Mesopotamia to the Indian Ocean| date = 2008|pages=129–132|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RP2uHT06zYgC&amp;lpg=PA130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hornell&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/00253359.1938.10657280| issn = 0025-3359| volume = 24| issue = 2| pages = 153–159| last = Hornell| first = James| title = The Coracles of the Tigris and Euphrates| journal = The Mariner's Mirror| accessdate = 2018-06-12| date = 1938-01-01| url = https://doi.org/10.1080/00253359.1938.10657280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "kuphar" is derived from the [[Arabic]] word "''quffa''" (قفة), meaning a [[basket]] woven from reeds and leaves. The boat visually resembles a basket and is used for a similar purpose: transporting fruits, vegetables, and other [[goods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=معنى قفة |encyclopedia=لسان العرب |publisher=الميرية |location=Bulaq |url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikisource/ar/c/cf/%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%86_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A820.pdf |accessdate=June 14, 2018 |last=منظور الأنصاري |first=ابن |date=1873}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabic word in turn originated from the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] word "''quppu''", meaning basket.&lt;ref name=Agius/&gt;

==History==
Reliefs depicting kuphars have been found in [[Assyria]]n ruins dating to the reigns of Kings [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (883 to 859 BCE), [[Sennacherib]] (705 to 681 BCE), and [[Ashurbanipal]] (668 to 627 BCE), who reigned during the 9th, 8th, and 7th centuries [[BCE]], respectively.{{r|Agius|page=130}} A translation of a tablet found by an amateur historian places the kuphar's origin even further in the past, in the [[Old Babylonian period]] (c.1830–1531 BCE), although this translation is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0261-3077| last = Kennedy| first = Maev| title = Relic reveals Noah's ark was circular| work = The Guardian| accessdate = 2018-06-14| date = 2010-01-01| url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jan/01/noahs-ark-was-circular}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1918 Tigris at Baghdad Iraq by Sven Hedin.png|thumb|left|Kuphars moored in [[Baghdad]] in 1918]]

Kuphars were described by Greek historian [[Herodotus]], who visited [[Babylon]] around 450 BCE:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The History of Herodotus |author=Herodotus, translated by George Rawlinson |volume=vol. 1 |publisher=Appleton and Company |year=1885}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|But that which surprises me most in the land, after the city itself, I will now proceed to mention. The boats which come down the river to Babylon are circular, and made of [[hide (skin)|skin]]s. The frames, which are of [[willow]], are cut in the country of the [[Armenian Highlands|Armenian]]s above [[Assyria]], and on these, which serve for hulls, a covering of skins is stretched outside, and thus the boats are made, without either stem or stern, quite round like a shield. They are then entirely filled with straw, and their cargo is put on board, after which they are suffered to float down the stream. Their chief freight is wine, stored in casks made of the wood of the [[palm-tree]]. They are managed by two men who stand upright in them, each plying an oar, one pulling and the other pushing. The boats are of various sizes, some larger, some smaller; the biggest reach as high as five thousand [[talent (measurement)|talent]]s' burthen. Each vessel has a live [[donkey|ass]] on board; those of larger size have more than one. When they reach Babylon, the cargo is landed and offered for sale; after which the men break up their boats, sell the straw and the frames, and loading their asses with the skins, set off on their way back to Armenia. The current is too strong to allow a boat to return upstream, for which reason they make their boats of skins rather than wood. On their return to Armenia they build fresh boats for the next voyage.|[[Herodotus]]}}

Five thousand Greek talents would be 143 [[ton]]s (130 [[tonne]]s). This is likely an exaggeration, although carvings of large kuphars carrying cut stones have been found in Assyrian ruins. These large kuphars were propelled by four rowers and relied partially on inflated hide sacks attached port and starboard to stay afloat.&lt;ref name=Badge&gt;{{Cite book| edition=  UK| publisher = Gwasg Carrech Gwalch| isbn = 9781845272555| last = Badge| first = Peter| title = The Coracles of the World| date = 2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; More reliable and recent analyses have determined that the largest ancient kuphar measured 18 feet (5.5 m) in diameter and could transport up to 16 tons.{{r|DeGraeve|page=86}}

There were two major forms of construction used — hides stretched over a framework, as described by Herodotus, and woven bundles of [[Reed (plant)|reeds]] or [[basketry]], waterproofed with [[bitumen]]. Boats of this sort were still used in modern times, being described by British ethnographer [[James Hornell]] in ''The Coracles of the Tigris and Euphrates'' (1938).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |pages=64–66 |title=Boats of the World: From the Stone Age to Medieval Times |author=Sean McGrail |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |isbn=9780199271863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biblical significance===
{{see also|Noah's Ark#Comparative mythology: the Babylonian origins of Noah's ark}}
A Babylonian [[cuneiform]] tablet on display at the [[British Museum]] suggests that Noah's Ark may have been a large kuphar.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news |title=Coracles: The surprising history of Britain’s strangest boat |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/23Fbd5ybr2CFG9BWYYZ7MZh/coracles-the-surprising-history-of-britain-s-strangest-boat |accessdate=14 June 2018 |work=BBC one |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tablet was translated by professor [[Irving Finkel]] and found to contain an ancient [[flood narrative]] that may have inspired the story of [[Noah's Ark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/11093350/Whats-the-truth-of-Noahs-Ark.html |title=What's the truth of Noah's Ark? |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |author=Sameer Rahim |date=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his translation, professor Finkel organized the construction of a large vessel of this kind, though he claimed that his 35 tonne ship was a scaled-down version of the full-sized ark. Finkel attempted to launch his "ark" in [[Kerala, India]], in 2014, but was unsuccessful. He attributed the failed launch of his double-decker vessel to the low quality of bitumen available in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Basu |first1=Shrabani |title=The ark that Finkel built |url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140914/jsp/7days/18833688.jsp |accessdate=14 June 2018 |work=The Telegraph India |date=September 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tablet describes the [[flood myth]] of [[Atrahasis]], a Babylonian hero who built an ark to shelter life from a flood of a divine origin that is thought to have started as a river flood. This ark was, according to the legend described on the tablet, a large kuphar, with either one or two decks, and a total deck area of 14,400 [[cubit]]s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (3600 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Noah's Ark is traditionally described as having a similar deck plan and a nearly identical deck area of 15,000 cubits&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (a difference of 4%). This has led Finkel to conclude that "the iconic story of the Flood, Noah, and the Ark as we know it today certainly originated in the landscape of ancient Mesopotamia, modern Iraq."&lt;ref name=Finkel&gt;{{citation |last=Finkel |first=Irving L. |title=The Ark Before Noah: Decoding the Story of the Flood |year=2014 |publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton |chapter=Conclusions: Stories and Shapes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lScWAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some evidence has been found of [[Neo-Assyria]]n legends depicting infants being cast adrift in kuphars on the river, similar to how baby [[Moses]] was [[Finding of Moses|cast adrift]] in a basket in the [[Book of Exodus]].&lt;ref name=Potts&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons| isbn = 9781405189880| last = Potts| first = Daniel T.| title = A Companion to the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East| date = 2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led some scholars to conclude that the basket that Moses was set adrift in on the Nile may have in fact been a kuphar.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;&lt;ref name=Potts /&gt;

==Modern use==
Kuphars remained in widespread use as [[water taxi]]s, [[lighter (barge)|lighter]]s, [[fishing boat]]s, and [[ferries]] in early 20th century [[Iraq]], especially around [[Baghdad]]. These vessels are typically 4.5–10 feet (1.4–3 meters) wide at the opening and have [[draft (ship)|draft]]s of 2.5–4 feet (0.8–1.2 meters) and [[freeboard]]s of 6–8 inches (15–20&amp;nbsp;cm) fully loaded. They typically transport four to five people although they can carry up to 20. Larger kuphars can transport four to five tons, equivalent to three horses, several people, and other assorted cargo.{{r|Agius|page=132}} The largest one measured in the 20th century had an opening 16.4 feet (5.0 m) in diameter, although due to the [[tumblehome]] nature of the kuphar's hull, its [[length overall|diameter overall]] was {{convert|18|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=Badge /&gt;

[[File:Qufa.jpg|thumb|A small kuphar on the Euphrates in Iraq]]
Kuphar use declined following the development of the [[automobile]] and the widespread construction of roads and bridges across modern Iraq. However, they could still be seen around Iraq until the 1970s.{{r|Agius|page=130}}
Modern kuphars are made of woven bundles of reeds waterproofed with bitumen, as in ancient times.&lt;ref name=Hornell /&gt; James Hornell described them thus:{{r|Hornell|page=153}}
{{quote|...the craft likened in form to the [[Tibet]]an food-bowl—perfectly circular in plan, nearly flat bottomed, and with convexly curved sides that tumble-home to join the stout cylindrical [[gunwale]] bounding the mouth, which is several inches less in diameter than the width at mid height. In construction a quffa is just a huge lidless basket, strengthened within by innumerable ribs radiating from around the centre of the floor. The type of basketry employed is of that widely distributed kind termed coiled basketry.|[[James Hornell]]}}

[[Tennyson]] referenced the boats in his 1827 poem ''Persia'',{{quote|On fair [[Diarbeck]]'s land of spice,&lt;br&gt;[[Adiabene]]'s plains of rice,&lt;br&gt;Where down th' Euphrates, swift and strong,&lt;br&gt;The shield-like kuphars bound along;|[[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]}}

==Similar vessels==
The kuphar's similarity to other circular boats has been noted by many authors.&lt;ref name=DeGraeve&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Departement Oriëntalistiek| isbn = 9789070192075| last = De Graeve| first = Marie-Christine | title = The Ships of the Ancient Near East (c. 2000-500 B.C.)| date = 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hornell_1&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1038/143224c0| issn = 1476-4687| volume = 143| issue = 224| last = Hornell| first = James| title = British Coracles and Irish Curraghs: with a Note on the Quffah of Iraq| journal = Nature| accessdate = 2018-06-12| date = 1939-02-11| url = https://www.nature.com/articles/143224c0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not a coincidence: Hornell, Marie-Christine De Graeve, and other ethnographers and [[anthropologist]]s believe that the kuphar is the common ancestor of the coracles that are widely used across Eurasia, particularly in the [[British Isles]] and [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name=Agius /&gt;{{r|DeGraeve|page=85-9}} However, the similar Irish [[currach]] was independently developed by the ancient [[Celts]].&lt;ref name=Hornell_1 /&gt;

==Plot==
A great train robbery takes place near [[Chennai]] and three robbers Jambu ([[Major Sundararajan]]), a Hindu, Joseph ([[R. S. Manohar]]) a Christian and Naseer ([[S. V. Ramadoss]]) a Muslim steal the jewels of the passengers at gunpoint. They continue stealing from various shops and hotels; their atrocities become the talk of the city. The three enter a rich man Prabhakar's ([[Krishna (Telugu actor)|Krishna]]) house, kill everybody and steal the money. They see a young and loving child Geetha (Baby Rani) there and Jambu starts to like her. The other two do not show any affection, but Jambu decides to bring her along with him. The Police arrive but by then the three have escaped with the child. The police find that all the robberies and the killings were carried out by the same set of robbers and announce a reward of Rs.10,000 to anyone who can provide a clue to catch them.{{sfn|G. Dhananjayan|2014|page=202}}

At their hideout, Jambu gets attached to the child, whilst the other two believe the child has come to kill them. But the child, through her loving attitude and respect for their religions, makes the other two also like her. Now, all three believe that the child is God like and give her all the affection they can. Their problem begins when the child does not eat and demands the aaya (maid) to feed her. They try, but the child cries for Aaya Gowri ([[Padmini (actress)|Padmini]]). Left with no choice, Jambu travels to bring her. A Police Inspector ([[S. A. Ashokan]]) is investigating the case and enquires to Gowri about why she, who usually spent every night with the child, left the child alone that specific night. They suspect that she was hand-in-glove with the robbers and keep her in their custody. Jambu comes to know Gowri's address from the two fellow passengers. He meets Gowri's mother as her brother Manickam, convinces everyone that he is their close relative including the police officers and then takes Gowri with him forcefully, jumps off the train and escapes from the police.{{sfn|G. Dhananjayan|2014|page=203}}

Gowri is happy to see the child, but is shaken about being with the robbers who killed her master. She takes care of the child and also cooks and attends to them. She tries to kill them by mixing poison with milk, but they find that out and beat her. She then plans to split them and escape with the child. She tries entice them and Joseph and Naseer fall for it. But Jambu understands her game and puts sense into the other two. Her plan fails again. The three decide that Gowri should be out of the life of the child. So they demand her to behave in a manner that the child shall hate her. She does not agree because she has brought up the child. Jambu gets more attached to the child and it is mutual. He starts believing that the child will live without Gowri and decides to kill her. Gowri overhears this and escapes with the child. However, they soon find out and chase her. The child starts shouting and to make her silent, Gowri shuts her mouth which leads to her wheezing and a heart problem. They catch them and she asks for their help to bring Dr. Ramanathan (T. K. Bhagavathi), who knows the child's health condition. Joseph goes in the disguise of sardar and visits Ramanathan who is at a wedding and convinces him to come with him. The police, who were at the marriage venue find it fishy and follow their car. The police try to shoot and stop them, but Joseph somehow escapes with the doctor.{{sfn|G. Dhananjayan|2014|page=203}}

Joseph and the doctor reach their hideout and Ramanathan understands the dire situation. He attends to the child and stops treating her saying that the child will die anyway. The three beat him, but he refuses to treat the child and says that they will become the reason for the death of the child. The three get emotionally disturbed and beg for his help. He puts up a demand that he will attend to the child only if they agree to surrender to the police for their crimes. The three express their fear of losing the love of the child if they surrender. For this, Ramanathan assures that he will fight for them in the court and also ensure that the child comes and meets them every day. The three agree to surrender and Ramanathan attends to the child. Naseer goes to the city to get medicine. The shopkeeper informs the police and they arrive to catch him, but he manages to escape. Ramanathan treats the child and the three pray for her recovery. Finally, the child recovers and asks for the three uncles instead of Gowri. The three get attached to the child and decide to leave all their wealth behind and move away with her. They get surrounded by a large number of police. The three attack the police courageously. Ramanathan and Gowri manage to escape with the child. Joseph is injured and when they realise that the child has been taken away, they decide to escape somewhere in order to get her back. They manage to escape and hide and police are unable to trace them. Ramanathan convinces the police about the love the three have for the child. The police assure that the child can meet them in jail and also not to shoot them when they surrender. Ramanathan now asks the child to speak in the mike and the child calls for the three uncles. They hear her and surrender to the police. Ramanathan assures to take care of the child and bring her to meet them regularly. The three are arrested by the police and the child follows calling them out.{{sfn|G. Dhananjayan|2014|page=204}}

"'''La Dessalinienne'''" ({{IPA-fr|la dɛs.salinjɛn}}; {{lang-ht|"Desalinyèn"}}; {{lang-en|"The Dessalines Song"}}) is the [[national anthem]] of [[Haiti]]. It was written by [[Justin Lhérisson]] and composed by [[Nicolas Geffrard]].&lt;ref name="ayitihistory"&gt;[http://www.ayitihistory.com/index.htm#patriotic_songs.htm Haitian Patriotic Songs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Music in Latin America and the Caribbean: Volume 2 Performing the Caribbean Experience - An Encyclopedic History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uspTNzJ_NoYC&amp;pg=PA256&amp;lpg=PA256&amp;dq=mini-jazz+haiti+history&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tOsEmlF2Ra&amp;sig=c_XH_piYT3TM5E_STd2npetYftQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=94fYUsyNKvLTsASh6oGQBg&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=mini-jazz%20haiti%20history&amp;f=false|author=Malena Kuss|publisher=The Universe of Music Inc|pages=260|isbn=978-0-292-70951-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
"La Dessalinienne" was named in honor of Haiti's revolutionary leader and first ruler [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RK6TAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=La+Dessalinienne&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z0l3VdyBFYilyASv67HwBQ&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=La%20Dessalinienne&amp;f=false |title=The Garland Handbook of Latin American Music |author1=Olsen, Dale A. |author2=Sheehy, Daniel E. |page=139 |year=2014 |isbn=9780415961011 |accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
To commemorate the 100th anniversary of the [[Haitian Revolution]], a competition was held for a national anthem in 1903. The poetic words of [[Justin Lhérisson]] and martial composition of [[Nicolas Geffrard]] won over the judges, which led to its official adoption as national anthem in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2mJB8hZzjxIC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=La+Dessalinienne&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z0l3VdyBFYilyASv67HwBQ&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=national%20anthem&amp;f=false |title=Historical Dictionary of Haiti |author=Hall, Michael R. |page=182 |year=2012 |isbn=9780810878105 |accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The 1903 premiere of the anthem was sung by [[Auguste de Pradines]], also known as Kandjo.&lt;ref name=averill97&gt;{{cite book|last1=Averill|first1=Gage |title=A day for the hunter, a day for the prey: Popular music and power in Haiti |date=1997 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, Ill.|isbn=9780226032931|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwEL9mUcVA8C}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|47}}

There is a [[Haitian Creole]] version that was created by Raymond A. Moise. Ansy Dérose, a Haitian singer, helped popularize it. Although it became widely accepted, the 1987 Haitian Constitution makes no mention of this particular version.&lt;ref name="ayitihistory" /&gt;

Pou [[Haiti|Ayiti]] peyi Zansèt yo
Se pou nou mache men nan lamen
Nan mitan nou pa fèt pou gen trèt
Nou fèt pou nou sèl mèt tèt nou.
Annou mache men nan lamen
Pou Ayiti ka vin pi bèl
Annou, annou, met tèt ansanm
Pou Ayiti onon tout Zansèt yo.

Pou Ayiti onon Zansèt yo
Se pou nou sekle se pou nou plante
Se nan tè tout fòs nou chita
Se li ki ba nou manje
An bite tè, an voye wou
Ak kè kontan, fòk tè a bay
Sekle, wouze, fanm tankou gason
Pou nou rive viv ak sèl fòs ponyèt nou.

Pou Ayiti ak pou Zansèt yo
Fò nou kapab vanyan gason
Moun pa fèt pou ret ak moun
Se sa ki fè tout manman ak tout papa
Dwe pou voye timoun yo lekòl
Pou yo aprann, pou yo konnen
Sa [[Toussaint Louverture|Toussaint]], [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines|Dessalines]], [[Henri Christophe|Christophe]], [[Alexandre Pétion|Pétion]]
Te fè pou wet Ayisyen anba kòd blan.

Pou Ayiti onon Zansèt yo
Ann leve tèt nou gad anlè
Pou tout moun mande Granmèt la
Pou li ba nou pwoteksyon
Pou move zanj pa detounen n
Pou nou ka mache nan bon chimen
Pou libète ka libète
Fòk lajistis blayi sou peyi a!

Nou gen drapo tankou tout pèp
Se pou nou renmen li mouri pou li
Se pa kado blan te fè nou
Se san Zansèt nou yo ki te koule
Pou nou kenbe drapo nou wo
Se pou nou travay met tèt ansanm.
Pou lòt peyi ka respekte li
Drapo sila a se nanm tout Ayisyen.
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
For Haiti, the Country of the Ancestors
We must walk hand in hand
There must not be traitors among us
We must be ourselves's unique master.
Let's walk hand in hand
For Haiti can be more beautiful.
Let us put our heads together
To Haiti on behalf of all her ancestors.

For Haiti on the behalf of the Ancestors
Let us mow, let us sow
Let us sit in the soil's strength
It has given us food
In stumbled ground sends wheels 
With joy must provide ground 
Mow, water, women and men
Must we come to live only by our arms' strength.

For Haiti and for the Ancestors
We must be courageous
People are not born to serve others
That is why all mothers and all fathers
Need to send children to school
To learn to know
What Toussaint, Dessalines, Christophe, Petion
Did to take Haitians from under the white's rope.

For Haiti on the behalf of the Ancestors
Let us raise our head and look above
For everyone to ask the Lord
To grant us protection
For bad angels we diverted
For we will march in the right path
For liberty be liberty
May justice spread over the country!

We have a flag like all people
Let us love it, die for it
It was not a gift from the whites
It was our Ancestors blood that was shed
To hold our flag high
Let us work together and focus
For other countries to respect it
This flag is the soul of every Haitian.
&lt;/poem&gt;

'''Law Codex of Vinodol''' or '''Vinodol [[statute]]''' ({{lang-hr|Vinodolski zakonik}}) is one of the oldest law texts written in the [[Chakavian dialect]] of [[Croatian language]] and is among the oldest Slavic [[Code (law)|code]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Russkaya Pravda]] is the only older code in Slavdom.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brozyna |first1=Martha A. |title= Gender and Sexuality in the Middle Ages: A Medieval Source Documents Reader

It was originally compiled in 1288 by a commission of 42 members in [[Novi Vinodolski]], a town on the Adriatic Sea coast in [[Croatia]], located south of Crikvenica, Selce and Bribir and north of Senj. However, the codex itself is preserved in a 16th-century copy.

== The statute==
A paragraph was set to define the relation between the [[duke]]s and the [[peasantry]] of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dvornik |first1=Francis|title= The Slavs in European History and Civilization
|trans-title=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LACpYP-g1y8C&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=vinodol+statute&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rtxiUo2AAuet4ASV1IHwBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vinodol%20statute&amp;f=false|accessdate=2013-10-18 |volume = |year=1962 |publisher= Rutgers University Press |location= |isbn= 0813507995|page=139 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the oldest among all Croatian city statutes, which represented an agreement between the people of Vinodol and their new liege lords, the [[Principality of Krk|Princes of Krk]]. It contains important information about the feudal law in this area which had replaced the tribal customs of an earlier period. The Vinodol Statute provides a rare contemporary picture of the life and political conditions in [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]]. The oldest regulations concerning public health in western Croatia are preserved within the Vinodol Statute. Today, it is stored in the [[National and University Library Zagreb]].

The Vinodol Statute confirms status of the Vinodol as an administrative and political center from the 13th century. The text of the statute is preserved as a copy from the 16th century.

== Editions ==
The first printed edition was prepared in 1843 by [[Antun Mažuranić]] in the third yearly volume of the journal ''[[Kolo (journal)|Kolo]]''. [[Osip Bodyansky]] translated it in 1846 to [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Anna Mikhailovna Evreinova]] edited the 1878 edition in [[Saint Petersburg]], with facsimile of the original as well as Latin and Cyrillic transliteration. [[Vatroslav Jagić]] published it in 1880, both the original and a Russian translation with philological and legal commentary. [[Wacław Maciejowski]] translated it in 1856 to [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Jules Preux]] translated it in 1896 to [[French language|French]], [[Mark Kostrenčić]] translated it in 1931 to [[German language|German]] and [[Lujo Margetić]] translated it in 1981/1982 to [[Italian language|Italian]],  and in 1983 to [[English language|English]]. [[Josip Bratulić]] edited the 1988 facsimile edition with commentary and a dictionary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7769">[[File:Lieber-R-Lillian.jpg|thumb|Lillian R. Lieber (1886 &amp;ndash; 1986)]]
'''Lillian Rosanoff  Lieber''' (July 26, 1886 in [[Mykolaiv|Nicolaiev]], [[Russian Empire]] - July 11, 1986 in [[Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]]) was a Russian-American mathematician and popular author.&lt;ref name="jantzen"&gt;[http://www34.homepage.villanova.edu/robert.jantzen/lieber/ "Robert Jantzen's webpage on Lieber"]&lt;/ref&gt; She often teamed up with her illustrator husband, [[Hugh Gray Lieber]], to produce works.

==Life and career==

===Early life and education===
Lieber was one of four children of Clara and Abraham Rosenberg. Her brothers were Denver publisher Joseph Rosenberg, psychiatrist [[Aaron Rosanoff]], and chemist [[Martin André Rosanoff]]. Aaron and Martin changed their names to sound more Russian, less Jewish.&lt;ref name="dry"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120921065948/http://pauldrybooks.com/lieber.php "Paul Dry, Publisher of her reissued books"]&lt;/ref&gt; Lieber moved to the US with her family in 1891. She received her BA from [[Barnard College]] in 1908, her MA from [[Columbia University]] in 1911, and her PhD from [[Clark University]] in 1914. She married [[Hugh Gray Lieber]] in 1926.

===Career===
After teaching at [[Wells College]] and the [[Connecticut College|Connecticut College for Women]], she joined the mathematics department at [[Long Island University]] (LIU) in 1934, became department chair in 1945, and was made a full professor in 1947; she was at LIU and the [[Galois Institute of Mathematics and Art]] in [[Brooklyn]], New York until her retirement in 1954.&lt;ref name="jantzen"/&gt; Over her career she published some 17 books, which were written in a unique, free-verse style and illustrated with whimsical line drawings by her husband. Her highly accessible writings were praised by no less than [[Albert Einstein]], C. J. Keyser, [[Eric Temple Bell|E. T. Bell]], and [[S. I. Hayakawa]]. Concerning her book, ''[[The Education of T. C. MITS]]'', [[Dorothy Canfield Fisher]] said:

&lt;p style="background:#eeeeff;padding:15px;"&gt;"This is quite different from any other book you ever bought... full of mathematics and full of humor... also full of a deep, healing philosophy of life, reassuring, strengthening, [and] humane..."&lt;ref name="bookjacket"&gt;Bookjacket of the 1944 W. W. Norton Edition of ''The Education of T. C. MITS''&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Although Lieber retired from Long Island University in 1954, she continued to write and publish into the 1960s.

===Personal obscurity===
Few details of Lillian Lieber's life and career have survived, even at Long Island University. She died in Queens, New York just weeks shy of her 100th birthday. She came from a well-educated Jewish family.  Details can be found in the out of print book "Yesterday"  that was written by her cousin [[Miriam Shomer Zunser]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="jantzen"/&gt;

==Unusual typography==
In addition to enlivening her books with illustrations by her husband, Hugh Gray Lieber (who was head of the Department of Fine Arts at Long Island University), Lillian often chose an unusual scheme of typography which is self-explained in this example from her Preface to ''The Education of T. C. MITS'':

&lt;p style="background:#eeeeff;padding:15px;"&gt;This is not intended to be&lt;br&gt;free verse.&lt;br&gt;Writing each phrase on a separate line&lt;br&gt;facilitates rapid reading,&lt;br&gt;and everyone&lt;br&gt;is in a hurry&lt;br&gt;nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;

[[T.C. Mits|T.C. MITS]] was an acronym for "The Celebrated Man In The Street," a character who, like [[George Gamow]]'s  [[Mr. Tompkins]], served as a device for bringing concepts in higher mathematics and physics to the general public. The MITS character was central to Lieber's populist approach to education, and she often laced her expositions with passages extolling the virtues of the democratic system.

=="The Lillian Lieber Standard"==
In her book, ''The Einstein Theory of Relativity'', Lillian Lieber stated her views on the inclusion of mathematics in books intended for "the celebrated man [or woman] in the streets:"

&lt;p style="background:#eeeeff;padding:15px;"&gt;"...just enough mathematics to HELP and NOT to HINDER the lay reader... Many 'popular' discussions of Relativity without any math at all have been written, but we doubt whether even the best of these can possibly give to a novice an adequate idea of what it is all about.... On the other hand, there are many [books on relativity] that are accessible to experts only."&lt;/p&gt;

The Cavendish Press in Ann Arbor, Michigan, has adopted Lillian's rule of thumb with some elaboration.&lt;ref name="cavendish"&gt;Cavendish Press Web Site, elaboration of the [http://www.cavendishscience.org/bks/rel/math.htm Lillian Lieber Standard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212154014/http://www.cavendishscience.org/bks/rel/math.htm |date=2007-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Although her works were broadly influential (including a special paperback edition of ''The Education of T. C. MITS'' that was circulated to American servicemen during World War II), they remained out of print for decades. Starting in 2007, publisher Paul Dry has reissued ''The Education of T.C. MITS'', ''Infinity'', and ''The Einstein Theory of Relativity''.&lt;ref name="dry" /&gt;

The '''miner's apron''' ({{lang-de|Arschleder}}, ''Bergleder'' or ''Fahrleder'') is part of the clothing worn, especially historically,  by [[miner]]s in the [[mining]] industries of German-speaking Europe. Variously called in English a miner's apron,&lt;ref name="Bucksch"/&gt; a miner's after-apron,&lt;ref&gt;Ebers, John (1796).

''New and Complete Dictionary of the German Language for Englishmen'', Vol. 1, Schwickertsche Verlage, Leipzig, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ciba-Geigy review, Volume 12, Issues 133-141, p. 154, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; or miner's leather apron,&lt;ref&gt;Pohs, Henry A. (1995). ''The miner's flame light book'', Flame Pub. Co., pp. 107 and 119.&lt;/ref&gt; it was a leather apron that served to keep the seat of the trousers from wearing out when working or moving around the mine (''Fahrung'') as well as keeping out the cold and moisture when sitting. It also provided protection especially when entering inclined [[shaft mining|mineshaft]]s. Another advantage was that it stabilised the internal organs from mechanical shock and vibration by acting as a sort of [[kidney belt]]. The miner's apron was a triangular or, more rarely, semi-circular piece of leather and was supported by the [[belt (clothing)|body belt]]. In Germany the design of the modern miner's apron is governed by DIN standard 23307 ''Gesäßleder für den Bergbau (Arschleder)''.

== History ==
The mining apron was introduced to German mining regions in the 15th century from the [[Slovakia]]n mining area around [[Banská Štiavnica|Schemnitz]] (Banská Štiavnica). Early illustrations of it are found on the title page of the "Little Mining Book" (''Bergbüchlein'') by [[Ulrich Rülein von Calw]] (1505) and on the [[St. Anne's Church, Annaberg-Buchholz#Miners' altar|miner's altar of St. Anne's Church in Annaberg]] (1521). [[Georgius Agricola]] wrote in this book ''De re metallica'' (1556):{{quotation|So sat the miners on their aprons, which were tied around their loins, and hung down behind them. &lt;br /&gt;
(''So sitzend die Berghäwer auf ihr Arsleder, das um die Lenden gebunden, dahinter herabhanget.'')}}

Permission to wear the miner's apron was only granted to miners and mining officials. Analogous to the [[hammer and chisel]], it represented a unifying symbol of miners' status. Later, it was also worn outside work in decorative styles as part of the [[miner's uniform]] (''Berghabit'') or parade uniform (''Paradeuniform'') for [[miners' parade]]s (''Bergparaden''). In events connected with mining [[customs]], this device is also used for the so-called "leather jump" (''Ledersprung''), a form of miners' initiation ceremony in Austria.

== Folk art and music ==
The apron of the miner is incorporated into the design of the wooden [[smoking figurine]]s and [[nutcracker]]s made in the [[Ore Mountains]]. It has also made its way into the mining songs. Thus we read in the last stanza of the version of the mine foremen's song (''Steigerlied'') sung in the [[Ruhr]] and [[Saarland|Saar]]: {{quotation|The mining folk are terribly good folk&lt;br /&gt;because they wear the leather over their bum at night&lt;br /&gt;because they wear the leather over their bum at night&lt;br /&gt;and drink ''[[schnaps]]'', and drink ''schnaps''.&lt;br /&gt;
''Die Bergleut sein kreuzbrave Leut’&lt;br /&gt;denn sie tragen das Leder vor dem Arsch bei der Nacht&lt;br /&gt;denn sie tragen das Leder vor dem Arsch bei der Nacht&lt;br /&gt;und saufen Schnaps, und saufen Schnaps.''}}

== Similar uses ==
In [[Kite|stunt kite flying]] the leather apron is used especially in [[power kiting]] or [[kite surfing]] using powered kites. The pilot sits on a leather apron that protects the seat of his trousers and is hauled by the kite over rough ground (e.g., pastureland).

[[File:Internationale Kunstausstellung Muenchen 1897.jpg|thumb|315px|Poster by [[Franz von Stuck]] for the Seventh International Art Exhibition in Munich, 1897]]
The '''Munich Secession''' was an association of visual artists who broke away from the mainstream Munich Artists' Association in 1892, to promote and defend their art in the face of what they considered official paternalism and its conservative policies. They acted as a form of [[cooperative]], using their influence to assure their economic survival and obtain commissions. In 1901, the association split again when some dissatisfied members formed the group [[Phalanx (art group)|Phalanx]]. Another split occurred in 1913, with the founding of the "New Munich Secession".

== Background ==
[[File:Franz von Lenbach.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Franz von Lenbach, the "Prince of Painters". From ''[[Die Gartenlaube]]'', c.1900]]
By the end of the Nineteenth Century, more artists lived in Munich than lived in Vienna and Berlin put together. However, the art community there was dominated by the conservative attitudes of the Munich Artists' Association and its supporters in the government. These attitudes found expression in the official "mission statements", written by the so-called "Prince of Painters" (Malerfürst) [[Franz von Lenbach]]. Matters came to a head in 1891 when the Prince-Regent  [[Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria|Luitpold of Bavaria]] founded the ''Prinzregent-Luitpold-Stiftung zur Förderung der Kunst, des Kunstgewerbes und des Handwerks in München'', an art foundation devoted to promoting traditional [[history painting]] in the service of the state. This foundation created and maintained a high level of artistic quality and brought world attention to the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Academy of Fine Arts]], but was firmly opposed to [[impressionism]], [[expressionism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] and other contemporary trends in the art world.

Another factor was the complete financial failure of an exhibition in 1888 at the [[Glaspalast (Munich)|Glaspalast]], organized by the Artists' Association. This led to a bitter debate about responsibility and the exhibition's content which grew so furious, it attracted the attention of the Ministry of State for Science and Art.&lt;ref&gt;Rita Hummel: ''Die Anfänge der Münchener Secession''. Schriften aus dem Institut für Kunstgeschichte der Universität München, Vol. 46, {{ZDB|57236-6}}. Tuduv-Verlags-Gesellschaft, München 1989, {{ISBN|3-88073-345-7}}. (based on a thesis for the [[University of Munich]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

To address this situation, a group of artists with a progressive outlook gathered together in 1892, announced their separation from the official Artists' Association and established the Munich Secession, with an eye toward exhibiting at the upcoming [[World's Columbian Exposition]]. They called for a transformation in the ideas of what constitutes art and promoted the idea of an artists' freedom to present works directly to the public.

{{Zitat|"''Man soll auf unseren Ausstellungen Kunst sehen und jedes Talent, ob älterer oder neuerer Richtung, dessen Werke München zur Ehre gereichen, soll seine Blüte reich entfalten können''." (One should see, in our exhibitions, every form of art, whether old or new, which will redound to the glory of Munich, whose art will be allowed to develop to its full flowering)}}

In this statement of principles, the artists declared their intentions to move away from outmoded principles and a conservative conception of what art is.&lt;ref&gt;Clelia Segieth: ''Memorandum des Vereins Bildender Künstler Münchens''. In: Buhrs, Best: ''Secession 1892–1914'', S.&amp;nbsp;20–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foundation ==
[[File:Bruno-piglhein.jpg|thumb|150px|Bruno Piglhein, first President of the Secession]]
On April 4, 1892, ninety-six artists who had resigned from the official Association, established the ''Association of Visual Artists of Munich''. [[Bruno Piglhein]] was elected the first President and [[Paul Hoecker]] became the first Secretary. In a few months the original name gave way to the more popular name: ''Munich Secession''.

Financial support initially came from three sources: [[Georg Hirth]], a writer and journalist who coined the word "secession" to describe the spirit of the various art movements at that time. In 1896, he would establish the [[Art-Nouveau]] magazine ''[[Jugend (magazine)|Jugend]]'' ; [[Georg von Vollmar]], editor of the [[Democratic socialism|Democratic Socialist]] party's official organ ; and Hans Viet, Graf von Toerring-Jettenbach (1862-1929), a member of the liberal opposition to the government's policies.

That same year saw the creation of another breakaway association, the ''{{ill|Luitpold-Gruppe|de}}'', composed of more moderate artists who wanted to maintain the high-quality standards of the Academy. The [[Vienna Secession]] followed five years later, and the [[Berlin Secession]] was established in 1898.

== Exhibitions ==
[[File:Ausstellungspalast, Berlin 1885.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The National Exhibition Building (ULAP), c.1885]]
At first, the Secession had some difficulty finding a building for their exhibitions. The city of Frankfurt offered to provide the necessary space and 500,000 [[German gold mark|Gold Marks]], if the group would move there permanently.&lt;ref name="Helmut Kästl"&gt;Helmut Kästl: [http://www.muenchenersecession.de/hist.php ''Historisches zur Münchener Secession''.] In: ''muenchenersecession.de'', abgerufen am 22. Juni 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Their first exhibition actually took place at Berlin's "National Exhibition Building" (now known as "[[Universum Landes-Ausstellungs-Park|ULAP]]") early in 1893.

Baurat (city construction supervisor) Franz von Brandl provided the Secession with some free land at the corner of [[Prinzregentenstraße (Munich)|Prinzregentenstraße]] and Pilotystraße. Construction began immediately and their debut exhibition took place on July 16, 1893, in the first portion of the building to be completed. Over 4,000 visitors came to see 876 works by 297 artists.

The success of this effort eventually allowed them to come to an agreement with Franz von Lenbach and the Artists' Association. As a result, the art exhibition building on the [[Königsplatz, Munich|Königsplatz]] (now the [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]]) was transferred to the Secession in 1897.

== Later history ==
In 1933, the [[National Socialist]] party began their crusade to bring all forms of artistic expression under their control: a process known as [[Gleichschaltung]] (bringing into line). Artists were eventually required to obtain state endorsement for all of their works. Those who were considered "[[Degenerate art|degenerate]]" were not allowed to paint.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hermann Glaser]]: ''Wie Hitler den deutschen Geist zerstörte. Kulturpolitik im Dritten Reich''. Ellert&amp;nbsp;&amp; Richter, Hamburg 2005, {{ISBN|3-8319-0227-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, the Munich Secession was dissolved as part of the "Kulturellen Säuberung" ([[cultural cleansing]]) process.

Following the end of World War II in 1946, the ''{{ill|Neue Gruppe|de}}'' and the ''Neue Münchner Künstlergenossenschaft'' (New Munich Artists' Association) were founded and led to the establishment of the ''Bundesverband Bildender Künstlerinnen und Künstler'' (Federal Association of Visual Artists).

In 1992, the Secession celebrated its centennial and, in March of the following year, the ''Society of Friends and Sponsors of the Munich Secession'' was created to support the Secession's continuing goals, maintain the "Secessionsgalerie" and promote exhibitions.

'''''My Own Private Idaho''''' is a 1991 American [[independent film|independent]] [[adventure film|adventure]] [[drama (film and television)|drama]] film written and directed by [[Gus Van Sant]], loosely based on [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'', ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'', and ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', and starring [[River Phoenix]] and [[Keanu Reeves]]. The story follows two friends, Mike and Scott, as they embark on a journey of personal discovery that takes them from [[Portland, Oregon]] to Mike's hometown in [[Idaho]], and then to [[Rome]] in search of Mike's mother.

Van Sant originally wrote the screenplay in the 1970s, but discarded it after reading [[John Rechy]]'s 1963 novel ''[[City of Night]]'' and concluding that Rechy's treatment of the subject of street hustlers was better than his own. Over the years, Van Sant rewrote the script, which comprised two stories: that of Mike and the search for his mother, and Scott's story as a modern update of the ''Henry IV'' plays. Van Sant had difficulty getting Hollywood financing, and at one point considered making the film on a minuscule budget with a cast of actual street kids. After Van Sant sent copies of his script to Reeves and then Reeves showed it to Phoenix, both agreed to star in the film on each other's behalf.

''My Own Private Idaho'' had its premiere at the [[48th Venice International Film Festival]], and received largely positive reviews from critics including [[Roger Ebert]] and those of ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. The film was a moderate financial success, grossing over $6.4 million in North America, which was above its estimated budget of $2.5 million. Phoenix received several awards for his performance in the film, including the [[Venice Film Festival#Volpi Cup best actor|Volpi Cup for Best Actor]] at the 1991 Venice Film Festival, [[Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead|Best Male Lead]] from the [[Independent Spirit Awards]], and [[National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] from the [[National Society of Film Critics]].

''My Own Private Idaho'' is considered a landmark film in the [[New Queer Cinema]] movement, an early 1990s movement in [[queer]]-themed [[independent film]]making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Nathan|title=Twenty-five years of New Queer Cinema|work=[[Times Higher Education]]|date=February 5, 2015|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/culture/twenty-five-years-of-new-queer-cinema/2018251.article|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its 1991 release, the film has grown in popularity and been deemed as a [[cult film|cult classic]], especially among queer audiences.

[[Mikey Waters|Mike]], a [[Male prostitution|street hustler]], is standing alone on a deserted stretch of highway. He starts talking to himself and notices that the road looks "like someone’s face, like a fucked-up face." He experiences a [[Narcolepsy|narcoleptic]] episode and dreams of his mother comforting him as he replays home movies of his childhood in his mind.

Later, after being [[Fellatio|fellated]] by a client in [[Seattle]], Mike returns to his favorite spots to pick up potential clients. He is picked up by a wealthy older woman who takes him to her mansion where he meets two fellow hustlers also hired by the woman. One of them is Scott Favor, Mike's best friend, and the other is Gary. While preparing to have sex with the woman, Mike experiences another narcoleptic fit and awakens the next day with Scott in [[Portland, Oregon]].

Mike and Scott are soon reunited with Bob Pigeon, a middle-aged mentor to a gang of street kids and hustlers who live in an abandoned apartment building. Scott, the son of the mayor of Portland, admits to Bob in private that when he turns 21, he will inherit his father's fortune and retire from street hustling. Mike yearns to find his mother, and he and Scott leave Portland for Idaho to visit Mike's older brother Richard, who lives in a run-down trailer. Along this journey Mike confesses that he is in love with Scott, who gently reminds Mike he only has sex with men for money and that he does not believe two men can love each other. Richard tries to tell Mike who his real father is, but Mike says that he knows it is Richard. Richard tells Mike that their mother works as a hotel maid; when Mike and Scott visit the hotel, they find she has gone to Italy in search of her own family. At the hotel, they meet Hans, the man who drove them to Portland. Mike and Scott prostitute themselves to Hans, and the three sleep together.

With the money they received from Hans, Mike and Scott travel to Italy. They find the country farmhouse where Mike's mother worked as a maid and as an English tutor. The young woman, Carmella, who lives there, tells Mike that his mother returned to the United States months ago. Carmella and Scott fall in love and return to the U.S., leaving Mike to return home on his own, brokenhearted. Scott's father dies, and Scott inherits his fortune.

Back in Portland, Bob and his gang confront a newly reformed Scott at a fashionable restaurant, but he rejects them. That night Bob has a fatal heart attack. The next day the hustlers hold a rowdy funeral for Bob, while in the same cemetery, a few yards away, Scott attends a solemn funeral for his father. Mike is back on the deserted stretch of the Idaho highway. After his falling into another narcoleptic stupor, two strangers pull up in a truck, take his backpack and shoes, and drive away. Moments later, an unidentified figure pulls up in a car, picks the unconscious Mike up, places him in the vehicle and drives away.

==Development==
The origins of ''My Own Private Idaho'' came from [[John Rechy]]'s 1963 novel, ''[[City of Night]]'', which featured characters who were street hustlers who did not admit to being gay.&lt;ref name= "Fuller"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fuller|first=Graham|title=[[Gus Van Sant]]: Swimming Against the Current|work=Even Cowgirls Get the Blues and My Own Private Idaho|pages=xxi|publisher=[[Faber &amp; Faber]]|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Sant's original screenplay was written in the 1970s, when he was living in [[Hollywood]].&lt;ref name="Fuller2"&gt;Fuller 1993, p. xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; After reading Rechy's book, Van Sant realized that it was considerably better than what he was writing, so he shelved the script for years. In 1988, while editing ''[[Mala Noche]]'', Van Sant met a street kid named Michael Parker who became a source of inspiration for the character of Mike in what would later become ''My Own Private Idaho''.&lt;ref name= "Fuller2"/&gt; Parker also had a friend named Scott, a street kid like himself. In the script, Van Sant adapted the Scott character to that of a rich kid. The character of Scott was also fashioned after people Van Sant had met in Portland who were street hustlers.&lt;ref name= "Fuller2"/&gt;

Early drafts of the screenplay were set on [[Hollywood Boulevard]], not Portland, with working titles such as ''Blue Funk'' and ''Minions of the Moon''.&lt;ref name= "Elder, Sean"&gt;{{cite news|last=Elder|first=Sean|title=Young Actors Go Wild with [[Gus Van Sant]]|work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]|date=October 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reading Rechy's novel had convinced Van Sant to change the setting to Portland.&lt;ref name= "Ehrenstein, David"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ehrenstein|first=David|title=Back to Idaho|work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|date=April 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The script originally consisted of two separate scenarios: the first was called ''Modern Days'' and it recounted Mike's story; a second one updated the ''Henry IV'' plays with Scott's story.&lt;ref name= "Lyons, Donald"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lyons|first=Donald|title=Independent Visions|publisher=Ballatine Books|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Sant realized that he could blend the two stories together in the manner of the "cut up" technique used by writer [[William S. Burroughs]].&lt;ref name= "Lyons, Donald"/&gt; In essence, this method involves various story fragments and ideas mixed and matched together to form a unique story. The idea to combine the two scenarios formed in Van Sant's mind after watching [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[Chimes at Midnight]]''.&lt;ref name= "Lyons, Donald"/&gt; The director remembers, "I thought that the ''Henry IV'' plays were really a street story. I also knew this fat guy named Bob, who had always reminded me of [[Sir John Falstaff|Falstaff]] and who was crazy about hustler boys". Van Sant realized that Prince Hal in the plays resembled the character of Scott and the sidekick was Mike. His script ended up becoming a literal restructuring of the ''Henry IV'' plays.&lt;ref name="Fuller3"&gt;Fuller 1993, p. xxv.&lt;/ref&gt; Van Sant got the idea for Mike's narcolepsy from a man who was a guide of sorts when the director was gathering material for the film. According to the director, he always looked like he was about to fall asleep.&lt;ref name= "Bowen, Peter"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bowen|first=Peter|title=His Own Private Idaho|work = Off-Hollywood Report|date=Fall 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's title is derived from the song "[[Private Idaho (song)|Private Idaho]]" by [[the B-52's]] that Van Sant heard while visiting the state in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name= "Greenberg, Harvey"&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenberg|first=Harvey|title=''My Own Private Idaho''|work=Film Quarterly|date=Fall 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Sant showed the script to an executive at [[20th Century Fox]] who liked Shakespeare.&lt;ref name= "Fuller3" /&gt; Eventually, he toned down the Shakespeare and made the language more modern. Van Sant was also working on a short story called "My Own Private Idaho" which he intended to film. It was 25 pages long and was about two Latino characters on the streets of Portland who go in search of their parents and travel to a town in Spain. One of them falls in love with a girl and leaves the other behind.&lt;ref name="Fuller3"&gt;Fuller 1993, p. xxv.&lt;/ref&gt; Van Sant had another script called ''The Boys of Storytown'', which had the Mike and Scott characters and Mike had narcolepsy. The characters of Hans and Bob were also present. Van Sant wanted to make the film but felt that the script was not finished.&lt;ref name="Fuller4"&gt;Fuller 1993, p. xxvi.&lt;/ref&gt; While editing ''[[Drugstore Cowboy]]'', Van Sant combined the scripts for ''Modern Days'' and ''Storytown'' with the "Idaho" short story.&lt;ref name= "Fuller4" /&gt;

Initially, no studio would finance the film because of its potentially controversial and off-beat subject matter. After ''Drugstore Cowboy'' received favorable critical raves and awards, studios started to show some interest.&lt;ref name= "Greenberg, Harvey"/&gt; However, they all wanted their own versions made and not Van Sant's. This frustration prompted the filmmaker to attempt the feature on a shoestring budget with a cast of actual street kids filling out the roles including Michael Parker and actor Rodney Harvey, who was going to play Scott.&lt;ref name= "Fuller4" /&gt;

Van Sant faced the problem of casting the two central roles. He decided to send the script to the agents of [[Keanu Reeves]] and [[River Phoenix]], figuring that their agents would reject the script.&lt;ref name="Robb, Brian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=[[River Phoenix]]: A Short Life|publisher=Perennial|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reeves' agent was amenable to the project, but Phoenix's agent would not even show the screenplay to the young actor.&lt;ref name= "Greenberg, Harvey" /&gt; Not to be deterred, Van Sant got the idea for Reeves to personally deliver the film's treatment to Phoenix at his home in Florida.&lt;ref name= "Robb, Brian" /&gt; Reeves did so over the Christmas holidays, riding his 1974 Norton Commando motorcycle from his family home in Canada to the Phoenix family ranch in Micanopy, Florida, outside Gainesville.&lt;ref name= "Robb, Brian" /&gt; Reeves was no stranger to [[River Phoenix]] or members of his family, having worked previously with River on [[Lawrence Kasdan]]'s ''[[I Love You to Death]]'' and with his brother [[Joaquin Phoenix|Joaquin]] and girlfriend [[Martha Plimpton]] on [[Ron Howard]]'s ''[[Parenthood (1989 film)|Parenthood]]''. After reading the treatment, Phoenix agreed to play the role of Scott. However, since Van Sant had already cast Reeves in the role, they had to convince River to take on the edgier role of drug-addicted hustler Mike Waters. The director promised not to make either actor do anything embarrassing.&lt;ref name= "Block, Adam"&gt;{{cite news|last=Block|first=Adam|title=Inside Outsider [[Gus Van Sant]]|work=The Advocate|date=September 24, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Sant got an offer of $2 million from an outside investor but when he put off production for nine months so that Phoenix could make ''[[Dogfight (film)|Dogfight]]'', the investor and his money disappeared.&lt;ref name="Fuller6"&gt;Fuller 1993, p. xxxvi.&lt;/ref&gt; Producer Laurie Parker shopped the script around and, at the time, [[New Line Cinema]] was in the process of branching out into producing [[arthouse]] films and decided to back Van Sant's vision with a US$2.5 million budget.&lt;ref name= "Greenberg, Harvey" /&gt; In an interview in March 2012, [[Kiefer Sutherland]] said that he declined the offer by Gus Van Sant to star in the lead role because he wanted to go skiing, a decision he has said he regrets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.contactmusic.com/kiefer-sutherland/news/kiefer-sutherland-turned-down-my-own-private-idaho-to-go-skiing_1302396|title= Kiefer Sutherland turned down the lead role in My Own Private Idaho to go skiing|publisher= [[Contactmusic.com]]| access-date= 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principal photography===
Principal photography took place from November to December 1990, primarily in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Seattle]] and [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=My Own Private Idaho|work=[[AFI Catalog of Feature Films]]|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/58952|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scenes of the Idaho road depicted in the film were shot near [[Maupin, Oregon]] on [[Oregon Route 216]]. Phoenix arrived in Portland two weeks before principal photography was to begin in order to do research and Van Sant remembered, "He seemed to be changing into this character".&lt;ref name= "PremiereMag"&gt;{{cite news|title=A Brief Life|work=[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]|date=March 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the film's directors of photography Eric Alan Edwards recalled that the actor looked like a street kid", and "in a very raw way he wore that role. I've never seen anybody so intent on living his role".&lt;ref name= "PremiereMag" /&gt; Several cast and crew members, including Michael Parker, Phoenix, Reeves and Flea lived together in a house in Portland during filming. A couple of times a week they would play music together. Due to the low budget, a typical day of shooting started at 6 am and ended at 11 pm.&lt;ref name= "PremiereMag" /&gt;

The film was not [[storyboard]]ed and was made without a shot list.&lt;ref name="Fuller5"&gt;Fuller 1993, p. xxxiv.&lt;/ref&gt; The camp fire scene was originally a short, three-page scene&lt;ref name= "Fuller5" /&gt; that Phoenix re-wrote into an eight-page scene where Mike professes his love for Scott so that it was more apparent that his character was gay whereas Van Sant had originally made it more ambiguous.&lt;ref name= "Robb, Brian" /&gt; Reeves reportedly was not comfortable with this aspect of the film as he said in an interview, "I'm not against gays or anything, but I won't have sex with guys. I would never do that on film. We did a little of it in ''Idaho'' and, believe me, it was hard work. Never again".&lt;ref name= "Robb, Brian" /&gt;

Eric Edwards shot the [[time-lapse photography]] shots on his own.&lt;ref name="Fuller8"&gt;Fuller 1993, p. xxxix.&lt;/ref&gt; They were not in the script and the film's producer was worried that he was using up too much film. Van Sant originally had the screen go black when Mike passed out but was not satisfied with this approach. He used Edwards' footage as a way of "an altered sense of time" from Mike's perspective.&lt;ref name= "Fuller8" /&gt; Some executives at New Line were not in favor of the Shakespeare scenes and wanted Van Sant to cut them all out. However, foreign distributors wanted as much Shakespeare in the film as possible.&lt;ref name="Fuller7"&gt;Fuller 1993, p. xxxviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
{{Anchor|Reviews|Critics}}
Van Sant's film achieved critical acclaim. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote, "The achievement of this film is that it wants to evoke that state of drifting need, and it does. There is no mechanical plot that has to grind to a Hollywood conclusion, and no contrived test for the heroes to pass."&lt;ref name= "Ebert"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ebert |first=Roger |title=''My Own Private Idaho'' |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=October 18, 1991 |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19911018/REVIEWS/110180303/1023 |accessdate=2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In his review for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, [[Peter Travers]] wrote, "Van Sant's cleareyed, unsentimental approach to a plot that pivots on betrayal and death is reflected in magnetic performances from Reeves and Phoenix."&lt;ref name= "Travers"&gt;{{cite news|last=Travers |first=Peter |title=''My Own Private Idaho'' |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=October 17, 1991 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5948985/review/5948986/my_own_private_idaho |accessdate=2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vincent Canby]], in his ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' review, praised the lead actors: "The performances, especially by the two young stars, are as surprising as they are sure. Mr. Phoenix (''[[Dogfight (film)|Dogfight]]'') and Mr. Reeves (of the two ''Bill and Ted'' comedies) are very fine in what may be the two best roles they'll find in years. Roles of this density, for young actors, do not come by that often".&lt;ref name= "Canby"&gt;{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |title=A Road Movie About Male Hustlers |work=[[New York Times]] |date=September 27, 1991 |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&amp;res=9D0CEFDE153CF934A1575AC0A967958260&amp;oref=slogin |accessdate=2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In his review for ''[[Newsweek]]'', [[David Ansen]] praised Phoenix's performance: "The campfire scene in which Mike awkwardly declares his unrequited love for Scott is a marvel of delicacy. In this, and every scene, Phoenix immerses himself so deeply inside his character you almost forget you've seen him before: it's a stunningly sensitive performance, poignant and comic at once."&lt;ref name= "Ansen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ansen |first=David |title=Turning Shakespearean Tricks |work=[[Newsweek]] |date=October 7, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film an "A−" rating and [[Owen Gleiberman]] wrote, "When Van Sant shows us speeded-up images of clouds rolling past wheat fields, the familiar device transcends cliche, because it's tied to the way that Mike, in his benumbed isolation, experiences his own life – as a running piece of surrealism. The sheer, expressive beauty of those images haunted me for days."&lt;ref name= "Gleiberman"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gleiberman |first=Owen |title=''My Own Private Idaho'' |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=October 11, 1991 |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,315771,00.html |accessdate=2009-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. Hoberman]], in his review for ''[[The Village Voice]]'', wrote, "While Phoenix vanishes with reckless triumph into his role, Reeves stands, or occasionally struts, uneasily beside his, unable to project even the self-mocking wit of [[Matt Dillon]]'s star turn in ''[[Drugstore Cowboy]]''."&lt;ref name= "Hoberman"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoberman |first=J |title=''My Own Private Idaho'' |work=[[Village Voice]] |date=October 1, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hal Hinson from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote "Gus Van Sant's sensibility is wholly original, wholly fresh. My Own Private Idaho adds a new ingredient: a kind of boho sweetness. I loved it."&lt;ref name = "Ryll 2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gay-themed-films.com/watch-my-own-private-idaho/ |title=Essential Gay Themed Films To Watch, My Own Private Idaho |author=Alexander Ryll | publisher=Gay Essential |accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, ''[[USA Today]]'' gave ''My Own Private Idaho'' two and half stars out of four, criticizing Van Sant's film for being "nothing but set pieces; tossed into a mix whose meaning is almost certainly private".&lt;ref name= "Clark"&gt;{{cite news|last=Clark |first=Mike |title=Half-baked plot mires ''Idaho'' studs |work=[[USA Today]] |date=September 27, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's [[Richard Schickel]] wrote, "What plot it has is borrowed, improbably, from ''Henry IV'', and whenever anyone manages to speak an entire paragraph, it is usually a Shakespearean paraphrase. But this is a desperate imposition on an essentially inert film."&lt;ref name= "Schickel"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schickel |first=Richard |title=Cinema |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=October 28, 1991 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,974132,00.html |accessdate=2009-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In his review for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', [[Terrence Rafferty]] wrote, "Van Sant has stranded the actor in a movie full of flat characters and bad ideas, but Phoenix walks through the picture, down the road after road after road, as if he were surrounded by glorious phantoms."&lt;ref name= "Rafferty"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rafferty |first=Terrence |title=Street Theatre |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=October 7, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 82% based on 56 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads: "A tantalizing glimpse of a talented director and his stars all at the top of their respective games, Gus Van Sant's loose reworking of Henry IV is smart, sad and audacious."&lt;ref name = "Rotten Tomatoes"&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/my_own_private_idaho/ "My Own Private Idaho – Rotten Tomatoes"] Retrieved 27 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film holds a weighted average score of 77 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref name = "Metacritic"&gt;[http://www.metacritic.com/movie/my-own-private-idaho/ "My Own Private Idaho - Metacritic"] Retrieved 27 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mythopoeic Society''' ('''MythSoc''') is a non-profit organization devoted to the study of [[Mythopoeia|mythopoeic]] literature, particularly the works of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[Charles Williams (UK writer)|Charles Williams]], and [[C. S. Lewis]], all members of [[The Inklings]], an informal group of writers who met weekly in C.S. Lewis’ rooms at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], from the early 1930s through late 1949.

== History ==
The Mythopoeic Society was founded in 1967 by [[Glen H. GoodKnight]]. Originally composed of discussion groups based in the [[Los Angeles]] area, it expanded to include organized branches across North America; in 1972 it assimilated the Tolkien Society of America. Membership is open to those who read, study, or write in the genres of myth and fantasy.

== Publications ==
Three periodical publications are produced by the society:
* ''Mythprint'' is a quarterly newsletter with notices of Society activity, book reviews and articles;&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.mythsoc.org/mythprint/mythprint-history.htm "Mythprint: History and Back Issues"] Mythopoeic Society. Retrieved 2017-01-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Mythopoeic Society membership includes electronic Mythprint (PDF), also available in print format by subscription.
* ''[[Mythlore]]'', edited by [[Janet Brennan Croft]], publishes peer-reviewed articles on mythic and fantastic works, available by subscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7LGmdAPdwDgC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=Janet+Brennan+Croft&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Fe0SUIL2CfLc4QTdk4CADA&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Janet%20Brennan%20Croft&amp;f=false |title=Die aktuelle Tolkienforschung im Überblick: Personen – Organisationen – Verlage – Werke |trans-title=A Survey of Research on Tolkien: People – Organisations – Publishers – Works |language=German |first=Frank |last=Weinreich |first2=Thomas |last2=Honegger |pages=63–89 |journal=Zeitschrift für Fantastikforschung |year=2011 |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Mythic Circle]]'' is a collection of original fiction and poetry, published yearly, available by subscription.

In addition to the periodicals, the society formed [http://www.mythsoc.org/press.htm The Mythopoeic Press] to publish material by and about writers of mythopoeic and fantastic literature, especially focused on The Inklings. Works published include out-of-print materials, collections of short articles and essays, and scholarly items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mythopoeic Press|url=http://www.mythsoc.org/press.htm|publisher=Mythopoeic Society|accessdate=April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
The society sponsors local discussion groups throughout the United States and the ''Annual Mythopoeic Conference'', also known as ''Mythcon'', generally held on college or university campuses in various locations, primarily within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mythsoc.org/mythcon.htm Mythopoeic Conferences] Mythopoeic Society. Retrieved 2017-01-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Mythcon XX was held in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1989. Mythcon XXIII was held at Keble College, Oxford, England, in 1992 as part of ''The J.R.R. Tolkien Centenary Conference'', co-sponsored with [[The Tolkien Society]]. Likewise, Mythcon XXXVI in 2005 was held at Aston University, Birmingham, England, combined with ''Tolkien 2005 - 50 Years of The Lord of the Rings'', sponsored by The Tolkien Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mythsoc.org/mythcon/mythcon-history.htm History of Mythopoeic Conferences] Mythopoeic Society. Retrieved 2017-01-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythopoeic Awards ==
{{main|Mythopoeic Awards}}
Since 1971 the Mythopoeic Society has bestowed a series of [http://www.mythsoc.org/awards.htm annual awards] to outstanding works. In 1991 the literary award was broken into two categories: the ''Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Adult Literature'' and the ''Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Children’s Literature''.

The ''Mythopoeic Scholarship Award in Inklings Studies'' is given to books on J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, and/or Charles Williams that make significant contributions to Inklings scholarship. The ''Mythopoeic Scholarship Award in Myth and Fantasy Studies'' is given to scholarly books on other specific authors in the Inklings tradition, or to more general works on the genres of myth and fantasy. For the scholarship awards, books first published during the previous three years are eligible, including finalists for previous years.

'''''O Seminarista''''' (in English: ''The Seminarian'') is a novel by [[Brazil]]ian writer [[Bernardo Guimarães]], first published in [[1872 in literature|1872]]. It heavily criticizes [[celibacy]], and the [[authoritarism]] and [[patriarchy]] in 19th-century Brazilian families.

==Plot==
The book is set in the city of [[Itapecerica]] (then called Vila de Tamanduá), in [[Minas Gerais]]. Eugênio and Margarida are two childhood friends who love each other, but following orders of his father, Eugênio is sent to a [[seminary]], in order to become a priest. However, he is not able to forget Margarida, and keeps on dilacerating himself between religiosity and the pleasures of flesh.

Despite his numerous inner conflicts, he finally receives his [[ordination]] and becomes a priest. Returning to his hometown in order to celebrate his first [[mass (Roman Rite)|mass]], he discovers that Margarida is very sick and nearly dying. Unable to restrain himself, he and Margarida engage in [[sexual intercourse]]. Unbeknownst to him, she dies shortly after he leaves.

Later on, Eugênio goes on celebrating his first mass – a [[requiem|requiem mass]]. However, when he discovers that the mass is being made in honor of a deceased Margarida, he has a mental breakdown and, taking off his priest vests, runs away of the church, in a frenzy and completely naked.

==Characters==
* Eugênio — the main protagonist of the novel.
* Margarida — Eugênio's childhood friend and love interest.
* Francisco Antunes — Eugênio's father. A very austere military man.
* Mrs. Antunes — Eugênio's mother. She has no autonomy on the house, doing only what Francisco tells her to do.
* Mrs. Umbelina — Margarida's mother, and a [[widow]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14918">'''Panchronic phonology''' is an approach to [[Historical_linguistics#Phonology|historical phonology]]. Its aim is to formulate generalizations about [[sound change]]s that are independent of any particular language or language group.

== Origin of the term ==
The term 'panchronic' as applied to linguistics goes back at least to [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]], who uses it to refer to the most general principles, independently of concrete facts.&lt;ref&gt;Saussure, Ferdinand de. 2011. Course in General Linguistics: Edited by Perry Meisel and Haun Saussy. (Translated by Wade Baskin.) Columbia University Press, pp. 95-96.&lt;/ref&gt; The panchronic program in phonology, however, is associated with the work of [[André-Georges Haudricourt]], especially his seminal articles of 1940&lt;ref name="H40"&gt;See [[#H40|Haudricourt (1940)]].&lt;/ref&gt; and 1973,&lt;ref&gt;See [[#H73|Haudricourt (1973)]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the preliminary synthesis published with Claude Hagège in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#PP|Hagège &amp; Haudricourt (1978)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main tenets of the panchronic program in phonology ==
Beyond case studies, one of the goals of comparative linguistics is to assemble data that lead to an inventory of the common types of sound change and to an improved understanding of the conditions under which they occur. Panchronic Phonology aims to achieve this: it attempts to formulate generalizations about sound change that are independent of any particular language or language group. Haudricourt ([[#auxiliaire|1973]]) labels such an approach Panchronic Phonology. Panchronic laws are obtained by induction from a typological survey of precise diachronic events whose analysis brings out their common conditions of appearance. In turn, they can be used to shed light on individual historical situations. 

Panchronic Phonology is a research program, not a full-fledged, fully realized model of language change. It has been pointed out that the book ''La Phonologie panchronique'', co-authored by [[Claude Hagège|Hagège]] and [[André-Georges Haudricourt|Haudricourt]], only scratches the surface of the many topics that it aims to treat.&lt;ref&gt;Walter, Henriette. 1980. “A Propos de ‘La Phonologie Panchronique’.” ''La Linguistique'' 16 (2): 141–144.&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the panchronic program requires the compilation of as many attested cases of sound changes as possible, with detailed information on the state of the linguistic system where it took place. The study of sound changes in progress is another important source of information about the mechanisms of sound change; particular attention is paid to unstable states, and to the phonetic analysis of synchronic variation. One of the aims of the panchronic approach in phonology is to link up findings about synchronic variation and findings about long-term historical change.

== Examples of panchronic regularities ==
* Haudricourt's programmatic 1940 article&lt;ref name="H40"/&gt; proposes the following example: there is a potential for the change from word-initial /st-/ to V(owel)+/st-/ when the following four conditions are met: (i) initial /st-/ is not significantly more frequent than V+/st-/; (ii) V+/st/ is allowed in word-final position; (iii) there is no word-initial stress; (iv) if the word where the change is to occur has N syllables, words with N+1 syllables must be allowed in the language. 
* [[André-Georges Haudricourt|Haudricourt]] 1965&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haudricourt|first1=André-Georges|authorlink1 =André-Georges Haudricourt|last2= |first2= |year=1965 |title=Les Mutations Consonantiques des Occlusives Initiales en Môn-khmer|journal=Bulletin de La Société de Linguistique de Paris |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=160–172 |publisher= |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michel Ferlus|Ferlus]] 1979&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ferlus |first1=Michel | authorlink1 =Michel Ferlus|last2= |first2= |year=1979 |title=Formation des Registres et Mutations Consonantiques dans les Langues Mon-khmer |journal=Mon-Khmer Studies |volume=8 |issue= |pages=1–76 |publisher= |doi= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; offer a second example: the modeling of the [[transphonologization]] of the voicing opposition among initial consonants. After evolving into an opposition between phonation types on the following vowel (breathy voice vs. modal voice), this opposition becomes tonal if the language already had tones: this creates a split in the tone system. Otherwise it becomes a vowel quality opposition, creating a two-way split in the vowel system. This model is verified in numerous East and Southeast Asian languages. The broadest formulation of this model is proposed by Ferlus (2009).&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Ferlus09|Ferlus (2009)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Panchronic Phonology, Functional Phonology, Historical Phonology, and Evolutionary Phonology ==

===Panchronic Phonology and [[Functional theories of grammar|Functional]] Phonology===
The Panchronic program in phonology is a development from [[Structural linguistics|structural]] approaches to diachrony.&lt;ref&gt;See an example: {{cite book |title=Économie Des Changements Phonétiques : Traité de Phonologie Diachronique |last=Martinet |first=André|authorlink=André Martinet |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Maisonneuve &amp; Larose |location=Paris |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Structural approaches to diachrony study the way in which phonological systems respond to the causes of change. A major source of change is the constant competition between the tendency towards phonological integration and the tendency towards phonetic simplicity. Phonological economy tends to fill structural gaps in phonological systems, and phonetic economy tends to create phonological gaps. Out of the pool of potential changes, the actual direction of evolution observed in a given language depends in part on the state of its phonological system, e.g. – again taking nasality as an example – which [[Nasal consonant|nasal phonemes]] it possesses (among consonants and vowels), which [[Phonotactics|phonotactic]] constraints they are subject to, and what functional load they have in the system.

[[André Martinet|Martinet]] expressed a skeptical view on the possibility of establishing panchronic laws of evolution, considering that the factors at play in linguistic change are of such complexity that no amount of detail can ever be sufficient to arrive at truly panchronic generalizations. He nonetheless considers the search for panchronic generalizations useful as a research tool: "Contrary to some other functionalists, I am not tempted to posit panchronic laws of phonological evolution. But looking for general laws may lead to what I would call the positing of useful hypotheses."&lt;ref&gt;See [[#internal|Martinet (1996)]], p.164.&lt;/ref&gt; Martinet takes the example of the following generalization, which he rephrases from Haudricourt's findings: "The articulation of a phoneme is only apt to get weaker when and if it stands in opposition to another phoneme sharing the same features, but distinct from it on account of a more energetic or a more complex articulation."&lt;ref&gt;See [[#internal|Martinet (1996)]], p.165.&lt;/ref&gt; Martinet concludes: "I still would prefer calling this a working hypothesis rather than a panchronic law, because I am convinced we shall one day come across a language where the weakening of consonants will be found to result from some unforeseen complex of factors." (ibid.)

===Panchronic Phonology and other classical approaches to Historical Phonology===

While the term ''panchronic'' is not widely used today, the aim to formulate generalizations about sound change that are independent of any particular language or language group is common to many historical linguists. [[William Labov|Labov]]'s generalization that "In chain shifts, peripheral vowels become more open and nonperipheral vowels become less open" (1994: 601) can be considered as a panchronic statement.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#MMBM|Mazaudon &amp; Michailovsky (2007)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the generalizations about nasal states and nasal processes proposed by [[Larry Hyman|Hyman]]&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Larry M. 1975. “Nasal States and Nasal Processes.” In ''Nasálfest: Papers from a Symposium on Nasals and Nasalization'', edited by Charles A. Ferguson, Larry M. Hyman, and John Ohala, 249–264. Stanford: Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt; likewise aim to explain synchronic states in terms of the processes that lead up to them, and to arrive at general laws of sound change.

===Panchronic Phonology and Evolutionary Phonology===

The program of Panchronic Phonology is very close to that of [[Evolutionary Phonology]],&lt;ref&gt;Blevins, Juliette. 2004. Evolutionary Phonology: The Emergence of Sound Patterns. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; although with some interesting differences. Evolutionary Phonology (as proposed by [[Juliette Blevins]]), building on work by [[John Ohala]], considers phonetic variation as the primary source of phonological change. This emphasis on the phonetic bases of change encourages a continuous dialogue between experimental phonetics and historical phonology. Even if every scholars agree that there exist competing phonetic tendencies, according to [[William Labov|Labov]] (1994: 601) they do not have explanatory or predictive power when it comes to individual cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of Linguistic Change.

According to some authors, the existence of a pool of phonetic variation is only part of the thoroughly complex story of diachronic sound change.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Henning. 2006.

'''Polygonal masonry''' is a technique of stone construction.  True polygonal masonry is a technique wherein the visible surfaces of the stones are [[Wiktionary:dress|dressed]] with straight sides or joints, giving the block the appearance of a polygon.&lt;ref name="Wright2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=G.R.H. Wright|title=Ancient Building Technology, Volume 3: Construction (2 Vols)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CQHsKG6g5zwC&amp;pg=PA154|date=23 November 2009|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-17745-0|pages=154–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This technique is found throughout the world and sometimes corresponds to the less technical category of [[Cyclopean masonry]].&lt;ref name="Malacrino2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carmelo G.

'''Preservation metadata''' is an essential component of most [[digital preservation]] strategies. As an increasing proportion of the world’s information output shifts from analog to digital form, it is necessary to develop new strategies to preserve this information for the long-term. Preservation metadata is information that supports and documents the digital preservation process. Preservation metadata is sometimes considered a subset of technical or administrative metadata.

==Preservation metadata==
Preservation metadata stores technical details on the format, structure and use of the digital content, the history of all actions performed on the resource including changes and decisions, the authenticity information such as technical features or custody history, and the responsibilities and rights information applicable to preservation actions.&lt;ref name="PADI"&gt;''[http://www.nla.gov.au/padi/topics/32.html Preserving Access to Digital Information]'', [[National Library of Australia]]. Retrieved April 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Preservation metadata is access-centered and should accomplish four themes: include details about files and instructions for use; document all updates or actions that have occurred to an object; show provenance and demonstrate current and future custody; list details on the individual(s) who are responsible for the preservation of the object.&lt;ref&gt;Woodyard, D., Metadata and preservation. ''[[Information Services and Use]]'', 22:121–125, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Preservation metadata often includes the following information:

* ''Provenance:'' Who has had custody/ownership of the digital object?
* ''Authenticity:'' Is the digital object what it purports to be?
* ''Preservation activity:'' What has been done to preserve the digital object?
* ''Technical environment:'' What is needed to render, interact with and use the digital object?
* ''Rights management:'' What intellectual property rights must be observed?&lt;ref name = "LOC"&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/standards/premis Library of Congress.  PREMIS: Preservation Metadata Maintenance Activity]. Retrieved April 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital materials require constant maintenance and migration to new formats as technology changes. In order to survive into the future, digital objects need preservation metadata that can exist independently from the systems which were used to create them. Without preservation metadata, digital material will be lost. “''While a print book with a broken spine can be easily re-bound, a digital object that has become corrupted or obsolete is often impossible (or prohibitively expensive) to repair''”.&lt;ref&gt;Lavoie, B. &amp; Dempsey, L., [http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july04/lavoie/07lavoie.html Thirteen ways of looking at...digital preservation], ''[[D-Lib Magazine]]'', 10 (7/8), 2004. Retrieved April 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Preservation metadata provides the vital information which will make “digital objects self-documenting across time.”&lt;ref name = "LOC"/&gt;

Preservation metadata is a new and developing field. The Reference Model for an [[Open Archival Information System]] (OAIS) is a broad conceptual model which many organizations have followed in developing new preservation metadata element sets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nost.gsfc.nasa.gov/isoas/ref_model.html Reference model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412100933/http://nost.gsfc.nasa.gov/isoas/ref_model.html |date=2008-04-12 }}, [[NASA]], USA.&lt;/ref&gt;  Early projects in preservation metadata in the library community include CEDARS, NEDLIB, The National Library of Australia and the OCLC/RLG Working Group on Preservation Metadata.&lt;ref name="PADI" /&gt; Following on from this work, the [[Preservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies (PREMIS)]] Working Group created the "Data Dictionary for Preservation Metadata: Final Report of the PREMIS Working Group" which was released in May 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oclc.org/research/projects/pmwg/ OCLC/RLG PREMIS (PREservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies)], [http://www.oclc.org/ OCLC].&lt;/ref&gt; The ongoing work of maintaining, supporting, and coordinating future revisions to the PREMIS Data Dictionary is undertaken by the PREMIS Editorial Committee, hosted by the Library of Congress.&lt;ref name="LOC" /&gt;

[[Image:Bulla-Ferdinant.jpg|thumb|Requiem Mass for [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] at [[Catholic Church of St. Catherine (Saint Petersburg)|St. Catherine's Cathedral]], [[St. Petersburg]], published in a [[Russia]]n newspaper (1914)]]

A '''Requiem''' or '''Requiem Mass''', also known as '''Mass for the dead''' (Latin: ''Missa pro defunctis'') or '''Mass of the dead''' (Latin: ''Missa defunctorum''), is a [[Mass  in the Catholic Church]] offered for the repose of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] or souls of one or more deceased persons, using a particular form of the [[Roman Missal]]. It is usually, but not necessarily, celebrated in the context of a [[funeral]].

Musical settings of the [[Proper (liturgy)|propers]] of the Requiem Mass are also called Requiems, and the term has subsequently been applied to other musical compositions associated with death, dying, and mourning, even when they lack religious or liturgical relevance.

The term is also used for similar ceremonies outside the Roman Catholic Church, especially in the [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] tradition of [[Anglicanism]] and in certain [[Lutheran Church|Lutheran]] churches. A [[Memorial service (Orthodox)|comparable service]], with a wholly different ritual form and texts, exists in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], as well as in the [[Methodist Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fahlbusch|first=Erwin |title=The Encyclopedia Of Christianity, Volume 4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C5V7oyy69zgC&amp;pg=PA649 |accessdate=3 November 2012|year=2005|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0802824165|quote=The possibility of a funeral Eucharist is provided in North American Lutheran, Episcopal/Anglican, and United Methodist worship books.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mass and its settings draw their name from the [[introit]] of the liturgy, which begins with the words "''Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine''"&amp;nbsp;– "Grant them eternal rest, O Lord".  ("Requiem" is the [[accusative case|accusative]] singular form of the Latin noun ''requies'', "rest, repose".) The Roman Missal as revised in 1970 employs this phrase as the first entrance [[antiphon]] among the formulas for Masses for the dead, and it remains in use to this day.

==Liturgical rite==
[[File:Pontifikalni rekvijem.JPG|thumb|Traditional Requiem Mass, Chiesa della [[Santissima Trinità dei Pellegrini, Rome]] (Church of the Most Holy Trinity of Pilgrims)]]

In earlier forms of the Roman Rite, some of which are still in use, a Requiem Mass differs in several ways from the usual Mass in that form. Some parts that were of relatively recent origin, including some that have been excluded in the 1970 revision, are omitted. Examples are the psalm ''Iudica'' at the start of Mass, the prayer said by the priest before reading the Gospel (or the blessing of the deacon, if a deacon reads it), and the first of the two prayers of the priest for himself before receiving Communion.&lt;ref&gt;''Missale Romanum, Ritus servandus in celebratione Missae'', XIII&lt;/ref&gt; Other omissions include the use of [[incense]] at the Introit and the Gospel, the kiss of peace, lit candles held by acolytes when a deacon chants the Gospel, and blessings. There is no [[Gloria in excelsis Deo]] and no recitation of the [[Credo|Creed]]; the [[Alleluia]] chant before the Gospel is replaced by a [[Tract (liturgy)|Tract]], as in [[Lent]]; and the ''[[Agnus Dei (liturgy)|Agnus Dei]]'' is altered. ''[[Ite missa est]]'' is replaced with ''[[Requiescant in pace]]'' (May they rest in peace); the "Deo gratias" response is replaced with "Amen". Black is the obligatory [[Liturgical colours|liturgical colour]] of the [[vestment]]s in the earlier forms, while the later form allows a choice between black and violet, and in some countries, such as England and Wales, white.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Resources/GIRM/Documents/GIRM.pdf General Instruction of the Roman Missal, with adaptations for England and Wales], 346&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sequence (poetry)|sequence]] [[Dies irae]], recited or sung between the [[Tract (liturgy)|Tract]] and the Gospel, is an obligatory part of the Requiem Mass before the Novus Ordo changes. As its opening words ''Dies irae'' ("day of wrath") indicate, this poetic composition speaks of the Day of Judgment in fearsome terms; it then appeals to Jesus for mercy. In the pre-Novus Ordo form, commemorations (i.e., collect, secret, and postcommunion of either lower-ranking liturgical feasts that occur on the same day or votive/seasonal commemorations) are absent from the liturgy; as a result, it is standard practice for a separate, smaller Requiem Missal containing only the rubrics and various Mass formularies for Masses for the dead to be used, rather than the full Missal containing texts that will never be used at Requiems.

===Post–Vatican II===
[[File:Pre Vat2 Vestments b.jpg|left|thumb|Black vestments used in Requiem Masses, from [[St Pancras Church, Ipswich]]|170px]]
In the liturgical reforms of the mid-20th century in the Roman Catholic Church following the Novus Ordo [[Second Vatican Council]], there was a significant shift in the [[funeral rites]] used by the Church. The emphasis on sorrow and grief was to be replaced by one which also includes the whole community's worship of God and in which the deceased is entrusted to God's love, based on trust in the [[salvation|salvific]] value of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], Death and [[Resurrection]] of Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.richmonddiocese.org/worship/liturgies/funeral.htm |title=The Catholic Diocese of Richmond, Office of Worship "Rites of the Order of Christian Funerals" |publisher=.richmonddiocese.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311083420/http://www2.richmonddiocese.org/worship/liturgies/funeral.htm |archivedate=2013-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Requiem Mass" was often replaced by the term "Mass of the Resurrection"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mass%20of%20the%20resurrection |work=Merriam-Webster.com |title=Mass of the Resurrection |accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Mass of Christian Burial''', although the former was never official terminology. In the official English ritual, ''Order of Christian Funerals'', published by the Roman Catholic Bishops of England and Wales in 1990, the title is given as "Funeral Mass". Requiem Mass remains a suitable title for other Masses for the dead and for the Funeral Mass itself, (as the proper antiphons remain in force, Introit -"Eternal rest grant..."/"Requiem æternam dona eis Domine", Offertory: "Lord Jesus Christ, King of glory, deliver the souls of all the faithful departed..."/"Domine Iesu Christe, Rex gloriæ, libera animas...", Communion:"Let perpetual light shine..."/"Lux æterna luceat eis, Domine..."), although the propers are more honored in the breach than in the observance. In line with this shift, the use of black vestments was made optional by the second Vatican Council (and had mostly disappeared by the late 20th century, at least in the United States, although their use is seeing a resurgence), with the preference of many being for white, (the use of which is an indult for some countries, not part of the universal rubrics) the color of joy associated with [[Easter]], or purple, for a muted version of mourning. The texts used for the service offered a similar change, with more options for the readings, some of which reinforce an overall theme of the promise of eternal life made by Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rites of Christian Burial'', Catholic Publishing Company 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requiem in other rites and churches==
''Requiem'' is also used to describe any sacred composition that sets to music religious texts which would be appropriate at a funeral, or to describe such compositions for liturgies other than the Roman Catholic Mass. Among the earliest examples of this type are the German settings composed in the 17th century by [[Heinrich Schütz]] and [[Michael Praetorius]], whose works are Lutheran adaptations of the Roman Catholic requiem, and which provided inspiration for the mighty ''[[Ein deutsches Requiem|German Requiem]]'' by [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]].&lt;ref&gt;A rather exhaustive list of requiem composers can be found on [http://www.requiemsurvey.org Requiemsurvey.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Such works include:
* [[Greek Orthodox Church]]—''[[Parastas]]''
* [[Russian Orthodox Church]]—''Panikhida''
* Anglican (English) Requiem

===Eastern Christian rites===
{{Main|Memorial service (Orthodox)}}
In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Greek-Catholic]] Churches, the requiem is the fullest form of [[memorial service (Orthodox)|memorial service]] ({{lang-el|Parastas}}, [[Church Slavonic|Slavonic]]: ''Оpеlо''). The normal memorial service is a greatly abbreviated form of [[Matins]], but the Requiem contains all of the psalms, readings, and hymns normally found in the [[All-Night Vigil]] (which combines the [[Canonical Hours]] of [[Vespers]], [[Matins]] and [[Prime (liturgy)|First Hour]]), providing a complete set of [[proper (liturgy)|propers]] for the departed. The full requiem will last around three-and-a-half hours. In this format it more clearly represents the original concept of ''parastas'', which means literally, "standing throughout (the night)." Often, there will be a [[Divine Liturgy]] celebrated the next morning with further propers for the departed.

Because of their great length, a full Requiem is rarely served. However, at least in the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian]] liturgical tradition, a Requiem will often be served on the eve before the [[Canonization#Eastern Orthodox Practice—Glorification|Glorification]] (canonization) of a [[saint]], in a special service known as the "Last ''Panikhida''".

===Anglicanism===
The ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' contained no Requiem Mass, but instead a service named "The Order for the Burial of the Dead". Since the liturgical reform movement, provision has been made for a Eucharist to be celebrated at a funeral in various BCPs used in the 33 Provinces of the Anglican Communion. Prior to these additions, [[Anglo-Catholics]] or [[High Church]] Anglicans often incorporate parts of the Roman Catholic Requiem Mass as part of a funeral service—typically passages from the Ordinary of the Mass. Within this service are several texts with rubrics stating that they shall be said or sung by the priest or clerks. The first few of these texts are found at the beginning of the service, while the rest are meant to occur during the actual burial of the body into the grave.  These texts are typically dividing into seven, and collectively known as "funeral sentences". Composers who have set the Anglican burial service to music include [[William Croft]], [[Thomas Morley]], [[Thomas Tomkins]], [[Orlando Gibbons]] and [[Henry Purcell]]. The text of these seven sentences, from the 1662 ''Book of Common Prayer'', is as follows:
* I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.
* I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth. And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another.
* We brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the Name of the Lord.
* Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live, and is full of misery. He cometh up, and is cut down, like a flower; he fleeth as it were a shadow, and never continueth in one stay.
* In the midst of life we are in death: of whom may we seek for succour, but of thee, O Lord, who for our sins art justly displeased? Yet, O Lord God most holy, O Lord most mighty, O holy and most merciful Saviour, deliver us not into the bitter pains of eternal death.
* Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts; shut not thy merciful ears to our prayer; but spare us, Lord most holy, O God most mighty, O holy and merciful Saviour, thou most worthy judge eternal, suffer us not, at our last hour, for any pains of death, to fall from thee.
* I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me, Write, From henceforth blessed are the dead which die in the Lord: even so saith the Spirit: for they rest from their labours.

==Music==
{{main|Music for the Requiem Mass}}
The Requiem Mass is notable for the large number of musical compositions that it has inspired, including settings by [[Requiem (Mozart)|Mozart]] (though uncompleted),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/26/arts/recordings-view-no-reverence-no-reticence-in-finishing-mozart-s-requiem.html| title= RECORDINGS VIEW; No Reverence, No Reticence In Finishing Mozart's Requiem | work= The New York Times | first= Anthony | last= Tommasini | date= 26 November 1995 | accessdate= 13 May 2015}})&lt;/ref&gt; [[Requiem (Verdi)|Verdi]], [[Requiem (Berlioz)|Berlioz]], [[Requiem (Dvořák)|Dvořák]], [[Requiem (Fauré)|Fauré]], [[Requiem (Duruflé)|Duruflé]], and others. Originally, such compositions were meant to be performed in liturgical service, with monophonic chant. Eventually, the dramatic character of the text began to appeal to composers to an extent that they made the requiem a genre of its own, and the compositions of composers such as Verdi are essentially concert pieces rather than liturgical works.

Many of the texts in the Requiem Mass have been set to music, including:

===History of musical compositions===
[[Image:RequiemAeternamChant.jpg|thumb|400px|float|[[Incipit]] of the [[Gregorian chant]] [[introit]] for a Requiem Mass, from the ''[[Liber Usualis]]''.]]
For many centuries the texts of the requiem were sung to [[Gregorian chant|Gregorian]] melodies. The [[Requiem (Ockeghem)|Requiem]] by [[Johannes Ockeghem]], written sometime in the latter half of the 15th century, is the earliest surviving [[polyphony|polyphonic]] setting. There was a setting by the elder composer [[Guillaume Dufay|Dufay]], possibly earlier, which is now lost: Ockeghem's may have been modelled on it.&lt;ref name="Fitch"&gt;Fabrice Fitch: "Requiem (2)", Grove Music Online, ed. L. Macy (Accessed January 21, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Many early compositions reflect the varied texts that were in use in different liturgies around Europe before the [[Council of Trent]] standardised texts used in liturgies. The requiem of [[Antoine Brumel|Brumel]], circa 1500, is the first to include the ''[[Dies irae|Dies Iræ]]''. In the early polyphonic settings of the Requiem, there is considerable textural contrast within the compositions themselves: simple chordal or [[fauxbourdon]]-like passages are contrasted with other sections of contrapuntal complexity, such as in the Offertory of Ockeghem's Requiem.&lt;ref name="Fitch"/&gt;

In the 16th century, more and more composers set the Requiem mass. In contrast to practice in setting the Mass Ordinary, many of these settings used a [[cantus-firmus]] technique, something which had become quite archaic by mid-century. In addition, these settings used less textural contrast than the early settings by Ockeghem and Brumel, although the vocal scoring was often richer, for example in the six-voice Requiem by [[Jean Richafort]] which he wrote for the death of [[Josquin des Prez]].&lt;ref name="Fitch"/&gt; Other composers before 1550 include [[Pedro de Escobar]], [[Antoine de Févin]], [[Cristóbal Morales]], and [[Pierre de La Rue]]; that by La Rue is probably the second oldest, after Ockeghem's.

[[Image:K626 Requiem Mozart.jpg|thumb|left|A portion of the manuscript of [[Requiem (Mozart)|Mozart's ''Requiem'', K 626]] (1791), showing his heading for the first movement.]]
Over 2,000 Requiem compositions have been composed to the present day. Typically the Renaissance settings, especially those not written on the [[Iberian Peninsula]], may be performed ''[[a cappella]]'' (i.e. without necessary accompanying instrumental parts), whereas beginning around 1600 composers more often preferred to use instruments to accompany a choir, and also include vocal soloists. There is great variation between compositions in how much of liturgical text is set to music.

Most composers omit sections of the liturgical prescription, most frequently the Gradual and the Tract. [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]] omits the ''Dies iræ'', while the very same text had often been set by French composers in previous centuries as a stand-alone work.

Sometimes composers divide an item of the liturgical text into two or more movements; because of the length of its text, the ''Dies iræ'' is the most frequently divided section of the text (as with Mozart, for instance). The ''Introit'' and ''Kyrie'', being immediately adjacent in the actual Roman Catholic liturgy, are often composed as one movement.

Musico-thematic relationships among movements within a Requiem can be found as well.

====Requiem in concert====
Beginning in the 18th century and continuing through the 19th, many composers wrote what are effectively concert works, which by virtue of employing forces too large, or lasting such a considerable duration, prevent them being readily used in an ordinary funeral service; the requiems of [[François-Joseph Gossec|Gossec]], [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]], [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]], and [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]] are essentially dramatic concert [[oratorio]]s. A counter-reaction to this tendency came from the Cecilian movement, which recommended restrained accompaniment for liturgical music, and frowned upon the use of operatic vocal soloists.

===Modern treatments===
In the 20th century the requiem evolved in several new directions. The genre of War Requiem is perhaps the most notable, which comprise compositions dedicated to the memory of people killed in wartime. These often include extra-liturgical poems of a pacifist or non-liturgical nature; for example, the ''[[War Requiem]]'' of [[Benjamin Britten]] juxtaposes the Latin text with the poetry of [[Wilfred Owen]], [[Krzysztof Penderecki]]'s ''[[Polish Requiem]]'' includes a traditional Polish hymn within the sequence, and [[Robert Steadman]]'s ''[[Robert Steadman#Choral music|Mass in Black]]'' intersperses [[natural environment|environmental]] [[poetry]] and [[Prophecy|prophecies]] of [[Nostradamus]]. [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]] Requiem may be regarded as a specific subset of this type. The ''Requiem Ebraico'' (Hebrew Requiem) (1945) by Austrian-American composer [[Eric Zeisl]], a setting of [[Psalm 92]] dedicated to the memory of the composer's father "and the other countless victims of the Jewish tragedy in Europe", is considered the first major work of Holocaust commemoration. [[John Foulds]]'s ''[[A World Requiem]]'' was written in the aftermath of the [[World War I|First World War]] and initiated the [[Royal British Legion]]'s annual festival of remembrance. Recent requiem works by Taiwanese composers [[Tyzen Hsiao]] and [[Ko Fan-long]] follow in this tradition, honouring victims of the [[February 28 Incident]] and subsequent [[White Terror (Taiwan)|White Terror]].

The 20th century saw the development of the secular Requiem, written for public performance without specific religious observance, such as Max Reger's ''[[Requiem (Reger)|Requiem]]'' (1915), the setting of a German poem titled Requiem and dedicated to victims of World War I, and [[Frederick Delius]]'s ''[[Requiem (Delius)|Requiem]]'', completed in 1916 and dedicated to "the memory of all young Artists fallen in the war",;&lt;ref name=corleonis&gt;Corleonis, Adrian. [http://www.allmusic.com/work/requiem-for-soprano-baritone-double-chorus--orchestra-rt-ii-8-c151935/description Requiem, for soprano, baritone, double chorus &amp; orchestra, RT ii/8] ''All Music Guide'' Retrieved 2011-02-20&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Hindemith]]'s [[When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd (Hindemith)|''When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd: A Requiem for Those We Love'']], commissioned in 1945 (premiered 1946) after the passing of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], and based on Walt Whitman's [[When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd|elegy]] written after the passing of [[Abraham Lincoln]]; and [[Dmitry Kabalevsky]]'s ''[[List of compositions by Dmitry Kabalevsky#Vocal Orchestral|Requiem]]'' (Op. 72; 1962), a setting of a poem written by [[Robert Rozhdestvensky]] especially for the composition.&lt;ref name=flaxman&gt;Flaxman, Fred.  [http://www.compactdiscoveries.com/CompactDiscoveriesArticles/Kabalevsky.html Controversial Comrade Kabalevsky] ''Compact Discoveries with Fred Flaxman'', 2007, Retrieved 2011-02-20;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbert Howells]]'s unaccompanied ''Requiem'' uses [[Psalm 23]] ("The Lord is my shepherd"), Psalm 121 ("I will lift up mine eyes"), "Salvator mundi" ("O Saviour of the world" in English), "Requiem aeternam" (two different settings), and "I&amp;nbsp;heard a voice from heaven". John Rutter combines in his [[Requiem (Rutter)|Requiem]] (1985) some of the parts of the Latin Requiem with two complete psalms, [[Psalm 130]] "Out of the deep" and his earlier composition ''[[The Lord is my Shepherd (Rutter)|The Lord is my Shepherd]]'', and juxtaposes more biblical verses within the Latin movements. 

Some composers have written purely instrumental works bearing the title of ''Requiem'', as famously exemplified by Britten's ''Sinfonia da Requiem''. [[Hans Werner Henze]]'s ''[[Das Floß der Medusa]]'', written in 1968 as a requiem for [[Che Guevara]], is properly speaking an [[oratorio]]; Henze's [[Requiem (Henze)|Requiem]] is instrumental but retains the traditional Latin titles for the movements. [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Requiem Canticles]]'' mixes instrumental movements with segments of the "Introit", "Dies irae", "Pie Jesu" and "Libera me". [[Christopher Wood (composer)|Christopher Wood]]’s ''Requiem'' (premiered in 2012 under the direction of [[Paul Brough (conductor)|Paul Brough]] at [[St John's, Smith Square]]) was inspired by the public reaction to the death of [[Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother]], and returns to a more traditional form, setting virtually the complete Latin text from the [[Liber Usualis]]. In February 2013, an [[Arab Spring]]-inspired 'Requiem' by composer [[Rami Khalife]] was premiered by the [[Qatar Philharmonic Orchestra]] and The [[Leipzig Radio Choir]], to great critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date= 5 February 2013 | title= Khalife delights with Arab Spring suite | agency= Agence France Presse| location= Doha | work= The Daily Star ''(Lebanon)''| url= http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Culture/Performance/2013/Feb-05/205045-khalife-delights-with-arab-spring-suite.ashx | accessdate= 13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint Thomas Christian names''' describes the naming convention that is in use by the [[Saint Thomas Christians]] of [[Kerala]], the south western state of [[India]]. These Christians known as [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani]]s, trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of [[Thomas the Apostle]] in the 1st century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=lZUBZlth2qgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:9780802824172&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=i5ncVJiVJ4u4uATrlIGoAg&amp;ved=0CB8Q6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Muziris&amp;f=false ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 5''] by Erwin Fahlbusch. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing - 2008. p. 285. {{ISBN|978-0-8028-2417-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They still follow a very old naming convention, which is entirely different from other races and religions.

Their names are both biblical and inherited and are passed on from one generation to the next. The male names are [[patronymic]] and the female names are [[matronymic]]. Usually a person’s name will include the names of their parents and grand parents or that of a very close blood relative.&lt;ref&gt;Luke 1:59-64.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, these names will not have names of saints or of great religious personalities or of political leaders or of foreign names. Family names are also included. Unlike Indian Christians of other denominations, foreign family names are absolutely irrelevant for Saint Thomas Christians as they embraced Christianity long before the arrival of European missionaries in India . So a Nasrani can easily be identified by name, from among other Christians. Even today, this pattern of giving name is visible in almost all [[Saint Thomas Christian Churches|Syrian Christian denominations]].

==History==
Before the arrival of the Portuguese in May 1498, Saint Thomas Christians of Kerala were known to belong to the ''Margam'', a word when translated is ‘The Way’.&lt;ref&gt;Acts 9:2; 19:9, 23; 22:4; 24:22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1599, Catholic Archbishop Alexio-de-Menezes called a synod at Udayamperoor, in which Christians in and near the kingdom of [[Cochin]] attended.  Here he decreed that St. Thomas Christians should abandon their ancient naming conventions. They were specifically told not to use the name ''Easow'' because it was  holy.&lt;ref&gt;Decrees of the Synod of AD 1599 July 20–27 (Malayalam), proceedings of the third meeting, Canon 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  But, the [[Saint Thomas Christians]] ignored this command and had continued with their ancient customs. Even today they do follow this method of naming. Even the Nasranis that did convert to Catholicism (Syrian Catholics) still use the "old margam" names. The Latin names are shunned

During the 20th century some names were created by joining two or more syllables. For example, Abey (AB), Aji (AG), Bibi (BB), Biji (BG), Jessy (JC) and so on. Today, several Syrian Christians name their children by Indian names like [[Deepak]], Rahul, Neethu, [[Asha]] etc. But by the 21st century more biblical names began to reappear. Thus names like, [[Isaac]], [[Joshua]], [[David]], [[Saul]], [[Ezekiel]], [[Timothy (name)|Timothy]], appeared on the scene. Generally they still follow the system detailed below.

==Standard form of a name==
A name will include the baptismal name (generally the person is known by that name ) and the name of the father. The practice of appending the first name of father to the child's name instead of family name is also followed by [[Hindus]] of [[South India]]. Examples are given below.

===Male names===
Their names traditionally have a threefold structure.
::Family or house name – Father’s name – Baptismal name
The first two are usually abbreviated to initials.

Another form is that the name will include the baptismal name (generally the person is called by that name) and the name of his father. The practice of appending the first name of father to the child's name instead of family name is also followed by [[Hindus]] of [[South India]]. Examples are given below.

As an example, the name, Thomas Mathew is similar to ''Shimon bar Jona''.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 16:17&lt;/ref&gt; which means ''Shimon son of Jona''. In the same way, Thomas Mathew means ''Thomas'' son of ''Mathew''. Thomas Mathew is to be addressed as Thomas and not by his father’s name.
:''Here the correct spelling is ‘’’Mathew’’’ and not ‘’’Matthew’’’ as in English.''

Another form of name is Nikhil Thomas Mathew where Nikhil is a name chosen by the parents and they usually call him by that name, Thomas is the biblical and baptismal name and Mathew is his father's name.

Their bishop receives a new name on consecration. This also has a threefold structure.
::His baptismal name (Sometimes in Syriac form) – the title Mar (in East syriac form) or Mor ( in west Syriac form) – an Episcopal title ( a Biblical name or the name of a Christian father).&lt;ref&gt;N.M. Mathew. ''Malankara Marthoma Sabha Charitram'', (History of the Marthoma Church), Volume III. 2008. Page 243.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Fenwick. ‘’The forgotten Bishops.’’ Georgias Press, ILC, NJ. U.S.A. 2009. {{ISBN|978-1-60724-619-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female names===
As an example, the name, Rachel Mathew, means Rachel daughter of Mathew. After marriage, father’s name is replaced by the husband’s name. Rachel Mathew is to be addressed as Rachel and not by her father’s name.

Another naming pattern is Anita Rachel Mathew where Anita is a formal given name chosen by the parents, Rachel is the biblical and baptismal name and Mathew is father's name. The given first names can be of any origin and many Syrian Christians give Indian names like Neethu, Deepa etc. to their children.

===Use of initials===
When initials are used, abbreviations of the family name or house name (name of the plot where the parents of the child live at the time of birth) and the father’s name are given before the [[given name]]. For example, the name P.M. Thomas means Palakkappilly (family name), Mathew’s (father’s name) son, Thomas ([[given name]]). His sister’s name will be P.M. Rachel.

===Other forms===
When family name or house name need to be used, it comes first followed by the [[given name]]. As an example, T.M. Thomas is, THEETAKATTIL Thomas Mathew or THEETAKATTIL T.M.Thomas.

===Hypocoristic===
[[Hypocoristic]] (Pet names) are often used in a familiar and friendly manner in informal situations. In more formal situations, the [[given name]] is to be used instead. This alludes to the fact that using a person's pet name betokens familiarity.
Pet names for Syrian Christians can be Hindu, Assyrian, Persian or Biblical in origin.

==Order in giving names==

===For boys===
Male names  are [[patronymic]].
:The first born is given the name of his paternal grandfather.
:The second born is given the name of his maternal grandfather.
:The third born is given the name of one of his uncles.

===For girls===
Female names are [[matronymic]].
:The first born is given the name of her paternal grandmother.
:The second born is given the name of her maternal grandmother.
:The third born is given the name of one of her aunts.

===Changes===
The last name (father’s name) changes with each generation.  The family name would also change if  members who move out of their [[consanguineal]] family homes with the changing ownership of property upon the death of the patriarch decides to adopt a new name. However, several families claim that they are ancient and their family names have remained unchanged for centuries.

The Syrian Christians who have migrated to Western nations tend to choose surnames which can either be the family name or the father's name will be used as a surname.

==Common names==
The mother tongue of Nasranis is Malayalam. So the names given in the following lists are in [[phonetic spelling]]. But the first one, given under ‘’Other names,’’ shows how that name is usually written in English. The two lists include the names of a few common names that are in use, and they are not comprehensive. To know the correct pronunciation of these names, see [[Malayalam script]] or [[Tiberian vocalization]].

'''''Scandinavian Traveler''''' is the [[inflight magazine]] of [[SAS Group|Scandinavian Airlines]] (SAS).&lt;ref name="sas"/&gt;

==History and profile==
''Scandinavian Traveler'' was established as a successor to ''[[Scanorama]]'', former inflight magazine of SAS.&lt;ref name="sag"&gt;{{cite news|author=Marisa Garcia|title=How Scandinavian Airlines Rethought the In-Flight Magazine|url=https://skift.com/2015/03/09/how-scandinavian-airlines-rethought-the-in-flight-magazine/|accessdate=12 July 2016|work=Skift|date=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Joe Pulizzi|title=A Scary Attempt at Defining Content Marketing|url=http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2014/11/week-content-marketing-scary-attempt-defining-content-marketing/|accessdate=12 July 2016|work=Content Marketing Institute|date=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was first published in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) – Media Company or Airline?|url=http://jonobean.com/2014/10/09/scandinavian-airlines-sas-media-company-or-airline/|accessdate=12 July 2016|work=Jonobean|date=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SAS launches new editorial concept|url=http://www.palanga-airport.lt/index.php?id=765|accessdate=12 July 2016|work=Palanga Airport|date=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is published on a monthly basis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scandinavian Traveler|url=http://www.internationalmediasales.net/de/portfolio/detail/scandinavian-traveler/|accessdate=12 July 2016|work=International Media Sales}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and covers lifestyle- and travel-related articles.&lt;ref name="sas"&gt;{{cite news|title=Entertainment Onboard|url=https://www.flysas.com/en/travel-info/onboard/entertainment/|accessdate=12 July 2016|work=SAS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The printed magazine is published in English,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scandinavian Traveler - SAS Airways|url=http://www.mediastar.co.in/scandinavian-traveler-sas-airways.php|work=Media Star|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and online versions of the magazine are published in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Danish language|Danish]] and English.

The second issue of the magazine, published in December 2014, was suspended by SAS when it led to criticism of [[Norway]]'s [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] due to the article by Swedish journalist Per Svensson.&lt;ref name="sver"&gt;{{cite news|title=SAS pulls magazine following complaints from right-wing party|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=6039217|accessdate=12 July 2016|work=Sveriges Radio|date=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article was concerned with the recent increase of [[Right-wing political parties|right-wing extremist parties]] in [[Scandinavian countries]].&lt;ref name="sver"/&gt;

''Scandinavian Traveler'' has won numerous awards, for example, the Swedish Content Awards for its cover design of the issue ''Hit men'' in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vinnarna i Swedish Content Awards 2016|url=http://www.resume.se/nyheter/artiklar/2016/05/31/vinnarna-i-swedish-content-awards-2016/|work=Resume|accessdate=12 July 2016|date=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine has 1.4 million readers monthly, and since the launch the online versions has had 1.3 million visitors. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.otw.se/case/sas/|title=SAS - OTW|work=OTW|language=sv-SE|access-date=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3200">'''Simulated Real Time''' is a literary method of creating an event with the help of authentic material accompanied by a commentary framework. By publishing documents (letters, diaries, official reports etc.) on the date on which they were written but a specified number of years later, an event can be reconstructed with exactly the same duration as when it first took place. The aim of this method is to gain greater understanding of a historical event in this way, using modern technology to bring it to life as vividly as possible. The method is giving an important contribution to contemporary Remembrance Culture, in a time where the survivors of the [[Holocaust]] are getting fewer.

The first project ever to be published in '''Simulated Real Time''' was the literature and art project [[32 Postkarten]], by [[Torkel S Wächter]], in which 32 authentic postcards sent from [[Hamburg]] during 1940 and 1941 were published in '''Simulated Real Time''' – on the date they were written, but 70 years later.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goethe.de/ges/pok/dos/dos/ern/kug/en6450636.htm, '''[[Goethe Institute]]''' 2010-09-01&lt;/ref&gt; This project has been followed up by Wächter's [http://onthisday80yearsago.com '''on this day 80 years ago'''], built around authentic letters, diary entries and official documents that are being published on the day on which they were written, but 80 years later. This online publication started on 30 January 2013, eighty years to the day since Hitler was appointed [[Chancellor]], and will end on 2 July 2013 (according to the projects website). It depicts the [[Nazis]]’ first five months in power, and how this affects the life of a German-Jewish civil servant family in Hamburg.

January 30, 2013 was also the starting date of [http://www.jmberlin.de/1933/ '''1933: The Beginning of the End of German Jewry'''] in which the [[Jewish Museum Berlin]] throughout the year 2013 will present a variety of primary source materials that bear witness to the disenfranchisement and exclusion of German Jews, as well as to aspects of their everyday life (according to the museum's website). The project is part of '''[https://web.archive.org/web/20130317145949/http://www.kulturprojekte-berlin.de/en/our-events/theme-year-2013-diversity-destroyed.html Diversity Destroyed]''', a cultural project under the auspices of Berlin City.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.berlin.de/2013/en/startseitenweiterleitung/, [[City of Berlin]] 2013-01-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://lernen-aus-der-geschichte.de/Lernen-und-Lehren/content/11015, [[Lernen aus der Geschichte (Learning from History)]] 2013-01-30&lt;/ref&gt;

{{COI|date=December 2016}}

'''Transparency of media ownership''' refers to the public availability of accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date information about media ownership structures to make possible for media authorities and the wider public to ascertain who effectively owns and controls the media. According to the expert Nelly Ognyanova, lack of transparency in media ownership is one of the major problem in the [[Media of Bulgaria|media system in Bulgaria]].&lt;ref name=OBC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Areas/Bulgaria/Media-concentration-and-media-ownership-in-Bulgaria-156381  |title= Media concentration and media ownership in Bulgaria|date= 17 October 2014|website= www.balcanicaucaso.org |access-date=5 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Bulgaria]] there are specific provisions concerning print, electronic media and broadcast media. The relevant law, in particular the ''Law on Radio and Television and the Law on Mandatory Deposition of Press and Other Works'', requires the submission of data identifying the actual owners of electronic and print media and online registers are available to the public. Also, a law imposing restrictions on offshore companies to acquire shares and assets in different fields including the media sector, entered into force in 2014. In addition, under Bulgarian law, media are obliged to provide information about ownership upon request in conformity with the provisions set forth in the ''Law on Access to Public Information''. Despite the existence of these legal transparency obligations, there are several problems concerning, on one side the application of the rules, on the other, the requirements themselves, which are not enough effective in ensuring the disclosure of the actual owners. Also, legal requirements are constantly circumvented and sanctions usually not applied. Moreover, according to experts, the law should not be limited to obligations concerning the ownership, but expand its scope to examine the origin of funding of media outlets as well.&lt;ref name=OBC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aej-bulgaria.org/eng/p.php?post=2420  |title= Shedding light on media ownership in Bulgaria: 6 necessary steps|date= 10 November 2015|website= Associations of European Journalists – Bulgaria |access-date=5 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Overall, despite recent legislative changes, some loopholes remain, allowing non-transparency as regards to media ownership and funding and making possible to circumvent the law and conceal who the true owners of the media are. According to expert Ognyanova, there are several ways of circumventing the legal requirements: one example is the case of Krasikir Gergov, a former agent of the Communist-era State Security services and owner of advertising agencies that, while acting in the guise of a “consultant”, actually had a share of the ownership and a contract allowing him to exercise control over the newsroom of a media outlet in Bulgaria.&lt;ref name=OBC/&gt; According to Professor Georgi Lozanov, a former member of the Council for Electronic Media, the introduction of the [[Access to public information in Bulgaria|Access to Information Law]] could help in making more transparent the media sector, in particular media ownership and sources of funds which are largely opaque in Bulgaria. "There is no transparency of media capital whatsoever and one never knows what the real situation is [...]. The introduction of the Access to Information Act [...] represented an attempt at bringing the media to supply information about the sources and funds. Because, if you set up a media outlet and sell a product which is directly related to freedom of speech, it is normal to be able to track the business from the very beginning, thai is, to track the genealogy of the message in the business sense", remarked Professor Lozanov.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www3.mirovni-institut.si/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/media-ownership-and-its-impact-on-media-independence-and-pluralism.pdf|title=Media Ownership and its Impact on Media Independence and Pluralism|last=Petković|first=Brankica|publisher=Peace Institute, Institute for Contemporary Social and Political Studies|year=2004|isbn=961-6455-26-5|location=Ljubljana,|pages=94|chapter=Bulgaria}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Media-specific disclosure requirements for print media==

In Bulgaria media organisations are required to report ownership information to a media authority under the ''Mandatory Deposition of Print and Other Materials Act'' (MDPOMA), in force since January 2001 and amended in 2010. The law covers only the print media and provides that information on ownership should be reported to the Ministry of Culture which has the responsibility to collect and publish online data on ownership submitted by print media. The law does not require the disclosure of the size of shareholding but includes the disclosure of the names of people holding shares on behalf of another ([[beneficial ownership]]) through brokerage and provides a definition of "ultimate owner"&lt;ref name=CSD&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= March 2015 |title= Media ownership in Bulgaria: State of Play and challenges|url=http://www.csd.bg/fileSrc.php?id=22656 |journal= Center for the Study of democracy |issue= Policy Brief No. 46 |access-date=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, under the MDPOMA law, newspapers and magazines are obliged to disclose their ownership data directly to the public through the publication of this information on the first issue of each newspaper each calendar year and every time there is a change in ownership or control of the media organisation.&lt;ref name=AI1&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.access-info.org/tmo/12122 |title=Bulgaria TMO Consultation|last=|first=|date=2013|publisher=Access-info.org |access-date=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, existing obligations under MDPOMA does not, on its own, allow to know the legal or natural persons who effectively own and ultimately control the media operating in Bulgaria because the size of shareholding is not made public. This information can only be obtained by cross-referencing the data provided under MDPOMA with those available in the Company Register, a public register containing ownership information on all the registered companies in the country.&lt;ref name=AI2&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.scribd.com/document/162173507/TMO-Bulgaria |title=Transparency of media ownership. The legal framework: Bulgaria|last=|first=|date=2013|publisher=Access-info.org |access-date=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another weakness in the transparency system of print media concerns the lack of guarantees for disclosing equity that secure media financially and by which ownership is acquired.&lt;ref name=CSD/&gt; Besides criticism regarding legal provisions themselves, the implementation is another matter. Indeed, a further critical point concerns the effectiveness of the disclosure regime, with particular regard with the functioning of the sanctions system required by the law. As a matter of fact, according to public records consulted by [[Access-Info Europe]], in the past few years there have not been cases of sanctions applied despite the fact that there have been evidence of cases of non-disclosure. This situation led to an article in the magazine ''Capital Weekly'' on January 2012 that revealed that many authorities in Bulgaria are not familiar with their obligations under the law.&lt;ref name=AI2/&gt; A study conducted in 2014 shows that a series of important ownership changes in the Bulgarian media system that occurred in that year had not been recorded as it should have been done.&lt;ref name=CSD/&gt; There are also journalistic investigations corroborating the fact that publishers of print media fail to comply with their duty to submit the required data and no fine have been imposed to sanction this.&lt;ref name=CSD/&gt;

==Media-specific disclosure requirements for broadcast media==

The broadcast media are covered by the ''Radio and Television Act'' (RTA), adopted in 2008 and amended in 2010 and 2012. The law provides that broadcast media should present ownership data to the Electronic Media Council which has the responsibility to maintain public registers containing, among others, the data on ownership collected by the Council. In particular, the law provides the disclosure of data on natural or legal persons exerting control over the management structure of the media concerned. The law defines "control over the media services provider" when a person controls, also by means of connected persons, more than 50% of the voters, or could directly or indirectly appoint more than 50% of the managing body of the media services provider, or could exert a significant influence on the decision-making process. Also, according to the RTA, interests held by owners (for instance, as shareholder or partner) in other media organisations have to be made public. Ownership information collected in the Register can be accessed online.&lt;ref name=AI1/&gt;&lt;ref name=AI2/&gt;

The major weak point of the disclosure regime for broadcast media concerns the fact that the obligation to make public the size of beneficial owners through brokerage is non-existent, even if, at the moment, brokerage is not a common practice in ownership media patterns in Bulgaria.&lt;ref name=AI2/&gt;

==Non Media-Specific Transparency Requirements==

The law regulates the disclosure of ownership information for media organisations regularly registered as companies is the Company Register Act adopted in 2006 and in force since January 2008. As not all media are registered companies, as a matter of fact this law does not cover all media outlets operating in Bulgaria. For the media companies covered by the scope of this law, information have to be made to the Company Register, which is a public register. Information to be disclosed under this law includes: names of directors, names of shareholders (comprising beneficial shareholders through brokerage), members of management and supervisory boards, size of shareholdings, management details, the outcome of the company decision-making process, financial reports, constitutive acts, etc. Information on those with indirect control is also made public. This information is recorded electronically and available to the public online via the company register website maintained by the Registry Agency. Even if not all media operating in Bulgaria are covered by the scope of this provisions, overall, the information to be disclosed in the Company Register is quite comprehensive and is usually sufficient to ascertain the owners of the media registered as companies.&lt;ref name=AI2/&gt;

==Transparency requirements regarding Access to Public Information==

The Bulgarian law on [[Access to public information in Europe|Access to Public Information]] sets forth some general requirements concerning transparency regarding management and ownership of the media. According to the law, citizens and legal persons are entitled to access information regarding:
* persons taking part in the management of exercise effective control over the management or operations;
* economically associated persons who take part in the management of other mass media and that exercise control in the media;
* information about the financial results of the media owner.&lt;ref name= CSD/&gt;
