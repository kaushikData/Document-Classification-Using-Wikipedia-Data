==Business history==
A one time chairman of [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange|Københavns Fondsbørs]] ([[English language|English]]: Copenhagen Stock Exchange),&lt;ref name=akp_his1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Pedersen was also involved with [[Akademisk Boldklub]], a [[Association football|football]] club based in [[Gladsaxe]], [[Copenhagen]], as vice-chairman. He was one of three major shareholders, before taking up the role in 2000. His involvement included, but not limited to, sponsorship agreements and contract negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ludvigsen |first=Jesper |date=5 November 2002 |url=http://www.bt.dk/sport/ab-det-foererloese-skib |title=AB - det førerløse skib |work=B.T. |publisher=Det Berlingske Officin |accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pedersen is involved with a diverse selection of Danish investments which include hotel services, industry, travel, sports, food and medicine, of which 10 or more he is chairman or a board member of.&lt;ref name=akp_his1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He is also vice-chairman of the Divisionsforeningen ([[English language|English]]: The Danish League), where he was on the board before taking over the role in 2008, replacing [[Niels-Christian Holmstrøm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.divisionsforeningen.dk/Bestyrelsesmedlemmer.htm |title=Divisionsforeningens bestyrelse sæson 2009-2010 |publisher=Divisionsforeningen |accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Vendelboe |first=Pierre |url=http://www.bold.dk/nyt/FCN-boss-ny-naestformand |title=FCN-boss ny næstformand  |publisher=Bold.dk |language=Danish |date=6 September 2008 |accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports ownership==
===F.C. Nordsjælland===
Allan K. Pedersen started investing in FCN when the club was in financial difficulty, before buying further shares to gain ownership in the club with holding company AKP Holding with himself as director and his wife Bente Pedersen, as chairman.&lt;ref name=akp_his1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During his initial time as chairman of FCN, he would control many aspects of the club, including player purchases and sales, as well as scouting and talent development. Gradually delegating these responsibilities to then head coach [[Morten Wieghorst]] and sports director Jan Laursen.&lt;ref name=akp_power1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bold.dk/nyt/Wieghorst-faar-magten-i-FCN |title=Wieghorst får magten i FCN  |publisher=Bold.dk |language=Danish |date=19 April 2006  |accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=akp_power2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bold.dk/nyt/Laursen-afloeser-Allan-K-Pedersen |title=Laursen afløser Allan K.

{{Update|section|date=September 2015}}
In October 2008, Allan K. Pedersen sold F.C. Nordsjælland from AKP Holding to himself for a reported 500,000 [[Danish kroner]], shortly before his holding company went bankrupt. A price Pedersen denies. Following an investigation from his creditors, it was found the sale was forced through without the bank's consent, and that the value for which the club was sold was too low, which ultimately reduced the finances the creators received for the sale. FCN was reevaluated to be worth 35 million kroner at the time of sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Horn |first=Jakob |url=http://www.bold.dk/nyt/Allan-K-Pedersen-solgte-FCN-til-sig-selv |title=Allan K.

'''Anna Gould''' (June 5, 1875 &amp;ndash; November 30, 1961) was an American [[heir]]ess and [[socialite]], the daughter of [[financier]] [[Jay Gould]].&lt;ref name=timeobit/&gt;

==Early life==
Anna Gould was born on June 5, 1875 in New York City. She was the daughter of [[Jay Gould]] (1836–1892) and Helen Day Miller (1838–1889).  Her siblings included [[George Jay Gould I]], [[Edwin Gould I]], [[Helen Miller Gould]], and [[Frank Jay Gould]].

Ehrhart's "An International High Noon Divorce"}}[[File:Gould-Anna 01.jpg|thumb|Anna Gould (1875-1961)]]
On March 14, 1895, she married [[Paul Ernest Boniface de Castellane]] (1867–1932), elder son and heir apparent of the Marquis of Castellane, in [[Manhattan, New York]]. He was commonly referred to as ''Boniface de Castellane'' with the nickname "Boni" and used the courtesy title of Count of Castellane (''Comte de Castellane''). Before their divorce, Boni and Anna had five children together:

* Marie Louise de Castellane (b. 1896)
* Boniface, Marquis de Castellane (1896–1946), who married Yvonne Patenôtre, a daughter of [[Jules Patenotre des Noyers|Jules Patenôtre]] and Eleanor Elverson, a relative of the owners of ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''
* Georges Paul Ernest de Castellane (1897/9–1944), who married Florinda Fernández y Anchorena (b. 1901)
* Georges Gustave de Castellane (c. 1898-1946)
* Jay (Jason) de Castellane (1902-1956)

'''Arthur Kinmond Bell''', also known as '''AK Bell''', (4 October 1868–16 April 1942) was a Scottish distiller, working as a partner of [[Arthur Bell &amp; Sons Ltd]], and as a philanthropist, founding the [[Gannochy Trust]] to help support the people of his home city of [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]].

==Birth and family life==
Throughout much of his life Bell resided in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], born on 4 October 1868 at Moncreife Terrace, Craigie, Perth. Educated first at [[Perth Academy]] he later moved to [[Edinburgh]] continuing his studies at [[Craigmount School]].&lt;ref name=Oxford_DNB&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weir|first1=Ronald B.|title=Bell, Arthur|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=50406&amp;back=|website=Oxford DNB|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899 Bell married Miss Cammilla Bruce.&lt;ref name=Chronology&gt;{{cite web|title=Arthur Kinmond Bell – Chronology|url=http://www.gannochytrust.org.uk/community/arthur-kinmond-bell-chronology|website=Gannochy Trust|accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony was conducted in her native city of Edinburgh, but with both in their late 30s at the time of the marriage, a life without children seemed probable. It has been speculated that this contributed to his desire to make a lasting mark, leading to his [[philanthropy]].&lt;ref name=Duncan_2012&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duncan|first1=Jeremy|title=A Roof Over One's Head|date=2012|publisher=Farquhar and Son Ltd|location=Perth|isbn=978-0-9560620-7-9|pages=16–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Bell joined the family business as a partner in 1895, following in the path of his father and grandfather.&lt;ref name=Bells_History&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nielson|first1=AC|title=Our History|url=http://www.bells.co.uk/?History|website=Bell's|publisher=Bell's|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quickly made his mark, and along with his brother, Robert, succeeded in doubling the company's profits before his father's death in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duncan|first1=Jeremy|title=A Roof Over One's Head|date=2012|publisher=Farquhar and Son Ltd|location=Perth|isbn=978-0-9560620-7-9|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time Bell, as the eldest son, became managing director, and continued to expand the business despite the setbacks of the [[Great Depression]] and [[Prohibition in the United States]], becoming governor director in 1921 when the company became a limited company.&lt;ref name="Courier at RootWeb"&gt;{{cite news|title=Perth's Tribute to A. K. Bell extract available at RootsWeb|url=http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/SANDEMAN/2004-10/1097742672|accessdate=13 July 2014|work=The Courier and Advertiser|date=4 July 1994|ref=The Courier and Advertiser}}&lt;/ref&gt; This expansion was achieved in large part through the use of advertising and agents, many of whom were members of his extended family living throughout the empire, and included the friendly takeover of three distilleries between 1933–1936. By the time of Bell's death in 1942, the company's profits were in excess of £100,000 per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chambers Scottish Biographical Dictionary|date=1992|publisher=Chambers Ltd|location=Edinburgh and New York|isbn=0-550-16043-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in his life, Bell saved the Perth linen industry by financially backing the one remaining company, John Shields and Co. intervening at the request of the [[Lord Provost]] Robert Nimmo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Perth Authority on Linen Manufacture|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19390626&amp;id=y0VAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kYUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3825,4070184|accessdate=12 July 2014|agency=Glasgow Herald|publisher=Herald and Times Group|date=26 June 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; The apparent and imminent closure of this company came as a shock to the [[Perth and Kinross Council|local council]], and the loss of 300 jobs would have been a blow to the city,. For his contribution Bell receiving the Freedom of Perth, and the workers of the company presented him with a parchment tribute as a thanks for his part in turning the company into a successful and growing enterprise.&lt;ref name=Duncan_2012 /&gt; Following his purchase of the company, Bell reconstructed the firm and re-equipped it for artificial fibre production, helping to secure the business into the future.&lt;ref name=Oxford_DNB /&gt;

==Philanthropic activities==
:"After a man has a roof over his head and his bread and butter is fairly well assured and has a surplus, I think you will agree with me that it is only common sense that he should spend part of that surplus for the benefit of his native city."&lt;ref name=75_Celebration&gt;{{cite news|title=Perth-born distiller Arthur Kinmond remembered|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/perth-born-distiller-arthur-kinmond-remembered-2731937|accessdate=10 July 2014|work=Daily Record|date=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This quotation from Bell's acceptance of the Freedom of Perth sums up his approach to philanthropy, and how as a beneficiary of the then booming [[Scotch whisky]] trade, Bell prospered and was able to look to benefit his home city. His first major project in this direction was the building of the Gannochy Housing Estate between 1924 and 1932.&lt;ref name="Bell and Trust"&gt;{{cite web|title=A K Bell and the Gannochy Trust|url=http://www.gannochytrust.org.uk/index.php?page=a-k-bell|website=Gannochy Trust|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model housing scheme was intended to benefit the hardworking of a younger generation, who had survived the harshness of war and were now looking to better themselves, with many of the original tenancies being granted to workers of Bell &amp; Sons.&lt;ref name=Duncan_2012 /&gt;

His next major project was the establishment of the [[Gannochy Trust]] in 1937,&lt;ref name=Chronology /&gt; founded partly to maintain the Gannochy estate and partly to ensure the continuing improvement of his native city into the future, even after his death.&lt;ref name="Bell and Trust" /&gt;

After housing, the other major concern for post-war Perth was the supply of clean water, with the [[River Tay]] becoming increasingly polluted. In answer to this problem Bell provided shares in Bell's Whisky to the Gannochy Trust for the purpose of establishing Sewage treatment works for Perth and the surrounding villages, having previously commissioned a survey of what needed to be done to improve the situation in 1925. In total the trust was able to provide £640,000 towards the projects, with the one in Perth being completed in 1971.&lt;ref name="Bell and Trust" /&gt;

==Recognition==
In contrast to many of his local contemporaries, such as [[John Dewar, 1st Baron Forteviot]] and [[Robert Pullar]], Bell received comparatively few public honours for his philanthropic activities during his life.&lt;ref name=Duncan_2012 /&gt; One distinction he did receive, on 18 March 1938, was the Freedom of Perth,&lt;ref name=Chronology /&gt; which he described as his greatest honour. This honour was granted primarily for his role in saving John Shields and Co. rather than for any of his philanthropic activities, which appear to have been done quietly and gone without any major public awareness during his life, a fact he would likely have been grateful for.&lt;ref name=Duncan_2012 /&gt;

In 1994, the decision was taken to name Perth's new multi-million-pound library the A. K. Bell library in honour of the man who had played such a large part in the city's history and whose legacy has had such a large impact on the city.&lt;ref name="Courier at RootWeb" /&gt; The library officially opened in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lambert|first1=Tim|title=A Brief History of Perth|url=http://www.localhistories.org/perth.html|website=localhistories.org|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Arthur Kinmond Bell died unexpectedly of illness on 26 April 1942.&lt;ref name=Duncan_2012 /&gt; His will, though, proved him to be as generous in death as he was in life, gifting to 3 senior employees of Arthur Bell and Sons the sum of £5000, to all staff with 10 years experience in the company, £500, and to his gardeners, chauffeurs, and servants in his employ for 10 years or more, £200, all significant amounts for those who benefitted.&lt;ref name="Courier at RootWeb" /&gt;

At the time of his death Bell was living in Kincarrathie House, Perth, with his wife. Camilla later donated the house to the Kincarrathie Trust, who now run the house as a retirement home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kincarrathie House|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst89862.html|publisher=Gazetteer for Scotland|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Articles of incorporation''', also referred to as the '''certificate of incorporation''' or the '''corporate charter''', are a document or charter that establishes the existence of a corporation in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].  They generally are filed with the Secretary of State or other [[list of company registers|company registrar]].

An equivalent term for [[limited liability companies]] (LLCs) in the United States is [[articles of organization]]. For terms with similar meaning in other countries, see [[articles of association]].

== United States ==
The articles of incorporation outline the governance of a corporation along with the [[bylaw|corporate bylaws]] and the corporate statutes in the state where articles of incorporation are filed.

The articles of incorporation typically include the name of the corporation, the type of corporate structure (e.g. profit corporation, nonprofit corporation, benefit corporation, professional corporation), the [[registered agent]], the number of authorized shares, the effective date, the duration (perpetual by default), and the names and signatures of the incorporators.

The state fee to file articles of incorporation to incorporate a profit corporation range from $50 - $300, and to incorporate a nonprofit corporation range from $0 -$125.&lt;ref&gt;Entity formation fees [https://www.harborcompliance.com/information/entity-formation-fees].&lt;/ref&gt;

==ICAI==
{{main|Institute of Chartered Accountants of India}}
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India was established under the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 passed by the Parliament of India with the objective of regulating accountancy profession in India.&lt;ref name="act"&gt;Act No. XXXVIII of 1949. See  [http://www.mca.gov.in/Ministry/actsbills/pdf/The_Chartered_Accountants_Act_2006.pdf "Chartered Accountants Act 1949 as amended in 2006"]&lt;/ref&gt; ICAI is the second largest professional accounting body in the world in terms of membership second only to [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants|AICPA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Ranking of Accountancy bodies as per |url=http://worldranking.blogspot.com/2009/08/top-professional-accountancy-bodies.html |publisher=World Ranking Guide Blog }}&lt;/ref&gt; It prescribes the qualifications for a Chartered Accountant, conducts the requisite examinations and grants license in the form of [[Professional certification|Certificate of Practice]]. Apart from this primary function, it also helps various government agencies like [[Reserve Bank of India|RBI]], [[Securities and Exchange Board of India|SEBI]],{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} [[Ministry of Corporate Affairs|MCA]], [[Comptroller and Auditor General of India|CAG]], [[Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India|IRDA]], etc. in policy formulation. ICAI actively engages itself in aiding and advising economic policy formulation. For example, ICAI has submitted its suggestions on the proposed Direct Taxes Code Bill, 2010. It also has submitted its suggestions on the Companies Bill, 2009. The government also takes the suggestions of ICAI as expert advice and considers it favorably. ICAI presented an approach paper on issues in implementing Goods and Service Tax in India to the [[Minister of Finance (India)|Ministry of Finance]]. In response to this, Ministry of Finance has suggested that ICAI take a lead and help the government in implementing [[Goods and Services Tax (India) Bill|Goods and Services Tax]] (GST).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Finmin eyes ICAI role in GST roll-out |url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/finmin-eyes-icai-role-in-gst-rollout/330443 |newspaper=The Financial Express |date=3 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is because of this active participation in formulation economic legislation, it has been designated by A. P. J. Abdul Kalam as a "''Partner in Nation Building''".

'''Buckpasser''' (1963–1978) was an American-bred [[Thoroughbred]] [[racehorse]] that won 9 of his 11 race starts for international record winnings for a two-year-old of $586,090. He was a leading broodmare sire in 1983, 1984, and 1989.

Buckpasser was a [[Bay (color)|bay]] colt that was bred and owned by [[Ogden Phipps]] and foaled at [[Claiborne Farm]] in [[Paris, Kentucky]]. He was by the [[Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year|Horse of the Year]]-winner [[Tom Fool]], and his dam was the stakes-winning mare Busanda, by the [[United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]]-winner [[War Admiral]]. Busanda’s second dam was the Blue Hen broodmare [[La Troienne]] (FR). He was a half-brother to several other horses that included the stakes-winners Bupers (won $221,688) and Bureaucracy ($156,635).  Buckpasser was inbred in the fourth generation (4m x 4f) to the French racehorse and influential sire [[Teddy (horse)|Teddy]].&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;Craig, Dennis, ''Breeding Racehorses from Cluster Mares'', J A Allen, London, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

Racing official Dr. Manual Gilman said of him, "Generally, every horse has about a hundred faults of conformation. I would defy anybody to pick a flaw in Buckpasser." Renowned horse painter [[Richard Stone Reeves]] said, "Buckpasser was the most perfectly proportioned Thoroughbred I have ever seen." Only two horses, [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]] and [[Affirmed]], have since been "in a class with Buckpasser".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thoroughbredchampions.com/biographies/buckpasser.htm# |title=Thoroughbred champions |access-date=2006-09-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909184327/http://www.thoroughbredchampions.com/biographies/buckpasser.htm# |archive-date=2006-09-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racing record==
Buckpasser had two trainers, both since elected to the [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|U.S. Racing Hall of Fame]]. [[William C. Winfrey|Bill Winfrey]] began his training, and when he retired, [[Edward A. Neloy|Eddie Neloy]] took over and prepared Buckpasser for his three-year-old season.

Buckpasser's first race start was on May 13, 1965, in which he ran a poor fourth. It was the only time he did not place. When Buckpasser ran in the [[Flamingo Stakes]], the race was declared a nonwagering event, forever after called the "Chicken" Flamingo.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiletta.com/UTHOF/buckpasser.html&lt;/ref&gt;

After his two-year-old season and spring, he was placed at the top of the Experimental Free Handicap with 126 pounds. Buckpasser developed a quarter crack that kept him out of the 1966 [[Kentucky Derby]], as well as the [[Preakness Stakes|Preakness]] and Belmont Stakes. It took almost three months for the crack to heal.

In [[Chicago]]'s [[Arlington Classic]], [[Kauai King]] ran against the strenuous protests of his trainer. He broke down and was retired, while Buckpasser won the race, setting a new world record for a mile with a time of 1:32 3/5. This record stood for two years until  [[Dr. Fager]] broke it in 1968, running 1:32 1/5. In 1989, Buckpasser's grandson, Hall of Fame Champion [[Easy Goer]], ran a mile in 1:32 2/5.

Buckpasser won 15 consecutive races that included the [[American Derby]] (breaking the track record), the Chicago Stakes, the Brooklyn Derby, the [[Woodward Stakes]], the [[Travers Stakes]], the [[Malibu Stakes]], the [[Brooklyn Handicap]], the [[Lawrence Realization Stakes]], and the two-mile-long [[Jockey Club Gold Cup]]. With 13 victories as a three-year-old, Buckpasser became the first horse to earn more than $1 million  before the age of four. He was named the 1966 [[Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year|American Horse of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1966/11/23/archives/horseofyear-honors-gained-by-buckpasser.html |title=Horse-of-Year Honors Gained by Buckpasser |publisher=New York Times |date=1966-11-23 |accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1966/12/06/archives/racing-magazine-names-buckpasser-horse-of-year.html |title=Racing Magazine Names Buckpasser Horse of Year |publisher=New York Times |date=1966-12-06 |accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His four-year-old season commenced with a win in the San Fernando Stakes. Another quarter crack developed in Buckpasser’s off (right) fore hoof, and he did not race for 4½ months. When he returned, he scored his 15th consecutive victory in the Metropolitan Mile. On June 17, 1967, Buckpasser's winning streak ended with his first and only attempt at racing on grass. He finished third to stablemate Poker in the [[Bowling Green Handicap]] at [[Aqueduct Racetrack]].  [[Assagai (horse)|Assagai]], the 1966 turf-course champion, finished second. As ''[[The Blood-Horse]]'' said in its July 24, 1967, issue: "Never had so many people had so many immunization shots in order to stay home and watch the [[Suburban Handicap]] on Independence Day."  Three reasons were advanced for his defeat: turf, shoes, and weight. Buckpasser also ran that day with his head held in an uncommon way, slightly sideways. No one has ever understood why.

He won 25 of his 31 races, including a 15-race winning streak, earned five [[Eclipse Awards]] between 1965 and 1967, and was inducted to the [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame#Horses in the Hall of Fame|Horse Racing Hall of Fame]] in 1970.&lt;ref name=Buckpasser&gt;{{cite web|title=Buckpasser|url=http://www.equibase.com/profiles/Results.cfm?type=Horse&amp;refno=66037&amp;registry=T |publisher=Equibase |accessdate=May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stud record==
When he retired, Buckpasser was syndicated for $4,800,000: a record $150,000 a share.  He stood at stud at the farm where he was born. In 11 years, he sired 313 foals, of which 35 won stakes races. 
Included in his get were: 
* [[La Prevoyante]] ([[Sovereign Award for Horse of the Year]] in [[Canada]], [[Eclipse Award]] Champion two-year-old filly in the [[United States]], Champion Older Female in Canada),
* [[L'Enjoleur]] (CAN) (won [[Manitoba Derby]], [[Quebec Derby]],  etc.)
* [[Numbered Account (horse)|Numbered Account]], (Champion two-year-old filly, dam of Private Account, sire of undefeated Personal Ensign)
* [[Paristo]] ([[Illinois Derby]])
* [[Quick As Lightning]] ([[1,000 Guineas]])
* [[Relaxing (horse)|Relaxing]] (Champion Older Female, Broodmare of the Year, dam of Belmont Stakes-winner [[Easy Goer]]),
* [[Silver Buck]] ([[Whitney Handicap]], [[Suburban Handicap]], sire of Kentucky Derby-winner [[Silver Charm]])
* [[State Dinner]] ([[Century Handicap]], etc.)
* [[Toll Booth (horse)|Toll Booth]] (Broodmare of the Year).

Though he had three tail-male Kentucky Derby (G1) winners ([[Spend a Buck]]-1985, [[Lil E. Tee]]-1992 and [[Silver Charm]]-1997), his record as a damsire stands out.

Buckpasser was a leading broodmare sire in 1983, 1984, and 1989.  His daughters have produced Champions and Classic Winners: They are led by Hall of Famers [[Easy Goer]] and [[Slew o' Gold]], [[Belmont Stakes]] winners [[Coastal (horse)|Coastal]] and  [[Touch Gold]], and [[With Approval]], as well as [[El Gran Senor]] among a number of other influential stallions such as [[Seeking The Gold]], [[Miswaki]], and [[Woodman (horse)|Woodman]].

==Honors==
In ''The Blood-Horse'' magazine ranking of the [[Blood-Horse magazine List of Top 100 Racehorses of the 20th Century|top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century]], Buckpasser is #14.

Buckpasser died in 1978 at age 15 and is buried at [[Claiborne Farm]].

'''CTQ trees''' ([[critical-to-quality]] trees) are the key measurable characteristics of a product or process whose performance standards or specification limits must be met in order to satisfy the customer. They align improvement or design efforts with customer requirements.

CTQs are used to decompose broad [[customer]] [[requirement]]s into more easily quantified elements. CTQ trees are often used as part of [[six sigma]] methodology to help prioritize such requirements. 

CTQs represent the product or service characteristics as defined by the customer/user. Customers may be surveyed to elicit quality, service and performance data. They may include upper and lower specification limits or any other factors. A CTQ must be an actionable, quantitative business specification.

CTQs reflect the expressed needs of the customer. The CTQ practitioner converts them to measurable terms using tools such as [[DFMEA]]. Services and products are typically not monolithic. They must be decomposed into constituent elements (tasks in the cases of services).

'''Capacity utilization''' or '''capacity utilisation''' is the extent to which an enterprise or a nation uses its installed [[productive capacity]]. It is the relationship between [[output (economics)|output]] that ''is'' produced with the installed equipment, and the potential output which ''could'' be produced with it, if capacity was fully used.

==Engineering and economic measures==
One of the most used definitions of the "capacity utilization rate" is the ratio of actual output to the [[potential output]]. But potential output can be defined in at least two different ways.

===Engineering definition===
One is the "engineering" or "technical" definition, according to which potential output represents the maximum amount of output that can be produced in the short-run with the existent stock of capital. Thus, a standard definition of capacity utilization is the (weighted) average of the ratios between the actual output of firms to the maximum that could be produced per unit of time, with existing plant and equipment (see Johanson 1968). Obviously, "output" could be measured in physical units or in market values, but normally it is measured in market values.

However, as output increases and well before the absolute physical limit of production is reached, most firms might well experience an increase in the average cost of production—even if there is no change in the level of plant &amp; equipment used. For example, higher average costs can arise, because of the need to operate extra shifts, to undertake additional plant maintenance, and so on.

===Economic definition===
An alternative approach, sometimes called the "economic" utilization rate, is, therefore, to measure the ratio of actual output to the level of output ''beyond which the average cost of production begins to rise''. In this case, surveyed firms are asked by how much it would be practicable for them to raise production from existing plant and equipment, ''without raising unit costs'' (see Berndt &amp; Morrison 1981). Typically, this measure will yield a rate around 10 percentage points higher than the "engineering" measure, but time series show the same movement over time.

===Measurement===
[[File:Harddatafredgraph.png|thumb|Capacity utilization (black line) in manufacture in the United States, [[unemployment rate]] (red line, upside down, scale on the right), [[employment rate]] (dotted line)]]
[[File:KapaAuslUSABRDEngl.png|thumb|Capacity utilization in [[manufacturing]] in the [[Germany|FRG]] and in the USA]]
In [[economic statistics]], capacity utilization is normally surveyed for goods-producing industries at plant level. The results are presented as an average percentage rate by industry and economy-wide, where 100% denotes full capacity. This rate is also sometimes called the "operating rate". If the operating rate is high, this is called "full capacity", while if the operating rate is low, a situation of "excess capacity" or "surplus capacity" exists. The observed rates are often turned into indices. Capacity utilization is much more difficult to measure for service industries.

There has been some debate among economists about the validity of statistical measures of capacity utilization, because much depends on the survey questions asked, and on the valuation principles used to measure output. Also, the efficiency of production may change over time, due to new technologies.

For example, [[Michael Perelman]] has argued in his 1989 book ''[[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]], Investment Theory and the Economic Slowdown: The Role of Replacement Investment and q-Ratios'' that the US [[Federal Reserve Board]] measure is just not very revealing. Prior to the early 1980s, he argues, American business carried a great deal of extra capacity. At that time, running close to 80% would indicate that a plant was approaching capacity restraints. Since that time, however, firms scrapped much of their most inefficient capacity. As a result, a modern 77% capacity utilization now would be equivalent to a historical level of 70%.

==Economic significance==
If market demand grows, capacity utilization will rise. If demand weakens, capacity utilization will slacken. Economists and bankers often watch capacity utilization indicators for signs of inflation pressures.

It is often believed that when the utilization rate rises above somewhere between 82% and 85%, price inflation will increase. Excess capacity means that insufficient demand exists to warrant expansion of output. 

All else constant, the lower capacity utilization falls (relative to the trend capacity utilization rate), the better the [[bond market]] likes it. Bondholders view strong capacity utilization (above the trend rate) as a leading indicator of higher [[inflation]]. Higher inflation—or the expectation of higher inflation—decreases bond prices, often prompting a higher yield to compensate for the higher expected rate of inflation.

Implicitly, the capacity utilization rate is also an indicator of how efficiently the [[factors of production]] are being used. Much statistical and anecdotal evidence shows that many industries in the developed capitalist economies suffer from ''chronic'' excess capacity. Critics of market [[capitalism]], therefore, argue the system is not as efficient as it may seem, since at least 1/5 more output could be produced and sold, if buying power was better distributed. However, a level of utilization somewhat below the maximum typically prevails, regardless of economic conditions.

===Modern business cycle theory===
The notion of capacity utilization was introduced into modern [[business cycle]] theory by Greenwood, [[Hercowitz]], and Huffman (1988). They illustrated how capacity utilization is important for getting business cycle correlations in economic models to match the data when there are shocks to [[investment spending]].

==Output gap percentage formula==
As a derivative indicator, the "output gap percentage" (%OG) can be measured as the gap between actual output (AO) and potential output (PO) ''divided'' by potential output and ''multiplied'' by 100%:

:%OG = [(AO – PO)/PO] × 100%.

==FRB and ISM utilization indexes==
In the survey of plant capacity used by the US [[Federal Reserve Board]] for the FRB capacity utilization index, firms are asked about "the maximum level of production that this establishment could reasonably expect to attain under normal and realistic operating conditions, fully utilizing the machinery and equipment in place." 

By contrast, the [[Institute of Supply Management]] (ISM) index asks respondents to measure their current output relative to "normal capacity", and this yields a utilization rate, which is between 4 and 10 percentage points higher than the FRB measure. Again, the time series show more or less the same historical movement.

See: [[Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System]]: Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/current/|title=The Fed - Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization - G.17|author=|date=|website=federalreserve.gov|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Data==
The average economy-wide capacity utilization rate in the US since 1967 was about 81.6%, according to the Federal Reserve measure. The figure for Europe is not much different, for Japan being only slightly higher.

The average utilization rate of installed productive capacity in industry, in some major areas of the world, was estimated in 2003/2004 to be as follows (rounded figures):

===Average utilization rate===
* United States 79.5% (April 2008 — Federal Reserve measure)
* Japan 83–86% (Bank of Japan)
* European Union 82% (Bank of Spain estimate)
* Australia 80% (National Bank estimate)
* Brazil 60–80% (various sources)
* India 70% (Hindu business line)
* China perhaps 60% (various sources)
* Turkey 79.8% (September 2008 — [[Turkish Statistical Institute]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turkstat.gov.tr/PreHaberBultenleri.do?id=2051 |title=Turkish Statistical Institute |publisher=Turkstat.gov.tr |date=2009-04-09 |accessdate=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Canada 87% (Statistics Canada)

'''EQUASS (European Quality in Social Services)''' is an integrated sector-specific [[Quality management|quality]] certification system that certifies compliance of [[social services]] with European quality principles and criteria. EQUASS aims to enhance the [[social sector]] by engaging service providers in quality and continuous improvement and by guaranteeing service users quality of services throughout Europe.

EQUASS,&lt;ref&gt;EQUASS website, www.equass.be, accessed on 26/08/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; formerly called the European Quality in Rehabilitation Mark (EQRM) is an initiative of the [[European Platform for Rehabilitation|European Platform for Rehabilitation (EPR)]] &lt;ref&gt;European Platform for Rehabilitation website, http://www.epr.eu/, accessed on 26/08/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and its secretariat is based in [[Brussels]].

== History ==

In July 1995, the European Platform for Rehabilitation, then called the European Platform for Vocational Rehabilitation (EPVR),&lt;ref&gt;EPR Annual report 2002 [http://www.epr.eu/images/EPR/documents/annual_reports/EPR%20AR%202002.pdf] accessed on 18/09/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; tasked its working group "Quality management and cost effectiveness" to study the launch of a "Quality Award for Vocational Rehabilitation"&lt;ref&gt;EPR Annual report 2001 [http://www.epr.eu/images/EPR/documents/annual_reports/EPR%20AR%202001.pdf] accessed on 18/09/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; for European institutes of vocational rehabilitation. 
The award would require an audit which, if successful, would show that the institute of vocational rehabilitation works in accordance with the standards of the platform. 
The certification system to be launched was mainly inspired by the [[Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities|CARF]] certification.&lt;ref&gt;Brigitte van Lierop, May 2003, "Een europees kwaliteitskeurmerk voor re-integratiebedrijven", ''Maandblad Re-integratie''&lt;/ref&gt;
The European Platform for Rehabilitation enrolled a few of its members to implement the quality standard that was then named EQRM (European Quality in Rehabilitation Mark). The first awarding event took place in Rome in December 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epr.eu/images/EPR/documents/annual_reports/EPR%20AR%202003.pdf EPR Annual report 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;
The main values behind the quality mark were: 
* A [[Person-centred planning|client-focused]] approach of rehabilitation services
* An awareness of the rights of service users
* The involvement and [[empowerment]] of service users
* A systematic enhancement of [[quality of life]]
* [[Employee engagement|Motivation of staff]]
* Efficient business management practices
* Measuring and proving the service outcomes and results
* Services providers that are accountable for their actions and their use of [[Government spending|funds]]

In 2008,&lt;ref&gt;EQUASS NewsFlash, September 2008, Issue n°1 [http://www.epr.eu/images/EPR/documents/equass/newsflash/newsflash0908.pdf] accessed on 18/09/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; the European Platform for Rehabilitation decided to create an additional quality assurance mark (EQUASS Assurance), alongside its EQRM mark (now renamed EQUASS Excellence).
In December 2008 the European Platform for Rehabilitation launched a two-year project, partially funded by the Progress programme of the [[European commission|European Commission]]. The aim of the project was to develop, with the collaboration of the major European stakeholders in social services, a European Quality Framework for Social Services of General interest (SSGI). The Framework would include quality principles and criteria for quality assurance validated for the whole sector, and operational performance indicators for measuring and benchmarking performance on the quality criteria in social services.&lt;ref&gt;Guus van Beek and Brigitte van Lierop, July - August 2009, "EQUASS: Europese kwaliteitscertificering in de sociale sector", ''Maandblad Re-integratie'', pages 12-15&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2010, the platform launched the results of the Common Quality Framework for SSGI,&lt;ref&gt;Common Quality Framework [http://cms.horus.be/files/99931/Newsletter/3-CEN-WSA-51-Common-Quality-Framework-SSGI.pdf], accessed on 28/08/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; including the certification of a few pilot sites in charge of testing the new quality system in various types of social services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epr.eu/index.php/equass/hidden-equass/24-hidden-equass/145-prometheus-project-newsletter Prometheus Project] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130918011716/http://www.epr.eu/index.php/equass/hidden-equass/24-hidden-equass/145-prometheus-project-newsletter |date=2013-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In January 2012,&lt;ref&gt;EQUASS Annual Report 2012 [http://issuu.com/eprehab/docs/equass_annual_report_2012_final_eb3447696d3dd2] accessed on 18/09/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; EQUASS deployed its new quality standard, now available for all social service providers in Europe, and no longer limited to rehabilitation providers and other disability services providers. The new quality standard was then based on the results of the Common Quality Framework for SSGI, but also other quality standards, listed below.

== Main EQUASS characteristics ==

=== Compliance with the European quality requirements ===

Social services providers that meet the certification requirements for European Quality in Social Services have demonstrated their compliance with the following requirements:

- The Voluntary European Quality Framework for Social Services &lt;ref&gt;Social Protection Committee, October 2010, "A voluntary European Quality Framework for Social Services" [http://www.socialsecurity.fgov.be/eu/docs/agenda/26-27_10_10_spc_qf_document.pdf], accessed on 28/08/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; which was adopted by the [http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=758&amp;langId=en Social Protection Committee] in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Karolina |last1=Krzystek |year=2012 |title=What is Quality in the Sector of Services Working with Homeless People? |journal=Homeless in Europe |pages=5–7 |url=https://www.feantsa.org/download/homeless_in_europe_spring_20121455348018833533690.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

- The Common Quality Framework for Social Services of General Interest &lt;ref&gt;Guus van Beek, "Common Quality Framework for Social Services of General Interest", June 2010, Brussels [http://cms.horus.be/files/99931/Newsletter/3-CEN-WSA-51-Common-Quality-Framework-SSGI.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; (December 2010) in which 50 major stakeholders from various social services sectors agreed on the different components and pre-conditions of quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Guus |last1=van Beek |year=2012 |title=EQUASS: European Quality in Social Services and its Relevance for Homeless Services |journal=Homeless in Europe |pages=18–20 |url=https://www.feantsa.org/download/homeless_in_europe_spring_20121455348018833533690.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

- [[Vocational Education and Training]] institutions that fulfil the criteria for EQUASS also comply with the [http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/education_training_youth/lifelong_learning/c11108_en.htm European Quality Assurance Reference Framework for VET]&lt;ref&gt;European Quality Assurance Reference Framework for VET (now EQAVET): [http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/education_training_youth/lifelong_learning/c11108_en.htm], accessed on 28/08/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; which was adopted by the [[European Parliament]] and the [[European Council]] on 18 June 2009.

- The [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities|UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] (December 2006).

=== Principles of Quality ===

EQUASS is built on ten quality principles that reflect the wishes of its European stakeholders (funders, social partners, client representatives and advocacy groups),&lt;ref&gt;Guus Van Beek, December 2011, "Quality approaches in social services at the European Level" [http://www.epr.eu/images/EPR/documents/equass/EQUASS%202012/Paper_on%20_QUALITY_APPROACHES_IN%20SOCIAL_SERVICES.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; balancing business efficiency requirements, with a strong focus on protecting the rights of the clients, and a [[Person-centred planning|person-centred]] approach, while ensuring a professional development and training of the staff.

[[File:EQUASS Principles of Quality graph.jpg|thumb|Presentation of EQUASS Principles of Quality|framed|center]]

== EQUASS certification programmes ==

EQUASS certification offers a formal recognition of meeting the European quality requirements. EQUASS Assurance and EQUASS Excellence are based on the same Principles for Quality, with EQUASS Assurance being a stepping stone towards achieving the EQUASS Excellence level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Jurij |last1=Švajger |date=June 2011 |title=Uvedba sistemov in orodij za obvladovanje kakovosti v zdravstveno organizacijo |trans-title=Introduction of quality systems and tools for quality management in a health organization |language=sl |journal=Slovensko združenje za kakovost in odličnost: Kakovost |url=http://szko.si/uploads/revija_kakovost/Q-2011-02.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quality Assurance in Social Services (EQUASS Assurance) ===

EQUASS Assurance guarantees quality of service provision by certifying compliance with 50 criteria based on the ten Principles for Quality. It can be viewed as a fundamental requirement for operating social services, having a feasible threshold in terms of costs, efforts and resources required. An organisation that meets the EQUASS Assurance criteria is certified for a two-year period.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

=== Excellence in Social Services (EQUASS Excellence) ===

EQUASS Excellence is awarded to service providers that can demonstrate achievements and continuous improvement on all 50 criteria based on the ten Principles for Quality from three different perspectives: approach, deployment and results. An organisation that meets the EQUASS Excellence criteria is certified for a three-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Guus |last1=van Beek |year=2012 |title=Qualidade e certificação - Qualificação dos serviços sociais |trans-title=Quality and certification - Qualification of social services |language=pt |journal=AFID Diferença Magazine |volume=10 |issue=16 |pages=10–4 |url=https://www.afid.pt/wp-content/uploads/afid_dif_16.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== EQUASS stakeholders and supervision ==

EQUASS is supervised and supported by a network of external and internal stakeholders. The EQUASS Awarding Committee comprises key European actors in social services and EU politics.

=== EQUASS Awarding Committee ===

All awarding processes are supervised by the European Awarding Committee. The Committee includes many of the key European stakeholders in the sector such as service users, social partners, service providers, policy makers and funders:

[[File:EQUASS certified organisations.jpg|thumb|European map of organisations certified with EQUASS|framed|center]]

In [[Norway]], EQUASS Assurance certification is one of several quality labels that allow a disability service provider or social firm to get funding from the [[Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration|Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV)]] in exchange for providing rehabilitation services.&lt;ref&gt;"EQUASS og erfaringene med kvalitetssikringsarbeidet til forhåndsgodkjente tiltaksbedrifter", Norwegian Ministry of Labour [http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/ad/dok/nouer/2012/nou-2012-6/16/4.html?id=674741], accessed on 18/09/2013.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of that endorsement, about 75% of the EQUASS Assurance certified organisations are located in Norway (as of 2013).

In [[Greece]], a research paper published in 2013 in the Disability and Health Journal found that "[The] EQUASS initiative, developed according to European standards and implemented in resource-limited settings, was recognized as the most adaptive and appropriate system for Greek rehabilitation settings". The articles further claims that the "EQUASS initiative emerged as the most appropriate for implementation in the Greek health care setting, since it addresses a large number of existing problems, [...] and has already been partially applied in the Greek welfare sector."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.dhjo.2013.01.005 |pmid=23769474 |title=Quality assessment systems in rehabilitation services for people with a disability in Greece: A critical review |journal=Disability and Health Journal |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=157 |year=2013 |last1=Dimitriadis |first1=Vassilios |last2=Kousoulis |first2=Antonis A |last3=Markaki |first3=Adelais |last4=Sgantzos |first4=Markos N |last5=Hadjipavlou |first5=Alexander |last6=Lionis |first6=Christos }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fitzhugh Lee''' (November 19, 1835 – April 28, 1905) was a [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[cavalry]] [[General officer|general]] in the [[American Civil War]], the [[List of Governors of Virginia|40th]] [[Governor of Virginia]], diplomat, and [[United States Army]] general in the [[Spanish–American War]]. He was the son of [[Sydney Smith Lee]], a [[captain (naval)|captain]] in the [[Confederate States Navy]], and the nephew of General [[Robert E. Lee]].

==Early life==
Lee was born at [[Clermont (Alexandria, Virginia)|Clermont]] in [[Fairfax County, Virginia]]. He was the grandson of [[Light Horse Harry Lee|"Light Horse Harry" Lee]], a nephew of [[Robert E. Lee]] and [[Samuel Cooper (general)|Samuel Cooper]], and cousin of [[George Washington Custis Lee]], [[William Henry Fitzhugh Lee|W.H.F. "Rooney" Lee]], and [[Robert E. Lee, Jr.]]&lt;ref name=Eicher&gt;Eicher, John H. and [[David J. Eicher|Eicher, David J.]] (2001). ''Civil War High Commands.'' Stanford: Stanford University Press. p. 343. {{ISBN|978-0-8047-3641-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, [[Sydney Smith Lee]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas S. Freeman|Freeman, Douglas S.]] (1934–35) [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/People/Robert_E_Lee/FREREL/home.html ''R. E. Lee, A Biography'']. vol. 1, p. 332. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. {{OCLC|166632575}}.&lt;/ref&gt; served under [[Matthew Calbraith Perry|Commodore Perry]] in Japanese waters and rose to the rank of [[Captain (naval)|Captain]]; his mother, Anna Maria Mason Lee, was a granddaughter of [[George Mason]] and the sister of [[James Murray Mason]].&lt;ref name="ev"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://encyclopediavirginia.org/Lee_Fitzhugh_1835-1905 |title=Fitzhugh Lee (1835–1905) |work=Encyclopedia Virginia |date=March 9, 2010 |accessdate=January 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graduating from the [[United States Military Academy]] in 1856, Lee was commissioned a [[Second Lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in the 2nd Cavalry Regiment (later redesignated the [[5th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|5th Cavalry Regiment]]), which was commanded by [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Albert Sidney Johnston]], and in which his uncle, Robert E. Lee, was [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]]. As a [[cavalry]] subaltern, he distinguished himself by his gallant conduct in actions against the [[Comanche]]s in [[Texas]], and was severely wounded in a fight in Nescutunga, Texas, in 1859. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
In May 1860, he was appointed instructor of cavalry tactics at [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], but resigned his commission upon the [[secession]] of Virginia.&lt;ref name="ev" /&gt;

==Civil War==
Lee joined the [[Confederate States Army]] as a lieutenant of cavalry and served at first as a staff officer to [[General officers in the Confederate States Army#Brigadier general|Brig. Gen.]] [[Richard S. Ewell]] at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]]. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the [[1st Virginia Cavalry]] in September 1861, serving under Colonel [[J.E.B. Stuart]]. Lee became colonel of the regiment in March 1862 and was promoted to [[General officers in the Confederate States Army#Brigadier general|brigadier general]] on July 24, 1862. During the [[Northern Virginia Campaign]], Lee received notoriety by arriving late for a concentration of cavalry, which allowed Federal cavalry to raid Stuart's headquarters and capture his famous plumed hat and cape. However, during the subsequent Confederate raid on Catlett's Station, he captured the headquarters tent and dress uniform of [[Union Army|Union]] Maj. Gen. [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]]. Lee gave Pope's coat to Stuart as compensation for the hat he had lost.

Lee performed well in the [[Maryland Campaign]] of 1862, covering the Confederate infantry's withdrawal from [[Battle of South Mountain|South Mountain]], delaying the Union Army advance to [[Sharpsburg, Maryland]], before the [[Battle of Antietam]], and covering his army's recrossing of the [[Potomac River]] into Virginia. Stuart's cavalry made its second ride around the Union Army in the [[Chambersburg Raid]] before returning in time to screen Robert E. Lee's movement towards [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]] where the cavalry defended the extreme right of the Confederate line.  Fitzhugh Lee conducted the cavalry action of [[Battle of Kelly's Ford|Kelly's Ford]] (March 17, 1863) with skill and success, where his 400 troopers captured 150 men and horses with a loss of only 14 men. In the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in May 1863, Lee's reconnaissance found that the Union Army's right flank was "in the air", which allowed the successful flanking attack by Maj. Gen. [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson]], a movement led by Lee's cavalry.
[[File:Fitzhugh Lee General.jpg|thumb|left|Lee during the American Civil War]]
After Chancellorsville, Lee was incapacitated by inflammatory rheumatism, missing a month of action, which included the significant cavalry operations at the [[Battle of Brandy Station]]. He recovered in time to lead a brigade in Jeb Stuart's third ride around the Union Army, in the early days of the [[Gettysburg Campaign]], with his most significant contribution being at the [[Battle of Carlisle]]. During the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], his brigade fought unsuccessfully in the action at [[Battle of Gettysburg, Third Day cavalry battles|East Cavalry Field]]. Stuart's report singled out no officer in his command for praise except Fitz Lee, who he said was "one of the finest cavalry leaders on the continent, and richly [entitled] to promotion."&lt;ref&gt;Tagg, Larry (1998). [https://web.archive.org/web/20080208215607/http://www.generalsandbrevets.com/sgd/daniel.htm ''The Generals of Gettysburg'']. Campbell, California: Savas Publishing. p. 364. {{ISBN|1-882810-30-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the withdrawal from Gettysburg, Lee's brigade held the fords at Shepherdstown to prevent the Union army from following across the Potomac River. Lee was promoted to major general on August 3, 1863,&lt;ref name=Eicher/&gt; and continued to serve under Maj. Gen. Stuart's command, despite Stuart not receiving promotion following his questionable conduct in the Gettysburg Campaign. While his uncle maneuvered the Army of Northern Virginia back into central Virginia, Lee's division launched a successful ambush on Union cavalry at the [[Battle of Buckland Mills]] that fall.

In the [[Overland Campaign]] the following spring, Lee was constantly employed as a [[division (military)|divisional]] commander under Stuart.  Following the [[Battle of the Wilderness]], Lee's cavalry division played a pivotal role in impeding the Union Army in its race to the [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House]]. During the fighting at Spotsylvania, Gen. Stuart was detached from the army for the purpose of thwarting Union cavalry commander [[Phillip Sheridan]]'s raid on Richmond.  Stuart took Fitzhugh Lee's division with him. The mission ultimately ended in the mortal wounding of Gen. Stuart at the [[Battle of Yellow Tavern]] and Lee's inability to break through [[United States Colored Troops]] defense of Fort Pocohontas in [[Charles City County]].  After Stuart's death, Lee served under Maj. Gen. [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]]. Hampton, who had been Lee's peer for much of the war, was promoted to replace Stuart due to his seniority and greater level of experience; some observers at the time had cynically expected Robert E. Lee's nephew to receive the command.

At the [[Battle of Trevillian Station]], Hampton's cavalry prevented Gen. Sheridan's cavalry from aiding General [[David Hunter]]'s force in western Virginia, where it was certain to have inflicted great damage on General Robert E. Lee's supply and communication lines. The battle also served to screen [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lt. Gen.]] [[Jubal A. Early]]'s move from Richmond to aid Lynchburg, which Hunter was set to besiege.  Hampton's cavalry corps shadowed Sheridan's return to Petersburg.

Lee subsequently joined Early for his campaign against Maj. Gen. [[Philip Sheridan]] in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864|Shenandoah Valley]], and at [[Battle of Opequon|Third Winchester]] (September 19, 1864) three horses were shot under him and he was severely wounded.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} When General Hampton was sent to assist General [[Joseph E. Johnston]] in [[North Carolina]], the command of the whole of Robert E. Lee's cavalry devolved upon Fitzhugh Lee on March 29, 1865, but the surrender at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]] followed quickly upon the opening of the campaign. Fitzhugh Lee himself led the last charge of the Confederates on April 9 that year at [[Farmville, Virginia]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

After the war, Lee devoted himself to farming in [[Stafford County, Virginia]], and was conspicuous in his efforts to reconcile the Southern people to the issue of the war, which he regarded as a final settlement of the questions at issue. In 1875, he attended the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]] [[centennial]] at [[Boston]] and delivered a remarkable address. In 1885, he was a member of the board of visitors of West Point, and from 1886 to 1890 was [[governor of Virginia]] having [[Virginia gubernatorial election, 1885|defeated in 1885]] Republican [[John Sergeant Wise]] with 52.77% of the vote.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Lee commanded the third division at both of President [[Grover Cleveland]]'s inaugural parades in 1885 and 1893.&lt;ref&gt;"Gen. Lee to Command: He Will Head a Division in the Inaugural Parade". ''[[The New York Times]]''. February 19, 1893. Retrieved: July 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1896, Lee was appointed consul-general at [[Havana]] by President Cleveland, with duties of a diplomatic and military character added to the usual consular business. In this post (in which he was retained by President [[William McKinley]] until 1898) he was from the first called upon to deal with a situation of great difficulty, which culminated with the destruction of the warship {{USS|Maine|ACR-1|6}}. Upon the declaration of war between Spain and the United States, he re-entered the army.

He was one of four ex-Confederate general officers who were made major generals of United States Volunteers (the others being [[Matthew Butler]], [[Joseph Wheeler]] and [[Thomas L. Rosser]]). Fitzhugh Lee commanded the [[Seventh Army Corps (Spanish–American War)|7th Army Corps]], but took no part in the actual operations in [[Cuba]]. He was military governor of Havana and [[Pinar del Río]] in 1899, subsequently commanded the Department of the [[Missouri]], and retired in 1901 as a brigadier general, U.S. Army.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Lee was an early leader of the committee for the [[Jamestown Exposition]], which would be held after his death at [[Sewell's Point]] on [[Hampton Roads]] in 1907. Lee died in Washington, D.C., and is buried in [[Hollywood Cemetery (Richmond, Virginia)|Hollywood Cemetery]], [[Richmond, Virginia]].

Lee wrote the article about Robert E. Lee in the ''Great Commanders'' series (1894), ''General Lee'', a wartime biography (1894), and ''Cuba's Struggle Against Spain'' (1899).

'''Frank Aloysius Costa''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AO}} (born 1938 in [[Geelong]]) is an entrepreneur and philanthropist. The Geelong native has been a prominent figure in the region for more than four decades, after inheriting the family's produce business in the late 1950s. The company has become largest service wholesaler of fruit &amp; vegetables in the country with operations in five major states.

In 1998, he became president of the [[Geelong Football Club]].

==History==
Costa was the eldest of five sons born to [[Sicily|Sicilian]] immigrants that moved to Australia in the 1880s. His great-uncle established the '''Geelong Covent Garden''' in 1888 – a produce grocery which he ran until the 1920s, at which time he turned it over to Costa's father.

When Costa was 21, he (along with his brother Adrian) convinced his father to sell the business to them. Costa successfully grew the business with help from his brother, as they made forays into [[wholesaling]]. Although Adrian died in 1972 as a result of an automobile accident, and there were a few business blunders along the way – including the failed development of a state-of-the-art warehouse – the remaining Costa brothers were able to keep the business afloat. By the 1980s, the company had an annual [[Revenue|turnover]] to the tune of A$100&amp;nbsp;million.

In the early 1990s, Costa's fruit operation; Costa Logistics, was forced to co-operate with the [[Melbourne underworld]].[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,20675059-24218,00.html]

As of 2006, the company has 800 employees, and a turnover in excess of 800 million. Its head office is an ex-church purchased by the Costa Group and converted into modern offices, located in Myers Street, Geelong.

Costa is the subject of a recent biography,&lt;ref&gt;Des Tobin with foreword by Geoffrey Blainey, (2006), ''Frank Costa. Family, Faith and Footy'', Killaghy Publishing, Malvern, Victoria&lt;/ref&gt; with a foreword by eminent historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]] and references to Geelong identities, the Geelong Football Club, and Italian immigrants in Geelong.

==Philanthropy==
According to a 2004 poll, Costa held first place on the list of the regions ''Movers and Shakers."'' It was also a year that saw him (out of frustration) publicly urge the authorities to keep its promise of developing a [[recycling]] and [[irrigation]] facility in the [[Werribee]] region.

Frank Costa is Patron of the Geelong Volunteer Resource Centre and the Geelong Volunteering Network.

==Political scandals==
His push for the recycling/irrigation plant is one of many events has caused some to raise [[conflict of interest]] concerns, as his company was apt to obtain a substantial benefit from the project. In addition to being a [[Committee for Geelong]] board member and being president of the Geelong Football Club, Costa has been involved in some of the most prominent development projects being touted for the region. These include the development in North Geelong near the Ford site and at Point Richards near [[Portarlington, Victoria|Portarlington]].

In early 2006, Costa was embroiled in controversy due to his undisclosed financial support of political campaigns.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Honours==
At the 1997 Queen's Birthday Honours, Costa was awarded the [[Medal of the Order of Australia|Order of Australia]] for service to youth and to the community of Geelong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Francis Aloysius Costa OAM|url=https://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=875111&amp;search_type=advanced&amp;showInd=true|publisher=[[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]]|date=9 June 1997|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 18 years later at the [[2015 Australia Day Honours]], Costa was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia for distinguished service to the community of Geelong through ongoing roles and contributions to a range of sports, business, religious, medical, educational and social welfare organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Officer (AO) of the Order of Australia in the General Division|url=http://www.gg.gov.au/sites/default/files/files/honours/ad/ad2015/Media%20Notes%20-%20AO.pdf|format=pdf|page=[http://www.gg.gov.au/sites/default/files/files/honours/ad/ad2015/Media%20Notes%20–%20AO.pdf#page=8 8]|publisher=[[Official Secretary to the Governor-General of Australia]]|date=26 January 2015|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costa was also awarded the [[Centenary Medal]] and the [[Australian Sports Medal]] in 2001 for service to the Barwon community&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Francis Aloysius Costa|url=https://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1120704&amp;search_type=advanced&amp;showInd=true|publisher=[[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]]|date=1 January 2001|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for services to Australia football,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Francis Costa|url=https://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=970170&amp;search_type=advanced&amp;showInd=true|publisher=[[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]]|date=16 January 2001|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively.

'''Gil Oved''' (born 16 August 1975) is a South African entrepreneur who is the co-founder and co-CEO of [[The Creative Counsel]], [[South Africa]]’s largest [[advertising agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.entrepreneurmag.co.za/advice/success-stories/entrepreneur-profiles/the-creative-counsel-ran-neu-ner-and-gil-oved/ |title=The Creative Counsel: Ran Neu-Ner and Gil Oved |author= Juliet Pitman |date=1 October 2012 |publisher=Entrepreneur Magazine |access-date=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of the global [[Young Presidents’ Organisation]] where he is the [[Johannesburg]] chapter chair as well as the Africa regional forum officer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ypo.org/ypopodcast/why-did-you-join-ypo-interview-with-gil-oved-group-co-ceo-of-the-creative-counsel/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of the Dragons on the hugely popular television reality show [[Dragons’ Den]] South Africa which premiered in the last quarter of 2014 on [[DSTV]].&lt;ref&gt;http://mzansimagic.dstv.com/profiles/gil-oved/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Oved was chosen as the first "Shark" on the new series of [[Shark Tank]] on [[M-NET]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channel24.co.za/TV/News/meet-the-first-shark-of-shark-tank-sa-20160721 |title=Meet the first 'shark' of Shark Tank SA |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=21 July 2016 |website= |publisher=Channel24 |access-date=22 July 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life==
Oved was born on 16 August 1975 in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]].He matriculated at [[Crawford College, Sandton]], earned a Bachelor of Commerce degree (Cum Laude) at the [[University of South Africa]], and subsequently obtained a chartered financial analyst (CFA) qualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://joburgnorth.getitonline.co.za/2015/01/26/getting-know-gil-oved/|title=Getting to know Gil Oved|date=2015-01-26|work=Get It Online Joburg North|access-date=2018-06-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager at the time of South Africa’s first democratic elections in 1994, Oved’s imagination was fired by the country’s new potential for transformation. He became an anchor presenter for the country’s first multi-racial television teen magazine programme called Zap Mag. He was the anchor presenter from 1990-1995, along with a Vusi Twala. Twala and Oved became close friends and, after they matriculated, started a television production company in 1996 known as Jewazi (a combination of the words Jew and Swazi).

The production company saw some successes over its approximate three years of existence and had programmes commissioned by the SABC (South African Broadcasting Corporation) most noteworthy SuperKidz, but never got the traction needed to create a sustainable business. Oved set his sights on the next goal. He teamed up with a friend from school, [[Ran Neu-Ner]], to start an Internet trading company just as the dot.com bubble was expanding.

The pair raised almost a million dollars and invested three years in developing their business called Wealthmaker but, when the dot.com bubble burst in the early 2000s, their investors went bankrupt, and they followed suit.
Observing that Neu-Ner’s girlfriend of the time, a student who was earning extra money as a promotional field worker, was earning considerably more than they were, Oved and Neu-Ner decided to set up a small low risk, low barrier-to-entry business placing promotional staff.

Although initially a ‘stop-gap’ initiative, both men found that they enjoyed the process of helping clients think through campaigns and began to take very seriously the creative process and execution of brand building through promotions and activations. 

The company grew exponentially, through the acquisition of new clients as well as other businesses in the advertising and marketing sector attracting the attention of Publicis Groupe who bought the Company in September 2015. TCC operates under Publicis Africa Group. Oved remains group co-CEO together with Neu-Ner. The Creative Counsel has retained its name.

Oved lives in the Johannesburg region.

== Television ==
In 2014 Oved became one of the dragons in the first season of South Africa's [[Dragons' Den]] along with [[Vinny Lingham]], [[Lebo Gunguluza]], [[Vusi Thembekwayo]] and [[Polo Leteka Radebe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.destinyman.com/2014/08/08/meet-sas-own-dragons/ |title=Meet SA’s own Dragons |author=Destiny Reporter |date=8 August 2014 |publisher=Ndalo Media |access-date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 was chosen as the first 'Shark' in the South African version of the [[Shark Tank]] series by [[M-Net|MNET]]. The Shark Tank series is sponsored in full by [[Telkom South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/entertainment/2016/07/22/Multi-millionaire-Gil-Oved-set-to-be-the-first-shark-in-M-Net%E2%80%99s-Shark-Tank |title=Multi-millionaire Gil Oved set to be the first shark in M-Net’s Shark Tank |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=22 July 2016 |publisher=TimesLive |access-date=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HVS''' is a [[Consultant|consulting]] firm based in [[Westbury, New York]] that specializes in providing services to the [[hospitality industry]]. As of 2015, HVS operated out of 35 offices located in North America, Europe, Asia, South America, Africa and the Mid-East. In addition to its original offerings of consulting and [[Valuation (finance)|valuation]] services for the lodging industry, HVS today provides multiple hospitality services and specializations in areas such as [[executive recruitment]], [[investment banking]], hotel management, hotel asset management, operational and marketing consulting, litigation support, [[golf]] facilities, court appointed receivership services, [[convention center]]s, and sports, convention and entertainment facilities consulting. The privately held firm performs approximately 5,000 assignments throughout the world for hotel owners, operators, lenders and various institutions each year.

== History ==

Originally known as Hospitality Valuation Services, the company was founded by Steve Rushmore in 1980 in a one-room office in [[Garden City, New York]]. Rushmore, a graduate of the [[Cornell University School of Hotel Administration]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hotelschool.cornell.edu/about/pubs/news/newsdetails.html?id=609 (11-11-2009) Fourth Paragraph. Retrieved 2010-11-16.&lt;/ref&gt; drew upon his experience as head of the hospitality consulting division of [[Helmsley-Spear]], a position he took on in 1971. At that time, there were valuation companies specializing in appraising real estate (but not hotel operations) and accounting firms knowledgeable in hotel operations (but not real estate). Recognizing the need for an appraisal company that specialized in the hospitality arena, Rushmore pursued membership in the [[Appraisal Institute]] (then known as the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers).&lt;ref name="EarlyAI" /&gt; When he received the MAI&lt;ref name="MAI"&gt;Member of the Appraisal Institute; http://www.appraisalinstitute.org/findappraiser/show_Member_Profile.asp?p=RbAKPVd4JnqhrEZbNM3zuaTKNFlFbOj3tG4ORb(1976) Retrieved 2010-11-04.&lt;/ref&gt; [[professional certification|designation]] from the Institute in 1976, Rushmore enjoyed the distinction of being the Institute's only member with a degree in hotel administration.&lt;ref&gt;"The House that Steve Built" (2002-10). Cover story, fourth paragraph. ''Lodging'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

Combining his Appraisal Institute membership with his hotel school degree from Cornell, Rushmore then wrote an appraisal [[textbook]] for the hospitality industry, ''The Valuation of Hotels and Motels'',&lt;ref name="EarlyAI"&gt;http://www.appraisalinstitute.org/about/history.aspx First paragraph. Retrieved 2010-11-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1stBook"&gt;Rushmore, Stephen (1978). {{ISBN|0-911780-44-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which the Institute published in 1978. The text has been updated four times, and the most recent publication is ''Hotels &amp; Motels: Valuations and Market Studies''.&lt;ref&gt;Rushmore, Stephen, and Erich Baum (2001). Appraisal Institute. {{ISBN|0-922154-70-8}}. http://www.appraisalinstitute.org/store/p-19-hotels-and-motels-valuations-and-market-studies.aspx Retrieved 2010-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt; This publication has been described as "the seminal text on the art and science of hotel appraisals".&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, Ed (2010-05-06). "HVS Marks 30th Anniversary". Second paragraph. ''Lodging Hospitality''. http://lhonline.com/consulting/HVS_consulting_appraisal_transactions_0506/index.html Retrieved 2010-10-28.&lt;/ref&gt; This, and other publications by Rushmore, established the methodology for appraising hotels that is today considered an [[Technical standard|industry standard]].&lt;ref name="HansonQuote"&gt;Watkins, Ed (2010-05-06). "HVS Marks 30th Anniversary". Third Paragraph. ''Lodging Hospitality''.	 http://lhonline.com/consulting/HVS_consulting_appraisal_transactions_0506/index.html Retrieved 2010-10-28. Quotation from Bjorn Hanson, Divisional Dean and Clinical Professor of Hospitality and Tourism Management, NYU Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism, and Sports Management.&lt;/ref&gt;

Capitalizing on its singular status as the only consulting and valuation company dedicated solely to the hospitality industry, HVS expanded, opening a West Coast office in San Francisco five years later, followed by offices in London, Colorado, and Florida. Today, the company has a presence in nearly thirty-five cities on five continents.

==Operations==

The organizational structure and operations of HVS are modeled on that of other consulting firms, such as [[McKinsey &amp; Company]], particularly with regards to the company's recruitment of hospitality students from prestigious universities and its compensation structure.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, Ed (2010-05-06). "HVS Marks 30th Anniversary". Seventh paragraph. ''Lodging Hospitality''. http://lhonline.com/consulting/HVS_consulting_appraisal_transactions_0506/index.html Retrieved 2010-10-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the learning curve is steep, those who thrive in the company's [[entrepreneur]]ial environment have the opportunity to transfer to other offices in a different part of the globe. In a May 2010 cover story about HVS, ''Lodging Hospitality'' magazine opined, "The list of alumni reads like a who's who of the most highly regarded consultants, development executives and financial experts in the worldwide lodging industry."&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, Ed (2010-05-06). "HVS Marks 30th Anniversary". First paragraph.	 http://lhonline.com/consulting/HVS_consulting_appraisal_transactions_0506/index.html Retrieved 2010-11-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

To help market its hotel consulting and valuation services, HVS began disseminating a broad spectrum of complimentary information to the lodging industry. HVS encouraged its associates to publish articles on informative, timely, and interesting topics for the lodging industry, and the research and writings of HVS associates are published and cited in a number of [[academic journal]]s.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

HVS conducts seminars on hotel valuation for the Appraisal Institute and other organizations around the world and has trained more than 20,000 appraisers and industry professionals. HVS research and data-gathering about historical and projected hotel value trends, sales transaction data, compensation programs, franchise fees, hotel franchise development costs, and hotel renovation costs provides data to industry participants.&lt;ref&gt;Turkel, Stan (2010-06-19) http://www.bluemaumau.org/welldeserved_compliment_steve_rushmore Second paragraph. Retrieved 2010-11-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and conference sponsorship==

Consistent with the academic background of the company's founder, HVS supports several institutions of higher learning that specialize in hospitality. To foster academic research in the field, HVS endows [[professorial chair]]s at both [[New York University]]'s [[Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism, and Sports Management]] and [[Cornell University]]'s hotel school.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scps.nyu.edu/export/sites/scps/areas-of-study/tisch/hospitality-conference/special-message-from-jonathan-tisch.pdf Dr. Lalia Rach, HVS Professor. Sixth paragraph. Retrieved 2010-11-17.&lt;/ref&gt; HVS also funded Cornell University's Rushmore–Jennings Computer Library &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hotelschool.cornell.edu/about/pubs/news/newsdetails.html?id=287 (2005-02-01). Third paragraph.

First paragraph. Retrieved 2010-11-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, HVS plays a significant role in New York University's International Hospitality Industry Investment Conference, where the company presents its annual report on Hotel Valuation and Transaction Trends for the U.S. Lodging Industry to conference attendees.&lt;ref&gt;http://hotellaw.jmbm.com/2009/06/hospitality_lawyer_what_lies_a.html Butler, Jim and the Global Hospitality Group (2009-06-14). Retrieved 2010-11-17.&lt;/ref&gt; An HVS executive serves as the conference coordinator,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scps.nyu.edu/export/sites/scps/areas-of-study/tisch/hospitality-conference/hospitality-conference-speaker-bios.pdf Page 3. Retrieved 2010-11-17.&lt;/ref&gt; and others associated with the company serve as panel [[Chairman|moderators]] and speakers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scps.nyu.edu/export/sites/scps/areas-of-study/tisch/hospitality-conference/hospitality-conference-speaker-bios.pdf Pages 11, 30, 37. Retrieved 2010-11-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in the months prior to the conference, the firm provides insight for the development of the Manhattan Hotel Market Overview Survey conducted by NYU graduate students. HVS distributes the results of the student survey and analysis to conference attendees as part of the firm's annual Manhattan Hotel Market Overview.

HVS has launched other major industry conferences around the globe, organizing the Hotel Investment Conference South Asia (HICSA),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hicsaconference.com/default.aspx Retrieved 2010-11-17.&lt;/ref&gt; the China Hotel Investment Conference (CHIC),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinahotelconference.com/host.html Retrieved 2010-11-17.&lt;/ref&gt; the Caribbean Hospitality Investment Conference and Operations Summit (CHICOS),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hvschicos.com Retrieved 2012-06-18.&lt;/ref&gt; the Hotel Operations Summit India (HOSI),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hosiconference.com/ Retrieved 2010-11-17.&lt;/ref&gt; and

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4495">The '''International Conference on African Children''' or Conference on the African Child was an international conference held in Geneva in June 1931.

Organised by the [[International Save the Children Union]], it followed on from the adoption by the [[League of Nations]] in 1924 of the [[Declaration of the Rights of the Child]], drafted by the Union in 1923. It focused on the conditions of children in Africa, specifically in the areas of infant mortality, child labour and education. &lt;ref&gt;Hilde Nielssen, Inger Marie Okkenhaug, Karina Hestad-Skeie, ''Protestant Missions and Local Encounters in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries: Unto the Ends of the World'' (BRILL, 2011) page 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference met in Geneva in the summer of 1931, between 22 and 25 June. It is considered a turning point in western attitudes to childhood in Africa: "this conference reconstructed the images of childhood in Africa among missionaries, child welfare humanitarians and social scientists".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kwame Ame, DeBrenna LaFa Agbényiga, Nana Araba Apt, ''Children's Rights in Ghana: Reality or Rhetoric?'' (Lexington Books, 2011) page 23.&lt;/ref&gt; There were only five Africans among the participants, although even this level of participation was unusual at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kwame Ame, DeBrenna LaFa Agbényiga, Nana Araba Apt, ''Children's Rights in Ghana: Reality or Rhetoric?'' (Lexington Books, 2011) page 23.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these was [[Jomo Kenyatta]] of the Kikuyu Central Association.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Holton, ''Global Networks'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2007) page 160.&lt;/ref&gt; Kenyatta wrote about the conference later, on the subject of [[circumcision]] and [[female genital mutilation]], which he defended as a cultural practice among the Kikuyu:

"In this conference several European delegates urged that the time was ripe when this "barbarous custom" should be abolished, and that, like all other "heathen" customs, it should be abolished at once by law."&lt;ref&gt;Jomo Kenyatta, ''Facing Mount Kenya, the Tribal Life of the Gikuyu'', (Secker and Warburg, 1938) page 131, cited in Richard A. Shweder, ''Why Do Men Barbecue?: Recipes for Cultural Psychology'' (Harvard University Press, 2003) page 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other African representatives were teacher and writer Gladys Casely-Hayford, daughter of the Ghanaian politician [[J. E. Casely Hayford]], and Nigerian educator [[Henry Rawlingson Carr|Henry Carr]].&lt;ref&gt;Abosede A. George, ''Making Modern Girls: A History of Girlhood, Labor, and Social Development in Colonial Lagos'' (Ohio University Press, 2014) page 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; Another black speaker was the American activist [[James W. Ford]] of the [[League Against Imperialism]], who gave a speech criticising the conference for merely supporting the colonial order.&lt;ref&gt;Holger Weiss, ''Framing a Radical African Atlantic: African American Agency, West African Intellectuals and the International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers'' (BRILL, 2013) page 405.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference secretary was writer [[Evelyn Sharp (suffragist)|Evelyn Sharp]], who wrote a book about it called ''The African Child''. Another contributor was a missionary, Dora Earthy.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Harries, David Maxwell, ''The Spiritual in the Secular: Missionaries and Knowledge about Africa'' (Eerdmans, 2012) page 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jaime Chicharro Sánchez-Guió''' (1889 - 1934) was a Spanish [[Liberal-Conservative Party (Spain)|Conservative]] and [[Carlism|Carlist]] politician. He is known mostly as the moving spirit behind turning a fishing bay in [[Burriana]] into a modern port, facilitating export of oranges grown in the area. As a politician he is recognized as representative of large proprietors within the Carlist movement.

==Family and youth==
[[File:Ermitacristo.JPG|thumbnail|left|[[Torralba de Calatrava]]]]
Jaime Chicharro Sánchez-Guió was born to a family of [[Castile (historical region)|Castilian]] landowners. His paternal ancestors originated from [[Names of the Basque Country (in Spanish)|Vascongadas]]; his grandfather, [[Jesús Chicharro de la Torre]], was a military engineer and settled in the [[province of Ciudad Real]] following railway construction works.&lt;ref&gt;''Biografia sucinta de D. Jaime Chicharro'', [in:] ''Buris-Ana. Boletín de la Agrupación Burrianense de Cultura'' 77 (1958), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Jaime’s father, [[José Chicharro Martín del Moral]] (1856-1905),&lt;ref&gt;José Chicharro Martín del Moral entry at Geneanet genealogical service, available [http://gw.geneanet.org/sanchiz?lang=en&amp;p=jose&amp;n=chicharro+martin+del+moral here]&lt;/ref&gt; sided with the legitimists during the [[Third Carlist War]].&lt;ref&gt;''Nota biográfica sobre Jaime Chicharro y Sánchez-Guio (1889-1934)'', [in:] ''CED Borriana'', 08.03.2014, available [https://cedborriana.wordpress.com/2014/03/08/nota-biografica-sobre-jaime-chicharro-y-sanchez-guio-1889-1934/ here]; the same source claims, probably after ''Biografia sucinta de D. Jaime Chicharro'', that he reached the rank of a general, though it is not clear how and when he could have reached this honor&lt;/ref&gt; He married Soledad Sánchez-Guió Ruiz-Hidalgo (1860-1912).&lt;ref&gt;Soledad Sánchez-Guio Ruiz-Hidalgo entry at ''Geneanet'' genealogical service, available [http://gw.geneanet.org/sanchiz?lang=en&amp;p=jose&amp;n=chicharro+martin+del+moral here]&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had 4 children, apart from Jaime also three daughters,&lt;ref&gt;''Biografia sucinta de D.

In 1897 the young Jaime entered the [[Jesuit]] Colegio Nuestra Señora del Recuerdo in the [[Madrid]] district of [[Chamartín (Madrid)|Chamartín de la Rosa]].&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 14.01.34 available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1934/01/14/046.html here], ''Biografia sucinta de D.

Jaime Chicharro'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Holding two diplomas he settled in Madrid and assumed the chair of History in same Jesuit college he had attended earlier.&lt;ref&gt;''Nota biográfica sobre Jaime Chicharro y Sánchez-Guio (1889-1934)''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912 Chicharro married Dolores Lamamié de Clairac Romero y Bermúdez de Castro (1890-1974),&lt;ref&gt;''Dolores Lamamie de Clairac Romero'' entry at ''Geni'' genealogical service, available [http://www.geni.com/people/Dolores-Lamamie-de-Clairac-Romero/6000000024129494509 here]&lt;/ref&gt; sister of the [[Salamanca province|Salamanca]] landowner and later a well-known Carlist politician, [[José María Lamamié de Clairac|José María Lamamié de Clairac y de la Colina]]. As she inherited some 300 hectares&lt;ref&gt;''Biografia sucinta de D. Jaime Chicharro'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; around [[Villarreal]] and [[Nules]], the family moved to the spouse's La Salmantina estate, now located in the municipality of [[Les Alqueries]] ([[Castellón province]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Nota biográfica sobre Jaime Chicharro y Sánchez-Guio (1889-1934)'', ''Biografia sucinta de D.

==Young Carlist==
[[File:Juan Vazquez de Mella 1906.JPG|thumbnail|160px|left|[[Juan Vazquez de Mella]]]]
Chicharro inherited his militant ultraconservative outlook after his father, who following the Carlist war service contributed belligerent pieces to the Carlist [[Ciudad Real]] based ''El Manchego'' weekly in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;he contributed under the pen-name “K. Tite” and his article prompted penalty action against the review, see José Narvaez Fernández ''“El Manchego” (1886-1888). La prensa carlista a traves de un periodico regional'', [in:] ''Cuadernos de estudios manchegos'' 8 (1978), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; The leaning was further reinforced when during his Madrid academic years Chicharro met and got fascinated by [[Juan Vázquez de Mella]], the top Carlist theorist.&lt;ref&gt;''Emotivo homenaje a D. Jaime Chicharro en su pueblo natal, Torralba de Calatrava'', [in:] ''Buris-Ana'' 145 (1976), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909 he co-founded the local Centro Tradicionalista&lt;ref&gt;''Biografia sucinta de D. Jaime Chicharro'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and together with other young Carlists he set up ''El Combate'',&lt;ref&gt;''Emotivo homenaje a D.

Represión, Exilio y Memoria Histórica'', [in:] ''Memoria histórica de Plasencia y las comarcas'', Plasencia 2014, {{ISBN|9788469708583}}, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

When following his marriage Chicharro moved to Castellón province he remained in the same political ambience, becoming president of the local Juventud Jaimista&lt;ref&gt;in 1914 he was already reported as former president, ''El Liberal'' 14.10.14, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001710444&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1915 growing to jefe of the Villareal Jaimistas.&lt;ref&gt;reported as hosting Cerralbo during his tours across the country, ''El Liberal'' 14.10.14, also ''La Correspondencia de España'' 01.11.15, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000704387&amp;page=7 here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916 he entered the Castellón Junta Provincial and became its vice-president, going on with his Villarreal jefatura duties.&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Llansola, ''Estructura organizativa i participació electoral del carlisme castellonenc en la decadéncia de la Restauració (1914-1918)'', [in:] Rosa Monlleó Peris, ''Castelló al segle XX'', Valencia 2006, {{ISBN|848021564X}}, 9788480215640, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; The same year for the first time he launched his bid for the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] standing in the Nules district. At that time Valencian Carlism was divided between the mainstream purs and the dissident paquistes,&lt;ref&gt;Llansola 2006, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; followers of [[Francisco Giner Lila]];&lt;ref&gt;''Nota biográfica sobre Jaime Chicharro y Sánchez-Guio (1889-1934)''&lt;/ref&gt; Chicharro seemed to have allied with none and unsuccessfully ran a broad conservative ticket, forming part of the contenders loyal to the [[Murcia]]n party leader, [[Juan de la Cierva y Peñafiel]].&lt;ref&gt;''Nota biográfica sobre Jaime Chicharro y Sánchez-Guio (1889-1934)''; overview of electoral results in Castellon in 1913-1916 in Gerard Llansola Gil, ''Republicanisme, identitat popular i hegemonia municipal: Castelló de la Plana, 1913-1917'', Castellon 2006, {{ISBN|8480215690}}, 9788480215695, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

He tried his luck again in Nules in the subsequent [[Spanish general election, 1918|campaign of 1918]], though political configuration of the time seems particularly obscure and illegible. According to some, he represented the purs faction and was supported by a partially controlled newspaper, ''La Gaceta de Levante'',&lt;ref&gt;Llansola 2006, p. 228, also ''El Sol'' 06.02.18, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000184427&amp;page=4 here]&lt;/ref&gt; opposed by the competing paquistes fraction and the conservative [[Antonio Maura|mauristas]].&lt;ref&gt;Llansola 2006, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; According to another scholar, Chicharro was criticized by orthodox Carlists for his strong predilection for broad Right-wing alliances, blurring the [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalist]] political identity.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Ramón de Andrés Martín, ''El cisma mellista. Historia de una ambición política'', Madrid 2000, {{ISBN|9788487863820}}, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; He lost again, failing to get the ticket also in by-elections staged later that year as the victorious candidate died soon after having been elected.&lt;ref&gt;''Nota biográfica sobre Jaime Chicharro y Sánchez-Guio (1889-1934)'', Llansola 2006, p. 228; many picturesque details available [http://vicentesgrangel.blogspot.com/2013/06/elecciones-en-el-distrito-de-llucena-ii.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1910s Carlism was increasingly divided between its top theorist Juan Vazquez de Mella and the claimant, [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid|Jaime III]]; the former tended to downplay dynastical issues for the sake of advancing a grand Right-wing formation, united by Traditionalist values. Chicharro sympathised with his former Madrid master and emerged as one of the most vehement Mella supporters;&lt;ref&gt;along Pradera, Garcia Guijarro, Careaga, Iglesias and [[José Pascual de Liñán y Eguizábal|conde Doña Marina]], Andrés Martín 2000, pp. 146-7&lt;/ref&gt; when in 1919 the crisis exploded and the Carlists were forced to take sides, he left the claimant and joined the rebels.&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Martín 2000, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Spanish general election, 1919|1919 electoral campaign]] he already represented a broad and somewhat vague conservative platform, advocating a broad Catholic national party of the Right.&lt;ref&gt;''La Epoca'' 11.08.19, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000918904&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources claim he counted among governmental [[maurista]] candidates,&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Martín 2000, p. 171, this version confirmed also in ''El Sol'' 03.06.19, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000209693&amp;page=4 here]&lt;/ref&gt; some present him as a catholic-monarchist, a ciervista&lt;ref&gt;''La Epoca'' 24.05.19, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000913866&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; or a Carlist.&lt;ref&gt;''La Correspondencia de España'' 25.05.19, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000791838&amp;page=6 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally successful,&lt;ref&gt;see the official Cortes service available [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/Iniciativas?_piref73_2148295_73_1335437_1335437.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXD1S.fmt&amp;DOCS=1-1&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;NUM1=&amp;DES1=&amp;QUERY=%2825840%29.NDIP. here]&lt;/ref&gt; when in the Cortes he sided with the ciervistas.&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Martín 2000, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Spanish general election, 1920|1920 re-election campaign]] Chicharro had the loyal Carlists pitted against him,&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 17.11.20, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1920/11/17/009.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; but he managed to renew his ticket&lt;ref&gt;as a ciervista, see ''La Acción'' 10.11.20, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0003573379&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and served in the diet until 1923.&lt;ref&gt;see the official Cortes service, available [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/Iniciativas?_piref73_2148295_73_1335437_1335437.next_page=/wc/servidorCGI&amp;CMD=VERLST&amp;BASE=DIPH&amp;FMT=DIPHXD1S.fmt&amp;DOCS=2-2&amp;DOCORDER=FIFO&amp;OPDEF=Y&amp;NUM1=&amp;DES1=&amp;QUERY=%2825840%29.NDIP. here]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the parliament, at that time dominated by the Conservatives of [[Eduardo Dato]], Chicharro remained a rather restless and turbulent deputy, occasionally sliding to opposition. Apart from the customary anti-liberal diatribes, he was particularly vocal on financial issues, entering into taxation and budgetary disputes with the Minister of Economy.&lt;ref&gt;''La Correspondencia de España'' 19.03.20, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000805923&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; His most lasting achievement is a Royal Order, which marked significant state resources for development of the local [[Burriana]] harbor.&lt;ref&gt;''Nota biográfica sobre Jaime Chicharro y Sánchez-Guio (1889-1934)'', Rios 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The design, apart from massive upgrade of the facilities, envisaged also major investments which connected the port with the national railroad network.&lt;ref&gt;''La familia Chicharro dona a Burriana un plano del proyecto del ferrocarril de la Vilavella al Puerto'' [in:] ''buriana.es'' service 02.03.11, available [http://www.burriana.es/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=663:la-familia-chicharro-dona-a-burriana-un-plano-del-proyecto-del-ferrocarril-de-la-vilavella-al-puerto&amp;catid=1:actualidad&amp;Itemid=180 here]&lt;/ref&gt; The work was carried out until the early 1930s and transformed what used to be chiefly a simple fishing bay&lt;ref&gt;compare ''Naranjas: cuando no existía el puerto en Burriana'' [in:] ''wikisenior'' service, available [http://mayores.uji.es/wiki/index.php?title=Naranjas:_cuando_no_exist%C3%ADa_el_puerto_en_Burriana here]&lt;/ref&gt; into a small but modern commercial transport hub.&lt;ref&gt;''Nota biográfica sobre Jaime Chicharro y Sánchez-Guio (1889-1934)'', Rios 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Key beneficiaries of the project were the local Levantine landowners, who gained a gateway for the export of their orange production;&lt;ref&gt;Chicharro was himself member of the local Circulo Frutero and Agrupación de Exportadores, María Dolores Agustí, ''Juan Bautista Soler y Martí, representante del comercio naranjero en Burriana (1879-1936)'', [in:] Rosa Monlleó Peris [ed.], ''Castello Al Segle XX'', Castellon 2006, {{ISBN|9788480215640}}, p. 248. The traditional Valencian agricultural specialty was silk, but silk blight and growing competition pushed Valencian silk out of many markets in mid-19th century. Following unsuccessful reformatting to vineyards, it was the oranges, until late 18th century considered decorative plants, which became iconic Valencian products. As living standards rose and transport network improved, Valencian oranges became a commercial success with exports especially to Britain, France and Germany, see Julia Hudson-Richards, ''The Orange Proletariat: Social Relations in the Pais Valenciano, 1860--1939'' [PhD thesis University of Arizona], Phoenix 2008, {{ISBN|054968333X}}, 9780549683339, pp. 22-25&lt;/ref&gt; Chicharro kept lobbying for their cause in Madrid also during the decades to come.&lt;ref&gt;he was reported as active in 1928, see ''El Imparcial'' 21.07.28, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001026056&amp;page=16 here] and in 1931, see ''Heraldo de Madrid'' 22.01.31, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000963575&amp;page=14 here]&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of his merits, the city of Burriana named Chicharro its hijo adoptivo;&lt;ref&gt;Rios 2008&lt;/ref&gt; upon his return from Madrid he was greeted with arches of triumph and venerating celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;''Biografia sucinta de D. Jaime Chicharro'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:IOTT.18.77.JPG|thumbnail|oranges from [[Burriana]]]]
Though initially one of the most outspoken de Mella supporters, Chicharro did not integrate fully in the [[Mellismo|Mellista]] group; some speak even of “chicharrismo”,&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Martín 2000, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; others dubbed him “mauro-ciervista”.&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Martín 2000, pp. 200-1&lt;/ref&gt; While de Mella was firm on his Traditionalist principles and opted for a grand conservative party built upon them, Chicharro started to lean towards the vision of [[Víctor Pradera Larumbe|Victor Pradera]], embracing a more loose Right-wing alliance held together by a lowest common denominator.&lt;ref&gt;which was also reflected by the fact that in the Cortes he sided with the ciervistas, not the mauristas, Andrés Martín 2000, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1920s he effectively left the Mellistas; some scholars consider him paradigmatic for many rebellious Carlists who joined de Mella in 1919, but soon abandoned him to pursue their own goals and to amalgamate in other Right-wing groupings.&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Martín 2000, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Spanish general election, 1923|electoral campaign of 1923]] Chicharro was considered a favourite.&lt;ref&gt;''La Acción'' 26.03.23, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0003611636&amp;page=5 here]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear to what extent he ruined his chances himself: during one of electoral meetings in the very city of Burriana he was challenged by a local workers’ leader. Chicharro resolved to a stick and engaged in a brawl, resulting in his victim treated in hospital for head wounds and an administrative action taken against the assailant.&lt;ref&gt;''La Epoca'' 07.02.23, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000971195&amp;page=3 here], ''Heraldo de Madrid'' 07.02.23, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000801691&amp;page=1 here], ''El Sol'' 07.02.23, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000267737&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Diario de Castellón'', the newspaper he founded and owned, failed to mobilize enough support and produced merely significant financial losses.&lt;ref&gt;''Biografia sucinta de D. Jaime Chicharro'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually Chicharro and an albista counter-candidate recorded almost the same score; the latter was declared victorious following behind-the-scene dealings.&lt;ref&gt;''Biografia sucinta de D. Jaime Chicharro'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924 Chicharro was active setting up the local Castellon branch of [[Spanish Patriotic Union|Union Patriotica]]&lt;ref&gt;Raul González Devís, ''Católico y autoritarios: la dictadura de Primo de Rivera en las comarcas castellonenses'', [in:] Carlos Navajas Zubeldía, Diego Iturriaga Barco (eds.), ''Novísima: II Congreso Internacional de Historia de Nuestro Tiempo'', Logroño 2010, {{ISBN|9788469365571}}, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; and soon became its provincial jefe.&lt;ref&gt;González Devís 2010, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; In the new partido unico he championed the Catholic-based branch and got increasingly alienated by what he perceived as marginalization of the Catholic groupings; other local upetistas accused him of building the local structures chiefly around his former Traditionalist supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Chicharro was attacked by “elementos de derecha”, which proves that it was possible to be more Right-wing than himself, González Devís 2010, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict climaxed in 1925, when Chicharro in protest resigned from the provincial presidency.&lt;ref&gt;González Devís 2010, p. 241 (see also the footnote)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925 the Chicharros left [[Levante, Spain|Levante]] and moved to Madrid; it is not clear whether the change was anyhow related to political tension or was rather due to financial issues, as reported by some sources;&lt;ref&gt;''Biografia sucinta de D. Jaime Chicharro'', p. 2; nothing is known about the fate of Chicharro’s landholdings, though he must have felt financial pressure by rapid growth of his family, children born almost every year&lt;/ref&gt; In the capital he started to practice as a lawyer&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 12.07.28, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1928/07/12/024.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; and apparently became fairly successful, as in the early 1930s he grew to member of Junta de Gobierno of the Madrid Congregacion de los Abogados.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 12.02.33, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1933/02/12/028.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Madrid. La Cibeles square.jpg|thumbnail|160px|ayuntamiento of Madrid]]
In 1927 Chicharro commenced his career as municipal official, appointed one of 64 new councilors of the Madrid [[ayuntamiento]].&lt;ref&gt;''La Voz'' 16.12.27, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000846146&amp;page=12 here], ''ABC'' 20.12.27, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1927/12/20/021.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 he grew to teniente de alcalde&lt;ref&gt;''La Construccion Moderna'' 15.07.28, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002014454&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; responsible for the [[Chamberi|Chamberí]] district; appointed member of Junta municipal de Primera enseñanza he specialized in education issues,&lt;ref&gt;''La Voz'' 23.12.27, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000846334&amp;page=4 here]&lt;/ref&gt; dealing also with culture&lt;ref&gt;organising Juegos Florales, ''El Siglo Futuro'' 08.03.27, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000430418&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and science.&lt;ref&gt;he supported pre-historical studies, Anuario de prehistoria madrileña 1930, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0004949421&amp;page=291 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Chicharro resumed contacts with Vázquez de Mella;&lt;ref&gt;de Mella greeted Chicharro with his own photo signed “A mi entrañable amigo el heroico Chicharro”, ''La Correspondencia militar'' 29.11.29, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002250152&amp;page=4 here], see also ''ABC'' 20.12.27, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1927/12/20/021.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; only weeks after his death, in March 1928, he arranged for a commemorative plaque to be mounted on the Escuela Normal de Maestros wall&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 25.03.27, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1928/03/25/027.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; and looked after his library.&lt;ref&gt;''El Sol'' 22.11.29, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000410303&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930 the press already referred to him as former [[:es:Teniente de alcalde|teniente de alcalde]], but it is not clear when he ceased.&lt;ref&gt;''La Voz'' 26.03.30, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000886537&amp;page=2 here]
&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last years of the monarchy Chicharro seemed politically disoriented. Though in the press plebiscite he was voted one of three best possible representatives of Castellon province in [[:es:Asamblea Nacional Consultiva|Asamblea Nacional]],&lt;ref&gt;''La Correspondencia de España'' 17.09.27, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002220512&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; he was not appointed its member. He remained active in Catholic groupings like Acción social, giving lectures and contributing as organizer and manager. As friend of Lamamié he maintained links with his Acción Castellana, set up in 1930, and was drawn closer to another of his organizations, [[Federación Católico-Agraria Salmantina]].&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 26.01.27, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1927/01/26/023.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in the circle of [[Francesc Cambó]], leader of the [[Catalans|Catalan]] conservative [[Regionalist League|Lliga Regionalista]].&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 17.02.31, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1931/02/17/031.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Last but not least, he retained his Carlist contacts with the former mellistas,&lt;ref&gt;''Nota biográfica sobre Jaime Chicharro y Sánchez-Guio (1889-1934)'', Rios 2008&lt;/ref&gt; now headed by the new leader, Victor Pradera.

[[File:Fitxer Proclamació de la República Plaça Sant Jaume. Fotògraf Josep Maria Sagarra, 1931.jpg|thumbnail|left|Republic declared]]
During the local elections of April 1931 Chicharro was overwhelmed by the republican tide and as an independent conservative candidate&lt;ref&gt;''La Voz'' 06.04.31, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000922880&amp;page=4 here]&lt;/ref&gt; he failed to get voted into the Madrid ayuntamiento.&lt;ref&gt;''Heraldo de Madrid'' 13.04.31, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000970313&amp;page=7 here]&lt;/ref&gt; After proclamation of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic]] he decided to take part in the [[Spanish general election, 1931|June 1931 elections]] to the Cortes from Castellón, still supported by ''Diario de Castellón'', officially the voice of [[Federación Castellonense de Sindicatos Agrícolas]].&lt;ref&gt;the newspaper retained an ultraconservative line, usually classified as a rightist or forming part of catolicismo agrario, see catolicos y autoritarios González Devís 2010, p. 241, ''Cronicas de Castellon'' service, available [http://80.59.153.180:85/cronicas/sxx.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; Chicharro was invited to join the [[Republicanism in Spain|Republicans]]; according to one source he boldly refused,&lt;ref&gt;quoted saying “si veinte años hubiera República en España, veinte años y un dia sería monárquico por tradición e ideales”, referred after ''Biografia sucinta de D. Jaime Chicharro'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; but according to the press he was running as "derecha republicana".&lt;ref&gt;''La Voz'' 29.06.31, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000931439&amp;page=7 here],&lt;/ref&gt; The result was rather poor – some call it humiliating&lt;ref&gt;Martin Blinkhorn, ''Carlism and Crisis in Spain 1931-1939'', Cambridge 1975, {{ISBN|9780521207294}}, pp. 123, 333&lt;/ref&gt; - since he arrived 11th with some 11 thousand votes out of 96,000 cast in the province.&lt;ref&gt;''La Voz'' 29.06.31, ''ABC'' 04.07.31, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1931/07/04/035.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1931 Chicharro started to attend Traditionalist meetings,&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 28.11.31, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000491659&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; gradually re-joining followers of the Carlist king and entering their new organization, [[:es:Comunión Tradicionalista|Comunión Tradicionalista]]. Though not counting among national leaders, in the press he emerged as one of the most-quoted Carlist speakers of the first half of 1932, extremely active touring the country and delivering public addresses. In January 1932 he already gave lecture about collaboration and Carlism;&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 15.01.32, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000493591&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; in February he presented a broad foreign policy program including control of [[Gibraltar]],&lt;ref&gt;''La Voz de las Patatas'' 24.04.16 available [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TCN56ZUSD0 here]&lt;/ref&gt; federation with [[Portugal]] and confederation with Latin American states,&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 16.02.32, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000494909&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; in March he labeled the proposed universal suffrage as unjust and lambasted the Republican government for overspending and highly inflated budget.&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 30.03.32, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000496640&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; The same month he triggered riots in [[Soria]] by proclaiming that he had no intention of surrendering an iota of his wealth without a fight.&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 1975, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; In April he got his car stolen from the Madrid street.&lt;ref&gt;''La Correspondencia'' 10.04.32, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002279642&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of meetings with him taking part were suspended when already ongoing for fear of unrest.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 14.01.34, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1934/01/14/046.html here], ''El Sol'' 28.06.32, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000476948&amp;page=4 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Late 1932 he started to write first-page newspaper pieces himself.&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 30.10.32, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000503063&amp;page=1 here], ''El Siglo Futuro'' 09.11.32, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000503834&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:JoséSanjurjo.jpg|thumbnail|160px|José Sanjurjo]]
In 1932 Chicharro got engaged in conspiracy of [[José Sanjurjo]], though no details are known.&lt;ref&gt;''Nota biográfica sobre Jaime Chicharro y Sánchez-Guio (1889-1934)''&lt;/ref&gt; Following the disastrously failed coup he was identified as one of the culprits&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 17.06.32, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000499762&amp;page=6 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and became subject of the expropriation, designed to boost the floundering Agrarian Reform.&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 1975, p. 92; it might not be unrelated that some sources claim he died „almost in poverty”, ''Emotivo homenaje a D. Jaime Chicharro en su pueblo natal, Torralba de Calatrava''&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year two of his sons were detained and administrated exile in the [[Spanish Sahara]] outpost of [[Villa Cisneros]], which would soon turn into the Carlist hotbed.&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 1975, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing with his tours across the country&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. ''El Siglo Futuro'' 10.04.33, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000509644&amp;page=1 here], ''El Siglo Futuro'' 17.04.33, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000509898&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; later in 1933 he defended some of the Sanjuriada conspirators in court,&lt;ref&gt;''Heraldo de Madrid'' 04.05.33, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001026694&amp;page=15 here]&lt;/ref&gt; though he was himself closely watched by the security&lt;ref&gt;''Heraldo de Madrid'' 01.03.33, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001022249&amp;page=9 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and in May he faced trial for inflammatory speak.&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 25.05.33, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000511277&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 Chicharro was active mixing with the [[Alfonsism|Alfonsist]] monarchists in the Tradicionalistas y Renovación Española alliance; by the local Castellon Liaison Committee he was agreed to [[Electoral Carlism (Second Republic)|represent it in the forthcoming elections]].&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 28.10.33, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1933/10/28/019.html here], ''El Siglo Futuro'' 13.11.33, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000517860&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; This gained him hostility among new radical Carlist activists like [[Jaime del Burgo Torres|Jaime del Burgo]], who despised fraternization with caciques and debris of the Alfonsine monarchy. Moreover, for the Carlist youth the landowners like Lamamié and Chicharro became marked men as privileged section of politically dominant potentates, who are "obstructing the Agrarian Reform by the feudal egoism of the odious grandees of grain".&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 1975, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Though indeed within Carlism Chicharro formed the most reactionary faction, conservatism did not render him averse to new radical social movements.&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 1975, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Adolf Hitler]] he declared that Traditionalism, “though not one and the same thing, is very sympathetic towards them, as they are waging war against [[Judaism]], [[freemasonry]] and [[Marxism]], building an organized corporative state. What is inacceptable to us is the state's overwhelming sovereignty and dominance. For us the family comes first, followed by municipality, region and state, which is the last element in this chain”.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 14.03.33, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1933/03/14/019.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Riding the wave of soaring rightist sympathies, in 1933 Chicharro was elected to the Madrid ayuntamiento from the Chamberí district.&lt;ref&gt;''Nota biográfica sobre Jaime Chicharro y Sánchez-Guio (1889-1934)''&lt;/ref&gt; However, running on the Carlist ticket [[Spanish general election, 1933|to the Cortes]] from Castellón he narrowly lost,&lt;ref&gt;Ramon Puig, ''El Bienni Reformador a les comarques septentrionals de Castelló (1931-1933)'', [in:] Rosa Monlleó Peris [ed.], ''Castello Al Segle XX'', Castellon 2006, {{ISBN|9788480215640}}, p. 378, ''El Sol'' 05.12.33, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000515030&amp;page=6 here]&lt;/ref&gt; though initially he was reported by the press as victorious&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 22.11.33, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000518244&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and his fellow Traditionalist [[Juan Granell Pascual]] was indeed elected.&lt;ref&gt;''Nota biográfica sobre Jaime Chicharro y Sánchez-Guio (1889-1934)''&lt;/ref&gt; At that time he was already seriously ill.&lt;ref&gt;Agustí 2006, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; Having been generally of rather poor health, as a [[chain-smoker]] Chicharro developed grave respiratory problems.&lt;ref&gt;''La familia Chicharro dona a Buuriana'' [sic!]'' una librería que perteneció al artífice de la construcción del Puerto'', [in:] ''Diario digital de Castellon'' 01.11.13, available [http://www.castelloninformacion.com/familia-chicharro-libreria-burriana/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; Though as late as 1932 he was still hailed by the press as “ilustrado joven”,&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 16.02.32, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000494909&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; in August 1933 he was placed in the [[tuberculosis]]-treatment Real Sanatorio de Guadarrama,&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 22.08.33, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000514534&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; where he died early 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Rios 2008&lt;/ref&gt; His funeral and related commemorative homage feasts staged across Spain helped to mobilize support and demonstrated growing dynamics of Carlism.&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 13.01.34, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000520424&amp;page=1 here], ''El Siglo Futuro'' 23.01.34, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000520757&amp;page=2 here], ''El Siglo Futuro'' 05.03.34, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000522414&amp;page=3 here]; the widow received a letter from the Carlist king Alfonso Carlos, ''El Siglo Futuro'' 25.01.34, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000520844&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; As the widow and 13 half-orphaned children were in financial dire straits, Comunión Tradicionalista launched a public fund-raising campaign intended to assist them.&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 01.03.34, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000522272&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4455">A '''jobsworth'''  is a person who uses their job description in a deliberately uncooperative way, or who seemingly delights in acting in an obstructive or unhelpful manner. The term can also be applied to those who uphold petty rules even at the expense of humanity or [[common sense]]. 

"Jobsworth" is a [[British English|British]] [[colloquial]]&lt;ref name="OED" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/jobsworth  | title=jobsworth – definition | work=Macmillan Dictionary | publisher = [[Macmillan Publishers]] | accessdate=30 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; word derived from the phrase "I can't do that, it's more than my job's worth", meaning taking the initiative and performing an action that is beyond what the person feels is in their job description. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines it as "A person in authority (esp. a minor official) who insists on adhering to rules and regulations or bureaucratic procedures even at the expense of common sense."&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;2nd Edition, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathon Green]] similarly defines "jobsworth" as "a minor [[wikt:factotum|factotum]] whose only status comes from enforcing otherwise petty regulations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Macmillan Dictionary of Contemporary Slang | year=1995 | isbn=0-333-63407-1 | last=Green | first=Jonathon | publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] | coauthor= | authorlink=Jonathon Green}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the phrase which gave rise to the term occurs in the 1965 [[Beatles]] movie ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', when [[Roy Kinnear]]'s character, the assistant scientist  Algernon, exclaims "Well it's more than my job's worth to stop him when he's like this, he's out to rule the world...if he can get a government grant."

Another early use was by UK [[Folk music|folk]]-singer [[Jeremy Taylor (singer)|Jeremy Taylor]], in a song he wrote in the late 1960s:
{{poemquote
|text=Jobsworth, Jobsworth, It's more than me job's worth,
I don't care, rain or snow,
whatever you want the answer's no,
I can keep you waiting for hours in the queue,
and if you don't like it you know what you can do.}}

The term became widespread in [[vernacular]] English through its use in the popular 1970s [[BBC]] [[television]] programme ''[[That's Life!]]'' which featured [[Esther Rantzen]] covering various [[human interest]] and [[Consumerism|consumer]] topics. A "Jobsworth of the Week" commissionaire's hat was awarded each week to "a startling tale of going by the book".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/597889.stm BBC News: "Your job's worth more than you are"].&lt;/ref&gt;

The term remains in use, particularly in the UK, to characterise inflexible employees, petty rule-following and excessive administration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199596/cmhansrd/vo960501/debtext/60501-10.htm House of Commons Hansard Debates for 1 May 1996 (pt 10)] "There seems to be here an element of what might qualify for Esther Rantzen's "jobsworth" award. I would certainly like to look at it more closely. I will therefore follow up the matters that my hon. Friend has raised today, and I hope to be able to write to him in due course."&lt;/ref&gt;

The slang expression "Little [[Hitler]]" is also used in Britain with a similar meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/citybreaks/cities-of-culture/11394950/A-bossy-little-Hitler-is-still-making-waves-80-years-on.html "A bossy 'little Hitler’ is still making waves 80 years on"], The Telegraph&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Bus-driver-conducted-like-little-Hitler-claims/story-19493612-detail/story.html "Bus driver conducted himself like a little Hitler, claims angry pensioner"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714161314/http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Bus-driver-conducted-like-little-Hitler-claims/story-19493612-detail/story.html |date=2015-07-14 }}, Bristol Post&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

'''José Hauer Junior''' (August 17, 1882 – June 22, 1941) was a [[Brazilians|Brazilian]] [[businessman]], pioneer of [[electric energy]] of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://periodicos.ufsc.br/index.php/esbocos/article/viewFile/2175-7976.2013v20n29p49/26380 The electric power in Paraná state (Brazil) and the first feasibility studies energy in the Iguaçu river (1891-1913)] Magazines-Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina {{pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amigbrasil.org.br/var/site/storage/original/application/dff8294e1753b1c05d8f3434a502ce5f.pdf Curitiba, 1927 - German newspaper Der Kompass] Asociación pro-memoria German Immigration in Brazil&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.camara.leg.br/legin/fed/decret/1920-1929/decreto-4715-3-agosto-1923-567770-publicacaooriginal-91120-pl.html Decreto nº 4.715, de 3 de Agosto de 1923] Chamber of Deputies of Brazil-Brazil's Congress {{pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

José Hauer Junior was born in [[Curitiba]] in August 17, 1882, and his parents were [[Germany|German]] immigrants, José Hauer Senior and Therese Weiser. He married Guilhermina Leitner, who bore him two children. He started his commercial activities with his father, on his company ''José Hauer &amp; Filhos''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memoria.bn.br/DocReader/Hotpage/HotpageBN.aspx?bib=313394&amp;pagfis=25609&amp;pesq=&amp;url=http://memoria.bn.br/docreader# Newspaper O Estado do Parana of 1904] National Library of Brazil {{pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the business kept by his family was the ''Curitiba Electricity Company'', responsible for supplying [[Electric power|power]] to the city, a service that used to be held at that time by a corporation of the State of [[São Paulo]].

=== Public Office ===
In 2001, Dräger was appointed senator of science and research in Hamburg's state government led by [[Ole von Beust]], a position he held as a political independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=An die Arbeit, Herr Senator!|date={{date|2001-11-20|mdy}}|language=de|author=Christoph Rind|newspaper=Hamburger Abendblatt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zeit.de/2004/44/C-Dr_9ager/komplettansicht|title=Der Quereinsteiger|date={{date|2004-10-21|mdy}}|access-date={{date|2017-06-30|mdy}}|language=de|author=Arnfrid Schenk|website=Die Zeit}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called for the introduction of tuition fees and more competition among higher education institutions in order to secure the institutions' long-term funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gebühren und mehr Wettbewerb|date={{date|2001-11-13|mdy}}|language=de|author=Christoph Rind|newspaper=Hamburger Abendblatt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Drägers Uni-Modell|date={{date|2001-10-24|mdy}}|language=de|author=Kaija Kutter|newspaper=Die Tageszeitung}}&lt;/ref&gt; These recommendations were greeted with criticism, especially by student representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Unerwünschter Auftritt|date={{date|2001-11-15|mdy}}|edition=Hamburg|language=de|author=Kaija Kutter|newspaper=Die Tageszeitung}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After early elections in 2004, Dräger was appointed senator of science and health in the second von Beust government.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Das sind Oles neue Senatoren|date={{date|2004-03-16|mdy}}|language=de|newspaper=Hamburger Morgenpost}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing to advocate for reform, he succeeded in introducing [[Tuition payments|tuition fees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=An der Problemlage hat sich nichts geändert|date={{date|2004-03-25|mdy}}|language=de|author=Ira von Mellenthin|newspaper=Die Welt}}&lt;/ref&gt; His goal was a fundamental reform of Hamburg's university system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zeit.de/2003/07/B-Uni_Kasten/komplettansicht|title=Blaupause für deutsche Universitäten|date={{date|2003-02-06|mdy}}|access-date={{date|2017-06-30|mdy}}|language=de|author=Martin Spiewak|website=Die Zeit}}&lt;/ref&gt; He promoted the establishment of new institutions and the consolidation of existing ones as a way of modernizing Hamburg's higher education structures and making them more flexible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In retrospect these measures have proven controversial:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Umkrempeln um jeden Preis|date={{date|2006-01-16|mdy}}|language=de|newspaper=Parlament}}&lt;/ref&gt; While supporters praised his expertise and determination, critics opposed cutbacks made in the humanities, among other changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zeit.de/2005/13/P-Dr_8ager/komplettansicht|title=Tortenschlacht um den Überzeugungstäter|date={{date|2005-03-23|mdy}}|access-date={{date|2017-06-30|mdy}}|language=de|author=Martin Spiewak|website=Die Zeit}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Dräger placed last in the ranking of ministers published by the German Association of University Professors and Lecturers; one year later he again placed sixth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/lebenundlernen/uni/minister-ranking-die-professoren-keilen-aus-a-536868.html|title=Die Professoren keilen aus|date={{date|2008-02-21|mdy}}|website=[[Spiegel Online]]|language=de|access-date={{date|2017-06-30|mdy}}|author=Jochen Leffers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/lebenundlernen/uni/minister-ranking-ein-bisschen-spass-muss-sein-a-604116.html|title=Ein bisschen Spaß muss sein|date={{date|2009-01-28|mdy}}|website=Spiegel Online|language=de|access-date={{date|2017-06-30|mdy}}|author=Jochen Leffers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, he turned over his responsibilities in the area of health to Senator [[Birgit Schnieber-Jastram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Neue Senatorin für Gesundheit in Hamburg|date={{date|2006-03-24|mdy}}|language=de|newspaper=Ärzte Zeitung}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following elections in 2008 he announced that he would not serve another term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/lebenundlernen/uni/hamburgs-wissenschaftssenator-joerg-draeger-verlaesst-die-politik-a-539257.html|title=Jörg Dräger verlässt die Politik|date={{date|2008-03-04|mdy}}|website=Spiegel Online|language=de|access-date={{date|2017-06-30|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; His announcement was met with regret by a number of public figures, including former Hamburg Mayor [[Klaus von Dohnányi|Klaus von Dohnanyi]], who wrote in a commentary in the [[Hamburger Abendblatt]] newspaper that the city had lost presumably its "most effective science senator since 1945."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wegweisende Entscheidungen|date={{date|2008-03-05|mdy}}|language=de|newspaper=Hamburger Abendblatt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other members of the media, conversely, were relieved that the "bulldozer in the three-piece suit" ([[Die Tageszeitung|taz]]) was leaving politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bulldozer im Dreiteiler: Jörg Dräger, Wissenschaftsenator auf Abruf|date={{date|2008-03-05|mdy}}|language=de|newspaper=Die Tageszeitung}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lion of St. Mark''' is an award given each year at the [[Cannes Lions]] International Festival of Creativity for a lifetime of services to creativity in communications.

It was instituted in 2011. The trophy is modelled on the [[Lion of St. Mark|lion statue]] in [[St Mark’s Square]], [[Venice]], where the first [[Cannes Lions]] festival was held in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/history-advertising-20-cannes-lion/1076691|title=The History of Advertising 20 - A Cannes Lion|website=Campaignlive.co.uk|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In business, '''master data management''' ('''MDM''') is a method used to define and manage the critical data of an [[organization]] to provide, with [[data integration]], a single point of reference.&lt;ref name="SearchDataManagement 2018"&gt;{{cite web |first=Margaret |last=Rouse | title=Definition from WhatIs.com | website=SearchDataManagement | date=2018-04-09 | url=https://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/definition/master-data-management | access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data that is mastered may include [[reference data]]- the set of permissible values, and the analytical data that supports [[decision making]].&lt;ref name="BeyeNETWORK"&gt;{{cite web | title=Defining Master Data |first=David |last=Loshin | website=BeyeNETWORK | url=http://www.b-eye-network.com/view/2918 |date=May 2006| access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computing]], a master data management tool can be used to support master data management by [[data deduplication|removing duplicates]], standardizing data (mass maintaining),&lt;ref name="Simple Talk 2016"&gt;{{cite web |first=Knut |last=Jürgensen| title=Master Data Management (MDM): Help or Hindrance? | website=Simple Talk | date=2016-05-16 | url=https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/sql/database-delivery/master-data-management-mdm-help-or-hindrance/ | access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporating rules to eliminate incorrect data from entering the system in order to create an authoritative source of master data. Master data are the products, accounts and parties for which the [[Financial transaction|business transaction]]s are completed. The root cause problem stems from [[business unit]] and [[product line]] segmentation, in which the same customer will be serviced by different product lines, with redundant data being entered about the customer (a.k.a. party in the role of customer) and account in order to process the transaction. The redundancy of party and account data is compounded in the front to back office life cycle, where the authoritative single source for the party, account and product data is needed but is often once again redundantly entered or augmented.

Master data management has the objective of providing processes for [[data collection|collecting]], [[data aggregation|aggregating]], matching, consolidating, [[data quality|quality]]-assuring, [[Persistence (computer science)|persisting]] and [[data distribution|distributing]] such data throughout an organization to ensure a common understanding, [[data consistency|consistency]], accuracy and control&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lightsondata.com/mdm-change-request-template/|title=Learn how to create a MDM change request - LightsOnData|date=2018-05-09|work=LightsOnData|access-date=2018-08-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the ongoing maintenance and application use of this information.

The term recalls the concept of a ''master file'' from an earlier computing era.

==Goal==
MDM is a comprehensive method of enabling an enterprise to link all of its critical data to one file, called a master file, that provides a common point of reference. When properly done, master data management streamlines [[data sharing]] among personnel and departments. In addition, master data management can facilitate computing in multiple system architectures, platforms and applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Master data management|url=http://www.ibm.com/software/data/master-data-management/overview.html|publisher=[[IBM]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its core MDM can be viewed as a "discipline for specialized quality improvement"&lt;ref&gt;DAMA-DMBOK Guide,2010 DAMA International&lt;/ref&gt; defined by the policies and procedures put in place by a [[data governance]] organization.  The ultimate goal being to provide the end user community with a "trusted single version of the truth" from which to base decisions.

==Issues==
At a basic level, master data management seeks to ensure that an organization does not use multiple (potentially [[Consistency (database systems)|inconsistent]]) versions of the same master data in different parts of its operations, which can occur in large organizations. A typical example of poor master data management is the scenario of a bank at which a [[customer]] has taken out a [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] and the bank begins to send mortgage solicitations to that customer, ignoring the fact that the person already has a mortgage account relationship with the bank. This happens because the customer information used by the marketing section within the bank lacks integration with the customer information used by the customer services section of the bank.  Thus the two groups remain unaware that an existing customer is also considered a sales lead. The process of [[record linkage]] is used to associate different records that correspond to the same entity, in this case the same person.

Other problems include (for example) issues with the [[data quality|quality of data]], consistent [[classification]] and identification of data, and [[Data validation and reconciliation|data-reconciliation]] issues.  Master data management of disparate data systems requires [[data transformation]]s as the data extracted from the disparate source data system is transformed and loaded into the master data management hub.  To synchronize the disparate source master data, the managed master data extracted from the master data management hub is again transformed and loaded into the disparate source data system as the master data is updated.  As with other [[Extract, Transform, Load]]-based data movement, these processes are expensive and inefficient to develop and to maintain which greatly reduces the [[return on investment]] for the master data management product.

One of the most common reasons some large corporations experience massive issues with master data management is growth through [[merger]]s or [[Takeover|acquisitions]].  Any organizations which merge will typically create an entity with duplicate master data (since each likely had at least one master database of its own prior to the merger).  Ideally, [[database administrator]]s resolve this problem through [[Data deduplication|deduplication]] of the master data as part of the merger. In practice, however, reconciling several master data systems can present difficulties because of the dependencies that existing applications have on the master databases.  As a result, more often than not the two systems do not fully merge, but remain separate, with a special reconciliation process defined that ensures consistency between the data stored in the two systems.  Over time, however, as further mergers and acquisitions occur, the problem multiplies, more and more master databases appear, and data-reconciliation processes become extremely complex, and consequently unmanageable and unreliable. Because of this trend, one can find organizations with 10, 15, or even as many as 100 separate, poorly integrated master databases, which can cause serious operational problems in the areas of [[customer satisfaction]], operational efficiency, [[decision support]], and regulatory compliance.

Another problem concerns determining the proper degree of detail and normalization to include in the master data schema. For example, in a federated HR environment, the enterprise may focus on storing people data as a current status, adding a few fields to identify date of hire, date of last promotion, etc. However this simplification can introduce business impacting errors into dependent systems for planning and forecasting. The stakeholders of such systems may be forced to build a parallel network of new interfaces to track onboarding of new hires, planned retirements, and divestment, which works against one of the aims of master data management.  

==Products==
Processes commonly seen in master data management include source identification, data collection, [[data transformation]], [[database normalization|normalization]], rule administration, [[error detection and correction]], data consolidation, [[data storage device|data storage]], data distribution, data classification, taxonomy services, item master creation, [[schema mapping]], product codification, data enrichment and [[data governance]].

The selection of entities considered for master data management depends somewhat on the nature of an organization. In the common case of commercial enterprises, master data management may apply to such entities as customer ([[customer data integration]]), product ([[product information management]]), employee, and vendor. Master data management processes identify the sources from which to collect descriptions of these entities. In the course of transformation and normalization, administrators adapt descriptions to conform to standard formats and data domains, making it possible to remove duplicate instances of any entity. Such processes generally result in an organizational master data management repository, from which  all requests for a certain entity instance produce the same description, irrespective of the originating sources and the requesting destination.

The tools include [[data networks]], [[file systems]], a [[data warehouse]], [[data mart]]s, an [[operational data store]], [[data mining]], [[data analysis]], [[data visualization]], [[Federated database system|data federation]] and [[data virtualization]]. One of the newest tools, virtual master data management utilizes data virtualization and a persistent metadata server to implement a multi-level automated master data management hierarchy. ..

==Transmission of master data==
There are several ways in which master data may be collated and distributed to other systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dama-ny.com/images/meeting/101509/damanyc_mdmprint.pdf "Creating the Golden Record: Better Data Through Chemistry"], DAMA, slide 26, Donald J. Soulsby, 22 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This includes:

* Data consolidation – The process of capturing master data from multiple sources and integrating into a single hub ([[operational data store]]) for replication to other destination systems.
* [[Federated database system|Data federation]] – The process of providing a single virtual view of master data from one or more sources to one or more destination systems.
* Data propagation – The process of copying master data from one system to another, typically through point-to-point interfaces in legacy systems.

'''Merdiban''' was an accounting method used by the [[Ottoman empire]], [[Abbasid empire]], and [[Ilkhanate]]; especially for recording [[Taxation|tax]] payments and liabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Napier, Haniffa|title=Islamic Accounting|year=2012|isbn=9781848442207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "Merdiban" is derived from "merdiven", a word of Persian origin, meaning "''staircase''" or "''ladder''". The Ottomans themselves generally called this method "muhasebe usulü" (method of accounting).

==History==
Abbasid accounting techniques were inherited by the [[Ilkhanate]] and then the [[Ottoman Empire]]; spanning several centuries until modern double-entry accounting was adopted post-[[Tanzimat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Darling|title=Ottoman Accounting Prehistory|journal=Proceedings of the 12th World Congress of Accounting Historians|date=July 2008|volume=3|pages=2421–2433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merdiban originated in the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]; the first likely example has been found in an eighth-century government document.&lt;ref name=Napier&gt;{{cite journal|last=Napier|first=Christopher|title=Defining Islamic accounting: current issues, past roots|journal=Accounting History|volume=14|pages=121–144|doi=10.1177/1032373208098555|url=http://ach.sagepub.com/content/14/1-2/121.full.pdf+html|accessdate=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the conquest of [[Baghdad]] by Mongol forces in 1258, many Persian and Arab officials were employed by the Ikhanate. As the Mongols lacked strong state institutions, local systems were adopted, including accounting techniques. For instance, the Abbasids had a kind of daily ledger called a Defter-ul Yevmiye; the Ilkhanate adopted the same kind of daily ledger but called it Ruznamce. (The later Ottoman ruznamçe was similar).&lt;ref name="Güvemli"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Güvemli|first=Batuhan|title=: Development of the Merdiban Method in the Ilkhanate State (1251 – 1353 a.d.) and its transition to the Ottoman State  accountancy|journal=Revista Española de Historia de la Contabilidad|date=June 2011|issue=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ghazan]] (1295–1304) made fiscal reforms; these drove more detailed record-keeping and, hence, further development of accounting techniques. Centralised fiscal record-keeping was divided according to provinces, and each team reported to a ''katip'' (which roughly corresponds to "clerk") - the same title used in the Abbasid state. "Katip" continued to be used to describe Ottoman accountants, although their official title was ''halife''.&lt;ref name="Güvemli" /&gt; The Risale-i Felekiyye, written in 1363 by Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Kiya Al-Mazandarani, was a manual of accounting, and is an important source for modern historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Solas|author2=Otar|title=The Accounting System Practiced in the Near East During the Period 1220-1350 Based on the Book Risale-I Felekiyye|date=June 1994|volume=21|issue=1|pages=117–135|jstor=40698133}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The technique set out in the Risale begins to resemble a crude early attempt at [[Double entry accounting|double-entry accounting]], but there is little evidence that this influenced the development of modern double-entry accounting in Italy.&lt;ref name=Napier/&gt;

It is possible that other states used accounting systems based on merdiban, but documentary evidence is sparse.&lt;ref name="Güvemli" /&gt;

==Method==
In the Ottoman empire, accounting was not taught systematically in [[madrasah]]s or other schools; instead, it was taught on a master-apprentice basis in the workplace, especially the [[Hazine-i Amire]] (finance ministry). So, few instruction documents survive from this era.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

Merdiban was named because of the descending sequence in which amounts were recorded; a total at the top, and then individual items below. Typically, the last letter of the first word in an entry would be extended all the way across a line from left to right, acting as a separator between entries.&lt;ref name="Güvemli" /&gt;

Mediban was usually recorded in ''[[siyakat]]'' script;&lt;ref name="Güvemli" /&gt; a specialised and condensed form of text, almost stenographic, which was used where much of the content was numerical. Siyakat was so widely associated with accounting and fiscal documents that it became a synonym.

[[File:Palencsár Miklós.jpg|thumb|left]]
'''Miklós Palencsár''' (born 1977) is a Hungarian economist, international business strategist, and business mentor. He is the creator and developer of the RISE System, a decision-making process analysis system that analyses and interprets personality and behaviour. The RISE system is capable of scanning and typing the 1 million unique personality compositions, which govern a person’s decision-making processes. His first book, which outlined the basis of the system, was published in 2012.


==Life and career==

Palencsár was born in [[Hungary]]. He graduated from [[Szent István University]] in [[Gödöllő]], Hungary. He started his career at [[Citibank]] where he developed a sales expertise. He completed his multinational career as a strategic leader at [[Trader Classified Media]], and at the age of 28 he started his own strategic consulting firm, 3B (Personality and Behaviour Based Business). In the years since, 3B has become a key player in the business development market. Though he lives and works in various European cities for business development projects, Miklós is currently based in [[Budapest]].


==Business Mentoring==

Palencsár is credited with bringing business mentoring to Hungary. A Business mentor is a business development professional who combines a precise, consultancy project approach with a people-centred approach. As such, by developing the customers, a mentor is able to help them achieve their business objectives.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://3bdevelopment.hu/en/business-mentoring/]." Business mentoring.&lt;/ref&gt;


Mentors must not only have a background in business development consultancy but also have the skills required for coaching. In Hungary, the term is not used much in the business world, but it is more and more widespread in Western Europe. Nevertheless, there are more and more forums focusing on this topic, such as interactive discussions and conferences, and nowadays it is not unusual to come across mentors like this at successful companies. Palencsár’s mentoring practice utilises the RISE System.

==3B and the RISE System==

Palencsár used behavioural business theory to create a unique psychological system, the RISE System.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://3bdevelopment.hu/en/rise-system/]." RISE System.&lt;/ref&gt;RISE is the first Europe-based system primed to identify unique personal identities in the business world. RISE’s foundation has been constructed since 2000 with the support of 3B’s international consulting team. Currently, the system is capable of identifying 1 million unique personality compositions and draws from a database of over 1 million client reactions. Its methodology is unique, as the system does not try to verify an abstract psychological theory, but instead advances a theory based on business results. 

Due to the popularity of his business theories, Palencsár is a frequent keynote speaker at prominent business conferences and manager clubs. The Human Hungary conference series was based on 3B’s business theory. Most recently, Palencsár’s theories gave rise to the first Hungarian business developmental magazine, DECISION.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://3bdevelopment.hu/en/decision-magazine/]." ''DECISION'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

Palencsár’s first book, ''3B. Behaviour Based Business'', was published in 2012 and has since garnered over 114,000 readers, making it one of the most successful business books in Hungary. Due to the positive response the book received, Palencsár released an electronic version, allowing for easy dissemination abroad. Currently, there are businessmen and businesswomen from 11 countries on 4 continents who have read the book and use the RISE System in their businesses.

Palencsár’s second book, ''Personality and Behaviour Based Sales: Strategy, Management, Methodology'', was published in 2016 and focuses on personality-based sales. The book has become popular among commercial decision-makers because of its insight into the personality’s effect on the sales process.

The material of the books, which are listed under "Modern Business Communication" and "Modern Business Strategy", has become part of the curricula at renowned Hungarian educational institutions.

Palencsár is associated with Hungary’s first business development magazine, a quarterly publication called DECISION. The magazine provides up-to-date information on 3B’s research, the use of the RISE System, and international strategic and trend analysis including strategy, recruitment, and generational research.

==3B Business Development Software==

In 2014, Palencsár and 3B debuted the 3B Business Development software, which draws from the firm’s wealth of business development experience. Its main goal is to simplify the complex process of business development to make it more presentable to businessmen and businesswomen. The software identifies the strengths and weaknesses of the people working at a given company by identifying personality types, emphasising product development, and laying the foundations for business strategy. The software’s international distribution began at the end of 2014. 3B’s is the first software in the world which is suitable for sustained business development.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5393">'''Online video analytics''' (also known as '''Web video analytics''') is the measurement, [[web analytics|analysis]] and reporting of [[video clip|vide]]

[[video clip|os viewed online]]. It is used for the purposes of understanding the [[consumer behaviour|consumption pattern]]s ([[behavioral analysis]]) and optimizing viewing experience ([[quality of service]] analysis).

Online video analytics differs from traditional [[television]] analytics because it can be measured using [[census]]-based methods instead of [[Survey panels|panel]]-based metrics. Every event that a viewer does while watching a video online can be captured and analyzed precisely.

== Use-cases and metrics of interest ==

=== Behavioral (or usage) analysis ===

The study of consumption patterns helps video publishers gain insights into the end-user preferences. These insights are then used to drive [[monetization]] by [[ad placement]]s, and to tailor future videos to maximize viewer engagement. It aims to answer questions such as:
* Which are the most [[popularity|popular]] videos?
* Where do the viewers come from?
* How long do viewers watch a particular video?
* Do they take any action during or after watching the videos (e.g. [[link sharing|share]], embed, like)?
* Which portion of the video is most popular?
* Which ad placements are most effective - pre-roll, mid-roll or post-roll?

The following metrics are of real interest both for on-demand and live videos:

* ''Unique Viewers'' - per day or month for on-demand, per event or show for live
* ''Plays'' - number of times the video was started (in most analyses, it is beneficial to exclude plays with less than a few seconds of play duration)
* ''Audience Size'' - number of viewers watching the content at any given point in time
* ''Play Duration'' - time spent consuming the videos
* ''Ratios of these metrics'' - e.g. Plays per Viewer, Play Duration per Play, Play Duration per Viewer
    
Along with other obvious dimensions (like ''Country'', ''Browser'', ''Device'' etc.), a particularly interesting dimension is ''Stream Position'' (or Video Portion). Measured as a percentage of video length, for a particular video, Plays by Stream Position indicates which portion of the video is watched how many times. It helps with analysis such as, 40% of the viewers drop off from the video after watching only 25%.

=== Behavioral (or usage) analysis ===
Visual analysis tools integrated into online video platforms are designed to transform multiple viewing experiences into a graphic form, in order to understand the audience &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cincopa.com/blog/use-video-analytics-to-know-your-audience/ Use Video Analytics to know your audience]&lt;/ref&gt; and optimizing video content performance.

A graphical summary that helps to figure out how viewers are engaged with a specific video is called a Video Heatmap. Unlike [[Heat map|heatmaps]] used in [[Web analytics|website analytics]], which highlight different areas of a web page depending on the [[click-through rate]], a video heatmap aggregates stats from every viewing session and calculates an average engagement rate (also known as watch rate &lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.hubspot.com/agency/metrics-video-marketing Metrics for video marketing]&lt;/ref&gt;) throughout the entire video. Depending on the platform, a video hitmap can be represented in a form of a graph or a colored timeline.

User Screen contains personal information related to a specific viewer, such as location (country), IP address, [[operating system]] (OS), [[web browser]] version, first and last view dates, and average engagement. It may also include information obtained from [[Bulk email software|email marketing software]] which is used to distribute video messages: a viewer’s email address, first and last name.

Live Feed shows an overview of everyone watching the videos to the publisher in the real-time mode. The feed allows to expand detailed viewer stats or to jump to an individual user screen.

=== Quality of Experience (or service) analysis ===
The study of online video viewer experience helps [[online video platform]]s identify shortcomings in their network infrastructure and to tweak the quality of their source content to better suit the end-users' connection speeds and devices.

This theme deals with understanding the effect of bad quality on usage. After clicking the play button, do viewers wait for more than 5s before the video starts playing? The interesting metrics for this theme are:

* ''Availability'' - percentage of times the video playback start successfully
* ''Start Up Time'' - time between the play button click and playback start
* ''[[Rebuffering|Rebuffers]]'' - number of times and the duration of interruptions due to re-buffering
* ''[[Bitrate]]'' - average bits per second of video playback. The higher the bitrate, the better the experience
   
''[[Network speed|Network]]'' and ''[[connection speed]]'' are among the most important dimensions. Measuring the abandonment rate (percentage of viewers dropping off) due to bad quality (higher start up time, higher rebuffering or lower bitrate etc.) is of particular interest.
Quality of experience analysis helps companies determine their network infrastructure and [[video encoding|encoding]] requirements.

'''Phyllis Kenner Robinson''' (née '''Kenner''', October 22, 1921 – December 31, 2010) was an advertising executive – a copywriter who helped create numerous notable ad campaigns.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;{{cite news|title=Phyllis K.

==Career==
Born in New York City, in 1942 Robinson earned a bachelor's degree in sociology in from [[Barnard College]];&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; she wanted to be a writer.&lt;ref name=fox/&gt; She worked for the US government as a statistician during World War II.

After the war, she moved to Boston, and embarked on a career in advertising. After starting out at Bresnick &amp; Solomont, she joined [[Grey Advertising]] in 1947 writing fashion promotion, where she first worked for [[William Bernbach]]. When he and [[James Edwin Doyle|Ned Doyle]] left Grey in 1949 to start their eponymous agency with [[Maxwell Dane|Mac Dane]] their "little gold mine of people,"&lt;ref name=lawrence&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawrence|first=Mary Wells|title=A Big Life in Advertising|year=2003|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-4586-9|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C3ckaRboJ3kC&amp;pg=PA4}}&lt;/ref&gt; included Robinson and the art director Bob Gage with whom she was teamed and would enjoy much creative success.

Robinson was [[Doyle Dane Bernbach]]'s first chief copywriter.&lt;ref name=lawrence/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Remembering Phyllis Robinson: The Original Mad Woman|date=January 7, 2011|magazine=[[New York Magazine]]|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/01/phyllis_robinson_was_the_origi.html|accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At DDB, she supervised a team that would produce a number of notable people in advertising, including [[Mary Wells Lawrence]] and [[Paula Green]]. Wells described Robinson's place at DDB when Wells arrived there in 1957 ''"By the time I arrived the gods were firmly ensconced, the pantheon was established, the rituals, the sacred writings were already beloved. The Dei Majores were the originals, Bill, Ned, Mac, Phyllis and Bob Gage; they spoke a secret language. There were talented others, the spirits and the elves, but the gods were the gods, everyone in the industry knew who was who''". Years later Wells put it more simply, ''"I would buy a used car from Phyllis Robinson."''&lt;ref name=fox&gt;{{cite book|last=Fox|first=Stephen R.|title=The mirror makers: a history of American advertising and its creators|year=1997|publisher=U of Illinois P|isbn=978-0-252-06659-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QlVB6ARdT7kC&amp;pg=PA295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson worked on memorable campaigns for numerous clients, including [[Ohrbach's]], [[Henry S. Levy and Sons]] – "You don't have to be Jewish to love Levy's Real Jewish Rye", [[El Al Airlines]], and [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] with a long running campaign featuring actors [[James Garner]] and [[Mariette Hartley]].&lt;ref name=fox/&gt; On the occasion of her death Keith Reinhard, Chairman-Emeritus of [[DDB Worldwide]] wrote "''In presentations to students, I still use her campaigns for Levy's rye bread and Ohrbach's as timeless examples of how to make brands famous by writing in a conversational tone...... [The Ohrbach's ad] is great on its own merits, but the more important reason I singled it out was that, when Volkswagen decided to introduce the Beetle to the U.S. market, they did not conduct an agency search. Instead, they simply said, "We want the agency that does Ohrbach's" – and thus, thanks to Phyllis, the creative revolution was born.''" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ddb.com/ddblogs/creativity/thank-you-phyllis-robinson.html Reinhard: Thank you Phyllis Robinson&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, she also worked in theater, co-writing the lyrics for ''[[Cry for Us All]]''. She also wrote the books, lyrics, and music for a 1995 musical based on [[Bernard Malamud]]'s short story ''Angel Levine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=October 30, 2000|title=Phyllis Robinson|newspaper=[[Adweek]]|url=http://www.adweek.com/aw/esearch/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=522332|accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Performance: Theater|first=Lawrence|last=Van Gelder|date=May 17, 1995|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/17/theater/in-performance-theater-059495.html|accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1944 she married Dr. Richard G. Robinson, who died in 2005. They had a daughter Nancy. Robinson quit full-time work at DDB in 1962 to raise her daughter, but continued to consult to the agency working three days a week through to 1968.&lt;ref name=warlick&gt;{{cite news|title=Phyllis Robinson, First DDB Copy Chief, Dies at 89.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2681">A '''price override''' is a feature of a [[retail management system]] which allows an authorised person to change the automated price of a product or service, in order to apply a discount.&lt;ref name="Gregg2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Gregg|title=CISA Exam Prep: Certified Information Systems Auditor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QD2Gw3VawakC&amp;pg=PT224|date=9 May 2007|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=978-0-13-279700-9|pages=224–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pericle2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tony Pericle|title=Transforming Data Into Action: Using Analytics for Better Distributor Sales Decisions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nwitJBrJ5XcC&amp;pg=PA88|year=2010|publisher=Natl Assn Wholesale-Distr|isbn=978-1-934014-23-3|pages=88–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Price overrides occur for a variety of reasons.  One common reason is to discount damaged goods.  Another is [[employee discount]] and discounts given to other groups.  An override may also be necessary due to the displayed price of an item not matching the price shown at the register.  This can occur when staff have not caught up with changes to the display caused by recent price changes on the retail management system, or it may simply be a mistake.  The customer is then given the old price for goodwill, or for legal reasons.  Other reasons include [[coupon]] redemption and items on sale.&lt;ref name=Horan&gt;Donald J. Horan, ''The Retailer's Guide to Loss Prevention and Security'', [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IcMtQoCeVpAC&amp;pg=PA138 pp. 138-139], CRC Press, 1996 {{ISBN|084938110X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Price overrides can present an opportunity for employee fraud.  Unauthorised large discounts can be given to associates of the employee.  Alternatively, an employee can make the sale at the full price, then, after serving the customer, void the sale and enter it again, but this time with a discount which the employee pockets.  For these reasons the ability to override  prices is often limited to senior employees only, or alternatively, junior employees have a limit placed on the amount they can override, typically 10%.&lt;ref&gt;John Robert Wyman, ''Loss Prevention and the Small Business: The Security Professional's Guide to Asset Protection Strategies'', [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BNaDkkw6qVQC&amp;pg=PA114 pp. 113-114], Butterworth-Heinemann, 1999 {{ISBN|0750671629}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be further refined by the retail management system distinguishing between the various types of transactions and setting appropriate limits and controls for each individually.&lt;ref name=Horan/&gt;

[[Image:Shell Headquarters 1 db.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Shell Mex House]], home of Shell-Mex and BP Ltd]]
'''Shell-Mex and BP Ltd''' was a British [[Joint venture|joint marketing venture]] between petroleum companies [[Royal Dutch Shell]] (Shell) and [[British Petroleum]] (BP).  It was formed in 1932 when both companies decided to merge their United Kingdom marketing operations,&lt;ref&gt;Reference and contact details: GB 1566 SMBP Title:Shell-Mex and BP Archive Dates of Creation: 1900-1975 Held at: BP Archive GB 1566 SMBP&lt;/ref&gt; partly in response to the difficult economic conditions of the times.

The parent organisations de-merged their United Kingdom marketing operations in 1976. The announcement was as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Since 1932 the products of the Companies of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group and of The British Petroleum Group have been marketed in the UK through the agency of Shell-Mex and B.P. Ltd. In that year the company's business amounted to about 3 million tons, out of a total UK market of some 7 million tons.

The activities of this most successful enterprise have extended greatly over the years. In 1970 Shell-Mex and B.P. Ltd. supplied 40 million tons of the UK petroleum market, amounting to a total of 100 million tons.

In the majority of countries outside the UK. Shell and BP have always each marketed their products through their own entirely separate organisations and it has been decided that Shell and BP marketing operations in the UK should now be brought more into line with this pattern over the next 4-5 years.

Since 1966 the Shell and the BP Service Station networks have been managed by separate sales organisations within Shell-Mex and B.P. It is now proposed to extend this 'brand streaming' progressively to cover all products and all market sectors. This will ultimately lead to the establishment of two viable marketing organisations within Shell-Mex and B.P. thus facilitating the termination of the agency agreement.

The National Benzole Company will continue to trade under the National brand and will form part of the BP marketing organisation.

The Supply, Storage and Delivery functions, and the Computer and other services, will be the object of further detailed study once brand streaming of direct trade is substantially complete and a plan for the treatment of Authorised Distributors is agreed. Should it be decided that these functions should continue for a period after the transfer of the sales activities, then these will continue to be carried out by Shell-Mex and B.P.

The employees of Shell-Mex and B.P. will be redeployed within the separate marketing organisations and redundancies will not arise as a result of this re-organisation.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The company's head offices were at [[Shell Mex House]] on London's [[Strand, London|Strand]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2621">[[File:尚順.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Shō Jun]] 
'''{{nihongo|Shō Jun|尚 順|extra=May 2, 1873 - June 17, 1945}}''' was a prince of the [[Ryūkyū Kingdom]], the fourth son of King [[Shō Tai]], the last king of the kingdom. He played a major role in founding many 20th century institutions in [[Okinawa]], including the [[Ryūkyū Shimpō]] newspaper, the [[Bank of Okinawa]], the [[Taishō Gekijō]] theater, and a canning factory, and was a major figure in both the Japanese political and investment worlds of his time.

Following the abolition of the kingdom in 1879, Shō Jun, along with the rest of the Ryukyuan royal family, was made a [[baron]] in the new Japanese ''[[kazoku]]'' system of [[peerage]]. His father, King Shō Tai, was made {{nihongo|marquis|侯爵|kōshaku}}; after his death in 1901, Shō Jun's eldest brother [[Shō Ten]] inherited the title. After the end of the formal mourning period, the Shō family gave up the trappings, rituals, and formal costume of Ryukyuan royalty and adopted the lifestyle and customs of the Japanese aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, George H. ''Okinawa: The History of an Island People'' (revised ed.). Tokyo: Tuttle Publishing, 2003, pp. 452-453.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shō Jun was elected to the [[Japanese House of Peers|House of Peers]] of the [[Diet of Japan|Imperial Diet]] in 1904, and served two terms. After resigning his government post, he took over the administration of the Shō family's finances and other formal affairs.&lt;ref&gt;"Shō Jun."

Accessed 3 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his later years, he managed the Tōbaru Plantation in [[Shuri, Okinawa|Shuri]], and created a tropical botanical garden on Gogayama in [[Nakijin, Okinawa|Nakijin]]. He became known as a man of culture and refinement in many fields of interest and as a [[Japanese calligraphy|calligrapher]] as well.

Shō Jun was killed in the [[Battle of Okinawa]] in 1945.

'''Stick licensing''' is the practice of licensing a [[patent]] or other form of intellectual property where the patent holder threatens to sue the licensee for [[patent infringement]] if the licensee does not take a license.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iplcllc.com/docs/Article-OutsideHelp.pdf Charles R. Neuenschwander, "Licensing Patents in Unfriendly Waters: The Use of Outside Help in Assertive Programs", The Licensing Journal, February 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the stick licensing, the "carrot licensing" is a "friendly approach in luring the target to adopting one's invention and taking a license".&lt;ref&gt; Matthew Y Ma, "Fundamentals of patenting and licensing for scientists and engineers", World Scientific, 2009, {{ISBN|981-283-420-6}}, {{ISBN|978-981-283-420-1}}, p 188. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition of Satyam Computer Services Ltd.===
After the [[Satyam scandal]] of 2008-09 Tech Mahindra bid for [[Satyam Computer Services]], and emerged as a top bidder with an offer of Rs 58.90 a share for a 31 per cent stake in the company, beating a strong rival [[Larsen &amp; Toubro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/tech-mahindra-wins-satyam-bid--full-coverage/90124-7.html|title=Tech Mahindra wins Satyam Computer bid|work=IBNLive}}&lt;/ref&gt; After evaluating the bids, the government-appointed board of Satyam Computer announced on 13 April 2009: "its Board of Directors has selected Venturbay Consultants Private Limited, a subsidiary controlled by Tech Mahindra Limited as the highest bidder to acquire a controlling stake in the Company, subject to the approval of the Hon'ble Company Law Board." Through a subsidiary, it has emerged victorious in [[Mahindra Satyam|Satyam]] sell-off, a company probably two times its size in number of people. This was one of the largest merger deals in India's tech industry.

'''Cosmetic testing on animals''' is a type of [[animal testing]] used to test the safety and [[hypoallergenic]] properties of products for use by humans. Due to the harm done to the animal subjects, this testing is opposed by [[animal rights ]] activists and others. Cosmetic animal testing is banned in the [[European Union]], [[India]], [[Israel]],&lt;ref name="WorldPost"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HSUS"/&gt; and [[Norway]].&lt;ref name="US Bill"/&gt;

==Definition==
Using animal testing in the development of [[cosmetics]] may involve testing either a finished product or the individual ingredients of a finished product on animals, often [[rabbit]]s, as well as [[mice]], [[rat]]s, and other animals. Cosmetics can be defined as products applied to the body in various ways in order to enhance the body's appearance or to cleanse the body. This includes all hair products, makeup, nail products and soaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/GuidanceRegulation/LawsRegulations/ucm074201.htm|title=Laws &amp; Regulations - Is It a Cosmetic, a Drug, or Both? (Or Is It Soap?)|first=Center for Food Safety and Applied|last=Nutrition|date=|website=www.fda.gov|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) continues to endorse animal testing methods.&lt;ref name="aavs.org"/&gt;

Re-using existing test data obtained from previous animal testing is generally not considered to be cosmetic testing on animals; however, the acceptability of this to opponents of testing is inversely proportional to how recent the data is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kunde oder Vertriebspartner werden|url=http://www.vegas-germany.de/|website=VEGAS Cosmetics|language=de-DE|date=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
Methods of testing cosmetics on animals include many different tests that are categorized differently based on which areas the cosmetics will be used for. One new ingredient in any cosmetic product used in these tests could lead to the deaths of at least 1,400 animals &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nst.com.my/lifestyle/flair/2017/09/276688/cruelty-free-cosmetics |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180209063147/https://www.nst.com.my/lifestyle/flair/2017/09/276688/cruelty-free-cosmetics |archivedate=9 February 2018 |df=dmy-all }}. &lt;/ref&gt;

Dermal penetration: Rats are mostly used in this method that analyzes moment of a chemical, and the penetration of the chemical in the bloodstream. Dermal penetration is a method that creates a better understanding of skin absorption.&lt;ref name="aavs.org"/&gt;

Skin sensitisation: This is a method that determines if a chemical causes an allergic reaction. The chemical adjuvant is injected to boost the immune system. In the past it was performed on guinea pigs, and applied on a shaved patch of skin. Substances are assessed based on appearance of skin.&lt;ref name="aavs.org"/&gt;

Acute toxicity: This test is used to determine danger of exposure to a chemical by mouth, skin, or inflammation. Rats and mice are injected  in lethal dose 50% (LD50). This test can cause animal convulsions, loss of motor function, and seizures.&lt;ref name="aavs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aavs.org/animals-science/how-animals-are-used/testing/|title=Testing|work=American Anti-Vivisection Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Draize test]]: This is a method of testing that may cause irritation or corrosion to the skin or eye on animals, dermal sensitization, airway sensitization, endocrine disruption, and {{LD50}} (which refers to the lethal dose which kills 50% of the treated animals).

Skin corrosivity or irritation: This method of test assesses the potential of a substance causing irreversible damage to the skin. It is typically performed on rabbits and involves putting chemicals on a shaved patch of skin. This determines the level of damage to the skin that includes itching, inflammation, swelling, etc.&lt;ref name="aavs.org"/&gt;

==Alternatives==
Cosmetics manufacturers who do not test on animals may now use ''in vitro'' screens to test for endpoints which can determine potential risk to humans with a very high sensitivity and specificity. Companies such as CeeTox in the USA, recently acquired by Cyprotex, specialize in such testing and organizations like the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing (CAAT), PETA and many other organizations advocate the use of ''in vitro'' and other non-animal tests in the development of consumer products. By using safe ingredients from a list of 5,000 which have already been tested in conjunction with modern methods of cosmetics testing, the need for tests using animals are negated.&lt;ref name="Aus"/&gt;

EpiSkin™, EpiDerm™ and SkinEthic are each composed of artificial human skin as an option for alternative testing. Artificial skin can imitate the reaction actual human skin will have to a product and the chemicals it contains and can be altered to mimic different skin types and ages. For example, using UV light on EpiSkin can cause it to resemble older skin and adding melanocytes will turn the skin a darker color. This helped create a spectrum of different skin colors that are then used to compare the results of sunblock on a different variety of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merali|first=Zeeya|date=July 28, 2007|title=New Scientist|url=|journal=Human skin to replace animal tests|volume=195|pages=14-14|via=|doi=10.1016/s0262-4079(07)61866-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; To address potential issues with other parts of the human body, research companies such as NOTOX have developed a synthetic model of the human liver, which is the main organ to detox the body, in order to test harmful ingredients and chemicals to see if the liver can detox those elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mone|first=Gregory|date=April 2014|title=New Models in Cosmetics Replacing Animal Testing|url=|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=57|pages=20–21|doi=10.1145/2581925}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research companies can also use body parts and organs taken from animals  slaughtered for the [[meat industry]] to perform tests such as the Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability Test and Isolated Chicken Eye Test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Alternatives to Animal Tests : The Humane Society of the United States|url = http://m.humanesociety.org/issues/cosmetic_testing/facts/alternatives_animal_tests.html?credit=web_id329654370|website = m.humanesociety.org|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1937, a mistake was made that ended up changing the pharmaceutical industry drastically. A company created a medicine “to treat streptococcal infections”, and without any scientific research the medicine was out on shelves.&lt;ref name="medicaldaily.com"&gt;Scutti, Susan. "Animal Testing: A Long, Unpretty History." Medical Daily, 27 June 2013,www.medicaldaily.com/animal-testing-long-unpretty-history-247217.&lt;/ref&gt; This medicine turned out to be extremely poisonous to people, leading to large poisoning outbreaks followed by over 100 deaths.&lt;ref name="medicaldaily.com"/&gt; This epidemic led to a law being passed in 1938, called the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act, enforcing more rigorous guidelines on cosmetic products.&lt;ref&gt;Scutti,Susan. "Animal Testing: A Long, Unpretty History." Medical Daily, 27 June 2013,www.medicaldaily.com/animal-testing-long-unpretty-history-247217.&lt;/ref&gt; After this law was passed companies looked to animals to test their products, in turn, creating the first encounters of cosmetic animal testing.

== Non-profit organizations ==

*'''Cruelty Free International: '''Cruelty Free International and its partners manage the certification of all the companies across the world looking to be cruelty free.

==Procedures of animal testing==
{{See also|The Three Rs (animals)}}
There is a strategy used in animal testing laboratories titled the 'Three R's:' Reduction, refinement, and replacement' (Doke, "Alternatives to Animal Testing: A Review"). 
*'''Reduction:''' This approach is built upon the ethics to have a minimal number of animal subjects being tested on for current and later tests. 
*'''Refinement:''' This suggests that the planned distress and pain caused to an animal subject to be as little as possible. This approach focuses on making a home for the animals before entering testing grounds in order to elongate the life of laboratory animals. Discomfort to animals causes an imbalance in hormonal levels which create fluctuating results during testing. 
*'''Replacement:''' This provides the opportunity to study the response of cellular models, but in other words, replacement searches for alternatives that could be done rather than testing on animal subjects.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Legal requirements and status==
{{update section|date=December 2015}}
Due to the strong public backlash against cosmetic testing on animals, most cosmetic manufacturers say their products are not tested on animals. However, they are still required by trading standards and [[consumer protection]] laws in most countries to show their products are not toxic and not dangerous to public health, and that the ingredients are not dangerous in large quantities, such as when in transport or in the manufacturing plant. In some countries, it is possible to meet these requirements without any further tests on animals. In other countries, it may require animal testing to meet legal requirements. The United States and Japan are frequently criticized for their insistence on stringent safety measures, which often requires animal testing.
Some retailers distinguish themselves in the marketplace by their stance on animal testing.

=== Legal requirements in Japan ===

Although Japanese law doesn’t require non-medicated cosmetics to be tested on animals, it doesn’t prohibit it either, leaving the decision to individual companies.&lt;ref name="hsi.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Be Cruelty-Free Campaign Backed by Global Stars, Launches in Tokyo to End Cosmetics Animal Testing in Japan (March 17, 2014)|url=http://www.hsi.org/news/press_releases/2014/03/japan-bcf-campaign-launch-031714.html|website=Humane Society International|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Animal testing is required mainly when the product contains newly-developed tar colors, ultraviolet ray protective ingredients or preservatives, and when the amount of any ingredient regulated in terms of how much can be added is increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Development of Cosmetics -- Toward Abolishment of Animal Testing (February 2015)|url=http://www.japanfs.org/en/news/archives/news_id035188.html|website=JFS: Japan for Sustainability|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese Brands such as Shiseido and Mandom have ended much, but not all, of their animal testing. However, most other leading cosmetics companies in Japan still test on animals.&lt;ref name="hsi.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Initiatives in Response to Animal Testing and Alternative Methods|url=https://www.shiseidogroup.com/csr/challenge/experiment/|website=Shiseido Group|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Approach to alternative to animal experiments|url=http://www.mandom.co.jp/english/eco/src/society_animal.html|website=Mandom|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jurisdictions with bans ===

==== Brazil, São Paulo ====
[[São Paulo]] in Brazil, banned cosmetic animal testing in 2014.&lt;ref name="Sao Paulo"&gt;{{cite news|title=São Paulo Bans Animal Testing|url=http://www.petmd.com/news/care-safety/sao-paulo-bans-animal-testing-31269|publisher=AFP News|date=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== European Union ====
The European Union (EU) followed suit, after it agreed to phase in a near-total ban on the sale of animal-tested cosmetics throughout the EU from 2009, and to ban cosmetics-related animal testing.&lt;ref name="Euro"&gt;{{cite news|title=EU extends ban on animal-tested cosmetics|url=http://www.euronews.com/2013/03/11/eu-extends-ban-on-animal-tested-cosmetics/|date=11 March 2013|publisher=EuroNews}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal testing is regulated in [[EC Regulation 1223/2009 on cosmetics#Restrictions for hazardous ingredients and animal testing|EC Regulation 1223/2009 on cosmetics]]. Imported cosmetics ingredients tested on animals were phased out for EU consumer markets in 2013 by the ban,&lt;ref name="Euro"/&gt; but can still be sold to outside of the EU.&lt;ref name="Rhiannon"/&gt; Norway banned cosmetics animal testing the same time as the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Norway ban animal testing of cosmetics|url=http://www.theoslotimes.com/norway-ban-animal-testing-of-cosmetics/|work=The Oslo Times|date=12 March 2013|author=Aryan|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318075255/http://www.theoslotimes.com/norway-ban-animal-testing-of-cosmetics/|archivedate=18 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2018 the European Parliament voted for the EU and its Member States to work towards a UN convention against the use of animal testing for cosmetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Foster: "Cosmetic testing on animals must be banned worldwide”|url=http://conservativeeurope.com/news/foster-cosmetic-testing-on-animals-must-be-banned-worldwide|work=Conservatives in the European Parliament|date=3 May 2018|author=Jacqueline Foster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== India ====
In early 2014, India announced a ban on testing cosmetics on animals in the country, thereby becoming the second country in Asia to do so.&lt;ref name="India"&gt;{{cite news|title=Govt bans cosmetic companies from testing on animals|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Govt-bans-cosmetic-companies-from-testing-on-animals/articleshow/29225017.cms|date=23 Jan 2014|author=Mukherjee, Rupali|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later India banned import of cosmetics tested on animals in November 2014.&lt;ref name="Mohan 2014"&gt;{{cite web | last=Mohan | first=Vishwa | title=India bans import of cosmetics tested on animals |work=The Times of India | date=14 October 2014 | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/India-bans-import-of-cosmetics-tested-on-animals/articleshow/44814398.cms | accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Israel ====
Israel banned "the import and marketing of cosmetics, toiletries or detergents that were tested on animals" in 2013.&lt;ref name="Israel"&gt;{{cite news|title=Import ban on animal-tested products goes into effect|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/import-ban-on-animal-tested-products-goes-into-effect/|work=The Times of Israel|date=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== New Zealand ====
In 2015, New Zealand also banned animal testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/270097/mps-unanimously-support-animal-testing-ban|title=MPs unanimously support animal testing ban|date=31 March 2015|work=Radio New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Turkey ====
Turkey "banned any animal testing for cosmetic products that have already been introduced to the market."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailysabah.com/nation/2015/07/27/animal-testing-for-cosmetics-banned-in-turkey|title=Animal testing for cosmetics banned in Turkey|date=27 July 2015|work=DailySabah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== UK ====
Animal testing on cosmetics or their ingredients was banned in the UK in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal Research Regulations in the UK |url=http://speakingofresearch.com/facts/animal-research-regulations-in-the-uk/ |accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jurisdictions where prohibitions are considered ===

==== Association of Southeast Asian Nations ====
The [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) is potentially "making strides toward ending cosmetics testing on animals."&lt;ref name="US Bill"/&gt;

==== Australia ====
In Australia, the ''End Cruel Cosmetics Bill'' was introduced to Parliament in March 2014, which would ban local testing, which generally doesn't happen there, and importation of cosmetics tested on animals.&lt;ref name="Aus"/&gt; In 2016 a bill was passed to ban the sale of cosmetics tested on animals, which will come into effect in July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/cosmetics-tested-on-animals-to-be-banned-in-australia/news-story/a6362ab50a6146af5c83e60c8e40d93e&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Brazil ====
Brazil's legislation will vote on a nationwide animal testing for cosmetics ban by the end of March 2014.&lt;ref name="HSUS"/&gt;

==== United States ====
In March 2014, the ''Humane Cosmetics Act'' was introduced to the U.S. congress which would ban cosmetic testing on animals and eventually would ban the sale of cosmetics tested on animals.&lt;ref name="US Bill"/&gt; The bill did not advance.

==== South Korea ====
South Korea is also potentially "making strides toward ending cosmetics testing on animals."&lt;ref name="US Bill"/&gt;

==== Taiwan ====
In 2015, Taiwan launched a bill proposing a ban on cosmetic testing on animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/testing/animalalt/Taiwan-Proposes-Animal-Testing-Ban-for-Cosmetics-303286171.html|title=Taiwan Proposes Animal Testing Ban for Cosmetics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It passed in 2016 and goes into effect in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsi.org/news/press_releases/2016/10/taiwan-bans-cosmetics-animal-testing-072116.html|title=Taiwan bans cosmetics animal testing|publisher=Humane Society International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other statuses ===

==== China ====
China passed a law on 30 June 2014 to eliminate the requirement for animal testing of cosmetics. Though domestically-produced ordinary cosmetic goods do not require testing, animal testing is still mandated by law for Chinese-made "cosmeceuticals" (cosmetic goods which make a functional claim) which are available for sale in China. Cosmetics intended solely for export are exempt from the animal testing requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ethicalelephant.com/understanding-china-animal-testing-laws/|title=Understanding China's Animal Testing Laws 2015|author=|date=9 September 2015|website=ethicalelephant.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Russia ====
In 2013, the Russian Ministry of Health stated "Toxicological testing is performed by means of testing for skin allergic reaction or test on
[[mucous tissue]]/eye area (with use of lab animals) or by use of alternative general toxicology methods (IN VITRO). In this manner the technical regulations include measures which provide an alternative to animal testing".&lt;ref name="Russia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cruelty Free International wins Russian commitment on non-animal testing|url=http://www.crueltyfreeinternational.org/en/a/Cruelty-Free-International-wins-Russian-commitment-on-non-animal-testing|accessdate=12 May 2015|archivedate=18 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518073423/http://www.crueltyfreeinternational.org/en/a/Cruelty-Free-International-wins-Russian-commitment-on-non-animal-testing|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--===UK position===
Although the British Home Office stopped giving licences to test finished cosmetic products in 1998, compounds that have both cosmetic and medical uses, such as those in the "anti-wrinkle" preparations Zyderm, Restylane and [[Botox]], are still bound by the regulations requiring animal testing. According to activists, a raid on a laboratory in 2004 revealed that the {{LD50}} test is still used on every batch of Botox (a [[toxin]] that, when administered intravenously, is lethal to humans) to establish potency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918114852/http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/156/156795_animal_rights_man_faces_jail_over_lab_raid.html |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/156/156795_animal_rights_man_faces_jail_over_lab_raid.html |archivedate=18 September 2012 |title=Animal rights man faces jail over lab raid |date=29 April 2005 |work=[[Manchester Evening News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217084038/http://www.animalaid.org.uk/news/2004/0401boto.htm |url=http://www.animalaid.org.uk/news/2004/0401boto.htm |archivedate=17 February 2006 |publisher=Animal Aid |title=Boycott Botox! – Cosmetic scandal exposed |date=January 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929132044/http://www.sarconline.co.uk/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=129&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0&amp;POSTNUKESID=f070fc85519cfcb46ad4f3d2d92abb1c |url=http://www.sarconline.co.uk/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=129&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0&amp;POSTNUKESID=f070fc85519cfcb46ad4f3d2d92abb1c |archivedate=29 September 2007 |title=Keith Mann Sentanced &lt;nowiki&gt;[sic]&lt;/nowiki&gt; – Press response |publisher=Southern Animal Rights Coalition }}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

'''Tourism''' is [[travel]] for pleasure or business; also the theory and practice of touring, the business of attracting, accommodating, and entertaining tourists, and the business of operating tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|tourism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourism may be international, or within the traveller's country. The [[World Tourism Organization]] defines tourism more generally, in terms which go "beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only", as people "traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure and not less than 24 hours, business and other purposes".&lt;ref name="unwto1034"&gt;{{cite web|year=1995 |url=http://pub.unwto.org/WebRoot/Store/Shops/Infoshop/Products/1034/1034-1.pdf |title=UNWTO technical manual: Collection of Tourism Expenditure Statistics |page=10 |publisher=World Tourism Organization |access-date=26 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922120940/http://pub.unwto.org/WebRoot/Store/Shops/Infoshop/Products/1034/1034-1.pdf |archivedate=22 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourism can be domestic or international, and international tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on a country's [[balance of payments]]. Today, tourism is a major source of income for many countries, and affects the economy of both the source and host countries, in some cases being of vital importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journal.georgetown.edu/the-growing-importance-of-tourism-in-the-global-economy-and-international-affairs/|title=The Growing Importance of Tourism in the Global Economy and International Affairs {{!}}|website=journal.georgetown.edu|language=en-US|access-date=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourism suffered as a result of a strong economic slowdown of the [[late-2000s recession]], between the second half of 2008 and the end of 2009, and the outbreak of the [[2009 flu pandemic|H1N1 influenza virus]],&lt;ref name=Barom2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=WTOaugust10/&gt; but slowly recovered. International tourism receipts (the travel item in the [[balance of payments]]) grew to {{USD|1.03}} trillion ({{euro|740}} billion) in 2011, corresponding to an increase in [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real terms]] of 3.8% from 2010.&lt;ref name="pr12027"/&gt; International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012,&lt;ref name=Barom2012/&gt; [[emerging markets]] such as [[China]], [[Russia]], and [[Brazil]] had significantly increased their spending over the previous decade.&lt;ref name="Barom201304"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.unwto.org/en/press-release/2013-04-04/china-new-number-one-tourism-source-market-world |title=China – the new number one tourism source market in the world|publisher=[[World Tourism Organization]]|date=4 April 2013|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ITB Berlin]] is the world's leading tourism [[trade fair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITB Berlin: The World's Leading Travel Trade Show|url=http://www.expodatabase.com/tradeshow/itb-berlin-the-worlds-leading-travel-trade-show-908.html|website=www.expodatabase.com|publisher=M+A Expo Database|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global tourism accounts for ca. 8% of global [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.&lt;ref&gt;Lenzen et al.

==Etymology==
[[File:Vysoké Tatry r.1922.jpg|thumb|1922 postcard of tourists in the [[High Tatras]], [[Slovakia]].]]

The word ''tourist'' was used in 1772&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Griffiths|first1=Ralph|authorlink1=Ralph Griffiths|author2=Griffiths, G. E. |title=Pennant's Tour in Scotland in 1769|journal=[[Monthly Review (London)|The Monthly Review, Or, Literary Journal]]|year=1772|volume=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xS8oAAAAYAAJ&amp;vq=tourist&amp;dq=tourist&amp;pg=PA150|accessdate=23 December 2011|location=London|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''tourism'' in 1811.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=tour&amp;searchmode=none|title=tour (n.)|first1=Douglas|last1=Harper|authorlink1=Douglas Harper|work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is formed from the word ''tour'', which is derived from Old English ''turian'', from Old French ''torner'', from Latin ''tornare''; 'to turn on a lathe,' which is itself from Ancient Greek ''tornos'' (τόρνος); 'lathe'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=turn&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=etymonline.com|access-date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance of tourism==

Not only does the service sector grow thanks to tourism, but also local [[Craft|manufacturers]] (like those producing the strandkorb chairs), [[retail]]ers, the [[Real estate development|real-estate sector]] and the general [[City marketing|image of a location]] can benefit.]]

Tourism has become an important, even vital, source of income for many regions and even entire countries. The ''Manila Declaration on World Tourism of 1980'' recognized its importance as "an activity essential to the life of nations because of its direct effects on the social, cultural, educational, and economic sectors of national societies and on their international relations."&lt;ref name="unwto1034"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url= http://www.univeur.org/cuebc/downloads/PDF%20carte/65.%20Manila.PDF |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121120180003/http://www.univeur.org/CMS/UserFiles/65.%20Manila.PDF |archivedate= 20 November 2012 |title=  Manila Declaration on World Tourism |date= 10 October 1980|pages= 1–4|location= [[Manila]], [[Philippines]] |conference= World Tourism Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tourism brings large amounts of income into a local economy in the form of payment for [[goods and services]] needed by tourists, accounting {{as of | 2011 | lc = on}} for 30% of the world's [[trade]] in services, and for 6% of overall [[export]]s of goods and services.&lt;ref name="pr12027"/&gt; It also generates opportunities for [[employment]] in the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service sector of the economy]] associated with tourism.&lt;ref name="WTO2012Highlights"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://mkt.unwto.org/sites/all/files/docpdf/unwtohighlights12enlr_1.pdf |title= 2012 Tourism Highlights |publisher= UNWTO |accessdate= 17 June 2012 |date= June 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120709215809/http://mkt.unwto.org/sites/all/files/docpdf/unwtohighlights12enlr_1.pdf |archivedate= 9 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hospitality industries which benefit from tourism include [[transport |transportation services]] (such as [[airline]]s, [[cruise ship]]s, [[train]]s and [[taxicab]]s); [[hospitality service]]s (such as [[lodging|accommodations]], including [[hotel]]s and [[resort]]s); and entertainment venues (such as [[amusement park]]s, [[restaurant]]s, [[casino]]s, [[shopping mall]]s, [[music venue]]s, and [[theatre|theaters]]). This is in addition to goods bought by tourists, including [[souvenir]]s.

On the flip-side, tourism can degrade people and sour relationships between host and guest.&lt;ref&gt;

| quote = The globalisation of tourism has partially exacerbated the relationships of inequality and subservience that are so commonplace in host-guest encounters. It is not simply enough for local people to accept their role as servants, guides or companions to a range of ever-changing tourists. They are also confronted increasingly by the luxurious global products of Western indulgence which remain far from their reach, rather like the thirsty Tantalus in his elusive pool of water.

==Definitions==
In 1936, the [[League of Nations]] defined a ''foreign tourist'' as "someone traveling abroad for at least twenty-four hours". Its successor, the [[United Nations]], amended this definition in 1945, by including a maximum stay of six months.&lt;ref name="theobald"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9dvK2ajv7zIC&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=league%20of%20nations%20tourism%201936&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q=league%20of%20nations%20tourism%201936|title=Global Tourism|last=Theobald|first=William F.|publisher=[[Butterworth–Heinemann]]|year=1998|isbn=978-0-7506-4022-0|edition= 2nd|location=Oxford [England]|pages=6–7|oclc=40330075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Hunziker and Kraft defined tourism as "the sum of the phenomena and relationships arising from the travel and stay of non-residents, insofar as they do not lead to [[Permanent residency|permanent residence]] and are not connected with any earning activity."&lt;ref name="1941define"&gt;{{cite book|title=Grundriß Der Allgemeinen Fremdenverkehrslehre|last1=Hunziker |first1=W|authorlink1=Walter Hunziker|last2=Krapf|first2=K|oclc=180109383|publisher=Polygr.

It includes movements for all purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beaver|first=Allan|title=A Dictionary of Travel and Tourism Terminology|year=2002|publisher=CAB International|isbn=978-0-85199-582-3|page=313|location=Wallingford |oclc=301675778}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, the International Association of Scientific Experts in Tourism defined tourism in terms of particular activities chosen and undertaken outside the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The AIEST, its character and aims|url=http://www.aiest.org/org/idt/idt_aiest.nsf/en/index.html|author=International Association of Scientific Experts in Tourism|accessdate=29 March 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126143828/http://www.aiest.org/org/idt/idt_aiest.nsf/en/index.html|archivedate=26 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the [[United Nations]] identified three forms of tourism in its ''Recommendations on Tourism Statistics'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=1994|title=Recommendations on Tourism Statistics|url=https://unstats.un.org/unsd/newsletter/unsd_workshops/tourism/st_esa_stat_ser_M_83.pdf|journal=|series=M|location=New York|volume=|issue=83|page=5|pages=|work=Statistical Papers|accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Domestic tourism, involving residents of the given country traveling only within this country
* Inbound tourism, involving non-residents traveling in the given country
* Outbound tourism, involving residents traveling in another country

The terms ''tourism'' and ''travel'' are sometimes used interchangeably. In this context, travel has a similar definition to tourism, but implies a more purposeful journey. The terms ''tourism'' and ''tourist'' are sometimes used pejoratively, to imply a shallow interest in the cultures or locations visited. By contrast, ''traveler'' is often used as a sign of distinction. The sociology of tourism has studied the cultural values underpinning these distinctions and their implications for class relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Tourists_at_the_Taj.html?id=YjLxR2H-YCYC|title=Tourists at the Taj: Performance and Meaning at a Symbolic Site|last=Edensor|first=Tim|date=1 January 1998|publisher=Psychology Press|year=|isbn=9780415167123|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antiquity===
{{see also|Travel literature}}
Travel outside a person's local area for leisure was largely confined to wealthy classes, who at times traveled to distant parts of the world, to see great buildings and works of art, [[multilingualism|learn new languages]], experience new cultures, and to taste different [[cuisine]]s. As early as [[Shulgi]], however, kings praised themselves for protecting roads and building way stations for travelers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HFWjoeVCLk0C|title=Introduction To Tourism|last=Jayapalan|first=N.|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist|isbn=9788171569779|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Travelling for pleasure can be seen in [[Egypt]] as early on as 1500 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Casson|first1=Lionel|title=Travel in the Ancient World|date=1994|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Roman Republic]], [[spa]]s and coastal resorts such as [[Baiae]] were popular among the rich. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] wrote his ''Description of Greece'' in the 2nd century AD. In [[ancient China]], nobles sometimes made a point of visiting [[Mount Tai]] and, on occasion, all [[five Sacred Mountains]].

===Middle Ages===
By the [[Middle Ages]], [[Christian pilgrimage|Christianity]] and [[Buddhist pilgrimage|Buddhism]] had traditions of [[pilgrimage]]. [[Chaucer]]'s [[Canterbury Tales]] and [[Wu Cheng'en]]'s ''[[Journey to the West]]'' remain classics of [[English literature|English]] and [[Chinese literature]].

The 10th- to 13th-century [[Song dynasty]] also saw secular [[travel literature|travel writers]] such as [[Su Shi]] (11th century) and [[Fan Chengda]] (12th century) become popular in [[China]]. Under the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]], [[Xu Xiake]] continued the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Hargett, James. "Some Preliminary Remarks on the Travel Records of the Song Dynasty (960-1279)" in ''Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews'', {{nowrap|Vol. 7}}, {{nowrap|No. 1/2}}, {{nowrap|pp. 67–93}}. 1985. {{doi|10.2307/495194}}. {{JSTOR|495194}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[medieval Italy]], [[Francesco Petrarch]] also wrote an allegorical account of his 1336 ascent of [[Mount Ventoux]] that praised the act of traveling and criticized ''frigida incuriositas'' ("cold lack of curiosity"). The [[Duke of Burgundy|Burgundian]] poet {{Interlanguage link multi|Michault Taillevent|fr}} later composed his own horrified recollections of a 1430 trip through the [[Jura Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7yqsIYSNmLMC&amp;pg=PA32 | title=Un poète bourguignon du XVe siècle, Michault Taillevent: édition et étude | publisher=Librairie Droz |author1=Deschaux, Robert |author2=Taillevent, Michault | year=1975 | pages=31–32| isbn=9782600028318 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grand Tour===
[[File:Willem van Haecht Władysław Vasa.JPG|thumb|Prince Ladislaus Sigismund of Poland visiting Gallery of [[Cornelis van der Geest]] in [[Brussels]] in 1624.]]
{{See also|Grand Tour}}
Modern tourism can be traced to what was known as the [[Grand Tour]], which was a traditional trip around [[Europe]] (especially [[Germany]] and [[Italy]]), undertaken by mainly [[Upper class|upper-class]] European young men of means, mainly from Western and Northern European countries. In 1624, young Prince of [[Poland]], [[Władysław IV Vasa|Ladislaus Sigismund Vasa]], the eldest son and heir of [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund III]], embarked for a journey across Europe, as was in [[Norm (sociology)|custom]] among Polish nobility.&lt;ref name="wladcy12b"&gt;[[Tomasz Bohun]], ''Podróże po Europie'', ''Władysław IV Wasa'', Władcy Polski, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; He travelled through territories of today's Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, where he admired the [[Siege of Breda (1624)|Siege of Breda]] by Spanish forces, France, Switzerland to Italy, Austria, and the [[Czech Republic]].&lt;ref name="wladcy12b"/&gt; It was an educational journey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adam Kucharski |title=Dyplomacja i turystyka&amp;nbsp;– królewicz Władysław Waza w posiadłościach hiszpańskich (1624–1625)|url=http://www.wilanow-palac.art.pl/dyplomacja_i_turystyka_krolewicz_wladyslaw_waza_w_posiadlosciach_hiszpanskich_1624_1625.html |work=Silva Rerum |accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the outcomes was introduction of [[Polish opera|Italian opera]] in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].&lt;ref&gt;’’The Oxford Illustrated History of Opera’’, ed. Roger Parker (1994): chapter on Central and Eastern European opera by John Warrack, p. 240; ‘’The Viking Opera Guide’’, ed. Amanda Holden (1993): articles on Polish composers, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom flourished from about 1660 until the advent of large-scale [[rail transport|rail]] transit in the 1840s, and generally followed a standard [[Travel itinerary|itinerary]]. It was an educational opportunity and [[rite of passage]]. Though primarily associated with the [[British nobility]] and wealthy [[landed gentry]], similar trips were made by wealthy young men of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Northern Europe]]an nations on the [[Continental Europe|Continent]], and from the second half of the 18th century some South American, US, and other overseas youth joined in. The tradition was extended to include more of the [[middle class]] after rail and steamship travel made the journey easier, and [[Thomas Cook &amp; Son|Thomas Cook]] made the "Cook's Tour" a byword.

The Grand Tour became a real status symbol for upper class students in the 18th and 19th centuries. In this period, Johann Joachim Winckelmann's theories about the supremacy of classic culture became very popular and appreciated in the European academic world. Artists, writers and travellers (such as [[Goethe]]) affirmed the supremacy of classic art of which Italy, France and Greece provide excellent examples. For these reasons, the Grand Tour's main destinations were to those centres, where upper-class students could find rare examples of classic art and history.

''[[The New York Times]]'' recently described the Grand Tour in this way:

{{Quote|text=Three hundred years ago, wealthy young Englishmen began taking a post-[[Oxbridge]] trek through France and Italy in search of art, culture and the roots of [[Western culture|Western civilization]]. With nearly unlimited funds, aristocratic connections and months (or years) to roam, they [[Commission (art)|commissioned paintings]], perfected their language skills and mingled with the upper crust of the Continent.|sign=Gross, Matt.|source=[http://frugaltraveler.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/05/lesons-from-the-frugal-grand-tour/index.html Lessons From the Frugal Grand Tour]." ''New York Times'' 5 September 2008.}}

The primary value of the Grand Tour, it was believed, laid in the exposure both to the cultural legacy of [[classical antiquity]] and the [[Renaissance]], and to the aristocratic and fashionably polite society of the European continent.

===Emergence of leisure travel===
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2013}}
[[File:Carl Spitzweg 047.jpg|thumb|''Englishman in the [[Roman Campagna|Campagna]]'' by [[Carl Spitzweg]] (c. 1845)]]

[[Leisure]] travel was associated with the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the [[United Kingdom]]{{spaced ndash}}the first European country to promote leisure time to the increasing industrial population.&lt;ref name="singh"&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=L. K.|title=Fundamental of Tourism and Travel|year=2008|publisher=Isha Books|location=Delhi|isbn=978-81-8205-478-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mWf4PtzRmwUC&amp;lpg=PA189&amp;dq=the%20first%20European%20country%20to%20promote%20leisure%20time%20to%20the%20increasing%20industrial%20population&amp;pg=PA189|page=189|chapter=Issues in Tourism Industry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, this applied to the owners of the machinery of production, the economic oligarchy, factory owners and traders. These comprised the new [[middle class]].&lt;ref name="singh"/&gt; [[Cox &amp; Kings]] was the first official travel company to be formed in 1758.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coxandkings.co.uk/aboutus-history.aspx|title=History: Centuries of Experience|publisher=[[Cox &amp; Kings]]|accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British origin of this new industry is reflected in many place names. In [[Nice]], France, one of the first and best-established holiday resorts on the [[French Riviera]], the long esplanade along the seafront is known to this day as the ''[[Promenade des Anglais]]''; in many other historic resorts in [[continental Europe]], old, well-established palace hotels have names like the ''[[Hotel Bristol]]'', ''Hotel Carlton'', or ''Hotel Majestic''{{spaced ndash}}reflecting the dominance of English customers.

[[File:Thomas Cook Building, Leicester, panels.jpg|thumb|Panels from the Thomas Cook Building in Leicester, displaying excursions offered by [[Thomas Cook]]]]
[[File:Leicester Rail Station - geograph.org.uk - 1266728.jpg|left|thumb|[[Leicester railway station]] – built in 1894 to replace, largely on the same site, [[Leicester Campbell Street railway station|Campbell Street station]], the origin for many of Cook's early tours.]]
A pioneer of the travel agency business, [[Thomas Cook]]'s idea to offer excursions came to him while waiting for the stagecoach on the London Road at [[Kibworth]]. With the opening of the extended [[Midland Counties Railway]], he arranged to take a group of 540 [[Temperance Movement|temperance campaigners]] from [[Leicester]] [[Leicester Campbell Street railway station|Campbell Street station]] to a rally in [[Loughborough]], {{convert|11|mi|km|spell=in}} away. On 5 July 1841, Thomas Cook arranged for the rail company to charge one [[shilling]] per person; this included rail tickets and food for the journey. Cook was paid a share of the fares charged to the passengers, as the railway tickets, being legal contracts between company and passenger, could not have been issued at his own price.{{clarify|date=April 2017}} This was the first privately chartered [[excursion train]] to be advertised to the general public; Cook himself acknowledged that there had been previous, unadvertised, private excursion trains.&lt;ref&gt;Ingle, R., 1991 ''Thomas Cook of Leicester'', Bangor, Headstart History&lt;/ref&gt; During the following three summers he planned and conducted outings for temperance societies and [[Sunday school]] children. In 1844 the Midland Counties Railway Company agreed to make a permanent arrangement with him, provided he found the passengers. This success led him to start his own business running rail excursions for pleasure, taking a percentage of the railway fares.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thomascook.com/thomas-cook-history/|title=Thomas Cook History|website=www.thomascook.com|access-date=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1855, he planned his first excursion abroad, when he took a group from Leicester to [[Calais]] to coincide with the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Paris Exhibition]]. The following year he started his "grand circular tours" of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thomascook.com/thomas-cook-history/key-dates/|title=Key Dates 1841–2014 {{!}} Thomas Cook|website=www.thomascook.com|access-date=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1860s he took parties to Switzerland, Italy, Egypt and the United States. Cook established "inclusive independent travel", whereby the traveller went independently but his agency charged for travel, food and accommodation for a fixed period over any chosen route. Such was his success that the Scottish railway companies withdrew their support between 1862 and 1863 to try the excursion business for themselves.

==Cruise shipping==
[[File:Prinzessin Victoria Luise LOC det.4a15439.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Prinzessin Victoria Luise]], the first [[cruise ship]] of the world, launched in June 1900 in [[Hamburg]] (Germany)]]
Cruising is a popular form of [[water tourism]].
Leisure [[cruise ship]]s were introduced by the ''[[Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation Company]]'' (P&amp;O) in 1844, sailing from [[Southampton]] to destinations such as [[Gibraltar]], [[Malta]] and [[Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.btnews.co.uk/article/5037|title=CRUISE NEWS JUNE 2012|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891, German businessman [[Albert Ballin]] sailed the ship [[Augusta Victoria (ship)|''Augusta Victoria'']] from [[Hamburg]] into the Mediterranean Sea. June 29, 1900 saw the launching of the first purpose-built cruise ship was ''[[Prinzessin Victoria Luise]]'', built in Hamburg for the Hamburg America Line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cruiselinehistory.com/the-prinzessin-victoria-luise-worlds-first-cruise-ship/|title=The Prinzessin Victoria Luise – world’s first cruise ship.|work=CRUISING THE PAST|access-date=2018-08-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern day tourism==
{{see|Impacts of tourism}}

Many leisure-oriented tourists travel to [[seaside resort]]s on their nearest coast or further afield. Coastal areas in the tropics are popular in both summer and winter.

===Mass tourism===
[[File:Adolf Friedrich Erdmann von Menzel 044.jpg|thumb|''Reisepläne'' (''Travel plans'') by [[Adolph Menzel]] (1875)]]
[[File:Rom fountain of Trevi.jpg|thumb|Mass tourism at the [[Trevi Fountain]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]]]
[[File:Barceloneta 2007.jpg|thumb|Tourists at the Mediterranean Coast of [[Barcelona]], 2007]]

Academics have defined mass tourism as travel by groups on pre-scheduled tours, usually under the organization of tourism professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Golden Age of Mass Tourism: Its History and Development, Erkan Sezgin and Medet Yolal, [[Anadolu University]], p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; This form of tourism developed during the second half of the 19th century in the [[United Kingdom]] and was pioneered by [[Thomas Cook]]. Cook took advantage of Europe's rapidly expanding railway network and established a company that offered affordable day trip excursions to [[the masses]], in addition to longer holidays to Continental Europe, India, Asia and the Western Hemisphere which attracted wealthier customers. By the 1890s over 20,000 tourists per year used [[Thomas Cook &amp; Son]].&lt;ref name="Mass Tourism p. 74"&gt;Golden Age of Mass Tourism: Its History and Development, Erkan Sezgin and Medet Yolal, [[Anadolu University]], p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between tourism companies, transportation operators and hotels is a central feature of mass tourism. Cook was able to offer prices that were below the publicly advertised price because his company purchased large numbers of tickets from railroads.&lt;ref name="Mass Tourism p. 74"/&gt; One contemporary form of mass tourism, [[package tour]]ism, still incorporates the partnership between these three groups.

Travel developed during the early 20th century and was facilitated by the development of the automobiles and later by airplanes.
Improvements in transport allowed many people to travel quickly to places of leisure interest, so that more people could begin to enjoy the benefits of leisure time.

In [[Continental Europe]], early [[seaside resort]]s included: [[Heiligendamm]], founded in 1793 at the [[Baltic Sea]], being the first seaside resort; [[Ostend]], popularised by the people of [[Brussels]]; [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] and [[Deauville]] for the [[Paris]]ians; [[Taormina]] in [[Sicily]]. In the [[United States]], the first seaside resorts in the European style were at [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]] and [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

By the mid-20th century the Mediterranean Coast became the principal mass tourism destination. The 1960s and 1970s saw mass tourism play a major role in the [[Spanish miracle#Mass tourism and emigration|Spanish economic "miracle"]].

===Niche tourism===
{{main list|List of adjectival tourisms}}
[[File:Cristo Rei (36211699613).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Christ the King (Almada)|Sanctuary of Christ the King]], in [[Almada]], has become one of the most religious tourism visited places.]]

Niche tourism refers to the numerous specialty forms of tourism that have emerged over the years, each with its own adjective. Many of these terms have come into common use by the tourism industry and academics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lew|first=Alan A.|title=Long Tail Tourism: New geographies for marketing niche tourism products|journal=Journal of Travel &amp; Tourism Marketing|year=2008|volume=25|issue=3–4|pages=409–19|doi=10.1080/10548400802508515|url=http://www.geog.nau.edu/publications/Long-Tail-Tourism-Lew.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614084130/http://www.geog.nau.edu/publications/Long-Tail-Tourism-Lew.pdf|archivedate=14 June 2010|df=dmy-all|citeseerx=10.1.1.467.6320}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others are emerging concepts that may or may not gain popular usage. Examples of the more common niche tourism markets are:
{{colbegin}}
* [[Agritourism]]
* [[Birth tourism]]
* [[Culinary tourism]]
* [[Cultural tourism]]
* [[Dark tourism]] (also called "black tourism" or "grief tourism") 
* [[Eco tourism]]
* [[Extreme tourism]]
* [[Geotourism]]
* [[Heritage tourism]]
* [[LGBT tourism]]
* [[Medical tourism]]
* [[Movie tourism]]
* [[Nautical tourism]]
* [[Pop-culture tourism]]
* [[Religious tourism]]
* [[Sex tourism]]
* [[Slum tourism]]
* [[Sports tourism]]
* [[Virtual tourism]]
* [[War tourism]]
* [[Wellness tourism]]
* [[Wildlife tourism]]
{{colend}}

Other terms used for niche or specialty travel forms include the term "destination" in the descriptions, such as [[destination wedding]]s, and terms such as [[location vacation]].

===Winter tourism===
{{See also|List of ski areas and resorts|Winter sport}}
[[St. Moritz]], [[Switzerland]] became the cradle of the developing winter tourism in the 1860s: hotel manager Johannes Badrutt invited some summer guests from England to return in the winter to see the snowy landscape, thereby inaugurating a popular trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stmoritz.ch/en/winter/village/spirit-history/birthplace-of-winter-tourism.html|title=Birthplace of winter tourism|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017122131/http://www.stmoritz.ch/en/winter/village/spirit-history/birthplace-of-winter-tourism.html|archivedate=17 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Early Winter Tourism|url=http://www.kulmhotel-stmoritz.ch/en/portrait/tradition-history/early-winter-tourism.html|work=Tradition &amp; History|publisher=Kulm Hotel|accessdate=23 December 2011|location=[[St. Moritz]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219230025/http://www.kulmhotel-stmoritz.ch/en/portrait/tradition-history/early-winter-tourism.html|archivedate=19 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was, however, only in the 1970s when winter tourism took over the lead from summer tourism in many of the Swiss ski resorts. Even in winter, up to one third of all guests (depending on the location) consist of non-skiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.graubuenden.ch/winter-walking-switzerland.html |title=Winter hiking in Switzerland-Graubünden|publisher=graubuenden.ch |accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major [[ski resort]]s are located mostly in the various European countries (e.g. [[Andorra]], [[Austria]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Cyprus]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], Greece, [[Iceland]], [[Italy]], [[Norway]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[List of ski areas and resorts in Europe#Poland|Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], [[Sweden]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], [[Turkey]]), [[Canada]], the [[United States]] (e.g. Montana, Utah, Colorado, California, Wyoming, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York) [[Argentina]], [[New Zealand]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Chile]], and [[Lebanon]].

Some places that already have ski opportunities can also have glaciers in the area. Some of theses places already offer a glacier hike to see the glaciers in another way that they can. One of these places are New Zealand. New Zealand has several glaciers that are available for this experience. The Franz Josef is one of these glaciers that tourism is available. The only way to get to the glacier is via a helicopter. Before helicopters were invented the way that people were able to get up to the glacier was by hiking up to the glacier. The companies have to make sure that people are safe from when they are on the glacier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Purdie|first=Heather|date=1 November 2013|title=Glacier Retreat and Tourism: Insights from New Zealand|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-12-00073.1|journal=Mountain Research and Development|volume=33|issue=4|pages=463–472|doi=10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-12-00073.1|issn=0276-4741}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would fall under environmental tourism as well as winter tourism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Recent developments==
[[File:Aerial view Yacht Harbour Residence Rostock Yachthafenresidenz Hohe Düne 6.jpg|thumb|right|A [[destination hotel]] in [[Germany]]: ''Yacht Harbour Residence'' in [[Warnemünde|Rostock]], [[Mecklenburg]].]]
[[File:Can you see the surfer? (33988985575).jpg|thumb|right|[[Nazaré, Portugal]], is now listed on the [[Guinness World Records]] for the biggest waves ever surfed and has become a worldwide tourist attraction.]]
There has been an up-trend in tourism over the last few decades,{{vague|date=November 2013}} especially in Europe, where international travel for short breaks is common. Tourists have a wide range of budgets and tastes, and a wide variety of resorts and hotels have developed to cater for them. For example, some people prefer simple beach vacations, while others want more specialised holidays, quieter resorts, family-oriented holidays, or niche market-targeted [[destination hotel]]s.

The developments in [[Aviation|air transport]] infrastructure, such as [[Wide-body aircraft|jumbo jets]], [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost airlines]], and more [[accessible tourism|accessible]] [[airport]]s have made many types of tourism more affordable. The [[WHO]] estimated in 2009 that there are around half a million people on board aircraft at any given time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8477508 Swine flu prompts EU warning on travel to US]. ''The Guardian.'' 28 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been changes in lifestyle, for example some retirement-age people sustain year round tourism. This is facilitated by [[Electronic commerce|internet sales]] of tourist services. Some sites have now started to offer [[dynamic packaging]], in which an inclusive price is quoted for a tailor-made package requested by the customer upon impulse.

There have been a few setbacks in tourism, such as the [[September 11 attacks]] and [[terrorism|terrorist threats]] to [[tourist destination]]s, such as in [[Bali]] and several European cities. Also, on 26 December 2004, a [[tsunami]], caused by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]], hit the [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Asia|Asian countries]] on the [[Indian Ocean]], including the [[Maldives]]. Thousands of lives were lost including many tourists. This, together with the vast [[clean-up]] operations, stopped or severely hampered tourism in the area for a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://travelcupio.com/category/destination/asia-pacific/india/|title=India Top Tourist Destinations &amp; Attractions|website=TravelCupio|language=en-US|access-date=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual low-price or even zero-price overnight stays have become more popular in the 2000s, especially with a strong growth in the [[hostel]] market and services like [[CouchSurfing]] and [[airbnb]] being established.&lt;ref name="newyorkercouch"&gt;{{cite web|last=Marx|first=Patricia|title=Couch-surfing the globe|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/04/16/120416fa_fact_marx|publisher=The New Yorker|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been examples of jurisdictions wherein a significant portion of GDP is being spent on altering the primary sources of revenue towards tourism, as has occurred for instance in [[Dubai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cadene|first1=Philippe|title=Atlas of the Gulf States|date=2013|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable tourism===
{{Main|Sustainable tourism}}

"Sustainable tourism is envisaged as leading to management of all resources in such a way that economic, social and aesthetic needs can be fulfilled while maintaining cultural integrity, essential ecological processes, [[Biodiversity|biological diversity]] and life support systems." ([[World Tourism Organization]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainable Tourism: Turning the Tide |url=http://www.stakeholderforum.org/fileadmin/files/SF_Briefing_Papers/bp_tourism.pdf|work=Towards Earth Summit 2002|publisher=[[Stakeholder Forum for a Sustainable Future]]|access-date=22 January 2012|date=August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sustainable development]] implies "meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs." ([[Bruntland Commission|World Commission on Environment and Development]], 1987)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resolution adopted by the General Assembly|url=http://www.un-documents.net/a42r187.htm|work=42/187. Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development|publisher=[[The Conference of NGOs]]|access-date=21 January 2012|date=11 December 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important part of sustainable tourism is something known as the three pillars of sustainability which include Economic, Environmental/Ecological and Socio-cultural. For a destination to be truly sustainable it must have an equal balance which the three pillars. Economic is in relation to money and making and maintaining a certain amount of cash. Environmental is of course in relation to the environment it looks into whether the local ecosystems can support the influx of visitors and also how these visitors effect the ecosystem. Then finally Socio-cultural is about how well the culture of this area is able to maintain its traditions with the incoming tourists.  These pillars are important because they are the true key to being sustainable when discussing tourism.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Sustainable tourism can be seen as having regard to ecological and social-cultural carrying capacities and includes involving the community of the destination in tourism development planning (that was done e.g. in [[Fruška Gora]] National Park in [[Serbia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vujko|first=Aleksandra|last2=Plavša|first2=Jovan|last3=Petrović|first3=Marko|last4=Radovanović|first4=Milan|last5=Gajić|first5=Tamara|date=13 March 2017|title=Modelling of carrying capacity in National Park - Fruška Gora (Serbia) case study|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/geo.2017.9.issue-1/issue-files/geo.2017.9.issue-1.xml|journal=Open Geosciences|volume=9|issue=1|pages=61–72|doi=10.1515/geo-2017-0005|issn=2391-5447|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). It also involves integrating tourism to match current economic and growth policies so as to mitigate some of the negative economic and social [[impacts of tourism|impacts]] of '[[mass tourism]]'. Murphy (1985) advocates the use of an 'ecological approach', to consider both 'plants' and 'people' when implementing the sustainable tourism development process. This is in contrast to the '[[boosterism]]' and '[[economic]]' approaches to tourism planning, neither of which consider the detrimental ecological or sociological impacts of tourism development to a destination.

However, Butler questions the exposition of the term 'sustainable' in the context of tourism, citing its ambiguity and stating that "the emerging sustainable development philosophy of the 1990s can be viewed as an extension of the broader realization that a preoccupation with economic growth without regard to its social and environmental consequences is self-defeating in the long term." Thus 'sustainable tourism development' is seldom considered as an autonomous function of economic regeneration as separate from general economic growth.

===Ecotourism===
{{Main|Ecotourism}}
Ecotourism, also known as ecological tourism, is responsible travel to fragile, pristine, and usually protected areas that strives to be low-impact and (often) small-scale. It helps educate the traveler; provides funds for conservation; directly benefits the economic development and political empowerment of local communities; and fosters respect for different cultures and for human rights.''Take only memories and leave only footprints'' is a very common slogan in protected areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pinterest.com/marymo393/take-only-memories-leave-only-footprints-chief-sea/|title=Morgan Gamble|work=Pinterest|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourist destinations are shifting to low carbon emissions following the trend of visitors more focused in being environmentally responsible adopting a sustainable behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Entrepreneuring Sustainable Tourism, [[Jack Soifer]] Editor, Lisboa, 2008, {{ISBN|978-989-95976-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movie tourism===
The movie tourism is a form of tourism for those who visit the film and television locations, ie the places used for filming a film or a television series. In addition to organized tours (and not) to film locations lately has widened the tendency to a type of tourism, linked to the cinema, which relates to events, conventions and more like the case of the [[Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico]].

===Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico===
The Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico is an artistic costume movement originally born as a journalistic column on various online and paper publications officially in 2012 (with a genesis formed in the previous decade) but, in the following years, it has become a real costume fashion popularized in sites, associations, institutions, municipal administrations, political parties, movements and television listings all over the world. It also includes Museums and Sports Groups linked to its brand. The purpose of the work is varied: from the redevelopment of territorial areas thanks to the artistic interest raised to be film and fiction locations ([[Movie tourism]]) to promote events linked to the Cinema as film anniversaries, festivals, parties to theme (Toga Party, Monster Party, Cosplay Party, Hollywood Party, Pajamas Party, etc ...), manifestations born in films or that the cinema has helped to divulge (though already existing) as, for example, the Demolition Derby, village festivals disseminated by the Cinema (such as those appearing in the [[Mondo Cane]] film series, etc ...). We wanted to differentiate from Movie Tourism  (a fashion that has existed for several decades) to be more varied and not limited to tourism (that is a part of the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico).
In the mid-2000s, the student of video advertising and journalistic communications at the [[Turin]] branch of the Fellini Institute [[Davide Lingua]] (called Dave Lingua), obsessed with customary phenomena, has in mind to create a totally new object to redevelop areas territories hit by the crisis but fun and that leads to fashion accessible to all. This is the genesis for the creation of the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico. A few years later (between 2010, the beginning of the collaboration, and 2012) creates with this name a column (which initially deals with Cine tourism, Cinema Museums and Costume Party with a cinematic theme) within the site (in that period related to the homonymous paper magazine) of the Milan group [[Mondadori]] [[filmtv.it]] which soon became the most popular of the magazine with a myriad of collaborators. In the following period the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico appears as a column in various newspapers and magazines (the Netweek group, La Voce, is mentioned in [[La Stampa]] and many other newspapers) and officially appears as a cultural movement that gives full freedom to all to join simply using the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico (respecting however the topics of interest of the movement) coming to create totally independent sections (but always within legally registered bodies or associations), with their own statutes and directives but with only provided that the official founder (helped at the beginning by the first members) Davide Lingua is recognized as Permanent Director for life (in fact director and not president because he wants to underline the journalistic origin of the project).

From its birth until today the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico is a worldwide journalistic column, television broadcasting, has sections in many associations, institutions that collaborate with municipal administrations, has dealt with the official celebrations of film shooting anniversaries (for example [[Salasco]] of the film [[Bitter Rice]]), appears in the credits of many films for the collaboration given, organizes communication courses, cultural and sporting events, etc ...

===Volunteer tourism===

Volunteer tourism (or voluntourism) is growing as a largely Western phenomenon, with volunteers travelling to aid those less fortunate than themselves in order to counter global inequalities. Wearing (2001) defines volunteer tourism as applying “to those tourists who, for various reasons, volunteer in an organised way to undertake holidays that might involve aiding or alleviating the material poverty of some groups in society”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Volunteer Tourism: Experiences That Make a Difference|publisher=CABI}}&lt;/ref&gt; VSO was founded in the UK in 1958 and the US Peace Corps was subsequently founded in 1960. These were the first large scale voluntary sending organisations, initially arising to modernise less economically developed countries, which it was hoped would curb the influence of communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butcher|first=J|last2=Smith|first2=P|date=2010|title=‘Making a difference’: Volunteer tourism and development|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02508281.2010.11081616|journal=Tourism Recreation Research|volume=35|pages=27–36|doi=10.1080/02508281.2010.11081616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of tourism is largely praised for its more sustainable approach to travel, with tourists attempting to assimilate into local cultures, and avoiding the criticisms of consumptive and exploitative mass tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Terry|first=W|date=2014|title=Solving labor problems and building capacity unsustainable agriculture through volunteer tourism|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160738314001091|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=49|pages=94–107|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2014.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, increasingly voluntourism is being criticised by scholars who suggest it may have negative effects as it begins to undermine local labour, and force unwilling host communities to adopt Western initiatives,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guttentag|first=D|date=2009|title=The possible negative impacts of volunteer tourism|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jtr.727/full|journal=International Journal of Tourism Research|volume=11|issue=6|pages=537–51|doi=10.1002/jtr.727}}&lt;/ref&gt; while host communities without a strong heritage fail to retain volunteers who become dissatisfied with experiences and volunteer shortages persist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curran|first=Ross|last2=Taheri|first2=Babak|last3=MacIntosh|first3=Robert|last4=O'Gorman|first4=Kevin|date=2016|title=Nonprofit Brand Heritage: Its Ability to Influence Volunteer Retention, Engagement, and Satisfaction|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0899764016633532|journal=Nonprofit and Volutary Sector Quarterly|volume=45|issue=6|pages=1234–57|doi=10.1177/0899764016633532}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly organisations such as VSO have been concerned with community-centric volunteer programmes where power to control the future of the community is in the hands of local people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Jamie|last2=Curran|first2=Ross|last3=O'Gorman|first3=Kevin|date=2017|title=A modern day panopticon: Using power and control theory to manage volunteer tourists in Bolivia|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221197361730003X|journal=Tourism Management Perspectives|volume=22|pages=34–43|doi=10.1016/j.tmp.2017.01.003|hdl=10373/2606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pro-poor tourism===
[[File:Community Tourism (Riven No 2).webm|thumb| Community tourism in Sierra Leone [[b:Development Cooperation Handbook/Stories/Community Tourism|→ The story of a community in Sierra Leone trying to manage tourism in a responsible manner]]   [[File:Film-Camera.png|17px]]   [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL32A3F6F949A3F26D Playlist] ]]
Pro-poor tourism, which seeks to help the poorest people in developing countries, has been receiving increasing attention by those involved in development; the issue has been addressed through small-scale projects in local communities and through attempts by Ministries of Tourism to attract large numbers of tourists. Research by the [[Overseas Development Institute]] suggests that neither is the best way to encourage tourists' money to reach the poorest as only 25% or less (far less in some cases) ever reaches the poor; successful examples of money reaching the poor include mountain-climbing in [[Tanzania]] and cultural tourism in [[Luang Prabang]], [[Laos]].&lt;ref name="odi.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2675&amp;title=value-chains-tourism-poverty-reduction |title=Value chain analysis and poverty reduction at scale  |author=Jonathan Mitchel |year=2009 |publisher=Overseas Development Institute |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the possibility of pro-poor tourism principles being adopted in centre sites of regeneration in the developed world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=Richard|last2=Curran|first2=Ross|last3=O'Gorman|first3=Kevin D.|date=1 September 2013|title=Pro-Poor Tourism in a First World Urban Setting: Case Study of Glasgow Govan|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jtr.1888/abstract|journal=International Journal of Tourism Research|language=en|volume=15|issue=5|pages=443–57|doi=10.1002/jtr.1888|issn=1522-1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recession tourism===
Recession tourism is a travel trend which evolved by way of the world economic crisis. Recession tourism is defined by low-cost and high-value experiences taking place of once-popular generic retreats. Various recession tourism hotspots have seen business boom during the recession thanks to comparatively low costs of living and a slow world job market suggesting travelers are elongating trips where their money travels further. This concept is not widely used in tourism research. It is related to the short-lived phenomenon that is more widely known as [[staycation]].

===Medical tourism===
{{Main|Medical tourism}}
When there is a significant price difference between countries for a given medical procedure, particularly in [[Southeast Asia]], [[India]], [[Eastern Europe]], [[Cuba]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/world/americas/americans-may-see-appeal-of-medical-tourism-in-cuba.html|title=Americans May See Appeal of Medical Tourism in Cuba|last=Neuman|first=William|date=17 February 2015|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.deloitte.com/ca/en/pages/life-sciences-and-healthcare/articles/evolving-medical-tourism-in-canada.html|title=Evolving medical tourism in Canada {{!}} Deloitte Canada|website=Deloitte Canada|access-date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where there are different regulatory regimes, in relation to particular medical procedures (e.g. [[dentistry]]), traveling to take advantage of the price or regulatory differences is often referred to as "medical tourism".

===Educational tourism===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
Educational tourism is developed because of the growing popularity of teaching and learning of knowledge and the enhancing of technical competency outside of classroom environment. In educational tourism, the main focus of the tour or leisure activity includes visiting another country to learn about the culture, study tours, or to work and apply skills learned inside the classroom in a different environment, such as in the International Practicum Training Program.

=== Event tourism ===
This type of tourism is focused tourists coming into a region to either participate in an event  or to see an organized event put on by the city/region.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/760291882|title=Tourism management : an introduction|last=Clare.|first=Inkson,|date=2012|publisher=SAGE|others=Minnaert, Lynn.|isbn=9781848608696|location=Los Angeles|oclc=760291882}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of tourism can also fall under [[sustainable tourism]] as well and companies that create a [[Sustainable event management|sustainable event]] to attend open up a chance to not only the consumer but their workers to learn and develop from the experience. Creating a sustainable atmosphere it creates a chance to inform and encourage sustainable practices. An example of event tourism would be the music festival [[South by Southwest]] that is hosted in [[Austin, Texas]] annually. This is a perfect example because very year people from all over the world flock to this one city for one week to sit in on technology talks and see a whole city of bands perform. These people are being drawn here to experience something that they are not able to experience in their hometown which is exactly what event tourism is about.

===Creative tourism===
[[File:FF of Hartwell welcomes Indonesians.jpg|thumb|left|[[Friendship Force International|Friendship Force]] visitors from Indonesia meet their hosts in [[Hartwell, Georgia]], USA.]]
Creative tourism has existed as a form of [[cultural tourism]], since the early beginnings of tourism itself. Its European roots date back to the time of the [[Grand Tour]], which saw the sons of aristocratic families traveling for the purpose of mostly interactive, educational experiences. More recently, creative tourism has been given its own name by Crispin Raymond and Greg Richards,&lt;ref name="ct"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wurzburger|first=Rebecca|title=Creative Tourism: A Global Conversation: How to Provide Unique Creative Experiences for Travelers Worldwide: As Presented at the 2008 Santa Fe &amp; UNESCO International Conference on Creative Tourism in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA|publisher=Sunstone Press|location=Santa Fe|year=2009|isbn=978-0-86534-724-3|oclc=370387178|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; who as members of the Association for Tourism and Leisure Education (ATLAS), have directed a number of projects for the [[European Commission]], including cultural and crafts tourism, known as [[sustainable tourism]]. They have defined "creative tourism" as tourism related to the active participation of travellers in the [[culture]] of the host community, through interactive workshops and informal learning experiences.&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt;

Meanwhile, the concept of creative tourism has been picked up by high-profile organizations such as [[UNESCO]], who through the [[Creative Cities Network]], have endorsed creative tourism as an engaged, [[authenticity (reenactment)|authentic]] experience that promotes an active understanding of the specific cultural features of a [[Location (geography)|place]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

[[File:Greg Richards - Conferencia Turismo Creativo.jpg|thumb|A tourism conference underway.]]
More recently, creative tourism has gained popularity as a form of cultural tourism, drawing on active participation by travelers in the culture of the host communities they visit. Several countries offer examples of this type of tourism development, including the United Kingdom, Austria, France, the Bahamas, Jamaica, Spain, Italy, New Zealand and South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legco.gov.hk/research-publications/english/essentials-1617ise03-creative-tourism.htm|title=Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region - Creative tourism|last=Lau|first=Samantha|date=14 November 2016|website=Legislative Council of Hong Kong|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Experiential tourism===
[[Experiential travel]] (or "immersion travel") is one of the major market trends in the modern tourism industry. It is an approach to travelling which focuses on experiencing a country, city or particular place by connecting to its [[history]], people, food and [[culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/08/nyregion/your-home-the-new-frontier-for-tourists-in-new-york-city.html|title=Your Home, the New Frontier for Tourists in New York City|first=Ginia|last=Bellafante|date=6 July 2012|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term “Experiential travel” is already mentioned in publications from 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=o_QJAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22experiential+travel%22&amp;dq=%22experiential+travel%22|title=Insights in Strategic Retail Management|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; – however it was discovered as a meaningful market trend much later.

===Dark tourism===
{{Main|Dark tourism}}
[[File:Poland - Czermna - Chapel of Skulls - interior 06.jpg|thumb|The [[Skull Chapel, Czermna|Skull Chapel]] in south-western [[Poland]] is an example of [[dark tourism]]. Its interior walls, ceiling and foundations are adorned by human remains. It is the only such monument in Poland, and one of six in [[Europe]].]]
One emerging area of special interest has been identified by Lennon and Foley (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/turnsofphrase/tp-dar2.htm|title=Dark Tourism|last=Quinion|first=Michael|date=26 November 2005|work=World Wide Words|accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lennon|first1=J.

This type of tourism involves visits to "dark" sites, such as battlegrounds, scenes of horrific crimes or acts of [[genocide]], for example [[Internment|concentration camps]]. Its origins are rooted in fairgrounds and medieval fairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=Chris|title=Tourism: Principles and Practice|publisher=[[Pearson Education]]|location=Harlow|year=2005|edition= 3rd|isbn=978-0-273-68406-0|oclc=466952897|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip Stone]] argues that dark tourism is a way of imagining one's own death through the real death of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stone|first=Philip R.|date=1 July 2012|title=Dark tourism and significant other death: Towards a Model of Mortality Mediation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160738312000564|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=39|issue=3|pages=1565–87|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2012.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erik H Cohen]] introduces the term "[[populo sites]]" to evidence the educational character of dark tourism. Populo sites transmit the story of victimized people to visitors. Based on a study at [[Yad Vashem]], the Shoah (Holocaust) memorial museum in Jerusalem, a new term—''in populo''—is proposed to describe dark tourism sites at a spiritual and population center of the people to whom a tragedy befell. Learning about the Shoah in Jerusalem offers an encounter with the subject which is different from visits to sites in Europe, but equally authentic. It is argued that a dichotomy between "authentic" sites at the location of a tragedy and "created" sites elsewhere is insufficient. Participants' evaluations of seminars for European teachers at Yad Vashem indicate that the location is an important aspect of a meaningful encounter with the subject. Implications for other cases of dark tourism at ''in populo'' locations are discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Erik H.|date=1 January 2011|title=Educational dark tourism at an in populo site: The Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160738310001040|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=38|issue=1|pages=193–209|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2010.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this vein, [[Peter Tarlow]] defines dark tourism as the tendency to visit the scenes of tragedies or historically noteworthy deaths, which continue to impact our lives. This issue cannot be understood without the figure of trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ciW6GbT5jNEC|title=Niche Tourism|last=Novelli|first=Marina|date=1 June 2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1136376177|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social tourism===
Social tourism is making tourism available to poor people who otherwise could not afford to travel for their education or recreation. It includes [[youth hostels]] and low-priced holiday accommodation run by church and [[voluntary organisation]]s, [[trade unions]], or in Communist times [[combine (enterprise)|publicly owned enterprises]]. In May 1959, at the second Congress of Social Tourism in Austria, [[Walter Hunziker#Social tourism|Walter Hunziker]] proposed the following definition: "Social tourism is a type of tourism practiced by low income groups, and which is rendered possible and facilitated by entirely separate and therefore easily recognizable services".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/261135450|title=Tourism : principles, practices, philosophies|last=R.|first=Goeldner, Charles|date=2009|publisher=John Wiley|others=Ritchie, J.

===Doom tourism===
[[File:Perito Moreno Glacier Patagonia Argentina Luca Galuzzi 2005.JPG|thumb|[[Perito Moreno Glacier]], [[Patagonia]], [[Argentina]].]]

Also known as "Tourism of Doom," or "Last Chance Tourism" this emerging trend involves traveling to places that are environmentally or otherwise threatened (such as the ice caps of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], the melting glaciers of [[Patagonia]], or the coral of the [[Great Barrier Reef]]) before it is too late. Identified by travel trade magazine [[Travel Age West]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shapiro |first=Kenneth |url=http://www.travelagewest.com/Travel-News/Viewpoint/The-Tourism-of-Doom/ |title=TravelAge West – TravelAge West |publisher=Travelagewest.com |date=11 May 2007 |accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; editor-in-chief Kenneth Shapiro in 2007 and later explored in ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Salkin |first=Allen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/16/world/americas/16iht-tourism.1.8762449.html |title='Tourism of doom' on rise|publisher=Nytimes.com |date=16 December 2007 |accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; this type of tourism is believed to be on the rise. Some see the trend as related to [[sustainable tourism]] or [[ecotourism]] due to the fact that a number of these tourist destinations are considered threatened by environmental factors such as global warming, overpopulation or climate change. Others worry that travel to many of these threatened locations increases an individual’s [[carbon footprint]] and only hastens problems threatened locations are already facing.&lt;ref&gt;Lemelin, H., Dawson, J., &amp; Stewart, E.

===Religious tourism===
{{Main|Religious tourism}}
[[File:Saint Peter's Basilica facade, Rome, Italy.jpg|thumb|[[St. Peter's Basilica]] in [[Vatican City]], the papal enclave within the Italian city of Rome, is one of the largest religious tourism sites in the world.]]
Religious tourism, in particular religious travel, is used to strengthen faith and show devotion both of which are central tenets of many major religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jafari|first=Jafar|last2=Scott|first2=Noel|date=1 January 2014|title=Muslim world and its tourisms|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160738313001199|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=44|pages=1–19|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2013.08.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious tourists seek destinations whose image encourages them to believe that they can strengthen the religious elements of their self-identity in a positive manner. Given this, the perceived image of a destination may be positively influenced by whether it conforms to the requirements of their religious self-identity or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gannon|first=Martin Joseph|last2=Baxter|first2=Ian W.

==Growth==
The [[World Tourism Organization]] (UNWTO) forecasts that international tourism will continue growing at the average annual rate of 4%.&lt;ref name="predict"&gt;{{cite web| year = 2004| url = http://www.world-tourism.org/market_research/facts/market_trends.htm| title = Long-term Prospects: Tourism 2020 Vision| publisher = World Tourism| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040619001112/http://www.world-tourism.org/market_research/facts/market_trends.htm| archivedate = 19 June 2004| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of [[electronic commerce|e-commerce]], tourism products have become one of the most traded items on the internet. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Tourism products and services have been made available through intermediaries, although tourism providers (hotels, airlines, etc.), including small-scale operators, can sell their services directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lu|first=Jie|last2=Lu|first2=Zi|date=1 July 2004|title=Development, Distribution and Evaluation of Online Tourism Services in China|journal=Electronic Commerce Research|language=en|volume=4|issue=3|pages=221–39|doi=10.1023/B:ELEC.0000027981.81945.2a|issn=1389-5753}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karanasios|first=Stan|last2=Burgess|first2=Stephen|date=1 March 2008|title=Tourism and internet adoption: a developing world perspective|journal=International Journal of Tourism Research|language=en|volume=10|issue=2|pages=169–82|doi=10.1002/jtr.649|issn=1522-1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has put pressure on intermediaries from both on-line and traditional shops.

It has been suggested there is a strong correlation between tourism expenditure per capita and the degree to which countries play in the global context.&lt;ref name="correl"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2007| url = http://global-culture.org/blog/2007/01/27/airports-tourists/ | title =airports &amp; tourists | publisher = Global Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only as a result of the important economic contribution of the tourism industry, but also as an indicator of the degree of confidence with which global citizens leverage the resources of the globe for the benefit of their [[Community-based economics|local economies]]. This is why any projections of growth in tourism may serve as an indication of the relative influence that each country will exercise in the future.

===Space tourism===
{{Main|Space tourism}}

There has been a limited amount of orbital [[space tourism]], with only the [[Russian Space Agency]] providing transport to date. A 2010 report into space tourism anticipated that it could become a billion-dollar market by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Economic Impact of Commercial Space Transportation on the U. S Economy in 2009|url=http://www.faa.gov/news/updates/media/Economic%20Impact%20Study%20September%202010_20101026_PS.pdf|accessdate=5 May 2012|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration|date=September 2010|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports tourism===
{{Main|Sports tourism}}

{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Since the late 1980s, [[sports tourism]] has become increasingly popular. Events such as rugby, Olympics, Commonwealth games, Asian Games and football World Cups have enabled specialist travel companies to gain official ticket allocation and then sell them in packages that include flights, hotels and excursions.

===Latest trends===
As a result of the [[late-2000s recession]], international arrivals suffered a strong slowdown beginning in June 2008. Growth from 2007 to 2008 was only 3.7% during the first eight months of 2008. This slowdown on international tourism demand was also reflected in the air transport industry, with a negative growth in September 2008 and a 3.3% growth in passenger traffic through September. The hotel industry also reported a slowdown, with room occupancy declining. In 2009 worldwide tourism arrivals decreased by 3.8%.&lt;ref name="UNWTO"&gt;{{cite web|last=UNWTO|title=UNWTO Tourism Highlights|url=http://mkt.unwto.org/sites/all/files/docpdf/unwtohighlights11enhr_1.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=UNWTO|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the first quarter of 2009, real travel demand in the United States had fallen 6% over six quarters. While this is considerably milder than what occurred after the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]], the decline was at twice the rate as real GDP has fallen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/economics/commerce/tourism-impacts-world-economic-crisis-north-america/ | title=Impacts of the World Recession and Economic Crisis on Tourism: North America}} JournalistsResource.org. Retrieved 22 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ritchie | first1 = J. R. Brent | last2 = Amaya Molinar | first2 = Carlos Mario | last3 = Frechtling | first3 = Douglas C. | year = 2011 | title = Impacts of the World Recession and Economic Crisis on Tourism: North America | journal = Journal of Travel Research | volume = 49 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–15 | doi = 10.1177/0047287509353193 | url = http://jtr.sagepub.com/content/49/1/5.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, evidence suggests that tourism as a global phenomenon shows no signs of substantially abating in the long term. It has been suggested that travel is necessary in order to maintain relationships, as social life is increasingly networked and conducted at a distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Urry|first=John|title=Social Networks, Travel and Talk|journal=British Journal of Sociology|year=2003|volume=54|issue=2|pages=155–75|doi=10.1080/0007131032000080186|pmid=12945865}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many people vacations and travel are increasingly being viewed as a necessity rather than a luxury, and this is reflected in tourist numbers recovering some 6.6% globally over 2009, with growth up to 8% in emerging economies.&lt;ref name="UNWTO"/&gt;
