== History ==
Abonoteichos was a town on the coast of [[Paphlagonia]], memorable as the birthplace of the impostor [[Alexander of Abonoteichus|Alexander]], founder of the cult of [[Glycon]], of whom [[Lucian]] has left us an amusing account in the treatise bearing his name.&lt;ref name="DGRG"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Smith  | first = William  | author-link = William Smith (lexicographer)  | contribution = Abonoteichos  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 5  | publisher = Walton &amp; Maberly  | place = London  | year = 1857  | contribution-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_sYPAAAAYAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Lucian, Alexander petitioned the [[Roman emperor]] (probably [[Antoninus Pius]]) that the name of his native place should be changed from Abonoteichos to '''Ionopolis'''; and whether the emperor granted the request or not, we know that the town was called Ionopolis in later times.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucian]], ''Alex'' § 58&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Not only does this name occur in [[Marcian of Heraclea]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcian of Heraclea]], ''Peripl.'' p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hierocles (author of Synecdemus)|Hierocles]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Synecdemus]], p. 696&lt;/ref&gt; but on coins of the time of Antoninus and [[Lucius Verus]] we find the legend Ionopoliton ({{lang|grc|Ἰωνοπολιτῶν}}, ''Ionopoliton''), as well as Abonoteichiton ({{lang|grc|Ἀβωνοτειχιτῶν}}, ''Avonotichiton''). The modern Turkish name [[İnebolu]] is evidently only a corruption of Ionopolis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], p. 545&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arrian]], ''[[Periplus Ponti Euxini]]'' p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ptol. v. 4 § 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], ''s. v.'' {{lang|grc|Ἀβώνου τείχος}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the site of a 2nd-century AD temple of [[Apollo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Ionopolis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecclesiastical history of Ionopolis ==
It was important enough in the [[Roman province]] of [[Paphlagonia]] to become a [[suffragan]] bishopric of the Metropolitan of its capital [[Gangra]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Vivien de Saint-Martin]] , Historical and geographical description of Asia Minor, including ancient times, the Middle Ages and modern times (A. Bertrand, 1845)  p436&lt;/ref&gt; but faded later.  [[Michel Le Quien|Michael LeQuien]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Le Quien|Le Quien]], Oriens Christ., I, 555&lt;/ref&gt; mentions eight bishops between 325 and 878 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicity.com/encyclopedia/i/ionopolis.html  CUINET, La Turquie d'Asie, IV (Paris, 1894), p466-69].&lt;/ref&gt;and Ionopolis is mentioned in the later “[[Notitiae episcopatuum]].” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08093a.htm  The Catholic Encyclopedia (1908].&lt;/ref&gt;

[https://books.google.com/books?id=pOg35D6c69gC&amp;pg=PA344 344]–&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is thought to mean ''"gift [[Spring (hydrology)|spring]]"''.&lt;ref name="Britain)1837"&gt;Royal Geographical Society (Great Britain), 1837, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=oU89AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA98 98]–&lt;/ref&gt; There is a remarkably cold spring in the area.&lt;ref name="Harvey"&gt;Harvey, 1861, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XPPzxyvJzLMC&amp;pg=PA145 145]ff&lt;/ref&gt;

The village was suggested by [[Charles William Meredith van de Velde]] to be the ancient site of [[Beth-Anath]] or [[Anatha]] mentioned in the [[Bible]] [[Book of Joshua]] ({{Bibleverse||Joshua|19:38|HE}}) and the [[Book of Judges]] ({{Bibleverse||Judges|1:33|HE}}) as a land given to [[Naphtali]]. Historical geographer [[Ze'ev Safrai]], disputing, identifies the biblical Beth-Anath with [[Bi'ina]] in the [[Beit HaKerem Valley]] of Upper Galilee.&lt;ref&gt;Safrai, 1985, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Safrai, 1976, pp. 18–34&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eusebius]] in his work [[Eusebius' Onomasticon|Onomasticon]], placed it {{convert|9|mi|km}} from [[Dora, Lebanon|Dora]] (Tanturah), however this falls outside the territory of Naphtali.&lt;ref name="Kitto2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomson1859"&gt;Thomson, 1859, p. [https://archive.org/stream/landandbookorbi05thomgoog#page/n325/mode/1up   315]&lt;/ref&gt; Beth-Anath has been translated to mean ''"temple of [[Anat]]"'', a [[Canaanite religion|Canaanite]] goddess linked to a [[Sumer]]ian predecessor called [[Ninhursag]].&lt;ref name="Naʼaman2005"&gt;Naʼaman, 2005, pp.[https://books.google.com/books?id=HmTOoQmf23AC&amp;pg=PA248 248]ff&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman temple==
Recent [[epigraphic]] surveys have confirmed the ruins of a [[Roman temple]] and cult site in the village that are included in a group of [[Temples of Mount Hermon]].&lt;ref name="Kaizer2008"&gt;Kaizer, 2012, p.

The '''Akali movement''' {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|k|ɑː|l|i}}, also called the '''Gurdwara Reform Movement''', was a campaign to bring reform in the [[gurdwara]]s (the [[Sikhism|Sikh]] places of worship) in India during the early 1920s. The movement led to the introduction of the Sikh Gurdwara Bill in 1925, which placed all the historical Sikh shrines in India under the control of [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]] (SGPC).

The Akalis also participated in the [[Indian independence movement]] against the British Government, and supported the [[non-cooperation movement]] against them.&lt;ref name="RaghbirSingh1997"&gt;{{cite book | author=Raghbir Singh | title=Akali movement, 1926-1947 | year=1997 | publisher = Omsons | isbn = 978-81-7117-163-7 | page = 16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Initial agitations ==

The term Akali derives from the word [[Akal]] ("timeless" or "immortal") used in the Sikh scriptures. By the early 20th century, a number of Sikh gurdwaras in British India were under the control of the [[Udasi]] ''[[mahant]]''s (clergymen) or managers appointed by the Governors.&lt;ref name="HSSingha2000"&gt;{{cite book | author = H. S Singha|title=The encyclopedia of Sikhism|year=2000|publisher=Hemkunt Press|isbn=978-81-7010-301-1|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main aim of the Akali movement was to have the Sikh gurdwaras released from the control of the traditional clergy, which had become powerful and ritualized.&lt;ref name="Rajit2003"&gt;{{cite book | author=Rajit K. Mazumder | title=The Indian army and the making of Punjab | year=2003 | publisher = Orient Blackswan | isbn=978-81-7824-059-6 | pages=213–218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Akali movement was started in 1920 by the [[Singh Sabha Movement|Singh Sabha]]'s political wing (later known as Akali Dal). The [[jatha]]s (volunteer groups) led by [[Kartar Singh Jhabbar]] played a major role in the movement. The first shrine chosen for reform was the Babe di Ber gurdwara in [[Sialkot]]. It was under the control of the widow of the [[mahant]] Harnam Singh. She initially resisted the takeover of the gurdwara by the Akalis, as it was her only source of income, but relented after she was offered a pension.&lt;ref name="Mohinder1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohinder Singh|title=The Akali struggle: a retrospect (Volume 1) |year=1988|publisher=Atlantic | page = 20 | oclc = 59911558 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The control of the gurdwara was then transferred to an elected committee headed by [[Baba Kharak Singh]].

The next major target of the Akalis was the [[Harmandir Sahib]] (Golden Temple), the holiest shrine of the Sikhs. The priest of the Golden Temple had refused to allow [[Indian caste system|low-caste]] [[Hindu]] converts to offer prayers in the shrine.&lt;ref name="Harajindara1995"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harajindara Singha Dilagira|author2=A. T. Kerr|title=Akal Takht Sahib|year=1995|publisher=Sikh Educational Trust and Sikh University Centre, Denmark|isbn=978-0-9695964-1-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kartar Singh Jhabbar walked to the [[Akal Takht]] in the temple premises, urging the Sikhs to give up the caste-based restrictions and reform the gurdwaras. On 28 June 1920, the Golden Temple came under the control of an elected committee called [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]] (SGPC).{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=January 2016}}

[[File:PanjaSahibExterior1.JPG|thumb|left|[[Gurdwara Panja Sahib]] at Hasan Abdal]]
Next, the Akalis headed to [[Hasan Abdal]], where [[Gurdwara Panja Sahib]] was under the control of Mahant Mitha Singh. Singh allowed sale of cigarettes inside the gurdwara, and was disliked by the Sikhs. The Akalis led by Karatar Singh Jhabbar took control of the gurdwara on 20 November 1920. However, the local Hindus, who also frequented the gurdwara for worship, opposed this takeover. Around 5-6 thousand of them surrounded the gurdwara on the night of the Akali takeover, but were dispersed by the police. The next day, around 200-300 Hindu women squatted at the Gurdwara. Nevertheless, the gurdwara was later successfully brought under the authority of the SGPC.&lt;ref name="Tan2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tai Yong Tan|title=The garrison state: the military, government and society in colonial Punjab 1849-1947|year=2005|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-0-7619-3336-6|page=1935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Akalis then took control of the Gurdwara Sacha Sauda at Chuhar Kana (in present-day Pakistan). They then turned their attention to the [[Gurdwara Sri Tarn Taran Sahib]], whose clergymen were accused of allowing dancing girls, smoking and drinking inside the shrine's premises. The clergymen were also accused of spreading the teachings of [[Arya Samaj]], a Hindu reform movement some of whose leaders had criticized Sikhism. The Akalis, led by Kartar Singh, arrived at the gurdwara, performed ''[[ardas]]'' (Sikh prayer) and declared that the gurdwara was now under their control. The clergymen attacked the Akalis with crude bombs and bricks while the latter were sleeping.&lt;ref name="Shashi1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=S. S. Shashi|title=Encyclopaedia Indica: India, Pakistan, Bangladesh|year=1996|publisher=Anmol Publications|isbn=978-81-7041-859-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next day, the Sikhs from the surrounding villages took control of the Gurdwara. Following this, the Akalis led by Kartar Singh then took control of five more gurdwaras, including the Gurdwara Guru ka Bagh near [[Amritsar]].

A section of Akalis rejected the peaceful methods adopted by SGPC, and formed the breakaway [[Babbar Akali movement]] to seize the control of the gurdwaras using violent methods.&lt;ref name="Mukherjee2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mukherjee|first=Mridula|title=Peasants in India's non-violent revolution: practice and theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2AON_2SJI0C&amp;pg=PA35|accessdate=17 December 2011|date=2004-09-22|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-0-7619-9686-6|pages=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nankana massacre ==
[[File:Nankana Sahib.JPG|thumb|right|[[Gurdwara Janam Asthan]] at Nankana Sahib]]
{{main|Nankana massacre}}

In 1921, the Akalis turned their focus to the gurdwara at [[Nankana Sahib]], the birthplace of the first Sikh Guru [[Nanak]]. The gurdwara was under the control of a mahant called Narain Das, who was accused of allowing immoral activities in the temple premises. One of the clergymen at the gurdwara had allegedly raped the 13-year-old daughter of a Hindu devotee from [[Sindh]].&lt;ref name="Singh1988"&gt;{{cite book | author=Mohinder Singh | title=The Akali struggle: a retrospect | year=1988|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Calcutta2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sikh Cultural Centre, Calcutta|title=The Sikh review|year=2005|publisher=Sikh Cultural Centre.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Akalis tried to take over the gurdwara on 20 February 1921, the [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] guards of the Mahant attacked them, killing 130 people in what came to be known as the [[Nankana massacre]].&lt;ref name="Loehlin1958"&gt;{{cite book|author=Clinton Herbert Loehlin|title=The Sikhs and their scriptures|year=1958|publisher=Lucknow Pub. House | oclc = 5452996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and the Governor of the Punjab province visited the site, accompanied by a number of Sikh and Hindu leaders. Gandhi sympathized with the Sikhs and said that the Mahant had "out-Dyered [[Reginald Dyer|Dyer]]."&lt;ref name="Harold2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Harold G. Coward |authorlink=Harold Coward |title=Indian critiques of Gandhi|year=2003|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-5910-2|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Government, finding itself under immense political pressure, agreed to transfer the control of the gurdwara to the Akalis on 3 March 1921. Narain Das and 26 of his henchmen were arrested.&lt;ref name="HarnikDeol2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harnik Deol | title=Religion and nationalism in India: the case of the Punjab | year=2000 | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-0-415-20108-7 | page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gurdwara Bill ==

Amid the ongoing agitations, the SGPC urged the British Government to release the protestors and legalize its control of the gurdwaras. On 1 May 1921, the influential Sikh leaders passed a resolution for launching a [[passive resistance]] movement. The next day, a Sikh-Hindu conference was organized during the Punjab Congress Provincial Congress at [[Rawalpindi]]. The [[Shankaracharya|Jagat Guru Shankaracharya]] urged the Hindus to join the Sikhs in the struggle for taking control of the gurdwaras from mahants with personal interests.&lt;ref name="SCMittal1977"&gt;{{cite book|title=Freedom Movement in Punjab | author = S C Mittal | publisher = Concept | year = 1977 | pages=171–179 | oclc = 609926003}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 May, a number of Akali ''jatha''s were asked to proceed to designated gurdwaras to take over their control.&lt;ref name="SCMittal1977"/&gt;

The Government meanwhile launched a "Gurdwara Bill" to facilitate the settlement of the gurdwara disputes. The Bill provided setting up a Board of Commissioners for the management of the gurdwaras. However, the SGPC objected to the Government's right to appoint the Board members, and the bill was postponed. In On 17 November 1922, the "Sikh Gurdwaras and Shrines Bill" was introduced in the [[Punjab Legislative Assembly]]. All the Sikh and the Hindu members opposed the bill, but it was passed by 41 votes to 31 votes.&lt;ref name="SCMittal1977"/&gt;

== Jaitu and Bhai Pheru agitations ==

In 1923, the Akalis decided to take over the Gurdwara Gangsar at [[Jaitu]] (or Jaito) in the [[Nabha State]]. The erstwhile Maharaja (ruler) of Nabha [[Ripudaman Singh]] had been sympathetic to the Akali and the Indian nationalist cause, but was deposed by the British Government.&lt;ref name="Surinder1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Surinder Singh Johar|title=Holy Sikh Shrines |year= 1998|publisher=M.D. Publications|isbn=978-81-7533-073-3|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the SGPC launched an agitation, its leaders and members were arrested on the charge of [[sedition]]. Subsequently, several marches were organized in support of the agitation. The protestors were arrested, beaten and shot at by the police at various instances.

The [[Indian National Congress]] declared its support for the Akali agitation in at the special Congress Session in Delhi.&lt;ref name="Nijjar1996"&gt;{{cite book | author=Bakhshish Singh Nijjar | title=History of the United Panjab | year = 1996|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist | isbn=978-81-7156-534-4 | page=130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Akalis were then joined by several non-Sikhs, including [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] (later the first Prime Minister of India) and [[Kasturiranga Santhanam]].&lt;ref name="SCMittal1977"/&gt; Nehru and others were arrested during one such march.&lt;ref name="Surinder1998"/&gt; Finally, the Government of Punjab relented and agreed to transfer the control of the gurdwara to the Akalis.

While the Jaitu agitation was on, the Akalis also sought the control of the gurdwara at [[Bhai Pheru]]. The gurdwara was controlled by Udasi mahants including Pala Ram, the brother of Narain Das (who was responsible for the Nankana massacre). The mahant agreed to transfer the control of the gurdwara to SGPC, after being offered a pension. However, in August 1923, when the Akalis decided to eject the Udasi tenants housed in the gurdwara premises, they faced considerable resistance. On 4 December 1923, a group of Akalis damaged a mahant's residence attached to the shrine. The police arrested 11 Akalis following a complaint.&lt;ref name="SCMittal1977"/&gt; In December, the Government recognized the SGPC as the manager of the gurdwara, but also ordered the Akalis to follow the legal process for ejecting the Udasi mahants out of the premises. On 1 January 1924, an Akali jatha forcibly took the possession of the property occupied by Pala Ram. Around 34 Akalis were arrested by the police for this action on the next day. In subsequent days, a number of Akali ''jatha''s staged demonstrations at the site. A total of 5,251 persons were arrested for the demonstrations, and 3,092 of these were sent to the prison.&lt;ref name="SCMittal1977"/&gt;

== Sikh Gurdwara Bill ==
{{main|Gurdwaras Act of 1925}}
The British Government considered the Akali movement to be a greater threat than [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s civil disobedience movement. A  1921 memorandum signed by D. Petrie, the Assistant Director of [[Criminal Investigation Department|CID]], Punjab states:&lt;ref name="Rajit2003"/&gt;

{{quote|Gandhi's propaganda makes its appeal mainly to the urban classes, which lack both the stamina and physical courage to oppose successfully even small bodies of police; the Akali campaign is essentially a rural movement, and its followers are men of fine physique with a national history of which the martial characteristics have been purposely kept alive both by Government and by the Sikhs themselves.|D. Petrie|Secret CID Memorandum on Recent Developments in Sikh Politics (11 August 1921)}}

In 1925, after further demands and protests from SGPC, a new "Sikh Gurdwara Bill" was introduced in the Punjab Legislative Assembly. It came into force on 1 November 1925, and awarded the control of all the historical shrines to SGPC. A tribunal was set up to judge the disputes, and all the Akali prisoners were released.&lt;ref name="SCMittal1977"/&gt;

By this time, an estimated 30,000 people had been arrested by the British Government; over 400 had been killed and another 2,000 had been injured during the movement.&lt;ref name="SCMittal1977"/&gt; The movement fueled the anti-British Government feeling among the Sikhs. It also led to an anti-Hindu sentiment among a section of Sikhs, who identified the pro-Udasi mahants such as Narain Das and their supporters with the Hindu community.&lt;ref name="SCMittal1977"/&gt;

'''Algard Wicca''' is a tradition, or [[Religious denomination|denomination]], in the [[neopagan|Neo-Pagan]] religion of [[Wicca]]. It was founded in the [[United States]] in 1972 by [[Mary Nesnick]], an initiate of both [[Gardnerian Wicca|Gardnerian]] and [[Alexandrian Wicca]], in an attempt to fuse the two traditions.&lt;ref name="Rabinovitch"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0806524065 |publisher=Citadel Press |location=[[New York City|New York]] |first=Shelley |last=Rabinovitch |author2=Lewis, James R |pages=5–6 |year=2004 |isbn=0-8065-2407-3 |oclc=59262630}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this fusion, it is categorised under the heading of [[British Traditional Wicca]], with its initiates being able to trace their lineage back to [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], the founder of modern-day Wicca.

==History==
One of the spiritual seekers who approached Nesnick in the early 1970s was [[Eddie Buczynski]], but she turned him down for initiation because he was homosexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bull of Heaven: The Mythic Life of Eddie Buczynski and the Rise of the New York Pagan |last=Lloyd |first=Michael G. |year=2012 |publisher=Asphodel Press |location=Hubbarston, MAS. |isbn=978-1938197048|pages=93 |ref=Llo12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anecdotes of Oyasama, the Foundress of Tenrikyo''' (稿本天理教教祖伝逸話篇 ''Kohon Tenrikyo Oyasama-den Itsuwa-hen'') is an [[anthology]] of [[anecdotes]] about [[Nakayama Miki]], the foundress of [[Tenrikyo]]. This text is one of the supplemental texts (準原典 ''jun-genten'') to the Tenrikyo scriptures, along with ''[[The Doctrine of Tenrikyo]]'' and ''[[The Life of Oyasama]]''.

''Anecdotes of Oyasama'' was first published in the original Japanese in January 26, 1976, commemorating the 90th Anniversary of Oyasama (i.e. the 90th year since adherents believe Nakayama Miki withdrew from physical life and became everliving). An English translation was published the following year, in May 26, 1977.

The preface of the first 1956 publication of ''[[The Life of Oyasama]]'' mentions that a collection of anecdotes on Nakayama Miki would be put together in the near future. The "Kōki Committee," a subset of Tenrikyo reverends and scholars led by theologian Ueda Yoshinaru, compiled the anecdotes. The anecdotes were originally published in four volumes, each containing 50 stories. The first volume was released in January 1974, the second in September 1974, the third in May 1975, and the fourth in October 1975. The anecdotes went through further editing for content and wording before being published in one set of 200 stories on January 26, 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Oyasato Institute for the Study of Religion (1997). Kōhon Tenrikyō Oyasama-den Itsuwa-hen [Anecdotes of Oyasama, the Foundress of Tenrikyo]. In ''Kaitei Tenrikyo jiten'' [Revised Tenrikyo Encyclopedia]. (pp. 324).

There are seven known [[Ring (finger)|ring]]s of the [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon period]] (9th or 10th century) bearing [[futhorc|runic]] inscriptions.

The most notable of these are the '''Bramham Moor Ring''', found in the 18th century, and the '''Kingmoor Ring''', found 1817, inscribed with a nearly identical [[runic magic|magical]] formula read as 
:''ærkriufltkriuriþonglæstæpontol''

A third ring, found before 1824 (perhaps identical with a ring found in 1773 at Linstock castle in Carlisle), has a magical inscription of a similar type,  ''ery.ri.uf.dol.yri.þol.wles.te.pote.nol.''

The remaining four rings have much shorter inscriptions.
* Wheatley Hill, Durham, found 1993, now in the British Museum. Late 8th century. Inscription: ''[h]ring ic hatt[æ]'', "I am called a ring".
* Coquet Island, Northumberland, found before 1866, now lost. Inscription: ''+ þis is -''  "this is…".
* Cramond, Edinburgh, found 1869-70, now in the National Museum of Scotland. 9th-10th century. Inscription: ''[.]ewor[.]el[.]u.''
* Thames Exchange, London, found 1989, now in the Museum of London. Inscription: ''[.]fuþni ine.''

==Bramham Moor Ring==
&lt;!-- nweds image --&gt;
The Bramham Moor Ring, dated to the ninth century, was found in [[Bramham cum Oglethorpe]], [[West Yorkshire]] in or before 1732 (now in the [[National Museum of Denmark|Danish National Museum]], no. 8545).  It is made from [[electrum]] (gold with [[niello]]), with a diameter of c. 29&amp;nbsp;mm. and weighs 40.22 g.
&lt;!-- needs an image --&gt;
The inscription reads&lt;ref name=Page1999/&gt;
:{{runic|᛭ᚫᚱᛦᚱᛁᚢᚠᛚᛏ᛭ᛦᚱᛁᚢᚱᛁᚦᚩᚾ᛭ᚷᛚᚫᛋᛏᚫᛈᚩᚾ͡ᛏᚩᚿ}} &lt;!--sic, the 1736 drawing has ærkriuiflt but Page and others transcribe ærkriuflt--&gt;
:''ærkriuflt | kriuriþon | glæstæpon͡tol''

Where ''k'' is the late [[Anglo-Saxon runes|Futhorc]] ''calc'' rune of the same shape as [[Younger Futhark]] ''[[ᛦ|Yr]]'' and the n͡t is written as a [[bindrune]].

==Kingmoor Ring==
[[File:Kingmoor runic ring.jpg|thumb|right|Kingmoor gold runic ring]]
The Kingmoor Ring (also Greymoor Hill Ring) dates to the 9th or 10th century. It is of gold, with a diameter ca. 27&amp;nbsp;mm.

It was discovered in June 1817 at Greymoor Hill, Kingmoor, near [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] ({{coord|54|55|0|N|2|58|30|W|}}).
By 1859, the ring was in the possession of the [[British Museum]] (ring catalogue no. 184) who has received it from the [[Earl of Aberdeen]]. A replica is on exhibit in the [[Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery]] in Carlisle.

The inscription  reads&lt;ref name=Page1999/&gt;
:{{runic|᛭ᚨᚱᛦᚱᛁᚢᚠᛚᛏᛦᚱᛁᚢᚱᛁᚦᚩᚾᚷᛚᚨᚴᛏᚨᛈᚩᚾ / ᛏᚨᚿ}}
:''ærkriufltkriuriþonglæstæpon/tol'' 
 
The final {{runic|ᛏᚨᚿ}} ''tol'' is written on the inside of the ring. The inscription amounts to a total of 30 signs.

Where ''k'' is the late [[Anglo-Saxon runes|Futhorc]] ''calc'' rune of the same shape as [[Younger Futhark]] ''[[ᛦ|Yr]]'', and the ''s'' is the so-called "bookhand s" looking similar to a [[Younger Futhark]] ''k'', ᚴ.

==Linstock Castle Ring==
A ring made of [[agate]], perhaps dating to the 9th century, found before 1824. Now British Museum ring catalogue no. 186.
The inscription reads
:''ery.ri.uf.dol.yri.þol.?les.te.pote.nol.''
Page (1999) takes this to be a corrupt version of the inscription of the Kingmoor and Bramham Moor rings.

The location where this ring was found is unrecorded, but Page (1999) suggests that it is identical to a ring found at Linstock Castle in 1773.
A note found among [[Thorkelin]]'s archive documenting his travels to England between 1785 and 1791.
The paper records an obscure inscription, "ERY.RI.VF.MOL / YRI.VRI.NOL / GLES.TE.SOTE.THOL", identified as "found in 1773 at Lynstock Castle  near Carlisle, &amp; not far from the Picts Wall in Cumberland".
Page   adduces a note from a 
sale catalogue of 1778 which lists "An antient Runic ring, found near the Picts Well, 1773".&lt;ref&gt;Page (1999), 291f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation of the ''ærkriu'' charm==
The sequence ''ærkriu'' found on both the Kingmoor and Bramham Moor Rings is interpreted as a spell for staunching blood, based on comparison with a charm containing the sequence ''ærcrio'' found in [[Bald's Leechbook]] (i.vii, fol. 20v). For this reason, the entire inscription is likely a protective or healing [[Magic (paranormal)|charm]] or spell with the ring serving as an [[amulet]].&lt;ref name=Page1999&gt;Page (1999), 112-114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Dickins, ''Runic Rings and Old English Charms'' ASNSL 167 (1935), 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

The charm in Leechbook is also found in Bodley MS:

|-
|}

The Leech book has the instruction: "to stop blood, poke into the ear with a whole ear of barley, in such a way that he [the patient] be unaware of it. Some write this:", followed by "either for horse or men, a blood-stauncher".

While the charm is "magical gibberish", there are a number of elements that can clearly be identified as [[Irish language|Irish]]: ''struth fola'' corresponds to Old Irish ''sruth fola'' "stream of blood".  ''arȝrenn'', ''ær grim'' etc. may be for ''ær greann'' "for irritation". Other parts sound clearly Anglo-Saxon such as ''onnhel'', ''on hæl'' for ''unhæl'' "unhealthy". The ''.lll.'' has been taken as a corruption of the [[ogham]] letter ᚃ (''w'') "alder", the '' ffil. crondi. ƿ.'' following it as the gloss ''fil crand .i. w[eorn]'' "it is a tree, i.e. 'alder'"
In the interpretation of Meroney (1945), the original text gave a list of ingredients for staunching blood, [[alder]] (''weorn''), [[curds]] (''ȝroth''), etc., with a gloss explaining one of them having slipped into the text. ''cron aer crio'' is taken as Irish for "prohibition against bleeding", ''ær leno'' as "against afflictions" (Old Irish ''ar léunu'').&lt;ref&gt;Howard Meroney, ''Irish in the Old English Charms''  Speculum, Vol. 20, No. 2 (1945), 172-182&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fake rings==
A number of fake rings, dating from the 18th century exist.  They are generally bronze, do not have ''niello''  letters but rather some kind of lacquer, and show signs of machining.

The '''Archdiocesan Marian Shrine''', formerly known as the '''Milwaukee Fatima Shrine''' and the '''National Shrine to Our Lady of Fatima''', is of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and a [[Shrines to the Virgin Mary|shrine to the Virgin Mary]]. It is operated by the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milwaukee]], which acquired the property from the [[Dominican Nuns of the Perpetual Rosary|Dominican Sisters of the Perpetual Rosary]].&lt;ref name=Fatima&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jonston|first1=James|title=Fatima: The Story That Would Not Die|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=z3ZQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EhEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7242%2C3787957|accessdate=July 1, 2016|work=Milwaukee Sentinel|date=May 20, 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is located in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]. The shrine was dedicated on April 26, 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=April 26, 1948|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19730425&amp;id=PEIqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=304EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3442,2478164&amp;hl=en|work=Milwaukee Sentinel|accessdate=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shrine also has a small indoor chapel and stone representations of the 15 mysteries of the [[rosary]].

==History==
The shrine began as a prayer for peace by the cloistered Dominican Sisters of the Perpetual Rosary. It is a Carrera marble statue of the Virgin Mary and statues of the three children and sheep.&lt;ref name=Fatima/&gt; In May 1945, it was thought to be the first and only shrine to Our Lady of Fatima in the United States. The Dominican Sisters hoped it would be made a national shrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Our Lady of Fatima Honored Here Today|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wyoaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cSMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3394%2C4836609|accessdate=July 2, 2016|work=The Milwaukee Journal|date=May 13, 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additions to the shrine==
A marble figure of Christ erected on a cross was added in 1952. It was donated by a woman who wished to remain anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Figure of Christ to be Dedicated at Fatima Shrine|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19520530&amp;id=d_spAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zSMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5499,6732382&amp;hl=en|accessdate=July 2, 2016|work=The Milwaukee Journal|date=May 30, 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, a brewery worker, contributed a marble statue of St. Joseph and his son.  The brewery worker felt the shrine was incomplete without a statue of the father of Christ.&lt;ref name=Worker&gt;{{cite news|title=Miller Memorial Given By Worker|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mcAVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UBAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7264%2C1089830|accessdate=July 2, 2016|work=The Milwaukee Sentinel|date=December 13, 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also in memory of the accidental death of [[Fred Miller (American football, born 1906)|Frederick C. Miller]] and his 20-year-old son, Fred Jr. The statue bears a part of Miller's favorite prayer.&lt;ref name=Worker/&gt;

[[File:A.'.a.'. seal.png|thumb|The seal of the A∴A∴]]

The '''A∴A∴''' is a spiritual organization described in 1907 by occultist [[Aleister Crowley]]. Its members are dedicated to the advancement of humanity by perfection of the individual on every plane through a graded series of universal initiations. Its initiations are [[syncretic]], unifying the essence of [[Theravada Buddhism]] with [[Advaita Vedanta|Vedantic]] yoga and [[ceremonial magic]]. The A∴A∴ applies what it describes as mystical and magical methods of spiritual attainment under the structure of the [[Kabbalah|Qabalistic]] [[Tree of Life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]], and aims to research, practise, and teach "scientific illuminism".

==History==

The A∴A∴ claims to have been present in all societies and epochs, although not necessarily under that name.&lt;ref name =XXXIII&gt;''The Equinox'' Volume 1 No 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The A∴A∴ is composed of two orders, known as the inner and outer college. The outer college in its modern form was formulated in 1907 by [[Aleister Crowley]] and [[George Cecil Jones]], claiming authority from Aiwass (the Author of [[The Book of the Law]]) and other [[Secret Chiefs]] of the planetary spiritual order after the schism in and subsequent collapse of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] at the turn of the Twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Liber LXI, in The Equinox 3,9&lt;/ref&gt; The principal [[sacred text|holy book]] of the A∴A∴ is the book Crowley called "AL" and "Liber Legis", technically called "Liber AL vel Legis sub figura CCXX as delivered by 93=418 to DCLXVI", whose scriptural title is [[The Book of the Law]], by which name the Book is most commonly known and referred to. There are several other holy books venerated in A∴A∴, which comprise the so-called Class A and AB material.&lt;ref&gt;Liber 61 vel Causae, verses 29-30, and Preface to ''Thelema: The Holy Books of Thelema'', Samuel Weiser, Inc. 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909 the [[Ordo Templi Orientis|O.T.O.]] considered itself to be a "close ally" of the A∴A∴, both organisations having accepted the authority of the Book of the Law, although the O.T.O., being a temporal and fraternal society, in no way participates in the A∴A∴'s strictly hierarchic and spiritual initiatory program, nor does O.T.O. represent A∴A∴. or transmit its functions or authority.&lt;ref&gt;The Equinox 3,1 page 198&lt;/ref&gt;

The classic account of A∴A∴ is Karl Von Eckharthausen's "The Cloud Upon the Sanctuary", re-issued by the A∴A∴&lt;ref name =XXXIII /&gt; as "Liber XXXIII".

===After Crowley===

Following Crowley's death in 1947, his student [[Karl Germer]] took over running the outer college of the order,&lt;ref&gt;"In a June 1947 letter to the most loyal of his disciples, Crowley specified that Germer should succeed him in the leadership of the O.T.O." Sutin, ''Do what thou wilt: A life of Aleister Crowley'', 2002 edition, p. 419. [http://www.castletower.org/chief.html Online copy of a 1941 letter] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707122535/http://www.castletower.org/chief.html |date=July 7, 2009 }} gives him authority in the O.T.O. and A∴A∴&lt;/ref&gt; but since Germer's death the situation has been less clear. Various lineages of the A∴A∴ survive today that claim to be descended from Crowley.

One such lineage descends from Crowley's student, actress [[Jane Wolfe]] (known as Soror Estai).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelema.org/aa/legacy_of_jane_wolfe.html Order's website], web version of article from ''In the Continuum'', Vol. V, No. 10 (Autumnal Equinox, 1996 E.V.)&lt;/ref&gt; Soror Estai's one student, [[Phyllis Seckler]] (Soror Meral), founded College of Thelema in 1973 and (with James A. Eshelman and Anna-Kria King) founded Temple of Thelema in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;James A. Eshelman, The Mystical and Magical System of the A∴A∴: The Spiritual System of Aleister Crowley and George Cecil Jones Step-by-Step. Los Angeles: The College of Thelema, Dec 1993 (1st hardcover edition 2000), Book Jacket.&lt;/ref&gt; She designated Eshelman as her successor in the Jane Wolfe branch of A∴A∴ and as chancellor of College of Thelema. Later, she also affirmed David Shoemaker's authority to "admit, supervise, and train" A∴A∴ initiates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cotnorcal.org/welcome/warrant/ |title=Warrant &amp;#124; The International College of Thelema |publisher=Cotnorcal.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several lineages run through pupils of [[Marcelo Ramos Motta]], such as [http://www.aa-thelema.org Ray Eales],&lt;ref&gt;"Our heritage - To Mega Therion - Frater Saturnus - Frater Ever - Frater 939∴" http://www.hoor.org,&lt;/ref&gt; David Bersson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.castletower.org |title=Welcome to castletower.org Domain |publisher=Castletower.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140617075858/http://www.castletower.org/ |archivedate=2014-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and J. Daniel  Gunther&lt;ref&gt;Gunther. Initiation in the Aeon of the Child. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Motta was a student of Germer{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}. Another lineage links itself to Crowley through [[Israel Regardie]] and his pupil [[Gerald Suster]], claiming that Regardie joined the A∴A∴ when he became Crowley’s secretary in 1928, but distanced himself from the organisation when the two men parted company four years later in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Regardie (3rd ed. 1998) p. xv-xvii&lt;/ref&gt; Other lineages run through [[Grady McMurtry]] and [[Charles Stansfeld Jones]]. There are also lineages descended from [[Frank Bennett (occultist)|Frank Bennett]] and [[Rosaleen Norton]] operating in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond pp. 5-6, 15&lt;/ref&gt; There are also 'independent' A∴A∴ lineages that either don't descend from the pupils of Crowley or that choose not to declare their link. There presently exists no single undisputed central authority of the A∴A∴ such as existed under Crowley and Germer; nor has any surviving mechanism for the transference of such temporal authority been preserved down to the present day. The existence of lineages is itself contentious, [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] only recognizing one claimant as the A∴A∴.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oto-usa.org/thelema/aa/ |title=OTO-&gt; USGL-&gt; A∴A∴|publisher=oto-usa.org |}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
Members of the First Order of A∴A∴ (Golden Dawn) and Dominis Liminis are sworn to openly declare everywhere their connection with A∴A∴ (Liber CLXXXV). Adepts, however, are expected to work in silence, whereas Magi are required to declare "their Law". The Ipsissimi, who "existeth without form", the highest initiates manifest on this plane, are sworn to silence as to their attainment to this degree (Liber B vel Magi, One Star in Sight).

In A∴A∴ members officially only know those directly above and below in the chain of instruction. Members are expected to work alone, consulting as needed with their superior in the Order. In this way the founders of the system hoped to avoid the many political problems that allegedly brought about the downfall of the predecessor organisation, the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]. The A∴A∴ is an organisation focused on enlightenment of the individual, with a strong emphasis on maintaining the chain of initiation from teacher to student, and devoting all of one's attainments to those individuals below them (One Star in Sight).

All members of the A∴A∴ at some point, are expected to perform two central tasks:
* The Task of the grade of Adeptus Minor, the first grade of the Middle Order, being the attainment of the experience known as "the Knowledge and Conversation of the [[Holy Guardian Angel]], the attainment of which is the central theme of the order's official instructions&lt;ref&gt;James A. Eshelman, ''The Mystical and Magical System of the A∴A∴''. Los Angeles: College of Thelema, Dec 1993 (1st hardcover edition 2000), Chapters 8-9. Liber Collegii Sancti sub figura CLXXXV. ''The Task of the Adeptus Minor.'' Crowley, Aleister, ''One Star in Sight.''&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The experience of the passage through the  [[Abyss (Thelema)|Abyss]], resulting in the attainment of the grade of Magister Templi, the first grade in the Third Order&lt;ref&gt;James A. Eshelman, ''The Mystical and Magical System of the A∴A∴''. Los Angeles: College of Thelema, Dec 1993 (1st hardcover edition 2000), Chapter 11. Crowley, Aleister, ''One Star in Sight.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Any person whosoever may swear the Oath of the Master of the Temple of A∴A∴ and be admitted into the Opening of the Grade of Magister Templi and the Order of the S∴S∴ the opening of which is the passage through the Abyss.&lt;ref&gt;One Star in Sight,&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the strict and inviolable rule of the Order that members of A∴A∴ never accept payment or other consideration for initiation or other services, on pain of irredeemable expulsion.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Aleister Crowley, London: 1929 Magick in Theory and Practice, Appendix II One Star in Sight&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initiatory structure==
The initiatory structure of A∴A∴ is based on the Qabalistic Tree
Of Life, its grades following the sephirot up the tree in reverse order. 
The A∴A∴ is sub-divided into three orders:
The S.S., being the governing body (Third Order) and comprising those grades that are above the Abyss;
The R.R. et A.C. (Second Order), comprising those degrees that are below the Abyss but above the Veil of Paroketh; and
The Golden Dawn (First Order), comprising the grades below the Veil of Paroketh. A complete description of the tasks of the First Order is given in Liber XIII vel Graduum Montis Abiegni: a syllabus of the steps upon path, in The Equinox Volume 1.

Two additional "grades", the Dwellers on the Thresholds, link the orders: Dominis Limnis in Paroketh, and Babe of the Abyss in the Abyss.

Members of the Third Order can generate their own variations of the First and Second Order teachings as reflections of their own Understanding, contemplating systems of attainment not compassed in the curriculum of the main system.&lt;ref&gt;"One Star in Sight"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student===

A student's business is to acquire a general intellectual knowledge of all systems of attainment, as declared in the prescribed books. At the end of a fixed period, the Student takes a written examination to test his reading, after which he passes through a small ritual involving the reading of the History Lection (Liber LXI), and passes to the grade of [[#Probationer|Probationer]].

===The Order of the G∴D∴ (Golden Dawn)===

====Probationer====
(0°=0&lt;sup&gt;□&lt;/sup&gt;): The Probationer's principal business is to begin such practices as he or she may prefer, and to write a careful record of the same for one year.

====Neophyte====
(1°=10&lt;sup&gt;□&lt;/sup&gt;): Has to acquire perfect control of the [[Astral plane#The astral plane and astral experience|astral plane]].

====Zelator====
(2°=9&lt;sup&gt;□&lt;/sup&gt;): The Zelator's main work is to achieve complete success in [[asana]] and [[pranayama]]. The Zelator also begins to study the formula of the [[Rosy Cross]].

====Practicus====
(3°=8&lt;sup&gt;□&lt;/sup&gt;): Is expected to complete the intellectual training, and in particular to study [[Hermetic Qabalah|Qabalah]].

====Philosophus====
(4°=7&lt;sup&gt;□&lt;/sup&gt;): Is expected to complete the moral training. Is tested in Devotion to the Order.

====Dominus Liminis====
(The Link): Is expected to show mastery of [[pratyahara]] and [[dharana]].

===The Order of the R∴C∴ (Rosy Cross)===

====Adeptus Minor (Without)====
(5°=6&lt;sup&gt;□&lt;/sup&gt;): Lesser Adept (Without). Is expected to perform the Great Work and to attain the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.

====Adeptus Minor (Within)====
(5°=6&lt;sup&gt;□&lt;/sup&gt;): Lesser Adept (Within). Is admitted to the practice of the formula of the Rosy Cross on entering the College of the Holy Ghost.

====Adeptus Major====
(6°=5&lt;sup&gt;□&lt;/sup&gt;): Greater Adept. Obtains a general mastery of practical Magick, though without comprehension.

====Adeptus Exemptus====
(7°=4&lt;sup&gt;□&lt;/sup&gt;): Exempt Adept. Completes in perfection all these matters. He then either (a) becomes a Brother of the Left Hand Path or, (b) is stripped of all his attainments and of himself as well, even of his Holy Guardian Angel, and becomes a Babe of the Abyss, who, having transcended the Reason, does nothing but grow in the womb of its mother. It then finds itself a Master of the Temple. 

===The Order of the S∴S∴ (Silver Star)===

====Magister Templi====
or '''Master of the Temple''' (8°=3&lt;sup&gt;□&lt;/sup&gt;): The principal business of this grade is to obtain a perfect understanding of the [[Universe]]. The essential Attainment is the perfect annihilation of that personality which limits and oppresses his true self{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}. The Magister Templi is pre-eminently the Master of [[Mysticism]], that is, his [[Understanding]] is entirely free from internal contradiction or external obscurity; his [[Word]] is to comprehend the existing Universe in accordance with his own Mind{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}. This grade corresponds to [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]] on the [[Tree of Life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]], and to the [[Secret Chiefs]] in the old [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}. Crowley also linked it with the experience he called "Shivadarshana" and with the Four Formless States of [[Buddhism]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://the-equinox.org//vol1/no2/eqi02004.html "The Psychology of Hashish"], XVI-XVIII, in ''The Equinox I'' no. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; although he cautions against treating these criteria as sufficient for the grade.&lt;ref&gt;''Magick Without Tears'', [http://hermetic.com/crowley/magick-without-tears/mwt_12.html Chapter XII].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Magus====
(9°=2&lt;sup&gt;□&lt;/sup&gt;): The Magus seeks to attain [[Wisdom]], declares his law, and is a Master of all [[Magick (Aleister Crowley)|Magick]] in its greatest and highest sense. His will is entirely free from internal diversion or external opposition; His work is to create a new [[Universe]] in accordance with his [[Will (philosophy)|Will]]. This grade corresponds to [[Chokmah]] on the [[Tree of Life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]]. It also bears some resemblance to [[Nietzsche|Nietzsche's]] "new philosopher" who creates values, although with more focus on self-transcendence according to Crowley biographer Lawrence Sutin.&lt;ref&gt;Sutin, ''Do what thou wilt'', p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ipsissimus====
(10°=1&lt;sup&gt;□&lt;/sup&gt;): Beyond the comprehension of the lower degrees. An Ipsissimus is free from limitations and necessity and lives in perfect balance with the manifest universe. Essentially, the highest mode of attainment. This grade corresponds to [[Kether]] on the [[Tree of Life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]]. Ipsissimus is quite hard to translate directly from Latin to English, but it is essentially the superlative of "self", translating rather approximately to "His most Selfness," or "self-est." (c.f. [[generalissimus]] for the same superlative form in use for a grade from same Latin root.)

Crowley named as a condition of this grade the trance [[Nirodha]]-samapatti,&lt;ref&gt;[http://hermetic.com/crowley/libers/lib1.html Liber B vel Magi], published in ''The Equinox I'' no. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; which reduces heartbeat and other life functions to the bare minimum.&lt;ref name=JAAR&gt;[http://jaar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/XLV/2/226 The Structure and Dynamics of the Attainment of Cessation in Theravada Meditation], by Winston L. King. Journal of the American Academy of Religion 1977 XLV(2):226.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Narada Maha Thera]], quoted in ''Buddhist Phenomenology: A Philosophical Investigation of Yogacara Buddhism'' by Dan Lusthaus, [https://books.google.com/books?id=j0TKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=nirodha+samapatti p. 139 (Google Books)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theravada]] Buddhist monks traditionally attain nirodha-samapatti by producing the aforementioned Formless States one after the other, and perceiving in each what they call the Three Characteristics of all existence: sorrow or tendency towards sorrow, change or unreliability, and insubstantiality or lack of self.&lt;ref name=JAAR /&gt;  Crowley and the A∴A∴ however seek to replace this threefold view with the quest for balance as both a motive for discipline and the means of achieving their end goal.&lt;ref&gt;"The whole point is to make (attainment) perfect in balance. Then it radiates light in every direction, while the Ipsissimus is utterly indifferent to it." Diary quoted as explanation in Sutin, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Liber B vel Magi'' they urge the Magus seeking further progress to identify the Buddhist Three Characteristics with the opposite states. "Wherein Sorrow is Joy, and Change is Stability, and Selflessness is Self." Crowley's version of nirodha includes "seeing first the truth and then the falsity of the Three Characteristics" according to his published theory.&lt;ref&gt;"Psychology of Hashish" XIX.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ipsissimus should keep the achievement of this final grade secret, even from the rest of the Order, and continue with the work of the Magus while expressing the nature of an Ipsissimus in word and deed.&lt;ref&gt;''Magick'' second revised edition 1998, Appendix II "One star in sight", p. 491.

== Early Phase ==

=== `Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan ===

[[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916–1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]. The sixth of the tablets was the first to mention [[Latin America]]n regions and was written on April 8, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 — after the end of [[World War I]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. The first actions on the part of Bahá'í community towards Latin America were that of a few individuals who made trips to [[Mexico]] and [[South America]] near or before this unavailing in 1919, including Mr. and Mrs. Frankland, and [[Hands of the Cause#Appointed posthumously by Shoghi Effendi|Roy C. Wilhelm]], and [[Martha Root]]. Root's travels to Latin America began in the summer of 1919.&lt;ref name="root"&gt;{{cite web | last = Allmar | first = Husayn | title = Martha Root’s Journey to Chile | work = The Chilean Temple Initiative | publisher = National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United State | year = 2007 | url = http://www.chilean-temple.org/content/view/27/45/ | accessdate = 2008-03-05 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080323081114/http://www.chilean-temple.org/content/view/27/45/ | archivedate = 2008-03-23 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sixth tablet was translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on April 4, 1919, and published in [[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]] magazine on December 12, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Abbas | first = 'Abdu'l-Bahá |others=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab (trans. and comments) | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation] |date=April 1919 | url =http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"His Holiness [[Christ]] says: Travel ye to the East and to the West of the world and summon the people to the [[Kingdom of God]].&amp;nbsp;... the republic of Mexico&amp;nbsp;... to be familiar with the [[Spanish language]]&amp;nbsp;... [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[El Salvador|Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Panama]] and the seventh country [[Belize]]&amp;nbsp;... Attach great importance to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] population of America&amp;nbsp;... Likewise the islands of&amp;nbsp;... [[Cuba]], [[Haiti]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Jamaica]],&amp;nbsp;... [[Bahama]] Islands, even the small [[Watling Island]]&amp;nbsp;... [[Haiti]] and [[Santo Domingo]]&amp;nbsp;... the islands of [[Bermuda]]&amp;nbsp;... the republics of the continent of South America—[[Colombia]], [[Ec&amp;shy;or]], [[Peru]], [[Brazil]], [[the Guianas]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Paraguay]], [[Venezuela]]; also the islands to the north, east and west of South America, such as [[Falkland Islands]], the [[Galápagos Islands|Galapagòs]], [[Juan Fernández Islands|Juan Fernandez]], [[Trinidad and Tobago|Tobago and Trinidad]].&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="letters" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the release of these tablets and then `Abdu'l-Bahá's death in 1921, a few Bahá'ís began moving to or at least visiting Latin America. In 1927 [[Leonora Armstrong]] made public mention of the religion in the capital city of [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]] of what was then [[British Guiana]].&lt;ref name="hist" /&gt;

=== Seven Year Plan and succeeding decades ===

[[Shoghi Effendi]], who was named `Abdu'l-Bahá's successor, wrote a [[Telegraphy|cable]] on May 1, 1936 to the [[Bahá'í administration#National|Bahá'í Annual Convention]] of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of `Abdu'l-Bahá's vision to begin.&lt;ref name="alamb" /&gt; In his cable he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Appeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by 'Abdu'l-Bahá in ''Tablets of the Divine Plan''. Urge earnest deliberation with incoming National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of Bahá'í Era drawing to a close. Humanity entering outer fringes most perilous stage its existence. Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace the light of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh and establish structural basis of His World Order."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Shoghi |last = Effendi |authorlink = Shoghi Effendi |origyear = |year = 1947 |title = Messages to America |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Committee |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |oclc= 5806374 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/MA/ma-16.html.iso8859-1?query=Appeal%7Cto%7Cassembled%7Cdelegates%7Cponder%7Chistoric&amp;action=highlight#gr2 | page = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the May 1st cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on May 19 calling for permanent [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] to be established in all the countries of Latin America. The Bahá'í [[National Spiritual Assembly]] of the United States and Canada was appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. In 1936 Dudley M. Blakely, after becoming a Bahá'í in 1920, embarked with Elsa, his wife, on worldwide travels to promote the religion and traveled to Guyana for several weeks to promulgate the religion.&lt;ref name="hist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="xviii" /&gt; During the 1937 Bahá'í North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Bahá'ís to go to Latin America as well as to include the completion of the outer structure of the [[Bahá'í House of Worship]] in Wilmette, Illinois.&lt;ref name="alamb" /&gt; In 1937 the ''First Seven Year Plan'' (1937–44), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Bahá'ís the goal of establishing the Bahá'í Faith in every country in Latin America. With the spread of American Bahá'ís communities and assemblies began to form in 1938 across Latin America.&lt;ref name="alamb" /&gt;

== Establishment of the community ==

The first Bahá'í to settle in Guyana was Dr. Malcolm King, a Jamaican, who traveled from his home in the United States in 1953&lt;ref name="hist" /&gt; via [[Trinidad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The History of the Bahá'í Faith in Trinidad and Tobago | work = Official Webpage of the National Assembly of the Baha'is of Trinidad and Tobago | publisher = National Assembly of the Baha'is of Trinidad and Tobago | date = 2009-05-25 | url =http://www.bahaitt.org/history.htm | doi = | accessdate = 2009-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 the first Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] was elected in Guyana in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]].

Following the election of the regional National Spiritual Assembly of South America in 1950, in 1957 this assembly was split into two - basically northern/eastern South America and one of the western/southern South America.&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bahai-library.com/handscause_statistics_1953-63&amp;chapter=1 | title = The Bahá'í Faith: 1844–1963: Information Statistical and Comparative, Including the Achievements of the Ten Year International Bahá'í Teaching &amp; Consolidation Plan 1953–1963| author = Compiled by [[Hands of the Cause]] Residing in the Holy Land | pages = 22, 46, 70}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 smaller groups of Bahá'ís were known in Campelville, Kitty and Lodge Village (now suburbs of Georgetown), Grove and [[Providence, Guyana|Providence]] (both in [[Demerara-Mahaica]] in East Bank Demerara), and MacKenzie (now part of Linden).&lt;ref name="stats" /&gt;[[File:Gy-map.png|left|thumb]] In August 1965 the Bahá'ís of Georgetown hosted a regional conference with [[Hand of the Cause]] Jalál Kházeh and Bahá'ís from British, French and Dutch Guiana, northern Brazil, eastern Venezuela and Trinidad attending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Regional teaching Congress held: in Georgetown |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1965 | number = 416 | page =5 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early February, 1968 Hand of the Cause [[Rúhíyyih Khanum]] visited giving public talks, visiting a school for the blind, and civic leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Surinam and Guiana Greet Hand of the Cause of God |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=September 1968 | number = 450 | page =6 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 the Bahá'ís of Guyana, Surinamé and French Guiana first elected a regional [[National Spiritual Assembly]].&lt;ref name="alamb"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lamb | first = Artemus | title = The Beginnings of the Bahá'í Faith in Latin America:Some Remembrances, English Revised and Amplified Edition | publisher = M L VanOrman Enterprises |date=November 1995 | location = 1405 Killarney Drive, West Linn OR, 97068, United States of America | url = http://bahai-library.com/lamb_bahai_latin_america}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rúhíyyih Khanum represented the [[Universal House of Justice]] at the convention to elect the assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = First National Baha'i Convention of the Baha'is of Guyana, Surinam and French Guiana |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1970 | number = 476 | page =13 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 54 delegates representing at least 10 assemblies in Guyana, 3 in Surinamé and 3 in French Guiana. The members elected were Jamshid Ar-jomandi; Henry Dolphin; August Holland; Cheryl Plerre; Ellen Widmer; Mr. Rivadavia da Silva, Eileen Hill, Ivan Fraser, and Daisy Hahnfeld. While there Rúhíyyih Khanum again spoke to the public press and civic leaders this time including then President [[Arthur Chung]]. Her comments dwelt on the [[Bahá'í teachings]] of the oneness of humanity and ending racial prejudices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = The Great Safari of Hand of the Cause Ruhiyyih Khanum; Conventions in Ec&amp;shy;or and Georgetown |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1971 | number = 483 |pages=16–17 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first regional Baha'i Youth Conference was held in [[Paramaribo]], December 29 through 31, 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = International Youth Conference, Paramaribo, Surinam |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=May 1973 | number = 506 | page =7 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Conference was especially for Baha'i youth of Trinidad and Tobago, Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao, Guyana, Surinam and French Guiana.

The elected members of the first National Assembly of Guyana were Sheila Dolphin, Henry Dolphin, Ellen Widmer, Frank Sheffey, Ivan Fraser, Eileen Hill, David Morris, Rooplall Doodnauth, and Krishna Seegopaul.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt; Meanwhile, pioneers continue to arrive in Guyana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Around the World; Scotland |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=January 1979 | number = 574 | page =19 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July and August 1980 Shanaz Furudi, a [[Bahá'í Faith in India|Bahá'í from India]] toured Guyana and addressing the public and offering training for Bahá'í institutions.

Guyanese citizens have also moved to other countries where some have become Bahá'ís as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Ramsharran, Benjamin W. | newspaper = The Hartford Courant | date = 2001-02-11 | url =http://bahai-library.com/newspapers/2001/021001-1.html | accessdate = 2009-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception the religion has had involvement in [[socio-economic development]] beginning by giving greater freedom to women,&lt;ref name="iranhistory"&gt;{{cite web | last = Momen | first = Moojan | title = History of the Baha'i Faith in Iran | work = draft "A Short Encyclopedia of the Baha'i Faith" | publisher = Bahai-library.com | url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_iran#9.%20Social%20and%20economic%20development | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kingdon | first = Geeta Gandhi | title = Education of women and socio-economic development | journal = Baha'i Studies Review | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | year = 1997 | url = http://bahai-library.com/kingdon_education_women_development }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics.&lt;ref name="iranhistory" /&gt;

In Guyana in 1980 saw the first Bahá'í women's conference. A main topic through the conference was the role of women in religion as well topics dealing with life in the tropics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Around the World; Guyana |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=May 1981 | number = 602 |ISSN=0195-9212 | page =15 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1981 more than 60 artists attended a workshop set up by five Bahá'í artists which presented workshops emphasizing spiritual issues and introduced Bahá'í [[Sandpainting|sand-painter]] [[David Villasenor]] to the Guyanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Around the World; Guyana |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=November 1981 | number = 602 |ISSN=0195-9212 | page =12 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the [[Universal House of Justice]] dated 20 October 1983 was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Baha'i Faith 1957–1988: A Survey of Contemporary Developments | first = Moojan | last = Momen |author2=Smith, Peter | year = 1989 | url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_smith_developments_1957-1988 |volume = 19 | journal = Religion | pages=63–91 |doi= 10.1016/0048-721X(89)90077-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the [[Bahá'í teachings]], in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. In the 1980s the Guyanese Bahá'í community's established an Office of Social and Economic Development which consulted with rural communities on a needs assessment which focused on the issue of literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-first = James | editor1-last = Lynch | editor2-first = Sohan |editor2-last = Modgil | author1= Pamela O'Toole |author2= Brian O'Toole | title = Education and development: tradition and innovation, Volume 3 | publisher = Continuum International Publishing Group | year = 1997 | location = | pages = 180–1 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Kv0PgL5EMhgC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;lpg=PA180 | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-304-32888-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 Bahá'í Frank Fernandes, a native of Guyana, was the guest of honor at a dinner of civic leaders followed by a piano recital at, and a fundraiser for,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Around the World; Guyana |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1985 | number = 648 |ISSN=0195-9212 | page =15 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; the National Cultural Centre for an audience of 250.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Around the World; Guyana |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=February 1985 | number = 602 |ISSN=0195-9212 | page =16 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; One response of the community was to contact the Bahá'í communities in Canada, the US, and the UK. Together they made arrangements for 40,000 reading books which became the basis of libraries in 65 villages. Training workshops were organized with the cooperation of the Ministry of Education which were developed in the context of the [[Macushi]] and [[Wapishana|Wapashana]] languages. As recently as 2000 Bahá'ís were noted contributing to the training of 1500 teachers for this project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Universal House of Justice | first = | authorlink = Universal House of Justice | title = Ridván Letter, 2000 | work = Ridvan Messages from the Universal House of Justice | publisher = Bahá'í Library Online | year = 2000 | url =http://bahai-library.com/uhj_ridvan_2000 | accessdate = 2009-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the 1980s some Bahá'ís opened a private school - the [[School of the Nations (Guyana)|School of the Nations]] in Guyana, an all age private [[Bahá'í inspired school]].

==Early phase==

===`Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan===
In the history of the Bahá'í Faith the first mentions of Portugal start in the twentieth century. [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]].  The seventh of the tablets was the first to mention several countries in [[Europe]] including beyond where `Abdu'l-Bahá had visited in 1911-12. Written on April 11, 1916, it was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 &amp;mdash; after the end of [[World War I]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. The seventh tablet was translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on April 4, 1919, and published in [[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]] magazine on December 12, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Abbas | first = 'Abdu'l-Bahá |others=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab (trans. and comments) | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url =http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In all the countries of the world the longing for universal peace is taking possession of the consciousness of men. … A most wonderful state of receptivity is being realized.… Therefore, O ye believers of God! Show ye an effort and after this war spread ye the synopsis of the divine teachings in the British Isles, France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Portugal, Rumania, Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Greece, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, San Marino, Balearic Isles, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, Crete, Malta, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Shetland Islands, Hebrides and Orkney Islands."&lt;ref name="tablets"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===First contact===
[[Martha Root]] was an early traveler of the religion to visit Portugal in between 1923 and 1933.&lt;ref name="Manha"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Yang |first=Jiling |editor-last=Fletcher |editor-first=Ian |title=In Search of Martha Root: An American Bahá'í Feminist and Peace Advocate in the Early Twentieth Century |journal=Master's Thesis |publisher=Georgia State University, College of Arts and Sciences, Department of Women's Studies |date=2005-08-16 |url=http://etd.gsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11282005-004146/unrestricted/yang_jiling_200512_master.pdf |issn= |accessdate=2010-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091115023043/http://etd.gsu.edu/theses/available/etd-11282005-004146/unrestricted/yang_jiling_200512_master.pdf |archivedate=2009-11-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that two Bahá'ís were interviewed by the newspapers ''Diario de Noticias'' and ''Diario de Lisboa'' and gave other talks on the religion in 1926.

In 1946 the Bahá'í [[National Spiritual Assembly]] of the [[United States]] formed the Bahá'í European Teaching Committee to teach the religion in Europe.  This endeavour oversaw the arrival of a number of Bahá'í [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]].&lt;ref name="draft"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| last = C. van den Hoonaard | first = Will| title = Netherlands | encyclopedia = draft of A Short Encyclopedia of the Baha'i Faith | publisher = Baha'i Library Online | date = 1993-11-08 | url =http://bahai-library.com/hoonaard_encyclopedia_netherlands | accessdate = 2008-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] was elected in 1946 in Lisbon.&lt;ref name="Manha"/&gt; Charlotte Stirratt was a pioneer who had moved to Lisbon, by November 1948.&lt;ref name="draft"/&gt;

==Growth==

In September 1951 the first Iberian conference took place with nine native Bahá'ís and other pioneers who had attended the Fourth European Teaching Conference – recommendations from the consultation included exchanging updated information and further coordination between the communities, and to send contributions for the final work on the [[Shrine of the Báb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = First Iberian Conference|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=December 1951 | number = 250 | page =9 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953 [[Shoghi Effendi]], head of the religion after the death of [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], planned an international teaching plan termed the [[Ten Year Crusade]]. During the plan [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] moved from Portugal colonies including [[Angola]] and [[East Timor]] from 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Vreeland | first = Claire | authorlink = |author2=Graham Hassall | title = And the trees clapped their hands : stories of Bahá'í pioneers | publisher = George Ronald | contribution = Harold and Florence Fitzner: Knights of Bahá'u'lláh to Portuguese Timor | contribution-url = http://bahai-library.com/hassall_fitzners_portuguese_timor | year = 1994 | location = Oxford, UK | pages = 320–332 | url = http://www.grbooks.com/show_book.php?book_id=4| isbn = 978-0-85398-378-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957 Portugal and Spain formed a regional National Spiritual Assembly. The 1957 convention was witnessed by [[Charles Wolcott]] as a representative of Shoghi Effendi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = We Look at Our Obiectives|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1957 | number = 316 | page =16 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962 each formed their own independent [[National Spiritual Assembly]].&lt;ref name="BinW"/&gt; In 1963 the delegates to the national convention was set at 19.&lt;ref name="custodians"&gt;{{cite book |author = Rabbani, R. (Ed.) |authorlink = Rúhíyyih Khanum |year = 1992 |title = The Ministry of the Custodians 1957-1963 |publisher = Bahá'í World Centre |isbn = 0-85398-350-X | pages = 403, 412  |url = http://bahai-library.com/uhj_ministry_custodians}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, the members of the national assemblies of the world were the delegates to elect the [[Universal House of Justice]] for the first time - the members of the assembly of Portugal that participated were Angelo da Silva Carneiro, Mr. Mansour Masrour, Sara Tiffon Ramonet, Hilda Xavier Rodrigues, Carlos Salomao, Carl Scherer, Juliao Serrano, Celestino M. Silva and Richard Walters.&lt;ref name="custodians"/&gt;

In 1963 the community of Bahá'ís was organized into Assemblies, groups between 1 and 9 and isolated Bahá'is as follows:&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt;

| [[Beja (Portugal)|Beja]]
| [[Costa da Caparica]]
| [[Monte da Caparica]]
|[[Seixal Municipality|Seixal]]/[[Amora (Seixal)|Amora]]
|}

Despite this growth the government of Portugal actively opposed the development of the religion until liberalized&lt;ref name="BinW"/&gt; following the [[Carnation Revolution]] of 1974 and the writing of the [[Portuguese Constitution of 1976]].

In 1987 the Portuguese community had 25 [[Local Spiritual Assembly|Local Spiritual Assemblies]] - more per capita than neighbouring Spain.

The Portuguese Bahá'í Summer Schools are a series of annual events held in Portugal, as part of the "Summer School" concept of [[Bahá'í school]]. The Portuguese Bahá'í Summer Schools modestly emerged in the 60's, and have been growing in popularity and scope since. In 2009, the event hosted over 200 participants from all 5 continents, and counted with [[Ali Nakhjavani]] and Violette Nakhjavani, as well as [[Glenford Mitchell]], as main speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Media (Pics &amp; Vids) | work = | publisher = Summer School Committee | year = 2010| url = http://portuguesebahaisummerschool.com/m/Media-Pics-Vids-  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100823203220/http://www.portuguesebahaisummerschool.com/ | archivedate = August 23, 2010 | accessdate = 2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern community==
There has been news coverage of the development of the [[Terraces (Bahá'í)|Bahá'í Terraced gardens]] in Haifa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Marujo | first = Antonio | title = Os Novos Jardins Suspensos do Monte Carmelo Baha'ís inauguram espaço verde em Haifa | newspaper = Jornal Publico | date = 2001-05-23 | url = http://bahai-library.com/marujo_novos_jardins_suspensos | accessdate = 2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent counts show close to some 1,995 members of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] in 2005 according to the [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying on [[World Christian Encyclopedia]]).&lt;ref name="WCE-05"/&gt;  In 2007 the Bahá'ís of Portugal contributed to a religious discussion on society with the theme "The Baha'i faith and equal opportunities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Diversidade e Igualdade de Oportunidades: Debates sobre Religião e Imigração |work=Eventos e Iniciativas |publisher=The Immigration Observatory (Government of Portugal) |year=2007 |url=http://www.oi.acidi.gov.pt/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1487 |accessdate=2010-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006205609/http://www.oi.acidi.gov.pt/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1487 |archivedate=2011-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Marco Antonio Oliveira, a representative of the Bahá'í community of Portugal, was appointed by the Ministers of Justice and Parliamentary Affairs as a member of the Committee Issue of Time for Religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news   | title = Novo membro na Comissão do Tempo de Emissão das Confissões Religiosas  | newspaper = Agência Ecclesia  | publisher = Comunicações Sociais  | date = 2010-04-30  | url = http://www.agencia.ecclesia.pt/cgi-bin/noticia.pl?&amp;id=79242  | accessdate = 2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beatrice Ethel Grimshaw''' (3 February 1870 &amp;ndash; 30 June 1953) was a writer and traveller of [[Irish people|Irish]] origin, for many years based in [[Papua New Guinea]].

==Life==
She was born in Cloona House&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iguidez.com/video/guides/belfast/cloona-house-oasis-center/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-04-28 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120903200142/http://www.iguidez.com/video/guides/belfast/cloona-house-oasis-center/ |archive-date=2012-09-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Dunmurry]], [[County Antrim]], Ireland into a well-to-do family. She was educated privately, at [[Victoria College, Belfast]], in [[Caen]], France, then [[Bedford College (London)|Bedford College, London]] and [[Queen's College, Belfast]] and never graduated,&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/grimshaw-beatrice-ethel-6494/text11135|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography|first=Hugh|last=Laracy|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|accessdate=8 October 2018|via=Australian Dictionary of Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it was later claimed she had been a lecturer in [[Classics]] at [[Bedford College (London)|Bedford Women's College]].&lt;ref name=bg&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article22615642 |title=Beatrice Grimshaw |newspaper=[[The Queenslander]] |date=22 October 1921 |accessdate=28 April 2012 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her family were members of the [[Church of Ireland]], but she converted to Catholicism after leaving home.

She worked for various shipping companies and then as a freelance journalist in Dublin. At the height of the [[Bike_boom#1890s|Bicycle Craze]] she contacted [[Richard J. Mecredy]], the proprietor of the Dublin-based ''Irish Cyclist'', expressing her interest in cycling and journalism. in 1891 she became a contributor to the magazine and two years later she became sub-editor. She then took over the magazine's sister publication, the ''Social Review'', which she edited until 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Isles of Adventure | publisher=Herbert Jenkins | author=Grimshaw, Beatrice | year=1930 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; But she had long harboured a desire to see the Pacific, and in 1904 she was engaged by the (London) ''Daily Graphic'' to report on the Pacific islands,&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; reportedly sailing around the Pacific islands in her own [[cutter (boat)|cutter]].&lt;ref name=bg/&gt; She was commissioned to write publicity for [[Cook Islands]], [[Fiji]], [[Niue]], [[Samoa]], and [[Tonga]].&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; In 1907 she sailed to [[Papua (Australian territory)|Papua]] on a commission from [[The Times]] and the [[Sydney Morning Herald]],&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; but remained for twenty-seven years, much of the time at [[Rona Falls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article40502011 |title=Miss Beatrice Grimshaw |newspaper=[[The Cairns Post]] |location=Qld. |date=25 June 1925 |accessdate=29 April 2012 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Joyce. 2002.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5422">There are a few differing '''Buddhist views on sin'''.

[[ethnology|Ethnologist]] [[Christoph von Fürer-Haimendorf]] explained,
{{quote|In Buddhist thinking the whole universe, men as well as gods, are subject to a reign of law. Every action, good or bad, has an inevitable and automatic effect in a long chain of causes, an effect which is independent of the will of any deity. Even though this may leave no room for the concept of 'sin' in the sense of an act of defiance against the authority of a personal god, Buddhists speak of 'sin' when referring to transgressions against the universal moral code. (1974: 550)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=von Fürer-Haimendorf|first=Christoph|year=1974|title=The Sense of Sin in Cross-Cultural Perspective|journal = Man|volume = New Series 9.4|pages=539–556}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

American [[Zen]] author [[Brad Warner]] states that in Buddhism there is no concept of sin at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Warner| first =Brad| authorlink =Brad Warner| title =[[Hardcore Zen|Hardcore Zen: Punk Rock, Monster Movies &amp; the Truth About Reality]]| publisher =Wisdom Publications| year =2003| pages =144| isbn = 0-86171-380-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Warner| first =Brad| authorlink =Brad Warner|  title =[[Sex, Sin, and Zen |Sex, Sin, and Zen: A Buddhist Exploration of Sex from Celibacy to Polyamory and Everything in Between]]| publisher =New World Library| year =2010| pages =72| isbn = 978-1-57731-910-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha Dharma Education Association also expressly states "The idea of sin or original sin has no place in Buddhism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buddhism: Major Differences|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/snapshot01.htm|publisher=Buddha Dharma Education Association|accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zen student and author Barbara O'Brien has said that "Buddhism has no concept of sin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Let's Forgive Brit Hume|url=http://buddhism.about.com/b/2010/01/04/lets-forgive-brit-hume.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sins and Buddhism|url=http://buddhism.about.com/b/2010/01/08/sins-and-buddhism.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chögyam Trungpa]] specifically disagreed with the notion of "[[original sin]]"&lt;ref name="trungpa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic Goodness or Original Sin?|url=http://www.lionsroar.com/basic-goodness-or-original-sin/|publisher=[[Lion's Roar (magazine)|Lion's Roar]]|accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying

{{quote|The problem with this notion of original sin or mistake is that it acts very much as a hinderance {{sic}} to people. At some point it is of course necessary to realize one’s shortcomings. But if one goes too far with that, it kills any inspiration and can destroy one’s vision as well. So in that way, it really is not helpful, and in fact it seems unnecessary.&lt;ref name="trungpa"/&gt;}}

[[Walpola Rahula]] also disagreed with the notion of sin saying "In fact there is no 'sin' in Buddhism, as sin is understood in some religions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rahula|first=Walpola|authorlink=Walpola Rahula|title=[[What the Buddha Taught]]|publisher=Grove Press|year=1974|page=1|isbn=978-0802130310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anantarika-karma==

Anantarika-karma in [[Theravada Buddhism]] is a heinous crime, which through [[karma|karmic process]] brings immediate disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Work of Culture: Symbolic Transformation in Psychoanalysis and Anthropology |author= Gananath Obeyesekere|year=1990|publisher=[[University of Chicago]]|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-nLv_IiMTA4C&amp;pg=PA305&amp;lpg=PA305|isbn=978-0-226-61599-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3269825 The Buddha's Bad Karma: A Problem in the History of Theravada Buddhism]  Jonathan S.

{{Roman Catholicism}}
'''Catholic theology of sexuality''', like [[Catholic theology]] in general, is drawn from [[natural law]], [[Biblical canon|canonical]] [[Catholic Bible|scripture]], [[divine revelation]], and [[sacred tradition]], as interpreted authoritatively by the [[magisterium]] of the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CCC|pp=74|end=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{CCC|pp=1953|end=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexual morality]] evaluates sexual behavior according to standards laid out by [[Catholic moral theology]], and often provides general principles by which Catholics are able to evaluate whether specific actions meet these standards. Much of the Church's detailed [[Catholic theology|doctrines]] derive from the principle that "sexual pleasure is morally disordered when sought for itself, isolated from its procreative and unitive [between spouses] purposes".&lt;ref name=lust/&gt; At the same time, the Bishops at Vatican II decreed that the essential procreative end of marriage does not make "the other purposes of matrimony of less account."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html|title=Gaudium et spes|last=|first=|date=|website=www.vatican.va|at=50|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church teaches that human life and human sexuality are inseparable.&lt;ref&gt;{{CCC|pp=2331-2400}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Catholics believe [[God in Christianity|God]] created human beings in his own [[Image of God|image]] and likeness and that he found everything he created to be "very good,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Genesis|1:31|DRA}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Catholic Church teaches that human body and sex must likewise be good. The Church considers the expression of love between [[husband]] and [[wife]] to be an elevated form of human activity, joining husband and wife in complete, mutual self-giving, and opening their relationship to new life. As [[Pope Paul VI]] wrote in ''[[Humanae vitae]]'', “The sexual activity, in which husband and wife are intimately and chastely united with one another, through which human life is transmitted, is, as the recent Council recalled, ‘noble and worthy.’”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html |title=Humanae Vitae - Encyclical Letter of His Holiness Paul VI on the regulation of birth, 25 July 1968 |author=Paul VI |date=25 July 1968 |publisher= |accessdate=6 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xI2Wz6n5?url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html |archivedate=19 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In cases in which sexual expression is sought outside sacramental marriage, or in which the procreative function of sexual expression within marriage is deliberately frustrated (e.g., the use of artificial [[contraception]]), the Catholic Church expresses [[Grave matter|grave]] moral concern.

The Church teaches that sexual intercourse has a [[Teleology|purpose]]; and that outside marriage it is contrary to its purpose. According to the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', "conjugal love ... aims at a deeply personal unity, a unity that, beyond union in one flesh, leads to forming one heart and soul",&lt;ref&gt;{{CCC|1643}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the marriage bond is to be a sign of the [[Love of God (Christianity)|love]] between God and humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{CCC|1617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among what are considered sins gravely contrary to [[chastity]] are masturbation, fornication, pornography, homosexual practices,&lt;ref&gt;{{CCC|pp=2351-2357}}&lt;/ref&gt; and artificial [[contraception]].&lt;ref name="CCC2370"/&gt; Procurement of [[abortion]], in addition to being considered [[grave matter]], carries, under the conditions envisaged by [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]], the penalty of [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunication]], "by the very commission of the offense".&lt;ref&gt;{{CCC|2272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural law===
{{expand section|date=June 2016}}
[[Natural law]] ({{lang-la|lex naturalis}}) is an [[ethics|ethical]] theory that posits the existence of a law whose content is set by [[nature]] and that therefore has validity everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;"Natural Law," ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences''.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite [[paganism|pagan]] associations with natural law theory, a number (though not all) of the early [[Church Fathers]] sought to incorporate it into [[Christian theology]].

In an influential passage of the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the rational creature is subject to Divine providence in the most 
excellent way, in so far as it partakes of a share of providence, 
by being provident both for itself and for others. Wherefore it has 
a share of the Eternal Reason, whereby it has a natural inclination 
to its proper act and end: and this participation of the eternal law 
in the rational creature is called the natural law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0023/_P6Z.HTM|title=Summa Theologica: text - IntraText CT|publisher=|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Natural law is a basic source for Catholic theology of sexuality.

===Scripture===
The [[Genesis creation narratives]] provide insights into [[Christian anthropology|anthropology]] that inform Catholic theology of sexuality.  The following verses are frequently cited in Catholic studies of sexual morality:

* 1:27: "And God created man to his own image: to the image of God he created him: male and female he created them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Genesis|1:27|DRA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2:21–25: "Then the Lord God cast a deep sleep upon Adam: and when he was fast asleep, he took one of his ribs, and filled up flesh for it. And the Lord God built the rib which he took from Adam into a woman: and brought her to Adam. And Adam said: This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man. Wherefore a man shall leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they shall be two in one flesh. And they were both naked: to wit, Adam and his wife: and were not ashamed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Genesis|2:21–25|DRA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 3:16: "To the woman also he said: I will multiply thy sorrows, and thy conceptions: in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children, and thou shalt be under thy husband's power, and he shall have dominion over thee."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Genesis|3:16|DRA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Two of the [[Ten Commandments in Catholic theology|Ten Commandments]] directly address sexual morality, forbidding [[Thou shalt not commit adultery|adultery]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Exodus|20:14|DRA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Deuteronomy|5:18|DRA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thou shalt not covet|covetousness]] of the wife of one's neighbor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Exodus|20:17|DRA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Deuteronomy|5:21|DRA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jesus]] comments on these commandments in the [[Gospel of Matthew]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;You have heard that it was said to them of old: Thou shalt not commit adultery. But I say to you, that whosoever shall look on a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|5:27-28|DRA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Jesus also makes reference to the passages from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] in his teachings on marriage in Matthew:&lt;blockquote&gt;Have ye not read, that he who made man from the beginning, Made them male and female? And he said: For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they two shall be in one flesh. Therefore now they are not two, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let no man put asunder. They [the Pharisees] say to him: Why then did Moses command to give a bill of divorce, and to put away? He [Jesus] saith to them: Because Moses by reason of the hardness of your heart permitted you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|Matthew|19:4-8|DRA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Patristic theology===
{{expand section|date=June 2016}}[[Augustine of Hippo]], considered a [[saint]] and church father by the Catholic Church, having lived a [[hedonism|hedonistic]] lifestyle in his early youth, later followed the strictly [[dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] religion of [[Manicheanism]], which was deeply hostile to the material world, despising [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]]. Eventually, under the influence of his [[Catholic Church|Catholic Christian]] mother Monica, Augustine converted to Christianity, and later wrote movingly of this conversion in his ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'', including details of the sexually-related aspects. The following passage from his autobiography describes a critical turning point in his change of sexual morality:
&lt;blockquote&gt;So quickly I returned to the place where Alypius was sitting; for there had I put down the volume of the apostles, when I rose thence. I grasped, opened, and in silence read that paragraph on which my eyes first fell: "Not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying; but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof." [Romans 13:13-14] No further would I read, nor did I need...&lt;ref&gt;St. Augustine, Confessions, Book 8, Chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Medieval theology===
{{expand section|date=June 2016}}
[[Thomas Aquinas]] dealt with sexual morality as an aspect of the virtue of temperance, and incorporates Scripture throughout his account. In his ''Summa Theologiae'' he writes about chastity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The word "chastity" is employed in two ways. First, properly; and thus it is a special virtue having a special matter, namely the concupiscences relating to venereal pleasures. Secondly, the word "chastity" is employed metaphorically: for just as a mingling of bodies conduces to venereal pleasure which is the proper matter of chastity and of lust its contrary vice, so too the spiritual union of the mind with certain things conduces to a pleasure which is the matter of a spiritual chastity metaphorically speaking, as well as of a spiritual fornication likewise metaphorically so called. For if the human mind delight in the spiritual union with that to which it behooves it to be united, namely God, and refrains from delighting in union with other things against the requirements of the order established by God, this may be called a spiritual chastity, according to 2 Cor. 11:2, "I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ." If, on the other hand, the mind be united to any other things whatsoever, against the prescription of the Divine order, it will be called spiritual fornication, according to Jer. 3:1, "But thou hast prostituted thyself to many lovers." Taking chastity in this sense, it is a general virtue, because every virtue withdraws the human mind from delighting in a union with unlawful things. Nevertheless, the essence of this chastity consists principally in charity and the other theological virtues, whereby the human mind is united to God.&lt;ref&gt;St. Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa Theologiae'', II-II, Question 151, Article 2, corp.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In her ''[[Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven]]'', [[Uta Ranke-Heinemann]] says that three discussions of marriage in the New Testament (Matthew 19, I Corinthians 7, and Ephesians 5:22-32) do not refer to generating children, which later became consistently emphasized in Catholic moral doctrine as the primary purpose of sexual relations, although, according to her, those texts does not indicate that conceiving children is excluded in marriage.&lt;ref name=Eunuchs&gt;{{cite book|first=Uta| last=Ranke-Heinemann| title=Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven|publisher=[[Doubleday Publishing]]| year=1990|url=https://openlibrary.org/books/OL21337088M/Eunuchs_for_the_kingdom_of_heaven}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|43}} The view that marriage is primarily intended for the purpose of procreation dominated early Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salzman|first1=Todd A.|last2=Lawler|first2=Michael G.|title=The Sexual Person: Toward a Renewed Catholic Anthropology|date=2008|publisher=Georgetown University Press|isbn=9781589017269|page=175|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p8nrAR3Oi1QC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and held by many [[Church Fathers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Obach|first1=Robert|title=The Catholic Church on Marital Intercourse: From St. Paul to Pope John Paul II|date=2008|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9780739130896|pages=22–26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yP_Sbtq_XZgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Hunter|editor1-first=David G.|title=Marriage in the Early Church|date=2001|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|isbn=9781579108274|pages=12–28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3bZKAwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the entire Middle Ages, the question of when intercourse was allowed and when it was not, was very important. Intercourse was prohibited on all Sundays and all the many feast days, as well as the 20 days before Christmas, the 40 days before Easter, and often the 20 days before Pentecost, as well as three or more days before receiving [[Eucharist|Communion]] (which at that time was offered only a few times a year). These forbidden days altogether totaled about 40% of each year.&lt;ref name=Eunuchs/&gt;{{rp|138}} Some church leaders warned believers that children conceived on holy days would be born leprous, epileptic, diabolically possessed, or crippled. Penalties of 20 to 40 days of strict fasting on bread and water were imposed on transgressors.&lt;ref name=Eunuchs/&gt;{{rp|139–140}} Intercourse was forbidden during the menstrual period and after childbirth, since "physicians mistakenly believed that the blood of a menstruating woman or one who has just given birth was poisonous".&lt;ref name=Eunuchs/&gt;{{rp|138}} It was also forbidden during pregnancy, with concern for protecting the fetus as the main reason.&lt;ref name=Eunuchs/&gt;{{rp|151–152}} "Christian theologians", including [[Pope Gregory I]], held that abstinence should continue until a baby was weaned.&lt;ref name=Eunuchs/&gt;{{rp|143}}

Scholastic theologians from the 11th to 13th centuries shifted the time scheme to motives; the desire to procreate with "joy in a new servant of God" was considered the best motive for intercourse.&lt;ref name=Eunuchs/&gt;{{rp|143}} [[Bertold of Regensburg]] considered a woman innocent if she was forced to do it on the prohibited times by her husband and she did not will it.&lt;ref name=Eunuchs/&gt;{{rp|144}} Because intercourse was only allowed for procreative reasons, various [[penitential]]s (rule books) also forbade intercourse between sterile or older partners, although never assigning a penalty.&lt;ref name=Eunuchs/&gt;{{rp|151}} Heinemann says that oral and anal intercourse were often punished by more years of penance than for premeditated murder, as they prevented conception from occurring.&lt;ref name=Eunuchs/&gt;{{rp|149}} Although practice varied, menstruating women were often forbidden to attend Mass or receive Communion, in which the [[Latin Church]] took a more moderate stance than the [[Eastern Churches]].&lt;ref name=Eunuchs/&gt;{{rp|24}} Since the blood from childbirth was believed more harmful than menstrual blood, the Synod of Trier (1227) ruled that women who had just given birth had to be "reconciled with the Church" before they allowed to enter church. They often could not buried in the cemetery if they died in childbirth before had undergone a purifying ritual, a policy which was rejected by several synods.&lt;ref name=Eunuchs/&gt;{{rp|25}} The [[Council of Trent]] (1566), and several synods after that, did not impose abstinence from intercourse on certain times as an "obligation", but as an "admonition".&lt;ref name=Eunuchs/&gt;{{rp|145}}

===Early modern theology===
{{expand section|date=June 2016}}
In the [[Counter-Reformation]] and early modern periods, theologians continued to write on issues relating to sexual morality and marriage, one example being Giovanni Maria Chiericato (Joannes Clericati) in his ''Decisiones de Matrimonio''.

==Teachings on specific subjects==
{{expand section|Specific subsections in need of expansion are marked with small tags|date=June 2016|small=no}}

===Adultery===
{{expand section|date=June 2016}}
One of the [[Ten Commandments#Text of the Ten Commandments|ten commandments]] states: "Do not commit adultery".&lt;ref&gt;{{CCC|2072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that two partners commit adultery when they have sexual relations, even transient ones, while at least one of them is married to another party. There, adultery is defined as an injustice because it is an injury of the covenant of the marriage bond, a transgression of the other spouse, an undermining of the institution of marriage and a compromising of the welfare of children who need their parents' stable union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm CCC 2380-2381]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chastity===
{{expand section|date=June 2016}}
The Catholic Church defines [[chastity]] as the virtue that moderates the sexual appetite.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa Theologia'' I-II q. 60 a. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Catholic Encyclopedia'', "Chastity"&lt;/ref&gt; Unmarried Catholics express chastity through [[sexual abstinence]].  Sexual intercourse within marriage is considered chaste when it retains the twofold significance of union and procreation.&lt;ref&gt;''Humanae vitae'' 12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope John Paul II]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At the center of the spirituality of marriage, therefore, there lies chastity not only as a moral virtue (formed by love), but likewise as a virtue connected with the gifts of the Holy Spirit—above all, the gift of respect for what comes from God (''donum pietatis''). This gift is in the mind of the author of the Ephesians when he exhorts married couples to "defer to one another out of reverence for Christ" (Eph 5:21). So the interior order of married life, which enables the manifestations of affection to develop according to their right proportion and meaning, is a fruit not only of the virtue which the couple practice, but also of the gifts of the Holy Spirit  with which they cooperate.&lt;ref&gt;Pope John Paul II, General Audience, Wednesday, November 14, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because sex is considered chaste only within context of marriage, it has come to be called the "nuptial act" in Catholic discourse. Among Catholics, the nuptial act is considered to be the conjoining of a man and a woman through sexual intercourse, considered an act of love between two married persons, and is considered in this way, a gift from God. When discussing chastity, the ''Catechism'' lists several transgressions and sins against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{CCC|pp=2337-2350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contraception===
{{Further information|Christian views on contraception#Roman Catholicism}}
The Church has been opposed to contraception for as far back as one can historically trace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/ANSWERS/FKBCONTR.HTM | title =Fathers Know Best Contraception |publisher =EWTN|accessdate =2009-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.byzantines.net/misc/sex.htm | title =Contraception/Birth Control |publisher =Byzantines.net|accessdate =2009-03-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419053817/http://www.byzantines.net/misc/sex.htm |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2008-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many early Catholic [[Church Fathers]] made statements condemning the use of contraception including [[John Chrysostom]], [[Jerome]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Hippolytus of Rome]], [[Augustine of Hippo]] and various others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/ANSWERS/FKBCONTR.HTM|title="This Rock" Magazine|publisher=|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therealpresence.org/archives/Abortion_Euthanasia/Abortion_Euthanasia_004.htm|title=Fr.

[[Pope Paul VI]], rejecting the majority report of the 1963-66 [[Pontifical Commission on Birth Control]], confirmed the Catholic Church's traditional teaching on contraception, defined as "every action which, whether in anticipation of the conjugal act, or in its accomplishment, or in the development of its natural consequences, proposes, whether as an end or as a means, to render procreation impossible",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html |title=Humanae Vitae - Encyclical Letter of His Holiness Paul VI on the regulation of birth, 25 July 1968 |author=Paul VI |date=25 July 1968 |publisher= |accessdate=6 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xI2Wz6n5?url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html |archivedate=19 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; declaring it evil, and excluded.

Restricting sexual activity to times when [[Fertilisation|conception]] is unlikely (the "[[rhythm method]]" and similar practices) is not deemed sinful,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html |title=''Humanae vitae'' |author=Pope Paul VI |date=25 July 1968 |accessdate=6 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xI2Wz6n5?url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html |archivedate=19 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but only when it is practiced for "just reasons" and not "motivated by selfishness".&lt;ref&gt;{{CCC|pp=2368-2369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Paul II said in ''[[Familiaris consortio]]'',
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Thus the innate language that expresses the total reciprocal self-giving of husband and wife is overlaid, through contraception, by an objectively contradictory language, namely, that of not giving oneself totally to the other. This leads not only to a positive refusal to be open to life but also to a falsification of the inner truth of conjugal love, which is called upon to give itself in personal totality.... the difference, both anthropological and moral, between contraception and recourse to the rhythm of the cycle . . . involves in the final analysis two irreconcilable concepts of the human person and of human sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_jp-ii_exh_19811122_familiaris-consortio_en.html|title=''Familiaris consortio''|date=22 November 1981|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In January 2015, during his return flight from a visit to the [[Philippines]], Pope Francis was asked by a German journalist for his thoughts on the findings of some polls that most Filipinos think the population growth in the country, with each woman having on average three children, is one of the chief reasons for its poverty, and that many there disagree with Catholic teaching on contraception. He replied that the key is "responsible parenthood":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some people think that—excuse my expression here—that in order to be good Catholics we have to be like rabbits. No. Responsible parenthood. This is clear and that is why in the Church there are marriage groups, there are experts in this matter, there are pastors, one can search; and I know so many ways that are licit and that have helped this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holdren |first1=Alan |last2=Gagliarducci |first2=Andrea |title=Full text of Pope's in-flight interview from Manila to Rome|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/full-text-of-popes-in-flight-interview-from-manila-to-rome-84716/|newspaper=Catholic News Agency|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Issues surrounding the Catholic Church and AIDS became highly controversial since 1990, primarily because many prominent Catholic leaders publicly declared their opposition to the use of condoms as a disease preventative. Other issues involve religious participation in global health care services and collaboration with secular organizations such as UNAIDS and the World Health Organization.

In November 2010 Pope Benedict said that it was a responsible act, though still not a truly moral solution, to use condoms in some very special cases as a device for the prevention of disease. He gave male prostitutes as an example, where the purpose is to "reduce the risk of infection" from [[HIV]].&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt; While still believing that contraceptive devices interfere with the creation of life, the Pope stated that in that particular case, it can be a responsible act to raise awareness of the nature of such an act, and as a benefit, to avoid death and save life, though only as a first step, not a truly moral solution, before convincing the male prostitute of a truly moral solution, which means ceasing prostitution and sexual activity outside of marriage. There was some confusion at first whether the statement applied only to homosexual prostitutes and thus not to heterosexual intercourse at all. However, [[Federico Lombardi]], spokesman of the Vatican, clarified that it applied to heterosexual and transsexual prostitutes, both male and female, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/24/world/europe/24pope.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Rachel | last1=Donadio | first2=Laurie | last2=Goodstein | title=Vatican Confirms Shift on Condoms as AIDS Prevention | date=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also clarified that, in the interview, the Pope did not reverse the Church's centuries-old prohibition on contraceptive use in the context of heterosexual sexual acts, which the Church states must normally be open to the transmission of life,&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Jonathan Wynne-Jones |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/the-pope/8148944/The-Pope-drops-Catholic-ban-on-condoms-in-historic-shift.html |title=The Pope drops Catholic ban on condoms in historic shift |publisher=The Tepegraph |date=20 November 2010 |accessdate=20 November 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he did not reverse his positions on homosexual acts and prostitution either.

===Fornication===
{{expand section|date=June 2016}}
The Catholic Church disapproves of [[fornication]] (sexual intercourse between two people not married to each other), calling it "gravely contrary to the dignity of persons and of human sexuality".&lt;ref&gt;{{CCC|2353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homosexuality===
{{Main article|Homosexuality and Roman Catholicism}}

The ''Catechism'' devotes a separate section to [[homosexuality]] within its explanation of the [[Ten Commandments|sixth commandment]]. The Church distinguishes between "homosexual attractions", which are ''not'' considered sinful, and "homosexual acts", which ''are'' considered sinful. Like all heterosexual acts outside of marriage, homosexual acts are considered sins against this commandment. The ''Catechism'' states that they "violate natural law, cannot bring forth life, and do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. Under no circumstances can they be approved."&lt;ref name="CCC2357"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Essential Catholic Catechism|last=Schreck|first=Alan|year=1999|publisher=Servant Publications|isbn=1-56955-128-6|page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scrimenti"/&gt; The Church teaches that a homosexual inclination is "objectively disordered" and can be a great trial for the person for whom the Church teaches must be "accepted with respect, compassion and sensitivity&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided."&lt;ref name="CCC2357"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catholic Christianity|last=Kreeft|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Kreeft|year=2001|publisher=Ignatius Press|isbn=0-89870-798-6|page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scrimenti"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Scrimenti|editor1-first=Stephen M.|title=Catholic Social Ethics|date=2005|publisher=Xulon Press|isbn=1-597811-19X|pages=149–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The homosexual person is, according to the Church, "called to chastity". They are instructed to practice the virtues of "self-mastery" that teaches "inner freedom" using the support of friends, prayer and grace found in the sacraments of the Church.&lt;ref name="CCC2357"/&gt; These tools are meant to help the homosexually inclined person to "gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection", which is a state to which all Christians are called.&lt;ref name="CCC2357"&gt;{{CCC|pp=2357-2359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 August 2018 [[Pope Francis]] said in Ireland, that homosexual peope exist in whole history of human mankind.  He teaches catholic parents to talk with their homosexual children and that they are part of their families and shouldn't "thrown out" of family. &lt;ref&gt;[https://rp-online.de/panorama/ausland/papst-eltern-sollen-ihre-homosexuellen-kinder-nicht-verurteilen_aid-32151641 Rheinische Post: Eltern sollen ihre homosexuellen Kinder nicht verurteilen (german)]&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 August 2018 Pope Francis press statement declares, that homosexuality is not an illness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/gesellschaft/papst-franziskus-vatikan-zieht-aeusserung-zu-homosexuellen-kindern-zurueck-a-1225215.html Spiegel.de: Vatikan zieht umstrittene Äußerung zu homosexuellen Kindern zurück]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tagesspiegel.de/weltspiegel/katholische-kirche-vatikan-aendert-papst-zitate-zu-homosexuellen-neigungen-von-kindern/22957736.html Tagesspiegel.de:Vatikan ändert Papst-Zitate zu homosexuellen Neigungen von Kindern ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/nach-kritik-vatikan-relativiert-papst-aeusserungen-zu.2932.de.html?drn:news_id=918704 Deutschlandfunk.de: Vatikan relativiert Papst-Äußerungen zu Homosexualität], abgerufen am 28.

===Lust===
{{expand section|date=June 2016}}
The Catholic Church disapproves of [[lust]]: "Sexual pleasure is morally disordered when sought for itself, isolated from its procreative and unitive purposes".&lt;ref name=lust&gt;{{CCC|2351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Church disapproves of [[masturbation]].&lt;ref name=CCC2352&gt;{{CCC|2352}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]], one of the most prominent [[Doctor of the Church#Catholicism|Doctors of the Catholic Church]], wrote that masturbation was an "unnatural [[Vice#Roman Catholicism|vice]]" which is a species of [[Lust#Catholicism|lust]]", but that it is a less serious form than [[Bestiality#Religious perspectives|bestiality]], which is "the most serious", and than [[sodomy]], which is the next most serious:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Summa Theologica]]'' [http://newadvent.org/summa/3154.htm#article11 IIª-IIae, q. 154 a. 12 ad 4] ([http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/sth3146.html#45233 in Latin])&lt;/ref&gt; "By procuring pollution [i.e., ejaculation apart from intercourse], without any copulation, for the sake of venereal pleasure [...] pertains to the sin of '[[Unclean spirit#Pneumata plana|uncleanness]]' which some call '[[effeminacy]]' [Latin: ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dmollio mollitiem]'', lit.

More recently, from the ''[[Youcat]]'':

{{quote|409 Masturbation is an offense against love, because it makes the excitement of sexual pleasure an end in itself and uncouples it from the holistic unfolding of love between a man and a woman. That is why “sex with yourself” is a contradiction in terms.

The Church does not demonize masturbation, but she warns against trivializing it. In fact many young people and adults are in danger of becoming isolated in their consumption of lewd pictures, films, and Internet services instead of finding love in a personal relationship. Loneliness can lead to a blind alley in which masturbation becomes an addiction. Living by the motto "For sex I do not need anyone; I will have it myself, however and whenever I need it" makes nobody happy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ignatius.com/promotions/youcat/youcat_faq.html#masturbation|title=FAQ - YOUCAT.us|publisher=|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Catholic Church teaching, "to form an equitable judgment about the subjects' moral responsibility and to guide pastoral action, one must take into account the affective immaturity, force of acquired habit, conditions of anxiety, or other psychological or social factors that lessen or even extenuate moral culpability."&lt;ref name=CCC2352/&gt;

===Pornography===

'''Chacmool''' (also spelled '''chac-mool''') is the term used to refer to a particular form of [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerican]] sculpture depicting a reclining figure with its head facing 90 degrees from the front, supporting itself on its elbows and supporting a bowl or a disk upon its stomach. These figures possibly symbolised slain warriors carrying offerings to the gods; the bowl upon the chest was used to hold sacrificial offerings, including [[pulque]], [[tamale]]s, [[tortilla]]s, [[tobacco]], turkeys, feathers and incense. In an [[Aztec]] example the receptacle is a [[cuauhxicalli]] (a stone bowl to receive [[human sacrifice in Aztec culture|sacrificed human hearts]]).  Chacmools were often associated with sacrificial stones or thrones.&lt;ref name="MillerTaube93-03,p60"&gt;Miller and Taube 1993, 2003, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aztec chacmools bore water imagery and were associated with [[Tlaloc]], the rain god. Their symbolism placed them on the frontier between the physical and supernatural realms, as intermediaries with the gods. The chacmool form of sculpture first appeared around the 9th century AD in the [[Valley of Mexico]] and the northern [[Yucatán Peninsula]].

==Form==
The chacmool is a distinctive form of Mesoamerican sculpture representing a reclining figure with its head facing 90 degrees from the front, leaning on its elbows and supporting a bowl or a disk upon its chest.&lt;ref name="MillerTaube93-03,p60"/&gt; There is great variation among individual chacmools, with some possessing heads that are right-facing and others left-facing, and some with the heads facing upwards; some examples have movable heads. The figure may be lying on its back or on its side and the abdomen can be sunken below the level of the chest and knees or at the same level. Some chacmools were raised upon rectangular bases. Some of the figures are richly attired whilst others are almost naked.&lt;ref name="LopezLopez01p60"&gt;López Austin and López Luján 2001, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chacmools of Chichen Itza and Tula depict young men with warrior attributes, while the chacmools of [[Michoacán]] depict elderly men with wrinkled faces and erect penises.&lt;ref name="LopezLopez01p60"/&gt; A chacmool from [[Guácimo (canton)|Guácimo]], Costa Rica, combines human and [[jaguars in Mesoamerican cultures|jaguar]] features and grips a bowl.&lt;ref name="Solano210212"&gt;Solano 21 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The face of the figure looks upwards and the bowl was apparently used to grind foodstuffs.&lt;ref name="Solano260212"&gt;Solano 26 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A wide variety of materials were used to sculpt chacmools, including [[limestone]] and hard [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] and [[igneous rock|igneous]] rock types. Other materials employed include ceramic and cement.&lt;ref name="LopezLopez01p60"/&gt;

==Discovery and naming==
The ancient name for these type of sculptures is unknown. The name "chacmool" is attributed to [[Augustus Le Plongeon]], who excavated one of the statues at [[Chichen Itza]] in 1875. Le Plongeon believed the statue, which he had found buried beneath the Platform of the Eagles and the Jaguars, depicted a former ruler of Chichen Itza. Le Plongeon named the statue "chaacmol", which he translated from the Maya as "thundering paw." Le Plongeon's sponsor, Stephen Salisbury of Worcester, Massachusetts, published Le Plongeon's find, but revised the spelling to "Chac-Mool."&lt;ref&gt;Salisbury 1877, p.80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Plongeon sought permission from Mexico's president to display the statue at the [[Centennial Exposition|Centennial Exhibition]] in Philadelphia in 1876, a request that was denied. In 1877 the Yucatecan government seized the statue and brought it to Mérida. Weeks later Yucatán turned over the statue to the federal government, which brought it to Mexico City to the [[National Museum of Anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;Desmond 1988, chapters 5 and 6&lt;/ref&gt; Museum worker Jesús Sanchez realised that the Chichen Itza sculpture was stylistically similar to two sculptures from central Mexico and the wide occurrence of the form within Mesoamerica was first recognised.&lt;ref name="Miller85p7"&gt;Miller 1985, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th century discovery of chacmools in both central Mexico and the Yucatán Peninsula helped to promote the idea of a [[Toltec]] empire although the chacmool sculptures may have originated in the Maya region.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1986, 1996, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the name ''chacmool'' was inappropriately applied, it has become a useful label to link stylistically similar sculptures from different regions and periods without imposing a unified interpretation.&lt;ref name="Miller85p7"/&gt;

==Distribution==
[[File:ChacmolTlaxRegMus.JPG|thumb|300px|A Chacmool in the regional museum of Tlaxcala.]]
Examples of chacmool sculptures have been found widely across Mesoamerica from [[Michoacan]] in [[Mexico]] down to [[El Salvador]]. The earliest examples date from the Terminal Classic period of [[Mesoamerican chronology]] (c. AD 800–900).&lt;ref name="MillerTaube93-03,p60"/&gt; Examples are known from the Postclassic Aztec capital of [[Tenochtitlan]], from the central Mexican city of [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]] and from the [[Maya city]] of [[Chichen Itza]] in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;Read and González 2000, pp.58–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen chacmools are known from Chichen Itza and twelve from Tula.&lt;ref name="Miller85p7"/&gt; The chacmool from the palace at Tula is dated to the Early Postclassic (c. AD 900–1200).&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1986, 1996, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Further examples are known from [[Acolman]], [[Cempoala]], [[Michoacan]], [[Querétaro]] and [[Tlaxcala]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1985, p. 7. López Austin and López Luján 2001, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Chichen Itza, only five of the fourteen chacmools were securely confirmed in architectural contexts, those in the [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|Castillo]], the Chacmool Temple, the North Colonnade, the Temple of the Little Tables and the Temple of the Warriors. The rest were found interred in or near important structures.&lt;ref name="Miller85p9"/&gt; The five that were found in secure architectural contexts were all placed within entrance areas near a ritual seat or throne.&lt;ref name="Miller85p11"&gt;Miller 1985, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The chacmools in Tula also had an association with thrones or raised seating platforms, either in front of the throne or at the entrance to a chamber containing a throne.&lt;ref name="Miller85p12"&gt;Miller 1985, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two chacmools have been recovered that were associated with the [[Templo Mayor|Great Temple]] of Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital. The first was discovered in 1943, on the junction of Venustiano Carranza and Pino Suarez, about two blocks south of the temple itself. The second chacmool was excavated in the sacred precinct.&lt;ref name="Miller85p15"&gt;Miller 1985, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the only fully polychrome chacmool that has been recovered anywhere;&lt;ref name="Miller85p15"/&gt; it had an open mouth and exposed teeth and stood in front of the temple of [[Tlaloc]], the Aztec rain god; its sculpted bowl probably received heart and blood sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;Read and González 2000, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; This latter sculpture is by far the older of the two.&lt;ref name="Miller85p15"/&gt;

Chacmools have been reported as far south as the Maya city of [[Quiriguá]], near the Guatemalan border with Honduras.&lt;ref&gt;Martin &amp; Grube 2000, p.225.&lt;/ref&gt; The Quiriguá chacmool most likely dated to the Postclassic period and is stylistically similar to those of Tula rather than Chichen Itza.&lt;ref name="Miller85p14"/&gt; Two chacmools were reported from [[Tazumal]], a Maya site in western [[El Salvador]].&lt;ref&gt;Cobos 1994, 1998, pp. 74, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; A chacmool was excavated at [[Las Mercedes (archaeological site, Costa Rica)|Las Mercedes]] in [[Guácimo (canton)|Guácimo]], Costa Rica.&lt;ref name="Solano210212"/&gt;

==Dating and origin==
[[File:Chac mool.jpg|thumb|300px|An Aztec chacmool from the [[Templo Mayor|Great Temple of Tenochtitlan]].]]
The oldest chacmool ever discovered was the Terminal Classic. The form was unknown in such important Mesoamerican cities as [[Teotihuacan]] and [[Tikal]]. After the first appearance of the form, it was rapidly disseminated throughout Mesoamerica, spreading as far south as [[Costa Rica]].&lt;ref name="Miller85p7"/&gt; Although a central Mexican origin is generally assumed, there are no antecedents pre-dating the [[Toltec]]s and the form is not present in central Mexican [[Mesoamerican literature|codices]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1985, pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The positioning and context of the chacmool form do have antecedents in Classic [[Ancient Maya art|Maya art]] and art historian [[Mary Miller (art historian)|Mary Ellen Miller]] has argued that the chacmool developed out of Classic period Maya imagery.&lt;ref name="Miller85p8"&gt;Miller 1985, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; No central Mexican chacmool has been found that clearly predates the Chichen Itza examples. However, Tula and Chichen Itza may have developed simultaneously with rapid communication of the chacmool form from one city to the other.&lt;ref name="Miller85p14"&gt;Miller 1985, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The wider variety of chacmool forms at Chichen Itza has also been used to support the development of the form there; no two possess identical form, dress and proportions. At Tula the chacmools have a standardised form with little variation in position or proportions.&lt;ref name="Miller85p14"&gt;Miller 1985, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller has proposed that the chacmool developed out of Classic Maya iconography and underwent a transition into three dimensional sculpture at Chichen Itza, perhaps spurred by the influence of central Mexican sculptural forms.&lt;ref name="Miller85p17"/&gt; A chacmool from Costa Rica was dated by the excavators to approximately AD 1000.&lt;ref name="Solano260212"/&gt;

== Aztec Chacmool ==
During the excavation of of the 1390 [[Templo Mayor]], the only fully polychrome chacmool to be found at that site was in its original context on the top level of the [[Tlāloc|Tlaloc]] side (the side dedicated to the rain god) of the temple.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Moctezuma, Eduardo Matos. “Archaeology &amp; Symbolism in Aztec Mexico: The Templo Mayor of Tenochtitlan.” ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'', vol. 53, no. 4, 1985, pp. 797–813. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1464276.&lt;/ref&gt; Because this chacmool statue sat in the same position as the sacrificial stone on the Huitzilopochtli side of the temple, "historical interpretations" are confirmed in the idea that this sculpture acted as a divine messenger, a link between the temple priest(s) and the god (in this case the rain god Tlaloc). &lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The pigment that remained upon this chacmool sculpture was crucial for the iconographic identification of the figure, as it does not contain any iconography or symbols associated with the rain god Tlaloc (the god with which this sculpture is associated at the Templo Mayor).&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;LUJÁN, LEONARDO LÓPEZ, and GIACOMO CHIARI. “Color in Monumental Mexica Sculpture.” ''RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics'', no. 61/62, 2012, pp. 330–342. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/23647839.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon this Aztec sculptures discovery, a color reconstruction was created as a result of the work involving a series of steps: the production of a line drawing of the statue, a diligent cleaning of the colored surfaces of the statue, and the establishment of spatial recognition by means of the use of "stereoscopic magnifying glasses and ultraviolet light."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Scholars determined that the Aztec chacmool discovered at the Templo Mayor did in fact contain representations of the rain god (Tlaloc) by recognizing similarities between "the circular gold pectoral medallion, the color combination on the petticoat . . . the black skin, the red hands and feet, and the white headdress and bangles," all of which suggest similar stylistic and iconographic progression among earlier and later Mexica chacmool sculptures.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

A second chacmool discovery from the Templo Mayor and dating to a later period displays iconographic features which are distinct form the larger corpus of other figures but consistent with other sculptures found in the same context at the Templo Mayor.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/585dca25d537d2c42880ee0ff05370c9/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=18750&amp;diss=y|title=Containers of power: The Tlaloc vessels of the Templo Mayor as embodiments of the Aztec rain god - ProQuest|website=search.proquest.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other representations baring the distinct iconography include Tlaloc ritual vessels and bench reliefs. One of the distinct iconographic features is the representation of the eyes.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;López Austin, Alfredo. 1983. “The Masked God of Fire,” ''The Aztec Templo Mayor: a symposium at Dumbarton Oaks, 8th and 9th October 1983'', edited by Elizabeth 135 Hill Boone. Washington, D.C.: Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection: 257-292.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas Tlaloc's eyes are generally represented with a round goggle-like frame, the later chacmool, the vessels, and the bench relief feature a rectangular eye frame within which almond eyes are engraved. All three sculptures also include large fangs at the corners of the god's mouth.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; The ornaments worn by the later chacmool and depicted in the vessels and the bench relief of the Templo Mayor are also distinct rather than the characteristic earspools with a square plug and central dangal. These examples sport oversized circular spools. All three examples are also adorned with a multistrand, beaded collar in which one strand has larger beads that have been interpreted as hanging bells.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; The chacmool holds onto a ''cuauhxicalli'' vessel that also is engraved with the face of the god with the same rectangular eye and mouth features. &lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

==Interpretations==
[[File:Chac Mool dentro del templo de Kukulkán.jpg|thumb|300px|Chacmool inside the [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|Castillo pyramid of Chichen Itza]].]]
The meaning of the chacmool figures varied across time depending upon the geographical and cultural context.&lt;ref&gt;López Austin and López Luján 2001, pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Chacmools do not appear to have been worshipped, since they are never found within inner sanctuary of temples or shrines; it appears to have rather been a piece of religious paraphernalia used by the priesthood in the course of their duties. Three uses have generally been attributed to chacmools.&lt;ref name="LopezAustin&amp;LopezLujan01p62"&gt;López Austin and López Luján 2001, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first interpretation is that the chacmool is an offering table (or ''tlamanalco'') to receive gifts such as [[pulque]], [[tamale]]s, [[tortilla]]s, tobacco, turkeys, feathers and incense. The second is that the chacmool was a ''cuauhxicalli'' to receive blood and human hearts; this use is particularly relevant to the Aztecs, who used a ''cuauhxicalli'' bowl in place of the usual disc-altar. These bowls may have accepted these blood offerings directly or may have been holders for portable ''cuauhxicalli'' bowls that were placed within them. A chacmool from Tlaxcala has a bloodied heart sculpted on the underside, supporting this interpretation.&lt;ref name="LopezAustin&amp;LopezLujan01p62"/&gt;

It has also been suggested that chacmools were used as a ''techcatl'', or sacrificial stone over which victims were stretched so their hearts could be cut from their chests. The ''[[Crónica Mexicayotl]]'' describes such a sacrificial stone as sculpted in the form of a person with a twisted head.&lt;ref&gt;López Austin and López Luján 2001, pp. 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Techcatl'' were not just used for human sacrifice, they were also used in the ''[[yacaxapotlaliztli]]'' ceremony, where the nose of a future ruler was pierced. Such rituals may also have been executed upon chacmools, and the presence of small nose jewels sculpted onto various chacmools at Chichen Itza and one at Tula has been used to support this idea.&lt;ref name="LopezAustin&amp;LopezLujan01p63"&gt;López Austin and López Luján 2001, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The backward reclining figure of the chacmool presents a defenceless, passive appearance and has been likened by Miller to the positioning of captives in Classic period Maya sculpture and painting. Bent elbows and knees are common in depictions of Maya captives; the full-frontal view of the face is rare in Maya art except among representations of captives.&lt;ref name="Miller85p8"/&gt; The form of the Chichen Itza chacmools lacks the typical traits of Maya deities and most scholars have assumed that the iconography of Maya chacmools is equivalent to that of the central Mexican examples. Eduard Seler commented in the early 1960s that chacmools in Chichen Itza tended to be located in temple antechambers, where the bowl or disc gripped by the figure served to receive pulque as an offering.&lt;ref name="Miller85p9"&gt;Miller 1985, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chacmools at Chichen Itza were found in a combination of chacmool, throne and serpent column; this chacmool-throne-serpent complex was associated with rulership during the Early Postclassic period.&lt;ref name="Miller85p11"/&gt; The original chacmool described by Le Plongeon in the 19th century included small images of the central Mexican deity Tlaloc on its [[Plug (jewellery)|ear ornaments]]. Among the Classic period Maya, such [[Human sacrifice in Maya culture|Tlaloc imagery was associated with war and human sacrifice]]. Associations between the rain god, war and human sacrifice may have continued into the Postclassic period as demonstrated by the chacmool within the Castillo at Chichen Itza, which bears small images of the Maya rain god [[Chaac]] on its ear ornaments.&lt;ref name="Miller85p17"&gt;Miller 1985, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The chacmools at Tula, with contextual similarity to those at Chichen Itza, probably also represent war captives.&lt;ref name="Miller85p12"/&gt;

The lack of the representation of chacmools in Central Mexican codices has led to them being associated with a great variety of deities by scholars, including [[Cinteotl]], [[Tezcatzoncatl]] and Tlaloc.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1985, pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Both of the chacmools from the Great Temple of Tenochtitlan were clearly associated with Tlaloc. The chacmool found two blocks south of the temple was sculpted with three images of the deity.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1985, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; These included an elaborate relief image of Tlaloc amongst aquatic symbols on the underside, one on the bowl that the figure grips and the last is the Tlaloc mask with characteristic goggles and fangs that is worn by the chacmool.&lt;ref name="Miller85p15"/&gt;

The fully polychrome chacmool found ''in situ'' in the Great Temple was associated with Tlaloc by its placement on the Tlaloc half of the double pyramid. A further Aztec chacmool was described in the 19th century; it is of uncertain origin but stylistically it is typical of Tenochtitlan. It is sculpted on the underside with aquatic imagery and the figure wears a goggle-and-fangs Tlaloc mask. Spanish observers reported the great quantity of human sacrifices during important ceremonies at the Great Temple and the chacmool was probably used during these rituals to symbolise the sacrificed captives as well as receive their blood.&lt;ref name="Miller85p15"/&gt;

The discs gripped by some chacmools may represent a [[Mirrors in Mesoamerican culture|mirror]]. Chacmools were placed in entrances in order to receive sacrificial offerings, including human blood and hearts. The aquatic imagery carved onto the underside of some of the figures symbolised that they were floating on water, on the frontier between the physical world and the supernatural realm. This suggests that chacmools acted as messengers between the mortal realm and that of the gods.&lt;ref name="Miller85p15"/&gt;

Costa Rican chacmools gripped sculpted bowls; these chacmools also served ceremonial purposes although the bowl was used to grind foodstuffs.&lt;ref name="Solano260212"/&gt;

==References in Contemporary Art and Literature==
The short story “Chac Mool” by Mexican novelist [[Carlos Fuentes]] is found in his book ''Los días enmascarados'', published in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Carballo 1955, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; A man named Filiberto buys a chacmool for his art collection,&lt;ref name="Filer84p477"&gt;Filer 1984, p. 477.&lt;/ref&gt; and discovers that the stone is slowly becoming flesh.&lt;ref&gt;Carballo 1955, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The idol eventually becomes fully human,&lt;ref name="Filer84p477"/&gt; dominating his life, causing flooding and other disasters. Filiberto dies by drowning.&lt;ref name="Filer84p477"/&gt; His story is found in a diary describing the terrors brought on by the idol,&lt;ref&gt;Brushwood 1982, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; and his plans to escape. According to the author, this short story was inspired by news reports from 1952 when the lending of a representation of the Maya rain deity to a Mexican exhibition in Europe had coincided with wet weather there.&lt;ref name="Filer84p477"/&gt;

[[Christianity]] has played an important role in Cuba's history. [[Cuba]] was discovered by [[Christopher Columbus]] a few days after he arrived to the New World in 1492. In 1511, colonization began when the Conquistador [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]] established the [[Catholic Church]] in Cuba with the early priest Fray [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] known commonly as "the Protector of the Indians".&lt;ref&gt;Ramos, Marcos A. ''Protestantism and Revolution in Cuba''. Miami: University of Miami, 1989. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Catholicism]], [[Protestantism]] came during the same time.

Catholicism was established early while Protestantism came later. "Protestantism did not permanently take hold in Cuba until the nineteenth century, though since the sixteenth century the country had been constantly visited by [[pirate]]s, [[Privateer|corsairs]] and [[Filibuster (military)|filibusters]], many of whom were Protestants".&lt;ref&gt;Ramos, Marcos A. ''Protestantism and Revolution in Cuba''. Miami: University of Miami, 1989. 20&lt;/ref&gt; In Cuba, the roots of Protestantism occurred around the same time as Christianity. The denominations of Catholicism and Protestantism have a significant influence in Cuban history.

==Catholicism in Cuba during the colonial period 1498–1898==
In 1512, Roman Catholicism came to Cuba with the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] being the first Catholic priests and the [[Franciscan]]s coming years later. The indigenous people were murdered as early as 1516: the bishop at the time Fray [[Bernardo de Mesa]] used lunar cycles and geographical situation as the reasoning for slavery of the Indians.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, John M. ''Between God and the party: religion and politics in revolutionary Cuba''. Tampa: University of South Florida Press, 1989. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the Indigenous Cubans were killed off with many Cubans being descendents of Spanish and African origin. Originally Catholicism catered to the Spanish because the Native Amerindians were killed as opposed to being converted.&lt;ref name="a1" &gt;Melton, J. Gordon, and Clifton L. Holland. "Cuba." ''Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices''. Ed. J. Gordon Melton and Martin Baumann. 2nd ed. Vol. 2. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2010. 833&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Leo X (r. 1513-1521) established the [[Diocese of Baracoa]], which included "all of Cuba" and the Spanish possessions of Louisiana and Florida. The name was changed to the [[Diocese of Santiago de Cuba]] in 1522.&lt;ref name="a1" /&gt;

Catholicism during this period was important because of the engagement in various aspects of life: baptisms, marriages, and funerals. The church fought the [[buccaneer]]s and combated immorality.&lt;ref name="a2" &gt;Perez, Louis, Luis Martinez-Fern, D. H. Figueredo. "Advisory Board." ''Encyclopedia of Cuba: People, History, Culture''. Santa Barbara, CA: Greenwood, 2003. 508&lt;/ref&gt; Authority of bishops during the colonial period compared to the highest civilian and military authority on the island; Schools and institutions of higher learning were created and administered by Church authorities.&lt;ref name="a2" /&gt;

Some of the bishops who were involved in education at this time were Bishop [[Jerónimo de Valdés]] (1705–29) and Bishop [[Pedro Agustín Morell de Santa Cruz]] (1753–68); the [[Royal and Pontifical University of Saint Jerome of Havana]] was inaugurated during Valdes' tenure in 1724.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, John M. ''Between God and the party: religion and politics in revolutionary Cuba''. Tampa: University of South Florida Press, 1989. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the Cuban island, the schools of San Ambrosio and San Francisco de Salles in [[Havana]] were established by the church from donations and an increase in church revenue.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, Louis, Luis Martinez-Fern, D. H. Figueredo. "Advisory Board." ''Encyclopedia of Cuba: People, History, Culture''. Santa Barbara, CA: Greenwood, 2003. 74&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church was pivotal in establishing education as a central pillar of Cuban nationality:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
During the early history of Cuba, the Catholic clergy seemed to have been the principal if not the only agents of education. In 1689, the College of San Ambrosio was founded in Havana for the purpose of preparing young men for the priesthood. As early as 1688, the city council of Havana petitioned the royal government to establish a university in that city, in order that young men desirous of pursuing higher studies might not be compelled to go to Europe to do so. After some years of preparation, the present [[University of Havana]] was founded in 1728. The rectors, vice rectors, counselors, and secretaries were all Dominicans.&lt;ref&gt;Melton, J. Gordon, and Clifton L. Holland. "Cuba." ''Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices''. Ed. J. Gordon Melton and Martin Baumann. 2nd ed. Vol. 2. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2010. 833-834&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Aside from education, the Catholic Church made other contributions throughout its early years in Cuba. Many historians consider the [[Golden Age]] – years 1750 to 1850 – to be of tremendous importance.&lt;ref name="a2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, John M. ''Between God and the party: religion and politics in revolutionary Cuba''. Tampa: University of South Florida Press, 1989. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  This period was significant in one aspect because of the increase of clergy. The Catholic Church's golden age in Cuba began with the tenure of Bishop [[Diego Evelino Hurtado de Compostela]] along with the first diocesan synod of 1680.&lt;ref name="a2" /&gt; The powerful influence in culture and politics, increase of native clergy, along with the multiplication of church building and seminaries marked the golden age.&lt;ref name="a2" /&gt;

The diversity of the church characterized the golden years. Of the 90 churches in Cuba at this time, half of them were headed by Native Cuban priests.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, John M. ''Between God and the party: religion and politics in revolutionary Cuba''. Tampa: University of South Florida Press, 1989. 1-172. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The Church was accepted in the urban centers because prior to this time the Spanish had used religion as a tool to influence the local Indians for the acquisition of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, John M. ''Between God and the party: religion and politics in revolutionary Cuba''. Tampa: University of South Florida Press, 1989. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protestants in Cuba during the colonial period 1498–1898==
The earliest accounts of Protestants in Cuba were in the 1500s. Protestants were not warmly welcomed in Cuba because of the Catholic Spanish colonization of Cuba. By the mid-1800s, the majority of Cubans had become more indifferent toward religion, while Spanish domination of the island was steadily gaining support from the Catholic clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Ramos, Marcos A. ''Protestantism and Revolution in Cuba''. Miami: University of Miami, 1989. 21&lt;/ref&gt; However, the richest history of Cuban Catholicism during the colonial period occurred in the 1800s. New immigration laws and other changes brought foreigners from various Protestant nations into Cuba for commerce and diplomacy primarily; the abolition of slavery was the agenda for some Protestants secondarily.&lt;ref name="a3" &gt;Perez, Louis, Luis Martinez-Fern, D. H. Figueredo. "Advisory Board." ''Encyclopedia of Cuba: People, History, Culture''. Santa Barbara, CA: Greenwood, 2003. 523-524&lt;/ref&gt; Protestants living in Cuba had religious beliefs that contended with religious rules of the land, but Protestants accommodated to the colonial regime differently.&lt;ref name="a3" /&gt;

While the 19th century placed Cuba in a more prominent position; the late 1800s particularly gave rise to Protestantism in Cuba. The first year of importance was the year 1866. In New York City, a Cuban expatriate named [[Juaquín de Palma]] founded the [[St. James' Episcopal Church and Parish House|St. James Episcopal Church]], with a primarily Cuban congregation.&lt;ref name="a4" &gt;Ramos, Marcos A. ''Protestantism and Revolution in Cuba''. Miami: University of Miami, 1989. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Cuban Protestants were discriminated against and after the [[Ten Years' War]] many Cubans were obliged to move to the United States; it was not until 1878 émigrés returned with certain freedoms promised from the Spanish government due to a peace treaty.&lt;ref name="a4" /&gt; Subtle changes were produced in 1869 from the declaration of religious tolerance.&lt;ref name="a5" &gt;Perez, Louis, Luis Martinez-Fern, D. H. Figueredo. "Advisory Board." ''Encyclopedia of Cuba: People, History, Culture''. Santa Barbara, CA: Greenwood, 2003. 524&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reverend Edward Kenney]] was the first Protestant minister to be given consent to perform religious duties; arriving from the United States, Kenney arrived in 1871 organizing the first Episcopalian mission, but was only allowed to proselytize foreigners due to limitations by colonial authorities.&lt;ref name="a5" /&gt;

The most significant years of Protestantism in Cuba were in the year 1882 and 1883. These years are important because of the establishment of Cuban Protestantism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As with the [[Anglicans]] and [[Methodists]], the Baptists found their initial converts working among Cuban exiles in Florida. In 1882, [[Juaquín de Palma]], who became a Baptist in Florida, returned to Cuba as a Bible distributor with the [[American Bible Society]]. He was joined in 1883 by colporteurs [[Alberto J. Díaz]] and [[Pedro Duarte]], who were [[Episcopal Church of Cuba|Episcopalian]] laymen. Later in 1883, Diaz established an independent Protestant church in La Havana, which became [[Iglesia Bautista Getsemaní]] in 1886 after Diaz became an ordained Baptist minister in 1885 under the Reverend [[William F. Wood]] of Key West, Florida, and became affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC).&lt;ref&gt;Melton, J. Gordon, and Clifton L. Holland. "Cuba." ''Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices''. Ed. J. Gordon Melton and Martin Baumann. 2nd ed. Vol. 2. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2010. 835-856&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Religious tolerance until 1886 existed only for foreigners until the Episcopal minister [[Pedro Duarte]] went directly to the Spanish Crown citing injustices done to him by local authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Ramos, Marcos A. ''Protestantism and Revolution in Cuba''. Miami: University of Miami, 1989.  23&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Spanish Constitution of 1876 extended to Cuba in 1886.&lt;ref name="auto1" &gt;Ramos, Marcos A. ''Protestantism and Revolution in Cuba''. Miami: University of Miami, 1989. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulties experienced leads and coincides with the next. Protestantism in Cuba was until 1898 Cuban.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; The foreign presence after Spain contributed to this change:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In 1898 North American intervention brought full religious lawful equality to Cuba. The arrival of large numbers of returning Cuban exiles and foreign missionaries also contributed to a growing number of Protestant churches. The years following the U.S. intervention were years of sway for the North American Mission Boards in Cuba… Their activities were not limited to organizing churches, but many also invested in founding schools and hospitals. The large U.S. missionary presence in Cuba to a certain point eclipsed the original native missionary efforts, and tensions between foreign and local leaders occurred in virtually every Protestant denomination.&lt;ref name="a5" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 20th century would be followed by what would be considered the Americanization of Protestantism.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, Louis, Luis Martinez-Fern, D. H. Figueredo. "Advisory Board." ''Encyclopedia of Cuba: People, History, Culture''. Santa Barbara, CA: Greenwood, 2003. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dharma Seed''' is non-profit organization "dedicated to preserving and sharing the spoken teachings of [[Theravada]] Buddhism in modern languages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.dharmaseed.org/about/us/|work=Dharma Seed's Official Website|publisher=Dharma Seed|accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

"Dharma Seed began in 1983 when [Bill Hamilton,] a volunteer at [[Insight Meditation Society|Insight Meditation Society (IMS)]] in [[Barre, Massachusetts]], began taping the dharma talks and meditation instructions offered there. His small project soon grew into a separate nonprofit organization, and Dharma Seed Tape Library began to spread the seeds of the dharma to the world by selling audiotapes of teachings. The original mission was simply to 'preserve and share the dharma,' which Dharma Seed continues to do today—with one critical change: The teachings are now offered based on the principle of [[Dāna|dana]], or the [[Buddhist]] practice of generosity. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Van Dusen|first=Caitlin|title=Dana Works: The Dharma Seed Archival Center|url=http://www.tricycle.com/sangha-services/dana-works-dharma-seed-archival-center|work=Tricycle Magazine, Winter 2002|publisher=[[Tricycle Magazine]]|accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Dusen|first=Caitlin|title=Dana Works: The Dharma Seed Archival Center|journal=Tricycle|year=2002|volume=12|page=117|publisher=Buddhist Ray, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, the tapes were "for the benefit of people who were not in the hall at the time of the talk, and the immense value of this material for posterity soon became evident. In 1984 the project incorporated as a non-profit religious organization, became Dharma Seed Tape Library, and moved out into the world. We’ve been doing this for almost sixteen years now. I was one of the original directors, and have been involved since the beginning," said Judy Phillips, Director of the Dharma Seed Archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.dharma.org/ij/archives/2000b/judy_phillips.htm | title=Dharma as Dana | journal=Insight Journal | year=2000 | volume=15 | issue=Fall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1985 Dharma Seed Tape Libraries had started to gain notoriety among Western "Spiritual Pilgrims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roggenbuck|first=Peggy|title=Replacing 'Old Tapes' with Timeless Wisdom|journal=Yoga Journal|date=May 1985|issue=62|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dharma Seed was one of "the growing number of organizations offering high quality cassettes" for the purpose of self-transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roggenbuck|first=Peggy|title=Replacing 'Old Tapes' with Timeless Wisdom|journal=Yoga Journal|date=May 1985|issue=62|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The May 1985 issue of Yoga Journal encouraged its readers to take advantage of the emerging availability of "'spiritual' [[cassette tapes]]" from the privacy of their home, car, or even [[Walkman]] headphones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roggenbuck|first=Peggy|title=Replacing 'Old Tapes' with Timeless Wisdom|journal=Yoga Journal|date=May 1985|issue=62|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; From that point on "spiritual pilgrims have never had it so easy!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roggenbuck|first=Peggy|title=Replacing 'Old Tapes' with Timeless Wisdom|journal=Yoga Journal|date=May 1985|issue=62|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After a decade, the American vipassana movement was still largely concentrated to three states - California, New York, and Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The faces of Buddhism in America|year=1998|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-21301-2|pages=178|author=Tanaka,|editor1=Prebish, Charles S. |editor2=Tanaka, Kenneth K. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through offering the teachings given at [[Insight Meditation Society]] (IMS) by mail order, Dharma Seed allowed the teachings to become available to those in regions lacking significant vipassana offerings.

"On the last night of [a meditation retreat], the ashes of Bill Hamilton, founder of the Dharma Seed Tape Library, were brought to Cloud Mountain.  Bill had lived on Whidbey Island and had many friends in the Seattle sangha. In March of that year, Bill was told he had pancreatic cancer. A woman on the retreat outlined the story of his hospitalization and surgery, amazed at how affable and pleasant he had been through his suffering. Bill had wanted to be buried whole underneath an apple tree, but since such burials weren't allowed in Washington, a small apple tree was bought, a hole dug by the pond here, and his ashes were sent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The nature of home: taking root in a place | publisher=University of Arizona Press | author=Gaard, Greta Claire | year=Greta Claire | pages=75–76 | isbn=978-0-8165-2576-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The organization derives its name from the concept of a Dharma Seed.  "Seeds like this are the ideal object of reflection in the [[vipassana]] sense.  It is not enough merely to have a bare, undigested idea of a topic like '[[impermanence]]'... We need a Dharma Seed - an idea that has developed numerous facets of meaning for us.  The more we reflect on the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]], the more Dharma seeds will emerge for us, and the more genuine topics we shall have for vipassana meditation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamalashila|title=Meditation: The Buddhist Way of Tranquillity and Insight|publisher=Windhorse Publications|isbn=978-1-899579-05-1|pages=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oral History ==
Dharma Seed highlights the importance of preserving the [[Oral history|oral transmission]] of Dharma teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reder|first=Alan|title=Listen and Learn|journal=Yoga Journal|date=November 2002|pages=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Reder wrote that although "[books] still offer the greatest variety of material, plus unmatched depth and detail.  However, they sometimes yield only the faintest impression of the people who wrote them, and that can make a crucial difference with wise beings whose inspiring presence is part of their teaching... Fortunately, we can also 'meet' almost any great teacher on audio and video recordings... Dharma Seed picks up where the [[Buddha]] left off 2,500 years ago: distributing the dharma without charge... The celebs you'll expect - [[Jack Kornfield]], [[Joseph Goldstein (writer)|Joseph Goldstein]], [[Four Noble Truths#Sylvia Boorstein: life is challenging|Sylvia Boorstein]], [[Sharon Salzberg]] - are all voluminously represented in the catalog."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reder|first=Alan|title=Listen and Learn|journal=Yoga Journal|date=November 2002|pages=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dharma Centers ==
Dharma Seed hosts audio recordings of [[Dharma Talk|dharma talks]] given at over 40 centers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dharma Center Talks|url=http://www.dharmaseed.org/centers/|work=Dharma Seed's Official Website|publisher=Dharma Seed|accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australian Aboriginal mythology]], the '''Djunkgao''' are a group of sisters who are associated with [[flood]]s and [[ocean]] currents.  They named the clans and all the animals, and made sacred wells from [[yam (vegetable)|yam]] sticks.  The youngest one was [[incest]]ously [[rape]]d and the sisters became mundane women.

The '''Edmonton Theosophical Society''' is an independent theosophical Society in Canada. It was founded in 1911, was from 1919 to 1992 part of the Canadian Section of the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]] and since 1995 it is independent of the Theosophical Society in Canada.

== History ==
The first theosophical lodge in Canada was founded on February 16, 1891 in Toronto by [[Albert E.&amp;nbsp;S. Smythe]], [[Emily Stowe]], [[Augusta Stowe-Gullen]] and [[Algernon Blackwood]]. In 1895, the society was divided into two different parts, one adhering to the Theosophical Society Adyar, the other (the majority) to the [[Theosophical Society in America]]. Until 1919 many lodges formed part of the Theosophical Society in America. Following the initiative of Albert Smythe, the Theosophical Society in Canada was formed, and consisted of 17 lodges with approximately 800 members.&lt;ref&gt;*1. The Canadian Encyclopedia - Theosophy: https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/theosophy/ *2. The high country Theosophist, September 1992: http://www.hctheosophist.com/archives/pdf/hc199209.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Smythe also came in conflict with [[Annie Besant]], and in 1924 she helped to found the Canadian Federation of the Theosophical Society. Therefore, there were in 1924 two Theosophical Societies that were part of the Theosophical Society Adyar.&lt;ref&gt;*2.

In 1992, the Theosophical Society in Canada became independent.&lt;ref&gt;*2. The high country Theosophist, September 1992: http://www.hctheosophist.com/archives/pdf/hc199209.pdf
*3. The high country Theosophist, März 1996: http://www.hctheosophist.com/archives/pdf/hc199603.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 there was a divide in the Theosophical Society of Canada. The lodges in Edmonton and Calgary separated from the TS in Canada and formed the independent Edmonton Theosophical Society. The Canadian Federation changed its name later to the Canadian Theosophical Association. 

The Edmonton Theosophical Society was founded in 1911, in 1919 it became part of the Canadian Section of the Theosophical Society Adyar, in 1992 they separated from the TS Adyar and in 1995 they became independent. Since 1997 they publish the ''Fohat'' magazine and have a publishing house and a book store.

'''Eugène Nielen Marais''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|juː|dʒ|iː|n|_|m|ɑː|ˈ|r|eɪ}}; 9 January 1871 – 29 March 1936) was a South African lawyer, [[natural history|naturalist]], poet and writer. He has been hailed as an intellectual genius and an Afrikaner hero.&lt;ref name=Swart2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swart|first1=Sandra|title=The construction of Eugène Marais as an Afrikaner hero|journal=Journal of Southern African Studies|date=2004|volume=30|issue=4|pages=847–867|url=http://sun025.sun.ac.za/portal/page/portal/Arts/Departemente1/geskiedenis/docs/marais_hero.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304190504/http://sun025.sun.ac.za/portal/page/portal/Arts/Departemente1/geskiedenis/docs/marais_hero.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== His early years, before and during the Boer War ==
Marais was born in [[Pretoria]],{{ref|opperman}} the thirteenth and last child of Jan Christiaan Nielen Marais and Catharina Helena Cornelia van Niekerk. He attended school in Pretoria, [[Boshof]] and [[Paarl]], and much of his early education was in English, as were his earliest poems. He matriculated at the age of sixteen.{{ref|schirmer}}

After leaving school, he worked in Pretoria as a legal clerk and then as a journalist before becoming owner (at the age of twenty) of a newspaper called ''[[Land en Volk]]'' (''Country and (the Afrikaner) People''). He involved himself deeply in local politics.

He began taking opiates at an early age and graduated to morphine (then considered to be non-habit forming and safe) very soon thereafter. He became addicted, and his addiction ruled his affairs and actions to a greater or lesser extent throughout his life. When asked why he took drugs, he variously pleaded ill health, insomnia and, later, the death of his young wife as a result of the birth of his only child. Much later, he blamed accidental addiction while ill with malaria in [[Mozambique]]. Some claim his use of drugs was experimental and influenced by the philosophy of [[de Quincey]].&lt;ref name="rousseau"&gt;Rousseau, L., 1974, Die Groot Verlange, Cape Town: Human &amp; Rousseau&lt;/ref&gt;

Marais married Aletta Beyers, but she died from [[puerperal fever]] a year later, eight days after the birth of their son. Eugène Charles Gerard was Marais' only child.

In 1897 — still in his mid-twenties – Marais went to London to read medicine. However, under pressure from his friends, he entered the [[Inner Temple]] to study law.&lt;ref name="rousseau" /&gt; He qualified as an advocate. When the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] broke out in 1899, he was put on parole as an enemy alien in London. During the latter part of the war he joined a German expedition that sought to ship ammunition and medicines to the Boer Commandos via [[Portuguese East Africa]] (now Mozambique). However, he was struck down in this tropical area by malaria and, before the supplies could be delivered to the Boers, the war ended.

== After the war ==
From 1905 Marais studied nature in the [[Waterberg Biosphere|Waterberg]] ('Water mountain'), a wilderness area north of Pretoria, and wrote in his native [[Afrikaans]] about the animals he observed. His studies of [[termites]] led him to conclude that the colony ought to be considered as a single organism, a prescient insight that predated the elaboration of the idea by [[Richard Dawkins]]. In the Waterberg, Marais also studied the [[black mamba]], [[spitting cobra]] and [[Bitis arietans|puff adder]].{{ref|hogan}} Moreover, he observed a specific troop of [[baboon]]s at length{{ref|marais}}, and from these studies there sprang numerous magazine articles and the books ''My Friends the Baboons'' and ''The Soul of the Ape''. He is acknowledged as the father of the scientific study of the behaviour of animals, known as [[Ethology]].

== Theft of his work ==
As the leader of the Second [[Afrikaans Language Movement]], Marais preferred to write in Afrikaans, and his work was translated into various languages either late in his life or after his death. His book ''Die Siel van die Mier'' (''The Soul of the Ant'' but usually given in English as the ''Soul of the White Ant'') was plagiarised by [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureate [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], who published ''La Vie des Termites'' (translated into English as ''The Life of Termites'' or ''The Life of  White Ants''), an [[entomology|entomological]] book,&lt;ref&gt;"Die Huisgenoot", ''Nasionale Pers'', 6 January 1928, cover story.&lt;/ref&gt; in what has been called "a classic example of academic plagiarism" by [[Queen Mary, University of London|University of London's]] professor of [[biology]], David Bignell.&lt;ref name="bignell"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biology.qmul.ac.uk/research/staff/bignell/Inaugural.htm |title=Termites: 3000 Variations On A Single Theme |accessdate=2009-07-28 |author=Professor David E. Bignell |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915005006/http://www.biology.qmul.ac.uk/research/staff/bignell/Inaugural.htm |archivedate=15 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marais accused Maeterlinck of having used his concept of the "organic unity" of the termitary in his book.&lt;ref name="swart"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Construction of Eugène Marais as an Afrikaner Hero |author=Sandra Swart |journal=Journal of Southern African Studies |year=2004 |volume=December |issue=30.4 |url=http://www.oulitnet.co.za/seminarroom/marais_swart.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marais had published his ideas on the termitary in the South African Afrikaans-language press, both in ''[[Die Burger]]'' in January 1923 and in ''[[Huisgenoot]]'', which featured a series of articles on termites under the title "Die Siel van die Mier" (The Soul of the (White) Ant) from 1925 to 1926. Maeterlinck's book, with almost identical content,&lt;ref name="bignell" /&gt; was published in 1926. It is alleged that Maeterlinck had come across Eugene Marais' series of articles, and that it would have been easy for Maeterlinck to translate from Afrikaans to French, since Maeterlinck knew Dutch and had already made several translations from Dutch into French before.&lt;ref name="assonville"&gt;d'Assonville VD, Eugene Marais and the Waterberg, Marnix 2008&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|53}} It was common at the time for worthy articles published in Afrikaans to be reproduced in Flemish and Dutch magazines and journals.

Marais sent a letter to Dr. Winifred de Kock in London about Maeterlinck, in which he wrote that &lt;blockquote&gt;The famous author had paid me the left-handed compliment of cribbing the most important part of my work... He clearly desired his readers to infer that he had arrived at certain of my theories (the result of ten years of hard labour in the veld) by his own unaided reason, although he admits that he never saw a termite in his life. You must understand that it was not merely plagiarism of the spirit of a thing, so to speak. He has copied page after page verbally.&lt;ref name="rousseau" /&gt;{{rp|398}}&lt;ref name="assonville" /&gt;{{rp|53}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Supported by a coterie of [[Afrikaner]] Nationalist friends, Marais sought justice through the South African press and attempted an international lawsuit. This was to prove financially impossible and the case was not pursued. However, Marais gained a measure of renown as the aggrieved party and as an Afrikaner researcher who had opened himself up to plagiarism because he published in [[Afrikaans]] out of nationalistic loyalty. Marais brooded at the time of the scandal: "I wonder whether Maeterlinck blushes when he reads such things [critical acclaim], and whether he gives a thought to the injustice he does to the unknown [[Boer]] worker?"&lt;ref name="swart" /&gt;

Maeterlinck's own words in ''The Life of Termites'' indicate that the possible discovery or accusation of plagiarism worried him:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It would have been easy, in regard to every statement, to allow the text to bristle with footnotes and references. In some chapters there is not a sentence but would have clamoured for these; and the letterpress would have been swallowed up by vast masses of comment, like one of those dreadful books we hated so much at school. There is a short bibliography at the end of the volume which will no doubt serve the same purpose.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Despite these misgivings, there is no reference to Eugène Marais in the bibliography. Maeterlinck's other works on entomology include ''The Life of the Ant'' (1930).

Professor VE d'Assonville wrote about Maeterlinck as "the Nobel Prize winner who had never seen a termite in his whole life and had never put a foot on the soil of Africa, least of all in the Waterberg.".&lt;ref name="assonville" /&gt;{{rp|53}}

[[Robert Ardrey]], an admirer of Eugène Marais's, attributed Marais' later suicide to this act of plagiarism and theft of intellectual property by Maeterlinck.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Ardrey]],''[[The Territorial Imperative]]: A Personal Inquiry into the Animal Origins of Property and Nations (1966)''&lt;/ref&gt; Ardrey said in his introduction to ''The Soul of the Ape'', published in 1969, that 'As a scientist he was unique, supreme in his time, yet a worker in a science unborn.' He also refers to Marais' work at length in his book ''African Genesis''.

== Death ==
There is evidence {{ref|opperman}} that Marais' time and research in the Waterberg brought him great peace and joy and provided him with artistic inspiration. In the poem ''Waar Tebes in die stil woestyn'', he writes (as translated into English by J. W. Marchant) 'There would I know peace once more, where Tebes in the quiet desert lifts it mighty rockwork on high ...'. (Tebus is one of the principal peaks of the area). That said, Marais was a long-term [[morphine]] addict and suffered from melancholy, insomnia, depression and feelings of isolation.

In 1936, deprived of morphine for some days, he borrowed a shotgun on the pretext of killing a snake and shot himself in the chest. The wound was not fatal, and Marais therefore put the gun barrel in his mouth and pulled the trigger. He did so on the farm [[Pelindaba]], belonging to his friend [[Gustav Preller]]. For those who are familiar with the dark moods of certain of Marais' poems, there is a black irony here; in Zulu, Pelindaba means 'the end of the business' – although the more common interpretation is 'Place of great gatherings'.

Marais and his wife Aletta are buried in the Heroes' Acre, Pretoria.

== Legacy ==
Marais' work as a naturalist, although by no means trivial (he was one of the first scientists to practise [[ethology]] and was repeatedly acknowledged as such by [[Robert Ardrey]] and others{{ref|ardrey}}), gained less public attention and appreciation than his contributions as a literalist. He discovered the Waterberg Cycad, which was named after him (''[[Encephalartos eugene-maraisii]]'').  He was the first person to study the behaviour of wild primates, and his observations continue to be cited in contemporary evolutionary biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffith|first=Jeremy | authorlink = Jeremy Griffith |title=Freedom Book 1|volume= ''Part 4:7 Second Category of Thinker: Those who admitted the involvement of our moral instincts and corrupting intellect in producing the upset state of the human condition and who attempted to explain how those elements produced that upset psychosis''| year=2013|publisher=WTM Publishing &amp; Communications|isbn=978-1-74129-011-0|url=http://www.worldtransformation.com/freedom-book1-those-who-tried-to-explain-the-human-condition/| accessdate   = 28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is among the greatest of the [[Afrikaner]] poets and remains one of the most popular, although his output was not large. [[D. J. Opperman|Opperman]] described him as the first professional Afrikaner poet; Marais believed that craft was as important as inspiration for poetry. Along with J.H.H. de Waal and G.S. Preller, he was a leading light in the Second Afrikaans Language Movement in the period immediately after the Second Boer War, which ended in 1902. Some of his finest poems deal with the wonders of life and nature, but he also wrote about inexorable death. Marais was isolated in some of his beliefs. He was a self-confessed [[pantheist]] and claimed that the only time he entered a church was for weddings.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Copeman ''God's First Fisherman'' 2008, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; An assessment of Marais' status as an Afrikaner hero was published by historian Sandra Swart.&lt;ref name=Swart2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swart|first1=Sandra|title=The construction of Eugène Marais as an Afrikaner hero|journal=Journal of Southern African Studies|date=2004|volume=30|issue=4|pages=847–867|url=http://sun025.sun.ac.za/portal/page/portal/Arts/Departemente1/geskiedenis/docs/marais_hero.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304190504/http://sun025.sun.ac.za/portal/page/portal/Arts/Departemente1/geskiedenis/docs/marais_hero.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although an Afrikaner patriot, Marais was sympathetic to the cultural values of the black tribal peoples of the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]; this is seen in poems such as ''Die Dans van die Reën'' (The Dance of the Rain). The following translation of Marais' ''Winternag" is by J. W. Marchant:

'''"Winter's Night"'''

O the small wind is frigid and spare&lt;br&gt;
and bright in the dim light and bare&lt;br&gt;
as wide as God's merciful boon&lt;br&gt;
the [[veld]] lies in starlight and gloom&lt;br&gt;
and on the high lands&lt;br&gt;
spread through burnt bands&lt;br&gt;
the grass-seed, astir, is like beckoning hands.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
O East-wind gives mournful measure to song&lt;br&gt;
Like the lilt of a lovelorn lass who's been wronged&lt;br&gt;
In every grass fold&lt;br&gt;
bright dewdrop takes hold&lt;br&gt;
and promptly pales to frost in the cold!

While the above translation is generally faithful, and is a fine poem in English, it does not quite capture the terse directness of the Afrikaans language, which makes Afrikaans poetry so bittersweet and evocative, striking straight to the heart and soul. Below follows a translation by Farrell Hope, which may closer reflect the original Afrikaans idiom. Note the above version by J. W. Marchant, as well as the third version below by At de Lange, both translate the Afrikaans word in the poem ''skade'' (damage) as if it was ''skadu'' (shade).  This is a common error in translating the poem and misses the point Marais was making: that the British forces had destroyed the Boer farms.

'''"Winternight"'''

O cold is the slight wind,&lt;br /&gt;
and keen.&lt;br /&gt;
Bare and bright in dim light&lt;br /&gt;
is seen,&lt;br /&gt;
as vast as the graces of God,&lt;br /&gt;
the veld's starlit and fire-scarred sod.&lt;br /&gt;
To the high edge of the lands,&lt;br /&gt;
spread through the scorched sands,&lt;br /&gt;
new seed-grass is stirring&lt;br /&gt;
like beckoning hands.

O mournful the tune&lt;br /&gt;
of the East-wind refrain,&lt;br /&gt;
like the song of a girl&lt;br /&gt;
who loved but in vain.&lt;br /&gt;
One drop of dew glistens&lt;br /&gt;
on each grass-blade's fold&lt;br /&gt;
and fast does it pale&lt;br /&gt;
to frost in the cold!

An English translation by At de Lange preserves the musicality of the poem quite well:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=De Lange|first1=At|title='n Vertaalde gedig|url=http://www.woes.co.za/bydrae/gedig/n-vertaalde-gedig|website=Woes: Kreatiewe Platvorm vir Afrikaans|publisher=Kahuna Mobility Solutions|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Winter's Night"'''

O cold is the windlet&lt;br /&gt;
and spare.&lt;br /&gt;
And bright in the dim-light&lt;br /&gt;
and bare,&lt;br /&gt;
as vast as God's mercy has bade,&lt;br /&gt;
lie the plains in starlight and shade.&lt;br /&gt;
And high in the ridges,&lt;br /&gt;
spreaded in burnt ditches,&lt;br /&gt;
are the grass plumes stirring&lt;br /&gt;
like beckoning hands.

O tune with grief laden&lt;br /&gt;
on the east wind's drone,&lt;br /&gt;
like the song of a maiden&lt;br /&gt;
in her love made alone.&lt;br /&gt;
In each grass blade's fold&lt;br /&gt;
a drop of dew gleams bold,&lt;br /&gt;
and it pales quickly&lt;br /&gt;
to frost in the cold!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5829">'''Frank R. Zindler''' (born 1939) is an American [[atheist]] who served as interim president of the atheist organization [[American Atheists]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=American Atheists|title=American Atheists|url=http://www.atheists.org/about-us/board-of-directors|publisher=American Atheists|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was former professor of biology and geology, and Chairman, Division of Science, Nursing, &amp; Technology, at Fulton-Montgomery Community College of the State University of New York.&lt;ref name="TheSecularWebBioZindler"&gt;{{cite web|last=|title=Frank R. Zindler (Biographical Information)|url=http://infidels.org/library/modern/frank_zindler/bio.html|publisher=The Secular Web|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is both editor of ''[[American Atheist Magazine]]'' and Director of [[American Atheists Press]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tabee3i.com/page/interviews/en/Frank-Zindler/index.html Biography at World of Reason]&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 2011, he published a multi-volume anthology of his short essays and other works.&lt;ref name="TheSecularWebBioZindler"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.secularstudents.org/speakers/FrankZindler Biography at Secular Student Alliance]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates==
Zindler is an outspoken opponent of [[Creationism]] and has participated in several [[Evolution]] v. Creation debates. He also had a famous debate with philosopher and theologian [[William Lane Craig]] at Willow Creek Community Church, South Barrington, IL on June 27, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philvaz.com/apologetics/Review-Craig-Zindler.htm |title=Atheism vs. Christianity: Where Does the Evidence Point? |work=PhilVaz |accessdate=18 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217064213/http://www.philvaz.com/apologetics/Review-Craig-Zindler.htm |archivedate=December 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zindler is also a proponent of the [[Christ Myth Theory|mythicist]] theory that no historical person lies behind the Gospel picture of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]]. After the publication of [[Bart Ehrman]]'s 2012 book ''Did Jesus Exist? The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth'' arguing (from a non-religious perspective) for the existence of a historical Jesus, Zindler and [[Robert M. Price]] co-edited an anthology of essays by various mythicists arguing against Ehrman's position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zindler |first=Frank and Robert Price |date=2013 |title=Bart Ehrman and the Quest of the Historical Jesus of Nazareth: An Evaluation of Ehrman’s Did Jesus Exist? |url= |location= |publisher=American Atheist Press |page= |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, the HJS arranged a five-day All-India Hindu Convention at [[Ponda, India|Ponda]], Goa. This attracted attendance from a range of individuals and activists representing various groups and, according to its chief organiser, was intended to "...&amp;nbsp;chalk out a blue print for the protection of dharma and establishment of a Hindu Nation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Times of India |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-06-10/goa/32155789_1_hindu-nation-hjs-sanatan-sanstha |title=Blueprint for 'Hindu Nation' to be chalked out in Goa |date=10 June 2012 |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, following civil disturbances in [[Mumbai]], the group demanded a ban on what it called "fanatical" Muslim groups such as [[Raza Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newstrackindia.com/newsdetails/2012/08/13/346--Hindu-groups-demand-ban-on-Muslim-bodies-.html |title=Hindu groups demand ban on Muslim bodies |agency=IANS |date=13 August 2012 |publisher=Newstrack |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christophe Jaffrelot]], a political scientist, considers the HJS to be an offshoot of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]].&lt;ref name="Jaffrelot2009" /&gt;

A convention organised by HJS in 2014 was supported by prominent activists such as [[Paras Rajput]] of [[Hindu Helpline]], Sanjiv Punalekar, the national secretary of [[Hindu Vidhidnya Parishad]], and Rabindra Ghosh, lawyer and president of the Bangladesh Minority Watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/Be-prepared-to-deal-with-terror-Hindus-urged/articleshow/37104336.cms |title=Be prepared to deal with terror, Hindus urged |date=24 June 2014 |work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Itivuttaka''' ([[Pali]] for "as it was said") is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] scripture, part of the [[Pali Canon]] of [[Theravada]] Buddhism and is attributed to [[Khujjuttara]]'s recollection of Buddha's discourses.&lt;ref&gt;Ireland, John (trans. &amp; intro.) (1999). ''Itivuttaka: The Buddha's Sayings (excerpts)''.  Article's "Introduction" is available on-line at http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/iti/iti.intro.irel.html#intro&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu (trans. &amp; intro.) (2001). ''Itivuttaka: This Was Said by the Buddha''. "Translator's Introduction" is available on-line at http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/iti/iti.intro.than.html#intro.&lt;/ref&gt; It is included there in the [[Sutta Pitaka]]'s [[Khuddaka Nikaya]]. It comprises 112 short teachings ascribed in the text to the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], each consisting of a prose portion followed by a verse portion. The latter may be a paraphrase of the former, or complementary. Some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, ''Indian Buddhism'', Japan, 1990; reprinted Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi&lt;/ref&gt; consider it one of the earliest of all Buddhist scriptures, while others consider it somewhat later.  Latest translation by Anagarika Mahendra has been published in 2018.

==Early life and family==
Luz was born in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. He is the son of a hairdresser and public official in the Rio de Janeiro city government. His name was given to him by his father who always admired Jesus Christ as the most philosophical mind of all time. His surname Luz means “light” in Portuguese. Luz has two younger half brothers. As a child he moved frequently, especially after his parents split when he was 5 years old. When he was a teenager he pursued modeling and acting, working odd jobs, including as a salesman at a surf shop in Ipanema. Luz grew up in a musical environment, his uncle used to play in a rock band in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/fashion/29luz.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp; | title=For Madonna’s Boyfriend, Fame by Association | work=[[The New York Times]] | date= November 27, 2009 | first= Allen | last= Salkin | accessdate =2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="im"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/fashion/jesus-luz/#/page3 | title=Jesus Luz | work=[[W (magazine)|W magazine]] | date= 2010 | first= Jonathan | last= Durbin | accessdate =2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fashion career==
Luz signed the first contract in 2005 for a modeling agency "40 Graus Models". He was hired by Sergio Mattos for whom he worked for three years. In 2006, he spent six months in New York, living with an aunt and learning English. Luz obtained the first modeling job in his hometown at a fashion show "Fashion Rio 2007". During that period he also studied acting at the training school for actors "Casa das Artes de Laranjeiras". He obtained a small part in the television series Pegadoras (''The sinful'') which was broadcast on [[Rede Globo]]. In 2008 Luz signed the contract with [[Ford Models]] becoming one of the highest paid male models in the world. That same year Luz got his first big international job when [[Steven Klein (photographer)|Steven Klein]] chose him to pose alongside [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] for the [[W (magazine)|W magazine]] photo shoot. Rumors that the relationship moved from staged photographs to real life began in December 2008 when reports from the Brazilian press surfaced which made Luz internationally known. In 2009 he featured on the summer cover of [[L'Officiel Hommes]] fashion magazine. In 2009 Luz was also one of the faces for [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]] photographed by Steven Klein. He was also photographed by Tom Munro for [[Pepe Jeans]] alongside Hanne Gabe Odiele and [[Agnete Hegelund]]. In [[Milan Fashion Week]] 2009 Luz debuted as Dolce &amp; Gabbana exclusive model. In 2010 he appeared in [[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] magazine editorial photographed by [[Mikael Jansson]].&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="im"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nymag.com/fashion/models/jluz/jesusluz/ | title=Jesus Luz | work=[[New York (magazine)|New York magazine]] | date= | first= | last= | accessdate =2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music career==
Luz had a lot of DJ and musician friends in school, where he played flute. He got into DJing in 2010. Luz used to watch his friends do it and started to go to all of the electronic parties. He attended the "Dubspot", a DJ school in New York City, for three months where he was taught how to mix, how the crossfader works, and all the basic stuff to deal with the equipment. He is interested in electronic music—trance, electro-house, progressive house and tech-house. Later Luz landed high-profile gigs. For the 90-minute set he was spinning on his second professional D.J. job he was being paid around $15,000.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="im"/&gt;

==Kabbalah==
Luz practises [[Kabbalah]]. He was introduced to Kabbalah by his ex-girlfriend Madonna and has also studied [[Buddhism]] and [[yoga]]. “I’m just looking for something to make me strong, and Kabbalah has given me that,” Luz said.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

The [[Archdiocese of Turku]] is the oldest [[diocese]] in [[Finland]]. Mediaeval bishops of the [[Roman Catholicism in Finland|Catholic Church]] were also ''de facto'' secular leaders of the country until the end of the 13th century.

After the [[Swedish Reformation|Reformation]] in Scandinavia, [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] bishops became state officials. When Finland became a separate [[Grand Duchy of Finland|grand duchy]], the then Bishop of Turku was elevated to archiepiscopal rank in 1817. Since 1868, the Archbishops of Turku and Finland have been considered [[primate (bishop)|primate]]s of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]].

== Bishop Henry ==
[[Bishop Henry|Henry]] [[Bishop of Uppsala|of Uppsala]] is often mentioned in contemporary sources as the first Bishop of Finland. According to legends, the English-born Henry arrived in Finland with King [[Eric IX of Sweden]] during the [[First Swedish Crusade]], later suffering martyrdom in the 1150s. His position as Bishop of Finland is, however, totally unhistorical, and not claimed even by legends.

[[File:Urbain Grandier.jpg|thumb|[[Urbain Grandier]], who was convicted and executed as a result of the Loudun possessions]]

The '''Loudun possessions''' was a notorious [[witchcraft]] trial in [[Loudun]], [[France]] in 1634. A [[convent]] of [[Ursulines|Ursuline]] [[nun]]s said they had been visited and [[demonic possession|possessed by demons]]. Following an investigation by the [[Catholic Church]], a local priest named Father [[Urbain Grandier]] was accused of summoning the evil spirits. He was eventually convicted of the crimes of [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] and [[burned at the stake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sluhovsky|first=Moshe|year=2002|title=The Devil in the Convent|journal=[[The American Historical Review]]|volume=107|issue=5|pages=1379–411|jstor=10.1086/532851|doi=10.1086/532851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case contains similar themes to other witchcraft trials that occurred throughout western Europe in the 17th century, such as the [[Aix-en-Provence possessions]] (France) in 1611 or the [[Pendle witches]] (England) in 1612 before reaching the [[European colonization of the Americas|New World]] by the [[Salem witch trials|1690s]].

==Early trials and conspiracy==
[[File:UrbainPact2.jpg|thumb|224px|[[Urbain Grandier]]'s alleged diabolical pact]]
The pact was allegedly signed between Urbain Grandier and the [[Devil]], stolen from the Devil's cabinet of pacts by the demon [[Asmodeus]]. This page shows the signatures of all demons in possession of the Ursuline nuns at Loudun and the note added ''Dictionnaire infernal'' by [[Collin de Plancy]] (1826)

Urbain Grandier was appointed [[parish]] [[priest]] of St-Pierre-du-Marché in Loudun, a town in [[Poitou]], France, in 1617. Grandier was considered to be a very good-looking man, and was both wealthy and well-educated. The combination made the priest a target for the attention of girls in Loudun, one of whom was Philippa Trincant, the daughter of the King's solicitor in Loudun. It was believed by the people of Loudun that Grandier was the father of Trincant's child. In addition to Trincant, Grandier openly courted Madeleine de Brou, daughter of the King's councillor in Loudun. Most assumed that Madeleine was Grandier's mistress after he wrote a treatise against the [[celibacy]] of priests for her.

Grandier was also a very well-connected man, high in political circles. When he was arrested and found guilty of immorality on June 2, 1630, it was these connections that restored him to full clerical duties within the same year. Presiding over the case was Chasteigner de La Roche Posay,  the [[Bishop of Poitiers]], a man who was known to dislike Grandier and admitted to wanting him out of the parish.

Two stories exist about what happened next. Either the Bishop of Poitiers approached Father Jean Mignon, [[confessor]] to the Ursuline nuns, and a plan was made to persuade a few of the sisters to feign possession and denounce Grandier, or Father Mignon was approached by the [[Abbess|Mother Superior]] Jeanne des Anges (Joan of the Angels) for help.

According to the first story, Father Mignon readily persuaded the Mother Superior, Jeanne des Anges, and another nun to comply. They would claim that Father Grandier had bewitched them, falling into fits and convulsions, often holding their breath and [[Glossolalia|speaking in tongues]].

The second story claims that Jeanne had illicit dreams about Father Grandier, who appeared to her as a radiant angel. As an angel, he enticed her to sexual acts, causing her to rave loudly at night. Jeanne suffered [[flagellation]] and did [[penance]] for the night-time disturbances, but she was no less troubled and soon it was found that other nuns were being haunted by [[hallucination]]s and vulgar dreams. It was then, this version claims, that Mother Superior Jeanne des Anges called for Father Mignon to hear her confession and purge the [[Abbey|convent]] of [[demon]]s.

However it came about, Father Mignon and his aide, Father Pierre Barré, saw in the activity an opportunity to remove Grandier.

Fathers Mignon and Barré immediately proceeded to perform [[exorcism]]s on the possessed nuns. Several of the nuns, including Jeanne des Anges, suffered violent convulsions during the procedure, shrieking and making sexual motions toward the priests. Following the lead of Jeanne des Anges, many of the nuns reported illicit dreams. The accusers would suddenly bark, scream, [[Blasphemy|blaspheme]], and contort their bodies. During the exorcisms, Jeanne swore that she and the other nuns were possessed by two demons named [[Asmodeus]] and [[Zebulun]]. These demons were sent to the nuns when Father Grandier tossed a bouquet of roses over the convent walls.

Nearby and realizing the danger he was in, Father Grandier pleaded with the [[bailiff]] of Loudun to isolate the nuns; the bailiff's orders were ignored, and the exorcisms and denouncements continued. Desperate, Grandier wrote to the [[Archbishop of Bordeaux]], who sent his personal doctor to examine the nuns. No evidences of true possession were found, and the Archbishop ordered the exorcisms to cease on March 21, 1633. The nuns were sequestered in their cells.

Having failed to remove Grandier, his contemporaries continued their efforts in earnest. One of these was Jean de Laubardemont, a relative of Jeanne des Anges' and favored by the powerful [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Armand Jean du Plessis, Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]]. Laubardemont and a [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] monk, Tranquille, visited the Cardinal with news of the unsuccessful exorcisms and added further evidence against Grandier by providing a copy of a [[libel]]ous [[satire]] Grandier had written about Richelieu. Aware that a relative of his, Sister Claire, was in the Loudun convent, Richelieu asserted his power and organized the Royal Commission to arrest and investigate Grandier as a [[Witchcraft|witch]]. Laubardemont was appointed head of the commission.

==Public exorcisms at Loudun==
When exorcisms resumed at Loudun, they were led by the expert [[Exorcism|exorcists]] Capuchin Father Tranquille, [[Franciscan]] Father Lactance, and [[Jesuit]] Father [[Jean-Joseph Surin]], and they were held publicly; up to 7,000 spectators attended. The priests employed dramatic commands, threats, and rituals to both direct and encourage the nuns in their accusations against Grandier.

Adding to the [[hysteria]] prompted by the public exorcisms were the stories told by both nuns and Father Grandier's former lovers. As in both the [[Louviers possessions]] and the [[Aix-en-Provence possessions]], the claims made against Grandier were overtly sexual and showed visible physical responses. Because they were public and dramatic, the citizens of Loudun and surrounding areas were set against Grandier.

In addition to the dreams that Jeanne des Anges and other nuns had related, Jeanne added a third demon to the array of possessors afflicting the nuns: Isacaron, the devil of debauchery. After admitting to this third demon possessor, Jeanne went through a [[phantom pregnancy|psychosomatic pregnancy]]. In all, Jeanne and the other nuns claimed to be possessed by a multitude of demons: [[Asmodai|Asmodeus]], Zabulon, Isacaaron, [[Astaroth]], Gresil, Amand, [[Leviathan|Leviatom]], [[Behemoth|Behemot]], Beherie, Easas, Celsus, Acaos, Cedon, Naphthalim, Cham, Ureil and Achas.

In an effort to clear his name, Father Grandier performed an exorcism on the nuns himself. He spoke to the nuns in [[Greek language|Greek]], testing their [[Xenoglossia|knowledge of languages previously unknown to them]] (a sure sign of possession). The nuns had been coached, and responded that they had been ordered in their [[deal with the Devil|pact]] to never use Greek.

In another exorcism, performed by Father Gault, the priest obtained a promise from the demon Asmodeus to leave one of the nuns he was possessing. Later, a devil's pact allegedly written between the Devil and Grandier was presented to the court. In this pact, stolen from [[Lucifer]]'s cabinet of pacts by Asmodeus himself, was signed in blood by Grandier and various demons. Asmodeus had apparently written out the same promise he'd given to Father Gault on this pact:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I promise that when leaving this creature, I will make a slit below her heart as long as a pin, that this slit will pierce her shirt, bodice and cloth which will be bloody. And tomorrow, on the twentieth of May at five in the afternoon of Saturday, I promise that the demons Gresil and Amand will make their opening in the same way, but a little smaller - and I approve the promises made by Leviatam, Behemot, Beherie with their companions to sign, when leaving, the register of the church of St. Croix! Given the nineteenth of May 1629.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later historians would prove that this note was written in Jeanne des Anges' hand.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}  An image of the pact is presented at the top of this article.

==Torture at Loudun==
On December 7, 1633, Father Grandier was put in prison at the [[Château d'Angers|Castle of Angers]]. His body was shaved and a successful search for [[Witches' mark|devil's marks]] was made by [[inquisitor]]s. Protests by Dr. Fourneau, the physician who prepared Grandier for torture, and the [[apothecary]] from [[Poitiers]] were ignored. These protests claimed the inspection was a [[hoax]], and stated that no such marks had been found.

Nicholas Aubin's 1693 ''The Cheats and Illusions of Romish Priest and Exorcists Discovered in the History of the Devils of Loudun'' describes what happened next:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
They sent for Mannouri the surgeon, one of [Grandier's] enemies, and the most unmerciful of them all; when he [came] into the chamber, they stripped Grandier stark naked, blinded his eyes, shaved him every where, and Mannouri began to search him. When he would persuade them that the parts of his body which had been marked by the Devil were insensible, he turned that end of the probe which was round, and he guided it in such a manner, that not being able to enter into the flesh, nor to make much impression, it was pushed back into the palm of his hand; the patient did not then cry out, because he felt no pain; but when the barbarous surgeon would make them see that the other parts of his body were very sensible, he turned the probe at the other end, which was very sharp pointed, and thrust it to the very bone; and then the abundance of people [outside] heard complaints so bitter, and cries so piercing, that they [were] moved...to the heart
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Other people spoke in Grandier's defense, even some of the possessed nuns proclaimed his innocence. Laubardemont, fulfilling his duty to convict Grandier, explained that the nuns' reactions were a ploy by [[Satan]] to save Grandier. Jeanne des Anges appeared in court with a noose tied around her neck, violently stating that she would hang herself if she could not recant her earlier lies. All defenses were ignored, and some defense witnesses were pressured to keep silent. Publicly, Laubardemont announced that any citizens who testified in favour of Grandier would be arrested as traitors to the King and have their possessions confiscated. Many of these witnesses fled France.

While the defense witnesses were forced to flee, 72 witnesses swore evidence against Grandier, who was denied the normal procedure of trial by a secular court. Had he been tried by secular court, Grandier could have appealed to the [[Parlement|Parliament of Paris]]. Instead, Richelieu's committee took charge of the legal proceedings.

Grandier's trial took place in Loudun itself, and he was closely imprisoned in the converted attic of a house there for the duration of it.

Nearly a year later, August 18, 1634, the Royal Commission found Grandier guilty of all counts against him and passed sentence - Grandier would be [[Execution by burning|burned alive at the stake]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We have ordered and do order the said Urbain Grandier duly tried and convicted of the crime of magic, maleficia, and of causing demoniacal possession of several Ursuline nuns of this town of Loudun, as well as of other secular women, together with other charges and crimes resulting therefrom. For atonement of which, we have condemned and do condemn the said Grandier to make [[amende honorable]], his head bare, a rope round his neck, holding in his hand a burning taper weighing two pounds, before the principal door of the church of St. Pierre-du-Marché, and before that of St. Ursula of this town. There on his knees, to ask pardon of God, the King, and the law; this done, he is to be taken to the public square of St. Croix, and fastened to a stake on a scaffold, which shall be erected on the said place for this purpose, and there to be burned alive...and his ashes scattered to the wind. We have ordered and so do order that each and every article of his moveable property be acquired and confiscated by the King; the sum of 500 livres first being taken for buying a bronze plaque on which will be engraved the abstract of this present trial, to be set up in a prominent spot in the said church of the Ursulines, to remain there for all eternity. And before proceeding to the execution of the present sentence, we order the said Grandier to be submitted to the first and last degrees of torture, concerning his accomplices.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
All details of the sentence were carried out.

Torture was a commonplace effort to extract confessions from accused witches during the seventeenth century, clearly recommended in the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]''. Grandier was put to preliminary torture almost immediately after sentence was passed upon him. Most accused witches immediately confessed, telling their torturers exactly what they wanted to hear. Father Grandier never confessed, maintaining his innocence even under the most severe forms of [[torture]]. The method of torture used was the Brodequins, or [[Boot (torture)|Boot]], which consisted of a total of sixteen to eighteen wedges driven between planks strongly bound to his legs, designed to slowly break the bones. He refused to name any accomplices, which drove Father Tranquille to break both Grandier's legs.

==Burning at Loudun==
Father Grandier was promised that he could have the chance to speak before he was executed, making a last statement, and that he would be [[Hanging|hanged]] before the burning, an act of mercy.

The possessions failed to stop after Father Grandier's execution; as a result, public exorcisms continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rapley|first1=Robert|title=A Case of Witchcraft: The Trial of Urbain Grandier|date=1998|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|location=Montreal|isbn=0773517162|pages=198–208|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h52hgCKIyfMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his summary of the Loudun possessions, author Moshe Sluhovsky reports that these displays continued until 1637, three years after Grandier's death: "[t]he last departing demons left clear signs of their exit from her [Jeanne des Anges, the mother superior of the community] body, when the names Joseph and Mary miraculously appeared inscribed on des Anges's left arm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sluhovsky|first1=Moshe|title=The Devil in the Convent|journal=American Historical Review|date=December 2002|volume=107|issue=5|page=1380|url=http://ahr.oxfordjournals.org/content/107/5/1379.full.pdf+html|accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegedly, the [[Duchess d'Aiguillon]], niece to Cardinal Richelieu, reported the fraud to her uncle.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Having achieved his original goal, Richelieu terminated the investigations into the events at Loudun.{{citation needed|reason=seems like speculation|date=February 2013}}

Some{{who|date=February 2013}} claim that it was actually Jeanne des Anges who had the public exorcisms stopped. Jeanne allegedly had a vision that she would be freed from the [[Devil]] if she made a pilgrimage to the tomb of Saint [[Francis de Sales]]. She went to [[Annecy]], then visited Cardinal Richelieu and King [[Louis XIII]] in 1638; the demons were apparently gone.

Jeanne des Anges remained convinced of her own [[saint]]liness until she died in 1665.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Post historical analysis and criticism==
In post analysis studies, [[Augustin Calmet]], among others, has compared this case to the pretended possession of [[Martha Broissier]] (1578), a case which garnered a great deal of attention in its day. This comparison is based in part on the circumstances surrounding the incidents as well as the examinations of the possessions in question, all of which indicate pretended possessions, in contrast to cases considered more legitimate such as the possession of [[Traité sur les apparitions des esprits et sur les vampires ou les revenans de Hongrie, de Moravie, &amp;c.#Demonic possession|Mademoiselle Elizabeth de Ranfaing]] (1621).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Calmet|first1=Augustin|title=[[Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants]]: of Hungary, Moravia, et al. The Complete Volumes I &amp; II. 2016|isbn=978-1-5331-4568-0|page=138-143}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his treatise, Calmet states that the causes of the injustice committed at Loudun were a mixture of political ambition, the need for attention, and a basic desire to dispose of political opponents. Calmet places the blame for the tragedy in Loudun with [[Cardinal Richelieu]], chief minister of Louis XIII, and his goal of ruining Urbain Grandier, the Cure of Loudun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Calmet|first1=Augustin|title=[[Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants]]: of Hungary, Moravia, et al. The Complete Volumes I &amp; II. 2016|isbn=978-1-5331-4568-0|page=515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grandier became an enemy of Cardinal Richelieu when a libelous satire attributed to Grandier was anonymously published in 1618. However, his fate was likely sealed through obstructing the Cardinal's plan to demolish Loudun's fortifications, including the Castle of Loudon. The demolition, to be overseen by Jean de Laubardemont, was part of Richelieu's program of eliminating [[Huguenot]] strongholds by destroying local fortifications. The success of this mission would help cement the Cardinal's power both within the Church and within France.{{citation needed|reason=This is the first time 'Huguenots' have been mentioned here. Since Huguenots would be expected to ignore the church, Grandier would have to profit in some way, right?|date=February 2013}}

Both Protestant (Huguenot) and Catholic residents of Loudun were against the removal of their battlements, which would have left them unprotected against [[mercenary]] armies. Grandier cited the King's promise that Loudun's walls would not be destroyed, successfully preventing Laubardemont from demolishing the fortifications. Laubardemont promptly reported back to Richelieu with an account of the failed exorcisms, the libelous satire, and Grandier's obstruction of Richelieu's plans, thus setting the tragedy in Loudun and Grandier's demise in motion.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Richelieu's strategy for destroying Grandier brought with it an added benefit for the Catholic Church: conversions. Many of the Protestant townspeople converted to [[Catholicism]] as a result of the public exorcisms, further eroding any Huguenot sentiment in the region.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The '''Manson Family''' was a [[Deserts of California|desert]] [[commune]] and [[cult]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/what-ever-happened-other-manson-family-cult-members-n556561|title=What ever happened to the other Manson family cult members?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/groups/manson-family|title=The Infamous Manson Family|website=Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; formed in California in the late 1960s. Led by [[Charles Manson]], the group consisted of approximately 100 of his followers who lived an unconventional lifestyle with habitual use of [[hallucinogenic drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/charles-manson-9397912|title=Charles Manson|website=Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the group members were young women from middle-class backgrounds, many of whom were radicalised by Manson's teachings and drawn by [[hippie culture]] and communal living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42056252|title=Where are the Manson Family members now?|date=November 20, 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Manson was released from prison for petty crimes in 1967, the Manson Family moved to San Francisco and later to a deserted ranch in the San Fernando Valley. Manson’s followers also included a small, devoted unit of mostly impressionable young women and girls. They began to believe, without question, Manson's claims that he was a manifestation of Jesus and his prophecies of a race war.

They gained national and international notoriety after the [[Tate murders|murder of actress Sharon Tate]] and four others on August 9, 1969 by [[Tex Watson]] and three other members of the Family, acting under the instructions of Charles Manson. Group members were also responsible for a number of other murders, assaults, petty crimes and thefts.

===San Francisco followers===
Upon his release from prison on March 21, 1967, Manson received permission to move to [[San Francisco]], where, with the help of a prison acquaintance, he moved into an apartment in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. In prison, bank robber [[Alvin Karpis]] had taught him to play the [[steel guitar]].&lt;ref name="bugliosi"&gt;Bugliosi, Vincent with Gentry, Curt. ''Helter Skelter&amp;nbsp;— The True Story of the Manson Murders 25th Anniversary Edition'', W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 1994. {{ISBN|0-393-08700-X}}, {{OCLC|15164618}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|137–146}}&lt;ref name="emmons"&gt;Emmons, Nuel. ''Manson in His Own Words''. Grove Press, New York (1988); {{ISBN|0-8021-3024-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karpis, Alvin, with Robert Livesey. ''On the Rock: Twenty-five Years at Alcatraz'', 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Living mostly by begging, he soon got to know [[Mary Brunner]], a 23-year-old graduate of the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. Brunner was working as a library assistant at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and Manson moved in with her. According to a second-hand account, he overcame her resistance to his bringing other women in to live with them. Before long, they were sharing Brunner's residence with 18 other women.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|163–174}}

Manson established himself as a guru in San Francisco's [[Haight-Ashbury]] district, which during 1967's "[[Summer of Love]]" was emerging as the signature [[hippie]] locale. Vincent Bugliosi said in his book [[Helter Skelter (book)|''Helter Skelter'']] that Manson appeared to have borrowed philosophically from [[The Process Church of The Final Judgment]], whose members believed [[Satan]] would become reconciled to [[Jesus|Christ]], and they would come together at the end of the world to judge humanity. Expounding a philosophy that included some of the [[Scientology]] he had studied in prison,&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|163–164}} he soon had the first of his groups of followers, which have been called the ''Manson Family'', most of them female.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|137–146}} Upon a staff evaluation of Manson when he entered prison in July 1961 at the U.S. penitentiary in [[McNeil Island]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], Manson entered "Scientologist" as his religion.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|143–144}}

Manson taught his followers that they were the reincarnation of the original Christians, and that the Romans were the establishment. He strongly implied that he was Christ; he often told a story envisioning himself on the cross with the nails in his feet and hands. Sometime around 1967, he began using the alias "Charles Willis Manson."  He often said it very slowly ("Charles's Will Is Man's Son")—implying that his will was the same as that of the [[Son of man|Son of Man]].&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|315}}

Before the summer ended, Manson and eight or nine of his enthusiasts piled into an old school bus they had re-wrought in hippie style, with colored rugs and pillows in place of the many seats they had removed. They roamed as far north as [[Washington (state)|Washington State]], then southward through Los Angeles, Mexico, and the southwest. Returning to the Los Angeles area, they lived in [[Topanga, California|Topanga Canyon]], [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], and [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice]]—western parts of the city and county.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|163–174}}&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, Ed (2002). ''The Family''. New York: Thunder's Mouth Press. {{ISBN|1-56025-396-7}}. Pages 13–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 Brunner had become pregnant by Manson and, on April 15, 1968, gave birth to a son she named Valentine Michael (nicknamed "Pooh Bear")&lt;ref&gt;Bugliosi, Vincent: ''Helter Skelter'', 1994. pg. 513&lt;/ref&gt; in a condemned house in [[Topanga, California|Topanga Canyon]], assisted during the birth by several of the young women from the Family. Brunner (like most members of the group) acquired a number of aliases and nicknames, including: "Marioche", "Och", "Mother Mary", "Mary Manson", "Linda Dee Manson" and "Christine Marie Euchts".&lt;ref&gt;Bugliosi, Vincent: ''Helter Skelter'', 1974. pg. ''xv''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manson's presentation of himself ===
Actor [[Al Lewis (actor)|Al Lewis]], who had Manson babysit his children on a couple of occasions, described him as "a nice guy when I knew him".&lt;ref name="Charles Manson By Simon Wells"&gt;''Charles Manson'' by Simon Wells&lt;/ref&gt; Through [[Phil Kaufman (producer)|Phil Kaufman]], Manson got an introduction to young [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]] producer Gary Stromberg, then working on a film adaptation of the life of Jesus set in modern America with a black Jesus and southern redneck "Romans". Stromberg thought Manson made interesting suggestions about what Jesus might do in a situation, seeming strangely attuned to the role; to illustrate the place of women he had one of his women kiss his feet, but then kissed hers in return. At the beach one day, Stromberg watched while Manson preached against a materialistic outlook only to be questioned about his well-furnished bus. Nonchalant, he tossed the bus keys to the doubter who promptly drove it away while Manson watched apparently unconcerned.&lt;ref&gt;''Manson: The Life and Times of Charles Manson''. By Jeff Guinn. p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stromberg, Manson had a dynamic personality with an ability to read a person's weaknesses and "play" them.&lt;ref name="Charles Manson By Simon Wells" /&gt; Trying to co-opt an influential individual from a motorcycle gang by granting him access to "Family" women, Manson claimed to be sexually pathetic and convinced the biker that his outsized endowment was all that kept the "Family" females at Spahn ranch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Vincent Bugliosi|last=Bugliosi|first=Vincent|last2=Gentry|first2=Curt|year=1974|title=Helter Skelter|publisher=Arrow Books Limited|page=146|isbn=0-09-997500-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion, the enraged father of a runaway girl who had joined the "Family" pointed a shotgun at Manson and told him he was about to die. Manson quietly invited him in.

=== Involvement with Wilson, Melcher, and others ===
{{See also|Never Learn Not to Love|The Beach Boys bootleg recordings#Manson sessions}}
[[File:Dennis Wilson in 1966.png|thumb|right|[[Dennis Wilson]] with [[the Beach Boys]] in late 1966]]
The events that would culminate in the murders were set in motion in late spring 1968, when (by some accounts) [[Dennis Wilson]] of [[the Beach Boys]] picked up two hitchhiking Manson women, [[Patricia Krenwinkel]] and Ella Jo Bailey,&lt;ref&gt;"The Six Degrees of Helter Skelter", 2009 Documentary&lt;/ref&gt; and brought them to his [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]] house for a few hours. Returning home in the early hours of the following morning from a night recording session, Wilson was greeted in the driveway of his own residence by Manson, who emerged from the house. Uncomfortable, Wilson asked the stranger whether he intended to hurt him. Assuring him he had no such intent, Manson began kissing Wilson's feet.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|250–253}}&lt;ref name="sanders34"&gt;Sanders 2002, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Inside the house, Wilson discovered 12 strangers, mostly women.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|250–253}}&lt;ref name="sanders34" /&gt; 

The account given in ''Manson in His Own Words'' is that Manson first met Wilson at a friend's San Francisco house where Manson had gone to obtain cannabis. The drummer supposedly gave Manson his [[Sunset Boulevard]] address and invited him to stop by when he came to Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="emmons" /&gt; Wilson himself said, in a 1968 ''[[Record Mirror]]'' article, that after mentioning the Beach Boys' involvement with [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] to a group of strange women, "they told me they too had a guru, a guy named Charlie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Griffiths|first1=David|title=Dennis Wilson: "I Live With 17 Girls"|journal=Record Mirror|date=December 21, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Over the next few months, as the number of women in Wilson's house doubled, the Family members who made themselves part of his Sunset Boulevard household cost him approximately $100,000. This included a large medical bill for treatment of their [[gonorrhea]] and $21,000 for the accidental destruction of his uninsured car, which they borrowed.&lt;ref name="watkins4"&gt;Watkins, Paul with Soledad, Guillermo (1979). ''My Life with Charles Manson'', Bantam. {{ISBN|0-553-12788-8}}. Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson would sing and talk with Manson, while the women were treated as servants to them both.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|250–253}}

Wilson paid for studio time to record songs written and performed by Manson. Wilson introduced Manson to entertainment business acquaintances. These included [[Gregg Jakobson]], [[Terry Melcher]] and Rudi Altobelli (the last of whom owned a house he would soon rent to actress [[Sharon Tate]] and her husband, director [[Roman Polanski]]).&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|250–253}} Jakobson, who was impressed by "the whole Charlie Manson package" of artist/lifestylist/philosopher, also paid to record Manson material.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|155–161, 185–188, 214–219}}&lt;ref name="watson9"&gt;{{cite web|work=aboundinglove.org|url=http://www.aboundinglove.org/sensational/wydfm/wydfm-009.php|author=Watson, Charles as told to Ray Hoekstra|title=Will You Die for Me?|access-date=May 3, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405004745/http://aboundinglove.org/sensational/wydfm/wydfm-009.php|archivedate=April 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spahn Ranch ===
Manson established a base for the group at [[Spahn Ranch|Spahn's Movie Ranch]], not far from Topanga Canyon Boulevard, in August 1968, after Wilson's manager evicted the Family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://la.curbed.com/2014/10/22/10032594/the-story-of-the-abandoned-movie-ranch-where-the-manson-family The Story of the Abandoned Movie Ranch Where the Manson Family Launched Helter Skelter]. Retrieved March 10, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The entire Family then relocated to the ranch.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|250–253}} The ranch had been a television and movie set for [[Western (genre)|Western]] productions. However, by the late 1960s, the buildings had deteriorated and the ranch was earning money primarily by selling horseback rides.

Family members did helpful work around the grounds. Also, Manson ordered the Family's women, including [[Lynette Fromme|Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme]], to occasionally have sex with the nearly blind, 80-year-old owner, [[George Spahn]]. The women also acted as seeing-eye guides for Spahn. In exchange, Spahn allowed Manson and his group to live at the ranch for free.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|99–113}}&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, pages 34 &amp; 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Squeaky acquired her nickname because she often squeaked when Spahn pinched her thigh.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|163–174}}&lt;ref name="watkins4" /&gt;

[[Tex Watson|Charles Watson]] soon joined the group at Spahn's ranch. Watson, a small-town [[Texas|Texan]] who had quit college and moved to California,&lt;ref name="watson4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboundinglove.org/sensational/wydfm/wydfm-004.php|title=Watson, Ch. 4|publisher=Aboundinglove.org|access-date=November 28, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212120305/http://www.aboundinglove.org/sensational/wydfm/wydfm-004.php|archivedate=December 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; met Manson at Dennis Wilson's house. Watson gave Wilson a ride while Wilson was hitchhiking after his car was wrecked.

Spahn nicknamed Watson "Tex" because of his pronounced Texan drawl.

=== Helter Skelter ===
{{Main|Helter Skelter (Manson scenario)}}
{{summarize|from|Helter Skelter (Manson scenario)|section=y|brevity=y|date=July 2016}}

In the first days of November 1968, Manson established the Family at alternative headquarters in [[Death Valley]]'s environs, where they occupied two unused or little-used ranches, Myers and [[Barker Ranch|Barker]].&lt;ref name="watson9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="watkins10"&gt;Watkins, Ch. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The former, to which the group had initially headed, was owned by the grandmother of a new woman (Catherine Gillies) in the Family. The latter was owned by an elderly local woman (Arlene Barker) to whom Manson presented himself and a male Family member as musicians in need of a place congenial to their work. When the woman agreed to let them stay if they'd fix things up, Manson honored her with one of the Beach Boys' [[Music recording sales certification|gold records]],&lt;ref name="watkins10" /&gt; several of which he had been given by Wilson.&lt;ref name="watkins11"&gt;Watkins, Ch. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

While back at Spahn Ranch, no later than December, Manson and Watson visited a Topanga Canyon acquaintance who played them the [[The Beatles|Beatles']] [[The Beatles (album)|''White Album'']], then recently released.&lt;ref name="watson9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=1|title=Manson|work=aboundinglove.org|url=http://www.aboundinglove.org/sensational/mrhmso/mrhmso-002.php|publisher=Manson's Right-Hand Man Speaks Out!|isbn=0-9678519-1-2|access-date=November 21, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011190804/http://aboundinglove.org/sensational/mrhmso/mrhmso-002.php|archivedate=October 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="watkins12"&gt;Watkins, Ch. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Manson became obsessed with the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Larry King Interview with Paul Watkins|work=[[CNN]] [[Larry King Live]]: Interview with Paul Watkins}} Manson's obsession with the Beatles is discussed at the interview's very end.&lt;/ref&gt; At [[McNeil Island]] prison, he had told fellow inmates, including [[Alvin Karpis]], that he could surpass the group in fame;&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|200–202, 265}}&lt;ref&gt;Sanders 2002, 11.&lt;/ref&gt; to the Family, he spoke of the group as "the soul" and "part of the hole in the infinite".&lt;ref name="watkins12" /&gt;

In early January 1969, the Family escaped the desert's cold and positioned itself to monitor L.A.'s supposed tensions by moving to a canary-yellow home in [[Canoga Park, Los Angeles|Canoga Park]], not far from the Spahn Ranch.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|244–247}}&lt;ref name="watkins12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanders 2002, 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; Because this locale would allow the group to remain "submerged beneath the awareness of the outside world",&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|244–247}}&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Manson called it the [[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]], another Beatles reference.

By February, Manson's vision was complete. The Family would create an album whose songs, as subtle as those of the Beatles, would trigger the predicted chaos. Ghastly murders of whites by blacks would be met with retaliation, and a split between racist and non-racist whites would yield whites' self-annihilation. Blacks' triumph, as it were, would merely precede their being ruled by the Family, which would ride out the conflict in "the bottomless pit", a secret city beneath Death Valley.&lt;ref name="umkc canoga park"&gt;[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/manson/mansontestimony-w.html Testimony of Paul Watkins in the Charles Manson Trial] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320085827/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/manson/mansontestimony-w.html |date=March 20, 2007 }} UMKC Law.

At the Canoga Park house, while Family members worked on vehicles and pored over maps to prepare for their desert escape, they also worked on songs for their world-changing album. When they were told [[Terry Melcher]] was to come to the house to hear the material, the women prepared a meal and cleaned the place, but Melcher never arrived.&lt;ref name="watson11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="watkins13"&gt;Watkins, Ch. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Alternative theories ====
There are alternative theories to the Helter Skelter scenario and whether or not it was the actual motive behind the murders. According to Manson Family associate [[Bobby Beausoleil]], it was actually Beausoleil's arrest for the torture and murder of Gary Hinman that instigated the Manson Family's ensuing murder spree—enacted to convince police that the killer(s) of Gary Hinman were in fact still at large. This has been substantiated by interviews of Beausoleil by [[Truman Capote]], and by [[Ann Louise Bardach]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bardachreports.com/articles/oa_19811100.htm Jailhouse Interview: Bobby Beausoleil by Ann Louise Bardach] Retrieved March 10, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Encounter with Tate ===
[[File:Sharon Tate Valley of the Dolls 1967.jpg|thumb|200px|Sharon Tate in 1967.]]
On March 23, 1969,&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|228–233}} Manson, uninvited, entered [[10050 Cielo Drive]], which he had known as Melcher's residence.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|155–161}} This was Rudi Altobelli's property; Melcher was only a previous tenant. As of February 1969,&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|28–38}} the tenants were [[Sharon Tate]] and [[Roman Polanski]].

Manson was met by Shahrokh Hatami, an Iranian photographer who was Tate's friend. Hatami was there to photograph Tate in advance of her departure for Rome the next day. Having seen Manson through a window as Manson approached the main house, Hatami had gone onto the front porch to ask him what he wanted.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|228–233}}

When Manson told Hatami he was looking for someone whose name Hatami did not recognize, Hatami informed him the place was the Polanski residence. Hatami advised him to try "the back alley", by which he meant the path to the guest house, beyond the main house.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|228–233}} Concerned about the stranger on the property, Hatami went down to the front walk to confront Manson. Appearing behind Hatami, in the house's front door, Tate asked him who was calling. Hatami said a man was looking for someone. Hatami and Tate maintained their positions while Manson, without a word, went back to the guest house, returned a minute or two later, and left.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|228–233}}

That evening, Manson returned to the property and again went back to the guest house. Presuming to enter the enclosed porch, he spoke with Altobelli, who was just coming out of the shower. Although Manson asked for Melcher, Altobelli felt Manson had come looking for him.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|226}} This is consistent with prosecutor [[Vincent Bugliosi]]'s later discovery that Manson had apparently been to the place on earlier occasions after Melcher's departure from it.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|228–233, 369–377}}

Speaking through the inner screen door, Altobelli told Manson that Melcher had moved to [[Malibu, California|Malibu]]. He lied and said that he did not know Melcher's new address. In response to a question from Manson, Altobelli said he was in the entertainment business, although, having met Manson the previous year at Dennis Wilson's home, he was sure Manson already knew that. At Wilson's, Altobelli had complimented Manson lukewarmly on some of his musical recordings that Wilson had been playing.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|228–233}}

When Altobelli informed Manson he was going out of the country the next day, Manson said he'd like to speak with him upon his return; Altobelli lied that he would be gone for more than a year. In response to a direct question from Altobelli, Manson explained that he had been directed to the guest house by the persons in the main house; Altobelli expressed the wish that Manson not disturb his tenants.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|228–233}}

Manson left. As Altobelli flew with Tate to Rome the next day, Tate asked him whether "that creepy-looking guy" had gone back to the guest house the day before.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|228–233}}

On May 18, 1969, Terry Melcher visited Spahn Ranch to hear Manson and the women sing.

Manson countered on July 1, 1969, by shooting Crowe at his [[Hollywood]] apartment.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|99–113}}&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|91–96}}&lt;ref name="watson13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboundinglove.org/sensational/wydfm/wydfm-013.php|title=Watson, Ch. 13|publisher=Aboundinglove.org|date=August 8, 1969|access-date=November 28, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119075249/http://aboundinglove.org/sensational/wydfm/wydfm-013.php|archivedate=November 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanders 2002, 147–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manson's belief that he had killed Crowe was seemingly confirmed by a news report of the discovery of the dumped body of a [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] in Los Angeles. Although Crowe was not a member of the Black Panthers, Manson concluded he had been and expected retaliation from the Panthers.

Gary Allen Hinman was a music teacher and PhD student at [[UCLA]]. He had been described as a "kind, gentle soul" who would often open his house up to those needing a place to stay. At some point in the late 1960s, he befriended members of the Manson Family, with some staying at his home on occasion.&lt;ref name="cielodrive.com"/&gt;

Manson was under the impression that Hinman had considerable stocks and bonds and owned his property. Believing that he was wealthy, Manson sent Family member [[Bobby Beausoleil]] along with [[Mary Brunner]] and [[Susan Atkins]] to Hinman's home on July 25, 1969, to convince Gary to join the Family, which included turning over the assets Manson thought Hinman had inherited.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|75–77}}&lt;ref name="watson13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="atkins"&gt;{{cite book|title=Child of Satan, Child of God|publisher=Plainfield, NJ: Logos International | year=1977 | isbn=0-88270-276-9 | pages=94–120 | author=Atkins, Susan, with Slosser, Bob}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three held the uncooperative Hinman hostage for two days, during which Manson showed up with a sword to slash his ear. After that, Beausoleil stabbed Hinman to death, ostensibly on Manson's instruction. Before leaving the Topanga Canyon residence, Beausoleil, or one of the women, used Hinman's blood to write "Political piggy"&lt;!--"Piggy", not "Piggie"; photo is in Bugliosi 1994, between pages 142 and 143--&gt; on the wall and to draw a panther paw, a Black Panther symbol.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|33, 91–96, 99–113}}&lt;ref&gt;Sanders 2002, page 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Atkins, in her 1977 autobiography, wrote that Manson directly told Beausoleil, Brunner, and her to go to Hinman's and get the supposed inheritance of $21,000. She said Manson had told her privately, two days earlier, that, if she wanted to "do something important", she could kill Hinman and get his money.&lt;ref name="atkins" /&gt; Beausoleil was arrested on August 6, 1969, after he had been caught driving Hinman's car.

On the night of August 8, 1969, Manson directed Watson to take [[Susan Atkins]], [[Linda Kasabian]], and [[Patricia Krenwinkel]] to Melcher's former home at [[10050 Cielo Drive]] in Los Angeles and kill everyone there. The home had only recently been rented to celebrity couple Sharon Tate and director [[Roman Polanski]]. Manson told the three women to do as Watson told them. The Family members proceeded to kill the five people they found: actress [[Sharon Tate]] (who was eight months pregnant; her unborn child was also killed), who was living there at the time; [[Jay Sebring]], Abigail Folger, and Wojciech Frykowski, who were visiting her; and [[Tate murders#Murders|Steven Parent]], who had been visiting the caretaker of the home. Polanski was not present on the night of the murders as he was working on a film in Europe. Atkins wrote "pig" in blood on the front door as they left.

The next night of August 9, 1969, six Family members—[[Leslie Van Houten]], [[Steve "Clem" Grogan]], and the four from the previous night—drove out on Manson's orders. Displeased by the panic of the victims at Cielo Drive, Manson accompanied the six, "to show them how to do it."&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|176–184, 258–269}}&lt;ref name="watson15"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboundinglove.org/sensational/wydfm/wydfm-015.php|title=Watson, Ch. 15|publisher=Aboundinglove.org|access-date=November 28, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119080010/http://aboundinglove.org/sensational/wydfm/wydfm-015.php|archivedate=November 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a few hours' ride, in which he considered a number of murders and even attempted one of them,&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|258–269}}&lt;ref name="watson15" /&gt; Manson gave Kasabian directions that brought the group to 3301 Waverly Drive. This was the home of supermarket executive Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary, a dress shop co-owner.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|22–25, 42–48}} Located in the [[Los Feliz, Los Angeles|Los Feliz]] section of Los Angeles, it was next door to a house at which Manson and Family members had attended a party the previous year.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|176–184, 204–210}}

According to Atkins and Kasabian, Manson disappeared up the driveway and returned to say he had tied up the house's occupants. He then sent Watson up with Krenwinkel and Van Houten.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|176–184, 258–269}} In his autobiography, Watson stated that having gone up alone, Manson returned to take him up to the house with him. After Manson pointed out a sleeping man through a window, the two of them entered through the unlocked back door.&lt;ref name="watson15" /&gt; Watson added at trial, he "went along with" the women's account, which he figured made him "look that much less responsible."&lt;ref name="watson19"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboundinglove.org/sensational/wydfm/wydfm-007.php|title=Watson, Ch. 19|publisher=Aboundinglove.org|access-date=November 28, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119080347/http://aboundinglove.org/sensational/wydfm/wydfm-007.php|archivedate=November 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Watson related it, Manson roused the sleeping Leno LaBianca from the couch at gunpoint and had Watson bind his hands with a leather thong. After Rosemary was brought briefly into the living room from the bedroom, Watson followed Manson's instructions to cover the couple's heads with pillowcases. He bound these in place with lamp cords. Manson left, sending Krenwinkel and [[Leslie Van Houten]] into the house with instructions that the couple be killed.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|176–184, 258–269}}&lt;ref name="watson15" /&gt;

Before leaving Spahn Ranch, Watson had complained to Manson of the inadequacy of the previous night's weapons.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|258–269}} Now, sending the women from the kitchen to the bedroom to which Rosemary LaBianca had been returned, he went to the living room and began stabbing Leno LaBianca with a chrome-plated bayonet. The first thrust went into the man's throat.&lt;ref name="watson15" /&gt;

Sounds of a scuffle in the bedroom drew Watson there to discover Mrs. LaBianca keeping the women at bay by swinging the lamp tied to her neck. After subduing her with several stabs of the bayonet, he returned to the living room and resumed attacking Leno, whom he stabbed a total of 12 times with the bayonet. When he had finished, Watson carved "WAR" on the man's exposed abdomen. He stated this in his autobiography.&lt;ref name="watson15" /&gt; In an unclear portion of her eventual [[grand jury]] testimony, Atkins, who did not enter the LaBianca house, said she believed Krenwinkel had carved the word.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|176–184}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Atkinson grand jury testimony|work=Afternoon grand-jury testimony of Susan Atkins, Los Angeles, California, December&amp;nbsp;5, 1969}} The statement comes in a moment of confusion on the part of Atkins; it's possible she's saying she believes Krenwinkel is the person who ''told her'' about the carving of "War".&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[ghostwriter|ghost-written]] newspaper account based on a statement she had made earlier to her attorney,&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|160,193}} she said Watson carved it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Susan Atkins' Story of 2 Nights of Murder|journal=Los Angeles Times|date=December 14, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to the bedroom, Watson found Krenwinkel stabbing Rosemary LaBianca with a knife from the LaBianca kitchen. Heeding Manson's instruction to make sure each of the women played a part, Watson told Van Houten to stab Mrs. LaBianca too.&lt;ref name="watson15" /&gt; She did, stabbing her approximately 16 times in the back and the exposed buttocks.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|204–210, 297–300, 341–344}} At trial, Van Houten would claim, uncertainly,&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|433}} that Rosemary LaBianca was dead when she stabbed her. Evidence showed that many of Mrs. LaBianca's 41 stab wounds had, in fact, been inflicted post-mortem.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|44, 206, 297, 341–42, 380, 404, 406–07, 433}}

While Watson cleaned off the bayonet and showered, Krenwinkel wrote "Rise" and "Death to pigs" on the walls and "Healter {{sic}} Skelter" on the refrigerator door, all in LaBianca's blood. She gave Leno LaBianca 14 puncture wounds with an ivory-handled, two-tined carving fork, which she left jutting out of his stomach. She also planted a steak knife in his throat.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|176–184, 258–269}}&lt;ref name="watson15" /&gt;

Meanwhile, hoping for a double crime, Manson had gone on to direct Kasabian to drive to the [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice]] home of an actor acquaintance of hers, another "piggy". Depositing the other three Family members who had departed Spahn with him that evening at the man's apartment building, Manson drove back to Spahn Ranch, leaving them and the LaBianca killers to hitchhike home.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|176–184, 258–269}} Kasabian thwarted this murder by deliberately knocking on the wrong apartment door and waking a stranger. As the group abandoned the murder plan and left, Atkins defecated in the stairwell.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|270–273}}

== Investigation and trial ==
=== Investigation ===
The Tate murders became national news on August 9, 1969. The Polanskis' housekeeper, Winifred Chapman, had arrived for work that morning and discovered the murder scene.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|5–6, 11–15}} On August 10, detectives of the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]], which had jurisdiction in the Hinman case, informed [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) detectives assigned to the Tate case of the bloody writing at the Hinman house. Thinking the Tate murders were a consequence of a drug transaction, the Tate team ignored this and the crimes' other similarities.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|28–38}}&lt;ref&gt;Sanders 2002, 243–44.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tate autopsies were under way and the LaBianca bodies were yet to be discovered.

Steven Parent, the shooting victim in the Tate driveway, was determined to have been an acquaintance of William Garretson, who lived in the guest house. Garretson was a young man hired by Rudi Altobelli to take care of the property while Altobelli was away.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|28–38}} As the killers arrived, Parent had been leaving Cielo Drive, after a visit to Garretson.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|28–38}}

Held briefly as a Tate suspect, Garretson told police he had neither seen nor heard anything on the murder night. He was released on August 11, 1969, after undergoing a [[polygraph]] examination that indicated he had not been involved in the crimes.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|28–38, 42–48}}  Interviewed decades later, he stated he had, in fact, witnessed a portion of the murders, as the examination suggested.  Garretson died in August 2016.

The LaBianca crime scene was discovered at about 10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on August 10, approximately 19 hours after the murders were committed. Fifteen-year-old Frank Struthers—Rosemary's son from a prior marriage and Leno's stepson—returned from a camping trip and was disturbed by seeing all of the window shades of his home drawn and by the fact that his stepfather's speedboat was still attached to the family car, which was parked in the driveway. He called his older sister and her boyfriend. The boyfriend, Joe Dorgan, accompanied the younger Struthers into the home and discovered Leno's body. Rosemary's body was found by investigating police officers.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|38}}

On August 12, 1969, the LAPD told the press it had ruled out any connection between the Tate and LaBianca homicides.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|42–48}} On August 16, the sheriff's office raided Spahn Ranch and arrested Manson and 25 others, as "suspects in a major auto theft ring" that had been stealing [[Volkswagen Beetle]]s and converting them into [[Dune buggy|dune buggies]]. Weapons were seized, but, because the warrant had been misdated, the group was released a few days later.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|56}}

In a report at the end of August when virtually all leads had gone nowhere, the LaBianca detectives noted a possible connection between the bloody writings at the LaBianca house and "the singing group the Beatles' most recent album."&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|65}}

==== Breakthrough ====
Still working separately from the Tate team, the LaBianca team checked with the sheriff's office in mid-October about possible similar crimes. They learned of the Hinman case. They also learned that the Hinman detectives had spoken with Beausoleil's girlfriend, Kitty Lutesinger. She had been arrested a few days earlier with members of "the Manson Family".&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|75–77}}

The arrests, for car thefts, had taken place at the desert ranches, to which the Family had moved and whence, unknown to authorities, its members had been searching Death Valley for a hole in the ground—access to the Bottomless Pit.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|228–233}}&lt;ref name="watkins21"&gt;Watkins, Ch. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="watson2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboundinglove.org/sensational/wydfm/wydfm-002.php|title=Watson, Ch. 2|publisher=Aboundinglove.org|access-date=November 28, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111162619/http://aboundinglove.org/sensational/wydfm/wydfm-002.php|archivedate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A joint force of [[National Park Service Ranger]]s and officers from the [[California Highway Patrol]] and the [[Inyo County, California|Inyo County]] Sheriff's Office—federal, state, and county personnel—had raided both Myers Ranch and Barker Ranch after following clues unwittingly left when Family members burned an [[Heavy equipment|earthmover]] owned by [[Death Valley National Park|Death Valley National Monument]].&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|125–127}}&lt;ref&gt;Sanders 2002, 282–83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="watkins22"&gt;Watkins, Ch. 22&lt;/ref&gt; The raiders had found stolen dune buggies and other vehicles and had arrested two dozen people, including Manson. A Highway Patrol officer found Manson hiding in a cabinet beneath Barker's bathroom sink. The officers had no idea that the people they were arresting were involved with the murders.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|75–77, 125–127}}

Following up leads a month after they had spoken with Lutesinger, LaBianca detectives contacted members of a motorcycle gang Manson tried to enlist as his bodyguards while the Family was at Spahn Ranch.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|75–77}} While the gang members were providing information that suggested a link between Manson and the murders,&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|84–90, 99–113}} a dormitory mate of [[Susan Atkins]] informed LAPD of the Family's involvement in the crimes.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|99–113}} Atkins was booked for the Hinman murder after she told the sheriff's detectives that she had been involved in it.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|75–77}}&lt;ref&gt;Report on questioning of Katherine Lutesinger and Susan Atkins October 13, 1969, by Los Angeles Sheriff's officers Paul Whiteley and Charles Guenther.&lt;/ref&gt; Transferred to [[Sybil Brand Institute]], a detention center in Los Angeles, she had begun talking to bunkmates Ronnie Howard and Virginia Graham, to whom she gave accounts of the events in which she had been involved.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|91–96}}

==== Apprehension ====
[[File:Charles-mansonbookingphoto.jpg|thumb|County Sheriff mugshot of Manson August 16, 1969. He was arrested on suspicion of car theft. Those charges were later dropped on account of a misdated warrant.]]

On December 1, 1969, acting on the information from these sources, LAPD announced warrants for the arrest of Watson, Krenwinkel, and Kasabian in the Tate case; the suspects' involvement in the LaBianca murders was noted. Manson and Atkins, already in custody, were not mentioned; the connection between the LaBianca case and Van Houten, who was also among those arrested near Death Valley, had not yet been recognized.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|125–127, 155–161, 176–184}}

Watson and Krenwinkel were already under arrest, with authorities in [[McKinney, Texas|McKinney]], Texas, and [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], Alabama, having picked them up on notice from LAPD.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|155–161}} Informed that a warrant was out for her arrest, Kasabian voluntarily surrendered to authorities in [[Concord, New Hampshire]], on December 2.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|155–161}}

Before long, physical evidence such as Krenwinkel's and Watson's fingerprints, which had been collected by LAPD at Cielo Drive,&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|15, 156, 273, and photographs between 340–41}} was augmented by evidence recovered by the public. On September 1, 1969, the distinctive .22-caliber Hi Standard "Buntline Special" revolver Watson used on Parent, Sebring, and Frykowski had been found and given to the police by Steven Weiss, a 10-year-old who lived near the Tate residence.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|66}} In mid-December, when the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' published a crime account based on information Susan Atkins had given her attorney,&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|160,193}} Weiss' father made several phone calls which finally prompted LAPD to locate the gun in its evidence file and connect it with the murders via ballistics tests.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|198–199}}

Acting on that same newspaper account, a local [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television crew quickly located and recovered the bloody clothing discarded by the Tate killers.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|197–198}} The knives discarded en route from the Tate residence were never recovered, despite a search by some of the same crewmen and months later by LAPD.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|198, 273}}  A knife found behind the cushion of a chair in the Tate living room was apparently that of Susan Atkins, who lost her knife in the course of the attack.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|17, 180, 262}}&lt;ref&gt;Atkins 1977, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial began June 15, 1970.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|297–300}} The prosecution's main witness was Kasabian, who, along with Manson, Atkins, and Krenwinkel, had been charged with seven counts of murder and one of [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]].&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|185–188}} Since Kasabian, by all accounts, had not participated in the killings, she was granted [[Qualified immunity|immunity]] in exchange for testimony that detailed the nights of the crimes.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|214–219, 250–253, 330–332}} Originally, a deal had been made with Atkins in which the prosecution agreed not to seek the death penalty against her in exchange for her grand jury testimony on which the indictments were secured; once Atkins repudiated that testimony, the deal was withdrawn.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|169, 173–184, 188, 292}} Because Van Houten had participated only in the LaBianca killings, she was charged with two counts of murder and one of conspiracy.

Originally, Judge [[William B. Keene|William Keene]] had reluctantly granted Manson permission to [[Pro se legal representation in the United States|act as his own attorney]]. Because of Manson's conduct, including violations of a [[gag order]] and submission of "outlandish" and "nonsensical" [[motion (legal)|pretrial motions]], the permission was withdrawn before the trial's start.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|200–202, 265}} Manson filed an affidavit of prejudice against Keene, who was replaced by Judge [[Charles Older|Charles H. Older]].&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|290}} On Friday, July 24, the first day of testimony, Manson appeared in court with an X carved into his forehead. He issued a statement that he was "considered inadequate and incompetent to speak or defend [him]self"—and had "X'd [him]self from [the establishment's] world."&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|310}}&lt;ref&gt;Sanders 2002, 388.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following weekend, the female defendants duplicated the mark on their own foreheads, as did most Family members within another day or so.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|316}} (Years later, Manson carved the X into a swastika. See "[[Manson Family#Remaining in view|Remaining in view]]", below.)

The prosecution argued the triggering of "Helter Skelter" was Manson's main motive.&lt;ref name="Prosecution's closing argument" /&gt; The crime scene's bloody ''White Album'' references (''pig'', ''rise'', ''helter skelter'') were correlated with testimony about Manson predictions that the murders blacks would commit at the outset of Helter Skelter would involve the writing of "pigs" on walls in victims' blood.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|244–247, 450–457}}

Testimony that Manson had said "now is the time for Helter Skelter" was supplemented with Kasabian's testimony that, on the night of the LaBianca murders, Manson considered discarding Rosemary LaBianca's wallet on the street of a black neighborhood. Having obtained the wallet in the LaBianca house, he "wanted a black person to pick it up and use the credit cards so that the people, [[The Establishment]], would think it was some sort of an organized group that killed these people."&lt;ref name="Prosecution's closing argument" /&gt; On his direction, Kasabian had hidden it in the women's restroom of a service station near a black area.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|176–184, 190–191, 258–269, 369–377}} "I want to show blackie how to do it," Manson had said as the Family members had driven along after the departure from the LaBianca house.

==== Ongoing disruptions ====
During the trial, Family members loitered near the entrances and corridors of the courthouse. To keep them out of the courtroom proper, the prosecution [[subpoena]]ed them as prospective witnesses, who would not be able to enter while others were testifying.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|309}} When the group established itself in vigil on the sidewalk, some members wore sheathed hunting knives{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} that, although in plain view, were carried legally. Each of them was also identifiable by the X on his or her forehead.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|339}}

Some Family members attempted to dissuade witnesses from testifying. Prosecution witnesses [[Paul Watkins (Manson Family)|Paul Watkins]] and Juan Flynn were both threatened;&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|280, 332–335}} Watkins was badly burned in a suspicious fire in his van.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|280}} Former Family member Barbara Hoyt, who had overheard [[Susan Atkins]] describing the Tate murders to Family member Ruth Ann Moorehouse, agreed to accompany the latter to Hawaii. There, Moorehouse allegedly gave her a hamburger spiked with several doses of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]]. Found sprawled on a [[Honolulu]] curb in a drugged semi-stupor, Hoyt was taken to the hospital, where she did her best to identify herself as a witness in the Tate–LaBianca murder trial. Before the incident, Hoyt had been a reluctant witness; after the attempt to silence her, her reticence disappeared.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|348–350, 361}}

On August 4, despite precautions taken by the court, Manson flashed the jury a ''Los Angeles Times'' front page whose headline was "Manson Guilty, Nixon Declares". This was a reference to a statement made the previous day when U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] had decried what he saw as the media's glamorization of Manson. [[Voir dire]]d by Judge Charles Older, the jurors contended that the headline had not influenced them. The next day, the female defendants stood up and said in unison that, in light of Nixon's remark, there was no point in going on with the trial.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|323–238}}

On October 5, Manson was denied the court's permission to question a prosecution witness whom the defense attorneys had declined to [[cross-examination|cross-examine]]. Leaping over the defense table, Manson attempted to attack the judge. Wrestled to the ground by bailiffs, he was removed from the courtroom with the female defendants, who had subsequently risen and begun chanting in Latin.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|369–377}} Thereafter, Older allegedly began wearing a revolver under his robes.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|369–377}}

==== Defense rests ====
On November 16, the prosecution rested its case. Three days later, after arguing standard dismissal motions, the defense stunned the court by resting as well, without calling a single witness. Shouting their disapproval, Atkins, Krenwinkel, and Van Houten demanded their right to testify.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|382–388}}

In chambers, the women's lawyers told the judge their clients wanted to testify that they had planned and committed the crimes and that Manson had not been involved.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|382–388}}  By resting their case, the defense lawyers had tried to stop this; Van Houten's attorney, [[Ronald Hughes]], vehemently stated that he would not "push a client out the window". In the prosecutor's view, it was Manson who was advising the women to testify in this way as a means of saving himself.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|382–388}} Speaking about the trial in a 1987 documentary, Krenwinkel said, "The entire proceedings were scripted—by Charlie."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]''—"Charles Manson." [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E Network]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, Manson testified. Lest Manson's address violate the [[Supreme Court of California|California Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''People v. Aranda'' by making statements implicating his co-defendants, the jury was removed from the courtroom.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|134}} Speaking for more than an hour, Manson said, among other things, that "the music is telling the youth to rise up against the establishment." He said, "Why blame it on me? I didn't write the music." "To be honest with you," Manson also stated, "I don't recall ever saying 'Get a knife and a change of clothes and go do what Tex says.{{'"}}&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|388–392}}

As the body of the trial concluded and with the closing arguments impending, defense attorney Hughes disappeared during a weekend trip.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|393–398}} When Maxwell Keith was appointed to represent Van Houten in Hughes' absence, a delay of more than two weeks was required to permit Keith to familiarize himself with the voluminous trial transcripts.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|393–398}} No sooner had the trial resumed, just before Christmas, than disruptions of the prosecution's closing argument by the defendants led Older to ban the four defendants from the courtroom for the remainder of the [[bifurcation (law)|guilt phase]]. This may have occurred because the defendants were acting in collusion with each other and were simply putting on a performance, which Older said was becoming obvious.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|399–407}}

==== Conviction and penalty phase ====
On January 25, 1971, the jury returned guilty verdicts against the four defendants on each of the 27 separate counts against them.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|411–419}} Not far into the trial's [[bifurcation (law)|penalty phase]], the jurors saw, at last, the defense that Manson—in the prosecution's view—had planned to present.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|455}}  Atkins, Krenwinkel, and Van Houten testified the murders had been conceived as "copycat" versions of the Hinman murder, for which Atkins now took credit. The killings, they said, were intended to draw suspicion away from Bobby Beausoleil by resembling the crime for which he had been jailed. This plan had supposedly been the work of, and carried out under the guidance of, not Manson, but someone allegedly in love with Beausoleil—[[Linda Kasabian]].&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|424–433}} Among the narrative's weak points was the inability of Atkins to explain why, as she was maintaining, she had written "political piggy" at the Hinman house in the first place.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|424–433, 450–457}}

Midway through the penalty phase, Manson shaved his head and trimmed his beard to a fork; he told the press, "I am the Devil, and the Devil always has a bald head."&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|439}} In what the prosecution regarded as belated recognition on their part that imitation of Manson only proved his domination, the female defendants refrained from shaving their heads until the jurors retired to weigh the state's request for the death penalty.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|439, 455}}

The effort to exonerate Manson via the "copy cat" scenario failed. On March 29, 1971, the jury returned verdicts of death against all four defendants on all counts.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|450–457}} On April 19, 1971, Judge Older sentenced the four to death.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|458–459}}

== Aftermath ==
===1970s–1980s===
On the day the verdicts recommending the death penalty were returned, news came that the badly decomposed body of Ronald Hughes had been found wedged between two boulders in [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]].&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|457}} It was rumored, although never proven, that Hughes was murdered by the Family, possibly because he had stood up to Manson and refused to allow Van Houten to take the stand and absolve Manson of the crimes.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|387, 394, 481}} Though he might have perished in flooding,&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|393–394, 481}}&lt;ref&gt;Sanders 2002, 436–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Family member [[Sandra Good]] stated that Hughes was "the first of the retaliation murders".&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|481–482, 625}}

Watson returned to McKinney, Texas after the Tate–LaBianca murders. He was arrested in Texas on November 30, 1969, after local police were notified by California investigators that his fingerprints were found to match a print found on the front door of the Tate home. Watson fought extradition to California long enough that he was not included among the three defendants tried with Manson.&lt;ref&gt;Extradition of Charles 'Tex' Watson&lt;/ref&gt; The trial commenced in August 1971; by October, he, too, had been found guilty on seven counts of murder and one of conspiracy. Unlike the others, Watson presented a psychiatric defense; prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi made short work of Watson's insanity claims. Like his co-conspirators, Watson was sentenced to death.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|463–468}}

In February 1972, the death sentences of all five parties were automatically reduced to life in prison by ''[[People v. Anderson]]'', 493 P.2d 880, 6 Cal. 3d 628 ([[Supreme Court of California|Cal.]] 1972), in which the California Supreme Court abolished the [[Capital punishment in California|death penalty in that state]].&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|488–491}} After his return to prison, Manson's rhetoric and hippie speeches held little sway. Though he found temporary acceptance from the [[Aryan Brotherhood]], his role was submissive to a sexually aggressive member of the group at [[San Quentin State Prison|San Quentin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Edward|last=George|author2=Dary Matera|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YcDB9TDnPeQC&amp;pg=PT42|title=Taming the Beast: Charles Manson's Life Behind Bars|publisher=Macmillan|year=1999|pages=42–45|isbn=978-0-312-20970-4|access-date=November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the conclusion of Manson's Tate–LaBianca trial, a reporter for the ''Los Angeles Times'' tracked down Manson's mother, remarried and living in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. The former Kathleen Maddox claimed that, in childhood, her son had suffered no neglect; he had even been "pampered by all the women who surrounded him."&lt;ref name="mom"&gt;Smith, Dave.

On November 8, 1972, the body of 26-year-old Vietnam Marine combat veteran James L.T. Willett was found by a hiker near [[Guerneville, California]].&lt;ref name=SuspectInKilling /&gt; Months earlier, he had been forced to dig his own grave, and then was shot and poorly buried; his body was found with one hand protruding from the grave and the head and other hand missing, most likely because of scavenging animals. His [[station wagon]] was found outside a house in [[Stockton, California|Stockton]] where several Manson followers were living, including Priscilla Cooper, Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme, and Nancy Pitman. Police forced their way into the house and arrested several of the people there, along with Fromme, who had called the house after they had arrived. The body of James Willett's 19-year-old wife Lauren "Reni" Chavelle&lt;ref name=posed&gt;"Two men and three women charged with murder of 19-year-old girl",  Reuters News Service, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Olmstead Willett was found buried in the basement.&lt;ref name=SuspectInKilling&gt;[http://img521.imageshack.us/img521/9/suspectinkillingnov1419.jpg Manson Family Suspect in Killing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618170246/http://img521.imageshack.us/img521/9/suspectinkillingnov1419.jpg |date=June 18, 2012}}, ''The Times Standard'', November 14, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; She had been killed very recently by a gunshot to the head, in what the Family members initially claimed was an accident. It was later suggested that she was killed out of fear that she would reveal who killed her husband, as the discovery of his body had become prominent news. The Willetts' infant daughter was found alive in the house. Michael Monfort{{who|date=May 2016}} pleaded guilty to murdering Reni Willett, and Priscilla Cooper, James Craig, and Nancy Pitman pleaded guilty as accessories after the fact. Monfort and William Goucher{{who|date=May 2016}} later pleaded guilty to the murder of James Willett, and James Craig pleaded guilty as an accessory after the fact. The group had been living in the house with the Willetts while committing various robberies. Shortly after killing Willett, Monfort had used Willett's identification papers to pose as Willett after being arrested for an armed robbery of a liquor store. News reports suggested that James Willett was not involved in the robberies&lt;ref&gt;[http://img109.imageshack.us/img109/2748/exconsmanosngirlscharge.jpg "Ex-cons, Manson Girls Charged"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618170315/http://img109.imageshack.us/img109/2748/exconsmanosngirlscharge.jpg |date=June 18, 2012}}, ''The Billings Gazette'', November 15, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; and wanted to move away, but was killed out of fear that he would talk to police. After leaving the Marines following two tours in Vietnam, Willett had been an [[English as a second or foreign language|ESL]] teacher for immigrant children.

==== Shea murder ====
In a 1971 trial that took place after his Tate–LaBianca convictions, Manson was found guilty of the murders of Gary Hinman and [[Donald Shea|Donald "Shorty" Shea]] and was given a [[Life imprisonment|life sentence]]. Shea was a Spahn Ranch stuntman and horse wrangler who had been killed approximately ten days after an August 16, 1969, sheriff's raid on the ranch. Manson, who suspected that Shea helped set up the raid, had apparently believed Shea was trying to get Spahn to run the Family off the ranch. Manson may have considered it a "sin" that the white Shea had married a black woman; and there was the possibility that Shea knew about the Tate–LaBianca killings.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|99–113}}&lt;ref&gt;Sanders 2002, 271–2.&lt;/ref&gt; In separate trials, Family members Bruce Davis and Steve "Clem" Grogan were also found guilty of Shea's murder.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|99–113, 463–468}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020804023947/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/manson/mansonparole.html Transcript of Charles Manson's 1992 parole hearing] University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law. Retrieved May 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, authorities learned the precise location of the remains of Shorty Shea and, contrary to Family claims, that Shea had not been dismembered and buried in several places. Contacting the prosecutor in his case, Steve Grogan told him Shea's corpse had been buried in one piece; he drew a map that pinpointed the location of the body, which was recovered. Of those convicted of Manson-ordered murders, Grogan would become, in 1985, the first—and, {{as of|1994|lc=on}}, the only one—to be paroled.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|509}}

[[File:FolsomStatePrison.jpg|thumb|The [[Folsom State Prison]], one of the facilities where Manson was held]]

On September 5, 1975, the Family rocketed back to national attention when [[Lynette Fromme|Squeaky Fromme]] attempted to assassinate U.S. President [[Gerald Ford]].&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|502–511}} The attempt took place in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], to which she and Manson follower [[Sandra Good]] had moved to be near Manson while he was incarcerated at [[Folsom State Prison]]. A subsequent search of the apartment shared by Fromme, Good, and a Family recruit turned up evidence that, coupled with later actions on the part of Good, resulted in Good's conviction for conspiring to send threatening communications through the United States mail and transmitting death threats by way of interstate commerce. The threats involved corporate executives and U.S. government officials vis-à-vis supposed environmental dereliction on their part.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|502–511}} Fromme was sentenced to 15 years to life, becoming the first person sentenced under [[United States Code]] Title 18, chapter 84 (1965),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1751-|title=18 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;1751|publisher=.law.cornell.edu|date=June 28, 2010|access-date=November 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which made it a Federal crime to attempt to assassinate the President of the United States.

In December 1987, Fromme, serving a life sentence for the assassination attempt, escaped briefly from [[Federal Prison Camp, Alderson]], in [[West Virginia]]. She was trying to reach Manson, who she had heard had [[testicular cancer]]; she was apprehended within days.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|502–511}} She was released on parole from [[Federal Medical Center, Carswell]] on August 14, 2009.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Would-Be Assassin 'Squeaky' Fromme Released from Prison|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/MansonMurders/story?id=8327414&amp;page=1|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|date=August 14, 2009|access-date=August 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s–present===
In a 1994 conversation with Manson prosecutor [[Vincent Bugliosi]], [[Catherine Share]], a one-time Manson-follower, stated that her testimony in the penalty phase of Manson's trial had been a fabrication intended to save Manson from the [[gas chamber]] and that it had been given on Manson's explicit direction.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|502–511}} Share's testimony had introduced the copycat-motive story, which the testimony of the three female defendants echoed and according to which the Tate–LaBianca murders had been Linda Kasabian's idea.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|424–433}} In a 1997 segment of the [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]] television program ''[[Hard Copy]]'', Share implied that her testimony had been given under a Manson threat of physical harm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XR-EqsE8lHc Catherine Share with Vincent Bugliosi, ''Hard Copy'', 1997] youtube.com. Retrieved May 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1971, after Manson's trial and sentencing, Share had participated in a violent California retail store robbery, the object of which was the acquisition of weapons to help free Manson.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|463–468}}

In January 1996, a Manson website was established by latter-day Manson follower George Stimson, who was helped by [[Sandra Good]]. Good had been released from prison in 1985, after serving 10 years of her 15-year sentence for the death threats.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|502–511}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/1997/04/3182 "Manson's Family Affair Living in Cyberspace"]. ''Wired'', April 16, 1997. Retrieved May 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1998–1999 interview in ''Seconds'' magazine, [[Bobby Beausoleil]] rejected the view that Manson ordered him to kill Gary Hinman.&lt;ref name="seconds" /&gt; He stated that Manson did come to Hinman's house and slash Hinman with a sword, which he had previously denied in a 1981 interview with ''Oui'' magazine. Beausoleil stated that when he read about the Tate murders in the newspaper, "I wasn't even sure at that point—really, I had no idea who had done it until Manson's group were actually arrested for it. It had only crossed my mind and I had a premonition, perhaps. There was some little tickle in my mind that the killings might be connected with them&amp;nbsp;..." In the ''Oui'' magazine interview, he had stated, "When the Tate-LaBianca murders happened, I knew who had done it. I was fairly certain."

William Garretson, once the young caretaker at [[10050 Cielo Drive]], indicated in a program  (''The Last Days of Sharon Tate'') broadcast on July 25, 1999 on ''[[E!]]'', that he had, in fact, seen and heard a portion of the Tate murders from his location in the property's guest house. This corroborated the unofficial results of the [[polygraph]] examination that had been given to Garretson on August 10, 1969, and that had effectively eliminated him as a suspect. The LAPD officer who conducted the examination had concluded Garretson was "clean" on participation in the crimes but "muddy" as to his having heard anything.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{Rp|28–38}} Garretson did not explain why he had withheld his knowledge of the events.

It was announced in early 2008 that Susan Atkins was suffering from brain cancer.&lt;ref name=deniedrelease&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/07/15/release.denied/index.html "Ailing Manson follower denied release from prison"] ''[[CNN]]'', July 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; An application for [[compassionate release]], based on her health status, was denied in July 2008,&lt;ref name="deniedrelease" /&gt; and she was denied parole for the 18th and final time on September 2, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=8462901|title=Dying Manson Murderer Denied Release|first=Sarah|last=Netter|author2=Lindsay Goldwert|publisher=ABC News|date=September 2, 2009|access-date=September 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atkins died of natural causes 22 days later, on September 24, 2009, at the Central California Women's facility in [[Chowchilla, California|Chowchilla]].&lt;ref name=NYT_obit&gt;{{cite news|title=Susan Atkins, Manson Follower, Dies at 61|work=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/26/us/26atkins.html|date=September 26, 2009|last=Fox|first=Margalit|access-date=September 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Associated|last=Press|title=Manson follower Susan Atkins dies at 61|work=The Guardian|date=September 25, 2009|access-date=September 25, 2009|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/25/charles-manson-susan-atkins-dies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a January 2008 segment of the [[Discovery Channel]]'s ''[[Most Evil]],'' Barbara Hoyt said that the impression that she had accompanied Ruth Ann Moorehouse to Hawaii just to avoid testifying at Manson's trial was erroneous. Hoyt said she had cooperated with the Family because she was "trying to keep them from killing my family." She stated that, at the time of the trial, she was "constantly being threatened: 'Your family's gonna die. [The murders] could be repeated at your house.{{' "}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title = Charles Manson Murders |url = http://investigation.discovery.com/tv/most-evil/ep-guide/most-evil-ep-guide.html |series = Most Evil |serieslink = Most Evil |network = Discovery Channel |airdate = January 31, 2008 |season = 3 |number = 1 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080222090233/http://investigation.discovery.com/tv/most-evil/ep-guide/most-evil-ep-guide.html |archivedate = February 22, 2008 |df = mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 15, 2008, the [[Associated Press]] reported that [[forensic science|forensic investigators]] had conducted a search for human remains at [[Barker Ranch]] the previous month. Following up on longstanding rumors that the Family had killed hitchhikers and runaways who had come into its orbit during its time at Barker, the investigators identified "two likely clandestine grave sites&amp;nbsp;... and one additional site that merits further investigation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/03/15/america/CSI-Manson-Ranch.php "AP Exclusive: On Manson's trail, forensic testing suggests possible new grave sites".] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319084417/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/03/15/america/CSI-Manson-Ranch.php |date=March 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though they recommended digging, [[CNN]] reported on March 28 that the [[Inyo County, California|Inyo County]] sheriff, who questioned the methods they employed with search dogs, had ordered additional tests before any excavation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/03/28/manson.ranch/index.html ''More tests at Manson ranch for buried bodies''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329123425/http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/03/28/manson.ranch/index.html |date=March 29, 2008}}.

As the 40th anniversary of the Tate–LaBianca murders approached, in July 2009, [[Los Angeles (magazine)|''Los Angeles'' magazine]] published an "oral history" in which former Family members, law enforcement officers, and others involved with Manson, the arrests, and the trials offered their recollections of — and observations on — the events that made Manson notorious. In the article, Juan Flynn, a Spahn Ranch worker who had become associated with Manson and the Family, said, "Charles Manson got away with everything. People will say, 'He's in jail.'

'''Net Authority''' was a [[parody]] web site created in 2001 by Rudis Muiznieks&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=netcraft.com|url=http://toolbar.netcraft.com/site_report?url=http://www.netauthority.org
|title=Netcraft site report for www.netauthority.org|date=January 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; that pretended to be a [[Christian]] [[Internet censorship]] site for recording and tracking other web sites containing offensive content. The site shut down shortly afterwards, when Muiznieks found that it had gotten completely out of hand. After receiving a legal threat, he closed it down on the recommendation of his employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://codeword.xyz/2017/03/15/that-time-i-trolled-the-entire-internet/ | title=That Time I Trolled the Entire Internet | author=Rudis Muiznieks | date=2017-03-15 | publisher=Rudis Muiznieks (codeword.xyz)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He reopened it a few years later in a watered-down form. It finally ceased operations in February 2008, allegedly because "fundamentalist religion [was] doing such a fantastic job of parodying itself" that Net Authority "could only pale in comparison to the real thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Rudis|last=Muiznieks|title=Net Authority|date=February 3, 2008|url=http://www.netauthority.org/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223132339/http://www.netauthority.org/index.html|archivedate=February 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Net Authority purported to encourage an "Internet Acceptable Use Policy" to prohibit sites containing [[pornographic]], [[hatred|hateful]] or [[blasphemous]] material, and sites containing "[[bestiality]], including [[Miscegenation|interracial]] relationships". Users could easily submit websites themselves, which would then be added to the database.

{{Kannada poets in Hoysala Empire}}
'''Palkuriki Somanatha''' was one of the most noted [[Telugu language]] writers of the 12th or 13th century. He was also an accomplished writer in the [[Kannada language|Kannada]] and [[Sanskrit]] languages and penned several classics in those languages.&lt;ref name="multi"/&gt; He was a [[Lingayatism|Shaiva]] (devotee of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] god [[Shiva]]) by faith and a follower of the 12th century social reformer [[Basava]] and his writings were primarily intended to propagate this faith.&lt;ref name="multi"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1992), p. 4133&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a well acclaimed [[Shaivism|Shaiva poet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-03-13/hyderabad/28685273_1_telangana-region-statues-t-region | work=The Times Of India | title=T votaries cry foul over 'neglect' of T contribution to Telugu pride | date=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Indication that he was not a Shaiva by birth comes from the fact that he mentions the names of his parents in his very first work, ''[[Basava Purana]]'', violating a general practice of Shaiva writers who do not mention their real parents but rather consider the god Shiva as the father and his consort [[Parvati]] as the mother.&lt;ref name="multi"/&gt; However, the scholar Bandaru Tammayya has argued that he was born a ''Jangama'' (devotee of the god Shiva).&lt;ref name="tamma"&gt;Bandaru Tammayya in Sahitya Akademi (1992), p. 4133&lt;/ref&gt; The scholar Seshayya places him in the late 13th to early 14th century and proposes that the writer lived during the reign of [[Kakatiya]] king Prataparudra II, whereas the Kannada scholar R. Narasimhacharya dates his writings to the 12th century and claims Somanatha was patronised by Kakatiya king Prataparudra I (1140&amp;ndash;1196).&lt;ref name="life"&gt;Seshayya in Sahitya Akademi (1992), p. 4133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="date"&gt;Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 20, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; His place of birth is uncertain because there is a village by the name Palkuriki in the Warangal district of the [[Telangana]] state as well as in the Kannada speaking region ([[Karnataka]]).&lt;ref name="multi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="region"&gt;Shastri (1955), p. 362&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
;Telugu language
Important among his Telugu language writings are the ''[[Basava Purana]]'', ''Panditaradhya charitra'', ''Malamadevipuranamu'' and ''Somanatha Stava''&amp;ndash;in ''dwipada'' metre ("couplets"); ''Anubhavasara'', ''Chennamallu Sisamalu'', ''Vrishadhipa Shataka'' and ''Cheturvedasara''&amp;ndash;in verses; ''Basavodharana'' in verses and ''ragale'' metre (rhymed couplets in blank verse); and the ''Basavaragada''.&lt;ref name="ragada"&gt;Shatiya Akademi (1992), p. 4133&lt;/ref&gt;

;Kannada language
His contributions to [[Kannada literature]] are, the ''Basavaragada'', ''Basavadhyaragada'', ''Sadgururagada'', ''Silasampadane'', ''Sahasragananama'', ''Pancharantna''. Several ''[[Vachana]]'' and ''ragale'' poems are also his contributions to Kannada literature. Somanatha's Telugu ''Basavapurana'' was the inspiration for [[Vijayanagara empire|Vijayanagara]] poet Bhimkavi (c.&amp;nbsp;1369) who wrote a Kannada book by the same name. Somanatha was the protagonist of a 16th-century Kannada ''[[purana]]'' ("epic religious text") written by the Vijayanagara poet Tontadarya.&lt;ref name="ragele"&gt;Shastri (1955), p. 362; Shatiya Akademi (1992), p. 4133&lt;/ref&gt;

;Sanskrit language
Important among his Sanskrit language writings are the ''Somanathabhashya'', ''Rudrabhashya'', ''Vrishabhastaka'', ''Basavodharana'', ''Basavashtaka'', ''Basava panchaka'', ''Ashtottara satanama gadya'', ''Panchaprakara gadya'' and ''Asharanka gadya''.&lt;ref name="ragada"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2459">'''The Princeton Principles''' is a policy paper made up of ''Ten Principles on Marriage and the Public Good.'' It was released in May 2006 as the culmination of discussions among scholars that began at a 2004 meeting in Princeton, [[New Jersey]] in the United States.  The finished policy paper and the initial meeting were sponsored by the [[Witherspoon Institute]]. McCormick Professor of Jurisprudence [[Robert P. George]] of [[Princeton University]] gave a copy of the Princeton Principles to [[George W. Bush]] at a meeting.  The chair of the drafting committee, [[Political Science]] Professor [[James R. Stoner, Jr.]] of [[Louisiana State University]] remarked, "The better arguments are on our side but they haven't been made, or at least made with rigor or given a hearing in the media." &lt;ref&gt;EWTN [http://www.ewtn.com/vnews/getstory.asp?number=68452 "DEBATING MARRIAGE: 10 PRINCIPLES"], June 13, 2006 "EWTN"&lt;/ref&gt;  Senator [[Sam Brownback]] made reference to the Princeton Principles on the floor of the Senate in his remarks on the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]] of 2006, which failed to pass.

==The Ten Principles==

The 10 principles that summarize the public value of marriage and why society should endorse and support the institution:

*Marriage is a personal union, intended for the whole of life, of husband and wife.
*Marriage is a profound human good, elevating and perfecting our social and sexual nature.
*Ordinarily, both men and women who marry are better off as a result.
*Marriage protects and promotes the wellbeing of children.
*Marriage sustains civil society and promotes the common good.
*Marriage is a wealth-creating institution, increasing human and social capital.
*When marriage weakens, the equality gap widens, as children suffer from the disadvantages of growing up in homes without committed mothers and fathers.
*A functioning marriage culture serves to protect political liberty and foster limited government.
*The laws that govern marriage matter significantly.
*"Civil marriage" and "religious marriage" cannot be rigidly or completely divorced from one another.

According to 2010 estimates, about 90 percent of the population of the [[Central African Republic]] are [[Christian]]. [[Islam]] is practiced by 9 percent of the population.&lt;ref name="Pew Christians"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2011/12/19/table-christian-population-as-percentages-of-total-population-by-country/|title=Table: Christian Population as Percentages of Total Population by Country|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pew Muslims"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/table-muslim-population-by-country/|title=Table: Muslim Poplation by Country|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of [[Muslim]]s are [[Maliki|Malikite]] [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]]. It is believed that many of these followers incorporate traditional indigenous elements into their faith practices.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2010/148671.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2010 - Central African Republic]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious demography==
[[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] missions are scattered throughout the territory. [[Islam]] is practised primarily in the north. About 51 percent of the population are Protestant; another 29 percent are [[Roman Catholic]]. 10 percent are Muslim. Missionary groups within the country include [[Lutheran]]s, [[Baptists]], [[Grace Brethren]], and [[Jehovah’s Witnesses]].

==Religious freedom==
The [[Constitution of the Central African Republic|constitution]] (suspended since 2003) provides for freedom of religion while prohibiting certain forms of religious [[fundamentalism]]. This prohibition is generally considered to be directed toward Christian and Muslim fundamentalists.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Christian holidays are celebrated as national holidays. All religious groups must be registered through the Ministry of Interior. The [[Unification Church]] has been banned since the mid-1980s. The practice of witchcraft is considered a criminal offense; however, prosecution is generally made only in conjunction with other criminal activity, such as murder.

[[File:Missale Romanum.jpg|310px|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt;2002 edition of the Missale Romanum&lt;/center&gt;]]
The '''Roman Missal''' ({{lang-la|Missale Romanum}}) is the [[Liturgical books of the Roman Rite|liturgical book]] that contains the texts and [[rubric]]s for the celebration of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in the [[Roman Rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]].

==History==

===Situation before the Council of Trent===
Before the high [[Middle Ages]], several books were used at Mass: a [[Sacramentary]] with the [[prayer]]s, one or more books for the [[Bible|Scriptural]] readings, and one or more books for the [[antiphon]]s and other chants. Gradually, manuscripts came into being that incorporated parts of more than one of these books, leading finally to versions that were complete in themselves. Such a book was referred to as a ''Missale Plenum'' ({{lang-en|"Full Missal"}}). In 1223 Saint [[Francis of Assisi]] instructed his friars to adopt the form that was in use at the Papal Court (''Rule'', chapter 3). They adapted this missal further to the needs of their largely itinerant apostolate. [[Pope Gregory IX]] considered, but did not put into effect, the idea of extending this missal, as revised by the [[Franciscan]]s, to the whole Western Church; and in 1277 [[Pope Nicholas III]] ordered it to be accepted in all churches in the city of Rome. Its use spread throughout Europe, especially after the invention of the [[Gutenberg press|printing press]]; but the editors introduced variations of their own choosing, some of them substantial. Printing also favoured the spread of other liturgical texts of less certain orthodoxy. The [[Council of Trent]] recognized that an end must be put to the resulting confusion.

The first printed ''Missale Romanum'' (Roman Missal), containing the ''Ordo Missalis secundum consuetudinem Curiae Romanae'' (Order of the Missal in accordance with the custom of the [[Roman Curia]]), was produced in [[Milan]] in 1474.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/missaleromanumm01churgoog#page/n229/mode/2up ''Missale Romanum. Mediolani. 1474'' Robert Lippe (editor), London 1899, vol. 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Almost a whole century passed before the appearance of an edition officially published by order of the [[Holy See]]. During that interval, the 1474 Milanese edition was followed by at least 14 other editions: 10 printed in [[Venice]], 3 in [[Paris]], 1 in [[Lyon]].&lt;ref&gt;Manlio Sodi and Achille Maria Triacca, ''Missale Romanum: Editio Princeps (1570)'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1998), p. XV&lt;/ref&gt; For lack of a controlling authority, these editions differ, sometimes seriously.&lt;ref name=Celinsk/&gt;

Annotations in the hand of [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] [[Gugliemo Sirleto]] in a copy of the 1494 Venetian edition&lt;ref&gt;''Missale secundum morem Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae'' (Missal in line with the use of the Holy Roman Church)&lt;/ref&gt; show that it was used for drawing up the 1570 official edition of [[Pope Pius V]]. In substance, this 1494 text is identical with that of the 1474 Milanese edition.&lt;ref name=Celinsk&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/31464425/Per_una_rilettura_della_storia_della_formazione_e_dello_sviluppo_del_Messale_Romano._Il_caso_del_Messale_di_Clemente_V Łukasz Celińsk, "Per una rilettura della storia della formazione e dello sviluppo del Messale Romano. Il caso del Messale di Clemente V." in ''Ecclesia Orans'' 33 (2016) 383-404 (p. 15 of the extract)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===From the Council of Trent to the Second Vatican Council===
[[File:Missale Romanum Pustet.jpg|thumb|250px|"Missale Romanum": a 1911 printing of the 1884 typical edition]]
Implementing the decision of the Council of Trent, [[Pope Pius V]] promulgated, in the Apostolic Constitution ''[[Quo primum]]'' of 14 July 1570, an edition of the Roman Missal that was to be in obligatory use throughout the [[Latin Church]] except where there was a traditional liturgical rite that could be proved to be of at least two centuries’ antiquity.

Some corrections to Pope Pius V's text proved necessary, and [[Pope Clement VIII]] replaced it with a new typical edition of the Roman Missal on 7 July 1604. (In this context, the word "typical" means that the text is the one to which all other printings must conform.) A further revised typical edition was promulgated by [[Pope Urban VIII]] on 2 September 1634.

Beginning in the late seventeenth century, France and neighbouring areas saw a flurry of independent missals published by bishops influenced by [[Jansenism]] and [[Gallicanism]]. This ended when Bishop [[Pierre-Louis Parisis]] of Langres and [[Abbot Guéranger]] initiated in the nineteenth century a campaign to return to the Roman Missal. [[Pope Leo XIII]] then took the opportunity to issue in 1884 a new typical edition that took account of all the changes introduced since the time of Pope Urban VIII. [[Pope Pius X]] also undertook a revision of the Roman Missal, which was published and declared typical by his successor [[Pope Benedict XV]] on 25 July 1920.

[[File:Nouveau Paroissien Romain (1905).jpg|thumb|310px|A French prayerbook of 1905 containing extracts from the Roman Missal and the Roman Breviary of the time with French translations]]
Though Pope Pius X's revision made few corrections, omissions, and additions to the text of the prayers in the Roman Missal, there were major changes in the rubrics, changes which were not incorporated in the section entitled "''Rubricae generales''", but were instead printed as an additional section under the heading "''Additiones et variationes in rubricis Missalis.''"

In contrast, the revision by [[Pope Pius XII]], though limited to the liturgy of only five days of the Church's year, was much bolder, requiring changes even to [[canon law]], which until then had prescribed that, with the exception of Midnight Mass for Christmas, Mass should not begin more than one hour before dawn or later than one hour after midday. In the part of the Missal thus thoroughly revised, he anticipated some of the changes affecting all days of the year after the [[Second Vatican Council]]. These novelties included the first official introduction of the [[vernacular]] language into the liturgy for renewal of baptismal promises within the [[Easter Vigil]] celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christorchaos.com/PresagingaRevolution.html |title= Presaging a Revolution| author=Thomas A.

Pope Pius XII issued no new typical edition of the Roman Missal, but authorized printers to replace the earlier texts for [[Palm Sunday]], [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]], [[Good Friday]], and the [[Easter Vigil]] with those that he began to introduce in 1951 and that he made universally obligatory in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Decree ''[http://www.strobertbellarmine.net/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1086#p1086 Maxima redemptionis nostrae mysteria] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312043149/http://www.strobertbellarmine.net/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1086#p1086 |date=12 March 2011 }}'' (''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]'' 47 (1955) 838-847&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope also removed from the Vigil of Pentecost the series of six Old Testament readings, with their accompanying Tracts and Collects, but these continued to be printed until 1962.

Acceding to the wishes of many of the bishops, Pope Pius XII judged it expedient also to reduce the rubrics of the missal to a simpler form, a simplification enacted by a decree of the Sacred Congregation of Rites of 23 March 1955. The changes this made in the General Roman Calendar are indicated in [[General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII]].

In the following year, 1956, while preparatory studies were being conducted for a general liturgical reform, Pope Pius XII surveyed the opinions of the bishops on the liturgical improvement of the Roman breviary. After duly weighing the answers of the bishops, he judged that it was time to attack the problem of a general and systematic revision of the rubrics of the breviary and missal. This question he referred to the special committee of experts appointed to study the general liturgical reform.

His successor, [[Pope John XXIII]], issued a new typical edition of the Roman Missal in [[1962 Roman Missal|1962]]. This incorporated the revised [[Code of Rubrics]] which Pope Pius XII's commission had prepared, and which Pope John XXIII had made obligatory with effect from 1 January 1961. In the Missal, this Code of Rubrics replaced two of the documents in the 1920 edition; and the Pope's motu proprio ''Rubricarum instructum'' took the place of the superseded [[Apostolic constitution]] ''[[Reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X|Divino afflatu]]'' of Pope Pius X.

Other notable revisions were the omission of the adjective "''perfidis''" in the [[Good Friday Prayer for the Jews]] and the insertion of the name of [[Saint Joseph]] into the Canon (or Eucharistic Prayer) of the Mass.

===Revision of the Missal following the Second Vatican Council===
[[File:Roma Meslibro por dimanĉoj kaj festoj (1995) 001.jpg|thumb|Roman Missal in Esperanto (1995)]]
In 1965 and 1967 some changes were officially introduced into the Mass of the Roman Rite in the wake of ''[[Sacrosanctum Concilium]]'', but no new edition of the Roman Missal had been produced to incorporate them. They were reflected in the provisional vernacular translations produced in various countries when the language of the people began to be used in addition to Latin. References sometimes met in an English-language context to "the 1965 Missal" concern these temporary vernacular productions, not the Roman Missal itself. Even countries that had the same language used different translations and varied in the amount of vernacular admitted.

A new edition of the Roman Missal was promulgated by [[Pope Paul VI]] with the [[apostolic constitution]] ''[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-vi_apc_19690403_missale-romanum_en.html Missale Romanum]'' of 3 April 1969. The full text of the revised Missal was not published until the following year, and full vernacular translations appeared some years later, but parts of the Missal in Latin were already available since 1964 in non definitive form and provisional translations appeared without delay.

In his apostolic constitution, Pope Paul made particular mention of the following significant changes that he had made in the Roman Missal:
* To the single Canon of the previous edition (which, with minor alterations, was preserved as the "First Eucharistic Prayer or Roman Canon") he added three alternative Eucharistic Prayers, increasing also the number of prefaces.
* The rites of the [[Order of Mass]] (in Latin, ''Ordo Missae'') &amp;ndash; that is, the largely unvarying part of the liturgy &amp;ndash; were "simplified, while due care is taken to preserve their substance." "Elements which, with the passage of time, came to be duplicated, or were added with but little advantage" were eliminated, especially in the rites for the presentation of the bread and wine, the breaking of the bread, and communion.
* "'Other elements which have suffered injury through accidents of history are now to be restored to the earlier norm of the Holy Fathers' ([http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html ''Sacrosanctum Concilium''], art. 50), for example, the homily (see ''Sacrosanctum Concilium'', art. 52), the 'common prayer' or 'prayer of the faithful' (see ''Sacrosanctum Concilium'', art. 53)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-vi_apc_19690403_missale-romanum_en.html ''Missale Romanum''.] The internal references to [http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html ''Sacrosanctum Concilium''] are to the Constitution of the Second Vatican Council on the Sacred Liturgy.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul VI also added the option of "the penitential rite or act of reconciliation with God and the brothers, at the beginning of the Mass," though this was neither an ancient part of the Introductory Rite nor mentioned in ''Sacrosanctum Concilium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04222a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Confiteor|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* He greatly increased the proportion of the Bible read at Mass. Even before Pius XII reduced the proportion further, only 1% of the Old Testament and 16.5% of the New Testament was read at Mass. In Pope Paul's revision, 13.5% of the Old Testament and 71.5% of the New Testament are read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Felix Just, S.J. |url=http://catholic-resources.org/Lectionary/Statistics.htm |title=Lectionary Statistics |publisher=Catholic-resources.org |date=2 January 2009 |accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was able to do this by having more readings at Mass and introducing a three-year cycle of readings on Sundays and a two-year cycle on weekdays.

In addition to these changes, the Pope noted that his revision considerably modified other sections of the Missal, such as the Proper of Seasons, the Proper of Saints, the [[common (liturgy)|Common of Saints]], the Ritual Masses, and the Votive Masses, adding: "In all of these changes, particular care has been taken with the prayers: not only has their number been increased, so that the new texts might better correspond to new needs, but also their text has been restored on the testimony of the most ancient evidences."

===More recent changes===
In 1970, the first Latin Typical Edition of this new Pauline Missal was promulgated.  A year later, in 1971, an Amended Typical Edition was promulgated.  Then, a new typical edition, the second with minor changes followed in 1975. In 2000, [[Pope John Paul II]] approved yet another typical edition, which appeared in 2002, with the indication "Editio Typica Tertia" (Third Typical Edition). This edition added feasts, especially of recently canonized saints, it added more prefaces of the Eucharistic Prayers, it provided additional Masses and prayers for various needs, and it revised and amplified the General Instruction of the Roman Missal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://old.usccb.org/romanmissal/faqs2.shtml|publisher=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|accessdate=12 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220143949/http://old.usccb.org/romanmissal/faqs2.shtml|archive-date=20 December 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a reprint of that edition "Editio Typica Tertia Emendata" (Amended Third Typical Edition), was issued under [[Pope Benedict XVI]], which corrected misprints and some other mistakes (such as the insertion at the beginning of the [[Apostles' Creed]] of "unum", as in the [[Nicene Creed]]). A supplement gives celebrations, such as that of Saint [[Pio of Pietrelcina]], added to the [[General Roman Calendar]] after the initial printing of the 2002 typical edition.

Three alterations required personal approval by Pope Benedict XVI:
* A change in the order in which a bishop celebrating Mass outside his own diocese mentions the local bishop and himself
* Omission from the Latin Missal of the Eucharistic Prayers for Masses with Children (which, for now, may continue to be included in vernacular Missals)
* The addition of three alternatives to the standard dismissal at the end of Mass, ''Ite, missa est'' (Go forth, the Mass is ended):
** ''Ite ad Evangelium Domini annuntiandum'' (Go and announce the Gospel of the Lord)
** ''Ite in pace, glorificando vita vestra Dominum'' (Go in peace, glorifying the Lord by your life)
** ''Ite in pace'' (Go in peace)&lt;ref&gt;A full account of the corrections, additions and emendations is given on pages 367-387 of the July–August 2008 issue of ''Notitiae'', the bulletin of the [[Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments]]. Some much less detailed information may also be found in an [https://archive.is/20120721063040/http://www.30giorni.it/us/articolo.asp?id=19635 interview] given by Cardinal [[Francis Arinze]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continued use of earlier editions===
[[Image:1962 Missale Romanum.jpg|thumb|150px|The 1962 edition of the Roman Missal.]]
In his [[motu proprio]] ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]'' of 7 July 2007, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] stated that the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal was never juridically abrogated and that it may be freely used by any priest of the [[Latin Rite]] when celebrating Mass "without a congregation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/motu_proprio/documents/hf_ben-xvi_motu-proprio_20070707_summorum-pontificum.html ''Summorum Pontificum'', art. 2]&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the 1962 edition at Mass with a congregation is allowed, with the permission of the priest in charge of a church, for stable groups attached to this earlier form of the [[Roman Rite]], provided that the priest using it is "qualified to do so and not juridically impeded" (as for instance by suspension). Accordingly, many dioceses schedule regular Masses celebrated using the 1962 edition, which is also used habitually by priests of [[traditionalist Catholic|traditionalist]] fraternities in full communion with the Holy See such as the [[Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter]], the [[Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest]], the [[Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney]], the [[Canons Regular of Saint John Cantius]] and the Canons Regular of the Mother of God &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lagrasse.org|title=Accueil - Abbaye|website=Abbaye|language=fr-FR|access-date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Lagrasse]], France.

Of groups in dispute with the Holy See, the [[Society of St. Pius X]] uses the 1962 Missal, and smaller groups such as the [[Society of St. Pius V]] and the [[Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen]] use earlier editions.

For information on the calendars included in pre-1970 editions (a small part of the full Missal), see [[General Roman Calendar of 1960]], [[General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII]], [[General Roman Calendar of 1954]], and [[Tridentine Calendar]].

==Official English translations==
The [[International Commission on English in the Liturgy]] (ICEL) quickly prepared an English translation of the 1970 Roman Missal, which was approved by the individual English-speaking [[episcopal conference]]s and, after being reviewed by the [[Holy See]], was put into effect, beginning with the United States in 1973.

The authority for the [[episcopal conference]]s, with the consent of the Holy See, to decide on such translations was granted by the Second Vatican Council.&lt;ref&gt;"It is for the competent territorial ecclesiastical authority mentioned in Art. 22, 2, to decide whether, and to what extent, the vernacular language is to be used; their decrees are to be approved, that is, confirmed, by the Apostolic See. And, whenever it seems to be called for, this authority is to consult with bishops of neighbouring regions which have the same language. Translations from the Latin text into the mother tongue intended for use in the liturgy must be approved by the competent territorial ecclesiastical authority mentioned above" ([http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19631204_sacrosanctum-concilium_en.html ''Sacrosanctum Concilium'', Second Vatican Council, Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy, art. 36, 3-4).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P1K.HTM |title=Code of Canon Law, canon 455 |publisher=Intratext.com |date=4 May 2007 |accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICEL prepared a greatly altered English translation, and presented it for the consent of the Holy See in 1998. The Holy See withheld its consent and informed ICEL that the Latin text of the Missal, which must be the basis of translations into other languages, was being revised, making irrelevant a translation based on what would no longer be the official text of the Roman Missal.
 
On 28 March 2001, the Holy See issued the Instruction ''[[Liturgiam Authenticam]]'', which included the requirement that, in translations of the liturgical texts from the official Latin originals, "the original text, insofar as possible, must be translated integrally and in the most exact manner, without omissions or additions in terms of their content, and without paraphrases or glosses. Any adaptation to the characteristics or the nature of the various vernacular languages is to be sober and discreet."  This was a departure from the principle of [[dynamic equivalence]] promoted in [[ICEL]] translations after the Second Vatican Council.

In the following year, the third typical edition of the revised Roman Missal in Latin, which had already been promulgated in 2000, was released. These two texts made clear the need for a new official English translation of the Roman Missal, particularly because the previous one was at some points an adaptation rather than strictly a translation. An example is the rendering of the response "''Et cum spiritu tuo''" (literally, "And with your spirit") as "And also with you." Accordingly, the International Commission for English in the Liturgy prepared, less hurriedly than the first time, a new English translation of the Roman Missal, the completed form of which received the approval of the Holy See in April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icelweb.org/news.htm |title=News |publisher=Icelweb.org |date= |accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 July 2001, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments established an international committee of English-speaking bishops, called the Vox Clara Committee, "to advise that Dicastery in its responsibilities related to the translation of liturgical texts in the English language and to strengthen effective cooperation with the Conferences of Bishops".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20021119_press-release-vox-clara_en.html Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, Press Release, 19 November 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; On the occasion of the meeting of the committee in Rome in April 2002, Pope John Paul II sent them a message emphasizing that "fidelity to the rites and texts of the Liturgy is of paramount importance for the Church and Christian life" and charging the committee to ensure that "the texts of the Roman Rite are accurately translated in accordance with the norms of the Instruction ''Liturgiam authenticam''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adoremus.org/0502VoxClara.html | author=Helen Hull Hitchcock |title=''Vox Clara'' committee to assure fidelity, accuracy |publisher=Adoremusweb.org |accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Liturgiam authenticam'' also took from the Bishops' conferences the power to make its own treanslations and instituted a papal commission, Vox Clara, to revise the Bishops' work. In 2008 it made an estimated 10,000 changes to the ICEL's proposed text. By 2017 Pope Francis had formed a commission to review and evaluate ''Liturgiam authenticam''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/revisiting-liturgiam-authenticam-part-i-vox-clara|title=Revisiting Liturgiam Authenticam, Part I: Vox Clara {{!}} Commonweal Magazine|website=www.commonwealmagazine.org|language=en|access-date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/revisiting-liturgiam-authenticam-update|title=Revisiting ‘Liturgiam Authenticam’: An Update {{!}} Commonweal Magazine|website=www.commonwealmagazine.org|language=en|access-date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of making a new translation of the Roman Missal was completed in time to enable the national episcopal conference in most English-speaking countries to put it into use from the first Sunday of Advent (27 November) 2011.

As well as translating "Et cum spiritu tuo" as "And with your spirit", which some scholars suggest refers to the gift of the Holy Spirit the priest received at ordination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://old.usccb.org/romanmissal/translating_notes.shtml | title= Frequently Asked Questions | work= Notes on the New Translation of the Missale Romanum, editio typica tertia | publisher= [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] | accessdate= 27 November 2011 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111126075124/http://old.usccb.org/romanmissal/translating_notes.shtml | archive-date= 26 November 2011 | dead-url= yes | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed]] "[[consubstantial]] with the Father" was used as a translation of "consubstantialem Patri" (in [[Greek language|Greek]] "[[ὁμοούσιον]] τῷ Πατρί"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://old.usccb.org/romanmissal/consubstantial.shtml | title= Frequently Asked Questions | work= In the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed | publisher= [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] | accessdate= 27 November 2011 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111124041129/http://old.usccb.org/romanmissal/consubstantial.shtml | archive-date= 24 November 2011 | dead-url= yes | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of "of one Being with the Father" (or, in the United States only, "one in Being with the Father"), and the [[Latin language|Latin]] phrase ''qui pro vobis et pro multis effundetur in remissionem peccatorum'', formerly translated as "It will be shed for you and ''for all'' so that sins may be forgiven," was translated literally as "which will be poured out for you and ''for many'' for the forgiveness of sins" (see [[Pro multis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://old.usccb.org/romanmissal/translating_sixquestions.shtml | title=Frequently Asked Questions | work=Six Questions on the Translation of Pro Multis as “For Many” | publisher=[[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] | accessdate=27 November 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206102820/http://old.usccb.org/romanmissal/translating_sixquestions.shtml | archive-date=6 December 2011 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Benedict XVI]] remarked: "Many will find it hard to adjust to unfamiliar texts after nearly forty years of continuous use of the previous translation. The change will need to be introduced with due sensitivity, and the opportunity for [[catechesis]] that it presents will need to be firmly grasped. I pray that in this way any risk of confusion or bewilderment will be averted, and the change will serve instead as a springboard for a renewal and a deepening of Eucharistic devotion all over the English-speaking world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2010/april/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20100428_vox-clara-committee_en.html |title=To Members and Consultors of the Vox Clara Committee, 28 April 2010 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=28 April 2010 |accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan to introduce the new English translation of the missal was not without critics. Over 22,000 electronic signatures, some of them anonymous, were collected on a web petition to ask the Bishops, Cardinals and the Pope to reconsider the new translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whatifwejustsaidwait.org/signatures.aspx |title=What If We Just Said Wait? |publisher=WhatIfWeJustSaidWait.org |date= |accessdate=27 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120190208/http://www.whatifwejustsaidwait.org/signatures.aspx |archive-date=20 November 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time there was open dissent from one parish in Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stleoparish.org/pdf/Archbishop%20Letter%20042011.pdf |title=St. Leo Parish Council |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=27 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812164734/http://www.stleoparish.org/pdf/Archbishop%20Letter%20042011.pdf |archive-date=12 August 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet''' is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[Church (building)|church]] in the centre of Paris, France, located in the [[5th arrondissement, Paris|5th arrondissement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Structurae|id=s0021865|title=Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1977, after expelling the parish priest and his assistants the church has been used by [[Traditionalist Catholic|traditionalist]] [[Society of St. Pius X]] and remains in the Society's hands.

==History until 1977==
[[File:Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet Nave, Paris, France - Diliff.jpg|thumb|left|The nave]]
{{Expand section|date=March 2009}}

The church was first built in the 13th century and was reconstructed between 1656 and 1763.

In 1612, Adrien Bourdoise founded a seminary at Saint-Nicolas.

In the late 17th century noted [[harpsichord]]ist [[Jean-Nicolas Geoffroy]] (1633–1694) served as titular organist of the church.

In the 19th century the adjacent Mutualité site was occupied by a seminary. There, [[Ernest Renan]] studied under the direction of the [[Abbé Dupanloup]], who attained celebrity in 1838 when he reconciled the notoriously amoral diplomat [[Talleyrand]], who had received the minor orders at Saint-Nicholas, to the church on his death-bed. (Dupanloup subsequently became [[Bishop of Orléans]] and a member of the ''[[Académie française]]'').

Since 1905, the city of Paris, following the [[1905 French law on the separation of Church and State|law on the separation of Church and State]], claims ownership of the church but grants the Roman Catholic Church a free usage right.

==1977 occupation and consequences==
{{confusing|section|date=August 2017}}
In 1977, eleven years before the [[Ecône consecrations]], members of the Society of St. Pius X led by [[François Ducaud-Bourget]] expelled the parish priest and his assistants and occupied the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sspx.org/en/25-years-of-the-sspx-fr-angles-talk-part-2 |title=25 years of the SSPX: part 2 |website=Society of Saint Pius X |access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly afterwards, the city of Paris gave an eviction order. In 1978, the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] confirmed that the occupation was illegal but the order of eviction was never implemented.&lt;ref name="v1"&gt;[http://www.v1.paris.fr/BMO/delib/CMDELIB20020624/CMDELIB200206242002_V._83.htm 2002 V. 83 - Vœu relatif à l'occupation de l'église Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311042006/http://www.v1.paris.fr/BMO/delib/CMDELIB20020624/CMDELIB200206242002_V._83.htm |date=2007-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 February 1987, the ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]]'' ruled that the disturbance to [[public order]] resulting from an expulsion would be higher than that resulting from the illegal occupation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.v1.paris.fr/BMO/debat/cmdebat20020624/CMDEBAT20020624-183.htm 183 - Vœu présenté par M.

In 1993, the SSPX members, led by [[Philippe Laguérie]], unsuccessfully attempted to occupy another church in Paris, [[St-Germain l'Auxerrois]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120207021112/http://v.i.v.free.fr/msd/nv-lefebvre-09-09-2004.html Les Lebevristes se déchirent], ''[[La Croix]]'', 9 September 2004. (Archived: 7 February 2012) {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 June 2002, the municipal council of Paris passed a resolution that the Society of St Pius X should be expelled from the church,&lt;ref name="v1"/&gt; against the wishes of the [[French Socialist Party|socialist]] Mayor [[Bertrand Delanoë]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110927053839/http://lesverts.fr/article.php3?id_article=1077 Saint Nicolas du Chardonnet: Un procès à la hauteur de nos espérances], ''[[The Greens (France)|Les Verts]]''. (Archived: 27 September 2011) {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; who considered it an internal matter of the Catholic Church, remarking that the [[Archbishop of Paris]] had not requested that the Society be expelled.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Current situation==
It is now the Society's first church in the city of Paris itself, the second being [[Bazar de la Charité#Chapel of Our Lady of Consolation|Notre-Dame-de-Consolation Chapel]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://laportelatine.org/district/prieure/SteGermaine/horaires_offices/nd_de_consolation_horaires_offices_2013_2014.php Chapelle Notre-Dame de Consolation : horaires des offices pour l'année 2013-2014]&lt;/ref&gt; (others exist in the [[Île de France]]) and although it is not their official French headquarters&lt;ref&gt;The SSPX list their French headquarters as ''Prieure Saint Pie X, 11, rue Cluseret, BP 125'', from [http://www.sspx.org/headquarters.html Headquarters of the SSPX] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060811210614/http://www.sspx.org/headquarters.html |date=2006-08-11 }}, from their website in the USA&lt;/ref&gt; it is seen as their de facto national centre.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Unlike [[Saint Longinus|Longinus]], he is not named here]]

'''Stephaton''', or '''Steven''', is the name given in medieval [[Christianity|Christian]] traditions to the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] soldier, [[list of names for the Biblical nameless|unnamed in the Bible]], who offered [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]] a sponge soaked in [[vinegar]] wine at the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]]. In later depictions of the Crucifixion, Stephaton is frequently portrayed with [[Saint Longinus|Longinus]], the name given to the soldier who pierced Jesus' side with a spear.

==Gospel accounts==
The account of [[Jesus]] receiving a sponge soaked in vinegar while on the cross appears in all four of the [[canonical gospels]], with some variation. In both {{bibleref|Mark|15:35-36}} and {{bibleref|Matthew|27:47-48}}, just after Jesus says "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me", a stander by soaks a sponge in vinegar and raises it on a reed for Jesus to drink. {{bibleref|Luke|23:36-37}} mentions that the attendant soldiers offer Jesus vinegar while mocking him – moving the mocking motif that occurs earlier in Mark and Matthew to the Crucifixion.&lt;ref name=Luke&gt;Johnson, Luke Timothy, and Daniel J. Harrington (1991) [https://books.google.com/books?id=eum1ijxbr6kC&amp;pg=PA377&amp;dq=Jesus+vinegar+Gospel+of+Luke&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mkbiTuyQBMbqtge8rbCoBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=vinegar&amp;f=false ''The Gospel of Luke''], p. 375 and note. Liturgical Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In {{bibleref|John|19:28-30}}, Jesus declares "I thirst" (one of his [[Sayings of Jesus on the cross|last words]]) and is given the vinegar-soaked sponge "on [[ezov|hyssop]]".&lt;ref name=John&gt;Moloney, Francis J., and Daniel J. Harrington (1998). [https://books.google.com/books?id=2xDRFYKldboC&amp;pg=PA501&amp;dq=Jesus+%22I+thirst%22+crucifixion&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gTniTv3nA4abtwfNzr35BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwAw#v=snippet&amp;q=%22I%20thirst%22&amp;f=false ''The Gospel of John''], p. 501 and note. Liturgical Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of the act is unclear, though it is usually interpreted as an act of mercy on the part of the soldiers. The episode may allude to Psalm 68:22: "In my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink."&lt;ref name=Luke/&gt;

==In art==
The soldier who offered Jesus the sponge is often paired with [[Saint Longinus|Longinus]], the name later given to the unnamed soldier who pierced Christ's side with a spear during the Crucifixion. It is not known when or how the name "Stephaton" originated for this character, though it had become common well before the end of the first millennium.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 93-94&lt;/ref&gt;

In an iconographic tradition originating in [[Byzantine art]], and continuing in [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian art]],&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 93-94, 101, 105 &lt;/ref&gt; in [[Crucifixion in the arts|depictions of the Crucifixion]], he was regularly shown alongside Longinus, with their actions shown simultaneously, though in the Biblical narrative, these took place at different times (Stephaton's occurs before Jesus' death, Longinus' occurred after.)  This is also seen in [[Irish art]]&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 102-103; [https://books.google.com/books?id=PggIclfQfx0C&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86]&lt;/ref&gt; Colum Hourihane and others suggest the images should not be read as a simple narrative, but rather a mix of symbolism and representation typical of medieval art.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 93-94; [https://books.google.com/books?id=PggIclfQfx0C&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Temple of Eshmun''' ({{lang-ar|معبد أشمون}}) is an ancient [[place of worship]] dedicated to [[Eshmun]], the [[Phoenicia]]n god of healing. It is located near the [[Awali (river)|Awali river]], {{convert|2|km|mi}} northeast of [[Sidon]] in southwestern [[Lebanon]]. The site was occupied from the 7th century BC to the 8th century AD, suggesting an integrated relationship with the nearby city of Sidon. Although originally constructed by Sidonian king [[Eshmunazar II sarcophagus|Eshmunazar II]] in the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid era]] ({{circa}} 529–333&amp;nbsp;BC) to celebrate the city's recovered wealth and stature, the temple complex was greatly expanded by [[Bodashtart]], [[Yatan-milk]] and later monarchs. Because the continued expansion spanned many centuries of alternating independence and foreign [[hegemony]], the sanctuary features a wealth of different architectural and decorative styles and influences.

The sanctuary consists of an [[esplanade]] and a grand court limited by a huge [[limestone]] terrace wall that supports a monumental [[podium]] which was once topped by Eshmun's Graeco-Persian style [[marble]] temple. The sanctuary features a series of ritual [[Ritual purification|ablution]] basins fed by canals channeling water from the Asclepius river (modern [[Awali (river)|Awali]]) and from the sacred "Ydll" spring;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The Phoenicians did not mark [[vowel]]s at all until the [[Punics]] fitfully added a system of [[mater lectionis|matres lectionis]] (vowel letters); for this reason the Phoenician inscription "Ydll" may be transcribed with a number of variant spellings (Yidlal, Yadlol etc.) Franz L. Benz (1982). ''Personal Names in the Phoenician and Punic Inscriptions''. Pontificio Istituto Biblico. p199, {{ISBN|978-8-876-53427-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; these installations were used for therapeutic and purificatory purposes that characterize the cult of Eshmun. The sanctuary site has yielded many artifacts of value, especially those inscribed with [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician texts]], providing valuable insight into the site's history and that of ancient Sidon.

The Eshmun Temple was improved during the early [[Roman Empire]] with a colonnade street, but declined after earthquakes and fell into oblivion as [[Early Christianity|Christianity]] replaced [[paganism]] and its large limestone blocks were used to build later structures. The temple site was rediscovered in 1900 by local [[Treasure hunting|treasure hunters]] who stirred the curiosity of international scholars. [[Maurice Dunand]], a French archaeologist, thoroughly excavated the site from 1963 until the beginning of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1975. After the end of the hostilities and the retreat of [[Israel]] from [[Southern Lebanon]], the site was rehabilitated and inscribed to the [[World Heritage Site]] tentative list.

==Eshmun==
{{Main article|Eshmun|Ancient Canaanite religion}}
Eshmun was the Phoenician god of healing and renewal of life; he was one of the most important divinities of the [[Ancient Canaanite religion|Phoenician pantheon]] and the main male divinity of [[Sidon]]. Originally a nature divinity, and a god of spring vegetation, Eshmun was equated to [[Babylonia]]n deity [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]]. His role later expanded within the Phoenician pantheon, and he gained celestial and cosmic attributes.&lt;ref name="JWA"&gt;{{Cite book|publisher = Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-0-766-17671-3|pages = 136–140|last = Jayne|first = Walter Addison| title = Healing Gods of Ancient Civilizations|year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The myth of Eshmun was related by the sixth century Syrian [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist philosopher]] [[Damascius]] and ninth century [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]]. They recount that Eshmun, a young man from [[Beirut]], was hunting in the woods when [[Astarte]] saw him and was stricken by his beauty. She harassed him with her amorous pursuit until he [[Emasculation|emasculated]] himself with an [[axe]] and died. The grieving goddess revived Eshmun and transported him to the heavens where she made him into a god of [[heaven]].&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;in [[Damascius]]'s ''Life of Isidore'' and Photius's ''Bibliotheca Codex 242''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "wmb"/&gt;

From a historical perspective, the first written mention of Eshmun goes back to 754&amp;nbsp;BC, the date of the signing of the treaty between [[Assyria]]n king [[Ashur-nirari V]] and Mati'el, king of [[Arpad, Syria|Arpad]]; Eshmun figures in the text as a patron of the treaty.&lt;ref name="ddup"/&gt;

Eshmun was identified with [[Asclepius]] as a result of the Hellenic influence over Phoenicia; the earliest evidence of this equation is given by coins from [[Amrit]] and [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] from the third century BC. This fact is exemplified by the Hellenized names of the [[Awali (river)|Awali]] river which was dubbed ''Asclepius fluvius'', and the Eshmun Temple's surrounding groves, known as the groves of Asclepius.&lt;ref name= "JWA" /&gt;

===Historical background===
In the 9th century BC, the [[Assyria]]n king [[Ashurnasirpal&amp;nbsp;II]] conquered [[Mount Lebanon|the Lebanon]] mountain range and its coastal cities. The new sovereigns exacted tribute from Sidon, along with every other [[Phoenicia]]n city. These payments stimulated Sidon's search for new means of provisioning and furthered Phoenician emigration and expansion, which peaked in the 8th century BC.&lt;ref name="ddup"/&gt;
When Assyrian king [[Sargon II]] died in 705&amp;nbsp;BC, the Sidonian king [[Luli]] joined with the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] in an unsuccessful rebellion against Assyrian rule,&lt;ref name="teoh"&gt;{{Cite book|edition = 6, illustrated|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn = 978-0-395-65237-4|page = 36|last = Stearns|first = Peter|authorlink = Peter Stearns|author2=William Leonard Langer  |title = The Encyclopedia of world history: ancient, medieval, and modern, chronologically arranged|year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was forced to flee to [[Kition]] (modern [[Larnaca]] in Cyprus) with the arrival of the Assyrian army headed by [[Sennacherib]], Sargon&amp;nbsp;II's son and successor. Sennacherib instated [[Ittobaal]] on the throne of Sidon and reimposed the annual tribute.&lt;ref name="teoh"/&gt;
When [[Abdi-Milkutti]] ascended to Sidon's throne in 680 BC, he also rebelled against the Assyrians. In response, the Assyrian king [[Esarhaddon]] laid siege to the city. Abdi-Milkutti was captured and beheaded in 677&amp;nbsp;BC after a three-year siege, while his city was destroyed and renamed Kar-Ashur-aha-iddina (the harbor of Esarhaddon). Sidon was stripped of its territory, which was awarded to [[Baal&amp;nbsp;I]], the king of rival [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and loyal [[vassal]] to Esarhaddon.&lt;ref name="ddup"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bible"/&gt; Baal&amp;nbsp;I and [[Esarhaddon's Treaty with Ba'al of Tyre|Esarhaddon signed a treaty]] in 675 in which Eshmun's name features as one of the deities invoked as guarantors of the covenant.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Eshmun's name is transcribed in Akkadian as  "''Ia-su-mu-nu''"  in the Esarhaddon treaty&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "wmb"&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Wm.

===Construction===
Sidon returned to its former level of prosperity while Tyre was besieged for 13&amp;nbsp;years (586–573&amp;nbsp;BC) by the [[Chaldea]]n king [[Nebuchadnezzar&amp;nbsp;II]].&lt;ref name = "west"&gt;{{Cite book | edition = 2, illustrated, revised | publisher = Cambridge University Press|isbn = 978-0-521-79543-2|pages = 58–60|last = Aubet|first = María Eugenia|title = The Phoenicians and the West: politics, colonies and trade|year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Sidonian king was still held in exile at the court of [[Babylon]].&lt;ref name="ddup"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "ANET" &gt;{{Cite book|edition = 3| publisher = Princeton University Press|isbn = 978-0-8357-8801-4|last = Pritchard|first = James B.|title = Ancient Near Eastern Texts: Relating to the Old Testament|year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sidon reclaimed its former standing as Phoenicia's chief city in the [[Achaemenid Empire]] ({{circa}}529–333&amp;nbsp;BC). During this period, [[Xerxes&amp;nbsp;I]] awarded king Eshmunazar&amp;nbsp;II with the [[Sharon plain]]&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Territory south of Sidon from [[Mount Carmel]] to [[Jaffa]]&lt;/ref&gt; for employing Sidon's fleet in his service during the [[Greco-Persian Wars]].&lt;ref name="ddup"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "ANET"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "phoenician"/&gt;

Eshmunazar II displayed his new-found wealth by constructing numerous temples to Sidonian divinities. Inscriptions found on the king's [[sarcophagus]] reveal that he and his mother, Amashtarte, built temples to the gods of Sidon,&lt;ref name= "ddup"/&gt; including the Temple of Eshmun by the "Ydll source near the cistern".&lt;ref name="old"&gt;{{Cite book | edition = reprint | publisher = Ayer publishing | isbn = 978-0-8369-5771-6 | page = 137 | last = Hogarth | first = David George | authorlink = David George Hogarth |author2=Samuel Rolles Driver  |title = Authority and archaeology, sacred and profane | year = 1971 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cts"&gt;{{cite book | last = Curtis John| first = Sandra | authorlink = |author2=Nigel Tallis |author3=Béatrice André-Salvini | title = Forgotten Empire: The world of Ancient Persia| publisher =University of California Press | year = 2005 |page =42 | url =  | isbn = 978-0-520-24731-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman era and Decline===
The Eshmun sanctuary was damaged by an earthquake in the fourth century BC, which demolished the marble temple atop the podium; this structure was not rebuilt but many chapels and temples were later annexed at the base of the podium.&lt;ref name = "paul"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "NJ"&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Dar el Mashreq | isbn = 978-0-71892-187-3 | last = Jidejian | first = Nina | title = Sidon, through the ages | year = 1971 |pages = 287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple site remained a place of pilgrimage in the [[classical antiquity]] during the early Roman Empire and until the advent of Christianity, when the cult of Eshmun was banned during the [[Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire]] and a Christian church was built at the temple site across the [[Roman roads|Roman street]] from the podium.&lt;ref name = "NJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "GB"&gt;{{Cite book| edition = illustrated | publisher = University of Michigan | isbn = 978-0-8109-0779-9 | last = Barraclough | first = Geoffrey | authorlink =Geoffrey Barraclough| title = The Christian world: a social and cultural history | year = 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remnants and mosaic floors of a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] church can still be seen on the site.

A Roman colonnade was built in the third century, probably by emperor [[Septimius Severus]], and a Roman Villa showed a period of renewed relative importance for the city during the late period of [[Phoenicia under Roman rule]]. Furthermore, within the original Phoenician temple site the Romans added the processional stairway, the basins for ablutions and a [[nymphaeum]] with pictorial mosaics, that are still largely intact. Worn statuettes of three nymphs stand in the niches of a Roman fountain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lebmania.com/about/photos/eshmoun/index.htm Roman Eshmoun: Roman Colonnade, villa &amp; stairway with nimphaeum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another earthquake hit Sidon around 570 AD; [[Antoninus of Piacenza (pilgrim)|Antoninus of Piacenza]], an Italian Christian pilgrim, described the city as partly in ruins. For many years after the disappearance of the cult of Eshmun, the sanctuary site was used as a quarry:&lt;ref name = "NJ"/&gt; Emir [[Fakhr-al-Din II]], for example, used its massive blocks to build a bridge over the Awali river in the 17th century.&lt;ref name =  "SHMN"/&gt;

The site later fell into oblivion until the 19th century&lt;ref name = "NJ"/&gt;

Between 1737 and 1742, [[Richard Pococke]], an English [[Anthropology|anthropologist]], toured the Middle East and wrote of what he thought were ruins of [[defensive wall]]s built with {{convert|3.7|m|ft|adj=on}} stone blocks near the Awali river. When the French [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] [[Ernest Renan]] visited the area in 1860, he noticed that the Awali bridge [[abutment]]s were built of finely [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] blocks that originated from an earlier structure. He also noted in his report, [[Mission de Phénicie (1865–1874)|''Mission de Phénicie'']], that a local treasure hunter told him of a large edifice near the Awali bridge.&lt;ref name = "syr"&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 5 | issue = 5-1 | pages = 9–23 | last = Conteneau | first = Gaston | title = Deuxième mission archéologique à Sidon (1920)  | journal = Syria | accessdate = 2009-08-31 | year = 1924 | url =http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/syria_0039-7946_1924_num_5_1_3094 | doi = 10.3406/syria.1924.3094|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, local clandestine treasure hunters digging at the Eshmun Temple site haphazardly discovered inscriptions carved onto the temple's walls. This discovery stirred the interest of Theodore Macridy, curator of the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums|Museum of Constantinople]], who cleared the temple remains between 1901 and 1903.&lt;ref name = "syr"/&gt; Wilhelm Von Landau also excavated the site between 1903 and 1904.&lt;ref name="ddup"/&gt; In 1920, Gaston Contenau headed a team of archaeologists who surveyed the temple complex.&lt;ref name= "syr"/&gt; The first extensive archaeological excavation revealing the Eshmun Temple remains was undertaken by Maurice Dunand between 1963 and 1975.&lt;ref name="ddup"/&gt;&lt;ref name="poe"/&gt; Archaeological evidence shows that the site was occupied from the seventh century BC to the eighth century AD.&lt;ref name="MESu"&gt;{{Citation| publisher = UNESCO |author=Direction Générale des Antiquités, Ministère de la Culture et de l'Enseignement Supérieur | title =Monument: Temple d'Echmoun&amp;nbsp;– UNESCO World Heritage Centre|url =http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/401/ |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After 1975===
During the [[Lebanese Civil War]] and the [[South Lebanon conflict (1985–2000)|Israeli occupation of South Lebanon (1985–2000)]], the temple site was neglected and was invaded by vegetation overgrowth;&lt;ref name="da"&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Petit Futé | isbn = 978-2-7469-1632-6 | page = 12 | last = Auzias | first = Dominique | author2 = Jean-Paul Labourdette |author3=Guillaume Boudisseau|author4=Christelle Thomas | title = Le Petit Futé Liban | year = 2008 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was cleared and recovered its former condition after the Israeli withdrawal. Today the Eshmun sanctuary can be visited all year round and free of charge, it is accessible from an [[Interchange (road)|exit ramp]] off the main Southern Lebanon highway near Sidon's northern entrance. The site holds a particular [[archaeology|archaeological]] importance since it is the best preserved Phoenician site in Lebanon;&lt;ref name="CN"&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Etudes et Consultations Economiques | page = 46 | last = Najjar | first = Charles |author2=Tyma Daoudy  | title = The indispensable guide to Lebanon | year = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]] Tentative List's Cultural category on {{Nowrap|July 1}}, 1996.&lt;ref name="MESu"/&gt;

In literature, the temple of Eshmun figures in Nabil Saleh's 2009 novel, ''The Curse of [[Ezekiel]]'' as the setting where Bomilcar falls in love and rescues princess Chiboulet from the evil design of one of the temple's priests.&lt;ref name="novel"&gt;{{Cite book |publisher = Quartet books | isbn = 978-0-7043-7167-5 | last = Saleh | first = Nabil | title = The Curse of Ezekiel | year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the opposite short side, the three personages are assumed to be [[Dione (mythology)|Dione]], [[Aphrodite]] and [[Selene]] driving a [[quadriga]].

Northeast of the site, another 3rd&amp;nbsp;century BC temple stands adjacent to the Astarte chapel. Its {{convert|22|m|ft|adj=on}}façade is built with large limestone blocks and displays a two-register relief decoration illustrating a [[Bacchanalia|drunken revelry]] in honor of [[Dionysus]], the Greek god of wine. Among the temple reliefs, one shows a man attempting to seize a large rooster which was the common sacrificial animal for Eshmun-Asclepius.&lt;ref name = "NJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "hart"&gt;{{Cite book | edition = illustrated | publisher = RSM press | isbn = 978-1-85315-409-6 | page = 73 | last = Hart | first = Gerald David | title = Asclepius: the god of medicine | series = History of Medicine Series | year = 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eshmun Temple complex comprises an elaborate [[Hydraulics|hydraulic installation]] channeling water from "Ydll" spring that is made up of an intricate system of water canals, a series of retaining basins, sacred ablution basins and paved pools. This system demonstrates the importance of ritual ablutions in Phoenician therapeutic cults.&lt;ref name="basins"&gt;{{Cite book | edition = illustrated | publisher = I.B.

Later vestiges date from the [[History of Lebanon under Roman rule|Roman epoch]] and include a colonnaded road lined with shops. Of the large marble columns bordering the Roman street only fragments and bases remain. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] also built a monumental staircase adorned with [[mosaic]] patterns that leads to the top of the podium. To the right of the Roman road, near the entrance of the site stands a [[nymphaeum]] with [[Niche (architecture)|niches]] where statues of the [[nymph]]s once stood. The floor of the nymphaeum is covered by a mosaic depicting the [[Maenads]]. Across the colonnaded road, facing the nymphaeum, are the ruins of a [[Roman villa]]; only the villa's courtyard has survived along with the remains of a mosaic depicting the [[Season|four seasons]]. To the right of the processional Roman staircase stands a cubic [[altar]], also of Roman construction. Other Roman period structures include two columns of a great portico leading to pools and other cultic installations.&lt;ref name="ddup"/&gt;&lt;ref name =  "SHMN"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Lebanese Ministry of Tourism | title = Eshmoun&amp;nbsp;– A unique Phoenician site in Lebanon | work = Lebmania | accessdate = 2009-09-04 | url = http://www.lebmania.com/about/photos/eshmoun/index.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =  "SLH"&gt;{{Cite book | edition = illustrated | publisher = Footprint Travel Guides | isbn = 978-1-900949-90-3 | pages =542–543 | last = Mannheim |first = Ivan | title = Syria &amp; Lebanon handbook | series = Footprint series | year = 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
Eshmun's cult enjoyed a particular importance at Sidon as he was the chief deity after 500&amp;nbsp;BC. Aside from the extramural sanctuary at Bustan el-Sheikh, Eshmun also had a temple within the city. The extramural Eshmun Temple was associated with purification and healing; ritual lustral ablutions were performed in the sanctuary's sacred basins supplemented by running water from the Asclepius River and the "Ydll" spring water which was considered to have a sacred character and therapeutic quality.&lt;ref name = "wmb"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "RR"&gt;{{Cite journal | issn = 1988-9100 | volume = 1 | pages = 21–40 | last = Rodriguez | first = Raquel |title = El uso cúltico del agua en el mundo fenicio y Púnico.

The healing attributions of Eshmun were combined with his divine consort Astarte's [[fertility|fertilizing]] powers; the latter had an annex chapel with a sacred paved pool within the Eshmun sanctuary.&lt;ref name="RR"/&gt; Pilgrims from all over the ancient world flocked to the Eshmun Temple leaving [[Votive offering|votive]] traces of their devotion and proof of their cure.&lt;ref name="MsO"&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 32 | pages = 45–49 | last = Masson O. | title = Pélerins chypriotes en Phénicie (Sarepta et Sidon) | journal = Semitica Paris | year = 1982 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Leb"&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Macmillan | page = 137 |last = Hitti | first = Philip K. | title = Lebanon in History from the earliest times to the present| accessdate = 2009-09-01 |year = 1957 | url = https://www.questia.com/read/100122358?title=Lebanon%20in%20History%20from%20the%20Earliest%20Times%20to%20the%20Present# }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that from the 3rd century BC onwards there have been attempts to Hellenize the cult of Eshmun and to associate him with his Greek counterpart Asclepius, but the sanctuary retained its curative function.&lt;ref name="NJ4"&gt;{{Cite book | edition = 1 | publisher = Dar an-Nahar |isbn = 2-84289-344-1 &lt;!-- | pages = 342  --&gt;| last = Jidejian | first = Nina | title = Liban une mosaïque de cultures Lebanon a mosaic of cultures | year = 2001 }} {{fr icon}} {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the large decorative elements, carved friezes and mosaics which were left [[in situ]], many artifacts were recovered and moved from the Eshmun Temple to the [[National Museum of Beirut|national museum]], the [[Louvre]] or are in possession of the Lebanese directorate general of antiquities. Some of these smaller finds include a collection of inscribed [[ostracon|ostraca]] unearthed by Dunand providing rare examples of cursive Phoenician writing in the Phoenician mainland.&lt;ref name="poe"&gt;{{Cite book |publisher = BRILL | isbn = 978-90-04-10068-8 | pages =21, 100–101, 120, 365, 460, 566–567, 617 | last = Krings | first = Veronique | title = La civilisation phénicienne et punique | accessdate = 2009-03-17 | year = 1995 | url =https://books.google.com/?id=tdPwhNHB3Z4C&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=temple+d%27eshmoun |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the recovered ostracon bears the [[Theophoric name|theophoric]] Phoenician name "grtnt" which suggests that veneration of the lunar-goddess [[Tanit]] occurred in Sidon.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Antoine Vanel, Six "ostraca" phéniciens trouvés dans le temple d'Echmoun, près de Saida, in [[National museum of beirut#Publications|Bulletin du Musée de Beyrouth]], 20, (1967), p.53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leuven"&gt;{{Cite conference | publisher = Peeters Publishers | isbn = 978-90-6831-073-3 | volume = v.22 ''Orientalia Lovaniensia analecta'' | page = 81 | last = Lipiński | first = Edward | title = Phoenicia and the East Mediterranean in the first millennium BC |booktitle = proceedings of the conference held in Leuven from November 14 to 16, 1985 | year = 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of fragmented votive life-size sculptures of little children lying on their side and holding a pet animal or a small object were also recovered at the temple site; among the best known of these is a sculpture of a royal child holding a dove with his right hand; the boy's head is shaved, his torso is bare and his lower body is wrapped in a large cloth. The socle of this sculpture is inscribed with a dedication from Baalshillem,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The dedication reads: "This (is the) statue which Baalshillem son of King Ba'na, king of the Sidonians, son of King Abdamun, king of the Sidonians, son of King Baalshillem, king of the Sidonians, gave to his lord Eshmun at the "Ydll"-Spring.

The repute of the sanctuary was far reaching. Cypriot pilgrims from [[Paphos]] left marks of their devotion for Astarte on a marble [[stele]] inscribed both in Greek and [[Cypriot syllabary]] at Astarte's shrine; this stele is now in the custody of the Lebanese directorate general of antiquities.&lt;ref name="MsO"/&gt;

==Pillaging==

During the civil war, upon a request from then Lebanese director general of antiquities [[Maurice Chehab]], Maurice Dunand moved more than 2000 artifacts from Sidon to a subterranean chamber at the [[Byblos Castle|Byblos crusader castle]], {{convert|30|km|mi}} north of Beirut. In 1981, the depot was looted and around 600 sculptures and architectural elements were stolen and smuggled out of Lebanon. Rolf Stucky, ex-director of the Institute of Classical Archeology of [[Basel]] affirmed during a conference in Beirut in {{Nowrap|December 2009}} the successful identification and return of eight sculptures to the Lebanese national museum.&lt;ref name="LOLJ"/&gt;

'''''The PTL Club''''' (PTL stands for "Praise The Lord" or "People That Love"), later called '''''The Jim and Tammy Show''''', and in its last days '''''PTL Today''''' and '''''Heritage Today''''', was a [[Christian]] television program first hosted by [[Evangelism|evangelist]]s [[Jim Bakker|Jim]] and [[Tammy Faye Bakker]], which ran from 1974 to 1989. ''The PTL Club'', which adopted a talk-show format, was the flagship television program of the Bakkers' [[PTL Satellite Network]].

== History ==
Jim Bakker and his wife Tammy had been in the ministry with the [[Assemblies of God]] since the early 1960s prior to joining [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Broadcasting Network]], then based in [[Portsmouth, Virginia]] in 1965. The Bakkers launched a children's show called ''Come On Over'' where the couple entertained viewers with songs, stories, and puppets. In 1966 Jim Bakker became the host of ''[[The 700 Club]]'', a religious talk program which evolved from a [[telethon]]. ''The 700 Club'' would become the flagship program of Christian Broadcasting Network, which expanded from its original [[WGNT|Hampton Roads]] station to include outlets in [[WGCL-TV|Atlanta]] and [[KXTX-TV|Dallas–Fort Worth]] by 1973.

Beginning in 1972, ''The 700 Club'' was launched in a dozen test markets, including then-independent station [[WCNC-TV|WRET-TV]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]]. When station owner [[Ted Turner]] dropped the show from his station in 1974, Turner approached Bakker about buying two hours a day on his Charlotte station, which Bakker accepted. He opted to call the show ''The PTL Club'', and ''The 700 Club'' moved to then-ABC affiliate [[WCCB]] in Charlotte. The program began as a local TV broadcast in a small studio at WRET in November 1974. The show expanded to a few other stations early the next year, such as [[WGGS]] in [[Greenville, SC]], [[WHMB]] in [[Indianapolis]], [[WUVN|WHCT]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] and [[KPXN|KHOF]] in [[Los Angeles]], among a few others. The show launched nationally in the fall of 1975, with two editions offered: one was the full two-hour edition, which tended to air on Christian stations and smaller independent stations, and the other was a one-hour edition which tended to air on stronger independent stations, as well as network affiliates.

By 1976, the Bakkers moved their studio to a former [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] furniture store. The show continued to be hosted by [[Jim Bakker]] and co-hosted by his wife, [[Tammy Faye Bakker]]. Bakker and his staff built what became known as the PTL Television Network (later named The Inspirational Network), a worldwide Christian satellite cable television network. In a ''[[The Tonight Show|Tonight Show]]''-type format, the program featured many well-known ministers and Christian recording artists.  In the beginning, "Uncle Henry" Harrison (who had worked with Bakker at CBN) was the co-host/sidekick (much like [[Ed McMahon]] to [[Johnny Carson]]), and when Tammy Faye took over as co-host, Harrison became just the announcer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PTL Considering Future|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1987/PTL-Considering-Future-Of-Bakker-s-Parents-At-Ministry/id-70322a18e9efc88cbe112383a72ad4d0| date=August 10, 1987|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=August 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was later broadcast from Bakker's Heritage Village ministry headquarters and complex on Park Road in Charlotte, and then moved to studios constructed at the ministry's new 2500-acre mixed use family theme park and resort in [[Fort Mill, South Carolina]] known as [[Heritage USA]]. Bakker's [[conspicuous consumption]] and [[prosperity gospel]] preaching led critics to claim that PTL stood for "Pass The Loot."{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

As time went on and as more stations had additional programming commitments by 1981, many opted to only run an hour of the ''PTL Club''. In the fall of 1982, the show was cut to an hour, at which length it remained until its cancellation.

===Scandal and subsequent demise===
Due to his involvement in highly publicized financial and sexual scandals, Bakker resigned on March 19, 1987. He turned the cable network, the [[Heritage USA]] complex and all ministry assets over to fellow televangelist [[Jerry Falwell]]. Falwell became CEO of parent company, Heritage Village Church &amp; Missionary Fellowship, Inc. and assumed control of the network and of its flagship program. Falwell's involvement was deemed newsworthy,{{By whom|date=October 2012}} as the PTL ministries were a part of the [[Assemblies of God]] denomination and Falwell was a Baptist. Ministry supporters questioned Falwell's intentions and attributed his interest solely to maintaining control of the lucrative cable-television empire owned by PTL to broadcast his own ministry programming.

One commentator noted that "Bakker arranged for Falwell to take over PTL in March in an effort to avoid what he called a 'hostile takeover' of the television ministry by people threatening to expose a sexual encounter he admitted to having had seven years earlier with church secretary [[Jessica Hahn]]."&lt;ref&gt;
Steve Baker. [http://www.skepticfiles.org/cultinfo/taxscams.htm PTL-Falwell] Associated Press. July 21, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Hahn, on the afternoon of December 6, 1980, when she was a 21-year-old church secretary, Bakker and another preacher, John Wesley Fletcher drugged her and raped her for "about 15 minutes". Hahn stated she overheard Bakker say afterward to another PTL staffer, "Did you get her too?"&lt;ref&gt;
[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0507/14/lkl.01.html Transcript of interview] with [[Larry King]], [[CNN]], July 14, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

A federal grand jury indicted Bakker for directing millions of dollars of church funds to personal use. Much of the nation{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} watched the court case to see the outcome of the $165 million in donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.gospelgrace.com/falseprophets/jimbakker/JimBakker.html Jim Bakker|title=Jim Bakker|publisher= GospelGrace.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070830053605/http://www.gospelgrace.com/falseprophets/jimbakker/JimBakker.html

''The PTL Club'' continued as a television program for considerable time after this, first with Falwell as its host and PTL personality [[Doug Oldham]] as co-host. Falwell later brought in Christian singer Gary McSpadden as the show's co-host, along with PTL musical talent Ron Aldridge. The show was renamed ''PTL Today'', then — in an effort to distance the show from the PTL name — ''Heritage Today''. Aldridge continued as co-host alongside another PTL singer, Brenda Davis, after Falwell suddenly resigned from the now-bankrupt PTL ministry. McSpadden and Oldham subsequently left the show out of support for Falwell's decision to resign his position with the ministry.

With Falwell's resignation, Sam Johnson, a member of the PTL ministry team, assumed leadership and incorporated a new entity known as Heritage Ministries to run the television program and associated ministry functions. As Heritage USA and the PTL assets were now tied up in bankruptcy reorganization, the new ministry and the television program had to move from their longtime Heritage USA broadcast studios to newly purchased property on Nations Ford Road in Charlotte that was named Heritage Place.

The program remained on the air as late as September 1988, when Johnson faced problems with the IRS.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1989, evangelist [[Morris Cerullo]] purchased the network out of bankruptcy. {{As of | 2012}} it operates as [[The Inspiration Network|INSP]] from broadcast facilities in Charlotte, with headquarters in nearby [[Indian Land, South Carolina]].

On August 23, 1991, after the second and final day of his re-sentencing hearing, the court reduced Bakker's original 45-year sentence to 18 years, five of which he actually served before being released.

In February 2009, [[Atlanta, Georgia]] investment-banker Ben Dyer announced his intention to auction off over 15,000 hours of videotaped episodes of ''The PTL Club'' on March 27, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;

In [[Jainism]], a '''tīrtha''' ({{lang-sa|तीर्थ}} "[[Ford (crossing)|ford]], a shallow part of a body of water that may be easily crossed") is used to refer both to  [[pilgrimage]] sites as well as to the four sections of the [[sangha (Jainism)|sangha]]. A tirtha provides the inspiration to enable one to cross over from worldly engagement to the side of [[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsgc.org/tirth.htm Special features of sacred places of Jains] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413051722/http://www.jsgc.org/tirth.htm |date=2009-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jain tirthas are located throughout India. Often a tirtha has a number of temples as well as residences (dharmashala) for the pilgrims and wandering monks and scholars. 

==Types==
Tirtha sites include:&lt;ref&gt;Jainism: A Pictorial Guide to the Religion of Non-Violence, Kurt Titze, Motilal Banarsidass; 2nd edition (March 5, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Siddhakshetra''s or site of [[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]] liberation of an [[Arihant (Jainism)|arihant]] (''kevalin'') or [[Tirthankara]]s like [[Mount Kailash|Ashtapada Hill]], [[Shikharji]], [[Girnar]], [[Pawapuri]], [[Palitana]], [[Mangi-Tungi]] and [[Champapuri]] (capital of [[Anga]])
* ''Atishayakshetra''s where divine events have occurred like [[Mahavirji]], [[Rishabhdeo]], [[Kundalpur]], [[Aharji]] etc.
* ''Puranakshetra''s associated with lives of great men like [[Ayodhya]], [[Vidisha]], [[Hastinapur]], and [[Rajgir]]
* ''Gyanakshetra'': associated with famous [[acharya]]s or centers of learning like [[Mohankheda]], [[Shravanabelagola]] and [[Ladnu]]

==Locations==
Geographically, the tirthas are divided into six quarters:&lt;ref&gt;Bharat ke Digambar Jain Tirth, Volume 1, Balbhadra Jain, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''North India'': [[Hastinapur]], [[Taxila]], and [[Mount Kailash|Ashtapada]]

'''Tunde Bakare''' is a [[Nigerian]] [[Prophetic]]-[[wikt:apostolic|Apostolic]] pastor. He has received national and international attention for his [[televangelism]], which has sometimes been critical of the [[Politics of Nigeria|Nigerian government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |page=174 |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WW-XcDe-IMEC |title=New religious movements in the twenty-first century }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was  reportedly arrested in March 2002 after preaching sermons critical of then-president [[Olusegun Obasanjo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?sf=86&amp;set_id=1&amp;click_id=68&amp;art_id=qw1015158240108B252 |publisher=The Independent (South Africa) |accessdate=26 April 2009 |date=3 March 2002 |title=Nigeria's 'prophet of doom' detained  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has appeared as a preacher on [[Africa Independent Television|AIT]] television.
The Nigerian presidential candidate of the [[Congress for Progressive Change]], CPC, Gen. [[Muhammadu Buhari]], on Monday, 31 January, announced Pastor Tunde Bakare of the Latter Rain Assembly, [[Lagos]] as his running mate for the [[2011 Nigerian presidential election]] which he accepted.
CPC lost the presidential election to PDP, and Pastor Bakare remains a fierce critic of the Nigerian government and leadership.
He was formerly a pastor at the [[Deeper Life Bible Church]] before he left to join the [[Redeemed Christian Church of God]] which he soon left to form his own.

==Early life==
Pastor Bakare attended All Saints Primary School, Kemta, Abeokuta and subsequently [[Lisabi Grammar School]], [[Abeokuta]], after which he studied law at the University of Lagos between 1977 and 1980. He was called to the Bar in 1981 and following his NYSC, he practiced law with Gani Fawehinmi Chambers, Rotimi Williams &amp; Co and Burke &amp; Co, Solicitors. He established his own law firm Tunde Bakare &amp; Co (El-Shaddai Chambers) in October 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bakare|first1=Tunde|title=About Tunde Bakare|url=http://tundebakare.com/about/|website=http://tundebakare.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1988, at the peak of his legal career he was called into ministry and he founded The Latter Rain Assembly (End-Time Church) on 1 April 1989 and is currently the Serving Overseer of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Latter Rain Assembly|title=About|url=http://lraglobal.org/the-executive-team/|website=https://lraglobal.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He presides over Global Apostolic Impact Network (GAIN) – a network of churches, ministries and kingdom businesses committed to advancing the Kingdom of God on earth. Dr. Bakare is also the President of Latter Rain Ministries, Inc. (Church Development Center) in Atlanta, GA, USA, a ministry committed to restoring today’s church to the scriptural pattern. In recognition of his years of exploits and global impact in ministry, he was honoured with a Doctor of Ministry degree by the Indiana Christian University under the leadership of his mentor, Dr. Lester Sumrall in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bakare|first1=Tunde|title=About Tunde Bakare|url=http://tundebakare.com/about/|website=http://tundebakare.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convictions==
His persuasion:
"I’m fully persuaded that I will live long in health; having long life in health, with wealth for the purpose for which He created me to be a blessing to humanity". This persuasion invariably affects and informs his thought patterns, decision making process and choices in life.

His conviction:
"God will not justify the wicked, He will not forsake the righteous; the wickedness of a wicked man will fall upon his head and the righteousness of a righteous man will answer for him in the days to come".

"The minority that is right will become the majority and the majority that is wrong will become the minority, it’s just a matter of time".

His passion:
"To see that the true perspective of the gospel of Jesus Christ is given to people without any contamination or mixture" and "To see a Nigeria that works in his lifetime".

His Legacy:
"My legacy? The grace to pray through". Surprisingly, Pastor Bakare initially as a young Christian did not have a flare or desire to pray, but according to him, circumstances in his marriage as orchestrated by God taught him not only how to pray but also how to pray through.

Secret of his success:
Obedience only to the word and instructions of God. Sandwiched between his willingness and desire to do the will of God is obedience even when all things are working contrary to the word of God.

==Personal life==
Pastor (Dr.) ‘Tunde Bakare was born to a [[Muslim]] mother and a Muslim father, whom he did not grow up to know. His mother, Madam Abigail Eebudola Bakare raised him. Married to Mrs. Olayide Bakare in 1984, Pastor Bakare’s marriage has played a pivotal role in his life, career and ministry. "Mrs. B", as she is affectionately called by her husband, has been involved in ministry work all her adult life. Pastor and Mrs. Bakare have raised two girls and three boys in their over thirty years of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bakare|first1=Tunde|title=About Tunde Bakare|url=http://tundebakare.com/about/|website=http://tundebakare.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yasna''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|ʌ|s|n|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/yasna "Yasna"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ae|𐬫𐬀𐬯𐬥𐬀}})&lt;!--Sanskrit cognate is discussed below --&gt; is the [[Avestan]] name of [[Zoroastrianism]]'s principal act of worship. It is also the name of the primary liturgical collection of [[Avesta]] texts, recited during that ''yasna'' ceremony.

==Overview==
The function of the ''yasna'' ceremony is, very roughly described, to strengthen the orderly spiritual and material creations of [[Ahura Mazda]] against the assault of the destructive forces of [[Angra Mainyu]]. The ''yasna'' service, that is, the recitation of the Yasna texts, culminates in the ''[[Ab-Zohr|apæ zaothra]]'', the "offering to the waters." The ceremony may also be extended by recitation of the ''[[Visperad]]'' and ''[[Vendidad]]'' texts. A normal ''yasna'' ceremony, without extensions, takes about two hours when it is recited by an experienced priest.

The ''Yasna'' texts constitute 72 chapters altogether, composed at different times and by different authors. The middle chapters include of the (linguistically) oldest texts of the Zoroastrian canon. These very ancient texts, in the very archaic and linguistically difficult [[Old Avestan]] language, include the four most sacred Zoroastrian prayers, and also 17 chapters comprising the five [[Gathas]], hymns that are considered to have been composed by Zoroaster himself. Several sections of the ''Yasna'' include [[exegesis|exegetical]] comments. ''Yasna'' chapter and verse pointers are traditionally abbreviated with ''Y.''

The Avestan language word ''yasna'' literally means 'oblation' or 'worship'.&lt;!-- enough already --&gt; The word is linguistically related to (but not the functional equivalent of) [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''[[yajna]]''. Unlike Sanskrit ''yajna'', which refers to a class of rituals, Zoroastrian ''yasna'' is a particular liturgy and ritual, and the ritual has "to do with water rather than fire."{{sfn|Drower|1944|p=78}}{{sfn|Boyce|1975|pp=147-191}}

==The service==
The theological function of the ''yasna'' ceremony, and the proper performance of it, is to further ''[[asha]]'', that is, the ceremony aims to strengthen that which is right/true (one meaning of ''asha'') in the existence/creation (another meaning of ''asha'') of divine order (yet another meaning of ''asha''). The [[Encyclopedia Iranica]] summarizes the aim of the ''yasna'' ceremony as "the maintenance of the cosmic integrity of the good creation of [[Ahura Mazda|Ahura Mazdā]]."{{sfn|Malandra|2006}} Zoroastrianism's cosmological/eschatological perception of the purpose of humankind is to strengthen the orderly spiritual and material creations of Mazda against the assault of the destructive forces of [[Angra Mainyu]]. In that conflict, theologically speaking, mankind's primary weapon is the ''yasna'' ceremony, which is understood to have a direct, immediate effect: "[f]ar from being a symbolic act, the proper performance of the yasna is what prevents the cosmos from falling into chaos."{{sfn|Malandra|2006}} The culminating act of the ''yasna'' ceremony is the [[Ab-Zohr]], the "strengthening of the waters".

The ''Yasna'' service, that is, the recitation of the Yasna texts, culminates in the ''[[Ab-Zohr]]'', the "offering to waters". The ''Yasna'' ceremony may be extended by recitation of the ''[[Visperad]]'' and ''[[Vendidad]]''.

A well-trained priest is able to recite the entire ''Yasna'' in about two hours.{{sfn|Stausberg|2004|pp=337,n131}} With extensions, it takes about an hour longer. In its normal form, the ''Yasna'' ceremony is only to be performed in the morning.

==The liturgy==

===Structure and organization===
{| &lt;!-- the table prevents text flow problems at resolutions greater than 1024x768 --&gt;
|-
|The texts of the ''Yasna'' are organized into 72 chapters, known as ''had''s or ''ha''s (from Avestan ''ha'iti'', 'cut'). The 72 threads of the Zoroastrian [[Kushti|Kusti]] the sacred girdle worn around the waist - represent the 72 chapters of the ''Yasna''.

From a literary point of view, the 72 chapters consist of two nested inner cores, and an outer envelope. The outer chapters/sections (the "envelope") are in the [[Avestan language|Younger Avestan]] language. The middle 27 chapters include the (linguistically) oldest texts of the Zoroastrian canon. The inner chapters/sections (excepting chapters 42.1-4,52.5-8) are in the more archaic [[Old Avestan]] language, with the four sacred formulae bracketing the innermost core. This innermost core includes the 17 chapters of the [[Gathas]], the oldest and most sacred texts of the Zoroastrian canon.
:Yasna 1-27.12
::Yasna 27.13-27.15: three of the four of the most sacred Zoroastrian prayers
:::Yasna 28-34: [[Gatha]] 1
::::Yasna 35-41: the "seven-chapter Yasna"
:::Yasna 43-51,53: Gathas 2-5 (chapters 43-46, 47-50, 51 and 53)
::Yasna 54.1: fourth of four of the most sacred Zoroastrian prayers
:Yasna 54.2-72
From a ritual point of view, the liturgy can be broken into 4 major sections, each having its own internal prelude:
::    Chapter 1-12: Invitation of the divinities to the worship
::    Chapter 13-59: The Staota Yesniia
::    Chapter 60-69: The culmination of the Yasna (the "[[Ab-Zohr]]"), accompanied by intense ritual activity.
::    Chapter 70-72: Conclusion and thanks to the divinities for attending

Some sections of the ''Yasna'' occur more than once. For instance, ''Yasna'' 5 is repeated as ''Yasna'' 37, and ''Yasna'' 63 consists of passages from ''Yasna'' 15.2, 66.2 and 38.3. The ability to recite the ''Yasna'' from memory is one of the prerequisites for Zoroastrian priesthood.

===Content summaries===
* '''''Yasna'' 1''' opens with the praise of [[Ahura Mazda]], enumerating his divine titles as the Creator, "radiant, glorious, the greatest, the best, the most beautiful, the most firm, the most wise, of the most perfect form, the highest in righteousness, possessed of great joy, creator, fashioner, nourisher, and the Most Holy Spirit." (Dhalla, 1936:155). ''Yasna'' 1 then enumerates the divinities, inviting them to the service.
* '''''Yasna'' 2''', the ''Barsom [[Yasht]]'', presents libation and the ''barsom'' (a bundle of 23 twigs bound together, symbolizing sanctity) to the invited divinities. ''Yasna'' 2-4 complement ''Yasna'' 1. Most verses in  ''Yasna'' 2-3 begin with the formula ''ayese yeshti …'', "by means of this sacrifice, I call   …", followed by the name of the divinity being invoked.
* '''''Yasna'' 3-8''' known collectively as the ''[[Sarosh]] dron'', presents other offerings (''zaothra''). ''Yasna'' 3 draws the attention of the divinities invoked in ''Yasna'' 1, and in ''Yasna'' 4, the offerings are consecrated to the divinities. ''Yasna'' 5 is repeated in ''Yasna'' 37. ''Yasna'' 6 is almost identical to the first 10 verses of ''Yasna'' 17.
* '''''Yasna'' 9-11''' is the ''Hom [[Yasht]]'', a collection of accolades to the [[Haoma]] plant and its divinity.
* '''''Yasna'' 12''' constitutes the ''Fravarane'', the Zoroastrian creed and declaration of faith. It is in "Artificial" Gathic Avestan, that is, it is stylistically and linguistically aligned with the language of the ''[[Gathas]]'', but imperfectly. The last strophe of verse 7 as well as all of verses 8 and 9 are incorporated into the ''Kusti'' ritual.
* '''''Yasna'' 13-18''' are comparable to ''Yasna'' 1-8 in that they too are a collection of invocations to the divinities. Chapters 14-18 serve as an introduction to the ''Staota Yesniia'' of ''Yasna'' 19-59. The first 10 verses of ''Yasna'' 17, "to the fires, waters, plants", is almost identical to ''Yasna'' 6.
* '''''Yasna'' 19-21''', the Bhagan ''Yasht'', are commentaries on the three 'high prayers' of ''Yasna'' 28-53.
* '''''Yasna'' 22-26''' is another set of invocations to the divinities.
* '''''Yasna'' 27''' has the prayers referred to by ''Yasna'' 19-21. These are:
** The ''[[Ahuna Vairya]]'' invocation (also known as the ''Yatha Ahu Vairyo''), the most sacred of all Zoroastrian prayers.
** The ''[[Ashem Vohu]]''
** The ''Yenghe hatam''
* [[File:Bodleian J2 fol 175 Y 28 1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''Yasna'' 28.1, [[Gathas|''Ahunavaiti'' Gatha]] (Bodleian MS J2)]]'''''Yasna'' 28-53''' include the (linguistically) oldest texts of the Zoroastrian canon. 17 of the 26 chapters make up the [[Gathas]], the most sacred hymns of Zoroastrianism and thought to have been composed by [[Zoroaster]] himself. The Gathas are in verse. These are structurally interrupted by a) the ''Yasna Haptanghaiti'' ("seven-chapter ''Yasna''", #35-41), which is as old as the Gathas but in prose, b) two short chapters (#42 and #52) that are not as old as the Gathas and ''Yasna Haptanghaiti''.
** '''''Yasna'' 28-34''': [[Gathas|''Ahunavaiti'' Gatha]]
** '''''Yasna'' 35-41''': ''[[Yasna Haptanghaiti]]'', the "seven-chapter ''Yasna''", also in Gathic Avestan but in prose.
** '''''Yasna'' 42''': a 4 verse chapter invoking the elements.
** '''''Yasna'' 43-46''': [[Gathas|''Ushtavait'' Gatha]]
** '''''Yasna'' 47-50''': [[Gathas|''Spenta Mainyu'' Gatha]]
** '''''Yasna'' 51''': [[Gathas|''Vohu Khshathra'' Gatha]]
** '''''Yasna'' 52''': an 8 verse hymn to [[Ashi]]. Verses 52.5 - 52.8, in Younger Avestan, are a duplicate of ''Yasna'' 8.5 - 8.8.
** '''''Yasna'' 53''': [[Gathas|''Vahishto Ishti'' Gatha]]
* '''''Yasna'' 54''' has the text of the ''[[Airyaman ishya|a airiiema ishiio]]'', a prayer referred to in ''Yasna'' 27.
* '''''Yasna'' 55''' is a praise to the ''Gathas'' and the ''Staota Yesniia''.
* '''''Yasna'' 56''' is again an invocation to the divinities, appealing for their attention.
* '''''Yasna'' 57''' is the ''[[Sarosh]] Yasht'', the hymn to the divinity of religious discipline. It is closely related to, and appears to have sections borrowed from ''Yasht'' 10, the hymn to [[Mithra]].
* '''''Yasna'' 58''' is again a "hidden" ''Yasht'', here to the genius of prayer (''cf.'' [[Dahman]]).
* '''''Yasna'' 59''' is a repetition of the sections from ''Yasna'' 17 and 26.
* '''''Yasna'' 60''' is blessing upon the house of the ''[[ashavan]]'' ('just' or 'true' man). ''Yasna'' 60.2-7 constitute the  [[Dahman|Dahma Afriti]] invocation, also known as the ''Afrinagan Dahman''.

In [[Australian Aboriginal mythology]] (specifically: [[Murngin]]), '''Yurlungur''' is a [[copper]] [[snake]] who was awakened from a deep [[sleep]] by the [[odor]] of a woman's [[menstruation|menstrual]] [[blood]].  The woman and her sisters, the [[Wawalag]], were eaten by Yurlungur, who was told at a later snake meeting to regurgitate the women.  In [[Australian Aborigine]] ceremonies, the vomiting symbolizes boys entering manhood.
