      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2822">The '''Andean passport''' is a [[passport]] for [[South America]]n [[country|countries]] that are members of the [[Andean Community of Nations]] (ACN).

==Origin and use==

The Andean passport was created in June 2001 pursuant to ACN Decisión 504. This passport is based on a standard model containing harmonised features of nomenclature and security based on the recommendations of the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO). The member states of the ACN agreed to phase in new Andean passports bearing the official name of the regional body in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] by January 2005, although previously issued national passports will be valid until their expiry date.

The passport is effective in [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]] and formerly, in [[Venezuela]]. Because [[Venezuela]] left the ACN in 2006, the country no longer issues Andean passports, and it is most likely to start issuing a new [[MERCOSUR]]-style passport as the country became a full member of that organization. Venezuelan ACN passports issued are valid until its expiration date. The last Venezuelan ACN passports were more likely to expire between 2011 and 2012.

==Basic features==
The Andean passport features:
* a passbook type format with rounded edges measuring {{convert|88|mm|in}} by {{convert|125|mm|in}}.
* a cover and back cover in “bordeaux” [[color]].
* legends printed in [[Gold (color)|gold]] color.
* Above the national seal of the issuing country, the cover has the legend "'''COMUNIDAD ANDINA'''", which is centered and printed in larger [[font]]s. Below the seal is printed the official name of the member country.
* the bottom of the cover has the word "'''PASAPORTE'''" ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]), with "PASSPORT" ([[English language|English]]) immediately below in smaller type.

The '''Arouquesa''' is a [[cattle]] breed from [[Portugal]].&lt;ref name="PorterAlderson2016"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Porter|first1=Valerie |last2=Alderson|first2=Lawrence |last3=Hall|first3=Stephen J.G.|editor=D. Phillip Sponenberg|title=Mason's World Encyclopedia of Livestock Breeds and Breeding, 2 Volume Pack|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2UEJDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113|accessdate=14 September 2017|date=9 March 2016|publisher=CABI|isbn=978-1-84593-466-8|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arouquesa breed was granted [[Protected Geographical Status|protected geographical status]] of [[Denominação de Origem Controlada|DOC]] (''Denominação de Origem Controlada'') from the [[European Commission]]

==Description==
The cows reach a height of {{convert|1.23|m|ft|abbr=on}}, the bulls {{convert|1.36|m|ft|abbr=on}}, so the Arouquesas can be described as small. The breed's weight is around {{convert|360|–|430|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Their hair colour is light brown although the males may become a little darker than females. Mucosa and claws are dark coloured. The wide horns are directed forward, first down and then up.&lt;ref name="Felius1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Felius|first=Marleen |title=Cattle breeds: an encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iXImAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=14 September 2017|year=1995|publisher=Misset|isbn=978-90-5439-017-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Arouquesas are adapted to the mountains - their hind legs are very muscular. In Portugal today they still work as draught cattle. In the past century oxen often were exported to Great Britain because of their beef. In 1902 Arouquesa beef was the winner of the "Award for the Best Beef" in Paris. Unfortunately this excellent, fine marbled beef today is only known in Portugal. There they count as the best native breed for beef production. The animals are very long-living; 16–18 calves per cow are not uncommon. Most times they practice mother cow husbandry. The animals are very affable but active.&lt;ref name="PorterAlderson2016"/&gt;

==Extension==
The breed region is circumscribed almost exclusively to the Northern Portuguese [[district]]s of [[Viseu]], [[Aveiro District|Aveiro]], [[Porto]], and [[Braga]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1666">The '''Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement''', widely known as the '''Arusha Accords''' ({{lang-fr|Accords d'Arusha}}), was a transitional [[peace treaty]] which brought the [[Burundian Civil War]] to an end{{fact|date=September 2018}}. The agreement, negotiated in [[Arusha]], [[Tanzania]] under the mediation of former Tanzanian president [[Julius Nyerere]], were signed on 28 August 2000.&lt;ref name=Nantulya&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nantulya|first1=Paul|title=Burundi: Why the Arusha Accords are Central|url=https://africacenter.org/spotlight/burundi-why-the-arusha-accords-are-central/|website=Africa Center for Strategic Studies|accessdate=12 May 2018|date=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Accords were based on four points of agreement:&lt;ref name=Nantulya/&gt;
#A power-sharing formula, based on an agreed formula of [[Racial quota|ethnic quota]]s in politics
#Representation of all parties in the state bureaucracy
#Constitutional restrictions to prevent any single party becoming excessively powerful
#Pathways to integrate former rebels and minority groups in the [[Military of Burundi|Burundian armed forces]].

The central tenets of the Arusha Accords were subsequently added to the [[Constitution of Burundi]].&lt;ref name=Nantulya/&gt;

'''"Baunilha e chocolate"''' ("Vanilla and chocolate") was the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1995]], performed in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] by [[Tó Cruz]].

The song is inspired by [[urban contemporary|urban music]] and features Cruz singing to his "sweetheart with white skin" while musing on their interracial relationship (Cruz is black). He suggests that this could only have been made possible via the intrepid maritime history of their country, and sings about the spices and cultural knowledge that were brought back to Portugal as a result of this history.

The song was performed sixteenth on the night, following the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Love City Groove]] with "[[Love City Groove (song)|Love City Groove]]" and preceding [[Cyprus]]' [[Alexandros Panayi]] with "[[Sti Fotia]]". At the close of voting, it had received 5 points, placing 21st in a field of 23.

It was succeeded as [[Portugal in the Eurovision Song Contest|Portuguese representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996|1996 contest]] by [[Lúcia Moniz]] with "[[O meu coração não tem cor]]".

'''''Bolo de mel''''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈbolu ðɨ ˈmɛɫ}}, "honey cake") is a traditional cake from the [[Madeira|Madeira Islands]].

==History==
This cake is considered to be Madeira's oldest dessert. Started up by Renato José dos Santos, who baked and decorated [[wedding cakes]] at {{lang|pt|Fábrica da Estrela}} before its fire of 1964. He proceeded to open his own factory in Rochinha Madeira, baking {{lang|pt|bolo de mel}}, sugared almonds, {{lang|pt|torradas}} (toasts, some recipes call for sweet buns) and {{lang|pt|[[broa]]s}} (breads with cornmeal in the recipe, also made with molasses).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Ingredients==
The {{lang|pt|bolo de mel}} cake became a popular confection when the island was an important sugar producer, since the cake itself is traditionally made with [[molasses]] instead of the now-popular [[honey]], which meant it could be stored for up to 5 years.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} When made with molasses, the cake is very dark in color and has a spongy sticky texture resembling a soft [[cookie]]. The cake often has [[walnuts]] and [[almond]]s mixed within it. When it is served in Madeira, it is customary not to cut the cake, but rather to tear pieces off using the hands.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

{{lang|pt|Bolo de mel}} is traditionally made during [[Christmas]] often in a large enough batch that it can be enjoyed throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bolo-de-mel.com/bolo-de-mel.html |title=Bolo de Mel |accessdate=2013-09-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053902/http://www.bolo-de-mel.com/bolo-de-mel.html |archivedate=2013-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, it was decided to move the operations of the Cotonou international airport to a new facility in [[Glo-Djigbé]]. Lack of funding quickly stopped the project.

Plans were revived in 2011 and President [[Yayi Boni]] presided at a ceremonial start to the construction of the new airport, using South African funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bénin : Glo-Djigbé, un aéroport flambant neuf à 360 milliards|url=http://www.ambassade-benin.fr/benin-glo-djigbe-un-aeroport-flambant-neuf-a-360-milliards/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130706154956/http://www.ambassade-benin.fr/benin-glo-djigbe-un-aeroport-flambant-neuf-a-360-milliards/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=6 July 2013|accessdate=6 July 2013|author=Beninese Embassy in Paris, France}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction on the new facility appears to have stalled again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Teiga|first=Marcus Boni|title=Bénin – Que sont les grands projets économiques devenus?|url=http://blog.slateafrique.com/echos-du-benin/2012/06/27/benin-%E2%80%93-que-sont-les-grands-projets-economiques-devenus/|publisher=SlateAfrique|accessdate=6 July 2013|language=French|date=27 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308233448/http://blog.slateafrique.com/echos-du-benin/2012/06/27/benin-%E2%80%93-que-sont-les-grands-projets-economiques-devenus/|archivedate=8 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
{{for|the 1909 development plan|Burnham Plan of Chicago}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2018}}

The '''Chicago plan''' was a collection of [[Monetary reform|banking reforms]] suggested by [[University of Chicago]] economists in the wake of the [[Great Depression]]. A six-page memorandum on banking reform was given limited and confidential distribution to about forty individuals on 16 March 1933. The plan was supported by such notable economists as [[Irving Fisher]], [[Frank H. Knight]], Lloyd W. Mints, [[Henry Schultz]], [[Henry C. Simons]], [[Garfield V. Cox]], [[Aaron Director]], [[Paul H. Douglas]], and Albert G. Hart.

During the period March to November, the Chicago economists received comments from a number of individuals on their proposal and in November 1933 another memorandum was prepared. The memorandum was expanded to thirteen pages; there was a supplementary memorandum on "Long-time Objectives of Monetary Management" (seven pages) and an appendix titled "Banking and Business Cycles" (six pages).

These memoranda generated much interest and discussion among lawmakers but the suggested reforms, such as the abolition of the fractional reserve system and imposition of 100% reserves on [[demand deposit]]s, were set aside and replaced by watered down alternative measures. The [[Banking Act of 1935]] institutionalized Federal deposit insurance and the separation of commercial and investment banking. It successfully restored the public's confidence in the banking system and ended discussion of banking reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Ronnie J.|last=Phillips|title=The 'Chicago Plan' and New Deal Banking Reform,Working Paper No. 76|publisher=The Levy Economics Institute.|date=June 1992|url=http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp/76.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|date=2006|first=Jesús|last=Huerta de Soto|title=Money, Bank Credit, and Economic Cycles|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|url=https://mises.org/sites/default/files/Money_Bank_Credit_and_Economic_Cycles_De%20Soto.pdf|pages=731–735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''A Program for Monetary Reform'' ==
After apparent recovery in the mid-1930s, America entered the [[Recession of 1937-1938]] and the key elements of the Chicago plan resurfaced in a July 1939 draft proposal titled ''A Program for Monetary Reform'' but did not result in any new legislation.

A Program for Monetary Reform (1939) was never published. A copy of the paper was apparently preserved in a college library.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Copies of the paper, stamped on the bottom of the first and last pages, “LIBRARY – COLORADO STATE COLLEGE OF A. &amp; M. A. – FORT COLLINS COLORADO” were circulated at the 5th Annual [[American Monetary Institute]] Monetary Reform Conference (2009) and the images were scanned for display on the internet.[https://web.archive.org/web/20121103110209/http://home.comcast.net/~zthustra/pdf/a_program_for_monetary_reform.pdf]

''A Program for Monetary Reform'' was attributed on its cover page to six American economists: [[Paul H. Douglas]], [[Irving Fisher]], [[Frank D. Graham]], [[Earl J. Hamilton]], Wilford I. King, and Charles R. Whittlesey.

The July 1939 draft proposal, coauthored by Paul Douglas and five others, resurrected proposals for banking and monetary reform from the Chicago plan but did not result in any new legislation.

The '''Clerk of the Weather''' or the '''Weather Clerk''' is "an imaginary functionary facetiously supposed to direct the weather."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Davidson, ''Chambers's twentieth century dictionary of the English language'', 1907, ''s.v.'' 'clerk'&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clerk of the Weather appears in children's stories by [[Rose Fyleman]] ("The Weather Clerk"),&lt;ref&gt;Rose Fyleman, ''Eight Little Plays for Children'', London, 1924&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Swindells]] (''The Weather-Clerk''),&lt;ref&gt;Robert Swindells (author), Petula Stone (illustrator), ''The weather-clerk'', London, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

He also appears in facetious turns of phrase such as "another fine day was supplied by the clerk of the weather".&lt;ref&gt;"A Harbor of Rest", ''Warsaw (Indiana) Daily Times'', 8 October 1887, p. 1 [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eoZHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tHwMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6110,2804305 Google News]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s short story "A Visit to the Clerk of the Weather" (1836), he is imagined as a 6000-year-old man living on another planet.  Within his dwelling, he has a stock of [[thunderbolts]], [[rainbow]]s, [[hailstones]], sacks of [[wind]], and a "portable tempest, firmly secured with iron bands".  His companions include [[Jack Frost]] and [[Spring (season)|Spring]].&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Hawthorne, "A Visit to the Clerk of the Weather", ''[[American Monthly Magazine (1833)|American Monthly Magazine]]'' '''1'''(NS):[https://books.google.com/books?id=aVlFAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA483 483]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Herman Melville]]'s poem "Pebbles" one finds "Though the Clerk of the Weather insist, / And lay down the weather-law, / Pintado and gannet they wist / That the winds blow whither they list / In tempest or flaw"

In [[Samuel Clemens]]' speech at the [[New England Society of New York]] in 1876, he attributed New England weather to "raw apprentices in the Weather Clerk's factory, who experiment and learn how in New England, for board and clothes, and then are promoted to make weather for countries that require a good article, and will take their custom elsewhere if they don't get it."&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', 23 December 1876, quoted in [http://www.twainquotes.com/18761223.html Twain Quotes]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[U. A. Fanthorpe]], in her poem "Special", refers to a class of children looking after a dog as 'Clerks of the Weather'.&lt;ref&gt;"Neck Verse", Peterloo Poets, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in the [[Comoros]] on 17 May 2009. The constitutional amendments were approved with 93.9% in favour, with a turnout of 51.8%.

==Background==
President [[Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi]] proposed extending his [[Term limit|term]] for two years in order to hold all elections simultaneously in 2011, as well as to reform the [[constitutional]] structure of the Comoros to save money. However, opposition parties and those from other islands were opposed to this, seeing it as a ploy to extend his term of office at the expense of the other two islands. Other constitutional amendments would make [[Islam]] the [[state religion]] and downgrade the status of the presidents of the constituent islands to governors, as well as allowing the president to dissolve the [[Assembly of the Union of the Comoros|Assembly of the Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=83144 COMOROS: Reforming 'the coup-coup islands'] IRIN, 25 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The referendum was originally scheduled for 22 March 2009, but was postponed due to disagreements over the content.

The '''Constitution of the Princely House of Liechtenstein''' of 26 October 1993 is the basic document that governs the [[House of Liechtenstein|Princely House]] of [[Liechtenstein]]. It was signed by the reigning prince [[Hans-Adam II, Prince of Liechtenstein]] and [[Markus Büchel]] [[Head of Government of Liechtenstein]]. This princely constitution however is not to be confused with the [[Constitution of Liechtenstein]] that was established in 1921. The document sets out things like Title of members of the Princely House, marriage, adoption, Succession to the throne and [[abdication]] and renunciation of the right to succeed to the throne. The document opens with a preamble stated below:

''For several centuries the Liechtenstein family has been governed by statutes. In parts the old provisions no longer met modern requirements. The family therefore decided on 26 October 1993 to repeal the previous statute and to adopt a new one in keeping with its traditions. These centuries-old family traditions include the Catholic faith, which shall also serve as a guiding principle in future decisions, whilst respecting the freedom of belief and conscience of the individual. We beseech God and the Mother of God to protect our family and our country in the future as they have done in the past.''

'''Coupe de France de robotique''' is a [[robotics]] competition held in [[La Roche-sur-Yon]] , [[France]], organized by [[Planète Sciences]].

== History ==
The Coupe de France de robotique (former "E = M6 Cup of robotics", from the Science TV show) is a competition coorganized since 2016 by the association Planète Sciences and the mixed economy company Oryon.

The French Robotics Cup was created in 1994, originally, in partnership with the company VM Productions, (producer until 2005 of the show E = M6), and the association [http://www.planete-sciences.org/national/ Planète Sciences]. The idea comes from Nicolas Goldzahl (then president of VM Productions) who was inspired by a creative class of Professor Woodie Flowers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-25|title=Woodie Flowers|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Woodie_Flowers&amp;oldid=832428062|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT). This course - called the "2.007"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-007-design-and-manufacturing-i-spring-2009/|title=Design and Manufacturing I|last=Daniel|first=Frey,|website=MIT OpenCourseWare|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; - was given to about 50 students and consisted of participating in a competition in which remote-controlled robots had to be built, two by two, with a different rule each year&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=MIT Mechanical Engineering|title=The Birth of a Hands-On Education|date=2015-12-02|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDbPwLODAx0|accessdate=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The goal is to develop students creativity. Nicolas Goldzahl, decided to adapt this idea in France, in two distinct categories: one with remote-controlled robots for college and high school students (Robotics Trophies), the other with autonomous robots for universities and engineering schools ( Robotics cup). To move from the idea to the realization, it was his meeting with the association Planet Science that was decisive. Planet Science wanted at that time to develop its robotics activity, Nicolas Goldzahl proposed to broadcast the event in the show E = M6 he was co-producing with Mac Lesggy. The first year, there were only fifteen participating teams (first location of the competition: Ecole Centrale Paris, now Central Supélec) but the media and the network of Planet Sciences contributed to its rapid development and very quickly this number exceeded the hundred teams from all over France.

The French Robotics Cup takes place every year and, until 2014, was part of the ARTEC festival in [[La Ferté-Bernard]]. In 2015, following the suspension of the organization of the ARTEC festival by the town of La Ferté-Bernard, the French Robotics Cup was looking for a new funding. In 2016 the competition found a new home in Vendée: [[La Roche-sur-Yon]].

'''DD Kisan''' is an [[India]]n [[agriculture]] 24-hour television channel, which is owned by [[Doordarshan]] and was launched on 26 May 2015. The channel has been dedicated to agriculture and related sectors, which disseminates real-time inputs to farmers on new farming techniques, water conservation and organic farming among other information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/DD-Kisan-set-for-launch-on-May-26/articleshow/47323145.cms|title=DD Kisan set for launch on May 26|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=18 May 2015|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-government-considers-launching-dd-kisan-on-modi-government-s-1st-anniversary-2087350|title=Government considers launching 'DD Kisan' on Modi government's 1st anniversary|newspaper=[[Daily News and Analysis]]|date=20 May 2015|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ahead of [[Indian general election, 2014]], the [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]] had declared that if they come in power they would try setting up a dedicated channel for Indian Farmers thus giving them an opportunity to watch program related to agriculture and farming 24X7. The public broadcaster Prasar Bharti which currently runs the ''[[Krishi Darshan]]'' program on Doordarshan is one of the longest running programmes on DD National. It was launched on 26 January 1967.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2649">The '''[[Rupee]]''' was the [[currency]] of [[U.K.|Britain's]] [[British East Africa|East Africa]]n colonies and protectorates between 1906 and 1920. It was divided into 100 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s.

The rupee replaced the [[Indian rupee]], which had previously circulated. In 1920, the rupee was revalued against [[Pound sterling|sterling]] to a peg of 1 rupee = 2 shillings (1 florin). In East Africa, this was followed in the same year by the replacement of the rupee with the [[East African florin]] at par.

The currency is noteworthy for including the world's first [[aluminium]] [[coin]], the 1907 1 Cent.

==Coins==

[[File:1cent BritishEastAfrica 1913.png|thumb|1 cent coin from 1913, cupro-nickel alloy]]

Silver coins were introduced for 25 and 50 Cents in 1906, followed by aluminium 1 Cent and cupro-nickel 10 Cents in 1907, aluminium ½ Cent in 1908 and cupro-nickel 5 Cents in 1913. Cupro-nickel replaced aluminium in 1909.

==Banknotes==

In 1906, notes (the first dated 1905) were introduced by the government of the East Africa Protectorate in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 40, 100 and 500 rupees. In 1920, the East African currency Board issued 1 rupee notes shortly before the rupee was replaced.

'''''Emoinu''''' or '''''Ebendhou Emoinu''''' or '''''Emoinu Ahongbi''''', is the [[Sanamahism]] goddess of wealth, prosperity and vital resources. Emoinu is worshipped by the [[Meitei people|Meitei]] people of [[Manipur]], northeastern India.

Emoinu is known for her sense of humor. Mostly she is portrayed as old woman as her name means great grandmother in [[Meiteilon]].

== Etymology ==
The name ''Emoinu'' stands for the goddess rearing the human beings. The first-word syllable ''E'' means human beings, ''moi'' meaning rearing and ''nu'' meaning Goddess.

''Ahongbi'' means giver of the household properties plentifully. ''Ebendhou'' meaning great-grandmother.

== Festival ==
''Emoinu Iraatpa'' is observed every 12th day of the [[Meitei people|Meitei]] lunar month, '''Waakching''' (Dec-Jan in gregorian calendar).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Observance of festival of Emoinu|url=http://www.e-pao.net/epSubPageExtractor.asp?src=manipur.Manipur_and_Religion.A_Hymn_for_Goddess_Emoinu|website=E-Pao|publisher=Nabakumar Salam}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this day, especially at night, Emoinu is offered what each can, particularly fish curries as dinner for Emoinu and a variety of cuisines in odd numbers.

== Abode ==
Emoinu's abode is at every kitchen of every household.

== Ritual ==
''Ebendhou Emoinu'' is offered from the first serving of every meal prepared in a Meitei household. The serving is made by placing three servings of the cooked rice on a plate that is set aside. These offerings should be only vegetarian foods or fish.

The household members are asked to maintain discipline, be respectful, and be tidy so as to please Emoinu.

'''James Edward Butler Futtit Farrington''' (originally called Butler; later known universally as Fram)&lt;ref&gt;Stemming from a schoolboy holiday to Framlington-on-Sea [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1410607/Fram-Farrington.html Daily Telegraph Obituary]&lt;/ref&gt; was a key member of a secret [[World War II|wartime]] [[Antarctic]] expeditionary force and the last surviving holder of the Polar Medal in Bronze, abolished after 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/polar-record/article/obituary/B9827BE875A1D87A85D59D6B0ACC588E|title=Obituary: James Edward Butler Futtit Farrington|first=Geoffrey|last=Hattersley-Smith|publisher=|journal=Polar Record|volume=39|issue=3|pages=270–271|accessdate=28 April 2018|via=Cambridge Core|doi=10.1017/S0032247403233192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Farrington was born in 1908, in Northern [[Ireland]]. He qualified as a marine radio operator in 1929 and joined the [[British Merchant Navy|Merchant Navy]] where he served for the next 6 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haddelsey |first=Stephen |title=Operation Tabarin : Britain's secret wartime expedition to Antarctica, 1944-46 |location=Stroud, UK |publisher=The History Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-75249-356-5|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First visits to Polar regions==
After serving on [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P &amp; O]] liners and cargo ships he began his Antarctic career as part of the Discovery Committee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soton.ac.uk/library/about/nol/noldiscoverybackgnd.html|title=University Library -  University of Southampton|website=www.soton.ac.uk|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; voyaging south to the coasts of [[Enderby Land]], [[Kemp Land]] and [[Mac. Robertson Land]]. Between 1937 and 1938, he served with future Operation Tabarin leader [[James Marr (biologist)|James Marr]] aboard [[RRS William Scoresby|HMS ''William Scoresby'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haddelsey |first=Stephen |title=Operation Tabarin : Britain's secret wartime expedition to Antarctica, 1944-46 |location=Stroud, UK |publisher=The History Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-75249-356-5|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his radio duties Farrington took charge of producing the ship's journal ''Pelagic News''. As a ship-based member Farringdon received the Bronze Polar Medal, a distinction which always rankled with him.&lt;ref&gt;It has, however, since been awarded to him after his death: Telegraph Obituary (ibid)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wartime Service==
After the outbreak of war, Farrington became an [[Air Ministry]] inspector based at [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] in Manchester, until he was summoned to London for secondment to [[Operation Tabarin]],&lt;ref&gt;a predecessor of the [[British Antarctic Survey]], launched to safeguard British interests south of the [[Falkland Islands]], where both the Argentine and Chilean governments asserted claims to sovereignty [http://www.falklands.gov.fk/pb/fi/World War II-60.htm Further explanation]&lt;/ref&gt; under the overall command of Lt-Cdr [[James William Slessor Marr|James Marr]]. Based on [[Deception Island]], in the [[South Shetlands]], Farrington had expected to spend the winter of 1945–46 at [[Hope Bay]], but his sense of duty made him exchange places with a less experienced radio operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctic-circle.org/obitsPR.htm|title=ObituariesPR|website=www.antarctic-circle.org|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, technically, he never wintered on the Antarctic mainland, with the result that he was not awarded the Silver [[Polar Medal]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antarctic.ac.uk/about_bas/publications/bas_history.rtf. Explanation of ruling]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post war==
On his return from the Antarctic in 1946, Farrington became a scientific officer with the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment]] at [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]], moving two years later to the new electronics division at the [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]], [[Harwell, Oxfordshire|Harwell]]. He retired in 1975 and returned to Northern Ireland in 1989, where he died on 4 October 2002, survived by his wife and son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haddelsey |first=Stephen |title=Operation Tabarin : Britain's secret wartime expedition to Antarctica, 1944-46 |location=Stroud, UK |publisher=The History Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-75249-356-5|pages=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post of '''Governor of Vatican City''' ('''''Governatore dello Stato della Città del Vaticano''''' in [[Italian language|Italian]]) was held by Marchese [[Camillo Serafini]] from the foundation of the state in 1929 until his death in 1952. No successor was appointed, and the post itself was not mentioned in the [[Fundamental Law of Vatican City State]] issued by [[Pope John Paul II]] on 26 November 2000, which entered into force on 22 February 2001.

Even during the lifetime of Marchese Serafini, the powers of the Governor were limited by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1939 by the establishment of the [[Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]]—consisting of a number of cardinals, originally three, but later increased to seven. The [[President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State|President of this Commission]] has exercised since 1952 the functions that were previously attributed to the Governor. Since 2001, he is also given the title of President of the [[Governorate of the State of Vatican City]].

'''Hall of Femmes''' is a project, based in [[Sweden]], aiming to highlight the work of women in [[art direction]] and [[design]]. The designers Samira Bouabana and Angela Tillman Sperandio founded the project in 2009 and the intention was to revise the design history by talking about and paying tribute to the women who were involved in it. The business includes the Hall of Femmes book series where eight female pioneers in [[graphic design]] are portrayed. The project also includes [[seminars]], [[Film screening|screenings]], talks, [[exhibition]]s and [[podcast]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://halloffemmes.com/about/|title=Hall of Femmes - About |publisher=Hall of Femmes |date=2010-10-16 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hall of Femmes also wants to inspire to a more equal industry and contribute to the future of the design scene. The business is widely established both in Sweden and internationally, and has been written up in magazines like [[the New York Times Magazine]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2010/06/25/fashion/20100627-pulse-slideshow-4.html?_r=0|title=New York Times Magazine on Hall of Femmes |publisher=New York Times Magazine|date=2010-06-25 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Creative Review]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.halloffemmes.com/2013/04/CR.pdf|title=Creative Review on Hall of Femmes |publisher=Hall of Femmes |date=2013-04-01 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2010/06/art-director-ruth-ansel-slide-show-201006#/slide=16|title=Vanity Fair on Hall of Femmes|publisher=Vanity Fair|date=2010-06-18 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013 Hall of Femmes organized Design Talks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernamuseet.se/en/Stockholm/Programme/Past-programme/2013/Hall-of-Femmes-Design-Talks/|title=Museum of Modern Art on Design Talks|publisher=The Museum of Modern Art, Stockholm|date=2013-05-01|accessdate=2014-03-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413141731/http://www.modernamuseet.se/en/Stockholm/Programme/Past-programme/2013/Hall-of-Femmes-Design-Talks/|archivedate=2014-04-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a two-day conference at the Museum of Modern Art in Stockholm, where top names in the world of design, fashion, art, communication and architecture were invited to talk. Amongst the international speakers were [[Ruth Ansel]], [[Barbara Kruger]], [[Janet Froelich]] and [[Cindy Gallop]].

In 2013, Hall of Femmes received the Bengt Hanser Award, presented by the Swedish Association of Communication Agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.komm.se/fakta2/bengt-hanser-stipendiet|title=Komm on the Bengt Hanser Award|publisher=Komm|date=2013-05-01 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intelsat IV F-8''' was a [[geostationary]] [[communication]] [[satellite]] built by [[Hughes Aircraft Company|Hughes]], it was owned by [[Intelsat]]. The satellite was based on the [[Spacebus|HS-312]] platform and its estimated useful life was 7 years.

== History ==
The Intelsat IV F-8 was part of the Intelsat IV series which consisted of eight communications satellites, launched from [[Cape Canaveral]] during the early 1970s, marked the fifth generation of geostationary communications satellites developed by the [[Hughes Aircraft Company]] since 1963 with the launch of Syncom II, the world's first synchronous satellite. The [[Syncom]] II was 15&amp;nbsp;cm high and 28 inches in diameter, weighing 78 pounds in orbit. In contrast, the Intelsat IVs weighed more than [[Pound (mass)|£]] 1,300 (595&amp;nbsp;kg) into orbit and were more than 17 feet (5.31 meters) in [[diameter]]. All seven satellites exceeded their projected life expectancies and were withdrawn from active duty, the last of which, the [[Intelsat IV F-1]] was retired in October 1987.

The satellite was equipped with 12 [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] transponders. It had 6,000 two-way [[relay]] phone calls or broadcast 12 concurrent color television programs or mixed combinations of communications traffic including data and fax.

The satellite had 12 channels of broadband communication. Each channel had a bandwidth of 40&amp;nbsp;MHz and provided about 500 communication circuits.

== Release ==
The satellite was successfully launched into space on November 21, 1974, at 23:43 UTC, by means of an [[Atlas-Centaur]] vehicle from the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] in [[Florida]], [[United States]]. It had a launch mass of 1,414&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, Gunter. [http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/intelsat-4a.htm Intelsat-4A]. ''Gunter's Space Page''. Retrieved 22 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the [[United Nations]] commissioned an investigation on past human rights violations in Somalia,&lt;ref name="Mburu" /&gt; specifically to find out if "crimes of international jurisdiction (i.e. war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide) had been perpetrated during the country's civil war". The investigation was commissioned jointly by the [[United Nations]] Co-ordination Unit (UNCU) and the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]]. The investigation concluded with a report confirming the crime of genocide to have taken place against the Isaaqs in Somalia. United Nations investigator, Chris Mburu, stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;Based on the totality of evidence collected in Somaliland and elsewhere both during and after his mission, the consultant firmly believes that the crime of genocide was conceived, planned and perpetrated by the Somali Government against the Isaaq people of northern Somalia between 1987 and 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7w8VAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Based+on+the+totality+of+evidence+collected+in+Somaliland%22&amp;dq=%22Based+on+the+totality+of+evidence+collected+in+Somaliland%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiR_vOU_b_TAhVpCMAKHUm3CiUQ6AEIJTAA |title=Past human rights abuses in Somalia: report of a preliminary study conducted for the United Nations (OHCHR/UNDP-Somalia) |last=Mburu |first=Chris |last2=Rights |first2=United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human |last3=Office |first3=United Nations Development Programme Somalia Country |date=2002-01-01 |publisher=s.n. |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Background ==

=== Postcolonial era ===
The first Somali state to be granted its independence from colonial powers was [[British Somaliland|Somaliland]], a former British protectorate that gained independence on 26 June 1960. The rest of what came to be known as [[Somali Republic]] was under Italian rule under the title [[Trust Territory of Somaliland]] (also known as ''Somalia Italiana''). Shortly after [[Somaliland]] gained independence, it was to form a hasty union with its southern neighbour to create the Somali Republic. Henceforth British Somaliland was referred to as the northern (or north western) region of the Somali Republic, whilst the former Italian colonial state was referred to as the south.

Within British Somaliland the Isaaq constituted the majority group within the protectorate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IfgxAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2 |title=Consider Somaliland: State-Building with Traditional Leaders and Institutions |last=Renders |first=Marleen |date=20 January 2012 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9789004222540 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Dir (clan)|Dir]] and Harti groups also having sizeable populations to the west and east of Isaaq respectively.

The union of the two states proved problematic early on when in a referendum held on 20 June 1961 to approve the provisional constitution that would govern the two ex-colonial territories was rejected by half of the population in the [[Somaliland]] (the north-west of nascent Somali Republic), the major cities of the former British protectorate voted against the ratification of the constitution – Hargeisa (72%), Berbera (69%), Burao (66%) and Erigavo (69%) – all returned negative votes.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lEx6HIaaGfcC&amp;pg=PA78 |title=Crisis Management and the Politics of Reconciliation in Somalia: Statements from the Uppsala Forum, 17-19 January 1994 |last=Salih |first=Mohamed Abdel Rahim Mohamed |last2=Wohlgemuth |first2=Lennart |date=1 January 1994 |publisher=Nordic Africa Institute |isbn=9789171063564 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in contrast to the south (ex-Italian colony) which returned a strong support for the constitution (and four times the expected vote numbers in the south, indicating electoral fraud, an example of this is a small southern village called Wanla Weyn registered a yes vote higher than the 100,000 votes counted in all of the north),&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iF8wAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=wanla+weyn&amp;dq=wanla+weyn&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKl5e9te_RAhXJAcAKHfczBX04ChDoAQgiMAI |title=Somalia calling: the crisis of statehood, and the quest for peace |last=Abraham |first=Knife |date=1 January 2002 |publisher=Ethiopian International Institute for Peace and Development |isbn=9789163119835 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was major signal of discontent coming from the north only a year after forming the union.

=== Social, political and economic marginalisation ===
The northern dissatisfaction with the constitution and terms of unification was a subject that the successive civilian governments continued to ignore.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; The northerns, especially the majority Isaaq, believed that the unified state would be divided federally (north and south) and that they would receive a fair share of representation post unification.

== Prelude ==

=== Ethio-Somali War ===
{{Main|Ogaden War}}

Successive Somali governments had continually supported the cause of [[Greater Somalia|Somali irredentism]] and the concept of 'Greater Somalia', a powerful sentiment many Somalis carried, as a core goal of the state. This particularly had strong support from the Isaaq clan who notably sent many volunteers, especially in 1976 as they joined WSLF guerrilla insurgencies and sent many volunteers a year before the war took place. Another factor behind the strong support from the Isaaq was the fact that the border that was drawn between Ethiopia and Somalia cut off important grazing grounds for Isaaq tribesmen. Barre along with the [[Supreme Revolutionary Council (Somalia)|Supreme Revolutionary Council]], to entrench their rule and in an attempt to regain the [[Somali Region]] of [[Ethiopia]], launched a war against Ethiopia in 1977, this war was referred to in Somalia as 'The War for Western Somalia'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vzi6CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA312 |title=The Suicidal State in Somalia: The Rise and Fall of the Siad Barre Regime, 1969–1991 |last=Ingiriis |first=Mohamed Haji |date=1 April 2016 |publisher=UPA |isbn=978-0-7618-6720-3 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union, which at the time was allied to both Somalia and Ethiopia turned against Barre,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hal_DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA231 |title=Africa 2016–2017 |last=Wiafe-Amoako |first=Francis |date=28 July 2016 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=978-1-4758-2903-7 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (with their allies) provided enough support to the Ethiopian army to defeat the Somali forces and force a withdrawal from the Somali region of Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=08OV704armMC&amp;pg=PA1405&amp;dq=ogaden+defeat+barre+1977&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_6JjknvLRAhWqCsAKHaIBByEQ6AEIJDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=ogaden%20defeat%20barre%201977&amp;f=false |title=Encyclopedia of the Developing World |last=Leonard |first=Thomas M. |date=1 January 2006 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-415-97664-0 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Displacement of Isaaq and arming of refugees ===
All of Somalia felt the impact of the Ogaden War defeat, however the northern region (where Isaaqs live) experienced the majority of the physical and human destruction due to its geographical proximity to the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vz6gCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90 |title=Understanding Statebuilding: Traditional Governance and the Modern State in Somaliland |last=Richards |first=Rebecca |date=24 February 2016 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-00466-0 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somalia's defeat in the [[Ethio-Somali War]] caused an influx of Ethiopian refugees (mostly ethnic Somalis and some [[Oromo people|Oromo]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ahHabajshuwC&amp;pg=PA123 |title=State Collapse and Post-conflict Development in Africa: The Case of Somalia (1960–2001) |last=Mohamoud |first=Abdullah A. |date=1 January 2006 |publisher=Purdue University Press |isbn=978-1-55753-413-2 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; across the border to Somalia. By 1979, official figures reported 1.3&amp;nbsp;million refugees in Somalia, more than half of them were settled in Isaaq lands in the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hal_DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA231 |title=Africa 2016–2017 |last=Wiafe-Amoako |first=Francis |date=28 July 2016 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=978-1-4758-2903-7 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has caused great deal of burden on both the local Isaaqs and state apparatus, especially coming off a costly war with Ethiopia, Somali studies scholar I. M. Lewis noted that "the stark fact remained that the economy of the country simply did not possess the resources to absorb so many uprooted people."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=idcVAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=understanding+somalia+and+somaliland:+culture,+history,+society&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=the+stark+fact+remained+that+the+economy+of+the+country+simply+ |title=Understanding Somalia and Somaliland: Culture, History, Society |last=Lewis |first=I.

The presence of such a large number of refugees, especially when Somalia's total population at the time was 4.1&amp;nbsp;million (UN estimates&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uNxGlBCEHHMC&amp;pg=PA164 |title=Generating Employment and Incomes in Somalia: Report of an Inter-disciplinary Employment and Project-identification Mission to Somalia Financed by the United Nations Development Programme and Executed by ILO/JASPA. |date=1 January 1989 |publisher=International Labour Organization |isbn=9789221060574 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) meant that virtually one out of every four people in Somalia was a refugee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DRAOAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Understanding+Somalia+and+Somaliland:+Culture,+History,+Society&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=one+in+four+people |title=Understanding Somalia and Somaliland: Culture, History, Society |last=Lewis |first=I.

Instead refugees, registered with UNHCR were given jobs in the offices dealing with refugee matters."&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HT7FBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=%22government+offices+dealing+with+refugee+affairs,+so+that+%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ozHrQm_tnK&amp;sig=ONXNGrbsS4TR-nrBBwCnfvrbMhg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE_pivxPLRAhVIxxQKHeIjCssQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22government%20offices%20dealing%20with%20refugee%20affairs,%20so%20that%20%22&amp;f=false |title=The New Pirates: Modern Global Piracy from Somalia to the South China Sea |last=Palmer |first=Andrew |date=2014-08-15 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=978-0-85773-493-8 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;As the state became increasingly reliant on international aid, aid resources allocated for the refugees caused further resentment from the local Isaaq residents, especially as they felt no effort was made on the government's part to compensate them for bearing the burden of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vz6gCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90 |title=Understanding Statebuilding: Traditional Governance and the Modern State in Somaliland |last=Richards |first=Rebecca |date=24 February 2016 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-00466-0 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Barre heavily favoured the Ogaden refugees, who belonged to the same clan ([[Darod]]) as him. Due to these ties, the Ogaden refugees enjoyed preferential access to "social services, business licenses and even government posts."&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vz6gCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90 |title=Understanding Statebuilding: Traditional Governance and the Modern State in Somaliland |last=Richards |first=Rebecca |date=24 February 2016 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-00466-0 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As expressed animosity and discontent in the north grew, Barre armed the Ogaden refugees, and in doing so created an irregular army operating inside Isaaq territories, the regime's use of armed refugees against local Isaaq populations in the north is also referenced in an Africa Watch report: &lt;blockquote&gt;"[M]any Ogadeni refugees were recruited into the [[Western Somali Liberation Front|WSLF]]. The WSLF was ostensibly being trained to fight Ethiopia to regain the Ogaden [Western Somalia], but, in fact, terrorized the Isaak [Isaaq] civilian population living in the border region, which came to fear them more than the Ethiopian army. Killings, rape and looting became common."&lt;ref name="Palmer" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Barre was essentially ensuring the loyalty of the Ogaden refugees through continued preferential treatment and protection at the expense of the local Isaaq who were not only bypassed for economic, social and political advancement but also forcefully suppressed by both the Somali Armed Forces and the Ogaden refugee militias.&lt;ref name="Richards" /&gt;

The settlement of Ogaden refugees in Isaaq territory, and the arming of these groups (which effectively created a foreign army in the north&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DZJPm2j2iz4C&amp;pg=PA41 |title=What are Somalia's Development Perspectives?: Science Between Resignation and Hope? : Proceedings of the 6th SSIA Congress, Berlin 6-9 December 1996 |last=Janzen |first=Jörg |last2=Vitzthum |first2=Stella von |date=1 January 2001 |publisher=Verlag Hans Schiler |isbn=978-3-86093-230-8 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;), further antagonised local Isaaq population. The armed Ogaden refugees, together with members of the Marehan and Dhulbahanta soldiers (whom were provoked and encouraged by the Barre regime) started a campaign of terror against the local Isaaqs&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DZJPm2j2iz4C&amp;pg=PA41 |title=What are Somalia's Development Perspectives?: Science Between Resignation and Hope? : Proceedings of the 6th SSIA Congress, Berlin 6-9 December 1996 |last=Janzen |first=Jörg |last2=Vitzthum |first2=Stella von |date=1 January 2001 |publisher=Verlag Hans Schiler |isbn=978-3-86093-230-8 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they raped women, murdered unarmed civilians, and prevented families from conducting proper burials. Barre ignored Isaaq complaints throughout the 1980s,&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; this along with Barre's repression of criticism or discussions of the widespread atrocities in the north&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; had the effect of turning the long-standing Isaaq disaffection into open opposition.

==== Creation of refugee Ogaden militia ====
The government started a program of creating paramilitary groups among the Ogaden refugees as well as conscripting them into the national army, it also encouraged the creation of armed militia groups among members of the Darod (the clan of Siad Barre).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/sites/default/files/file%20uploads%20/africa_watch_somalia_a_government_at_war_with_ibook4you.pdf |title=Somalia: A Government at War with Its Own People |last= |first= |publisher=Human Rights Watch |year=1990 |isbn= |location= |pages=31 |quote= |via= |access-date=16 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217070406/http://www.sahistory.org.za/sites/default/files/file%20uploads%20/africa_watch_somalia_a_government_at_war_with_ibook4you.pdf |archive-date=17 February 2017 |dead-url=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Somali Army managed the training of both groups, and costs incurred including any expenditure for their arms and equipment, radio communications and fuel came from the army's budget.

One of the militias formed by the Ogaden refugees was the [[Western Somali Liberation Front|WSLF]], officially created to fight Ethiopia and "reclaim ethnic Somali territory" in Ethiopia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qrWDDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aIJWzKRJIR&amp;sig=9a6WSxjX317FmqcIl7MDND2gSNw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiVz4X9-JTSAhVFOhQKHUXBAVEQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=reclaim%20ethnic%20Somali%20territory&amp;f=false |title=Globalization, Self-Determination and Violent Conflict |last=FitzGerald |first=V. |last2=Stewart |first2=F. |last3=Venugopal |first3=R. |date=5 May 2006 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-230-50237-6 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was used primarily against local Isaaq civilians and nomads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qrWDDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aIJWzKRJIR&amp;sig=9a6WSxjX317FmqcIl7MDND2gSNw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiVz4X9-JTSAhVFOhQKHUXBAVEQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=barre%20armed%20ogadeeni%20refugees%20fight%20isaaq&amp;f=false |title=Globalization, Self-Determination and Violent Conflict |last=FitzGerald |first=V. |last2=Stewart |first2=F. |last3=Venugopal |first3=R. |date=5 May 2006 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-230-50237-6 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Human Rights Watch]]'s Africa Watch report states "The WSLF was ostensibly being trained to fight Ethiopia to regain the Ogaden, but, in fact, terrorized the Isaak civilian population living in the border region, which came to fear them more than the Ethiopian army. Killing, rape and looting became common."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As the WSLF, supported by the Barre regime, continued to attack and commit atrocities against the Isaaq, a delegation was sent to meet President Barre in 1979 to request making a stop to WSLF abuses. In spite of promises made to the Isaaq elders the violence against civilians and nomads by WSLF continued.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The continued abuse of WSLF and the government's indifference to the suffering of Isaaq civilians and nomads prompted many Isaaq army officers to desert the army with a view to creating their own armed movement to fight Ethiopia, one that would also intimidate the WSLF and discourage further violence against Isaaq civilians.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their new movement, supported and financed by Isaaqs,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; was named ''Afraad'' (the fourth unit) and became operational in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RcVFXUwraxsC&amp;pg=PA95 |title=Evil Days: Thirty Years of War and Famine in Ethiopia |last=Waal |first=Alexander De |last2=(Organization) |first2=Human Rights Watch |date=1 January 1991 |publisher=Human Rights Watch |isbn=978-1-56432-038-4 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z9x3HB7M5LgC&amp;pg=PA123 |title=Land ohne Staat: Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft im Krieg am Beispiel Somalias |last=Bakonyi |first=Jutta |date=16 February 2017 |publisher=Campus Verlag |isbn=978-3-593-39528-9 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Isaaq movement of Afraad immediately came into conflict with the Ogaden clan's faction of WSLF in the form of a number of bloody encounters between the two groups. Afraad's objective was to push the WSLF out of their strongholds (Isaaq territory) whereas the WSLF responded by retaliating further against Isaaq civilians living in the border region.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The situation was further exacerbated by the appointment of Mohamed Hashi Gani, a cousin of President Siad Barre and fellow [[Marehan]] [[Darod]], as the military commander of the northern regions with headquarters in Hargeisa in 1980.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DPwOsOcNy5YC&amp;pg=PA99 |title=Historical Dictionary of Somalia |last=Mukhtar |first=Mohamed Haji |date=25 February 2003 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0-8108-6604-1 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gani's rule was especially harsh against Isaaq, he removed them from all key economic positions, seized their properties and placed the northern regions under emergency laws.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He also ordered the transfer of Afraad away from the border region, giving the WSLF complete control of the border region, thus leaving Isaaq nomads in the area without any protection against WSLF violence.

A [[United Nations]] inspection team that visited the area in 1988 reported that the Ethiopian refugees (Ogaden) were carrying weapons supplied by the Somali Army.

By early 1978 the Barre regime had full control of the Somali state's economic apparatus, including large amounts of foreign aid which were deployed "using selective redistribution to ensure loyalty to the regime."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vz6gCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90 |title=Understanding Statebuilding: Traditional Governance and the Modern State in Somaliland |last=Richards |first=Rebecca |date=24 February 2016 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-00466-0 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Barre regime's oppressive policies against the Isaaq continued when in 1981, the Barre regime declared economic warfare on Somalis from the northwest and specifically the Isaaq.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PBvfTmzsZ-0C&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=declared+economic+warfare+on+somalis+from+the+northwestern&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gnZjvBN3U7&amp;sig=fpCzxequi-kh0_j9lEMlEkQ_ER8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje28T_k_7RAhXmBsAKHRN2CVkQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=declared%20economic%20warfare%20on%20somalis%20from%20the%20northwestern&amp;f=false |title=Clan Cleansing in Somalia: The Ruinous Legacy of 1991 |last=Kapteijns |first=Lidwien |date=18 December 2012 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=0-8122-0758-0 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a major cause of the eventual fall of the Barre regime in 1991.

Initially, the aim of the various groups that merged to create the SNM was not to create an armed liberation front, but rather these groups formed as a direct response to the harsh policies enacted by the Barre regime against the Isaaqs.&lt;ref name="books.google.com" /&gt; However, the official position changed following the meeting of the newly formed SNM Congress in October 1981 to one of liberation 'with the expressed aim of ridding Somalia of Barre and instituting a democratic government in Somalia that would be inclusive of and based on the clan system."&lt;ref name="books.google.com" /&gt; Ideologically, the SNM was a Western-leaning movement and was described as "one of the most democratic movements in the Horn of Africa."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=26QaAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=&amp;dq=%22one+of+the+most+democratic+movements+in+the+Horn+of+Africa%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjU4-3u1YDSAhULIsAKHTTAALYQ6AEIHjAB |title=Somalia: the case for action : hearing before the Select Committee on Hunger, House of Representatives, One Hundred Second Congress, second session, hearing held in Washington, DC, July 22, 1992 |last=Hunger |first=United States Congress House Select Committee on |date=1 January 1992 |publisher=U.S. G.P.O. |isbn=978-0-16-039742-4 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Human Rights Watch]] testimony before the [[United States Congress]]' Africa Subcommittee on 14 July 1988 stated that the actions of the Barre government have "created a level of violence unprecedented in scope and duration in Somalia".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The testimony of [[Aryeh Neier]] (co-founder of [[Human Rights Watch|HRW]]) explains the context in which the SNM was formed:&lt;blockquote&gt;Since 1981, with the formation of the SNM, northern Somalia has seen the worst atrocities. Serious human right violations, including extra-judicial executions of unarmed civilians, detentions without trial, unfair trials, torture, rape, looting and extortion, have been a prominent feature of life in the towns and countryside in the northern region since 1981. In order to deprive the SNM of a civilian base of support in their area of operation, those living in rural areas between Hargeisa and the Ethiopian border have suffered particularly brutal treatment. A scorched earth policy that involved the burning of farms, the killing of livestock, the destruction of water-storage tanks and the deliberate poisoning of wells, has been pursued actively by the military. The principal towns have been subjected to a curfew for several years; arbitrary restrictions on the extension of the curfew have facilitated extortion by soldiers and curfew patrols. Internal travel is controlled through military checkpoints .... The existence of the SNM has provided a pretext for President Barre and his military deputies in the north to wage a war against peaceful citizens and to enable them to consolidate their control of the country by terrorizing anyone who is suspected of not being wholeheartedly pro-government. Years of sustained state violence have created a serious level of political unrest in the region. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The atmosphere of lawlessness has enabled soldiers to harass civilians for the purposes of extortion. Many Somalis have reported that military and security officers only respond to inquiries by detainees' relatives with promises to secure their release in exchange for cash payments. Civilians living in [[Burao|Buroa]] and [[Hargeisa]] have frequently been forbidden to hold funerals for relatives shot dead by the military and curfew patrols until they have paid a ransom. Rape, of young and older women, is routine. They will only be released from detention centers, even after being raped, if the family pays a ransom. No soldier or member of the security forces has ever been disciplined or prosecuted for abuses, which highlights the general lack of accountability.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uJZWboQa6B0C&amp;q=%22Since+1981,+with+the+formation+of+the+SNM,+northern+Somalia%22&amp;dq=%22Since+1981,+with+the+formation+of+the+SNM,+northern+Somalia%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjR1ZDC-J7TAhWIDsAKHbJyANwQ6AEIIzAA |title=Reported Massacres and Indiscriminate Killings in Somalia: Hearing Before the Subcommittee on Africa of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, House of Representatives, One Hundredth Congress, Second Session, July 14, 1988 |last=Africa |first=United States Congress House Committee on Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on |date=1989-01-01 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;By 1982 the SNM transferred their headquarters to [[Dire Dawa]] in Ethiopia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IXdqkSH4S7EC&amp;pg=PA25 |title=Somalia: Issues, History, and Bibliography |last=Fitzgerald |first=Nina J. |date=1 January 2002 |publisher=Nova Publishers |isbn=978-1-59033-265-8 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; as both Somalia and Ethiopia at the time offered safe havens of operation for resistance groups against each other.

A report by Africa Watch stated that the policy was "the outcome of a specific conception of how the war against the insurgents should be fought," with the logic being to "punish civilians for their presumed support for the SNM attacks and to discourage them from further assistance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mKWiBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT149&amp;lpg=PT149&amp;dq=&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mLvJdMXRkn&amp;sig=GlK10uEGjIoIOX-F5dDbqv9M2E0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXkd_904DSAhUI0GMKHUjVDQ8Q6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=punish%20civilians%20for%20their%20presumed%20support%20for%20the%20SNM&amp;f=false |title=Making and Unmaking Nations: The Origins and Dynamics of Genocide in Contemporary Africa |last=Straus |first=Scott |date=24 March 2015 |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=978-0-8014-5567-4 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to state-sponsored violence, other means of crushing the Isaaq uprising included the government's continuation of its policy of political repression and harsh economic measures, this included withholding international food aid donations to the Isaaq.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BpGXBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA277 |title=Encyclopedia of Conflicts Since World War II |last=Ciment |first=James |date=20 March 2015 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-47186-8 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was especially harsh as food aid accounted for nearly half of all food consumption in Somalia in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nB51_Jfd1QgC&amp;pg=PA50 |title=People and the Earth: Basic Issues in the Sustainability of Resources and Environment |last=Rogers |first=John James William |last2=Feiss |first2=P.

He continued: "Today, we possess the right remedy for the virus in the [body of the] Somali State." Some of the "remedies" he discussed included: "Balancing the well-to-do to eliminate the concentration of wealth [in the hands of Isaaq]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7w8VAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Balancing+the+well-to-do+to+eliminate+the+concentration+of+wealth%22&amp;dq=%22Balancing+the+well-to-do+to+eliminate+the+concentration+of+wealth%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSp8Hd6IXSAhWhAcAKHaNeD1MQ6AEIJjAD |title=Past human rights abuses in Somalia: report of a preliminary study conducted for the United Nations (OHCHR/UNDP-Somalia) |last=Mburu |first=Chris |last2=Rights |first2=United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human |last3=Office |first3=United Nations Development Programme Somalia Country |date=1 January 2002 |publisher=s.n. |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he called for "the reconstruction of the Local Council [in Isaaq settlements] in such a way as to balance its present membership which is exclusively from a particular people [the Isaaq]; as well as the dilution of the school population with an infusion of [Ogaden] children from the Refugee Camps in the vicinity of Hargeisa".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7w8VAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22dilution+of+the+school+population+with+an+infusion+of+children%22&amp;dq=%22dilution+of+the+school+population+with+an+infusion+of+children%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y |title=Past human rights abuses in Somalia: report of a preliminary study conducted for the United Nations (OHCHR/UNDP-Somalia) |last=Mburu |first=Chris |last2=Rights |first2=United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human |last3=Office |first3=United Nations Development Programme Somalia Country |date=1 January 2002 |publisher=s.n. |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More extreme recommendations included: "Rendering uninhabitable the territory between the army and the enemy, which can be done by destroying the water tanks and the villages lying across the territory used by them for infiltration"; and "removing from the membership of the armed forces and civil service all those who are open to suspicion of aiding the enemy – especially those holding sensitive posts".&lt;ref name="Robins" /&gt;

In discussing the unusually frank tone of the report, Hassan Abdi Madar states:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The report is addressed to the President of the SDR, the Minister of Defence, and Minister of Interior. The latter, Major-General Ahmed Suleiman Abdalla is also a son-in-law of the President, and Third Deputy Prime Minister. Since President Barre is also the Minister of Defence -- the previous holder of that portfolio, General [[Mohammad Ali Samatar]], having been promoted Prime Minister on January 30, 1987 -- the report is seemingly confined to family members.

This was intended to strengthen their unity and to surround Somali unity with a defensive wall.  Among those inhabitants are: the Awdal people, the various sections of Western Somalis [including Ogaden refugees], the Las Qorey people, and the Daami people, etc. There is no doubt that the unity of these people will restore the balance of the scales which are now tipped in favour of the Isaaq.

=== Extrajudicial executions ===
[[File:Dead bodies of Hargeisa victims, June 1988.jpg|thumb|Victims of extrajudicial execution by government soldiers left in a [[Hargeisa]] street, June 1988, Amnesty International]]
The system of indiscriminate killings employed by the government following SNM offensives had a galvanising effect on opposition to the government among both Isaaq nomads and city-dwellers.&lt;ref name="OwnPeople"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Somalia: A Government at War With Its Own People |last= |first= |publisher=Human Rights Watch's Africa Watch |year=1990 |isbn= |location=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/somalia_1990.pdf |pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The military was operating under the assumption that if the SNM was active in a particular area, local residents must be supporters of the rebels. According to [[Human Rights Watch]]'s Africa Watch, hundreds of Isaaqs have been executed and subjected to other reprisals on the basis of such suspicions.

These killing started after the SNM escalated its incursions into the Isaaq majority cities in the north.&lt;ref name="OwnPeople" /&gt; On every encounter between the SNM and government forces, "the army would conduct a sweep of the area where the incident occurred. Massacres followed, as did the killing of livestock, the use of landmines to blow up reservoirs, the burning of huts, arrests and detentions. The entire population in the area was regarded as 'the enemy'."

The following are a selection of the numerous episodes of extrajudicial executions of Isaaq civilians collected by [[Human Rights Watch]]'s Africa Watch:

During the ongoing conflict between the forces of the [[Somali National Movement]] and the [[Somali Army]], the Somali government's genocidal campaign against the [[Isaaq]] took place between May 1988 and March 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Strategic Survey, 1989–1990 (1990), p.87, International Institute for Strategic Studies&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Alex de Waal]], Jens Meierhenrich and Bridget Conley-Zilkic:

{{Quote|text=What began as a counterinsurgency against the Somali National Movement rebels and their sympathizers, and escalated into genocidal onslaught against the Isaaq clan family, turned into the disintegration of both government and rebellion and the replacement of institutionalized armed forces with fragmented clan-based militia. The genocidal campaign ended in anarchy, and the state collapse that followed bred further genocidal campaigns by some of the militia groups that then seized power at a local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Alex |last1=de Waal |first2=Jens |last2=Meierhenrich |first3=Bridget |last3=Conley-Zilkic |title=How Mass Atrocities End: An Evidence-Based Counter-Narrative |journal=Fetcher Forum of World Affairs |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=15–31 |year=2012 |url=http://www.fletcherforum.org/home/2016/9/14/how-mass-atrocities-end-an-evidence-based-counter-narrative}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1987, [[Siad Barre]], the president of [[Somalia]], frustrated by lack of success of the army against insurgents from the [[Somali National Movement]] in the north of country, offered the Ethiopian government a deal in which they stop sheltering and giving support to the SNM in return for Somalia giving up its territorial claim over Ethiopia's [[Somali Region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YbzsBPuhyggC&amp;q=%22in%20return%20for%20depriving%20the%20snm%20of%20its%22&amp;f=false#v=snippet&amp;q=%22in%20return%20for%20depriving%20the%20snm%20of%20its%22&amp;f=false |title=The Cambridge Survey of World Migration |last=Cohen |first=Robin |date=2 November 1995 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-44405-7 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethiopia was in agreement and a deal was signed on 3 April 1988 that included a clause confirming agreement not to assist rebel organisations based in each other's territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O3jqDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA717 |title=After The Storm: The Changing Military Balance in the Middle East |last=Cordesman |first=Anthony H. |date=6 October 2016 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-4742-9257-3 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SNM felt the pressure to cease their activities on the Ethiopia-Somalia border, and decided to attack the northern territories of Somalia to take control of the major cities in the north. The brutal nature of the Siad Barre government response was unprecedented, and led to what [[Robin Cohen]] described as one of the "worst civil wars in Africa".&lt;ref name="a"&gt;Cohen, p.444&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:4z2.jpg|left|thumb|Up to 90% of Hargeisa (2nd largest city of the Somali Republic) was destroyed.]]
Barre's response to the SNM attacks was of unparalleled brutality, with explicit aims of handling the "Isaaq problem", he ordered "the shelling and aerial bombardment of the major cities in the northwest and the systematic destruction of Isaaq dwellings, settlements and water points."&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; The [[Siad Barre]] regime targeted civilian members of the Isaaq group specifically,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/02/investigating-genocide-somaliland-20142310820367509.html |title=Investigating genocide in Somaliland |last=Reinl |first=James |publisher=Al Jazeera |access-date=25 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507223827/http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/02/investigating-genocide-somaliland-20142310820367509.html |archive-date=7 May 2017 |dead-url=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in the cities of [[Hargeisa]] and [[Burco]] and to that end employed the use of indiscriminate [[artillery shell]]ing and [[Aerial bombing of cities|aerial bombardment]] against civilian populations belonging to the Isaaq clan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IXdqkSH4S7EC&amp;pg=PA57 |title=Somalia: Issues, History, and Bibliography |last=Fitzgerald |first=Nina J. |date=1 January 2002 |publisher=Nova Publishers |isbn=978-1-59033-265-8 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geldenhuys, p.131&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruce Jentleson]], former director of the [[Sanford School of Public Policy]] describes the massacre of Isaaq civilians as follows:{{Quote|text=Government forces responded with "appalling savagery", targeting the entire Isaaq civilian population with arrests, rape, mass executions, and insdiscriminant shooting and bombing, Hundreds of thousands of Isaaq refugees fled for their lives across the Ethiopian border; government warplanes strafed them as they fled.

The brutal response of the [[Siad Barre]] government did not stop there, in discussing the systematic way in which the government targeted Isaaq people with aim to inflict as much loss in property and life, Waldron and Hasci published the following account:{{Quote|text=General Mohammed Said 'Morgan', one of Siad Barre's sons-in-law, [was given] the opportunity to put into operation further elements of a pacification plan he had drawn up earlier. Government forces reacted with appalling savagery to the SNM seizure of Burao and near capture of Hargeisa. The response culminated in the bombing and artillery bombardment of Hargeisa to a point of virtual destruction. Civilian refugees fleeing towards the border were bombed and gunned indiscriminately. It was seen, probably rightly, as an attack on the whole Isaaq people...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Waldron, Hasci |first1=Sidney R, Naima Ali |title=Somali Refugees in the Horn of Africa: State of the Art Literature Review |date=1994 |publisher=University of Oxford |isbn=91-7106-363-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:War damage Hargeysa.jpg|thumb|The attack on Hargeysa combined the use of artillery shelling and aerial bombardment.]]
Within the first three months of the conflict, Isaaqs fled their cities on such a large scale that cities of the north became devoid of their population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MEdyAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22the+major+cities+of+the+north+became+devoid+of+their+population%22 |title=War destroys, peace nurtures: reconciliation and development in Somalia |last=Ford |first=Richard |last2=Adam |first2=Hussein Mohamed |last3=Ismail |first3=Edna Adan |date=1 January 2004 |publisher=Red Sea Press |isbn=978-1-56902-186-6 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civilian Isaaqs were "killed, imprisoned under severe conditions, forced to flee across the border, or became displaced in the far-off countryside".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MEdyAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=killed,+imprisoned+under+severe+conditions,+forced+to+flee+across&amp;dq=killed,+imprisoned+under+severe+conditions,+forced+to+flee+across&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiLrL72ianTAhXMwBQKHTVNCj0Q6AEIIzAA |title=War destroys, peace nurtures: reconciliation and development in Somalia |last=Ford |first=Richard |last2=Adam |first2=Hussein Mohamed |last3=Ismail |first3=Edna Adan |date=1 January 2004 |publisher=Red Sea Press |isbn=978-1-56902-186-6 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Siad Barre]] government adopted a policy that "any able-bodied Isaaq who could help the SNM had to be killed. Those who could be of financial help or influence to the SNM, because of social status, were to be put in prison."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MEdyAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22any+able-bodied+Isaaq+who+could+help+the+SNM+%22&amp;dq=%22any+able-bodied+Isaaq+who+could+help+the+SNM+%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwja8Piy4KvTAhXoLMAKHWBcBQkQ6AEIJTAA |title=War destroys, peace nurtures: reconciliation and development in Somalia |last=Ford |first=Richard |last2=Adam |first2=Hussein Mohamed |last3=Ismail |first3=Edna Adan |date=1 January 2004 |publisher=Red Sea Press |isbn=978-1-56902-186-6 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though this policy did not exclude children or the elderly, the result was that "more than 90% of the people killed were between the ages of 15-35 years."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MEdyAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22people+killed+were+between+the+ages+of+15-35+years.%22&amp;dq=%22people+killed+were+between+the+ages+of+15-35+years.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRkJOW4avTAhViKsAKHQDXBIoQ6AEIJTAA |title=War destroys, peace nurtures: reconciliation and development in Somalia |last=Ford |first=Richard |last2=Adam |first2=Hussein Mohamed |last3=Ismail |first3=Edna Adan |date=1 January 2004 |publisher=Red Sea Press |isbn=978-1-56902-186-6 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somali historian Mohamed Haji Ingiriis refers to "the state-sponsored genocidal campaigns leveled at the Isaaq clan-group", which he notes is "popularly known in public discourses as the 'Hargeisa Holocaust'" as a "forgotten genocide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ingiriis |first=Mohamed Haji |year=2016 |title='We Swallowed the State as the State Swallowed Us': The Genesis, Genealogies, and Geographies of Genocides in Somalia |journal=African Security |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=237–258 |doi=10.1080/19392206.2016.1208475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 27 May: Burao ===
The [[Somali National Movement]] attacked and captured the city of [[Burao]] (then the third largest city in the country) on Friday 27 May.&lt;ref name="Culture"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Nu918tYMB8C&amp;pg=PA37 |title=Culture and Customs of Somalia |last=Abdullahi |first=Mohamed Diriye |date=1 January 2001 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-313-31333-2 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; They captured the town in two hours and immediately took over the military compound at the airport (where the largest number of soldiers were stationed), the Burao central police station and the prison, where they freed political prisoners (including schoolchildren) from the city's main jail.&lt;ref name="Culture" /&gt; The government forces retreated, regrouped at Goon-Ad just outside the city, and in the late afternoon, entered the centre of town.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to reports by [[Human Rights Watch]]'s Africa Watch, the soldiers, upon entering the city, went on a rampage on 27 and 28 May. This included "dragging men out of their houses and shooting them at point blank range" and summary killing of civilians, the report also noted that "civilians of all ages who had gathered in the centre of town, or those standing outside their homes watching the events were killed on the spot. Among the victims were many students."&lt;ref name="HRW"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Somalia: A Government at War With Its Own People |last= |first= |publisher=Human Rights Watch |year=1990 |isbn= |location=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/somalia_1990.pdf |pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also widespread looting by the soldiers, and some people were reportedly killed as a result.&lt;ref name="HRW" /&gt;

Following the first two days of the conflict, angered by the extent to which Isaaqs welcomed the SNM incursion, and frustrated by their inability to contain the SNM advance, the military started attacking the civilian population without restraint "as if it was the enemy".&lt;ref name="HRW" /&gt; The military used "heavy artillery and tanks, causing severe damage, both to civilians and to property. [[Bazooka]]s, machine guns, hand grenades and other weapons of mass destruction were also directed against civilian targets in Hargeisa which had also been attacked as well as in Burao."&lt;ref name="HRW" /&gt;

A [[United States]] Congressional [[General Accounting Office]] team reported the Somali government's response to the SNM attack as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;The Somali army reportedly responded to the SNM attacks in May 1988 with extreme force, inflicting heavy civilian casualties and damages to Hargeisa and Burao....The Somali military resorted to using artillery and aerial shelling in heavily populated urban centres in its effort to retake Burao and Hargeisa. A majority of the refugees we interviewed stated that their homes were destroyed by shelling despite the absence of SNM combatants from their neighbourhoods....The refugees told similar stories of bombings, strafings, and artillery shelling in both cities and, in Burao, the use of armored tanks. The majority saw their houses either damaged or destroyed by the shelling.

==== Aerial bombardment and destruction of Burao ====
[[Somali Air Force]] aircraft started intense aerial bombardment of Burao on Tuesday 31 May.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Burao, then the third largest city in Somalia&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xbQTEF0rd7wC&amp;pg=PA152 |title=Eritrea and Ethiopia: From Conflict to Cooperation |last=Tekle |first=Amare |date=1 January 1994 |publisher=The Red Sea Press |isbn=978-0-932415-97-4 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; was "razed to the ground",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C9O1AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Burao+was+razed+to+the+ground+and+under+aerial+bombardment+and+heavy+artillery+fire |title=Lives in the Balance: Perspectives on Global Injustice and Inequality |last=Lauderdale |first=Pat |last2=Amster |first2=Randall |date=1 January 1997 |publisher=Brill |isbn=9789004108752 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most of its inhabitants fled the country to seek refuge in Ethiopia. Foreign aid workers who fled the fighting confirmed that Burao was "emptied out"&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; as a result of the government's campaign.

=== 31 May: Hargeisa ===

[[Hargeisa]] was the second largest city of the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vaDkDZmrZmYC&amp;pg=PA116 |title=Safirka: An American Envoy |last=Bridges |first=Peter |date=31 March 2017 |publisher=Kent State University Press |isbn=978-0-87338-658-6 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was also strategically important due to its geographic proximity to Ethiopia (which made it central to military planning of successive Somali governments). Preventing the city from falling to the SNM became a critical goal of the government both from a military strategy standpoint and the psychological impact such loss would have.&lt;ref name="OwnPeople132"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Somalia: A government at War With Its Own People |last= |first= |publisher=Human Rights Watch |year=1990 |isbn= |location=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/somalia_1990.pdf |pages=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As news of the SNM advance on Burao reached government officials in Hargeisa, all banks were ordered to close, and army units surrounded the banks to prevent people from approaching.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Both electricity and water-supply lines were cut from the city, and residents resorted to fetching water from streams, and due to it being the [[Geography of Somalia#Climate|rainy season]] they were also able to collect water from rooftops. All vehicles (including taxis) were confiscated to control the movement of civilian population, this also ensured sufficient transport was available for the use of military and government officials. Top government officials evacuated their families to the capital [[Mogadishu]]. The period between 27–31 May was marked by much looting by government forces as well as [[mass arrest]]s. Killings in Hargeisa started on 31 May.&lt;ref name="OwnPeople132" /&gt;

A curfew was imposed on 27 May starting at 6:00 p.m, the army began systematic house-to-house searches, looking for SNM fighters.&lt;ref name="OwnPeople132" /&gt; On the following day the curfew started earlier at 4:00&amp;nbsp;pm; the third day at 2:00&amp;nbsp;pm; and on the fourth day at 11:00&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;ref name="OwnPeople132" /&gt;

Anticipating fighting to start, people stock-piled food, coal and other essential supplies. Government forces looted all warehouses and shops, with the open market of the city being one of their prime targets. Soldiers raided mosques and looted its carpets and loudspeakers. Later, civilians would be killed inside mosques.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Somalia: A Government at War With Its Own People |last= |first= |publisher=Human Rights Watch |year=1990 |isbn= |location=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/somalia_1990.pdf |pages=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant number of civilian deaths at the time occurred as a result of government soldiers robbing them, those who refused to hand valuables (watches, jewellery and money) or were not quick enough to comply with soldiers' demands were shot on the spot.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Another major cause of civilian deaths was food robbery, this was reportedily because the soldiers were not being supplied by the government.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Mass arrests in Hargeisa ====
The government, upon hearing of the SNM attack on Burao, began rounding up Isaaq men fearing they would assist an SNM attack on Hargeisa. Detainees were taken to a number of locations including Birjeeh (a former military headquarters of the 26th sector of the [[Somali Armed Forces]]), Malka-Durduro (a military compound), the Central Prison of Hargeisa, the headquarters of NSS ([[National Security Service (Somalia)|National Security Service]]), the headquarters of the Military Police as well as other secret detention centres.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Somalia: A Government at War With Its Own People |last= |first= |publisher=Human Right Watch |year=1990 |isbn= |location=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/somalia_1990.pdf |pages=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isaaq military officers were one of the first groups to be arrested. According to [[Human Rights Watch]]'s Africa Watch, some 700 Isaaqs from the armed forces were brought to one prison, this particular prison was already overcrowded, an additional 70 military personnel were then also brought for detention (40 from [[Gabiley]] and 30 from [[Hargeisa]]). Arrests were done at such scale that, to make room for the Isaaqs detainees, all non-Isaaqs were released, including those sentenced to death or life imprisonment for murder and drug-related offences. Some of those released to make room for Isaaq detainees were given arms and made guards over Isaaq detainees whilst others joined the military.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== The Hargeisa campaign ====
The SNM attack on Hargeisa started at 2:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 31 May.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Somalia: A Government at War With Its Own People |last= |first= |publisher=Human Rights Watch |year=1990 |isbn= |location=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/somalia_1990.pdf |pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government forces took a day or two to devise a plan by which they could defeat the SNM. Their counter-attack started with use of heavy weapons. These included long-range artillery guns that were placed on the hilltops near the Hargeisa Zoo, artillery guns were also placed on the hilltops behind the Badhka (an open ground used for public executions by the government).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; They then began to shell the city. The [[Human Rights Watch]] report includes testimony by foreign relief workers evacuated to [[Nairobi]] by the [[United Nations]]. One of them was Jean Metenier, a French hospital technician in Hargeisa, told reporters upon arrival at Nairobi airport that "at least two dozen people were executed by firing squad against the wall of his house and the corpses subsequently dumped on the streets to serve "as an example.""&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MEdyAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Metenier |title=War destroys, peace nurtures: reconciliation and development in Somalia |last=Ford |first=Richard |last2=Adam |first2=Hussein Mohamed |last3=Ismail |first3=Edna Adan |date=1 January 2004 |publisher=Red Sea Press |isbn=978-1-56902-186-6 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attacks on civilians were the result of the military's realisation the local Isaaq population of Hargeisa welcomed the SNM attack. This was the military's attempt at "punishing the civilians for their SNM sympathies" as well as an attempt to "destroy the SNM by denying them a civilian base of support."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The view from the air is of a town without roofs. The exposed pale green and blue plaster walls reflect the sunlight. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Many of the houses are boarded up because of the small anti-personnel mines scattered by Gen Siad Barre's forces when tens of thousands of Hargeisa residents fled. What was not destroyed was looted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=ACTUAL ARTICLE TITLE BELONGS HERE! |last=P |first=Biles |date=31 October 1991 |work=The Guardian |dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Other descriptions of what took place in Hargeisa include: &lt;blockquote&gt;Siad Barre focused his wrath (and American-supported military might) against his Northern opposition. Hargeisa, Somalia's second city and the former capital of British Somaliland was bombed, strafed and rocketed. Some 50,000 people are believed to have lost their lives there as a result of summary executions, aerial bombardments and ground attacks. The city itself was destroyed. Streams of refugees fleeing the devastation were not spared by government planes. The term "genocide" came to be used more and more frequently by human rights observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kz1jr55PZmoC&amp;q=&amp;dq=%22streams+of+refugees+fleeing+the+devastation%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiLg8_Z8Z7TAhWpI8AKHSFED7MQ6AEILjAC |title=Africa, 2005 |last=Cutter |first=Charles H. |date=2005-01-01 |publisher=Stryker-Post Publications |isbn=978-1-887985-63-5 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Amnesty International]] confirmed the large-scale targeting and killing of civilian population by Somali government troops. The campaign had completely destroyed Hargeisa, causing its population of 500,000 to flee across the border and the city was "reduced to a ghost town with 14,000 buildings destroyed and a further 12,000 heavily damaged."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=juQgND-3CaMC&amp;pg=PA330&amp;dq=%22further+12,000+heavily+damaged.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2nKal9KHTAhXHIcAKHds2AywQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22further%2012,000%20heavily%20damaged.%22&amp;f=false |title=The A to Z of Civil Wars in Africa |last=Arnold |first=Guy |date=15 September 2009 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0-8108-6885-4 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Congressional [[General Accounting Office]] team noted the extent to which residential districts were especially targeted by the army: &lt;blockquote&gt;Hargeisa, the second largest city in Somalia, has suffered extensive damage from artillery and aerial shelling. The most extensive damage appeared to be in the residential areas where the concentration of civilians was highest, in the marketplace, and in public buildings in the downtown area. The U.S. Embassy estimated that 70 percent of the city has been damaged or destroyed. Our rough visual inspection confirms this estimate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Much of Hargeisa appears to be a "ghost town," and many homes and building are virtually empty. Extensive looting has taken place even though the military has controlled the city since late July 1988. We were told that private property was taken from homes by the military in Hargeisa. Homes are devoid of doors, window frames, appliances, clothes, and furniture. The looting has resulted in the opening of what are called "Hargeisa markets" throughout the region, including Mogadishu and Ethiopia, were former residents have spotted their possessions. One observer remarked that Hargeisa is being dismantled piece by piece. We were told that long lines of trucks heavily laden with Hargeisa goods could be seen leaving the city, heading south towards Mogadishu after the heavy fighting had stopped.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The Governor of Hargeisa estimates the present population to be around 70,000, down from a pre-conflict population figure of 370,000. However, the current residents of Hargeisa are not believed to be the former Issak residents. Observers believe that Hargeisa is now composed largely of dependents of the military, which has a substantial, visible presence in Hargeisa, a significant number of Ogadeni refugees, and squatters who are using the properties of those who fled.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Observations Regarding the Northern Conflict and Resulting Conditiond |last= |first= |publisher=United States General Accounting Office |year=May 1989 |isbn= |location=http://www.gao.gov/assets/220/211267.pdf |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;The report also stated that the city was without electricity or a functioning water system, and that the Somali government was "actively soliciting multilateral and bilateral donors for reconstruction assistance"&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; of cities primarily destroyed by the government's own forces.

=== Berbera ===
[[Berbera]], a city on the [[Red Sea]] coast, at the time the principal port of Somalia after Mogadishu, was also targeted by government troops.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Somalia: A Government at War With Its Own People |last= |first= |publisher=Human Rights Watch |year=1990 |isbn= |location=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/somalia_1990.pdf |pages=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atrocities committed in Berbera by the government against Isaaq civilians were especially brutal, [[Human Rights Watch]] reported that Berbera had suffered "some of the worst abuses of the war"&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; even though the SNM had never launched an attack on Berbera like they did on Burao and Hargeisa.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Government attacks on Berbera included mass arrests, wanton killing of civilians, confiscation of civilian property, especially cars, luggage and food at the city's port, which were taken to Mogadishu. Modes of transport belonging to Isaaq civilians were confiscated by force, only military transport was allowed in the city.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==== Mass arrests ====
Immediately after the SNM attack on Burao, the government started a campaign of mass arrests in Berbera. Many Isaaq businessmen and elders were arrested as the government suspected they would support an SNM attack on Berbera.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Between 27 May and 1 June, planes which brought soldiers from Mogadishu carried Isaaq detainees on the return flight.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The killing of detainees started when orders came from Mogadishu to cease the transfer of detainees. Arrests usually happened at night and were carried out by the [[Hangash]] forces.

==== Arrests and killings of Isaaq passengers on the ship "Emviyara" ====
On 21 June a ship called 'Emviyara' had docked at the port of Berbera.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Somalia: A Government at War With Its Own People |last= |first= |publisher=Human Rights Watch |year=1990 |isbn= |location=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/somalia_1990.pdf |pages=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; The passengers were Somalis deported from [[Saudi Arabia]] after being imprisoned there before the war broke out. They were deported due to accusations by Saudi authorities of irregularities in their residence documents. Human Rights Watch reports that "out of about 400 passengers, 29 men identified themselves as Isaaks. There were many others, but they claimed to be from other clans."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The commander of the [[Hangash]] forces at Berbera and his deputy, Calas and Dakhare respectively, "sorted out the passengers according to their clan."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Those confirmed to be Isaaq were taken to the [[Hangash]] compound where their belongings and money were confiscated.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Some were severely tortured and had become permanently paralyzed as a result of the torture.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Eight of the passengers detained were killed, the remaining 21 were imprisoned in Berbera and later released.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==== Mass killings ====
Atrocities committed by government forces in Berbera are especially notable because no fighting between government forces and SNM had taken place there,&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MEdyAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=s&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=no+fighting+between+opposing+forces+had+taken+place |title=War destroys, peace nurtures: reconciliation and development in Somalia |last=Ford |first=Richard |last2=Adam |first2=Hussein Mohamed |last3=Ismail |first3=Edna Adan |date=1 January 2004 |publisher=Red Sea Press |isbn=978-1-56902-186-6 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such the government had no pretext to commit atrocities against Isaaq civilians in Berbera (and other Isaaq settlements not attacked by SNM). According to [[Human Rights Watch]] the city had suffered "some of the worst abuses of the war even though the SNM never attacked Berbera."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

As soon as news of the SNM's attack on Burao reached government authorities in Berbera, the city was completely blocked and hundreds of people were arrested.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; "More than 700 experienced worse deaths than had occurred elsewhere in the region."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Methods of killing included the slitting of throats, getting strangled by wires, the cutting of the back of the neck, and getting severely disabled by beating with clubs before getting shot.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The killings took place near the airport at a site about 10 kilometers from Berbera, and were conducted at night.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The victims were killed in batches of 30-40.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Most of them were men of fighting age that "the army feared would join the SNM,"&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; a few women were also among the victims.

Between June and the end of September, government forces as well as armed Ethiopian (Ogadeni) refugees continued to raid the immediate vicinity of Berbera as well as the villages between Berbera and Hargeisa.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Somalia: A Government at War With Its Own People |last= |first= |publisher=Human Rights Watch |year=1990 |isbn= |location=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/somalia_1990.pdf |pages=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attacks included the burning of villages, the killing of villagers, raping of women, confiscation of livestock and the arrest and detention of elders in Berbera.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Some of these villages included [[Da'ar buduq|Da'ar-buduq]], which lies half-way between Hargeisa and Berbera; Dara-Godle, which lies 20 kilometers southwest of Berbera; Sheikh Abdal, near the central prison of Mandera; Dubato; Dala, located east of Mandera prison; and Lasa-Da'awo.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The genocide continued in Berbera as late into the conflict as August 1990,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; when a group of 20 civilians were executed by the military in reprisal for an SNM ambush that happened in Dubar, near Berbera,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; the incident demonstrated that "the genocide continued in Berbera longer than other cities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MEdyAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=s&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=the+genocide+continued+in+Berbera+longer+than+other+cities |title=War destroys, peace nurtures: reconciliation and development in Somalia |last=Ford |first=Richard |last2=Adam |first2=Hussein Mohamed |last3=Ismail |first3=Edna Adan |date=1 January 2004 |publisher=Red Sea Press |isbn=978-1-56902-186-6 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Burning of Isaaq civilians in Berbera =====
[[Human Rights Watch]]'s Africa Watch also reported the case of 11 Isaaq men, some of whom were nomads, being arrested by the government on the outskirts of Berbera. They were accused of helping the SNM. The Marine Commander of Berbera, Colonel Muse 'Biqil', along with two other senior military officers ordered the 11 nomads be burnt alive. The burnt nomads were buried in a spot about 10 kilometers east of Batalale, a communal beach and tourist spot in Berbera.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Erigavo ===
Like [[Berbera]], [[Erigavo]] was an Isaaq inhabited city that the SNM did not attack, it has experienced no armed conflict between the SNM and the Somali army for at least several months, yet civilian Isaaqs have suffered both killings and arrests there at the hands of the army and other government forces.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Somalia: A Government at War With Its Own People |last= |first= |publisher=Human Rights Watch |year=1990 |isbn= |location=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/somalia_1990.pdf |pages=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The army started its campaign in Erigavo soon after the outbreak of fighting in Burao and Hargeisa. Hundreds of civilians were killed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MEdyAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22in+erigavo,+hundreds+of%22&amp;dq=%22in+erigavo,+hundreds+of%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6lYHh4qbTAhXHAsAKHe2DCFgQ6AEIIzAA |title=War destroys, peace nurtures: reconciliation and development in Somalia |last=Ford |first=Richard |last2=Adam |first2=Hussein Mohamed |last3=Ismail |first3=Edna Adan |date=1 January 2004 |publisher=Red Sea Press |isbn=978-1-56902-186-6 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and SNM forces did not reach that part of the country until 1989. One incident following a brief capture of the town in 1989 saw 60 Isaaq elders, who could not escape the city due to the difficult mountainous terrain, get taken out of their homes by government forces and were "shot by a firing squad against a wall of the public relations office."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; A number of large [[mass grave]]s were found in Erigavo in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://unpo.org/article/14917 |title=UNPO: Somaliland: Large-scale Exhumations Started |website=''unpo.org'' |access-date=15 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427095907/http://unpo.org/article/14917 |archive-date=27 April 2017 |dead-url=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1989, [[Oxfam Australia]] (at the time known as Community Aid Abroad), an aid agency which was based in Erigavo and ran a [[primary healthcare]] program for the [[Sanaag]] region, withdrew its program after operating for eight years in Somalia. It published a report "to draw attention to recent events in Somalia which have resulted in civil war, a huge refugee problem, persecution of a large section of the population along tribal lines and widespread human rights violations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Somalia: A Government at War With Its Own People |last= |first= |publisher=Human Rights Watch |year=1990 |isbn= |location=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/somalia_1990.pdf |pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report denounced the "lack of basic freedom and human rights" in Somalia, which resulted in the agency's decision to leave Somalia due to what it described as a "drastic decline in security and human rights." The report noted that the agency's staff have reported "many violations of human rights for which they believe the Somali Government must take the main responsibility."

In describing the government's response to the SNM offensive, the report observed: &lt;blockquote&gt;The government response to the attack has been particularly brutal and without regard to civilian casualties – in fact there is ample evidence that civilian casualties have been deliberately inflicted so as to destroy the support base of the SNM, which is composed mainly of people from the Isaaq tribe. Following the SNM attacks on the major towns of Hargeisa and Burao, government forces bombed the towns – causing over 400,000 people to flee the atrocities across the border into Ethiopia, where they are now located in refugee camps, living in appalling conditions, with inadequate water, food, shelter and medical facilities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In Sanaag region access to villages by CAA staff was denied by the military and project resources such as vehicles and drugs misappropriated by government officials. This combined with poor security, made primary health work impossible and endangered the lives of staff, leading to a withdrawal by the agency. Project staff were frequently harassed by the military even when attending medical emergencies and on one occasion shots were fired. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Whilst human right have been deteriorating for some years in Somalia...we believe that the government must bear a particularly heavy responsibility for events over the last six months.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;With regards to atrocities specific to Erigavo the report noted:&lt;blockquote&gt;The military occupation of Erigavo has resulted in widespread suffering for the people of that area forcing many people flee to the bush including most of the population of Erigavo. It is believed that the military gave the elders of the village money in payment for boys as young as twelve and thirteen years of age. Untrained and disciplined, these youths were armed with [[AK47]]s and sent to patrol the town, unsure and ignorant of how to use their newly acquired power.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The report noted one case where a 13-year-old girl from Erigavo was raped by six government soldiers, it also stated that "looting, raping and bashing are commonplace."&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1989/01/10/Aid-agency-alleged-torture-by-US-backed-military/4088600411600/ |title=Aid agency alleged torture by U.S.-backed military |agency=United Press International |access-date=15 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427004141/http://www.upi.com/Archives/1989/01/10/Aid-agency-alleged-torture-by-US-backed-military/4088600411600/ |archive-date=27 April 2017 |dead-url=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate case, a man leaving Erigavo with money and food was "robbed, beaten and shot by the military."&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; His body was then "dumped in the town and was eaten to the waist by hyenas."

In describing the Somali government policies in the region, Peter Kieseker, a spokesman for the CAA commented: "Genocide is the only word for it."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== El Afweyne ===
In [[El Afweyn]] in the [[Sanaag]] region and its surrounding territory "over 300 persons were killed in October 1988 in revenge for the death of an army officer who was killed by a rebel-laid landmine."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MEdyAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22killed+by+a+rebel-laid+landmine%22&amp;dq=%22killed+by+a+rebel-laid+landmine%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi8ota8pqfTAhWLI8AKHaXfB00Q6AEIIzAA |title=War destroys, peace nurtures: reconciliation and development in Somalia |last=Ford |first=Richard |last2=Adam |first2=Hussein Mohamed |last3=Ismail |first3=Edna Adan |date=1 January 2004 |publisher=Red Sea Press |isbn=978-1-56902-186-6 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oxfam Australia]] (formerly known as Community Aid Abroad) described the situation in El Afweyn as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is known that many people have fled from the town of Elafweyn following bombing attacks by the government forces. A "scorched earth" policy applied to the villages in the Elafweyn plains. These displaced people are hiding in the bush without adequate access to food and medical supplies.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Sheikh ===
When news of the outbreak of fighting in Burao reached [[Sheikh, Somaliland|Sheikh]], government-armed Ogadeni refugees in the area as well as the army units stationed there started to kill civilians and loot their homes.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Somalia: A Government at War With Its Own People |last= |first= |publisher=Human Rights Watch |year=1990 |isbn= |location=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/somalia_1990.pdf |pages=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government continued to commit atrocities in Sheikh despite the lack of SNM activity there.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; There were also widespread arrests of Isaaq men in the area, they were usually detained at a nearby military compound.

=== Mogadishu ===
The government's victimisation of the Isaaq was not only limited to northern regions susceptible to SNM attacks. During the period of unrest in the north of the country, the government started arresting civilian Isaaq residents of the capital, [[Mogadishu]]. Those arrested Isaaqs included businessmen, [[Somali Airlines]] staff, army officers, employees of relief agencies, and civil servants.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Somalia: A Government at War With Its Own People |last= |first= |publisher=Human Rights Watch |year=1990 |isbn= |location=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/somalia_1990.pdf |pages=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the case in [[Berbera]], [[Erigavo]], [[Sheikh, Somaliland|Sheikh]] and other towns in the north, there was no SNM activity in Mogadishu, moreover, Mogadishu was geographically removed from the situation in the north of the country due to its position in the southern regions, nevertheless the Somali government committed to its policy of persecution of Isaaq civilians in Mogadishu.

Over 300 Isaaq detainees were held the [[National Security Service (Somalia)|National Security Service]] headquarters,&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; at Godka, another NSS facility (prison), at a military camp at Salaan Sharafta, at Laanta Bur Prison, a maximum security prison 50 kilometers from Mogadishu. They were taken out of their homes in Mogadishu in the middle of the night of 19 July 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MEdyAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22out+of+their+homes+in+the+middle+of+the+night+of+19+july%22&amp;dq=%22out+of+their+homes+in+the+middle+of+the+night+of+19+july%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi39P7mvKfTAhUCLMAKHUCEC2AQ6AEIIzAA |title=War destroys, peace nurtures: reconciliation and development in Somalia |last=Ford |first=Richard |last2=Adam |first2=Hussein Mohamed |last3=Ismail |first3=Edna Adan |date=1 January 2004 |publisher=Red Sea Press |isbn=978-1-56902-186-6 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the detainees were released only after bribes were paid.

The small hotels of Mogadishu were searched by the government at night and their guests were sorted into Isaaqs and non-Isaaqs; the Isaaqs would then be subsequently detained.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

On government orders, all Isaaq senior officials were proscribed from leaving the country for fear they would joining the SNM. One example of this is the case of Abdi Rageh, an Isaaq former military officer, was forcibly removed from a flight leaving for [[Frankfurt]].&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Another example of this policy is the arrest of Omar Mohamed Nimalleh, a businessman and a former colonel in the police who was arrested at the airport on his way to Kenya on a business trip.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

According to [[Claudio Pacifico]], an [[Italy|Italian]] diplomat who at the time was the second in command at the Italian Embassy in Mogadishu and was present in the city at the time, it was the commander of the armoured division of the Somali army, General Ibrahim Ali Barre "Canjeex", who personally oversaw the midnight arrests of the Isaaq men and their transfer to Jasiira beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PBvfTmzsZ-0C&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=and+their+transfer+to+to+Jasiira+beach&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gn_ftDO0U5&amp;sig=XbG1DHzHUfWWUaBArWNm1ziTXJc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwil6J_kx6fTAhXpL8AKHYm_BpsQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=and%20their%20transfer%20to%20to%20Jasiira%20beach&amp;f=false |title=Clan Cleansing in Somalia: The Ruinous Legacy of 1991 |last=Kapteijns |first=Lidwien |date=18 December 2012 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=0-8122-0758-0 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attacks on Isaaq nomads by Ogadeni refugees in the countryside ===
The countryside was an area of operations for the government-armed Ethiopian (Ogadeni) refugees. [[Human Rights Watch]] reported that the refugees often "rampaged through villages and nomadic encampments near their numerous camps and claimed the lives of thousands of others, mostly nomads."

According to a foreign aid-agency official who was in the north after the fighting broke out: &lt;blockquote&gt;the Siyad Barre government was so eager to arm the Ogaden refugees that it enlisted workers of the civilian National Refugee Commission – which administers the Ogaden refugee camps – to help distribute weapons... 'Now all the camps are heavily armed' an experienced western aid official said. Some of the camps' adult males are thought to have headed for the bush to avoid being drafted by the government... Many others are said to have accepted weapons from the government and left their camps in search of Isaaqs ... Recent travellers in the north added that many Ogaden Somalis from the UN refugee camps – and a fair number of another pro-government group, the Oromo, have been seen carrying American M-16 rifles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MEdyAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=and+a+fair+number+of+another+pro-government+group,+the+Oromo&amp;dq=and+a+fair+number+of+another+pro-government+group,+the+Oromo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7waeM9ajTAhVFuRQKHe-1AEEQ6AEIIzAA |title=War destroys, peace nurtures: reconciliation and development in Somalia |last=Ford |first=Richard |last2=Adam |first2=Hussein Mohamed |last3=Ismail |first3=Edna Adan |date=2004-01-01 |publisher=Red Sea Press |isbn=978-1-56902-186-6 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Ogadeni refugees formed militant groups that hunted Isaaq civilians around Bioley, Adhi-Adais, Saba'ad, Las-Dhureh, Daamka and Agabar refugee camps. In many cases, the Isaaq victims were left unburied "to be eaten by wild beasts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MEdyAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=and+a+fair+number+of+another+pro-government+group,+the+Oromo&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22to+be+eaten+by+wild+beasts.%22 |title=War destroys, peace nurtures: reconciliation and development in Somalia |last=Ford |first=Richard |last2=Adam |first2=Hussein Mohamed |last3=Ismail |first3=Edna Adan |date=1 January 2004 |publisher=Red Sea Press |isbn=978-1-56902-186-6 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strafing of Isaaq refugees ===
Atrocities committed by the Barre's forces against Isaaqs included the [[strafing]] (i.e. machine gunning from aircraft) of fleeing refugees until they reached safety at the Ethiopian borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vtotAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=somalia+barre+aerial+bombardment+strafing&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22+continuously+strafed+from+the+air+every+day%22 |title=The cost of dictatorship: the Somali experience |last=Ghalīb |first=Jama Mohamed |date=1 January 1995 |publisher=L.

African historian Lidwien Kapteijns describes the ordeal of Isaaqs refugees fleeing their homes as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;Throughout this period, the whole civilian population appears to have become a target, in their homes and anywhere they sought refuge. Even during their long and harrowing exodus – on foot, without water or food, carrying the young and weak, giving birth on the way – across the border to Ethiopia, planes strafed them from the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PBvfTmzsZ-0C&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=%22across+the+border+to+Ethiopia,+planes+strafed%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1k-GP8avTAhVrBMAKHRTVBPwQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22across%20the%20border%20to%20Ethiopia,%20planes%20strafed%22&amp;f=false |title=Clan Cleansing in Somalia: The Ruinous Legacy of 1991 |last=Kapteijns |first=Lidwien |date=2012-12-18 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=0-8122-0758-0 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Genocide scholar [[Adam Jones (Canadian scholar)|Adam Jones]] also discusses this particular aspect of the Siad Barre's campaign against the Isaaq: &lt;blockquote&gt;In two months, from May to July 1988, between 50,000 and 100,000 people were massacred by the regime's forces. By then, any surviving urban Isaaks – that is to say, hundreds of thousands of members of the main northern clan community – had fled across the border into Ethiopia. They were pursued along the way by British-made fighter-bombers piloted by mercenary South African and ex-Rhodesian pilots, paid $2,000 per sortie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jvPtAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22that+is+to+say,+hundreds+of+thousands+of+members+of+the+main+northern+clan+community%22&amp;dq=%22that+is+to+say,+hundreds+of+thousands+of+members+of+the+main+northern+clan+community%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnxq-b8KHTAhUgM8AKHQW_AJ0Q6AEIJTAA |title=Genocide, war crimes and the West: history and complicity |last=Jones |first=Adam |date=2004-07-23 |publisher=Zed Books |isbn=978-1-84277-190-7 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Despite the government's continued refusal to grant international human rights organisations and foreign journalists access to the north to report on the situation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r8rbBfTM0AgC&amp;pg=PA243 |title=Arms for the Horn: U.S. Security Policy in Ethiopia and Somalia, 1953–1991 |last=Lefebvre |first=Jeffrey A. |date=15 January 1992 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Pre |isbn=978-0-8229-7031-6 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported the strafing of Isaaq refugees as part of its coverage of the conflict:&lt;blockquote&gt;Western diplomats here said they believed that the fighting in Somalia, which has gone largely unreported in the West, was continuing unabated. More than 10,000 people were killed in the first month after the conflict began in late May, according to reports reaching diplomats here. The Somali Government has bombed towns and strafed fleeing residents and used artillery indiscriminately, according to the officials.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/13/world/over-300000-somalis-fleeing-civil-war-cross-into-ethiopia.html |title=Over 300,000 Somalis, Fleeing Civil War, Cross into Ethiopia |last=Times |first=Jane Perlez, Special to the New York |date=1988-08-13 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2017-04-13 |issn=0362-4331 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427004216/http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/13/world/over-300000-somalis-fleeing-civil-war-cross-into-ethiopia.html |archive-date=2017-04-27 |dead-url=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Use of mercenaries by the Somali government ===
In addition to using both air and ground military capabilities against the Isaaq, the Somali government also hired [[South Africa]]n and [[Rhodesia]]n mercenaries&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Thousands of somalis 'hit by genocide raids' |last=Simmons |first=M |date=7 January 1989 |work=The Guardian |dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VRjZLMt6LU4C&amp;pg=PA140&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;dq=+1988&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DJe5bMpPrL&amp;sig=Z2UoEhAoOYqviZJsj_9a_yq_fms&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJsJK1gKnTAhWCCBoKHZszD3sQ6AEINDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=recruited%20mercenary%20fighter-bomber%20pilots&amp;f=false |title=Africa's Wars and Prospects for Peace |last=Copson |first=Raymond W. |date=1 January 1994 |publisher=M.E.

In addition to the "systematic destruction of Isaaq dwellings, settlements and water points", bombing raids were conducted on major cities in the northwest regions inhabited mainly by Isaaq on orders of President Barre.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vz6gCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99 |title=Understanding Statebuilding: Traditional Governance and the Modern State in Somaliland |last=Richards |first=Rebecca |date=24 February 2016 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-00466-0 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' reported the brutal campaign by the Somali government against the Isaaq: &lt;blockquote&gt;Hundred of Thousands of people have been killed, dispersed or bombed out of their homes in northern Somalia after government military operations which Western aid workers say are little short of genocide.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The action has been concentrated on the three northern towns of Hargeisa, Berbera and Burao where some 20,000 people are believed to have died in recent bombing raids by the government ... Many thousands of others are being systematically denied food because Somali forces are deliberately holding up essential supplies. Aid officials said that up to 800,000 people – almost all of them Issaq nomads – have been displaced as a result of the civil war. A quarter of these, and possibly as many as 300,000, were now struggling to survive in wretched conditions in refugee camps in Ethiopia while a similar number had been forced to leave Africa. The fate of those who can no longer be traced remains largely unknown.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;... Until about eight months ago, the urbanised population of Issaqi were concentrated in Hargeisa, Berbera and Burao. Although few journalists have been authorised to visit the area, tens of thousands of people are understood to have died during a series of bombing raids on the towns last August conducted mainly by mercenaries recruited in Zimbabwe.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;... "they just bombed and bombed and bombed," an [aid] agency man, recently returned from Somalia said. Hargeisa which originally had a population of 350,000, was 70 percent destroyed, Burao was "devastated" in the same raids.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Issaqis who survived the bombings are said to have been rounded up in the streets by Somali troops and summarily shot. Mass graves have since been found as well as corpses which were left to rot in the streets where they fell.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The people now living in the three towns are believed to be totally non-Issaqi or military personnel who have been deputed to guard what has been retaken from the SNM.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Government use of land-mines ===
A particularly enduring aspect of the conflict was the Somali government's use of [[Anti-personnel mine|anti-personnel land-mines]] in Isaaq cities. An emblematic aspect of Siad Barre's government's "policy of genocide towards the Issak group of clans" was the laying of "over one-million unmarked mines, booby traps and other lethal devices in the Northern Region..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TTkOAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22The+base+criminality+of+having+laid+over+one-million+unmarked+mines%22&amp;dq=%22The+base+criminality+of+having+laid+over+one-million+unmarked+mines%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj89qaip6nTAhXCCsAKHb0gBdYQ6AEIKDAB |title=Somaliland 1991: Report and Reference |last=Drysdale |first=John Gordon Stewart |date=1 January 1991 |publisher=Global-Stats |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; over the duration of the conflict. The exact number of land-mines is unknown but estimated to be between one and two million, most of them planted in what was then known as northern Somalia.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tBzsZmbFrsYC&amp;pg=PA271 |title=After the Guns Fall Silent: The Enduring Legacy of Landmines |last=Roberts |first=Shawn |last2=Williams |first2=Jody |date=1 January 1995 |publisher=Oxfam |isbn=978-0-85598-337-6 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-personnel mines were used to target Isaaq civilians returning to cities and towns as they were planted in "streets, houses and livestock thoroughfares to kill, maim and deter return."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mt9lv7Lis6QC&amp;pg=PA90 |title=Somalia – The Untold Story: The War Through the Eyes of Somali Women |last=Gardner |first=Judith |last2=Bushra |first2=Judy El |date=1 January 2004 |publisher=CIIR |isbn=978-0-7453-2208-7 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the mines were "scattered across pastoral lands or hidden near water holes or on secondary roads and former military installations."&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EqWsbzQh0g4C&amp;pg=PA221 |title=Landmines: A Deadly Legacy |last=(U.S.) |first=Physicians for Human Rights |date=1 January 1993 |publisher=Human Rights Watch |isbn=978-1-56432-113-8 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1992, [[Physicians for Human Rights]] sent a medical team to the region to examine the scale of the problem of land-mines left over from the 1988–1991 conflict, they have described the situation as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;They [mines] are most prevalent in the countryside surrounding two of Somaliland's principal cities, Hargeisa and Burao, and in the pastoral and agricultural lands west of Burao. Now that the civil war has ended, the victims of mines have been principally civilians, many of whom are women and children.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Somali army mined and blew up many of Hargeisa's principal buildings such as "the Union Hotel and a private maternity clinic near the Sha'ab girls School",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Somalia: A Government at War With Its Own People |last= |first= |publisher=Human Rights Watch |year=1990 |isbn= |location=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/somalia_1990.pdf |pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was done in an attempt to clear the area between them and the SNM. Residential properties which were near important government offices were also blown up.

The Somalia Handbook for U.S. armed forces notes that "the landmine problem in Somalia can be described as a general problem in the southern sectors of Somalia and a very serious problem in the northern sectors."&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EqWsbzQh0g4C&amp;pg=PA222 |title=Landmines: A Deadly Legacy |last=(U.S.) |first=Physicians for Human Rights |date=1 January 1993 |publisher=Human Rights Watch |isbn=978-1-56432-113-8 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In describing the prevalence of land-mines especially in the countryside surrounding cities inhabited by Isaaq, the Somalia Handbook states, "Large patterned minefields, exceeding 100,000 mines have been emplaced in sections surrounding the city. Extensive boobytrap activity has also been reported from Hargeysa."&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

==== Somali government's mining of grazing and agricultural land ====
The use of land-mines by government forces against civilians was especially damaging in this particular region due to majority of Isaaqs (and other northern Somalis) being pastoral nomads, reliant on the grazing of sheep, goats, and camels.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; A report commissioned by the [[Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation]] describes the ramifications of this tactic as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;The Siad Barre government also mined rural areas to disrupt the economy and the nomadic population, who were seen as the base of support of the SNM. Agarey, Jajabod, Dalqableh, Ubaaleh, Adadley and Farjano-Megasta were affected. Dry-season grazing land and areas close to permanent water sources at higher elevation were particularly hard hit. There are landmines at such high-altitude grazing areas between Burao and Erigavo. Large areas of grazing land in Zeyla were also mined... One consequence of landmines was the cessation of sheep exports to Saudi Arabia and Yemen.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tBzsZmbFrsYC&amp;pg=PA272&amp;lpg=PA272&amp;dq=%22Large+areas+of+grazing+land+in+Zeyla+were+also+mined.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-siExoswTY&amp;sig=5Rq3ue8nKG-_mdIijsso1ekSL4U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIxoPQwKvTAhXlL8AKHUfwDJ0Q6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Large%20areas%20of%20grazing%20land%20in%20Zeyla%20were%20also%20mined.%22&amp;f=false |title=After the Guns Fall Silent: The Enduring Legacy of Landmines |last=Roberts |first=Shawn |last2=Williams |first2=Jody |date=1995-01-01 |publisher=Oxfam |isbn=978-0-85598-337-6 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;One of the most densely mined areas in the north were the agricultural settlements around [[Gabiley]] and [[Arabsiyo]].&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; It is reported that thousands of people were affected by mining in that area, by either abandoning their farmlands entirely due to land-mines or by severe restrictions on farming due to the presence of mines in their fields or the roads network.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

==== Somali government's mining of civilian homes ====
[[Physicians for Human Rights]] describe one tactic employed by Barre's troops used in their campaign against the Isaaq people of the north:&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the cruelest – and clearly unlawful – tactics used by Siad Barre's troops was the deliberate mining of civilian homes. In 1988, government forces shelled and bombed the capital of Hargeisa. Before fleeing, many residents buried their valuables in holes dug in the floors or courtyards of their homes. Upon discovering these stashes, soldiers removed the jewellery and other valuables and placed booby-traps or mines in these hiding places. After the fighting ceased, many of those who had fled returned to their homes in the first months of 1991 only to be injured or killed by these hidden explosives... Some families were said to be squatting outside their houses because they were afraid to enter.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;... Siad Barre's forces deliberately mined wells and grazing lands in an effort to kill and terrorize nomadic herders whom the army viewed as protectors of the SNM. While direct evidence is not available, most observers agree that Siad Barre's forces undertook this extensive mining to prevent resettlement by the predominantly Isaak nomads and agriculturists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EqWsbzQh0g4C&amp;pg=PA224&amp;lpg=PA224&amp;dq=%22Some+families+were+said+to+be+squatting+outside+their+houses+because+they+were+afraid+to+enter%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Vy6foKvZZA&amp;sig=FoHBxkf3KrMjRWGt8Uzy26uj06Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFoYbYsKvTAhWqDsAKHb1mAKYQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Some%20families%20were%20said%20to%20be%20squatting%20outside%20their%20houses%20because%20they%20were%20afraid%20to%20enter%22&amp;f=false |title=Landmines: A Deadly Legacy |last=(U.S.) |first=Physicians for Human Rights |date=1993-01-01 |publisher=Human Rights Watch |isbn=978-1-56432-113-8 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;The British mine-clearing company Rimfire, contracted by the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] to conduct de-mining activities has identified land-mines from 24 different countries in Somalia. The majority were from the Czech Republic, Russia, Pakistan and Belgium.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

==== Somali governments use of land-mines at water sources ====
The Barre government also mined water sources during its campaign against Isaaq civilians. This was especially harsh due to region's semi-arid climate and frequent water shortages. Hargeisa's main water supply, the Gedebley reservoir and its pumping station, were surrounded with minefields by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-s8tAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22formerly+the+main+water+supply+for+hargeisa%22 |title=Violent deeds live on: landmines in Somalia and Somaliland |last=Omaar |first=Rakiya |last2=Waal |first2=Alexander De |last3=McGrath |first3=Rae |last4=(Organization) |first4=African Rights |last5=(Organization) |first5=Mines Advisory Group |date=1 January 1993 |publisher=African Rights |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deep water wells at Sab'ad refugee camp was also surrounded by a minefield.

=== Reported acquisition of chemical weapons ===
During the government campaign against the Isaaq in 1988 and 1989, numerous credible reports by the US and international media reported that Somalia had received shipments of chemical weapons from Libya. [[NBC News]] reported a story on 12 January 1989 that the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]] "had information eight months earlier that Libyan President [[Muammar Gaddafi]] gave Somalia chemical weapons."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GoJjDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT223#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f |title=Genocide, War Crimes and the West: History and Complicity |last=Jones |first=Doctor Adam |date=4 July 2013 |publisher=Zed Books Ltd. |isbn=978-1-84813-682-3 |language=en |access-date=3 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703220243/https://books.google.com/books?id=GoJjDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT223#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f |archive-date=3 July 2018 |dead-url=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US [[United States Department of State|State Department]] denied the account, but NBC stood by its story when questioned by a Congressional office. Two weeks later, on 25 January [[The Washington Post]] reported that the government of Gen. Mohammed Siad Barre "is stockpiling chemical weapons in warehouses near its capital, Mogadishu."&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1989/01/25/somalia-fights-charges-of-human-rights-abuses/a750753b-c0cc-43e4-8e31-a9f211fa55b4/ |title=SOMALIA FIGHTS CHARGES OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES |last=Battiata |first=Mary |date=25 January 1989 |work=The Washington Post |access-date=3 July 2018 |issn=0190-8286 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703220523/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1989/01/25/somalia-fights-charges-of-human-rights-abuses/a750753b-c0cc-43e4-8e31-a9f211fa55b4/ |archive-date=3 July 2018 |dead-url=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reports state that canisters of the nerve gases [[Soman]] and [[Sarin]] were unloaded from a Libyan Airlines civilian flight to Mogadishu on 7 October. The British Foreign Secretary [[Geoffrey Howe]] stated that the British Government was "deeply concerned" about authoritative reports that chemical weapons had been received in Somalia.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; The Somali government, represented by Prime Minister [[Mohammad Ali Samatar]] has denied possession of chemical weapons.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;

== Targeting of other groups ==
The Isaaq clan was not the only target of violence. Many other Somali communities, such as the Umar Mahmud sub-lineage of [[Majeerteen]] also became the victims of the violence and war. A US Country Study handbook describes the Barre regime retaliation against the Umar Mahmud following a failed coup attempt in 1978 which resulted in 2,000 Umar Mahmuud civilians dying in [[Mudug]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0lXJ6nHj5HIC&amp;dq |title=Somalia: a country study |last=Division |first=Library of Congress Federal Research |date=1993 |publisher=The Division |isbn=978-0-8444-0775-3 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rebecca Richards, the violence in the north and northwest was disproportionate but affected many communities, particularly Isaaq.&lt;ref name="Richards2016p98" /&gt; The shelling, aerial bombing and associated mass deaths in many communities particularly targeted the members of the Isaaq clan, states Richards, and this systematic state violence was linked to the belief that these groups were obtaining assistance from the Ethiopian government. The harsh reprisals, widespread bombing and burning of villages followed every time there was an attack by SNM believed to be hiding in Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="Richards2016p98"&gt;{{cite book |author=Rebecca Richards |title=Understanding Statebuilding: Traditional Governance and the Modern State in Somaliland |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vz6gCwAAQBAJ |year=2016 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-00466-0 |pages=98–100 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taisier M. Ali states that Barre assuaged the Majerteen, and targeted other groups like the [[Hawiye]]. According to Ali, "with funds and clan appeals, he [Barre] was able to entice the bulk of SSDF fighters to return from Ethiopia and participate in his genocidal wars against the Isaq in the north and later against the Hawiye in the South, including Mogadisho".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rcu-hmpVLUYC&amp;pg=PA175 |title=Civil Wars in Africa: Roots and Resolution |last=Ali |first=Taisier M. |date=1999 |publisher=McGill-Queen's Press – MQUP |isbn=978-0-7735-1883-4 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some observers such as the [[International Crisis Group]], while the violence under Barre affected many communities in Somalia, "no other Somali community faced such sustained and intense state-sponsored violence" as the Isaaq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://d2071andvip0wj.cloudfront.net/somaliland-time-for-african-union-leadership.pdf |title=Somaliland: Time for African Union Leadership |date=23 May 2016 |series=Crisis Group Africa Report 110 |publisher=International Crisis Group |page=6 |accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; African historian, Lidwien Kapteijns in discussing the targeting of Isaaq people as a distinct group in relation to other groups also targeted by the Barre government states:&lt;blockquote&gt;Collective clan-based violence against civilians always represents a violation of human rights. However, when its goal is to exterminate and expel large numbers of people based on their group identity alone, it becomes clan cleansing. No one has suggested this term for the collective brutalization of the people of Mudug [Majerteen]. However, for the Northwest [Isaaq], this and even stronger terms (such as genocide) are regularly used. The scale and character of the collective clan-based violence committed against Isaaq civilians – who, although they were not the only civilians brutalized by the government, were especially targeted – suggest that this dimension of state-violence in the Northwest [Isaaq territory] indeed amounts to clan cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PBvfTmzsZ-0C&amp;pg=PA87 |title=Clan Cleansing in Somalia: The Ruinous Legacy of 1991 |last=Kapteijns |first=Lidwien |date=2012-12-18 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=0-8122-0758-0 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Mohamed Haji Ingiriis, the vicious atrocities during the reign of Barre were not an isolated event nor unusual in Somalia's history. Barre also targeted the Hawiye. But, states Ingiriis, Barre extermination campaigns against other clan groups reflected the deep seated historic cycles of repressions by the clan that gains dominant power then marginalizes other clans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mohamed Haji Ingiriis |title=The Suicidal State in Somalia: The Rise and Fall of the Siad Barre Regime, 1969–1991 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vzi6CwAAQBAJ |year=2016 |publisher=University Press of America |isbn=978-0-7618-6720-3 |pages=236–239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Land of Thirst''''' is a [[South African]] television drama written and directed by [[Meg Rickards]], who is Cape town based. The drama was broadcast on [[SABC2]] in Jan/Feb 2008 in three segments and was produced by Durban based Vuleka Productions.  It is also available as a 94 minute film which is slightly different in its opening style.

The drama was adapted from a novel published nearly a century ago, Margaret Harding, by [[Perceval Gibbon]], who came to South Africa as a [[Boer War]] journalist and later wrote this work.

An historical romance set in the [[Karoo]] in 1913, ''Land of Thirst'' is an extraordinary love story about two people far ahead of their time, caught in the cross-currents of emergent South Africa. Margaret leaves England and moves to Africa for the treatment of her tuberculosis in the dry air of the Karoo, while Khanyiso goes there to search for his African roots. Romance flourishes for them in this “land of thirst” – but can they keep their love alive in such a hostile world?

Margaret and Khanyiso independently leave England and travel to South Africa. The consumptive Margaret seeks treatment at a sanatorium. Khanyiso is the son of a Xhosa chief executed by the British twenty years earlier who was taken to London as a child, raised as an English gentleman and given a medical training. He is returning home to unearth what happened to his father – and to serve his people as a doctor.

Margaret and Khanyiso both feel alienated in the deeply parochial society of the Karoo. The decrepit sanatorium where Margaret is being treated is run by an alcoholic doctor and his mean-spirited wife, while Khanyiso must stay in a brothel after being shunned by the racist proprietors of every guesthouse in town. Khanyiso and Margaret meet through a shy teenager named Paul – a naïve farm boy who latches onto both of them as his only friends. Khanyiso and Margaret find in each other refuge from the harsh world of the Karoo, and fall passionately in love. But their love puts both their lives at risk.

'''Mauger, ''[[jure uxoris]]'' Count of Corbeil''' was the third&lt;ref&gt;Roger Granville, ''The History of the Granville Family: Traced Back to Rollo, First Duke of Normandy. With Pedigrees, Etc'' (W. Pollard &amp; Company, 1895), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; son of [[Richard I of Normandy]], and ruled as Count of Corbeil through his wife Germaine de Corbeil, daughter of Aymon, Count of Corbeil.&lt;ref&gt;''The Haskins Society Journal, Volume 4'' (Hambledon Press, 1992), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; "Corbeil" is thought to be the modern [[Corbeil-Essonnes]] on the [[River Seine]] about 17 miles south-east of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Round, p.146, quoting the correspondence of Rev. Dennis Grenville, Dean of Durham and chaplain to King Charles II, a younger son of Sir [[Bevil Grenville]], who after the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 went into exile in France with the [[Old Pretender]] and lived at "Tremblet", a suburb of "Corbeil on the Seine", which latter place he "lately and happily discovered...hath been the seat of my ancestors and...is that Corbeil whereof there were antiently Earles...from one of whom I have made out my descent in a straight line". He claimed descent from [[Richard I de Grenville]] (d.post 1142), a supposed grandson of [[Hamon Dentatus]], supposedly Earl of Corbeil&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Life==
Mauger was a son of [[Richard I of Normandy|Richard I, Duke of Normandy]] and his second wife, [[Gunnora]].&lt;ref name="ESII79"&gt;Detlev Schwennicke, ''[[Europäische Stammtafeln: Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europäischen Staaten]]'', Neue Folge, Band II (Marburg, Germany: Verlag von J.

He may have been the father of William "Werlenc", [[List of Counts of Mortain|Count of Mortain]], though this is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;David Charles Douglas and George William Greenaway, ''English Historical Documents, 1042-1189'' (Psychology Press, 1996), p. 297&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''People's Progressive Party''' is a moderate [[political party]] in [[the Gambia]]. It was the dominant ruling party from 1965 with president [[Dawda Jawara]]. He was elected for a sixth term of office in 1992, but was overthrown in a coup by young army officers in 1994. The party was banned from the 1996 and 1997 elections.

In 2005, the PPP joined the opposition [[National Alliance for Democracy and Development]] (NADD).

The PPP was part of the [[Coalition 2016]] for the [[Gambian presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]], where [[Adama Barrow]] was declared the coalition's candidate and subsequently won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gainako.com/gambian-opposition-parties-set-select-single-candidate-december-polls-convention/ |title=Gambian Opposition Parties Set to Select a Single Candidate for December polls at a Convention |website=GAINAKO |date=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The party was founded in 1959 as the '''Protectorate People's Party''' (PPP), but just before the 1960 elections, it was changed to People's Progressive Party. The party won the 1962 election, and in October 1963, upon the attainment of self-government, their leader, [[Dawda Jawara]], became [[Prime Minister of the Gambia]]. With the republican referendum in 1970, Jawara became the first [[President of the Gambia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wNrYsgEACAAJ&amp;pg=PA282 |title=The Upper Guinea Coast in Global Perspective |last=Bellagamba |first=Alice |publisher=Berghahn Books |year=2016|isbn=|location=|page=282 |chapter=Solo Darboe, Former Diamond Dealer: Transnational Connections and Home Politics in the Twentieth-Century Gambia|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saranta Kolones'''({{lang-el| Κάστρο Σαράντα Κολώνες, Forty Columns castle}}) is a ruined medieval fortress inside the [[Paphos Archaeological Park]] and it is located just north of the harbour of [[Paphos]], on the island of [[Cyprus]]. It takes its name from the large number of granite columns that were found on the site and probably once formed part of the ancient [[agora]]. The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] castle is believed to have been built at the end of the 7th century AD to protect the port and the city of Nea Pafos from Arab raids and later remodeled by the [[Lusignan dynasty|Lusignans]]. The Fortress had a three-metre thick wall with four huge corner towers and another four intermediary towers along the joining walls and moat surrounding the castle. Access was across a wooden bridge spanning the moat. The square courtyard measured 35 metres long by 35 metres wide, with a tower at each corner. The main entrance was through a fifth, horseshoe-shaped tower on the east side. Destroyed by an earthquake in [[1222 Cyprus earthquake|1222]], the castle was subsequently abandoned.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7334">{{hatnote|Not to be confused with [[Taglish]], [[Tenglish]], or [[Tinglish]], macaronic languages of English with Tagalog, Telugu, and Thai, respectively.}}
'''Tanglish''' ({{lang-ta|தமிங்கிலம்}}) is [[macaronic language]] usage, composed of [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[English language|English]]; the name is a [[portmanteau]] of the names of the two languages and is sometimes spelled "'''Tamglish'''".

==Distribution==

===Tamil Nadu===
The use of Tanglish has been common in [[Chennai]], possibly due in part to the use of English in education. Also, the influx to the city of speakers of other languages (such as [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], and [[Kannada]]) has increased the importance of English as the language that people have in common.&lt;ref name=TanglishRulesTheRoost&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:LowLevelEntityToPrint_TOINEW&amp;Type=text/html&amp;Locale=english-skin-custom&amp;Path=TOICH/2010/06/21&amp;ID=Ar00202 |work=The Times Of India Chennai |date=June 21, 2010 |page=2 |title=Tanglish rules the roost in Tamil Nadu |first=R |last=Vasundara}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''The Hindu'' in 2010, a student in Chennai told of the widespread use of Tanglish by teenagers in her city. She said Tanglish was "something almost every teenager in Chennai uses", but noted that her mother said Tanglish was "murdering the [Tamil] language".&lt;ref name=EnterTang&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/nxg/article406715.ece |title = Enter, Tanglish |newspaper=The Hindu |last=Narayanan |first=Hiranmayi |date=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, a Tamil teacher in a matriculation school in Chennai reported that few of her students had a large enough Tamil [[vocabulary]] to be able to speak Tamil without including some words of English.&lt;ref name=TanglishRulesTheRoost/&gt;

Tanglish is increasingly used in advertising aimed at consumers in [[Tamil Nadu]], particularly for promotion of international products.&lt;ref name=HinduKonjam&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2004/02/21/stories/2004022100060100.htm| title=Konjam Tamil Konjam English |last=Rangarajan| first=Malathi |newspaper= The Hindu |date=21 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Pepsi]] has mixed English with Tamil in its slogan "ullam kekkuthae more".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Hasuria Che Omar|title=The Sustainability of the Translation Field|date=2009 |isbn=978-983-42179-6-9 |page=459}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, ''The Hindu'' commented on a mobile phone advertising campaign in Chennai that used slogans that combined Tamil and English, such as "Konjam Samaiyal... Konjam Serial", "Konjam Advice... Konjam Udaans", and "Konjam Kadhal... Konjam Modhal."&lt;ref name=HinduKonjam/&gt; It also is common for advertising to use the Tamil language rendered in the [[English alphabet]], a trend that leads to concern that people are losing the ability to read [[Tamil script]].&lt;ref name=HinduKonjam/&gt;

The Tanglish lyrics of the film song "[[Why This Kolaveri Di]]", which went viral on Internet social networking sites in November 2011, have been identified as a factor in the song's popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-11-29/news-interviews/30453905_1_studio-and-composer-song-sony-music| title = Dhanush: Never expected 'Kolaveri di' to become such a rage | newspaper = Times of India |date= 29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/cinema/article2650957.ece | title=Why this ‘Why this Kolaveri’? | newspaper= The Hindu | date= 23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=[[British Council]]|url=https://www.britishcouncil.org/voices-magazine/ten-surprising-expressions-indian-english|title=Ten surprising expressions in Indian English|author=Steven Baker|date=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tamil diasporas===
Use of Tanglish, or [[code-switching]] between Tamil and English, has been reported among Tamil-speaking immigrant populations in [[Malaysia]] and [[Canada]], particularly by young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/10/2/nation/9617920&amp;sec=nation |title=Penang’s link with ocean made waves |last=Vinesh |first=Derrick |newspaper=The Star |date=2 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208175811/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2011%2F10%2F2%2Fnation%2F9617920&amp;sec=nation |archivedate=8 December 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Between text and talk: Expertise, normativity, and scales of belonging in the Montreal Tamil diasporas | last=Das |first=Sonja Neela |type=Dissertation |publisher=University of Michigan | date=2008 |isbn=978-0-549-98093-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ugM709btsrgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
A study of code switching in everyday speech in Tamil Nadu found that English words are commonly inserted into sentences that otherwise follow Tamil [[syntax]].&lt;ref name=Kanthimathi2009/&gt;

A characteristic of Tanglish or Tamil-English code-switching is the addition of Tamil affixes to English words.&lt;ref name=Kanthimathi2009/&gt; The sound "u" is added at the end of an English [[noun]] to create a Tamil noun form, as in "sound''u''" and the words "girl-u heart-u black-u" in the lyrics of "Why This Kolaveri Di".&lt;ref name=Kanthimathi2009&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.educ.utas.edu.au/users/tle/JOURNAL/issues/2009/27-6.pdf |journal=The International Journal of Language Society and Culture |title=Tamil-English Mixed Language Used in Tamilnadu |first=K. |last=Kanthimathi |issue=27 |pages=48–53 |year=2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617075649/http://www.educ.utas.edu.au/users/tle/JOURNAL/issues/2009/27-6.pdf |archivedate=2012-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/28/why-this-kolaveri-di_n_1117726.html |work=Huffington Post | date=28 November 2011 | title= 'Why This Kolaveri Di': India's Latest Viral Hit |last=Rao | first=Mallika }}&lt;/ref&gt; English [[noun]]s often are combined with Tamil [[case (grammar)|case]] markers, as in "journey''ai''", "driver''kku''" ([[dative case]], used to mean "for the driver"), and "teacher''oda''". [[Verb]]s and some nouns from the English language are converted to Tamil verb forms by adding Tamil verbalizers that indicate [[verb tense]]. For example, the Tamil "''paNNu''" is added to the English verb "drive", resulting in "drive ''paNNu''", used to mean "do the driving".&lt;ref name=Kanthimathi2009/&gt; Another pattern that has been noted by speakers or observers of Tanglish is the addition of the syllable "fy" at the end of a Tamil word (e.g., ''maati''fy, ''Kalaachi''fy).&lt;ref name=EnterTang/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1841gs_pandiyanaadu-making-of-fy-fy-fy-kalaachify-song_music Music composed by D.Imman "Fy Fy Fy Kalaachify"  by Remya Nambeesan from "Pandiya Naadu" Tamil Movie]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:West Antarctic Collapse.ogv|thumb|A collage of footage and animation to explain the changes that are occurring on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, narrated by glaciologist [[Eric Rignot]]]]

The '''Western Antarctic Ice Sheet''' (WAIS) is the segment of the [[Antarctic ice sheet|continental ice sheet]] that covers [[West Antarctica|West (or Lesser) Antarctica]], the portion of [[Antarctica]] on the side of the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] which lies in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. The WAIS is classified as a marine-based [[ice sheet]], meaning that its bed lies well below [[sea level]] and its edges flow into floating ice shelves. The WAIS is bounded by the [[Ross Ice Shelf]], the [[Ronne Ice Shelf]], and outlet [[glacier]]s that drain into the [[Amundsen Sea]].

==General==
{{See also|Ice sheet dynamics}}
It is estimated that the volume of the Antarctic ice sheet is about 25.4 million km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (6.1 million cu mi), and the WAIS contains just under 10% of this, or 2.2 million km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (530,000 cu mi).&lt;ref name="JGR-06-2001"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lythe | first1 = Matthew B. | last2 = Vaughan | first2 = David G. | date = June 2001 | title = BEDMAP: A new ice thickness and subglacial topographic model of Antarctica | journal = Journal of Geophysical Research | volume = 106 | issue = B6 | pages = 11335–11352 | doi = 10.1029/2000JB900449 | bibcode=2001JGR...10611335L}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weight of the ice has caused the underlying rock to sink by between {{convert|0.5|and|1|km|mi|abbr=off}}&lt;ref name="Anderson1999"&gt;{{cite book| last = Anderson | first = John B. | year = 1999 | title = Antarctic marine geology | page = 59 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 0-521-59317-4 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=f9YqF73oe4IC}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a process known as [[Isostasy|isostatic depression]].

Under the force of its own weight, the ice sheet deforms and flows. The interior ice flows slowly over rough [[bedrock]]. In some circumstances, ice can flow faster in [[ice stream]]s, separated by slow-flowing ice ridges. The inter-stream ridges are frozen to the bed while the bed beneath the ice streams consists of water-saturated [[sediment]]s. Many of these sediments were deposited before the ice sheet occupied the region, when much of West Antarctica was covered by the ocean. The rapid ice-stream flow is a non-linear process still not fully understood; streams can start and stop for unclear reasons.{{CN|date=August 2018}}

When ice reaches the coast, it either [[Ice calving|calves]] or continues to flow outward onto the water. The result is a large, floating [[ice shelf]] affixed to the continent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asoc.org/general/iceshelve.htm Ice Shelves], Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060203051802/http://www.asoc.org/general/iceshelve.htm |date=February 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ice mass loss==
Indications that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is losing mass at an increasing rate come from the [[Amundsen Sea]] sector, and three glaciers in particular: the [[Pine Island Glacier|Pine Island]], [[Thwaites Glacier|Thwaites]] and [[Smith Glacier]]s.&lt;ref name="Rignot2008"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1029/2008GL033365| last1 = Rignot| first1 = E.| year = 2008| title = Changes in West Antarctic ice stream dynamics observed with ALOS PALSAR data| journal = [[Geophysical Research Letters]]| volume = 35| issue = 12| pages = L12505| pmid = | pmc = | bibcode = 2008GeoRL..3512505R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data reveals they are losing more ice than is being replaced by snowfall. According to a preliminary analysis, the difference between the mass lost and mass replaced is about 60%. The melting of these three glaciers alone is contributing an estimated {{convert|0.24|mm|in|abbr=off}} per year to the rise in the worldwide sea level.&lt;ref name="NS-2-2-05" /&gt; There is growing evidence that this trend is accelerating: there has been a 75% increase in Antarctic ice mass loss in the ten years 1996–2006, with glacier acceleration a primary cause.&lt;ref name="RignotBamber2008"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1038/ngeo102| last1 = Rignot| first1 = E.| last2 = Bamber | first2 = J.

Satellite measurements by ESA’s [[CryoSat-2]] revealed that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is losing more than {{convert|150|km3|mi3|abbr=off}} of ice each year. The loss is especially pronounced at [[Ice shelf|grounding lines]], the area where the floating ice shelf meets the part resting on bedrock, and hence affects the ice shelf stability and flow rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antarctica’s ice loss on the rise|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/CryoSat/Antarctica_s_ice_loss_on_the_rise|author=ESA|date=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potential collapse===
{{See also|Marine Ice Sheet Instability}}
Large parts of the WAIS sit on a bed which is both below sea level and sloping downward inland.&lt;ref name="upslope" group="upper-alpha"&gt;In this case, the ice is effectively moving upslope towards the sea.&lt;/ref&gt; This slope, and the low [[Isostasy|isostatic]] head, mean that the ice sheet is theoretically unstable: a small retreat could in theory destabilize the entire WAIS, leading to rapid disintegration. Current [[ice sheet model|computer models]] do not account well for the complicated and uncertain physics necessary to simulate this process, and observations do not provide guidance, so predictions as to its rate of retreat remain uncertain. This has been known for decades.&lt;ref name="Hughes1981"&gt;

In January 2006, in a UK government-commissioned report, the head of the [[British Antarctic Survey]], [[Chris Rapley]], warned that this huge West Antarctic Ice Sheet may be starting to disintegrate. It has been hypothesised that this disintegration could raise sea levels by approximately {{convert|3.3|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Bamber2009"&gt;

"I would say it is now an awakened giant. There is real concern." &lt;ref name="NS-2-2-05"&gt;Jenny Hogan, [https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6962 "Antarctic ice sheet is an 'awakened giant'"], ''New Scientist'', February 2, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapley said, "Parts of the Antarctic ice sheet that rest on bedrock below sea level have begun to discharge ice fast enough to make a significant contribution to [[sea level rise]]. Understanding the reason for this change is urgent in order to be able to predict how much ice may ultimately be discharged and over what timescale. Current computer models do not include the effect of liquid water on ice sheet sliding and flow, and so provide only conservative estimates of future behaviour." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innovations-report.com/html/reports/earth_sciences/report-55525.html "West Antarctic ice sheet: Waking the sleeping giant?"], Symposium, February 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Polar ice experts from the US and UK met at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in March, 2007 for the West Antarctic Links to Sea-Level Estimation (WALSE) Workshop.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/news/2007/05/statement-thinning-of-west-antarctic-ice-sheet-demands-improved-monitoring-to-reduce-uncertainty-over-potential-sea-level-rise/|title=Statement: Thinning of West Antarctic Ice Sheet Demands Improved Monitoring to Reduce Uncertainty over Potential Sea-Level Rise|website=Jsg.utexas.edu|accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experts discussed a new hypothesis that explains the observed increased melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. They proposed that changes in air circulation patterns have led to increased upwelling of warm, deep ocean water along the coast of Antarctica and that this warm water has increased melting of floating [[Ice shelf|ice shelves]] at the edge of the ice sheet.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; An ocean model has shown how changes in winds can help channel the water along deep troughs on the sea floor, toward the ice shelves of outlet glaciers.&lt;ref name="ThomaJenkins2008"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1029/2008GL034939| last1 = Thoma | first1 = M.| last2 = Jenkins | first2 = A.| last3 = Holland | first3 = D.| last4 = Jacobs | first4 = S.| year = 2008| title = Modelling Circumpolar Deep Water intrusions on the Amundsen Sea continental shelf, Antarctica| journal = [[Geophysical Research Letters]]| volume = 35| issue = 18| page = L18602| pmid = | pmc = | bibcode = 2008GeoRL..3518602T}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact cause of the changes in circulation patterns is not known and they may be due to natural variability. However, this connection between the atmosphere and upwelling of deep ocean water provides a mechanism by which human induced climate changes could cause an accelerated loss of ice from the WAIS.&lt;ref name="ThomaJenkins2008" /&gt; Recently published data collected from satellites support this hypothesis, suggesting that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is beginning to show signs of instability.&lt;ref name="Rignot2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaufman&gt;Kaufman, Mark (2008) "Escalating Ice Loss Found in Antarctica: Sheets Melting in an Area Once Thought to Be Unaffected by Global Warming" ''Washington Post'' (January 14) p.

In 2016, improved computer modeling revealed that the breakup of glaciers could lead to a steep rise in sea levels much more quickly than previously projected. “We’re in danger of handing young people a situation that’s out of their control,” according to James E. Hansen, the leader of a number of climate scientists who worked together to compile the study.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Gillis (March 22, 2016) [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/23/science/global-warming-sea-level-carbon-dioxide-emissions.html "Scientists Warn of Perilous Climate Shift Within Decades, Not Centuries"] ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warming==
The West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) has warmed by more than {{convert|0.1|C-change}}/decade in the last fifty years, and the warming is the strongest in winter and spring. Although this is partly offset by fall cooling in [[East Antarctica]], this effect was restricted to the 1980s and 1990s. The continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is positive and [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] at &gt;{{convert|0.05|C-change}}/decade since 1957.&lt;ref name="SteigSchneider2009"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1038/nature07669| last1 = Steig| first1 = E. J.| last2 = Schneider | first2 = D. P.| last3 = Rutherford | first3 = S. D.| last4 = Mann | first4 = M. E.| last5 = Comiso | first5 = J. C.| last6 = Shindell | first6 = D.

In 2012, the temperature records for the ice sheet were reanalyzed with a conclusion that since 1958, the West Antarctic ice sheet had warmed by {{convert|2.4|C-change}}, almost double the previous estimate. Some scientists now fear that the WAIS could now collapse like the [[Larsen B Ice Shelf]] did in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20804192|title=West Antarctic Ice Sheet warming twice earlier estimate|author=Matt McGrath|date=23 December 2012|accessdate=16 February 2013|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The possible disastrous outcome of a disintegration of the WAIS for global sea levels has been mentioned and assessed in the [[IPCC Third Assessment Report]] but was left out in the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]]. Jessica O'Reilly, [[Naomi Oreskes]] and [[Michael Oppenheimer]] discussed the case in a [[Social Studies of Science]] paper 2012. According to them, IPCC authors were less certain about potential WAIS disintegration not only due to external new science results. As well pure internal "cultural" reasons, as changes of staff within the IPCC and externally, made it too difficult to project the range of possible futures for the WAIS as required.&lt;ref name=ore&gt;The Rapid Disintegration of Projections: The West Antarctic Ice Sheet and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [[Jessica O'Reilly]] [[Naomi Oreskes]], [[Michael Oppenheimer]] Social Studies of Science June 26, 2012, doi: 10.1177/0306312712448130&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mike Hulme]] saw the issue as a showcase to urge for the integration of minority views in the IPCC and other major assessment processes.&lt;ref name=hu&gt;Mike Hulme, [http://www.csap.cam.ac.uk/media/uploads/files/1/fdsaw.pdf "Lessons from the IPCC: do scientific assessments need to be consensual to be authoritative?"] in (eds.)

The '''Western Base Party''' was a successful exploration party of the [[Australasian Antarctic Expedition]]. The eight-man Western Party was deposited by the [[SY Aurora|Aurora]] on the [[Shackleton Ice Shelf]] at [[Queen Mary Land]].&lt;ref name="douglas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.south-pole.com/p0000099.htm |title=Douglas Mawson 1882-1958  |accessdate=2008-06-02 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The leader of the team was [[Frank Wild]] and the party included the geologist [[Charles Hoadley]].
  
The party established the [[Queen Mary Land|Queen Mary Land Station]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} An early setback was the destruction of the radio mast in the first blizzard.&lt;ref name="douglas" /&gt; Severe weather impeded activities as did dangerous crevices. The team sent an expedition into [[Kaiser Wilhelm II Land]].

The party had no supplies for a second winter. The Western Base Party was collected on February 23, 1913 by the Aurora, with no loss of life.&lt;ref name="douglas" /&gt;

==Discoveries==
The Western Base Party made a number of discoveries including;
* [[Adams Island (Antarctica)|Adams Island]]
* [[Bay of Winds]]
* [[Cape Penck]]
* [[Cape Hoadley]]
* [[Cape Hordern]]
* [[Denman Glacier]]
* [[Pobeda Ice Island]]
* [[Farr Bay]] (discovered in November 1912)
* [[Henderson Island (Shackleton Ice Shelf)|Henderson Island]] (discovered in August 1912)
* [[Hippo Island]]
* [[Scott Glacier (East Antarctica)|Scott Glacier]]
* [[Mount Sandow]]
* [[Mount Amundsen]]

[[Drygalski Island]] was first sited by the Western Base Party but it was not until the return voyage of Australasian Antarctic Expedition that the island was accurately identified.

[[A.L. Kennedy (cartographer)|A.L. Kennedy]] was cartographer of the expedition.  He was later honored by the [[Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names]] (US-ACAN)'s naming of [[Kennedy Peak (Antarctica)]] for him, in recognition of the close correlation of his 1912–13 [[running survey]] of the eastern half of the [[Queen Mary Coast]] with the US-ACAN map of 1955 compiled from aerial photographs.&lt;ref name=gnis-Kennedy&gt;{{cite gnis | type = antarid | id = 7861| name = Kennedy Peak | accessdate = 2013-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Chairman of the Committee was Prince [[Georgy Lvov]], a representative of the [[Constitutional Democratic party]]. The organization was disbanded by [[Bolshevik]]s in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanities.edu.ru/db/msg/38061 Zemgor] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110052718/http://www.humanities.edu.ru/db/msg/38061 |date=November 10, 2007 }} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While disbanded in Russia, a number of emigrated former functionaries decided to reestablish the organization with the same abbreviated name, Zemgor, and in 1921 it was officially registered in [[Paris]] as an organization helping Russian emigrants. Its official names were Российский Земско-городской комитет помощи российским гражданам за границей in Russian and ''Comite des Zemstvos et Municipalités Russes de Secours des Citoyens russes à l'étranger'' in French.
