He was the [[Secretary-General of the Government of the Republic of Slovenia]] since 1986 till 1992, during the Slovenian proclamation of independence in 1991. Since 1992, he worked in the retail company [[Mercator (retail)|Mercator]], and was since 1997 till 2005 member of its executive board. He was elected to the city council of the [[City Municipality of Ljubljana]] in October 2006 as a member of the [[Zoran Janković List]] and was named by [[Zoran Janković (politician)|Janković]] a [[deputy mayor]] of the municipality.&lt;ref name="AČMOL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ljubljana.si/si/mol/podzupani/408/detail.html |title=Aleš Čerin |language=Slovenian |publisher=City Municipality of Ljubljana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Robelo found that the real power lay with the FSLN National Directorate.

After resigning from the Junta on April 22, 1981, Robelo went into exile in 1982. He brought his MDN into [[Edén Pastora]]'s rebel [[Democratic Revolutionary Alliance]]. Later, he split with Pastora, and joined the [[United Nicaraguan Opposition]] (UNO) with [[Arturo Cruz]], and [[Adolfo Calero]] of the [[Nicaraguan Democratic Force]]. After UNO's collapse, he joined the directorate of the new [[Contras|Contra]] umbrella group, the [[Nicaraguan Resistance]].

During the political turmoil, Robelo's first marriage, to Indiana Cardenal Caldera, ended in divorce. They had four children: Indiana Margarita, Luis Alfonso (who died at a year and a half old), Eliza, and Alejandra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.euram.com.ni/pverdes/entrevista/indiana_cardenal_caldera.htm |title=Indiana Cardenal Caldera |access-date=2008-02-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108013130/http://www.euram.com.ni/pverdes/entrevista/indiana_cardenal_caldera.htm |archive-date=2008-01-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He remarried a Costa Rican.

Following the [[Esquipulas Peace Agreement|Esquipulas accord]], President [[Oscar Arias]] of Costa Rica announced in January 1988 that Contra leaders could no longer live in his country. With his pregnant wife opposing a move from Costa Rica, he resigned from the directorate in early February.

The post-Sandinista government of [[Violeta Chamorro]] appointed Robelo to be ambassador to Costa Rica. In 1993, he was taken hostage during a standoff at the embassy.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Former member of the RN Directorate.  Politician, businessman.  Born in Leon on October 11, 1939.  Earned a degree in chemical engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (Troy, N.Y.) in 1961.  Rector of the University of Central America 1970-1972 and President of the Nicaraguan Chamber of Commerce until 1975.  He then headed the Nicaraguan Development Institute, long active in the development of independent agricultural and small business cooperatives.  Following the assassination of La Prensa editor [[Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal|Pedro Joaquin Chamorro]], Robelo cofounded the Nicaraguan Democratic Movement, a social-democratic political party of businessmen, industrialists, and professionals opposed to the Somoza regime.  A leader and main spokesman for FAO working openly against the Somoza regime, he was arrested and publicly labeled a "subversive" by Somoza.  After the revolution Robelo was one of the five members of the original 1979 post-Somoza junta.  Resigned in April 1980 because of the Marxist tendencies in the FSLN-dominated government and the growing Cuban influence in the country.  Became President of the Democratic Coordinating Board.  Harassed by the FSLN after his resignation from the junta and detained by the Sandinistas when he sought to travel abroad in 1982, he was finally forced into exile later that year, and his property was confiscated.  In 1982, he joined with Edén Pastora and others in founding the ARDE, seeking to achieve the original democratic goals of the revolution.  Robelo was elected to the Nicaraguan Resistance Directorate in May 1987.  Resigned from the RN Directorate in January 1988.

'''Alfredo Fortabat''' (1894 &amp;ndash; January 19, 1976) was a prominent Argentine industrialist.

==Life and times==
Alfredo Fortabat was born in [[Azul, Buenos Aires|Azul]], a small city in [[Buenos Aires Province]], in 1894; his parents, Helene Pourtal and Lucien Fortabat, were recently arrived [[French Argentine]]s. Lucien Fortabat was named Director of Azul's important French language school and later Director of the ''Banco Comercial'', which enabled his son, Alfredo, to attend the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. The elder Fortabat died in 1921, however, and upon Alfredo's return in 1924, local [[cement kiln]] owners encouraged him to invest in the growing industry.&lt;ref name=rn&gt;[http://www.rionegro.com.ar/suple_economico/05-04-30/nota2.php ''Río Negro'': La trama de la venta del grupo Fortabat {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1926 discovery of large [[limestone]] deposits at the San Jacinto Estancia inherited from his father led Fortabat to open a cement factory in the nearby [[pampas]] hamlet of Loma Negra (south of [[Olavarría]]); the choice of location prompted him to christen the company ''[[Loma Negra]]'' (''"Black Mound"''). The cement plant was built in 1927, and Fortabat protected his venture in its early years partly by buying voting shares in competitors' boards.&lt;ref name=rn/&gt;&lt;ref name=loma&gt;[http://www.lomanegra.com.ar/index_loma.htm Loma Negra: historia {{es icon}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801052352/http://www.lomanegra.com.ar/index_loma.htm |date=2009-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fortabat, whose marriage to Magdalena Corti Maderna ended in divorce, met a young [[Buenos Aires]] heiress, [[María Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat|Amalia Lacroze]], during a 1941 [[Teatro Colón]] function, and the two began a relationship. Planning to wed, they were impeded by Argentina's then-conservative nuptial laws, which precluded separated couples from remarrying.  The marriage, which ultimately took place in neighboring [[Uruguay]], became recognized in Argentina following a reform signed into law by President [[Juan Perón]], in 1951. Mrs. Fortabat's gregariousness and knowledge of four foreign languages helped create a close business partnership as well as marriage, though it later suffered from a number of publicly reported infidelities.&lt;ref name=actual&gt;[http://www.articlearchives.com/south-america/argentina-buenos-aires-argentina/447105-1.html Colín, Julia. "Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat." ''Actual'' (6/1/1999) {{es icon}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612050224/http://www.articlearchives.com/south-america/argentina-buenos-aires-argentina/447105-1.html |date=2009-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loma Negra grew alongside the [[Argentine economy]]; by the early 1950s, the company produced 500,000 tons of cement annually and accounted for 70% of the cement sold to the Ministry of Public Works, for instance (his prominence as a building materials supplier during the Perón years triggered investigations against Loma Negra following the populist leader's 1955 overthrow, though charges were later dropped).&lt;ref name=rn/&gt; New facilities in the [[Andes]]-range cities of [[San Juan, Argentina|San Juan]] and [[Zapala]], opened during the 1960s, made Loma Negra the leader in cement and concrete production nationally.&lt;ref name=loma/&gt; 

The industrialist invested generously in employee housing and in 1930, established a largely self-contained community adjacent the cement works ("Villa Alfredo Fortabat").&lt;ref name=loma/&gt; The proprietor of 160,000 hectares (400,000 acres) of prime [[pampas]] land in his later years, he established the charitable Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat Foundation, in 1971.&lt;ref name=rn/&gt;

Alfredo Fortabat died in Buenos Aires on January 19, 1976, upon which his widow became the President and nearly sole owner of [[Loma Negra]].

'''Alibhai Mulla Jeevanjee''' (1856–1936) was an Indian [[merchant]], politician and philanthropist who went on to play a large role in the development of modern day [[Kenya]] during colonial rule.

==Early life==
Jevanjee was born in Karachi, then part of the [[Bombay Presidency]] in [[India]] to [[Shia]] [[Dawoodi Bohra]] parents who traced back to the western state of present-day [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref name="Challengeto"&gt;Challenge to Colonialism: The Struggle of Alibhai Mulla Jeevanjee for Equal Rights in Kenya by Zarina Patel Review by: James R. Brennan The International Journal of African Historical Studies , Vol. 34, No. 2 (2001), pp. 433–435&lt;/ref&gt; He received minimal education and upon the death of his father embarked on a career as an itinerant peddler, trekking across India and Australia before settling in East Africa.&lt;ref name="Challengeto" /&gt;

==Business==
In 1895, A.M. Jeevanjee of Karachi&amp;nbsp;— as he was called at the time, was awarded the contract to supply the [[Imperial British East Africa Company]] with labour as they built the [[Kenya-Uganda Railway]]. He imported his workforce from the [[Gujarat, British India|Gujarat]] region of British India. The first group to arrive had a total of 350 men and the number grew for the next six years to reach a total of 31,895. Most of the workforce were [[Sikh]]s, [[Hindu]]s and [[Muslims]] who worked as skilled labourers, [[artisan]]s, [[bricklayer]]s, [[carpenters]], [[plumbers]], tailors, [[Mechanic|motor mechanics]] and electrical fitters.&lt;ref name="IIAS Newsletter"&gt;{{cite web|last=Amarjit|first=Chandan|title=Punjabis in East Africa|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/12793/IIAS_NL43_1819.pdf?sequence=1|work=IAS Newsletter|accessdate=29 July 2012|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the railway proved hugely profitable for Jevanjee and his newly set office in [[Mombasa]] ventured into other business interests in the region. His firm undertook contracts to build various government offices, [[railway stations]] and post offices all along the Mombasa-Kisumu railway. He further played a large role in the growth of Nairobi, supplying much capital to develop the town's infrastructure.

==Politics==
When construction of the [[Kenya-Uganda Railway]] reached [[lake Victoria]], Jeevanjee began taking an active role in political life, and launched the African Standard which was a [[weekly newspaper]]. He had hired an editor-reporter, W.H. Tiller whose work was to oversee the operations of the newspaper. In 1905, he sold the newspaper to two British businessmen who renamed it to [[East African Standard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coastweek.com/3923-kul-bhushan-golden-Century-of-the-Indian-Journalism-Saga-in-Kenya.htm|title=Coastweek - The most from the coast|last=Kenya|first=Coastweek|website=www.coastweek.com|access-date=2017-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1910 the paper became a [[Daily newspaper#Daily|daily newspaper]] and it moved its headquarters to Nairobi which was a fast developing commercial center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/562965/The-Standard#ref754408 |title=The Standard (Kenyan newspaper) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |first= |last= |work=britannica.com |year=2012 |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, he was the first non-white appointed to represent the interests of the Indians in the Legislative Council (Legco) which was established that same year. He also established the East African Indian National Congress.

==Jeevanjee gardens==
He started building the [[Jeevanjee Gardens]] in 1904 which he later donated to the people of Nairobi in 1906 as a place to relax.&lt;ref name="Patel2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Zarina Patel|title=Alibhai Mulla Jeevanjee|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LD8OBiNV_l8C|accessdate=29 July 2012|year=2002|publisher=East African Publishers|isbn=978-9966-25-111-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These gardens became the subject in the news headlines in 1991 where some leaders in authority were purporting to turn it into a commercial plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.awaazmagazine.com/index.php/archives/item/128-the-struggle-to-preserve-jeevanjee-gardens?tmpl=component&amp;print=1 |title=The Struggle to Preserve Jeevanjee Gardens |first=Zarina |last=Patel |date=31 October 2011 |work=awaazmagazine.com |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There had been a proposed construction of a [[Multi-storey car park]] which was against the wish of Jeevanjee. The youngest remaining daughter of Jeevanjee, the late Shirin Najmudean moved to Nairobi to stop the planned development on the piece of land.

'''Arthur Chevrolet''', (April 25, 1884 &amp;ndash; April 16, 1946) was a [[Swiss]] racecar driver and automobile manufacturer.

==Biography==
Born in [[La Chaux-de-Fonds]], [[Canton of Neuchâtel|Neuchatel]], Switzerland, Arthur was the middle brother of [[Louis Chevrolet]] (1878–1941), founder of the [[Chevrolet]] car company; and [[Gaston Chevrolet]] (1892–1920). After brother Louis immigrated to [[United States|America]] and earned enough money, he sent for Gaston and Arthur to join him. Once there, Arthur worked as an automotive mechanic and joined his brothers in auto racing. In 1911, he competed in the inaugural [[Indianapolis 500]] but had to drop out after 30 laps when his [[Buick]] developed mechanical problems.

In 1916, the year after older brother Louis left the Chevrolet car company that he had co-founded, Arthur Chevrolet became a partner with Louis and Gaston in the new [[Frontenac Motor Corporation]].

Driving a Frontenac, Arthur qualified for the Indianapolis 500 again in 1916, but was forced out after 35 laps when the car developed [[ignition magneto]] problems. His driving career ended during practice rounds for the 1920 Indianapolis 500 when he was severely injured in a crash. Brother Gaston won that year's race in a Frontenac, but Gaston was killed in a California race a few months later.

In 1928, Arthur filed with the US Patent Office for an 'Overhead Valve Engine'.  Patent #1,744,526 was awarded on January 21, 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=US Patent Office|title=Arthur E. Chevrolet - Overhead-Valve Engine|url=http://patimg1.uspto.gov/.piw?docid=01744526&amp;SectionNum=3&amp;IDKey=11BE65FADB9F&amp;HomeUrl=http://pimg-piw.uspto.gov/|accessdate=2012-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929 Arthur and Louis Chevrolet left the auto business altogether to form the Chevrolet Brothers Aircraft Company with a new engine of their design (Chevrolair).  The business was unsuccessful and was eventually taken over by investors. Arthur and Louis returned to automobiles, becoming pioneer leaders in the development of [[sprint car|sprint]] type race cars. In 1990 Arthur and his brother were inducted to the inaugural class of the [[National Sprint Car Hall of Fame &amp; Museum]].

In 1942 Arthur Chevrolet retired to [[Slidell, Louisiana]]. Suffering from depression, he committed suicide by hanging in 1946, only nine days shy of his 62nd birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Last Of Chevrolet Brothers Kills Self . |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZDwbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ak0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4439,6207642&amp;dq=william+durant&amp;hl=en |quote= |newspaper=[[United Press]] in The Pittsburgh Press |date= April 18, 1946|accessdate=2012-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur Chevrolet has long been thought to be interred next to his brothers in the [[Holy Cross and Saint Joseph Cemetery]] in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]. A headstone was placed at the grave in 2011 to memorialize his life by the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] on the 100th anniversary of the founding of the [[Chevrolet Motor Company]]. The ''[[St. Tammany News]]''  (which ceased operations in early 2013) revealed in a series of articles in late August 2012 that Arthur was not buried in [[Holy Cross and St. Joseph Cemetery]] as previously believed but is most likely in a lost and unmarked grave in Our Lady of Lourdes Cemetery in the city where he died, [[Slidell, Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theadvocate.com/new_orleans/news/article_b07ee0b4-5dc7-11e7-a0e5-0b9722e26667.html ''The Advocate'']&lt;/ref&gt; The grave thought to be that of Arthur Chevrolet for many years is in fact his son, Arthur Chevrolet Jr. who died at 23 years old in November 1931, 15 years prior to Arthur Sr. death. The actual location of Arthur Chevrolet, Sr. grave is yet to be known as of this date.

'''Artisans du monde''' is a [[France|French]] network of local [[fair trade]] associations, currently the most important non-profit fair trade movement in France. The first associations were founded in 1974, and their number then increased to reach 170 today. Most of them manage local fair trade shops (also called [[worldshop]]s), but their tasks include also awareness raising activities, and educational interventions in schools. 

The '''Fédération Artisans du Monde''', a non-profit federation of all the local associations based in [[Paris]], represents them and coordinates their activities. It owns the majority of the capital of [[Solidar'Monde]], a fair trade corporation which provides most of the products sold in the local shops of the Artisans du Monde network. The Fédération Artisans du Monde is a member of the French [[Plate-forme française pour le commerce équitable]], and of the [[World Fair Trade Organization]].

'''Aw Boon-Par''' ({{zh|c=胡文豹|p=Hú Wénbào|poj=Hô͘ Bûn-pà}}; 1888 in [[Rangoon]], [[Indian Empire]] – 1944 in Rangoon, [[British Burma|Burma]]) was a [[Burmese Chinese]] entrepreneur and philanthropist best known for introducing [[Tiger Balm]].

He was a son of [[Hakka people|Hakka]] [[herbalist]] [[Aw Chu-Kin]].&lt;ref name="Beverland"&gt;Beverland, Michael (2009) ''Building Brand Authenticity: 7 Habits of Iconic Brands'' Palgrave Macmillan, Basingstoke, Hampshire, England, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SBzRiXcwLh8C&amp;pg=PA91 page 91], {{ISBN|978-0-230-58031-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Temporal, Paul (2006) ''Asia's star brands'' Wiley, Singapore, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uosHgKOy63UC&amp;pg=PA116 page 116], {{ISBN|0-470-82156-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father left the business to Boon-Par and after Aw Chu-Kin's death in 1908, he called his elder brother [[Aw Boon-Haw]] to run his father's [[apothecary]] Eng Aun Tong ("The Hall of Eternal Peace") together.

Although Aw wished to stay in Rangoon, his brother who had settled in [[Singapore]]&lt;ref&gt;Go, Simon (2003) ''Hong Kong apothecary: a visual history of Chinese medicine packaging'' Princeton Architectural Press, New York, page 198, {{ISBN|1-56898-390-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1926 convinced him to immigrate, move the family business and found the precursor of today's [[Haw Par Corporation]]. During the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore]], Boon-Haw moved to [[Hong Kong]] to manage the business from there, while Boon-Par stayed in Singapore to run the factory. Eventually, Aw closed the factory down, returned to Rangoon, and died there.

'''''Boomerang: Travels in the New Third World''''' is a non-fiction book by [[Michael Lewis (author)|Michael Lewis]] about macroeconomic consequences of cheap financing available during the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13707738-boomerang|publisher=[[goodreads.com]]|title=Boomerang: Travels in the New Third World|accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was released on October 3, 2011 by [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Boomerang-Travels-New-Third-World/dp/0393081818/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1393416951&amp;sr=1-1|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|title=Boomerang: Travels in the New Third World Hardcover by Michael Lewis|accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
The text focuses on the themes discussed in his previous book, ''[[The Big Short]]'', and is based on the articles that Lewis wrote for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/27/books/boomerang-by-michael-lewis-review.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|publisher=[[nytimes.com]]|title=Touring the Ruins of the Old Economy|first=Michiko|last=Kakutani|date=September 26, 2011 |accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{quote|In his new book on the seemingly permanent financial crisis, Boomerang: Travels in the New Third World, Lewis shows again why he is the leading journalist of his generation. He writes about important matters — the most important matters — and he writes about them so amusingly that he can permanently change your point of view, even of things you already had a settled opinion about. Who sees baseball the same way after his Moneyball? Football announcers seldom talked about the immense importance of the left tackle before The Blind Side.

And, thanks to “Boomerang,” a collection of financial-disaster reports from Iceland, Ireland, Greece, Germany and California, few will be able to think of Germans without recalling what Lewis memorably describes as a national obsession with excrement. In typical Lewis fashion, a bodily aperture becomes a lens for seeing Germany’s role in the global debt calamity.}}

—Review by ''[[Forbes]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kylesmith/2011/09/28/book-review-boomerang-by-michael-lewis/|title=Book Review: Boomerang, By Michael Lewis|publisher=[[forbes.com]]|accessdate=2015-02-28|first=Kyle|last=Smith|date=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Michael Lewis possesses the rare storyteller’s ability to make virtually any subject both lucid and compelling. In his new book, “Boomerang,” he actually makes topics like European sovereign debt, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank not only comprehensible but also fascinating — even, or especially, to readers who rarely open the business pages or watch CNBC. The book could not be more timely given the worries about Europe’s deepening debt crisis and the recent warning issued by Christine Lagarde, managing director of the I.M.F, that “the current economic situation is entering a dangerous phase.”}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19467">'''Criminal syndicalism''' has been defined as a doctrine of criminal acts for political, industrial, and social change.  These criminal acts include advocation of crime, sabotage, violence, and other unlawful methods of terrorism.&lt;ref name="US Legal, Inc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Syndicalism Law &amp; Legal Definition|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/c/criminal-syndicalism/|publisher=US Legal, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal syndicalism laws were enacted to oppose economic radicalism.&lt;ref&gt;White, Ahmed A. "The Crime of Economic Radicalism: Criminal Syndicalism Laws and the Industrial Workers of the World, 1917–1927." Oregon Law Review 85, no. 3 (2006): 652. Accessed November 24, 2014. https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1794/5046/853white.pdf?sequence=1.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Idaho legislation defines it as, “the doctrine which advocates crime, sabotage, violence, or other unlawful methods of terrorism as a means of accomplishing industrial or political reform”.&lt;ref name="Anti-Radical Agitation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-Radical Agitation|url=http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre1935032800&amp;type=query&amp;num=criminal+syndicalism&amp;|publisher=CQ Press|accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key terms in criminal syndicalism statutes had vague definitions.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 652.&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal syndicalism became a matter of public attention during and after the World War I period, and has been used to stymie the efforts of radical labor movements.&lt;ref name=Idaho&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sims|first=Robert, C|title=Idaho's Criminal Syndicalism Act: One States Response to Radical Labor|journal=Labor History|year=1974|volume=15|issue=4|pages=511–527|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=6&amp;sid=97f94314-a47c-4869-8d62-d520de82fd21%40sessionmgr115&amp;hid=122&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=ahl&amp;AN=4558619|accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1910s, the public was hostile towards leftist ideologies and deemed social radicalism un-American. Government officials on the state and federal level ordered arrests, imprisonments  and killings of people who challenged industrial capitalism or made militant demands under the pre-existing economic structure.&lt;ref name="White, 650"&gt;White, p. 650.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the year 1933, over 700 convictions of criminal syndicalism were made.&lt;ref name="Anti-Radical Agitation" /&gt;  Organizations like the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] believe laws on criminal syndicalism were aimed to punish doctrines or memberships in unions.&lt;ref name="Anti-Radical Agitation" /&gt;

=== Industrial Workers of the World ===
Criminal Syndicalism laws were enacted to combat the efforts of radical labor unions. The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) is one such union in particular.&lt;ref name="Idaho"/&gt;&lt;ref name="White, 650"/&gt; Defining the labor efforts as criminal allowed for the government to stop the [[Wobblies]]' activities and the labor problem of World War I and post World War I altogether. Senator W.G. Walker of Idaho, the nation’s first state to enact a criminal syndicalism law, introduced the criminal syndicalism legislation to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] with an anti-IWW speech.&lt;ref name="Idaho"/&gt;

The IWW’s confrontational rhetoric factored into public concerns.&lt;ref name="White, 687"&gt;White, p. 687.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization used “sabotages” and military tactics in its invocation of social change.&lt;ref name="White, 687"/&gt; The public assumed the IWW promoted violence and destruction of properties even though the IWW did not share these intentions.&lt;ref name="White, 687"/&gt; The IWW’s later attempts at reducing enforcement efforts through distancing itself from this doctrine were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="White, 688"&gt;White, p. 688.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IWW’s opposition to [[United States in World War I|United States’ involvement in World War I]] was in contrast of public sentiment, leading to an unfavorable public opinion towards the organization.&lt;ref name="White, 688"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitten, Woodrow C. "Criminal Syndicalism and the Law in California: 1919-1927."Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 59, no. 2 (1969): 15. Accessed November 25, 2014. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1006021.&lt;/ref&gt;

Patriotic societies alleged that German gold financed IWW operations, and that the organization received support from hostile nations.&lt;ref&gt;Blasi, Vincent. "The First Amendment and the Ideal of Civic Courage: The Brandeis Opinion in Whitney v. California." William and Mary Law Review 29, no. 4 (1988): 655. Accessed November 24, 2014. http://www.lexisnexis.com/lnacui2api/api/version1/getDocCui?lni=3S3V-3SV0-00CW-G2NH&amp;csi=7413,270077&amp;hl=t&amp;hv=t&amp;hnsd=f&amp;hns=t&amp;hgn=t&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[red scare]] exacerbated public distrust and fear against all radical leftist organizations, including the IWW.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 696.&lt;/ref&gt; Strikes (involving over 4 million workers) across the nation increased negative sentiments against these organizations.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 697.&lt;/ref&gt;
Various bombings and bombing plots attributed to radical leftists caused the public to view radical leftist organizations as threats to state security.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 698.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitten, 13"&gt;Whitten, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
While repressions against the IWW through government actions and vigilantism were rampant, the public continued to perceive efforts to suppress the organization as insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 700.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defense by the IWW's [[General Defense Committee]] in the case of [[Fiske v. Kansas]] resulted in a critically important 1924 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling which led to the decline of criminal syndicalism laws as a factor in legislative anti-union initiatives.&lt;ref name="Cortner"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cortner |first=Richard C. |date=Spring 1981 |title=The Wobblies and Fiske v. Kansas: Victory Amidst Disintegration |journal=[[Kansas History: A Journal of the Central Plains|Kansas History]] |url=http://www.kshs.org/publicat/history/1981spring_cortner.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=[[Kansas Historical Society]] |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=30–38 |access-date=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislation ==

=== History ===
State government legislation has been made to address criminal syndicalism according to their own definitions.  States enacted criminal laws, the first of which was enacted in Idaho in 1917, or [[sedition]] law (operating basically in the same way as criminal syndicalism laws).&lt;ref name="Anti-Radical Agitation" /&gt;

During [[World War I]] and post-World War I, more than half the states passed these anti-radical statutes, most of which still remain in effect today.&lt;ref name="Anti-Radical Agitation" /&gt;

By 1935, there were a number of 33 states with remaining criminal syndicalism laws or sedition laws.&lt;ref name="Anti-Radical Agitation" /&gt;  Between the years 1918 and 1919 Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, and fourteen other states passed criminal syndicalism laws and between 1917 and 1923 thirteen states enacted sedition laws.&lt;ref name="Anti-Radical Agitation" /&gt;  Those states without Criminal Syndicalism laws or sedition laws during this period are noted to have had some similar already existing statutes against incitement and rebellion.

The degree of the consequences range from state to state.  Criminal Syndicalism laws called for maximum fines of $10,000 and a maximum 25-year prison sentence.&lt;ref name="Anti-Radical Agitation" /&gt;  Prosecutions under Criminal syndicalism laws ensued. The [[California Criminal Syndicalism Act|California Criminal Syndicalism Act of 1919]] alone, only five years after its enactment, was responsible for over 500 arrests and 164 convictions.&lt;ref name=Charlotte&gt;{{cite web|last=Urofsky|first=Melvin, I|title=Charlotte Anita Whitney, Whitney v. California: Free Speech for Radicals|url=http://library.cqpress.com/scc/amcons-228-9677-607867|publisher=SAGE Publications|accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This act was upheld by the [[United States Supreme Court]] on May 16, 1927 in the ''[[Whitney v. California]]'' case.&lt;ref name="Charlotte"/&gt;  The power of law against criminal syndicalism began to falter by the 1930s as the courts began to overturn convictions as either being no true threat to the US or by declaring the laws to be too vague or broad.&lt;ref name=Freedom&gt;{{cite web|last=Savage|first=David, G|title=Freedom of Political Association|url=http://library.cqpress.com/scc/gct5v1-1179-57464-2235286|publisher=SAGE Publications|accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such example was the court's overturning of the conviction of Dirk DeJonge due to protesting the police brutality in the longshoreman’s strike, as violating Oregon's criminal syndicalism law.&lt;ref name="Freedom of Speech"&gt;{{cite web|last=Savage|first=David G|title=Freedom of Speech|url=http://library.cqpress.com/scc/gct5v1-1179-57463-2235059|publisher=SAGE Publications|accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Idaho===

On February 19, 1917, the criminal syndicalism bill was introduced into the Idaho state legislature.&lt;ref name="Sims, 512"&gt;Sims, p. 512.&lt;/ref&gt;

Businesses which stood to lose the most at the hands of the IWW, including lumber and mining interests, lobbied for the statute’s enactment.&lt;ref name="Sims, 512"/&gt;  In March 1917, the Idaho state government enacted the statute.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 658.&lt;/ref&gt;   The Idaho criminal syndicalism bill served as a prototype for many other similar bills passed in various state legislatures in the following four years.&lt;ref name="Whitten, 13"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Robert Justin. Political Repression in Modern America from 1870 to 1976. Urbana: University of Illinois Press (2001): 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the rhetoric behind criminal syndicalism laws appealed strictly to business interests. After the United States entered the World War I, then Governor of Idaho Moses Alexander instilled nationalist rhetoric into the public discourse of the law while referring to the IWW’s opposition against United States’ participation in the war.&lt;ref&gt;Sims, p. 514.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, the Idaho legislature enacted a bill which outlawed non-violent attempts of sabotage; "work done in an improper manner, slack work, waste of property, and loitering at work" became illegal acts.&lt;ref&gt;Sims, p. 525.&lt;/ref&gt;  Organized labor opposed the amendment because the expanded definition of sabotage might be applied against recognized trade union practices.&lt;ref&gt;Sims, p. 526.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] rulings later limited the applicability of criminal syndicalism laws in Idaho, and criminal syndicalism laws in Idaho became a dead issue.&lt;ref&gt;Sims, p. 527.&lt;/ref&gt;

===California===
Criminal syndicalism in [[California]] was defined as "any doctrine or precept advocating . . . the commission of crime, sabotage . . . or unlawful acts of force and violence . . . as a means of accomplishing a change in industrial ownership or control, or effecting any political change.” 
Knowingly associating oneself with a group which advocates, teaches, or aids and abed criminal syndicalism could also lead to criminal liability under the California statute.&lt;ref name="Blasi, 655"&gt;Blasi, p. 655.&lt;/ref&gt;

Violators could be punished by up to fourteen years in jail.&lt;ref name="Blasi, 655"/&gt;

The bill’s enactment came after a series of events undermining IWW’s public image.&lt;ref&gt;Whitten, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 22, 1916, [[Preparedness Day Bombing|a bomb exploded in the Preparedness Day parade in San Francisco]]. It led to the arrests of [[Warren K Billings]] and [[Thomas Mooney]] – both of whom were associated with militant labor movement – and two others. The San Francisco public responded with an uproar.&lt;ref name="Whitten, 13"/&gt;

Fresno and Riverside agricultural strikes took place in 1917, months preceding the California criminal syndicalism bill’s first introduction.&lt;ref&gt;Whitten, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attempt of inducting the criminal syndicalism bill into the California law took place in 1917. The bill was a copy of the Idaho statute. Legislators found the term “sabotage” in the bill ambiguous and did not pass the bill.&lt;ref&gt;Whitten, pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, the federal government increased crackdowns against IWW on suspicion of the organization’s financial ties with foreign hostiles. The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] conducted raids on IWW headquarters across the country, including bases in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Fresno.&lt;ref&gt;Whitten, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the protests, IWW was accused of sabotaging Fresno famers by burning hay stacks and covering raisins with dirt. The Department of Justice opened its Fresno branch in response. California State Federation of Labor also issued a condemnation of IWW. These events coincided with the bombing of the governor’s residence at Sacramento, which led to arrests of IWW members. The press began to pose a negative attitude towards IWW.&lt;ref&gt;Whitten, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1917-19, tension between capital and labor grew. Strikes and IWW activities in key wartime industries increased. The California public invoked a patriotic sentiment and saw IWW as an enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Whitten, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1919, Senator William Kehoe made the second introduction of the criminal syndicalism bill in California. The introduction came five days after the trial of the Governor’s residence bombing, possibly to drown out opposition to the bill.&lt;ref&gt;Whitten, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Stephens|Governor William Stephens]] recommended measures to check IWW propaganda in the bill.&lt;ref name="Whitten, 24"&gt;Whitten, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Legislators included his proposed amendment in the final bill.&lt;ref name="Whitten, 25"&gt;Whitten, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed bill would outlaw labor organization which conduct strikes or boycotts with the intent of changing industrial ownership and control or causing any political change.&lt;ref name="Whitten, 25"/&gt;

Representatives of organized labor, while supportive of the bill’s intent to reduce IWW influences,&lt;ref name="Whitten, 25"/&gt; believed the bill could be used to imprison labor leaders should strikes or boycotts be used in industrial disputes.&lt;ref name="Whitten, 24"/&gt;  Labor leaders proposed an amendment which defined the punishable offense more definitely. The amendment failed to pass.&lt;ref name="Whitten, 25"/&gt;

Governor Stephens signed the bill containing his proposed clause into law on April 30, 1919.&lt;ref name="Whitten, 25"/&gt;

=== Kansas ===
The defense by the IWW's [[General Defense Committee]] in the case of [[Fiske v. Kansas]] resulted in a critically important 1924 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling which led to the decline of criminal syndicalism laws as a factor in legislative anti-union initiatives.&lt;ref name="Cortner"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cortner |first=Richard C. |date=Spring 1981 |title=The Wobblies and Fiske v. Kansas: Victory Amidst Disintegration |journal=[[Kansas History: A Journal of the Central Plains|Kansas History]] |url=http://www.kshs.org/publicat/history/1981spring_cortner.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=[[Kansas Historical Society]] |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=30–38 |access-date=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, [[Kansas]]' state criminal syndicalism law was challenged by a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling in the case of [[Fiske v. Kansas]], which would become critically important in the future of legal battles over [[freedom of speech]], and which was an early case supported by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]. The ruling overturned the conviction of Harold B. Fiske, an organizer affiliated with the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]'s [[Agricultural Workers Industrial Union]].

=== In 2013 ===
The states who still have criminal syndicalism statutes in 2013 are:
* [[Montana]] ({{Cite web|url = http://leg.mt.gov/bills/1995/mca/45/8/45-8-105.htm|title = M.C.A. 45-8-105}})

Moreover, 
* [[California]] allows the firing of teachers involved in "commi[ting], aiding, or advocating the commission of acts of criminal syndicalism, as prohibited by Chapter 188 of the [[California Criminal Syndicalism Act|Statutes of 1919]], or in any amendment thereof." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=edc&amp;group=44001-45000&amp;file=44930-44988|title = C.C. 44-932(a)(2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kansas]] allows, by an artifact disposition, the issuance of ''[[subpoena]]s'' for "any alleged violation in this state pertaining to terrorism, illegal use of weapons of mass destruction,..., ''criminal syndicalism''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://kansasstatutes.lesterama.org/Chapter_22/Article_31/22-3101.html|title = K.S.A. 22-3101}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Minnesota]] allows courts and state executive to interviene in labor actions "where criminal syndicalism, or the acts constituting the same, are involved".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://policy.mofcom.gov.cn/english/flaw!fetch.action?id=b6168ea9-f032-4eb2-811c-3c0af1db996a&amp;pager.pageNo=1#minnesota-175-186-185-185_06|title = M.C. 185.06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutionality==

Some argued that criminal syndicalism laws violated the United States Constitution.

In ''Whitney v. California'', 274 U.S. 357 (1927), the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] held that California's law suppressing speech advocating criminal acts against the state did not violate the right to [[freedom of speech]] as enumerated in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], since it encouraged a bad tendency in listeners.

However, that holding ''Whitney'' was overturned in ''Brandenburg v. Ohio'', 395 U.S. 444 (1969), where the Court replaced the "bad tendency" test with "imminent lawless action" test. Since the Ohio Criminal Syndicalism law criminalized speech that did not incite imminent lawless action, the Ohio law violated the Freedom of Speech clause of the First Amendment.

'''Dmitriy Aksenov''' (3 October 1966, [[Novosibirsk]], [[USSR]]) — A patron of the arts, managing director of the contemporary arts fair [[Viennacontemporary]] (Austria). He is also the founder of the Aksenov Family Foundation and chairman of the Board of Directors of [[RDI Group]].

== Biography ==
Dmitriy Aksenov was born 3 October 1966 in [[Novosibirsk]], [[USSR]]. In 1989 he graduated from the [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology]] (MIPT) in avionics and space research.
In 1999 he obtained an MBA degree in strategic management from the Institute of Business and Business Administration.

== Employment ==
2005–Present day - Founder and chairman of the Board of Directors of the investment and management company [[RDI group]] (development management of real estate, communications services, multi-profile investments in [[Russia]] and abroad).
2015 - founder of RDI Creative, which, together with Ad Marginem publishers, produced a series of biographies of the lives of both well and lesser known Russian artists, called Names. The books were published both in Russian and in English.

== Support of art ==
Member of the Board of Trustees of Practica theatre.&lt;br&gt;
President of the Russian society of friends of the [[Salzburg Festival]].&lt;br&gt;
President of the International Society of friends of the [[Albertina museum]].&lt;br&gt;
Member of Tate – Russia and Eastern Europe Acquisitions committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | url       = http://www.tate.org.uk/download/file/fid/103595
  | publisher = The Tate Britain Commission
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In 2014 Dmitriy Aksenov took part in the preparations for the Moscow: Urban Space municipal exhibition, as a commissioner in the parallel programme of the Venice architectural biennale (Santa Maria della Pieta church, [[Venice]], curator – Moscow head architect Sergei Kuznetsov).&lt;br&gt;
In September 2014 Dmitriy Aksenov joined the supervising committee of the Capital Institute of the Problems of Contemporary Art.&lt;br&gt;
Dmitriy Aksyonov owns 70% of the shares in [[VIENNAFAIR|Viennafair]] The New Contemporary, and is its only Russian shareholder as well as the managing director of the fair. 30%  of the shares belong to the VF Beteiligungs KG partnership of Austrian art patrons. In 2015 [[VIENNAFAIR|Viennafair]] The New Contemporary moved to a new location. It changed its name to [[Viennacontemporary]] and took place in Marx Halle, [[Vienna]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/abinlot/2016/09/29/through-its-focus-on-eastern-european-art-viennacontemporary-leads-austriascultural-resurgence/#4454ca0c5929|title=Forbes.com: viennacontemporary Leads Austria‘s Cultural Resurgence|last=|first=|date=2016-09-29|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wallpaper.com/art/viennacontemporary-brings-112-galleries-to-marx-halle-vienna|title=Look east: viennacontemporary brings 112 galleries to Marx Halle {{!}} Art {{!}} Wallpaper* Magazine|last=Magazine|first=Wallpaper*|date=2016-09-23|newspaper=Wallpaper*|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Dmitriy Aksenov's idea to develop society using cultural instruments was the basis of his conception of RDI Group's cultural centres. Projects based on the participatory planning approach are being implemented in each of the residential estate projects being built by RDI, developing cultural programmes and urban communities for the territories. Thanks to the work of RDI Creative a "third place" with high-quality content is being created for the residents, who are provided with opportunities in the field of culture irrespective of location or income. They can each share the cultural achievements and at the same time learn from the cultural experience of the other communities. For example, in April 2015 the New-Molokovo ([[Moscow region]]) residential estate cultural centre was opened, as were the Out-Of-Town Quarter and the Southern Vidnoe residential estate cultural centres in March 2016 and June 2016 respectively.&lt;br&gt;
In April 2013 Dmitriy Aksyonov was awarded with the prestigious Personal Contribution annual award of The Art Newspaper Russia for developing the [[Viennacontemporary]] arts fair [[VIENNAFAIR]]. Joseph Backschtein, the Moscow contemporary arts biennale commissioner, and Suria Sadekova, editor of the Art Market section of The Art Newspaper Russia, presented the award. In 2015 Aksenov became one of the top hundred people in Russian art for 2014, according to The Art Newspaper Russia, occupying 25th place.

== Charity ==
Founder of the VR Foundation, which develops effective treatments for people suffering from [[vitiligo]].&lt;br&gt;
Founder of the Aksenov Family Foundation, which initiates and supports projects striving to develop cultural and social innovation.&lt;br&gt;
Major donator to the fund for the development of MIPT. Since 2014 – member of the managing committee of the fund managing capital for the development of [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology|MIPT]].&lt;br&gt;
In 2016, with the support and personal participation of Dmitriy Aksyonov and dedicated to the 50th anniversary of [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology|MIPT]], the all-Russian physics and technology test [[:ru:Контрольная "Выходи решать!|"Go and Solve it!"]] was launched.

'''Drug development''' is the process of bringing a new [[pharmaceutical drug]] to the market once a [[lead compound]] has been identified through the process of [[drug discovery]].  It includes [[pre-clinical research]] on microorganisms and animals, filing for regulatory status, such as via the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] for an [[investigational new drug]] to initiate [[clinical trial]]s on humans, and may include the step of obtaining [[regulatory approval]] with a [[new drug application]] to market the drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strovel|first1=Jeffrey|last2=Sittampalam|first2=Sitta|last3=Coussens|first3=Nathan P.|last4=Hughes|first4=Michael|last5=Inglese|first5=James|last6=Kurtz|first6=Andrew|last7=Andalibi|first7=Ali|last8=Patton|first8=Lavonne|last9=Austin|first9=Chris|last10=Baltezor|first10=Michael|last11=Beckloff|first11=Michael|last12=Weingarten|first12=Michael|last13=Weir|first13=Scott|title=Assay Guidance Manual|date=July 1, 2016|publisher=Eli Lilly &amp; Company and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92015/|chapter=Early Drug Discovery and Development Guidelines: For Academic Researchers, Collaborators, and Start-up Companies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=David|title=The Pharmaceutical Industry and the Future of Drug Development|journal=Issues in Environmental Science and Technology|date=2015|pages=1–33|doi=10.1039/9781782622345-00001|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/chapterhtml/2015/bk9781782621898-00001?isbn=978-1-78262-189-8|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New chemical entity development==

Broadly, the process of drug development can be divided into pre-clinical and clinical work.

[[File:Drug Evaluation Process.jpg|thumbnail|center|900px|Timeline showing the various drug approval tracks and research phases{{fact|date=July 2018}}]]

===Pre-clinical===
{{Main|Pre-clinical development}}
[[New chemical entity|New chemical entities]] (NCEs, also known as new molecular entities or NMEs) are compounds that emerge from the process of [[drug discovery]]. These have promising activity against a particular biological target that is important in disease. However, little is known about the safety, [[toxicity]], [[pharmacokinetics]], and [[metabolism]] of this NCE in humans. It is the function of drug development to assess all of these parameters prior to human clinical trials. A further major objective of drug development is to recommend the dose and schedule for the first use in a human clinical trial ("[[first-in-man study|first-in-man]]" [FIM] or First Human Dose [FHD]).

In addition, drug development must establish the physicochemical properties of the NCE: its chemical makeup, stability, and solubility. Manufacturers must optimize the process they use to make the chemical so they can scale up from a [[medicinal chemist]] producing milligrams, to manufacturing on the kilogram and [[ton]] scale. They further examine the product for suitability to package as [[Capsule (pharmacy)|capsules]], [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]], aerosol, intramuscular injectable, subcutaneous injectable, or [[intravenous]] [[formulations]]. Together, these processes are known in preclinical and clinical development as ''chemistry, manufacturing, and control'' (CMC).

Many aspects of drug development focus on satisfying the [[new drug application|regulatory requirements]] of drug licensing authorities. These generally constitute a number of tests designed to determine the major toxicities of a novel compound prior to first use in humans. It is a legal requirement that an assessment of major organ toxicity be performed (effects on the heart and lungs, brain, kidney, liver and digestive system), as well as effects on other parts of the body that might be affected by the drug (e.g., the skin if the new drug is to be delivered through the skin). Increasingly, these tests are made using ''[[in vitro]]'' methods (e.g., with isolated cells), but many tests can only be made by using experimental animals to demonstrate the complex interplay of metabolism and drug exposure on toxicity.

The information is gathered from this pre-clinical testing, as well as information on CMC, and submitted to regulatory authorities (in the US, to the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]), as an [[Investigational New Drug]] application or IND. If the IND is approved, development moves to the clinical phase.

===Clinical phase===
[[Clinical trials]] involve three or four steps:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ciociola AA | date = May 2014 | title = How drugs are developed and approved by the FDA: current process and future directions | url = | journal = Am J Gastroenterol | volume = 109 | issue = 5| pages = 620–3 | doi = 10.1038/ajg.2013.407 | pmid = 24796999 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Phase I trials, usually in healthy volunteers, determine safety and dosing.
* Phase II trials are used to get an initial reading of efficacy and further explore safety in small numbers of patients having the disease targeted by the NCE.
* Phase III trials are large, pivotal trials to determine safety and efficacy in sufficiently large numbers of patients with the targeted disease. If safety and efficacy are adequately proved, clinical testing may stop at this step and the NCE advances to the [[new drug application]] (NDA) stage.
* Phase IV trials are post-approval trials that are sometimes a condition attached by the FDA, also called post-market surveillance studies.

The process of defining characteristics of the drug does not stop once an NCE begins human clinical trials. In addition to the tests required to move a novel drug into the clinic for the first time, manufacturers must ensure that any long-term or chronic toxicities are well-defined, including effects on systems not previously monitored (fertility, reproduction, immune system, among others). They must also test the compound for its potential to cause [[cancer]] ([[carcinogenicity]] testing).

If a compound emerges from these tests with an acceptable toxicity and safety profile, and the company can further show it has the desired effect in clinical trials, then the NCE portfolio of evidence can be submitted for marketing approval in the various countries where the manufacturer plans to sell it. In the United States, this process is called a "new drug application" or NDA.

Most NCEs fail during drug development, either because they have unacceptable toxicity or because they simply do not have the intended effect on the  targeted disease as shown in clinical trials.

A trend toward the collection of biomarker and genetic information from clinical trial participants, and increasing investment by companies in this area, led by 2018 to fully half of all drug trials collecting this information, the prevalence reaching above 80% among oncology trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miseta|first=Ed|date=August 17, 2018|title=Gene Therapies Create Moral Dilemma For Clinical Researchers|url=https://www.clinicalleader.com/doc/gene-therapies-create-moral-dilemma-for-clinical-researchers-0001|journal=Clinical Leader|location=Pennsylvania, United States|publisher=VertMarkets, Inc.|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cost ==
The full cost of bringing a new drug (i.e., [[new chemical entity]]) to market  – from discovery through clinical trials to approval – is complex and controversial. Typically, companies spend tens to hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=26908540|year=2016|author1=Sertkaya|first1=A|title=Key cost drivers of pharmaceutical clinical trials in the United States|journal=Clinical Trials|volume=13|issue=2|pages=117–26|last2=Wong|first2=H. H.|last3=Jessup|first3=A|last4=Beleche|first4=T|doi=10.1177/1740774515625964}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One element of the complexity is that the much-publicized final numbers often not only include the out-of-pocket expenses for conducting a series of Phase I-III clinical trials, but also the ''capital costs'' of the long period (10 or more years) during which the company must cover out-of-pocket costs for preclinical drug discovery. Additionally, companies often do not report whether a given figure includes the capitalized cost or comprises only out-of-pocket expenses, or both.

Another element of complexity is that all estimates are based on confidential information controlled by drug companies, released by them voluntarily, leading to inability to verify costs. The numbers are controversial, as drug companies use them to justify the prices of their drugs and various advocates for lower drug prices have challenged them. The controversy is not only between "high" and "low", but also the high numbers may vary considerably for the manifold factors in drug development.

One study assessed both capitalized and out-of-pocket costs for bringing a single new drug to market as about US$1.8 billion and $870 million, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nrd3078|title=How to improve R&amp;D productivity: The pharmaceutical industry's grand challenge|journal=Nature Reviews Drug Discovery|year=2010|last1=Paul|first1=Steven M.|last2=Mytelka|first2=Daniel S.|last3=Dunwiddie|first3=Christopher T.|last4=Persinger|first4=Charles C.|last5=Munos|first5=Bernard H.|last6=Lindborg|first6=Stacy R.|last7=Schacht|first7=Aaron L.|pmid=20168317|volume=9|pages=203–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an analysis of the drug development costs for 98 companies over a decade, the average cost per drug developed and approved by a single-drug company was $350 million.&lt;ref name=forbes13/&gt; But for companies that approved between eight and 13 drugs over 10 years, the cost per drug went as high as $5.5 billion, due mainly to geographic expansion for marketing and ongoing costs for Phase IV trials and continuous monitoring for safety.&lt;ref name="forbes13"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2013/08/11/how-the-staggering-cost-of-inventing-new-drugs-is-shaping-the-future-of-medicine/#7753cc096bfc | title=The Cost Of Creating A New Drug Now $5 Billion, Pushing Big Pharma To Change | publisher=Forbes, Pharma &amp; Healthcare | date=11 August 2013 | accessdate=17 July 2016 | author=Herper, Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatives to conventional drug development have the objective for universities, governments and pharmaceutical industry to collaborate and optimize resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Busting the billion-dollar myth: how to slash the cost of drug development|journal=Nature|volume=536|pages=388–90|year=2016|author=Maxmen A|url=http://www.nature.com/news/busting-the-billion-dollar-myth-how-to-slash-the-cost-of-drug-development-1.20469|doi=10.1038/536388a|pmid=27558048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Valuation ==

The nature of a drug development project is characterised by high [[attrition rate]]s, large capital expenditures, and long timelines. This makes the valuation of such projects and companies a challenging task. Not all valuation methods can cope with these particularities. The most commonly used valuation methods are [[rNPV|risk-adjusted net present value]] (rNPV), [[decision tree]]s, [[real options]], or [[comparables]].

The most important value drivers are the cost of capital or discount rate that is used, [[Phases of clinical research|phase]] attributes such as duration, success rates, and costs, and the forecasted sales, including cost of goods and marketing and sales expenses. Less objective aspects like quality of the management or novelty of the technology should be reflected in the [[cash flow]]s estimation.&lt;ref&gt;Boris Bogdan and Ralph Villiger, "Valuation in Life Sciences. A Practical Guide", 2008, 2nd edition, Springer Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, Nicolaj Hoejer "Financial valuation methods for biotechnology", 2010. {{cite web|url=http://biostrat.dk/financial-valuation-methods-for-biotechnology.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305213601/http://biostrat.dk/financial-valuation-methods-for-biotechnology.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Success rate==
Candidates for a new drug to treat a disease might, theoretically, include from 5,000 to 10,000 chemical compounds. On average about 250 of these show sufficient promise for further evaluation using laboratory tests, mice and other test animals. Typically, about ten of these qualify for tests on humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Dr. H.G. |last=Stratmann |date=September 2010 |title=Bad Medicine: When Medical Research Goes Wrong |journal=Analog Science Fiction and Fact|volume=CXXX |issue=9 |pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted by the [[Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development]] covering the 1980s and 1990s found that only 21.5 percent of drugs that started Phase I trials were eventually approved for marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=R&amp;D costs are on the rise|journal=Medical Marketing and Media |date=June 1, 2003 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-102908512.html |volume=38 |issue=6 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the time period of 2006 to 2015, the success rate was 9.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bio.org/sites/default/files/Clinical%20Development%20Success%20Rates%202006-2015%20-%20BIO,%20Biomedtracker,%20Amplion%202016.pdf | title = Clinical Development Success Rates 2006-2015 | date = June 2016| work =  BIO Industry Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high failure rates associated with pharmaceutical development are referred to as the "attrition rate" problem.

==Novel initiatives to boost development==
Novel initiatives include partnering between governmental organizations and industry. The world's largest such initiative is the [[Innovative Medicines Initiative]] (IMI), and examples of major national initiatives are Top Institute Pharma in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Biopeople]] in [[Denmark]]. In 2004, the [[food and drug administration|FDA]] created the “Critical Path Initiative” to guide the new drug development process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/CriticalPathInitiative/default.htm | title=Critical Path Initiative | publisher=US Food and Drug Administration | date=23 October 2015 | accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Erich Erber''' (born April 30, 1953) is an Austrian entrepreneur. He is the founder of Erber KG, later known as [[Biomin]] GmbH; the animal health and nutrition company specializes in [[feed additives]] and premixes. It continues to be family-owned and operated.

== Early life and education ==
Erich Erber was born on April 30, 1953 in [[Sankt Pölten]], the capital of the state of [[Lower Austria]], and was raised on a small farm in the Mostviertel region. &lt;ref name="derstandard_ref1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bezwinger giftiger Pilze: Vom Bauernkind zum Weltmarktführer|url= https://derstandard.at/2000049137462/Erich-Erber-Bezwinger-der-giftigen-Schimmelpilze|last=Kainrath|first=Verena|date=12 December 2016|website= www.derstandard.at |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied agriculture at the [[Francisco Josephinum]] Secondary College and Research Institute, obtaining the equivalent of a high school diploma in 1975. &lt;ref name="ernstyoung_ref2"&gt;{{cite book | date=January 2015 |title= Der Kosmopolit aus dem Pielachtal |publisher= Enterpreneur – Magazin für unternehmerische Exzellenz by Ernst &amp; Young (Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft m.b.H.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1976-1978, Erich Erber worked as an Operations assistant at Kettaneh Pt Ltd, located in [[Accra]], [[Ghana]]. He was involved in the production of construction materials. At the same time, he acquired expertise in the field of international trade while majoring in export sales at the Vienna University of Economics and Business from 1978-1980. Concurrently, he began to study macroeconomics at the [[University of Vienna]] (without obtaining a degree).  From 1980 - 1982, he was the Head of Sales at Chemagrar, a subsidiary of Werfft Chemie, which specializes in feed additives for the Central European compound feed industry. &lt;ref name="derstandard_ref1"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ernstyoung_ref2"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

He received his MBA, with a focus on strategic marketing, from the [[University of Hull]] in [[Singapore]].

== Biomin ==
In 1983, Erich Erber and Margarete Erber founded [[Biomin]] GmbH together in Pottenbrunn, Lower Austria. The company’s first products were developed in a former slaughterhouse. &lt;ref name="allaboutfeed_ref3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Erich Erber leads Biomin from fun to serious business|url= http://www.allaboutfeed.net/Process-Management/Feed-Safety/2011/10/ErichErber-leads-Biomin-from-fun-to-serious-business-AAF012377W/|last=ter Beek|first=Vincent|date=3 October 2011|website= www.allaboutfeed.net |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="erbergroup_ref4"&gt;{{cite web|title=Erber Group's History|url= http://www.erber-group.net/en/about/history/|website= www.erber-group.net |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It continues to be family-owned and operated.

Biomin GmbH acquired Interpremix, a company with its own tank mixer and the product Antitox&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Plus, in 1985. Following extensive research, the product was developed further under the name Mycofix&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; and subsequently became a global benchmark product. &lt;ref name="derstandard_ref1"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ernstyoung_ref2"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

One year later, it was exported to [[Asia]] for the first time. In 1988, Biomin GmbH concluded a research agreement with the [[University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna]]. Its goal was to continue to improve Antitox&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Plus’s effectiveness in deactivating a wide variety of [[mycotoxins]]. &lt;ref name="derstandard_ref1"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ernstyoung_ref2"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pigsite_ref5"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biomin to Launch Mycofix 5.0 Mycotoxin Risk Management Solution to Date|url= http://www.thepigsite.com/swinenews/39083/biomin-to-launch-mycofix-50-the-most-complete-mycotoxin-risk-management-solution-to-date/|date=4 March 2015|website= www.thepigsite.com |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Erber Group ==
In 1992, Erich Erber founded Biomin’s first subsidiary with a local partner in [[Kuala Lumpur]]. In later years, additional subsidiaries were created abroad: examples include the first Biomin production site in [[Vietnam]] in 1995 and regional headquarters which opened in Singapore and the U.S. in 1997. In 1996, Erber AG was also founded as an [[unlisted public company]]; it was a [[holding company]] for the two group members at the time as well as for all future organizations. &lt;ref name="ernstyoung_ref2"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

By creating an interdisciplinary in-house research team, Erich Erber established another forward-thinking milestone. Research and development have been part of Biomin’s key cornerstones ever since. &lt;ref name="derstandard_ref1"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ernstyoung_ref2"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The next step on his path to success took place when he acquired Romer Labs [[Missouri]] in 1999. In doing so, he was able to develop a business segment that was completely new: diagnostics in the field of feed and food safety. Romer Labs thus became the second division of Erber Group.&lt;ref name="romerlabs_ref6"&gt;{{cite web|title=Romer Labs writes history|url= https://www.romerlabs.com/en/about/history/|website= www.romerlabs.com |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Erich Erber created the Biomin World Nutrition Forum, with the goal of actively involving customers and promoting trust in the organization. Scientists, customers and managers come together to exchange ideas regarding current developments. 
It takes place once every two years, with approximately 800 participants (event organizers, keynote speakers, etc.). &lt;ref name="efeedlink_ref7"&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2016 World Nutrition Forum: Driving the protein economy towards a new horizon|url= http://www.efeedlink.com/contents/06-06-2016/81232398-6635-44ff-9965-bff3aa6692a3-a181.html|last=Brooks|first=Eric J.|website= www.efeedlink.com |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="engormix_ref8"&gt;{{cite web|title=World Nutrition Forum 2004|url= https://en.engormix.com/MA-poultry-industry/events/world-nutrition-forum-2004-t115.htm|website= www.engormix.com |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Mr. Erber took additional steps to ensure the group’s development by opening the first Biomin Center of Applied Animal Nutrition. &lt;ref name="allaboutfeed_ref9"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biomin opens Erber Research Center in Thailand|url= http://www.allaboutfeed.net/Raw-Materials/Articles/2014/12/Biomin-opens-Erber-Research-Center-in-Thailand-1673626W/|last=Koeleman|first=Emmy|date=30 December 2014|website= www.allaboutfeed.net |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="koenigshofer_ref10"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kooperationspartner BIOMIN|url= http://www.koenigshofer-futtermittel.at/links.html|website= www.koenigshofer-futtermittel.at |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erber Group’s third and fourth divisions joined in 2007:
Sanphar, a Brazilian company specializing in animal health, and EFB. EFB, together with the subsidiary Bio-ferm, focuses on innovative [[Biopesticides|biotechnological pesticides]] and their research, international registration and marketing. &lt;ref name="efeedlink_ref11"&gt;{{cite web|title=SANPHAR Asia: A 360° modern animal health company|url= http://www.efeedlink.com/contents/07-30-2015/1eb09500-0ea5-4a71-8449-d15b335b2e57-b852.html|last=Chan|first=Ngai Meng|date=30 July 2015|website= www.efeedlink.com |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of a state-of-the-art [[yeast]] [[fermentation]] facility in Brazil has been the group’s largest investment thus far; it became operational in 2010. This site makes direct shipments to regional markets possible. &lt;ref name="ernstyoung_ref2"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Erber Group sees itself as an organization of experts and is the global market leader in mycotoxin risk management, its original core business. &lt;ref name="aquafeed_ref12"&gt;{{cite web|title=BIOMIN World Nutrition Forum 2012|url= https://issuu.com/international_aquafeed/docs/iaf1206_w1/46|last=Davies|first=Simon|date=7 November 2012|website= issuu.com |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="poultryworld_ref13"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biomin launches first purified enzyme against fumonisins|url= http://www.poultryworld.net/Nutrition/Articles/20131/3/Biomin-launches-first-purified-enzyme-against-fumonisins-1193301W/|date=7 March 2013|website= www.poultryworld.net |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high-performance research and development within the group provides a basis for the development of customer-oriented and innovative solutions. This is made possible, in particular, by cooperating with renowned universities and research centers on various projects. &lt;ref name="ernstyoung_ref2"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="biomin_ref14"&gt;{{cite web|title=Research - at the heart of BIOMIN|url= http://www.biomin.net/en/about/research/|website= www.biomin.net |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tfztulln_ref15"&gt;{{cite web|title=Business at Technopol Tulln|url= http://www.tfz-tulln.at/magazin/00/artikel/149325/doc/d/BIOMIN%20Research%20Center.pdf?ok=j|website= www.tfz-tulln.at |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fishsite_ref16"&gt;{{cite web|title=BIOMIN to Open New Aquaculture Research Center in Viet Nam|url= https://thefishsite.com/articles/biomin-to-open-new-aquaculture-research-center-in-viet-nam|last=Towers|first=Lucy|date=14 January 2015|website= thefishsite.com |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erber Group is now one of the global leaders in the field of food and feed safety. Headquartered in [[Inzersdorf-Getzersdorf|Getzersdorf]], Lower Austria, it specializes in natural [[feed additives]], feed and food analyses as well as [[crop protection|plant protection]]. In the 2017 financial year, it generated sales revenues of over 325 million Euros. Erber Group consists of [[Biomin]], Romer Labs, Sanphar and EFB. Including its sales partners, it is represented in over 120 countries. Erber Group’s annual growth can be attributed to two important success factors: the group’s international orientation and its internal research and development. &lt;ref name="ernstyoung_ref2"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="erbergroup_ref17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Erber Group Companies|url= http://www.erber-group.net/en/about/erber-group-companies/|website= www.erber-group.net |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Erich Erber is the main stockholder and chairman of the Erber AG advisory board. The Erber family owns all of the companies' stocks; they are not traded on any stock market.

== Awards and Honors ==
In 2012, Erich Erber was awarded the title of “honorary consul” for his long-term cooperation with [[University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna |BOKU]], the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna. &lt;ref name="boku_ref18"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaudeamus igitur anlässlich von Ehrungen|url= https://alumni.boku.ac.at/dl/NrOqJKJkMmJqx4KJK/14_01.pdf|date=1 March 2014|website= alumni.boku.ac.at |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, in 2015 he received an honorary PhD from [[Kasetsart University]] in [[Bangkok]]. &lt;ref name="meinbezirk_ref21"&gt;{{cite web|title=Erich Erber mit Ehrendoktorwürde der Kasetsart Universität Thailand geehrt|url= https://www.meinbezirk.at/herzogenburgtraismauer/wirtschaft/erich-erber-mit-ehrendoktorwuerde-der-kasetsart-universitaet-thailand-geehrt-d1222470.html|date=24 January 2015|website= www.meinbezirk.at |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 21, 2016, Erich Erber was awarded the “Silver Commanders’ Cross for Recognition of Services on Behalf of the State of Lower Austria” by the Governor of Lower Austria, [[Erwin Pröll]], during a ceremony in the Lower Austrian Parliament. In doing so, the state of Lower Austria recognizes Mr. Erber’s contributions and achievements as the founder and co-owner of Erber AG, which has been his [[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]] for more than 30 years. &lt;ref name="iv_ref22"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ehrenzeichen für Erich Erber|url= https://niederoesterreich.iv.at/de/news/mitgliedernews/2016/ehrenzeichen-fur-erich-erber|date=22 June 2016|website= niederoesterreich.iv.at |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7610">'''Farbrausch''', or '''Farb-rausch''', is a [[Germany|German]] group of [[demogroup|demomakers]] who became well known in the [[demoscene]] in December 2000 with a [[64k intro]] called "fr-08: .the .product". The demo achieved its small size through the use of [[procedural textures]], a custom MIDI-based [[software synthesizer]] V2 (controlled through a sequencer called [[Logic Audio]]), and a modified version of [[UPX]] executable compressor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soyoucode.com/2011/coding-giant-under-microscope-farbrausch |title = Coding a giant under the microscope: Farbrausch}}&lt;/ref&gt; ".the .product" is an 11-minute [[3D computer graphics|3-D]] show featuring complex scenes of [[computer generated imagery]].

Their work has won numerous awards. In 2004, a subdivision of farbrausch called "'''.theprodukkt'''" released a 96kB first-person shooter game named "[[.kkrieger]]", and an earlier version of the [[demomaker|tool]] they currently use to produce some of their demos, named "[[.werkkzeug]]", or "Tool".

Farbrausch gives their releases a "product code", in the format "fr-0#".  The numbers do not specify the order of release &amp;mdash; the members have stated that they allocate the numbers as they start working on the project, not when they finish it. Non-serious releases receive negative numbers.

The group has periodically released improved compositions such as "fr-019: Poem to a Horse", "fr-030: Candytron"  or "fr-025: The.Popular.Demo". ''The.Popular.Demo'' and ''debris.'' are among the most highly favored demos on the demoscene index, [[Pouët|Pouet]]. The.Popular.Demo also received the "Public Choice Award" from the 2003 scene.org awards, and ''debris.'' won the 2007 scene.org award for best direction.

In 2009, Farbrausch released [[.detuned]], an interactive demo for the [[PlayStation 3]], again under the name .theprodukkt.

In 2012 Farbrausch released the [[source code]] of many of their demotools on [[github.com]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/farbrausch/fr_public fr_public] on github.com&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6341">'''Focused improvement''' in the Theory of Constraints is an ensemble of activities aimed at elevating the performance of any system, especially a business system, with respect to its goal by eliminating its constraints one by one and by ''not'' working on non-constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Focused improvement|url = http://informationquickfind.com/f/fo/focused_improvement.html|website = informationquickfind.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Focused improvement''' can also be defined in simpler terms as a process that identifies the systems problems and then modifies the whole system in order to find the most cost effective,time saving and least disruptive solutions in order to optimize the system.

'''"Focused Improvement''' is the process of applying systematic problem solving methods to manufacturing. The process relies on aligning the correct method to the correct scenario".

== Development and Apparition  ==
Focused improvement was developed as a working part of the Theory of Constraints management philosophy by [[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]] in his 1984 book titled ''[[The Goal (novel)|The Goal]]'', that is geared to help organizations continually achieve their goals. Unlike other popular performance improvement methods, such as [[Total quality management|TQM]] or [[Business process reengineering|reengineering]], '''F.I.''' focuses on solving real life problems and not on increasing the costs and distractions for the management's attention.

== Focused improvement V.S. Total Quality Management (TQM) ==
No general agreement has been reached about the characteristics of F.I. or TQM but to some extent we can observe similar traits in implementations of these processes.

=== Traits of Focused improvement ===
# Identify the system's constraint(s).
# Decide how to exploit the system's constraint(s).
# Subordinate everything else to the above decision(s).
# Elevate the system's constraint(s). 
# Communicate the new approach and move to the next improvement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Focused Improvements for Management Methods|url = http://www.manageprojectsbetter.com/focused-improvements.html|website = Mark Waldof Consulting LLC|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traits of TQM ===
# "Quality is defined by customers' requirements."
# "Top management has direct responsibility for quality improvement."
# "Increased quality comes from systematic analysis and improvement of work processes."
# "Quality improvement is a continuous effort and conducted throughout the organization." 
These two philosophies have the same main goal but they go about achieving it two different ways. The Fi delivers short term results that can be translated into long term success if the process is repeated correctly without allowing it to lose momentum. The TQM has at its base client satisfaction but it only yields long term results. When choosing one of these two processes management has to take into account what are the company needs.

== Uses and potential ==
Products that are based on embedded computer systems has seen a rapid increase. During this time the features that are controlled or supported by software systems that are embedded have suffered an increase in their role becoming crucial. All these developments make it necessary to create and innovate new approaches for software process improvement that focus on improving specific product traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Product Focused Process Improvement: Experiences of Applying the PROFES Improvement Methodology at DRÄGER|url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=2A0769CB6F04B48AE8DC14EBBEB3304F?doi=10.1.1.136.8336&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|author=Adriana Bicego, Pieter Derks, Pasi Kuvaja, Dietmar Pfahl|citeseerx=10.1.1.136.8336|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Focused improvement can be used not only in business systems but in any type of system be it healthcare, education, waste management, space exploration systems(NASA etc.)

== Functioning principles ==
The  FI is based on the [[Thinking processes (theory of constraints)|Five Thinking Processes]] that enable it to work in any cognitive system. The working principle of the five thinking processes is represented by the users ability to answer the following questions:
# ''What to change?''
# ''What to change it into?''
# ''How to cause the change?''
# ''Why Change?''
# ''How to maintain the process of ongoing improvement ?''
If all questions have an answer then the Focused improvement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = focused improvement «|url = http://www.kcts.co.uk/blog/tag/focused-improvement|website = www.kcts.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-02|last = Oxton|first = Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be applied with relative ease

== Useful quotes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = http://www.tpmconsulting.org/english_show.php?id=8|url = http://www.tpmconsulting.org/english_show.php?id=8|website = www.tpmconsulting.org|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
"Focused improvement includes all activities that maximize the overall effectiveness of equipment, processes, and plants through uncompromising elimination of losses'''*''' and improvement of performance."&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, T., Ed. (1994). TPM in Process Industries. Portland, OR, Productivity Press.Tajiri, M. and F. Gotoh (p.1992). TPM Implementation - A Japanese Approach. New York, McGrawHill.&lt;/ref&gt;

The objective of Focused Improvement is to assure that the equipment maintains a peak performance all the time.

"The fact is machines do virtually 100 percent of the product manufacturing work. The only thing we people do, whether we’re operators, technicians, engineers, or managers, is to tend to the needs of the machines in one way or another. The better our machines run, the more productive our shop floor, and the more successful our business."&lt;ref&gt;Leflar, J. (2001) p.15. Practical TPM. Portland, OR, Productivity Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The driving concept behind Focused Improvement is bringing your losses as close to zero as possible.

"Maximizing equipment effectiveness requires the complete elimination of failures, defects, and other negative phenomena – in other words, the wastes and losses incurred in equipment operation."&lt;ref&gt;Nakajima, S. (1988) p.19 Introduction to Total Productive Maintenance. Cambridge, MA, ProductivityPress.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Georgy Stepanovich Khizha''' ({{lang-ru|Гео́ргий Степа́нович Хижа́}}; born 2 May 1938, [[Ashgabat]], [[Turkmen SSR]]) was a Russian politician and business manager who was one of the [[Deputy Prime Minister of Russia|Deputy Chairmen of the Government of the Russian Federation]] during the early years of [[President of Russia|President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s administration. 

==Early work==
A factory manager, by 1990 Khizha was in charge of the "[[Svetlana (company)|Svetlana]]" . PJSC Svetlana (Russian: ПАО «Светлана») is a company based in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russian Federation]].It is primarily involved in the research, design, and manufacturing of electronic and microelectronic instruments. Svetlana is part of [[Ruselectronics]]. The name of the company is said to originate from the words for 'light of an electric lamp' (световые лампочки накаливания). From 1991 until 1992, he served as that city's deputy mayor under [[Anatoly Sobchak]], and proved to be a competent administrator.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Medvedev2002|Medvedev (2002)]], p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gaidar"&gt;[[#Gaidar1999|Gaidar (1999)]], p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shogren, Elizabeth (29 September 1992).

Retrieved 6 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; on recommendation to President [[Boris Yeltsin]] from Sobchak and [[Yegor Gaidar]].&lt;ref name="gaidar" /&gt; Khizha was also apparently considered as an alternative for the post of acting [[Prime Minister of Russia]], along with fellow vice premier [[Vladimir Shumeiko]], as opposed to Yeltsin's nominee, Gaidar.&lt;ref&gt;Sneider, Daniel (10 December 1992).

'''Ian Martin Dalziel''' (pronounced "Dee-ell") (born 21 June 1947) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] businessman and politician who served one term as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of the European Parliament]] from 1979 to 1984.&lt;ref name=mep&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.europarl.europa.eu/members/archive/alphaOrder/view.do?language=EN&amp;id=895 | title = Ian M. Dalziel | accessdate = 18 August 2010 | publisher = ''[[European Parliament]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalziel was educated at [[Stewart's Melville College|Daniel Stewart's College]] in [[Edinburgh]], [[St John's College, Cambridge]], studying as a postgraduate at the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]] and [[London Business School]]. He worked for Mullens &amp; Co from 1970, before moving to a management position at Manufacturers Hanover Ltd. In 1978 he was elected as a Conservative to [[London Borough of Richmond|Richmond-upon-Thames Council]] for [[Barnes, London|Barnes]] Ward.

His involvement in international business led him to seek election to the [[European Parliament]] at the first election in 1979, and he was unexpectedly elected for the [[Lothians (European Parliament constituency)|Lothians constituency]] which included his birthplace of [[Edinburgh]]. He stood down after one five-year term. due to pressure of business: in 1983 he had become the co-founder of Adam &amp; Company, a start-up private bank subsequently acquired by Royal Bank of Scotland, and following a merger, became chairman of Continental Assets Trust plc.

In 1989 Dalziel became a director of Lepercq-Amcur Fund NV, and he has chaired the board of C.S.I., Inc., since 1992. He was appointed to the board of Precision Systems Inc. in 1996. In 1998 he was a defendant in a dismissed class action suit by shareholders of Precision Systems.

'''Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan''' (ICAP) is a professional [[accountancy]] body in [[Pakistan]]. {{As of|July 2016}}, it had 8,819 members working in and outside Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icap.org.pk/web/links/134/memberstatistics.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621191634/http://www.icap.org.pk/web/links/134/memberstatistics.php |date=June 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute was established on July 1, 1961 to regulate the profession of accountancy in Pakistan. It is a statutory autonomous body established under the Chartered Accountants Ordinance 1961. With the significant growth in the profession, the CA Ordinance and Bye-Laws were revised in 1983.

In view of globalization of the accountancy profession, the Institute is in the process of updating the Ordinance and Bye-Laws once again.

The course of ICAP involves a blend of theoretical education and practical training which run concurrently for a period of 3.5 years and equips a student with knowledge, ability, skills and other qualities required of a professional accountant.

The head office of the institute is in [[Clifton, Karachi]] where it has its own premises. The institute also has regional offices at [[Lahore]], [[Islamabad]], [[Peshawar]], [[Multan]], Gujranwala, Sukkur, Quetta, Mirpur (AJK), [[Faisalabad]] and [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icap.org.pk/icap/contact-us/|title=The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan » Communication with Institute|website=www.icap.org.pk|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===1850–1881===
In Indian subcontinent there were a few British firms of accountants, but they were so busy that their services were not available to the general public.  The public companies used to appoint a European auditor for safeguarding the interests of the European shareholders, and an Indian auditor with the objectives of safeguarding the interests of the Indian shareholders.  The audit of financial statements were conducted under the Companies Act 1850.&lt;ref name="kas"&gt;Saeed, Prof. Dr. Khawaja Amjad, Auditing: Principles &amp; Procedures, Lahore: Institute of Business Management, 1993 pages 18–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1882–1913===
Then the Companies Act of 1885 was passed.  Regulations 83–94 of Table A contained in the First Schedule provided for the audit of accounts of the companies adopting that table and for the appointment, remuneration and duties of the auditors.  In those times, it was not necessary for an auditor to be a qualified accountant.  Companies used to employ lawyers as their auditors.&lt;ref name="kas"/&gt;

===1913–1932===
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[Image:GDA Certificate.png|thumb|200px|Government Diploma in Accountancy Certificate]] --&gt;
On 1 April 1914, the Companies Act, 1913 was passed and it was necessitated that every auditor of a public limited company must be a certified auditor by the government.  The provincial governments were empowered to grant auditors' certificates but, at the same time, the central government also reserved the right to recognise members of certain professional bodies as qualified auditors without obtaining Auditor's Certificate from the government.  Consequently, the members of the English, Scottish and Irish Institutes of Chartered Accountants and the English [[Society of Incorporated Accountants and Auditors]] were recognised as qualified auditors.

At that time there was no provision of any kind for the training and examination of the accountants.  Government of Bombay was the first provincial government to take a constructive step in the direction of organising the profession.  In 1918, it instituted the Government Diploma in Accountancy called GDA and made regulations for the examination and training of those who wanted to obtain that Diploma and certificate to practise.

An Accountancy Board was set up by the Government and was attached to the Sydenham College of Commerce and Economics, Bombay.  This functioned till 1932.  The Board was required to register apprenticeships and conduct the required examinations.  The successful candidates were granted the GDA Diploma and they could practise if they had previously received training as apprentices with a practising accountant.  The Accountancy Board was also required to advise the Government on all matters relating to accountancy and the Government.&lt;ref name="kas"/&gt;

===1932–1947===
In 1932, the Government framed rules under Section 144 of the companies Act, 1913, called Auditors' Certificates Rules, 1932.  The objectives of the rules, broadly, were to register apprenticeships, to conduct examinations, and to control and regulate the profession of auditing.  The accountancy profession was then being supervised and controlled by the Ministry of Commerce of the Central Government.  With a view to helping the Government in discharging the necessary responsibilities in respect of the accountancy profession, Indian Accountancy Board was established.  The Board consisted of officials and practising accountants nominated by the Government.  Later, in 1939, appointment of a majority of the members on the Board was made on the elective principle.  The Board was only an advisory body.  The Auditors' Certificates Rules, 1932, required the passing of two examinations – Registered Accountants first and final.  It further laid down the tenure of the prescribed training which was required to be completed during the period of apprenticeship.  Provisions meant to regulate and control the profession were also contained therein.&lt;ref name="kas"/&gt;

===1947–1984===
After independence, Pakistan adopted the Auditors' Certificates Rules 1932 with certain amendments in 1950, and thus the auditing profession was administered under the Auditors' Certificates Rules, 1950.  The Rules of 1950 were generally based on the old rules with some amendments incorporated therein.  A person who passed the Registered Accountants first and final examinations and who satisfied the Ministry of Commerce, Central Government of Pakistan that he had completed the prescribed practical training could have his name placed on the register maintained by the said Ministry and was entitled to use the designation 'Registered Accountant' (RA).  The Companies Act, 1913, as adapted by Pakistan allowed only a Registered Accountant to act as the auditor of a public limited company, although his services could also be utilised for the audit of private companies, partnership, etc.

In 1952, the Registered Accountants formed a private body known as 'Pakistan Institute of Accountants' with the object of looking after their own interest and taking up with the Ministry of Commerce, Government of Pakistan, matters affecting the accountancy profession.

In June 1959 the Department of Accountancy was established in the Ministry of Commerce with a Controller of Accountancy to deal with the profession instead of a Section Officer.

During this period, an advisory body called the 'Council of Accountancy' was set up under Auditors' Certificates Rules, 1950 and recommended the establishment of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Pakistan.  The Government accepted the recommendations and the Department of Accountancy assisted by the officials of the Institute and a number of its members prepared the Draft Ordinance to be passed.

The Chartered Accountants Ordinance, 1961, received the assent of the President of Pakistan, Field Marshal General Ayub Khan on March 3, 1961 and was published in Part 1 of the Extraordinary Gazette of Pakistan on March 10, 1961.  The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan came into being on July 1, 1961.  A draft of the Chartered Accountants Bye-Laws was also prepared and published for inviting public comments.  The amended version called the Chartered Accountants Bye-Laws, 1961 was published in the Part 1 of the Extraordinary Gazette of Pakistan on July 1, 1961 and was enforced as on that date.  As of that date the Department of Accountancy and the Pakistan Institute of Accountants having served a very useful purpose for a long time were finally liquidated.

The Chartered Accountants Bye-Laws provided for the formation of regional committees to look after the interests of their members.  The members are divided into two classes – namely, Associate Chartered Accountants (ACA) and Fellow Chartered Accountants (FCA).&lt;ref name="kas"/&gt;

[[File:ICAP Logo .jpg|thumbnail|ICAP Logo for Chartered Accountancy Qualification and Profession in Pakistan. And it was introduced in 2013-14]]

===1984-till now===
In December 1984, the Companies Act, 1913 was replaced by the Companies Ordinance, 1984 with an order by the President of Pakistan General Zia-ul-haq.  With this Ordinance, it was also necessitated for the manufacturing concern to prepare and maintain cost accounting records and to arrange
cost audit on annual basis by a Chartered Accountant or a Cost and Management Accountant.  It also lays down the requirements for the preparation of financial statements of unlisted companies.  For listed companies the above Ordinance also made mandatory the National Accounting Standards (NAS) and other standards to be strictly followed while preparing financial statements.

Keeping in view the convergence, undergone by the major economies of the world such as United States of America, China and Canada, of the International Financial Reporting Standards with respective local GAAP, the demand for IFRS specialists is increasing. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) has introduced a diploma in IFRS to prepare the candidates to avail such opportunities.

==Student==
The Institute provides students the login tab on its website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icap.org.pk/my-student/&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute committed to regulate the education, training and examination of its students in order to ensure that a newly qualified Chartered Accountant can continue to be confidently regarded as:

* Having a sound grounding in the major subject of accountancy, business, finance and management which can be further developed by continuing education and which can be drawn on for a professional lifetime;
* Being fully equipped with the professional attitudes expected of a member of the Institute;
* Being ready to undertake work, demanding qualities and skills expected of a chartered accountant and being able, with suitable induction, speedily to acquire any additional accountancy skills required for particular task in public practice, industry, commerce or else where.

From 1994 a Pre-entry Proficiency Test (PPT) was introduced to determine the suitability of candidates before being registered as Trainee Students/Full Time Students. PPT was mandatory for all entrants except those who were exempt from PPT but later when new policy was introduced in 2014, it was completely excluded from the course.

==Publications==
The publications of the Institute are:
* Coffee Table Book
* Newsletter
* The Pakistan Accountant
* MIES 
* Technical E-Newsletter

The Pakistan Accountant is the professional flagship publication of the Institute. It is intended to serve as a forum for disseminating information on auditing and accounting practices, business and finance, and topics of current national and international interest.

The Newsletter is designed to provide a heads-up on important Institute events and activities. The Pakistan Accountant and the Newsletter have received a makeover this past year to boost the Institute’s professional image, and to serve as a channel for staying in touch with our most valuable assets – our members and students.

Through the Members Information &amp; Education Series (MIES) the Institute hopes to promote the integration of best practices and sound judgment among members.

These publications form the body of literature that fosters the Institute’s policy of promoting education and research.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icap.org.pk/icap/publications/&lt;/ref&gt;

==International association==
The ICAP is a member of [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC), [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB), [[Confederation of Asian and Pacific Accountants]] (CAPA) and [[South Asian Federation of Accountants]] (SAFA). ICAP was awarded associate membership by [[Chartered Accountants Worldwide]] (CAW), making it the second professional body to be admitted to the organisation since its launch in February 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://economia.icaew.com/news/february-2016/icap-joins-chartered-accountants-worldwide&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Beveridge''', [[Justice of the Peace|JP]] (8 August 1848{{spaced ndash}}15 March 1916) was a New South Wales businessman, sportsman and local government politician, who served as an Alderman (1886–1891) and [[Municipality of Redfern|Mayor of Redfern]] (1891).

==Early life and background==
Beveridge was born 8 August 1848 in the town of [[Windsor, New South Wales|Windsor]], [[New South Wales|Colony of New South Wales]]. He was the son of John Beveridge, a baker and [[Confectionery|confectioner]], and Jane Greig, who as assisted migrants had emigrated from [[Kirkcaldy]], [[Fife]], [[Scotland]], to Sydney on 16 January 1839. At the age of 19, Beveridge entered the mercantile firm of ''George Griffiths and Co.'' in 1867. On 8 August 1871 he was married to Priscilla Wright, the [[Anglo-Irish]] daughter of teacher and later principal of the [[Sydney Teachers College|Fort Street Training School]] John Wright (1822–1887),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13657570 |title=Family Notices. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=24 May 1887 |accessdate=15 April 2015 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; at St Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Sydney, by the Rev. Robert Lewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13243090 |title=Family Notices. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=14 August 1871 |accessdate=28 March 2015 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ISN&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article63621940 |title=Leaders in Our Mercantile World. |newspaper=[[Illustrated Sydney News]] |date=22 August 1889 |accessdate=28 March 2015 |page=10 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beveridge and his wife Priscilla had seven children: John Stuart (1872–1874),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13339415 |title=Family Notices. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=20 November 1874 |accessdate=15 April 2015 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Percy Beveridge|Percy]] (1875–1947), Mabel (1878–1955), Harry (1882–1943), Violet (1886–1975), Cecil (1888–1946)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article22252748 |title=Family Notices. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=22 June 1946 |accessdate=18 April 2015 |page=20 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Roy Stuart (1893–1916). In 1880 he was made a partner in the firm, and on the retirement of Griffiths became the owner, which specialised in "wholesale grocery and general merchandise" from its premises on the corner of [[Bridge Street, Sydney|Bridge]] and Young streets, Sydney.&lt;ref name=ISN/&gt;

A prominent member of the flourishing business community in Sydney and Redfern, Beveridge became involved as a member of the [[Sydney Chamber of Commerce]] and as a director of the Mortgage, Guarantee and Mercantile Finance Corporation of New South Wales, the Sydney Real Estate Bank and the Australian Traders' Fire Insurance Company.&lt;ref name=ISN/&gt; Beveridge also became a member of the Redfern Branch of the [[Free Trade Party|Free Trade Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13697600 |title=MEETINGS. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=24 September 1888 |accessdate=28 March 2015 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; A keen sportsman, Beveridge was a member of the Cricket Union (vice-president in 1889) and was instrumental in the development of the Surry United Cricket Club, being captain from 1879 (now the Surry Hills Cricket Club).&lt;ref name=ISN/&gt;

==Public service==
Beveridge eventually stood for office as a free trader and became an [[alderman]] unopposed on [[Municipality of Redfern|Redfern Municipal Council]] for Belmore Ward on 20 September 1886, filling a vacancy created by the departure of Alderman [[Francis Augustus Wright]], and was re-elected in February 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13642295 |title=Advertising. |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|location=NSW |date=21 September 1886 |accessdate=1 February 2016 |page=14 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13672542 |title=THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS AND NOMINATIONS. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=8 February 1888 |accessdate=28 March 2015 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article222438175 |title=BOROUGH OF REDFERN. |newspaper=New South Wales Government Gazette |issue=550 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=28 September 1886 |accessdate=2 June 2016 |page=6578 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1888 he presided over a meeting at [[Redfern Town Hall]] to support the ultimately-unsuccessful candidacy of free trader John Martin for a by-election to the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] seat of [[Electoral district of Redfern|Redfern]]; the meeting was attended by [[Henry Parkes|Sir Henry Parkes]] who also spoke in support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13695695 |title=REDFERN ELECTION.

Beveridge strongly aligned himself with the politics of Parkes and later stood for the seat of Redfern himself as a Free Trade candidate at the [[New South Wales colonial election, 1889|1889 colonial election]], but was unsuccessful, missing out by a margin of over 100 votes, despite the overall success of the Free Trade movement at that election, with Parkes forming government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13712311 |title=Advertising |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |issue=15,868 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=30 January 1889 |accessdate=22 May 2018 |page=12 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13712655 |title=Advertising |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |issue=15,870 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=1 February 1889 |accessdate=22 May 2018 |page=13 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green |first1=Antony |title=NSW Elections – Redfern 1889 |url=https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1889/Redfern.htm |website=NSW Elections Index |publisher=Parliament of New South Wales |accessdate=27 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150826001442/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1889/Redfern.htm |archivedate=26 August 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13712299 |title=THE REDFERN ELECTORATE. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=30 January 1889 |accessdate=28 March 2015 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article160793841 |title=THE ELECTIONS IN NEW SOUTH WALES. |newspaper=[[Adelaide Observer]] |location=SA |date=9 February 1889 |accessdate=28 March 2015 |page=37 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, on 12 June 1890 he was appointed to the Redfern Sub-District Public School Board by the Governor [[Charles Wynn-Carington, 1st Marquess of Lincolnshire|Lord Carrington]], on the advice of Free Trader Minister for Public Instruction, [[Joseph Carruthers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article219922146 |title=PUBLIC SCHOOL BOARDS. |newspaper=[[New South Wales Government Gazette]] |issue=316 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=13 June 1890 |accessdate=29 May 2016 |page=4632 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 February 1891 Beveridge was elected to be mayor of the council and was instrumental in making Redfern the first suburb in Sydney to have electricity and electric street lighting, which occurred when the Council voted unanimously in 1891, following the recommendations of the improvements committee, to build its own power station in Turner Street to power the suburb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article114311716 |title=Advertising |newspaper=Evening News |issue=7376 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=15 January 1891 |accessdate=22 May 2018 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13814379 |title=REDFERN. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=18 February 1891 |accessdate=28 March 2015 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article113884043 |title=A Redfern Loan. |newspaper=[[The Evening News (Sydney)|The Evening News]]|location=Sydney |date=24 April 1891 |accessdate=28 March 2015 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beveridge then proposed and passed through council a loan of £50,000 for the purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article235888446 |title=A REDFERN BOROUGH LOAN. |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |issue=3688 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=24 April 1891 |accessdate=22 May 2018 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article235877997 |title=THE PROPOSED REDFERN LOAN. |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |issue=3691 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=28 April 1891 |accessdate=22 May 2018 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement by the council was later affirmed and protected by the [[Parliament of New South Wales]] when it passed the ''Borough of Redfern Electric Lighting Act 1895''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Borough of Redfern Electric Lighting Act 1895|url=http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/num_act/borela1895nb376.pdf|website=austlii.edu.au|publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute|accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by May 1891 Beveridge had resigned as mayor and an alderman for Redfern prior to his candidacy for the [[New South Wales colonial election, 1891|1891 election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article113882008 |title=Resignation of the Mayor of Redfern. |newspaper=[[The Evening News (Sydney)|The Evening News]]|location=Sydney |date=30 May 1891 |accessdate=28 March 2015 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; His vacancy in Belmore Ward was subsequently filled by [[William Poole (Australian politician)|William Poole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article222097361 |title=BOROUGH OF REDFERN. |newspaper=New South Wales Government Gazette |issue=397 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=23 June 1891 |accessdate=2 June 2016 |page=4632 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beveridge stood again as a Free Trade candidate for Redfern, reaffirming his support for the Free Trade vision for [[Australian Federation]] and noting that overall wages in New South Wales were higher compared to Victoria and taxation was lower owing to the Free Trade system in NSW, a system "that is best for the commercial interests of the colony."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13828422 |title=REDFERN. THE FREETRADE BUNCH. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=17 June 1891 |accessdate=28 March 2015 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beveridge was however again unsuccessful at the June election which saw the Free Traders lose out to the [[Australian Labor Party (New South Wales Branch)|Labor Party]] and the [[Protectionist Party|Protectionists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green |first1=Antony |title=NSW Elections – Redfern 1891 |url=https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1891/Redfern.htm |website=NSW Elections Index |publisher=Parliament of New South Wales |accessdate=27 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150826001528/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1891/Redfern.htm |archivedate=26 August 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Following this defeat, Beveridge returned to business, taking up a high-ranking position in the Sydney office of the [[New York Life Insurance Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article66444966 |title=News in Brief. |newspaper=Windsor and Richmond Gazette|location=NSW |date=13 October 1894 |accessdate=9 October 2015 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 November 1891, Beveridge sold his merchandise business, ''George Griffiths and Co.'' to David Cohen and Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article219925564 |title=Transfer of Trade-mark (registered No. 3,533) under sec. 6 of Trade-marks Act 28 Vic.

===Lithgow===
By 1896, Beveridge had opened his own retail business in the rural and mining town of [[Lithgow]] and involved himself in various community activities, including in cricket. Reporting on his attendance at a Lithgow reception for Premier Reid in May 1896, the ''[[Windsor and Richmond Gazette]]'' noted: "no doubt, ere long Mr. [Beveridge] will take a leading part in matters connected with the welfare of the town, for he is too good a man to be allowed to stay long in clover. His ability is already recognised in his new home, and a matter of a few months will decide whether he enters the Municipal arena or not. If he does, Lithgow will be the gainer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article72548695 |title=TOPICS OF THE DAY. |newspaper=Windsor and Richmond Gazette|location=NSW |date=23 May 1896 |accessdate=9 October 2015 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1896 Beveridge nominated to take up a vacancy on Lithgow Ward on [[City of Lithgow|Lithgow Municipal Council]], but received only 6 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article14036705 |title=MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS. |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |location=NSW |date=10 February 1896 |accessdate=25 January 2016 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year he stood again for Lithgow Ward but lost by one vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article108865231 |title=MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS. |newspaper=[[Empire (newspaper)|Evening News]] |location=Sydney, NSW |date=8 February 1897 |accessdate=25 January 2016 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beveridge became heavily involved in local cricket circles, donating the "Beveridge Cup" for district matches, and becoming President of the Lithgow District Cricket Association in 1899; the patron of the association that year was prominent local politician [[Joseph Cook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71333288 |title=Country Clubs. |newspaper=[[Australian Town and Country Journal]] |location=Sydney, NSW |date=9 September 1899 |accessdate=25 January 2016 |page=52 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A supporter of [[Federation of Australia|Australian Federation]], Beveridge was nominated to attend the People's Federal Convention at [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] in November 1896, which had convened to discuss the 1891 draft Constitution being proposed for the Commonwealth of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article156708966 |title=People's Federal Convention. |newspaper=[[The National advocate|National Advocate (Bathurst, NSW : 1889 - 1954)]] |location=Bathurst, NSW |date=18 November 1896 |accessdate=9 October 2015 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important recommendation made by the convention was that the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] should be directly-elected. In December 1897, Beveridge established the Lithgow Land, Building, and Investment Company and became a company director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article108875515 |title=LITHGOW ITEMS. |newspaper=Evening News|location=Sydney, NSW |date=7 December 1897 |accessdate=9 October 2015 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a longstanding [[Justice of the Peace]], on 23 January 1899 Beveridge was appointed by Governor [[Henry Brand, 2nd Viscount Hampden|Lord Hampden]], on the recommendation of Minister for Justice [[Charles Lee (Australian politician)|Charles Lee]], as [[Coroner]] for Lithgow and for the colony at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28250079 |title=GOVERNMENT GAZETTE. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=25 January 1899 |accessdate=31 March 2015 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article220989471 |title=Government Gazette Appointments and Employment |newspaper=[[New South Wales Government Gazette]] |issue=72 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=24 January 1899 |accessdate=29 May 2016 |page=643 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hay===
By 1901, Beveridge had moved again to the Riverina town of [[Hay, New South Wales|Hay]], and opened his own general merchandise store, "''Beveridge &amp; Co.''", in the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article140157722 |title=Advertising |newspaper=[[The Riverine Grazier]] |issue=3452 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=16 May 1902 |accessdate=30 March 2016 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not long before Beveridge again returned to Cricketing circles, gaining much respect in the Hay Cricket Association, later serving as vice-president, and rising to be President of the Hay Chamber of Commerce in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article144653851 |title=Hay Chamber of Commerce. |newspaper=[[Riverina Times, Hay Standard and Journal of Water Conservation]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=10 October 1901 |accessdate=30 March 2016 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1901, Beveridge was elected as Honorary Secretary at the inaugural meeting of the Hay Free Trade Association and later assisting in the campaign of Free Trade candidate [[James Ashton (politician)|James Ashton]] for the seat of [[Division of Riverina|Riverina]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1901|first federal election]] a month later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article143538934 |title=FREETRADE. |newspaper=The Riverine Grazier |issue=3340 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=22 February 1901 |accessdate=30 March 2016 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article143542414 |title=THE FEDERAL ELECTION. |newspaper=The Riverine Grazier|issue=3349 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=29 March 1901 |accessdate=30 March 2016 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jorge Carlos Vergara Madrigal''' ({{IPA-es|'xoɾxe βeɾˈɣaɾa}}) (born 3 March 1955) is a Mexican businessman and film producer. Vergara is a [[billionaire]] 
with a net worth of approximately $1.5 billion. He is the founder of [[Grupo Omnilife]], one of the top 200 corporations in Mexico. 
In addition to its health products business, Grupo Omnilife owns the [[association football|football]] clubs [[Club Deportivo Guadalajara]] and Chivas Hefei, including a fleet of private jets and real estate.

Vergara has also produced internationally recognized films such as ''[[The Assassination of Richard Nixon]]'' and the Oscar-nominated ''[[Y tu mamá también]]'' through the production company, Producciones Anhelo.

==Career==

===Business===
Born in [[Guadalajara, Jalisco]], Vergara once sold tacos on Mexican streets. Back in the 1980s Vergara sold condominiums and timeshares in [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]], Mexico, where he met and began working with John Peterson.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

When Peterson became a [[Herbalife]] salesperson, he recruited Vergara and together they began selling Herbalife products in Mexico. Since Herbalife had not received Mexican government approval to sell their products, Peterson and Vergara had to smuggle the products into the country. After six months of smuggling the products into Mexico, Herbalife took notice and began the process of getting government approval. Vergara was asked to help get the Herbalife products approved by the Mexican government and was instrumental in helping Herbalife's founder, Mark Hughes deal with the Mexican Government. This gave Vergara insight into how a [[Multi-level marketing|multi-level company]] profits and expands into other countries.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Vergara was partners with Roger Daley, Jim Fobair and Charlie Ragus. With already the 51% of the company, Vergara acquired the rest of Omnitrition at the end of the deal with his U.S. partners and took the whole control of Omnitrition de Mexico.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Since its foundation in 1991, the privately owned corporation has grown from one company, Omnilife de Mexico, to comprise nineteen companies.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Today, approximately 5.2 million people distribute Omnilife products in 22 countries, while the company has reached annual sales of nearly $4.2 billion.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Vergara has been the director of Omnilife de Mexico since 1991.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/hispanicheritage2008/news/story?id=3642048 |title=Chivas USA holding its own in Southern California market - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=15 October 2008 |accessdate=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
In 1999 Vergara met film director [[Alfonso Cuarón]] while seeking out filmmakers for his corporate movies. Cuarón, however, was more interested in filming ''[[Y tu mamá también]]'', and gave Vergara the screenplay. A known lover of films, Vergara read it and right away proposed that they begin production. In the process they established a production company [[Producciones Anhelo]] that would go on to co-produce [[Guillermo del Toro]]'s ''[[El Espinazo Del Diablo]]'' (''The Devil's Backbone''), along with [[Pedro Almodóvar]]'s [[El Deseo]] and del Toro's [https://www.imdb.com/company/co0040776/ Tequila Gang]. Anhelo also produced [[Sebastián Cordero]]'s ''[[Crónicas]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In 2002, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' named Vergara one of its Ten Producers to Watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2002/scene/markets-festivals/10-to-watch-jorge-vergara-1117867479/|title=10 to Watch: Jorge Vergara|last=Tegel|first=Simeon|date=2002-05-14|work=Variety|access-date=2017-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2004 edition of the [[Guadalajara Film Festival]], Vergara created the JVC Award for Best Director, which was given to Fernando Eimbcke for his feature debut [[Temporada de patos]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Chivas===
Vergara gained ownership of the [[Association football|football]] team [[Club Deportivo Guadalajara]] (popularly known as ''Chivas'') in 2002. Shortly after he took ownership in Mexico, while attending the 2004 U.S. [[Major League Soccer]] All-Star Game, he announced intentions to expand Chivas to MLS.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Vergara and MLS inaugurated [[Chivas USA]] in 2004, and the team played its first official season in 2005 with [[StubHub Center]] in the Los Angeles area as its home stadium. Chivas USA was initially successful; in its first five seasons of operation, the team recorded four straight MLS playoff appearances.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Both performance and attendance declined sharply after 2009.&lt;ref name="Baxter"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-mls-chivas-usa-20130530,0,1160192.story|title=When will MLS save Chivas USA from itself?|last=Baxter|first=Kevin|date=30 May 2013|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, Vergara and his former wife became sole owners of the club, buying out former partners Antonio and Lorenzo Cué.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2012/08/29/vergara-fuentes-become-sole-owners-chivas-usa |title=Vergara, Fuentes become sole owners of Chivas USA |publisher=MLSsoccer.com |date= |accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 February 2014, Major League Soccer purchased Chivas USA from Vergara. They announced plans to sell to a buyer dedicated to keeping the club in Los Angeles, as well as a plan to rebrand the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MLS Communications |url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2014/02/20/major-league-soccer-purchases-chivas-usa |title=Major League Soccer purchases Chivas USA |publisher=MLSsoccer.com |date= |accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team, no longer affiliated with Vergara, has the working name [[Los Angeles Football Club]], and began MLS play in 2018.

==Personal life==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=October 2017}}
Vergara has six children: Yelena Vergara Zatarain, Amaury Vergara Zatarian, Kenya Vergara Zatarain, Uma Vergara Lerdo de Tejada, Valentina Vergara and Mariaignacia Vergara.

Jorge Vergara divorced Angélica Fuentes Téllez in 21 September 2015. Jorge Vergara and Rossana Lerdo de Tejada were married 10 June 2017 in Guadalajara, Jalisco, México.

'''Kenneth Hopper''' (formally known as Robert D. Kenneth Hopper), a Scots engineer and now a US citizen, has made a lifelong study of different national manufacturing cultures.  His studies of the origins of America's factory management culture and its influence on Japanese factory management and elsewhere after World War II have received international recognition. He is the author of numerous academic and professional articles on manufacturing and management.

==Biographical Background==
He is married to Claire White Hopper, a former bank executive, and lives in [[Hackettstown, New Jersey]]. His brother, William Hopper, is an investment banker, based in London. Kenneth Hopper was born Glasgow, Scotland (May 1926).&lt;ref&gt;[[Will Hopper]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenneth Hopper is the son of an eminent Scottish professor of chemistry who had been raised on a small farm in Northern Ireland and educated in a one-room schoolhouse through secondary school.  The father's talent, however, earned him a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Science in Dublin.  Professor Hopper, being Irish, was not allowed to serve in the Army during World War I, so he found employment as a graduate foreman with British Dyestuffs ( later the [[Imperial Chemical Industries]], Ltd.). The nitroglycerine section, where he worked, was known as "the land of the one-legged stools," as plant operators could not be allowed to doze off allowing a vat of new highly explosive liquid to overheat and explode. His father, in addition to his duties at the Royal Technical College, was co-author of a respected text on organic chemistry which is still being used. Professor Hopper also headed the Scottish section for the Society of Chemical Industry.  Kenneth recalls many discussions about the chemical industry around the family table, particularly the issues raised about his father's opinion that the Haber labs in Germany were much superior to any British installation.  This question of the superior efficacy of various nations' manufactures was thus an early perception of Kenneth Hopper's.

==Experiential Research Sources==
Hopper attended  "public" schools in Glasgow, graduating in 1942.  During college, he worked one summer as a "production chaser" in the Cathcart Pump works and another in [[G &amp; J Weir]]—a young man with a wheelbarrow fetching parts from remote departments, as he describes it.  This also gave him the opportunity to visit many areas of the works and observe first-hand the practical problems of major manufacturers. He matriculated at [[Glasgow University]], the premiere British training ground for technology.  Upon graduation in 1946, he earned First Class Honours in Mechanical Engineering, Glasgow University.

Pending graduation, he had enlisted in the British Army's [[Royal Corps of Signals|Signal Corps]] Officer Training Corps, but when he reported for duty in 1946, he was [[Demobilization of the British Armed Forces after World War II|"demobbed" along with other World War II servicemen]].  However, this brief contact with the world of radio electronics stimulated an interest in that field that flowed naturally into his later studies of the Civil Communications Section seminars. These post-war seminars were designed by the American occupation for Japanese electronics manufacturers, as there was a considerable need to keep the Japanese population informed of America's postwar reconstruction efforts there.  Mr Hopper also observed that innovations such as radar, penicillin, and the jet engine came from English inventors, but each of these was turned to another nation, often America, for manufacturing. This was blatantly obvious during the war when fleets of merchant vessels had to be employed to bring parts back to Great Britain that could have been made on the island kingdom, a tragic story of submarine warfare that Hopper heard from P&amp;G's principle fitter.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Radar's refinement from a non-directional to a directional scanning device, for instance, came from the Bell Laboratories of Summit, New Jersey, USA.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}   So, Mr. Hopper entered the manufacturing phase of his career with a keen awareness of the need for understanding how industries evolved innovative practices.

Mr. Hopper served a graduate apprenticeship at [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] from 1946 to 1948, in Manchester, England, then worked for [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] (UK) from 1948 to 1957. There he was engineer in charge on the start-up of P&amp;G's Manchester high pressure hydrolysis unit for making soap and on the start-up of P&amp;G's first Standard Tower Unit for making synthetic detergents outside the US.
More to the point, as a P&amp;G engineer he was responsible for applying P&amp;G's long-established Just-in-Time Production Control Method. In 1957, as Head of Mechanical Methods and Planning, he led the first introduction of P&amp;G's advanced participative industrial management methods outside the US.  On a 1957 visit to the US Hopper met Prof. Peter Drucker, who stimulated his interest in the work of the Civil Communications Section during the American Occupation of Japan.

Mr. Hopper expanded on those accomplishments at P&amp;G, and from 1957 to 1962, was a consultant with Associated Industrial Consultants (AIC).  He helped Irish manufacturers and the Irish Government reorganise to meet Common Market competition in the early years of the Celtic Miracle.
•	From 1961 to 1962 he represented the Irish Hosiery Manufacturers on the Committee on Industrial Organization (CIO) and was joint author of the CIO 1962 Report on the Irish Hosiery industry.

From 1962 to 1963, he was a member of AIC's Division of Industrial and Human Relations, working with manufacturers in the UK.  Mr Hopper returned to general consulting with Belgian and French industry in 1964–65. He worked with both the funeral and wine businesses on the continent.

==Issues and Publications==
A grant from the Foundation for Management Education allowed Hopper to carry out research on college graduate foremen at the Harvard Business School from 1965 to 1966, some of which was published by the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;Hopper, Kenneth, "The Growing Use of College Graduates as Foremen," Management Personnel Quarterly (6.2) Summer/Fall 1966. pp. 2–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Entering consulting practice in the US, he provided seminars for Industrial Education International in the US, Canada and the UK and continued publishing articles on the strategy of placing college graduates in strategic manufacturing positions as foremen to get "on the ground" experience .&lt;ref&gt;Hopper, Kenneth,"The Nature of American Management". Moor Gate and Wall Street. Autumn number. 1966.  pp. 34–51.&lt;/ref&gt; This practice was still rare outside of American industry in the Sixties, and with the rise of a certain business school curriculum that promoted financial management over most other skills, it became rarer even in US industry in subsequent decades.  His seminal article, "Can the US Stay Competitive?"  raised his profile among industrialists for a time.&lt;ref&gt;Hopper, Kenneth, "Can the US Stay Competitive?"  [[American Machinist]] (114.15), July 1970. pp. 65–70.&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1970 onwards. However, illness restricted Mr. Hopper from active consulting but allowed him to pursue research into comparative factory management from his base in New Jersey, and he developed a considerable collection of primary and secondary documents as background for a major publication.  This research effort revived the interest of some academic scholars (such as Myron Tribus, emeritus Dean of the Tuck Business School at Dartmouth) in lesser known members of the US Occupation team which sparked the Japanese Miracle after World War II:

•	Frank A. Polkinghorn
•	Charles W. Protzman
•	Homer M. Sarasohn
•	Joseph M. Juran&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph M. Juran]]&lt;/ref&gt; and, of course,
•	W. Edwards Deming&lt;ref&gt;[[W. Edwards Deming]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, with his health much improved, Hopper took his studies to the Japanese, making a five-week tour of Japanese industry, sponsored by Mr. Bunzaemon Inoue, former chairman of the Sumitomo Group. He subsequently publishing several articles about his findings.&lt;ref&gt;Hopper, Kenneth,"Creating Japan's New Industrial Management: the Americans as Teachers” Human Resource Management (21.2 and 21.3) Summer/Fall 1982. pp. 13–34.&lt;/ref&gt;    He continued to publish occasionally while working with his brother, William Hopper, on a major book,  ''The Puritan Gift.''   Hopper, Kenneth and William Hopper, The Puritan Gift.  NY: I.B. Tauris/Macmillan, 2007. He also developed an interest in American colonial history and lectured on various subjects at Waterloo Village, a restored canal museum (now defunct) in western New Jersey.  Kenneth also provided a background seminar on sailing ships for NBC news announcers, John Chancellor and David Brinkley, during the 1975 New York Bi-Centennial Tall Ships festival.

In 1994, the brothers organised and contributed to a major seminar on the work of MacArthur’s Civil Communications Section at the Japanese Embassy, London, chaired by Lord Howe, former British Foreign Secretary and attended by manufacturing, governmental and financial leaders from the European Union as well as Asian and East European nations.

Book Reviews: Among the many very positive reviews of The Puritan Gift we note that The London Financial Times called the Hoppers' book "one of the most important business books of the past decade”   Stefan Stern, The Financial Times, 22 December 2009 and The Harvard Business Review reviewed it as “This astonishing book about American managerial culture … 'I’ve never read a business book that packed so much information, history, and insight into one compact volume.”  	         Harvard Business Review, January 2010. Senior Editor, Sarah Cliffe

'''Kim Tai-chung''' (June 5, 1957 – August 27, 2011), also known as '''Kim Tai-jong''' or '''Tong Lung''' (唐龍; Chinese stage name), was a [[Korea]]n born [[taekwondo]] practitioner martial artist actor and businessman. Kim is perhaps best known as the ghost of [[Bruce Lee]] in 1986 film ''[[No Retreat, No Surrender]]''.

==History and early career==

===Acting===
In the 1970s, Kim made his first Hong Kong movie debut in 1977 film ''[[Snuff Bottle Connection]]'', along with [[Hwang Jang-lee|Hwang Jang Lee]] and [[Roy Horan]]. Kim played Bruce Lee’s character Billy Lo in 1978 film ''[[Game of Death#Game of Death .281978.29|Game of Death]]'', alongside [[Yuen Biao]] (who performed the acrobatics and stunts), Kim played Lee's character so well that the producers used him again a few years later.

In the 1980s, Kim played Bobby Lo in 1981 film ''[[Game of Death II]]'' alongside Hwang Jang Lee, Roy Horan, To Wai-wo and Lee Hoi-san. After ''Game of Death II'', Kim returned to Korea and playing Master Bruce in 1982 film ''Jackie vs. Bruce to the Rescue'' (also known as ''Fist of Death'') along with Lee Siu-ming (A Taiwanese Stuntman and [[Jackie Chan]] look alike.), and another Korean film ''[[Miss, Please Be Patient]]'', it was released in September 1981.

In June 1985, Chinese film producer [[Ng See-yuen]] was looking for an actor to play the ghost of Bruce Lee in 1986 film ''[[No Retreat, No Surrender]]'' in his American debut and final film, which marked the film debut of Belgian martial artist actor [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] as Ivan Kraschinsky. Kim played Bruce Lee to training [[Kurt McKinney]]'s martial artist.

===Retired from acting===
After ''No Retreat, No Surrender'', Kim returned to Korea and retired from acting at the age of 29 and became a businessman.

In 2008, Kim made a rare public appearance in Korea as part of a screening of ''[[Miss, Please Be Patient]]'' (아가씨 참으세요),&lt;ref name="Puchon"&gt;[http://history.pifan.com/film/film_detail.asp?f_num=12&amp;cat1=173&amp;cat2=&amp;uid=2413 The Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival History: Miss, Please be Patient] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721080926/http://history.pifan.com/film/film_detail.asp?f_num=12&amp;cat1=173&amp;cat2=&amp;uid=2413 |date=2011-07-21 }} Retrieved on 22 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; which had originally been released in 1981. Kim had played a leading role in that film.

==Death==
On August 27, 2011, Kim died of stomach hemorrhage at the age of 54.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hkcinemagic.com/en/people.asp?id=4168|title=Hong Kong Cinemagic - Kim Tai Jung}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityonfire.com/kim-tai-chung-1943-2011-dead-died-death-jung/|title=R.I.P.

The Alternative Investments Society was founded in 2006 by a group of undergraduate students at the LSE, and continues to be run by students from the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lseaic.com/about/|title=About - LSE AIC|work=LSE AIC|access-date=2017-08-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Alternative Investments Conference was a one-day event hosted on the LSE campus in 2007, and was attended by 200 students who heard from several notable investors. The AIC has evolved considerably over its twelve-year history, having changed venues and ultimately becoming the world’s largest student conference on hedge funds, private equity and venture capital.

'''Lawrence Berry Washington''' (November 26, 1811 – September 21, 1856) was an American lawyer, military officer, author, [[California Gold Rush#Forty-niners|Forty-niner]], [[Border Ruffian]], and a member of the Washington family. Washington was born on his family's [[Cedar Lawn]] plantation near [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town]], [[Virginia]] (present-day [[West Virginia]]) and was the eldest of 13 children. He practiced law, then served as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[Virginia militia|Virginia Volunteers]] during the [[Mexican–American War]]. During his service in the war, Washington reportedly wore the sword of his great-granduncle George Washington.

Following the Mexican–American War, Washington traveled to California in 1849 as a [[California Gold Rush#Forty-niners|Forty-niner]] in the [[California Gold Rush]] and authored the novel, ''A Tale to be Told Some Fifty Years Hence''. Washington then relocated east to Missouri in the 1850s, where he remained for a few years and fought as a [[Border Ruffian]] during the [[Bleeding Kansas]] confrontations over [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] along the border between [[Kansas Territory]] and Missouri. While under the command of Captain [[Henry Clay Pate]], Washington was present at the June 1856 [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Stater]] attack known as [[Battle of Black Jack]], where he sustained minor injuries. Washington died by drowning after falling overboard from a [[steamboat]] on the [[Missouri River]] in September 1856. His family's descendants claim Washington was murdered by [[Jayhawker]]s.

Washington was a great-grandson of [[Samuel Washington]], a great-grandnephew of first [[President of the United States]] [[George Washington]], a great-grandson of [[Robert Rutherford (congressman)|Robert Rutherford]], a [[United States House of Representatives|United States House Representative]] from Virginia, and a nephew of [[Henry Bedinger|Henry Bedinger III]], also a member of the U.S. House of Representatives.

In July 1847, the ''Charlestown Free Press'' in Charles Town published a letter from Washington in which he praised then General [[Zachary Taylor]] as a potential [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] candidate for President.&lt;ref name="BLT1"&gt;{{cite news| title =Gen.

While at [[Fort Monroe]] in [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]], Virginia, after the company's return east, Washington drafted a letter dated May 7, 1848, to [[United States Secretary of War]] [[William L.

== Later careers and pursuits ==
Following his service in the Mexican–American War, Washington joined the Charles Town Mining Company and traveled to California in 1849 as a [[California Gold Rush#Forty-niners|Forty-niner]] in the [[California Gold Rush]] with his brother Benjamin Franklin Washington; however, there are no existing records of Washington finding gold during his pursuit.&lt;ref name="Bacon1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Wallace2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "TODJ1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Wayland1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wayland|1998|p=241.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in California, Washington authored the novel, ''A Tale to be Told Some Fifty Years Hence'', which was published in 1853.&lt;ref name="McGee1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Washington1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Washington|1853|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington then relocated east to Missouri in the 1850s, where he remained for a few years and fought as a [[Border Ruffian]] during the [[Bleeding Kansas]] confrontations over [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] along the border between [[Kansas Territory]] and Missouri.&lt;ref name = "Wallace2"/&gt; While in Missouri, Washington wrote poetry and contributed to local newspapers.&lt;ref name="Bacon1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "TODJ1"/&gt; He returned to Virginia later in the 1850s.&lt;ref name = "Welles1"/&gt; While in Virginia, Washington again applied for a military office in March 1855 under an expansion in the [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]] after Congress added two new regiments to protect the large additional territory obtained from Mexico.&lt;ref name = "Mahon1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mahon|Danysh|1972|p=18.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RD1"&gt;{{cite news| title =Appointments in the New Regiments| newspaper =Richmond Dispatch| publication-place =[[Richmond, Virginia]]| date =March 12, 1855| page =1| url =https://www.newspapers.com/image/79770740/| accessdate =April 21, 2015| deadurl =no| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160304061012/http://www.newspapers.com/image/79770740/| archivedate =March 4, 2016| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SS1"&gt;{{cite news| title =News from all Quarters.| newspaper =Squatter Sovereign| publication-place =[[Atchison, Kansas]]| date =April 10, 1855| page =3| url =https://www.newspapers.com/image/49604697/| accessdate =April 21, 2015| deadurl =no| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060721/http://www.newspapers.com/image/49604697/| archivedate =March 4, 2016| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December 1855, Washington was in [[Kanawha County, West Virginia|Kanawha County]] where he established a joint stock company to promote emigration to Kansas.&lt;ref name="RD2"&gt;{{cite news| title =Major L.

==Theoretical American royal succession==
According to a May 1908 article in ''The Scrap Book'' entitled "If Washington Had Been Crowned" and later in a February 1951 article in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' entitled "If Washington Had Become King: A Carpenter or an Engineer Might Now Rule the U.S.," Lawrence Berry Washington would have succeeded his father, John Thornton Augustine Washington, as "king" of the United States had his great-granduncle, George Washington, accepted the position of monarch rather than that of president.&lt;ref name="Bacon1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Wallace1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wallace|1951|p=108.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Smolenyak1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smolenyak|2008|p=27.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the course of 1908 and 1909, the theoretical Washington family royal succession was further publicized in the ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'', ''The Washington Post'', ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'', ''Pittsburgh Daily Post'', ''The Oregon Daily Journal'', and ''The Wichita Daily Eagle''.&lt;ref name = "TODJ1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "WaPo1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "TCE1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PDP1"&gt;{{cite news| title =The Man Who Would Now Be King of the United States| newspaper =Pittsburgh Daily Post| publication-place =[[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]| date =August 16, 1908| page =21| url =https://www.newspapers.com/image/86589411/| accessdate =April 21, 2015| deadurl =no| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231406/http://www.newspapers.com/image/86589411/| archivedate =March 3, 2016| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TWDE1"&gt;{{cite news| title =Washington's Nearest Heirs: One of Them is a Druggist at Index, Missouri.| newspaper =The Wichita Daily Eagle| publication-place =[[Wichita, Kansas]]| date =August 12, 1908| page =4| url =https://www.newspapers.com/image/63219130/| accessdate =April 21, 2015| deadurl =no| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023825/http://www.newspapers.com/image/63219130/| archivedate =March 4, 2016| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the laws of male preference [[primogeniture]] [[Succession to the British throne|succession]] recognized by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] at the time of [[American Revolution|American independence]], Lawrence Berry Washington would have been the lawful [[heir apparent]] to his father, who was the eldest son of Thornton Augustine Washington, who in turn was the eldest son of Samuel Washington, George Washington's eldest full brother.&lt;ref name="Bacon1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Wallace1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Smolenyak1"/&gt; A theoretical "King Lawrence I of the United States" would have had a reign spanning from his father's death in 1841 until his own death in 1856.&lt;ref name = "Wallace1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Smolenyak1"/&gt; Following his death, the American crown would have passed to his next eldest brother, Daniel Bedinger Washington.&lt;ref name = "Wallace2"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Smolenyak1"/&gt;

[[File:Liquidnitrogen.jpg|thumb|Liquid nitrogen]]
'''Liquefaction of gases''' is physical conversion of a [[gas]] into a [[liquid]] state ([[condensation]]).

==Details==
The processes are used for scientific, industrial and commercial purposes. Many gases can be put into a liquid state at normal [[atmospheric pressure]] by simple cooling; a few, such as [[carbon dioxide]], require pressurization as well. [[Liquefaction]] is used for analyzing the fundamental properties of gas molecules (intermolecular forces), for storage of gases, for example: [[liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]], and in [[refrigeration]] and [[air conditioning]]. There the gas is liquefied in the ''[[condenser (laboratory)|condenser]]'', where the [[heat of vaporization]] is released, and evaporated in the ''[[evaporator]],'' where the heat of vaporization is absorbed. [[Ammonia]] was the first such [[refrigerant]], and is still in widespread use in industrial refrigeration, but it has largely been replaced by compounds derived from [[petroleum]] and [[halogen]]s in residential and commercial applications.  

[[Liquid oxygen]] is provided to hospitals for conversion to gas for patients with breathing problems, and [[liquid nitrogen]] is used in the medical field for [[cryosurgery]], and by inseminators to freeze [[semen]]. Liquefied [[chlorine]] is transported for eventual solution in water, after which  it is used for water purification, sanitation of [[industrial waste]], sewage and swimming pools, bleaching of pulp and textiles and manufacture of [[carbon tetrachloride]], [[glycol]] and numerous other organic compounds as well as [[phosgene]] gas.

Liquefaction of [[helium]] ([[Liquid helium|&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He]]) with the precooled [[Hampson–Linde cycle]] led to a [[Nobel Prize]] for [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]] in 1913. At ambient pressure the boiling point of [[liquid helium|liquefied helium]] is {{convert|4.22|K|°C|abbr=on}}.  Below 2.17&amp;nbsp;K liquid &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He becomes a [[superfluid]] ([[Nobel Prize]] 1978, [[Pyotr Kapitsa]]) and shows characteristic properties such as heat conduction through [[second sound]], zero [[viscosity]] and the [[Superfluid helium-4|fountain effect]] among others.

The liquefaction of gases is a complicated process that uses various compressions and expansions to achieve high pressures and very low temperatures, using, for example, [[turboexpander]]s.  

The liquefaction of air is used to obtain [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[argon]] and other atmospheric [[noble gas]]es by separating the air components by [[fractional distillation]] in a [[Air separation|cryogenic air separation unit]].

==History==

{{see|Timeline of low-temperature technology}}

==Liquid air==

{{main|Liquid air}}

===Linde's process===

Air is liquefied by the [[Linde process]], in which air is alternately compressed, cooled, and expanded, each expansion results in a considerable reduction in temperature. With the lower temperature the molecules move more slowly and occupy less space, so the air changes phase to become liquid.

===Claude's process===
Air can also be liquefied by [[Georges Claude|Claude]]'s process in which the gas is allowed to expand [[isentropic process|isentropically]] twice in two chambers. While expanding, the gas has to do work as it is led through an [[expansion turbine]]. The gas is not yet liquid, since that would destroy the turbine. Commercial air liquefication plants bypass this problem by expanding the air at [[supercritical fluid|supercritical]] pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Industrial Gases |last=Greenwood |first=Harold Cecil |year=1919 |publisher=D. Van Nostrand |page=87 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qz9DAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Final liquefaction takes place by [[isenthalpic process|isenthalpic]] expansion in a [[thermal expansion valve]].

'''Meyer Guggenheim''' (February 1, 1828 – March 15, 1905)&lt;ref name=britannica /&gt; was the [[patriarch]] of what became known as the [[Guggenheim family]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Lengnau, Aargau|Lengnau]], [[Aargau]], Switzerland on February 1, 1828. He was of [[Ashkenazi Jew]]ish ancestry and emigrated to the United States in 1847.&lt;ref name=britannica /&gt;  He started out in the importing business, but made his and his family's fortune (which was one of the largest fortunes of the 19th century) in [[mining]] and [[smelting]].

Guggenheim invested in silver mines of the [[Leadville mining district]] of [[Colorado]]. From mining he expanded into ore smelting, also in Colorado, then built a number of smelters across the US and in northern Mexico. As his sons grew up, they took leading roles in the family mining and smelting business.&lt;ref&gt;National Mining Hall of Fame, [http://www.mininghalloffame.org/inductee.asp?i=32&amp;b=inductees%2Easp&amp;t=n&amp;p=G&amp;s= Meyer Guggenheim], accessed 13 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Guggenheim and his wife Barbara had ten surviving children.  Five of his seven sons were active in the family businesses:

*[[Isaac Guggenheim]] (1854–1922)
*[[Daniel Guggenheim]] (1856–1930), head of the family after his father's death, who was the most active of his sons in developing and acquiring worldwide mining interests
*[[Murry Guggenheim]] (1858–1939), originally in the lace and embroidery import business and by 1881, involved in mining and smelting
*[[Solomon R. Guggenheim|Solomon Robert Guggenheim]] (1861–1949), a supporter of [[modern art]] through [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation|his foundation]] and donations to the [[Museum of Modern Art]]
*[[Simon Guggenheim|(John) Simon Guggenheim]] (1867–1941), a one-term [[United States Senate|senator]] from [[Colorado]]
*[[Benjamin Guggenheim]] (1865–1912), who died in the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']] disaster

'''''Morton v Douglas Homes Ltd''''' has become an important case in New Zealand as a result of the [[leaky homes crisis]]. The salience of the case comes from the fact that [[Michael Hardie Boys|Justice Hardie Boys]] held the directors of a building company personally liable for damage caused by defective foundations.&lt;ref&gt;''Morton v Douglas Homes Ltd'' [1984] 2 NZLR 548 at 548.&lt;/ref&gt; The case has been described in the [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand|Court of Appeal]] as one that, "certainly provides some authority for the view that the directors of a building company with actual control of particular building operations owe a duty of care, associated with that control."&lt;ref&gt;''Body Corporate 202254 v Taylor'' [2009] 2 NZLR 17 at 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Between 1976 and 1977 Douglas Homes Ltd built four flats in a residential subdivision in [[Waimairi County]], [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] over the top of an old shingle pit.&lt;ref&gt;''Morton v Douglas Homes Ltd'' [1984] 2 NZLR 548 at 554.&lt;/ref&gt; Before construction, "the directors had been advised by an engineer on the work necessary for the laying of foundations for two flats. One of the directors did not ensure that the engineer’s advice was adhered to in the construction of the foundations of one flat. The other director specifically took charge of the works on the other, and failed to ensure the engineer’s advice was followed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.thornton.net.nz/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/In_Pursuit_of_the_directors.pdf|title = In pursuit of the directors|last = Thornton|first = Michael|date = 13 April 2007|journal = NZLawyer|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment==
Hardie Boys J reasoned that the directors of Douglas Homes Ltd could be held liable for their negligence as, "The principle of limited liability protects shareholders and not directors, and a director is as responsible for his own torts as any other servant or agent."&lt;ref&gt;''Trevor Ivory Ltd v Anderson'' [1992] 2 NZLR 517 at 547.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardie Boys J held that in establishing whether a director owed a duty of care the test was to be that established in ''[[Anns v Merton LBC|Anns v Merton London Borough Council]]'' [1978] AC 728 and that a duty of care was founded upon the control a director exercised over the operations of a company.
 
{{Cquote|The relevance of the degree of control which a director has over the operations of the company is that it provides a test of whether or not his personal carelessness may be likely to cause damage to a third party, so that he becomes subject to a duty of care. It is not the fact that he is a director that creates the control, but rather that the fact of control, however derived, may create the duty. There is therefore no essential difference in this respect between a director and a general manager or indeed a more humble employee of the company. Each is under a duty of care, both to those with whom he deals on the company's behalf and to those with whom the company deals in so far as that dealing is subject to his control.|author=Hardie Boys J|source=''Morton v Douglas Homes Ltd'''&lt;ref&gt;''Trevor Ivory Ltd v Anderson'' [1992] 2 NZLR 517 at 548.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Significance==
The ratio has not yet been overturned and as such remains a precedent for holding directors liable for defects in construction that was under their control. In 2006 in ''Dicks v Hobson Swan Construction Limited (in liquidation),'' [[David Baragwanath|Justice Baragwanath]] applied the ratio of the case to hold a director personally liable for a [[Leaky homes crisis|leaky building]] constructed by his company.&lt;ref&gt;''Dicks v Hobson Swan Construction Limited (in liquidation)''  HC Auckland CIV 2004-404-1065, 20 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2010 appeal from the Weathertight Homes Tribunal Justice Wylie noted the correct approach to searching for directorial liability lay through the test articulated in ''Morton v Douglas Homes Ltd'';

{{Cquote|...it should have asked itself whether the elements of the tort of negligence were made out against each of [the directors]. In doing so, it should have borne in mind the presumption against the imposition of personal responsibility where the director was simply acting on behalf of the company. It should have asked itself whether the director assumed personal liability for the relevant conduct. The degree of control test articulated by Hardie Boys J in Morton is likely to be of considerable help in answering that question.|author=Wylie J|source=''Chee v Stareast Investment Limited'''&lt;ref&gt;''Chee v Stareast Investment Limited'' HC Auckland CIV 2009-404-005255, 1 April 2010 at [113].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Naud Junction''' was an area in northern [[Downtown Los Angeles]], [[California]].  It was located at the junction of [[Main Street (Los Angeles)|Main Street]] and [[Alameda Street]], where [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] trains veered off Alameda to tracks along Alhambra Avenue and the [[Los Angeles River]].  

==History==
It is named for French-American warehouseman Edouard Naud, who built a warehouse at the junction in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lapl.org/collections-resources/visual-collections/california-index |title=California Index Search for Naud Junction }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Naud Junction was marked by a signal tower built at Alameda and Ord streets in 1898. This was torn down in 1940, after [[Los Angeles Union Station|Union Station]] was built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Old Signal Tower Razed: Railroad Landmark at Naud Junction Gives Way to Progress |author= |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 5, 1940 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boxing pavilion==
From 1905 to 1913, Naud Junction was the location of the city of Los Angeles' primary boxing pavilion, which was built by promoter [[Thomas McCarey]].  The pavilion paid host to both the world middleweight championship between Hugo Kelly and [[Tommy Burns (boxer)|Tommy Burns]], a heavyweight championship bout between Burns and [[Marvin Hart]], and a featherweight championship bout between [[Abe Attell]] and Frankie Nell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wrecking Old Naud Junction: Famous Fight Pavilion Is Torn Down |author= |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=October 25, 1913 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

It was also witness to a [[Billy Sunday]] crusade in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |title=Billy Sunday in the Ring.: Picturesque Evangelist at Naud Junction |date=January 30, 1909 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Petrodollar recycling''' is the international spending or investment of a country's revenues from [[petroleum]] exports ("'''petrodollars'''"). It generally refers to the phenomenon of major [[List of countries by oil exports|petroleum-exporting nations]], mainly the [[OPEC#Membership|OPEC members]] plus [[Russia]] and [[Norway]], earning more money from the export of crude oil than they could efficiently invest in their own economies. The resulting global interdependencies and financial flows, from oil producers back to oil consumers, can reach a scale of hundreds of billions of [[US dollars]] per year – including a wide range of transactions in a variety of currencies, some [[Currency peg|pegged]] to the US dollar and some not. These flows are heavily influenced by government-level decisions regarding international investment and aid, with important consequences for both [[global finance]] and [[petroleum politics]]. The phenomenon is most pronounced during periods when the [[price of oil]] is historically high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nsouli |first=Saleh M. |title=Petrodollar Recycling and Global Imbalances |url=http://www.imf.org/en/news/articles/2015/09/28/04/53/sp032306a |publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]] |date=March 23, 2006 |accessdate=January 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term petrodollar was coined in the early 1970s during the [[OPEC oil crisis|oil crisis]], and the first major petrodollar surge (1974–1981) resulted in more financial complications than the second (2005–2014).&lt;ref name="kinzer"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kinzer |first1=Stephen |title=All the Shah's Men: An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror |publisher=Wiley |isbn=047018549X |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capital flows==

===Background===
Especially during the years [[1970s energy crisis|1974–1981]] and [[2000s energy crisis|2005–2014]], oil exporters amassed large surpluses of "petrodollars" from historically expensive oil.&lt;ref name=EIA2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=EIA2015&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/regions-topics.cfm?RegionTopicID=OPEC |title=OPEC Revenues Fact Sheet |publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration |date=May 15, 2017 |accessdate=May 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=profusion&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21553424 |title=Petrodollar Profusion |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=April 28, 2012 |accessdate=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The word has been credited alternately to Egyptian-American economist [[Ibrahim Oweiss]] and to former [[US Secretary of Commerce]] [[Peter G. Peterson]], both in 1973.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wrmea.org/1983-december-26/personality-ibrahim-m.-oweiss.html |title=Personality: Ibrahim M.

Alternatively, global economic growth would have suffered if that money was withdrawn from the world economy, while the oil-exporting nations needed to be able to invest profitably to raise their long-term standards of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/center/mm/eng/mm_rs_03.htm |title=Petrodollar Problem |publisher=International Monetary Fund |accessdate=January 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1974–1981 surge===
While petrodollar recycling reduced the short-term [[1973–75 recession|recessionary]] impact of the [[1973 oil crisis]], it caused problems especially for oil-importing countries that were paying much higher prices for oil, and incurring long-term debts. The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) estimated that the foreign debts of 100 oil-importing [[developing countries]] increased by 150% between 1973 and 1977, complicated further by a worldwide shift to [[floating exchange rate]]s. [[Johan Witteveen]], the Managing Director of the IMF, said in 1974: "The international monetary system is facing its most difficult period since the 1930s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/center/mm/eng/rs_sub_3.htm |title=Recycling Petrodollars |publisher=International Monetary Fund |accessdate=January 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IMF administered a new lending program during 1974–1976 called the Oil Facility. Funded by oil-exporting nations and other lenders, it was available to nations suffering from acute problems with their [[balance of trade]] due to the rise in oil prices, notably including [[Italy]] and the [[UK]] as well as dozens of developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=International Balance of Payments Financing and the Budget Process |publisher=[[U.S. Congressional Budget Office]] |first=Carl Richard |last=Neu |date=August 1977 |pages=27–29 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VK6wuXHuPJkC&amp;pg=PA27 |accessdate=February 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1974 through 1981, the total [[current account]] surplus for all members of OPEC amounted to US$450&amp;nbsp;billion, without scaling-up for the subsequent decades of inflation. Ninety percent of this surplus was accumulated by the [[Arab countries]] of the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Libya]], with [[Iran]] also accumulating significant oil surpluses through 1978 before suffering the hardships of [[Iranian Revolution|revolution]], [[Iran–Iraq War|war]] and [[Sanctions against Iran|sanctions]].&lt;ref name=Oweiss&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://faculty.georgetown.edu/imo3/petrod/petro2.htm |chapter=Economics of Petrodollars |title=The Economic Dimensions of Middle Eastern History |pages=179–199 |authorlink=Ibrahim Oweiss |first=Ibrahim M. |last=Oweiss |editor-first1=Haleh |editor-last1=Esfandiari |editor-first2=A.L. |editor-last2=Udovitch |publisher=Darwin Press |date=1990 |accessdate=January 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large volumes of Arab petrodollars were invested directly in [[US Treasury securities]] and in other financial markets of the major industrial economies, often directed discreetly by government entities now known as [[sovereign wealth funds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David E. |last=Spiro |title=The Hidden Hand of American Hegemony: Petrodollar Recycling and International Markets |location=Ithaca |publisher=[[Cornell University Press]] |date=1999 |isbn=0-8014-2884-X |pages=74–75 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3vWgRS_itIC&amp;pg=PA74 |accessdate=February 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-05-30/the-untold-story-behind-saudi-arabia-s-41-year-u-s-debt-secret |title=The Untold Story Behind Saudi Arabia's 41-Year U.S. Debt Secret |first=Andrea |last=Wong |publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=May 30, 2016 |accessdate=May 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many billions of petrodollars were also invested through the major [[commercial bank]]s of the US and Europe. In fact, the process contributed to the growth of the [[Eurodollar]] market as a less-regulated rival to US monetary markets. As the recessionary condition of the world economy made investment in corporations less attractive, bankers and well-financed governments lent much of the money directly to the governments of developing countries, especially in Latin America such as [[Economy of Brazil|Brazil]] and [[Economy of Argentina|Argentina]]&lt;ref name=Oweiss/&gt; as well as other major developing nations like [[Turkey]]. The 1973 oil crisis had created a vast dollar shortage in these countries; however, they still needed to finance their imports of oil and machinery. In early 1977, when Turkey stopped heating its prime minister's office, opposition leader [[Suleyman Demirel]] famously described the shortage as: "Turkey is in need of 70&amp;nbsp;cents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OY09BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34 |title=State–Business Alliances and Economic Development: Turkey, Mexico and North Africa |first=Işık |last=Özel |publisher=[[Routledge]] |date=2014 |isbn=978-1-317-81782-6 |page=34 |accessdate=January 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As political journalist [[William Greider]] summarized the situation: "Banks collected the deposits of revenue-rich OPEC governments and lent the money to developing nations so they could avoid bankruptcy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lFWuAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=revenue-rich |first=William |last=Greider |authorlink=William Greider |title=Secrets of the Temple |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |date=1987 |isbn=978-0-671-47989-3 |page=340 |accessdate=January 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent decades, many of these developing nations found their [[Latin American debt crisis|accumulated debts]] to be [[Unpayable debt|unpayably large]], concluding that it was a form of [[neocolonialism]] from which [[debt relief]] was the only escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606040838/http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/ebook2/contents/part4-I.shtml |chapter=Foreign Debt: Forgiveness and Repudiation |url=http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/ebook2/ebook.shtml |title=The E-Book on International Finance &amp; Development |first1=Enrique |last1=Carrasco |first2=Charles |last2=McClellan |first3=Jane |last3=Ro |publisher=[[University of Iowa]] |date=April 2007 |accessdate=June 6, 2011 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606000610/http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/ebook2/ebook.shtml |archivedate=June 6, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005–2014 surge===
[[File:InflationAndInterestRates.png|thumb|alt=refer to caption|Inflation and interest rates surged with oil prices in the 1970s, but not in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?graph_id=239792 |title=Federal Reserve Economic Data graph |publisher=[[Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis]] |accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the 2005–2014 petrodollar surge, financial decision-makers were able to benefit somewhat from the lessons and experiences of the previous cycle. Developing economies generally stayed better balanced than they did in the 1970s; the world economy was less oil-intensive; and global inflation and interest rates were much better contained. Oil exporters opted to make most of their investments directly into a diverse array of global markets, and the recycling process was less dependent on intermediary channels such as international banks and the IMF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/esa/ffd/events/2007debtworkshop/david%20lubin.pdf |title=Petrodollars, emerging markets and vulnerability |first=David |last=Lubin |publisher=[[Citigroup]] |date=March 19, 2007 |accessdate=January 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/5136281 |title=Recycling the Petrodollars |newspaper=The Economist |date=November 10, 2005 |accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/08/08/oil-liquidity-petrodollars-biz_0811oxford.html |title=World Economy Less Vulnerable To Petrodollars |author=Oxford Analytica |date=August 11, 2008 |accessdate=January 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign aid==
Oil-exporting countries have used part of their petrodollar surpluses to fund [[foreign aid]] programs, as a prominent example of so-called "[[checkbook diplomacy]]" or "[[petro-Islam]]". The [[Kuwait Fund]] was an early leader since 1961, and certain Arab nations became some of the largest donors in the years since 1974, including through the IMF and the [[OPEC Fund for International Development]].&lt;ref name=Oweiss/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kuwait-fund.org/timeLine/?lang=en |title=Timeline |publisher=Kuwait Fund |accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/world/middleeast/cables-released-by-wikileaks-reveal-saudis-checkbook-diplomacy.html |title=Cables Released by WikiLeaks Reveal Saudis' Checkbook Diplomacy |first=Ben |last=Hubbard |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 21, 2015 |accessdate=February 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oil exporters have also aided poorer nations indirectly through the personal [[remittances]] sent home by tens of millions of [[Foreign worker#Foreign workers in Middle East|foreign workers in the Middle East]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2016-02-04/oil-s-plunge-spills-over |title=Oil's Plunge Spills Over |first=Andy |last=Mukherjee |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=February 4, 2016 |accessdate=February 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although their working conditions are generally harsh.&lt;ref name=migrants/&gt; Even more controversially, several oil exporters have been major [[State-sponsored terrorism|financial supporters of armed groups]] challenging the governments of other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/10/27/iranian-general-tehran-arming-liberation-armies.html |title=Iranian General: Tehran Arming 'Liberation Armies' |date=October 27, 2008 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cbb_DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA208 |title=The Role of Terrorism in 21st-Century Warfare |first1=Leonard |last1=Weinberg |first2=Susanne |last2=Martin |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2016 |isbn=978-1-78499764-9 |at="Libya", pp. 207–208 |accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/hillary-clinton-wikileaks-email-isis-saudi-arabia-qatar-us-allies-funding-barack-obama-knew-all-a7362071.html |title=US allies Saudi Arabia and Qatar are funding ISIS |first=Patrick |last=Cockburn |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=October 14, 2016 |accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pacepa |first=Ion Mihai |authorlink=Ion Mihai Pacepa |title=Russian Footprints |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/218533/russian-footprints/ion-mihai-pacepa |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109232047/http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/218533/russian-footprints/ion-mihai-pacepa |archivedate=January 9, 2015 |deadurl=yes |journal=[[National Review]] |date=August 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23094">[[File:Carlos menem.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Carlos Menem]]'s administration carried out the privatisation process.]]
'''Railway privatisation in Argentina''' was a process which began in 1993 under the presidency of [[Carlos Menem]], following a series of [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic reforms. This primarily consisted of breaking-up the state-owned railway company [[Ferrocarriles Argentinos]] (FA) and allowing the former lines to be operated by private companies instead of the state. This policy was met with widespread criticism and proved catastrophic for the Argentine railways whose service worsened significantly in the years that followed, with entire lines closing and infrastructure deteriorating beyond repair.&lt;ref name=monografias&gt;[http://www.monografias.com/trabajos916/sistema-ferroviario-argentino/sistema-ferroviario-argentino2.shtml El servicio ferroviario argentino de las últimas dos décadas, el antes y después de las privatizaciones] - Monografias.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sabrinaramirez&gt;[https://sabrinaramirez.wordpress.com/2013/07/24/privatizacion-de-los-ferrocarriles-argentinos-ramal-que-para-ramal-que-cierra/ Privatización de los ferrocarriles: “Ramal que para, ramal que cierra”] - Contra Molinos de Sortilegios, 24 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ancaloo&gt;[http://www.ancaloo.com.ar/nota/3246/como-perdimos-el-ferrocarril-argentino COMO PERDIMOS EL FERROCARRIL ARGENTINO] - Ancaloo, 29 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Privatisation was ultimately reversed in 2015 with the creation of [[Nuevos Ferrocarriles Argentinos]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambito.com/noticia.asp?id=786700 "Senado convirtió en ley estatización de trenes"], ''Ambito Financiero'', 16 Apr 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cron&gt;[http://www.cronista.com/economiapolitica/Con-solo-dos-votos-en-contra-el-Senado-sanciono-la-ley-de-estatizacion-de-los-trenes-20150416-0053.html "Con sólo dos votos en contra, el Senado sancionó la ley de estatización de los trenes"], Cronista.com, 16 Apr 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Ferrocarriles Argentinos - Cruzada en Marcos Paz.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Domingo Sarmiento Railway|Sarmiento Railway]] rolling stock during the FA era.]]
Since railway nationalisation in 1948, during the presidency of [[Juan Perón]], the network had been operated by the state-owned company [[Ferrocarriles Argentinos]] (FA) which comprised the six relatively independent divisions, [[Domingo Sarmiento Railway|Sarmiento]], [[General Bartolomé Mitre Railway|Mitre]], [[General Urquiza Railway|Urquiza]], [[General San Martín Railway|San Martín]], [[General Belgrano Railway|Belgrano]] and [[General Roca Railway|Roca]].

By the time that President [[Carlos Menem]]'s administration took over the Government in 1989 FA had a serious economic deficit, with no investment projected and a high amount of social charges owed to the state. The amount of [[rail freight transport|freight]] services had considerably decreased between 1970 and 1990, going from 13,500 million of tons to 7,500 millions twenty years after (almost a 55%). The infrastructure and rolling stock were seriously deteriorated, with the exception of central network. Most part of locomotives and coaches had become obsolete therefore the costs of mainteanance had also increased. The aim was to reduce FA's deficit previous to a major restructuring of the company.

With the railway network's chronic deficit having risen to USD 355 million per year (about USD 1 million per day), the [[Congress of Argentina|National Congress]] adopted Law 23,696 (named "Ley de Reforma del Estado") that began the privatisation process in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131101235034/http://infoleg.mecon.gov.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/0-4999/98/texact.htm Ley 23.696 - Emergencia Administrativa. Privatizaciones y Participación del Capital Privado] on Infoleg, promulgated 18 Ago 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

The Law allowed president Menem to declare a state of emergency over any state-owned company with the objective to proceed to a privatisation or closure of that company. In November 1989, Menem pronounced his famous threat to any railworkers contemplating strike action: ''"Ramal que para, ramal que cierra"'' ("A line that goes on strike is a line that will be shut").&lt;ref&gt;[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/1997/05/25/i-01602e.htm "Ramal que cierra, pueblo que muere"], ''Clarín'', 25 May 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-243065-2014-03-31.html "De la resistencia a la recuperación"], ''Página/12'', 31 Mar 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Freight Services ==

[[File:G22U 4365 ALL.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[América Latina Logística]] worked on Urquiza and San Martín networks.]]

Although FA supported the idea of operating the freight line competing with private companies, the Ministry of Public Works (assisted by the World Bank) excluded FA from the activity, allowing only private concessionaires to operate the lines. In 1990 a program of restructuring was signed by FA, the Ministry and the World Bank. That agreement was the first official document to suggest the possibility to exclude FA from the opearation of public transport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTRAILWAYS/Resources/b35.pdf "Best Methods of Railway Restructuring and Privatization" by Ron Kopicki &amp; Louis S. Thompson], CFS Discussion Paper Series n° 111 - World Bank website&lt;/ref&gt;

The government granted concessions for a term of 30 years, extensible to 10 years else. It was also established that investments made by private operators became property of the state when the contract of concession finished. The concessionaire only kept the rolling stock or other goods acquired during the term of concession.

For freight transport, the government established zones of interest according to traffic. The first section was [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]]–[[Bahía Blanca]] with a traffic estimated in 2,000,000 tones carried by year along its 5,300-km length. The second section was the Urquiza Railway with 1,200,000 ton per year along 2,700-km length. The third section was Mitre Railway with 2,500,000 tons (also considering the possibility of passenger services) in its 4,800-km length. The San Martín Railway was included as the fourth section, with 4,700-km length

Most part of Roca Railway was granted in concession to [[Ferrosur Roca]], property of [[Loma Negra]], the largest cement producer of Argentina. The San Martín was granted to [[Buenos Aires al Pacífico S.A.]] while Sarmiento was granted to [[Ferroexpreso Pampeano]] (owned by [[Techint]]), Urquiza to Ferrocarril Mesopotámico and Mitre to [[Nuevo Central Argentino]].

Only the Belgrano Railway freight service remained under the control of the state due to lack of interest from private inversors. Nevertheless, the railway would be granted to [[Belgrano Cargas]] S.A., a consortium established by railway union "Unión Ferroviaria" in 1999. That same year, [[Brazil]]ian company [[América Latina Logística]] (ALL) took over the Urquiza and San Martín lines replacing Ferrocarril Mesopotámico and BAP respectively.

Freight services were granted in concession as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111223093724/http://www.cnrt.gov.ar/infoferro/espanol/data/historia_data.htm#priv "La concesión del sistema ferroviario de Cargas" - Historia de los Ferrocarriles Argentinos], CNRT website (Archive), 23 Dec 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1991 the government separated the urban passenger rail services and metro operating within the city of Buenos Aires from the rest of the rail network, and to this end created the holding company [[FEMESA|Ferrocarriles Metropolitanos S.A. (FEMESA)]] whilst the freight concessionaires were expected to make a profit, it was recognized that the operation of these services would require public subsidy. Concessions were granted to the bidder who would require the lowest subsidy. Four companies bid successfully for the seven lines originally operated by the six divisions of [[Ferrocarriles Argentinos]], together with the [[Buenos Aires Underground|Subte]], as shown below:

'''Notes:'''
* &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ''Took over by [[Trenes Argentinos Operadora Ferroviaria]] when contracts of concession were revoked or expired.''

The concessions were mainly for 10 years, with an optional 10-year extension, except for the Metro and the Línea Urquiza which were for an initial term of 20 years.  As in the case of the freight concessions, the government maintained ownership of the assets, whilst the concessionaires undertook to operate their services as described in their original bid. Maximum fares were set by the government but were subject to automatic increases according to service quality and the prevailing rate of inflation. Financial penalties would be levied if agreed levels of service were not achieved.

[[Trenes de Buenos Aires]] operated the [[Mitre Line|Mitre]] and [[Sarmiento Line|Sarmiento]] lines until concession was revoked after the [[2012 Buenos Aires rail disaster|Once rail disaster]] on February 22, 2012, at [[Once Station]], [[Buenos Aires]], in which 51 people died and at least 703 people were injured,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Argentina train crash in Buenos Aires kills dozens|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-17129858|work=BBC News|accessdate=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; TBA was placed under [[federal intervention]] on February 28; its concessions to operate the Mitre and Sarmiento lines were ultimately revoked on May 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/politica/Finalmente-Gobierno-concesion-Sarmiento-TBA_0_706129566.html|title=Finalmente, el Gobierno le sacó las concesiones del Sarmiento y del Mitre a TBA|work=Clarín}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the cancellation of the contact, both lines were taken over by transitional consortium [[Unidad de Gestión Operativa Mitre Sarmiento]] (UGOMS).

When [[UGOFE]] and [[UGOMS]] were dissolved, Corredores Ferroviarios (a company part of Grupo Roggio, which also owns [[Metrovías]], a company that operates the [[Buenos Aires Subte]] and Urquiza line since 1994) and Argentren took over the Mitre / San Martín and Belgrano Sur / Roca lines, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/politica/Roggio-Emepa-repartiran-manejo-ferrocarriles_0_1030697016.html Roggio y EMEPA se repartirán el manejo de cuatro ferrocarriles] clarin.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/economia/2-260643-2014-11-26.html Trenes cero kilómetro después de cincuenta años/ Cambios Recientes] pagina12.com.ar&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1663435-el-gobierno-vuelve-a-privatizar-la-operacion-de-los-trenes-mitre-san-martin-belgrano-sur-y-r "Trenes: le dan a Roggio el Mitre y el San Martín y a Emepa, el Roca y el Belgrano Sur", ''La Nación'', 12 Feb 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/politica/privadas-volveran-operar-mayoria-ferroviarias_0_1083491853.html "Las privadas volverán a operar la mayoría de las líneas ferroviarias", ''Clarín, 12 Feb 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telam.com.ar/notas/201402/51395-el-gobierno-establecio-un-nuevo-regimen-de-operaciones-de-las-lineas-ferroviarias.html "El Gobierno estableció un nuevo régimen de operaciones de las líneas ferroviarias", Telam, 12 Feb 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/economia/2-239655-2014-02-12.html "De a uno por línea, para mejor control", ''Página 12'', 12 Feb 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enelsubte.com/noticias/metrovias-operara-las-lineas-mitre-y-san-martin-3053 "Metrovías operará las líneas Mitre y San Martín", ''En el Subte'', 12 Feb 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; The company operated both lines until the government rescinded the agreement with the company in March 2015.&lt;ref name=ley&gt;[http://www.ieco.clarin.com/economia/Nueva-ley-trenes-esta-lista_0_1315068533.html "Ya está lista la ley que prevé más control estatal sobre los trenes"], ''Clarín'', 5 Mar 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ambito.com"&gt;[http://www.ambito.com/noticia.asp?id=780856 "Estado rescindió contrato de trenes a privados y avisó que no pagará indemnizaciones"], ''Ambito Financiero'', 2 Mar 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="railwaygazette.com"&gt;[http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/buenos-aires-commuter-routes-renationalised.html "Buenos Aires commuter routes renationalised"], ''Railway Gazette'', 3 Mar 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="boletinoficial.gov.ar"&gt;[http://www.boletinoficial.gov.ar/Avisos/VerPDF.castle?f=20150302&amp;s=01&amp;pd=9&amp;ph=0&amp;sup=False Resolution N° 171/2015 - Official Bulletin of Argentina]&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from Corredores Ferroviarios, other private company, [[Argentren]] S.A., was granted concession to operate the [[Roca Line (Buenos Aires)|Roca]] and [[Belgrano Sur Line (Buenos Aires)|Belgrano Sur]] lines.&lt;ref name="ambito.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="railwaygazette.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boletinoficial.gov.ar"/&gt; The contract was also revoked by the government in March 2015.&lt;ref name=ley/&gt;

=== Other rail services ===
On 20 May 1992 the government announced that all [[inter-city rail|inter-city]] passenger services, other than Buenos Aires to [[Mar del Plata]], would be discontinued on January 1, 1993, unless provincial authorities either agreed to assume responsibility for them or selected a private concessionaire to operate them on their behalf.

Provincial governments that took over the services to avoid closures were: 
* [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], establishing state-owned company [[Ferrobaires]] (1993 to present days)
* [[Chaco Province]] operated trains through state-owned [[Servicios Ferroviarios del Chaco]] (1999-2010)
* [[Tucumán Province|Tucumán]] also operated a railway service to [[Buenos Aires]] to keep the line active. Services started in 1992 but ceased in 1997. 
* [[Río Negro Province|Río Negro]] created its own company, named "[[Servicios Ferroviarios Patagónico|Tren Patagónico]]" to operate trains from [[Viedma]] to [[San Carlos de Bariloche|Bariloche]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minutouno.com/notas/319649-avanza-la-reactivacion-del-tren-patagonico "Avanza la reactivación del Tren Patagónico"], Minuto Uno, 16 Apr 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  that had been under concession since 1993.

On the other hand, ''[[La Trochita]]'' was never privatised and closed in 1992 due to the lack of interest of private investors. Nevertheless, the line would be later reopened, being currently operated by Governments of [[Río Negro Province|Río Negro]] and [[Chubut Province|Chubut]] provinces together.

Long-distance and tourist services granted to private companies are listed below:

Dr '''Ron Brunton''' is an [[Australia]]n [[Anthropology|anthropologist]]. He is the Director of Encompass Research Pty Ltd and was a Director of the Board of the [[Public broadcasting|public broadcaster]], the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] for a five-year term from 1 May 2003.

==Biography==
Prior to his appointment to the ABC Board, Brunton was a fortnightly columnist for ''[[The Courier-Mail]]'' from 1997–2003; a Senior Fellow at the [[Institute of Public Affairs]], a [[right wing]] [[think tank]] from 1995–2001, and a contributor to the [[Conservatism|conservative]] literary and political journal ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]]''.

In his articles, Brunton was highly critical of the ''[[Bringing Them Home]]'' report on the stolen generations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hal Wootten|Wootten, Hal]] (1998) [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/ILB/1998/44.html 'Ron Brunton and Bringing Them Home', the Report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission into the removal of Aboriginal children from ... ]''[[Indigenous Law Bulletin]]'' 44; 4(12): 12-12]&lt;/ref&gt; He has also written scathing criticisms of both the [[Australian High Court|High Court]]'s 1992 ''[[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)|Mabo v Queensland]]'' decision and the [[Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody]]. In addition, he enunciated the view that the "secret women's business" of the [[Ngarrindjeri]] women during the [[Hindmarsh Island bridge controversy]] was a fabrication, and came to the defence of the murdered [[Netherlands|Dutch]] politician [[Pim Fortuyn]] who called on [[Muslim]] immigrants to [[Cultural assimilation|assimilate]] into Dutch society and culture. Prior to his appointment to the Board he was a harsh critic of the ABC itself, accusing it of being part of the "left establishment" and of being a "sucker" for "brainless comment".

Brunton's appointment to the ABC Board by the [[Australian Government]] of [[John Howard]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anthropologist gets nod for ABC board|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|work=ABC News|date=2 May 2003|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2003/05/02/845928.htm|accessdate=11 May 2008|location=Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt; created controversy with left-wing ABC supporters given his conservative views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=The usual suspects - Dr Ron Brunton appointed to the ABC Board|publisher=Friends of the ABC|date=2 May 2003|url=http://friendsoftheabc.org/suspects.htm|accessdate=3 December 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614204640/http://friendsoftheabc.org/suspects.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=14 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Encompass Research Pty Ltd is an organisation engaged in anthropological and [[socio-economic]] [[research]], concentrating on [[native title]], [[Australian Aboriginal culture|indigenous heritage]], [[immigration]] and [[Natural environment|environmental]] issues.

Brunton has published a range of research papers and books on anthropological issues and has lectured in anthropology at universities in Australia and at the [[University of Papua New Guinea]]. He has also stood as an [[expert witness]] in a number of [[native title]] court cases across Australia, having been engaged by parties involved in native title [[litigation]].

===Education===
He completed his Ph.D. at [[La Trobe University]] with a thesis on [[kava]] use in [[Melanesia]].&lt;ref name=kava&gt;{{Citation | author1=Brunton, Ron (Ronald) | title=The abandoned narcotic : kava and cultural instability in Melanesia | publication-date=1989 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=978-0-521-37375-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had in 1973 completed a M.A. with a thesis titled ''Social stratification, trade and ceremonial exchange in Melanesia'' at the [[University of Sydney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Brunton, Ron (Ronald) | title=Social stratification, trade and ceremonial exchange in Melanesia | publication-date=1973 | publisher=[s.n.] | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/22023886 | accessdate=5 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Ryōichi Sasakawa'''|笹川 良一|Sasakawa Ryōichi|May 4, 1899 &amp;ndash; July 18, 1995}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] businessman, politician, and philanthropist. He was born in [[Minoh, Osaka]]. In the 1930s and during the [[Second World War]] he was active both in finance and in politics, actively supporting the Japanese war effort including raising his own paramilitary units.  He was elected to the [[Japanese parliament]] during the war. After Japan's defeat he was imprisoned for a time as a suspected war criminal, and then found financial success in various business ventures including [[Kyōtei|motorboat racing]] and ship building.  He supported anticommunist activities, including the [[World League for Freedom and Democracy|World Anti-Communist League]]. In 1951 he helped found the [[Nippon Foundation]] and became its first president. The foundation has done charitable work around the world, for which it and Sasakawa have received many official honors.

== Prewar activity ==
In the 1930s, during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]], Sasakawa rose to prominence by using wealth gained in rice speculation&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sato|2006|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; to build a voluntary flying squad within Japan for the purpose of providing trained pilots in case of a national emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sato|2006|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also built an air defense field, donating it to the army. Once Japan began to coordinate its air power in 1941, Sasakawa dissolved his voluntary flying group and gave all of its facilities and aircraft to the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sato|2006|pp=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he used the various mining interests that he had accumulated to support the army in a more concrete fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sato|2006|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sasaka was more interested in supporting the war effort than making a profit, with one biographer noting that "his family records show ... that his mining ventures were not as profitable in wartime as they could have been".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sato|2006|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A Japanese Tragedy 1946 film (12) wmplayer 2013-04-09 19-27-49-090 R.jpg|thumb|Yoshio Kodama]]
In addition, the 1930s saw Sasakawa take the helm of the Kokusui Taishu-to, or Patriotic People's Party (PPP).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sato|2006|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This small organization was one of the many right-wing groups that sprang up in Japan in the lead-up to World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sato|2006|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in this connection that he first met [[Yoshio Kodama]], who was at that time a member.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sato|2006|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, Sasakawa and twelve other leading members of the PPP were arrested and held for three years on suspicion of having ordered the blackmail of several leading companies, such as Takashimaya, the Hankyu Railway, and Tokyo Life Insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sato|2006|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he was eventually acquitted, the jail time and the subsequent appeals process took a total of 6&amp;nbsp;years, leading up the opening year of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sato|2006|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, the prosecution itself revealed that the charges against him had been based more on perception of the PPP as "dangerous", than on actual evidence of blackmail.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sato|2006|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sasakawa's trials ended in August 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sato|2006|p=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December that year, World War II broke out [[Pacific War|in the Pacific]], and in April 1942, Sasakawa won a seat in the Japanese Diet, taking one of only 85 out of 466 seats that were captured by non-government-backed candidates.&lt;ref name="harvp|Sato|2006|p=50"&gt;{{harvp|Sato|2006|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason that such candidates were so few was that it was wartime, and those in power were doing all they could to control policy while maintaining a mask of parliamentary democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sato|2006|pp=50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sasakawa joined the Diet nearly a half year after the war began, as a member of the "opposition".

In the Diet, he stood against the government's suppression of the freedom of speech and its pressure for the conformity of all parliamentarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sato|2006|pp=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his efforts in this vein were largely unsuccessful, and he spent much of the war outside of the Diet, touring Manchuria and China, visiting prisons around the country, and cheering those on the home front.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sato|2006|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; He advocated war extension. During the war he flew a squadron bomber to Rome and met Mussolini.&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric, Louis; Encyclopaedia of Asian Civilisations; Paris 1984, Vol. VIII, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sugamo prison ==
[[File:Sugamo Prison2.JPG|thumb|Sugamo prison]]
At the end of the war, Sasakawa entered the occupation-run Sugamo prison. While until a short time before his arrest, there was little possibility of his detainment, much less as a Class A war crimes suspect,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sato|2006|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; from October to November, 1945, he launched a campaign of twenty or so speeches in Osaka, decrying victor's justice and demanding to be taken as a prisoner so that he could help defend Japan in the Tokyo war crimes trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sato|2006|p=76–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was "motivated by a desire to speak out in defense of the emperor and in the interests of Japan at the Tokyo Trials".&lt;ref name="harvp|Sato|2006|p=50"/&gt;

The US summary for his arrest, dated December 4, 1945 reads as follows:
{{quote|Sasakawa should be arrested for the following reasons: first, for leading campaigns instigating aggression, nationalism and hostility against the United States. And second, for his continued vigorous activities in an organization that strongly impedes the development of democracy in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Awaya Kentaro and Yoshida Yutaka, eds., Vol. 24, Kokusai Kensatsukyoku (IPS) Jinmon Chosho [Official records of interrogations by examining prosecutors] (Tokyo: Nihon Tosho Center, 1993, 126., quoting Civil Intelligence Section (CIS) records, Minkan Joho Koku, December 4, 1945.)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While in prison, Sasakawa was able to establish connections with many of the men who had led Japan during the war, and who would go on to reassume these roles after their release. He also came into further contact with [[Yoshio Kodama]], though the exact nature of their prison relationship does not seem to have been as positive as it had been when they were both members of the PPP. (In prison, Kodama pursued a policy of collaborating with his captors, naming names and making questionable statements that put other prisoners at a disadvantage. As part of this policy, he asked that his testimony about Sasakawa be kept secret, and it would appear that Sasakawa never found out about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sato|2006|pp=97–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

== Postwar activity ==
On December 23, 1948, [[Hideki Tōjō]] and six other Class A war criminals were hanged. The next day, all Class A suspects who had not been indicted were released (aside from the seven who were executed, eighteen were given very long or life sentences.) Sasakawa and Kodama were among those who were released. There is much speculation surrounding Sasakawa's release. While some suggest that there was simply not enough evidence to indict him of Class A war crimes,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sato|2006|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; others believe it was due to a lack of resources available to carry out trials of all suspected war criminals.&lt;ref name="Postel-Vinay"&gt;{{Citation

Sasakawa became deeply involved in the [[occupied Japan|post-war reconstruction]]; though he never again entered politics, he used his considerable influence to bolster business and political parties. The most effective of his post-war activities was the creation of a gambling industry that is still in existence today. Along with his friends [[Syngman Rhee]], the Korean dictator, and [[Chiang Kai-shek]], the Chinese nationalist leader, he founded the [[World League for Freedom and Democracy|World Anti-Communist League]]. Among other coups, the league claims to have played a part in the 1966 overthrow of Indonesia's President [[Sukarno]]. Sasakawa stated once: "I am the world's richest fascist."&lt;ref name="GlobalResearch"&gt;[http://www.globalresearch.ca/drugs-guns-and-nukes-iran-as-the-new-dope-incorporated/29839 Drugs, Guns and Nukes: Iran as the New 'Dope, Incorporated'] - Global Research, 18 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TIME"&gt;{{Citation

In 1951 &amp;ndash; after extensive bribery of parliamenticians on his behalf&lt;ref name="FA" /&gt; &amp;ndash; the [[Japanese Diet]] passed the Motorboat Racing Law – an invention of Sasakawa's. Under this law, [[Kyōtei|motorboat races]] are held at 24 locations around the nation for the purpose of both bolstering the local economies and providing the revenue needed to support 1) the reconstruction of Japan's maritime industry, and 2) welfare projects around the country. In later years, international projects were also added. The law established that the distribution of the monies to support projects was to be performed by the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation, a body that eventually came to be known as the [[Nippon Foundation]].&lt;ref name="NFWHist"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nippon-foundation.or.jp/en/who/about/history/01.html | title=Foundation History | publisher=The Nippon Foundation | accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sasakawa became the foundation's chairman.&lt;ref name="NFWHist"/&gt; Public and governmental focus on the issue drove Sasakawa to take pains to make the system as clear as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sato|2006|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kyōtei]], a form of boat racing, is one of the sports for which [[Gambling in Japan|gambling]] is officially allowed in Japan, established as a means to help with restoring the nation's shipbuilding industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Nippon Foundation's Resources |url=http://www.nippon-foundation.or.jp/eng/who/resources.html |accessdate=December 5, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103101106/http://www.nippon-foundation.or.jp/eng/who/resources.html |archivedate=January 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was largely responsible for Japan's meteoric rise to become one of the world's maritime leaders by the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sato|2006|pp=175–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system is regulated by the department of transport, and many of the foundations Sasakawa later created through grants by The Nippon Foundation were led by previous employees of the department of transport. The system of farming out former government employees to businesses and foundations has long been common, legal practice in Japan, though one that Sasakawa himself viewed with suspicion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sato|2006|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Sasakawa's leadership, The Nippon Foundation made charitable contributions both in Japan and around the world, working with the United Nations on maritime law&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/depts/los/nippon/ The Nippon Foundation of Japan Fellowship Programme: Human Resources Development and Advancement of the Legal Order of the World's Oceans] - United Nations, retrieved 28 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and with the World Health Organization, donating over $70m to fight leprosy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/lep/partners/tnf/en/ Partners: The Nippon Foundation] - World Health Organization, retrieved 28 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The government body awards investment licensing online and reports to the president of the [[Supreme Economic Council of Saudi Arabia|Supreme Economic Council]]. SAGIA’s headquarters are located in [[Riyadh]], with three other business centers located in Saudi Arabia: [[Medina]], [[Dammam]] and [[Jeddah]]. In order to facilitate investment, a larger network of business centers has been announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.aimcongress.com/en/sponsors-2015/invest-saudi/ |title=Invest Saudi| publisher= UAE Ministry of Economy| access-date=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prior to 2000, Saudi Arabia had failed to attract significant foreign investments in its telecommunications, transportation, and power industries despite being the largest market in the Gulf. Foreign investors were deterred by several factors including incomplete economic data, restrictive visa policies for workers, and an extremely conservative cultural environment.&lt;ref name="innovation governance"&gt;Khalid Al-Yahya, [https://www.innovations.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/16616.pdf First Arab Regional Forum on Innovations in Governance], ''Harvard.edu'', November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2016, the SAGIA holds a central position in the deployment of Saudi Arabia's [[Saudi Vision 2030|Vision 2030]].&lt;ref name="beyond oil"&gt;[https://www.wko.at/service/aussenwirtschaft/SAGIA.pdf Saudi Arabia Beyond Oil], ''Wko.at'', 13 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation===
Intending to liberalize the nation's trade and investment programs, diversify the economy, and join the [[World Trade Organization]], the Saudi Arabian Council of Ministers initiated the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA) in April 2000. Under the Council of Ministers Resolution No. 2 dated April 9, 2000, the Authority was created as a vehicle for investment in Saudi Arabia, with the purpose of sustaining economic growth and addressing investment affairs nationwide, including foreign investment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sagia.gov.sa/en/InvestmentIncentivesandRegulations/LawsAndRegulations/SubCategory_Library/Implementing%20Regulations%20of%20the%20Foreign%20Investment%20Act.pdf  The Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority Board Resolution No. (2/74)], ''Sagia.gov.sa''&lt;/ref&gt;

===10 x 10 program===
The objective of SAGIA’s “10 x 10” program, which ran from  2005 to 2010, was to place [[Saudi Arabia]] among the world’s top ten competitive investment destinations by 2010. SAGIA created the National Competitiveness Center (NCC) to compare the performance of Saudi Arabia’s investment opportunities to more than 300 indicators of global competitiveness, assessed in such publications as the [[World Bank]]’s ''Doing Business'' report, the [[World Economic Forum]]’s ''[[Global Competitiveness Report]]'', and the [[International Institute for Management Development|IMD]]’s ''World Competitiveness Yearbook''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sagia.gov.sa/english/index.php?page=ncc/ NCC (National Competitveness Center)Overview ]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the World Bank ''Doing Business'' report, Saudi Arabia rose from number 67 in 2005 to number 16 in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Business Group, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gMPjxHzG1xQC&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;ots=oDR3afIOrT&amp;dq=sagia%2010x10%20program&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q=sagia%2010x10%20program&amp;f=false On top of the world], ''The Report: Saudi Arabia'' on ''Books.google.com'', 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic Cities program===
Launched in 2006, the Economic Cities program was designed to drive toward greater competitiveness, [[job creation]], and economic diversification.

In developing economic cities, over a thousand of the world’s [[free economic zone|free zones]] were surveyed. The sixty deemed most successful were studied to determine key success factors. The objectives of the Economic Cities were to promote regional development, achieve economic diversification, create jobs, and enhance competitiveness in Saudi Arabia. Four new cities were identified and thus developed: [[King Abdullah Economic City]], [[Jazan Economic City]], [[Prince Abdulaziz Bin Mousaed Economic City]], and the [[Knowledge Economic City, Medina]].

===Foreign ownership===
In October 2011, [[Pfizer]] signed an agreement with SAGIA to set up its first manufacturing plant in King Abdullah Economic City. In June 2016, SAGIA gave Pfizer 100% foreign ownership of its legal entity in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sagia.gov.sa/en/PartnerofSuccess/Pages/Pfizer.aspx Success stories: Pfizer], ''Sagia.gov.sa''&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, SAGIA announced allowing 100 percent foreign ownership in the engineering business, after consultations.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Kane,

==Activities==
The SAGIA is responsible for three main functions: making improvements to increase the Kingdom's competitiveness as an investment destination; building upon the quality of service and value proposition offered to investors; and offering new investment opportunities to attract businesses and investors alike, to help advance Saudi Arabia's economic diversification agenda.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.weforum.org/organizations/saudi-arabian-general-investment-authority-sagia  Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA)], ''Weforum.com''&lt;/ref&gt; Since its creation in 2000, SAGIA also addresses internal obstacles such as [[Women's rights in Saudi Arabia|women's rights]] in the workplace to tackle issues related to the investment climate.&lt;ref name="innovation governance"/&gt;

SAGIA acts as provider of all investment-related services in the Kingdom: Advisory services, business match-making, liaison and coordination across government departments, instant online licenses.&lt;ref name="beyond oil"/&gt; In 2009 the Kingdom was listed as 8th largest in the worldwide ranking of [[Foreign Direct Investment]] (FDI) recipients.&lt;ref&gt;Omar G. Aziz, [http://researchdirect.uws.edu.au/islandora/object/uws%3A36430/datastream/PDF/view Foreign Direct Investment in Arab Economies], ''Uws.edu.au'', 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The SAGIA organizes the Global Competitiveness Forum is an annual program of activities held in [[Riyadh]], [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gcf.org.sa/en/TheEvent/About/Pages/default.aspx About GCF]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==
The Authority’s board of directors comprises 14 directors from the Saudi private and public sectors. Prince [[Saud Bin Khalid Al-Faisal]] has been deputy governor of SAGIA since December 2010. Governors of SAGIA served four-year terms, as follows:

The '''Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship''' provides platforms at the country, regional and global levels to promote [[social entrepreneur]]ship. The Foundation is a [[Non-profit|not-for-profit]] organization, founded in 1998. Its purpose is to "advance social entrepreneurship and to foster social entrepreneurs as an important catalyst for societal innovation and progress."&lt;ref name = Schwab-about&gt;Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship [http://www.schwabfound.org/content/about-us "About us."] Retrieved: 2013-08-06.&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation is under the legal supervision of the [[Federal administration of Switzerland|Swiss Federal Government]]. Its headquarters are in [[Geneva, Switzerland]]. Each year the Foundation selects 20-25 Social Entrepreneurs through a global “ Social Entrepreneur of the Year” competition. 

== History ==
[[file:Hilde Schwab at the WEF Social Entrepreneurs Wrap-up.jpg|thumb|Hilde Schwab at the WEF Social Entrepreneurs Wrap-up in 2018]]

==Biography==
Born in [[Medan]], [[North Sumatra]] province, on [[Christmas Day]] 1949, Tanoto is the oldest of seven boys.&lt;ref name="teo"/&gt; His father was an immigrant from [[Putian]] city in [[China]]'s [[Fujian]] province. In 1966, Tanoto's education was abruptly interrupted after Chinese schools were shut down by then-President [[Suharto]]'s [[New Order (Indonesia)|new regime]]. He was prohibited from attending national schools due to his parents' Chinese citizenship.&lt;ref name="teo"/&gt;

When his father suffered a stroke, Tanoto was left to run the family business. He gradually moved beyond basic trading to winning contracts in building gas pipelines for multinationals. During the 1972 oil crisis that increased prices dramatically, Tanoto took advantage of clients rapidly expanding their operations. With this injection of capital, Tanoto turned his attention to another business in 1973, noticing that Indonesia exported raw logs for conversion into plywood in countries like Japan or Taiwan, before importing the finished plywood back to Indonesia at great cost.&lt;ref name="teo"/&gt;

Tanoto recognized an opportunity to develop his own plywood mill in Indonesia. However, he required a permit to do so. Under the Suharto regime, permits were sought from politicians who often served as [[Armed Forces of Indonesia|army]] generals. Tanoto was forced to work with a general who gave his blessing and was quickly convinced of the mill's potential after seeing the completed factory, with Tanoto citing the potential value-add to Indonesia's economy and the creation of new jobs. The plant began operations in 1975 after being inaugurated by Suharto.&lt;ref name="teo"/&gt; Slowly, from the plywood business, his company branched out into palm oil as well as pulp and paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/14/hard-work-the-key-for-the-family-behind-singapore-based-resources-giant-rge.html|title=CNBC Lasting Legacy: Hard work the key for the family behind Singapore-based resources giant RGE|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tanoto is a self-educated entrepreneur but regretted his interrupted education. He learned English word-for-word using a Chinese-English dictionary and finally attended business school in Jakarta in the mid-1970s. He also undertook further studies at INSEAD in Fontainebleau, France.&lt;ref name="teo"/&gt;

In 1997, Tanoto elected to settle in [[Singapore]] with his family, establishing his company's headquarters there.&lt;ref name="FortuneIndonesia"/&gt;

Three of his children are active within RGE and its businesses. His son, [[Anderson Tanoto|Anderson,]] is an RGE director.&lt;ref name="Scion"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-indonesian-scion-grapples-with-his-familys-past-1445903371|title=An Indonesian Scion Grapples with His Family's Past|journal=Wall Street Journal|date=2015-10-26|last1=Fong|first1=Dominique}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Higher Interest Rates Lower Expectations in Emerging Economies"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/22/business/international/indonesia-economy-interest-rates.html?_r=0|title=Higher Interest Rates Lower Expectations in Emerging Economies|journal=The New York Times|date=2015-12-21|access-date=|last1=Gough|first1=Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt; His eldest daughter Imelda is a member of the RGE executive committee&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whartonmagazine.com/issues/fall-winter-2017/the-business-family-imelda-tanoto-belinda-tanoto-anderson-tanoto/#sthash.BSUZiiH7.dpbs|title=Wharton Magazine - The Business Family: Imelda Tanoto W04 &amp; Belinda Tanoto C06 W06 &amp; Anderson Tanoto W11|last=|first=|date=2017-10-12|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while his younger daughter [[Belinda Tanoto|Belinda]] dedicates most of her time to the family's philanthropic arm, [[Tanoto Foundation]].

==Business activities==

Tanoto's business interests are represented by [[Royal Golden Eagle|the Royal Golden Eagle (RGE)]], a global resource-based group of companies with manufacturing operations in Indonesia, China, Brazil, Canada and Europe, and sales offices worldwide. Since Sukanto Tanoto started his entrepreneurial journey in 1967, the business has grown considerably, with a workforce of over 60,000 people and its assets exceeding US$18 billion.&lt;ref name="scmp.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/presented/news/hong-kong/education/topics/hkust-biz-school-magazine/article/2115113/outward-looking|title=South China Morning Post: The Outward-looking Family Philanthropy|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013025434/http://www.scmp.com/presented/news/hong-kong/education/topics/hkust-biz-school-magazine/article/2115113/outward-looking|archive-date=2017-10-13|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The business has five key operational areas: pulp and paper ([[Asia Pacific Resources International Holdings]] or APRIL, Asia Symbol), agro-industry ([[Asian Agri]]), specialty cellulose ([[Bracell Limited]]) and viscose fibre ([[Sateri]]) and energy resources development [http://www.po-and-g.com/ (Pacific Oil &amp; Gas)]. APRIL has been involved in conservation controversies related to the use of native Sumatran growth forests,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/content/2011/s3283804.htm|title=Paper/Tiger|last=|first=|date=|work=|publisher=ABC Foreign Correspondent|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to the company withdrawing from the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] in April 2010. In September 2011, [[Fuji Xerox]] ceased selling paper manufactured by APRIL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher=Fuji Xerox | title=Fuji Xerox ceases procurement from Asia Pacific Resources International Limited (APRIL)| url=http://www.fujixerox.com/eng/company/ecology/topics/2011/0901_april.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has denied the claims, stating it has a commitment to implement practices that mitigate climate change and promote sustainability.&lt;ref name="business2"&gt;{{cite web|date=November 2011|title=APRIL's commitment to being part  of the "sustainability solution"| url=http://www.aprilasia.com/images/pdfs/APRIL%27s%20commitment%20to%20being%20part%20of%20the%20sustainability%20solution%20-%20by%20AJ%20Devanesan,%20COO%20APRIL.pdf|publisher=|language=|last=Devanesan|first=A.J.|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in June 2015, APRIL pledged to eliminate deforestation from its entire supply chain.

== Philanthropic activities ==
Tanoto and his wife, Tinah Bingei Tanoto, began their philanthropic work in 1981 in Indonesia with the opening of a kindergarten in Besitang.&lt;ref name="scmp.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Commitment To A Cause: The Continuing Evolution Of The Tanoto Foundation |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tanotofoundation/2018/11/06/commitment-to-a-cause-the-continuing-evolution-of-the-tanoto-foundation/ |website=Forbes |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They formally established the [[Tanoto Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tanotofoundation.org/sukanto-tanoto|title=Tanoto Foundation Founder: Sukanto Tanoto|last=|first=|date=2015-09-08|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2001. Its numerous educational initiatives have included the funding of teacher training and the provision of over 700 scholarships a year. The Foundation also delivers basic amenities such as clean water and sanitation, as well as healthcare. Through the provision of access to productive assets, startup capital, technical skills and links to markets, it helps to empower families and deliver sustainable livelihood.&lt;ref name="scmp.com"/&gt;

Tanoto recognized the importance of establishing strong [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) programs in the [[Riau]] province.&lt;ref name="teo" /&gt; Through [[Riau Andalan Pulp &amp; Paper]] (RAPP), Tanoto built schools and established farming systems that teach villagers an alternative cultivation to [[slash-and-burn]] techniques, as well making regular sustainability reports to [[NGO]]s, such as the [[World Wildlife Fund]] after the organization expressed concerns over the conservation of forests in Riau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher=The Jakarta Post| title=Pulp mills put heavy pressure on forests: Study | url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/yesterdaydetail.asp?fileid=20020209.J04 |date=2002-02-09 |accessdate=2007-10-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071117043333/http://www.thejakartapost.com/yesterdaydetail.asp?fileid=20020209.J04 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reach of Tanoto Foundation's activities now extends to China, Hong Kong and Singapore and the US. It has provided more than 20,000 scholarships, built several schools and educational facilities that produced 27,000 graduates, developed 60,000 hectares of community livelihood plantations and created more than 1,800 jobs in local communities through Small-and-Medium-size Enterprise (SME) programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ust.hk/about-hkust/media-relations/press-releases/bizinsighthkust-forum-examines-future-chinese-family-businesses/#|title=BizInsight@HKUST Forum  Examines the Future of Chinese Family Businesses|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{chinese name|Tang (董)}}
'''Tang Choon Keng''' ({{zh|s=董俊竞|p=Dǒng Jùnjìng}}; 12 September 1901 – 3 September 2000) was a [[Singapore]]an entrepreneur, who founded [[Tangs]] [[department store]] in Singapore. He was popularly known as '''CK Tang'''. Tang has been credited for leading the way for the retail market in Singapore and establishing [[Orchard Road]] as a premier retail district in Singapore.

==Early life==
A [[Teochew people|Teochew]], Tang was born at the turn of the 20th century in [[Shantou]], China to a [[Presbyterian]] pastor. He [[emigrate]]d to the [[British colony]] of Singapore in 1923.

In Singapore, Tang began as a [[door-to-door]] salesman peddling hand-made Swatow [[lace]], [[embroidery]] and [[linen]] products. With a [[Renting|hire]]d [[Pulled rickshaw|rickshaw]], Tang carried his goods in a pair of [[tin]] [[Trunk (luggage)|trunk]]s which remained in his possession as a reminder of his humble beginnings. Tang later became known as the "Tin Trunk Man" and the "Curio King" for his [[rags to riches]] legacy.

==Establishment of Tangs==
[[File:Tangs department store, Singapore, photographed February 1969 × July 1971.jpg|thumb|Tangs department store, Singapore, photographed February 1969 × July 1971]]
In 1932, Tang was able to embark on a larger venture, having accumulated sufficient funds through hard work. He established a department store in 1932 with an initial [[Capital (economics)|capital]] of [[Straits dollar|S$]]3,000. Tang set up his first shop on the first floor of a building on [[River Valley Road]], selling [[craft]] products from China.

Subsequently in 1940, Tang financed the construction of a new building at the corner of [[Mohamed Sultan Road|Jalan Mohamed Sultan]] and River Valley Road to house a new department store. He called the new [[edifice]] ''Gainurn Building'', a variation of his father's name Tang Gan Urn. The department store sold a vast array of [[merchandise]]. By the 1950s, CK Tang had opened several more branches.

In 1958, Tang bought a 1,351-square metre piece of land at the corner of Orchard Road and [[Scotts Road]] at a cost of [[S$]]10,000 to further his vision of expanding his business. Although the site faced the Tai San Ting Cemetery, he felt that it had commercial value as many British housewives in the [[Tanglin]] area could stop by on their way to the [[Downtown Core|city]]. The decision was made against the advice of fellow businessmen who thought Orchard Road was unfashionable then. Years later, when the [[Singapore Government]] designated and developed Orchard Road as a prime shopping and tourist district, the price of land soared from S$3 per m² to S$6,000 per m².

With the acquired land plot, Tang constructed the landmark [[C.K. Tang Department Store]] (now rebranded as Tangs) at 310 Orchard Road at a cost of S$50,000. The building's green-[[tile]]d roof and facade was modelled after the [[Imperial Palace of the Forbidden City]] in Beijing. In 1960, Tang voluntarily closed the store due to problems with the trade unions, but Tangs was re-opened the following year. In 1975, Tang's company was [[Public company|publicly listed]]. 

[[File:Marriott Hotel 2, Singapore, Dec 05.JPG|thumb|[[Mariott Hotel (Singapore)|Marriott Hotel, Singapore]] (formerly the [[Dynasty Hotel]]) and Tang Plaza were built in 1982 to expand Tang Choon Keng's business on [[Orchard Road]].]]
In the late 1970s, Tang expanded his business again when he decided to develop the neighbouring [[property]] lots which he had bought years before. In 1982, the building on Orchard Road was [[demolish]]ed to make way for the new Tang complex, comprising the 33-storey deluxe [[Dynasty Hotel]] (now the [[Singapore Marriott Hotel]]) and the Tangs shopping complex (now Tang Plaza). The shopping complex consists of five floors of retail space covering more than 15,000 m², [[Marketing|marketed]] under the [[slogan]] "All The Best Under One Roof".

In 1991, Tangs opened its first overseas branch in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia. Tang also collaborated with Malaysia's Mayang Sari Bhd to develop real estate, hotels and commercial properties in Kuala Lumpur. He also assisted the [[Dairy Farm International Holdings]] in its retail business in Malaysia.

Until 1996, Tangs was the only major shopping centre in Singapore to not operate on Sundays, in deference to Tang's Christian faith. Tang instituted the policy so that his family and Christian staff could attend [[Church service|church]] on Sundays. As a staunch Christian, Tang spoke of [[honesty]] and hard work as his guiding [[principle]]s.

Tang's distinctive management philosophy was the focus on people, both customers and staff. Emphasis was given to quality of the staff, reasonable [[pricing]] and warm [[Customer service|service]]. Tang believed in [[invest]]ing in his staff, as his frontline staff would be the ones who would be in direct contact with the customers and he believed that the [[Reputation|image]] of the store depended on them. As a result, Tang reserved a substantial annual [[budget]] for staff [[training]], which included tailored programs for sales staff, [[supervisor]]s and management. Supervisors and [[Management|managers]] were expected to undergo a minimum 100 hours of training. Tang also made an effort to get in touch with his staff at all levels, in order understand his customers' expectations on product and service quality. Despite the company's poor financial results in certain years, Tangs retained its reputation for good service and reliability.

Tang retired in 1987, handing the reins of [[corporate]] leadership to the second of his three sons, [[Tang Wee Sung]]. Tang retained the post of company president and was rarely out of touch with company business, personally checking the company's [[account (accountancy)|accounts]] and meeting suppliers.

== Personal life ==
Besides CK Tang, Tang Choon Keng was also known as Tang Un Tien. 

In 1960, Tang was [[kidnap]]ped by four armed thugs, but was freed unharmed within 84 hours after the family reportedly paid S$150,000 in [[ransom]].

Tang's first wife died in 1980; he subsequently remarried.  Tang had eight children. On 3 September 2000, Tang died peacefully at home with his family around him at 98 years old.

== Death ==
Tang died on 3 September 2000 in Singapore.

'''WHNZ''' (1250 [[Hertz|kHz]], "Impact Radio") is a commercial [[AM broadcasting|AM]] [[radio station]] [[city of license|licensed]] to [[Tampa, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://transition.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/amq?call=WHNz&amp;arn=&amp;state=&amp;city=&amp;freq=530&amp;fre2=1700&amp;type=0&amp;facid=&amp;class=&amp;list=0&amp;ThisTab=Results+to+This+Page%2FTab&amp;dist=&amp;dlat2=&amp;mlat2=&amp;slat2=&amp;NS=N&amp;dlon2=&amp;mlon2=&amp;slon2=&amp;EW=W&amp;size=9 FCC.gov/WHNZ]&lt;/ref&gt;  The station's [[broadcast license]] is held by
Citicasters Licenses, Inc., a [[subsidiary]] of [[iHeartMedia, Inc.]].  The station airs a [[radio format]] that mixes [[radio syndication|syndicated]] [[talk radio|talk shows]], [[sports radio|sports]] and paid [[brokered programming]].  WHNZ is one of the eight stations in the [[Tampa Bay area|Tampa Bay]] [[media market|radio market]] owned by iHeartMedia.

The station's studios are located on West Gandy Boulevard in [[South Tampa]].  The [[transmitter]] site is off Memorial Highway in [[Town 'n' Country, Florida]], co-located with [[sister station]] 970 AM [[WFLA (AM)|WFLA]].  By day, WHNZ broadcasts at 25,000 [[watt]]s.  But at night, to avoid interfering with other stations on [[AM 1250]], WHNZ reduces power to 5,900 watts.  The station uses a [[directional antenna]] at all times.

Weekday mornings begin with ''[[This Morning, America's First News with Gordon Deal]]''.  In afternoon [[drive time]], WHNZ carries the ''[[Todd Schnitt]] Show.''  Schnitt for many years was a host on co-owned 970 WFLA in Tampa.  His syndicated show airs in Tampa Bay on WHNZ live at 3pm and it is replayed on WFLA at 6pm.  At night, WHNZ carries [[Fox Sports Radio]].   Brokered programs on money, business and health are heard in middays, evenings and weekends.  [[CBS Radio News]] begins most daytime hours.

==History==
{{for|the history of the 1250 frequency prior to WHNZ|WDAE}}
WHNZ is the successor of two radio stations, co-owned [[WDAE]], one of Florida's oldest radio stations, going on the air May 15, 1922 and spending most of its history at AM 1250.  And it also has history on [[AM 570]] in [[Pinellas Park]], which was WHNZ's original dial position and carried some of the same business and financial shows that are heard on today's WHNZ.

On October 24, 1991, what was then [[WPLP]] was bought by Paxson Communications, the company founded by multi-millionaire [[Bud Paxson]] after he had sold the [[Home Shopping Network]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-YB/1995/B-Radio-AL-MT-YB-1995.pdf Broadcasting Yearbook 1995 page B-90]&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike today's WHNZ, Paxson put a full-time business and financial station on AM 570, changing the [[call sign]] to WHNZ.  Those call letters refer to "Wins Radio," meaning that it will help you win in the business world.  In 1998, Clear Channel Stations, the previous name of iHeartMedia, bought AM 570.  It also bought AM 620 from [[Cox Communications]], after Cox had moved what was [[WSUN (defunct)|WSUN]] and its [[Adult Standards]] format to co-owned [[AM 910]] in nearby [[Plant City, Florida]], in anticipation of a sale.  Once Clear Channel owned all three frequencies, 570, 620 and 1250, it was able to execute a three-way frequency swap.

On New Year's Day, 2000, WDAE's sports format and call sign moved to AM 620.  WHNZ's business format and call sign moved to AM 1250.  And Clear Channel put a [[talk radio|news/talk]] format on AM 570, giving it the [[call sign]] [[WTBN]], which stood for '''T'''ampa '''B'''ay '''N'''ews.  The following year, [[Salem Communications]] took over AM 570, installing a [[Christian radio]] format, heard currently on WTBN.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-YB/2008/Radio-AL-MT-BC-YB-2008.pdf Broadcasting Yearbook 2008 page D-144]&lt;/ref&gt;

WHNZ was the [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship station]] of the [[Tampa Bay Rays]] [[baseball]] team from 2005 to 2008, now heard on WDAE. {{As of|2011}}, WHNZ airs select sporting events moved from WDAE or WFLA due to schedule conflicts. Beginning on May 19th, 2018, WHNZ will be the radio home of the [[Tampa Bay Rowdies]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/whnz/status/997559987248549890 WHNZ on Twitter]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Techdirt]] and ''The Irish Times'' said that O'Brien's 197 IQ score from childhood does not mean his intelligence exceeds that of other adults because scoring is scaled based on age.&lt;ref name="Techdirt 2014-09-25"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140924/14422128627/another-story-fake-brilliant-inventor-is-scorpion-walter-obrien-real-computer-security-genius.shtml|title=Another Story of a 'Fake' Brilliant Inventor?

After completing his [[Leaving Certificate (Ireland)|Leaving Certificate]] at [[St Kieran's College]] in [[Kilkenny]], O'Brien attended the [[University of Sussex]] where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science and [[artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref name="nrs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="it2"/&gt;

===Early interest in computers===
According to the ''[[New Ross Standard]]'', a local paper in O'Brien's home county, his interest in computers began when his primary school started offering a computer course. O'Brien's father gave him livestock as payment for doing chores on the farm, which he sold in order to purchase an [[Amstrad]] personal computer&lt;ref name="nrs"/&gt; at age nine, around 1984.&lt;ref name="it1"/&gt;

Other sources indicate that his interest began when he was 12, when parents bought him a computer.&lt;ref name="irishcentral1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/culture/entertainment/New-CBS-show-to-air-about-Wexford-born-genius-Walter-OBrien.html|title=Wexford-born genius Walter O'Brien chats about the new CBS show on his life|last=Hertz|first=Kayla|date=17 September 2014|work=IrishCentral|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Brien has stated that when he was thirteen years old ({{circa|1988}}), he hacked into [[NASA]] under the pseudonym "Scorpion".&lt;ref name="januam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telestar.fr/2015/articles/scorpion-m6-l-histoire-vraie-de-walter-o-brien-le-hacker-qui-a-inspire-la-s-85069|title=Scorpion, M6: l'histoire vraie de Walter O'Brien, le hacker qui a inspiré la série|work=Téléstar|author=Thomas Januam|date=5 March 2015|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Irish Daily Mail'' reported that the incident was unconfirmed.&lt;ref name=DailyMail/&gt;

In an interview with ''Silicon Republic'', an Irish technology news website, O'Brien claimed that the [[NSA]], through [[Interpol]], appeared at his home following the hack.&lt;ref name = "siliconrepublic2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.siliconrepublic.com/companies/2015/09/03/interview-with-scorpion-walter-obrien-goes-to-hollywood |first=John |last=Kennedy |title=Interview with Scorpion: Walter O'Brien goes to Hollywood |work=Silicon Republic|date=3 September 2015|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told the agents he would help show them vulnerabilities in their network in exchange for not getting into trouble.&lt;ref name=cbs1/&gt; According to O'Brien, he had an extradition document ready in his backpack, but he could not provide more details on the deal that was made due to non-disclosure agreements.&lt;ref name="it2"/&gt;

French tabloid ''Telestar'' reported that there is no record of the alleged NASA hack.&lt;ref name="januam"/&gt; ''[[Techdirt]]'' pointed out that the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] -- which CBS showed surrounding O'Brien's family's home in the television show -- did not exist at the time of the alleged hack.&lt;ref name="Techdirt 2014-09-25"/&gt;

O'Brien was a member of the Irish team that participated in the 1993 [[International Olympiad in Informatics]] computer coding competition.&lt;ref name="Karlin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compapp.dcu.ie/~cdaly/ioi/ioi_pics.html|title=IOI pictures|work=Charlie Day personal webpage|author=Charlie Day|date=28 November 1994|accessdate=23 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970715005724/http://www.compapp.dcu.ie/~cdaly/ioi/ioi_pics.html|archivedate=15 July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university from which he graduated shows his team finished the 1993 Olympiad in 90th place out of 250.&lt;ref name="Karlin"/&gt;

==Career==
O'Brien allegedly founded Scorpion Computer Services at age 13 in 1988.&lt;ref name="irishcentral1"/&gt; ''The Irish Times'' reported he brought the business with him in the late 1990s, after graduating from college and moving to the United States.&lt;ref name="it1"/&gt; The ''New Ross Standard'' wrote that Scorpion Computer Services started as an IT tutoring service that expanded into security and risk management,&lt;ref name="nrs"/&gt; and ''The Irish Times'' also described Scorpion Computer Services as an artificial-intelligence company.&lt;ref name="it1"/&gt; In 2014, O'Brien described his company as a think tank for "high IQ individuals".&lt;ref name=cbs1/&gt;&lt;ref name="irishcentral1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyp&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2014/09/21/scorpion-set-to-get-high-tech-on-cbs|title='Scorpion' set to get high-tech on CBS|work=New York Post|first=Andrea|last= Morabito|date=21 September 2014|accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fastcompany1&gt;{{cite news|title=How the real hacker behind CBS'S "Scorpion made a show to grow his own company, and more hackers|author=Susan Karlin|work=Fast Company|url=http://www.fastcocreate.com/3036367/how-the-real-hacker-behind-cbs-scorpion-made-a-show-to-grow-his-own-company-and-more-hackers|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, [[Jane's]] reported that the [[U.S. Army]] was using Scorpion's artificial intelligence tool, ScenGen, on its unmanned aerial systems.&lt;ref name = janes&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.janes.com/article/77435/us-army-licenses-scorpion-s-scengen-ai-for-ugcs | title = US Army licenses Scorpion's ScenGen AI for UGCS| publisher = Jane's | accessdate = 30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boston Marathon bombing===
{{see also|Boston Marathon bombing}}
A month after the bombing at the [[2013 Boston Marathon]], Fox 11 LA-[[KTTV]] (Los Angeles) reported that O'Brien's company, Scorpion Computer Services, Inc., developed video-analysis software similar to that used by the FBI to catch the bombers.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Hirasuna. Fox 11 LA-KTTV 10:00 News. {{Youtube|id=EFk9Sliuj9E|title=Boston Bombing Video Forensics}}. June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Techdirt]]'' said that this was one of many "bogus" claims about O'Brien by CBS.&lt;ref name="Techdirt 2014-09-25"/&gt;
Asher Langton, a security intelligence engineer, said O'Brien offered conflicting narratives of his contributions to catching the bombers and that the use of facial recognition software in the manner reported was implausible.&lt;ref name="Karlin"/&gt; O'Brien said he was bound by non-disclosure agreements.&lt;ref name="Karlin"/&gt;&lt;ref name=bostoncbs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boston.cbslocal.com/2014/10/06/real-life-scorpion-helped-id-boston-marathon-bombing-suspects|title=Real-Life 'Scorpion' Helped ID Boston Marathon Bombing Suspects|publisher=CBS Boston WBZ-TV|author=Kathryn Hauser|date=6 October 2014|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CBS show===
{{Main|Scorpion (TV series)}}
According to O'Brien, in an effort to promote his company Scorpion Computer Services, Inc. and its service Concierge Up, he came up with the idea to create a television show.&lt;ref name = entrepreneur/&gt; O'Brien contacted [[Scooter Braun]] who shopped the idea to CBS.&lt;ref name = entrepreneur&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/272242 | title =The Kid Who Hacked NASA Servers at Age 13 Now Has His Own Television Show | publisher = Entrepreneur Magazine | accessdate = 6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Karlin"/&gt; In September 2014, CBS premiered the first season of the drama series, ''Scorpion'', based on O'Brien's alleged life experiences.&lt;ref name="it1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=cbs1/&gt; He serves as an [[executive producer]] for the series,&lt;ref name=cbs1/&gt; and regularly contributes to story development.&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter"&gt;{{cite news|title='Scorpion': What Happens When a Certified Genius Crashes the Writers Room?|first=Lesley|last=Goldberg|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=22 September 2014|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/scorpion-what-happens-a-certified-733544|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his part in story development O'Brien consults with series writers on technical aspects of the plot, including how he would solve problems presented in the show's scripts.&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter"/&gt; The technical aspects of the plot, however, were a reason for the [[National Science Teachers Association]] to advise teachers to use the show as an example of incorrect or exaggerated science in 2015.&lt;ref name = nstanewsonscorpion&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nsta.org/publications/news/story.aspx?id=60166 | publisher = NTSA News | title = 'Scorpion Stung by Weak Science| accessdate = 22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Brien also consults with Elyes Gabel, the actor who plays the fictional Walter O'Brien. In an interview with CBS News to promote the second season, Gabel said about O'Brien that "he's out saving the world or talking to, you know, princes of [[Liechtenstein]]. So every now and again, I get the chance to talk to him and he'll call me up. And sometimes we talk about the show. Sometimes we talk about characters."&lt;ref name = cbsseason2promo&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/news/scorpion-stars-step-up-action-comedy-for-season-2/ | publisher = CBS News | title = 'Scorpion' season 2 news: Elyes Gabel comments on relationship with real Walter O' Brien| accessdate = 26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first season attracted more than 26 million viewers.&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/ratings/audience-for-cbs-premiere-of-scorpion-tops-26-million-via-35-day-multi-platform-viewing-1201350860|title=Audience For CBS' Premiere of 'Scorpion' Tops 26 Million Via 35-Day Multi-Platform Viewing|publisher=Variety Magazine|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBS ordered a full season of ''Scorpion'' in October 2014 and renewed it for a second season in 2015.

==Accuracy of biography==
In 2014, [[CNET]], [[Techdirt]], and [[Fast Company (magazine)|''Fast Company'']] evaluated CBS' claims about O'Brien's accomplishments, widely reported in the media, following questions to ''Fast Company''.&lt;ref name=Karlin/&gt; ''[[The Irish Times]]'' said that "it is impossible to substantiate some claims."&lt;ref name=it2/&gt; In a follow-up interview with Susan Karlin of ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company magazine]]'', O'Brien answered some of Karlin's questions but said that he was bound by [[non-disclosure agreement]]s.&lt;ref name=Karlin/&gt;

Karlin wrote that some community edited business directories showed O'Brien's company was much smaller than the 2,600 employees and $1.3 billion in revenues stated in Karlin's original article.&lt;ref name="fastcompany1"/&gt; For example, in 2014 an anonymous editor on Credibility.com recorded Scorpion Computer Services as having 1 employee with annual revenue of $66,000.&lt;ref name=Karlin/&gt;&lt;ref name=credibility&gt;{{cite web|url=https://credibility.com/all-other-professional-scientific-and-technical-services/us-ca-burbank/scorpion-computer-services-inc |date=7 October 2014 |title=Scorpion Computer Services Profile |publisher=Credibility.com |accessdate=11 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007201327/https://credibility.com/all-other-professional-scientific-and-technical-services/us-ca-burbank/scorpion-computer-services-inc |archivedate=7 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Karlin points out that community edited business directories data may be unreliable, and O'Brien stated that most of the company consists of independent contractors who work remotely.&lt;ref name="Karlin"/&gt;

In a [[News.com.au]] interview of [[Elyes Gabel]], the actor who plays the fictional O'Brien in the TV show, the reporter Andrew Fenton says: "But even Elyes Gabel, who plays O'Brien in the show, admits he has some concerns over the veracity of the story. He says that to find the character he had to push those doubts to one side and just accept O'Brien's story as gospel."&lt;ref name=fenton&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/doubts-over-tv-drama-scorpions-true-story-about-a-13yearold-who-hacked-into-nasa/news-story/0617a61fa9aa8c571c458b5ad7590eb8 |title=Doubts over TV drama Scorpion's 'true story' about a 13-year-old who hacked into NASA |work=[[News.com.au]] |author=Andrew Fenton |date=5 September 2015 |accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "That meant everything that he was saying I believe rather than kind of questioning," he says. "That becomes a very dangerous, treacherous area if you don't really fully commit or believe in what somebody is saying. So once I got rid of that, the balance became: 'How do I make this guy? How do I create vulnerability in a character?"

Fenton goes on to say:

:In reality many of O'Brien's claims don't stack up. He says he didn't keep the paperwork showing he scored 197 on an IQ test in primary school — but even if it were true, scores are scaled with age, meaning a high score as a child doesn't reflect his intelligence as an adult. He hasn't taken an official Mensa-approved test since. There's also no evidence of the NASA hack and O'Brien can't provide further details claiming he signed a non-disclosure agreement. And of course Homeland Security was formed as a result of the attack on the Twin Towers and didn't exist when he was 13.&lt;ref name=fenton/&gt;

==Personal life==
O'Brien has lived in [[Los Angeles, California]] since 2001 when he was issued an [[EB-1 visa|E11 visa]] to immigrate to the United States. This type of visa is set aside for people with "extraordinary abilities" and/or who can be considered a national asset.&lt;ref name="irishcentral1"/&gt;

In 2015, ''[[Kilkenny People]]'' reported that O'Brien received a mayoral certificate from the mayor of Kilkenny for his contribution and dedication to the Irish community in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="kilkennypeople"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kilkennypeople.ie/news/kilkenny-news/computer-genius-from-kilkenny-briefs-top-us-army-officials-1-6852855|title=Computer Genius from Kilkenny Briefs Top US Army Officials|publisher=[[Kilkenny People]]|accessdate=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Brien helped fund the start-up cost of Kilkenny Taxi Watch which ''[[Kilkenny People]]'' reported as having prevented 45 suicides through July 2015.&lt;ref name ="kilkennypeople"/&gt;&lt;ref name = IrishExaminer&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/kilkenny-taxi-drivers-lauded-for-saving-45-suicidal-people-349208.html | title = Kilkenny taxi drivers lauded for saving 45 suicidal people| publisher = Irish Examiner | accessdate = 25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 2016, Taxi Watch stated on their [[Facebook]] page that the number of lives saved had reached 100.

O'Brien has spoken at numerous events, including delivering the keynote at the [[MENSA]] 2016 annual gathering event in San Diego,&lt;ref name = mensa&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.us.mensa.org/newsroom/press-releases/mensa-comes-to-san-diego-june-29-july-3/ | title = Mensa comes to San Diego, June 29 - July 3| publisher = MENSA.org | accessdate = 24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Houston Innovation Conference and Showcase.&lt;ref name =xconomy&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.xconomy.com/texas/2015/10/09/the-real-scorpion-suped-up-wearables-more-at-houston-tech-event/ | title = The Real Scorpion, Suped-up Wearables, &amp; More at Houston Tech Event|publisher = Xconomy | accessdate = 12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = houston&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/technology/article/Scorpion-inspiration-sees-high-tech-peril-in-6558666.php | title =Q&amp;A: 'Scorpion' inspiration sees high-tech peril in the real world | publisher = Houston Chronicle | accessdate = 9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, O'Brien was honored with  [[unite4:humanity|unite4:humanity's]] Humanitarian Lifetime Achievement award.&lt;ref name = people&gt;{{ cite web | url  = http://people.com/celebrity/cara-delevingne-accepts-humanitarian-award-for-amber-heard/ | publisher = People magazine | title = Cara Delevingne Accepts Humanitarian Award for Amber Heard After She Had to Leave Event Due to an 'Emergency' | accessdate = 27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
