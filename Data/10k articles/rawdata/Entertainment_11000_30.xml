      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4125">'''120 Sports''' is an [[internet television]] service, operated as a joint venture between [[Time Inc.]], [[Chicago White Sox#Silver Chalice subsidiary|Silver Chalice]], [[MLB Advanced Media]], and the [[National Hockey League]]. The service produces and streams sports news and highlight content catered towards digital platforms and a young adult audience

== History ==
120 Sports was announced on February 20, 2014 by [[Time Inc.]] as a branch of its magazine ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', with financial backing by [[MLB Advanced Media]], the [[National Hockey League]], and [[Chicago White Sox#Silver Chalice subsidiary|Silver Chalice]]. Initially, the service focused on streaming sports news and highlights, particularly from its partners as well as the [[NBA]] and [[NASCAR]]. The name of the service came from its original concept, as these videos would be only two minutes long.&lt;ref name=ct&gt;{{cite news|title=Time Inc, sports leagues to launch online streaming sports network|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-02-21/news/sns-rt-timeinc-120sports--20140221_1_time-inc-sports-network-sports-illustrated|accessdate=August 17, 2016|work=Chicago Tribune|agency=Reuters|publisher=Chicago Tribune Media Group|date=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 25, 2014, 120Sports launched a daily schedule of live studio programming; president Jason Coyle stated that the service wanted to "create a daily habit, where you'll check us multiple times a day and have as long a viewing session as possible". The service was designed to appeal to [[millennial]]s. To avoid succumbing to [[East Coast bias|regional bias]], the network hired reporters from across the country; executive vice president Matt Carstens stated 120 Sports "wanted to have a work base that is diverse in every way — diverse in the sports they follow, diverse in the teams they follow — to prevent any sort of bias".&lt;ref name="ct0"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Channick|first1=Robert|title=All-digital 120 Sports kicking off streaming network|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-06-25/business/ct-digital-sports-network-0625-biz-20140625_1_video-driven-sports-reports-120-sports-silver-chalice|accessdate=August 17, 2016|work=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A morning show, ''120 Morning Run'', was launched on July 2, 2014. It is  hosted by Chicago sports talk veterans Laurence Holmes and Dylan McGorty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Channick|first1=Robert|title=120 Sports is adding a live morning show|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-07-02/business/chi-120-sports-a-live-morning-show-20140701_1_video-driven-sports-reports-all-digital-sports-network-120-sports|accessdate=August 17, 2016|work=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=July 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 13, 2017, it was announced that Silver Chalice had partnered with [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]] to merge [[Campus Insiders]], 120 Sports, and Sinclair's syndication service and linear digital television channel [[American Sports Network]] into a new linear and digital sports network, which is now known as Stadium.&lt;ref name="bandc-asnrevamp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sinclair Partners to Revamp, Relaunch Sports Network|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/local-tv/sinclair-partners-revamp-relaunch-sports-network/164905|website=Broadcasting and Cable|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sbn-asnrelaunch"&gt;{{cite web|title=American Sports Network, Campus Insiders, and 120 Sports Announce Mega-Merger Deal|url=http://www.underdogdynasty.com/2017/4/13/15295142/american-sports-network-campus-insiders-120-sports-announce-mega-merger-deal-tv-online-streaming-g5|website=Underdog Dynasty (SBNation)|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sunherald-stadium"&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Twitter the new home for Southern Miss football?|url=http://www.sunherald.com/sports/college/conference-usa/university-of-southern-mississippi/article148154494.html|website=Sun Herald|accessdate=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Al-Tro Island Park''' was an [[amusement park]] built in the late [[19th century]] in the [[Administrative divisions of New York#Village|village]] of [[Menands, New York|Menands]] near the border with [[Administrative divisions of New York#City|city]] of [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[New York (state)|New York]]; formerly the park was known as Pleasure Island. The island has since been covered with fill and used for [[Interstate 787]].

== History ==
In the 1880s, thousands of visitors jammed Pleasure Island, also known as "Dreamland." In truth, it was not an actual island, but was separated from the mainland by the [[Erie Canal]].&lt;ref name="ATU 2003" /&gt;

By [[Memorial Day]], 1907, Pleasure Island was built up and re-opened as Al-Tro Island Park, named for the two cities it was located between, Albany and [[Troy, New York|Troy]]. It featured 40-piece [[orchestra]] in a dance hall, a roller-skating rink, a [[roller coaster]], a [[movie theater|theater]] with 4,000 seats, its own [[miniature railroad]], a pony track and more than a hundred other attractions. The park even had its own police force consisting of 15 uniformed officers to maintain safety and order. A [[boardwalk]] extended the entire length of the island.&lt;ref name="ATU 1907"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.colonie.org/historian/altro/record_article.pdf |title=Al-Tro Park in readiness for the public |work=Albany Times-Union |orig-year=May 27, 1907 |date=June 30, 1985 |accessdate=July 14, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205165740/http://www.colonie.org/historian/altro/record_article.pdf |archivedate=February 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1920s, Al-Tro Island Park began to fall out of favor due to changing tastes in leisure. No one knows exactly when it closed or what happened to it. Most agree that the park "vanished without a trace." The Mid-City Amusement Park was constructed as a replacement nearby on Broadway, also in Menands, but it too has since been destroyed.&lt;ref name="ATU 2003" /&gt;

==Influence and awards==
It is argued that ''Al Jazirah'' is one of four leading Saudi daily newspapers along with ''[[Al-Watan (Saudi Arabia)|Al Watan]]'', ''[[Al Riyadh (newspaper)|Al Riyadh]]'' and ''[[Al Madina (newspaper)|Al Madina]]''.&lt;ref name=adl/&gt; At the beginning of the 1990s, ''Al Jazirah'' and ''Al Riyadh'' competed against each other to be more influential than the other.&lt;ref name=cable/&gt;

==Content ==
''Al Jazirah'' usually publishes reports and interviews concerning national, Arab and international issues. The paper is mostly  known for its daily supplements on different topics such as economy, sports, culture, computers, medicine and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Al Jazeera |url=http://www.cityscapeabudhabi.com/_Admin/2012-Exhibitor-List/Al-Jazeera/ |publisher=Cityscape |accessdate=20 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120521041621/http://www.cityscapeabudhabi.com/_Admin/2012-Exhibitor-List/Al-Jazeera/ |archivedate=21 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has a weekly supplement, ''Telecom and Digital World''.&lt;ref name=topix/&gt; It also carries cartoons.&lt;ref name=bbc2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=APN/&gt;

The Arab Press Network states that the paper extensively covers the activities of [[House of Saud|the ruling Saudi family]] and adopts an uncritical approach towards the government's policies on most of its 60 daily pages. It is further discussed that its columnists and the debate they initiate are both weak.&lt;ref name=APN&gt;{{cite web|title=Saudi Arabia |url=http://www.arabpressnetwork.org/newspaysv2.php?id=129 |work=The Arab Press Network |accessdate=19 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528072145/http://www.arabpressnetwork.org/newspaysv2.php?id=129 |archivedate=28 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then [[Ministry of Health (Saudi Arabia)|minister of health]] [[Ghazi Abdul Rahman Al Gosaibi|Ghazi Al Gosaibi]]'s poem written for King Fahd, entitled "A Pen Bought and Sold", was published on the front page of the paper in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Labonté|first=Hanna|title=Saudi Man of Letters and Cautious Reformer|url=http://en.qantara.de/Saudi-Man-of-Letters-and-Cautious-Reformer/8370c162/index.html|accessdate=4 September 2012|newspaper=Qantara|date=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the poem, Al Gosaibi indirectly accused the ruling elites, including [[Sultan bin Abdul Aziz|Prince Sultan]], then Minister of Defence, of corruption and Saudi Oger of improper tender activities regarding the public hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abir|first=Mordechai|title=The Consolidation of the Ruling Class and the New Elites in Saudi Arabia|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|date=April 1987|volume=23|issue=2|pages=150–171|jstor=4283169|doi=10.1080/00263208708700697}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=btimes3010/&gt; King Fahd fired him after reading the poem.&lt;ref name=btimes3010&gt;{{cite news|title=Saudi reformer courted the king's attention with a poem|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/obituaries/saudi-reformer-courted-the-kings-attention-with-a-poem-20100829-13xia.html|accessdate=4 September 2012|newspaper=Brisbane Times|date=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 and 10 January 2002, a commentary by Muhammad bin Saad al Shuwayir was published in the paper. The commentary was entitled “Why Pork Is Forbidden?”. The author said that the transformation of [[Jews|the Jews]] into [[ape]]s and [[pig]]s was a punishment “because monkeys and pigs were considered among the lowliest of animals, in nature and manners.” He further stated that Jews always represent the human lowness, as expressed in [[Quran]].&lt;ref name=roth&gt;{{cite web|title=Arab countries 2003-4 |url=http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2003-4/arab.htm |publisher=Stephen Roth Institute |accessdate=16 May 2012 |year=2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513071317/http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2003-4/arab.htm |archivedate=13 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jasser Abdulaziz al Jasser, a columnist of ''Al Jazirah'', criticised [[Russia]], especially [[Sergey Lavrov]], for supporting Assad regime's [[Alawite]] minority rule over a [[Sunni]] majority in [[Syria]] on 24 March 2012.

==Controversy==
In September 2008, a reporter of the paper, Fahd al Jukhaidib, wrote an article in which he described frequent power cuts in [[Qubba]] in northern Saudi Arabia. The article also informed the readers about a protest in front of the government-owned electricity company as a result of power cuts experienced. Upon publication of his article, he was  sentenced in October 2008 to two months in prison and 50 lashes for inciting the public to protest against a series of electric power reductions. He was free on appeal in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Attacks on the Press 2010: Middle East and North Africa Developments|url=http://cpj.org/2011/02/attacks-on-the-press-2010-middle-east-north-africa-developments.php|publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists (CPR)|accessdate=19 May 2012|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Innovation==
''Al Jazirah'' seems not to be conservative in terms of using technology to provide advanced technological platforms to its readers. The paper is  the first Saudi daily in launching online website that was formed in 1996.&lt;ref name=com/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electronic newspapers on the Internet|url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/3503/1/327651.pdf|work=University of  Sheffield|accessdate=1 October 2013|author=Fayez A.

'''''All This, and Heaven Too''''' is a 1940 American drama film made by [[Warner Bros.]]-[[First National Pictures]], produced and directed by [[Anatole Litvak]] with [[Hal B. Wallis]] as executive producer. The [[screenplay]] was adapted by [[Casey Robinson]] from the novel by [[Rachel Field]]. The music was by [[Max Steiner]] and the cinematography by [[Ernest Haller|Ernie Haller]]. The film stars [[Bette Davis]] and [[Charles Boyer]] with [[Barbara O'Neil]], [[Jeffrey Lynn]], [[Virginia Weidler]], [[Helen Westley]], [[Walter Hampden]], [[Henry Daniell]], [[Harry Davenport (actor)|Harry Davenport]], [[George Coulouris]], [[Montagu Love]], [[Janet Beecher]] and [[June Lockhart]].

Rachel Field's novel is based on the true story of Field's great-aunt, Henriette Deluzy Desportes, a French governess who fell in love with the Duc de Praslin, her employer. When Praslin's wife, the Duchesse, was murdered, Henriette was implicated. It was a real-life scandal that contributed to the political turmoil before the [[French Revolution of 1848]] which deposed France's [[Louis Philippe I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/574/All-This-and-Heaven-Too/articles.html|title=All This, and Heaven Too (1940) - Articles - TCM.com|author=|date=|work=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/37793248|title=Henriette Desportes Field (1813-1875)|work=findagrave.com|accessdate=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexis de Tocqueville, Souvenirs, édition réalisée par Luc Monnier, Paris, Gallimard, 1942&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[Image:All This and Heaven Too trailer.JPG|200px|left|thumb|Screenshot of [[Charles Boyer]] and [[Bette Davis]] from the film's original trailer]]
Mademoiselle Henriette Deluzy-Desportes ([[Bette Davis]]), a French woman, starts teaching at an American girls school. She is confronted by the tales and gossip about her that circulate among her pupils and, thus provoked, she decides to tell them her life story.&lt;!-- it constitutes about what fraction of the film? --&gt;

Deluzy-Desportes is governess to the four children of the [[Charles de Choiseul-Praslin|Duc de Praslin]] ([[Charles Boyer]]) and the Duchesse de Praslin ([[Barbara O'Neil]]) in Paris during the last years of the [[Orleans monarchy]]. As a result of the Duchesse's constantly erratic and temperamental behavior, all that remains is an unhappy marriage, but the Duc remains with his wife for sake of their children.

Deluzy-Desportes. with her warmth and kindness, wins the love and affection of the children and their father, but also the jealousy and hatred of their mother. She is forced to leave and the Duchess refuses to give her a letter of recommendation to future employers. The Duc confronts his wife and she invents alternative letters taking opposite attitudes, which in fact she has not written and does not intend to write. Her account enrages him and, at the breaking point, he kills her.

The Duc de Praslin is in a privileged position; as a peer his case can only be heard by other nobles. He refuses to confess his guilt or openly to admit his love for Henriette Deluzy-Desportes, knowing that his fellow nobles wish to use such an admission to blame her for the murder by declaring that he was acting at her bidding. Ultimately the Duc takes poison to prevent himself from ever publicly proclaiming his love for Henriette, since he knows that would convict her; however, he lives long enough to reveal it to another of his servants, Pierre ([[Harry Davenport (actor)|Harry Davenport]]), a kindly old man who had warned the governess to leave the de Praslin household. With the Duc's death, the authorities accept that they have no evidence upon which to base a judgment that Henriette solicited the murder and she is released.

Deluzy-Desportes had been recommended for the teaching position "in the land of the free" by an American minister, Rev. Henry Field ([[Jeffrey Lynn]]), to whom she had expressed a loss of faith while in prison. He proposes marriage, and it is implied that Henriette will accept.

==Reception==
The film was positively reviewed by critics. [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that film-goers willing to sit through the long running time "will find the film a source of much emotional satisfaction; others of less Spartan stamp will certainly protest that it wears out their patience in the telling of a comparatively uncomplicated tale. For the Warners are here handing out a tear-laden old-fashioned drama—and a very heavy one, too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9903EEDA123EE432A25756C0A9619C946193D6CF|title=Movie Review - All This, and Heaven Too|last=Crowther|first=Bosley|authorlink=Bosley Crowther|date=July 5, 1940|website=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it "film theatre at its best ... Casey Robinson in the scripting captured the quaintness of the manners and customs of Paris, in 1848, and succeeded admirably in retaining both spirit and characters of the novel, despite the necessity for much deletion of material."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|date=June 12, 1940|title=All This, and Heaven Too|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|location=New York|publisher=Variety, Inc.|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Film Daily]]'''s headline announced: "Dramatically powerful, beautifully mounted and superbly cast; film should be one of year's strongest box-office attractions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=June 17, 1940|title=Reviews of the New Films|journal=[[Film Daily]]|location=New York|publisher=Wid's Films and Folk Folk, Inc.|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' wrote: "A powerful drama, with a strong appeal for women. The production is lavish, and the direction and performances are of the highest order."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=June 22, 1940|title=''All This, and Heaven Too'' with Bette Davis, Charles Boyer, Jeffrey Lynn and Barbara O'Neil|journal=[[Harrison's Reports]]|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Mosher (writer)|John Mosher]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote that Litvak had swung the viewer into the historical setting "with all the romantic, profuse gusto at his command. I think a few of the scenes of governess and children might have been elided, for, with the sinister doings in the background, we can't forever sustain a nursery mood. In general, though, the long picture seems short, which, of course, is something very much in its favor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|date=July 6, 1940|title=The Current Cinema|magazine=[[The New Yorker]]|location=New York|publisher=F-R Publishing Corp.|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''All This, and Heaven Too'' placed fifth on ''Film Daily'''s year-end nationwide poll of 546 critics naming the best films of 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 14, 1941|title='Rebecca' wins Critics' Poll|journal=[[Film Daily]]|location=New York|publisher=Wid's Films and Folk Folk, Inc.|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Annals of Improbable Research''''' ('''''AIR''''') is a bi-monthly [[magazine]] devoted to scientific humor, in the form of a [[Satire|satirical]] take on the standard academic journal. ''AIR'', published six times a year since 1995, usually showcases at least one piece of scientific research being done on a strange or unexpected topic, but most of their articles concern real or fictional absurd experiments, such as a comparison of [[apples and oranges]] using [[infrared spectroscopy]]. Other features include such things as ratings of the [[cafeteria]]s at scientific institutes, fake classifieds and advertisements for a medical plan called HMO-NO, and a very odd letters page. The magazine is headquartered in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].

''AIR'' awards the annual science [[Ig Nobel Prize]]s, for ten achievements that "first make people laugh, and then make them think".  ''AIR'' also runs the Luxuriant Flowing Hair Club for Scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://improbable.com/projects/hair/|title=Improbable Research|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

''AIR'' is not the first science parody magazine. The ''[[Journal of Irreproducible Results]]'' (''JIR'') was founded by [[Alex Kohn]] and [[Harry Lipkin]] in 1955, but most of its editorial staff, including editor [[Marc Abrahams]], left after the magazine was bought by publisher [[George Scherr]] in 1994. Scherr filed a number of court actions against ''AIR'', alleging that it was deceptively similar to the ''Journal'' and that it had stolen the name "Ig Nobel Prize", but these actions were unsuccessful.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

== Profile ==
Occasional ''AIR'' articles are factual and illuminating, if a bit offbeat. For example, in 2003 researcher-documentary producer [[Nick T. Spark]] wrote about the background and history of [[Murphy's Law]] in a four-part article, "Why Everything You know About Murphy's Law is Wrong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.improb.com/airchives/paperair/volume9/v9i5/murphy/murphy0.html|title=Improbable Research|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014113936/http://www.improb.com/airchives/paperair/volume9/v9i5/murphy/murphy0.html|archivedate=2009-10-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revised, expanded and later published in June 2006 as the book ''[[A History of Murphy's Law]]''.  Another example: it was scientifically proved and waggishly reported that [[Scientific instrument|instruments]]  can distinguish shit from [[Shinola (shoe polish)|Shinola]].&lt;ref name="Cellannia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neatorama.com/2014/02/11/Spectroscopic-Discrimination-of-Shit-from-Shinola/

'''Art Vincent''' (December 30, 1926 - October 27, 1993) was an American jazz [[disc jockey]], concert producer and MC.

Vincent's broadcasting career spanned almost 30 years, from about 1960 through 1989. For much of that time, his program, "The Art of Jazz," aired on FM radio stations in New Jersey and was heard throughout the New York metropolitan area. Vincent was known for his smooth, resonant voice and encyclopedic knowledge of jazz. He championed jazz as a unique American art form on a par with western classical music.

A popular part of Vincent's radio broadcasts were his interviews with jazz greats, including [[Louis Armstrong]], Count Basie, Dave Brubeck, Ray Charles, Roy Eldridge, Duke Ellington, Tal Farlow, Art Farmer, Dizzie Gillespie, Jimmy Hamilton, Woody Herman, Richard "Groove" Holmes, Kenyon Hopkins, Stan Kenton, Gerry Mulligan, Peter Nero, Anita O'Day, Houston Person, Arthur Prysock, Lou Rawls, Don Sebesky, Jimmy Smith, Maxine Sullivan, Dr. Billy Taylor, Cal Tjader, Dinah Washington - and many others.

== Career ==

=== Radio and concert work ===

In 1956, Art Vincent developed the engineering plans for radio station WFHA. He and the station manager built WFHA from the ground up, completing it in 1959. Vincent became the station's chief engineer.&lt;ref name="bb65"&gt;[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-YB/1965/B2-1965-YB-All.pdf 1965 Broadcasting Yearbook], p. B-97&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1960, Vincent hosted his first broadcast on WFHA, a short-lived country music show. In 1961 he debuted his show, "The Art of Jazz."

Vincent broadcast a wide range of jazz recordings, from obscure to popular, including all genres, such as blues, Dixieland, manouche, bebop, contemporary, avant garde, etc. His shows often included contests and topical call-in segments.&lt;ref name="nyt73"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com New York Times], May 20, 1973  p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Jazz musicians were frequent in-studio guests, and Vincent would often play interviews he had recorded on-location. Through this rich and varied format, he strove to give his audience a quality listening experience.

Vincent was a maverick, refusing to follow some of the commercial broadcasting conventions of his day. He wouldn't speak over the beginning or end of a track, as was the norm for most DJs of the time. He would play several tracks in sequence, talk-free and without commercials. He declined to use management-endorsed playlists, instead developing unique playlists for each broadcast, based on his personal taste and feedback from listeners and musicians.

In 1967 Vincent moved his show to WJLK&lt;ref name="bb67"&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/magazine-archive Billboard], Vol. 79 No. 17 April 29, 1967  p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; and then to WRLB in 1969. He was popular in the NY area jazz community, and developed close relationships with fans and musicians alike. In 1972, he was a guest on the WOR television program, [[Joe Franklin|"The Joe Franklin Show,"]] along with flutist Bobbi Humphrey. Vincent also appeared on the Franklin show in the late 1960s or early 1970s, with his longtime friend, guitarist Tal Farlow. Additionally, Farlow composed theme music for the "Art of Jazz," writing two iterations of the theme: "Blue Art" and "Blue Art, Too." Farlow released the latter version on LP in 1981, much to the delight of Vincent and his fans.

Throughout his career, Vincent served as master of ceremonies for jazz concerts in New Jersey and elsewhere. In 1972, he was instrumental in starting what became a long-running jazz performance series at the Monmouth County Library in New Jersey.&lt;ref name="njjs"&gt;[http://www.njjs.org/p/jjArchive/pdf/JJ3604.pdf Jersey Jazz, Journal of the New Jersey Jazz Society], April 2008, Vol 36 Issue 34 p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Vincent proposed the idea, and worked with library management to plan the first jazz concerts held in a U.S. public library reading room. He served as MC&lt;ref name="tdr73"&gt;[http://209.212.22.88/data/rbr/1970-1979/1973/1973.05.15.pdf Daily Register], May 15, 1973  p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tdr74"&gt;[http://209.212.22.88/data/rbr/1970-1979/1974/1974.01.21.pdf Daily Register], January 21, 1974  p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; for the initial three years of the series. Vincent also produced dozens of jazz concerts, at various venues, featuring performers such as Ruth Brown, Tal Farlow, Jimmy Heath, Etta Jones, Hank Jones, Wynton Marsalis, Ray Nance, Zoot Simms, Grady Tate, Teddy Wilson and other top players.&lt;ref name="app89"&gt;[http://www.app.com Asbury Park Press], January 3, 1989  p. C6&lt;/ref&gt; (Vincent can be heard as MC on the final track of guitarist Eddie Hazell's 1976 album "Take Your Shoes Off, Baby.") In the mid 1970s, with friends and colleagues, he started the AOJ &amp; Company, a non-profit organization devoted to the promotion of jazz through live concerts, lectures and member networking.&lt;ref name="tdr74b"&gt;[http://209.212.22.88/data/RBR/1970-1979/1974/1974.10.15.pdf Daily Register], October 15, 1974 p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 the "Art of Jazz" show moved to NPR affiliate WBGO.&lt;ref name="app80"&gt;[http://www.app.com Asbury Park Press], May 25, 1980  p. H14&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Vincent was heard on NPR hosting the EBU's French Jazz Festival (and again in 1981). In 1980, Vincent co-hosted the "Kool Jazz Festival" on NPR, live from Gracie Mansion in New York City. For the 1980-81 Golden Apple Awards, NYC Jazz Magazine readers nominated Vincent as the best DJ in the local jazz community. Vincent left WBGO in 1981, but continued to be active in the New York area jazz scene. In the mid-1980s he was heard on WBJB.&lt;ref name="db84"&gt;[http://www.downbeat.com Down Beat], April 1984  p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, Vincent recorded a series of jazz musician interviews for Florida-based "Backstage America," a nationally syndicated program of arts-related news and commentary.&lt;ref name="app89" /&gt;&lt;ref name="db89"&gt;[http://www.downbeat.com Down Beat], January 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Vincent's 15 minute "Jazzcast" segments were heard on radio stations in 17 states. He interviewed over 75 musicians for this series, including Toshiko Akiyoshi, Betty Carter, Buck Clayton, Panama Francis, Chico Hamilton, Milt Hinton, Clifford Jordan, Branford Marsalis, David "Fathead" Newman, and Sun Ra, to name a few.

Vincent's radio show received a mention in Batt Johnson's book, [http://www.battjohnson.com/pub_jazz.htm "What is This Thing Called Jazz?"] (iUniverse, 2000). Part of Vincent's 1973 interview with bassist Gene Ramey is quoted in Richard Lawn's textbook, [http://ricklawn.com/category/books/ "Experiencing Jazz"] (McGraw-Hill, 2006; Routledge, 2nd ed. 2012).{{clear|left}}

'''''Basketball Pro Management''''' (BPM) is a [[video game]] that gives the player the opportunity to manage the basketball team of his choice. This [[management game]] includes both European Championships and the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. The last version is Basketball Pro Management 2015. [[Umix Studios]] and [[Cyanide (company)|Cyanide]] decided to create a new game for the season 2015-2016 : [[Pro Basketball Manager]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsogaming.com/news/pro-basketball-manager-2016-coming-this-january-on-pc-first-screenshots-unveiled/ announce of the new series]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
BPM was developed by [[Victor Da Costa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metrofrance.com/lyon/un-lyonnais-cree-un-jeu-video-tout-seul/mmdb!9IO8KUaHTI4I/ Starting a video game all by himself] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with Basketball News in March 2012, he explained that the game was developed while he was student at [[INSA Lyon]], before seeking an editor. The [[Umix Studios]] are composed by the people involved in the project (database and design).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ilovebasket.com/index.php?2011/11/10/752-basket-pro-management Yoann Noblet's interview]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120122710/http://ilovebasket.com/index.php?2011%2F11%2F10%2F752-basket-pro-management |date=January 20, 2013  }} {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gamingway.fr/interview-victor-da-costa-ceo-dumix-studios-et-createur-de-basketball-pro-management/ Victor DA COSTA's interview 2013 {{fr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
The principle is similar to the [[Football Manager|football management games]], the player is the coach and team manager. He must manage his starting lineup, recruitment, training of young players, the detection of new talent, training, implementation tactics, budget management, management the staff (assistant coach, physiotherapist, scouts, physical trainer), tactics and systems, management games.

The game has a tactic management: it is possible to create your own systems by choosing the actions of each player at every moment. The Data Editor allows the player to modify the characteristics of any player / team / coach. The game is available in French and English. The game has twenty playable championships, including four in France. The [[NBA]] has been added in updates a few weeks after the release of the 2012 version.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playitlive.fr/2012/02/la-ligue-americaine-aussi-dans-basketball-pro-management-2012/ NBA Addition] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the game developers have proposed updates to fix reported bugs on the forum and to add some features asked by the players.

'''DJ Carl Blaze''' (born '''Carlos Rivera'''; November 15, 1976 - December 23, 2006) was an [[United States|American]] [[DJ]] of [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] descent on New York City's Hip-Hop and R&amp;B [[radio station]] [[WWPR-FM|Power 105.1]] for over three years. He hosted many parties and was a DJ for several [[Nightclub|clubs]] throughout [[New York City]]. Rivera was born in the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] section of [[New York City]].

==Death==
On December 7, 2006 Carl Blaze was the victim of a fatal shooting outside an apartment building near the Inwood section of Manhattan where he was said to have been shot 12 to 16 times at about 4:30 am.

'''Julia Rosa Capristán García''' (8 October 1926 – 18 September 2018), better known by [[stage name]] '''Carmencita Lara''', was a Peruvian singer of waltzes, huaynos, marineras, polkas and pasillo. She is considered by many Peruvians referring to the perfect music to "drown the sorrows". Obituaries recognized the sharp tone of her voice, her particular interpretation and the accompaniment of the accordion of [[Víctor Lara]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://elcomercio.pe/luces/musica/fallecio-cantante-carmencita-lara-video-noticia-nndc-558869 Carmencita Lara: falleció cantante peruana a los 91 años] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vocesdelimanorte.com/noticias/Distrito_de_Comas_declara_Hijos_Predilectos_a_Carmencita_Lara_y-a-su-esposo_Victor_Lara_Vasquez_por_difusion_de_musica_peruana.html COMAS DECLARO HOY "HIJOS PREDILECTOS" A "CARMENCITA LARA" Y A SU ESPOSO VÍCTOR LARA VÁSQUEZ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216084659/http://www.vocesdelimanorte.com/noticias/Distrito_de_Comas_declara_Hijos_Predilectos_a_Carmencita_Lara_y-a-su-esposo_Victor_Lara_Vasquez_por_difusion_de_musica_peruana.html# |date=2013-02-16 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://rpp.pe/musica/conciertos/carmencita-lara-celebra-88-anos-de-vida-cantandole-al-peru-noticia-732085 Carmencita Lara celebra 88 años de vida cantándole al Perú] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She began her first steps as an amateur singer at age 15, on several radio stations in [[Lima]], but professionally at age 18.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lainolvidable.pe/noticias/entretenimiento/trayectoria-musical-de-carmencita-lara-29887#1 LA TRAYECTORIA MUSICAL DE CARMENCITA LARA] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doña Julia and Don Víctor met in 1948, in [[Miraflores District, Lima|Miraflores]], when she was looking for a piano teacher. Since then, he stayed with her.&lt;ref&gt;[https://elcomercio.pe/luces/musica/carmencita-lara-reina-rockolas-cumple-hoy-88-anos-178263 Carmencita Lara, la reina de las rockolas, cumple hoy 88 años] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Víctor Lara was the one who came to baptize her with the pseudonym Carmencita Lara. At the moment that she had to register in a dependency of the state, Julia wanted to do it with the pseudonym of July García. The official replied that they did not register foreign artists there, implying that she did not like the name. Victor told Julia: - "Put Carmencita just like my mom and we complete with Lara".{{cn|date=September 2018}}

She went through all the radio stations looking for an opportunity, until the first contract arrived. The contract was made with[Radio Excelsior, on 2 June 1955. The owner of the radio station had listened to her in a restaurant located next to the [[Plaza Mayor, Lima|Plaza de Armas]] where she went to sing. Her first recording was ''Olvídala amigo'', composition of the iqueño Luis R. Cueto, and of whom don Víctor was the one of the idea to record it. For this they used an accordion, [[cajón]] and double bass accompaniment instruments. This at the beginning of the 60s in a studio by the guitarist, Óscar Avilés.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rpp.pe/musica/nacional/cantante-carmencita-lara-fallecio-a-los-91-anos-noticia-1150570 Cantante Carmencita Lara falleció a los 91 años] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teleamazonas.com/2018/09/peru-llora-la-muerte-de-carmencita-lara-2/ Perú llora la muerte de Carmencita Lara] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.last.fm/es/music/Carmencita+Lara/+wiki Biografía] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From there they came, ''Llora, llora corazón''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.msn.com/es-ar/noticias/otras/restos-de-carmencita-lara-ser%C3%A1n-velados-en-su-vivienda-en-comas/vi-BBNwxPp Restos de Carmencita Lara serán velados en su vivienda en Comas] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;, ''Indio'' by [[Alicia Maguiña]], singer-songwriter and researcher, who has always highlighted the value of Carmencita for the popular culture. Other tracks she recorded: ''Clavel Marchito'' by Armando Gonzáles, ''Milagro'' by Augusto Rojas Llerena and ''El Árbol de mi casa'' by Salvador Oda.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.americatv.com.pe/noticias/espectaculos/cantante-carmencita-lara-sufrio-infarto-cerebral-n183367 Cantante Carmencita Lara sufrió infarto cerebral] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple of artists made a series of contributions to Peruvian music. She ended the stigma that the criollos do not sing huaynos. She was an innovator of the Peruvian waltz, not only in her way of interpreting it but also in the instrumental accompaniment she had. Don Víctor Lara, contributed incorporating for the first time the sound of the accordion and the battery in the Peruvian waltz. In addition, she devised the successful formula of fusing the female voice with the harp. She used ''¡Llora cholo, llora y sufre!'' as the lema in the beginnings of the concerts.

'''''De Stem des Bloeds''''' (''The Voice of Blood''), also known as '''''Njai Siti''''', is a 1930 film from the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now Indonesia). It was directed by [[Ph. Carli]] and starred Annie Krohn, Sylvain Boekebinder, Vally Lank, and Jan Kruyt. The film follows a man and his mistress who reunite after their son and step-daughter unwittingly fall in love. The [[black-and-white film]], which may now be [[lost film|lost]], was tinted different colours for certain scenes. It was released in early 1930 to commercial success, although critical opinion was mixed.

==Plot==
Van Kempen is a supervisor at a tea plantation named Ciranu in [[West Java]]. He keeps a mistress, or ''[[njai]]'', named Siti. Together they have two children, Adolf and Annie. One day, van Kempen returns to the Netherlands, leaving Siti and their young mixed-race children behind. In the Netherlands he marries a young widow and takes her daughter, Ervine, as his step-daughter. Siti, meanwhile, lives with her uncle in a hut in the forest and prays fervently for van Kempen's return, even asking for help from the local shaman (''[[dukun]]'').

Fifteen years later, after his wife dies, van Kempen and Ervine return to the [[Dutch East Indies|Indies]]. He has been hired as a supervisor at another plantation, not far from his old place of work. He searches for Siti and the couple's children, but none of his old coworkers know where they are. Unbeknownst to van Kempen, his children have been raised as natives and wear the traditional clothes, although they have also received a Western education. Adolf has become a hunter, while Annie stays at home with their mother.
Frederick, the new manager at Ciranu, has meanwhile fallen for Ervine and tries unsuccessfully to woo her.

Some time afterwards, as Ervine is wandering through the woods she stumbles upon a deer and, startled, faints. Adolf comes across her and brings her back to the plantation, where van Kempen recognises him and takes him on as a supervisor. Frederick, however, is jealous of Adolf and Ervine's relationship and entices the workers at van Kempen's plantation to go on strike until Adolf is fired. Although heartbroken, van Kempen must fire his son.

Adolf goes to [[Lampung]], in [[Sumatra]], to hunt elephants. Meanwhile, Frederick has begun wooing Annie, who rejects him as Ervine did before. When Adolf returns and hears of the supervisor's actions, he fights Frederick and knocks him out. Ervine, meanwhile, has heard that her lover has returned and goes to the hut in the woods, nearly fainting after being caught in a downpour. Adolf sends a letter to van Kempen telling him where to find Ervine. The family are reunited.{{efn|Derived from {{harvnb|Biran|2009|pp=120–121}}}}

==Production==
''De Stem des Bloeds'' was directed by [[Flip Carli|Ph. "Flip" Carli]], a man of [[Indo people|mixed Indonesian-European descent]]{{sfn|Abel|2005|p=461}} who had previously made several [[documentary film|documentaries]].{{sfn|JCG, Carli, F}} He targeted the film at Dutch audiences, which may account for the focus on [[native Indonesians|native]] customs and farming; such coverage was unusual for contemporary works of fiction, although documentaries had handled the subject before.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=119}} His [[production house]], which handled the film, was the [[Bandung]]-based Kinowerk Carli;{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, De Stem Des Bloed}}{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=124, 126}} some contemporary reviews erroneously gave the house's name as Cosmos Film.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=124, 126}}

Production began in late 1929 or early 1930,{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=119}} with scenes shot in West Java and Sumatra.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, De Stem Des Bloed}} ''De Stem Des Bloed'' starred Annie Krohn, Carli's mixed-race wife, as Annie{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=124, 126}} as well as Sylvain Boekebinder (van Kempen), Vally Lank, and Jan Kruyt. The story was advertised as being adapted from the novel of the same name.{{sfn|De Indiesch Courant 1930, (untitled)}}

Like all contemporary films produced in the Indies, ''De Stem des Bloeds'' had low [[wikt:production values|production values]].{{sfn|Abel|2005|p=462}} The film was [[silent film|silent]] and in [[black-and-white film|black-and-white]];{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, De Stem Des Bloed}} the final production consisted of 3,652 meters of film.{{sfn|De Indische Courant 1930, Tijdschriften}} The [[intertitle]]s were in Dutch, which the Indonesian film historian [[Misbach Yusa Biran]] notes that most viewers&amp;nbsp;– those who were native or [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]]&amp;nbsp;– were unable to read. In order to provide a semblance of colour, Carli tinted certain scenes entirely in one shade during post-production; for instance, a scene where farmers were gathering rice was tinted violet.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=122}}

==Release and reception==
[[File:De Stem Des Bloed 1930.JPG|thumb|alt=A newspaper advertisement|center|600px|Newspaper advertisement, [[Surabaya]]]]
''De Stem des Bloeds'' was released in 1930, seeing its [[Jakarta|Batavia]] (now Jakarta) premiere on 22 March of that year.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=119}} By July it was being screened in [[Surabaya]], [[East Java]].{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1930, Vermakelijkheden en Bioscopen}} It was reported to be a success, with native audiences filling the theatres in Batavia{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=119}} and Surabaya.{{sfn|De Indiesch Courant 1930, De Films der Week}}

The film received mixed critical reception. An anonymous review in the Batavia-based ''Doenia Film'' praised the film's picture (especially its colour) and both Krohn and Boekebinder's acting.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=122}} A review in the Surabaya-based ''De Indiesche Courant'' likewise praised the film, stating that it "fascinates from beginning to end"{{efn|Original: "''Het werk boeit van het begin tot het eind.''"}} and showed that even in the Indies a "grand" film could be made.{{sfn|De Indiesch Courant 1930, De Films der Week}} However, the review criticised the censorship bureau's failure to catch scenes of Frederick drinking alcohol, which the reviewer found "dangerous to the prestige [of Dutchmen]" considering the large native audiences.{{efn|Original: "''Daar deze film zoovele duizenden Inlanders trekt, schijnt ons de charge op den blanda-administrateur als drinker gevaarlijker voor het prestige''..."}}{{sfn|De Indiesch Courant 1930, De Films der Week}} [[Kwee Tek Hoay]], writing in ''Panorama'', criticised the film extensively, writing that it seemed meant exclusively for Dutch audiences in the Netherlands, as those living in the Indies would be able to see it did not reflect reality and was in places illogical. He found the colouring one extension of this lack of logic, writing that a violet tinge indicated that the farmers were harvesting rice at sunset&amp;nbsp;– something that never happened.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=122}}

==Legacy==
Carli went on to make two more films starring Krohn. The first, ''Sarinah'' (1931), was a romance set on the south coast of Java which had Krohn in the titular role.{{sfn|De Indische Courant 1931, Indische filmkunst}} The second, ''[[Karina's Zelfopoffering]]'' (''Karina's Sacrifice''), followed the following year; this film saw Krohn play a mixed-raced woman living at [[Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat|the palace]] in the [[Sultanate of Yogyakarta]]. ''Karina's Zelfopoffering'' was a commercial failure and Carli left the Indies not long afterwards,{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=124, 126}} moving to the Netherlands. He lived there until his death in 1972.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=189}}

Writing in 2009, Biran suggests that ''De Stem des Bloeds'' was clearly written from an Indo point of view because of the positive roles of Indo children. He finds the film sympathetic to native culture, including the faithful ''njai''. He notes with interest that, although in real life mixed-race children were faced with a sense of disgust, in ''De Stem des Bloeds'' an Indo man is heroic enough to rescue a pure Dutch woman and fight with a Dutchman.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=124, 126}}

The film is likely [[lost film|lost]]. The American visual anthropologist [[Karl G. Heider]] writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost.{{sfn|Heider|1991|p=14}} However, JB Kristanto's ''Katalog Film Indonesia'' (''Indonesian Film Catalogue'') records several as having survived at [[Sinematek Indonesia]]'s archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the [[Netherlands Government Information Service]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=351}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22652">'''Erotic photography''' is a style of [[art photography]] of an [[erotic]], sexually suggestive or [[Nudity and sexuality|sexually provocative]] nature. 

After the 1960s erotic photography began to be less commonly referred to as such, and to be increasingly described as [[glamour photography]].

Erotic photography generally produces a [[Composition (visual arts)|composed image]] of a subject in a still position. Though the subjects of erotic photography are usually completely or mostly [[nudity|unclothed]], that is not a requirement. 

Erotic photography should be distinguished from [[nude photography]], which contains nude subjects not necessarily in an erotic situation, and [[Pornography|pornographic photography]], which is of a sexually explicit nature. Pornographic photography generally does not claim any artistic or aesthetic merit.

Erotic photographs are normally intended for commercial use, including [[mass-produced]] items such as [[calendar (stationery)| decorative calendar]]s, [[Pin-up model|pinups]] and for [[List of men's magazines|men's magazine]]s, such as ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' and ''[[Playboy]]'', but sometimes the photographs are intended to be seen only by a subject's partner. 

The subjects of erotic photographs may be professional models, celebrities or amateurs. Very few well-known entertainers have posed nude for photographs. The first entertainer to pose nude for photographs was the stage actress [[Adah Isaacs Menken]] (1835–1868).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thegreatbare.com/who-is-adah-menken/ |work=The Great Bare |title=Who Is Adah Menken? |accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, a number of well-known [[film star]]s have posed for [[pinup girl]] photographs and been promoted in photography and other media as [[sex symbol]]s. Traditionally, the subjects of erotic photographs have been female, but since the 1970s erotic images of men have also been published.

==Beginnings==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Before 1839, [[depictions of nudity]] and erotica generally consisted of paintings, drawings and engravings. In that year, [[Louis Daguerre]] presented the first practical process of [[photography]] to the [[French Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name = timeline&gt;{{cite web| last = Cross| first = J.M., PhD| title = Nineteenth-Century Photography: A Timeline| work = the Victorian Web| publisher = The University Scholars Programme, National University of Singapore| date = 2001-02-04| url = http://victorianweb.org/photos/chron.html | accessdate = 2006-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike earlier photograph methods, his [[daguerreotype]]s had stunning quality and did not fade with time. Artists adopted the new technology as a new way to depict the nude form, which in practice was the feminine form. In so doing, at least initially, they tried to follow the styles and traditions of the art form. Traditionally, in France, an académie was a nude study done by a painter to master the female (or male) form. Each had to be registered with the French government and approved or they could not be sold. Soon, nude photographs were being registered as académie and marketed as aids to painters. However, the realism of a photograph as opposed to the idealism of a painting made many of these intrinsically erotic.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite video|people=Chris Rodley, Dev Varma, Kate Williams III (Directors) Marilyn Milgrom, Grant Romer, Rolf Borowczak, Bob Guccione, Dean Kuipers (Cast) |date=2006-03-07 |title=Pornography: The Secret History of Civilization |url=http://www.kochvision.com/product.aspx?number=741952635291 |medium=DVD |publisher=Koch Vision |location=Port Washington, NY |accessdate=2006-10-21 |isbn=1-4172-2885-7 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822002054/http://www.kochvision.com/product.aspx?number=741952635291 |archivedate=2010-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Nude Photography, 1840–1920'', Peter Marshall notes: "In the prevailing moral climate at the time of the invention of photography, the only officially sanctioned photography of the body was for the production of artist's studies. Many of the surviving examples of daguerreotypes are clearly not in this genre but have a sensuality that clearly implies they were designed as [[erotic]] or pornographic images".&lt;ref name="about1"&gt;{{cite web

The daguerreotypes were not without drawbacks, however. The main difficulty was that they could only be reproduced by photographing the original picture since each image was an original and the all-metal process does not use [[negative (photography)|negatives]]. In addition, the earliest daguerreotypes had exposure times ranging from three to fifteen minutes, making them somewhat impractical for [[portrait photography|portraiture]]. Unlike earlier drawings, action could not be shown. The poses that the models struck had to be held very still for a long time. Another limitation was the monochrome image that the technology could produce. Because of this, the standard pornographic image shifted from one of two or more people engaged in sex acts to a solitary woman exposing her [[genitals]]. The cost of the process also limited the spread of the technology. Since one picture could cost a week's salary, the audience for nudes mostly consisted of artists and the upper echelon of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lisaskirts.com/MaleSubs_V.htm | title=LisaSkirts.com | accessdate=2006-10-05|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060310235038/http://www.lisaskirts.com/MaleSubs_V.htm|archivedate=2006-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Stereoscope|Stereoscopy]] was invented in 1838 and became extremely popular for daguerreotypes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Wheatstone| first = Charles| title = Contributions to the Physiology of Vision.—Part the First. On some remarkable, and hitherto unobserved, Phenomena of Binocular Vision| journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London| volume = 128| pages = 371–394| publisher = Royal Society of London| date = June 21, 1838| url = http://www.stereoscopy.com/library/wheatstone-paper1838.html| accessdate = 2008-02-13| doi = 10.1098/rstl.1838.0019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = stereoscope&gt;{{cite web| last = Klein | first = Alexander | title = Sir Charles Wheatstone| publisher = Stereoscopy.com| url = http://www.stereoscopy.com/faq/wheatstone.html| accessdate = 2006-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the erotic images. This technology produced a type of [[three-dimensional space|three dimensional]] view that suited erotic images quite well. Although thousands of erotic daguerreotypes were created, only around 800 are known to survive; however, their uniqueness and expense meant that they were once the toys of rich men. Due to their rarity, the works can sell for more than ₤GB 10,000.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;
=== The calotype process ===
In 1841, [[William Fox Talbot]] patented the [[calotype]] process, the first negative-positive process, making possible multiple copies.&lt;ref name=glasgow&gt;{{cite web|last=Schaaf |first=Larry |title=The Calotype Process |publisher=Glasgow University Library |year=1999 |url=http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/hillandadamson/calo.html |accessdate=2006-08-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619221733/http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/hillandadamson/calo.html |archivedate=2006-06-19 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This invention permitted an almost limitless number of prints to be produced from a glass negative. The technology also reduced the exposure time and made possible a true mass market for low cost commercial photography. The technology was immediately employed to reproduce nude portraits, classified by the standards of the time as pornographic. Paris soon became the centre of this trade. In 1848 only thirteen photography studios existed in Paris; by 1860, there were over 400. Most of them made income from the sale of illicit nude images to the masses who could now afford it. The pictures were also sold near [[train station]]s, by traveling salesmen and women in the streets who hid them under their dresses. They were often produced in sets (of four, eight or twelve), and exported internationally, mainly to England and the United States. Both the models and the photographers were commonly from the working class, and the artistic model excuse was increasingly hard to use. By 1855, no more photographic nudes were being registered as académie, and the business had gone underground to escape prosecution.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;
=== The Victorian tradition ===
The Victorian pornographic tradition in Britain had three main elements: French photographs, erotic prints (sold in shops in Holywell Street, a long vanished London thoroughfare, swept away by the [[Aldwych]]), and printed literature. The ability to reproduce photographs in bulk assisted the rise of a new business individual, the porn dealer. Many of these dealers used the [[postal system]] to distribute erotic photography, sending the photographic cards to subscribers in plain wrappings. Victorian pornography had several defining characteristics. It reflected a very mechanistic view of the [[human anatomy]] and its functions. Science, the new obsession, was invoked to ostensibly study the nude human body. Consequently, the sexuality of the subject is often depersonalised, and is without any passion or tenderness. At this time, it also became popular to depict nude photographs of women of exotic ethnicities, under the umbrella of science. 
[[File:Female nude motion study by Eadweard Muybridge.jpg|thumb|400 px|[[Eadweard Muybridge]]: Woman walking with fishing pole (detail)]]
Studies of this type can be found in the work of [[Eadweard Muybridge]]. Although he photographed both men and women, the women were often given [[theatrical property|props]] like market baskets and fishing poles, making the images of women thinly disguised erotica.&lt;ref name = history /&gt; 

Parallel to the British printing history, photographers and printers in France frequently turned to the medium of [[postcard]]s, producing great numbers of them. Such cards came to be known in the US as "[[French postcard]]s".&lt;ref&gt;''The Color of Words: An Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Ethnic Bias in the United States'', Philip Herbst. Intercultural Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-1877864421}}. p.86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==French influence==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The initial appearance of [[picture postcard]]s (and the enthusiasm with which the new medium was embraced) raised some legal issues that can be seen as precursors to later controversies over the Internet. Picture postcards allowed and encouraged many individuals to send images across national borders, and the legal availability of a postcard image in one country did not guarantee that the card would be considered "proper" in the destination country, or in the intermediate countries that the card would have to pass through. Some countries refused to handle postcards containing sexual references (such as of seaside scenes) or images of full or partial nudity (including images of classical statuary or paintings). Many [[French postcard]]s featured naked women in erotic poses. These were described as postcards but whose primary purpose was not for sending by post because they would have been banned from delivery. Street dealers, tobacco shops, and a variety of other vendors bought the photographs for resale to tourists. The sale of erotica was banned, and many of these postcards were sold "under the counter".

Instead, nude and erotic photographs were marketed in a monthly magazine called ''La Beauté'' that was ostensibly targeted for artists looking for poses. Each issue contained 75 nude images which could be ordered by mail, in the form of postcards, hand-tinted or sepia toned.

==Early 20th century==
&lt;gallery class="center"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The early 1900s saw several important improvements in camera design, including the 1913 invention of the 35&amp;nbsp;mm or "candid" camera by [[Oskar Barnack]] of the [[Ernst Leitz]] company. The [[Ur-Leica]] was a compact camera based on the idea of reducing the format of negatives and enlarging them later, after they had been exposed. This small, portable device made nude photography in secluded parks and other semi-public places easier, and represented a great advance for amateur erotica. Artists were enamored with their new ability to take impromptu photos without carrying around a clunky apparatus.

Early 20th century artist [[E. J. Bellocq]], who made his best known images with the older style glass plate negatives, is best remembered for his down-to-earth pictures of prostitutes in domestic settings in the [[Storyville, New Orleans|Storyville]] red light district of [[New Orleans]]. In contrast to the usual pictures of women awkwardly posed amid drapery, veils, flowers, fruit, classical columns and oriental braziers, Bellocq's sitters appear relaxed and comfortable. David Steinberg speculates that the prostitutes may have felt at ease with Bellocq because he was "so much of a fellow outcast."

Other photographers of nude women of this period include [[Alexandre-Jacques Chantron]], [[Jean Agélou]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alfred Cheney Johnston]]. Chantron was already an established painter before experimenting with photography,&lt;ref name="JS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.19thcenturypaintings.com/artist_biography.asp?artistID=88 |title=Alexandre-Jacques Chantron (1842 – 1918) |accessdate=2012-10-07 |work=Julian Simon Fine Art |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704193050/http://www.19thcenturypaintings.com/artist_biography.asp?artistID=88 |archivedate=2012-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Agélou and Johnston made their career in photography.

[[Julian Mandel]] (possibly a [[pseudonym]]) became known in the 1920s and 1930s for his exceptional photographs of the female form. Participating in the German "new age outdoor movement," Mandel took numerous pictures in natural settings, publishing them through the Paris-based studios of Alfred Noyer and P-C Paris,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tallulahs.com/collectors1b.html |title=Tallulahs Classical Nude Poses;  Classical Nude Poses of Julian Mandel |accessdate=2006-10-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716071250/http://www.tallulahs.com/collectors1b.html |archivedate=2006-07-16 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Les Studios and the Neue Photographische Gesellschaft. The models often are found in highly arranged classical poses, photographed both in-studio and outdoors. The images are composed artfully, with exquisite tones and soft use of lighting—showing a particular texture created by light rather than shadow.&lt;ref name=bigkugels&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bigkugels.com/content/FemaleNudes.html#Arundel | title=Vintage Female Nude Photography from BigKugels.com | accessdate=2006-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another noteworthy photographer of the first two decades of the 20th century was the [[naturist]] photographer [[Arundel Holmes Nicholls]] (1923-2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://papericons.com/nicholls/index.html|title=Arundel Holmes Nicholls|publisher=papericons.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work, featured in the archives of the [[Kinsey Institute]], is artistically composed, often giving an iridescent glow to his figures.&lt;ref name=bigkugels /&gt; Following in Mandel's footsteps, Nicholls favored outdoor shots.

Many photographs from this era were intentionally damaged. Bellocq, for instance, frequently scratched out the faces of his sitters to obscure their identities. Some of his other sitters were photographed wearing masks. Peter Marshall writes, "Even in the relatively bohemian atmosphere of Carmel, California in the 1920s and '30s, [[Edward Weston]] had to photograph many of his models without showing their faces, and some 75 years on, many communities are less open about such things than Carmel was then."&lt;ref name="about3"&gt;{{cite web

==Later 20th century==
Nude photographers of the mid-20th century include Walter Bird, [[John Everard (photographer)|John Everard]], [[Horace Roye]], [[Harrison Marks]] and [[Zoltán Glass]]. Roye's photograph ''[[:File:Tomorrow's crucifixion.jpg|Tomorrow's Crucifixion]],'' depicting a model wearing a [[gas mask]] while on a [[crucifix]] caused much controversy when published in the English Press in 1938. The image is now considered one of the major pre-war photographs of the 20th century.
=== The Second World War ===
During the [[Second World War]], [[pin-up girl]] photographs reached a wide audience. Unlike earlier erotic photographs, whose subjects were usually anonymous, a number of well-known [[film star]]s posed for pin-up photographs and they were promoted as sex symbols. The emphasis was initially on bare legs, short skirts or swim suits and shapely figures; but in the 1950s such photos started to show naked breasts. 
=== ''Playboy'' and ''Penthouse'' ===
''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, founded in 1953, achieved great popularity and soon established the market for men's and lifestyle magazines. Erotic photography soon became closely associated with it and gained increasing public attention. 

Founded in 1965, [[Penthouse (magazine)|''Penthouse'' magazine]] went a step further than ''Playboy'' and was the first to clearly display genitals, initially covered with [[pubic hair]]. The models looked usually directly into the camera, as if they would enter into relationship with the mostly male viewers. 
=== ''Cleo'' and male nude ===
In the 1970s, in the mood of feminism, gender equality and light humour, magazines such as [[Cleo (magazine)|''Cleo'']] included male nude centrefolds. 

Unlike the traditional erotic photographs, which use any attractive female subjects, the male nude photographs are usually of celebrities.
=== Internet ===
The spread of the Internet in the 1990s and increasing social liberalization brought a renewed upsurge of erotic photography. There are a variety of print and online publications, which now compete against the major magazines (''Playboy'', ''Penthouse'') and cater for the diverse tastes.&lt;ref name="Girlie"&gt;Mark Gabor: ''The Illustrated History of Girlie Magazines''. Random House, New York 1984. {{ISBN|0-517-54997-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a large number of online erotic photography sites, some of which describe themselves or are so described by others as [[pornography]]. Where the subject is presented in a romantic or sexually alluring manner, it may be described as [[glamour photography]].

'''''Family Guy''''' is an American animated comedy [[Media franchise|franchise]] created by [[Seth MacFarlane]] and originally developed for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]].

==TV show==
{{main|Family Guy}}
''Family Guy'' is an American [[animated sitcom]] created by [[Seth MacFarlane]] for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]. The series centers on the [[Griffin family|Griffins]], a family consisting of parents [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] and [[Lois Griffin|Lois]]; their children, [[Meg Griffin|Meg]], [[Chris Griffin|Chris]], and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]]; and their [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] pet dog, [[Brian Griffin|Brian]]. The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, [[Rhode Island]], and exhibits much of its humor in the form of [[metafictional]] [[cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaway gags]] that often lampoon [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].

The family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films, [[The Life of Larry and Larry &amp; Steve|''The Life of Larry'' and ''Larry &amp; Steve'']]. MacFarlane redesigned the films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and Brian, respectively. MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox in 1998, and the show was greenlit and began production. Shortly after the third season of ''Family Guy'' had aired in 2002, Fox canceled the series with [[When You Wish Upon a Weinstein|one episode]] left unaired. [[Adult Swim]] [[Burning off|aired]] that episode in 2003, finishing the series' original run. However, favorable DVD sales and high [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] for syndicated reruns on Adult Swim convinced the network to renew the show in 2004 for a fourth season, which began airing on May 1, 2005.

===Spin-off===
{{Main|The Cleveland Show}}
MacFarlane co-created—alongside [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]] and [[Richard Appel]]—the ''Family Guy'' spin-off ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'', which premiered September 27, 2009. They began discussing the project in 2007.&lt;ref name= futcri&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20090615fox01 |title=FOX Announces Fall Premiere Dates For The 2009–2010 Season |work=The Futon Critic |date=June 15, 2009|accessdate=April 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxflash.com/div.php/main/page?aID=1z2z2z252z1z2 |title=Fox Primetime&amp;nbsp;— The Cleveland Show&amp;nbsp;— Fact Sheet |work=Fox Flash |accessdate=April 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117131748/http://foxflash.com/div.php/main/page?aID=1z2z2z252z1z2 |archivedate=January 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Appel and Henry served as the show's executive producers and showrunners, handling the day-to-day operations, with limited involvement from MacFarlane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fox seeks a new hit, this time in Cleveland&amp;nbsp;— Seth MacFarlane gives sneak preview of 2009's Family Guy spinoff|date=November 30, 2008|work=The Toronto Star|author=Itzkoff, Dave|page=E12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry and Appel conceived the show as "more of a family show, a sweeter show" than ''Family Guy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A sweeter family guy&amp;nbsp;— comedy|work=The Age |location=Australia|date=December 17, 2009|author=Idato, Michael|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first season consisted of 22 episodes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2008/11/the-family-guy.html |title=Fox orders full season of 'Family Guy' spin-off |publisher=Time Warner |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=November 10, 2008 |first=Lynette |last=Rice |accessdate=February 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222182949/http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2008/11/the-family-guy.html |archivedate=February 22, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the show was picked up by Fox for a second season, which consisted of 13 episodes.

[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] canceled ''The Cleveland Show'' on May 13, 2013, roughly a week before the May 19 conclusion of its [[The Cleveland Show (season 4)|fourth season]].&lt;ref name="cancel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/24-returns-fox-fall-article-1.1342450?pgno=1|title=Fox announces 2013–14 fall schedule, which includes return of Kiefer Sutherland's '24'|last=Hinckley|first=David|date=May 13, 2013|work=[[NY Daily News]]|accessdate=June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 16, 2013, MacFarlane confirmed an upcoming [[Family Guy (season 12)|twelfth season]] episode of ''Family Guy'' centering on Cleveland's return to Quahog.&lt;ref name="confirmedtweet"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/SethMacFarlane/status/355853090517286912 |title=Twitter / SethMacFarlane: RT @spartygirl8356: |publisher=Twitter.com |accessdate=July 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crossovers with other series===
An event known as "[[Night of the Hurricane]]" depicts a hurricane hitting  the hometowns of MacFarlane's sitcoms ''Family Guy'', ''[[American Dad!]]'' and ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'', culminating in a stand-off among the three fathers of each family.

It was announced that a special episode of ''Family Guy'' featuring an official crossover with ''The Simpsons'' would premiere in 2014. At [[San Diego Comic Con]] a 5-minute preview was shown. The episode, titled "[[The Simpsons Guy]]", was aired September 28, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Snierson|first=Dan|title='The Simpsons,' 'Family Guy' doing crossover episode|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/07/18/simpsons-family-guy-crossover-episode/|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=July 18, 2013|accessdate=July 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Live performances===
As promotion for the show, and, as Newman described, "[to] expand interest in the show beyond its diehard fans",&lt;ref name="VarietyLive!"/&gt; Fox organized four ''Family Guy Live!'' performances, which featured cast members reading old episodes aloud. The cast also performed musical numbers from the ''[[Family Guy: Live in Vegas]]'' comedy album.&lt;ref name="VarietyLive!"&gt;{{cite news|title=Family Guy Center Stage|work=Variety|date=March 10, 2005|author=Adalian, Josef|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stage shows were an extension of a performance by the cast during the 2004 [[Montreal Comedy Festival]].&lt;ref name="VarietyLive!"/&gt; The ''Family Guy Live!'' performances, which took place in Los Angeles and New York, sold out and were attended by around 1,200 people each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,155143,00.html|author=Associated Press|title='Family Guy' Returns to FOX|publisher=Fox News|date=April 30, 2005|accessdate=July 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, at the [[59th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards]], MacFarlane performed (as the digitally inserted Stewie and Brian) the ceremony's opening number. He performed a song insulting modern television to the tune of the song "The Fellas At The Freakin' F.C.C." performed in the episode ''[[PTV (Family Guy)|PTV]]''. The song insulted TV shows such as ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'', ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'', and ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', as well as the [[Made in America (The Sopranos)|final scene]] of ''[[The Sopranos]]''.

In 2009, a special televised performance show aired entitled ''Family Guy Presents Seth &amp; Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show'', in which voice actors [[Alex Borstein]] and MacFarlane performed songs from the show, as well as a parody of [[Lady Gaga]]'s song "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]" in the voice of [[Marlee Matlin]], who appeared on stage as a guest during the performance. Some new animated gags also appeared in the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tucker |first=Ken |url=http://watching-tv.ew.com/2009/11/08/seth-macfarlane-comedy-show |title=Family Guy Presents Seth &amp; Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show': Almost pretty funny |work=Entertainment Weekly  |date=January 24, 2011 |accessdate=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''filmi-ghazal''' is a genre of [[filmi]] based on [[ghazal]] poetry in [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], used in [[Indian film]]s, especially [[Hindi cinema]] (Bollywood). The filmi-ghazals retain the couplet format and rhyme scheme similar to that in ghazals. However, instead of vocal or instrumental passages as interludes, the filmi-ghazal usually uses precomposed musical pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dXFBAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=filmi%20ghazal&amp;pg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;q=filmi%20ghazal&amp;f=false | title=More Than Bollywood: Studies in Indian Popular Music | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Gregory D.

'''Firemonkeys Studios''' is a [[video game developer|developer]] and [[video game publisher|publisher]] of [[video game]]s, based in [[Melbourne, Australia]]. In May 2011, [[Electronic Arts]] announced the acquisition of Firemint for an undisclosed sum, making it an in-house studio for EA Interactive. IronMonkey Studios were also taken under EA Interactive's wing back in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/small-business/startup/hightech-aussie-lands-multimilliondollar-deal-20110504-1e7vd.html/ |title=High-tech Aussie lands multimillion-dollar deal  |date=4 May 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-04 |publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |first=Asher |last=Moses }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, Firemint acquired fellow Australian video game developer [[Infinite Interactive]], best known for the ''[[Puzzle Quest]]'' series. In July 2012, Firemint announced a post on their blog that Firemint would merge with IronMonkey Studios by EA and merge their names into Firemonkeys. All-new games, including ''[[Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2012 video game)|Need for Speed: Most Wanted]]'' and ''[[Real Racing 3]]'', are released with the new company name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://firemint.com/2012/announcing-firemonkeys/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730014013/http://firemint.com/2012/announcing-firemonkeys/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 July 2012 |title=IronMonkey and Firemint become Firemonkeys |date=24 July 2012 |accessdate=2013-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
 [[File:Firemint.gif|thumb|right|Former logo as Firemint]]
Firemint was awarded the Arts and Entertainment Award for being amongst the most successful exporters in 2009 at the Australian Export Awards in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Firemint Wins Australian Export Award|url=http://www.austrade.gov.au/Firemint-Wins-Australian-Export-Award/default.aspx|work=Austrade Media Release}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Games==
Firemint have produced a number of different games for different platforms and different publisher. Starting with the ''[[Nicktoons Racing]]'' in 2002 for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. For several years after publishing their debut game Firemint continued to produce and release games for the Game Boy Advance and mobile devices. It wasn’t until early 2008, however, with the release of the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iPhone]] in 2007 did Firemint really expand their games market share. During 2009, Firemint developed their two most popular games, ''Flight Control'' and ''Real Racing''. These games went on to achieve great success with the subsequent release of two sequels each, ''Flight Control HD'' in 2010, ''Flight Control Rocket'' in 2012, ''[[Real Racing 2]]'' was released in 2010 and ''[[Real Racing 3]]'' in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firemint.com/projects.htm firemint projects]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquisition==
Electronic Arts, with a market capitalization of US$6.7 billion, announced the acquisition of Melbourne-based gaming studio Firemint overnight in a press release for an undisclosed amount. Firemint is recognised as one of the leading game developers on the [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] platform. According to Barry Cottle, General Manager of EA Interactive “The Firemint team is remarkable for its critical and commercial success. Having them as part of EAi will accelerate our position as worldwide leader in game development for mobile devices and online gaming platforms." In January, Murray told SmartCompany the work-for-hire market is growing thin, especially as the Australian dollar continues to climb. Coming under the EA banner will give the company security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smartcompany.com.au/buy-or-sell-a-business/20110504-melbourne-game-studio-firemint-acquired-by-electronic-arts.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414042451/http://www.smartcompany.com.au/buy-or-sell-a-business/20110504-melbourne-game-studio-firemint-acquired-by-electronic-arts.html |archivedate=14 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Giambattista Andreini''' (9 February 1576 – 7 June 1654) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[actor]] and the most important Italian [[playwright]] of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder 2007, pp. 37–38; {{cite book |title=Starší divadlo v českých zemích do konce 18. století |last=Jakubcová |first=Alena |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=Academia |location=Prague |isbn=978-80-200-1486-3 |page=19 |pages= |url= |language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Born in [[Florence]] to stage stars [[Isabella Andreini]] and [[Francesco Andreini]], he had a great success as a [[comedian]] in Paris under the name of Leylio.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} He was a favourite with [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]], and also with the public, especially as the young lover.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

His wife [[Virginia Ramponi-Andreini]], whom he married in 1601, was also a celebrated actress and singer.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder 2007, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==

He left a number of plays full of extravagant imagination. The best known are ''L'Adamo'' (Milan, 1613),'' The Penitent Magdalene'' (Mantua, 1617), and ''The Centaur'' (Paris, 1622).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} From the first of these three volumes, which are extremely rare, Italians have often asserted that [[John Milton|Milton]], travelling at that time in their country, took the idea of ''[[Paradise Lost]]''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

[[File:Lelio and Florinda by Minaggio tavola 106.jpg|thumb|This image of ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'' actors from ''[[The Feather Book of Dionisio Minaggio]]'' is thought to depict Andreini as "Lelio" and his wife [[Virginia Ramponi-Andreini]] as "Florinda".&lt;ref&gt;Katritzky 2006, p. 244. &lt;/ref&gt;]]

This is a '''list of jazz and popular music terms''' that are likely to be encountered in printed popular music [[songbook]]s, [[fake book]]s and vocal scores, [[big band]] scores, [[jazz]], and [[rock and roll|rock]] concert reviews, and album liner notes. This glossary includes terms for musical instruments, playing or singing techniques, [[instrument amplifier|amplifier]]s, [[effects units]], [[sound reinforcement]] equipment, and recording gear and techniques which are widely used in jazz and popular music. Most of the terms are in English, but in some cases, terms from other languages are encountered (e.g. to do an "encore", which is a French term).

''' as is'''
: A jazz term which instructs the performer to play the noted pitches as they are printed. Parts for jazz musicians in [[big band]]s often consist of lengthy sections of empty bars labelled with the changing time signatures and chord changes. Rhythm section members improvise an accompaniment (see [[#C|Comp]]), and lead instruments improvise solos. In sections where the jazz arranger wants the performers to read notated pitches rather than improvise, they indicate this with the notation "as is".
''' axe'''
: A slang term which refers to an electric guitar, or, by extension, to any instrument (e.g. a bandleader may tell a saxophone player to "get your axe").

: A subwoofer cabinet that reproduces very low-frequency sounds, usually with some type of horn or transmission line system to enhance the bass response; typically used for the main, Front of House speaker system, but in rare cases, may also be used as part of a bass player's bass amplifier set-up. The term "bin" was more common in the 1980s; in the 1990s and 2000s, the term "subwoofer" or "sub" is much more widely used.
''' [[Binary form|binary]]'''
: A musical form in two sections: AB
''' bird's eye'''
: A slang term for ''fermata'', which instructs the performer to hold a note or chord as long as they wish
''' bleeding, bleed, or bleed-through'''
: A slang term which refers to the ambient sounds that a microphone aimed at instrument A picks up from other instruments or singers in the same room. In some cases, "bleeding" is considered undesirable, if unwanted sounds from other instruments are picked up by a microphone. For example, if a guitar player plays an amazing solo during a recording, it may end up being unusable if mistakes by the drummer—20 feet away—are bleeding through into the mic in front of the guitar amp. To prevent "bleeding", studios use isolation booths and cloth-covered room dividers. In some cases, "bleed-through" is desirable, because it makes the recording sound fuller or more "live".
''' block chords'''
: A style of piano playing, developed by Milt Buckner and George Shearing, with both hands 'locked' together, playing chords in parallel with the melody, usually in fairly close position. It is a technical procedure requiring much practice, and can sound dated if the harmonies are not advanced enough. Also called locked hands.
''' blow'''
: A jazz term instructing a performer to improvise a solo over the chord progression of a jazz tune; may also be written "blowing section" or, in [[free jazz]], "open blowing"
[[File:Yamaha MC2403 audio mixing console (1992).jpg|thumb|360px|Yamaha 2403 audio mixing console in a 'live' mixing application. Each column of knobs controls the volume, tone, and other elements for a single channel (e.g. a microphone being used by a singer).]]
''' blues'''
: In a jazz context, when "blues" or "solo on blues" appears at the start of a solo section, it is an abbreviation for "blues progression"; it instructs the performer to improvise solos over a 12-bar [[blues progression]] based on I, IV, and V7 chords.
''' board'''
: A shortened form of "[[mixing board]]", which refers to the audio mixing board used by live sound engineers and studio engineers to control the volume and tone of different instruments and voices, blend them in the desired proportions, add external effects (e.g. reverb), and route the final signal (or an intermediate signal) to desired locations (e.g. to a recording device; to Front of House speakers; to monitor speakers, etc.). The term "board" may also be used as a shortened form of "fingerboard".
''' break'''
: Transitional passage in which a soloist plays unaccompanied.
''' bridge'''
: Transitional passage connecting sections of a composition. A "bridge" is sometimes referred to as "the middle eight" and is often employed to introduce variation to songs or chord progressions which lack enough variety to keep the listener engaged. Secondly; a "bridge" refers to the part of a stringed instrument that holds the strings in place and transmits their vibrations to the resonant body of the instrument as well as being the terminus of a string's vibrational length. The other vibrational terminus is often referred to as the "nut" which is often made from bone, hard plastic or bronze and located at the end of the fingerboard near the "head" and tuning keys.
''' broken chord'''
: A [[chord (music)|chord]] in which the notes are not all played at once, but rather one after the other (i.e. an arpeggio).

==C==
''' cabinet (cab)'''
: A speaker cabinet, which is a wooden (or sometimes plastic) enclosure for a loudspeaker and, in some cases a horn or tweeter. Speaker cabinets are used to amplify instruments and vocals.
''' cadence'''
: The point at which a melodic phrase "comes to rest" or resolves. A cadence often occurs on the "tonic" note (supported by the tonic chord—the "home chord" of the key). A cadence can also occur on other notes over the "tonic" chord, or over another chord such as the "dominant chord" (the chord built on the fifth scale degree). One of the features of Classical music is that cadences are often ''elided''; that is, instead of coming to rest at the cadence, a new musical line commences at exactly the same time of the cadence. This helps to create a forward momentum in the music
''' call and response'''
: A way of writing a song in which after a singer sings a line, other singers (e.g. backup singers or band members) respond with a line that completes the thought. Call and response singing was originally part of African-American work songs, and it subsequently became an important part of the blues.
''' capo'''
: A clip-on metal or plastic device with a rubber-padded bar which holds down all six strings of the guitar in a fret position selected by the performer. It is attached with an elastic or spring-loaded mechanism. It allows a guitar player to have the open strings start at a higher pitch, thus facilitating the transposition of songs and the use of the "ringing", rich sound of open chords in unusual keys.
''' changes'''
: A jazz term which is an abbreviation for "chord changes", which is the harmonic progression (or "chord progression") upon which a melody is based.
''' channel'''
: In the context of a [[mixing board]], a channel is one of the input sections into which a microphone or output from an instrument amplifier or instrument (e.g. an electronic keyboard) is plugged so that its volume and tone can be altered and so that it can be blended with other instruments and voices; in the context of an electric guitar amplifier or a bass amplifier, the term "channel" is used to refer to amplifiers which have two or more separate preamplifier, equalization, and effect settings ("channels") which a performer can switch between in a performance via a footswitch.
'''chicken pickin''''
: A colloquial expression describing a particular touch and style of electric guitar playing usually using a "clean" amp tone and employing a percussive or sharp attack, which when combined with alternating short and longer notes effectively, is meant to emulate the clucking and squawking of a chicken, thereby providing an unmistakable rural element. Sometimes played without a guitar pick, it is best voiced on the Fender Telecaster guitar or similar "thinner" instruments with single coil pickups. It has become a standard color and flavor within traditional American "country" music particularly from the 1960's and 70's. It is virtually never used outside of 'hard' country music.

''' chops'''
: A slang term which refers to a player's strong technique or endurance ("That alto sax player has great chops; she can play for hours.")
''' [[chord (music)|chord]]'''
: A group of three or more notes that, when played simultaneously, can form a harmonic structure that can support a melody or a solo line. The simplest chords are triads, which are made of the first note of a scale and then alternate notes. For example, in the scale of C Major (C,D,E,F,G,A B,C), the triad would be C,E,G. Seventh chords use four notes: they consist of a triad with an added interval. For example, in the scale of G Dominant (G,A,B,C,D,E,F,G), the four-note seventh chord would be G,B,D,F. There are also more complicated chords which add additional intervals (see [[ninth chord]], "alt dom"). A chord can also be played one note at a time (see "arpeggio" and "broken chord").
''' chorus'''
: 1. The refrain of a song which is repeated a number of times, in alternation with verses and other sections (e.g. a guitar solo). In contrast to the verses of a song, the chorus tends to be simpler and more memorable, and it often uses more repetition of lyrics (e.g. "She loves you yeah, yeah, yeah...").
(Note to sheet music fans; in the early 20th century into the 1940's the term "chorus" was often used for what is currently defined as the "intro", sung only once at the top. As an example from later in 1966; the three measure introduction to the P. McCartney song "Here, There and Everywhere"... "to lead a better life" etc., would have been the 'chorus' to many or most publishers.) 

2. The term "chorus" may also be a synonym for "choir"—a group of singers; (Note that in the early 20th century into the 1940's the term "chorus" was often used for what in the 21st century is defined as the "intro", sung only once at the top.
As an example from 1966; the three measure introduction to the P. McCartney song "Here, There and Everywhere", i.e., "to lead a better life" etc., would have been the 'chorus' to many or most publishers.)

3.It may refer to a [[chorus effect]]—the sound created when a voice or instrumental tone is doubled by other pitches which are not exactly the same, which creates a rich, shimmering sound.



''' [[chromatic scale]]'''
: A sequence of all twelve notes in an octave, played in a row (either ascending or descending). Fragments of the chromatic scale are used in many styles of popular music, but more extensive use of chromatic scale tends to occur in jazz, fusion, and the more experimental genres of rock.
''' clam'''
: A slang term which refers to a mis-played or out of tune note, often by a horn player, but even more often and more regrettably by a too-loud guitar player.
''' clean'''
: In reference to the sound of an electric guitar, Fender Rhodes electric piano, or other electric or electronic instrument, or to a recording of a singer or instrument or to an entire mix, "clean" means that the sound is undistorted and not muddy. For an electric instrument, the opposite of a "clean" tone is an overdriven, "clipped" (see "clipping"), or "dirty" sound.
''' clean channel'''
: Many electric guitar amplifiers have two "channels": a clean channel, which is undistorted, and an "overdrive" (or "dirty" channel), in which the signal is heavily preamplified or run through a distortion effect, thus producing a distorted signal. Amps with two channels come with a footswitch which allows the performer to switch between the two channels.
''' clipping'''
: A synonym for distortion. With vocals, mic'd acoustic instruments, Front of House mixes, and monitor mixes, clipping is almost always deemed to be undesirable, and it is minimized by reducing gain levels, using compression devices, adding "pads" (attenuation circuits), etc. With electric guitars, electric basses, Hammond organs, electric piano, and other electric instruments, performers often purposefully add clipping to the signal by boosting the gain or using an overdrive pedal.
[[File:Roland VK-7.JPG|thumb|300px|The Roland VK-7 is referred to as a "clonewheel organ", because it recreates the sound of vintage tonewheel organs like the Hammond organ.]]
''' clonewheel or [[clonewheel organ]]'''
: An electronic or digital instrument which recreates or imitates the sound of a [[tonewheel]]-based [[Hammond organ]], typically in an instrument that is much lighter and smaller than an actual Hammond organ (e.g. the [[Roland VK-7]] or the [[Korg CX-3]]).
''' [[coda (music)|coda]]'''
: A tail (i.e. a closing section appended to a piece of music). Also called a "tag" or "outro".
'''colosseum ending'''
: An expression originating from electric guitar-based rock bands describing a dramatic and dynamic performance effect, specifically, a loud ending used by rock bands when playing in large outdoor venues or similar large shows. Occurring on or after the last chord of a song, typically it's 4-10+ seconds of loud sustained chord(s) often with many drum fills with improvisation or activity from others to create a steady, rumbling or churning effect. Similar dynamic finales are found throughout symphonic music intended to create excitement and rouse the audience to massive applause and ovation.
''' combo'''
: An abbreviation for "combination", which is used in two senses in jazz and pop music. "Combo" can be the equivalent of "group" or "ensemble" (e.g. "a jazz combo"). As well, "combo" refers to a "combination amplifier", so named because it includes an amplifier and a speaker in a single cabinet.
''' comp'''
: A jazz term which instructs a jazz [[rhythm section]] performer (usually a chordal instrument such as [[jazz guitar]], [[jazz piano]], [[Hammond organ]], etc.) to play accompaniment chords. In a recording context, the term is an abbreviation for "composite", which refers to recording composite [[Audio channel|tracks]].
''' comp tickets'''
: An abbreviation for "complimentary tickets", which promoters give out to ensure that a concert will have a good-sized crowd; as well band members and touring staff may be given comp tickets that they can give to friends or family, as a "perk"
''' compressor'''
: An electronic audio effect which automatically reduces the gain of a signal (vocals, instruments, etc.) to a pre-set threshold, thus preventing unwanted peaks which could cause clipping. A compressor with extreme settings becomes a limiter, which protects speakers and horns from peaks.
''' [[Condenser microphone]] or condenser mic'''
: A microphone that uses the technique of "variable capacitance" to pick up sound. The diaphragm is on a charged metal plate, and as such, condenser microphones need power to operate. The power comes either from batteries or from a mic preamp or a mixing board. The power that is provided from a preamp or mixing board is called "[[phantom power]]".
''' cover or cover tune'''
: When a band plays a song that has been composed and recorded by another band, this is called a "cover tune"; also used as a verb (e.g. "to cover" a song by a certain band). The term may also refer to a [[cover charge]], the door fee charged to customers for admission to a band's performance at a bar (the cover charge may go entirely to the band or it may be split with the bar, based on the agreement between the band and the establishment).
''' crossfader'''
: On a DJ mixer, a crossfader is a control that slides on a left-to-right track. It allows a DJ to alternate between two channels, into which an audio input is plugged (e.g. a record player, CD player, iPod, etc.). The left-most position of the slider control gives only Channel A. The right-most position gives only Channel B. The area of the sliding track between these two extremes is a blend of the two Channels. Crossfaders can be used to create smooth transitions between two songs on different sound inputs, or, when moved rapidly at the same time that a record is manipulated on a turntable, they can be used in create rhythmic [[scratching]] sounds and effects.
''' crossover'''
: In a music industry context, a "crossover artist" or "crossover band" is a performer or group from one style that has managed to garner a following amongst fans of a different musical style. For example, some country performers have managed to get "crossover" hits in the pop charts. In an audio engineering context, a crossover is a frequency filter system that divides the frequencies in a signal into low and high or low, mid, and high components. In this way, the different frequencies can be routed to the appropriate speakers.
''' crunch'''
: Used to describe a specific type of highly distorted, mid-boosted electric guitar tone used in [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[thrash metal]] music, typically by the rhythm guitarist. When played with palm muting, it creates a characteristic heavy rhythmic sound.
''' [[cut time]]'''
: Same as the [[meter (music)|meter]] 2/2: two half-note (minim) beats per measure. Notated and executed like [[common time]] (4/4), except with the beat lengths doubled. Indicated by three-quarters of a circle with a vertical line through it, which resembles the cent symbol ''¢''. This comes from a literal cut of the ''C'' symbol of [[common time]]. Thus, a [[quarter note]] in cut time is only half a beat long, and a measure has only two beats. See also [[alla breve]].

==D==
''' dead'''
: An adjective that means non-reverberant, as in the case of a room in a recording studio that has very little natural reverb or ambience (e.g. a "dead room"). To "liven up" the sound of a track recorded in a "dead room", engineers will typically add electronic reverb effects. Alternately, the track could be re-recorded in a room with more reflective surfaces, to add natural reverb.
''' Decibel (dB)'''
: The unit of measurement of audio level used in recording studios and by live sound engineers. Some cities and performance venues have decibel limits for live performances.
''' desk'''
: British term for a "mixing board".
''' DI or DI Box'''
: An electronic device which alters the impedance of electric instrument signals (e.g. electric guitar, electric bass) so that they can be plugged into a mixing board or PA system. The DI box converts a high-impedance, unbalanced signal from an electric guitar into a low-impedance, balanced signal. Many DI boxes have a [[ground lift]] switch to remove AC hum from the electrical system.
''' Digital Signal Processing (DSP)'''
: The use of digital effects to alter the tone, sound, pitch, or other parameters of a signal. Many 2000s-era mixers, guitar amplifiers, and electronic keyboards have on-board DSP effects.
''' downtuned or detuned'''
: A guitar or bass that is tuned to a lower pitch than the standard tuning, which is (from low to high) EADGBE for guitar and EADG for bass.
'''dragging'''
: A term used to describe the undesirable act of playing too slow in relation to the existing tempo when no decrease in tempo is called for. The opposite of "rushing". Not to be confused with intentionally or acceptably playing "behind" the beat while keeping the tempo or BPM (Beats per minute) steady.
''' drive'''
: An abbreviated form of "overdrive", which refers to the distortion that occurs when a tube amplifier is pushed to its limits.
''' drop'''
: Jazz term referring to a note that slides chromatically downwards to an indefinite pitch .
''' DSP'''
: See "Digital Signal Processing".
''' dry'''
: A signal that has no reverb effect, or more generally, a signal that has not been processed with any effects unit. Vocals are almost always recorded "dry", and then the reverb or other effects are added in post-production. Electric guitars and electric keyboards are often, but not always recorded with their effects (distortion, chorus, etc.) already added.
''' [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]]'''
: The relative volumes in the execution of a piece of music

==E==
'''ear candy'''
:An expression used subjectively (sometimes derisively) to describe audio effects or instrumental parts or tracks which might be considered as non-essential to the core arrangement or composition, but instead add sonic elements such as; "sparkle", "shimmer", "depth" etc., to a recording or mix. Ear candy is often considered acceptable or even desirable within some 'popular' music productions, but is rarely heard within more "roots-based" musics such as blues, bluegrass and other styles relying more strictly on a live musical performance, as opposed styles utilizing complex production values and electronic effects etc.
[[File:Ts9-stompbox.jpg|thumb|150px|The Ibanez Tube Screamer overdrive pedal, an effects unit with a footswitch to turn the effect on and off]]
''' [[effects unit]]'''
: An electronic device which alters or conditions the sound qualities in an electronic signal from a microphone, musical instrument, or recording.

''' [[falsetto]]'''
: Male voice above usual bass or tenor range (see article)
''' feedback'''
: The resonance loop created when a microphone or guitar pickup is placed close to a highly amplified speaker, often creating a howling or screeching sound. In most cases, musicians and sound engineers seek to avoid feedback with microphones and acoustic instruments; with electric guitar, especially in heavy metal and shred guitar playing it may be done on purpose.
''' fiddle'''
: A slang term for a violin in bluegrass, country music, and folk music.
''' [[Fill (music)|fill]] (English)'''

: The choice of, and order of notes in the playing of a chord, which creates a different sound. For example, a C Maj 7 chord played with the voicing "C, E, G, B" (letter names refer to individual pitches that make up the chord) is often considered to sound more "open" than a voicing where the chord is inverted so that some of the chord tones are very close in pitch (e.g. B, C, E, G). Another way that players may "voice" the same type of chord differently is by adding tones. For example, if a lead sheet shows the chord C Maj 7, some guitarists might play "E,A,D", a voicing which is "open" (insofar as it consists of large intervals) and which contains two "colour" tones, namely the sixth ("A") and the ninth ("D") of the chord.

'''''Hellboy: The Science of Evil''''' is a [[video game]] adapted from the [[Hellboy (2004 film)|2004 ''Hellboy'' film]] by [[Guillermo del Toro]], based on the [[comic book]] character of [[Hellboy|the same name]]. It was released for the [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation Portable]] on June 24, 2008 in North America, followed by an August 15 release in Europe and August 22 release in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/psp/action/hellboy/similar.html?mode=versions |title=GameSpot release dates |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201184643/http://www.gamespot.com/psp/action/hellboy/similar.html?mode=versions |archive-date=December 1, 2008 |accessdate=July 11, 2015 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All versions follow the same story line, however the PSP version of the game differs from the Xbox 360 and PlayStation versions. There are 3 playable characters: [[Hellboy]], [[Abe Sapien]], and [[Liz Sherman]]. [[Lobster Johnson]] was planned to be included as a playable character, voiced by [[Bruce Campbell]], but the DLC was never released. [[Herman von Klempt]] (voiced by [[Jürgen Prochnow]]) is the game's main villain, along with several of his 'kriegaffen'. The game has online and offline multiplayer co-op for up to 2 players.

The game was created under the creative direction of both the comic book's creator, [[Mike Mignola]], and the film's director, [[Guillermo del Toro]]. [[Ron Perlman]], [[Selma Blair]] and [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] reprise their roles from the film as Hellboy, [[Liz Sherman]] and [[Abe Sapien]] respectively, providing voice-overs.

==Gameplay==
Players control [[Hellboy]] in a [[Third-person shooter|third-person]] perspective as they progress through a series of levels broken up into six chapters. Levels consist of separate stages and routes occupied by multiple groups of enemies that differ between chapters. In most cases, all enemies in an area must be defeated in order to move to the next phase of the chapter, with ghostly barriers of smoke blocking paths while foes remain present. To combat opponents, Hellboy uses his stone [[Hellboy#Right Hand of Doom|"right hand of doom"]] for most hand-to-hand combat situations, with heavy and quick attacks that can be mixed together for varied combinations. Foes can eventually be stunned, as indicated with a grey flash. Hellboy also performs other attacks, such as slams and head butts, along with cinematic finishing moves when his opponent is near death. These finishing moves are necessary in the boss fights. As Hellboy defeats his enemies, he receives energy that is stored in his health meter. This energy is used to execute certain grapple moves and to activate "Hellmode", where Hellboy's right hand of doom becomes engulfed in flames causing further damage in combat.

Another weapon that can be used is Hellboy's oversized pistol known as the Samaritan. The weapon fires single shots with up to nine different types of ammunition (certain types are not available on certain levels). While most kinds are for damaging opponents like "Heavy", "[[Grenade]]" and "Splinter" ammunition, others can be used during the game's puzzles like "Ignite" to light beacons or "Release" to destroy cursed vines. Additional types of ammunition like "Charge" can only be obtained by defeating certain enemies with a finishing move.

Hellboy can pick up various objects on each level to be used as a projectile or weapon such as barrels, hammers, pipes, rocks and even parts of enemies or their own weapons. Some items are used in tasks to progress through levels such as lighting fires or lanterns. Other puzzle elements include certain obstacles like doors and cracked walls that require Hellboy to smash through with his right hand of doom and then pull levers connected to obstructions. Throughout the single player mode, there are collectables in the form of artifacts and lores. These act as additional small details to the story and increase maximum energy capacity for the Hellmode ability.

The story mode can be played cooperatively with another player, both locally with another controller or online over [[Xbox Live]] for the [[Xbox 360]] version and [[PlayStation Network]] for the [[PlayStation 3]] version. The game's host always plays as Hellboy and can save each chapter while the second player has the choice of playing as either [[Abe Sapien]] or [[Liz Sherman]], both with their own unique abilities and form of combat such as Abe's array of martial arts moves for combat or Liz's [[pyrokinesis]].

==Plot==
The plot opens in [[Romania]] where Hellboy has been sent to track a crazed witch through an abandoned graveyard inhabited by werewolves and the undead. As he battles the witch, she shapeshifts into a swarm of crows that retreats and takes refuge in the nearby village. When Hellboy arrives, he is ambushed by a Nazi soldier and pushed downhill into the village.

The action shifts to 25 years earlier in an unknown part of rural [[Japan]] where Hellboy has been sent in to investigate reports of paranormal activity. He is quickly attacked by an [[Oni (folklore)|Oni]]. It is revealed through an old monk later that the Oni's hostility is because their sacred artifact was stolen by the Nazis, under the command of [[Herman von Klempt]] who is seeking to use it for their own gain. After heading into the cliffs, Hellboy spots Klempt but is attacked by one of Herman's Kriegaffe. Their fight continues in an old temple until Herman falls over the cliffs after accidentally being struck by a log thrown by his own minion. Hellboy returns the artifact to the old monk.

The story continues back in the present in Romania with Hellboy pursuing the witch into the abandoned village, which is filled with the undead and Nazi robots battling one another. In a final battle with the witch in the village church, Hellboy pulls down the giant bell, crushing the witch. This is followed by the collapse of the church itself with Hellboy falling into the underground catacombs, where he finds a group of excavating creatures resembling an [[Ogdru Hem]], also swarming with "[[Ogdru Jahad#The role of the "Frog monsters"|frog monsters]]". Eventually Hellboy destroys the foundations of the catacombs, causing it to cave in and knocking him into an abyss.

The following chapter follows Hellboy on a past mission 40 years ago in the [[Tunisia]]n desert. He stumbles upon a wounded alien soldier who tells of the Nazis again attempting to gain power. This time they tried to use an alien beast, but failed and even though the alien is contained in a crystal prison, it was controlling the fallen Nazis in an attempt to destroy all life on Earth. Further on another soldier reveals that the beast had followed the alien soldiers to Earth. Hellboy tracks down and battles the giant worm while underground. He leads the worm to the surface and defeats it.

Back in the present day, Hellboy wakes up after washing up on the shores of an unknown part of [[Eastern Europe]]. There he finds a giant castle on the cliffside. He tries to send a transmission for backup, but his radio signal overlaps with Herman von Klempt's, alerting each to the other's presence. After making his way further into the castle, Hellboy encounters an undead soldier who tells him the castle was built by the Nazis to carry out their experiments, with Klempt returning to finish his work. Hellboy eventually tracks down Klempt to his laboratory. Klempt releases a giant cyborg mutant to kill Hellboy, but during the battle Klempt's control room catches fire and he is badly burned revealing him to be a robot. After Hellboy and the cyborg continues their battle outside, Klempt's real head appears in a hovering jar. Hellboy grabs Klempt's jar and forces it into the power core on the mutant's back, causing it to explode, throwing Hellboy off the castle and into the ocean. After emerging from the water, Hellboy watches the castle's destruction only to suddenly spot the same swarm of crows the witch turned into leading Hellboy off once again on another mission.

==History==
The contemporary sport of ice hockey was developed in Canada, most notably in Montreal, where the first indoor hockey game was played on March 3, 1875. Some characteristics of that game, such as the length of the ice rink and the use of a puck, have been retained to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/28/ice-hockey-not-made-in-canada-identity|title=Ice hockey not invented in Canada?

Before the formation  of the [[NHL]] the first professional ice hockey leagues was the [[Coloured Hockey League]] in 1895.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}
[[File:Premiere Coupe Stanley 1893.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Stanley Cup]] in 1893. The trophy was donated by [[Lord Stanley of Preston]], to be awarded to the top ice hockey team in the country.]]
The [[Stanley Cup]] is the oldest trophy in North American sports. [[Lord Stanley of Preston]] was appointed by [[Queen Victoria]] to be the [[Governor General of Canada]] on June 11, 1888.  While governor, ice hockey was still just forming in Canada.  He first got to see the game of hockey played at Montreal's 1889 Winter Carnival.  During the carnival he watched the [[Montreal Victorias]] play the [[Montreal Hockey Club]]. Since then, he and his family became very involved in the game of ice hockey.  His two sons, Arthur and Algernon, convinced their father to donate a trophy that would be considered to be a visible sign of the ice hockey championship, which was a silver bowl inlaid with gold. The trophy was first presented in 1893 and was called the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup. The name of the trophy was later changed to its more famous name, The Stanley Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/sports/nhl/why-hockey-isnt-really-our-game-canadas-national-sport-was-born-on-the-frozen-ponds-of-england-book-reveals|title=Why hockey isn't really our game: Canada's national sport was born on the frozen ponds of England, book reveals|website=Nationalpost.com|accessdate=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/28/ice-hockey-not-made-in-canada-identity|title=Ice hockey not invented in Canada?

Professional teams emerged after 1900. Five cities in the United States and Ontario formed the [[International Professional Hockey League]] (IPHL) in 1904. The American-based league was the beginning of professional ice hockey. The IPHL attracted high end Canadian players, depriving Canada of its best players. Although many Canadian amateur teams paid their players under the table, most Canadian hockey associations still stuck to the codes of amateurism. The IPHL ceased after three years, but that was long enough to spark the creation of a Canadian-based professional league, the [[Ontario Professional Hockey League]], in 1908. Though some believe the IHL's short existence was due to lack of spectator interest, the primary reason the league failed was a loss of good players back to Canadian teams that by 1906 played in hockey associations, such as the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association, that allowed professionals to play alongside amateurs. The [[National Hockey League]] was formed in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel S. Mason, "The International Hockey League and the Professionalization of Ice Hockey, 1904-1907." Journal of Sport History 1998 25(1): 1-17.{{ISSN|0094-1700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The violence of the sport instigated the [[Ottawa Silver Seven]] and [[Montreal Wanderers]] rivalry of 1907. Newspapers described hockey as a combination of "brutal butchery" and "strenuous spectacle," speaking to public perceptions and different ways of experiencing the game. Ideals of respectable, middle-class masculinity and rough, working-class masculinity co-existed within accounts of fast, skilled, rugged, hard-hitting hockey.&lt;ref&gt;Stacy L. Lorenz, and Geraint B. Osborne, "'Talk about Strenuous Hockey': Violence, Manhood, and the 1907 Ottawa Silver Seven-Montreal Wanderer Rivalry." Journal of Canadian Studies 2006 40(1): 125-156. {{ISSN|0021-9495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s the Winnipeg's senior hockey league for the 1919-20 season, the [[Winnipeg Falcons]], featuring the [[Icelandic Canadians]], became Canadian national champions and won the [[Ice hockey at the 1920 Winter Olympics|1920 Olympic gold medal]] in Antwerp for Canada in hockey. With their devotion to Canada  in [[World War I]], their integration made this team a symbol of Canadian masculinity, unaffected by the ethnic stereotyping and discrimination that affected some other sports teams during the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan Eyford, "From Prairie Goolies to Canadian Cyclones: the Transformation of the 1920 Winnipeg Falcons." Sport History Review 2006 37(1): 5-18.{{ISSN|1087-1659}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Great Depression]], the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]] was forced to re-evaluate its position on amateurism in ice hockey and to assess its relationship to the amateur sports infrastructure in Canada, which was headed by the [[Amateur Athletic Union of Canada]]. The lackluster performance of the Canadian national hockey team at the [[Ice hockey at the 1936 Winter Olympics|1936 Olympics]],  over player availability forced radcaial changes on approaches to how the game was formulated in the country.&lt;ref&gt;John Wong, "Sport Networks on Ice: the Canadian Experience at the 1936 Olympic Hockey Tournament." Sport History Review 2003 34(2): 190-212.{{ISSN|1087-1659}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maurice Richard]] is considered one of the greatest hockey players Canada has ever produced especially in Quebec. Richard won two [[Hart Memorial Trophy|Hart Trophies]] as league MVP, and led the [[Montreal Canadiens]] to eight Stanley Cups&lt;ref&gt;Melançon Benoît, Les Yeux de Maurice Richard: Une Histoire Culturelle, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1972, Canada's best hockey players from the National Hockey League (NHL) played the elite amateurs from the Soviet Union in a friendly series. When Canadian prime minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] met his Soviet counterpart, [[Alexei Kosygin]], in 1971, their discussions included increasing the hockey competitions between the two countries. Soon after, hockey hierarchies of both nations decided on a series of eight games, four to be played across Canada and four in Moscow. For Canadians, the [[Summit Series]] was intended to be a celebration of their global supremacy in ice hockey. The architects of Soviet hockey, on the other hand, had designs on surprising Canada and the world with their skill and claiming the Canadian game as their own.&lt;ref&gt;J. J.

[[File:Gibson ES-175.png|thumb|175px|right|Hollowbody electric guitars are quite common in jazz; the [[Gibson ES-175]] is a classic example. It has been in production continuously since 1949.]]

The term '''''jazz guitar''''' may refer to either a type of guitar or to the variety of guitar playing styles used in the various genres which are commonly termed "[[jazz]]". The jazz-type [[guitar]] was born as a result of using [[Guitar amplifier|electric amplification]] to increase the volume of conventional acoustic guitars.

Conceived in the early 1930s, the electric guitar became a necessity as jazz musicians sought to amplify their sound to be heard over loud [[big band]]s. When guitarists in big bands only had acoustic guitars, all they could do was play [[chord (music)|chord]]s; they could not play solos because the acoustic guitar is not a loud instrument. Once guitarists switched from [[acoustic guitar]] to [[semi-acoustic guitar]] and began using [[guitar amplifier]]s, it made the guitar much easier to hear, which enabled guitarists to play [[guitar solo]]s. Jazz guitar had an important influence on jazz in the beginning of the twentieth century. Although the earliest guitars used in jazz were [[acoustic guitar|acoustic]] and acoustic guitars are still sometimes used in jazz, most jazz guitarists since the 1940s have performed on an electrically amplified guitar or [[electric guitar]].

Traditionally, jazz electric guitarists use an [[archtop guitar|archtop]] with a relatively broad hollow sound-box, violin-style [[f-holes]], a "[[bridge (instrument)|floating bridge]]", and a [[Pick up (music technology)|magnetic pickup]]. [[Solid body]] guitars, mass-produced since the early 1950s, are also used.

Jazz guitar playing styles include "[[comping]]" with jazz chord voicings (and in some cases [[walking bass]] lines) and "blowing" ([[improvising]]) over jazz chord progressions with jazz-style [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]] and ornaments.  Comping refers to playing chords underneath a song's melody or another musician's solo improvisations.  When jazz guitar players improvise, they may use the scales, modes, and arpeggios associated with the chords in a tune's chord progression and elements of the tune's melody.

==History==

===1900–mid-1930s===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}The stringed, chord-playing rhythm can be heard in groups which included military band-style instruments such as brass, saxes, clarinets, and drums, such as early jazz groups. As the acoustic guitar became a more popular instrument in the early 20th century, guitar-makers began building louder guitars which would be useful in a wider range of settings.

The Gibson L5, an acoustic [[archtop guitar]] which was first produced in 1923, was an early “jazz”-style guitar which was used by early jazz guitarists such as [[Eddie Lang]]. By the 1930s, the guitar began to displace the banjo as the primary chordal rhythm instrument in jazz music, because the guitar could be used to voice chords of greater harmonic complexity, and it had a somewhat more muted tone  that blended well with the [[upright bass]], which, by this time, had almost completely replaced the tuba as the dominant bass instrument in jazz music.

===Late 1930s-1960s===
During the late 1930s and through the 1940s—the heyday of [[big band]] jazz and [[swing music]]—the guitar was an important [[rhythm section]] instrument. Some guitarists, such as [[Freddie Green]] of [[Count Basie]]’s band, developed a guitar-specific style of accompaniment. Few of the big bands, however, featured amplified guitar solos, which were done instead in the small combo context. The most important jazz guitar soloists of this period included the Manouche virtuoso [[Django Reinhardt]], [[Oscar Moore]] who was featured with [[Nat “King” Cole]]’s trio, and [[Charlie Christian]] of [[Benny Goodman]]'s band and sextet, who was a major influence despite his early death at 25.

[[File:Duke Ellington - Hurricane Ballroom - rhythm section.jpg|thumb|[[Duke Ellington]]'s [[big band]] had a rhythm section that included a jazz guitarist, a double bass player, and a drummer (not visible).]]

It was not until the large-scale emergence of small combo jazz in the post-WWII period that the guitar took off as a versatile instrument, which was used both in the rhythm section and as a featured melodic instrument and solo improviser. In the hands of [[George Barnes (musician)|George Barnes]], [[Kenny Burrell]], [[Herb Ellis]], [[Barney Kessel]], [[Jimmy Raney]], and [[Tal Farlow]], who had absorbed the language of [[bebop]], the guitar began to be seen as a “serious” jazz instrument. Improved electric guitars such as Gibson’s [[Gibson ES-175|ES-175]] (released in 1949), gave players a larger variety of tonal options. In the 1940s through the 1960s, players such as [[Wes Montgomery]], [[Joe Pass]], and [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]] laid the foundation of what is now known as "jazz guitar" playing.

===1970s===

[[File:John McLaughlin 1 fcm.jpg|thumb|Jazz fusion pioneer [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]] at a festival in Limburgerhof, Germany, 2008]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}As [[jazz-rock fusion]] emerged in the early 1970s, many players switched to the more rock-oriented [[solid body guitars]]. Other jazz guitarists, like [[Grant Green]] and [[Wes Montgomery]], turned to applying their skills to  pop-oriented styles that fused jazz with soul and R&amp;B, such as [[soul jazz]]-styled [[organ trio]]s. Younger jazz musicians rode the surge of electric popular genres such as blues, rock, and funk to reach new audiences. Guitarists in the fusion realm fused the post-bop harmonic and melodic language of musicians such as [[John Coltrane]], [[McCoy Tyner]], [[Ornette Coleman]], and [[Miles Davis]] with a hard-edged (and usually very loud) rock tone created by guitarists such as Cream's [[Eric Clapton]] who had redefined the sound of the guitar for those unfamiliar with the black blues players of Chicago and, before that, the Delta region of the Mississippi upon whom his style was based. With [[John Mayall]]'s Bluesbreakers, Clapton turned up the volume on a sound already pioneered by Buddy Guy, Freddie King, B.B. King and others that was fluid, with heavy finger vibratos, string bending, and speed through powerful Marshall amplifiers.

Fusion players such as [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]] adopted the fluid, powerful sound of rock guitarists such as Clapton and Jimi Hendrix. McLaughlin was a master innovator, incorporating hard jazz with the new sounds of Clapton, Hendrix, Beck and others. McLaughlin later formed the Mahavishnu Orchestra, an historically important fusion band that played to sold out venues in the early 1970s and as a result, produced an endless progeny of fusion guitarist. Guitarists such as [[Pat Martino]], [[Al Di Meola]], [[Larry Coryell]], [[John Abercrombie (guitarist)|John Abercrombie]],  [[John Scofield]] and [[Mike Stern]] (the latter two both alumni of the Miles Davis band) fashioned a new language for the guitar which introduced jazz to a new generation of fans. Like the rock-blues icons that preceded them, fusion guitarists usually played their solid body instruments through stadium rock-style amplification, and signal processing "effects" such as simulated distortion, wah-wah, octave splitters, compression, and flange pedals. They also simply turned up to full volume in order to create natural overdrive such as the blues rock players.

===1980s–2000s===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}By the early 1980s, the radical experiments of early 1970s-era fusion gave way to a more radio-friendly sounds of [[smooth jazz]]. Guitarist [[Pat Metheny]] mixed the sounds of blues, country, and “world” music, along with rock and jazz, playing both a flat-top acoustic guitar and an electric guitar with a softer, more mellow tone which was sweetened with a shimmering effect known as “[[chorus effect|chorusing]]". During the 1980s, a neo-traditional school of jazz sought to reconnect with the past. In keeping with such an aesthetic, young guitarists of this era sought a clean and round tone, and they often played traditional hollow-body arch-top guitars without electronic effects, frequently through [[vacuum tube amplifier]]s.

As players such as [[Bobby Broom]], [[Peter Bernstein (guitarist)|Peter Bernstein]], [[Howard Alden]], [[Russell Malone]], and [[Mark Whitfield]] revived the sounds of traditional jazz guitar, there was also a resurgence of archtop luthierie (guitar-making). By the early 1990s many small independent luthiers began making archtop guitars. In the 2000s, jazz guitar playing continues to change. Some guitarists incorporate a Latin jazz influence, [[acid jazz]]-style dance club music uses samples from [[Wes Montgomery]], and guitarists such as [[Bill Frisell]] continue to defy categorization.

==Types of guitars==

===Archtop guitars===
{{Main|Archtop guitar}}
[[File:Guitard Epiphone 03.jpg|thumb|right |150 px| A hollow-bodied Epiphone guitar with violin-style "F" holes.]] While jazz can be played on any type of guitar, from an acoustic instrument to a solid-bodied [[electric guitar]]  such as a Fender Stratocaster, the full-depth archtop guitar has become known as the prototypical "jazz guitar." Archtop guitars are [[steel-string acoustic guitar]]s with a big soundbox, arched top, violin-style [[f-hole]]s, a "[[tremolo arm#Fender floating bridge|floating bridge]]" and [[magnetic pickup|magnetic]] or [[piezoelectric pickup]]s. Early makers of jazz guitars included [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]], [[Epiphone]], D'Angelico and Stromberg. The electric guitar is plugged into a [[guitar amplifier]] to make it sound loud enough for performance. Guitar amplifiers have equalizer controls that allow the guitarist to change the tone of the instrument, by emphasizing or de-emphasizing certain frequency bands. The use of [[reverberation|reverb effects]], which are often included in guitar amplifiers, has long been part of the jazz guitar sound. Particularly since the 1970s [[jazz fusion]] era, some jazz guitarists have also used [[effects unit|effects pedals]] such as [[distortion (music)|overdrive pedals]], [[chorus effect|chorus pedals]] and [[wah pedal]]s.

The earliest guitars used in jazz were acoustic, later superseded by a typical electric configuration of two [[humbucker|humbucking pickups]]. In the 1990s, there was a resurgence of interest among jazz guitarists in acoustic archtop guitars with floating pickups. The original acoustic archtop guitars were designed to enhance volume: for that reason they were constructed for use with relatively heavy [[guitar string]]s. Even after electrification became the norm, jazz guitarists continued to fit strings of 0.012" gauge or heavier for reasons of tone, and also prefer [[flatwound string]]s. The characteristic arched top can be made of a solid piece of wood that is carved into the arched shape, or a piece of laminated wood (essentially a type of plywood) that is pressed into shape. [[Spruce]] is often used for tops, and [[maple]] for backs. Archtop guitars can be mass-produced, such as the [[Ibanez Artcore series]], or handmade by [[luthier]]s such as [[Robert Benedetto]].

===Other guitars===
* The [[Selmer-Maccaferri guitar]] is strongly associated with [[Django Reinhardt]] and [[gypsy swing]].
* The [[resonator guitar]] was used (but not exclusively) by [[Oscar Aleman]].
* [[Nylon string guitar]]s are associated with [[Latin jazz]], for instance in the work of [[Charlie Byrd]] and [[Laurindo Almeida]].
* [[Flat top guitar|Flat-top]] steel-string guitars (particularly [[Ovation guitar]]s) have been used in the "acoustic [[shred guitar|shredding]]" of [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]], [[Larry Coryell]] and [[Al Di Meola]].
* Solid-body [[electric guitar]]s have been used in [[Jazz-rock]], for instance by [[Bill Frisell]] and [[Stanley Jordan]]. The [[Telecaster]] in particular has a jazz following, e.g.[[Ed Bickert]] and [[Ted Greene]].
* [[Synthesizer guitar]]s in jazz-rock and avant-garde jazz, e.g. by [[Allan Holdsworth]] and [[Pat Metheny]].
* [[Seven string guitar]]s by [[George van Eps]], [[Lenny Breau]], [[Bucky Pizzarelli]] and [[Howard Alden]].
* [[Eight-string guitar]]s by [[Ralph Patt]].&lt;ref name="Peterson37"&gt;{{harvtxt|Peterson|2002|p=37}}: {{cite journal|title=Tuning in thirds: A new approach to playing leads to a new kind of guitar |first=Jonathon |last=Peterson |location=8222 South Park Avenue, Tacoma WA 98408: USA. |url=http://www.luth.org/backissues/al69-72/al72.htm |journal=American Lutherie: The Quarterly Journal of the Guild of American Luthiers |publisher=The Guild of American Luthiers |issn=1041-7176 |volume=72 |date=Winter 2002 |accessdate=9  October 2012 |pages=36–43 |ref=harv] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021185726/http://www.luth.org/backissues/al69-72/al72.htm |archivedate=2011-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical ingredients==

===Rhythm===
Jazz rhythm guitar often consists of very textural, odd-meter playing that includes generous use of exotic, difficult-to-fret chords. In 4/4 timing, it is common to play 2.5 beat intervals such as on the 2 and then the half beat or "and" after 4. Jazz guitarists may play chords "ahead" of the beat, by playing the chord a swung eighth note before the actual chord change. Chords are not generally played in a repetitive rhythmic fashion, like a rock [[rhythm guitar]]ist would play.

===Harmony===
Jazz guitarists use their knowledge of [[harmony]] and jazz theory to create jazz chord "voicings," which emphasize the 3rd and 7th notes of the chord. Some more sophisticated chord voicings also include the 9th, 11th, and 13th notes of the chord. In some modern jazz styles, [[dominant 7th]] chords in a tune may contain altered 9ths (either flattened by a semitone, which is called a "flat 9th", or sharpened by a semitone, which is called a "sharp 9th"); 11ths (sharpened by a semitone, which is called a "sharp 11th"); 13ths (typically flattened by a semitone, which is called a "flat 13th").

Jazz guitarists need to learn about a range of different chords, including [[major 7th]], [[major 6th]], [[minor 7th]], [[minor/major seventh|minor/major 7th]], [[dominant 7th]], [[diminished seventh chord|diminished]], [[half-diminished seventh chord|half-diminished]], and [[augmented chord]]s. As well, they need to learn about chord transformations (e.g., altered chords, such as "alt dominant chords" described above), [[chord substitution]]s, and re-harmonization techniques. Some jazz guitarists use their knowledge of jazz scales and chords to provide a [[walking bass]]-style accompaniment.

Jazz guitarists learn to perform these chords over the range of different [[chord progression]]s used in jazz, such as the ubiquitous ii-V-I progression, the jazz-style [[12 bar blues|blues progression]] (which, in contrast to a blues-style 12 bar progression, may have two or more chord changes per bar) the minor jazz-style blues form, the I-vi-ii-V based "[[rhythm changes]]" progression, and the variety of modulation-rich chord progressions used in jazz ballads, and [[jazz standard]]s. Guitarists may also learn to use the chord types, strumming styles, and [[effects pedal]]s (e.g., [[chorus effect]] or [[Distortion (music)|fuzzbox]]) used in 1970s-era jazz-Latin, jazz-funk, and jazz-rock fusion music.

===Melody===
Jazz guitarists integrate the basic building blocks of scales and arpeggio patterns into balanced rhythmic and melodic phrases that make up a cohesive solo. Jazz guitarists often try to imbue their melodic phrasing with the sense of natural breathing and legato phrasing used by horn players such as saxophone players. As well, a jazz guitarists' solo improvisations have to have a rhythmic drive and "timefeel" that creates a sense of "[[Swing music|swing]]" and "groove." The most experienced jazz guitarists learn to play with different "timefeels" such as playing "ahead of the beat" or "behind the beat," to create or release tension.

Another aspect of the jazz guitar style is the use of stylistically appropriate ornaments, such as grace notes, slides, and muted notes. Each subgenre or era of jazz has different ornaments that are part of the style of that subgenre or era. Jazz guitarists usually learn the appropriate ornamenting styles by listening to prominent recordings from a given style or jazz era.  Some jazz guitarists also borrow ornamentation techniques from other jazz instruments, such as [[Wes Montgomery]]'s borrowing of playing melodies in parallel octaves, which is a jazz piano technique. Jazz guitarists also have to learn how to add in passing tones, use "guide tones" and chord tones from the chord progression to structure their improvisations.

In the 1970s and 1980s, with jazz-rock fusion guitar playing, jazz guitarists incorporated rock [[guitar solo]]ing approaches, such as [[riff]]-based soloing and usage of [[pentatonic]] and [[blues scale]] patterns. Some guitarists used [[Jimi Hendrix]]-influenced distortion and wah-wah effects to get a sustained, heavy tone, or even used rapid-fire [[guitar shredding]] techniques, such as [[tapping]] and [[tremolo bar]] bending. Guitarist [[Al Di Meola]], who started his career with [[Return to Forever]] in 1974, was one of the first guitarists to perform in a "[[shred guitar|shred]]" style, a technique later used in rock and heavy metal playing. Di Meola used alternate-picking to perform very rapid sequences of notes in his solos.

===Improvisation===
When jazz guitar players [[improvisation|improvise]], they use the scales, modes, and arpeggios associated with the chords in a tune's chord progression. The approach to improvising has changed since the earliest eras of jazz guitar. During the Swing era, many soloists improvised "by ear" by embellishing the melody with ornaments and passing notes. However, during the bebop era, the rapid tempo and complicated chord progressions made it increasingly harder to play "by ear." Along with other improvisers, such as saxes and piano players, bebop-era jazz guitarists began to improvise over the chord changes using scales (whole tone scale, chromatic scale, etc.) and arpeggios.&lt;ref&gt;''Jazzology: The Encyclopedia of Jazz Theory for All Musicians'', by Robert Rawlins, Nor Eddine Bahha, Barrett Tagliarino. Hal Leonard Corporation, 2005 {{ISBN|0-634-08678-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-634-08678-6}}. Page 141&lt;/ref&gt; Jazz guitar players tend to improvise around chord/scale relationships, rather than reworking the melody, possibly due to their familiarity with chords resulting from their comping role. A source of melodic ideas for improvisation is transcribing improvised solos from recordings. This provides jazz guitarists with a source of "licks", melodic phrases and ideas they incorporate either intact or in variations, and is an established way of learning from the previous generations of players.

==Playing styles==

===Big band rhythm===
In jazz [[big band]]s, popular during the 1930s and 1940s, the guitarist is considered an integral part of the rhythm section (guitar, [[drum]]s and [[Double bass|bass]]). They usually played a regular four strums to the bar, although an amount of harmonic improvisation is possible. [[Freddie Green]], guitarist in the [[Count Basie]] orchestra, was a noted exponent of this style. The harmonies are often minimal; for instance, the [[root (chord)|root note]] is often omitted on the assumption that it will be supplied by the bassist.

===Small group comping===
When jazz guitarists play chords underneath a song's melody or another musician's solo improvisations, it is called "[[comping]]", short for "accompanying" {{Citation needed span|text=and for "complementing".|date=April 2010}} The accompanying style in most jazz styles differs from the way chordal instruments accompany in many popular styles of music. In many popular styles of music, such as rock and pop, the [[rhythm guitar]]ist usually performs the chords in rhythmic fashion which sets out the beat or groove of a tune. In contrast, in many modern jazz styles within smaller, the guitarist plays much more sparsely, intermingling periodic chords and delicate voicings into pauses in the melody or solo, and using periods of silence. Jazz guitarists commonly use a wide variety of [[Inversion (music)|inversions]] when comping, rather than only using standard voicings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eden.rutgers.edu/~pfelton/inversions.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930075616/http://eden.rutgers.edu/~pfelton/inversions.html |archivedate=2011-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chord-melody and unaccompanied soloing===
In this style, the guitarist aims to render an entire song &amp;mdash; harmony, melody and bass &amp;mdash; in something like the way a [[classical guitar]]ist or [[pianist]] can. Chord roots cannot be left to the bassist in this style. Chords themselves can be used sparsely or more densely, depending on both the individual player and his or her arrangement of a particular piece. In the sparse style, a full chord is often played only at the beginning of a melodic phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jazzguitarlessons.net/chord-melody.html|title=Chord Melody For Jazz Guitar: How-to on Jazz Standards|work=JazzGuitarLessons.net|access-date=2017-05-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The denser chordal textures, in contrast,  approach chord soloing (see below). A third approach is to maintain a steady, busy bass-line, like a New Orleans pianist. Here, no more than two or three notes are played at a time, and the full harmony is indicated by arpeggiation. Exponents of this style often come from a [[Country music|country]], [[Folk music|folk]] or [[ragtime]] background, such as [[Chet Atkins]], although it is also sometimes employed by [[straight-ahead jazz]] practitioners, for instance [[Martin Taylor (guitarist)|Martin Taylor]]. Chord-melody is often played with a [[plectrum]] (see [[Tal Farlow]], [[George Benson]] and others); whereas [[Fingerstyle#Fingerstyle jazz guitar|fingerstyle]], as practised by [[Joe Pass]], [[George van Eps]],  [[Ted Greene]], [[Robert Conti]], [[Lenny Breau]] or [[hybrid picking]] as practised by [[Ed Bickert]], Laszlo Sirsom and others allows for a more complex, [[polyphonic]] approach to unaccompanied soloing.

==="Blowing" or single-note soloing===
[[Charlie Christian]] and [[Django Reinhardt]] are generally held to have initiated the use of the guitar to play melodies and improvisations over other instruments, the former using an early form of amplification, the latter playing forcefully on an acoustic guitar. Over the years, jazz guitarists have been able to solo in standard jazz idioms, such as [[bebop]], [[cool jazz]] and so on, while in also absorbing influences from rock guitarists, such as the use of electronic effects.

===Chord soloing===
Jazz guitarists are not limited to single note improvisation. When working with accompaniment, chord solos are created by improvising chords (harmony) and melody simultaneously, usually in the upper register on strings 1,2,3 and 4. [[Wes Montgomery]] was noted for playing successive choruses in single notes, then octaves and finally a chord solo - this can be heard in his improvisation on the standard [[Lover Man (Oh, Where Can You Be?)]]. When playing without accompaniment, jazz guitarists may create chord solos by playing bass, melody and chords, individually or simultaneously, on any or all strings - such as the work of [[Lenny Breau]], [[Joe Pass]], [[Martin Taylor (guitarist)|Martin Taylor]] and others. This technique can be also be incorporated into unaccompanied soloing: for instance [[Django Reinhardt]]'s ''"improvisations"'', as he called his solo pieces.

'''Krome Studios Melbourne''', originally '''Beam Software''', was an Australian [[video game developer|video game development]] studio founded in 1977 by Alfred Milgrom and Naomi Besen and based in [[Melbourne|Melbourne, Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/03/hobbit.htm|title=CRASH 3 - Melbourne House|author=|date=|website=www.crashonline.org.uk|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studio operated independently from 1988 until 2000, when it was acquired by Infogrames, who changed the name to '''Melbourne House'''.&lt;ref name="beamtimeline"&gt;''[http://www.acmi.net.au/hits_80s_timeline.htm Beam Software Timeline.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611011748/http://www.acmi.net.au/hits_80s_timeline.htm |date=11 June 2010 }}'' Documentation for a 2007 exhibition at [[Australian Centre for the Moving Image]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the studio was sold to [[Krome Studios]].&lt;ref name="beamtimeline" /&gt;

The name '''Beam''' was a contraction of the names of the founders: Naomi Besen and Alfred Milgrom.

== History ==

=== Home computer era ===
In the early years, two of Beam's programs were milestones in their respective genre. ''[[The Hobbit (1982 video game)|The Hobbit]]'', a 1982 text adventure by Philip Mitchell and Veronika Megler,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Author of '80s classic ''The Hobbit'' didn't know game was a hit|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/18/hobbit_author_veronika_megler_reminisces/|publisher=[[The Register]]|date=18 November 2012|accessdate=10 December 2012|last=Sharwood|first=Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt; sold more than a million copies.&lt;ref name="demaria"&gt;DeMaria, Rusel and Wilson, Johnny L. (2004) ''High Score!: The Illustrated History of Electronic Games'' McGraw-Hill/Osborne, Berkeley, Calif., p. 347, {{ISBN|0-07-223172-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It employed an advanced parser by Stuart Richie and had real-time elements. Even if the player didn't enter commands, the story would move on.&lt;ref name="demaria" /&gt; In 1985 Greg Barnett's two-player [[martial arts]] game ''[[The Way of the Exploding Fist]]'' helped define the genre of one-on-one fighting games on the home computer.&lt;ref name="demaria" /&gt; The game won Best Overall Game at the [[Golden Joystick Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamesradar.com/golden-joysticks-ultimate-list-ultimate-games-1983-2014/ | title=Golden Joysticks Awards' ultimate list of ultimate winners: 1983 - 2016 | publisher=GamesRadar.com | accessdate=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 Beam's publisher, parent company Melbourne House, was sold to [[Mastertronic]] for £850,000.&lt;ref name="mastertronic-histroy"&gt;Anthony Guter: ''[http://www.aguter.plus.com/mastertronic/mastertronic_history.htm History of Mastertronic.]''&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently games were released through varying publishers. The 1988 fighting games [[Samurai Warrior: The Battles of Usagi Yojimbo|Samurai Warrior]] and ''Fist +'', the third installment in the Exploding Fist series, were published through [[Telecomsoft]]s Firebird label. 1988 also saw the release of space-[[shoot'em-up]] ''Bedlam'', published by GO!, one of [[U.S. Gold]]'s labels, and ''[[The Muncher]]'', published by [[Gremlin Graphics]].

=== Shift to consoles and PCs ===
In 1987 Nintendo granted a developer's licence for the [[NES]] and Beam developed games on that platform for US and Japanese publishers. Targeted at an Australian audience, releases such as ''[[Aussie Rules Footy]]'' and ''[[International Cricket]]'' for the NES proved successful.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} In 1992 they released the original title ''[[Nightshade (1992 video game)|Nightshade]]'', a dark superhero comedy game. The game was meant to be the first part in a series, but no sequels were ever made; however, it served as the basis for ''[[Shadowrun (1993 video game)|Shadowrun]]''.

In 1993 they released ''Shadowrun'', with an innovative dialogue system using the acquisition of keywords which could be used in subsequent conversations to initiate new branches in the [[dialogue tree]]. In 1997, Beam relaunched the Melbourne House brand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=In the Studio |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=29|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=May 1997 |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; under which they published the PC titles ''[[KKnD (video game)|Krush Kill 'n' Destroy]]'' (KKND), and the sequels ''KKND Xtreme'' and ''[[KKND2: Krossfire]]''.&lt;ref name = GSpyBio/&gt; They released ''KKND2'' in South Korea well before they released it in the American and European markets, and pirated versions of the game were available on the internet before it was available in stores in the U.S. They were the developers of the 32-bits versions of ''[[The Lost Vikings II|Norse By Norse West: The Return of the Lost Vikings]]'' for the [[Sega Saturn]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Personal computer|PC]] in 1996.&lt;ref name = GSpyBio/&gt; They also helped produce [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] games such as ''[[WCW SuperBrawl Wrestling]]'', ''[[Super Smash TV]]'' and an updated version of ''International Cricket'' titled ''[[Super International Cricket]]''.&lt;ref name = GSpyBio/&gt; They ported the Sega Saturn game ''[[Bug!]]'' to [[Windows 3.1x|Windows 3.x]] in August, 1996.

1998 saw a return to RPGs with ''[[Alien Earth]]'', again with a dialogue tree format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.thecomputershow.com/computershow/reviews/alienearth.htm | title = Alien Earth | author = Al Giovetti | publisher = The Computer Show}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1998, the studio developed racing games ''[[DethKarz]]''&lt;ref name = GSpyBio/&gt; and ''[[GP 500]]''.

In 1999 Beam Software was acquired by [[Infogrames]] and renamed to Infogrames Melbourne House.

=== 2000s ===
They continued to cement a reputation as a racing game developer with ''[[Test Drive: Le Mans]]'' and ''[[Looney Tunes: Space Race]]'' (both [[Dreamcast]] and [[PlayStation 2]]), followed by the technically impressive ''[[Grand Prix Challenge]]'' ([[PlayStation 2]]), before a disastrous venture into third-person shooters with ''[[Men in Black II: Alien Escape]]'' ([[PlayStation 2]], [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-2/men-in-black-ii-alien-escape|title=Men in Black II: Alien Escape|author=|date=|website=Metacritic|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 the studio released ''[[Transformers Armada#PlayStation 2 video game|Transformers]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]] [[games console]] based on the then current [[Transformers Armada]] franchise by [[Hasbro]]. The game reached the top of the UK [[PlayStation 2]] games charts, making it Melbourne House's most successful recent title.

The studio then completed work on [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation Portable]] ports of Eden's next-generation [[Xbox 360]] title ''[[Test Drive Unlimited|Test Drive: Unlimited]]''.

In December 2005, Atari decided to shift away from internal development, seeking to sell its studios, including Melbourne House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/808/Atari-plans-studio-sell-off |title=Atari plans studio sell-off |first=Lisa |last=Foster |date=17 February 2006 |work=MCV |publisher=Intent Media |accessdate=2010-02-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609021505/http://www.mcvuk.com/news/808/Atari-plans-studio-sell-off |archivedate=9 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2006 [[Krome Studios]] announced that it had acquired Melbourne House from [[Atari]] and that the studio would be renamed to Krome Studios Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kromestudios.com/press/pressmain.php?id=00094 |title=Krome Studios expands with new studio in Melbourne |date=3 November 2006 |publisher=Krome Studios |accessdate=2010-02-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929162812/http://www.kromestudios.com/press/pressmain.php?id=00094 |archivedate=29 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kung Fu: The Legend Continues''''' is an American-Canadian [[action fiction|action]]/[[crime film|crime drama]] series and [[sequel]] to the original 1972–1975 television series ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]''. While the original ''Kung Fu'' series was set in the American old west, ''Kung Fu: The Legend Continues'' was set in modern times. It starred [[David Carradine]] and [[Chris Potter (actor)|Chris Potter]] as a father and son trained in [[kung fu]] – Carradine playing a [[Shaolin Temple|Shaolin]] monk, Potter a police detective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= TV REVIEWS : Carradine Kicks In With New 'Kung Fu' |work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1993-01-27/entertainment/ca-1744_1_kung-fu|accessdate=2010-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Retro : Kung Fu: Alive and Kicking |work= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1993-01-24/news/tv-2338_1_kung-fu|accessdate=2010-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series aired in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] for four seasons from January 27, 1993 to January 1, 1997, and was broadcast in over 70 countries. Filming took place in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]].&lt;ref name=Storm&gt;{{cite news |title=Still Alive and Kickin' David Carradine Is Back in "Kung Fu" – 150 Years Older and a Little Wiser |author=Jonathan Storm |work=The Philadelphia Inquirer |date=1993-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reruns of the show have been aired on [[Turner Network Television|TNT]].

The show was canceled when its producer, [[Prime Time Entertainment Network]] (also known as PTEN), ceased operations and no other producer opted to continue the series.

==Plot==
Like his grandfather and namesake from the original series, Kwai Chang Caine is a [[Shaolin Monastery|Shaolin]] priest who walked out of the past. Caine was the head of a temple in Northern California, where his son Peter (Nathaniel Moreau, later Robert Bednarski) also lived and studied, until the temple was destroyed in a fire caused by a renegade priest who believed the priests should serve as mercenaries. After the destruction of the temple, each believed the other had perished and went on their separate ways; Caine wandered and traveled, much as his grandfather had, while Peter became a foster child and eventually a police officer. The series begins when Caine comes to fictional Sloanville and ends up in the Chinatown section of town, where Peter's precinct is located, and they are reunited after 15 years.

'''Laurene Landon (aka''' '''Laurene Landon Coughlin''') is a [[Canadian-American]] [[film]] and [[television]] [[actress]]. Laurene first began appearing in movies in the 1980s.  She is best known for her roles in ''[[Maniac Cop]]'' and ''[[Maniac Cop 2]]'', ''[[Hundra]]'', ''[[Airplane II: The Sequel]]'', and ''[[...All the Marbles]]'' with [[Peter Falk]].  She is half Irish and half Polish and describes herself as being "bi-Polish".{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
As a young woman she entered [[California State University]] and began training in their [[police academy]] program, but decided that law enforcement was not for her when she came to the realization that she may someday have to use a gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2006/03/07/1798725.html |title=Laurene Landon Spills "All The Marbles" |first=Corey David |last=LaCroix |work=Slam Wrestling |accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; So she decided to try her hand at acting and began her career as an extra in films.

=== Acting career ===
Landon began acting in a bit part in 1979's ''Bitter Heritage'', also released as ''Naked in My Grave''. She was cast as a featured skater in ''[[Roller Boogie]]'' in that same year.

She gained a small role in 1981's ''[[Full Moon High]]'', her first of many collaborations with director [[Larry Cohen]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Landon had spent part of her early career as a model and in 1980 was a runner-up in the ''Miss Black Velvet'' pageant in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]].

While there, a casting director told her to go see another casting director in Los Angeles (Rueben Cannon), regarding a feature film called ''[[...All the Marbles]]''.  As she found modeling boring and was unable to sit still for hours at a time, she took his suggestion.  She starred as ''Molly'' in ''...All the Marbles'', a film starring [[Peter Falk]] that had an alternate title, ''The California Dolls''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://racksandrazors.com/laurence.html |title=Live Wire: Talking With Laurene Landon |first=Owen |last=Keehnen |work=Racks and Razors |accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She described this as her most satisfying role.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}  She was chosen as one of the final four women for the role and was required to undergo rigorous training at a professional wrestling school.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}  Even though she broke her foot during the last match of the tryouts, she and [[Vicki Frederick]] won their parts over 2,000 other young actresses trying out, including one young actress named [[Kathleen Turner]].  The successful film was the last directing effort by [[Robert Aldrich]] (whom she famously referred to as [[Robert Altman]] upon meeting him for the first time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tlweb.latrobe.edu.au/humanities/screeningthepast/firstrelease/fr0600/rtfr10a.htm |title=Robert Aldrich: An Independent Career |first=R.

'''Leonard "Lenny" Lipton''' (born May 18, 1940, [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]) is an author, filmmaker and inventor. At age 19, Lipton wrote the poem that became the basis for the lyrics to the song "[[Puff the Magic Dragon]]". He went on to write books on independent filmmaking and become a pioneer in the field of projected three-dimensional imagery. His technology is used to show  [[3D film]]s on more than 25,000 theater screens worldwide.

== Education ==
Lipton majored in physics at [[Cornell University]] after starting out in electrical engineering. A self-described "mediocre student", he only excelled  once he found a field he loved.  Lipton now urges schools to be more "accepting of eccentric people with a different point of view because we are the people who make the difference."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/careers/working-life/profiles/page_57840.html|title=Once a physicist: Lenny Lipton|last=|first=|date=July 2007|website=IOP: Institute of Physics|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== Puff the Magic Dragon ===
Lipton was 19 when he wrote the poem that was adapted into the lyrics for the 1963 song "[[Puff, the Magic Dragon|Puff the Magic Dragon]]", performed by [[Peter, Paul and Mary|Peter Paul and Mary]]. His inspiration was a 1936 [[Ogden Nash]] poem, "A Tale of Custard the Dragon".  "Pirates and dragons, back then, were common interests in stories for boys," Lipton said. "The Puff story is really just a lot like Peter Pan.” Lipton has spent years denying that the song was about marijuana and believes that the myth was created by New York columnist [[Dorothy Kilgallen]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/the-man-who-wrote-puff-the-magic-dragon-swears-its-not-about-drugs-5365040|title=The Man Who Wrote "Puff, the Magic Dragon" Swears It's Not About Drugs|last=Chelin|first=Pamela|date=2015-02-03|work=L.A. Weekly|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Independent films ===
In the 1960s, Lipton shot several [[experimental film]]s on [[16 mm film|16 mm stock]], most with running times of less than 10 minutes. The best known, ''Let a Thousand Parks Bloom'', a 27-minute film about Berkeley's [[People's Park (Berkeley)|People's Park]], played at the Tate Liverpool Museum and the Whitney Museum of American Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://film-makerscoop.com/filmmakers/lenny-lipton?page=2|title=Lenny Lipton - NY Filmmaker's Coop|website=film-makerscoop.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lennylipton.com/|title=Lenny Lipton:  Inventor, Author, Songwriter and Filmmaker|last=Lipton|first=Lenny|date=|website=www.lennylipton.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following decade, he wrote two books on technologies and methods for independent filmmakers: ''The Super 8 Book'' (1975) and ''Independent Film Making'' (1979). ''Lipton on Filmmaking, a'' compendium of his magazine writings, was also published in 1979.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L_aWx3hHiD0C&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=%22StereoGraphics%22+-wikipedia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KdBn6lNYpA&amp;sig=yfuqe14onn7qWshzY6W_yh8EZko&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiu5NGlvqXXAhXEI5QKHbBxAJMQ6AEI6gEwJw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22StereoGraphics%22%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false|title=3-D Filmmakers: Conversations with Creators of Stereoscopic Motion Pictures|last=Zone|first=Ray|date=2005|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810854376|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stereography===
Lipton is a pioneer in the field of projected three-dimensional imagery and is one of the creators  of the electronic stereoscopic display industry.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/spotlight/reald-3d-pioneers-plans-upgrades-for-mobile-screens-1201752536/|title=RealD at 10: 3D Giant Reinvents Itself to Serve All Screens|last=Cohen|first=David S.|date=2016-04-14|work=Variety|access-date=2017-11-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; His interest dates back to his childhood in New York where he attended movie palaces, with some films shown in [[3D film|3D]].  He drew his own 3D comics using red and green crayons on tracing paper, which were viewed using primitive glasses constructed of cardboard tubes and magnifying lenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303812104576439743736909066|title=A 3-D Maven Weighs In|last=Kung|first=Michelle|date=2011-07-14|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-11-10|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Royalties from "Puff the Magic Dragon" and ''Independent Filmmaking'', which remained in print for 20 years, gave Lipton an independent income that allowed him to follow his interests. His career in stereoscopic display began to gel around 1972. In one early stint, he served as the "convergence setter" for the 1983 3D film ''Rottweiler: Dogs from Hell'', determining for each shot the optimal distance separating the two camera lenses. Previewing a scene from the film, technical staff from [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] were impressed by the stereoscopic imagery, but little else.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

He built a prototype of a flicker-free, field-sequential 3D display system and founded StereoGraphics Corporation in 1980 to fund development.  The system worked by doubling the display rate of images, thereby overcoming a problem inherent in 3D motion picture projection, where each eye views only half the available images.&lt;ref&gt;Zone 2005 p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, he patented the active [[ZScreen]] polarization filter that uses a [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized]] [[liquid crystal]] filter placed in front of a projector, which can then display both the left and right halves of a [[Stereoscopy|stereo pair]].  After [[Real D Cinema]] acquired StereoGraphics in 2005, the technology became the basis for the RealD cinema system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=heNGAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94&amp;lpg=PA94&amp;dq=lenny+lipton+zscreen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7reCxhNDm-&amp;sig=Edj0NA64BaoySTVzXAY5MVWQphI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0irj4-bnXAhWnhVQKHdtbCXk4ChDoAQguMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=lenny%20lipton%20zscreen&amp;f=false|title=Techniques and Principles in Three-Dimensional Imaging: An Introductory Approach|last=Richardson|first=Martin|publisher=IGI Global|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, the system was in use in more than 26,500 screens worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reald.com/#/whoweare|title=RealD - Visual Technology|website=www.reald.com|access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lipton was the [[Chief Technology Officer|chief technology officer]] at RealD until 2009, when he left to do independent consulting.&lt;ref name="cgw"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cgw.com/Publications/CGW/2009/Volume-32-Issue-7-July-2009-/At-the-Crossroads.aspx|title=At the Crossroads {{!}} Computer Graphics World|website=www.cgw.com|access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lipton published his definitive treatment of the subject, ''Foundations of the Stereoscopic Cinema: A Study in Depth'', in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Zone 2005 p 17&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the International 3D Society gave him its Century Award for Lifetime Achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cgw.com/Press-Center/News/2011/International-3D-Society-Names-Lenny-Lipton-Cent.aspx|title=International 3D Society Names Lenny Lipton Century Award Winner for Lifetime Achievement  {{!}} Computer Graphics World|last=|first=|date=February 3, 2011|website=www.cgw.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, he held 68 stereography-related patents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The crew had a wrap party on May 22nd. Until November, despite full edited movie, they still decided to film more scenes in order to make a better ending. Thai Hoa claimed these final days of filming and changing the script in hurry caused him "depression", that he didn't even dare to watch the premiere.

Charlie chose actress Diem My for the character Thu Le, after 3 rounds of casting. He stated that this role "was supposedly portrayed by another actress whose figure is bigger" which caused him spending 3 days casting. However, Charlie claimed that she (Diem My) "is smart to absorb the character's personality" also "being creative in littlest details". As for Diem My, De Mai tinh is one of her favorite movies, she really admires Charlie Nguyen but "nervous and stressful" when she was filming with Thai Hoa.

Actress Thu Trang said that the scene where she took off her clothes to seduce Thai Hoa's character shocked her husband - actor Tien Luat, he also appeared during the filming of that scene and felt "annoyed" as he had witnessed that scene himself.

The official soundtrack of De Mai tinh is "Nhu mot loi hua" (Like A Promise) by singer Thao Trang, who had also performed "Angel In Me" - the OST of De Mai tinh. The song was released as online digital single on December 13th, 2014 along with English version "Like A Promise". Both versions were composed by Phan Cong Thanh. The Vietnamese version was performed by Thao Trang in Toi toa sang show in December 20. Ngoc Lee from YAN News complimented the song "like a breeze in the movie" due to its soft melody.

==Release==
The initial release date was supposed to be in November, 2014 however the official release date was December 12, 2014. The premiere was 2 days before the official release at box office in Ho Chi Minh City.

At the start of October 2014, first poster was revealed along with other promotions. The old title "De Hoi tinh" with the poster portraying the character Hoi in new style with pink dyed hair, a shade and a mustache. A source said before release, the movie title was switched from De Hoi tinh to De Mai tinh 2 for commercial purpose maybe.

Actor Thai Hoa had predicted that the movie was unable to get 100 billion Vietnam Dong profit, "but let's see", he said.

With new title, De Mai tinh 2 attracted 71,766 audiences and earned 5,7 billion Vietnam Dong in first day, defeated Teo Em's record with 4 billion Vietnam Dong 4 years ago. Two days later, the movie continuously earned 7,5 billion Vietnam Dong and 8 billion Vietnam Dong with 200,000 audiences in total, which made De Mai tinh 2 be the second highest grossing after The Vengeful Heart in 2014. In first week release, the movie eared 45 billion Vietnam Dong, until the second week marked in December 26th, the total grossing was 70 billion Vietnam Dong. Early 2015, the movie broke all the records applying for both Vietnam movies and foreign movies since it earned 90 billion Vietnam Dong. Later, this record defeated by Fast and Furious 7.

CGV stated that the success of the movie came from entertainment purpose targeting with simple plot that anyone can understand.

==Reception==

=== The press ===
At the movie premiere night of De Mai tinh 2, actor Thai Hoa was so nervous to watch the movie with the press, whom he claimed that "trying to search for the tiniest flaws which pressure the screw", he decided to skip the movie premiere and had a coffee with Miss Vietnam 2010 runner up Vu Thi Hoang My - who was late to the premiere - in order to release his stress. Unfortunately, since the release, the movie got lots of mixed reviews from the press.

Ngoc Phuong from The Labor wrote as De Mai tinh 2 "failed completely" regarding artistic perspective when inserting many ungraceful details along with other "funny moments". She also criticized Thai Hoa's acting in De Mai tinh 2 was as same as his acting in Long Ruoi, Cuoi ngay keo lo and Teo Em. Another negative review from Phan Cao Tung from The Youth paper, he stated this movie was "one step back" after "not-so-surprising" Teo Em also by Charlie Nguyen, criticized Thai Hoa's acting was repeated over and over again.

[[File:Logos.svg|Left|thumb|[[Greek alphabet|Greek spelling]] of ''logos'']]

'''''Logos''''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|l|oʊ|ɡ|ɒ|s|,_|ˈ|l|ɒ|ɡ|ɒ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|l|oʊ|ɡ|oʊ|s}}; {{lang-grc|[[wikt:λόγος|λόγος]]|lógos}}; from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:λέγω|λέγω]]}}, {{transl|grc|légō}}, {{Literal translation|'I say'|lk=on}}) is a term in [[Western philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[rhetoric]], and [[religion]] derived from a Greek word variously meaning "ground", "plea", "opinion", "expectation", "word", "speech", "account", "reason", "proportion", and "discourse",&lt;ref name="LSJlogos"&gt;Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos ''An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon'']: logos, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Entrys[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos {{lang|grc|λόγος}}] at [[LSJ]] online.&lt;/ref&gt; but it became a technical term in [[Western philosophy]] beginning with [[Heraclitus]] ({{Circa| 535| 475&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}}), who used the term for a principle of order and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'' (2nd ed): Heraclitus, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Logos'' is the logic behind an argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://members.tripod.com/butler_s/f2002-1002/appeals.html |title=The Appeals: Ethos, Pathos, and Logos |last=Butler|first=S|website=members.tripod.com|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Logos'' tries to persuade an audience using [[logical argument]]s and supportive evidence. ''Logos'' is a persuasive technique often used in writing and rhetoric.

Ancient Greek philosophers used the term in different ways. The [[sophist]]s used the term to mean [[discourse]]; [[Aristotle]] applied the term to refer to "reasoned discourse"&lt;ref name="PaulRahe"/&gt; or "the argument" in the field of rhetoric, and considered it one of the three [[modes of persuasion]] alongside ''[[ethos]]'' and ''[[pathos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, Christof, "[https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2010/entries/aristotle-rhetoric/ Aristotle's Rhetoric]", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophers identified the term with the [[divine]] animating principle pervading the Universe. Within [[Hellenistic Judaism]], [[Philo of Alexandria]] ({{Circa| 20&amp;nbsp;BC| 50&amp;nbsp;AD}}) adopted the term into [[Jewish philosophy]].&lt;ref name="cdpPhilo"&gt;''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'' (2nd ed): Philo Judaeus, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gospel of John]] identifies the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]], through which all things are made, as divine (''[[God|theos]]''),&lt;ref name = "May Metzger"&gt;May, Herbert G. and Bruce M. Metzger. ''The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha''. 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; and further identifies [[Jesus Christ]] as the [[incarnate]] Logos. The term is also used in [[Sufism]], and the analytical psychology of [[Carl Jung]].

Despite the conventional translation as "word", it is not used for a [[word]] in the grammatical sense; instead, the term ''lexis'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:λέξις|λέξις]]}}, {{transl|grc|léxis}}) was used.&lt;ref name="LSJlexis"&gt;Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dle%2Fcis ''An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon'']: lexis, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt; However, both ''logos'' and ''lexis'' derive from the same verb {{transl|grc|légō}} ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:λέγω|λέγω]]}}), meaning  "(I) count, tell, say, speak".&lt;ref name="LSJlogos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LSJlexis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LSJlego"&gt;Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dle%2Fgw2 ''An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon'']: legō, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;

Author and Professor Jeanne Fahnestock describes logos as a "premise". She states that, to find the reason behind a rhetor's backing of a certain position or stance, one must acknowledge the different "premises" that the [[rhetor]] applies via his or her chosen diction.&lt;ref name="members.tripod.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fahnestock|first1=Jeanne|title=The Appeals: Ethos, Pathos, and Logos|url=http://members.tripod.com/butler_s/f2002-1002/appeals.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rhetor's success, she argues, will come down to "certain objects of agreement...between arguer and audience". "Logos is logical appeal, and the term logic is derived from it. It is normally used to describe facts and figures that support the speaker's topic."&lt;ref name="mountainman.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aristotle's Three Modes of Persuasion in Rhetoric|url=http://www.mountainman.com.au/ESSENES/aristotles_modes_of_persuasion_in_rhetoric.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, logos is credited with appealing to the audience's sense of logic, with the definition of "logic" being concerned with the thing as it is known.&lt;ref name="mountainman.com.au"/&gt;
Furthermore, one can appeal to this sense of logic in two ways.  The first is through [[inductive reasoning]], providing the audience with relevant examples and using them to point back to the overall statement.&lt;ref name="Ethos, Pathos, and Logos"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethos, Pathos, and Logos|url=http://courses.durhamtech.edu/perkins/aris.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second is through [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] [[enthymeme]], providing the audience with general scenarios and then indicating commonalities among them.&lt;ref name="Ethos, Pathos, and Logos"/&gt;

Philo distinguished between ''logos prophorikos'' ("the uttered word") and the ''logos endiathetos'' ("the word remaining within").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Adam Kamesar|title=The ''Logos Endiathetos'' and the ''Logos Prophorikos'' in Allegorical Interpretation: Philo and the D-Scholia to the ''Iliad'' |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501000000*/https://web.duke.edu/classics/grbs/FTexts/44/Kamesar.pdf |journal=Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies (GRBS)|volume=44|year=2004|pages=163–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stoics]] also spoke of the ''[[logos spermatikos]]'' (the generative principle of the Universe) which foreshadows related concepts in [[Neoplatonism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Biblical Tradition in English Literature |author=David L. Jeffrey |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zD6xVr1CizIC&amp;pg=PA459&amp;dq=Neoplatonism+logos#v=onepage&amp;q=logos%20prophorikos%20the%20uttered%20word%20and%20the%20logos%20endiathetos%20the%20word%20remaining%20within&amp;f=false |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co|year=1992|isbn=0-8028-3634-8|page=459}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early translators of the Greek [[New Testament]] such as [[Jerome]] (in the 4th century AD) were frustrated by the inadequacy of any single Latin word to convey the meaning of the word ''Logos'' as used to describe Jesus Christ in the [[Gospel of John]]. The [[Vulgate]] Bible usage of {{lang|la|in principio erat verbum}} was thus constrained to use the (perhaps inadequate) noun {{lang|la|verbum}} for "word", but later [[Romance language]] translations had the advantage of nouns such as {{lang|fr|le mot}} in French. Reformation translators took another approach. [[Martin Luther]] rejected {{lang|de|Zeitwort}} (verb) in favor of {{lang|de|Wort}} (word), for instance, although later commentators repeatedly turned to a more dynamic use involving ''the living word'' as felt by Jerome and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Biblical Tradition in English Literature |author=David L.

==Ancient Greek philosophy==

===Heraclitus===
{{Further|Heraclitus#Logos}}
The writing of [[Heraclitus]] ({{Circa|535|475&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}})&lt;!---maintain consistency throughout article re: BC vs. BCE---&gt; was the first place where the word ''logos'' was given special attention in [[ancient Greek philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Peters, ''Greek Philosophical Terms'', New York University Press, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; although Heraclitus seems to use the word with a meaning not significantly different from the way in which it was used in ordinary Greek of his time.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. K. C. Guthrie]], ''A History of Greek Philosophy'', vol. 1, Cambridge University Press, 1962, pp. 419ff.&lt;/ref&gt; For Heraclitus, ''logos'' provided the link between rational discourse and the world's rational structure.&lt;ref&gt;''The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|This ''logos'' holds always but humans always prove unable to ever understand it, both before hearing it and when they have first heard it. For though all things come to be in accordance with this ''logos'', humans are like the inexperienced when they experience such words and deeds as I set out, distinguishing each in accordance with its nature and saying how it is. But other people fail to notice what they do when awake, just as they forget what they do while asleep.|[[Diels–Kranz]]|22B1}}

{{quote|For this reason it is necessary to follow what is common. But although the ''logos'' is common, most people live as if they had their own private understanding.|Diels–Kranz|22B2}}

{{quote|Listening not to me but to the ''logos'' it is wise to agree that all things are one.|Diels–Kranz|22B50&lt;ref&gt;Translations from Richard D. McKirahan, ''Philosophy before Socrates'', Hackett, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

What ''logos'' means here is not certain; it may mean "reason" or "explanation" in the sense of an objective cosmic law, or it may signify nothing more than "saying" or "wisdom".&lt;ref&gt;''Handboek geschiedenis van de wijsbegeerte 1'', Article by Jaap Mansveld &amp; Keimpe Algra, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, an independent existence of a universal ''logos'' was clearly suggested by Heraclitus.&lt;ref&gt;W. K. C. Guthrie, ''The Greek Philosophers: From Thales to Aristotle'', Methuen, 1967, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle identifies two specific types of persuasion methods: artistic and inartistic.&lt;ref name="classicalwriting.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovering the Arguments: Artistic and Inartistic Proofs|url=http://www.classicalwriting.com/blog/2010/01/12/discovering-the-arguments-artistic-and-inartistic-proofs/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines artistic proofs as arguments that the [[rhetor]] generates and creates on their own. Examples of these include  relationships, testimonies, and conjugates. He defines inartistic proofs as arguments that the rhetor quotes using information from a non-self-generated source. Examples of these include laws, contracts, and [[oath]]s.&lt;ref name="classicalwriting.com"/&gt;

===Aristotle's rhetorical logos===
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|150px|Aristotle, 384–322 BC.]]
Following one of the other meanings of the word, [[Aristotle]] gave ''logos'' a different technical definition in the ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', using it as meaning argument from reason, one of the three [[modes of persuasion]]. The other two modes are ''[[pathos]]'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:πάθος|πᾰ́θος]]}}, {{transl|grc|páthos}}), which refers to persuasion by means of emotional appeal, "putting the hearer into a certain frame of mind";&lt;ref name="AR"&gt;Aristotle, ''Rhetoric'', in Patricia P. Matsen, Philip B. Rollinson, and Marion Sousa, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=R3iLyz9zd7cC&amp;pg=PA120 Readings from Classical Rhetoric]'', SIU Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-8093-1592-0}}, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[ethos]]'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἦθος|ἦθος]]}}, {{transl|grc|êthos}}), persuasion through convincing listeners of one's "moral character".&lt;ref name="AR"/&gt; According to Aristotle, ''logos'' relates to "the speech itself, in so far as it proves or seems to prove".&lt;ref name="AR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/rhetoric.1.i.html translation by W. Rhys Roberts], this reads "the proof, or apparent proof, provided by the words of the speech itself".&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of Paul Rahe:

{{Quote|For Aristotle, ''logos'' is something more refined than the capacity to make private feelings public: it enables the human being to perform as no other animal can; it makes it possible for him to perceive and make clear to others through reasoned discourse the difference between what is advantageous and what is harmful, between what is just and what is unjust, and between what is good and what is evil.&lt;ref name="PaulRahe"&gt;Paul Anthony Rahe, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zymp_kM33ZcC&amp;pg=PA21 Republics Ancient and Modern: The Ancien Régime in Classical Greece]'', University of North Carolina Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-8078-4473-X}}, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Logos'', ''pathos'', and ''ethos'' can all be appropriate at different times.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Garver, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PoXnLHQ5mgwC&amp;pg=PA114 Aristotle's Rhetoric: An art of character]'', University of Chicago Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-226-28424-7}}, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments from reason (logical arguments) have some advantages, namely that [[data]] are (ostensibly) difficult to manipulate, so it is harder to argue against such an argument; and such arguments make the speaker look prepared and knowledgeable to the audience, enhancing ''ethos''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} On the other hand, trust in the speaker—built through ''ethos''—enhances the appeal of arguments from reason.&lt;ref&gt;Garver, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Wardy]] suggests that what Aristotle rejects in supporting the use of ''logos'' "is not emotional appeal [[Per se (Latin)|per se]], but rather emotional appeals that have no 'bearing on the issue', in that the ''pathē'' [{{lang|grc|[[wikt:πάθη|πᾰ́θη]]}}, {{transl|grc|páthē}}] they stimulate lack, or at any rate are not shown to possess, any intrinsic connection with the point at issue—as if an advocate were to try to whip an [[antisemitic]] audience into a fury because the accused is Jewish; or as if another in drumming up support for a politician were to exploit his listeners's reverential feelings for the politician's ancestors".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wardy, "Mighty Is the Truth and It Shall Prevail?", in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=QkIn37h_TMUC&amp;pg=PA64 Essays on Aristotle's Rhetoric]'', Amélie Rorty (ed), University of California Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-520-20228-7}}, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle comments on the three modes by stating: 
{{Quote|Persuasion is clearly a sort of demonstration, since we are most fully persuaded when we consider a thing to have been demonstrated. Of the modes of persuasion furnished by the spoken word there are three kinds. ... Persuasion is achieved by the speaker's personal character when the speech is so spoken as to make us think him credible. ... Secondly, persuasion may come through the hearers, when the speech stirs their emotions. ... Thirdly, persuasion is effected through the speech itself when we have proved a truth or an apparent truth by means of the persuasive arguments suitable to the case in question.{{whose translation}}|Aristotle|''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]''|350&amp;nbsp;BC}}

===Stoics===
[[Stoic philosophy]] began with [[Zeno of Citium]] {{Circa|300&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}}, in which the ''logos'' was the active [[reason]] pervading and animating the [[Universe]]. It was conceived as material and is usually identified with [[God]] or [[Nature]]. The Stoics also referred to the ''seminal logos'' ("''[[logos spermatikos]]''"), or the law of generation in the Universe, which was the principle of the active reason working in inanimate [[matter]]. Humans, too, each possess a portion of the divine ''logos''.&lt;ref&gt;Tripolitis, A., ''Religions of the Hellenistic-Roman Age'', pp. 37–38. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stoics took all activity to imply a ''logos'' or spiritual principle. As the operative principle of the world, the ''logos'' was ''[[anima mundi]]'' to them, a concept which later influenced [[Philo of Alexandria]], although he derived the contents of the term from Plato.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wUF15rypDscC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=Anima+mundi+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Jwl8TP_xI8KSjAfUm-jSDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Anima%20mundi%20logos&amp;f=false ''Studies in European Philosophy''], by James Lindsay, 2006, {{ISBN|1-4067-0173-4}}, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; In his Introduction to the 1964 edition of [[Marcus Aurelius]]' ''[[Meditations]]'', the Anglican priest Maxwell Staniforth wrote that "''Logos'' ... had long been one of the leading terms of [[Stoicism]], chosen originally for the purpose of explaining how deity came into relation with the universe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcus Aurelius |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WV7Teosv0bIC |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=24 |isbn=0-14044140-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isocrates' logos===
Public discourse on ancient Greek rhetoric has historically emphasized Aristotle's appeals to ''logos'', ''pathos'', and ''ethos'', while less attention has been directed to [[Isocrates]]' teachings about philosophy and ''logos'',&lt;ref name="David M 2010"&gt;David M. Timmerman and [[Edward Schiappa]], ''Classical Greek Rhetorical Theory and the Disciplining of Discourse'' (London: Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010): 43–66&lt;/ref&gt; and their partnership in generating an ethical, mindful ''[[polis]]''. Isocrates does not provide a single definition of ''logos'' in his work, but Isocratean ''logos'' characteristically focuses on speech, reason, and civic discourse.&lt;ref name="David M 2010"/&gt; He was concerned with establishing the "common good" of [[Ancient Athens|Athenian]] citizens, which he believed could be achieved through the pursuit of philosophy and the application of ''logos''.&lt;ref name="David M 2010"/&gt;

==In Hellenistic Judaism==
{{See also|Hellenistic Judaism}}
In the [[Septuagint]] the term ''logos'' is used for the word of God in the creation of heaven in Psalm 33:6, and in some related contexts.

===Philo of Alexandria===
[[Philo]] ({{Circa|20&amp;nbsp;BC|50&amp;nbsp;AD|lk=on}}), a [[Hellenized Jew]], used the term Logos to mean an intermediary divine being or [[demiurge]].&lt;ref name="cdpPhilo"/&gt; Philo followed the Platonic distinction between [[Hylic|imperfect matter]] and perfect Form, and therefore intermediary beings were necessary to bridge the enormous gap between God and the material world.&lt;ref name="hpPhilo"&gt;[[Frederick Copleston]], ''A History of Philosophy'', Volume 1, Continuum, 2003, pp. 458–62.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Logos'' was the highest of these intermediary beings, and was called by Philo "the first-born of God".&lt;ref name="hpPhilo"/&gt;
Philo also wrote that "the Logos of the living God is the bond of everything, holding all things together and binding all the parts, and prevents them from being dissolved and separated".&lt;ref&gt;Philo, ''De Profugis'', cited in [https://archive.org/details/hellenismchristi00frieiala Gerald Friedlander, ''Hellenism and Christianity'', P. Vallentine, 1912, pp. 114–15.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato's Theory of Forms]] was located within the Logos, but the Logos also acted on behalf of God in the physical world.&lt;ref name="hpPhilo"/&gt; In particular, the [[Angel of the Lord]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Old Testament]]) was identified with the Logos by Philo, who also said that the Logos was God's instrument in the creation of the Universe.&lt;ref name="hpPhilo"/&gt;

==Christianity==
{{Main article|Logos (Christianity)}}
[[File:Prologus Ioanni Vulgata Clementina.jpg|thumb|''In principio erat verbum'', [[Latin (language)|Latin]] for ''In the beginning was the Word'', from the [[Clementine Vulgate]], [[Gospel of John]], 1:1–18.]]
In [[Christology]], the ''Logos'' ({{lang-el|Λόγος|lit='Word", "Discourse", or "Reason'}})&lt;ref&gt;Entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos {{lang|grc|λόγος}}] at [[LSJ]] online.&lt;/ref&gt; is a name or title of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]], seen as the pre-existent second [[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)#Christian_theology|person]] of the [[Trinity]]. The concept derives from [[John 1:1]], which in the [[Douay–Rheims]], [[King James Version|King James]], [[New International Version|New International]], and other versions of the [[Bible]], reads:
{{quote|In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|1:1|DRA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|1:1|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|1:1|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In the translations, "Word" is used for Λόγος, although the term is often used [[transliterated]] but untranslated in theological discourse.
The Koine Greek reads, "Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος, καὶ ὁ λόγος ἦν '''πρὸς τὸν θεόν''', '''καὶ θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος'''.(En arkhêi ên ho lógos, kaì ho lógos ên ''pròs tòn theón, kaì theòs ên ho lógos''.) The definite article is used with 'theos/god', making it 'God', and the second usage is indefinite (without an article), rendering it 'god'. Thus David Bentley Hart translates it as 'In the origin there was the Logos, and the Logos was present with GOD, and the Logos was god'.&lt;ref&gt;David Bentley Hart. ''The New Testament: A Translation''. Yale, 2017, ISBN 0-978-0-300-18609-3, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many ancient Greek scholars, including Dr. Bruce M. Metzger of Princeton (Professor of New Testament Language and Literature) explains that concepts of definite articles in English and Koine Greek are not similar: "In the New World Translation the opening verse of the Gospel according to John is mistranslated as follows: “Originally the Word was, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a god.” A footnote which is added to the first word, “Originally,” reads, “Literally, In (At) a beginning.” By using here the indefinite article “a” the translators have overlooked the well-known fact that in Greek grammar nouns may be definite for various reasons, whether or not the Greek definite article is present. A prepositional phrase, for example, where the definite article is not expressed, can be quite definite in Greek, [in Hebrew 10:31, "εις χειρας θεου ζωντος" is properly rendered (even by the New World Translation) with the definite article expressed twice, “into the hands of the living God.”] as in fact it is in John 1:1"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Metzger|first=Bruce M.|date=April 1953|title=The Jehovah'S Witnesses and Jesus Christ: A Biblical and Theological Appraisal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/004057365301000110|journal=Theology Today|volume=10|pages=65-85|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://believersweb.org/view.cfm?ID=729|title=WHAT GREEK SCHOLARS REALLY THINK!|last=|first=|date=2003|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.letusreason.org/jw38.htm|title=The dispute on Jn.1:1|last=|first=|date=2009|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhema==
The word ''logos'' has been used in different senses along with ''[[rhema]]''. Both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] used the term ''logos'' along with ''rhema'' to refer to sentences and propositions.&lt;ref name="Dinneen"&gt;''General linguistics'' by Francis P.

==Neoplatonism==
[[File:Plotinus and disciples.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Plotinus]] with his disciples.]]
[[Neoplatonist]] philosophers such as [[Plotinus]] ({{Circa|204/5|lk=on}}{{snd}}270&amp;nbsp;AD) used the term "Logos" in ways that drew on Plato and the [[Stoics]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael F. Wagner, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1ZJMzbtNFNsC&amp;pg=PA116 Neoplatonism and Nature: Studies in Plotinus' Enneads]'', Volume 8 of ''Studies in Neoplatonism'', SUNY Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-7914-5271-9}}, pp. 116–17.&lt;/ref&gt; but the term Logos was interpreted in different ways throughout Neoplatonism, and similarities to Philo's concept of Logos appear to be accidental.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Rist, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=n49OAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA84 Plotinus: The road to reality]'', Cambridge University Press, 1967, {{ISBN|0-521-06085-0}}, pp. 84–101.&lt;/ref&gt; The Logos was a key element in the [[meditation]]s of Plotinus&lt;ref&gt;''Between Physics and Nous: Logos as Principle of Meditation in Plotinus'', The Journal of Neoplatonic Studies, Volumes 7–8, 1999, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; regarded as the first Neoplatonist. Plotinus referred back to [[Heraclitus]] and as far back as [[Thales]]&lt;ref&gt;Handboek Geschiedenis van de Wijsbegeerte I, Article by Carlos Steel&lt;/ref&gt; in interpreting Logos as the principle of meditation, existing as the interrelationship between the [[hypostases]]—the [[soul]], the intellect (''[[nous]]''), and the [[Monad (philosophy)|One]].&lt;ref&gt;The Journal of Neoplatonic Studies, Volumes 7–8, Institute of Global Cultural Studies, Binghamton University, 1999, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Plotinus used a trinity concept that consisted of "The One", the "Spirit", and "Soul". The comparison with the Christian [[Trinity]] is inescapable, but for Plotinus these were not equal and "The One" was at the highest level, with the "Soul" at the lowest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jcg83ynsJEwC&amp;pg=PA311&amp;dq=plotinus+trinity&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Is18TLriMt6U4gakq5CGBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=plotinus%20trinity&amp;f=false] ''Ancient philosophy'' by Anthony Kenny 2007 {{ISBN|0-19-875272-5}} p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; For Plotinus, the relationship between the three elements of his trinity is conducted by the outpouring of Logos from the higher principle, and ''[[Eros (concept)|eros]]'' (loving) upward from the lower principle.&lt;ref&gt;''The Enneads'' by Plotinus, [[Stephen MacKenna]], John M.

==Islam==
{{Main article|Logos (Islam)}}
The concept of the ''logos'' also exists in [[Islam]], where it was definitively articulated primarily in the writings of the classical [[Sunni]] [[Sufism|mystics]] and [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]], as well as by certain [[Shi'a]] thinkers, during the [[Islamic Golden Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardet, L., "Kalām", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;Boer, Tj. de and Rahman, F., "ʿAḳl", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sunni Islam]], the concept of the ''logos'' has been given many different names by the denomination's [[metaphysician]]s, mystics, and philosophers, including ''ʿaql'' ("Intellect"), ''al-insān al-kāmil'' ("Universal Man"), ''kalimat Allāh'' ("Word of God"), ''haqīqa muḥammadiyya'' ("The Muhammadan Reality"), and ''nūr muḥammadī'' ("The Muhammadan Light").

===''ʿAql''===
One of the names given to a concept very much like the Christian Logos by the classical Muslim metaphysicians is ''ʿaql'', which is the "Arabic equivalent to the Greek {{lang|grc|[[nous|νοῦς]]}} ('intellect')."&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt; In the writings of the Islamic [[Neoplatonist]] philosophers, such as [[al-Farabi]] ({{Circa|872|950&amp;nbsp;AD}}) and [[Avicenna]] (d. 1037),&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt; the idea of the ''ʿaql'' was presented in a manner that both resembled "the late Greek doctrine" and, likewise, "corresponded in many respects to the Logos Christology."&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt;

The concept of Logos in Sufism is used to relate the "Uncreated" (God) to the "Created" (humanity). In Sufism, for the Deist, no contact between man and God can be possible without the Logos. The Logos is everywhere and always the same, but its personification is "unique" within each region. [[Jesus]] and [[Muhammad]] are seen as the personifications of the Logos, and this is what enables them to speak in such absolute terms.&lt;ref&gt;''Sufism: love &amp; wisdom'' by Jean-Louis Michon, Roger Gaetani 2006 {{ISBN|0-941532-75-5}} p. 242 [https://books.google.com/books?id=UVt-EvXnEC4C&amp;pg=PA243&amp;dq=Sufism+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PDR6TJKSGIel4Aai99nDBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Sufism%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BMNQNOHXKOMC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=Sufism+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PDR6TJKSGIel4Aai99nDBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Sufism%20logos&amp;f=false ''Sufi essays''] by Seyyed Hossein Nasr 1973{{ ISBN|0-87395-233-2}} p. 148]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the boldest and most radical attempts to reformulate the Neoplatonic concepts into Sufism arose with the philosopher [[Ibn Arabi]], who traveled widely in Spain and North Africa. His concepts were expressed in two major works ''The Ringstones of Wisdom'' (''Fusus al-Hikam'') and ''The Meccan Illuminations'' (''Al-Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya''). To Ibn Arabi, every prophet corresponds to a reality which he called a Logos ([[Kalimah]]), as an aspect of the unique Divine Being. In his view the Divine Being would have for ever remained hidden, had it not been for the prophets, with Logos providing the link between man and divinity.&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical encyclopaedia of Sufis'' by N. Hanif 2002 {{ISBN|81-7625-266-2}} p. 39 [https://books.google.com/books?id=2bhpr7RTLMAC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Sufism+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PDR6TJKSGIel4Aai99nDBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Sufism%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Arabi seems to have adopted his version of the Logos concept from Neoplatonic and Christian sources,&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Frazee, "Ibn al-'Arabī and Spanish Mysticism of the Sixteenth Century", ''Numen'' '''14''' (3), Nov 1967, pp. 229–40.&lt;/ref&gt; although (writing in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] rather than Greek) he used more than twenty different terms when discussing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Little |first=John T. |last2= |first2= |date=January 1987 |title=AL-INSĀN AL-KĀMIL: THE PERFECT MAN ACCORDING TO IBN AL-'ARAB? |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1478-1913.1987.tb02785.x/abstract |journal=The Muslim World |publisher=Hartford Seminary |volume=77 |issue=1 |pages=43–54 |doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.1987.tb02785.x |access-date=30 May 2016 |quote="Ibn al-'Arabi uses no less than twenty-two different terms to describe the various aspects under which this single Logos may be viewed."}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Ibn Arabi, the Logos or "Universal Man" was a mediating link between individual human beings and the divine essence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dobie  |first=Robert J. |date=17 November 2009 |title=Logos and Revelation: Ibn 'Arabi, Meister Eckhart, and Mystical Hermeneutics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rWVwT3UpthUC&amp;pg=PA225 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=The Catholic University of America Press  |page=225 |isbn= 081321677X |quote="For Ibn Arabi, the Logos or "Universal Man" was a mediating link between individual human beings and the divine essence."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Sufi writers also show the influence of the Neoplatonic Logos.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Henry Whinfield]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=l0vHUo0wnlgC&amp;pg=PR25 Masnavi I Ma'navi: The spiritual couplets of Maulána Jalálu-'d-Dín Muhammad Rúmí]'', Routledge, 2001 (originally published 1898), {{ISBN|0-415-24531-1}}, p. xxv.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15th century [[Abd al-Karīm al-Jīlī]] introduced the ''Doctrine of Logos and the Perfect Man''. For al-Jīlī, the "perfect man" (associated with the Logos or the Holy Prophet) has the power to assume different forms at different times and to appear in different guises.&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical encyclopaedia of Sufis'' by N.

In [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sufism, Şeyh Gâlib (d. 1799) articulates Sühan (Logos-''Kalima'') in his ''Hüsn ü Aşk'' (''Beauty and Love'') in parallel to Ibn Arabi's Kalima. In the romance, ''Sühan'' appears as an embodiment of Kalima as a reference to the Word of God, the Perfect Man, and the Reality of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Betül Avcı, "Character of ''Sühan'' in Şeyh Gâlib’s Romance, ''Hüsn ü Aşk'' (''Beauty and Love'')" ''Archivum Ottomanicum'', 32 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Relevance inline|date=March 2018}}

==Jung's analytical psychology==
[[File:Carl Jung (1912).png|thumb|150px|A 37-year-old [[Carl Jung]] in 1912.]]
[[Carl Jung]] contrasted the critical and rational faculties of logos with the emotional, non-reason oriented and mythical elements of ''eros''.&lt;ref&gt;''C.G. Jung and the psychology of symbolic forms'' by Petteri Pietikäinen 2001 {{ISBN|951-41-0857-4}} p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In Jung's approach, logos vs eros can be represented as "science vs mysticism", or "reason vs imagination" or "conscious activity vs the unconscious".&lt;ref&gt;''Mythos and logos in the thought of Carl Jung'' by Walter A. Shelburne 1988 {{ISBN|0-88706-693-3}} p. 4 [https://books.google.com/books?id=yV-ZE8pyZjkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=logos+jung&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2CJ5TMS0Od3NjAew14ijBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

For Jung, logos represented the masculine principle of rationality, in contrast to its female counterpart, ''[[eros (concept)|eros]]'':

{{Quote|Woman’s psychology is founded on the principle of ''Eros'', the great binder and loosener, whereas from ancient times the ruling principle ascribed to man is ''Logos''. The concept of ''Eros'' could be expressed in modern terms as psychic relatedness, and that of ''Logos'' as objective interest.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Jung, ''Aspects of the Feminine'', Princeton University Press, 1982, p. 65, {{ISBN|0-7100-9522-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jung attempted to equate logos and eros, his intuitive conceptions of masculine and feminine consciousness, with the [[alchemical]] Sol and Luna. Jung commented that in a man the lunar [[Anima and animus|anima]] and in a woman the solar [[Anima and animus|animus]] has the greatest influence on consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysgOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=jung+eros+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3CR5TLn_IqiM4gbNvYSUBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=jung%20eros%20logos&amp;f=false ''Aspects of the masculine'' by Carl Gustav Jung, John Beebe p. 85]&lt;/ref&gt; Jung often proceeded to analyze situations in terms of "paired opposites", e.g. by using the analogy with the eastern [[yin and yang]]&lt;ref&gt;''Carl Gustav Jung: critical assessments'' by Renos K. Papadopoulos 1992 {{ISBN|0-415-04830-3}} p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; and was also influenced by the Neoplatonists.&lt;ref&gt;See the Neoplatonic section above.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Mysterium Coniunctionis]]'' Jung made some important final remarks about anima and animus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In so far as the spirit is also a kind of "window on eternity"... it conveys to the soul a certain influx divinus... and the knowledge of a higher system of the world, wherein consists precisely its supposed animation of the soul.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And in this book Jung again emphasized that the animus compensates eros, while the anima compensates logos.&lt;ref&gt;''The handbook of Jungian psychology: theory, practice and applications'' by Renos K. Papadopoulos 2006 {{ISBN|1-58391-147-2}} p. 118 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Yt7FfLRi17kC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=logos+jung&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2CJ5TMS0Od3NjAew14ijBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=logos%20jung&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6196">'''Mini-Baccarat''' is a smaller, lower-stakes version of Punto banco [[Baccarat (card game)|Baccarat]]. Mini-Baccarat is different in that it is generally lower limits than baccarat. It is also different in that the player does not get to pick up the [[Playing_card|cards]], and the fact that the table is smaller in size.  Mini-Baccarat is popular in many [[casino]]s, especially among [[Asian people|Asian]] gamblers.&lt;ref name="holl_Mini"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Mini-Baccarat| work = Hollywood Casino Aurora| accessdate = 2016-03-12| url = http://www.hollywoodcasinoaurora.com/Casino/Tables/MiniBaccaratTutorial}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gami_Bacc"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Baccarat or Baccawreck?| author = The Analyst| work = gaming Today| date = 2016-03-01| accessdate = 2016-03-12| url = https://www.gamingtoday.com/articles/article/58942-Baccarat_or_Baccawreck#.VuSijOIrLak}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="casi_TheJ"&gt;{{Cite web| title = The Joys of Mini-Baccarat| author = Henry Tamburin| work = Casino Center| accessdate = 2016-03-12| url = http://www.casinocenter.com/the-joys-of-mini-baccarat/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In original Baccarat the banker deals two cards to the “punters” (players) and to himself, face-down from the shoe. If anyone has a count of eight or nine, they should turn their cards face-up and win immediately. A count of six or seven means a player must stand. In case the count is less than five a player has to pull out the third card. The banker must draw to a point under three, stand with a point above six. He can do either with a point of three to a player’s third-card nine or with a point of five to a player’s third-card four. In other case, the banker should draw or stand as dictated by the most-favorable odds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baccarat card game|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/baccarat-card-game|author= David Parlett|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica |date=Feb 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SlotsDoc Baccarat Tips|url=http://slotsdoc.com/|publisher=SlotsDoc|
date=Oct 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Baccarat, Mini-Baccarat is a comparing card game played between two hands, the "player" and the "banker". Each baccarat coup has three possible outcomes: "player" (player has the higher score), "banker" (banker has the high score), and "tie". It is strictly a game of chance, with no skill or strategy involved; each player's moves are forced by the cards the player is dealt.

==Valuation of hands==
In Mini-Baccarat, cards have a point value: cards two through nine are worth face value (in points); tens, jacks, queens and kings have no point value (i.e. are worth zero); aces are worth 1 point; [[Joker (playing card)|jokers]] are not used. Hands are valued according to the ''rightmost digit'' of the sum of their constituent cards. If the total of the cards is a two-digit number, ten is subtracted from the total value of the hand. So, a hand of a 7 and a 4 would be one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.baccarat.net/mini/|title=Card Values in Mini Baccarat|last=|first=|date=|website=Baccarat.net|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a hand consisting of 2 and 3 is worth 5, but a hand consisting of 6 and 7 is worth 3 (i.e., the 3 being the rightmost digit in the combined points total of 13).&lt;ref&gt;Mathematically, the value of a hand is the sum of its constituent cards modulo ten (with all numbers greater than ten, subtract 10 and return only the difference).&lt;/ref&gt; The highest possible hand value in baccarat is therefore nine.

==Tableau of drawing rules==
The Player and Banker are each dealt two cards. If either Player or Banker or both achieve a total of 8 or 9 with the first two cards (known as a "[[natural (gambling)|natural]]"), the coup is finished and the result is announced: Player win, a Banker win, or tie. Natural 9 beats natural 8. If neither the Player nor Banker is dealt a total of 8 or 9 in the first two cards, the tableau is consulted, first for Player's rule, then Banker's. 

*Player's rule
:If Player has an initial total of 0–5, he draws a third card. If Player has an initial total of 6 or 7, he stands.
*Banker's rule
:If Player stood pat (i.e., has only two cards), the banker regards only his own hand and acts according to the same rule as Player. That means Banker draws a third card with hands 0–5 and stands with 6 or 7.

If Player drew a third card, the Banker acts according to the following more complex rules:
* If Player drew a 2 or 3, Banker draws with 0–4 and stands with 5–7.
* If Player drew a 4 or 5, Banker draws with 0–5 and stands with 6–7.
* If Player drew a 6 or 7, Banker draws with 0–6 and stands with 7.
* If Player drew an 8, Banker draws with 0–2 and stands with 3–7.
* If Player drew an ace, 9, 10, or face-card, the Banker draws with 0–3 and stands with 4–7.

The casinos list these rules in a more easily remembered format as follows:

* If the banker total is 2 or less, then the banker draws a card, regardless of what the player's third card is.
* If the banker total is 3, then the bank draws a third card unless the player's third card was an 8.
* If the banker total is 4, then the bank draws a third card if the player's third card was 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
* If the banker total is 5, then the bank draws a third card if the player's third card was 4, 5, 6, or 7.
* If the banker total is 6, then the bank draws a third card if the player's third card was a 6 or 7.
* If the banker total is 7, then the banker stands.&lt;ref name="May1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=John May|title=Baccarat for the Clueless|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rg8oxjUMcFwC&amp;pg=PA40|year=1998|publisher=Carol Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8184-0604-1|pages=40–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomason1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Thomason|title=The Experts' Guide to Casino Games: Expert Gamblers Offer Their Winning Formulas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GYDarBcCNLUC&amp;pg=PA117|date=January 1997|publisher=Carol Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8184-0590-7|pages=117–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a player bets on tie and the hands tie, the player win 8:1 or 9:1 depending on the house rules.

The '''''Nāṭya Śāstra''''' ([[Sanskrit]]: नाट्य शास्त्र, ''Nāṭyaśāstra'') is a Sanskrit text on the [[performing arts]].&lt;ref name=katherineyoung20&gt;{{cite book|author1=Katherine Young |author2=Arvind Sharma |title=Her Voice, Her Faith: Women Speak on World Religions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xUoEw0IQvPEC |year=2004|publisher=Westview Press |isbn=978-0-8133-4666-3 |pages=20–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GuyBeckp138"&gt;{{cite book|author=Guy L.

It is also full of invocations to deities, acknowledging the divine origins of the arts and the central role of performance arts in achieving divine goals (...)".}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text is attributed to sage [[Bharata Muni]], and its first complete compilation is dated to between 200&amp;nbsp;BCE and 200&amp;nbsp;CE,{{Sfn|Natalia Lidova|2014}}{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|pp=xxiv, 19–20}} but estimates vary between 500&amp;nbsp;BCE and 500&amp;nbsp;CE.{{Sfn|Wallace Dace|1963|p=249}}

The text consists of 36 chapters with a cumulative total of 6000 poetic verses describing performance arts. The subjects covered by the treatise include dramatic composition, structure of a play and the construction of a stage to host it, genres of acting, body movements, make up and costumes, role and goals of an art director, the musical scales, musical instruments and the integration of music with art performance.{{Sfn|Sreenath Nair|2015}}{{Sfn|Emmie Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=3–4, 7–25}}

The ''Nāṭya Śāstra'' is notable as an ancient encyclopedic treatise on the arts,&lt;ref name="GuyBeckp138"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwartz2004p12"/&gt; one which has influenced dance, music and literary traditions in India.{{Sfn|Sunil Kothari|Avinash Pasricha|2001|p=117, 163}} It is also notable for its aesthetic [[Rasa (aesthetics)|"Rasa"]] theory, which asserts that entertainment is a desired effect of performance arts but not the primary goal, and that the primary goal is to transport the individual in the audience into another parallel reality, full of wonder, where he experiences the essence of his own consciousness, and reflects on spiritual and moral questions.&lt;ref name="Schwartz2004p12"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Meyer-Dinkgräfe |title=Approaches to Acting: Past and Present |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KiJn_o4R5MC |year=2005|publisher= Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-4411-0381-9|pages=102–104, 155–156}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text has inspired secondary literature such as Sanskrit [[bhasya]] (reviews and commentaries) such as by the 10th century [[Abhinavagupta]].{{Sfn|Ananda Lal|2004|p=308}}

==Etymology==
The title of the text is composed of two words, "Nāṭya" and "Śāstra". The root of the [[Sanskrit]] word ''Natya'' is ''Nat'' (नाट) which means "act, represent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chandra Rajan|title=Loom Of Time, Kalidasa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sj9hZYZrcFEC |year=1999|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-400078-4 |pages=29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''Shastra'' (शास्त्र) means "precept, rules, manual, compendium, book or treatise", and is generally used as a suffix in the [[India]]n literature context, for knowledge in a defined area of practice.&lt;ref name=lochtefeldshastra626&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), "Shastra" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N-Z, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 626; See also [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/2014/web/webtc/indexcaller.php?input=HK&amp;output=SktRomanUnicode&amp;citation=zAstra शास्त्र] in Monier William's Sanskrit-English Dictionary, 2nd Edition, Oxford University Press, Archived by Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition date of ''Natyashastra'' is unknown, estimates vary between 500 BCE to 500 CE.{{Sfn|Wallace Dace|1963|p=249}}{{Sfn|Natalia Lidova|2014}} The text may have started in the 1st millennium BCE,{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|pp=xxiv, 19–20}} expanded over time, and most scholars suggest, based on mention of this text in other Indian literature, that the first complete version of the text was likely finished between 200 BCE to 200 CE.{{Sfn|Natalia Lidova|2014}}{{Sfn|Sreenath Nair|2015}} The ''Natya Shastra'' is traditionally alleged to be linked to a 36,000 verse Vedic composition called ''Adibharata'', however there is no corroborating evidence that such a text ever existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Ghosh |first = Manomohan |title = Natyasastra |year = 2002 |isbn =81-7080-076-5|page =2 note 7–12|url= https://archive.org/stream/NatyaShastra/natya_shastra_translation_volume_1_-_bharat_muni#page/n87/mode/2up }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text has survived into the modern age in several manuscript versions, wherein the title of the chapters vary and in some cases the content of the few chapters differ.{{Sfn|Natalia Lidova|2014}} Some recensions show significant interpolations and corruption of the text,{{Sfn|Nina Mirnig|Peter-Daniel Szanto|Michael Williams|2013|p=350}} along with internal contradictions and sudden changes in style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kale Pramod |title=The Theatric Universe: (a Study of the Natyasastra) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRdNBKIHnjkC |date=1974 |publisher=Popular Prakashan|isbn=978-81-7154-118-8 |pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars such as PV Kane state that some text was likely changed as well as added to the original between the 3rd to 8th century CE, thus creating some variant editions, and the mixture of poetic verses and prose in a few extant manuscripts of ''Natyasastra'' may be because of this.&lt;ref name=kpramodp8/&gt;{{Sfn|Pandurang Vaman Kane|1971|pp=11–15}} According to Pramod Kale, who received a doctorate on the text from the University of Wisconsin, the surviving version of ''Natya Shastra'' likely existed by the 8th-century.&lt;ref name=kpramodp8/&gt;

The author of the ''Natya Shastra'' is unknown, and the Hindu tradition attributes it to the ''[[Rishi]]'' (sage) [[Bharata Muni|Bharata]]. It may be the work of several authors, but scholars disagree.&lt;ref name=kpramodp8&gt;{{cite book|author=Kale Pramod |title=The Theatric Universe: (a Study of the Natyasastra) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRdNBKIHnjkC |date=1974 |publisher=Popular Prakashan|isbn=978-81-7154-118-8 |pages=8–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Maurice Winternitz|2008|pp=9–10}} Bharat Gupt states that the text stylistically shows characteristics of a single compiler in the existing version, a view shared by [[Kapila Vatsyayan]].{{Sfn| Kapila Vatsyayan | 2001|p=6}}&lt;ref name=ghosh&gt;{{cite book|author = Manmohan Ghosh, ed. |title= Natyashastra,|publisher = [[Asiatic Society]], |location= Calcutta|year = 1950}} See introduction p. xxvi for discussion of dates&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Agni Purana]]'', a generic encyclopedia, includes chapters on dramatic arts and poetry, which follow the ''Natyashastra'' format, but enumerates more styles and types of performance arts, which states Winternitz, may reflect an expansion in studies of the arts by the time ''Agni Purana'' was composed.{{Sfn|Maurice Winternitz|2008|p=11}}

===Historical roots===
The ''Natyashastra'' is the oldest surviving ancient Indian work on performance arts.&lt;ref name="Schwartz2004p12"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan L. Schwartz |title=Rasa: Performing the Divine in India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-BXVSmT1WhMC |year=2004|publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-13144-5|pages=12–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roots of the text extend at least as far back as the ''Natasutras'', dated to around the mid 1st millennium BCE.{{Sfn|Ananda Lal|2004|p=16}}&lt;ref name="Lidova1994p111"&gt;{{cite book|author=Natalia Lidova |title=Drama and Ritual of Early Hinduism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TKarwqJJP0C |date=1994 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1234-5 |pages=111–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Natasutras'' are mentioned in the text of [[Pāṇini|Panini]], the sage who wrote the classic on [[Vyakarana|Sanskrit grammar]], and who is dated to about 500 BCE.&lt;ref name="Lidova1994p111"/&gt;{{Sfn|Farley P. Richmond|Darius L. Swann|Phillip B. Zarrilli|1993|p=30}} This performance arts related [[Sutra]] text is mentioned in other late Vedic texts, as are two scholars names Shilalin ([[IAST]]: Śilālin) and Krishashva (Kṛśaśva), credited to be pioneers in the studies of ancient drama, singing, dance and Sanskrit compositions for these arts.&lt;ref name="Lidova1994p111"/&gt;{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|pp=xxiv, xxxi–xxxii, 17}} The ''Natyashastra'' refers to drama performers as Śhailālinas, likely because they were so known at the time the text was written, a name derived from the legacy of the vedic sage Śilālin credited with ''Natasutras''.{{Sfn|Natalia Lidova|1994|p=112}} Richmond et al. estimate the ''Natasutras'' to have been composed around 600 BCE.{{Sfn|Farley P. Richmond|Darius L. Swann|Phillip B. Zarrilli|1993|p=30}}

According to Lewis Rowell, a professor of Music specializing on classical Indian music, the earliest Indian artistic thought included three arts, syllabic recital (''vadya''), melos (''gita'') and dance (''nrtta''),{{Sfn|Rowell|2015|p=9}} as well as two musical genre, ''Gandharva'' (formal, composed, ceremonial music) and ''Gana'' (informal, improvised, entertainment music).{{Sfn|Rowell|2015|pp=11-12}} The ''Gandharva'' subgenre also implied celestial, divine associations, while the ''Gana'' was free form art and included singing.{{Sfn|Rowell|2015|pp=11-12}} The Sanskrit musical tradition spread widely in the Indian subcontinent during the late 1st millennium BCE, and the ancient Tamil classics make it “abundantly clear that a cultivated musical tradition existed in South India as early as the last few pre-Christian centuries”.{{Sfn|Rowell|2015|pp=12-13}}

The art schools of Shilalin and Krishashva, mentioned in both the [[Brahmana]]s and the [[Kalpa (Vedanga)|Kalpasutras and Srautasutras]],&lt;ref name="Lidova1994p112"&gt;{{cite book|author=Natalia Lidova |title=Drama and Ritual of Early Hinduism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3TKarwqJJP0C |date=1994 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1234-5 |pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; may have been associated with the performance of vedic rituals, which involved storytelling with embedded ethical values.&lt;ref name="Lidova1994p112"/&gt; The [[Vedanga]] texts such as verse 1.4.29 of ''Panini Sutras'' mention these as well. The roots of the ''Natyashastra'' thus likely trace to the more ancient vedic traditions of integrating ritual recitation, dialogue and song in a dramatic representation of spiritual themes.&lt;ref name=varadpande45/&gt;{{Sfn|Maurice Winternitz|2008|pp=181–182}} The Sanskrit verses in chapter 13.2 of [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] (~800–700 BCE), for example, are written in the form of a riddle play between two actors.&lt;ref&gt;ML Varadpande (1990), History of Indian Theatre, Volume 1, Abhinav, {{ISBN|978-8170172789}}, page 48&lt;/ref&gt;

The most studied version of the text, consisting of about 6000 poetic verses, is structured into 36 chapters.{{Sfn|Natalia Lidova|2014}} The tradition believes that the text originally had 12,000 verses.{{Sfn|Natalia Lidova|2014}}{{Sfn|Emmie Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=1–25}} Somewhat different versions of the manuscripts exist, and these contain 37 or 38 chapters.{{Sfn|Maurice Winternitz|2008|p=7}}{{Sfn|Pandurang Vaman Kane|1971|p=11}} Predominant number of its verses are in precise [[Sanskrit prosody|Anustubh meter]] (4x8, or exactly 32 syllables in every ''shloka''), some verses are in Arya meter (a morae-based Sanskrit meter), and the text has some text that is in prose particularly in chapters 6, 7 and 28.{{Sfn|Maurice Winternitz|2008|p=7}}{{Sfn|Pandurang Vaman Kane|1971|pp=15–16}}

The structure of the text harmoniously compiles aspects of the theatrical arts into separate chapters.{{Sfn| Kapila Vatsyayan | 2001}} The text opens with the mythical genesis and history of drama, mentions the role of different Hindu deities in various aspects of the arts, and the recommended [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] (consecration ceremony) of a stage for performance arts.{{Sfn|Natalia Lidova|2014}}{{Sfn|Sreenath Nair|2015}}&lt;ref name="GuyBeckp138"/&gt; The text, states Natalia Lidova, then describes the theory of Tāṇḍava dance ([[Shiva]]), the theory of [[Rasa (aesthetics)|rasa]], of bhāva, expression, gestures, acting techniques, basic steps, standing postures.{{Sfn|Natalia Lidova|2014}}{{Sfn| Kapila Vatsyayan | 2001}}{{Sfn|Radhavallabh Tripathi|1991|pp=14–31}}

The "rasa theory" of ''Natyashastra'', states Daniel Meyer-Dinkgräfe, presumes that bliss is intrinsic and innate in man, it exists in oneself, that manifests non-materially through spiritual and personally subjective means.&lt;ref name=dmdp102/&gt;{{Sfn|Sreenath Nair|2015|pp=15–38, Section 1, Chapter by Vatsyayan}} Performance arts aim to empower man to experience this ''rasa'', or re-experience it.

The ''Natyashastra'' defines drama in verse 6.10 as that which aesthetically arouses joy in the spectator, through the medium of actor's art of communication, that helps connect and transport the individual into a super sensual inner state of being.{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|p=3}} The ''Natya'' connects through ''abhinaya'', that is applying body-speech-mind and scene, wherein asserts ''Natyashastra'', the actors use two practices of ''dharmi'' (performance), in four styles and four regional variations, accompanied by song and music in a playhouse carefully designed to achieve ''siddhi'' (success in production).{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|p=3}} Drama in this ancient Sanskrit text, thus is an art to engage every aspect of life, in order to glorify and gift a state of joyful consciousness.{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|p=5}}

The text discusses the universal and inner principles of drama, that it asserts successfully affects and journeys the audience to a supersensual state of discovery and understanding. The stories and plots were provided by the Itihasas (epics), the [[Puranas]] and the Kathas genre of Hindu literature.{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|p=5}}

The text states that the playwright should know the ''bhavas'' (inner state of being) of all characters in the story, and it is these bhavas that the audience of that drama connects with.{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|p=5}} The hero is shown to be similar to everyone in some ways, trying to achieve the [[Puruṣārtha|four goals]] of human life in Hindu philosophy, then the ''vastu'' (plot) emerges through the "representation of three worlds – the divine, the human, the demonic".&lt;ref name=sallybanesp27/&gt;{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|pp=5–19}} Drama has dharma, it has artha, it has kama, it has humor, fighting and killing. The best drama shows the good and the bad, actions and feelings, of each character, whether god or man.&lt;ref name=sallybanesp27/&gt;{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|pp=5–19}}

According to ''Natyashastra'', state Sally Banes and Andre Lepeck, drama is that art which accepts human beings are in different inner states when they arrive as audience, then through the art performed, it provides enjoyment to those wanting pleasure, solace to those in grief, calmness to those who are worried, energy to those who are brave, courage to those who are cowards, eroticism to those who want company, enjoyment to those who are rich, knowledge to those who are uneducated, wisdom to those who are educated.&lt;ref name=sallybanesp27/&gt;{{Sfn|Adya Rangacharya|1998}} Drama represents the truths about life and worlds, through emotions and circumstances, to deliver entertainment, but more importantly ethos, questions, peace and happiness.&lt;ref name=sallybanesp27&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sally Banes|author2=Andre Lepecki|title=The Senses in Performance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gLPBni9awkYC |year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-46070-0|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The function of drama and the art of theatre, as envisioned in ''Natyashastra'' states Daniel Meyer-Dinkgräfe, is to restore the human potential, man's journey of "delight at a higher level of consciousness", and a life that is enlightened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Meyer-Dinkgräfe |title=Approaches to Acting: Past and Present |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KiJn_o4R5MC |year=2005|publisher= Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-4411-0381-9|page=155|quote='''Quote:''' (...) "the function of the art of theatre, described in the Natyasastra is to restore full human potential, life in enlightenment. The concept of beauty in Indian tradition is, therefore, conceived and presented as the experience of delight at a higher level of consciousness."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text goes into specifics to explain the means available within dramatic arts to achieve its goals. Just like the taste of food, states ''Natyashastra'', is determined by combination of vegetables, spices and other articles such as sugar and salt, the audience tastes dominant states of a drama through expression of words, gestures and temperaments.{{Sfn|Ghosh|2002|pp=105–106}} These dominant states are love, mirth, sorrow, anger, energy, terror, disgust and astonishment. Further, states the text, there are 33 psychological states which are transitory such as discouragement, weakness, apprehension, intoxication, tiredness, anxiety, agitation, despair, impatience.{{Sfn|Ghosh|2002|pp=102, note the text lists all 33}} There are eight temperamental states that a drama can deploy to carry its message.{{Sfn|Ghosh|2002|pp=102–103}} The text describes four means of communication between the actors and the audience – words, gestures, dresses and ''aharya'' (make ups, cosmetics), all of which should be harmonious with the temperament envisioned in the drama.{{Sfn|Ghosh|2002|p=103}} The text discusses the dominant, transitory and temperamental states, for dramatic arts, and the means that an artist can use to express these states, in chapters 6 through 7.{{Sfn|Ghosh|2002|pp=103–147}}

The ''Natyasastra'' describes the stage for performance arts as the sacred space for artists, and discusses the specifics of stage design, positioning the actors, the relative locations, movement on stage, entrance and exit, change in background, transition, objects displayed on the stage, and such architectural features of a theatre; the text asserts that these aspects help the audience get absorbed in the drama as well as understand the message and the meaning being communicated.&lt;ref name=kpramodp13&gt;{{cite book|author=Kale Pramod |title=The Theatric Universe: (a Study of the Natyasastra) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRdNBKIHnjkC |date=1974 |publisher=Popular Prakashan|isbn=978-81-7154-118-8 |pages=13–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liu2016p222"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Mason |editor=Siyuan Liu|title=Routledge Handbook of Asian Theatre |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H1iFCwAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-27886-3 |pages=222–225 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Salter |title=Entangled: Technology and the Transformation of Performance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZBJbIP0fMr0C |date=2010 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-19588-1 |pages=xxii–xxiii }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 10th-century, [[Hindu temple]]s were designed to include stages for performance arts (for example, ''[[Koothambalam|kuttampalams]]''), or prayer halls (for example, ''namghar'') that seconded as dramatic arts stage, based on the square principle described in the ''Natyasastra'', such as those in the peninsular and eastern states of India.&lt;ref name="Liu2016p222"/&gt;

===Song and dance in arts===
The ''Natyasastra'' discusses Vedic songs, and also dedicates over 130 verses to non-Vedic songs.{{Sfn|Pandurang Vaman Kane|1971|pp=45–46}} Chapter 17 of the text is entirely dedicated to poetry and the structure of a song, which it states is also the template for composing plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan L. Schwartz |title=Rasa: Performing the Divine in India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-BXVSmT1WhMC |year=2004|publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-13144-5|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its chapter 31 asserts that there are seven types of songs, and these are ''Mandraka'', ''Aparantaka'', ''Rovindaka'', ''Prakari'', ''Ullopyaka'', ''Ovedaka'' and ''Uttara''.{{Sfn|Pandurang Vaman Kane|1971|p=46}} It also elaborates on 33 melodic [[alankara]]s in songs.{{Sfn|Emmie Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=29}} These are melodic tools of art for any song, and they are essential. Without these melodic intonations, states the text, a song becomes like "a night without the moon, a river without water, a creeper with a flower and a woman without an ornament".{{Sfn|Emmie Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=30}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Manjusree Tyagi|title=Significance of compositional forms in Hindustani classical music |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GXgHAQAAMAAJ |date=1997 |publisher=Pratibha |isbn=978-81-85268-63-7 |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; A song also has four basic architectural ''varna'' to empower its meaning, and these tone patterns are ascending line, steady line, descending line and the unsteady line.{{Sfn|Emmie Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=30}}

The ideal poem produces bliss in the reader, or listener. It transports the audience into an imaginative world, transforms his inner state, and delivers him to a higher level of consciousness, suggests ''Natyashastra''.&lt;ref name=schwartzrasa18&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan L. Schwartz |title=Rasa: Performing the Divine in India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-BXVSmT1WhMC |year=2004|publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-13144-5|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Great songs do not instruct or lecture, they delight and liberate from within to a state of godlike ecstasy.&lt;ref name=schwartzrasa18/&gt; According to Susan Schwartz, these sentiments and ideas of ''Natyashastra'' likely influenced the devotional songs and musical trends of the [[Bhakti movement]] that emerged in Hinduism during the second half of the 1st millennium CE.&lt;ref name=schwartzrasa18/&gt;

Indian dance (''nritta'', नृत्त) traditions, states Daniel Meyer-Dinkgräfe, have roots in the aesthetics of ''Natyashastra''.&lt;ref name=katherineyoung20/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Meyer-Dinkgräfe |title=Approaches to Acting: Past and Present |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KiJn_o4R5MC |year=2005|publisher= Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-4411-0381-9|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text defines the basic dance unit to be a ''karana'', which is a specific combination of the hands and feet integrated with specific body posture and gait (''sthana'' and ''chari'' respectively).{{Sfn|Sunil Kothari|Avinash Pasricha|2001|pp=117–118}}{{Sfn|Nina Mirnig|Peter-Daniel Szanto|Michael Williams|2013|pp=186–187}}  Chapter 4 describes 108 ''karanas'' as the building blocks to the art of dance.{{Sfn|Sunil Kothari|Avinash Pasricha|2001|pp=117–118}}{{Sfn|Nina Mirnig|Peter-Daniel Szanto|Michael Williams|2013|pp=174–177}} The text states the various movements of major and minor limbs with facial states as means of articulating ideas and expressing emotions.{{Sfn|Sunil Kothari|Avinash Pasricha|2001|pp=117–118}}{{Sfn|Ananda Lal|2004|pp=95–99}}

===Music and musical instruments===
The ''Natyashastra'' is, states Emmie Te Nijenhuis, the oldest surviving text that systematically treats "the theory and instruments of Indian music".{{Sfn|Emmie Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=3–4}} Music has been an integral part of performance arts in the Hindu tradition since its Vedic times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Guy L. Beck |title=Sacred Sound: Experiencing Music in World Religions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t-IeHbqAfSsC |year=2006|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press|isbn=978-0-88920-421-8 |pages=114–123 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the theories of music found in the ''Natyasastra'' are also found in many [[Puranas]], such as the [[Markandeya Purana]].{{Sfn|Emmie Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=3–4, 7–25}}

}}
The ancient Indian tradition, before the ''Natyashastra'' was finalized, classified musical instruments into four groups based on their acoustic principle (how they work, rather than the material they are made of).{{Sfn|Rowell|2015|pp=13-14}} The ''Natyashastra'' accepts these four categories as given, and dedicates four separate chapters to them, one each on stringed instruments (chordophones), hollow instruments (aerophones), solid instruments (idiophones), and covered instruments (membranophones).{{Sfn|Rowell|2015|pp=13-14}}

Chapters 15 and 16 of the text discuss [[Sanskrit prosody]] in a manner similar to those found in more ancient [[Vedanga]] texts such as the ''Pingala Sutras''.{{Sfn|Nina Mirnig|Peter-Daniel Szanto|Michael Williams|2013|pp=350–351}}{{Sfn|Ghosh|2002|pp=248–292}} Chapters 28 through 34 are dedicated to music, both vocal and instrument based.{{Sfn|Maurice Winternitz|2008|p=9, 654}} Chapter 28, discusses the harmonic scale, calling the unit of tonal measurement or audible unit as ''Śruti'',{{Sfn|Emmie Te Nijenhuis|1974|p=14}} with verse 28.21 introducing the musical scale as follows,&lt;ref&gt;NA Jairazbhoy (1985), [http://ethnomusicologyreview.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/prevol2.pdf Harmonic Implications of Consonance and Dissonance in Ancient Indian Music], Pacific Review of Ethnomusicology, University of California Los Angeles, pages 28–31&lt;/ref&gt;

The music theory in the ''Natyashastra'', states Maurice Winternitz, centers around three themes – sound, rhythm and prosody applied to musical texts.{{Sfn|Maurice Winternitz|2008|p=654}} The text asserts that the octave has 22 ''srutis'' or microintervals of musical tones or 1200 cents.{{Sfn|Emmie Te Nijenhuis|1974|p=14}} This is very close to the ancient Greek system, states Emmie Te Nijenhuis, with the difference that each ''sruti'' computes to 54.5 cents, while the Greek enharmonic quartertone system computes to 55 cents.{{Sfn|Emmie Te Nijenhuis|1974|p=14}} The text discusses ''gramas'' ([[Scale (music)|scales]]) and ''murchanas'' ([[Mode (music)|modes]]), mentioning three scales of seven modes (21 total), some of which are the same as the Greek modes.{{Sfn|Emmie Te Nijenhuis|1974|p=32-34}} However, the Gandhara-grama is just mentioned in ''Natyashastra'', while its discussion largely focuses on two scales, fourteen modes and eight four ''tanas'' ([[Musical note|notes]]).{{Sfn|Emmie Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=14–25}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Reginald Massey |author2=Jamila Massey |title=The Music of India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1FSBJWkZofsC |year=1996|publisher=Abhinav Publications |isbn=978-81-7017-332-8 |pages=22–25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richa Jain |title=Song of the Rainbow: A Work on Depiction of Music Through the Medium of Paintings in the Indian Tradition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p6OfAAAAMAAJ|year=2002|publisher=Kanishka |isbn=978-81-7391-496-6|pages=26, 39–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text also discusses which scales are best for different forms of performance arts.{{Sfn|Emmie Te Nijenhuis|1974|p=32-34}}

The ''Natyashastra'' describes from chapter 28 onwards, four types of regular musical instruments, grouping them as stringed giving the example of [[veena]], covered giving the example of drums, solid giving the example of cymbals, and hollow stating flutes as example.&lt;ref name="BaumerBrandon1993p117"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rachel Van M.

===Male and female actors===
The ''Natyashastra'' enshrines the male and female actors in any performance art to be the most important.&lt;ref name=kpramodp52/&gt; The brightness of performance, or its lack, impacts everything; a great play that is poorly performed confuses and loses the audience, while a play that is inferior in significance or meaning becomes beautiful to the audience when brilliantly performed, states ''Natyashastra''.&lt;ref name=kpramodp52&gt;{{cite book|author=Kale Pramod |title=The Theatric Universe: (a Study of the Natyasastra) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRdNBKIHnjkC |date=1974 |publisher=Popular Prakashan|isbn=978-81-7154-118-8 |pages=52–54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A performance art of any form needs auditors and director, states the text, whose role is to work together with the actors from the perspective of the audience and the significance or meaning the playwright of the art work is attempting to convey.&lt;ref name=kirkwood92/&gt;

The actor, states the text, should understand the three [[Guṇa]]s, that is ''Sattva'', ''Rajas'' and ''Tamas'' qualities, because human lives are an interplay of these.{{Sfn|Sreenath Nair|2015|pp=75–76}}&lt;ref name="HaneyMalekin2001p114"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Groden |author2=Martin Kreiswirth|author3=Imre Szeman|authorlink3=Imre Szeman |title=The Johns Hopkins guide to literary theory &amp; criticism |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=N6QRAQAAMAAJ |year=2005|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-0-8018-8010-0 |pages=518 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The actor must feel a specific state within, to express it without. Thus, states Daniel Meyer-Dinkgräfe, the guidelines in ''Natyasastra'' employ the ideas in [[Yoga]] school of Hindu philosophy, with concepts mirroring ''asanas'', ''pranayama'' and ''dhyana'', both for actor training and the expression of higher levels of consciousness.&lt;ref name="HaneyMalekin2001p114"/&gt;

===The goals of art: spiritual values===
The ''Natyashastra'' and other ancient Hindu texts such as the [[Yajnavalkya Smriti]] assert that arts and music are spiritual, with the power to guide one to [[moksha]], through empowering the concentration of mind for the liberation of the Self (soul, Atman).{{Sfn|Pandurang Vaman Kane|1971|pp=45–46}} These arts are offered as alternate paths (''marga'' or yoga), in strength similar to the knowledge of the [[Sruti]]s (Vedas and Upanishads).{{Sfn|Pandurang Vaman Kane|1971|pp=45–46}} Various medieval scholars, such as the 12th-century Mitaksara and Apararka, cite ''Natyashastra'' and Bharata in linking arts to spirituality, while the text itself asserts that beautiful songs are sacred and performance arts are holy.{{Sfn|Pandurang Vaman Kane|1971|pp=45–46}}

The goal of performance arts, states ''Natyashastra'' is ultimately to let the spectator experience his own consciousness, then evaluate and feel the spiritual values innate in him, and rise to a higher level of consciousness.&lt;ref name="Schwartz2004p12"/&gt;&lt;ref name=dmdp155/&gt; The playwright, the actors and the director (conductor) all aim to transport the spectator to an aesthetic experience within him to eternal universals, to emancipate him from the mundane to creative freedom within.&lt;ref name=dmdp102/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan L. Schwartz |title=Rasa: Performing the Divine in India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-BXVSmT1WhMC |year=2004|publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-13144-5|pages=14–15, 56–60, 96–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote= '''When is a play successful?'''
&lt;poem&gt;
''Drishtaphala'' [visible fruits] like banners or 
material rewards do not indicate success of
a play production.

Real success is achieved when the play is 
performed with skilled precision, 
devoted faith and pure concentration. 
To succeed, the artist must immerse the
spectator with pure joy of rasa experience.

The spectator's concentrated absorption and
appreciation is success.

|source =— Abhinavagupta on ''Natyasastra'' (Abridged)&lt;br&gt;Trans: Tarla Mehta{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|p=24}}}}
''[[Abhinavabharati|Abhinavabhāratī]]'' is the most studied commentary on ''Natyasastra'', written by [[Abhinavagupta]] (950–1020 CE), who referred to ''Natyasastra'' also as the ''Natyaveda''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Ghosh |first = Manomohan |title = Natyasastra |year = 2002 |isbn =81-7080-076-5 |page =2 note 3|url= https://archive.org/stream/NatyaShastra/natya_shastra_translation_volume_1_-_bharat_muni#page/n87/mode/2up }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Ananda Lal|2004|p=308, 492}} Abhinavagupta's analysis of ''Natyasastra'' is notable for its extensive discussion of aesthetic and ontological questions, such as "whether human beings comprehend performance arts as ''tattva'' (reality and truth in another plane), or is it an error, or is it a form of superimposed reality (''aropa'')?{{Sfn|Ananda Lal|2004|p=308, 492}}

Abhinavagupta asserts that ''Natyasastra'' and performance arts appeal to man because of "the experience of wonder", wherein the observer is pulled in, immersed, engaged, absorbed, and satisfied.{{Sfn|Dalal|2014|p=7}} The performance arts in ''Natyasastra'', states Abhinavagupta, temporarily suspends man from his ordinary world, transfers him into another parallel reality full of wonder, where he experiences and reflects on spiritual and moral concepts, and in there is the power of arts to transform the inner state of man, where the beauty of the art lifts him into the goals of [[Dharma]] (correct living, virtues, duties, right versus wrong, responsibilities, righteous).{{Sfn|Dalal|2014|p=7}} Abhinavagupta is also known for his [[Advaita Vedanta]] treatises and a commentary on the [[Bhagavad Gita]], where he touches upon the aesthetics in ''Natyasastra''.{{Sfn|Dalal|2014|p=1-2}}

The detailed ''Natyasastra'' review and commentary of Abhinavagupta mentions older Sanskrit commentaries on the text, suggesting the text was widely studied and had been influential.&lt;ref name=kpramodp10/&gt; His discussion of pre-10th century scholarly views and list of references suggest that there once existed secondary literature on the ''Natyasastra'' by at least Kirtidhara, Bhaskara, Lollata, Sankuka, Nayaka, Harsa and Tauta.&lt;ref name=kpramodp10/&gt; However, all text manuscripts of these scholars have been lost to history or are yet to be discovered.&lt;ref name=kpramodp10&gt;{{cite book|author=Kale Pramod |title=The Theatric Universe: (a Study of the Natyasastra) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRdNBKIHnjkC |date=1974 |publisher=Popular Prakashan|isbn=978-81-7154-118-8 |pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
[[File:Temple troglodytique dédié à Shiva (Badami, Inde) (14146091479).jpg|thumb|200px|The ''Natyashastra'' influenced other arts in ancient and medieval India. The dancing Shiva sculpture in [[Badami cave temples]] (6th–7th century CE), for example, illustrates its dance movements and ''Lalatatilakam'' pose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Archana Verma |title=Performance and Culture: Narrative, Image and Enactment in India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iAArBwAAQBAJ |year=2011|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |isbn=978-1-4438-2832-1 |pages=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The first chapter of the text declares that the text's origins came after the four Vedas had been established, and yet there was lust, covetousness, wrath and jealously among human beings.{{Sfn|Natalia Lidova|1994|p=113}} The text was written as a fifth Veda, so that the essence of the Vedas can be heard and viewed, in ''Natya'' form to encourage every member of the society to [[dharma]], [[artha]] and [[kama]]. The text originated to enable arts that influence the society and encourage each individual to consider good counsel, to explain sciences and demonstrate arts and crafts widely.{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|pp=8–9}}{{Sfn|Natalia Lidova|1994|pp=113–114}} The text is a guide and progeny of what is in the Vedas, asserts the ''Natysashastra''.{{Sfn|Natalia Lidova|1994|pp=113–114}} The text re-asserts a similar message in the closing chapter, stating for example, in verses 36.20–21 that performance arts such as drama, songs, music, and dance with music are equal in importance as the exposition of the [[Vedas|Vedic hymns]], and that participating in vocal or instrumental music once is superior to bathing in river Ganges for a thousand days.{{Sfn|Ghosh|2002|p=555}}

Nāṭyaśāstra, states Natalia Lidova, has been far more than "a mere compendium on drama". It provided the foundation of theatrical and literary works that followed, which shaped the post-Vedic culture.{{Sfn|Natalia Lidova|2014}} It has been an important source book of Hindu performance arts and its cultural beliefs regarding the role of arts in the social ([[dharma|dharmic]]) as well as the personal inner life of man in Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Schwartz2004p12"/&gt;&lt;ref name=dmdp155/&gt;&lt;ref name=kpramodp10/&gt;

The ''Natysashastra'' text has been influential in other arts. The 108 dance forms described in the ''Natyasastra'', for example, have inspired Shiva sculptures of the 1st-millennium BCE, particularly the [[Tandava]] style which fuses many of these into a composite image found at the [[Thillai Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram|Nataraja temple]] of Chidambaram.{{Sfn|Dalal|2014|p=278}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brenda Pugh McCutchen |title=Teaching Dance as Art in Education |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C0yjXGJ3EEoC |year=2006|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=978-0-7360-5188-0 |pages=450 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movements of dance and expression in the ''Natyashastra'' are found carved on the pillars, walls and gateways of 1st-millennium Hindu temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Burch Brown |title=The Oxford Handbook of Religion and the Arts |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GkvSAQAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-517667-4 |pages=192–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specifications provided in the ''Natyashastra'' can be found in the depiction of arts in sculpture, in icons and friezes across India.&lt;ref name="Schwartz2004p12"/&gt;

{{Quote|
[In Indian arts] the imagery of the [[Upanishads]] and the elaborate ritual of the [[Brahmana]]s is the ground plan for each of the arts, be it architecture, sculpture, painting, music, dance or drama. The artist repeats and chisels this imagery by giving it concrete shape through stone, sound, line or movement.

'''''PlayStation Official Magazine – Australia''''' is a video games magazine published by [[Citrus Media]]. The magazine was previously called "Official PlayStation 2 Magazine (Australia)" but changed its name to coincide with the release of the [[PlayStation 3]]. The magazine's title is often abbreviated to OPS.

OPS costs [[A$]]14.95 and comes with a custom made DVD with gaming trailers and other content. Although it shares the [[nameplate]] with other 'Official PlayStation' titles from around the world, PlayStation Official Magazine – Australia does not license content, and is written entirely in Australia. It is the only dedicated PlayStation magazine in Australia to be written locally.

Throughout China, many organizations have their workers gather outdoors before their shift for a '''pre-work assembly'''. They stand at attention in formation, wearing their work uniforms, grouped by position in the company. They face one or two managers, who give guidance,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coboto.net/newsd.php?nid=52&lt;/ref&gt; critique, or encouragement. Other assemblies engage in ''[[Guangchangwu]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lfnews.cn/mingzhutest/title3.html&lt;/ref&gt; A less common kind of assembly practices marching.

In public, urban settings, these assemblies are fairly common outside restaurants and hotels several minutes before the meal service begins.

The purpose of these assemblies is to build morale and cohesion among workers, while the physical exercise invigorates them. Although the assembly is considered a serious affair, the workers generally enjoy these gatherings.{{Cn|date=April 2017}}

{{Paranormal}}

A '''psychic detective''' is a person who investigates crimes by using purported [[paranormal]] [[psychic]] abilities. Examples have included [[postcognition]] (the [[paranormal]] perception of the past), [[Psychometry (paranormal)|psychometry]] (information psychically gained from objects), [[telepathy]], [[dowsing]], [[clairvoyance]], and [[remote viewing]]. In murder cases, psychic detectives may purport to be in communication with the spirits of the murder victims.

Although there are documented cases where individuals claiming psychic abilities have assisted police in solving crimes, there is considerable skepticism in regard to the general use of psychics under these circumstances.&lt;ref name="Association"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.critical-thinking.org.uk/paranormal/psychics/do-the-police-use-psychics.php |title=Do the UK police use psychics? |first=John |last=Jackson |date=29 March 2006 |publisher=Association for Critical Thinking (formerly known as the Association for Rational Inquiry) |accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Piet Hein Hoebens|Hoebens, Piet Hein]]; [[Marcello Truzzi|Truzzi, Marcello]]. (1985). ''Reflections on Psychic Sleuths''. In ''A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology'', ed. [[Paul Kurtz]]. Prometheus Books. pp. 631-643. {{ISBN|0-87975-300-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many police departments around the world have released official statements saying that they do not regard psychics as credible or useful on cases.

Many prominent police cases, often involving missing persons, have received the attention of alleged psychics. In November 2004, purported psychic [[Sylvia Browne]] told the mother of kidnapping victim [[Amanda Marie Berry|Amanda Berry]], who had disappeared 19 months earlier: "She's not alive, honey." Browne also claimed to have had a vision of Berry's jacket in the garbage with "DNA on it". Berry's mother died two years later believing that her daughter had been killed; Berry was found alive in May 2013 having been a kidnapping victim of [[Ariel Castro]] along with [[Michelle Knight]] and [[Gina DeJesus]]. After Berry was found alive, Browne received criticism for the false declaration that Berry was dead. Browne also became involved in the case of [[Shawn Hornbeck]], which received the attention of psychics after the eleven-year-old went missing on 6 October 2002. Browne appeared on ''[[The Montel Williams Show]]'' and provided the parents of Shawn Hornbeck a detailed description of the abductor and where Hornbeck could be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychic Sylvia Browne Wrongly Tells Missing Boy's Parents He's Dead|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yzz8vaZgE8|accessdate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Browne responded "No" when asked if he was still alive. When Hornbeck was found alive more than four years later, few of the details given by Browne were correct. Shawn Hornbeck's father, Craig Akers, has stated that Browne's declaration was "one of the hardest things that we've ever had to hear", and that her misinformation diverted investigators wasting precious police time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sylvia Browne DEAD WRONG on CNN 360 Live Anderson Cooper 02|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuPadpaTwKY&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychic Powers Debunked in Shawn Hornbeck Case?|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0701/19/acd.01.html|work=ANDERSON COOPER 360 DEGREES|accessdate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- "Amanda Berry" "Sylvia Browne" -- 27,000 hits (Sept 2018) --&gt;&lt;!-- "Shawn Hornbeck" "Sylvia Browne" -- 5,500 hits (Sept 2018) --&gt;

When Washington, D.C. intern [[Chandra Levy]] went missing on 1 May 2001, psychics from around the world provided tips suggesting that her body would be found in places such as the basement of a Smithsonian storage building, in the Potomac River, and buried in the [[Nevada]] desert among many other possible locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Horwitz|first=Sari|title=Who Killed Chandra Levy|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/metro/specials/chandra/ch5_2.html|accessdate=29 August 2011|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=11 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each tip led nowhere. A little more than a year after her disappearance, Levy's body was accidentally discovered by a man walking his dog in a remote section of Rock Creek Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Twomey|first=Steve|author2=Sari Horwitz|title=Chandra Levy's Remains Found in Park By Dog|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/18/AR2008061801755.html|accessdate=29 August 2011|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=23 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- "Chandra Levy" disappearance psychic -- 26,700 hits (Sept 2018) --&gt;

Following the disappearance of [[Elizabeth Smart]] on 5 June 2002, the police received as many as 9,000 tips from psychics (and others crediting visions and dreams as their source).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carla Baron, Psychic Detective?|url=http://www.iigwest.com/investigations/carla_baron/carla_report.html|publisher=[[Independent Investigations Group]]|accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to these tips took "many police hours", according to Salt Lake City Police Chief Lieutenant Chris Burbank. Yet, Elizabeth Smart's father, Ed Smart, concluded that: "the family didn't get any valuable information from psychics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nickell|first=Joe|authorlink=Joe Nickell|title=The Case of the Psychic Detectives|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|date=July–August 2005|volume=29.4|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/case_of_the_psychic_detectives/|accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smart was located by observant witnesses who recognized her abductor from a police photograph. No psychic was ever credited with finding Elizabeth Smart.&lt;!-- "Elizabeth Smart" disappearance psychic -- 16,000 hits (Sept 2018) --&gt;

In the case of the Long Island serial killer, the psychic said the body would be found in a shallow grave, near water and a sign with a G in it would be nearby. Despite the vagueness of this claim (the body was not in a shallow grave, water is everywhere in Long Island, and no sign with a G was nearby) the ''[[New York Post]]'' stated that the "Psychic Nailed it!". Describing the case, skeptic and author [[Benjamin Radford]] wrote: "more surprising than the psychic's failure is the fact that this information was described as an amazing success on over 70,000 websites without anyone realizing that she was completely wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychic Tip on Long Island Serial Killer?|url=http://news.discovery.com/human/psychic-tip-on-long-island-serial-killer.html|publisher=[[Discovery News]]|author = [[Ben Radford]]|accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- "long island serial killer" psychic -- 13,300 hits (Sept 2018) --&gt;

A body was located in the US by Psychic Annette Martin. Dennis Prado, a retired US paratrooper, had gone missing from his apartment and police had been unable to locate his whereabouts. With no further leads, the chief investigating officer, Fernando Realyvasquez, a sergeant with the Pacifica (California) Police, contacted psychic detective Annette Martin. Prado had lived near a large forest, some 2000 square miles. Martin was given a map, she circled a small spot on the map, about the size of two city blocks. She said that Prado had struggled for breath, had died, and his body would be there within the indicated area. She described the path he took, and where the body would be found. Although the area had been searched before and Prado had not been found, a search and rescue officer initiated a new search with the help of a search dog, as Martin suggested "A search dog is going to find him." They found the body covered with dirt at the location, as Martin had indicated. While the body had deteriorated, there was no evidence that he had been attacked and it is thought that he had likely died of natural causes, as she also indicated.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez, Liz.

In August 2010, Aboriginal elder Cheryl Carroll-Lagerwey claimed to have seen the location of a missing child, Kiesha Abrahams, in her dream. The missing child's disappearance was being investigated by police. She took them to a location where a dead body was found, however it was of an adult woman and not the body of the child.&lt;ref name="Arlington2010"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arlington|first1=Kim|title=Supernatural sleuths and the search for truth|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/supernatural-sleuths-and-the-search-for-truth-20101229-19a9z.html|accessdate=9 May 2016|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cuneo|first1=Clementine|title=Kiesha searchers stumble on corpse|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/kiesha-searchers-stumble-on-corpse/story-e6freuzi-1225904646931|accessdate=9 May 2016|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- "Cheryl Carroll-Lagerwey" "Kiesha Abrahams" -- 311 hits (Sept 2018) --&gt;

In [[Sydney]], Australia, in 1996, a [[Belgium|Belgian]]-born Sydney psychic, Phillipe Durant was approached by the fiancé of missing Paula Brown to help locate her. Durante told police the location of the body of Brown. She was found less than two kilometres of the spot he had indicated in [[Port Botany, New South Wales]], by a lorry driver who came across the body. "Even though the body was discovered purely by chance, the speculation by a clairvoyant appears to have been uncannily accurate", a police spokeswoman conceded. Durant had used a plumb bob and a grid map, combined with some hair from the victim.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Sarah. "Did Paula speak from the grave?

In 2001, the body of Thomas Braun was located by [[Perth]]-based Aboriginal clairvoyant Leanna Adams in [[Western Australia]]. Police had initially been unable to find the body. The family of Braun had been told to contact Adams, an Aboriginal psychic who lived in Perth. The Braun family had requested police to do a search based on Adams's directions but they had not assisted. Adams went to [[Alice Springs]] in the [[Northern Territory]], and took the family members directly to Braun's remains, a spot high on a ridge west of the town, some 20 kilometres out. The remains were not immediately identifiable. Police later confirmed the remains to be his using DNA testing.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Paul Milton "DNA test proves body was Braun's" Centralian Advocate, 23 February 2003 p3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson-Clarke, Charlie "Nyoongar Sees End to Tourist Mystery" The West Australian 14 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Glenn "I know where Falconio's body is" Northern Territory News 13 December 2002 p3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toohey, Paul "Searching for Peter Falconio" The Bulletin 8 March 2006 Volume 124; Number 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- "Thomas Braun" "Leanna Adams" -- 138 hits (Sept 2018) --&gt;

Noreen Renier claimed to have solved the murder of Kimberly McAndrew who was murdered August 12, 1989. Six years after McAndrew went missing the [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] Regional Police hired Renier to help. Renier gave the police three interviews which were recorded and obtained for review by Tampa Bay Skeptics founder Gary P. Posner. Using [[Psychometry (paranormal)|psychometry]] Renier claimed to channel the murder victim. After a long analysis of the tapes Posner states that Renier took the detectives "on a wild goose chase". All Renier's statements were misleading, vague or incoherent, never leading to anything solid that could be verified. Renier assured the police that the body would be found before Christmas saying it would be "a nice Christmas present for everybody". As of 2018 the body of Kimberly McAndrew has not been discovered and nothing that Renier said on the three recordings has assisted the police in any way.&lt;ref name="Posner 2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Posner |first1=Gary P. |title='Psychic Detective' Noreen Renier: The Grinch Who Stole Christmas from a Grieving Family |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=2017 |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=46-49 |publisher=Center for Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- "Noreen Renier" "Kimberly McAndrew" -- 42 hits (Sept 2018) --&gt; Recordings of Noreen Renier can be found here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Noreen Reiner Recordings |url=https://gpposner.com/Renier-Kimberly.html |publisher=Gary Posner |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official police responses==
Many police departments around the world have released official statements saying that they do not regard psychics as credible or useful on cases.

===In Australia===

Australian police, officially, in general have said that they do not accept assistance from psychics. This was in response to an Australian TV show ''[[Sensing Murder]]'' in which psychics attempt to crack unsolved murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

While official policy for police forces in Australia does not advocate the use of psychics for investigations, one former Detective Senior Constable, Jeffrey Little, has said police do use them "even though they officially say they don't".&lt;ref name="Arlington2010"/&gt; Additionally, police in NSW have used psychic Debbie Malone on a number of cases.&lt;ref name="Kamper"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hasham|first1=Nicole|title=Psychic's murder clues|url=http://www.illawarramercury.com.au/story/631391/psychics-murder-clues/|accessdate=9 May 2016|work=[[Illawarra Mercury]]|date=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While no evidence she has supplied has solved murders or missing investigations on their own,&lt;ref name="Kamper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cardy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomson|first1=Owen|title=Eyes wide shut|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&amp;sy=smh&amp;kw=eyes+wide+shut&amp;pb=all_pubs&amp;dt=selectRange&amp;dr=entire&amp;so=relevance&amp;sf=headline&amp;rc=150&amp;rm=200&amp;sp=nrm&amp;clsPage=1&amp;docID=SHD031221BR2725O694R|accessdate=9 May 2016|work=The Sun-Herald|date=21 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; her evidence had been used to corroborate theories, and in one case, included in a coroner's brief on a case.&lt;ref name="Kamper"/&gt; Little, in reference to one case she assisted on, felt her description of what happened was "exceptional", other officers also had been impressed by her assistance, while yet other NSW officers felt she had not helped solve any cases.

=== In the United Kingdom ===

In 2006, 28 British police forces responded to a query from the Association for Rational Inquiry to say that they did not and have never used psychics, one force saying "We are unaware of any inquiries significantly progressed solely by information provided by a psychic medium."&lt;ref name="Association"/&gt; In 2009, when the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] had denied the use of psychics and were then presented with emails suggesting the use of a psychic they made a press statement authorized by the senior investigating officer that was much more ambiguous: "We do not identify people we may or may not speak with in connection with inquiries. We are not prepared to discuss this further."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8369369.stm |title=Can psychics help to solve crime?? |accessdate=22 November 2009 |last=Barnes |first=Hannah |date=23 November 2009 |publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the United States ===

A 1993 survey of police departments in the 50 largest cities in the United States revealed that a third of them had accepted predictions from psychic detectives in the past, although only seven departments treated such information any differently from information from an ordinary source. No police department reported any instances of a psychic investigator providing information that was more helpful than other information received during the course of a case, since any information has to be proved, only information matching other evidence could be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skeptically.org/spiritualism/id10.html|title=Psychics: Do Police Departments Really Use Them?|last1=Ayers Sweat|first1=Jane|author2=Mark W Durm|date=Winter 1993|work=Skeptical Inquirer|accessdate=4 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/human/missing-persons-and-abductions-reveal-psychics-failures.html|title=Missing Persons and Abductions Reveal Psychics' Failures|last=Radford|first=Benjamin|authorlink=Ben Radford|date=10 May 2010|work=Science Daily|accessdate=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A follow-up study looking at small and medium-sized cities in the United States, found that psychics were called upon by the police departments of those cities even less frequently than large cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Durm|first1=Mark|title=Update: Psychics -- Do Police Departments Really Use Them in Small and Medium-Sized Cites?|year=1994|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=0-87975-880-5|pages=224–235|author2=Joe Nickell|authorlink2=Joe Nickell|author3=Jane Ayers Sweat}}&lt;/ref&gt; A former senior investigator for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] has stated that psychics may be used "as a last resort &lt;nowiki&gt;[and]&lt;/nowiki&gt; as an investigative tool with caution"&lt;ref&gt;John Douglas, Mark Olshaker, ''Mind Hunter: Inside the FBI's Elite Serial Crime Unit'', Pocket Books; 11th THUS edition (1 August 1996), p.137 {{ISBN|0-671-52890-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; for providing clues not directly admissible in the court of law such as a criminal's character, or the location of dead bodies.&lt;ref name="kessler270"&gt;Robert Kessler, Tom Schachtman, ''Whoever Fights Monsters: My Twenty Years Tracking Serial Killers for the FBI'', St. Martin's Paperbacks (15 March 1993) p.270. {{ISBN|0-312-95044-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noreen Renier, ''A Mind for Murder: The Real-Life Files of a Psychic Investigator'', Hampton Roads Pub Co; Revised edition (9 May 2008) p.13 {{ISBN|1-57174-573-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific studies==

A number of tests have been conducted on psychics detectives, using control groups, to try to establish any psychic ability relating to crime solving. One of the earliest was carried out by Dutch Police officer, Fillipus Brink in 1960. He conducted a year-long study of psychics, but found no evidence of any crime-solving abilities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiseman, Richard]] and West, Donald "An Experimental Test of Psychic Detection" The Police Journal p 19&lt;/ref&gt; Another study was conducted in 1982 where evidence from four crimes was given to three groups: psychic detectives, students and police detectives. The clues related to four crimes, two crimes that had been solved, and two that had not been. The study found no difference between the three groups in ability to indicate what crimes had been committed by looking at the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiseman, Richard]] and West, Donald "An Experimental Test of Psychic Detection" The Police Journal p 20&lt;/ref&gt; Some flaws in the scientific method were apparent in these two tests. A further test was conducted in 1997, this test focusing on improving on the scientific methods used in the previous tests. This study used two groups, one consisting of three students from the University of Hertfordshire, the other group consisting of three psychics (two psychic detectives and a non-detective psychic who had a media profile and had been endorsed by police due to his abilities). The two groups were shown three objects associated with three serious crimes. They then advocated theories, but once again, no difference was found in terms of the accuracy between the two groups.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiseman, Richard]] and West, Donald "An Experimental Test of Psychic Detection" The Police Journal p 24&lt;/ref&gt;

To assess the claims of psychic crime-solving, the [[Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal]] (now [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]) established a task force of investigators.&lt;ref name="Nickell 1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nickell|first=Joe|authorlink=Joe Nickell|title=Psychic Sleuths: ESP and Sensational Cases|year=1994|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, New York|isbn=0-87975-880-5|pages=251|editor=Joe Nickell}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group recorded many failures by psychics to provide useful information to criminal investigators, and felt that psychics may use "retrofitting" (or after-the-fact matching), offering vague clues, and then trying to retroactively fit them to details that are only discovered later.&lt;ref name="Nickell 1994"/&gt; In addition to cases of retrofitting, the apparent use of [[cold reading]] (a psychic's fishing for information while appearing to gain it paranormally), exaggeration, and examples where the psychic has used non-psychic sources of information, were also reviewed.&lt;ref name="Nickell 1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nickell 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nickell|first=Joe|authorlink=Joe Nickell|title=Adventures in Paranormal Investigation|year=2007|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|location=Lexington, Kentucky|isbn=0-8131-2467-0|pages=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, while being interviewed for the ''Skeptiko'' podcast, managing editor of [[Skeptical Inquirer]], [[Ben Radford]] challenged the host, Alex Tsakiris, to give him the best case for evidence of a psychic solving a crime. As Tsakiris had "repeatedly accused skeptical investigators of purposely choosing the weakest cases", Radford agreed to investigate in depth a case from any period in history, around the world, "that presented the gold standard for evidence". Tsakiris chose psychic Nancy Weber who, in 2006, appeared on an episode of the [[Biography Channel]] ''[[Psychic Detectives|Psychic Investigators]]''. Weber claimed to have helped the [[New Jersey]] police solve the 1952 serial murders of Amie Hoffman and Dierdre O'Brien. The police arrested James Koedatich in 1983 who was later found guilty of serial murder. ''Psychic Investigators'' interviewed Weber as well as the two police detectives she worked with, Hughes and Moore, who verified Weber had given them information "she could not have known".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepticality.com/the-great-psychic-detective-challenge/|title=''The Great Psychic Detective Challenge'' |work=[[Skepticality]] |date=19 May 2009 |accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skeptiko.com/151-science-journalist-ben-radford-believes-psychic-detective/|title=''151.

&lt;/ref&gt; Radford spent the next nine months reviewing the case, and he and Tsakiris re-interviewed the detectives as well as the psychic on the ''Skeptiko'' podcast.  Radford discovered that the detectives had not kept their notes from the case, and that their story had changed since the TV show aired. In fact, he found that their stories now contradicted the psychic's story. A further discovery by Radford using a New Jersey phone book from 1982 found that if the psychic had indeed given the detectives all the evidence she claimed she had, the police could have discovered the killer with a 15-minute search through the phone book. Radford believes that the police and the psychic "simply fell prey to [[confirmation bias]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://desertairpodcast.com/mp3/desert_air_017.mp3 |title=Episode #017 |publisher=Desert Air |date=4 December 2011 |accessdate=7 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402161703/http://desertairpodcast.com/mp3/desert_air_017.mp3 |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skeptiko.com/skepticality-hosts-skeptiko-blake-smith-ben-radford-karen-stolznow/|title=

==Critical commentary==

[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[Nightline]] ''[[Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction|Beyond Belief]]'' program for 17 August 2011 featured psychic detectives and their involvement with the case of Ali Lowitzer. Typical of missing person cases, families are approached by people claiming they will help bring the missing home. "They told me, I see trees, water, dirt...but it is all very vague" according to Susan Lowitzer a mother whose daughter has been missing since 26 April 2010. Retired [[FBI]] agent and ABC consultant Brad Garrett states, "In 30 years...I have never seen a psychic solve a mystery". [[JREF]] investigator and [[mentalist]] [[Banachek]] feels that psychic detectives take advantage of families, "...because of fame and money, [they] step in and try to act like an authority".  Banachek believes that not all psychic detectives are frauds, some are self-deluded and believe they are helping, but they "send police on wild-goose chases wasting precious time and resources". Psychic Georgia O'Conner states that Ali is dead, she was tortured and her body dismembered. When asked by ABC's [[JuJu Chang]] how can she tell parents this kind of information when she might be wrong, O'Conner replies "I can't let my ego get in the way of what I see". Despite the attention from psychic detectives Ali Lowitzer remains missing from her [[Spring, Texas]] home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/watch/primetime-nightline-beyond-belief/SH55131205/VD55140044/psychic-power |title=Primetime Nightline: Beyond Belief ''Psychic Power''|publisher=ABC Nightline|date=17 August 2011 |accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alexandrialowitzer.com/|title=Alexandria Lowitzer|publisher=|date=April 2010 |accessdate=4 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No psychic detective has ever been praised or given official recognition by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] or US national news for solving a crime, preventing a crime, or finding a kidnap victim or corpse.&lt;ref&gt;''The Blue Sense: Psychic Detectives and Crime'' by Arthur Lyons and [[Marcello Truzzi]], Ph.

The [[Australian Institute of Criminology]], Australia's official crime research agency, advises parents of missing children not to resort to using psychics who approach them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Australian Institute of Criminology|authorlink =Australian Institute of Criminology | title = Help for children and families | work = Missing children : advice, information and preventative action | year = 2004 | url = http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/crimprev/children/part2.html |accessdate=31 March 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070830121158/http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/crimprev/children/part2.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 30 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former FBI analyst and profiler Clint Van Zandt has criticized the use of psychic detectives and has stated that "What happens many times is that professed psychics allow themselves the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.

==Belief in psychic detectives==

Psychologists, researchers and other authors have posited a number of possible explanations for the belief that some can provide valuable crime information from psychic abilities.&lt;ref name="Wiseman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wiseman|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Wiseman|title=Paranormality: Why we see what isn't there|year=2011|publisher=Spin Solutions|isbn=978-0-9568756-2-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RadfordSPI"&gt;{{cite book |last=Radford|first=Benjamin|authorlink=Ben Radford|title=Scientific Paranormal Investigation|year=2010|publisher=Rhombus Publishing|isbn=978-0-936455-11-2|pages=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possible explanations include [[confirmation bias]] (or our natural tendency to favor information to confirm our beliefs), [[wishful thinking]] (which is the act of making decisions based upon what is appealing rather than reasoned), and ''retrofitting'' (or retroactively refining the specifics of a prediction after the facts are revealed).&lt;ref name="RadfordSPI" /&gt; The act of reinterpreting vague and nebulous statements made by psychic detectives is also referred to as the ''multiple out''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hines|first=Terence|title=Pseudoscience and the Paranormal|year=2003|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=1-57392-979-4|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking advantage of these cognitive limitations is the practice of [[cold reading]] which creates the illusion of knowing specific information.&lt;ref name="Wiseman" /&gt; Additionally, police detectives and other authors suggest that psychic detectives appear successful due to making common-sense or high-probability predictions such as finding bodies at dump sites or "near water."&lt;ref name="kessler270" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RadfordSPI" /&gt;

While police departments claim they do not seek out or use psychics to solve crimes, they must follow up on all credible tips. If police do not refute this theory then "many in the public continue to believe that psychics are secretly employed by law enforcement" If the police state they do not use psychics then psychics claim that the police do not want to "share the credit" and are just covering up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychic led police to Texas mass grave hoax? Police can't ignore a lead or tip even if it comes from a psychic |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43330115/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/psychic-led-police-texas-mass-grave-hoax/|publisher=[[MSN]]|author = [[Ben Radford]]|accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychic Fiasco: Texas Mass Murder Raid a Hoax|url=http://news.discovery.com/human/psychic-fiasco-texas-mass-murder-raid-a-hoax-110609.html|publisher=[[Discovery News]]|author = [[Ben Radford]]|accessdate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the use of psychics may simply reduce anxiety and fill the emotional needs of individuals who must be experiencing great stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alcock|first1=James|title=Afterword: An Analysis of Psychic Sleuths' Claims|year=1994|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=0-87975-880-5|pages=179–180|last2=Nickell|first2=Joe|authorlink2=Joe Nickell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shermer|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Shermer|title=Why People Believe Weird Things|year=1997|publisher=W.H. Freeman and Company|isbn=0-7167-3090-1|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
{{Main|Occult detective fiction}}
There is a long history of psychic detectives in [[horror fiction|horror]] and [[crime fiction]], and in other [[genre]]s as well. One of the earliest forms of the genre was the character Flaxman Low, created in 1897 by mother and son Kate and [[Hesketh Hesketh-Prichard]].&lt;ref name="Parker_p36-42"&gt;{{cite book|last=Parker|first=Eric|title=Hesketh Prichard|pages=36&amp;ndash;42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prichards wrote their stories at the behest of the press baron [[Sir Arthur Pearson, 1st Baronet|Cyril Pearson]] for his monthly ''[[Pearson's Magazine]]'', though they were disconcerted to find the tales promoted by Pearson as "real".&lt;ref name="Parker_p36-42"/&gt; The collected work was published as ''The Experiences of Flaxman Low'' in 1899.

Other literary examples include [[Jules de Grandin]] (created by [[Seabury Quinn]]), [[Doctor Occult]] (created by [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]]) and Agent Jasi McLellan created by Cheryl Kaye Tardif.

The popular TV show, ''[[Psych]]'' features a charlatan paranormal detective helping the [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] police with crimes that range from robberies to kidnappings to murders. However, the man actually uses an acute sense of observation he acquired as a child; a [[eidetic memory]]; excellent vision; and deduction and reasoning to solve cases, making a [[running gag]] of his claim to be a psychic.

In [[Douglas Adams]]'s ''[[Dirk Gently]]'' novels, the titular character—a "holistic" detective—is implied to have psychic powers on occasion. One incident involved Gently attempting to scam his university classmates into paying for a set of answers to an exam, supposedly obtained using psychic powers that Gently did not think he had. To his surprise, the answers he provided, which he thought he had produced randomly, turned out to be entirely correct. He was expelled as a result.

[[Peter F. Hamilton]] wrote a series of books about the ex-military psychic [[Greg Mandel]]. In the series, Greg was a retired special forces soldier created as part of an elite spec-ops unit, the Mindstar Brigade, in the 'English Army', having fought a vicious war in Turkey and helped a rebellion overthrow the People's Socialist Party at home. Having won the rebellion he then retired to Rutland, suddenly being called out of retirement by the rich heirhess Julia Evans to use his psychic talents to find the root of industrial espionage against her company, Event Horizon [an organisation that was also integral to the overthrow of the communist government]. The series not only focuses on Greg's abilities, but also the abilities of other psychics created as part of the Mindstar Programme, the effects of social and economic change throughout the 21st century, global warming and rapid scientific advances. Greg regularly uses his abilities both for interrogation and as an offensive weapon.

The episode "[[Bart the Murderer]]" of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' depicts a psychic joining the hunt to find [[Principal Skinner]].

The episode "[[Cartman's Incredible Gift]]" of ''[[South Park]]'' depicts a skeptical view of psychic detectives.

The manga and anime series ''[[YuYu Hakusho]]'' depicts a teenage boy named Yusuke Urameshi working as a Spirit Detective: a human who hunts down demons using psychic abilities.

'''Radio in [[Argentina]]''' is an important facet of the nation's media and culture. Radio, which was first broadcast in Argentina in 1920, has been widely enjoyed in Argentina since the 1930s. Radio broadcast stations totaled around 150 active [[AM broadcasting|AM]] stations, 1,150 [[FM broadcasting|FM]] stations, and 6 registered [[shortwave]] transmitters.&lt;ref name=gardel&gt;[http://www.mibuenosairesquerido.com/xArgentina6.htm Mi Buenos Aires Querido {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 24 million receivers were in use in 2000 (2.4 per household).&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica.

==History==
[[File:Tech install radio argentina.JPG|thumb|260px|Installations at ''LR5 Radio Splendid'' in Monte Grande in 1933.]]

Radio broadcasting enjoys a long and varied history in Argentina, tracing its origins to a 1910 stay in the southside Buenos Aires suburb of [[Bernal, Buenos Aires|Bernal]] by [[Guglielmo Marconi]], inventor of the [[wireless telegraph]]. There, he achieved a rudimentary radio transmission with a kite-mounted antenna connected to earphones. Argentine publisher [[José C. Paz]] later sponsored Marconi's radio transmission from Italy to Buenos Aires, the first transatlantic broadcast into South America.&lt;ref name=radio60&gt;''Argentine Radio: Over 60 years on the air.''

Three local medical students, led by [[Enrique Telémaco Susini|Enrique Susini]], began their own radio experiments in 1917 and, installing transmission equipment in Buenos Aires' Coliseo Theatre, they broadcast, on August 27, 1920, ''[[Parsifal]]'', the first opera on radio and only the second radio broadcast in the World.  These installations became [[LOR Radio Argentina]], the World's first formal radio station.  The number of receivers in the city at the time: around 20. This station was joined in 1922 by LOX, whose ad for the Los Andes Restaurant is probably the World's first on radio. Several more stations opened in Buenos Aires during Argentina's prosperous 1920s and growing numbers of artists signed contracts for live performances on the growing variety of [[radio drama]]s.

Leading stations at the time began broadcasting from the numerous, ornate [[Culture of Argentina#Theatre|theatre]] stages in Buenos Aires, including LR5 [[Radio Splendid]] (so named for the venue where its shows were produced, the [[El Ateneo Grand Splendid|Grand Splendid Theatre]]). Among the notable events broadcast live at the time was President [[Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear]]'s inaugural, in 1922, and the 1923 "bout of the century" in [[Polo Grounds]], [[New York City]], between [[Jack Dempsey]] and [[Luis Ángel Firpo]] for the World Heavyweight title.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elgrafico.com.ar/coberturas-historicas/1923-cuando-firpo-tiro-a-dempsey-fuera-del-ring-detalle.php ''El Gráfico'': Cuando Firpo tiró a Dempsey fuera del ring {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The medium's boom and the lucrative local [[Radio advertising|ad market]] allowed Susini to sell his station in 1930 to U.S. telecom giant [[ITT Corporation|ITT]] for US$200 million, a record at the time.  The visionary entrepreneur invested a part of the funds into [[Lumiton]] Studios, among the first to produce sound movies in the world.&lt;ref name=radio60/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2005/08/26/sociedad/s-04202.htm ''Clarín'': historia de la radio en la Argentina {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Argentine radio embraced [[Tango (music)|tango]] in the early 1930s, airing the work of orchestras such as [[Francisco Canaro]]'s and [[Julio de Caro]]'s; LR1-Mundo (referred to as LR1 for its being the first on the dial) became the standard for tango broadcasts. The decade saw the rise of [[Jaime Yankelevich]], a former radio valve distributor, as the dominant force in the medium, thorough [[Radio El Mundo]] (inaugurated in 1935), and [[Radio Belgrano]], which became the first in Argentina to broadcast through a chain of repeater stations, and the first to expand into late-night broadcasting. Buenos Aires was by then home to 25 stations (as many as in New York, a city, at the time, almost three times larger).&lt;ref name=radio60/&gt;  The state entered the radio market in 1937, with the inaugural of [[LRA Radio Nacional]] Radio Mitre became the first in Argentina to broadcast around the clock, in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2000/08/13/s-05301.htm ''Clarín'': Radio Mitre cumple 75 años {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luis Sandrini]]'s ''Felipe'' and other [[comedy]] shows became ratings leaders during the 1940s, and as most Argentines were still either [[Immigration in Argentina|immigrants]] or first and second generation Argentines, many revolved around the use of thickly accented [[ethnic humor]]. Some of the most popular were [[Niní Marshall]]'s characters, particularly ''Catita'' and ''[[Cándida (1939 film)]]''.&lt;ref name=cine&gt;[http://www.cinenacional.com/personas/index.php?persona=6067 Cine Nacional]&lt;/ref&gt; The trend was not without its detractors, however, and in 1943, the newly installed dictatorship of General [[Pedro Pablo Ramírez|Pedro Ramírez]] banned humor which "deformed the language," leading to exile for Marshall and numerous other radio stars.&lt;ref name=clarin&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/96/03/19/ninias.html ''Clarín'' {{es}}]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fioravanti (3).jpg|thumb|170px|Football announcer Fioravanti, who helped maintain radio's dominance in sports broadcasting after the advent of television.]]

Programming focused on [[Cosquín Festival|Argentine folk music]] and [[Peronist]] [[propaganda]] during the populist administration of President [[Juan Perón]], who met his influential wife, [[Eva Perón|Evita]], when the latter was a radio [[wikt:matinée|matinée]] star; among Perón's most compelling voices in support on the radio was Tango composer [[Enrique Santos Discépolo]], who also hosted political commentary shows. The public sector became increasingly involved in Argentine radio during Perón's 1946-55 presidency, and afterwards. All broadcast chains were [[nationalization|nationalized]], and state radio extended overseas in 1958 with the inaugural of the [[Radiodifusión Argentina al Exterior|Argentine Foreign Broadcasting Service]].  The station became only the third in the Western Hemisphere (after the [[Voice of America]] and [[Radio Canada International]]) to broadcast internationally and in several languages.&lt;ref name=radio60/&gt;

[[Television in Argentina]], which had been developed by Jaime Yankelevich in 1951 under state licence, eroded radio's listener base during the 1950s and '60s. A number of radio hosts, however, such as musician [[Jorge Raúl Batallé]], [[talent show]] host [[Roberto Galán]], and news and commentary hosts, such as [[Antonio Carrizo]], [[Cacho Fontana]], and [[Héctor Larrea]] (whose ''Rapidísmo'', from 1967, became influential to the Argentine [[morning show]] format) rivaled their television counterparts.
[[File:Demasiado tarde para lágrimas.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Alejandro Dolina and Adolfo Castelo were among those who helped shape Argentine radio after the lifting of censorship in the 1980s]]

[[Censorship]] also intensified, however, and a number of commentators had shows cancelled, notably [[Hugo Guerrero Marthineitz]], who hosted the intellectual interview program, ''El show del minuto''. The ''Comité Federal de Radiodifusión'' (COMFER) was established in 1972 to both regulate the growing number of unlicensed stations, as well as to increase state influence over the medium. The return of Juan Perón from exile led to a second round of nationalizations in 1974, including all major television stations. The Radio Broadcasting Law of 1980, which led to the privatization of 44 stations, touched off an era of state disinvolvement in Argentine radio, however, and helped lead to [[Consolidation (media)|corporate consolidation]] over the airwaves.  Many of these hitherto public radio stations (known by their acronym, LRA) had helped extend the medium into Argentina's then-remote far north and [[Patagonia]]. Argentine radio, was long dominated by [[AM broadcasting]] (only 22 [[FM broadcasting|FM]] stations were in service),&lt;ref name=radio60/&gt; and AM remained popular on the airwaves, even as FM stations grew to outnumber these in subsequent decades.

The [[Argentine general election, 1983|return of democracy]] in 1983 led to an unprecedented selection of news programs, and many became known for [[muck-raking]] exposés; some of the highest-rated included [[Magdalena Ruiz Guiñazú]], [[Santo Biasatti]], and [[Nelson Castro (journalist)|Nelson Castro]]. A number of new stations dedicated to [[Rock music]] and other forms of [[popular culture|pop culture]] also opened, notably ''Rock &amp; Pop'' (1985), led by [[Daniel Grinbank]]; the station became well known in the late 1980s for its irreverent ''Radio Bangkok'' program, hosted by [[Lalo Mir]]. [[Easy listening]] host [[Nora Perlé]] (''Canciones son amores''), ''Jazzología'' host [[Carlos Inzillo]], [[Variety show]] host [[Samuel Gelblung|Chiche Gelblung]] (''Edición Chiche''), and critic and raconteur [[Alejandro Dolina]] (''[[La venganza sera terrible]]''), also became prominent in radio broadcasting at this time.
[[File:Cuales2008.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Mario Pergolini]] (''middle'') hosts ''Cuál es?'']]

[[Football in Argentina|Football]] remained a perennial favorite on the Argentine radio, and some of the best-known announcers have included [[Joaquín Carballo Serantes|Fioravanti]], [[José María Muñoz]], [[Enrique Macaya Márquez]], [[Horacio Pagani (sportswriter)|Horacio Pagani]], [[Marcelo Araujo]], and [[Víctor Hugo Morales]], among many others.

'''Remodernist film''' developed in the United States and the United Kingdom in the early 21st century with ideas related to those of the international art movement [[Stuckism]] and its manifesto, [[Remodernism]]. Key figures are [[Jesse Richards]] and [[Peter Rinaldi]].

==Manifesto and philosophy==

On August 27, 2008, [[Jesse Richards]] published a 15-point [http://jesse-richards.blogspot.com/2008/08/remodernist-film-manifesto.html Remodernist Film Manifesto], calling for a "new spirituality in cinema", use of intuition in filmmaking, as well as describing the remodernist film as being a "stripped down, minimal, lyrical, punk kind of filmmaking". Point 4 is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Japanese ideas of [[wabi-sabi]] (the beauty of imperfection) and [[mono no aware]] (the awareness of the transience of things and the bittersweet feelings that accompany their passing), have the ability to show the truth of existence, and should always be considered when making the remodernist film.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are also several polemic statements made in the manifesto that criticize [[Stanley Kubrick]], filmmakers that shoot on digital video, as well as [[Dogme 95]].&lt;ref name="When The Trees Were Still Real"&gt;[http://jesse-richards.blogspot.com/2008/08/remodernist-film-manifesto.html "Remodernist Film Manifesto", When The Trees Were Still Real, August 27, 2008] Retrieved September 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In December, 2008, Turkish film magazine ''[[Bakiniz]]'' translated the manifesto into Turkish and soon after Polish magazine ''Red'' translated it into Polish.&lt;ref name=Bakiniz&gt;[http://www.bakiniz.com/remodernist-film-manifestosu/ "The Remodernist Film Manifesto", Bakiniz, December 28, 2008] Retrieved December 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Remodernist]] film calls for a return to emotional and spiritual meaning in cinema, as well as an emphasis on new ideas of narrative structure and subjectivity.

==History==
 
The idea of [[Stuckism]] in relation to filmmaking and photography started 2001 when [[Jesse Richards]] and [[Nicholas Watson]] began releasing work as The New Haven Stuckists Film Group. On March 8, 2008 their film ''Shooting at the Moon'' made its London premiere at [[Horse Hospital]] during its FLIXATION Underground Cinema Club event. Remodernist Film and Photography was founded by Richards and Smith in 2004.

Films later seen as Remodernist included ''Youngblood'' (1995) by [[Harris Smith (filmmaker)|Harris Smith]], ''[[Shooting at the Moon (film)|Shooting at the Moon]]'' (1998–2003) by [[Jesse Richards]] and [[Nicholas Watson]], and ''Medway Bus Ride'' (1999) by [[Wolf Howard]].&lt;ref name="Bakiniz"/&gt;

[[Amos Poe]] is part of the movement,&lt;ref name=bremer&gt;Bremer, Erin (April 2008).

:::::::::::I guess remodernist is the next variation of post-modernist, which is to take something that was in the culture before and then turn it into something else, like taking it out of context. So it's kind of what pop art was in a way. I was using Warhol as kind of a soup can. It's like redoing that but it's done in a completely remodernist way because it's using the technology and the sensibility of contemporary rather than nostalgia.&lt;ref name=bremer/&gt;

In late August, 2009, an International Alliance of Remodernist Filmmakers was started by [[Jesse Richards]] in order to promote discussion and collaboration amongst those following the manifesto.  The filmmakers include [[Jesse Richards]], [[Harris Smith (filmmaker)|Harris Smith]], Christopher Michael Beer, Dmitri Trakovsky, Kate Shults, [[Peter Rinaldi]] and Khurrem Gold of America, Roy Rezaali of Holland, [[Rouzbeh Rashidi]] of Iran and Dean Kavanagh of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jesse Richards|Richards, Jesse]]. [http://jesse-richards.blogspot.com/2009/08/international-alliance-of-remodernist.html "International Alliance of Remodernist Filmmakers"], When the Trees Were Still Real, August 25, 2009. Retrieved September 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October, 2009, with the intention "to further develop and explain Remodernist film concepts", a series of articles by [[Jesse Richards]], Peter Rinaldi and Roy Rezaali were published in the magazine [[MungBeing]].&lt;ref name="When The Trees Were Still Real2"&gt;[http://jesse-richards.blogspot.com/2008/08/remodernist-film-manifesto.html "Remodernist Film Manifesto", When The Trees Were Still Real, August 27, 2008] Retrieved October 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Richards said, "Remodernism rejected Postmodernism for its 'failure to answer or address any important issues of being a human being'", and that Remodernism is "about seeking truth, establishing meaningful connections" and "addressing the shadow".&lt;ref name=MungBeing2&gt;[http://www.mungbeing.com/issue_28.html?page=31&amp;sub_id=1567#1567 "Remodernist Film", MungBeing, October 4, 2009] Retrieved March 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In his essay ''Concepts and Craft in Remodernist Film'', Richards said that Remodernist film craft "embraces the amateur", involves the idea of filmmakers "teaching themselves to paint pictures, to try acting in their own movies and those of others (especially if they are shy), to be nude models for other artists, to meditate, worship if they are religious, to do things that affect their levels of consciousness, try things that make them nervous or uncomfortable, to go out and be involved in life, to find adventure, to jump in the ocean. I think that is the exploration of craft".&lt;ref name=MungBeing3&gt;[http://www.mungbeing.com/issue_28.html?page=32&amp;sub_id=1565#1565 "Remodernist Film", MungBeing, October 4, 2009] Retrieved October 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The article explains the differences between modernist, post-modernist and remodernist cinema, describing [[Robert Bresson]] and [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] as "early Remodernist filmmakers", and notes films that make emphasis of "small moments", including [[Bela Tarr]]'s film ''[[Satantango]]'', "...every moment of the film ''Satantango'' is a good example of this kind of exploration of "moments"- the film starts with a ten-minute shot following cows coming out of a barn and wandering around a run-down agriculture collective. These kinds of moments are all but ignored in most examples of modern cinema, and that's a terrible, terrible thing".

Richards says of Remodernist filmmaking:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe that the most effective way to really make subjective and authentic work involves an "addressing of the shadow" (as Billy Childish and Charles Thomson have described it). Now what does this mean exactly? It might mean that you are really obsessed with pubic hair, or maybe you are really embarrassed by a physical or mental disability that you try to hide, or like Billy Childish, you were abused as a child.   
    These things, these "shadows" that we are hiding within ourselves, need to be brought forth into the light of day - in our films, in our work, in our poetry.&lt;ref name="MungBeing"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another article, entitled ''A Quick Primer and History'', Richards relaxes the criticism in the manifesto against digital video, noting that it can "have a place in Remodernist cinema" but that it should be given a new language, and that it currently "mimic(s) film". The article also broadens the aim of the movement, explaining the common bond among Remodernist filmmakers being a search for truth, knowledge, authenticity and spirituality in their work, but having different approaches on achieving that goal.&lt;ref name=MungBeing4&gt;[http://www.mungbeing.com/issue_28.html?page=31#2219 "Remodernist Film", MungBeing, October 4, 2009] Retrieved October 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Rinaldi]], analyzes the manifesto and shares his "personal thoughts" on it in his essay, ''The Shore as seen from The Deep Sea''. Particularly, he defends the criticism of digital and later of [[Stanley Kubrick]], saying first, "for the most part, the "easiness" of video has led to degradation in the images created",&lt;ref name=MungBeing5&gt;[http://www.mungbeing.com/issue_28.html?page=34&amp;sub_id=1568#1568 "Remodernist Film", MungBeing, October 4, 2009] Retrieved October 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I think, for the most part, the generation that I grew up in had Kubrick as their Giant. His work has a mystical "perfectionism" that is awe-inspiring at times. This perfectionism is anathema to the Remodernist mentality and for many healthy reasons, this giant (or whatever giant towers over your work) must fall in our minds. We must become the giant.&lt;ref name="MungBeing"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The rest of the article draws direct connections between ideas in the manifesto and some Christian and Buddhist teachings.&lt;ref name="MungBeing"/&gt;

In June 2010, after publishing a letter from Richards about the Remodernist Film Manifesto on his site,&lt;ref name=RogerEbert.com:Letters&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100608/LETTERS/100609980/ "The Remodernist Film Manifesto", RogerEbert.com, June 9, 2010] Retrieved June 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; film critic [[Roger Ebert]] tweeted, "Much discussed on serious film blogs: The Remodernist Film Manifesto.

===In Passing, Feature-length collaboration===

In February 2010, the Australian film magazine ''[[Filmink]]'' announced the forthcoming production of a compilation feature film being made by members of the Remodernist film movement, which the magazine says “recalls art movements of the late 19th and early 20th centuries which saw artists attempting to strive toward artistic freedom and authenticity". The film, which will consist of ten-minute pieces by various members of the film movement “from around the globe”, is scheduled to premiere in December, 2010 in New York. Participating filmmakers include: [[Peter Rinaldi]], [[Kate Shults]], [[Rouzbeh Rashidi]], [[Dean Kavanagh]], [[Roy Rezaali]], Heidi Beaver and Christopher Michael Beer. Richards’ ''Remodernist Film Manifesto'' “forms the basis” of the joint project.&lt;ref name=Filmink&gt;[http://www.filmink.com.au/news/cinema-with-soul/ "Cinema with soul", Filmink, February 25, 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301025734/http://www.filmink.com.au/news/cinema-with-soul/ |date=March 1, 2010 }} Retrieved February 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's premiere was announced for November 13, 2011 at the Quad Cinemas in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="International Film Festival Manhattan"&gt;[http://www.iffmnewyork.com/] Retrieved November 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In the November 2011 print edition of ''[[Filmink]]'', film scholar, critic and programmer [[Jack Sargeant (writer)|Jack Sargeant]] wrote about the movement and ''In Passing'', referring to the movement as "the new personal cinema" and describing the evolution of "lyrical cinema" from the work of [[Andrei Tarkovsky]], [[Wim Wenders]], [[Jim Jarmusch]], [[Bela Tarr]] and through to the Remodernist filmmakers.

Sargeant goes onto describe ''In Passing'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The film is neither a fully experimental work, nor a movie fixated on classic narrative; rather, In Passing explores the passing of time and the relation of time to cinematic space. Often focusing on intimate yet small details – the table top exploration of a crustacean, the patter of rain on a window, cats at play, the ocean shot from a moving car, a couple looking into a camera knowing that the film they are making will fail – and finding something lyrically poignant and even personal within these transient moments. There are scenes in which people seem to vanish, no longer seen onscreen, yet the space they once occupied still resonates with their echoes, moving through the poetic sublime.In common with [[Wim Wenders]], [[Jim Jarmusch]] and [[Gus Van Sant]], and films like ''[[Meek's Cutoff (film)|Meek's Cutoff]]'', there is a sense of homesickness to the films that make up ''In Passing''. This sense of homesickness is not necessarily rooted in a sense of being away from home, but in the sense that even at home, the protagonists are still searching for their place within the day-to-day world.&lt;ref name=Sargeant&gt;[[Jack Sargeant (writer)|Jack Sargeant]] (November 2011), "The New Personal Cinema: From Lyrical Film to Remodernism", from: Filmink November, 2011.

'''Ridiculusmus''' is an award-winning&lt;ref name="housetheatre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://housetheatre.org.uk/companies/ridiculusmus-2/ |title=Ridiculusmus – house |publisher=Housetheatre.org.uk |date= |accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; British theatre company founded in 1992 by Angus Barr, Jon Haynes and David Woods.&lt;ref name="British Council" &gt;{{cite web|title=Ridiculusmus|url=http://www.britishcouncil.org/arts-performanceinprofile-2010-ridiculusmus.htm|work=April 2010|publisher=British Council|accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their work has been described as "seriously funny," "Dadaist" and "physical theatre." Theatre critic [[Ian Shuttleworth]] said that Ridiculusmus is "not so much rough theatre as completely dishevelled." Since 1996, the company has been led by Haynes and Woods as co-directors, and although the majority of their stage works in recent years have been [[two-hander]]s, they additionally work with a large pool of collaborators.

Their first few productions were adaptations of novels, but, apart from a two-man version of ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]],'' produced in 2005, since 1997 Haynes and Woods have devised and written all Ridiculusmus' plays. Some of these have been published by [[Oberon Books]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doollee.com/PlaywrightsR/ridiculusmus.html |title=Ridiculusmus – Playwright |publisher=Doollee.com |date=19 May 2011 |accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commissioned by the [[Barbican]], London.&lt;ref name="heraldscotland"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mary Brennan |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/music/ridiculusmus-bring-total-football-to-the-tron-glasgow.20506173 |title=Ridiculusmus bring Total Football to The Tron, Glasgow |publisher=Herald Scotland |date=19 March 2013 |accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early years ==

The founding members met as students at London's [[The Poor School|Poor School]] and while there they began [[busking]] on the [[London underground]] and doing comedy club open spots. They called themselves Mel, Pat &amp; Harm, and performed comic songs from the 1920s and 1930s to the accompaniment of Barr's ukulele. They also opened a [[Dadaist]] comedy club called The Tomato Club&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite web|author=John O'Mahony |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/feb/13/theatre1 |title=John O'Mahony meets the anarchic duo behind cult group Ridiculusmus &amp;#124; Stage |publisher=The Guardian |date=13 February 2008 |accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; above a couscous restaurant in [[Kentish Town]]. The highlight of the evening was the "tomato spot," in which comics were invited to perform deliberately bad material to an audience armed with over-ripe tomatoes. The listing in ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' said "Don't come," to which the magazine added "probably advice worth taking."

On graduating from The Poor School, Ridiculusmus filled a cancelled slot at London's [[Canal Cafe Theatre]] with a hastily produced adaptation of [[Jerome K. Jerome]]'s ''[[Three Men in a Boat]].'' It played to mixed reviews and encouraged the troupe to produce more adaptations; their next production was a [[promenade]] version of [[Flann O'Brien]]'s cult classic novel ''[[The Third Policeman]].'' Opening at Aras na Gael, the show, with free pints of The Wrastler stout given to any audience member bringing a bicycle part,&lt;ref name="theguardian" /&gt; became an instant small scale hit. Adding fellow Poor School graduates Kevin Henshall and Lucy Cuthbertson, the company grew to five members.  Finding it difficult to survive in London, Ridiculusmus began to tour, and jumped at an offer to be in residence at The Playhouse in [[Derry]], Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="heraldscotland" /&gt; A trio once again—Woods and Haynes adapted another O'Brien novel, ''[[At Swim-Two-Birds]]'',&lt;ref name="theguardian" /&gt; which toured widely.

== ''The Sister Mary Sessions'' ==

In 1996 Ridiculusmus broke away from the adaptation of novels and began writing and producing their own work. The development season in the Sister Mary room at the playhouse in Derry resulted in three self-authored pieces, ''School'', ''The Exhibitionists'' and ''Christmas.''

''The Exhibitionists'' went on to tour nationally and internationally over the next six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fishingheritage.org/bacarchive/items/show/17 |title=BAC Archive &amp;#124; Ridiculusmus Archive – Exhibitionists. Misc. Prog. Archive |publisher=Fishingheritage.org |date= |accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ARSEFLOP ==

In 1999 Woods and Haynes coined the [[acrostic]] [[mnemonic]] ARSEFLOP to articulate their working principles: Attitude, Reality, Sensitivity, Edge, Focus, Listen, Open Your Heart and Play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ridiculusmus.com/about-us/#more-29 |title=About us |publisher=Ridiculusmus |date= |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rayes|first=Honour|title=Ridiculusmus (Continued)|url=http://exeuntmagazine.com/features/ridiculusmus/2/|work=May 20, 2011|publisher=Exeunt|accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later works ==

Ridiculusmus has created seven more main stage works in the last 15 years: ''Say Nothing''; ''Ideas Men''; ''Tough Time, Nice Time''; ''Total Football'';  ''The World Mouse Plague''; ''The Eradication of Schizophrenia in Western Lapland'' and ''[http://www.ridiculusmus.com/shows/current-show/give-me-your-love-2 Give Me Your Love]''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ridiculusmus.com/category/shows/repertoire/ |title=Repertoire |publisher=Ridiculusmus |date= |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ridiculusmus|url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/funding/browse-regularly-funded-organisations/npo/ridiculusmus/|work=2012|publisher=Arts Council|accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/discover-more/artists/joanna-crowley |title=Joanna Crowley &amp;#124; National Theatre &amp;#124; South Bank, London |publisher=National Theatre |date= |accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="62488">[[File:Entrée de Jean II le Bon.jpg|thumb|300px|Entry of [[John II of France]] and [[Joan I of Auvergne]] into Paris after their [[coronation]] at [[Reims]] in 1350, later [[manuscript illumination]] by [[Jean Fouquet]]]]

The '''Royal Entry''', also known by various names, including '''Triumphal Entry''', [[Joyous Entry]], consisted of the ceremonies and festivities accompanying a formal entry by a ruler or his representative into a city in the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Early Modern Period]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Of course other cultures had equivalents, often even more spectacular, especially [[China]] and [[India]].&lt;/ref&gt; The entry centred on a procession carrying the entering prince into the city, where he was greeted and paid appropriate homage by the civic authorities. A feast and other celebrations would follow.

The Entry began as a gesture of loyalty and fealty by a city to the ruler, with its origins in the ''[[Adventus (ceremony)|adventus]]'' celebrated for Roman emperors, which were formal entries far more frequent than [[Roman triumph|triumph]]s. The first visit by a new ruler was normally the occasion, or the first visit with a new spouse. For the capital they often merged with the [[Coronation]] festivities, and for provincial cities they replaced it, sometimes as part of a '''Royal Progress''', or tour of major cities in a realm. (See also [[Itinerant court]], about this.)

From the [[late Middle Ages]]&lt;ref&gt;Earlier transformations of the [[Roman triumph]] in Late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages have been discussed by Michael McCormick, ''Eternal Victory: Triumphal Rulership in Late Antiquity, Byzantium and the Early Medieval West'' (Cambridge University Press) 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; entries became the occasion for increasingly lavish displays of [[Medieval pageant|pageant]]ry and [[propaganda]]. The devising of the [[iconography]], aside from highly conventional patterns into which it quickly settled,&lt;ref&gt;"A remarkably consistent visual and iconographical vocabulary" according to Roy Strong.&lt;/ref&gt; was managed with scrupulous care on the part of the welcoming city by municipal leaders in collaboration with the chapter of the cathedral, the university, or hired specialists. Often the greatest artists, writers and composers of the period were involved in the creation of temporary decorations, of which little record now survives, at least from the early period.

==Origins and development==
[[File:Taddeo Zuccari 003.jpg|thumb|left|250px|King [[Francis I of France]], [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V|Charles V]], and [[Alessandro Farnese (cardinal)|Cardinal Alessandro Farnese]] enter Paris under a [[Baldachin|canopy of estate]] in 1540, in a fresco by [[Taddeo Zuccari]].]]

The contemporary account from [[Galbert of Bruges]] of the unadorned  "Joyous Advent" of a newly installed [[Count of Flanders]] into "his" city of Bruges, in April 1127, shows that in  the initial stage, undisguised by fawning and triumphalist imagery that came to disguise it, an Entry was similar to a [[parley]], a formal truce between the rival powers of territorial magnate and walled city, in which reiteration of the city's "liberties" in the medieval sense, that is its rights and prerogatives, were set out in clear terms and legitimated by the presence of [[Relic|saintly relics]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"On April 5... at twilight, the king with the newly elected [[william of Ypres|Count William, marquis of Flanders]], came into our town at Bruges. The canons of [[St. Donatian's Cathedral|Saint Donatian]] had come forth to meet them, bearing relics of the saints and welcoming the king and new count joyfully in a solemn procession worthy of a king. On April 6... the king and count assembled with their knights and ours, with the citizens and many Flemings in the usual field where [[Reliquary|reliquaries]] and relics of the saints had been collected. And when silence had been called for, the charter of the liberty of the church and of the privileges of Saint Donatian was read aloud before all... There was also read the little charter of agreement between the count and our citizens... Binding themselves to accept this condition, the king and count took an oath on the relics of saints in the hearing of the clergy and people".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in James M. Murray, "the Liturgy of the Count's Advent in Bruges", ''City and Spectacle in Medieval Europe'', Barbara Hanawalt and Kathryn Reyerson, eds., 1994, p. 137; Murray compares this "political bargain" with a contemporary account of the similar ''Adventus Iocundus'' of April 1384.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The procession of a new Pope to Rome was known as a ''possesso''.  A ruler with a new spouse would also receive an Entry. The entry of Queen [[Isabeau of Bavaria]] into Paris in 1389 was described by the chronicler [[Froissart]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Ribemont, "L'entree d'Isabeau de Bavière à Paris: une fete textuelle pour Froissart," in ''Feste und Feiern'', pp. 515–24.&lt;/ref&gt; The Entries of [[Charles IX of France]] and his Habsburg queen, [[Elisabeth of Austria (1554–1592)|Elizabeth of Austria]], into Paris, March 1571, had been scheduled for Charles alone in 1561, for the ''entrate'' were typically celebrated towards the beginning of a reign,&lt;ref&gt;The entries made by [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand of Aragon]] late in his reign, at Naples (1506), Valencia (1507), Seville (1508) and Valladolid (1509 and 1513), serve as exceptions that were occasioned by his need for confirmative propaganda, following the arrival in Castile of Philip that resolved the succession crisis attendant on the death of Isabella, and Ferdinand's withdrawal into Aragon. (Tess Knighton and Carmen Morte García, "Ferdinand of Aragon's Entry into Valladolid in 1513: The Triumph of a Christian King" ''Early Music History'' '''18''' (1999:119–163) p. 123.)&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[French Wars of Religion]] had made such festivities inappropriate, until the peace that followed the Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye signed in August 1570.&lt;ref name="Victor E 1975"&gt;Victor E. Graham and W. McAllister Johnson, ''The Paris Entries of Charles IX and Elizabeth of Austria 1571'' (University of Toronto Press) 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the mid-14th century, the occasions were relatively simple.  The city authorities waited for the prince and his party outside the city walls, and after handing over a ceremonial key&lt;ref&gt;Lingering into modern times is the ceremonial presentation of the "[[Freedom of the city|key to the city]]" to an honoured guest.&lt;/ref&gt; with a "loyal address" or speech,&lt;ref&gt;At Charles V's entry into Genoa in 1533, a twelve-year-old girl, dressed as Victory and carrying a palm frond, delivered a suitable oration ''all'antica''— in Latin. (George L. Gorse, "An Unpublished Description of the Villa Doria in Genoa during Charles V's Entry, 1533" ''The Art Bulletin'' '''68'''.2 [June 1986:319–322]).&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps stopping to admire ''[[Tableau vivant|tableaux vivants]]'' such as those that were performed at the entry into Paris of Queen [[Isabeau of Bavaria]], described in detail by the chronicler [[Froissart]], conducted him through the streets which were transformed with colour, with houses on the route hanging tapestries and embroideries&lt;ref&gt;The richly worked hangings of a bed would serve.&lt;/ref&gt; or carpets&lt;ref&gt;Pile carpets were displayed on tables or on a dais; pile carpets were not usually trod under foot until the seventeenth century.&lt;/ref&gt; or bolts of cloth from their windows, and with most of the population lining the route.   At Valladolid in 1509
:''the town was so gay, so decked out in wealth and canopies and luxurious carpets, that not even Florence or Venice could match it. All the beautiful ladies were delighted to be on display and were definitely worth seeing, [and] everything was so brilliantly arrayed, that I, who am of the town and have never left it, could not recognize it.''&lt;ref&gt;Luís de Soto, chaplain of the king and coordinator of the Entry, quoted in Knighton and Morte García 1999:139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heraldic displays were ubiquitous: at Valladolid in 1509, the bulls in the fields outside the city were caparisoned with cloths painted with the royal arms and hung with bells.  Along the route the procession would repeatedly halt to admire the set-pieces embellished with [[motto]]es and pictured and living allegories, accompanied by declamations and the blare of trumpets&lt;ref&gt;At Valladolid in 1513 Ferdinand was welcomed with four pairs of [[kettledrums]], trumpets by the dozens, [[shawm]]s and [[sackbut]]s. "They made such a din that if a bird happened to fly past, they made it fall from the sky into the crowd", the chroncicler records. (Knighton and Morte Garcia 1999:125).&lt;/ref&gt; and volleys of artillery. The procession would include members of the [[three Estates]], with the nobility and gentry of the surrounding area, and the clergy and [[guild]]s of the city processing behind the prince.  From the mid-14th century the guild members often wore special uniform clothes, each guild choosing a bright colour; in [[Tournai]] in 1464 three hundred men wore large embroidered silk [[fleur de lys]] (the royal badge) on their chests and backs, at their own expense.&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Piponnier and Perrine Mane; ''Dress in the Middle Ages''; pp. 150–151, Yale UP, 1997; {{ISBN|0-300-06906-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The prince reciprocated by confirming, and sometimes extending, the customary privileges of the city or a local area of which it was the capital.  Usually the prince also visited the cathedral to be received by the bishop and confirm the privileges of the [[cathedral chapter]] also.&lt;ref name="Strong, 1984, p. 7"&gt;Strong, 1984, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; There a ''[[Te Deum]]'' would be customary, and music written for the occasion would be performed.

===Increasing elaboration===
[[File:Entrée de Charles V à Paris.jpg|thumb|[[Charles V of France]] enters Paris after his coronation at Rheims in 1364. Later depiction by [[Jean Fouquet]].]]
During the 14th century, as courtly culture, with the court of Burgundy in the lead,&lt;ref&gt;The refinements of court protocol and the magnificence of court entertainments of [[Philip the Good]] and [[Charles the Bold]] set courtly fashions for decades in the fifteenth century.&lt;/ref&gt; began to stage elaborate dramas re-enacting battles or legends as entertainment during feasts, the cities began to include in entry ceremonies small staged pageant "tableaux", usually organised by the guilds (and any communities of foreign merchants resident), and drawing on their growing experience of [[medieval theatre]] and [[medieval pageant|pageantry]].  Initially these were on religious themes, but "gradually these tableaux developed, through the fifteenth and into the sixteenth century, into a repertory of archways and street-theatres which presented variants of a remarkably consistent visual and iconographical vocabulary."&lt;ref name="Strong, 1984, p. 7"/&gt;  Fortune with her wheel, Fame and Time, the seven Virtues, both Christian and Classical, and the [[Nine Worthies]] and other Classical, Biblical and local heroes,&lt;ref&gt;At [[York]] in 1486 [[Henry VII of England]] was presented with the keys to the city by the mayor and the allegorical founder-figure of ''Eburak'', a phantom king conjured up by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s 12th-century [[The History of the Kings of Britain|history of the kings of Britain]] and embedded in civic cult (Gareth Dean, ''Medieval York'' 2008:50).&lt;/ref&gt; among whose number the honoree was now to be counted. As the tradition developed, the themes became more specific, firstly stressing the legitimacy of the prince, and his claim by descent, then setting before him the princely virtues and their rewards, which especially included the benefits to him of encouraging prosperous cities and provinces.

The procession might pause for allegorical figures to address it, or pass beside a [[family tree|genealogical tree]] or under a temporary classical-style [[triumphal arch]] with either painted figures or posed actors perching on it, standing in for statuary in the case of arches. Still more elaborate entertainments began to be staged during or after the civic feast, and by the mid-17th century these could be as spectacular as the staged naval battles, [[masque]]s, [[opera]]s and [[ballet]]s that courts staged for themselves.  The court now often had a major role in both designing and financing entries, which increasingly devoted themselves to the glorification of the [[absolute monarch]] as hero, and left the old emphasis on his obligations behind; "any lingering possibilities of its use as a vehicle for dialogue with the middle classes vanished".&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1984, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; At the third "triumph" at Valladolid  in 1509, a lion holding the city's coat-of-arms shattered at the King's arrival, revealing the royal arms: the significance could not have been lost, even on those unable to hear the accompanying declamation.&lt;ref&gt;Knighton and Morte García 1999:146&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 16th century, at dates differing widely by location, the [[tableau vivant]] was phased out and mostly replaced by painted or sculpted images, although many elements of street-theatre persisted, and small [[masque]]s or other displays became incorporated into the programmes.  The entry in 1514 of [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary Tudor]] to Paris, as Louis XII's new Queen, was the first French entry to have a single organizer; ten years before [[Anne of Brittany]]'s entry had been "largely medieval", with five stops for [[mystery play]]s in the streets.&lt;ref&gt;One Pierre Gringore, apparently appointed by the government. Baumgartner, Frederick J; ''Louis XII'', pp. 136 (Anne) and 240 (Mary), Alan Sutton Publishing Ltd, Stroud, 1994, {{ISBN|0-7509-0695-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Hundred Years' War]], the entry of the ten-year-old [[Henry VI of England]], to be crowned king of France in Paris, 2 December 1431, was marked with great pomp and heraldic propaganda. Outside the city he was welcomed by the mayor in a blue velvet ''[[houppelande]]'', his retinue in violet with scarlet caps, and representatives of the [[Parlement de Paris]] in red trimmed with fur. At the porte Saint-Denis the royal party were greeted with a grand achievement of the French arms that Henry claimed, gold [[Fleur de lis|fleurs de lis]] on an azure ground. The king was offered large red hearts, from which doves were released, and a rain of flowers pelted the procession. At the symbolic gateway, a [[canopy of estate]] embroidered with more gold lilies was erected over the young king, who was carried in a litter supported on six lances carried by men dressed in blue. Through the city there were welcoming pageants and allegorical performances: before the Church of the Innocents, a forest was erected, through which a captured stag was released and "hunted".&lt;ref&gt;The contemporary sources, including''The Chronicles of [[Enguerrand de Monstrelet]]'' (Thomas Johnes, tr., London 1810, vol. vii, p. 46ff) and the ''Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris'', are noted in the brief description in Walter Franz Schirmer, ''John Lydgate: a study in the culture of the XVth century'' 1979, p. 137; [[John Lydgate|Lydgate]] was called upon to provide texts for similar pageantry at home, such as the entry of Henry into London, 1434.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical influence===
[[File:Triunphus Caesaris plate 9 - Andreani.jpg|left|thumb|Later woodcut after [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], with hand-colouring, showing the culmination of the [[Triumphs of Caesar]].]]
Educated folk of the Middle Ages had close at hand an example of an allegorical series of entries at a wedding, in the frame story that opens [[Martianus Capella]]'s encyclopedic introduction to all one needed to know of the arts, ''On the Wedding of Philology and Mercury and of the Seven Liberal Arts.''  With the revival of Classical learning, Italian entries&lt;ref&gt;The bibliography of Italian Renaissance ''entrate'' is Bonner Mitchell, ''Italian Civic Pageantry of the High Renaissance: A Descriptive Bibliography of Triumphal Entries and Selected Other Festivals for State Occasions'' (Florence) 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; became influenced by literary descriptions of the [[Roman triumph]]. [[Livy]]'s account was supplemented by detailed descriptions in [[Suetonius]] and [[Cassius Dio]] of Nero's Greek Triumph,&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Nero'' 25; Cassius Dio lxiii.20.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Josephus]] of the Triumph of Titus.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''Jewish Wars'' vii. 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recherché sources were brought to bear; [[Aulus Gellius]]' ''Noctes Atticae'' furnished a detail that became part of the conventional symbolism: coronation with seven crowns. [[Boccaccio]]'s long poem ''Amorosa visione'' (1342–43), following the schema of a triumph, offered a parade of famous personages, both historical and legendary, that may have provided a model for [[Petrarch]], who elaborated upon Livy in an account of the triumph of [[Scipio Africanus]] and in his poem ''[[I Trionfi]]''.  [[Castruccio Castracani]] entered [[Lucca]] in 1326 riding in a chariot, with prisoners driven before him.  [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] entered [[Naples]] in 1443 seated on a triumphal car under a [[baldachin]], as is shown by a surviving [[bas-relief]]&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1984, p. 44 [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:NapoliMaschioAngioinoArcoLaurana3.jpg Picture of relief]&lt;/ref&gt; on the earliest, and still perhaps the most beautiful, permanent post-classical [[Triumphal arch]], which he built the same year.&lt;ref&gt;George L. Hersey, ''The Aragonese Arch at Naples, 1443–1475'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1973) summarises the scholarship on the Arch and reports eye-witness accounts of the Entry and pictorial illustrations.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Italian, specific meanings developed for ''trionfo'' as both the whole procession, and a particular car or cart decorated with a display or tableau; although these usages did not spread exactly to other languages, they lie behind terms such as "triumphal entry" and "triumphal procession".

The emphasis began to shift from the displays as static tableaux that were passed by a procession in festive but normal contemporary dress, to the displays' being incorporated in the procession itself, a feature also of the religious [[medieval pageant]]; the tableaux were mounted on ''carri'', the precursors of the float, and were now often accompanied by a costumed throng. The [[carnival]] parades of Florence that were refined to a high pitch in the late quattrocento set a high standard; they were not without a propaganda element at times, as in the lavish parades of Carnival 1513, following the not-universally welcomed return of the Medici the previous year; the theme of one pageant, more direct than subtle: ''The Return of the Golden Age''.&lt;ref&gt;Shearman 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; With the French invasions of Italy from 1494, this form of entry spread north. Cardinal Bibbiena reported in a letter of 1520 that the Duke of Suffolk had sent emissaries to Italy to buy horses and bring back to [[Henry VIII of England]] men who knew how to make festal decorations in the latest Italian manner.&lt;ref&gt;John Shearman, "The Florentine Entrata of Leo X, 1515" ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' '''38''' (1975:136–154) p. 136.  The arrival in England, via another route, of [[Artists of the Tudor court#The Tudor Serjeant Painters|"Antony Toto" and Bartlommeo Penni]] may have satisfied this need.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Piero della Francesca 047.jpg|thumb|right|[[Piero della Francesca]], 1472, [[Federico da Montefeltro]] and his wife in triumphal cars, hers drawn by [[unicorn]]s.]]

[[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V|Charles V]] was indulged in a series of Imperial ''entrate'' in Italian cities during the Habsburg consolidation after the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]], notably in Genoa, where Charles and his heir Philip made no less than five triumphal entries.&lt;ref&gt;In 1529, 1533, 1536, 1542 and 1548. (J. Jacquot, ed., ''Les fêtes de la Renaissance'' II: ''Fêtes et cérémonies au temps de Charles-Quint'', Paris 1960).&lt;/ref&gt; Impressive occasions like Charles V's Royal Entry into Messina in 1535 have left few concrete survivals,&lt;ref&gt;Sheila ffoliot&lt;!--ffoliot is correct--&gt; argues convincingly in ''Civic Sculpture in the Renaissance: Montorsoli's Fountains at Messina'' (Studies in Renaissance History, Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1984) that many features of [[Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli]]'s Fountain of Orion in Messina, which survives in much degraded condition, owe their origins to the programme for the Entry of 1535.&lt;/ref&gt;  but representations were still being painted on Sicilian wedding-carts in the 19th century.

After [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s great mural of the [[Triumphs of Caesar]] rapidly became known throughout Europe in numerous versions in [[old master print|print]] form, this became the standard source, from which details were frequently borrowed, not least by Habsburg rulers, who especially claimed the Imperial legacy of Rome.  Although Mantegna's elephants were difficult to copy,&lt;ref&gt;Oxen were disguised as elephants to draw one of the floats in the carnival parade given by Lorenzo di Piero de' Medici's fraternal company, the ''Broncone'', at Florence, 6 February 1513. (John Shearman, "Pontormo and Andrea Del Sarto, 1513" ''The Burlington Magazine'' '''104''' No. 716 [November 1962:450, 478-483] p. 478.).&lt;/ref&gt; chained captives, real or acting the part, were not, and elaborate triumphal carts, often pulled by "[[unicorn]]s" might replace the earlier canopy held over the prince on horseback.  The [[woodcut]]s and text of the ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'' of 1499 were another well-known source, and Petrarch's ''I Trionfi'' was printed in many illustrated editions; both were works of mythological allegory, with no obvious political content.  Entries became displays of conspicuous learning, often with lengthy Latin addresses, and the entertainments became infused with matter from the abstruse worlds of Renaissance [[emblem]]s and [[hermeticism]], to which they were very well suited.  In the world of Renaissance [[Neo-Platonism]], the assertion and acting-out of the glory and power of the prince might actually bring it about.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1984:40–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

A precocious example of the Entrata with a consistent and unified allegorical theme was the Entry of [[Pope Leo X|Medici pope Leo X]] into Florence, November 1515.&lt;ref&gt;Singled out by André Chastel, "Le lieu de la fête", in J. Jacquot, ed. ''Fêtes de la Renaissance'' (Paris 1956, vol. I:420), and described at length by John Shearman, "The Florentine Entrata of Leo X, 1515" ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' '''38''' (1975:136–154), from whose account these details are drawn.&lt;/ref&gt; All the city's artistic resources were drawn upon to create this exemplary Entry, to a planned programme perhaps devised by the historian [[Jacopo Nardi]], as [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]] suggested; the Seven Virtues represented by seven triumphal arches at stations along the route, the seventh applied as a temporary façade to the [[Florence Cathedral|Duomo, Santa Maria del Fiore]], which still lacked a permanent one.

===Propaganda===
Apart from the permanent theme of the reciprocal bonds uniting ruler and ruled, in times of political tension the political messages in Entries became more pointed and emphatic.  A disputed succession would produce a greater stress on the theme of legitimacy.  After the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], tension became a permanent condition, and most Entries contained a sectarian element.  After about 1540 French entries and Habsburg ones in the [[Low Countries]]&lt;ref&gt;The bibliography is John Landwehr, ''Splendid Ceremonies: State Entries and Royal Funerals in the Low Countries, 1550–1791: A Bibliography'' (Leiden 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; were especially freighted with implication, as the rulers' attempts to suppress Protestantism brought Protestant and Catholic populations alike to the edge of ruin.  But initially this increased the scale of displays, whose message was now carefully controlled by the court.
[[File:Pieter Paul Rubens - Ingresso trionfale di Enrico IV a Parigi - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|''Entry of Henry IV into Paris'', by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], 1628–30: an unfinished [[Baroque]] figuration of the allegory itself.]]

This transformation happened much earlier in Italy than in the North, and a succession of entries for Spanish Viceroys to the blockaded city of [[Antwerp]], once the richest in Northern Europe and now in steep decline, were "used by the city fathers to combine increasingly eulogistic celebrations of their Habsburg rulers with tableaux to remind them of the commercial ruin over which they presided."&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1984, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Pompa Introitus'' of the [[Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand]] into Antwerp in 1635, devised by [[Gaspar Gevartius]] and carried out under the direction of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], was made unmistakably pointed, and included [http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/pageview.aspx?strFest=0152&amp;strPage=220 a representation] of the god of commerce, [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], flying away, as a lamenting figure representing Antwerp points at him and looks imploringly out at the Viceroy, whilst beside her lie a sleeping sailor and a river god, representing the wrecked trade of the city from the blockading of the river [[Scheldt]].  Eventually the Viceroy managed to obtain the lifting of the ban on trade with the [[Indies]] which the entry had represented as Antwerp's only hope of escaping ruin; but by then the Spanish had agreed to the permanent blockade of the river.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1984, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Triomphe de Josaphat.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''Triumph of [[Jehoshaphat]]'', [[Jean Fouquet]], 1470–75.]]

In 1638, the occasion of the French queen mother [[Marie de Medici|Marie de Medici's]] triumphal entry into [[Amsterdam]] lent ''de facto'' international recognition of the newly formed [[Dutch Republic]], though she actually traveled to the Netherlands as an exile. Spectacular displays and water pageants took place in the city's harbor; a procession was led by two mounted [[trumpeter]]s; a large temporary structure erected on an artificial island in the [[Amstel River]] was built especially for the festival.  This building was designed to display a series of dramatic [[tableau vivant|tableaux]] in tribute to her once she set foot on the floating island and entered its [[pavilion]]. The distinguished poet and classicist [[Caspar Barlaeus]] wrote the official descriptive booklet, ''Medicea Hospes, sive descriptio publicae gratulationis, qua ... Mariam de Medicis, excepit senatus populusque Amstelodamensis''.  Published by Willem Blaeu, it includes two large folding engraved views of the ceremonies.

===Peace and war===
Although the essence of an entry was that it was supposed to be a peaceful, festive occasion, very different from the taking of a town by assault, several entries actually followed military action by the town against their ruler, and were very tense affairs.  In 1507 the population of [[Genoa]] revolted against the French who had conquered them in 1499, and restored [[Republic of Genoa|their Republic]].  [[Louis XII of France]] defeated the Genoan army outside the city, which then agreed a capitulation, including an entry which was followed by the execution of the [[Doge]] and other leaders of the revolt.  The gestural content was rather different from a peaceful entry; Louis entered in full armour, holding a naked sword, which he struck against the portal as he entered the city, saying "Proud Genoa! I have won you with my sword in my hand".&lt;ref&gt;Baumgartner, Frederick J; ''Louis XII'', pp. 185–7, Alan Sutton Publishing Ltd, Stroud, 1994, {{ISBN|0-7509-0695-2}} He had sent a small force into the city two days before, and though large fines were levied, the city was not sacked.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles V entered [[Rome]] in splendour less than three years after his army had [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacked the city]].  The famously troublesome citizens of [[Ghent]] revolted against [[Philip the Good]] [[Battle of Gavere|in 1453]] and Charles V [[Revolt of Ghent (1539)|in 1539]], after which Charles arrived with a large army and was greeted with an entry.  A few weeks later he dictated the programme of a deliberately humiliating anti-festival, with the burghers coming barefoot with nooses round their necks to beg forgiveness from him which, after imposing a huge fine, he consented to do.&lt;ref&gt;Wilenski:34–35&lt;/ref&gt;  The entries of Charles and his son Philip in 1549 were followed the next year by a ferocious anti-Protestant edict that began the repression that led to the [[Dutch Revolt|Revolt of the Netherlands]], in the course of which Antwerp was to suffer a [[Sack of Antwerp|terrible sack]] in 1576 and a [[Siege of Antwerp (1584–1585)|long siege]] in 1584–85, which finally ended all prosperity in the city.

===Decline===
[[File:Triumphal Arch in Gdansk.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Temporary [[triumphal arch]] in [[Gdańsk]] to celebrate the ceremonial entry of Queen [[Marie Louise Gonzaga]], 1646]]
During the 17th century the scale of entries began to decline.  There was a clear trend, led from [[Medici]] Florence, to transfer festivities involving the monarch into the private world of the court. The ''[[intermedio|intermezzi]]'' developed in Florence, the ''[[ballet de cour]]'' that spread from Paris, the English [[masque]], and even elaborate equestrian ballets all increased as entries declined.&lt;ref&gt;A major theme of Strong, 1984, summed up in pp. 171–3&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1628, when Marie de' Medici commissioned from Rubens a ''Triumphal Entry of Henri IV into Paris'', it was for a suite of grand decorations for her own palace,  [[Palais du Luxembourg|the Luxembourg]]; Rubens did not recreate historic details of the 1594 Royal Entry, but overleapt them to render the allegory itself (''illustration'').

The cultural atmosphere of Protestantism was less favourable to the Royal Entry. In the new Dutch Republic entries ceased altogether.  In England, part of the [[Accession Day tilt|Accession Day festivities]] in 1588, following the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] were especially joyous and solemn. Delaying the event a week to 24 November, Elizabeth rode in triumph, "imitating the ancient Romans" from her [[palace of Whitehall]] in the [[city of Westminster]] to enter the [[city of London]] at [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]]. She rode in a chariot
&lt;blockquote&gt;"made with four pillars behind, to have a canopie, on the top whereof was made a crowne imperiall, and two lower pillars before. whereon stood a [[Lion and Unicorn|lyon and a dragon]], supporters of the armes of England, drawn by two white horses"&lt;ref&gt;The quote and the description are from Roy C. Strong, "The Popular Celebration of the Accession Day of Queen Elizabeth I" ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' '''21'''.1/2 (January 1958:86–103) pp92f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] followed the triumphal car, leading the caparisoned and riderless horse of estate, followed by the ladies of honour. The windows of houses along the procession route up the [[Strand, London|Strand]] were hung with blue cloth. At Temple Bar, the official gate to the City, there was music and the Lord Mayor handed over the mace and received it again. In a "closet" constructed for the occasion, the Queen heard a festive service celebrated by fifty clergymen at [[St. Paul's Cathedral]] and returned in a torchlit procession in the evening.

Nevertheless, the entry of James I into London in 1604 was the last until the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of his grandson in 1660, after the [[English Civil War]].  The court of Charles I intensified the scale of private [[masque]]s and other entertainments, but the cities, increasingly at odds with the monarchy, would no longer play along.  The [[Duchy of Lorraine]], a great centre of all festivities, was swallowed up in the [[Thirty Years War]], which left much of Northern and Central Europe in no mood or condition for celebrations on the old scale.  In France the concentration of power in royal hands, begun by [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]], left city elites distrustful of the monarchy, and once Louis XIV succeeded to the throne, royal progresses stopped completely for over fifty years; in their place Louis staged his elaborate court [[fête]]s, redolent of cultural propaganda, which were memorialised in sumptupously illustrated volumes that the ''Cabinet du Roi'' placed in all the right hands.
[[File:GeorgeIVDublin.jpg|thumb|310px|Triumphal Entry of [[George IV of the United Kingdom]] into [[Dublin]], 1821, with temporary arch]]
Changes in the intellectual climate meant the old allegories no longer resonated with the population.  The assassinations of both [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] and [[Henry IV of France]], of [[William the Silent]] and other prominent figures, and the spread of guns, made rulers more cautious about appearing in slow-moving processions planned and publicised long in advance; at grand occasions for fireworks and illuminations, rulers now characteristically did no more than show themselves at a ceremonial window or balcony.  The visit of [[Louis XVI]] to inspect the naval harbour works at [[Cherbourg]] in 1786 seems, amazingly, to have been the first French entry of a King designed as a public event since the early years of Louis XIV well over a century before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Simon Schama|Schama, Simon]] | title=[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]] | page=57| location=New York | publisher=Alfred A. Knopf | year=1989 | isbn=0-394-55948-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though considered a great success, this was certainly too little and too late to avoid the catastrophe awaiting the French monarchy.

Ideologues of the [[French Revolution]] took the semi-private fête of the former court and made it public once more, in events like the ''[[Fête de la Raison]]''. Under Napoleon, the [[Treaty of Tolentino]] (1797) requisitioned from the Papacy a mass of works of art, including most of the famous sculptures of Roman antiquity in the Vatican. A Joyous Entry under the name of a fête was arranged for the arrival of the cultural loot in Paris, the carefully prepared ''Fête de la Liberté'' of 1798. With the increased sense of public security of the 19th century, Entries became grander again, on such occasions as the [[Visit of King George IV to Scotland]], where medieval revivalism makes its first appearance, along with much [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] romanticism, Queen Victoria's visits to Dublin and elsewhere, or the three [[Delhi Durbar]]s. On these occasions, though ceremonial acts remained meaningful, overt allegories never regained the old prominence, and the decorations receded into festive, but simply decorative affairs of flags, flowers and [[bunting (textile)|bunting]], the last remnant of the medieval show of rich textiles along the processional route.

Today, though many [[parade]]s and [[procession]]s have quite separate, independent origins, civic or republican equivalents of the Entry continue. They include [[Victory parade]]s, New York's traditional [[ticker-tape parade]]s and the [[Lord Mayor's Show]] in London, dating back to 1215 and still preserving the Renaissance car, or [[Float (parade)|float]] model. It is not frivolous to add that the specific occasion of the contemporary American [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade|Thanksgiving Day Parade]] or the [[Santa Claus parade]] is the triumphal entry into the city of [[Santa Claus]] in his sleigh.

===Artists===
[[File:HenriIIbetweenFrance&amp;Fame.jpg|thumb|240px|left|''[[Henry II of France]] between France and Fame'', [[engraving]] by [[Jean Duvet]],  may reflect a tableau from an occasion such as his Entry into Paris, 16 June 1549.]]
To the occasional irritation of modern [[art historian]]s, many of the great artists of the time spent a good deal of time on the ephemeral decorations for entries and other festivities, including [[Jan van Eyck]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]], [[Andrea del Sarto]], [[Perino del Vaga]],&lt;ref&gt;His frescoes for [[Villa del Principe]], executed in expectation of Charles V's ''entrata'' of 1533, bear witness to the vanished theme of the event: Neptune and the defeat of the Giants.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polidoro da Caravaggio]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]  and [[Rubens]].  For some court artists, such as [[Inigo Jones]] or [[Jacques Bellange]], it seems to have been their major occupation, and both [[Giulio Romano]] and [[Giorgio Vasari]] were very heavily engaged in such work.  Composers from [[Lassus]] and [[Monteverdi]] to [[John Dowland]], and writers such as [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]], [[Ronsard]], [[Ben Jonson]] and [[John Dryden|Dryden]] also contributed.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1983, p. 6 for most of these.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shakespeare]] does not seem to have written anything for such an occasion, but with Jonson he was one of a group of twenty gentlemen processing in ''The Magnificent Entertainment'', as the published record called the first entry of [[James I of England]] into London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0238 Festival Book]&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historians also detect the influence of the tableau in many paintings, especially in the late Middle Ages, before artists had trained themselves to be able to develop new compositions readily.&lt;ref&gt;Many of the best known examples, like the [[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)]] or the large ''Virgin of Einsiedeln'' by [[Master E.S]] relate to tableaus not from entries, but engravings by [[Jean Duvet]], who worked on at least two royal entries, may well do.&lt;/ref&gt;   In the Renaissance, artists were often imported from other cities to help with, or supervise, the works, and entries probably helped the dissemination of styles.

===Festival books===
A [[festival book]] is an account of festivities such as entries, of which there are many hundreds, often surviving in very few copies.  Originally manuscripts, often illustrated, compiled for prince or city, with the arrival of print they were frequently published, varying in form from short pamphlets describing the order of events, and perhaps recording speeches, to lavish books illustrated with [[woodcut]]s or [[engraving]]s showing the various tableaux, often including a fold-out panorama of the procession, curling to and fro across the page. The pamphlets were ephemera themselves; a printed description of two leaves describing the entry of Ferdinand into Valladolid, 1513, survives in a single copy (at Harvard) because it was bound with another text. A lost description of the ceremonious reception given by Louis XII to Ferdinand at Savona (June 1507) is only known from a purchase receipt of [[Ferdinand Columbus]].&lt;ref&gt;Knighton and Morte Garcia 1999:120f.&lt;/ref&gt;

These ''livrets'' are not always to be trusted as literal records; some were compiled beforehand from the plans, and others after the event from fading memories. The authors or artists engaged in producing the books had by no means always seen the entry themselves.  Roy Strong finds that they are "an idealization of an event, often quite distant from its reality as experienced by the average onlooker. One of the objects of such publications was to reinforce by means of word and image the central ideas that motivated those who conceived the programme."&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1984:47.&lt;/ref&gt;    One Habsburg entry was all but called off because of torrential rain, but the book shows it as it should have been.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip II into Antwerp in 1549 [http://www.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/habsburg.html British Library]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]], the playwright and author of the book on ''The Magnificent Entertainment'' for James I is refreshingly frank:
:''Reader, you must understand, that a regard, being had&lt;!--comma here instead?--&gt; that his Majestie should not be wearied with teadious speeches; A great part of those which are in this Booke set downe, were left unspoken; So that thou doest here receive them as they should have been delivered, not as they were.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/pageview.aspx?strFest=0238&amp;strPage=69 British Library online book]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ehrenpforte.kol.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of top (about 1/10 of the height) of the ''Triumphal Arch'' of Maximilian, coloured [[woodcut]], overall design by [[Albrecht Dürer]].]]
The [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian I]], went a step further, creating enormous virtual triumphs that existed solely in the form of print. The ''[[Triumphs of Maximilian]]'' (begun in 1512 and unfinished at Maximilian's death in 1519) contains over 130 large woodcuts by Dürer and other artists, showing a huge procession (still in open country) culminating in the Emperor himself, mounted on a huge car.  ''[[The Triumphal Arch]]'' (1515), the largest print ever made, at 3.57 x 2.95 metres when the 192 sheets are assembled, was produced in an edition of seven hundred copies for distribution to friendly cities and princes. It was intended to be hand-coloured and then pasted to a wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aic.stanford.edu/sg/bpg/annual/v14/bp14-07.html The American Institute for Conservation]; Figure 9 (and many later ones) show the Triumphal Car of Maximilian, and Figure 10 is the first appearance of the Arch&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditional tableau themes, including a large genealogy, and many figures of Virtues, are complemented by scenes of Maximilian's life and military victories.&lt;ref&gt;For all on Dürer's involvement: Giulia Bartrum, ''Albrecht Dürer and his Legacy'', (British Museum Press), 2002:194–7, {{ISBN|0-7141-2633-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Maximilian was wary of entries in person, having been locked up by his loyal subjects in [[Bruges]] in 1488 for eleven weeks, until he could pay the bills from his stay.&lt;ref&gt;A move the burghers were to regret when his son Charles V later took family revenge with an especially tough siege&lt;/ref&gt;

An early meeting between the festival book with travel literature is the [http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0097 account] of the visit in 1530 of the future [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]], then [[King of Hungary]] and [[Bohemia]] to [[Constantinople]].

===New World entries===
In Habsburg territories in the New World, the ''entradas'' of the [[Viceroy of Mexico]] were celebrated at his landing at [[Veracruz]] and at [[Mexico City]]; on the way, the ceremonial entry at the "second city", [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla de los Ángeles]], which were presented as late as 1696, served to promote an elite that self-identified strongly with Spain, and incurred expenses, which were borrowed from the ecclesiastic ''[[Cabildo (council)|cabildo]]'', that exceeded the annual income of the city. Printed commemorative pamphlets spelled out in detail the elaborately artificial allegories and hieroglyphic emblems&lt;ref&gt;Emblems were especially drawn from the much-reprinted and translated standard [[emblem book]]s of [[Andrea Alciati]] and [[Cesare Ripa]], which engendered a considerable Spanish emblem literature during the seventeenth century.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Entry, often drawn from astrology, in which the Viceroy would illuminate the city as the sun. In the 18th century, the Bourbon transformation of ''entrées'' into semi-private ''fêtes'' extended to Spanish Mexico: "While the event continued to be extravagant under Bourbon rule, it became more privatized and took place to a larger degree indoors, losing its street theater flavor and urban processional character."&lt;ref&gt;Nancy H. Fee, "La Entrada Angelopolitana: Ritual and Myth in the Viceregal Entry in Puebla de Los Angeles" ''The Americas'' '''52'''.3 (January 1996), pp. 283–320.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of entries==

*1356: the [[Joyous Entry]] into [[Brussels]], by [[Joanna, Duchess of Brabant|Joanna]] and her husband [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of Luxembourg]], upon her becoming Duchess of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]].  "Joyous Entry" is a common term for French or [[Netherlandish]] entries.  This one is famous because the [[Charter]] granted by the ruler to the Duchy came to assume a position in the history of the Low countries similar to that of the [[Magna Carta]] in England.
*1431: [[Henry VI of England]] returned to London after being crowned [[King of France]] in [[Paris]], then occupied by the English, and the arms of both crowns were prominently displayed.  Henry, then aged fifteen, was encountered by the "empresses" of "Nature, Grace and Fortune" who destowed various virtues and talents upon, then by fourteen maidens, representing the [[Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit]] and a further set.  After further tableaux, at [[Cheapside]] a fountain ran with wine (a particular speciality of London festivities) and large tableaux represented the genealogy of the King, and a complementary [[Tree of Jesse]] showing that of Christ. The finale was a huge tableau of Heaven, where God the Father, surrounded by saints and angels, addressed the King.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1984, pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;
*1443: [[Alfonso V of Aragon]]'s triumphal entry into Naples was "the earliest of the triumphal entries ''all'antica'' in Europe"&lt;ref&gt;Knighton and Morte García 1999:124, referencing C. Carandete, ''I triunfi nel primo rinascimento''  (Edizioni Rai 1963:20).&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most lathe-and-plaster painted triumphal arches, its permanent commemoration is the arch before the [[Castel Nuovo]]. The event, portraying Alfonso as a classical hero of Antiquity, set iconographic examples for his nephew in the Royal entries of Ferdinand of Aragon. The published account by [[Antonio Beccadelli (poet)|Antonio Beccadelli, "Il Panormita"]], circulated widely.

*1494: For [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]]'s entry into Florence, which occasioned the temporary eclipse of Piero de' Medici, [[Filippino Lippi]] collaborated with [[Perugino]] on the decors.&lt;ref&gt;Discussed by Eva Borsook, "Decor in Florence for the Entry of Charles VIII of France", ''Mitteilungen des Kunsthistorisches Institutes in Florenz'' '''10''' (1961:106–22, 217).&lt;/ref&gt;
*1513: [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand of Aragon]]'s triumphal entry into Valladolid, taking the conquest of [[Navarre]] as an occasion for allegorical displays of regal power in "an unusually lavish and explicitly propagandist entry".&lt;ref&gt;Knighton and Morte García 1999:120.&lt;/ref&gt;
*1515: The triumphal entry of the [[Pope Leo X|Medici Pope Leo X]] into Florence is one of the most thoroughly documented entries, both in official records and private journals— though the visual and musical components are lost— and has attracted a separate monograph, by Ilaria Ciseri.&lt;ref&gt;Ilaria Ciseri, ''L'ingresso trionfale di Leone X in Firenze nel 1515'' (Biblioteca Storica Toscana (Florence: Olschki) 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced on a princely scale, catching Leo at the peak of his reputation, en route to a meeting at Bologna with François I, at the head of temporarily victorious forces. Ciseri identifies two likely candidates for the allegorical programme, Jacopo Nardi and Marcello Virgilio Adriani, and a theme that offered parallel evocations of Imperial Rome the heavenly Jerusalem. The unfinished façade of the Duomo was temporarily "completed" in "[[chiaroscuro]]" ([[grisaille]]) canvases of feigned architecture and sculpture by [[Andrea del Sarto]] to designs by [[Jacopo Sansovino]].&lt;ref&gt;Shearman 1962:480&lt;/ref&gt;

*1515 and 1535–36: [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] was both the most powerful and the most mobile monarch of the Renaissance, and made unprecedented numbers of entries. He made a series in his youth, from which the 1515 entry into [[Bruges]] is one of the best recorded of the old medieval style, with an unusually well-illustrated [http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0074 Festival Book] for the date. In 1533 he was regally entertained in Genoa by [[Andrea Doria]], with a mock battle staged in the harbour.

*1548–49: Philip II made a tour as the heir of Charles beginning in Italy, up through Germany, and ending in the Netherlands, entering many cities, often with Charles, with [[Antwerp]] as the culmination, shown in a well-illustrated [http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0116 Festival Book], which shows many decorations that were not actually constructed.  Apart from very heavy rain, the entry had been designed to celebrate agreement of Philip's succession to the Empire, which the Electors refused.

*1549–50. [[Henry II of France]] and his family made a tour of entries which set the tone for Valois propaganda. For the Entry into Paris, 16 June 1549, following [[Catherine de' Medici]]'s coronation at Saint-Denis, a loggia designed by [[Pierre Lescot]] with sculptures by [[Jean Goujon]] had been in preparation for two years; a naval battle was staged on the Seine, a [[tournament]] was held, and heretics were burned.&lt;ref&gt;I.

A [http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0231 much less elaborate] affair than Habsburg entries, but at least for the Protestant population, one more genuinely celebrated.  There is a typical English emphasis on poems and orations, of which the majority were given by children.  Elizabeth processed in a triumphal "Chariot", was presented with a bible by the city, and passed giant figures re-used from the wedding of her sister Mary.  Both speeches and tableaus depicted her as saviour of the Protestant faith, a new [[Deborah]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0231 Festival Book]&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1578 entry into [[Norwich]] is [http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0232 almost homely]; the master of the [[grammar school]] being apparently the only townsman whose Latin was fit to put before the Queen, he catches her up and orates at several points.
*1571: The separate Entries of [[Charles IX of France]] and his new Habsburg queen, [[Elisabeth of Austria (1554–1592)|Elizabeth of Austria]], into Paris, 6 March and 29, were recorded in a book of woodcuts with text, Simon Bouquet's ''Bref et sommaire receuil...'', published in July. Bouquet, an alderman of Paris, was responsible for coordinating the details. Poets [[Jean Dorat]] and [[Pierre Ronsard]] drew up the iconographic program, and [[Germain Pilon]] executed temporary allegorical sculpture, and [[Niccolo dell'Abate]] provided paintings. The main theme was the inauguration of a new era of peace: Charles' personal motto, ''Piety and Justice'' furnished the allegory presented at one of the cortege's stops. A little over a year later the [[Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre]]s inaugurated a new phase of the wars.&lt;ref name="Victor E 1975"/&gt;
*1574: The new King [[Henry III of France]] on his way back from his brief period as [[King of Poland]] was given an exceptionally grand Entry to [[Venice]], which rarely had the opportunity of welcoming a friendly monarch, though it had its own very lavish round of festivities. This was a "State Visit" with no element of accepting fealty.  Tintoretto and Veronese collaborated in painting an arch designed by [[Palladio]], and for the banquet for 3,000 in the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]], statuettes in [[sugar]] designed by Jacopo Sansovino decorated the tables.&lt;ref&gt;R.H. Wilenski, ''Dutch Painting'', 1945:28f, Faber, London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;[http://special-1.bl.uk/treasures/festivalbooks/BookDetails.aspx?strFest=0035 Book]&lt;/small&gt;
*1583: The [[French Fury]] was a disastrously unsuccessful attempt by [[François, Duke of Anjou]] to use the excuse of an entry to take [[Antwerp]] – the citizens were forewarned and attacked the army as it marched through the streets, sending it running.  They had already been sacked in the [[Sack of Antwerp|Spanish Fury]] in 1576, with the sack of Rome in 1527, among the most notorious anti-entries of the period.
*1589: The triumphal entry of [[Christina of Lorraine]] at Florence and her wedding procession with [[Ferdinand I de' Medici]], complete with ephemeral triumphal arches, included — interspersed with public shows, a game of ''[[Football in Italy|calcio]]'', animal-baiting, a staged [[jousting|joust]] in Piazza Santa Croce — semi-private court events, the musical ''[[intermedio|intermedi]]'' that were presented in the newly redesigned theatre in the [[Uffizi]]; these elaborately costumed and staged allegorical ''tableaux'' with complex allegories mark a stage in the development of court pageantry and the [[masque]], as well as in the pre-history of [[opera]].&lt;ref&gt;See James W. Saslow, ''The Medici Wedding of 1589: Florentine Festival as Theatrum Mundi'' ((New Haven:Yale University Press) 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;
*1598: For the triumphal entry of [[Pope Clement VIII]] into Ferrara, where the principal [[House of Este|Este]] line had failed and the Pope had declared the fief to have reverted to the Papal States, the occasion urgently required splendidly presented and concrete allegorical propaganda, in order to justify the new situation to the Ferrarese. Once ensconced, Clement was host to a series of dukes and ambassadors honoured with princely entries themselves, climaxed with the betrothals by proxy of [[Margaret of Austria, Queen of Spain|Margaret of Austria]] and [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Archduke Albert of Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;See Bonner Mitchell,  ''1598. A Year of Pageantry in Late Renaissance Ferrara'' (Binghamton: Medieval Texts and Studies) 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;
*1648: The "[[Joyous Entry]]" of [[Archduke Leopold William of Austria]] into Antwerp was also coordinated by Gevartius, who devised its iconography and published his own description. Rather than three-dimensional arches and tableaux, the allegories were rendered in two dimensions on strategically placed screens.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Vlieghe, "The Decorations for Archduke Leopold William's State Entry into Antwerp" ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' '''39''' (1976:190–198).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SBK-07: Superbike World Championship''' also known as '''Superbike World Championship''' in [[North America]] is the official [[Superbike World Championship]] [[video game]] and offers the official races, sessions, teams and riders of the real [[2007 Superbike World Championship season]]. The game allows the player to race in 5 game modes: Quick Race, Time Attack, Race weekend, Championship and Challenges in a variety of difficulties and weather conditions. The game was also going to be released on the [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] and [[Xbox 360]] but they were cancelled.

The developer and the publisher say that the game aims to capture the attention of core gamers but also appeal to the casual gamers. SBK-07 can be rendered more [[Arcade game|arcade]] or [[Sim racing|simulation]] by enabling or disabling a series or realism options. Milestone had also developed ''[[MotoGP '07]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21779">Founded in 1975, '''Seattle Children's Theatre (SCT)''' is the second-largest resident theatre for young audiences in North America and among the twenty largest regional theatres in the United States, with an annual operating budget of approximately $6.5 Million. SCT's mission statement reads: "The mission of Seattle Children's Theatre is to provide children of all ages access to professional theatre, with a focus on new works, and theatre education."

SCT employs bargaining unit members of [[Actors' Equity Association|Actor's Equity]], [[United Scenic Artists]] and [[IATSE]] and is a member of [[Theatre Puget Sound]], [[International Performing Arts for Youth]] and [[Theatre Communications Group]]. Mainstage Season performances are presented at [[Seattle Center]] in the 482-seat Charlotte Martin and 275-seat Eve Alvord Theatres from September through June. SCT's Drama School also produces a Summer Season with student actors who work hand-in-hand with professional creative staff and technicians.

Throughout its history, SCT has developed and produced more than 113 new works, many of which go on to be produced by other regional theatres around the country and the world.

SCT programming reaches approximately 220,000 children, parents, and teachers annually.

==Education programs==
In addition to its mainstage productions, SCT operates several education programs. Its Education Outreach arm brings theatre-related teaching to schools and other organizations in the Seattle area. Its on-site Drama School provides classes year-round, taught by professional artists, and produces Summer Season shows providing young people with participatory theatre education and theatre arts training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Controversy==

An information technology worker, William Edgar Hoke, was arrested and subsequently convicted of possessing at least 13,000 pornographic images of child pornography, spanning over three years of browsing illegal bulletin boards which he accessed from both home and work computers. There was no indication that Hoke had unsupervised contact with children at SCT. He was charged by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as part of Operation Predator, a program aimed at bringing to justice those who prey upon children. He was sentenced to eighteen months in prison as well as ten years probation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ice.gov/pi/nr/0904/090415seattle.htm seattle children's theatre worker arrested for possession of child pornography&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seattlepi.com/local/412902_theater03.html Seattle Children's Theatre worker sentenced in child porn case&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4854">[[File:The_Magic_Basket_1940_Alfred_Wheeler.png|thumb|right|cover art]]'''''The Magic Basket''''' is a musical play written in 1940 for children by [[Australian]] composer [[Alfred Wheeler (composer)|Alfred Wheeler]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/contributor/457466&lt;/ref&gt;. The score includes dialogue and fourteen tunes. Action occurs on a single magical moon-scape set. There are twelve speaking parts and additional chorus.

==Synopsis==
The plot involves a group of children whisked to a magical land in the moon, where they help the [[Sandman]] to recover his bag of sleep-dust from the [[Goblin]]. The children are transported in a basket, hence the title.

==Musical Numbers==
* Oh isn't it fun to live in the moon?
* Whatever can we do
* I sweep the sky
* My basket brave and I
* Derry derry down Oh!
* Galloping, galloping up in the sky
* The sandman
* Tippetty tippetty toe
* Goblins bold are we
* If you will be a meddlesome Matty
* The deed is done
* Bong! goes the gong
* One song before we part
* Lullaby

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1970">The '''vanishing bird cage''', also known as the flying birdcage, is a classic parlour [[Magic (illusion)|magic]] effect that was invented by [[France|French]] magician [[Buatier De Kolta]]. The trick has also been used by magicians [[Carl Hertz]], [[Harry Beardmore]], Harry Blackstone ([[Harry Blackstone, Sr.|Sr.]] and [[Harry Blackstone, Jr.|Jr.]]) [[John Mulholland (magician)|John Mulholland]], John Angel, [[Sabrina Vera]], and [[Tommy Wonder (magician)|Tommy Wonder]].

The magician displays a bird cage, holding it between both of his hands.  The cage is [[rectangle|rectangular]], about six inches tall by six inches wide by eight inches long, and made of [[wire]] on all six sides.  Often there is a [[bird]], though in modern performances of the act it is usually fake, inside the cage.  The magician will offer the cage for inspection by an audience member, but he will never actually release his grip of it.  Then, without covering the cage, the magician makes a sudden motion and the cage (and anything inside) vanishes from sight.
A variation of the trick was featured in the 2006 film ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]''.

==Method==
The bird cage is designed to collapse if it is not supported from both ends.  Two of the opposite corners of the cage pull away from each other so that the box becomes somewhat of a tube, about 18 inches long and only one or two inches thick, that resembles a bundle of wire that is thicker in the middle than at the ends.  An elastic cord attached to one end of the cage runs up the [[sleeve]] of the magician's [[jacket]] so that when the cage collapses, it is drawn up his sleeve and hidden from view.  As a living bird is likely to be injured or killed when the cage collapses, fake birds are most commonly used in modern presentations of the vanishing bird cage.

'''Video Classics''' was one of the first major [[Home video|Home Video]] Distributors in Australia.

Between 1979 and 1984, Video Classics was one of the leading names in Australian home video and claimed to have "Australia'sand us largest range of quality video movies"like fletch lives 

At first the different [[Videocassette recorder#History|video formats]] that Video Classics advertised they duplicated was definitive of the formats on the market at the time, which included [[VHS]], [[Betamax]], [[Video 2000|Phillips]], Grundig and [[U-matic]], whether or not they actually duplicated onto any formats other than VHS or Beta is questionable though, By 1981 their advertising had reduced the list to just VHS and Beta.

Video Classics both rented their tapes and sold them with Prices that started at $69.95 (which was lowered to $49.95 by 1981) for sale, or rental prices being $9.90 overnight, $14.90 per week and $40 for three tapes per month.

In Addition to their own library of tapes, Video Classics also distributed tapes for other video 
labels including The Nostalgia Merchant, Sports World Cinema, VCL, [[Media Home Entertainment|Media]], Electric Blue, Wizard Video, Movies at Midnight, and Filmways.      

Video Classics floated on the stock exchange for $1.15 million, but crashed spectacularly in 1984 leading to the company's demise.

==History==
Video Library made its [[Initial public offering|initial public stock offering]] in mid-1985.

[[File:FC-Twin-Console-Set-H.jpg|thumb|right|The [[FC Twin]], a popular clone system compatible with game cartridges for the original [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]].]]

A '''video game clone''' is either a [[video game]] (or series) which is very similar to or heavily inspired by a previous popular game or series.

The term is usually derogatory, implying a lack of originality and creativity; however, an intentional clone may be anything from a "[[ripoff]]" to an honorary [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to its [[wiktionary:exemplar#Noun|exemplar]]. Accusing a game of being a clone carries the implication that its developers or publishers try to profit off of the exemplar's success. In particularly bad cases this may be seen as a form of [[plagiarism]] or [[fraud]] and could be taken to [[court]].

Cloning a game in digital marketplaces is common, because it is hard to prevent and easy to compete with existing games. Developers can copyright the graphics, title, story, and characters, but they cannot easily protect software design and game mechanics. A [[patent]] for the mechanics is possible, but acquiring one is expensive and time-consuming.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/12/technology/for-creators-of-video-games-a-faint-line-on-cloning.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all "For Creators of Games, a Faint Line on Cloning"] ''New York Times'', Chen, Brian X.

Within the field of video games, popular game concepts often lead to that concept becoming incorporated or expanded upon by other developers. In other cases, games may be developed with clear influence from one or more earlier games. Such derivations are not always considered clones though the term may be used to make a comparison between games. As copyright law does not protect gameplay concepts, the reuse of such ideas is generally considered acceptable. Games like ''[[Tetris]]'' and ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Nelson | first =Mark | title =Breaking Down Breakout: System And Level Design For Breakout-style Games | publisher =[[Gamasutra]] | url =http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1630/breaking_down_breakout_system_and_.php?print=1 | accessdate =2007-11-29  }}&lt;/ref&gt; inspired many games that used similar core concepts but expanded beyond that; the ''Breakout''-inspired ''[[Arkanoid]]'' itself inspired many other clones that built upon its unique additions to ''Breakout''. Gameplay elements of ''[[Street Fighter II]]'' and ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' became common gameplay elements in the [[fighting game]] genre,&lt;ref name="egm_influential_sf2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Patterson|first=Eric L.|title=EGM Feature: The 5 Most Influential Japanese Games Day Four: Street Fighter II|url=http://www.egmnow.com/articles/news/egm-featurethe-5-most-influential-japanese-gamesday-four-street-fighter-ii/|work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|accessdate=17 April 2012|date=November 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-02-21-how-hackers-reinvented-street-fighter-2|title=How hackers reinvented Street Fighter 2|date=21 February 2014|work=Eurogamer.net|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5860138/innovation-has-never-been-the-cornerstone-of-the-video-game-industry|title=Innovation Has Never Been the Cornerstone of the Video Game Industry|author=Scott Patterson|publisher=Gawker Media|work=Kotaku|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of games that tried to capitalize on the success of the 3D adventure game ''[[Myst]]'' were grouped as "Myst clones".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Parrish, Jeremy|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3134600|title=When SCUMM Ruled the Earth|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=May 2, 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ffGEdT2d?url=http://www.1up.com/features/essential-50-myst|archivedate=February 29, 2016|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[video game genres]] are founded by archetypal games of which all subsequent similar games are considered derivatives; notably, early [[first-person shooters]] were often called "''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' clones",&lt;ref name="clones"&gt;Turner, Benjamin &amp; Bowen, Kevin, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120712042757/http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/december03/doom/clones/index.shtml Bringin' in the DOOM Clones], ''GameSpy,'' December 11, 2003, Accessed February 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; while the success of the open-world formula in ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' led to the genre of [[GTA clone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3762350.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |title=Hunt for Grand Theft Auto pirates |date=2004-10-21 |accessdate=2008-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genre of [[endless runner]]s is based on the success and simplicity of the game ''[[Canabalt]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/dont-stop-the-game-that-conquered-smartphones | title = Don’t Stop: The Game That Conquered Smartphones | first = Simon | last = Parkin | date = 2013-06-07 | accessdate = 2015-10-20 | work = [[The New Yorker|New Yorker]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, games that are "clones" of another are generally not implied to have committed any intellectual property infractions, and otherwise considered legally acceptable practices, although calling such games clones is generally considered derogatory.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

True video games clones occur when competitors, on seeing the success of a video game title, attempt to compete by creating a near-copy of the existing game with similar assets and gameplay with little additional innovation; developer [[Jenova Chen]] compared the nature of these clones similar to [[plagiarism]] in which there is little attempt to distinguish the new work from the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2009/12/cloning-or-theft-ars-explores-game-design-with-jenova-chen/ | title = Cloning or theft?

If the public really likes an idea, it is milked for all it's worth, and numerous clones of a different color soon crowd the shelves.

Such cloning of video games initially bore out from [[arcade video game|arcade]] games, buoyed by the success of that sector during its "[[Golden age of arcade video games|golden age]]" in the early 1980s. Cloning would continue as home video game consoles became popular, and in part, the number of clones being produced and saturating the market were considered part of the reason for the [[North American video game crash of 1983|video game market crash in 1983]].&lt;ref name="clark198212"/&gt; A new resurgence in cloned video games came with the rise of [[social network game]]s, typically which were offered as [[freemium]] titles to entice new players to play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/clone-wars-what-copycats-really-do-to-the-social-games-industry/586137 | title = Clone Wars: What Copycats Really Do To The Social Games Industry | first = AJ | last = Glasser | date = 2011-07-27 | accessdate = 2015-10-20 | work = [[Adweek]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the cost, ease and simplicity of the tools needed to develop [[mobile game]]s has made cloning in that sector a significant problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tassi|first1=Paul|title=Over Sixty 'Flappy Bird' Clones Hit Apple's App Store Every Single Day|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2014/03/06/over-sixty-flappy-bird-clones-hit-apples-app-store-every-single-day/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.develop-online.net/news/flappy-bird-creator-s-new-game-swing-copters-has-already-been-cloned-a-lot/0196811 | title = Flappy Bird creator's new game Swing Copters has already been cloned.

===Legal aspects===
In 1981 [[Atari, Inc.]] warned in full-page advertisements "Piracy: This Game is Over", stating that the company "will protect its rights by vigorously enforcing [its] [[Copyright and video games|copyrights]] and by taking appropriate action against unauthorized entities who reproduce or adapt substantial copies of ATARI games", like a home-computer clone.&lt;ref name="byte198110"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1981-10/1981_10_BYTE_06-10_Local_Networks#page/n345/mode/2up | title=Atari Software / Piracy: This Game is Over. | work=BYTE | date=October 1981 | accessdate=16 March 2016 | pages=347 | type=advertisement}}&lt;/ref&gt; In present-day law, it is nonetheless held that game mechanics of a video game are part of its software, and are [[software copyright|generally ineligible for copyright]].&lt;ref name="guardian legal"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/dec/21/clone-wars-games-industry-plagiarism | title = Clone Wars: is plagiarism killing creativity in the games industry? | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 2011-12-23 | accessdate = 2012-08-07 | first = Simon | last = Parkin }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Copyright Office specifically notes: "Copyright does not protect the idea for a game, its name or title, or the method or methods for playing it. Nor does copyright protect any idea, system, method, device, or trademark material involved in developing, merchandising, or playing a game.

It is generally recognized in the video game industry that borrowing mechanics from other games is common practice, and their widespread use would make them ineligible for legal copyright or patent protection.&lt;ref name="guardian legal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=26290 | title = Analysis: Clone Games &amp; Fan Games – Legal Issues | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | date = 2009-12-09 | accessdate= 2012-08-07 | first = Mona | last = Ibrahim }}&lt;/ref&gt; Courts also consider ''[[scènes à faire]]'' (French for "scenes that must be done") for a particular genre as uncopyrightable; games involving vampires, for example, would be expected to have elements of the vampire drinking blood and driving a stake through the vampire's heart to kill him.&lt;ref name="gamasutra 6 cases"/&gt; Up until 2012, courts were reluctant to find for copyright infringement of clones; attorney Stephen C. McArthur, writing for ''[[Gamasutra]]'', said that courts opted to take a more lax view to balance innovation in the industry and prevent overzealous copyright protection that could have one company claim copyright on an entire genre of games.&lt;ref name="gamasutra 6 cases"/&gt;

A shift in legal options for developers to challenge clones arose from the 2012 federal court decision that ruled in favor of the [[Tetris Company]], the owners of the ''Tetris'' copyright, over the clone ''Mino'' which used the same gameplay as ''Tetris'' but with different art assets. The developers for ''Mino'' has cited in their defense that they only used the uncopyrightable gameplay elements of ''Tetris'' in ''Mino''. The court ruled that copyright law was in favor of the Tetris Company's claim, as the gameplay was copied without changes, and while the art assets were new, the "look and feel" of ''Mino'' could be easily confused for that of ''Tetris''.&lt;ref name="gamasutra 6 cases"/&gt;&lt;ref name="arstech tetris"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/06/defining-tetris-how-courts-judge-gaming-clones | title = Defining Tetris: How courts judge gaming clones | first = Kyle | last = Orland | date = 2012-06-20 | accessdate = 2012-08-07 | publisher = Ars Technica }}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision serves as case law for other developers to fend off "look-and-feel" clones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jack C.

Other notable legal actions involving video game clones include:
* In 1982, Atari brought a lawsuit against [[Amusement World]], claiming that the arcade game ''Meteos'' violated Atari's copyright on ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]''. Though the court identified twenty-two similarities in the game mechanics, it ruled against Atari citing these elements as ''scènes à faire'' for games about shooting at asteroids.&lt;ref name="gamasutra 6 cases"/&gt;
* [[Atari]] sought an injunction in 1982 to block the sale of ''[[Munchkin (video game)|K.C. Munchkin]]'' for the [[Magnavox Odyssey²|Phillips-Magnavox Odyssey²]], citing excessive similarities to its [[Pac-Man (Atari 2600)|Atari 2600 version of ''Pac-Man'']].  Though the court initially denied the injunction, Atari won on appeal; the court noted that though ''K.C. Munchkin'' offered different features such as moving walls and fewer dots in the maze to eat, "substantial parts were lifted; no plagiarist can excuse the wrong by showing how much of his work he did not pirate".&lt;ref name="wired ea zynga"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2012/08/ea-sues-zynga | title = CourtVille: Why Unclear Laws Put EA v.

* [[Data East]] sued [[Epyx]] over copyright violations from Data East's ''[[Karate Champ]]'' used in Epyx's ''World Karate Championship''. Similar to ''Asteroids'' vs. ''Meteors'', the court ruled in favor of Epyx, stating that while many elements were similar, they were necessary as part of karate championship-based game, and the remaining copyrightable elements were substantially different.&lt;ref name="gamasutra 6 cases"/&gt;
* [[Capcom]] filed a 1994 lawsuit against [[Data East]] over their fighting game, ''[[Fighter's History]]'', which Capcom claimed cloned characters, art assets, and move sets from ''[[Street Fighter II]]''. The court ruled against Capcom, stating that while some elements may have been similar, no direct measure of willful copying could be found; the court further found that many of the characters in ''Street Fighter II'' were already based on public domain stereotypical fighters, and were ineligible for copyright protection.&lt;ref name="gamasutra 6 cases"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.davis.ca/en/entry/video-game-law/street-fighter-ii-vs-fighters-history/ | title = Street Fighter II Vs.

[[File:Ea vs zynga lawsuit screenshot comparison.jpg|thumb|right|A comparison of in-game screenshots, published in EA's legal filings, of EA's ''The Sims Social'' (left) and Zynga's ''The Ville'', demonstrating the similarities in the games' art assets.]]
* In August 2012, [[Electronic Arts]] (EA), via its [[Maxis]] division, put forth a lawsuit against [[Zynga]], claiming that its Facebook game, ''[[The Ville (video game)|The Ville]]'' was a ripoff of EA's own Facebook game, ''[[The Sims Social]]''. The lawsuit challenges that ''The Ville'' not only copies the gameplay mechanics of ''The Sims Social'', but also uses art and visual interface aspects that appear to be inspired by ''The Sims Social''.   Zynga has long been criticized by the video game industry as cloning popular social and casual games from other developers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnyegriffiths/2012/08/06/ea-sues-zynga-but-deeper-social-issues-threaten/ | title = EA Sues Zynga, But Deeper Social Issues Threaten | first = Daniel Nye | last = Griffen | date = 2012-08-06 | accessdate = 2012-08-07 | work = [[Forbes]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zynga clone"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edge-online.com/features/how-zynga-cloned-its-way-success | title = How Zynga cloned its way to success | first = Nathan | last = Brown | date = 2012-01-25 | accessdate  =2012-08-07 | work = [[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sfweekly.com/2010-09-08/news/farmvillains/ | title = FarmVillains | first= Peter | last =Jamison | date = 2010-09-08 | accessdate  =2012-08-07 | work = [[SF Weekly]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; a practice common throughout the social game genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

But we are the studio that has the financial and corporate resources to stand up and do something about it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2012/08/03/zynga-pokes-a-giant-ea-files-lawsuit-after-the-ville-clones-the-sims/ | title = Zynga Pokes a Giant: EA Files Lawsuit After The Ville Clones The Sims | date = 2012-08-03 | accessdate  =2012-08-07 | work = [[Forbes]] | first = Paul | last = Tassi }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two companies settled out of court on undisclosed terms in February 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/186789/EA_and_Zynga_settle_The_Ville_copycat_case_out_of_court.php | title = EA and Zynga settle The Ville copycat case out of court | first = Frank | last =Cifaldi | date = 2013-02-15 | accessdate = 2013-02-15 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, with the popularity of social and mobile game stores like Apple's [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] for iOS system and [[Google Play]] for Android-based systems, a large number of likely-infringing clones have begun appearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2012/feb/03/apps-apple | title = Should Apple take more action against march of the iOS clones? | first = Stuart | last = Dredge | date = 2012-02-03 | accessdate =2012-08-10 | work = [[The Guardian]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While such storefronts typically include a review process before games and apps can be offered on them, these processes do not consider copyright infringement of other titles. Instead, they rely on the developer of the work that has been cloned to initiate a complaint regarding the clone, which may take time for review.  The cloned apps often are purposely designed to resemble other popular apps by name or feel, luring away purchasers from the legitimate app, even after complaints have been filed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://techcrunch.com/2011/12/06/can-we-stop-the-copycat-apps/  |title = Can We Stop The Copycat Apps? | first = Rip | last = Epsom | date  =2011-12-11 | accessdate = 2012-08-10 | publisher = [[TechCrunch]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/03/app-store-fakes/ | title = Apple Kicks Chart Topping Fakes Out Of App Store | first = John | last = Constine | date  =2012-02-03 | accessdate = 2012-08-10 | publisher = [[TechCrunch]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple has released a tool to streamline claims of app clones to a team dedicated to handle these cases, helping to bring the two parties together to try to negotiate prior to action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/09/apple-now-provides-online-tool-to-report-app-store-ripoffs/ | title = Apple now provides online tool to report App Store ripoffs | first = Chris | last = Foresman | date = 2012-09-04 | accessdate = 2012-09-04 | publisher = Ars Technica }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Apple, Google, and Microsoft took steps to stem the mass of clones based on ''Swing Copters'' after its release, experts believe it is unlikely that these app stores will institute any type of proactive clone protection outside of clear copyright violations, and these experts stress the matter is better done by the developers and gaming community to assure the original developer is well known, protects their game assets on release, and gets the credit for the original game.&lt;ref name="develop legal"/&gt;

Another approach some companies have used to prevent clones is via [[trademarks]] as to prevent clones and knockoffs. Notably, [[King (company)|King]] have gotten a United States trademark on the word "Candy" in the area of video games to protect clones and player confusion for their game ''[[Candy Crush Saga]]''. They have also sought to block the use of the word "Saga" in the trademark filing of ''[[The Banner Saga]]'' for similar reasons, despite the games having no common elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/22/candy-crush-saga-dev-king-trademarks-the-word-candy |  title = Candy Crush Saga Dev Goes After The Banner Saga | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = 2014-01-22 | accessdate = 2014-01-22 | first = Luke | last = Karmali }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the European Union, one can register for a [[European Union trade mark]] that includes multimedia elements, which would allow a developer or publisher to trademark a specific gameplay element that is novel from past games, providing a different route for them to protect their work from cloning. For example, [[Rebellion Developments]] filed to register its "Kill Cam" mechanic as a trademark from its series ''[[Sniper Elite]]'' in October 2017, though as of February 2018, the application is still being reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-02-19-multimedia-trademarks-kill-cloners | title = How multimedia trade marks could kill cloned games | first = Kostyantyn | last = Lobov | date = February 19, 2018 | accessdate = February 19, 2018 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded in 1912 as a [[Rakugo|traditional theatre]], and has since grown to be one of the most influential companies in Japan, employing most of Japan's popular [[owarai]] (comedy) talent, producing and promoting the shows they appear in.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Alex, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100518i1.html YOSHIMOTO, Entertaining the nation:  For almost 100 years, Yoshimoto has been clearinghouse for comics]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', May 18, 2010, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Yoshimoto is said to be almost single-handedly responsible for the development of Japanese [[manzai]] after World War II and, in fact, the [[kanji]] that are now used for the word ''manzai'' were introduced by Yoshimoto in 1933, spelling a new era for the comedy style.&lt;!--Oops I made a pun!--&gt; Although pure ''manzai'' is no longer the dominant form of entertainment in Japan, Yoshimoto's influence remains and the spirit of ''manzai'' lives on in modern Japanese comedy, as can be seen by the prevalence of the [[Kansai dialect]] in many ''owarai'' productions.

The current director of Yoshimoto is [[Isao Yoshino]], who replaced the long-standing ex-senior director Masao Kimura in January 2005. Kimura had been part of the company since entering in 1969, and in the 35 plus years that Kimura worked with Yoshimoto, it expanded greatly and its reputation as a successful company grew enormously. Fresh out of university, Yoshimoto is still the goal for many young comedians, and many of them hope to be accepted into the 'New Star Creation' school in Osaka, or one of others across Japan.

Yoshimoto now boasts more than 650 entertainers, possibly the most famous being the ''owarai'' ''kombi'' (duo) [[Downtown (Owarai)|Downtown]], successors of the ''manzai'' duo [[Yasu-Kiyo]] in the 1980s. As in much of Japanese culture, there exists a strong bond between [[senpai]] (senior) and [[kōhai]] (junior) members of the entertainment industry. Many lower level employees of Yoshimoto do not receive full salaries but rather benefit from the advice and guidance of senior members of the company.
