'''{{mp|2018 BF|3}}''' is a micro-[[asteroid]], classified as a [[near-Earth object]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]], approximately {{convert|20|m|ft|sigfig=1|sp=us}} in diameter. It was first observed on 20 January 2018, by astronomers of the [[Catalina Sky Survey]] at [[Mount Lemmon Observatory]] in Arizona, United States,&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt; the day after the closest flyby, due to its approach from the direction of the Sun.

== Description ==

{{mp|2018 BF|3}} orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.8–2.3&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 23 months (706 days; [[semi-major axis]] of 1.55&amp;nbsp;AU). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.48 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 12[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; With an [[aphelion]] of 2.3&amp;nbsp;AU, it is a [[Mars-crosser]], crossing the orbit of the Red Planet at 1.666&amp;nbsp;AU. It is also an [[List of Earth-crossing minor planets|Earth-crosser]], as are all [[Apollo asteroid]]s. The body's [[observation arc]] begins at Mount Lemmon with its first observation on 20 February 2018.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

=== 2018 flyby ===

On 19 January 2018, the object passed at a nominal distance of only {{convert |242,000 |km |AU mi |abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=3 |order=flip}} from Earth.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; This corresponds to 0.63&amp;nbsp;LD.&lt;ref name="MPC-Tweet" /&gt; Close approaches are projected for 28 October 2019 and 26 August 2021, both at a much larger distance (0.24&amp;nbsp;AU).&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

An '''afterglow''' is a broad arch of whitish or pinkish [[sunlight]] in the [[sky]] that is [[light scattering|scattered]] by fine [[particulates]] like [[dust]] suspended in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. An afterglow may appear above the highest [[cloud]]s in the hour of fading [[twilight]], or be [[reflection (optics)|reflected]] off high [[snow]]fields in [[mountain]] regions long after [[sunset]]. The particles produce a [[scattering]] effect upon the component parts of [[Electromagnetic spectrum#Visible radiation .28light.29|white light]].

True [[alpenglow]], which occurs long after sunset or long before sunrise, is caused by the [[backscatter]]ing of red sunlight by [[aerosols]] and fine dust particles low in the atmosphere. After sunset, alpenglow is an afterglow caused by the illumination of atmospheric particles by sunlight as it gets [[refraction|refracted]] and [[Rayleigh scattering|scattered]] through the Earth's atmosphere.

The [[energy of light|high-energy]] and [[high-frequency]] light is [[scattering of electromagnetic radiation|scattered]] out the most, while the remaining low-energy and -frequency light reaches the observer on the [[horizon]] at [[twilight]]. The backscattering of this light further turns it pinkish to reddish. This period of time is referred to as [[blue hour]] and is widely treasured by [[photographers]] and [[painters]], as it offers breathtaking views.

The afterglow persists until the [[Earth's shadow]] ([[terminator (solar)|terminator]] line) overtakes the sky above the observer as night falls and the stars appear, with [[Venus]] (the second-brightest [[celestial object]] after the Moon in the [[night sky]]) visible above the horizon opposite of the [[Belt of Venus]] around the [[antisolar point]].

After the [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa|1883 eruption]] of the [[volcano]] [[Krakatoa]], a remarkable series of red [[sunset]]s appeared worldwide. An enormous amount of exceedingly fine dust were blown to a great height by the volcano's explosion, and then globally diffused by the high atmospheric winds. [[Edvard Munch]]'s painting ''[[The Scream]]'' possibly depicts an afterglow during this period.

'''Annie Dillard''' (born April 30, 1945) is an American author, best known for her narrative prose in both fiction and non-fiction. She has published works of poetry, essays, prose, and literary criticism, as well as two novels and one memoir. Her 1974 work ''[[Pilgrim at Tinker Creek]]'' won the 1975 [[Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction]]. From 1980, Dillard taught for 21 years in the English department of [[Wesleyan University]], in [[Middletown, Connecticut]].

==Early life and ''An American Childhood''==
Annie Dillard was the eldest of three daughters in her family. Early childhood details can be drawn from Annie Dillard's autobiography, ''An American Childhood'' (1987), about growing up in the [[Point Breeze (Pittsburgh)|Point Breeze]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh]]. It starts in 1950 when she was five. Dillard's memoir ''An American Childhood'' focuses on "waking up"&lt;ref name=americanchildhood /&gt; from a self-absorbed childhood, and becoming immersed in the present moment of the larger world. She grew up in Pittsburgh in the 50s in "a house full of comedians."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26000-2004Jul29.html An American Childhood by Annie Dillard]". ''The Washington Post Book Club''. August 1, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; She describes her mother as an energetic non-conformist. Her father taught her many useful subjects such as plumbing, economics, and the intricacies of the novel ''[[On the Road]]'', though by the end of her adolescence she begins to realize neither of her parents is infallible.

In her autobiography, Dillard describes reading a wide variety of subjects including geology, natural history, entomology, epidemiology, and poetry, among others. Among the influential books from her youth were ''[[The Natural Way to Draw]]'' and ''Field Book of Ponds and Streams''&lt;ref&gt;Dillard, ''An American Childhood'', p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; because they allowed her a way to interact with the present moment and a way of escape, respectively. Her days were filled with exploring, piano and dance classes, rock collecting, bug collecting, drawing, and reading books from the public library including [[natural history]], and [[military history]] such as [[World War II]].

As a child, Dillard attended the [[Shadyside Presbyterian Church]] in [[Pittsburgh]], though her parents did not attend.&lt;ref name="americanchildhood"&gt;Dillard, ''An American Childhood'', p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; She spent four summers at the First Presbyterian Church (FPC) Camp in [[Ligonier, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;Dillard, Annie. "Seeing" in Albanese, Catherine L.; ''American Spiritualiaties: A Reader''; p. 440. {{ISBN|0-253-33839-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As an adolescent, she quit attending church because of "hypocrisy". When she told her minister of her decision, she was given four volumes of [[C. S. Lewis]]'s broadcast talks, from which she appreciated that author's philosophy on suffering, but elsewhere found the topic inadequately addressed.&lt;ref&gt;Dillard, ''An American Childhood'', p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

She attended [[Pittsburgh Public Schools]] until fifth grade, and then [[The Ellis School]] until college.

==College and writing career==
Dillard attended [[Hollins College]] (now Hollins University), in [[Roanoke, Virginia]], where she studied literature and creative writing. She married her writing teacher, the poet [[R. H. W. Dillard]], eight years her senior. Of her college experience, Dillard stated: "In college I learned how to learn from other people. As far as I was concerned, writing in college didn’t consist of what little Annie had to say, but what Wallace Stevens had to say. I didn’t come to college to think my own thoughts, I came to learn what had been thought."&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, Malcolm. (April 30, 1982). "[http://www.towerofbabel.com/splashingheart/teteatete/anniedillard/ Tete a Tete: Lunch with Annie Dillard]". Towerofbabel.com. Retrieved December 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 she earned an MA in English. Her thesis on [[Henry David Thoreau]] showed how [[Walden Pond]] functioned as "the central image and focal point for Thoreau's narrative movement between heaven and earth." Dillard spent the first few years after graduation oil painting, writing, and keeping a journal. Several of her poems and short stories were published, and during this time she also worked for Johnson's Anti-Poverty Program.

Dillard's works have been compared to those by [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]], [[Emily Dickinson]], [[William Blake]], and [[John Donne]],&lt;ref name="Cantwell"/&gt; and she cites [[Henry James]], [[Thomas Hardy]], [[Graham Greene]], [[George Eliot]], and [[Ernest Hemingway]] among her favorite authors.&lt;ref name="ideas-irony"&gt;Suh, Grace. (October 4, 1996). "[http://www.yaleherald.com/archive/xxii/10.4.96/ae/dillard.html Ideas are Tough; Irony is Easy: Pulitzer Prize-Winner Annie Dillard Speaks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041103190907/http://www.yaleherald.com/archive/xxii/10.4.96/ae/dillard.html |date=2004-11-03 }}".

===''Tickets for a Prayer Wheel''===
In her first book of poems ''[[Tickets for a Prayer Wheel (book)|Tickets for a Prayer Wheel]]'' (1974), Dillard first articulated themes that she would later explore in other works of prose.&lt;ref name="official-books"&gt;"[http://www.anniedillard.com/books-annie-dillard.html Books by Annie Dillard]". Annie Dillard's Official Website. Retrieved November 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Pilgrim at Tinker Creek''===
Dillard's journals served as a source for ''Pilgrim at Tinker Creek'' (1974), a nonfiction narrative about the natural world near her home in Roanoke, Virginia. Although the book contains named chapters, it is not (as some critics assumed) a collection of essays.&lt;ref name="official-books"/&gt; Early chapters were published in ''The Atlantic'', ''Harpers'', and ''Sports Illustrated.'' The book describes God by studying creation, leading one critic to call her "one of the foremost horror writers of the 20th Century."&lt;ref name="official-books"/&gt; In ''The New York Times'', [[Eudora Welty]] said the work was "admirable writing" that reveals "a sense of wonder so fearless and unbridled... [an] intensity of experience that she seems to live in order to declare," but "I honestly don't know what [Dillard] is talking about at... times."&lt;ref&gt;Welty, Eudora. (March 24, 1974). "[https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/03/28/specials/dillard-tinker.html Meditation on Seeing]". ''The New York Times.'' Retrieved November 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book won the 1975 [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction]], when Dillard was 29.

===''Holy the Firm''===
One day, Dillard decided to begin a project in which she would write about whatever happened on Lummi Island within a three-day time period. When a plane crashed on the second day, Dillard began to contemplate the problem of pain, and God's allowance of "natural evil to happen".&lt;ref name="official-books"/&gt;  Although ''Holy the Firm'' (1977) was only 66 pages long, it took her 14 months, writing full-time, to complete the manuscript. In ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' novelist [[Frederick Buechner]] called it "a rare and precious book." While other contemporary reviewers wondered whether she was under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs, Dillard denies it.&lt;ref name="official-books"/&gt;

===''Teaching a Stone to Talk''===
''Teaching a Stone to Talk'' (1982) is a book of 14 short nonfiction narrative essays and travels. The essay "Life on the Rocks: The Galapagos" won the New York Women's Press Club award, and "Total Eclipse" was chosen for ''Best American Essays of the [20th] Century'' (2000). As Dillard herself notes, "'The Weasel' is lots of fun; the much-botched church service is (I think) hilarious."&lt;ref name="official-books"/&gt; Following the first hardcover edition of the book, the order of essays was changed. Initially "Living Like Weasels" was first, followed by "An Expedition to the Pole". "Total Eclipse" was found between "On a Hill Far Away" and "Lenses".

The essays are entitled 
*"Total Eclipse" 
*"An Expedition to the Pole"
*"Living Like Weasels"
*"In the Jungle"
*"The Deer at Providencia"
*"Teaching a Stone to Talk"

===''Living by Fiction''===
In ''Living by Fiction'' (1982), Dillard produced her "theory about why flattening of character and narrative cannot happen in literature as it did when the visual arts rejected deep space for the picture plane." She later said that, in the process of writing this book, she talked herself into writing an old-fashioned novel.&lt;ref name="official-books"/&gt;

===''Encounters with Chinese Writers''===
''Encounters with Chinese Writers'' (1984) is a work of journalism. One part takes place in China, where Dillard was a member of a delegation of six American writers and publishers, following the fall of the [[Gang of Four]]. In the second half, Dillard hosts a group of Chinese writers, whom she takes to [[Disneyland]] along with [[Allen Ginsberg]]. Dillard describes it as "hilarious".&lt;ref name="official-books"/&gt;

===''The Writing Life''===
''The Writing Life'' (1989) is a collection of short essays in which Dillard "discusses with clear eye and wry wit how, where and why she writes".&lt;ref&gt;Dillard, ''The Writing Life'', back cover&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' called it "a kind of spiritual ''Strunk &amp; White'', a small and brilliant guidebook to the landscape of a writer's task." ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'' wrote that, "For nonwriters, it is a glimpse into the trials and satisfactions of a life spent with words. For writers, it is a warm, rambling conversation with a stimulating and extraordinarily talented colleague." ''The Detroit News'' called it "a spare volume...that has the power and force of a detonating bomb."&lt;ref name="official-books"/&gt; According to a biography of Dillard written by her husband Robert D. Richardson and posted on her official website, Dillard "repudiates ''The Writing Life'', except for the last chapter, the true story of stunt pilot [[Dave Rahm]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anniedillard.com/biography-by-bob-richardson.html|last=Richardson|first=Bob|authorlink=Robert D. Richardson|title=Biography of Annie Dillard by Bob Richardson|year=2015|accessdate=July 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Living''===
Dillard's first novel, ''The Living'' (1992), centers around the first European settlers of the [[Pacific Northwest]] coast. While writing the book, she restricted herself from reading works that postdated the time in which ''The Living'' was set, nor did she use [[anachronistic]] words.&lt;ref name="official-books"/&gt;

===''Mornings Like This''===
''Mornings Like This'' (1995) is a book dedicated to [[found poetry]]. Dillard took and arranged phrases from various old books, creating poems that are often ironic in tone. The poems are not related to the original books' themes. "A good trick should look hard and be easy," said Dillard. "These poems were a bad trick. They look easy and are really hard."&lt;ref name="official-books"/&gt;

===''For the Time Being''===
''For the Time Being'' (1999) is a work of narrative nonfiction. Its topics mirror the various chapters of the book and include "birth, sand, China, clouds, numbers, Israel, encounters, thinker, evil, and now." In her own words on this book, she writes, "I quit the Catholic Church and Christianity; I stay near Christianity and Hasidism."&lt;ref name="official-books"/&gt;

===''The Maytrees''===
''The Maytrees'' (2007) is Dillard's second novel. The story, which begins after World War II, tells of a lifelong love between a husband and wife who live in [[Provincetown]], [[Cape Cod]]. It was a finalist for the [[PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="official-books"/&gt;

==Awards==
Dillard's books have been translated into at least 10 languages. Her 1975 Pulitzer-winning book, ''Pilgrim at Tinker Creek'', made Random House's survey of the century's 100 best nonfiction books. The LA Times' survey of the century's 100 best Western novels includes ''The Living''. The century's 100 best spiritual books (ed. Philip Zaleski) also includes Pilgrim at Tinker Creek.  The 100 best essays (ed. Joyce Carol Oates) includes "Total Eclipse," from ''Teaching a Stone to Talk''. ''Pilgrim at Tinker Creek'', in 1999, and ''For the Time Being'', in 2002, both won the Maurice-Edgar Coindreau Prize for Best Translation in English, both translated by Sabine Porte.&lt;ref name="official-cv"&gt;"[http://www.anniedillard.com/curriculum-vitae.html Curriculum Vitae]". Annie Dillard's Official Website. Retrieved December 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Dillard's ''For the Time Being'' received the [[PEN/Diamonstein-Spielvogel Award for the Art of the Essay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pen.org/page.php/prmID/288 PEN American Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606185539/https://www.pen.org/page.php/prmID/288 |date=2012-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

===Relationships===
In 1965 she married her creative writing professor, Richard Dillard,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/annie-dillard-is-born|title=Annie Dillard is born - Apr 30, 1945 - HISTORY.com|work=HISTORY.com|access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, they divorced amicably, and she moved from Roanoke to Lummi Island near [[Bellingham, Washington]]. She taught at [[Western Washington University]] part-time as a writer-in-residence. She later married Gary Clevidence, an anthropology professor at WWU's [[Fairhaven College]], and they have a child, Cody Rose.&lt;ref name=Cantwell&gt;Cantwell, Mary. (April 26, 1992).

===Teaching===
From 1980, Dillard taught for 21 years in the English department of [[Wesleyan University]], in [[Middletown, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="official-cv"/&gt;

===Religion===
After college Dillard says she became "spiritually promiscuous". Her first prose book, ''Pilgrim at Tinker Creek'', makes references not only to [[Christ]] and the [[Bible]], but also to [[Islam]], and [[Judaism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Inuit]] spirituality. Dillard for a while converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] around 1988. This was described in detail in a ''New York Times'' overview of her work in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cantwell |first=Mary |date=April 26, 1992 |title=A Pilgrim's Progress |url= https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/03/28/specials/dillard-pilgrim.html|work= |location=New York |access-date=June 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1994 she won the Campion Award, given to a Catholic writer every year by the editors of ''[[America (Jesuit magazine)|America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Leanne E. (February 25, 2010).

Retrieved November 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In her 1999 book, ''For the Time Being'', she describes her abandonment of Christianity, describing the supposed absurdity of some Christian doctrines, while stating she still stays near Christianity, and continuing to valorize Catholic writer [[Teilhard de Chardin]]. Her personal website lists her religion as "none."&lt;ref name = "official-cv"/&gt;

===Philanthropy===
Her website sells her paintings to benefit the charity Partners in Health, which was founded by Dr. [[Paul Farmer]] to rid the world of infectious disease.&lt;ref name="official-home"&gt;"[http://www.anniedillard.com/ Annie Dillard Official Website]". Retrieved December 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Antarctic Convergence''' or '''Antarctic Polar Front''' is a curve continuously encircling [[Antarctica]], varying in latitude seasonally, where cold, northward-flowing Antarctic waters meet the relatively warmer waters of the [[subantarctic]]. Antarctic waters predominantly sink beneath subantarctic waters, while associated zones of mixing and [[upwelling]] create a zone very high in marine productivity, especially for [[Antarctic krill]]. This line, like the [[Tree line#Arctic|arctic tree line]], is a natural boundary rather than an artificial one like a line of latitude. It not only separates two [[hydrology|hydrological regions]], but also separates areas of distinctive marine life associations and of different [[climate]]s. There is no [[Arctic]] equivalent, due to the amount of land contiguous with the northern polar region.

==History==
The Antarctic Convergence was first crossed by [[Anthony de la Roché]] in 1675,&lt;ref&gt;R.K. Headland, ''The Island of South Georgia'', Cambridge University Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; and described by Sir [[Edmund Halley]] in 1700.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Gurney, ''Below the Convergence: Voyages Toward Antarctica, 1699-1839'', Penguin Books, New York, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The Antarctic Convergence is a zone approximately {{convert|32|to|48|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide, varying in latitude seasonally and in different [[longitude]]s, extending across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], and [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] [[Ocean]]s between the [[48th parallel south|48th]] and [[61st parallel south|61st]] parallels of south latitude. Although the northern boundary varies, for the purposes of the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources 1980, it is defined as "50°S, 0°; 50°S, 30°E; 45°S, 30°E; 45°S, 80°E; 55°S, 80°E; 55°S, 150°E; 60°S, 150°E; 60°S, 50°W; 50°S, 50°W; 50°S, 0°." &lt;ref&gt;Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources 1980, Article 1(4).&lt;/ref&gt; Although this zone is a mobile one, it usually does not stray more than half a degree of latitude from its mean position. The precise location at any given place and time is made evident by the sudden drop in sea water temperature from north to south of, on average, {{convert|2.8|C-change|abbr=on}} from {{convert|5.6|°C|°F|abbr=on}} to below {{convert|2|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5388">Around the world, journalists who report on environmental problems such as [[deforestation]], [[pollution]] and [[climate change]], are forming networks and associations. The largest of these—the [[Society of Environmental Journalists]] in the United States—was formed in 1990 and has over 1400 members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjr.org/the_observatory/environmental_journalism_assoc.php?page=all Fahn, J. 2011. Environmental Journalism Associations Proliferating Worldwide. Columbia Journalism Review], retrieved 31 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, journalists have formed new networks in Africa, Asia and other regions. These activities that these groups undertake include training programmes, advice to journalists, and advocacy to raise the prominence of environmental topics in the media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sej.org/about-sej/vision-and-mission Society of Environmental Journalists - Vision and Mission], retrieved 31 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In Africa and Asia, these networks also act to raise funds to support better quality reporting on [[environmental issues]]. James Fahn, director of the [[Earth Journalism Network]], notes however that donors generally seem less willing to support these journalism associations than they do environmental advocacy groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cjr.org/the_observatory/environmental_journalism_assoc.php?page=all Fahn, J. 2011. Environmental Journalism Associations Proliferating Worldwide. Columbia Journalism Review], retrieved 31 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Networks of environment journalists are able to work in ways that would be impossible for individual reporters. The Philippine Network of Environmental Journalists has, for instance, built an [[SMS]]-based news service that connects [[hyperlocal]] reports on environmental issues and disaster events to a national audience. The project included the development of a new website and trainings held with local journalists and their audiences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://environews.ph/climate-change/reporting-the-environment-in-160-character/Reporting the environment in 160 characters.Philippine Enviro News. 24 July 2013], retrieved 31 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way that such networks have acted is to protest the dangers that environmental journalists face because their reporting challenges powerful elites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/17/when-journalists-are-dying-to-expose-environmental-plunder/?_r=0 Revkin, A. When Journalists Are Dying to Expose Environmental Plunder. New York Times.17 September 2012], retrieved 31 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2012, the Earth Journalism Network and the Society of Environmental Journalists circulated a joint petition calling on the [[Cambodian government]] to launch a full investigation into the murder of environmental journalist [[Hang Serei Odom|Hang Serei Oudom]].

'''Basic precipitation''' or '''Alkaline precipitation''' occurs when either [[calcium oxide]] or [[sodium hydroxide]] is emitted into the [[atmosphere]], absorbed by water droplets in [[cloud]]s, and then falls as [[Precipitation (meteorology)|rain, snow, or sleet]]. Precipitation containing these compounds can increase the [[pH]] of [[soil]] or bodies of water and lead to increased [[fungus|fungal growth]].

The principal cause of basic rain is emissions from factories and waste deposits. Mineral dust containing large amounts of alkaline compounds such as [[calcium carbonate]] can also increase the pH of precipitation and contribute to basic rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Özsoy|first=Türkan|last2=Cemal Saydam|first2=A|date=2000-05-15|title=Acidic and alkaline precipitation in the Cilician Basin, north-eastern Mediterranean Sea|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969700003806|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=253|issue=1–3|pages=93–109|doi=10.1016/S0048-9697(00)00380-6|bibcode=2000ScTEn.253...93O}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basic rain can be viewed as opposite to [[acid rain]].
Acid rain has posed a serious threat to numerous ecosystems surrounding rivers, lakes and forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Acid Rain|url=http://www3.epa.gov/acidrain/|website=U.S Environmental Protection Agency|publisher=[[EPA]]|accessdate=2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Clean Tech Nation: How the U.S. Can Lead in the New Global Economy''''' is a 2012 book written by [[Ron Pernick]] and [[Clint Wilder]]. The book surveys the expansion of [[clean technology]] and [[renewable energy]] over the past decade. It tracks the growth of [[wind power]] and solar [[photovoltaics]] and shows that these markets grew 20 fold from 2000 to 2010. Factors which are driving the global expansion of clean tech are identified, as are the new economic opportunities which are being created. China, the United States, and Germany are leading the way. ''Clean Tech Nation'' is the sequel to the 2007 book ''[[The Clean Tech Revolution]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampentland/2012/09/08/clean-tech-nation-the-scramble-for-clean-tech-supremacy/ |title=Clean Tech Nation: The Scramble for Clean Tech Supremacy |author=William Pentland |date=9/08/2012  |work=Forbes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cleantechnica.com/2012/09/21/clean-tech-nation-book-review/ |title=Clean Tech Nation (Book Review) |author=Adam Johnston |date=September 21, 2012 |work=Clean Technica }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6196">A '''continual power system''' is a large-scale system for reliably supplying large amounts of uninterrupted power. Examples of a continual power system include [[uninterruptible power supply]] and an [[emergency power system]]. The need for a continual power system has risen over the last few decades because energy resources in the market are getting less and at a higher price as the industrial revolution progresses. This is due to several reasons such as the growth in global economy, depletion of energy resources, and the environmental impacts of energy production.&lt;ref&gt;A. Ganjehkaviri, M.N. Mohd Jaafar (2015, January) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196890414008437?np=y "Optimization and the effect of steam turbine outlet quality on the output power of a combined cycle power plant."] "Energy Conversion and Management" 89(1), 231–243&lt;/ref&gt;

The continual power system is one of many power systems that are being funded and used at this time because there is still no standard that exists that clearly defines the roles and responsibilities of the energy provider. As the modern world continues to progress, high-tech users are expected to demand a power supply that is high in security, quality, reliability, and availability. For businesses, reliability and quality is important because they rely on electrical services to provide lighting, general power, computer hardware and communications hardware. The key in reliable power systems is to avoid power disturbances, which are concerned with deviations of the voltage or current from the ideal single-frequency sine wave of constant amplitude and frequency &lt;ref&gt;Moreno-Munoz, A., Juan José González De La Rosa, Flores-Arias, J., Bellido-Outerino, F., &amp; Gil-De-Castro, A. (2011, April) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030626191000334X?np=y “Energy efficiency criteria in uninterruptible power supply."] ''Applied Energy'' 88(4), 1312-1321&lt;/ref&gt;

The desire for continuous and reliable power supply is not just within the business community. On a 2011 study done on Flemish households, the researchers found that only a relatively small share of them would be willing to switch to a lower reliability level if they would be compensated by a not too large bill discount.&lt;ref&gt;Pepermans, G. (2011, December) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030142151100721X?np=y#bib32 "The value of continuous power supply for Flemish households. Energy Policy".] "Energy Policy" 39(12), 7853-7864&lt;/ref&gt; Computer power supplies have the [[AC current|AC]]/[[DC current|DC]] converter in which energy is lost when converted. By relying on a highly efficient DC-only converter, instead of AC/DC, to store energy directly from a fuel cell the efficiency can be increased by up to 50%

==Flywheel==

An example of a continual power system is the [[flywheel]]-based type, which are common on [[colocation (business)|colocation]] sites. These consist of an [[electric motor]], a flywheel, a [[Electric generator|generator]] and a [[diesel engine]]. In normal operation, the electric motor, supplied from the grid, turns the flywheel which in turn turns the generator. In the event of power failure, the flywheel keeps the generator turning while the diesel engine starts. The flywheel is an effective way for governing the FESS for wind power smoothing. It is the range of 89-93% of mean state of charge which means as the blades on the flywheel turn, energy is being stored up between 89-93% of the given output. The idea is to use energy as optimally as possible by means of storing converted through the movement of the flywheel. The electric machine operates the flywheel and as it turns energy is stored.&lt;ref&gt;Díaz-González, Francisco, Andreas Sumper, Oriol Gomis-Bellmunt, and Fernando D. Bianch (October, 2013) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261913003243?np=y "Energy management of flywheel-based energy storage device for wind power smoothing".] "Applied Energy" 110, 207-219&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turbines==
&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Us windmap 80meters 820w.jpg|thumbnail|right|U.S. map of wind speeds at 80 meters]] --&gt;
A [[turbine]] is a set of blades that are forced to turn from an external force. When the blades start turning, the shaft which this is connected to starts to spin, and the connecting generator then creates electricity. Examples of external forces that can be used to get the turbines going include wind, water, steam and gas. Turbines can be used in creating a continual power system because as long as the turbine blades turn, electricity is being created.&lt;ref name="Wind Program"&gt;Energy.gov. (n.d.) [http://energy.gov/eere/wind/how-do-wind-turbines-work “How Do Wind Turbines Work?”] “Office of Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy”&lt;/ref&gt;

==Microbial fuel cells==
[[Microbial fuel cell|Microbial fuel cells]] can create energy when bacteria breaks down organic material, this process a charge that is transferred to the anode. Taking something like human saliva, which has lots of organic material, can be used to power a micro-sized microbial fuel cell. This can produce a small amount of energy to run on-chip applications. This application can be used in things like biomedical devices and cell phones.&lt;ref&gt;Messer, A'ndrea (2014, April) [http://news.psu.edu/story/310362/2014/04/03/research/tiny-power-generator-runs-spit "Tiny power generator runs on spit."] "Penn State"&lt;/ref&gt;

A study on the up flow of microbial fuel cell was developed to create electricity and treat wastewater at the same time. During a five-month time frame it was found that giving the system a sucrose solution continuously generated electricity of 170&amp;nbsp;mW/m2. The power density increased with increasing chemical oxygen demand up to 2.0 g COD/day but there was no increase in power density after that. This shows that while this system can continuously provide electricity it has its limitations.&lt;ref&gt;He, Zhen, et.Al. (2005, June) [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es0502876] "Electricity Generation from Artificial Wastewater Using an Upflow Microbial Fuel Cell"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1489">'''Creosote bush scrub''' is a North American desert [[vegetation type]] (or [[biome]]) of sparsely but evenly spaced desert plants dominated by creosote bush (''[[Larrea tridentata]]'') and its associates.  It's visual characterization is of widely spaced shrubs that are somewhat evenly distributed over flat or relatively flat desert areas that receive between 2 and 8 inches of rain each year.  It covers the majority of the flat desert floor and relatively flat [[alluvial fan]]s in the [[Mojave Desert]], [[Chihuahuan Desert]], and [[Sonoran Desert]]. The dominant plants that typify this vegetation type are creosote bush (''[[Larrea tridentata]]'') and its associates, white bur-sage (''[[Ambrosia dumosa]]''), brittlebush (''[[Encelia farinosa]]'', ''[[Encelia actoni]]'', ''[[Encelia virginensis]]''), cheese-bush (''[[Ambrosia salsola]]''), Mojave yucca (''[[Yucca schidigera]]''), silver cholla cactus (''[[Cylindropuntia echinocarpa]]''), and beavertail cactus (''[[Opuntia basilaris]]'').  Creosote bush has a wider range than its associates, so codominant shrubs, which are associated with more narrow ranges, will vary from region to region.

'''Diamond dust''' is a ground-level [[cloud]] composed of tiny [[ice]] crystals. This [[list of meteorological phenomena|meteorological phenomenon]] is also referred to simply as ''[[ice crystals]]'' and is reported in the [[METAR]] code as '''IC'''. Diamond dust generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies, so it is sometimes referred to as clear-sky [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. Diamond dust is most commonly observed in [[Antarctica]] and the [[Arctic]], but can occur anywhere with a temperature well below freezing. In the [[polar regions of Earth]], diamond dust may persist for several days without interruption.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Diamond Dust - Inari 2013.ogv|thumb|Falling diamond dust (Inari, Finland)]]
Diamond dust is similar to [[fog]] in that it is a cloud based at the surface; however, it differs from fog in two main ways. Generally fog refers to a cloud composed of liquid water (the term [[ice fog]] usually refers to a fog that formed as liquid water and then froze, and frequently seems to occur in valleys with airborne pollution such as [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], while diamond dust forms directly as ice). Also, fog is a dense enough cloud to significantly reduce visibility, while diamond dust is usually very thin and may not have any effect on visibility (there are far fewer crystals in a volume of air than there are droplets in the same volume with fog). However, diamond dust can often reduce the visibility, in some cases to under {{convert|600|m|abbr=on}}.

The depth of the diamond dust layer can vary substantially from as little as {{convert|20|to|30|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|300|m}}. Because diamond dust does not always reduce visibility it is often first noticed by the brief flashes caused when the tiny crystals, tumbling through the air, reflect sunlight to the eye. This glittering effect gives the phenomenon its name since it looks like many tiny diamonds are flashing in the air.

&lt;gallery caption="serial photos of Diamond Dust" widths="180px" heights="240px" perrow="2"&gt;
File:050207diamond dust1 Tsukuba Japan.png|Diamond dust briefly observed at Tsukuba, Japan. These are serial photos out of a movie; note differences in crystal locations.
File:050207diamond dust2 Tsukuba Japan.png|Temperature was -2&amp;nbsp;°C, relative humidity was almost 100%. These photos captured only the glittering particles.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Formation==
[[Image:Sun halo optical phenomenon edit.jpg|thumb|Halo display at the South Pole (1980), featuring a [[parhelion]], [[22° halo]], [[parhelic circle]], [[upper tangent arc]] and [[Parry arc]]. Diamond dust is visible as point-like reflections of individual crystals close to the camera.]][[File:Ischgl Halo.jpg|thumb|Subhorizon halos in [[Ischgl]]: [[subsun]], subparhelion and partial 22° halo, with the glint of ice crystals around the subsun.]]
These ice crystals usually form when a [[Inversion (meteorology)|temperature inversion]] is present at the surface and the warmer air above the ground mixes with the colder air near the surface.&lt;ref name="gloss"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=diamond+dust&amp;submit=Search|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|title=Diamond Dust|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=2010-01-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403084329/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=diamond+dust&amp;submit=Search|archivedate=2009-04-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since warmer air frequently contains more [[water vapor]] than colder air, this mixing will usually also transport water vapor into the air near the surface, causing the [[relative humidity]] of the near-surface air to increase. If the relative humidity increase near the surface is large enough then ice crystals may form.

To form diamond dust the temperature must be below the [[Melting point|freezing point]] of water, {{convert|0|C|abbr=on}}, or the ice cannot form or would melt. However, diamond dust is not often observed at temperatures near {{convert|0|C|abbr=on}}. At temperatures between {{convert|0|C|abbr=on}} and about {{convert|-39|C|abbr=on}} increasing the relative humidity can cause either fog or diamond dust. This is because very small droplets of water can remain liquid well below the freezing point, a state known as [[Supercooling|supercooled]] water. In areas with a lot of small particles in the air, from human pollution or natural sources like dust, the water droplets are likely to be able to freeze at a temperature around {{convert|-10|C|abbr=on}}, but in very clean areas, where there are no particles ([[Ice nucleus|ice nuclei]]) to help the droplets freeze, they can remain liquid to {{convert|-39|C|abbr=on}}, at which point even very tiny, pure water droplets will freeze. In the interior of Antarctica diamond dust is fairly common at temperatures below about {{convert|-25|C|abbr=on}}.

Artificial diamond dust can form from snow machines which blow ice crystals into the air. These are found at ski resorts.

==Optical properties==

Diamond dust is often associated with [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]]s, such as [[sun dogs]], [[light pillar]]s, etc. Like the ice crystals in [[cirrus cloud|cirrus]] or [[cirrostratus cloud]]s, diamond dust crystals form directly as simple hexagonal ice crystals — as opposed to freezing drops —&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=[[California Institute of Technology]]|url=http://www.its.caltech.edu/~atomic/publist/engsci2.pdf|page=12|year=2001|author=Kenneth G. Libbrecht|title=Morphogenesis on Ice: The Physics of Snow Crystals|journal=Engineering &amp; Science|number=1|accessdate=2001-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and generally form slowly. This combination results in crystals with well defined shapes - usually either hexagonal plates or columns - which, like a prism, can [[reflection (physics)|reflect]] and/or [[Refraction|refract]] light in specific directions.

==Climatology==
While diamond dust can be seen in any area of the world that has cold winters, it is most frequent in the interior of Antarctica, where it is common year-round. Schwerdtfeger (1970) shows that diamond dust was observed on average 316 days a year at [[Plateau Station]] in Antarctica, and Radok and Lile (1977) estimate that over 70% of the precipitation that fell at Plateau Station in 1967 fell in the form of diamond dust. Once melted, the total precipitation for the year was only {{convert|25|mm|abbr=on}}.

==Weather reporting and interference==
Diamond dust may sometimes cause a problem for [[automated airport weather station]]s. The [[ceilometer]] and visibility sensor do not always correctly interpret the falling diamond dust and report the visibility and ceiling as zero (overcast skies). However, a human observer would correctly notice clear skies and unrestricted visibility. The METAR identifier for diamond dust within international hourly weather reports is IC.&lt;ref name="METAR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alaska.faa.gov/fai/afss/metar+taf/sametara.htm |title=SA-METAR|author=Alaska Air Flight Service Station|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Administration]] via the Internet Wayback Machine|accessdate=2009-08-29|date=2007-04-10 }}{{dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dielectric-barrier discharge''' ('''DBD''') is the [[electrical discharge]] between two [[electrodes]] separated by an insulating [[dielectric]] barrier. Originally called silent (inaudible) discharge and also known as [[ozone]] production discharge&lt;ref&gt;Matsuno, Hiromitsu, Nobuyuki Hishinuma, Kenichi Hirose, Kunio Kasagi, Fumitoshi Takemoto, Yoshinori Aiura, and TatsushiIgarashi.

The lines between the dielectric and the electrode are representative of the discharge filaments, which are normally visible to the naked eye. Below this, the photograph shows an atmospheric DBD discharge occurring in between two steel electrode plates, each covered with a [[dielectric]] ([[mica]]) sheet. The filaments are columns of conducting plasma, and the foot of each filament is representative of the surface accumulated charge.

== Process ==
The process normally uses high voltage [[alternating current]], ranging from lower [[Radio frequency|RF]]  to [[microwave]] frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaef.de/EAC2009/EAC2009abstracts/T06%20Electrical%20effects/T062A04.pdf |title=Aerosol charge distributions in Dielectric Barrier Discharges |work=Publication date 2009 |publisher=European Aerosol Conference 2009 Karlsruhe |accessdate=2010-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719030536/http://www.gaef.de/EAC2009/EAC2009abstracts/T06%20Electrical%20effects/T062A04.pdf |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other methods were developed to extend the frequency range all the way down to the DC. One method was to use a high resistivity layer to cover one of the electrodes. This is known as the resistive barrier discharge.&lt;ref name=laroussi&gt;M. Laroussi, I. Alexeff, J. P. Richardson, and F. F. Dyer " The Resistive Barrier Discharge", IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci. 30, 158 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Another technique using a semiconductor layer of gallium arsenide ([[GaAs]]) to replace the dielectric layer, enables these devices to be driven by a DC voltage between 580&amp;nbsp;V and 740&amp;nbsp;V.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepages.cwi.nl/~ebert/ICPIG07-RafSij.pdf|title=Structure formation in a DC-driven "barrier" discharge stability analysis and numerical solutions|work=Publication date July 15–20, 2007|publisher=ICPIG Prague, Czech Republic|accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
DBD devices can be made in many configurations, typically planar, using parallel plates separated by a [[dielectric]] or cylindrical, using [[coaxial]] plates with a dielectric tube between them.&lt;ref name=kraus&gt;Kraus, Martin, Baldur Eliasson, Ulrich Kogelschatzb, and Alexander Wokauna. [http://www.rsc.org/ej/CP/2001/b007015g.pdf CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reforming of methane by the combination of dielectric-barrier discharges and catalysis] Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics, 2001, 3, 294-300. Retrieved on 2007-08-05.&lt;/ref&gt; In a common coaxial configuration, the dielectric is shaped in the same form as common [[fluorescent]] tubing. It is filled at atmospheric pressure with either a rare gas or rare gas-[[halide]] mix, with the glass walls acting as the dielectric barrier. Due to the atmospheric pressure level, such processes require high energy levels to sustain. Common dielectric materials include glass, quartz, ceramics and polymers. The gap distance between electrodes varies considerably, from less than 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm in plasma displays, several millimetres in ozone generators and up to several centimetres in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lasers.

Depending on the geometry, DBD can be generated in a volume (VDBD) or on a surface (SDBD). For VDBD the plasma is generated between two electrodes, for example between two parallel plates with a dielectric in between. At SDBD the microdischarges are generated on the surface of a dielectric, which results in a more homogeneous plasma than can be achieved using the VDBD configuration &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gibalov, V.

A particular compact and economic DBD plasma generator can be built based on the principles of the [[Piezoelectric direct discharge plasma | piezoelectric direct discharge]]. In this technique, the high voltage is generated with a piezo-transformer, the secondary circuit of which acts also as the high voltage electrode. Since the transformer material is a dielectric, the produced electric discharge resembles properties of the dielectric barrier discharge.&lt;ref&gt;M. Teschke and J. Engemann, Contrib.

== Operation ==
A multitude of random arcs form in operation gap exceeding 1.5&amp;nbsp;mm between the two electrodes during discharges in gases at the atmospheric pressure .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/25/55/61/PDF/ajp-jp4199707C405.pdf|title=Dielectric-Barrier Discharges.

Similar to other electrical discharge methods, the contained [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] is sustained if the continuous energy source provides the required degree of [[ionization]], overcoming the recombination process leading to the extinction of the discharge plasma. Such recombinations are directly proportional to the collisions between the molecules and in turn to the pressure of the gas, as explained by [[Paschen's Law]]. The discharge process causes the emission of an energetic [[photon]], the frequency and energy of which corresponds to the type of gas used to fill the discharge gap.

== [[I-V characteristic]] of DBD ==

[[File:Fig1DBD.tif|thumb|Fig. 1. Electric diagram of DBD device]]

The electrical diagram of the DBD device at the absence of discharge can be presented in the form shown in Fig. 1 where &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; is capacitance of dielectric adjacent to one of two electrodes and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;  is capacitance of the air (or gas) gap between the dielectric within the adjacent electrode footprint and the ground electrode. &lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_p&lt;/math&gt; are capacity and resistance modeling electric response of plasma. 
	If a switch &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;  connects the capacitors &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;  shown in Fig. 1 (there is no electrical breakdown), the voltage generator is connected to a circuit comprising two capacitors &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt;  and  &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; connected in a series circuit. A capacitance of this circuit can be expressed as

&lt;math&gt;C_s = \frac{C_1C_2}{C_1 + C_2}&lt;/math&gt;,					      (1)

and the electric current &lt;math&gt;I(t)&lt;/math&gt;  through this circuit can be expressed in the form

&lt;math&gt;I(t) = C_s \frac{dU}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;,        (2)
                                                                    
[[File:Fig2 DBD.tif|thumb|Fig. 2. Typical oscillograms of DBD voltage U(t) and current I(t)]]

where &lt;math&gt;U(t)&lt;/math&gt;  is a generator voltage. Oscillograms&lt;math&gt;U(t)&lt;/math&gt;    and &lt;math&gt;I(t)&lt;/math&gt;   obtained in the case of the electrical breakdown of the operating gap, switch &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; in Fig. 1 is connected to &lt;math&gt;R_p&lt;/math&gt;,    are presented in Fig. 2. 
	We are going to describe, in a first order of approximation, the plasma response to voltage &lt;math&gt;U_g(t)&lt;/math&gt;   applied to the gap in the same way as a series circuit of two invariable components &lt;math&gt;R_p&lt;/math&gt;   and&lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt;.  To proof this assumption valuability, let us express the value &lt;math&gt;U_g(t)&lt;/math&gt; in the form

&lt;math&gt;U_g(t) = U(t) - \frac{1}{C_1}\int\limits_{t}^{0}I(t_1)dt_1 +U_0&lt;/math&gt;, (3)

where the second term on the right hand side is a drop in potential on the capacitor &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;U_0&lt;/math&gt; is the integration constant. 
The current &lt;math&gt;I(t)&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in terms of the voltage &lt;math&gt;U_g(t)&lt;/math&gt; and values  &lt;math&gt;R_p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt;. For this purpose, let us present the value &lt;math&gt;U_g(t)&lt;/math&gt; in the form of sum

&lt;math&gt;U_g(t) = U_{Rp} + U_{Cp}&lt;/math&gt;, (4)

where &lt;math&gt;U_{Rp}(t)&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;U_{Cp}(t)&lt;/math&gt;  represent the drops in potential on the resistor  &lt;math&gt;R_p&lt;/math&gt;  and capacitor&lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt;   respectively. Taking into account that the electric current through the circuit can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;I(t) = C_p(dU_{Cp}/dt)&lt;/math&gt; and consequently,

&lt;math&gt;U_{Rp}(t) = R_p I(t) = R_p C_p(dU_{Cp}/dt)&lt;/math&gt;,

the equation (4) can be rewritten as the standard linear differential equation

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dU_{Cp}(t)}{dt} + \frac{1}{R_pC_p}U_{Cp}(t) = \frac{1}{R_pC_p}U_g(t)&lt;/math&gt;,  (5)

which solution is

&lt;math&gt;U_{Cp}(t) = \frac{1}{R_pC_p}\exp (-t/R_pC_p)\left(\int\limits_{0}^{t}U_g(t_1)\exp (t_1/R_pC_p)dt_1 + C_{int}\right)&lt;/math&gt;,                                                                                                    (6)

where &lt;math&gt;C_{int}&lt;/math&gt;  is the integration constant. Differentiating Equation (6) with respect to &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;  and substituting the result in Equation (5), one can express the current &lt;math&gt;I(t)&lt;/math&gt;  in terms of the voltage &lt;math&gt;U_g(t)&lt;/math&gt;  and values &lt;math&gt;R_p&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt;:

[[File:Fig3 DBD.tif|thumb|Fig. 3. Actual (black curve) and theoretical (grey curve) currents I(t) through DBD]]

&lt;math&gt;I(t) = \frac{1}{R_p}\left[ U_g(t) - \frac{\exp (-t/R_pC_p)}{R_pC_p}\left( \int\limits_{0}^{t}U_g(t_1)\exp (t_1/R_pC_p)dt_1 + C_{int} \right) \right]&lt;/math&gt;,  (7)

where

&lt;math&gt;U_g = U_p + \Delta U&lt;/math&gt;,  (8)

&lt;math&gt;U_p&lt;/math&gt;  is drop in potential on plasma, and &lt;math&gt;\Delta U&lt;/math&gt;  is the constant near-electrode drop in potential. Four parameters: &lt;math&gt;R_p&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tau = R_pC_p&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;\Delta U&lt;/math&gt;, and  &lt;math&gt; C_{int} &lt;/math&gt;  can be found by procedure of fitting of the theoretical function &lt;math&gt; I(t)&lt;/math&gt;, calculated from the experimental value &lt;math&gt; U_g(t)&lt;/math&gt;    by equation (7), with the actual electric current &lt;math&gt; I(t)&lt;/math&gt;   measured in experiment. Results of the least square fitting, corresponding to some particular case, are shown in Fig. 3. For detail of the equation (7) derivation and possibilities to analyse DBD parameters, see Ref.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Evgeny V. Shun’ko and Veniamin V.

== Applications ==

=== Usage of generated radiation ===
DBDs can be used to generate optical radiation by the relaxation of excited species in the plasma. The main application here is the generation of UV-radiation. Such [[Excimer lamp|excimer ultraviolet lamps]] can produce light with short wavelengths which can be used to produce [[ozone]] in industrial scales. Ozone is still used extensively in industrial air and water treatment.&lt;ref name=kraus /&gt; Early 19th-century attempts at commercial nitric acid and ammonia production used DBDs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|title=Nitrogen |volume=16 |page=714–716 |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri19chisrich#page/714/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; as several nitrogen-oxygen compounds are generated as discharge products.&lt;ref name="kogelschatz" /&gt;

=== Usage of the generated plasma ===
Since the 19th century, DBDs were known for their decomposition of different gaseous compounds, such as NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Other modern applications include semiconductor manufacturing, germicidal processes, polymer surface treatment, high-power CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lasers typically used for welding and metal cutting, pollution control and [[Plasma display|plasma displays panels]], [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] [[flow control (fluid)|flow control]]… The relatively lower temperature of DBDs makes it an attractive method of generating plasma at atmospheric pressure.

==== Industry ====
The plasma itself is used to modify or clean ([[plasma cleaning]]) surfaces of materials (e.g. [[polymers]], [[semiconductor]] surfaces), that can also act as dielectric barrier, or to modify gases &lt;ref name="Shun'ko"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Evgeny V. Shun’ko and Veniamin V. Belkin|booktitle=" Cleaning Properties of atomic oxygen excited to metastable state 2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2p&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;(&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)" |publisher=(2007) J.

A dielectric barrier discharge is one method of plasma treatment of textiles at atmospheric pressure and room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:BkOKKfcBXn4J:www.scirp.org/journal/PaperDownload.aspx%3FFileName%3DNS20090900014_81801148.pdf%26paperID%3D2743+ozone+treated+textile+barrier&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgaSKRogWG8O9rM4dF6J1yDzwEzVxLQclCKSnRLOvz_Y2eUJ4l5wega7lSMAUFjKSsvVJzlGhGO-7LqFL5rUMhp3_0GrPQU1sgs34dBieeG59G7FdsbLwQhwvrSh4qe1cCLzGVm&amp;sig=AHIEtbSFZPgkYL3Qb1dRSQsAL4cg9aZg2Q|title=Disinfection of materials|accessdate=2010-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment can be used to modify the surface properties of the textile to improve [[wettability]], improve the [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] of dyes and [[adhesion]], and for [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]]. DBD plasma provides a dry treatment that doesn't generate waste water or require drying of the fabric after treatment. For textile treatment, a DBD system requires a few kilovolts of alternating current, at between 1 and 100 kilohertz. Voltage is applied to insulated electrodes with a millimetre-size gap through which the textile passes.&lt;ref&gt;The Textile Institute, ''Sustainable textiles'', CRC Press, {{ISBN|978-1-84569-453-1}} page 156&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[excimer lamp]] can be used as a powerful source of short-wavelength ultraviolet light, useful in chemical processes such as surface cleaning of semiconductor wafers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.siliconfareast.com/dielectric.htm|title=Dielectric|publisher=Siliconfareast.com 2001-2006|accessdate=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lamp relies on a dielectric barrier discharge in an atmosphere of xenon and other gases to produce the excimers.

An additional process when using [[chlorine]] gas for removal of bacteria and organic contaminates in drinking water supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ispc-conference.org/ispcproc/papers/423.pdf|title=Dielectric barrier discharge system with catalytically active porous segment for improvement of water treatment|publisher=Department of Physics, University of West Bohemia, Univerzitni 22, 306 14 Plzen, Czech Republic 2008|accessdate=9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;Treatment of public swimming baths, aquariums and fish ponds involves the use of [[ultraviolet radiation]] produced when a dielectric mixture of [[xenon]] gas and glass are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atguv.com/uv_vs_chlorine/|title=UV v.s Chlorine|publisher=Atguv.com 2010|accessdate=9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/7855497.html|title=Dielectric barrier discharge lamp comprising an UV-B phosphor|publisher=Freepatentsonline.com 12/21/2010|accessdate=9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Medicine ====
Dielectric barrier discharges were used to generate relatively large volume diffuse plasmas at atmospheric pressure and applied to inactivate bacteria in the mid 1990s.&lt;ref name=laroussi2&gt;M. Laroussi, "Sterilization of contaminated matter with an atmospheric pressure plasma", IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci. 24, 1188 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;This eventually led to the development of a new field of applications, the biomedical applications of plasmas.  In the field of biomedical application, three main approaches have emerged: direct therapy,
surface modification, and plasma polymer deposition. Last one, generating polymer coatings, have been attracting large interest in field of biomaterials and generally in healthcare industry. Plasma polymers proved to have ability to control and steer biological–biomaterial interactions(i.e.adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation) or inhibition of bacteria adhesion. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Czuba |first1=Urszula |last2=Quintana |first2=Robert |last3=De Pauw-Gillet |first3=Marie-Claire |last4=Bourguignon |first4=Maxime |last5=Moreno-Couranjou |first5=Maryline |last6=Alexandre |first6=Michael |last7=Detrembleur |first7=Christophe |last8=Choquet |first8=Patrick |title=Atmospheric Plasma Deposition of Methacrylate Layers Containing Catechol/Quinone Groups: An Alternative to Polydopamine Bioconjugation for Biomedical Applications |journal=Advanced Healthcare Materials |date=June 2018 |volume=7 |issue=11 |pages=1701059 |doi=10.1002/adhm.201701059}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in [[plasma actuator]]s as active [[Flow control (fluid)|flow control]] devices is growing rapidly due to their lack of mechanical parts, light weight and high response frequency.&lt;ref name="Roth 2001"&gt;{{cite book

== Properties ==
Due to their nature, these devices have the following properties:
*  capacitive electric load: low [[Power Factor]] in range of 0.1 to 0.3
*  high ignition voltage 1–10 kV
*  huge amount of energy stored in electric field - requirement of energy recovery if DBD is not driven continuously
*  voltages and currents during discharge event have major influence on discharge behaviour (filamented, homogeneous).

Operation with continuous sine waves or square waves is mostly used in high power industrial installations. Pulsed operation of DBDs may lead to higher discharge efficiencies.

== Driving circuits ==

Drivers for this type of electric load are power HF-generators that in many cases contain a transformer for high voltage generation. They resemble the control gear used to operate  [[compact fluorescent lamp]]s or [[cold cathode fluorescent lamp]]s. The operation mode and the topologies of circuits to operate [DBD] lamps with continuous sine or square waves are similar to those standard drivers. In these cases, the energy that is stored in the DBD's capacitance does not have to be recovered to the intermediate supply after each ignition. Instead, it  stays within the circuit (oscillates between the [DBD]'s capacitance and at least one inductive component of the circuit) and only the [[real power]], that is consumed by the lamp, has to be provided by the power supply. Differently, drivers for pulsed operation suffer from rather low power factor and in many cases must fully recover the DBD's energy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3275">'''Dry quicksand''' is loose [[sand]] whose [[bulk density]] is reduced by blowing air through it and which yields easily to weight or pressure. It acts similarly to normal [[quicksand]], but it does not contain any water and does not operate on the same principle. Dry quicksand is an example of a [[granular material]].

Historically, the existence of dry quicksand was doubted, and the reports of humans and complete caravans being lost in dry quicksand were considered to be [[folklore]]. In 2004, it was created in the laboratory,&lt;ref name="lohse2004"/&gt; but it is still not clear what its actual prevalence in nature is.

==Scientific research==
Writing in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', [[physicist]] [[Detlef Lohse]] and coworkers of [[University of Twente]] in [[Enschede]], [[Netherlands]] allowed [[air]] to flow through very fine [[sand]] (typical grain diameter was about 40 [[micrometre|micrometers]]) in a container with a perforated base. They then turned the air stream off before the start of the experiment and allowed the sand to settle: the [[Packing density|packing fraction]] of this sand was only 41% (compared to 55&amp;ndash;60% for untreated sand).&lt;ref name="lohse2004"&gt;{{Citation |first=Detlef |last=Lohse |first2=Remco |last2=Rauhé |first3=Raymond |last3=Bergmann |lastauthoramp=yes |first4=Devaraj |last4=van der Meer |title=Creating a dry variety of quicksand |journal=Nature |volume=432 |issue=7018 |pages=689–690 |year=2004 |doi=10.1038/432689a |bibcode = 2004Natur.432..689L |pmid=15592401}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lohse found that a weighted [[table tennis]] ball (radius 2&amp;nbsp;cm, mass 133 g), when released from just above the surface of the sand, would sink to about five diameters. Lohse also observed a "straight jet of sand [shooting] violently into the air after about 100 ms". Objects are known to make a [[Splash (fluid mechanics)|splash]] when they hit sand, but this type of jet had never been described before.

Lohse concluded that

:In [[nature]], dry quicksands may evolve from the [[sedimentation]] of very fine sand after it has been blown into the air and, if large enough, might be a threat to [[humans]]. Indeed, reports that travellers and whole [[vehicle]]s have been swallowed instantly may even turn out to be credible in the light of our results.&lt;ref name="lohse2004"/&gt;

During the planning of the [[Project Apollo]] moon missions, dry quicksand on the moon was considered as a potential danger to the missions. The successful landings of the unmanned [[Surveyor program|Surveyor]] probes a few years earlier and their observations of a solid, rocky surface largely discounted this possibility, however. The large plates at the end of legs of the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] were designed to reduce this danger, but the [[astronaut]]s did not encounter dry quicksand.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33088">'''Energy in Bhutan''' has been a primary focus of development in the kingdom under its [[Five-Year Plans of Bhutan|Five-Year Plans]]. In cooperation with [[India]], [[Bhutan]] has undertaken several [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] projects whose output is traded between the countries. Though [[Bhutan]]'s many [[hydroelectric plant]]s provide energy far in excess of its needs in the summer, dry winters and increased fuel demand makes the kingdom a marginal net importer of energy from [[India]].&lt;ref name=BO-adb1/&gt;&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;

As of 2011, the Bhutanese government supplied electricity to 60 percent of rural households,&lt;ref name=BO-adb1/&gt; a significant increase from about 20 percent in 2003.&lt;ref name=Page/&gt;&lt;ref name=LP&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhutan |first1=Lindsay |last1=Brown |first2=Stan |last2=Armington |edition=3 |publisher=[[Lonely Planet]] |year=2007 |isbn=1-74059-529-7 |pages=24, 151, 167, 198 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s-L8NUlW_QgC |accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 2,500 people used solar power throughout Bhutan.&lt;ref name=BO-adb1/&gt; Even where electricity was available for lighting, most rural households cooked by wood fire. Rural homes were often heated with [[firewood]], [[kerosene]], or [[liquid petroleum gas]].&lt;ref name=BO-dung&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/from-dung-to-clean-energy/ |title=From Dung to Clean Energy |date=2010-08-31 |first=Sonam |last=Pelden |publisher=[[Bhutan Observer]] online |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201235507/http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/from-dung-to-clean-energy/ |archivedate=2011-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhutan has no natural [[petroleum]] or [[natural gas]] reserves. The kingdom has some 1.3 million tonnes of [[coal]] reserves, but extracts only about 1,000 tonnes of coal yearly, entirely for domestic consumption. Bhutan also imports oil at some 1,000 barrels per day.&lt;ref name=Page&gt;{{cite journal|title=Asia &amp; Pacific Review 2003/04: The Economic and Business Report |journal=Asia and Pacific Review |first=Kogan |last=Page |edition=21 |publisher=Kogan Page Publishers |year=2003 |isbn=0-7494-4063-5 |page=31 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z1cpiEJMAi8C |accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most oil imports supplied fuel for [[automobile]]s.&lt;ref name=AIM&gt;{{cite book|title=Climate Policy Assessment for India: Applications of Asia-Pacific Integrated Model (AIM) |first=P.

==Government agencies and operations==
Until 2002, Bhutan's energy sector was overseen by the Ministry of Trade and Industry, Department of Power. In 2002, reforms in the executive [[Lhengye Zhungtshog]] produced three new bodies under the [[Ministry of Economic Affairs (Bhutan)|Ministry of Economic Affairs]]: the Department of Energy, its subsidiary Bhutan Electricity Authority,&lt;ref name=BEA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bea.gov.bt/about.php |title=About Us |publisher=Bhutan Electricity Authority |date=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910052848/http://www.bea.gov.bt/about.php |archivedate=2011-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Bhutan Power Corporation. While the Department formulates policy, planning, and coordination, the Authority is the main regulatory agency of the energy sector. Since 2006, the Authority has had the authority to impose differential tariff structures on low, medium, and high voltage consumers.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;

Through 2011, the Bhutan Power Corporation remained a publicly held corporation, comprising about 9 percent of the nation's civil service, though its long-term goals included privatization.&lt;ref name=BPC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpc.bt/about-us |title=About Us |publisher=Bhutan Power Corporation |accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, 2009, Bhutan Power Corporation had 91,770 customers across the country, out of which 47,846 were rural domestic users.&lt;ref name=BO-adb1/&gt; It planned and built hydroelectric plants under a licensure scheme regulating the size and output of projects.&lt;ref name=BO-small&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/bpcl%E2%80%99s-first-small-hydropower-plant/ |title=BPCL's First Small Hydropower Plant |date=2008-11-28 |first=Sonam |last=Rinchen |publisher=[[Bhutan Observer]] online |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616184636/http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/bpcl%E2%80%99s-first-small-hydropower-plant/ |archivedate=2012-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, the government amalgamated its three wholly owned hydroelectric companies — Chukha Hydro Power Corporation, Basochhu Hydro Power Corporation, and Kurichhu Hydro Power Corporation — into Druk Green Power Corporation.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; In addition to its first three plants, Druk Green assumed control of [[Tala Hydroelectricity Project|Tala Hydropower Plant]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drukgreen.bt/Article.aspx?a=628&amp;c=223 |title=Druk Green at Work |publisher=Druk Green |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426011432/http://www.drukgreen.bt/Article.aspx?a=628&amp;c=223 |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Druk Green operates as a holding company to oversee and accelerate hydropower and alternative energy development.&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.org/Documents/RRPs/BHU/37399-BHU-RRP.pdf |format=PDF |title=Bhutan: Green Power Development Project |publisher=Asian Development Bank |date=October 2008 |accessdate=2011-11-29 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Bhutan Power Corporation and Druk Green are owned by Druk Holding and Investments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/dhi-companies-exceed-targets/ |title=DHI Companies Exceed Targets |date=2010-06-15 |first=Sonam |last=Pelden |publisher=[[Bhutan Observer]] online |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616184937/http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/dhi-companies-exceed-targets/ |archivedate=2012-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/dhi-companies-sign-compact-for-2010/ |title=DHI Companies Sign Compact for 2010 |date=2010-07-31 |publisher=[[Bhutan Observer]] online |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203195016/http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/dhi-companies-sign-compact-for-2010/ |archivedate=2011-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which exercises oversight in the investment and development activities of the energy companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/hydropower-spirituality-ecology-nexus/ |title=Hydropower, Spirituality, Ecology Nexus |date=2010-04-09 |first=Rabi C |last=Dahal |publisher=[[Bhutan Observer]] online |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004155540/http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/hydropower-spirituality-ecology-nexus/ |archivedate=2012-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both companies faced decreased profit margins largely because of losses due to increased energy price on repurchase from [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/all-is-not-aplenty-with-bpc/ |title=All is not Aplenty with BPC |date=2010-07-14 |first=Sonam |last=Pelden |publisher=[[Bhutan Observer]] online |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709225856/http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/all-is-not-aplenty-with-bpc/ |archivedate=2012-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/cheap-domestic-power-not-viable/ |title=Cheap Domestic Power Not Viable |date=2010-05-29 |first=Sonam |last=Pelden |publisher=[[Bhutan Observer]] online |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126080757/http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/cheap-domestic-power-not-viable/ |archivedate=2011-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production and consumption==
In the early 21st century, about 70 percent of all energy consumption in Bhutan was in the household sector.&lt;ref name=Page/&gt; Heating and cooking with [[firewood]] in particular accounted for between 70 and 90 percent of total energy consumption and virtually 100 percent of household energy consumption.&lt;ref name=PNADA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNADA886.pdf |format=PDF |title=Regional Hydro-power Resources: Status of Development and Barriers |publisher=[[USAID]] |date=September 2002 |page=1.2 |accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, commercial activities in Bhutan were fueled mostly by [[hydroelectricity]] (about 97%), some fossil-fuel based [[thermal power]] (about 3%), and a minimal amount of other [[fossil fuels]].&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;&lt;ref name=AIM/&gt; As a result, Bhutan sold much of its hydroelectricity to [[India]] during summer months.

To date, the Bhutanese electric energy supply has been virtually entirely [[hydroelectric]]. Due to the vulnerability of the water supply amid climate change, the Bhutanese government began exploring alternative energies such as [[solar power|solar]], [[wind power|wind]], and [[biogas]] energy in the early 21st century.&lt;ref name=BO-beyond&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/looking-beyond-hydropower/ |title=Looking beyond Hydropower |date=2010-04-02 |first=Sonam |last=Pelden |publisher=[[Bhutan Observer]] online |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003050052/http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/looking-beyond-hydropower/ |archivedate=2011-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydropower plants===
Bhutan operates four major [[hydroelectric plant|hydroelectric facilities]], several small and mini hydroelectric generators, and a handful of further sites in development. Many of the small and mini hydropower plants in Bhutan serve remote villages that remain disconnected from the main power grid. Almost all of hydroelectric plants in Bhutan generate power through [[run-of-the-river hydroelectricity]].&lt;ref name=B8-hydro/&gt;

Earlier international efforts were mostly supported by grants from [[India]], though later projects became majority loan-based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/bhutan-water-and-hydropower/ |title=Bhutan, Water and Hydropower |date=2010-01-28 |first=Kuenga |last=Gyeltshen |publisher=[[Bhutan Observer]] online |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124005253/http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/bhutan-water-and-hydropower/ |archivedate=2011-11-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sovereign and multinational contributors, including the government of [[Austria]] and the [[Asian Development Bank]], have also funded and developed Bhutan's hydroelectric projects. In the early 2010s, Bhutan began to shift its focus to public-private partnerships for future development,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/ppp-projects-expected-11th-plan/ |title=More PPP Projects Expected in 11th Plan |date=2011-11-19 |first=Pushkar |last=Chhetri |publisher=[[Bhutan Observer]] online |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128221001/http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/ppp-projects-expected-11th-plan/ |archivedate=2011-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/dgpc-draws-up-10-year-investment-plans/ |title=DCPG Draws Up 10-Year Investment Plans |date=2010-11-12 |first=Sonam |last=Pelden |publisher=[[Bhutan Observer]] online |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004151831/http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/dgpc-draws-up-10-year-investment-plans/ |archivedate=2012-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; however the process and requirements have operated to exclude many Bhutanese contracting firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/bhutanese-contractors-phpa-cry-foul/ |title=Bhutanese Contractors at PHPA Cry Foul |date=2011-08-13 |first=Sonam |last=Pelden |publisher=[[Bhutan Observer]] online |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129033627/http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/bhutanese-contractors-phpa-cry-foul/ |archivedate=2011-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/local-contractors-left/ |title=Local Contractors Still Left Out |date=2011-10-01 |first=Pushkar |last=Chhetri |publisher=[[Bhutan Observer]] online |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128152034/http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/local-contractors-left/ |archivedate=2011-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chukha Hydropower Project====
The Chukha Hydropower Project, or Chukha Hydel, was Bhutan's first mega power project. Its construction started in the 1970s, it was commissioned in 1986, and Bhutan assumed full control in 1991. During the summer, the plant generates 336 MW from four [[turbine]]s off the flow of the [[Raidāk River|Wangchhu]] river in central [[Chukha District]], between [[Thimphu]] and [[Phuentsholing]]. The project cost [[Bhutanese ngultrum|Nu]]2.46 billion, wholly funded by the [[Government of India]], 60 percent under grants and 40 percent under a fifteen-year loan at 5 percent interest.&lt;ref name=B8-chukha&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bhutan2008.bt/en/node/235 |title=1986 – Chhukha Hydropower Project Commissioned |work=Bhutan 2008 |publisher=[[Government of Bhutan]] |date=2011-11-21 |accessdate=2011-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115230308/http://www.bhutan2008.bt/en/node/235 |archivedate=2011-11-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=embassy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianembassythimphu.bt/mega.html |title=Mega Projects |publisher=Indian Embassy in Thimphu |date=2010-07-20 |accessdate=2011-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, two diversion pipes from neighboring rivers were built to make up for the Wangchhu's decreased river flow during dry winter months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/chp-generates-more-power/ |title=CHP Generates More Power |date=2009-11-25 |publisher=[[Bhutan Observer]] online |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004180955/http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/chp-generates-more-power/ |archivedate=2012-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Chukha's energy is exported to [[West Bengal]], [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], and [[Sikkim]]. Chukha was the kingdom's greatest source of income until the [[Tala Hydroelectricity Project|Tala Hydropower Project]] was commissioned in 2007. Between 2005 and 2006, Chukha alone contributed over 30 percent to Bhutan's total revenue.&lt;ref name=B8-hydro&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutan2008.bt/en/node/464 |title=Hydro Electricity Power |work=Bhutan 2008 |publisher=[[Government of Bhutan]] |date=2011-11-20 |accessdate=2011-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825235609/http://www.bhutan2008.bt/en/node/464 |archivedate=2011-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=B8-chukha/&gt; The plant is operated by Druk Green.

====Tala Hydropower Project====
{{main|Tala Hydroelectric Power Station}}

[[Tala Hydroelectricity Project|Tala]] is a six-[[turbine]] conventional [[penstock]] hydroelectric facility located a few kilometers downstream from the Chukha plant in [[Chukha District]]. Tala has a generative capacity of 1,020 MW, sourced by some 40 kilometers of tunnel and a net drop of 860 meters in elevation. The facility also contains a 92 meter high concrete dam and underground power house. Since full operations began in 2007, it has surpassed Chukha as Bhutan's leading power site. Like Chukha, Tala was wholly financed by [[India]], 60 percent by grant and 40 percent through loans.&lt;ref name=B8-hydro/&gt;&lt;ref name=embassy/&gt; Druk Green assumed control of Tala in April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/dipping-business-in-gedu/ |title=Dipping Business in Gedu |date=2009-11-17 |publisher=[[Bhutan Observer]] online |first=Sonam |last=Pelden |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004180059/http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/dipping-business-in-gedu/ |archivedate=2012-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.power-technology.com/projects/tala/ |title=Tala Hydroelectric Project |publisher=Power Technology online |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kurichhu Hydropower Project====
The Kurichhu Hydropower Project, located on [[Kuri Chhu|Kurichhu]] river in [[Mongar District]], provides electricity to eight [[districts of Bhutan|districts]] ([[Mongar District|Mongar]], [[Lhuentse District|Lhuentse]], [[Trashigang District|Trashigang]], [[Trashiyangtse District|Trashiyangtse]], [[Pemagatshel District|Pemagatshel]], [[Samdrup Jongkhar District|Samdrup Jongkhar]], [[Sarpang District|Sarpang]], and [[Zhemgang District|Zhemgang]]) in eastern Bhutan. Like the Chukha project, Kurichhu was wholly financed by [[India]], 60 percent in grants and 40 percent in loans.&lt;ref name=B8-hydro/&gt;&lt;ref name=embassy/&gt;

The Kurichhu facility consists of a dam, its 1 million cubic meter capacity cement reservoir, and four [[turbine]]s. The plant became operational on a staggered basis between April 2001 and May 2002. It generates 60 MW of electricity, much of which is exported to India.&lt;ref name=B8-hydro/&gt;&lt;ref name=embassy/&gt; Druk Green operates the Kurichhu plant.

====Basochhu Hydropower Project====
The Basochhu power plant I and II, located near [[Wangdue Phodrang]], were built with [[Austria]]n technical and financial assistance. Basochhu I has a capacity of 24 MW and Basochhu II has a capacity of 40MW. The plant is fully computerized. The plant's turbines are powered by water on a fall.&lt;ref name=B8-hydro/&gt; Basochhu is operated by Druk Green.

The erection works for Basochhu were started in 1997. In 2004 Basochhu II were set into operation.

====Punatsangchhu-I Hydroelectric Project====
As of September 2014, the 1,200 MW (6 x 200 MW) Punatsangchhu-I project between 7&amp;nbsp;km and 18.5&amp;nbsp;km downstream from [[Wangdue Phodrang]] Bridge is under construction. It is funded 40 percent by [[India]]n grant and 60 by loan. Construction began in November 2009 and its completion is expected by November 2018.

====Punatsangchhu-II Hydroelectric Project====
As of September 2014, the 1,020 MW (6 x 170 MW) Punatsangchhu-II project is under construction. It is funded 40 percent by [[India]]n grant and 60 by loan. Construction began in the year 2013 and its completion is expected by June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cea.nic.in/reports/proj_mon/status_he_execution.pdf|title=Status of Hydro Electric Projects in Bhutan (page 16)|accessdate=22 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715003433/http://www.cea.nic.in/reports/proj_mon/status_he_execution.pdf|archivedate=15 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhutan also operates several small hydroelectric projects, with output capacities ranging between 12 MW and 0.36 MW.&lt;ref name=BO-small/&gt;

In 2008, there were 24 even smaller mini-macro hydropower plants generating about 4 MW of energy altogether. The largest of these were in [[Trashigang District|Trashigang]] (Rangjung) and [[Bumthang District|Bumthang]] (Chhumey).&lt;ref name=LP/&gt;&lt;ref name=BO-small/&gt; Bhutan's first mini-hydroelectric facility was built in 1967 in [[Thimphu]]; it operated until 1988.&lt;ref name=LP/&gt; Until the 1970s, Bhutan constructed many other small hydroelectric plants. During the 1970s, Bhutan and [[India]] began to partner on larger projects aimed at electrifying larger regions of Bhutan and addressing transnational energy needs.&lt;ref name=B8-hydro/&gt;

===Alternative energy===
{{see also|Renewable energy in Bhutan}}

In the face of [[climate change]] and growing energy demands, Bhutan has sought additional energy security through developing its [[alternative energy]] sources.&lt;ref name=BO-beyond/&gt;

====Solar Energy====
[[Solar energy]] in Bhutan has received direct investment from domestic and international sources. In 2010, [[Asian Development Bank]] made a grant of over [[USD]]21 million for electrification of rural homes, aiming to provide power both on-grid and off-grid.&lt;ref name=BO-adb1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/adb-grants-21-6-m-for-rural-electrification/ |first=Pushkar |last=Chhetri |title=ADB Grants $21.6 M for Rural Electrification |date=2010-11-10 |publisher=[[Bhutan Observer]] online |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824061633/http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/adb-grants-21-6-m-for-rural-electrification/ |archivedate=2011-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BO-adb2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/adb-grant-for-lighting-homes/ |title=ADB Grant for Lighting Homes |date=2010-12-17 |publisher=[[Bhutan Observer]] online |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004201506/http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/adb-grant-for-lighting-homes/ |archivedate=2012-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bhutan Power Corporation provided solar electrification training for villagers from rural eastern areas of [[Bumthang District|Bumthang]], [[Lhuentse District|Lhuentse]], [[Mongar District|Mongar]], [[Pemagatshel District|Pemagatshel]], [[Samdrup Jongkhar District|Samdrup Jongkhar]], [[Sarpang District|Sarpang]], and [[Wangdue Phodrang District]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/21-villagers-trained-to-light-homes/ |title=21 Villagers Trained to Light Homes |date=2010-01-02 |first=Sonam |last=Pelden |publisher=[[Bhutan Observer]] online |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512095454/http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/21-villagers-trained-to-light-homes/ |archivedate=2012-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Solar powered lighting is also available to many nomads living within [[protected areas of Bhutan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/nomads-parks-coexistence-vital/ |title=Nomads-Parks Coexistence Vital |date=2010-01-19 |first=Sonam |last=Pelden |publisher=[[Bhutan Observer]] online |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005222201/http://www.bhutanobserver.bt/nomads-parks-coexistence-vital/ |archivedate=2012-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Biomass and Biogas====
In order to shift household dependence on firewood, Bhutan began re-exploring biogas development from [[cow dung]].&lt;ref name=BO-adb1/&gt; This included a five-year trial program in [[Chukha District|Chukha]], [[Samtse District|Samtse]], [[Sarpang District|Sarpang]], and [[Tsirang District]]s from 2011 to 2015. Bhutan had previously explored generating biogas in an identical fashion in the 1980s, but the program was abandoned after failures in training of masons and users, after-sales service, and site follow-up.&lt;ref name=BO-dung/&gt;

====Wind energy====
In 2010, pilot [[wind turbine]] programs were implemented to investigate the feasibility of using [[wind energy]] to alleviate hydropower drops during the dry winter seasons. It is only located at Wangdue Phodrang in western part of Bhutan.&lt;ref name=BO-adb1/&gt;&lt;ref name=BO-adb2/&gt;

==History==
{{further|Five-Year Plans of Bhutan}}

Since the late twentieth century, [[hydroelectric power]] has been a very important aspect of Bhutan's economic development as a low-cost energy source supporting more capital-intensive industries, such as [[forestry in Bhutan|forestry]], [[mining]], and [[cement]] and [[calcium carbide]] production. Bhutan's steep mountains, deep gorges, and fast-flowing rivers create abundant hydroelectric potential, which the government began to develop in the early 1960s with India's assistance.&lt;ref name=CS-energy&gt;{{country study|country=Bhutan |abbr=bt |editor=Savada, Andrea Matles |date=1991 |section=Energy |author=Worden, Robert L |pd=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Bhutan's Third [[Five-Year Plans of Bhutan|Five-Year Plan]], public works, still primarily [[transport in Bhutan|roads]], continued to take a significant share of the [[Bhutanese ngultrum|Nu]]475.2 million development budget (17.8 percent). Despite amounts budgeted for planned development, there were additional capital expenditures outside the formal development plan, including road construction and [[hydroelectric plant]]s.&lt;ref name=CS-govt/&gt;

The Sixth Five Year Plan (1987–92) was the first to allot power generation projects a significant portion of the national budget (13.1 percent). At [[Bhutanese ngultrum|Nu]]9.5 billion, the sixth plan was considerably more expensive than its predecessors. The goals included strengthening Bhutan's self-reliance, as it was hoped that Bhutan would begin exploiting markets in neighboring countries with manufacturing, mining, and hydroelectric projects. Faced with rising costs, Bhutan postponed some projects requiring large inputs of capital until the Seventh Development Plan (1992–96), which presented no major changes in overall sectoral development.&lt;ref name=CS-govt&gt;{{country study|country=Bhutan |abbr=bt |editor=Savada, Andrea Matles |date=1991 |section=Role of the Government |author=Worden, Robert L. |pd=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major expansion of hydroelectric facilities started in 1975 on the Wang Chhu between [[Thimphu]] and [[Phuntsholing]]. Known as the Chukha Hydel Project, it helped boost the nation's fledgling industrial development. The 336-megawatt Chukha Hydropower Station came on line in 1986 and was synchronized with the Indian grid that same year, and additional capacity became available in 1988. The [[Bhutanese ngultrum|Nu]]2.44 billion Chukha project was 60 percent paid for by India and budgeted outside the normal development plan process. It was planned that Bhutan would sell at low cost all excess power to [[West Bengal]]. At the same cost, Bhutan also hoped to reimport some of that power through the Indian power grid into southern districts. The Chukha project was important not only because it supplied electric power to western and southern districts but also because it provided a major source of income for the government. In 1981 Bhutan generated 22 million kilowatt-hours of energy from hydroelectric sources. The project's gross annual income was projected at [[Bhutanese ngultrum|Nu]]380 million in 1989. Another major plant in southwest Bhutan — the 18,000-kilowatt Jaldhaka hydroelectric plant — furnished electricity locally and exported the balance to India's West Bengal. In 1989 nearly 95 percent of Bhutan's government-installed power generation — a total of 355 megawatts — was supplied by Chukha, and a total of some 20 principal towns and 170 villages had been electrified. By 1990 Thimphu's commercial district had an underground cable system for its power supply.&lt;ref name=CS-energy/&gt;

By 1991, besides the Chukha project, government installations included seven minihydroelectric plants, each averaging 7,350 kilowatt capacity; twelve microhydroelectric plants, each averaging 340 kilowatts capacity; and eight [[diesel generator|diesel-powered generation stations]], each averaging 6,000 kilowatts capacity. Because domestic consumption was low (just over 16 megawatts, more than 80 percent of which was consumed by industry), ample power was exported to [[India]]. The project not only halved domestic electricity costs, but also generated revenues from electricity sold to India nearly equal to the total government revenue from all domestic sources. Smaller enterprises, such as the 1.5-megawatt Gyetsha Mini-Hydel, which was inaugurated in 1989, brought badly needed power to [[Bumthang District|Bumthang]]. Another major plant, a proposed 60-megawatt plant at Kurichu in eastern Bhutan, was included in the Sixth Development Plan (1987–92).&lt;ref name=CS-energy/&gt;

Other sources of energy included [[biogas]], used in some [[districts of Bhutan|districts]] for lighting and cooking and primarily generated from [[cow dung]]. [[Solar energy]] was used for a variety of purposes, including heating dwellings and greenhouses and lighting hospitals. Despite the potential solar energy that might be produced, Bhutan's mountainous terrain prevents maximum use. The same mountains are funnels for powerful winds, however, providing another viable renewable energy source. High-technology windmills were installed in [[Wangdue Phodrang District|Wangude Phodrang]] in 1987 to produce electricity to run irrigation pumps.&lt;ref name=CS-energy/&gt;

Still another source of fuel in the 1980s was [[firewood]]. Although Bhutanese had greater access to electric power than they had had previously, traditional methods of cooking and heating required readily available fuel. In the mid-1980s, Bhutan produced a [[coal]] equivalent of 982,000 tons of fuelwood per year to meet domestic needs. Coal itself was available in reserve in some 1.3 million tons, but recovery was difficult and the quality was poor.&lt;ref name=CS-energy/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16808">''Energy recycling'' is the [[energy recovery]] process of utilizing energy that would normally be wasted, usually by converting it into [[electricity]] or [[thermal energy]].  Undertaken at manufacturing facilities, power plants, and large institutions such as hospitals and universities, it significantly increases efficiency, thereby reducing energy costs and greenhouse gas pollution simultaneously.  The process is noted for its potential to mitigate global warming profitably.&lt;ref name="orionmagazine.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/articles/article/467/|title=The Unsung Solution: What rhymes with waste heat recovery?|work=[[Orion Magazine, November/December 2007]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This work is usually done in the form of [[combined heat and power]] (also called [[cogeneration]]) or [[waste heat recovery]].

== Forms of energy recycling ==
'''[[Waste heat]] recovery''' is a process that captures excess heat that would normally be discharged at manufacturing facilities and converts it into electricity and steam, or returns energy to the manufacturing process in the form of heated air, water, glycol, or oil.&lt;ref name="thecmmgroup.com"&gt;[http://www.thecmmgroup.com/energy-recovery-systems Energy Recovery Systems], The CMM Group.&lt;/ref&gt; A "waste heat recovery boiler" contains a series of water-filled tubes placed throughout the area where heat is released. When high-temperature heat meets the boiler, steam is produced, which in turn powers a turbine that creates electricity. This process is similar to that of other fired boilers, but in this case, waste heat replaces a traditional flame. No fossil fuels are used in this process. Metals, glass, pulp and paper, silicon and other production plants are typical locations where waste heat recovery can be effective.&lt;ref name="orionmagazine.org"/&gt;

'''Waste heat recovery from air conditioning''' is also used as an alternative to wasting heat to the atmosphere from chiller plants. Heat recovered in summer from chiller plants is stored in Thermalbanks&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icax.co.uk/thermalbank.html 'Thermalbanks']&lt;/ref&gt; in the ground and recycled back to the same building in winter via a heat pump to provide heating without burning fossil fuels. This elegant approach saves energy - and carbon - in both seasons by recycling summer heat for winter use.

'''[[Combined heat and power]] (CHP)''', also called [[cogeneration]], is, according to the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]], “an efficient, clean, and reliable approach to generating electricity and heat energy from a single fuel source. By installing a CHP system designed to meet the thermal and electrical base loads of a facility, CHP can greatly increase the facility's operational efficiency and decrease energy costs. At the same time, CHP reduces the emission of greenhouse gases, which contribute to global climate change.”   When electricity is produced on-site with a CHP plant, excess heat is recycled to produce both processed heat and additional power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/chp/|title=Combined Heat and Power Partnership|work=[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uschpa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uschpa.org/index.html|title=Clean Heat and Power Association|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701010700/http://www.uschpa.org/index.html|archivedate=2007-07-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Enabling technologies:'''  [[Heat pumps]] and [[thermal energy storage]] are classes of technologies that can enable the recycling of energy that would otherwise be inaccessible due to a temperature that is too low for utilization or a time lag between when the energy is available and when it is needed. While enhancing the temperature of available renewable thermal energy, heat pumps have the additional property of leveraging electrical power (or in some cases mechanical or thermal power) by using it to extract additional energy from a low quality source (such as seawater, lake water, the ground, the air, or waste heat from a process).

Thermal storage technologies allow heat or cold to be stored for periods of time ranging from hours or overnight to [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|interseasonal]], and can involve storage of [[Sensible heat|sensible energy]] (i.e. by changing the temperature of a medium) or [[latent energy]] (i.e. through phase changes of a medium, such between water and slush or ice). Short-term thermal storages can be used for peak-shaving in district heating or electrical distribution systems. Kinds of renewable or alternative energy sources that can be enabled include natural energy (e.g. collected via solar-thermal collectors, or dry cooling towers used to collect winter's cold), waste energy (e.g. from HVAC equipment, industrial processes or power plants), or surplus energy (e.g. as seasonally from hyropower projects or intermittently from wind farms). The [[Drake Landing Solar Community]] (Alberta, Canada) is illustrative. [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|borehole thermal energy storage]] allows the community to get 97% of its year-round heat from solar collectors on the garage roofs, which most of the heat collected in summer.&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Bill (June 28, 2011), [http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2011Annual_Conf/Proceedings/A24WONG-v03.pdf "Drake Landing Solar Community"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030520/http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2011Annual_Conf/Proceedings/A24WONG-v03.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}, IDEA/CDEA District Energy/CHP 2011 Conference, Toronto, pp. 1–30, retrieved 21 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wong B., Thornton J.

Some types of storage are capable of storing heat or cold [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|between opposing seasons]] (particularly if very large), and some storage applications require inclusion of a [[Heat pumps|heat pump]]. Latent heat is typically stored in ice tanks or what are called [[phase-change material]]s (PCMs).

=== Electric Turbo Compounding (ETC) ===
Electric Turbo Compounding (ETC) is a technology solution to the challenge of improving energy efficiency for the stationary power generation industry.

Fossil fuel based power generation is predicted to continue for decades, especially in developing economies. This is against the global need to reduce carbon emissions, of which, a high percentage is produced by the power sector worldwide.

ETC works by making gas and diesel-powered gensets (Electric Generators) work more effectively and cleaner, by recovering waste energy from the exhaust to improve power density and fuel efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

* There will be additional weight to add an ETC to a current unit.
* Process still uses fossil fuels, thus still has a carbon footprint in a renewable age.
* They are bespoke to each generator so the design, build and implementation can be a lengthy process.
* There are challenges with high speed turbo generators such as high stress in the rotors, heat generation of the electrical machine and rotordynamics of the turbo generator system.

== Current system ==
Both waste heat recovery and CHP constitute "decentralized" energy production, which is in contrast to traditional "centralized" power generated at large power plants run by regional utilities.&lt;ref name="uschpa.org"/&gt;  The “centralized” system has an average efficiency of 34 percent, requiring about three units of fuel to produce one unit of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/fuelelectric.html|title=Electricity|publisher=[[U.S. Department of Energy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By capturing both heat and power, CHP and waste heat recovery projects have higher efficiencies.

A 2007 Department of Energy study found the potential for 135,000 megawatts of CHP in the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Hedman, Energy and Environmental Analysis/USCHPA, "Combined Heat and Power and Heat Recovery as Energy Efficiency Options", Briefing to Senate Renewable Energy Caucus, September 10, 2007, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; and a Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory study identified about 64,000 megawatts that could be obtained from industrial waste energy, not counting CHP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/843010-3bxGVs/native/843010.pdf|title=Clean Energy Technologies: a Preliminary Inventory of the Potential for Electricity Generation, Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory, 4/05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These studies suggest about 200,000 megawatts—or 20% -- of total power capacity that could come from energy recycling in the U.S.  Widespread use of energy recycling could therefore reduce global warming emissions by an estimated 20 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epa/epat2p2.html|title=The Energy Information Administration, Existing Capacity by Energy Source, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, as of 2005, about 42 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution came from the production of electricity and 27 percent from the production of heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/usinventoryreport.html |title=Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks |work=[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218171807/http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/usinventoryreport.html |archivedate=2011-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/ggrpt/emission.html|title=Emissions of Greenhouse Gases in the United States 2005|work=[[U.S. Energy Information Administration]],}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates contend that recycled energy costs less and has lower emissions than most other energy options in current use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recycled-energy.com/main/what_it_does.html|title=Recycled Energy Development, "What RED Does"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently RecyclingEnergy Int. Corp. takes advantage of recycling energy in [[heat recovery ventilation]] and latent heat pump and CHCP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recyclingenergy.com RecyclingEnergy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Perhaps the first modern use of energy recycling was done by [[Thomas Edison]].  His 1882 Pearl Street Station, the world’s first commercial power plant, was a CHP plant, producing both electricity and thermal energy while using waste heat to warm neighboring buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cogeneration.net/ThomasEdisonsCogenPlant.htm|title=World’s First Commercial Power Plant Was a Cogeneration Plant|work=[[Cogeneration Technologies]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recycling allowed Edison’s plant to achieve approximately 50 percent efficiency.

By the early 1900s, regulations emerged to promote rural electrification through the construction of centralized plants managed by regional utilities.  These regulations not only promoted electrification throughout the countryside, but they also discouraged decentralized power generation, such as CHP.  They even went so far as to make it illegal for non-utilities to sell power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.senate.gov/~finance/hearings/testimony/2007test/052407testsc.pdf
|title=Testimony of Sean Casten before Senate subcommittee on Energy, Natural Resources, and Infrastructure, 5/27/07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1978, Congress recognized that efficiency at central power plants had stagnated and sought to encourage improved efficiency with the [[Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act]] (PURPA), which encouraged utilities to buy power from other energy producers. CHP plants proliferated, soon producing about 8 percent of all energy in the U.S.&lt;ref name="localpower.org|title=World"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.localpower.org|title=World Survey of Decentralized Energy, 5/06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the bill left implementation and enforcement up to individual states, resulting in little or nothing being done in many parts of the country.

In 2008 [[Tom Casten]], chairman of [[Recycled Energy Development]], said that "''We think we could make about 19 to 20 percent of U.S. electricity with heat that is currently thrown away by industry.''"&lt;ref name=npr2008may22/&gt;

Outside the U.S., energy recycling is more common. Denmark is probably the most active energy recycler, obtaining about 55% of its energy from CHP and waste heat recovery. Other large countries, including Germany, Russia, and India, also obtain a much higher share of their energy from decentralized sources.&lt;ref name="localpower.org|title=World"/&gt;&lt;ref name=npr2008may22&gt;

'''Forensic palynology''' is the study of [[pollen]], spores and other acid-resistant microscopic plant bodies, including dinoflagellates, to prove or disprove a relationship between objects, people and places that pertain to both criminal and civil cases. 

Pollen can tell a lot about where a person or object has been, because regions of the world, countries, and even different parts of a garden will have a distinctive pollen assemblage.&lt;ref name="bryant"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Forensic Palynology: A New Way to Catch Crooks | author = Vaughn M.

For instance, a dead body may be found in a wood, and the clothes may contain pollen that was released after death (the time of death can be determined by [[forensic entomology]]), but in a place other than where it was found. That indicates that the body was moved.

==Palynology==
[[Palynology]] is the study of pollen, spores and other microscopic plant bodies such as dinoflagellates (marine algal cysts). Pollen carries the male [[gametes]] (sex cells) of flowering plants and plants that produce cones (e.g. pine trees).  Spores are asexual reproductive bodies of ferns, mosses and fungi.

Palynology is used by geologists to help date rocks for petroleum, mining and water exploration and to help unravel the history of plants on Earth; by geographers to investigate climatic and environmental change: by botanists for plant taxonomy and phylogeny; by immunologist to investigate allergenic pollen; by archaeologists to study the customs, rituals and agricultural practices of ancient peoples; by zoologists and environmental scientists to understand foraging habits of insects, birds and mammals and to investigate past native vegetation and habitats in order to preserve the present and protect endangered species.

'''Henk de Velde''' (born 12 January 1949 in [[IJsselmuiden]]) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[seafarer]]. He is especially known for his long solo-voyages around the world.

Initially he worked for thirteen years in the [[merchant navy]], from [[Able Seaman (occupation)|able-bodied seaman]] to [[Captain (nautical)|captain]]. When he was 28 he chose definitively for ocean-sailing. In 1978, he started with its first voyage around the world, which would eventually take seven years. He made this voyage with his former wife until they separated in 1984. Their son Stefan Vairoa was born on [[Easter Island]] in 1981.

In 1985, he returned to the Netherlands. In 1989, he left again for a nonstop circumnavigation with a 60-foot (18 meter) catamaran, called Alisun J&amp;B, and it took him 158 days. He had to stop in [[New Zealand]] for repairs. His third voyage, in 1992, with a 60&amp;nbsp;ft (18 meter) catamaran called Zeeman, was viewed on Dutch TV in the so-called ''5 O'clock Show''. He was for forty days a missing person because of electric problems and three days before arrival he had a collision with a floating container which left him unconscious. He was eventually rescued by a Russian freighter. With a double skull fracture he was hospitalized on the island of [[Madeira]] before returning to the Netherlands. In 1996, he departed with a 71-foot catamaran, called C1000 and sailed in 119 days non stop around the world. Officially he did not break the record because he did not sail under the rules of the WSSRC. He is still{{When|date=December 2014}} the only person in the world who sailed a catamaran nonstop single handed around the world.

In 2001 de Velde started again, with a steel monohull yacht called Campina, this time using a totally new route, instead of west to east or east to west he wanted to sail the world north to south by passing the NE passage north of Siberia. It took him three and a half years. He had to winter near the village of [[Tiksi]] in Northern Siberia. Temperatures were between -35 and -60&amp;nbsp;°C. He stayed on board in the white desert of the [[Arctic Ocean]]. In 2004, he got the aid of a Russian nuclear icebreaker ''[[Vaygach (1989 icebreaker)|Vaigach]]''. The rudders were demolished by heavy ice. In December 2004 he returned with his damaged vessel to the Netherlands. Henk de Velde has written seven books, all in Dutch. In all his writings he contemplates on the concept of freedom. He is a philosopher, as well as a sailor, some even calling him a mystic. He directed two documentaries: ''Sea of Heartbreak'' (1997) and ''1000 days of Loneliness'' (2005). He works in close association with the Dutch media.

He departed on his 6th circumnavigation in September 2007 with the trimaran ''Juniper'', without planning to return to the Netherlands. He called this "Never Ending Voyage" a pilgrim's route to the edges of this world. The 52&amp;nbsp;ft trimaran was designed by [[Chris White (multihull designer)|Chris White]]. However, in March 2011, while sailing near [[Vancouver Island]] in Canada, he suffered an accident with the vessel, in which the propeller shaft broke from its axis, elbowing up and damaging the aft, a fibreglass predicament. Weeks of repairs ensued, and Henk de Velde counted on many helpful volunteer hands to have the problem fixed up. Perhaps resigning to the fact that the Juniper's speed was deemed never to match the Campina's resilience and livelihood, he then reported that his plans had changed, and that he would eventually return to the Netherlands, noting in an interview soon after, that the time had come "to slow down", and that he was homesick.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smalltridesign.com/Trimaran-Articles/Velde-interview.html An Interview with Henk de Velde].

'''Hursag''' ({{cuneiform|𒉺𒂅}} {{transl|sux|ḪUR.SAĜ}}) is a [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] term variously translated as meaning "mountain", "hill", "foothills" or "piedmont".&lt;ref name="JacobsenAbusch2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thorkild Jacobsen|author2=I. Tzvi Abusch|title=Riches hidden in secret places: ancient Near Eastern studies in memory of Thorkild Jacobsen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S4s5MveufJgC&amp;pg=PA45|accessdate=24 May 2011|year=2002|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=978-1-57506-061-3|pages=45–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thorkild Jacobsen]] extrapolated the translation in his later career to mean literally, "head of the valleys".&lt;ref&gt;Biggs, Robert D., Studies presented to Robert D. Biggs, June 4, 2004, , Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, p.223, 30 Jan 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Mountains play a certain role in [[Mesopotamian mythology]] and [[Assyro-Babylonian religion]], associated with deities such as [[Anu]], [[Enlil]], [[Enki]] and [[Ninhursag]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Some scholars also identify hursag with an undefined mountain range or strip of raised land outside the plain of [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref name="Clifford1972"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard J. Clifford|title=The cosmic mountain in Canaan and the Old Testament|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Q3XAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=29 May 2011|year=1972|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MindlinGeller1987"&gt;{{cite book|author1=M. Mindlin|author2=Markham J. Geller|author3=John E. Wansbrough|title=Figurative language in the ancient Near East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JPpT4xvMq2sC&amp;pg=PA15|accessdate=29 May 2011|year=1987|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7286-0141-3|pages=15–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a myth variously entitled by [[Samuel Noah Kramer]] as “The Deeds and Exploits of Ninurta” and later [[Ninurta Myth Lugal-e]] by Thorkild Jacobsen, Hursag is described as a mound of stones constructed by [[Ninurta]] after his defeat of a demon called [[Asag]]. Ninurta’s mother [[Ninlil]] visits the location after this great victory. In return for her love and loyalty, Ninurta gives Ninlil the hursag as a gift. Her name is consequentially changed from Ninlil to Ninhursag or the “mistress of the Hursag”.&lt;ref name="Kramer1979"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Noah Kramer|title=From the Poetry of Sumer: Creation, Glorification, Adoration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tZSdbj5Hny0C&amp;pg=PA39|date=January 1979|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-03703-8|pages=38, 39–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harps"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Harps that Once--: Sumerian Poetry in Translation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L-BI0h41yCEC|date=1 September 1997|pages=234–235, 254–255|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-07278-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hursag is described here in a clear cultural myth as a high wall, [[levee]], dam or floodbank, used to restrain the excess mountain waters and floods caused by the melting snow and spring rain.

'''Hysteresis''' is the dependence of the state of a system on its history. For example, a [[magnet]] may have more than one possible [[magnetic moment]] in a given [[magnetic field]], depending on how the field changed in the past. Plots of a single component of the moment often form a loop or hysteresis curve, where there are different values of one variable depending on the direction of change of another variable. This history dependence is the basis of memory in a [[hard disk drive]] and the [[remanence]] that retains a record of the [[Earth's magnetic field]] magnitude in the past. Hysteresis occurs in [[ferromagnetic]] and [[ferroelectricity|ferroelectric]] materials, as well as in the [[deformation (mechanics)|deformation]] of [[rubber band]]s and [[shape-memory alloy]]s and many other natural phenomena. In natural systems it is often associated with [[irreversible process|irreversible thermodynamic change]] such as [[phase transitions]] and with [[internal friction]]; and [[dissipation]] is a common side effect.

Hysteresis can be found in [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[engineering]], [[biology]], and [[economics]]. It is incorporated in many artificial systems: for example, in [[thermostat]]s and [[Schmitt trigger]]s, it prevents unwanted frequent switching.

Hysteresis can be a dynamic [[lag]] between an input and an output that disappears if the input is varied more slowly; this is known as ''rate-dependent'' hysteresis. However, phenomena such as the magnetic hysteresis loops are mainly ''rate-independent'', which makes a durable memory possible.

Systems with hysteresis are [[Nonlinear system|nonlinear]], and can be mathematically challenging to model. Some models such as the [[Preisach model of hysteresis|Preisach model]] (originally applied to ferromagnetism) and the  [[Bouc–Wen model of hysteresis|Bouc–Wen model]] attempt to capture general features of hysteresis; and there are also phenomenological models for particular phenomena such as the [[Jiles–Atherton model]] for ferromagnetism.

==Etymology and history==

The term "hysteresis" is derived from {{lang|grc|ὑστέρησις}}, an [[Ancient Greek]] word meaning "deficiency" or "lagging behind". It was coined around 1890 by [[James Alfred Ewing|Sir James Alfred Ewing]] to describe the behaviour of magnetic materials.

Some early work on describing hysteresis in mechanical systems was performed by [[James Clerk Maxwell]]. Subsequently, hysteretic models have received significant attention in the works of [[Ferenc Preisach]] ([[Preisach model of hysteresis]]), [[Louis Néel]] and D. H. Everett in connection with magnetism and absorption. A more formal mathematical theory of systems with hysteresis was developed in the 1970s by a group of Russian mathematicians led by [[Mark Krasnosel'skii]].&lt;ref name="Mayergoyz2003"&gt;{{cite book|first=Isaak D.|last= Mayergoyz|title= Mathematical Models of Hysteresis and their Applications: Second Edition (Electromagnetism)|authorlink=Isaak D. Mayergoyz|publisher= [[Academic Press]]|year= 2003 |isbn=978-0-12-480873-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Rate-dependent===

One type of hysteresis is a simple [[lag]] between input and output. A simple example is a [[sine wave|sinusoidal]] input {{math|&lt;var&gt;X(t)&lt;/var&gt;}} that results in a sinusoidal output {{math|&lt;var&gt;Y(t)&lt;/var&gt;}}, but with a phase lag {{math|&lt;var&gt;&amp;phi;&lt;/var&gt;}}:
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
X(t) &amp;= X_0 \sin \omega t \\ Y(t) &amp;= Y_0 \sin\left(\omega t-\phi\right).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Such behavior can occur in linear systems, and a more general form of response is
:&lt;math&gt; Y(t) = \chi_\text{i} X(t) + \int_0^{\infty} \Phi_\text{d} (\tau) X(t-\tau) \, \mathrm{d}\tau, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\chi_\text{i}&lt;/math&gt; is the instantaneous response and &lt;math&gt;\Phi_d(\tau)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[impulse response]] to an impulse that occurred &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; time units in the past.  In the [[frequency domain]], input and output are related by a complex ''generalized susceptibility'' that can be computed from &lt;math&gt;\Phi_d&lt;/math&gt;; it is mathematically equivalent to a [[transfer function]] in linear filter theory and analogue signal processing.&lt;ref name=Bertotti1998ch2&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bertotti |first1=Giorgio |title=Hysteresis in magnetism: For physicists, materials scientists, and engineers |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-12-093270-2 |chapter=Ch. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This kind of hysteresis is often referred to as ''rate-dependent hysteresis''. If the input is reduced to zero, the output continues to respond for a finite time. This constitutes a memory of the past, but a limited one because it disappears as the output decays to zero. The phase lag depends on the frequency of the input, and goes to zero as the frequency decreases.&lt;ref name="Bertotti1998ch2" /&gt;

When rate-dependent hysteresis is due to [[dissipative]] effects like [[friction]], it is associated with [[power loss]].&lt;ref name="Bertotti1998ch2" /&gt;

===Rate-independent===

Systems with ''rate-independent hysteresis'' have a ''persistent'' memory of the past that remains after the transients have died out.&lt;ref name=rate&gt;The term is attributed to {{harvnb|Truesdell|Noll|1965}} by {{harvnb|Visintin|1994|loc=page 13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The future development of such a system depends on the history of states visited, but does not fade as the events recede into the past. If an input variable {{math|&lt;var&gt;X(t)&lt;/var&gt;}} cycles from  {{math|&lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}  to {{math|&lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and back again, the output {{math|&lt;var&gt;Y(t)&lt;/var&gt;}}  may be  {{math|&lt;var&gt;Y&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} initially but a different value  {{math|&lt;var&gt;Y&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} upon return. The values of  {{math|&lt;var&gt;Y(t)&lt;/var&gt;}} depend on the path of values that  {{math|&lt;var&gt;X(t)&lt;/var&gt;}} passes through but not on the speed at which it traverses the path.&lt;ref name="Bertotti1998ch2"/&gt; Many authors restrict the term hysteresis to mean only rate-independent hysteresis.&lt;ref name=Visintin1994p13&gt;{{harvnb|Visintin|1994|loc=page 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hysteresis effects can be characterized using the [[Preisach model]] and the generalized [[Prandtl-Ishlinskii model]].&lt;ref&gt;Mohammad Al Janaideh, Subhash Rakheja, Chun-Yi Su [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5510155&amp;tag=1 An analytical generalized Prandtl–Ishlinskii model inversion for hysteresis compensation in micropositioning control], IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics,  Volume:16 Issue:4, PP 734 - 744, 15 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==In engineering==

===Control systems===

In control systems, hysteresis can be used to filter signals  so that the output reacts less rapidly than it otherwise would, by taking recent history into account. For example, a [[thermostat]] controlling a heater may switch the heater on when the temperature drops below A, but not turn it off until the temperature rises above B. (For instance, if one wishes to maintain a temperature of 20&amp;nbsp;°C then one might set the thermostat to turn the heater on when the temperature drops to below 18&amp;nbsp;°C and off when the temperature exceeds 22&amp;nbsp;°C).

Similarly, a pressure switch can be designed to exhibit hysteresis, with pressure set-points substituted for temperature thresholds.

===Electronic circuits===

[[Image:Hysteresis sharp curve.svg|thumb|Sharp hysteresis loop of a [[Schmitt trigger]]]]
Often, some amount of hysteresis is intentionally added to an electronic circuit to prevent unwanted rapid switching. This and similar techniques are used to compensate for [[Switch#Contact bounce|contact bounce]] in switches, or [[Noise (electronic)|noise]] in an electrical signal.

A [[Schmitt trigger]] is a simple electronic circuit that exhibits this property.

A [[Relay#Latching relay|latching relay]] uses a [[solenoid]] to actuate a ratcheting mechanism that keeps the relay closed even if power to the relay is terminated.

Hysteresis is essential to the workings of some [[memristor]]s (circuit components which "remember" changes in the current passing through them by changing their resistance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=207403521&amp;pgno=1 |title='Missing link' memristor created: Rewrite the textbooks? |last1=Johnson |first1=R. Colin |newspaper=EE Times April 30, 2008 |accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hysteresis can be used when connecting arrays of elements such as [[nanoelectronic]]s, [[electrochrome cells]] and [[memory effect]] devices using [[passive matrix addressing]]. Shortcuts are made between adjacent components (see [[crosstalk]]) and the hysteresis helps to keep the components in a particular state while the other components change states. Thus, all rows can be addressed at the same time instead of individually.

In the field of audio electronics, a [[noise gate]] often implements hysteresis intentionally to prevent the gate from "chattering" when signals close to its threshold are applied.

===User interface design===

A hysteresis is sometimes intentionally added to computer algorithms. The field of [[user interface design]] has borrowed the term hysteresis to refer to times when the state of the user interface intentionally lags behind the apparent user input. For example, a menu that was drawn in response to a mouse-over event may remain on-screen for a brief moment after the mouse has moved out of the trigger region and the menu region. This allows the user to move the mouse directly to an item on the menu, even if part of that direct mouse path is outside of both the trigger region and the menu region. For instance, right-clicking on the desktop in most Windows interfaces will create a menu that exhibits this behavior.

===Aerodynamics===

In aerodynamics, hysteresis can be observed when decreasing the angle of attack of a wing after stall, regarding the lift and drag coefficients. The angle of attack where the flow on top of the wing reattaches is generally lower than the angle of attack where the flow separates during the increase of the angle of attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.public.iastate.edu/~huhui/paper/2008/AIAA-2008-0315.pdf |format=pdf |title=An Experimental Investigation on Aerodynamic Hysteresis of a Low-Reynolds Number Airfoil |author=Zifeng Yang |authorlink= |author2=Hirofumi Igarashi |author3=Mathew Martin |author4=Hui Hu |date=Jan 7–10, 2008 |publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics |conference=46th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit  |pages= |location=Reno, Nevada |id=AIAA-2008-0315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In mechanics==

===Elastic hysteresis===
[[Image:Elastic Hysteresis.svg|thumb|right|Elastic hysteresis of an idealized rubber band. The area in the centre of the hysteresis loop is the energy dissipated due to internal friction.]]
In the elastic hysteresis of rubber, the area in the centre of a hysteresis loop is the energy dissipated due to material [[internal friction]].

Elastic hysteresis was one of the first types of hysteresis to be examined.&lt;ref name="LoveTreatise"&gt;{{cite book |author=Love, Augustus E. |title=Treatise on the Mathematical Theory of Elasticity (Dover Books on Physics &amp; Chemistry) |publisher=Dover Publications |location=New York |year=1927 |isbn=978-0-486-60174-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ewing"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=J. A. |last1= Ewing |authorlink1=James Alfred Ewing |title=On hysteresis in the relation of strain to stress |journal=British Association Reports |year=1889 |pages=502|url=https://archive.org/details/reportofbritisha90brit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect can be demonstrated  using a rubber band with weights attached to it. If the top of a rubber band is hung on a hook and small weights are attached to the bottom of the band one at a time, it will get longer. As more weights are ''loaded'' onto it, the band will continue to extend because the force the weights are exerting on the band is increasing. When each weight is taken off, or ''unloaded'', the band will get shorter as the force is reduced. As the weights are taken off, each weight that produced a specific length as it was loaded onto the band now produces a slightly longer length as it is unloaded. This is because the band does not obey [[Hooke's law]] perfectly. The hysteresis loop of an idealized rubber band is shown in the figure.

In terms of force, the rubber band was harder to stretch when it was being loaded than when it was being unloaded. In terms of time, when the band is unloaded, the effect (the length) lagged behind the cause (the force of the weights) because the length has not yet reached the value it had for the same weight during the loading part of the cycle. In terms of energy, more energy was required during the loading than the unloading, the excess energy being dissipated as heat.

Elastic hysteresis is more pronounced when the loading and unloading is done quickly than when it is done slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=B. |last1=Hopkinson |first2=G. T. |last2=Williams |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society]] |volume= 87 |year=1912 |pages=502 |doi=10.1098/rspa.1912.0104|title=The Elastic Hysteresis of Steel |bibcode = 1912RSPSA..87..502H|issue=598 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some materials such as hard metals don't show elastic hysteresis under a moderate load, whereas other hard materials like granite and marble do. Materials such as rubber exhibit a high degree of elastic hysteresis.

When the intrinsic hysteresis of rubber is being measured, the material can be considered to behave like a gas. When a rubber band is stretched it heats up, and if it is suddenly released, it cools down perceptibly. These effects correspond to a large hysteresis from the thermal exchange with the environment and a smaller hysteresis due to internal friction within the rubber. This proper, intrinsic hysteresis can be measured only if the rubber band is adiabatically isolated.

Small vehicle suspensions using [[rubber]] (or other [[elastomer]]s) can achieve the dual function of springing and damping because rubber, unlike metal springs, has pronounced hysteresis and does not return all the absorbed compression energy on the rebound. [[Mountain bike]]s have made use of elastomer suspension, as did the original [[Mini]] car.

The primary cause of [[rolling resistance]] when a body (such as a ball, tire, or wheel) rolls on a surface is hysteresis. This is attributed to the [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic characteristics]] of the material of the rolling body.

===Contact angle hysteresis===
The [[contact angle]] formed between a liquid and solid phase will exhibit a range of contact angles that are possible. There are two common methods for measuring this range of contact angles. The first method is referred to as the tilting base method. Once a drop is dispensed on the surface with the surface level, the surface is then tilted from 0° to 90°. As the drop is tilted, the downhill side will be in a state of imminent wetting while the uphill side will be in a state of imminent dewetting. As the tilt increases the downhill contact angle will increase and represents the advancing contact angle while the uphill side will decrease; this is the receding contact angle. The values for these angles just prior to the drop releasing will typically represent the advancing and receding contact angles. The difference between these two angles is the contact angle hysteresis.

The second method is often referred to as the add/remove volume method. When the maximum liquid volume is removed from the drop without the [[interfacial area]] decreasing the receding contact angle is thus measured. When volume is added to the maximum before the interfacial area increases, this is the [[advancing contact angle]]. As with the tilt method, the difference between the advancing and receding contact angles is the contact angle hysteresis. Most researchers prefer the tilt method; the add/remove method requires that a tip or needle stay embedded in the drop which can affect the accuracy of the values, especially the receding contact angle.

=== Bubble shape hysteresis ===
The equilibrium shapes of [[Bubble (physics)|bubbles]] expanding and contracting on capillaries ([[Hypodermic needle#Non-specialist use|blunt needles]]) can exhibit hysteresis depending on the relative magnitude of the [[Maximum bubble pressure method#Maximum bubble pressure method|maximum capillary pressure]] to ambient pressure, and the relative magnitude of the bubble volume at the maximum capillary pressure to the dead volume in the system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chandran Suja|first=V.|last2=Frostad|first2=J. M.|last3=Fuller|first3=G. G.|date=2016-10-31|title=Impact of Compressibility on the Control of Bubble-Pressure Tensiometers|journal=Langmuir|doi=10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b03258|pmid=27798833|issn=0743-7463|volume=32|issue=46|pages=12031–12038}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The bubble shape hysteresis is a consequence of gas [[compressibility]], which causes the bubbles to behave differently across expansion and contraction. During expansion, bubbles undergo large non equilibrium jumps in volume, while during contraction the bubbles are more stable and undergo a relatively smaller jump in volume resulting in an asymmetry across expansion and contraction. The bubble shape hysteresis is qualitatively similar to the adsorption hysteresis, and as in the contact angle hysteresis, the interfacial properties play an important role in bubble shape hysteresis.

The existence of the bubble shape hysteresis has important consequences in [[Surface rheology|interfacial rheology]] experiments involving bubbles. As a result of the hysteresis, not all sizes of the bubbles can be formed on a capillary. Further the gas compressibility causing  the hysteresis leads to unintended complications in the phase relation between the applied changes in interfacial area to the expected interfacial stresses. These difficulties can be avoided by designing experimental systems to avoid the bubble shape hysteresis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alvarez|first=Nicolas J.|last2=Walker|first2=Lynn M.|last3=Anna|first3=Shelley L.|date=2010-08-17|title=A Microtensiometer To Probe the Effect of Radius of Curvature on Surfactant Transport to a Spherical Interface|journal=Langmuir|volume=26|issue=16|pages=13310–13319|doi=10.1021/la101870m|pmid=20695573|issn=0743-7463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adsorption hysteresis===
Hysteresis can also occur during physical [[adsorption]] processes. In this type of hysteresis, the quantity adsorbed is different when gas is being added than it is when being removed. The specific causes of adsorption hysteresis are still an active area of research, but it is linked to differences in the nucleation and evaporation mechanisms inside mesopores. These mechanisms are further complicated by effects such as [[cavitation]] and pore blocking.

In physical adsorption, hysteresis is evidence of [[mesoporosity]]-indeed, the definition of mesopores (2–50&amp;nbsp;nm) is associated with the appearance (50&amp;nbsp;nm) and disappearance (2&amp;nbsp;nm) of mesoporosity in nitrogen adsorption isotherms as a function of Kelvin radius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gregg |first1=S. J. |last2=Sing |first2=Kenneth S. W. |title=Adsorption, Surface Area, and Porosity|edition=Second|location=London|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|year=1982 |isbn=978-0-12-300956-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; An adsorption isotherm showing hysteresis is said to be of Type IV (for a wetting adsorbate) or Type V (for a non-wetting adsorbate), and hysteresis loops themselves are classified according to how symmetric the loop is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=K. S. W. |last1=Sing |first2=D. H.  |last2=Everett |first3=R. A. W. |last3=Haul |first4=L. |last4=Moscou |first5=R. A. |last5=Pierotti |first6=J. |last6=J.

The resulting scans are called "crossing," "converging," or "returning," depending on the shape of the isotherm at this point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=G. A. |last1=Tompsett  |first2=L. |last2=Krogh |first3=D. W. |last3=Griffin |first4=W. C. |last4=Conner |journal=[[Langmuir (journal)|Langmuir]] |volume=21|issue=8|pages=8214&amp;ndash;8225|year=2005|pmid=16114924|doi=10.1021/la050068y|title=Hysteresis and Scanning Behavior of Mesoporous Molecular Sieves}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Matric potential hysteresis===
The relationship between matric [[water potential]] and [[water content]] is the basis of the [[water retention curve]]. [[Matric potential]] measurements (Ψ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) are converted to volumetric water content (θ) measurements based on a site or soil specific calibration curve. Hysteresis is a source of water content measurement error. Matric potential hysteresis arises from differences in wetting behaviour causing dry medium to re-wet; that is, it depends on the saturation history of the porous medium. Hysteretic behaviour means that, for example, at a matric potential (Ψ&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) of {{nowrap|5 kPa}}, the volumetric water content (θ) of a fine sandy soil matrix could be anything between 8% to 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |url=http://www.sowacs.com/archives/99-04/msg00000.html |title=Subject: Accuracy of capacitance soil moisture ... |date=8 April 1999 |accessdate=28 September 2011 |mailinglist=SOWACS |last1=Parkes |first1=Martin |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928150928/http://www.sowacs.com/archives/99-04/msg00000.html |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tensiometer (soil science)|Tensiometer]]s are directly influenced by this type of hysteresis. Two other types of sensors used to measure soil water matric potential are also influenced by hysteresis effects within the sensor itself. Resistance blocks, both nylon and gypsum based, measure matric potential as a function of electrical resistance. The relation between the sensor’s electrical resistance and sensor matric potential is hysteretic. Thermocouples measure matric potential as a function of heat dissipation. Hysteresis occurs because measured heat dissipation depends on sensor water content, and the sensor water content–matric potential relationship is hysteretic. {{As of|2002}}, only desorption curves are usually measured during calibration of [[soil moisture sensors]]. Despite the fact that it can be a source of significant error, the sensor specific effect of hysteresis is generally ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Magnetic hysteresis===
{{main article|Magnetic hysteresis}}
&lt;!--NOTE TO EDITORS: This section is linked to from [[Kilogram]] and [[Magnetic field]]. Please do not rename without changing the referring link.--&gt;
[[Image:StonerWohlfarthMainLoop.svg|thumb|right|400px|[[Stoner–Wohlfarth model|Theoretical model]] of [[magnetization]] {{math|&lt;var&gt;m&lt;/var&gt;}} against [[magnetic field]]  {{math|&lt;var&gt;h&lt;/var&gt;}}. Starting at the origin, the upward curve is the ''initial magnetization curve''. The downward curve after saturation, along with the lower return curve, form the ''main loop''. The intercepts {{math|&lt;var&gt;h&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;m&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;rs&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the ''[[coercivity]]'' and ''[[remanence#Saturation remanence|saturation remanence]]''. ]]

When an external [[magnetic field]] is applied to a [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic material]] such as [[iron]], the atomic [[Magnetic domain|domain]]s align themselves with it. Even when the field is removed, part of the alignment will be retained: the material has become ''magnetized''. Once magnetized, the magnet will stay magnetized indefinitely. To [[Magnet#Demagnetizing ferromagnets|demagnetize]] it requires heat or a magnetic field in the opposite direction. This is the effect that provides the element of memory in a [[hard disk drive]].

The relationship between field strength {{math|&lt;var&gt;H&lt;/var&gt;}} and magnetization {{math|&lt;var&gt;M&lt;/var&gt;}}  is not linear in such materials. If a magnet is demagnetized ({{math|&lt;var&gt;H{{=}}M{{=}}0&lt;/var&gt;}}) and the relationship between {{math|&lt;var&gt;H&lt;/var&gt;}} and  {{math|&lt;var&gt;M&lt;/var&gt;}}  is plotted for increasing levels of field strength,  {{math|&lt;var&gt;M&lt;/var&gt;}} follows the ''initial magnetization curve''. This curve increases rapidly at first and then approaches an [[asymptote]] called [[Saturation (magnetic)|magnetic saturation]]. If the magnetic field is now reduced monotonically, {{math|&lt;var&gt;M&lt;/var&gt;}} follows a different curve.  At zero field strength, the magnetization is offset from the origin by an amount called the [[remanence]]. If the {{math|&lt;var&gt;H-M&lt;/var&gt;}} relationship is plotted for all strengths of applied magnetic field the result is a hysteresis loop called the ''main loop''. The width of the middle section is twice the [[coercivity]] of the material.&lt;ref name=Chikazumi1997ch1&gt;{{harvnb|Chikazumi|1997|loc=Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A closer look at a magnetization curve generally reveals a series of small, random jumps in magnetization called [[Barkhausen effect|Barkhausen jumps]]. This effect is due to [[crystallographic defect]]s such as [[dislocation]]s.&lt;ref name=Chikazumi1997ch15&gt;{{harvnb|Chikazumi|1997|loc=Chapter 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnetic hysteresis loops are not exclusive to materials with ferromagnetic ordering. Other magnetic orderings, such as [[spin glass]] ordering, also exhibit this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Monod |first1=P. |last2=PréJean |first2=J. J. |last3=Tissier |first3=B. |year=1979 |title=Magnetic hysteresis of CuMn in the spin glass state |journal=J. Appl. Phys. |volume=50 |issue=B11|pages=7324 |doi=10.1063/1.326943 |bibcode = 1979JAP....50.7324M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Physical origin====
{{Main article|Ferromagnetism}}
The phenomenon of hysteresis in [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] materials is the result of two effects: rotation of [[magnetization]] and changes in size or number of [[magnetic domain]]s. In general, the magnetization varies (in direction but not magnitude) across a magnet, but in sufficiently small magnets, it does not. In these [[Single domain (magnetic)|single-domain]] magnets, the magnetization responds to a magnetic field by rotating. Single-domain magnets are used wherever a strong, stable magnetization is needed (for example, [[magnetic recording]]).

Larger magnets are divided into regions called ''domains''. Across each domain, the magnetization does not vary; but between domains are relatively thin ''domain walls'' in which the direction of magnetization rotates from the direction of one domain to another. If the magnetic field changes, the walls move, changing the relative sizes of the domains. Because the domains are not magnetized in the same direction, the [[magnetic moment]] per unit volume is smaller than it would be in a single-domain magnet; but domain walls involve rotation of only a small part of the magnetization, so it is much easier to change the magnetic moment. The magnetization can also change by addition or subtraction of domains (called ''nucleation'' and ''denucleation'').

====Magnetic hysteresis models====
The most known empirical models in hysteresis are [[Preisach model of hysteresis|Preisach]] and [[Jiles-Atherton model]]s. These models allow an accurate modeling of the hysteresis loop and are widely used in the industry. However, these models lose the connection with thermodynamics and the energy consistency is not ensured. Last models rely on a consistent thermodynamic formulation. VINCH model&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Francois-Lavet et al (2011-11-14). [http://vincent.francois-l.be/VINCH_model.pdf Vectorial Incremental Nonconservative Consistent Hysteresis model].&lt;/ref&gt; is inspired by the [[Work hardening|kinematic hardening]] laws and by the [[thermodynamics]] of [[irreversible process]]es. In particular, in addition to provide an accurate modeling, the stored magnetic energy and the dissipated energy are known at all times. The obtained incremental formulation is variationally consistent, i.e., all internal variables follow from the minimization of a thermodynamic potential. That allows easily obtaining a vectorial model while Preisach and Jiles-Atherton are fundamentally scalar models.

====Applications====
{{Main article|Magnet#Common uses of magnets}}

There are a great variety of applications of the hysteresis in ferromagnets. Many of these make use of their ability to retain a memory, for example [[magnetic tape]], [[hard disks]], and [[credit card]]s. In these applications, ''hard'' magnets (high coercivity) like [[iron]] are desirable so the memory is not easily erased.

Magnetically ''soft'' (low coercivity) iron  is used for the cores in [[electromagnet]]s. The low coercivity reduces that energy loss associated with hysteresis. The low energy loss during a hysteresis loop is also the reason why soft iron is used for transformer cores and electric motors.

===Electrical hysteresis===

Electrical hysteresis typically occurs in [[ferroelectric]] material, where domains of polarization contribute to the total polarization. Polarization is the [[electrical dipole moment]] (either [[coulomb|C]]·[[metre|m]]&lt;SUP&gt;−2&lt;/SUP&gt; or [[coulomb|C]]·[[metre|m]]). The mechanism, an organization of the polarization into domains, is similar to that of magnetic hysteresis.

===Liquid–solid-phase transitions===
Hysteresis manifests itself in state transitions when [[melting point|melting temperature]] and freezing temperature do not agree. For example, [[agar]] melts at 85 [[Celsius|°C]] and solidifies from 32 to 40&amp;nbsp;°C. This is to say that once agar is melted at 85&amp;nbsp;°C, it retains a liquid state until cooled to 40&amp;nbsp;°C. Therefore, from the temperatures of 40 to 85&amp;nbsp;°C, agar can be either solid or liquid, depending on which state it was before.

==In biology==

===Cell biology and genetics===
{{Main article|Cell biology}}
Hysteresis in cell biology often follows [[Bistability#In biological and chemical systems|bistable systems]] where the same input state can lead to two different, stable outputs. Where bistability can lead to digital, switch-like outputs from the continuous inputs of chemical concentrations and activities, hysteresis makes these systems more resistant to noise. These systems are often characterized by higher values of the input required to switch into a particular state as compared to the input required to stay in the state, allowing for a transition that is not continuously reversible, and thus less susceptible to noise. 
 
Cells undergoing [[cell division]] exhibit hysteresis in that it takes a higher concentration of [[cyclin]]s to switch them from G2 phase into [[mitosis]] than to stay in mitosis once begun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Biochemical systems can also show hysteresis-like output when slowly varying states that are not directly monitored are involved, as in the case of the cell cycle arrest in yeast in exposed to mating pheromone.&lt;ref name="Doncic 2013"&gt;{{cite journal| author1 = Doncic, Andreas| author2 = Skotheim, Jan M| title=Feedforward regulation ensures stability and rapid reversibility of a cellular state| journal= Molecular Cell| year=2013| volume=50| issue=6| pmc=3696412| pmid=23685071| doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2013.04.014| pages=856–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the duration of cell cycle arrest depends not only on the final level of input Fus3, but also on the previously achieved Fus3 levels. This effect is achieved in due to the slower time scales involved in the transcription of intermediate Far1, such that the total Far1 activity reaches its equilibrium value slowly, and for transient changes in Fus3 concentration, the response of the system depends on the Far1 concentration achieved with the transient value. Experiments in this type of hysteresis benefit from the ability to change the concentration of the inputs with time. The mechanisms are often elucidated by allowing independent control of the concentration of the key intermediate, for instance, by using an inducible promoter.

{{Main article|Morphogen}}
In [[developmental biology]], cell type diversity is regulated by long range-acting signaling molecules called [[morphogens]] that pattern uniform pools of cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The morphogen [[sonic hedgehog]] (Shh), for example, acts on [[limb bud]] and [[neural progenitors]] to induce expression of a set of [[homeodomain]]-containing [[transcription factors]] to subdivide these tissues into distinct domains. It has been shown that these tissues have a 'memory' of previous exposure to Shh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this circuit, expression of [[Gli]] transcription factors, the executors of the Shh pathway, is suppressed. Glis are processed to repressor forms (GliR) in the absence of Shh, but in the presence of Shh, a proportion of Glis are maintained as full-length proteins allowed to translocate to the nucleus, where they act as activators (GliA) of transcription. By reducing Gli expression then, the HD transcription factors reduce the total amount of Gli (GliT), so a higher proportion of GliT can be stabilized as GliA for the same concentration of Shh.

===Immunology===

There is some evidence that T cells exhibit hysteresis in that it takes a lower signal threshold to activate T cells that have been previously activated. Ras activation is required for downstream effector functions of activated T cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Triggering of the T cell receptor induces high levels of Ras activation, which results in higher levels of GTP-bound (active) Ras at the cell surface. Since higher levels of active Ras have accumulated at the cell surface in T cells that have been previously stimulated by strong engagement of the T cell receptor, weaker subsequent T cell receptor signals received shortly afterwards will deliver the same level of activation due to the presence of higher levels of already activated Ras as compared to a naïve cell.

===Neuroscience===
{{See also|Refractory period (physiology)}}
The property by which some [[neuron]]s do not return to their basal conditions from a stimulated condition immediately after removal of the stimulus is an example of hysteresis.

===Respiratory physiology===
Lung hysteresis is evident when observing the compliance of a lung on inspiration versus expiration. The difference in compliance (Δvolume/Δpressure) is due to the additional energy required to overcome surface tension forces during inspiration to recruit and inflate additional alveoli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Escolar|first1=J. D.|first2=A. |last2=Escolar|title=Lung histeresis: a morphological view|journal=Histology and Histopathology Cellular and Molecular Biology|year=2004|volume=19|issue=1|pages=159&amp;ndash;166|pmid=14702184|url=http://www.hh.um.es/pdf/Vol_19/19_1/Escolar-19-159-166-2004.pdf|accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[transpulmonary pressure]] vs Volume curve of inhalation is different from the Pressure vs Volume curve of exhalation, the difference being described as hysteresis.

In utterances of vowel-voiceless consonant-vowel sequences during speech, the intraoral pressure is lower at the voice onset of the second vowel compared to the voice offset of the first vowel, the oral airflow is lower, the transglottal pressure is larger and the glottal width is smaller.

===Ecology and epidemiology===

Hysteresis is a commonly encountered phenomenon in ecology and epidemiology, where the observed equilibrium of a system can not be predicted solely based on environmental variables, but also requires knowledge of the system's past history.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}  Notable examples include the theory of spruce budworm outbreaks and behavioral-effects on disease transmission.

==In economics==
{{main article|Hysteresis (economics)}}
Economic systems can exhibit hysteresis. For example, [[export]] performance is subject to strong hysteresis effects: because of the fixed transportation costs it may take a big push to start a country's exports, but once the transition is made, not much may be required to keep them going.

When some negative shock reduces employment in a company or industry, fewer employed workers then remain. As usually the employed workers have the power to set wages, their reduced number incentivizes them to bargain for even higher wages when the economy again gets better instead of letting the wage be at the [[equilibrium wage]] level, where the supply and demand of workers would match. This causes hysteresis: the unemployment becomes permanently higher after negative shocks.&lt;ref name=Ball/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.nber.org/chapters/c4245 |title=Hysteresis and the European Unemployment Problem |first1=Olivier J. |last1=Blanchard |first2=Lawrence H. |last2=Summers |journal=NBER Macroeconomics Annual |volume=1 |year= 1986 |pages=15&amp;ndash;78 |doi=10.2307/3585159|jstor=3585159 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Permanently higher unemployment===

The idea of hysteresis is used extensively in the area of labor economics, specifically with reference to the [[unemployment rate]].&lt;ref name=Hargreaves-Heap&gt;S.P. Hargreaves Heap (1980). "Choosing the Wrong `Natural' Rate: Accelerating Inflation or Decelerating Employment and Growth?" The Economic Journal Vol. 90, No. 359 (Sep., 1980), pp. 611-620. {{JSTOR|2231931}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to theories based on hysteresis, severe economic downturns (recession) and/or persistent stagnation (slow demand growth, usually after a recession) cause unemployed individuals to lose their job skills (commonly developed on the job) or to find that their skills have become obsolete, or become demotivated/disillusioned/depressed or lose job-seeking skills. In addition, employers may use time spent in unemployment as a screening tool, i.e., to weed out less desired employees in hiring decisions. Then, in times of an economic upturn, recovery, or 'boom', the affected workers will not share in the prosperity, remaining unemployed for long periods (e.g., over 52 weeks). This makes unemployment "structural", i.e., extremely difficult to reduce simply by increasing the aggregate demand for products and labor without causing increased inflation.  That is, it is possible that a [[ratchet effect]] in unemployment rates exists, so a short-term rise in unemployment rates tend to persist. For example, traditional anti-inflationary policy (the use of recession to fight inflation) leads to a permanently higher 'natural' rate of unemployment (more scientifically known as the [[NAIRU]]). This occurs first because inflationary expectations are '[[sticky (economics)|sticky]]' downward due to wage and price rigidities (and so adapt slowly over time rather than being approximately correct as in theories of [[rational expectations]]) and second because labor markets do not clear instantly in response to unemployment.

The existence of hysteresis has been put forward as a possible explanation for the persistently high unemployment of many economies in the 1990s. Hysteresis has been invoked by [[Olivier Blanchard]] among others to explain the differences in long run unemployment rates between Europe and the United States. Labor market reform (usually meaning institutional change promoting more flexible wages, firing, and hiring) or strong demand-side economic growth may not therefore reduce this pool of long-term unemployed. Thus, specific targeted training programs are presented as a possible policy solution.&lt;ref name=Ball&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ball |first=Laurence M. |date=March 2009 |title=Hysteresis in Unemployment: Old and New Evidence |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 14818 |doi=10.3386/w14818 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the hysteresis hypothesis suggests such training programs are aided by persistently high demand for products (perhaps with [[incomes policies]] to avoid increased inflation), which reduces the transition costs out of unemployment and into paid employment easier.

===Game theory===
Hysteresis occurs in applications of [[game theory]] to economics, in models with product quality, agent honesty or corruption of various institutions. Slightly different initial conditions can lead to opposite outcomes and resulting stable good and bad [[Correlated equilibrium|equilibria]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Additional considerations==

===Models of hysteresis===

Each subject that involves hysteresis has models that are specific to the subject. In addition, there are models that capture general features of many systems with hysteresis.&lt;ref name="Mayergoyz2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="model1995"&gt;{{cite journal|author=R. V. Lapshin|year=1995|title=Analytical model for the approximation of hysteresis loop and its application to the scanning tunneling microscope|journal=Review of Scientific Instruments|volume=66|issue=9|pages=4718–4730|issn=0034-6748|doi=10.1063/1.1145314|url=http://www.lapshin.fast-page.org/publications.htm#analytical1995|format=PDF|bibcode = 1995RScI...66.4718L }} ([http://www.lapshin.fast-page.org/publications.htm#analytical1995 Russian translation] is available).&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the [[Preisach model of hysteresis]], which represents a hysteresis nonlinearity as a [[linear superposition]] of square loops called non-ideal relays.&lt;ref name="Mayergoyz2003"/&gt; Many complex models of hysteresis arise from the simple parallel connection, or superposition, of elementary carriers of hysteresis termed hysterons.

A simple and intuitive parametric description of various hysteresis loops may be found in the Lapshin model.&lt;ref name="model1995"/&gt; Along with the classical loop, substitution of trapezoidal or triangle pulses instead of the harmonic functions allows piecewise-linear hysteresis loops frequently used in discrete automatics to be built in the model. There is an implementation of the hysteresis model in [[R (programming language)|R programming language]] (package Hysteresis&lt;ref name=PackHyst&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hysteresis/index.html|title=Package Hysteresis (Tools for Modeling Rate-Dependent Hysteretic Processes and Ellipses)|author1=S. Maynes|author2=F. Yang|author3=A. Parkhurst|date=November 20, 2013|publisher=R-project|accessdate=June 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The [[Bouc–Wen model of hysteresis]] is often used to describe non-linear hysteretic systems. It was introduced by Bouc&lt;ref name="Bouc67"&gt;{{cite conference |first1=R. |last1=Bouc |year=1967 |title=Forced vibration of mechanical systems with hysteresis |booktitle=Proceedings of the Fourth Conference on Nonlinear Oscillation |location=Prague, Czechoslovakia |pages=315}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bouc71"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=R. |last1=Bouc |year=1971 |title=Modèle mathématique d'hystérésis:  application aux systèmes à un degré de liberté |journal=Acustica  |volume=24 |pages=16&amp;ndash;25 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; and extended by Wen,&lt;ref name="Wen76"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Y. K. |last1=Wen |year=1976  |title=Method for random vibration of hysteretic systems |journal=Journal of Engineering Mechanics|url=http://cedb.asce.org/cgi/WWWdisplay.cgi?6630|volume=102 |pages=249&amp;ndash;263 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; who demonstrated its versatility by producing a variety of hysteretic patterns. This model is able to capture in analytical form, a range of shapes of hysteretic cycles which match the behaviour of a wide class of hysteretical systems; therefore, given its versability and mathematical tractability, the Bouc–Wen model has quickly gained popularity and has been extended and applied to a wide variety of engineering problems, including multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) systems, buildings, frames, bidirectional and [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsional]] response of hysteretic systems two- and three-dimensional continua, and [[soil liquefaction]] among others. The Bouc–Wen model and its variants/extensions have been used in applications of [[Structural engineering|structural control]], in particular in the modeling of the behaviour of [[magnetorheological damper]]s, [[base isolation]] devices for buildings and other kinds of damping devices; it has also been used in the modelling and analysis of structures built of reinforced concrete, steel, masonry and timber.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}. The most important extension of Bouc-Wen Model was carried out by Baber and Noori and later by Noori and co-workers.  That extended model, named, BWBN, can reproduce the complex shear pinching or slip-lock phenomenon that earlier model could not reproduce. BWBN model has been widely used in a wide spectrum of applications and have been incorporated in several software codes such as OpenSees.

In [[climate modelling]], '''Ice-sheet models''' use [[numerical methods]] to simulate the evolution, dynamics and thermodynamics of [[ice sheet]]s, such as the [[Greenland ice sheet]], the [[Antarctic ice sheet]] or the large ice sheets on the northern hemisphere during the [[last glacial period]]. They are used for a variety of purposes, from studies of the glaciation of Earth over [[glacial cycle|glacial–interglacial cycles]] in the past to projections of ice-sheet decay under future [[global warming]] conditions.

'''Lapis armenus''', also known as '''Armenian stone''' or '''lapis stellatus''', in [[natural history]], is a variety of [[precious stone]], resembling [[lapis lazuli]], except that it is softer, and instead of veins of [[pyrite]], is intermixed with [[green]]. "The Armenian stone" is so nearly identical to ''lapis lazuli'' that it has often not been distinguished from it;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YpsbmI84LxkC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=%22armenian+stone%22+%22lapis+lazuli%22&amp;sig=OyHPxj-OKDK3v9AIqH6SqbtvS2U ''Simply Crystals''] Jackson, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Perkins Merrill|George P. Merrill]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kWkSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=%22armenian+stone%22+%22lapis+lazuli%22&amp;lr= Handbook and Descriptive Catalogue of the Collections of Gems and Precious Stones]'', p. 201, US National Museum Bull. 118, 1922&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary]]'' for instance treats the two terms as synonyms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/armenian%20stone 1998 ''Webster's'']&lt;/ref&gt; [https://www.british-history.ac.uk/Default.aspx British History Online] defines ''lapis armenus'' as "Armenian stone, or [[azurite]], a naturally occurring [[Basic copper carbonate|basic copper carbonate]], originally from [[Armenia]], but later from [[Germany]], from which [[Bice|blue bice]] was prepared. It was often found in association with another copper carbonate, [[malachite]] from which [[Bice|green bice]] was prepared... Probably because they were both [[blue]], blue bice was sometimes misinterpreted to mean lapis lazuli." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=58806#s15 Lapis armenus], citing Harley, R. D. (1970), ''Artists' Pigments, 1600-1835'', London:Butterworths.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herman Boerhaave]] believed it rather to rank among [[semi-metal]]s, and supposed it was composed of both metal and earth. He added that it only differs from ''lazuli'' in degree of maturity, and that both of them seem to contain [[arsenic]].

It has been found in [[German Tyrol|Tirol]], [[Hungary]], and [[Transylvania]], and used both in [[mosaic]] work, to make the blue [[color]] [[azure (color)|azure]], and as a treatment of [[melancholia]].&lt;ref name=blue_amulet_ingredient&gt;{{cite web | last = Burton | first = Robert | authorlink = Robert Burton (scholar) | year = 1621 | url = http://www.psyplexus.com/burton/38.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20051107085014/http://www.psyplexus.com/burton/38.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 7 November 2005 | title = SUBSECT.

The ''[[Encyclopedia Perthensis]]'' of 1816 notes that Armenian stone "was anciently  brought of Armenia, but now found in Germany, and [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Encyclopaedia Perthensis|title=Encyclopaedia Perthensis; or, Universal dictionary of Knowledge; Supp.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_QIhQ6CRJkUC&amp;pg=RA2-PA526|year=1816|page=526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15627">This is a '''list of Superfund sites in Utah''' designated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) environmental law.  The CERCLA federal law of 1980 authorized the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to create a list of [[Pollution|polluted]] locations requiring a long-term response to clean up hazardous material contaminations.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 96-510, {{USC|42|9601|9675}}), December 11, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;   These locations are known as [[Superfund]] sites, and are placed on the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL).  The NPL guides the EPA in "determining which sites warrant further investigation" for [[environmental remediation]].&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  As of May 1, 2010, there were sixteen Superfund sites on the National Priorities List in [[Utah]].&lt;ref name="NPL"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/ |title=National Priorities List |publisher=United States Enivironmental Protection Agency |accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three more sites have been proposed for entry on the list and four others have been cleaned up and removed from it.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;

There are dozens of '''cultivars of the [[onion]] (''Allium cepa'')''', one of the most widely cultivated species of the genus ''Allium'', But there are also other species cultivated as 'onions'. Many are named after the first person to breed them, or the locality they came from. Different localities often use their own common names for cultivars that are genetically almost identical. Sometimes different cultivars are known by the same common name (for example the name 'Chinese chives' could be referring to ''Allium odorum'' or ''Allium tuberosum'').
This list is based on the [[USDA]]s accepted classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://plants.usda.gov/java/ClassificationServlet?source=profile&amp;symbol=ALLIU&amp;display=63|title=Classification USDA PLANTS|date=2014-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1662">A '''meter serial number''' (or 'meter ID') is an [[alphanumeric]] reference used in [[Great Britain]] to identify an [[electricity meter]]. Although meter serial numbers are intended to be unique, this can not be assured and duplicate serial numbers do exist. There are a variety of formats used over many years, but many meter serial numbers take the form A##AA###### (e.g. S06DS123456). The first letter indicates the manufacturer, the first two digits indicate the year the meter was calibrated and certified, and the second letter (or pair of letters) indicates the company that purchased the meter. The five/six digit sequence is a serial batch number. There may be a space separating the groups of numbers and letters. Electric meters in other countries besides Great Britain do not necessarily follow this standard.

      <comment>this is wrong. "microthermal" is not derived from two Greek words both meaning the same thing, but from one "small" and one "heat"</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4038">In [[climatology]], the term '''microthermal''' is used to denote the [[continental climate]]s of [[Eurasia]] and [[North America]].

The word ''microthermal'' is derived from two [[Greek language|Greek]] words meaning "small" and "heat". This is misleading, however, since the term is intended to describe only the [[temperature]] conditions that prevail during the winter months, rather than those of the entire year.

The characteristic feature of the microthermal climate is cold winters &amp;mdash; specifically, winters that are cold enough to ensure that [[snow]] will remain on the ground continuously for a fixed period of time every year.  Conceptually, an average temperature of 0°C or colder is assumed to be necessary to bring this about; thus the climate of a location where at least one full month is this cold is classified as microthermal (however, at least one month in the summer must average 10°C or higher; otherwise the climate would be reckoned as [[Polar climate|polar]]).  This definition places all of the world's microthermal climates in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], as the absence of broad land masses at upper-middle latitudes in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] precludes the existence of such temperature conditions there.

Microthermal climates are typically subdivided into three categories based on the temperature characteristics of the summer season.  The southernmost of the three is frequently referred to as the '''temperate continental''' climate, and has hot summers &amp;mdash; that is to say, at least one month has an average temperature of 22°C (71.6°F) or above.  The middle zone is often labelled '''[[hemiboreal]]''', and no summer month there has an average temperature as warm as 22°C, but at least four months will average 10°C (50°F) or higher.  The northernmost of the three microthermal zones is the subarctic, or '''[[boreal ecosystem|boreal]]''' zone; there only one to three months will have average temperatures of at least 10°C.

In [[North America]], microthermal climates commence north of Boston along the Atlantic seaboard, this line drifting gradually southward further inland, reaching approximately 38° at the eastern edge of the [[Rocky Mountains]], then curving dramatically northward near the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast, reaching the Pacific Ocean just south of [[Juneau, Alaska]].  In [[Asia]], the latitude at which these climates begin is several degrees lower due to the pervasive influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone, or high-pressure system, and in continental [[Europe]] the line actually runs longitudinally rather than latitudinally, cutting through central [[Poland]] after beginning north of the [[Arctic Circle]] along the Norwegian coast, thereafter moving diagonally across [[Scandinavia]].

The boundary between the microthermal and polar climate zones is farthest north in western Europe (actually within the Arctic Circle there), and farthest south along the east coast of North America (at about 56° North latitude on the central coast of [[Labrador]]); it then trends northward across [[Canada]] before dropping south again as it courses through [[Alaska]].  Throughout most of [[Siberia]], the boundary tends to follow the Arctic Circle fairly closely.

In addition to having various summer temperature regimes, microthermal climates also differ from one another in how much [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] they receive &amp;mdash; such climates may be [[humid]], [[semiarid]] or [[arid]].  Most of the [[Gobi Desert|Turkestan-Gobi]] desert system has an arid microthermal climate, while the best-known example of the semiarid microthermal climate can be found in the "[[steppe]]s of [[Central Asia]]" immortalized by [[Russia]]n [[european classical music|classical music]] [[composer]] [[Alexander Borodin]].

'''''Nigeria EduSat-1''''' is a satellite built by the [[Federal University of Technology Akure]] (FUTA), created in conjunction with the Japanese [[Birds-1]] program. It is Nigeria's first satellite built by a university. It was launched from the Japanese [[Kibo (ISS module)|Kibō module]] of the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201707070166.html |title=Nigeria: Edusat-1 Satellite Goes Into Orbit Today |access-date=August 7, 2017 |publisher=[[All Africa]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Japan supports non-spacefaring countries to build their first satellites through a program called The Joint Global Multi-Nation Birds Satellite project (Birds). Five countries constructed satellites in the [[Birds-1]] program: Bangladesh, Ghana, Japan, Mongolia, and Nigeria.&lt;ref name="gunter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/bird.htm |title=Bird B, BTN, G, J, M, MYS, N, PHL (BRAC Onnesha, GhanaSat 1, Toki, Mazaalai, ''Nigeria EduSat 1'') |publisher=Gunter's Space Page |access-date=July 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, the five satellites make up the Birds-1 fleet. ''Nigeria EduSat-1'' is the first satellite built by a Nigerian university.&lt;ref name="premium"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/232592-futa-sets-nigerian-record-to-launch-satellite-into-space.html |title=FUTA sets Nigerian record, to launch satellite into space |date=May 30, 2017 |access-date=August 8, 2017 |publisher=[[Premium Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was supported by [[Kyushu Institute of Technology]] (KIT) as part of the Joint Global Multi-Nation Birds Satellite project, which is a cross-border interdisciplinary satellite project for non-spacefaring countries supported by [[Japan]]. The university also partnered with the National Space Research and Development Agency (NASRDA) Abuja, and Nigeria. The five satellites built by the five different countries were all identical in their design.&lt;ref name="News Ghana"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newsghana.com.gh/mongolia-to-send-first-satellite-off-to-space-on-june-4/ |title=Mongolia to send first satellite off to space on June 4 |work=News Ghana |date=5 June 2017 |accessdate=8 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629044626/https://www.newsghana.com.gh/mongolia-to-send-first-satellite-off-to-space-on-june-4/ |archivedate=29 June 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nigeria has a history with satellites in space. ''[[NigeriaSat-1]]'', ''[[NigeriaSat-2]]'', ''[[NigeriaSat-X]]'', ''[[NigComSat-1]]'', and ''[[NigComSat-1R]]'' were ordered by the Nigerian government, but were not built by Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/05/nigeria-launch-africas-1st-nanosatellite/ |title=Nigeria to launch Africa's 1st nanosatellite |work=Vanguard |first=Nwafor |last=Polycarp |date=18 May 2017 |access-date=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
===Launch===
[[File:Launch of CRS-11 mission.jpg|thumb|upright|SpaceX launch of CRS-11 with ''Nigeria EduSat-1'' onboard|alt=A white Falcon 9 rocket cuts through the blue sky, with its nine engines producing a bright yellow flame]]
The launch was planned for June 1, 2017, but was postponed due to poor weather conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.satnews.com/story.php?number=1574613467 |title=Nigeria's First University Smallsat Heads to ISS Aboard SpaceX Dragon |access-date=August 11, 2017 |publisher=satnews}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[SpaceX]] launched the satellite on its [[SpaceX CRS-11|CRS-11]] mission to the [[International Space Station]] on June 3, 2017. The satellite was carried in a [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon spacecraft]] on a [[Falcon 9]] rocket, launched from NASA's [[Kennedy Space Center]] [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Pad 39A]]. This was the 100th launch from Pad 39A and the first time SpaceX reused one of its Dragon capsules.&lt;ref name="sfn20170603" /&gt;

The satellite orbits the Earth at an altitude of {{convert|400|km|miles}} and at an inclination of 51.61 degrees. The satellite travels around the Earth every 92 minutes at a velocity of {{convert|7.67|km/s|mph}}.&lt;ref name="gna"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ghananewsagency.org/science/president-akufo-addo-congratulates-all-nations-university-for-ghanasat-1-satellite-119346 |title=President Akufo-Addo congratulates All Nations University for Ghanasat-1 Satellite |date=July 7, 2017 |publisher=[[Ghana News Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="face2face" /&gt;

===Operations===
The satellite communicates with seven ground stations: one in each of the countries participating in the Birds-1 program, and one each in Thailand and Taiwan.&lt;ref name="gunter" /&gt; The primary objective is for the satellite to be a technology demonstrator and to familiarize Nigerian students and scientists with satellite technology and manufacturing techniques.&lt;ref name="premium" /&gt;

'''''On Jungle Trails''''' is a book-length compilation of [[Frank Buck (animal collector)|Frank Buck]]’s stories describing how he captures wild animals. For many years, this book was a fifth grade reader in the Texas public schools, approved for state-wide use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Some of the facts Buck relates are observational, such as his description of the [[pangolin]], a scaly [[anteater]], getting his fill of red ants. Among the other accounts:

* Buck describes the capture of a [[Tiger attack|man-eating tiger]] (the only one, he explains, which was ever brought to America , the Man-eater of [[Johor]]e);
* Buck traps a rare [[clouded leopard]] when, contrary to the usual leopard habit, the cat takes refuge in a tree;
* Buck writes of trapping elephants and crocodiles;
* Buck tells of seizing of "the largest orangutan ever captured alive."

Buck brought these animals back to America; but when he obtained several tiny Malaysian [[chevrotain|mouse deer]], the smallest deer in the world, weighing two pounds, and made pets of them, a quarantine against ruminating animals made it impossible to bring them into the United States.

Buck's writes of his jungle camp and his methods for feeding and caring for his animals. At the end of the book there is a partial list of animals which Buck brought back alive to America. In an appendix there are several pages of information about various Asian animals, reptiles and birds. Buck emphasizes his refusal to kill animals and his insistence on kindness to them.
"Wherever I go, children mention this book to me and tell me how much they learned about animals and the jungle from it," said Buck.&lt;ref&gt;Current Biography 1943, pp 84-88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
"The book is so written as to be easily understood by boys and girls, and is intended to interest them especially. It is certainly quite likely to do that."&lt;ref&gt;Miscellaneous Brief Reviews. New York Times. November 28, 1937, Sunday. p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Sacred Grove (1907).jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=Black-and-white photograph of slender, tall birch trees|Photograph of the grove by [[George Edward Anderson]], circa 1907]]
The foundational event of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] took place in what is commonly referred to as the '''Sacred Grove'''. This Grove is a forested area of western [[New York (state)|New York]] near the home of [[Joseph Smith]]. It is the location where Smith said he had his [[First Vision]], an important [[theophany]] in the movement's theology, occurring in the spring of 1820.

The exact location of the Sacred Grove is not known, but it would likely have been west of Smith's adolescent home on the border of the towns of [[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra]] and [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester]]. This area was being cleared at the time for farming by the Smith family, who were also using the trees to harvest [[maple syrup]]. The area has been purchased by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), which cares for the area and allows [[tourism|tourists]] to visit. Latter Day Saints view the place as a [[Most sacred sites|sacred site]].

==First Vision==
{{Main|First Vision}}

The Sacred Grove's historical significance is as the location of Joseph Smith's [[First Vision]]. In the early 19th century, the western New York area had "caught fire" so many times with intense [[revivalism]] that it later became known as the [[burned-over district]]. As an early adolescent, the revivalism both interested and confused Smith, and he became concerned "for the wellfare of my immortal Soul," which led him to study the scriptures {{Harv|Smith|1832|pp=1&amp;ndash;2}}. Believing that "there was no society or denomination that built upon the gospel of Jesus Christ as recorded in the New Testament" {{Harv|Smith|1832|p=2}}, and not knowing where to turn for forgiveness of his [[sin]]s, he went to the woods near his home to pray {{Harv|Smith|1832|p=3}}. While praying, Smith said he saw a "pillar of light", and then "his mind was caught away" into a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] {{Harv|Pratt|1840|p=5}} where two personages, identified as God the Father and Jesus Christ, told him his sins were forgiven and that all churches were false and corrupt ({{Harvnb|Pratt|1840|p=5}}; {{Harvnb|Smith|1842c|p=748}}).

This story has become a foundational element for the LDS Church and other organizations in the [[Latter Day Saint movement]]. Adherents believe this vision started Smith on a path toward him becoming a [[prophet]], translating the [[Book of Mormon]] from [[golden plates]], and re-establishing the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]].

==Other Event==
The Sacred Grove is also suggested as a possible site where Smith showed the golden plates to [[Eight Witnesses]] in June 1829.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hillcumorah.org/grove.asp |title=The Sacred Grove |accessdate=2011-09-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321104439/http://www.hillcumorah.org/grove.asp |archivedate=2008-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's mother, [[Lucy Mack Smith]], said the event took place at a location near the Smith log home&lt;ref&gt;. Because of a foreclosure on their [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester]] property, the Smith family was then living in a log cabin, technically located in Palmyra ({{Harvnb|Smith|1883|p=14}}; {{Harvnb|Berge|1985}}).&lt;/ref&gt; "where the [Smith] family were in the habit of offering up their secret devotions to God" {{Harv|Smith|1853|p=140}}. Followers believe the plates had been taken there by the [[Angel Moroni]], who had buried them there after their abridgement 1,400 years earlier. ({{Harvnb|Smith|1853|p=140}}).

==Today==
The Sacred Grove is often visited as part of the [[Smith Family Farm]], a historical site of the LDS Church, located at 843 Stafford Road. The church operates a welcome center on the farm, which includes a replica of the log home built in 1818 by [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]], as well as the original frame home built by the Smiths in 1825.

[[Image:SacredGroveEntrance.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Entrance to the Sacred Grove as it appears today|The Sacred Grove—property owned by the LDS Church—is open to visitors.]]

Visitors to the area are able to walk through the grove on a series of interconnecting dirt trails. The majority of the trees within the Sacred Grove are too young to have been present at the time the Smith family lived there. Bob Parrot, a forestry specialist hired by the church to care for the grove, has identified only six trees in the grove that were alive in 1820; these trees are referred to as the "Witness Trees".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Portraits of the Past: 'Witness Trees' in the Sacred Grove |author=Kenneth Mays |url=http://www.mormontimes.com/article/19297/Portraits-of-the-Past-Witness-Trees-in-the-Sacred-Grove |newspaper=Mormon Times |date=13 January 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sacred Grove Conservation Program, which was created after the nearby log home was reconstructed, has been implemented to restore the grove to its 1820 size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Caretaker watches over Sacred Grove |author=Michael De Groote |url=http://www.mormontimes.com/article/6882/Caretaker-watches-over-Sacred-Grove |newspaper=Mormon Times |date=17 December 2009 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other historic sites close to the Smith Farm are the [[Hill Cumorah]] Visitors Center, where Smith said he was given the records that he translated the Book of Mormon from, as well as the [[E. B. Grandin]] Printing Shop in Palmyra, where the initial printing of the Book of Mormon took place.

[[File:Ancient monoliths in Mawphlang sacred grove.jpg|thumb|Ancient monoliths in Mawphlang sacred grove, India]]
A '''sacred grove''' or '''sacred woods''' are any [[grove (nature)|grove]] of trees that are of special religious importance to a particular culture. Sacred groves feature in various cultures throughout the world. They were important features of the mythological landscape and [[cult (religion)|cult practice]] of [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic]], [[Baltic paganism|Baltic]], [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]], [[Religion in ancient Greece|ancient Greek]], [[Religions of the Ancient Near East|Near Eastern]], [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman]], and [[Slavic polytheism|Slavic]] [[polytheism]], and were also used in India, Japan, and West Africa. Examples of sacred groves include the Greco-Roman ''[[temenos]]'', the Norse ''[[hörgr]]'', and the Celtic ''[[nemeton]]'', which was largely but not exclusively associated with [[Druid]]ic practice. During the [[Northern Crusades]], there was a common practice of building churches on the sites of sacred groves. The Lakota and various other North American tribes consider particular forests or other natural landmarks to be sacred.

Ancient holy trees remain in the English and Estonian countryside and are mentioned often in folklore and fairytales.

[[File:Pfarrkirche weissenbach an d Triesting-kirchenplatz-winter.jpg|thumb|upright|Grove in front of the church in [[:de:Herz-Jesu-Kirche (Weissenbach an der Triesting)|Weissenbach an der Triesting]]]]

There are two mentions on this tradition in the [[Bible]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Abraham]] planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there the name of God.
:—[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 21:33&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and

&lt;blockquote&gt;where the women wove hangings for the grove.
:—[[Books of Kings|II Kings]] 23:7&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Excavations at [[Labraunda]] have revealed a large shrine assumed to be that of Zeus Stratios mentioned by [[Herodotus]]&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, v.119. Herodotus adds that "the Carians are indeed the only people we know of to conduct sacrifices to Zeus Stratios"; the connection of the presiding deity at Labraunda to Hellene [[Zeus]] is simply ''[[interpretatio graeca]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; as a large sacred grove of [[plane tree]]s sacred to [[Carian]]s. In Syria, there was a grove sacred to [[Adonis]] at [[Afqa]].

===Ancient Greece and Rome===
{{Main article|Temenos|Lucus}}&lt;!--section is a bit of a list, needs reorg--&gt;

The most famous sacred groves in mainland Greece was the oak grove at [[Dodona]]. Outside the walls of Athens, the site of the [[Platonic Academy]] was a sacred grove of olive trees, still recalled in the phrase "the groves of Academe".

In central Italy, the town of [[Nemi]] recalls the [[Latin]] ''nemus Aricinum'', or "grove of [[Ariccia]]", a small town a quarter of the way around the lake. In Antiquity the area had no town, but the grove was the site of one of the most famous of Roman cults and temples: that of [[Diana Nemorensis]], a study of which served as the seed for Sir [[James Frazer]]'s seminal work on the anthropology of religion, ''[[The Golden Bough]]''.&lt;ref&gt;James Frazer, The Golden Bough, Dover reprint of 1922 abridged edition, ({{ISBN|0-486-42492-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;

A sacred grove behind the House of the [[Vestal Virgins]] on the edge of the [[Roman Forum]] lingered until its last vestiges were burnt in the [[Great Fire of Rome]] in 64 CE.

In the town of [[Spoleto]], [[Umbria]], two stones from the late third century BCE, inscribed in archaic Latin, established punishments for the profanation of the woods dedicated to Jupiter (''Lex Luci Spoletina'') have survived; they are preserved in the National Archeological Museum of Spoleto.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eng.archeopg.arti.beniculturali.it/canale.asp?id=436 National Archeological Museum of Spoleto] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508051332/http://www.eng.archeopg.arti.beniculturali.it/canale.asp?id=436 |date=2006-05-08 }} website entry for the exhibit of the inscribed stones&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Bosco Sacro'' (literally ''sacred grove'') in the garden of [[Bomarzo]], Italy, lends its associations to the uncanny atmosphere.

''Lucus Pisaurensis'',&lt;ref&gt;''Lucus Pisaurensis: Sacred Grove of Pesaro, Discovered by Annibale degli Abati Olivieri'' http://www.ilpignocco.it/en/about-us/lucus-pisaurensis/&lt;/ref&gt; the Sacred Grove of [[Pesaro]], Italy was discovered by Patrician [[Annibale degli Abati Olivieri]] in 1737 on property he owned along the 'Forbidden Road' (''Collina di Calibano''),&lt;ref&gt;''Lucus Pisaurensis'' http://www.ilpignocco.it/en/about-us/lucus-pisaurensis/&lt;/ref&gt; just outside Pesaro.   This Sacred Grove is the site of the [[Votive Stones of Pesaro]] and was dedicated to ''Salus'', the ancient Roman demi-goddess of well-being.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.italythisway.com/places/articles/pesaro-history.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Massilia, a Greek colony, had a sacred grove so close by it that Julius Caesar had it cut down to facilitate his siege.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Hutton]], ''The Druids'', p97 {{ISBN|978-1-85285-533-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[Pharsalia]]'', the poet [[Lucan]] dramatized it as a place where sunlight could not reach through the branches, where no animal or bird lived, where the wind did not blow, but branches moved on their own, where human sacrifice was practiced, in a clear attempt to dramatize the situation and distract from the sacrilege entailed in its destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Hutton, ''The Druids'', p97-8 {{ISBN|978-1-85285-533-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baltic polytheism===

[[File:Tori iiesaar.JPG|thumb|Sacred Grove Island, Estonia]]

Sacred groves have survived in the Baltic states longer than in other parts of Europe. The main [[Baltic Prussian]] sanctuary, which is also considered a sacred grove was [[Romowe]]. An important wave of destruction of sacred groves was carried out in the lands of present-day [[Lithuania]] after its [[Christianization of Lithuania|Christianization]] in 1387, and in [[Samogitia]] in 1413. However, some groves, such as in [[Šventybrastis]], still survive in Lithuania. A sacred grove is known as ''alka(s)'' in [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and ''svētbirz(i)s'' in [[Latvian language|Latvian]]. Conversely, in Estonia numerous sacred groves (''hiis'') have survived to the present day and have recently been protected by the government of the country.

===Germanic paganism===
Sacred groves feature prominently in Scandinavia. The most famous sacred grove of Northern Europe was at the [[Temple at Uppsala]] in [[Old Uppsala]], where every tree was considered sacred – described by [[Adam of Bremen]]. The practice of [[blót]] – the sacrificial ritual in [[Norse paganism]] was usually held in ''lund''s or sacred groves. According to Adam of Bremen, in Scandinavia, pagan kings sacrificed nine males of each species at the sacred groves every ninth year.&lt;ref&gt;Tshan, Francis J. [http://scandinavian.wisc.edu/mellor/myth/pdf_files/AdamBremen.pdf Adam of Bremen]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Celtic polytheism===
{{Main article|Nemeton}}
The Celts used sacred groves, called ''nemeton'' in [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]], for performing rituals, based on [[Celtic mythology]]. The deity involved was usually [[Nemetona]] – a Celtic goddess. Druids oversaw such rituals. Existence of such groves have been found in Germany, Switzerland, [[Czech Republic]] and Hungary in Central Europe,  in many sites of ancient [[Gaul]] in France, as well as England and [[Northern Ireland]]. Sacred groves had been plentiful up until the 1st century BC, when the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] attacked and conquered Gaul. One of the best known ''nemeton'' sites is that in the ''Nevet'' forest near [[Locronan]] in [[Brittany]], France. [[Gournay-sur-Aronde]] (Gournay-on-Aronde), a village in the [[Oise]] department of France, also houses the remains of a ''nemeton''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Venceslas Kruta]], ''Les Celtes, Histoire et dictionnaire'',  Robert Laffont, coll. Bouquins, Paris, 2000, ({{ISBN|2-7028-6261-6}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Meuleau, ''Les Celtes en Europe'', Éditions Édilarge, Rennes, 2004, ({{ISBN|2-7028-9095-4}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Nemetons were often fenced off by enclosures, as indicated by the German term ''Viereckschanze'' – meaning a quadrangular space surrounded by a ditch enclosed by wooden palisades.

Many of these groves, like the sacred grove at [[Didyma]], Turkey are thought to be ''nemeton''s, sacred groves protected by druids based on Celtic mythology. In fact, according to [[Strabo]], the central shrine at [[Galatia]] was called ''Drunemeton''.&lt;ref&gt;Horace L. Jones, ed. and tr. The Geography of Strabo. Vols 1-8, containing Books 1-17. Harvard University Press and Heinemann, 1917–32&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these were also sacred groves in Greek times (as in the case of Didyma), but were based on a different or slightly changed mythology.

==Today==

===Estonia===
Based on historical data, it is estimated that there are around 2500 [[sacred natural site]]s in Estonia, the largest of them covering up to 100 hectares. Although rather exceptional among most of the technologically developed countries, in Estonia both the sacred natural sites and indigenous customs connected to them are still in use. Therefore, the heritage that is connected to sacred natural sites has great importance to the national identity and environment of Estonians.

In collaboration between followers of Estonian native religion ([[Maausk]]) and governmental ministries, a national plan was prepared in 2008: "Sacred Natural Sites in Estonia: Study and Conservation 2008–2012" which includes about 550 hiis (sacred groves). The National Plan on Sacred Natural Sites consists of a historical overview about sacred natural sites in Estonia, a current situation analysis, and several concrete conservation measures and instructions on how to apply them. The coordinating steering committee of the Conservation Plan consist of Environment, Agriculture, Internal Affairs and Education and Research ministries, National Heritage Board and MK. The University of Tartu is the implementing agency. Measures of the Conservation Plan are designed to handle natural sanctuaries and values connected to them in all aspects.

The Conservation Plan foresees creating a database which supports researching and managing natural sanctuaries. The database would consist of folkloric, archaeological, natural, historical and other data on sacred natural sites and provide information on the exact location, condition and form of ownership of each site.&lt;ref&gt;Ahto Kaasik (2012) Conserving Sacred Natural sites in Estonia, in J-M Mallarach; T.

IUCN, WCPA &amp; Metsähallitus.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ghana===
Sacred groves are also present in [[Ghana]]. One of Ghana's most famous sacred groves – the Buoyem Sacred Grove – and numerous other sacred groves are present in the [[Techiman Municipal District]] and nearby districts of the [[Brong Ahafo Region]]. They provide a refuge for wildlife which has been exterminated in nearby areas, and one grove most notably houses 20,000 [[fruit bat]]s in underground caves.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/mgroups/success/2000/SARD-19.htm Entry] at the United Nations Division of Sustainable Development&lt;/ref&gt; The capital of the historical [[Ghana Empire]], contained a sacred grove called ''al-gâba'' (Ar. "the forest") for performing religious rites of the [[Soninke people]]. Other sacred groves in Ghana include sacred groves along the coastal [[savannah]]s of Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;Michael O'Neal Campbell, Traditional forest protection and woodlots in the coastal savannah of Ghana, Environmental Conservation  (2004), 31: 225-232 Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Many sacred groves in Ghana are now under federal protection – like the ''Anweam Sacred Grove'' in the [[Esukawkaw Forest Reserve]]&lt;ref&gt;Boakye Amoako-Atta, [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001138/113898eo.pdf Preservation of Sacred Groves in Ghana: Esukawkaw Forest Reserve and its Anweam Sacred Grove], Working Papers,  South-South Co-operation Programme for Environmentally Sound Socio-Economic Development in the Humid Tropics, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt; Other well-known sacred groves in present-day Ghana include the ''[[Malishegu|Malshegu]] Sacred Grove'' in [[Northern Region (Ghana)|Northern Ghana]] – one of the last remaining closed canopy forests in the savannah regions,&lt;ref&gt;C.

{{See also|Sacred groves of India}}

In India, sacred groves are scattered all over the country, and do enjoy protection. Prior to 2002 these forest regions were not recognized under any of the existing laws. But in 2002 an amendment was brought in Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 to include Sacred Groves under the act. Some NGOs work with local villagers to protect such groves. Each grove is associated with a presiding deity, and the groves are referred to by different names in different parts of India. They were maintained by local communities with hunting and logging strictly prohibited within these patches. While most of these sacred deities are associated with local [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]] gods, sacred groves of Islamic and Buddhist origins are also known. Sacred groves occur in a variety of places – from [[Deserts and xeric shrublands|scrub forest]]s in the [[Thar Desert]] of [[Rajasthan]] maintained by the [[Bishnoi]]s, to [[rain forest]]s in the [[Kerala]] [[Western Ghats]]. [[Himachal Pradesh]] in the North and Kerala in the South are specifically known for their large numbers of sacred groves. The [[Kodavas]] of Karnataka maintained over 1000 sacred groves in Kodagu alone.&lt;ref&gt;A [http://www.cseindia.org/dte-supplement/forest20031231/forest-index.htm series] of articles in the journal ''Down to Earth'' on sacred groves&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hindu worship place from North Kerala (4).jpg|thumb|A sacred grove in India]]

Around 14,000 sacred groves have been reported from all over India, which act as reservoirs of rare fauna, and more often rare flora, amid rural and even urban settings. Experts believe that the total number of sacred groves could be as high as 100,000. Threats to the groves include urbanization, and [[over-exploitation]] of resources. While many of the groves are looked upon as abode of Hindu gods, in the recent past a number of them have been partially cleared for construction of shrines and temples.&lt;ref&gt;Malhotra, K. C., Ghokhale, Y., Chatterjee, S. and Srivastava, S., Cultural and Ecological Dimensions of Sacred Groves in India, INSA, New Delhi, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramachandra Guha, The Unquiet Woods, University of California Press, 2000 ({{ISBN|978-0520222359}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritualistic dances and dramatizations based on the local deities that protect the groves are called ''Theyyam'' in Kerala and ''Nagmandalam'', among other names, in [[Karnataka]]. There are sacred groves in Ernakulam region in a place named Mangatoor in Kerala. Sacred groves are being destroyed as a part of [[urbanization]]. The family "Nalukettil Puthenpurayil" still protects sacred groves.

===Japan===
Sacred groves in Japan are typically associated with [[Shinto shrine]]s, and are located all over Japan. They have existed since ancient times and shrines are often built in the midst of preexisting groves. The [[Cryptomeria]] tree is venerated in [[Shinto]] practice, and considered sacred.

Among the sacred groves associated with such ''jinja''s or Shinto shrines is the 20-hectare wooded area associated with {{nihongo|Atsuta Shrine|熱田神宮|Atsuta-jingū}} at [[Atsuta-ku, Nagoya]].  The 1500-hectare forest associated with [[Kashima Shrine]] was declared a "protected area" in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Secretariat of the [http://www.cbd.int/  Convention on Biodiversity]: [http://www.cbd.int/doc/publications/cbd-ts-36-en.pdf  "Protected Areas in Today's World: Their Values and Benefits for the Welfare of the Planet,"] CBC technical Series No. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Today it is part of the [[Kashima Wildlife Preservation Area]].  The woods include over 800 kinds of trees and varied animal and plant life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://int.kateigaho.com/spr05/forests-sacred.html A guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070124042747/http://int.kateigaho.com/spr05/forests-sacred.html |date=2007-01-24 }} to Japan's sacred forests at ''kateigaho.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|[[Tadasu no Mori]]|糺の森}} is a general term for a wooded area associated with the [[Kamo Shrine]], which is a Shinto sanctuary near the banks of the Kamo River in northeast Kyoto.&lt;ref&gt;Terry, Philip. (1914).

====Okinawa====
The [[Utaki]] sacred sites (often with associated burial grounds) on [[Okinawa]] are based on [[Ryukyuan religion]], and usually are associated with [[toun]] or ''kami-asagi'' – regions dedicated to the gods where people are forbidden to go. Sacred groves are often present in such places, as also in [[Gusuku]]s – fortified areas which contain sacred sites within them.&lt;ref&gt;Asato Susumu, [http://www.jpf.go.jp/e/culture/news/0412/img/pdf/report07.pdf From Gusuku to Utaki : Okinawa’s Sacred Areas from an Archeological Perspective] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628173416/http://www.jpf.go.jp/e/culture/news/0412/img/pdf/report07.pdf |date=2007-06-28 }}, Board of Education of Urasoe&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Seifa-utaki]] was designated as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] designated in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Wonder Okinawa: [http://www.wonder-okinawa.jp/002/002/e_riyu.html World Heritage site inclusion]&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a triangular cavern formed by gigantic rocks, and contains a sacred grove with rare, indigenous trees like the [[Kubanoki]] (a kind of palm) and the ''yabunikkei'' or [[Cinnamomum]] japonicum (a form of wild cinnamon). Direct access to the grove is forbidden.

===Malaysia===
Much of the ways of the ancient inhabitants of [[Malaysia]] have largely been forgotten, mostly due to the taboos among the local populace on putting certain esoteric knowledge down in ink, thus only passed down through examples and word of mouth from mother to daughter and father to son. However, much can be observed by the ways and habits of the natives of Malaysia which include 18 tribes of [[Orang Asli]] ([[Malay language|Malay]] for Natural People) and the [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]], who are often regarded as the 19th tribe.

There is a practice of tree planting around houses to the extent that the walls and wooden structures are allowed to give way to the roots of creeping plants, purposely sown at the bases of these structures. With increased migration towards the larger cities, these houses are abandoned and allowed to return to nature. As most traditional Orang Asli and Malay houses are made of only wood, bamboo, rattan and woven palm leaves (being built without using a single nail), the remains of those houses crumble easily into its surrounding.

Besides that, a practice of creating arches of [[vine]] and creeping flowering plants so that each time one were to enter the gates of the house, one has to bow, as if implying or imitating respect upon entry to a sacred grove which were practiced by their [[ancestors]]. Such practices are even performed by those who have migrated into the cities who prefer to live in houses on the ground, rather than in high rise apartments. A garden of fruit trees surrounded by larger trees are planted around the houses to provide shade and an illusion of being at 'home' as well as to provide sustenance (in the form of fruits and seeds) to squirrels, foxes, insects and birds. Commonly, a cat, or in most instances, many cats are kept to patrol the gardens and guard from harmful spirits as well as against [[rat]]s which were believed to carry [[unclean spirits]] and diseases.

However, one of the most striking example of the tree reverence among them can be seen in the [[graveyards]] which are considered as [[Sacred#Sacred ground|holy ground]], on which no stone structure can be built upon. The whole area are covered by large and tall trees, so much foliage that the scorching tropical sun is reduced to a dim shadow as temperatures drop to a comfortable cool. Malay folklore relates that the trees whisper prayers to the creator in [[absolution]] of the past transgression of the ground's once human inhabitants. The trees are also allowed to take root into the graves where the grave keepers (''penjaga kubur'' in Malay) slowly remove gravestones (which used to be made from wood) as they are ejected from the grounds onto the surface. There is also a ritual of planting small tree [[sapling]] on fresh graves by family members who will then water it and tend to it periodically. Petals from fresh red and pink roses are also brought upon visitation to be scattered on the graves and a ritual of pouring rose water upon the soils are also performed.

The Malays regard visiting the graves from between sunset to sunrise as a [[taboo]] as it is believed that as sunrise is the beginning of day to mankind, sunset is perceived as the beginning of ''day'' to those who dwell in the grave area. Burials are almost always postponed until the next day except in certain cases where it is allowed, provided that additional rules are observed, such as, women and children are not allowed at the night time burial ceremony.

An ancient ritual of renaming the deceased as she or he is laid into the earth is also practiced. The Orang Asli and Malay (see [[Malaysian names]]) naming system has a living name and a spirit name, which is given during the ritual of burial. This name is known as ''nama arwah'' (spirit name). The living name is usually the given name plus the word 'anak' which means 'son/daughter of' or 'bin' and 'binti' which mean 'son of' or 'daughter of' respectively; followed by the name of the father. When a person dies, the father's name is replaced with his or her mother's name and this is made known during the reading of burial sentences.

[[File:Rio Osun.jpg|thumb|[[Osun-Osogbo Sacred Grove]], Nigeria]]
The concept of sacred groves is present in [[Nigeria]]n mythology as well. The [[Osun-Osogbo|Osun-Osogbo Sacred Grove]], containing dense forests, is located just outside the city of [[Osogbo]], and is regarded as one of the last virgin high forests in Nigeria. It is dedicated to the fertility goddess in [[Yoruba mythology]], and is dotted with shrines and sculptures. [[Oba (ruler)#Oloye|Oloye]] 
[[Susanne Wenger]], an Austrian artist, helped revive the grove. The grove was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1118 Entry] at the UNESCO website&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thailand===
Sacred groves, mostly connected to [[Thai folklore|Thai folk belief]], are known to have existed in Thailand since medieval times. Recently, new areas are being marked off as sacred as an environmental movement.

===United States of America===

The Lakota and various other North American tribes consider particular forests or other natural landmarks to be sacred. This is one of the reasons that there has been recent dispute over the nullification of acknowledgment of Native American reservation land by the US government and an attempt to compensate Native Americans for the reacquisition of this sacred space.&lt;ref&gt;[[Black Hills Land Claim]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=September 2015}}

The [[Bohemian Grove]], located at 20601 Bohemian Avenue, in [[Monte Rio, California]], is a sacred grove belonging to a private San Francisco-based men's art club known as the [[Bohemian Club]]. In mid-July each year, Bohemian Grove hosts a two-week, three-weekend encampment of some of the most powerful men in the world, where they perform symbolic rituals, such as [[Cremation of Care]].

[[Soil salinity]] and [[dryland salinity]] are two problems degrading the [[environment of Australia]]. Salinity is a concern in most states, but especially in the south-west of [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name="monwd"&gt;[http://www.science.org.au/nova/032/032key.htm Monitoring the white death – soil salinity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224111521/http://www.science.org.au/nova/032/032key.htm |date=2008-12-24 }}. Australian Academy of Science.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Eastern Mallee]] and the [[Western Mallee]] of [[Western Australia]] are areas that are prone to salinity with little remedial action being undertaken to rectify the problem. Lands surrounding [[Lake Bryde-East Lake Bryde]] and [[Dumbleyung Lake]] have also been affected.

In the [[Murray River]] valley [[irrigation]] has caused salinity problems. Land surrounding the town of [[Werrimull, Victoria|Werrimull]] in the northwest of Victoria have been affected by salinity due to [[Land clearing in Australia|land clearing]].

==Process==
The soil in Australia naturally contains salt, having accumulated over thousands of years. This salt may come from prevailing winds carrying ocean salt, the evaporation of inland seas, and from weathered parent rocks.&lt;ref name="monwd"/&gt; Rainfall absorbs this salt on the surface, and carries it down into the subsoil where it is stored in unsaturated soil profiles, until it is once again mobilised by ground water and rising [[water table]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, David (1999). [http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/BT96110.htm Australian Trees for the Rehabilitation of Waterlogged and Salinity Damaged Landscapes]. ''[[Australian Journal of Botany]]'', '''47''': 697–716.&lt;/ref&gt; When this ground water comes closer to the surface, this salt is also brought up. As the water eventually evaporates, it leaves behind all this concentrated salt, resulting in soil salinity. 
This can be caused by an imbalance in the [[hydrological cycle]], or by irrigation.

Prior to British settlement in 1788, [[groundwater]] levels were in [[Hydrostatic equilibrium|equilibrium]]. Seasonal recharge, and year-round utilisation of ground water by deep rooted native vegetation resulted in ground water levels remaining static.&lt;ref&gt;C.J. Clarke, R.J. George, R.W. Bell, T.J. Hatton (January 2002). [http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/SR01028.htm Dryland salinity in south-western Australia: its origins, remedies, and future research directions], ''Australian Journal of Soil Research'', '''40'''(1): 93–113.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Land clearing in Australia]] has resulted in a loss of this native vegetation, replaced largely by [[agriculture in Australia|agriculture]] and [[pasture]] crops. These are often [[annual plants]] and shallow rooted, and thus, unable to intercept, and adequately absorb stored, and rising ground water. This creates an imbalance in the hydrological cycle, and results in [[dryland salinity]].
Salinity is classified as a dissolved salt content of a substance like soil or water. Salinity can prevent crops and other vegetation from growing leaving land empty.

[[Image:Wheatbelt Versalzungsschaden.JPG|thumb|right|Salinity damage in the wheatbelt region of Western Australia near [[Babakin, Western Australia|Babakin]].]]

[[Irrigation in Australia|Irrigation]] is also a contributor to salinity. Firstly, the addition of irrigation acts to simulate rainfall, and if not applied at appropriate levels, can result in the recharge of water tables, and promotes rises in the water table.&lt;ref&gt;Pels, S. 1978. Waterlogging and Salinization in Irrigated Semi-arid Regions of NSW. ''Search'' Volume 9, pp 273-276.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=I failed to find this source. How to find it?|date=June 2015}} 
Secondly, irrigation water itself can contain salts, which are deposited into the soil with its use. This level of salt can range from 0.5 - 2 tonne per hectare per year, and can greatly increase natural salt levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = ILRI | title = Effectiveness and Social/Environmental Impacts of Irrigation Projects: a Review  | series = In: Annual Report 1988 of the International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI) | year = 1989 | pages = 18–34 | location = Wageningen, The Netherlands | url = http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects and impacts==
Over time this process has caused the thin top-soil layers to become irreversibly salty, and no longer suited for agriculture. By 1999 an estimated 2.5&amp;nbsp;million hectares of land had become salinised since the introduction of European farming methods.&lt;ref name=ABCSlab99&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/slab/salinity/default.htm | publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | year=1999 | title=Salinity - our silent disaster | first=Justin | last=Murphy | accessdate=29 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, around 5.7&amp;nbsp;million hectares of land is classed as having 'high potential' for salinisation, which that number expected to rise to 17&amp;nbsp;million hectares by 2050.&lt;ref name=Salinity&gt;[http://www.environment.gov.au/land/pressures/salinity/index.html Salinity].

High soil salt levels have dramatic impact on plant root zones, in both native vegetation as well as agricultural and pasture crops, natural wetlands and surrounding water ways. An increase in salt can decrease the ability of plants to absorb water through their roots via [[osmosis]], cause leaf burn and [[necrosis]] through increased levels of [[sodium]] and [[chloride]], and create nutrient and [[ion]]ic imbalances, resulting in poor growth, and death.&lt;ref name="Dryland salinity – causes and impacts"&gt;[http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/309381/Dryland-salinity-causes-and-impacts.pdf] Department of Primary Industry, NSW government&lt;/ref&gt; Salinity can also adversely affect infrastructure such as roads and buildings, and underground pipes and cables through [[oxidation]].&lt;ref name=Salinity /&gt;

''[[Muehlenbeckia horrida subsp. abdita]]'', commonly known as the Remote Thorny Lignum, is a critically endangered species due to its intolerance to salinity.

===Impacts by state===

====New South Wales====
Currently 5% of [[New South Wales]] is affected by dry land salinity, and around 50% is under threat.&lt;ref name="Salinity, Australia's Silent Flood"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/learn/silentflood/stats.htm#wa] ABC.&lt;/ref&gt;
15% of current irrigated land is impacted, and up to 70% is currently under threat.&lt;ref name="Salinity, Australia's Silent Flood" /&gt; 
The main regions currently affected, and at high risk, are The Murrumbidgee River catchment near Griffith, and Jemalong River Catchment near Forbes, as well as the Murray River irrigation area near Deniliquin.&lt;ref name="Salinity, Australia's Silent Flood" /&gt;

====Victoria====
The current levels of salinity in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] are relatively small, with the main impact expected to occur in high risk areas in the coming years.
These high risk areas include the Campaspe, Loddon, Corangamite, Glenelg-Hopkins, Goulburn-Broken catchments, and Wimmera and Mallee regions.&lt;ref name="Four Corners" &gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/water/map/vic.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;
The current cost to Victoria is estimated at $50million per year. This is expected to rise significantly with the impacts on agricultural land, wetlands and infrastructure in high risk areas to increase, mainly in part to an anticipated 10 fold increase in salt levels by 2050.&lt;ref name="Salinity, Australia's Silent Flood" /&gt;

====Western Australia====
[[Western Australia]] contains the majority of land affected by salinity in Australia, with around 70%. 
Over 2 million hectares are currently affected, and around 4 million hectares of land are currently listed as high risk, and 50% of divertible water is already considered overly saline.&lt;ref name="Salinity, Australia's Silent Flood" /&gt;
Around 450 plant species are endemic to areas that are at high risk of salinisation&lt;ref&gt;George R, Short R, Short B &amp; Pinjarra, 2006. Estimating the extent of salinity.

75% of water bird species in decline, a 75% reduction in sealed road life, and $400million in lost profits.&lt;ref name="Salinity, Australia's Silent Flood"/&gt;

====South Australia====
Salinity in [[South Australia]] is a problem in all principal agricultural areas, with 370000 hectares of land and wetlands impacted. At current rates, this is expected to increase by 60% by 2050.&lt;ref name="Salinity - Overview - South Australia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anra.gov.au/topics/salinity/overview/sa.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121120500/http://www.anra.gov.au/topics/salinity/overview/sa.html |archivedate=2011-11-21 |df= }} Australian Natural Resources Atlas, Department of Sustainabililty, Environment, Water, Population and Communities.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is expected to cost the state around $47million per year in lost agricultural profit, and is expected to taint more than 20% of ground water to levels above those safe for human consumption.&lt;ref name="Salinity, Australia's Silent Flood" /&gt;

====Tasmania====
[[Tasmania]] is relatively unaffected by salinity, with around 1% of agricultural land, and 8% of farm land adversely affected by salt, resulting in a current cost to the state of around $5million per year, rising to around $13million by 2050. The majority of this salinity is irrigation based.&lt;ref name="Salinity, Australia's Silent Flood" /&gt;

====Queensland====
[[Queensland]] is the least affected state of Australia, due to its unique seasonal rainfall. Around 15000 hectares are currently affected, with 3.1million hectares considered highrisk.&lt;ref name="Salinity, Australia's Silent Flood" /&gt;
At current rates however, salinity is predicted to have moderate scale impacts on land and infrastructure by 2050, with 12,000&amp;nbsp;km of roads, 1500&amp;nbsp;km of rail lines, and around 2.8million hectares of agricultural land, remnant vegetation, and wetlands and streams negatively affected&lt;ref&gt;Brough, M. 2007.

==Impact reduction and management==

===Government initiatives===
The Australian governments have taken an integrated approach to target different scales of management. The approach is to manage the salinity issue at national, regional and state levels, down to local and individual farmers. Since 1983 the Australian governments have actioned the National Soil Conservation Program, National [[Landcare Australia|Landcare]] Program, [[Natural Heritage Trust]], National Action Plan for Salinity and Water and Caring for our Country.

The National Landcare Program focused on improving resource management and practices at the farm and local level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://svc009.wic050p.server-web.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DAFF-Decade-NLP-REVIEW-2003.pdf National Landcare Program Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424124158/http://svc009.wic050p.server-web.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DAFF-Decade-NLP-REVIEW-2003.pdf |date=2012-04-24 }} 2003. Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Dryland Salinity Program (1993 to 2004), funded a broad range of research and development from which to roll out further government programs.&lt;ref&gt;Van Bueren, M., and Price, R.J., 2004, [http://lwa.gov.au/files/products/national-dryland-salinity-program/px040647/px040647.pdf Breaking Ground — Key Findings from 10 Years of Australia’s National Dryland Salinity Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602120009/http://lwa.gov.au/files/products/national-dryland-salinity-program/px040647/px040647.pdf |date=2011-06-02 }}. Land &amp; Water Australia, Canberra.&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality (NAPSWQ), implemented together with the [[Natural Heritage Trust]] (NHT) program, ran from 2000 to 2008. The NAPSWQ was adopted through an intergovernmental agreement between Australian commonwealth, state and territory governments. The plan aimed to help support community action and land managers in adversely affected catchments, and was rolled out by regional Natural Resource Management (NRM) organisations. The governments committed $1.4 billion over seven years to tackle the salinity problem. The plan involved input and participation from government, community, local business and land managers. The NAPSWQ focused on 21 regions across Australia that were deemed; through hazard assessments and [[dryland salinity]] risk, to be most affected by salinity and water problems.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Government 2008 [http://www.napswq.gov.au/napswq/index.html What is the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406083422/http://www.napswq.gov.au/napswq/index.html |date=2011-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the NAPSWQ was to motivate and enable regional communities in preventing, stabilising and reversing trends in salinity; improve water quality and secure reliable allocations for both human, industrial and environment use.&lt;ref name="Sinclair"&gt;Sinclair Knight Merz 2006 [http://www.nrm.gov.au/publications/books/pubs/evaluation-salinity.pdf Evaluation of salinity outcomes of regional investment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110601225739/http://www.nrm.gov.au/publications/books/pubs/evaluation-salinity.pdf |date=2011-06-01 }}. Report to the Department of the Environment and Heritage and Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The overarching objectives of the NHT were biodiversity conservation, sustainable use of natural resources, community capacity building and institutional change.&lt;ref name="Sinclair" /&gt;
The final report for the NAPSWQ states that ‘With few exceptions the massive efforts involved in delivering NAPSWQ and NHT programs have at best halted the degradation of these resources. This has reinforced the view of the [[State of the Environment|State of Environment]] (SoE) Report that concluded that the condition of these resources continues to decline despite the best efforts of the community and government'.&lt;ref&gt;State Natural Resource Management Office 2010 [http://www.nrm.wa.gov.au/nrm-in-wa/key-publications/national-action-plan.aspx National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality and Natural Heritage Trust program 2003–2009 Final Report].

In 2008 the initiative Caring for our Country was started to replace the National Action Plan, which had ceased.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napswq.gov.au/ National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060424155459/http://www.napswq.gov.au/ |date=2006-04-24 }}.

===Best management practice===
There is no clear agreement about what constitutes best management practice for salinity in Australia. While there are a range of techniques and strategies available, success is often varied from one context to the next; there is no simple solution. Location, time frame and personal circumstances may all influence the effectiveness of particular options.&lt;ref name="CSIRO"&gt;CSIRO. (2011). Salinity – Frequently asked questions. Retrieved from: http://www.clw.csiro.au/issues/salinity/faq.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Measham"&gt;Measham, T.G., Kelly, G.J. &amp; Smith, F.P. (2007). Best management practice for complex problems: a case study of defining BMP for dryland salinity. Geographical Research, 45(3), p. 262-272.&lt;/ref&gt;

Possible management strategies include:&lt;ref name="CSIRO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Measham" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pannell, D.J. &amp; Ewing, M.A. (2006). Managing secondary dryland salinity: Options and challenges. Agricultural Water Management,80(1-3), p. 41-56.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The use of salt-tolerant plants, such as:
**''[[Atriplex amnicola]]''
**Saltgrow - a hybrid gum tree being utilized within Australia to try to reverse damage within affected high-salinity areas.&lt;ref name=NAFI&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nafi.com.au/news/view.php3?id=187 | title=This Little Tree Can Help Save the Murray | first=Sean | last=Fewster | publisher=National Association of Forest Industries | date=5 February 2002 | accessdate=29 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tree has been highly successful, and has been attributed to be able to completely remove salinity within damaged areas and allowed new grasses and shrubs that are not salt resistant, to grow.
*The use of perennial crops and pastures
*Engineering responses including deep drainage and pumping (to lower groundwater)
*Reverse banks and interceptor banks (to divert surface water)
*Revegetation with native species
*Establishing trees
*Preventing further clearing in vulnerable areas

A number of organisations are seeking ways to reduce the impact of salinity on Australian agriculture, including the Cooperative Research Centre for Plant-Based Management of Dryland Salinity.&lt;ref name=DAFWA&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.agric.wa.gov.au/PC_92418.html | title=Salinity in Western Australia | publisher=[[Department of Agriculture and Food (Western Australia)]] | date=February 2009 | accessdate=29 August 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121127020441/http://www.agric.wa.gov.au/PC_92418.html | archivedate=27 November 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greening Australia]] and [[Australian Centre for Plant Functional Genomics]] have also implemented projects to alleviate salinity in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2002/09/19/674726.htm | first=Maryke | last=Steffens | title=Native plants get a grip | date=19 September 2002 | publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | accessdate=29 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.agribusiness-australia.com.au/research/200910/the-australian-centre-for-plant-functional-genomics/ | title=The Australian Centre for Plant Functional Genomics | date=20 October 2009 | publisher=''Agribusiness Australia'' | accessdate=29 August 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219235534/http://www.agribusiness-australia.com.au/research/200910/the-australian-centre-for-plant-functional-genomics/ | archivedate=19 February 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community-based management strategies===
Community-based approaches have been a key feature of many regional salinity management programs in Australia. This is in response to various government initiatives, notably the National [[Landcare Australia|Landcare]] Program (1989), [[Natural Heritage Trust]] (1997) and the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality (2000).&lt;ref name="Kingwell"&gt;Kingwell, R., John, M. &amp; Robertson, M. (2008). A review of a community-based approach to combating land degradation: dryland salinity management in Australia. Environment, Development and Sustainability, 10(6), p. 899-912.&lt;/ref&gt;
This approach provides the social platform required in many cases for the successful adoption of salinity management practices. Often lacking however, is the presence of scientific skills and detailed knowledge needed to develop viable technical and economic salinity management options.&lt;ref name="Kingwell" /&gt; It is also suggested that community-based approaches may reinforce existing power structures, disadvantaging those who are already marginalised when making decisions about salinity management.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, M.J., Measham, T.G., Batchelor, G., George, R., Kingwell, R. &amp; Hosking, K. (2009). Effectiveness of a publicly funded demonstration program to promote management of dryland salinity. Journal of Environmental Management, 90(10), p. 3023-3030.&lt;/ref&gt;

Below are some examples of community-based programs currently operating in Australia and their contributions to salinity management.

====Landcare====
[[Landcare Australia|Landcare]] groups involve community members and landowners working together in a voluntary capacity to improve land management practices.&lt;ref&gt;Cary, J. &amp; Webb, T. (2001). Landcare in Australia: Community participation and land management.  Journal of Soil and Water Conservation, 56(4), p. 274-279.&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to the management of salinity, these groups have been effective in: raising awareness and educating the community about dryland salinity; allowing local knowledge and information to be shared in order to develop suitable management plans; developing skills, building capacity and empowering communities to address salinity issues.&lt;ref name="Kingwell" /&gt;

====Saltwatch====
Established in Victoria in 1987, Saltwatch is an ongoing community- and school-based program focused on monitoring salinity levels in Australian waterways. Students, teachers and community members are involved in collecting water samples from their local area, conducting salinity tests and recording this data. It is an effective educational tool that provides opportunities for partnerships to be developed between government agencies and the wider community, however it is not necessarily linked directly to the implementation of salinity management strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Sustainability and Environment, State of Victoria. (2011). [http://www.dse.vic.gov.au/land-management/land/salinity/saltwatch Saltwatch].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pfueller, S., Innes-Wardell, I., Skondras, H., Marshall, D. &amp; Kruger, T. (1997). An Evaluation of Saltwatch: A school and community action research environmental education project. Australian Journal of Environmental Education, 13(1997), p. 61-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate change and its impact on salinity==
There are mixed predictions in relation to [[Climate change in Australia|climate change]]’s effect on salinity in Australia. Climate change can be seen to appease salinity in Australia in some circumstances, but in others it may have detrimental effects. It is predicted that in some instances climate change will result in the reduction in annual rainfall leading to a drier and warmer climate, which will ultimately reduce salinity.  Conversely climate changes impact on the salt concentration in water bodies is expected to be unfavourable.

Where there is a reduction in rainfall it is expected that salinity will be reduced. This will occur as a result of the water table being recharged less often, reducing the chance of the water table transporting underground salts to the surface of the land.&lt;ref name="mal"/&gt; Climate change may also result in the offsetting of rainfall into different seasons, resulting in larger down pours and extreme weather events in some locations within Australia. In these instances as evaporation will not occur at a faster pace than rainfall, it is likely to result in excessive additions to aquifers, which is also known as deep drainage.&lt;ref name="sensp"&gt;Van Ittersum, M. K., Howden S. M. and Asseng S., 2003. Sensitivity of productivity and deep drainage of wheat cropping systems in a Mediterranean environment to changes inCO2, temperature and precipitation. Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment 97: 255–73&lt;/ref&gt; This is an issue as dryland salinity is onset by additional deep drainage. In Australia this will be most evident in South Australia, Victoria and the lower half of Western Australia.&lt;ref name="mal"/&gt; However these changes are expected to be minimal as the water table may already be reduced from excessive periods of drought.&lt;ref name="sensp"/&gt;

On the other hand, the reduction of water in streams, rivers, water bodies and the like is likely to result in an increase of salt concentration in these water bodies. This will be particularly evident in groundwater flow systems of different catchments.&lt;ref name="mal"&gt;Campbell, A. 2008. Managing Australian Landscapes in a Changing Climate: A climate change primer for regional Natural Resource Management bodies. Report to the Department of Climate Change, Canberra, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; Austin ''et al.'' of CSIRO  have predicted that water in the Murrumbidgee will drop by up to approximately 48% by 2070 which will result in salt yields on the surface of the land falling by approximately 30%, however the stream salinity concentrations are predicted to increase by 11%.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, Jenet, Lu Zhang, Roger Jones, Paul Durack, [[Warrick Dawes]] and Peter Hairsine (2006) Implications of Climate Change for Natural Resource Management: an assessment of the impact of climate change on catchment salt and water balances in the Murray-Darling Basin.

[[Image:Scotia Sea.png|thumb|Approximate area of the sea in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]]]
The '''Scotia Sea''' is a [[sea]] located at the northern edge of the [[Southern Ocean]] at its boundary with the [[South Atlantic Ocean]]. It is bounded on the west by the [[Drake Passage]] and on the north, east, and south by the [[Scotia Arc]], an undersea ridge and [[island arc]] system supporting various islands. The sea sits atop the [[Scotia Plate]]. It is named after the expedition ship [[Scotia (barque)|''Scotia'']].

==Location and description==
The Scotia Sea is the area of water between the Drake Passage, [[Tierra del Fuego]], [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], the [[South Sandwich Islands]], the [[South Orkney Islands]], and the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. These island groups all sit atop the Scotia Arc, which frames the sea on the north, east, and south. The Scotia Sea covers an area around {{convert|900000|km2|sqmi|-2|abbr=on}}. About half of the sea stands above the [[continental shelf]].

==History==
The sea was named about 1932 after the ''[[Scotia (barque)|Scotia]]'', the expedition ship used in these waters by the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition (1902–04) under [[William S. Bruce]]. The most famous traverse of this frigid sea was made in 1916 by Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]] and five others in the adapted lifeboat ''James Caird'' when they left [[Elephant Island]] and reached South Georgia two weeks later.

In [[Argentina]], the Scotia Sea is considered part of an area known as the ''Mar Argentino'', and several territories claimed but not occupied by Argentina, such as South Georgia and the Falkland Islands, lie within this region.

==Flora and fauna==
The islands bordering the Scotia Sea are rocky and partly covered in ice and snow year round; despite these harsh conditions, however, the islands do support vegetation and have been described as the Scotia Sea Islands tundra [[ecoregion]], which includes South Georgia, the volcanic South Sandwich Islands, and the South Orkneys in the Scotia Sea, as well as the remote [[South Shetland Islands]] near the Antarctic Peninsula and the small isolated volcano called [[Bouvet Island]]. All these islands lie in the cold seas below the [[Antarctic convergence]]. These areas support [[tundra]] vegetation consisting of [[moss]]es, [[lichen]]s, and [[algae]], while seabirds, penguins, and seals feed in the surrounding waters.

Seabirds include four species of albatross: black-browed albatross ''([[Diomedea melanophris]])'', grey-headed albatross ''([[Thalassarche chrysostoma]])'', light-mantled albatross ''([[Phoebetria palpebrata]])'', and wandering albatross ''([[Diomedea exulans]])''. Only five species of birds remain on land on the islands, and these include an endemic race of the yellow-billed pintail duck ''([[Anas georgica]])'' and the endemic South Georgia pipit ''([[Anthus antarcticus]])''. Other birds include the [[southern giant petrel]], with sizeable colonies on [[Bird Island, South Georgia|Bird Island]].

[[Penguin]] species found here include large numbers of [[king penguin]]s on South Georgia especially, as well as [[chinstrap penguin]], [[macaroni penguin]], [[gentoo penguin]], [[Adelie penguin]], and rockhopper penguin ''([[Eudyptes chrysocome]])''.

Seals include the Antarctic fur seal ''([[Arctocephalus gazella]])'' and sub-Antarctic fur seal ''([[Arctocephalus tropicalis]])'' in large numbers, [[leopard seal]] ''(Hydrurga leptonyx)'', [[Weddell seal]] ''(Leptonychotes weddellii)'', the huge [[southern elephant seal]] ''(Mirounga leonina)'', and [[crabeater seal]] ''(Lobodon carcinophagus)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Marielandia Antarctic tundra|id=an1101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threats and preservation==
[[File:Scotia-sea.png|right|400px|Map of Scotia Sea. Toponyms: Undersea relief, maritime, nearby lands, countries and cities. Isobath interval: 2000 m]]
Although the islands have a harsh climate and have never been permanently occupied, they have long been used as a base for fishing and seal hunting. Wildlife on these remote islands is threatened by [[introduced species]], especially on South Georgia, where even large animals, including (now removed) [[reindeer]], have been brought to the islands. Further damage to ecosystems results from overfishing.  South Georgia, the South Sandwich Islands, and Bouvet Island are protected as nature reserves, with [[Bird Island, South Georgia]], being a [[site of special scientific interest]]. The seals are further protected by international agreements, and fur seal populations are recovering.

The '''Sierra Madre del Sur pine-oak forests''' is a [[tropical and subtropical coniferous forests|subtropical coniferous forest]] [[ecoregion]] of the [[Sierra Madre del Sur]] mountain range of southern [[Mexico]].

==Setting==
The Sierra Madre del Sur pine-oak forests occupy an area of {{convert|61,200|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, within the states of [[Michoacán]], [[Guerrero]], and [[Oaxaca]].

The pine-oak forests occupy the higher slopes of the Sierra Madre del Sur range, which runs east and west parallel to Mexico's southern Pacific Coast. The forests are surrounded by [[tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry forests]] at lower elevations; the [[Jalisco dry forests]] to the west; the [[Balsas dry forests]] to the north, in the basin of the [[Balsas River]], and the [[Southern Pacific dry forests]] to the south and east along the Pacific coast.

==Flora==
The chief plant communities are oak forests, cloud forests, pine-oak forests, and fir forests. The plant communities vary with elevation and rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/nt0309 "Sierra Madre del Sur pine-oak forests" WWF. Accessed 26 April 2105]&lt;/ref&gt;

The oak forests occur between 1900 and 2500 metres elevation (6,200-8,200 feet). ''[[Quercus magnoliifolia]]'' and ''[[Quercus castanea]]'' are the predominant tree species, with individuals of ''[[Pinus montezumae]]''. [[Orchid]]s and [[bromeliad]]s grow as [[epiphyte]]s.

Cloud forests grow at 2300 metres (7,500 feet). Predominant trees are ''[[Abies guatemalensis]], [[Quercus uxoris]], [[Pinus ayacahuite]]'', and ''[[Cupressus lusitanica]]''.

Pine-oak forests grow at 2400–2500 metres (7,900-8,200 feet). Predominant trees are ''Quercus magnoliifolia, Q. castanea, [[Quercus obtusata|Q. obtusata]], [[Pinus herrerai]], [[Pinus pseudostrobus|P. pseudostrobus]], [[Pinus pringlei|P. pringlei]], P. ayacahuite, [[Pinus rzedowskii|P. rzedowskii]],'' and ''[[Arbutus xalapensis]]''.

Fir forests grow above 3,000 metres (9,800 feet).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9976">'''Siltation''' or '''siltification''' is the [[water pollution|pollution of water]] by particulate [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] [[Clastic rock|clastic]] material, with a particle size dominated by [[silt]] or [[clay]]. It refers both to the increased concentration of suspended sediments, and to the increased accumulation (temporary or permanent) of fine sediments on bottoms where they are undesirable. Siltation is most often caused by [[soil erosion]] or sediment spill.

Sometimes siltation is called ''sediment pollution'', although that is an undesirable term since it is ambiguous, and can also be used to refer to a chemical contamination of sediments accumulated on the bottom, or pollutants bound to sediment particles. Siltation is the preferred term for being unambigiuous, even if not entirely stringent since it also includes other particle sizes than silt.

==Causes==
[[File:Dumping of faecal sludge into the river.jpg|thumb|250px|Siltation caused by [[septage|fecal sludge]] collected from pit latrines and dumped into a river at the Korogocho slum in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]].]]
[[File:Nrborderborderentrythreecolorsmay05-1-.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Siltation caused by [[Sewage sludge|raw sewage sludge]] and [[industrial waste]] in the [[New River (California)|New River]] as it passes from [[Mexicali]] to [[Calexico, California]].]]
[[File:Jacuecanga Angra dos Reis Rio de Janeiro Brazil Brasfels.JPG|thumb|Siltation caused by sewage sludge from [[shipyard]] – [[Rio de Janeiro]].]]

The origin of the increased sediment transport into an area may be erosion on land, or activities in the water.

In rural areas the erosion source is typically soil degradation due to intensive or inadequate agricultural practices, leading to [[soil erosion]], especially in fine-grained soils such as [[loess]]. The result will be an increased amount of silt and clay in the water bodies that drain the area. In urban areas the erosion source is typically construction activities, since this involves clearing the original land-covering vegetation and temporarily creating something akin to an urban desert from which fines are easily washed out during rainstorms.

In water the main pollution source is sediment spill from [[dredging]], from the transportation of dredged material on barges, and the deposition of dredged material in or near water. Such deposition may be made to get rid of unwanted material, such as the [[offshore dumping]] of material dredged from harbours and navigation channels. The deposition may also have as purpose to build up the coastline, [[artificial island]]s, or for [[beach replenishment]].

[[Climate change]] also affect siltation rates.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important cause of siltation is the [[septage]] and other [[sewage sludge]]s that are discharged from households or business establishments with no [[septic tank]]s or [[wastewater treatment facility|wastewater treatment]] facilities to bodies of water.

==Vulnerabilities==
[[File:Siltation or Sedimentation.jpg|thumb|Siltation of a waterway]]
[[File:muddy USGS.jpg|thumb|right|Silted river polluted by sediment.]]
While the [[sediment]] in [[sediment transport|transport]] is in [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]], it acts as a pollutant for those who require clean water. This includes uses such as for cooling or in industrial processes, and it includes aquatic life that are sensitive to suspended material in the water. While [[nekton]] have been found to avoid spill plumes in the water (e.g. the environmental monitoring project during the building of the [[Øresund Bridge]]), filtering [[benthic]] organisms have no way of escape. Among the most sensitive organisms are [[coral]] polyps. Generally speaking, hard bottom communities and mussel banks (including oysters) are more sensitive to siltation than sand and mud bottoms. Unlike in the sea, in a stream the plume will cover the entire channel, except possibly for backwaters, which is why fish will also be directly affected in most cases.

Siltation can also affect navigation channels, or irrigation channels. It refers to the undesired accumulation of sediments in channels intended for vessels, or for distributing water.

==Measurement and monitoring==
[[File:SediMeter sensor.jpg|thumb|A sensor for measuring siltation ''in situ''.]]
One may distinguish between measurements at the source, during transport, and within the affected area. Source measurements of erosion may be very difficult, since the lost material may be a fraction of a millimeter per year. Therefore, the approach taken is typically to measure the sediment in transport in the stream, by measuring the sediment concentration and multiplying that with the [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]]; for example, 50&amp;nbsp;mg/L times 30 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s gives 1.5&amp;nbsp;kg/s.

Also sediment spill is better measured in transport than at the source. The sediment transport in open water is estimated by measuring the [[turbidity]], correlating turbidity to sediment concentration (using a regression developed from water samples that are filtered, dried, and weighed), multiplying the concentration with the discharge as above, and integrating over the entire plume. To distinguish the spill contribution, the background turbidity is subtracted from the spill plume turbidity. Since the spill plume in open water varies in space and time, an integration over the entire plume is required, and repeated many times to get acceptably low uncertainty in the results. These measurements are made close to the source, in the order of a few hundred meters.

Anything beyond a work area buffer zone for sediment spill is considered the potential impact area. In the open sea the impact of concern is almost exclusively with the [[sessility (zoology)|sessile]] bottom communities, since empirical data show that fish effectively avoid the impacted area. The siltation chiefly affects the bottom community in two ways: The suspended sediment may interfere with the food gathering of filtering organisms, and the sediment accumulation on the bottom may bury organisms to the point that they starve or even die. Only if the concentration is extreme will it decrease the light level sufficiently for impacting primary productivity. An accumulation of as little as 1&amp;nbsp;mm may kill coral polyps.

While the effect of the siltation on the biota (once the harm is already done) can be studied by repeated inspection of selected test plots, the magnitude of the siltation process in the impact area may be measured directly by monitoring in real time. Parameters to measure are sediment accumulation, turbidity at the level of the filtering biota, and optionally incident light.&lt;ref&gt;Siltation Monitoring Plan excerpt, retrieved 2010-07-11, http://lindorm.com/beaches/sedmon2.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Siltation of the magnitude that it affects shipping can also be monitored by repeated [[bathymetry|bathymetric surveys]].

==Mitigation==
[[File:Key Biscayne Crandon Park beach.jpg|thumb|Resuspension of fines from a replenished beach causing siltation offshore]]
In rural areas the first line of defense is to maintain land cover and prevent soil erosion in the first place. The second line of defense is to trap the material before it reaches the stream network (known as [[sediment control]]). In urban areas the defense is to keep land uncovered for as short a time as possible during construction, and to use silt screens to prevent the sediment from getting released in water bodies. During dredging the spill can be minimized but not eliminated completely through the way the dredger is designed and operated. If the material is deposited on land, efficient sedimentation basins can be constructed. If it is dumped in relatively deep water there will be a significant spill during dumping, but not thereafter, and the spill that does arise will have minimal impact if there are only fine-sediment bottoms nearby.

One of the most difficult conflicts of interest to resolve, as regards siltation mitigation, is perhaps [[beach nourishment]]. When sediments are placed on or near beaches in order to replenish an eroding beach, any fines in the material will continue to be washed out for as long as the sand is being reworked. Given that all replenished beaches are eroding (or else they would not need replenishment), they will contribute to nearshore siltation almost for as long as it takes to erode away what was added, albeit with somewhat decreasing intensity over time. Since this leakage is detrimental to coral reefs, the practice leads to a direct conflict between the public interest of saving beaches, and preserving any nearshore coral reefs. To minimize the conflict, beach replenishment should only be done with sand not containing any silt or clay fractions. In practice the sand is often taken from offshore [[borrow area|borrowing areas]], and since the proportion of fines in sediments typically increases in the offshore direction, the deposited sand will inevitably contain a significant percentage of siltation-contributing fines.

It is desirable to minimize the siltation of irrigation channels by hydrologic design, the objective being not to create zones with falling sediment transport capacity, as that is conducive to sedimentation. Once sedimentation has occurred, in irrigation or navigation channels, dredging is often the only remedy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6011">'''Starspots''' are stellar [[phenomena]], so-named by analogy with [[sunspot]]s. 
Spots actually at the size of sunspots would be very hard to detect on other stars because they are too small to cause detectable fluctuations in brightness. 
The commonly observed starspots are in general much larger than those on the [[Sun]]: up to about 30% of the stellar surface may be covered, corresponding to starspots 100 times larger than those on the Sun.

==Detection and measurements ==
To detect and measure the extent of starspots one uses several types of methods.
*For rapidly rotating stars – [[Doppler imaging]] and [[Zeeman-Doppler imaging]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cameron|Cameron]]&lt;/ref&gt;
:With the Zeeman-Doppler imaging technique the direction of the [[magnetic field]] on stars can be determined since spectral lines are split according to the [[Zeeman effect]], revealing the direction  and magnitude of the field.
*For slowly rotating stars – Line Depth Ratio (LDR).
:Here one measures two different spectral lines, one sensitive to temperature and one which is not. Since starspots have a lower temperature than their surroundings the temperature-sensitive line changes its depth. From the difference between these two lines the temperature and size of the spot can be calculated, with a temperature accuracy of 10K.
*For [[Binary star#Eclipsing binaries|eclipsing binary stars]] – [[Eclipse mapping]] produces images and maps of spots on both stars.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cameron|Cameron]] [http://star-www.st-and.ac.uk/~acc4/coolpages/movies.html Eclipse movies] show spots on two imaged binaries&lt;/ref&gt;
*For stars with transiting [[extrasolar planets]] – Light curve variations.&lt;ref name="Sanchis-OjedaWinn2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanchis-Ojeda|first1=Roberto|last2=Winn|first2=Joshua N.|last3=Marcy|first3=Geoffrey W.|last4=Howard|first4=Andrew W.|last5=Isaacson|first5=Howard|last6=Johnson|first6=John Asher|last7=Torres|first7=Guillermo|last8=Albrecht|first8=Simon|last9=Campante|first9=Tiago L.|last10=Chaplin|first10=William J.|last11=Davies|first11=Guy R.|last12=Lund|first12=Mikkel N.|last13=Carter|first13=Joshua A.|last14=Dawson|first14=Rebekah I.|last15=Buchhave|first15=Lars A.|last16=Everett|first16=Mark E.|last17=Fischer|first17=Debra A.|last18=Geary|first18=John C.|last19=Gilliland|first19=Ronald L.|last20=Horch|first20=Elliott P.|last21=Howell|first21=Steve B.|last22=Latham|first22=David W.|display-authors=3|title=Kepler-63b: A Giant Planet in a Polar Orbit Around a Young Sun-like Star|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=775|issue=1|year=2013|pages=54|issn=0004-637X|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/775/1/54 |arxiv=1307.8128v2|bibcode = 2013ApJ...775...54S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand section|date=August 2008}}&lt;!-- include more methods, for example from Berdyugina: Photometry, Polarimetry, Interferometry,   Microlensing --&gt;

==Temperature==
Observed starspots have a temperature which is in general 500–2000 [[kelvin]]s cooler than the stellar [[photosphere]]. This temperature difference could give rise to a brightness variation up to 0.6 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitudes]] between the spot and the surrounding surface.
There also seems to be a relation between the spot temperature and the temperature for the stellar photosphere, indicating that starspots behave similarly for different types of stars (observed in [[Stellar classification#Class G|G-K dwarfs]])

==Lifetimes==
The lifetime for a starspot depends on its size. 
*For small spots the lifetime is proportional to their size, similar to spots on the Sun.&lt;ref name="B53"&gt;[[#Berdyugina|Berdyugina]] [http://solarphysics.livingreviews.org/Articles/lrsp-2005-8/articlesu22.html#x30-270005.3 5.3 Lifetimes]&lt;/ref&gt;
*For large spots the sizes depend on the [[differential rotation]] of the star, but there are some indications that large spots which give rise to light variations can survive for many years even in stars with differential rotation.&lt;ref name="B53"/&gt;

==Activity cycles==
The distribution of starspots across the stellar surface varies analogous to the solar case, but differs for different types of stars, e.g., depending on whether the star is a [[binary star|binary]] or not. The same type of activity cycles that are found for the Sun can be seen for other stars, corresponding to the solar (2 times) 11-year cycle.  Some stars have longer cycles, possibly analogous to the [[Maunder Minimum|Maunder minima]] for the Sun.

===Flip-flop cycles===
Another activity cycle is the so-called flip-flop cycle, which implies that the activity on either hemisphere shifts from one side to the other. The same phenomena can be seen on the Sun, with periods of 3.8 and 3.65 years for the northern and southern hemispheres. 
Flip-flop phenomena are observed for both binary [[RS Canum Venaticorum variable|RS CVn]] stars and single stars although the extent of the cycles are different between binary and singular stars.

'''Tanner Moor''' is one of the largest [[moorland]]s in [[Austria]] with a surface area of 120 hectares.  Tanner Moor is a [[Natura 2000]] ecologically protected area located on a high granite plateau in the [[Freistadt (district)|Freistadt district]], Mühlviertel, [[Upper Austria]] at an average elevation of 900 m.

The moorland is watered exclusively by rain and is almost completely covered with [[Pine|pine trees]].  There are gaps, however, where typical moorland plants such as [[Bog-rosemary]], [[Cotton-grass]] and the [[Ericaceae]], for example [[Vaccinium|upland berries (Vaccinium)]] and [[Calluna|heather (Calluna)]], flourish.  The central area of the moorland has never been used economically, but some of the areas around the edges were planted in [[spruce]] in the Twentieth  Century.  A small dam created Rubener pond was which formerly used in lumbering, but is now just for swimming and fishing.  It is a high [[tannin]] pond.  A six kilometer long trail leads through the moorland, over bridges and past bogs to highlands of [[Mountain Pine|mountain pine (Pinus mugo)]], whence the entire moor can be viewed.

[[File:Singing Bird Box by Bontems.JPG|right|thumb|French [[singing bird box]] with a case made out of tortoiseshell.]]'''Tortoiseshell''' or '''tortoise shell''' is a material produced from the shells of the larger species of [[tortoise]] and [[turtle]], mainly the [[hawksbill sea turtle]], which is an endangered species largely because of its exploitation for the material. The large size, fine colour and unusual form of the hawksbill's [[scute]]s make it especially suitable. The distinctive patterning is referred to in names such as the [[tortoiseshell cat]], several [[List of guinea pig breeds|breeds of guinea pig]], and the common names of several species of the butterfly genera ''[[Nymphalis]]'' and ''[[Aglais]]'', and some other uses.

==Uses==
Tortoiseshell was widely used from ancient times in the West and in Asia, until the trade was banned in the 1970s. It was used, normally in thin slices or pieces, in the manufacture of a wide variety of items such as [[comb]]s, small boxes and frames and inlays in furniture (known as [[Boulle Work]] carried out by [[André-Charles Boulle]]) and other items, frames for spectacles, [[guitar pick]]s and [[knitting needle]]s.  Despite being expensive, tortoiseshell was attractive to manufacturers and consumers because of its beautiful mottled appearance, its durability, and its organic warmth against the skin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/science/04/10/japan.turtles/ Tortoiseshell ban threatens Japanese tradition], CNN website&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial processing involved separating the layers of the scutes from the animal's [[carapace]] by heating, softening the plates by boiling them in salt water and flattening them under a press. Two pieces could be fused by use of a hot iron, but like the earlier stages, great care had to be taken not to lose the colour. Finishing and polishing was done by various techniques mainly in Europe or in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Transactions, 344-346&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peola"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lupano |first1=Guglielmo |last2=Peola |first2=Paolo |date=1915 |title=Corso di Scienze Naturali a uso delle Scuole Complementari |trans-title=A Course of Natural Sciences for the Complementary Institutes |language=Italian |publisher=G.B. Paravia |page=71 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Craftsmen in various Asian countries have also perfected this art.

==Availability==
In 1973, the trade of tortoiseshell worldwide was banned under [[CITES]] (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cites.org/eng/prog/HBT/bg/multi_agreement1.shtml Multi-lateral agreements for conservation of hawksbill turtles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040110073153/http://www.cites.org/eng/prog/HBT/bg/multi_agreement1.shtml |date=2004-01-10 }}, CITES website&lt;/ref&gt;  The material was already often imitated in stained [[horn (anatomy)|horn]],&lt;ref&gt;Transactions, 341, 345&lt;/ref&gt; [[plastic]] like [[cellulose acetate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lim |first1=XiaoZhi |title=These Cultural Treasures Are Made of Plastic.

The synthetic [[Delrin]] has been used especially for guitar picks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guitarbench.com/2008/10/03/tortoiseshell-picks-feature-article/ |title=Tortoiseshell picks.

[[Brand]]s of synthetic substitutes for tortoiseshell include '''Tortoloid''' and '''Tor-tis'''.

==History==
Tortoiseshell has been used since ancient times, and the ancient Greek [[chelys]] or [[lyre]] often used a whole shell to form its body. Inlaid [[wikt:veneer|veneers]] of tortoiseshell were popular with wealthy ancient Romans for furniture, especially couches for dining, and for small items.&lt;ref&gt;Transactions, 344&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'', probably a work of the 1st century AD, distinguishes between shell from different species, with that regarded as the best probably the hawksbill.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, 205&lt;/ref&gt;

[[André Charles Boulle]] (1642-1732), [[cabinetmaker]] to [[Louis XIV of France]] introduced or perfected [[marquetry]] combining thin inlays of tortoiseshell backed with metal, with woods and metal, a style still called after him.  Small luxury objects such as [[snuff-box]]es were decorated in [[piqué work]], inlays of precious metals and jewels into tortoiseshell (or other materials).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/461476/pique-work |title=pique work (metalwork) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopes of capturing a large store of tortoiseshell led to the [[Ngatik massacre]] by Australian "beachcombers" of up to 50 men of [[Sapwuahfik]] in [[Micronesia]] in July 1837.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4474">A '''vircator''' (VIRtual CAthode oscillaTOR) is a  [[microwave]] generator that is capable of generating brief pulses of tunable, narrow band microwaves at very high power levels. Its application is mainly in the area of electronic warfare, by way of interfering with electronic equipment such as radars or radio equipment.

[[Image:VIRCATOR.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Vircator schematic]]

A typical vircator is built inside an [[vacuum|evacuated]] [[resonant cavity]] or [[waveguide]]. An electrode, a [[cold cathode]], at one end injects an intense [[electron beam]], such as from a [[Marx generator]] or a [[flux compression generator]], optionally with a suitable [[pulse forming network]], e.g. a [[Pulse forming network#blumlein|Blumlein]]. The pulse has magnitude in the range of hundred or more kilovolts and duration of about 50-150 nanoseconds. The electrons are attracted to a thin [[anode]], such as an aluminized [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]] or a [[stainless steel]] mesh, that is connected to the grounded waveguide body. The unit is surrounded by a [[magnet]]. Due to the intensity of the electron beam, many electrons pass through the anode into the region beyond it, forming a virtual [[cathode]]. The electron beam must be so intense as to exceed the [[space charge|space charge limiting current]] in that region, causing oscillations that generate microwaves. The frequency, efficiency and other characteristics of the emitted beam depend on the precise physical configuration and operating parameters. 

A coaxial design exists where the cathode forms an outer ring surrounding the anode cylinder, with the virtual cathode forming along the cylinder's axis. Such design can be directly integrated with a [[waveguide]].

The frequencies are usually in the region of 0.5-1.5, 2-6, 3, or 5-18 GHz. Other frequencies are also possible. Lower frequencies are usable for jamming communications, higher frequencies can be harnessed for their destructive effects on electronics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/military/portable-ebomb-to-be-tested Portable E-Bomb to Be Tested - IEEE Spectrum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vircators have been used as  [[electromagnetic pulse]]  generators and for generating [[X-ray]]s{{cn|reason=This may well be correct, but none of the references mention x-ray generation.|date=February 2011}}. Power levels on the  order of 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; watts are possible.

A design successor of a vircator is a [[reditron]], which has higher efficiency and narrower bandwidth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1Nn9sAJRZfwC&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=vircator&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q=vircator&amp;f=false | title = Pulsed High-Power Microwave (HPM) Tubes and Related Technology | isbn = 9780941375962 | author1 = Company | first1 = Diane Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==

The massive short pulse of high voltage causes the cathode to emit an intense burst of electrons by the [[field electron emission]] mechanism. The electrons are attracted to the anode. A large proportion of the electrons passes through the anode and forms a cloud behind it, forming the virtual cathode. However, the electrons are still attracted by the anode (and repulsed by each other), so they change direction and fly back towards the anode, only to pass through again and be repulsed by the cathode and attracted towards the anode. The rapidly accelerating and decelerating electrons, as they oscillate back and forth between the real and virtual cathode through the mesh anode at microwave frequencies, then produce electromagnetic radiation.

'''William Lewis Maury''' (1813 – November 27, 1878) was born in Virginia, the son of William Grymes Maury and Ann Hoomes Woolfolk, and became a midshipman in 1829. His career as a midshipman and lieutenant was marked by his service in the [[United States Exploring Expedition]].

He was an American explorer and naval officer who served in the [[United States Navy]] for over 32 years, then resigned to take an officer's commission in the [[Confederate States Navy]]. Wm Maury assisted [[Charles Wilkes]]' [[United States Exploring Expedition|exploration]] of the Pacific Ocean and served as a lieutenant in [[Matthew C. Perry]]'s 1854 [[Perry Expedition|naval mission]] to Japan.

==Legacy==
As a member of Wilkes' expedition, the Maury name was applied to a discovered feature of [[Puget Sound]], [[Maury Island]]. In the 20th century, an ice-filled [[bay]] east of [[Cape Lewis]], [[Antarctica]], [[Maury Bay]], was named after this explorer.

==Career==

William L. Maury served in the [[United States Naval Observatory]], U. S. Navy under his cousin, superintendent [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]], in charting the seas, cartography, and in recording astronomical observations.

In the famed [[The United States Exploring Expedition]] then Lieutenant W. L. Maury served under [[Charles Wilkes]] from 1838-1842. He served on the ships ''Vincennes''; joined the ''Peacock'' at Orange Bay, and the ''Porpoise'' at Callao.

It was during the Exploring Expedition’s survey of [[Puget Sound]] that Commodore Wilkes named [[Maury Island]] after William Lewis Maury. Maury continued in Navy service serving on the Navy Efficiency Board. In 1860 he served as a member of the Japanese Treaty Commission.

When war came he served in the Confederate States Navy. He was initially assigned to a coast defense battery at Sewell’s Point, Virginia. His talent for coastline defense was recognized early on and he was reassigned to the Confederate Torpedo Service. Serving first at Wilmington Station and Charlotte, North Carolina, he was soon transferred to Charleston Station. Later, as Commander of the ship, C.S.S. Georgia, a commerce raider, he captured and sank several ships carrying war materials while letting others with commerce not for war go free.
