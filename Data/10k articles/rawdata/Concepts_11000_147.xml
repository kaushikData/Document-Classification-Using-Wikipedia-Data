The '''1989 Tiananmen Square protests''', commonly known in [[mainland China]] as the '''June Fourth Incident''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: {{lang|zh|六四事件}}, ''liùsì shìjiàn''), were student-led [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] in [[Beijing]] (the capital of the [[People's Republic of China]]) in 1989. More broadly, it refers to the popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests during that period, sometimes called the''' '89 Democracy Movement''' (Chinese: {{lang|zh|八九民运}}, ''bājiǔ mínyùn''). The protests were forcibly suppressed after [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Premier]] [[Li Peng]] declared [[martial law]]. In what became known in the West as the '''Tiananmen Square Massacre''', [[People's Liberation Army at Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|troops with automatic rifles and tanks fired at the demonstrators]] trying to block the military's advance towards [[Tiananmen Square]]. The number of civilian deaths has been estimated variously from 180 to 10,454.&lt;ref name=10,000&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Hong Kong Free Press|title=Declassified: Chinese official said at least 10,000 civilians died in 1989 Tiananmen massacre, documents show|date=21 December 2017|last=Cheng|first=Kris|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/12/21/declassified-chinese-official-said-least-10000-civilians-died-1989-tiananmen-massacre-documents-show/|access-date=22 December 2017}} Political chief of 38th Army Li Zhiyun and US Government documents, respectively&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Wong, ''Red China Blues'', Random House 1997, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;

Set against a backdrop of rapid economic development and social changes in [[History of the People's Republic of China (1976–89)|post-Mao Zedong China]], the protests reflected anxieties about the country's future in the popular consciousness and among the political elite. The [[Chinese economic reform|reforms of the 1980s]] had led to a nascent [[market economy]] which benefitted some people, but seriously disaffected others and the one-party political system also faced a challenge of legitimacy. Common grievances at the time included [[inflation]], limited preparedness of graduates for the new economy and restrictions on political participation. The students called for [[democracy]], greater accountability, [[freedom of the press]] and [[freedom of speech]], though they were loosely organized and their goals varied.&lt;ref name="nathan"&gt;{{cite web|first=Andrew J. |last=Nathan |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20010101faessay4257-p0/andrew-j-nathan/the-tiananmen-papers.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040706113745/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20010101faessay4257-p0/andrew-j-nathan/the-tiananmen-papers.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 6, 2004 |title=The Tiananmen Papers |work=[[Foreign Affairs]] |date=January–February 2001 |accessdate=November 3, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB16/documents/index.html Tiananmen Square, 1989: ''The Declassified History'']; George Washington University&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of the protests, about 1 million people assembled in the Square.&lt;ref name="zhao171"/&gt;

As the protests developed, the authorities veered back and forth between conciliatory and hardline tactics, exposing deep divisions within the party leadership.&lt;ref name="Saich"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=T-hxw0-d05gC&amp;pg=PA121 Anthony Saich, ''The People's Movement: Perspective on Spring 1989''] M.E.

University of Michigan Press. {{ISBN|978-0-472-08451-7}}. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, the suppression temporarily halted the policies of liberalization in the 1980s. Considered a watershed event, the protests also set the limits on political expression in China well into the 21st century. Its memory is widely associated with questioning the legitimacy of Communist Party rule and remains one of the most sensitive and most widely censored political topics in [[mainland China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.resetdoc.org/story/00000001371 |title="The Consequences of Tiananmen", Andrew J.

In the Chinese language, the incident is most commonly known as the June Fourth Incident. Events named by date in Chinese are conventionally named by the number of the month and the date, followed by the type of event. Thus, the common Chinese name for the crackdown on the 1989 massacre is June Fourth Incident (Chinese: {{lang|zh|六四事件}}, ''liùsì shìjiàn''), literally Six Four Incident ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|六}}}} means six, {{lang|zh|{{linktext|四}}}} means four, {{lang|zh|{{linktext|事件}}}} means incident). The nomenclature of the former is consistent with the customary names of the other two great protests that occurred in Tiananmen Square: the [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919 and the [[Tiananmen Incident|April Fifth Movement]] of 1976. June Fourth refers to the day on which the People's Liberation Army cleared Tiananmen Square of protesters, although actual operations began on the evening of 4 June. Names such as June Fourth Movement (Chinese: {{lang|zh|六四运动}}, ''liù-sì yùndòng'') and '89 Democracy Movement (Chinese: {{lang|zh|八九民运}}, ''bā-jiǔ mínyùn'') are used to describe the event in its entirety.

Outside mainland China, and among circles critical of the crackdown within mainland China, it is commonly referred to in Chinese as June Fourth Massacre (Chinese: {{lang|zh|六四屠杀}}, ''liù-sì túshā'') and June Fourth Crackdown (Chinese: {{lang|zh|六四镇压}}, ''liù-sì zhènyā''). To bypass [[internet censorship in China]], which uniformly considers all the above-mentioned names too 'Sensitive' for search engines and public forums, alternative names have sprung up to describe the events on the Internet, such as May&amp;nbsp;35th, VIIV ([[Roman numerals]] for 6 and 4) and Eight Squared (i.e. 8&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 64).&lt;ref name="TheAge"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.theage.com.au/world/china-tightens-information-controls-for-tiananmen-anniversary-20090604-bvxf.html |title = China tightens information controls for Tiananmen anniversary |agency = Agence France-Presse |date=June 4, 2009 |work=The Age |location=Australia |accessdate=November 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[government of the People's Republic of China]] have used numerous names for the event since 1989, gradually reducing the intensity of terminology applied.&lt;ref name="vog"&gt;{{cite book |last = Vogel |first = Ezra F. |title = Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China |year = 2011 |publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-05544-5 |page = 634 |id =   }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the events were unfolding, it was labelled a "counterrevolutionary riot", which was later changed to simply "riot", followed by "political storm" and finally the leadership settled on the more neutralized phrase "political turmoil between the Spring and Summer of 1989", which it uses to this day.&lt;ref name="vog"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/editorial/the-day-china-trampled-on-freedom/2009/05/29/1243456737644.html |title = The day China trampled on freedom |date=May 30, 2009 |work=The Age |location=Australia |accessdate=November 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, the terms Tiananmen Square Massacre, Tiananmen Square Protests or Tiananmen Square Crackdown are often used to describe the series of events. However, much of the violence did not actually happen in Tiananmen, but outside the square in the city of Beijing near the [[Muxidi]] area.&lt;ref name="miles"/&gt; The term also gives a misleading impression that demonstrations only happened in Beijing, when in fact they occurred in many cities throughout China.&lt;ref name="miles"/&gt; (Examples include [[Chengdu]] from the account of Louisa Lim's ''[[The People's Republic of Amnesia: Tiananmen Revisited|The People's Republic of Amnesia]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = People's Republic of Amnesia|last = Lim|first = Louisa|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2015|isbn = 978-0190227913|location = |page = 183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{History of the People's Republic of China}}
The [[Cultural Revolution]] ended with chairman [[Mao Zedong]]'s death in 1976. The movement, spearheaded by Mao, caused severe damage to the country's economic and social fabric. The country was mired in poverty as economic production slowed or came to a halt. Political ideology was paramount in the lives of ordinary people as well as the inner workings of the Communist Party itself. At the [[Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee|Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee]] in December 1978, [[Deng Xiaoping]] emerged as China's [[Paramount leader|''de facto'' leader]]. Deng launched a comprehensive [[Chinese economic reform|program to reform the Chinese economy]]. Within several years, the country's direction entirely changed. The focus on ideological purity was replaced by a full-on drive to achieve material prosperity.

To run his reform agenda, Deng promoted his allies to top government and party posts. [[Hu Yaobang]] was appointed the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Communist Party]] in February 1980, and [[Zhao Ziyang]] was named as [[Premier of the People's Republic of China]] in September.

=== Challenges with reform ===
The reforms aimed to decrease the role of the state in the economy and gradually introduced private forms of production in agriculture and industry. By 1981, roughly 73% of rural farms had de-collectivized and 80% of state owned enterprises were permitted to retain profits. Within a few years, production increased by leaps and bounds, and poverty was reduced substantially.

While the reforms were generally well received by the public, concerns grew over a series of social problems that the changes brought about, including [[Corruption in China|corruption]] and [[nepotism]] by elite party bureaucrats.&lt;ref&gt;Naughton, B. p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The state-mandated pricing system, in place since the 1950s, had long kept prices stable at low levels. The initial reforms created a two-tier system where some prices were fixed while others were allowed to fluctuate. In a market with chronic shortages, this allowed people with powerful connections to buy goods at low prices and sell at market prices.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;''Silenced Scream: a Visual History of the 1989 Tiananmen Protests''. Donna Rouviere Anderson, Forrest Anderson. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the money supply had expanded too fast. At least a third of factories were unprofitable. The government tightened the money supply in 1988, leaving much of the economy without loans.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Following the 1988 [[Beidaihe]] meeting, the party leadership under Deng agreed to a transition to a market-based pricing system.&lt;ref name="Dingxin Zhao 2001. p. 127"&gt;Dingxin Zhao.

Vol. 40 (24), December 9, 1988; p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; News of the relaxation of price controls triggered waves of cash withdrawals, buying and hoarding all over China.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; The government panicked and rescinded the price reforms in less than two weeks, but its impact was pronounced for much longer. Inflation soared. Official indices report that the [[Consumer Price Index]] increased 30% in Beijing between 1987 and 1988, leading to panic among salaried workers that they could no longer afford staple goods.&lt;ref name=vog600&gt;Vogel, E. 600–01&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in the new market economy, unprofitable [[state-owned enterprise]]s were pressured to cut costs. This threatened a vast proportion of the population which relied on the "[[iron rice bowl]]", i.e. a host of social benefits such as job security, medical care and subsidized housing.&lt;ref name=vog600/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Hui, Thomas Huters ed.

=== Social disenfranchisement and legitimacy crisis ===
Reformist leaders envisioned in 1978 that intellectuals would play a leading role in guiding the country through reforms, but this did not happen as planned.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the opening of new universities and increased enrollment,&lt;ref name="Dingxin Zhao 2001. pp.82"&gt;Zhao, D. p. 82. (University enrollment increased from 625,319 in 1977 to 2,065,923 in 1988)&lt;/ref&gt; the state-directed education system did not produce enough graduates to meet increased market demand in the areas of agriculture, light industry, services, and foreign investment.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; The job market was especially limited for students specializing in social sciences and the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, private companies no longer needed to accept students assigned to them by the state, and many high-paying jobs were offered on the basis of [[nepotism]] and favoritism.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Gaining a good state-assigned placement meant navigating a highly inefficient bureaucracy that gave power to officials who had little expertise in their area of jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=vog600/&gt; Facing a dismal job market and limited chances of going abroad, intellectuals and students had a greater vested interest in political issues. Small study groups, such as the "Democracy Salon" and the "Lawn Salon" (''Caodi Shalong''), began appearing on Beijing university campuses.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao D. p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; These organizations motivated the students to get involved politically.&lt;ref name="Dingxin Zhao 2001. p. 127"/&gt;

At the same time, the party's nominally socialist ideology faced a legitimacy crisis as it gradually adopted capitalist practices.&lt;ref name="Wang, H. p. 57"&gt;Wang, H. p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Private enterprise gave rise to profiteers who took advantage of lax regulations, and who often flaunted their wealth in front of those who were less well off.&lt;ref name=vog600/&gt; Popular discontent was brewing over unfair wealth distribution. Greed, not skill, appeared to be the most crucial factor of success. There was widespread public disillusionment over the country's future. People wanted change, yet the power to define 'the correct path' continued to rest solely in the hands of the unelected government.&lt;ref name="Wang, H. p. 57"/&gt;

The comprehensive and wide-ranging reforms created political differences over the pace of [[marketization]] and the control over the ideology that came with it, opening a deep chasm within the central leadership. The reformers ("the right", led by [[Hu Yaobang]]) favoured political liberalization and a plurality of ideas as a channel to voice popular discontent, and pressed for further reforms. The conservatives ("the left", led by [[Chen Yun]]) said that the reforms had gone too far, and advocated a return to greater state control to ensure social stability and to better align with the party's socialist ideology. Both sides needed the backing of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping to carry out important policy decisions.&lt;ref name=ghp&gt;{{cite web|title=The Gate of Heavenly Peace|url=http://tsquare.tv/film/transcript.html|publisher=Long Bow Group Inc. in collaboration with ITVS|year=1995|accessdate=January 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1986 student demonstrations ===
{{Main|1986 Chinese Student Demonstrations}}
In mid-1986, astrophysics professor [[Fang Lizhi]], who had returned from a position at [[Princeton University]], began a personal tour around universities in China, speaking about liberty, human rights, and [[separation of powers]]. Fang was part of a wider undercurrent within the elite intellectual community that thought China's poverty and underdevelopment and the disaster of the Cultural Revolution were a direct result of the authoritarian political system and the rigid command economy.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. pp. 64, 215&lt;/ref&gt; The view that political reform was the only answer to China's on-going problems gained widespread appeal among students, as Fang's recorded speeches became widely circulated all over the country.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Standoff at Tiananmen (2009). Eddie Cheng. p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Deng Xiaoping warned that Fang was blindly worshipping Western lifestyles, capitalism, and multi-party systems, while undermining China's socialist ideology, traditional values, and the party's leadership.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Inspired by Fang and other 'people-power' movements around the world, in December 1986, student demonstrators staged protests against the slow pace of reform. The issues were wide-ranging, and included demands for economic liberalization, democracy, and rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Hui, Thomas Huters ed. ''China's New Order: Society, Politics, and Economy in Transition''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-674-02111-8}}. pp. 56–7.&lt;/ref&gt; While the protests were initially contained in [[Hefei]], where Fang lived, they quickly spread to Shanghai, Beijing and other major cities. This alarmed the central leadership, who accused the students of instigating Cultural Revolution-style turmoil.

General secretary [[Hu Yaobang]] was blamed for taking a soft attitude and mishandling the protests, thus undermining social stability. He was denounced thoroughly by conservatives. Hu was forced to resign as general secretary on 16 January 1987. Then the party began the "Anti-[[bourgeois liberalization]] Campaign", taking aim at Hu, political liberalization and Western-inspired ideas in general.&lt;ref&gt;Spence, Jonathan D. (1999). ''The Search for Modern China''. p. 685. New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt; The Campaign stopped student protests and tightened the political environment, but Hu remained popular among progressives in the party, intellectuals, and students.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death of Hu Yaobang ===
When [[Hu Yaobang]] suddenly died of a heart attack on 15 April 1989, students reacted strongly, most of them believing that his death was related to his forced resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Calhoun|first1=Craig|title=Revolution and repression in Tiananmen square|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/42467/1/Calhoun_Revolution_repression_Tianmen_1989.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hu's death provided the initial impetus for students to gather in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Pan, Philip P. (2008). ''Out of Mao's Shadow: The Struggle for the Soul of a New China''. Simon &amp; Schuster. p. 274. {{ISBN|978-1-4165-3705-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In university campuses, many posters appeared eulogizing Hu, calling for a revival of Hu's legacy. Within days, most posters were writing about broader political issues, such as freedom of the press, democracy, and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Small spontaneous gatherings to mourn Hu began on 15 April around [[Monument to the People's Heroes]] at [[Tiananmen Square]]. On the same day, many students at [[Peking University]] (PKU) and [[Tsinghua University]] erected shrines, and joined the gathering in Tiananmen Square in a piecemeal fashion. Organized student gatherings also began on a small scale in [[Xi'an]] and Shanghai on 16 April. On 17 April, students at the [[China University of Political Science and Law]] (CUPL) made a large [[wreath]] to commemorate Hu Yaobang. Its laying-party was on 17 April and a larger-than-expected crowd assembled.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; At 5 pm, 500 CUPL students reached the eastern gate of the [[Great Hall of the People]], near Tiananmen Square, to mourn Hu. The gathering featured speakers from various backgrounds giving public orations commemorating Hu and discussing social problems. However, it was soon deemed obstructive to the operation of the Great Hall, so police tried to persuade the students to disperse.

Starting on the night of 17 April, three thousand PKU students marched from the campus towards Tiananmen Square, and soon nearly a thousand students from Tsinghua joined. Upon arrival, they soon joined forces with those already gathered at the Square. As its size grew, the gathering gradually evolved into a protest, as students began to draft a list of pleas and suggestions (Seven Demands) for the government:
# Affirm Hu Yaobang's views on democracy and freedom as correct.
# Admit that the campaigns against [[Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign|spiritual pollution]] and bourgeois liberalization had been wrong.
# Publish information on the income of state leaders and their family members.
# Allow privately run newspapers and stop press censorship.
# Increase funding for education and raise intellectuals' pay.
# End restrictions on demonstrations in Beijing.
# Provide objective coverage of students in official media.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=}}&lt;ref&gt;Zhao D. p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of 18 April, students remained in the Square. Some gathered around the Monument to the People's Heroes singing patriotic songs and listening to impromptu speeches by student organizers, others gathered at the Great Hall. Meanwhile, a few thousand students gathered at [[Xinhua Gate]], the entrance to [[Zhongnanhai]], the seat of the party leadership, where they demanded dialogue with the leadership. Police restrained the students from entering the compound. Students then staged a [[sit-in]].

On 20 April, most students had been persuaded to leave Xinhua Gate. To disperse about 200 students that remained, police used batons; minor clashes were reported. Many students felt abused by the police, and rumours about police brutality spread quickly. This incident angered students on campus, where those who were not politically active decided to join the protests.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; Also on this date, a group of workers calling themselves the [[Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation]] issued two handbills challenging the central leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Walder, Andrew W., and Gong Xiaoxia. "Workers in the Tiananmen Protests: The Politics of the Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation." ''Australian Journal of Chinese Affairs'', no. 29, January 1993. pp. 1–2. Full text of article available at http://www.tsquare.tv/links/Walder.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Hu's [[state funeral]] took place on 22 April. On the evening of 21 April, some 100,000 students marched on Tiananmen Square, ignoring orders from Beijing municipal authorities that the Square was to be closed off for the funeral. The funeral, which took place inside the Great Hall and attended by the leadership, was broadcast live to the students. General secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] delivered the eulogy. The funeral seemed rushed, and only lasted 40 minutes, as emotions ran high in the Square. Students wept.&lt;ref name=ghp/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. pp. 152–3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Li|first=Peng|title=Li Peng Diary: The Critical Moments|year=2010|publisher=Au Ya Publishing|location=Hong Kong|isbn=978-1-921815-00-3|chapter=21 April Entry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Security cordoned off the east entrance to the Great Hall, but several students pressed forward. Three of these students knelt on the steps of the Great Hall to present a petition and demanded to see Premier [[Li Peng]].&lt;ref name="Zhao153"&gt;Zhao, D. p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; However, no leaders emerged from the Great Hall, leaving the students disappointed and angry; some called for a class boycott.&lt;ref name="Zhao153"/&gt;

From 21 to 23 April 21, students began organizing under the banners of formal organizations. On 23 April, the [[Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation]] (also known as the Union) was formed. It elected CUPL student [[Zhou Yongjun]] as chair. [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]] and [[Wu'erkaixi]] also emerged as leaders. From this vantage point, the Union called for a general class boycott at all Beijing universities. Such an independent organization operating outside of party jurisdiction alarmed the leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 April, near dusk, serious rioting broke out in [[Changsha]] and [[Xi'an]]. In Xi'an, arson from rioters destroyed cars and houses, and looting occurred in shops near the city's Xihua Gate. In Changsha, 38 stores were ransacked by looters. Over 350 people were arrested in both cities. In Wuhan, university students organized protests against the provincial government. As the situation became more volatile nationally, Zhao Ziyang called numerous meetings of the [[Politburo Standing Committee]] (PSC). Zhao stressed three points: discourage students from further protests and ask them to go back to class, use all measures necessary to combat rioting, and open forms of dialogue with students at different levels of government.&lt;ref name="zzy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zhao |first=Ziyang |title=Prisoner of the State: The Secret Journal of Premier Zhao Ziyang |year=2009 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=978-1-4391-4938-6 |chapter=The origins of the 1989 Student Movement}}&lt;/ref&gt; Premier Li Peng called upon Zhao to condemn protestors and recognize the need to take more serious action. Zhao dismissed Li's views. Despite calls for him to remain in Beijing, Zhao left for a scheduled state visit to [[North Korea]] on 23 April.&lt;ref name="liu"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Liu |first=Alan P.L. |title=Aspects of Beijing's Crisis Management: The Tiananmen Square Demonstration |journal=Asian Survey |date=May 1990 |volume=30 |series=5 |pages=505–521 |jstor=2644842 |doi=10.1525/as.1990.30.5.01p0385c |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhao's departure to North Korea left Li Peng as the acting executive authority in Beijing. On 24 April, Li Peng and the PSC met with Beijing Party Secretary [[Li Ximing]] and mayor [[Chen Xitong]] to gauge the situation at the Square. The municipal officials wanted a quick resolution to the crisis and framed the protests as a conspiracy to overthrow China's political system and major party leaders, including Deng Xiaoping. In Zhao's absence, the PSC agreed that firm action against protesters must be taken.&lt;ref name="liu"/&gt; On the morning of 25 April, President [[Yang Shangkun]] and Premier [[Li Peng]] met with Deng at the latter's residence. Deng endorsed a hardline stance and said an appropriate 'warning' must be disseminated via mass media to curb further demonstrations.&lt;ref name=vog603&gt;Vogel, E. pp. 603–6&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting firmly established the first official evaluation of the protests from the leadership, and highlighted Deng's having 'final say' on important issues. Li Peng subsequently ordered Deng's views to be drafted as a communique and issued to all high-level Communist Party officials in an effort to mobilize the party apparatus against protesters.

On 26 April, the party's official newspaper ''[[People's Daily]]'' issued a front-page editorial titled "[[April 26 Editorial|It is necessary to take a clear-cut stand against disturbances]]." The language in the editorial effectively branded the student movement to be an anti-party, anti-government revolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2005-02/23/content_2609426.htm |archive-url=http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20060424034105/http://news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2005-02/23/content_2609426.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 24, 2006 |title=Full text of the April 26 Editorial |agency=Xinhua News Agency |date=February 23, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The article enraged students, who interpreted it as a direct indictment on the protests and its cause. The editorial backfired. Instead of scaring students into submission, it squarely antagonized the students against the government.&lt;ref name=zhd155&gt;Zhao, D. p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; The polarizing nature of the editorial made it a major sticking point for the remainder of the protests.&lt;ref name=vog603/&gt; The editorial evoked memories of the Cultural Revolution, using similar rhetoric as that used during the 1976 [[Tiananmen Incident]]—an event that was initially branded an anti-government conspiracy but was later rehabilitated as "patriotic" under Deng's leadership.&lt;ref name=ghp/&gt;

=== 27 April demonstrations ===
{{main|April 27 demonstrations|l1=27 April demonstrations}}
[[File:Han Dongfang.png|thumb|170px|[[Han Dongfang]], founder of the [[Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation]]]]
Organized by the Union on 27 April, some 50,000–100,000 students from all Beijing universities marched through the streets of the capital to Tiananmen Square, breaking through lines set up by police, and receiving widespread public support along the way, particularly from factory workers.&lt;ref name=ghp/&gt; The student leaders, eager to show the patriotic nature of the movement, also toned down anti-Communist slogans, choosing to present a message of "anti-corruption, anti-cronyism", but "pro-party".&lt;ref name="zhd155"/&gt; In a twist of irony, student factions who genuinely called for the overthrow of the Communist Party gained traction as the result of an 26 April editorial.&lt;ref name="zhd155"/&gt;

The stunning success of the March forced the government into making concessions and meeting with student representatives. On 29 April, [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] spokesman [[Yuan Mu]] ([[:zh:袁木|袁木]]) met with appointed representatives of government-sanctioned student associations. While the talks discussed a wide range of issues, including the editorial, the Xinhua Gate incident and freedom of the press, they achieved few substantive results. Independent student leaders such as Wuer Kaixi refused to attend.&lt;ref name="zhd157"&gt;Zhao, D. p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government's tone grew increasingly conciliatory as Zhao Ziyang returned from [[Pyongyang]] on 30 April and resumed his executive authority. In Zhao's view, the hardliner approach was not working, and concession was the only alternative.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Zhao asked that the press be opened to report the movement positively, and delivered two sympathetic speeches on 3–4 May. In the speeches, Zhao said that the student's concerns about corruption were legitimate, and that the student movement was patriotic in nature.&lt;ref name="Vogel, E. p.608"&gt;Vogel, E. p. 608.&lt;/ref&gt; The speeches essentially negated the message presented by 26 April Editorial. While some 100,000 students marched on the streets of Beijing on 4 May to commemorate the [[May Fourth Movement]] and repeat demands from earlier marches, many students were satisfied with the government's concessions. On 4 May, all Beijing universities except PKU and BNU announced the end of the class boycott. Subsequently, the majority of students began to lose interest in the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preparing for dialogue ===
{{main|Student and Government Dialogue during the 1989 Student Movement}}
The leadership was divided on how to respond to the movement as early as mid-April. After Zhao Ziyang's return from North Korea, factional tensions, between the progressive camp and the conservative camp, intensified. Those who supported continued dialogue and a soft approach with students rallied behind Zhao Ziyang, while hardliner conservatives who opposed the movement rallied behind Premier Li Peng. Zhao and Li clashed at a PSC meeting on 1 May. Li maintained that the need for stability overrides all else, while Zhao said that the party should show support for increased democracy and transparency. Zhao pushed the case for further dialogue.&lt;ref name="Vogel, E. p.608"/&gt;

In preparation for dialogue, the Autonomous Student Union elected representatives to a formal Dialogue Delegation. However, the Union leaders were reluctant to let the Delegation unilaterally take control of the movement.&lt;ref name=zhao161&gt;Zhao, D. p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; Facing internal discord and declining engagement from the student body at large, a group of charismatic leaders, including Wang Dan and Wu'erkaixi, called for more radical measures to regain momentum. They believed that the government's 'dialogue' was merely a way to trick the students into submission. They began mobilizing students for a hunger strike on 11 May.&lt;ref name="zhao161" /&gt;

=== Hunger strikes begin ===
{{main|The Students' Hunger Strike of the 1989 Tiananmen Protests}}
[[File:蒲志強19890510.jpg|thumb|A photo of [[Pu Zhiqiang]], a student protester at Tiananmen, taken on 10 May 1989]]
Students began the hunger strike on 13 May, two days before the highly publicized [[state visit]] by Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. Knowing that the welcoming ceremony for Gorbachev was scheduled to be held on the Square, student leaders wanted to use the hunger strike there to force the government into meeting their demands. Moreover, the hunger strike gained widespread sympathy from the population at large and earned the student movement the moral high ground that it sought.&lt;ref name="vogel612"&gt;Vogel, E. pp. 612–4.&lt;/ref&gt; By the afternoon of 13 May, some 300,000 were gathered at the Square.&lt;ref name="Zhao, D. p.167"&gt;Zhao, D. p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by the course of events in Beijing, protests and strikes began at universities in other cities, with many students traveling to Beijing to join the demonstration. Generally, the demonstration at Tiananmen Square was well ordered, with daily marches of students from various Beijing-area colleges displaying their solidarity with the class boycott and with the demands of the protest. The students sang ''[[The Internationale]]'', the world socialist anthem, on their way to, and at, the square.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amnesty International]] (August 30, 1989). ''Preliminary Findings on Killings of Unarmed Civilians, Arbitrary Arrests and Summary Executions Since June 3, 1989''. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Afraid that the movement would spin out of control, Deng Xiaoping asked that the Square be cleared for Gorbachev's visit. Executing Deng's request, Zhao again used a soft approach, and directed his subordinates to coordinate negotiations with students immediately.&lt;ref name="vogel612" /&gt; Zhao believed he could appeal to the students' patriotism, and that the students understood signs of internal turmoil during the Sino-Soviet summit would embarrass the nation (not just the government). On the morning of 13 May, [[Yan Mingfu]], head of the Communist Party's [[United Front (China)|United Front]], called an emergency meeting, gathering prominent student leaders and intellectuals, including [[Liu Xiaobo]], [[Chen Ziming]] and [[Wang Juntao]].&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Yan said the government was prepared to hold immediate dialogue with student representatives, but that the Tiananmen welcoming ceremony for Gorbachev would be cancelled whether the students withdraw or not—in effect removing the bargaining power the students thought they possessed. The announcement sent the student leadership into disarray.&lt;ref name="Zhao, D. p.165"&gt;Zhao, D. p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mikhail Gorbachev visit ===
{{main|1989 Sino-Soviet Summit}}
Press restrictions were loosened significantly during early to mid-May. State media began broadcasting footage sympathetic to protesters and the movement, including the hunger strikers. On 14 May, intellectuals led by [[Dai Qing]] gained permission from [[Hu Qili]] to bypass government censorship and air the progressive views of the nation's intellectuals on ''[[Guangming Daily (China)|Guangming Daily]]''. The intellectuals then issued an urgent appeal for the students to leave the Square in an attempt to deescalate the conflict.&lt;ref name="Zhao, D. p.167" /&gt; However, many students believed that the intellectuals were speaking for the government, and refused to move. That evening, formal negotiations took place between government representatives led by Yan Mingfu and student representatives led by [[Shen Tong]] and Xiang Xiaoji. Yan affirmed the patriotic nature of the student movement and pleaded for the students to withdraw from the Square.&lt;ref name="Zhao, D. p.165"/&gt; While Yan's apparent sincerity for compromise satisfied some students, the meeting grew increasingly chaotic as competing student factions relayed uncoordinated and incoherent demands to the leadership. Shortly after student leaders learned that the event had not been broadcast nationally as initially promised by the government, the meeting fell apart.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; Yan then personally went to the Square to appeal to the students, even offering himself to be held hostage.&lt;ref name=ghp/&gt; Yan also took the student's pleas to Li Peng the next day, asking Li to consider formally retracting the 26 April Editorial and rebranding the movement as "patriotic and democratic"; Li refused.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Peng. Diary entry for 15 May.&lt;/ref&gt;

The students remained in the Square during the Gorbachev visit; his welcoming ceremony was held at the airport. The Sino-Soviet summit, the first of its kind in [[Sino-Soviet split|some 30 years]], marked the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations, and was seen as a breakthrough of tremendous historical significance for China's leaders. However, its smooth proceedings was derailed by the student movement; according to one scholar, this embarrassed the leadership on the global stage, and drove many moderates in government onto a more 'hardliner' path.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, D. p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; The summit between Deng and Gorbachev took place at the [[Great Hall of the People]] amid the backdrop of commotion and protest in the Square.&lt;ref name=vogel612/&gt; When Gorbachev met with Zhao on 16 May, Zhao told him, and by extension the international press, that Deng was still the 'paramount authority' in China. Deng felt that this remark was Zhao's attempt to shift blame for mishandling the movement to him. The statement marked a decisive split between the country's two most senior leaders.&lt;ref name=vogel612/&gt;

=== Gathering momentum ===
The hunger strike galvanized support for the students and aroused sympathy across the country. Around a million Beijing residents from all walks of life demonstrated in solidarity from 17–18 May. These included PLA personnel, police officers, and lower party officials.&lt;ref name="zhao171"&gt;Zhao, D. p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Many grassroots Party and [[Communist Youth League|Youth League]] organizations, as well as government-sponsored labour unions, encouraged their membership to demonstrate.&lt;ref name=zhao171/&gt; In addition, several of China's non-Communist parties sent a letter to Li Peng in support of students. The [[Red Cross Society of China|Chinese Red Cross]] issued a special notice and sent in a large number of personnel to provide medical services to the hunger strikers on the Square. After the departure of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], many foreign journalists remained in the Chinese capital to cover the protests, giving the movement international spotlight. Western governments urged Beijing to exercise restraint.

The movement, on the wane at the end of April, now regained significant momentum. By 17 May, as students from across the country poured into the capital to join the movement, protests of varying sizes were occurring in some 400 Chinese cities.{{sfn|Thomas|2006}} Students demonstrated at provincial party headquarters in Fujian, Hubei, and Xinjiang. Without a clearly articulated official position from the Beijing leadership, local authorities did not know how to respond. Because the demonstrations now included a wide array of social groups, each carrying its own set of grievances, it became increasingly unclear with whom the government should negotiate, and what the demands were. The government, still split on how to deal with the movement, saw its authority and legitimacy gradually erode as the hunger strikers took the limelight and gained widespread sympathy.&lt;ref name=zhao171/&gt; These combined circumstances put immense pressure on the authorities to act, and martial law was discussed as a viable response.&lt;ref name=zhao181&gt;Zhao, D. p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation seemed intractable, so the weight of taking decisive action fell on paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. On 17 May, a PSC meeting was called at Deng's residence.&lt;ref name="li517"&gt;{{cite book |last=Li |first=Peng |title = The Critical Moment – Li Peng Diaries |year = 2010 |publisher = Au Ya Publishing |location = Hong Kong |isbn =978-1-921815-00-3 |section = Entry for 17 May}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the meeting, Zhao Ziyang's concessions-based strategy, which called for the retraction of the April 26 Editorial, was thoroughly criticized.&lt;ref name="tp20"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Nathan |first = Andrew |title = On the Tiananmen Papers |journal = Foreign Affairs |year = 2002 |volume = 80 |issue = 1 |pages = 2–48 |doi = 10.2307/20050041 |jstor = 20050041 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Li Peng and Deng asserted that by making a conciliatory speech on 4 May, Zhao exposed divisions within the top leadership and emboldened the students.&lt;ref name="tp20"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhao Ziyang.

''[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Pakistan Daily Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Deng then moved to declare [[martial law]] as a show of the government's no-tolerance stance.&lt;ref name="tp20"/&gt; To justify martial law, the demonstrators were described as tools of "[[bourgeois liberalism]]" advocates who were pulling the strings behind the scenes, as well as tools of elements within the party who wished to further their personal ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, J.

On the evening of 17 May, the PSC met at Zhongnanhai to finalize plans for martial law. At the meeting, Zhao announced that he was ready to "take leave", citing he could not bring himself to carry out martial law.&lt;ref name="tp22" /&gt; The elders in attendance at the meeting, [[Bo Yibo]] and Yang Shangkun, urged the PSC to follow Deng's orders.&lt;ref name="tp22"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Nathan |first = Andrew |title = On the Tiananmen Papers |journal = Foreign Affairs |year = 2002 |volume = 80 |issue=1 |pages = 2–48 |doi = 10.2307/20050041 |jstor = 20050041 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zhao did not consider the inconclusive PSC vote to have legally binding implications on martial law;&lt;ref&gt;Ignatius, Adi.

Li Peng said the government's main concern was sending hunger strikers to hospital.

In the early morning of 19 May, Zhao Ziyang went to Tiananmen in what became his political [[swan song]] (final effort). He was accompanied by [[Wen Jiabao]]. Li Peng also went to the Square, but left shortly thereafter. At 4:50{{nbsp}}am Zhao made a speech with a bullhorn to a crowd of students, urging the students to end the hunger strike.&lt;ref name=adi&gt;Ignatius, Adi. "Preface".

Zhao's emotional speech was applauded by some students. It would be his last public appearance.&lt;ref name=adi/&gt;

On 19 May, the PSC met with military leaders and party elders. Deng presided over the meeting and said that martial law was the only option. At the meeting Deng declared that he was 'mistaken' in choosing Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang as his successors, and resolved to remove Zhao from his position as general secretary. Deng also vowed to deal resolutely with Zhao's supporters and begin propaganda work.

University students in Shanghai also took to the streets to commemorate the death of Hu Yaobang and protest against certain policies of the government. In many cases, these were supported by the universities' Party committees. [[Jiang Zemin]], then-Municipal Party Secretary, addressed the student protesters in a bandage and 'expressed his understanding' as he was a former student agitator before 1949. At the same time, he moved swiftly to send in police forces to control the streets and to purge Communist Party leaders who had supported the students.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

On April 19, the editors of the ''[[World Economic Herald]]'', a magazine close to reformists, decided to publish a commemorative section on Hu. Inside was an article by [[Yan Jiaqi]], which commented favourably on the Beijing student protests, and called for a reassessment of Hu's 1987 purge. Sensing the conservative political trends in Beijing, [[Jiang Zemin]] demanded that the article be censored. Many newspapers were printed with a blank page.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Wright, "The Political Fortunes of the World Economic Herald", ''Australian Journal of Chinese Affairs'', nr 23, pp 121–132 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Jiang then suspended Qin Benli. His decisive action earned accolades from party elders, who praised Jiang's loyalty.

In Hong Kong on 27 May, over 300,000 people gathered at [[Happy Valley Racecourse]] for a gathering called Democratic songs dedicated for China (Chinese: {{lang|zh|民主歌聲獻中華}}). Many Hong Kong celebrities sang songs and expressed their support for the students in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=dragonmui |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVjUGz_bHnU&amp;list=PLF7C9846E075808EB |title=Playlist of "Democratic Songs for China" on YouTube |publisher=YouTube.com |date= |accessdate=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, a procession of 1.5&amp;nbsp;million people, one fourth of Hong Kong's population, led by [[Martin Lee]], [[Szeto Wah]] and other organization leaders, paraded through [[Hong Kong Island]]. Across the world, especially where ethnic-Chinese lived, people gathered and protested. Many governments, including those of the United States and Japan, issued travel warnings to China.

=== Martial law ===
The Chinese government declared [[martial law]] on 20 May and [[People's Liberation Army at Tiananmen Square protests of 1989#Mobilization|mobilized at least 30 divisions]] from five of the country's [[PLA Military Region|seven military regions]].{{sfn|Wu|2009|pp=30–31}} At least 14 of PLA's 24 army corps contributed troops.{{sfn|Wu|2009|pp=30–31}} As many as 250,000 troops were eventually sent to the capital, some arriving by air and others by rail.&lt;ref name="WRH03 PLA Troop Estimate"&gt;(Chinese) [http://blog.boxun.com/hero/201004/wurenhua/10_1.shtml Wu Renhua, "六四北京戒严部队的数量和番号" 《1989天安门事件二十周年祭》之三]. Retrieved June 29, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Guangzhou's civil aviation authorities put regular airline tickets on hold to prepare for transporting military units.&lt;ref name=tb80/&gt;

The army's entry into the city was blocked at its suburbs by throngs of protesters. Tens of thousands of demonstrators surrounded military vehicles, preventing them from either advancing or retreating. Protesters lectured soldiers and appealed to them to join their cause; they also provided soldiers with food, water, and shelter. Seeing no way forward, the authorities ordered the army to withdraw on 24 May. All government forces retreated to bases outside the city.{{sfn|Thomas|2006}}&lt;ref name="George Washington University"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB16/documents/09-01.htm |title = Secretary of State's Morning Summary for 3&amp;nbsp;June&amp;nbsp;1989 |publisher=George Washington University |accessdate = August 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Army's withdrawal was initially seen as 'turning the tide' in favour of protesters, in reality mobilization took place across the country for a final assault.&lt;ref name="tb80"&gt;{{cite book |last = Brook |first = Timothy |authorlink = Timothy Brook (historian) |title = Quelling the People: The Military Suppression of the Beijing Democracy Movement |year=1998 |publisher = Stanford University Press |location = Stanford, California |isbn = 978-0-8047-3638-1 |pages = 80–82 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, internal divisions intensified within the student movement itself. By late May, the students became increasingly disorganized with no clear leadership or unified course of action. Moreover, Tiananmen Square was overcrowded and facing serious hygiene problems. [[Hou Dejian]] suggested an open election of the student leadership to speak for the movement, but was met with opposition.&lt;ref name=ghp/&gt; Meanwhile, [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]] moderated his position, ostensibly sensing the impending military action and consequences, and advocated for a temporary withdrawal from Tiananmen Square to re-group on campus, but this was opposed by 'hardliner' student factions who wanted to hold the Square. The increasing internal friction would lead to struggles for control of the loudspeakers in the middle of the square in a series of 'mini-coups': whoever controlled the loudspeakers was 'in charge' of the movement. Some students would wait at the train station to greet arrivals of students from other parts of the country in an attempt to enlist factional support.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;{{cite web |title = The Gate of Heavenly Peace |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7ou2-Kv4UA |publisher=ITVN, The Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation |accessdate = January 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Student groups began accusing each other of ulterior motives such as collusion with the government and trying to gain personal fame from the movement. Some students even tried to oust Chai Ling and Feng Congde from their leadership positions in an attempted kidnapping, an action Chai called a "well-organized and pre-meditated plot."&lt;ref name="ghp" /&gt;

On 1 June, [[Li Peng]] issued a report titled "On the True Nature of the Turmoil", which was circulated to every member of the Politburo.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=330}} The report aimed to persuade the Politburo of the necessity and legality of clearing Tiananmen Square by referring to the protestors as terrorists and counterrevolutionaries.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=330}} The report stated that turmoil was continuing to grow, the students had no plans to leave, and they were gaining popular support.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=335}} Further justification for martial law came in the form of a report submitted by the [[Ministry of State Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of State Security]] (MSS) to the party leadership, which emphasized the infiltration of [[bourgeois liberalism]] into China and the negative effect that the West, particularly the United States, had on the students.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=338}} The MSS expressed its belief that American forces had intervened in the student movement in hopes of overthrowing the Communist Party.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=343}} The report created a sense of urgency within the party, and provided justification for military action.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=338}} In conjunction with the plan to clear the Square by force, the Politburo received word from the martial law troops headquarters stating that the troops were ready to help stabilize the capital, and that they understood the necessity and legality of martial law to overcome the turmoil. {{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=349}}

On 2 June, the movement saw an increase in action and protest, solidifying the CPC's decision that it was time to act. Protests broke out as newspapers published articles that called for the students to leave Tiananmen Square and end the movement. Many of the students in the Square were not willing to leave and were outraged by the articles.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=353}} They were also outraged by ''Beijing Daily's 1'' June article "Tiananmen, I Cry for You", written by a fellow student who had become disillusioned with the movement, as he thought it was chaotic and disorganized.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=353}} In response to the articles, thousands of students lined the streets of Beijing to protest against leaving the Square.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=362}}

The order did not explicitly contain a shoot-to-kill directive but permission to "use any means" was understood by some units as authorization to use lethal force.

At 8:30{{nbsp}}pm, army helicopters appeared above the Square and students called for campuses to send reinforcements. At 10{{nbsp}}pm, the founding ceremony of the Tiananmen Democracy University was held as scheduled at the base of the [[Goddess of Democracy]]. At 10:16{{nbsp}}pm, the loudspeakers controlled by the government warned that troops may take "any measures" to enforce martial law. By 10:30{{nbsp}}pm, news of bloodshed to the west and south of the city began trickling into the Square, often told by witnesses drenched in blood. At midnight, the students' loudspeaker announced news that a student had been killed on West Chang'an Avenue, near the Military Museum and a somber mood settled on the Square. Li Lu, the deputy commander of the student headquarters, urged students to remain united in defending the Square through non-violent means. At 12:30{{nbsp}}am, [[Wu'erkaixi]] fainted after learning that a female student at Beijing Normal University, who had left campus with him earlier in the evening, had just been killed. Wuerkaixi was taken away by ambulance. By then, there were still 70,000–80,000 people in the Square.&lt;ref name="WRH Last Act1"&gt;(Chinese) [http://blog.boxun.com/hero/64/27_1.shtml Wu Renhua, "天安门事件的最后一幕"].

At about 12:15{{nbsp}}am, a [[flare]] lit up the sky and the first armored personnel vehicle appeared on the Square from the west. At 12:30{{nbsp}}am, two more APCs arrived from the South. The students threw chunks of concrete at the vehicles. One APC stalled, perhaps by metal poles jammed into its wheels, and the demonstrators covered it with gasoline-doused blankets and set it on fire. The intense heat forced out the three occupants, who were swarmed by demonstrators. The APCs had reportedly run over tents and many in the crowd wanted to beat the soldiers. But students formed a protective cordon and escorted the three men to the medic station by the History Museum on the east side of the Square.&lt;ref name="WRH Last Act1"/&gt;

Pressure mounted on the student leadership to abandon non-violence and retaliate against the killings. At one point, Chai Ling picked up the megaphone and called on fellow students to prepare to "defend themselves" against the "shameless government." However, she and Li Lu agreed to adhere to peaceful means and had the students' sticks, rocks and glass bottles confiscated.&lt;ref name="WRH Last Act2"&gt;(Chinese) [http://blog.boxun.com/hero/64/27_2.shtml Wu Renhua, "天安门事件的最后一幕"].

At about 1:30{{nbsp}}am, the vanguard of the 38th Army and paratroopers from the 15th Airborne Corps arrived at the north and south ends of the Square, respectively.&lt;ref name="WRH June 4"/&gt; They began to seal off the Square from reinforcements of students and residents, killing more demonstrators who were trying to enter the Square.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, June 2, 2009 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8057762.stm :Tiananmen killings: Were the media right?"]&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the 27th and 65th Armies poured out of the Great Hall of the People to the west and the 24th Army emerged from behind the History Museum to the east.&lt;ref name="WRH Last Act2"/&gt; The remaining students, numbering several thousand, were completely surrounded at the Monument of the People's Heroes in the center of the Square. At 2{{nbsp}}am, the troops fired shots over the heads of the students at the Monument.

At about 2:30{{nbsp}}am, several workers near the Monument emerged with a machine gun they had captured from the troops and vowed to take revenge. They were persuaded to give up the weapon by Hou Dejian. The workers also handed over an assault rifle without ammunition, which Liu Xiaobo smashed against the marble railings of the Monument.&lt;ref name="WRH Last Act3"&gt;(Chinese) [http://blog.boxun.com/hero/64/27_3.shtml Wu Renhua, "天安门事件的最后一幕"].

They rode in an ambulance to the northeast corner of the Square and spoke with Ji Xinguo, the political commissar of the 38th Army's 336th Regiment, who relayed the request to command headquarters, which agreed to grant safe passage for the students to the southeast. The commissar told Hou, "it would be a tremendous accomplishment, if you can persuade the students to leave the Square.&lt;ref name="WRH Last Act3"/&gt;

At 4{{nbsp}}am, the lights on the Square suddenly turned off, and the government's loudspeaker announced: "Clearance of the Square begins now. We agree with the students' request to clear the Square."&lt;ref name="WRH June 4"/&gt; The students sang ''[[The Internationale]]'' and braced for a last stand.&lt;ref name="WRH Last Act3"/&gt; Hou returned and informed student leaders of his agreement with the troops. At 4:30{{nbsp}}am, the lights relit and the troops began to advance on the Monument from all sides. At about 4:32{{nbsp}}am, Hou Dejian took the student's loudspeaker and recounted his meeting with the military. Many students, who learned of the talks for the first time, reacted angrily and accused him of cowardice.&lt;ref name="WRH Last Act4"&gt;(Chinese) [http://blog.boxun.com/hero/64/27_4.shtml Wu Renhua, "天安门事件的最后一幕"].

The soldiers initially stopped about 10 meters from the students. The first row of troops took aim with machine guns in the prone position. Behind them soldiers [[Squatting position|squatted]] and stood with assault rifles. Mixed among them were anti-riot police with clubs. Further back were tanks and APCs.&lt;ref name="WRH Last Act4"/&gt; Feng Congde took to the loudspeaker and explained that there was no time left to hold a meeting. Instead, a voice vote would decide the collective action of the group. Although the "stays" were louder than "gos", Feng said the "gos" had prevailed.&lt;ref name="Interview with John Pomfret"/&gt; Just at that time, at about 4:40{{nbsp}}am, a squad of soldiers in camouflaged uniform charged up the Monument and shot out the students' loudspeaker.&lt;ref name="WRH Last Act4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.dwnews.com/news/2013-06-02/59207710-4.html |title=Image of soldiers storming the Monument |publisher=History.dwnews.com |date=2013-06-02 |accessdate=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other troops beat and kicked dozens of students at the Monument, seizing and smashing their cameras and recording equipment.

Some of the students and professors persuaded others still sitting on the lower tiers of the Monument to get up and leave, while soldiers beat them with clubs and gunbutts and prodded them with bayonets.

Just past 6{{nbsp}}am on June 4, as a convoy of students who had vacated the Square were walking westward in the bicycle lane along Chang'an Avenue back to campus, three tanks pursued them from the Square, firing tear gas and one drove through the crowd, killing 11 students, injuring scores.&lt;ref&gt;(Chinese) [http://www.secretchina.com/news/10/06/13/354351.html Wu Renhua, "六部口坦克追轧学生撤退队伍事件"].

Later in the morning, thousands of civilians tried to re-enter the Square from the northeast on East Chang'an Avenue, which was blocked by rows of infantry. Many in the crowd were parents of the demonstrators who had been in the Square. As the crowd approached the troops, an officer sounded a warning, and the troops opened fire.

=== 5 June ===
On 5 June, suppression of the protest was immortalized in Western media by the famous video footage and photographs of [[Tank Man|a lone man standing in front of a column of tanks]] driving out of Tiananmen Square. The iconic photo that would eventually make its way around the world was taken on 5 June on [[Chang'an Avenue]]. As the tank driver tried to go around him, the "Tank Man" moved into the tank's path. He continued to stand defiantly in front of the tanks for some time, then climbed up onto the turret of the lead tank to speak to the soldiers inside. After returning to his position in front of the tanks, the man was pulled aside by a group of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tankman/etc/transcript.html |title = FRONTLINE: The Tank Man transcript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By and large, the government regained control in the week following the military's seizure of the Square. A political purge followed in which officials responsible for organizing or condoning the protests were removed, and protest leaders jailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/04/world/asia/china-tiananmen-activists/index.html |title = China's Tiananmen activists: Where are they now? |first1 = Anjali |last1 = Tsui |first2 = Esther |last2 = Pang |publisher = CNN |access-date = 2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also protests in other countries, many adopting the use of black armbands as well.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The municipal government gained recognition from the top leadership in Beijing for averting a major upheaval.

In the interior cities of Xi'an, Wuhan, Nanjing and Chengdu, many students continued protests after 4 June, often erecting roadblocks. In Xi'an, students stopped workers from entering factories.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|pp=399, 404}} In Wuhan, students blocked the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge|Yangtze River Railway bridge]] and another 4,000 gathered at the railway station.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=400}} About one thousand students staged a railroad 'sit-in'. Rail traffic on the Beijing-Guangzhou and Wuhan-Dalian lines was interrupted. The students also urged employees of major state-owned enterprises to go on strike.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=405}} In Wuhan the situation was so tense that residents reportedly began a [[bank run]] and resorted to panic-buying.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=408}}

Similar scenes unfolded in Nanjing. On 7 June, hundreds of students staged a blockade at the [[Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge]] as well as the Zhongyangmen Railway Bridge. They were persuaded to evacuate without incident later that day, though returned the next day to occupy the main railway station and the bridges.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=409}}

The atmosphere in [[Chengdu]] was more violent. On the morning of 4 June, police forcibly broke up the student demonstration taking place in Chengdu's main square. The resulting violence killed eight people, and injured hundreds. The most brutal attacks occurred on 5 and 6 June. Witnesses estimate that 30 to 100 bodies were thrown onto a truck after a crowd broke into the Jinjiang Hotel.&lt;ref name="Chengdu violence NPR"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lim |first=Louisa |url=https://www.npr.org/2014/04/15/301433547/after-25-years-of-amnesia-remembering-a-forgotten-tiananmen |title=Louisa Lim, NPR |publisher=Npr.org |date=2014-04-15 |accessdate=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Amnesty International, at least 300 people were killed in Chengdu on 5 June.

== Death toll ==
The civilians killed in the city of Beijing, according to the city police, "included university professors, technical people, officials, workers, owners of small private enterprises, retired workers, high school students and grade school students, of whom the youngest was nine years old."{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=437}} The number of deaths and the extent of bloodshed in the Square itself have been in dispute since the events. As the Chinese authorities actively suppress discussion of the events as well as research of the subject, it is difficult to verify exact figures. As a result, large discrepancies exist among various casualty estimates.

=== Official figures ===
Official Chinese government announcements put the number of dead between zero and 300. At the State Council press conference on 6 June, spokesman Yuan Mu said that "preliminary tallies" by the government showed that about 300 civilians and soldiers died, including 23 students from universities in Beijing, along with a number of people he described as "ruffians".{{sfn|Oksenberg|Sullivan|Lambert|1990|p=364}} Yuan also said some 5,000 soldiers and police along with 2,000 civilians were wounded. On June 19, Beijing Party Secretary [[Li Ximing]] reported to the Politburo that the government's confirmed death toll was 241, including 218 civilians (of which 36 were students), 10 PLA soldiers and 13 People's Armed Police, along with 7,000 wounded.{{sfn|Zhang|2001|p=436}}&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tankman/cron/ Frontline – The Memory of Tiananmen 1989].

=== Declassified files ===
United States government files declassified in 2014 estimated there had been 10,454 deaths and 40,000 injured.

=== Other estimates ===
Other estimates of the death toll have been higher than the figures announced by the government. [[Nicholas D.

=== Identifying the dead ===
The [[Tiananmen Mothers]], a victims' advocacy group co-founded by [[Ding Zilin]] and Zhang Xianling, whose children were killed during the crackdown, have identified 202 victims {{as of|2011|August|lc=y}}. The group has worked painstakingly, in the face of government interference, to locate victims' families and collect information about the victims. Their tally has grown from 155 in 1999 to 202 in 2011. The list includes four individuals who committed suicide on or after 4 June, for reasons that related to their involvement in the demonstrations.&lt;ref name="TiananmenMothersList"&gt;(Chinese) [http://www.tiananmenmother.org/index_files/Page480.htm Tiananmen Mothers Victims of June Fourth Name List] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822222351/http://www.tiananmenmother.org/index_files/Page480.htm |date=August 22, 2016 }}.

He was unable to afford medical bills and hanged himself in August because of unbearable pain. Zou Bing (Victim No. 51), a 19-year-old student at the [[Beijing Broadcasting Institute]], hanged herself in September 1989 because of her inability to pass interrogation into her involvement in the protest. Qi Li, (Victim No. 162), a student at the [[Central Academy of Drama]], hanged himself to escape the pressure of post-protest investigation at his school. Wei Wumin (Victim No. 163), also a student at the Central Academy of Drama, who participated in the hunger strike, committed suicide by standing in front of an oncoming train.

Wu Renhua of the [[Chinese Alliance for Democracy]], an overseas group agitating for democratic reform in China, said that he was only able to verify and identify 15 military deaths. Wu asserts that if deaths from events unrelated to demonstrators were removed from the count, only seven deaths among military personnel may be counted as those "[[killed in action]]" by rioters.&lt;ref name="WRH-PLA casualty tabulation"/&gt;

=== Deaths in Tiananmen Square itself ===
[[File:Goddess_of_Democracy_at_UBC.jpg|thumb|200px|A replica of ''[[Goddess of Democracy]]'' outside of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada]]
On 19 June, Beijing Party Secretary Li Ximing delivered the results of the official enquiry. More than 7,000 were wounded or injured and two hundred forty one killed, including thirty-six students, ten soldiers and thirteen People's Armed Police during a riot in Chang'An Road.&lt;ref&gt;Che Muqi, "Beijing Turmoil.1990, Foreign Language Press&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese government officials have long asserted that no one died in the Square itself in the early morning hours of 4 June, during the 'hold-out' of the last batch of students in the south of the Square. Initially foreign media reports of a "massacre" on the Square were prevalent, though subsequently journalists have acknowledged that most of the deaths occurred outside of the Square in western Beijing. Several people who were situated around the square that night, including former Beijing bureau chief of ''The Washington Post'' [[Jay Mathews]]{{efn|Jay Mathews, former Beijing bureau chief for ''The Washington Post'' said that "as far as can be determined from the available evidence, no one died that night in Tiananmen Square". He goes on to conclude: {{quote|A few people may have been killed by random shooting on streets near the square, but all verified eyewitness accounts say that the students who remained in the square when troops arrived were allowed to leave peacefully. Hundreds of people, most of them workers and passersby, did die that night, but in a different place and under different circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/the_myth_of_tiananmen.php|author=Jay Mathews|work=Columbia Journalism Review|date=September–October 1998|title=The Myth of Tiananmen}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}}} and CBS correspondent [[Richard Roth (journalist)|Richard Roth]]{{efn|Richard Roth reported that he was held captive by troops in the Great Hall of the People on the west side of the Square on the night of 3 June and could hear but not see into the Square until dawn when they were driven through the Square. He heard a "volley of gunfire" to silence the students' loudspeakers. He added that there is no doubt that many people were killed in the area on the way to and around the Square, mostly in western Beijing, which the Chinese government denies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/there-was-no-tiananmen-square-massacre/ "There was no "Tiananmen Square Massacre"], CBS News.&lt;/ref&gt;}} reported that while they had heard sporadic gunfire, they could not find enough evidence to suggest that a massacre took place on the Square itself. Records by the Tiananmen Mothers suggest that three students died in the Square the night of the Army's push into the Square.&lt;ref name="NotForget"&gt;An English translation of the Tiananmen Mothers' Database – Note: contains incorrect English spellings of some victims' names. [https://archive.is/20130624215424/http://notforgetus.com/EN/Asia/China/Tiananmen "Not Forget Us"] Accessed June 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Democracy activist Wu Renhua asserted that the government's discussion of the issue was a [[red herring]] intended to absolve itself of responsibility and showcase its benevolence. Wu said that it was irrelevant whether the shooting occurred inside or outside of the Square itself, as it was still a reprehensible massacre of unarmed civilians.&lt;ref name="mrHu"&gt;Wu Renhua, ''Regarding the Clearing of the Square of June 4'' ([http://blog.boxun.com/hero/201005/wurenhua/3_1.shtml in Chinese]): "Really, whether the fully equipped army of troops massacred peaceful ordinary folks inside or outside the Square makes very little difference. It is not even worthwhile to have this discussion at all."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
=== Arrests and punishment ===
The authorities carried out mass arrests. Many workers were summarily tried and executed. In contrast, the students—many of whom came from relatively affluent backgrounds and were well-connected—received much lighter sentences. [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]], the student leader who topped the most wanted list, spent seven years in prison. Many of the students and university staff implicated were permanently politically stigmatized, some never to be employed again. Some student leaders such as [[Chai Ling]] and [[Wuer Kaixi]] were able to escape to the United States, the United Kingdom, France and other Western nations under [[Operation Yellowbird]] that was organized from Hong Kong, a British territory at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18141489.html|title=Article: Still on the wing; inside Operation Yellowbird, the daring plot to help dissidents escape.(special report: China)|newspaper=Newsweek|date=April 1996|last1=Liu|first1=Melinda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller protest actions continued in other cities for a few days. Some university staff and students who had witnessed the killings in Beijing organized or spurred commemorative events upon their return to school. At Shanghai's prestigious [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University|Jiaotong University]], for example, the party secretary organized a public commemoration event, with engineering students producing a large metal wreath.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

According to the [[Dui Hua Foundation]], citing a provincial government, 1,602 individuals were imprisoned for protest-related activities in the early 1989. {{as of|2012|May|}}, at least two remain incarcerated in Beijing and five others remain unaccounted for.&lt;ref name="Duihua"&gt;[http://duihua.org/wp/?page_id=5933 "Less Than a Dozen June Fourth Protesters Still in Prison"] ''[[Dui Hua Foundation]]'' May 31, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2014, it was reported that Miao Deshun was believed to be the last known prisoner incarcerated for their participation in the protests; he was last heard from a decade ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-27659475 |last = Harron |first = Celia |title = Miao Deshun: China's last Tiananmen prisoner? |newspaper=BBC News|accessdate= 23 September 2014 |date = 2014-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All are reported to be suffering from mental illness.&lt;ref name="Duihua" /&gt;

=== Leadership changes ===
{{main|Political purges during and after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests}}
The Party leadership expelled Zhao Ziyang from the [[Politburo Standing Committee]] (PSC). [[Hu Qili]], another PSC member who opposed the martial law but abstained from voting, was also removed from the committee. He was, however, able to retain his party membership, and after "changing his opinion", was reassigned as deputy minister in the Ministry for Machinery and Electronics Industry. Another reform-minded Chinese leader, [[Wan Li]], was also put under house arrest immediately after he stepped out of his plane at [[Beijing Capital International Airport|Beijing Capital Airport]] upon returning from his shortened trip abroad; the authorities declared his detention to be on health grounds. When Wan Li was released from his house arrest after he finally "changed his opinion" he, like [[Qiao Shi]], was transferred to a different position with equal rank but a mostly ceremonial role. Several Chinese ambassadors abroad claimed political asylum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4DC1430F93AA15755C0A96F948260 Beijing Orders Its Ambassadors Home for a Meeting], ''The New York Times'', June 29, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Post'', June 17, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jiang Zemin1.png|thumb|left|200px|[[Jiang Zemin]], the party secretary of Shanghai, where student protests were subdued largely without violence, was promoted to succeed [[Zhao Ziyang]] as the party [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] in 1989]]
[[Jiang Zemin]], then Party Secretary of Shanghai, was promoted to [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Communist Party]]. Jiang's decisive actions in Shanghai involving the ''World Economic Herald'' and his having prevented deadly violence in the city won him support from party elders in Beijing. Having put the new leadership team in place and recognising his weakened position, Deng Xiaoping himself also bowed out of the party leadership—at least officially—by resigning his last leadership position as Chairman of the [[Central Military Commission]] later that year. He kept a low profile until 1992. According to diplomatic cables de-classified by Canada, the Swiss ambassador informed Canadian diplomats in confidence that over several months following the massacre, "every member of the Politburo Standing Committee has approached him about transferring very significant amounts of money to Swiss bank accounts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Phillips |first=Tom |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/11372052/Fresh-details-of-savage-Tiananmen-massacre-emerge-in-embassy-cables.html |title=Fresh details of 'savage' Tiananmen massacre emerge in embassy cables – Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2015-01-27 |accessdate=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bao Tong]], Zhao Ziyang's aide, was the highest-ranking official to be formally charged with a crime in connection with 1989 demonstrations. He was convicted in 1992 of "revealing state secrets and counter-revolutionary propagandizing" and served seven years in prison. To purge sympathizers of Tiananmen demonstrators among the party's rank-and-file, the party leadership initiated a one-and-a-half-year-long rectification program to "deal strictly with those inside the party with serious tendencies toward bourgeois liberalization". Four million people were reportedly investigated for their role in the protests. More than 30,000 Communist officers were deployed to assess 'political reliability' of more than one million government officials.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, James (1997). ''The Legacy of Tiananmen: China in Disarray''. University of Michigan Press. {{ISBN|978-0-472-08451-7}}. pp. 27–30.&lt;/ref&gt; The authorities arrested tens if not hundreds of thousands of people across the country. Some were seized in broad daylight while they walked in the street; others were arrested at night. Many were jailed or sent to labor camps. They were often denied access to see their families and often put in cells so crowded that not everyone had space to sleep. Dissidents shared cells with murderers and rapists, and torture was not uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, James (1997). ''The Legacy of Tiananmen: China in Disarray''.

=== Media coverage ===
==== Chinese media ====
{{see also|People's Daily during the 1989 Student Movement}}
The suppression on June 4 marked the end of a period of relative press freedom in China and media workers—both foreign and domestic—faced heightened restrictions and punishment in the aftermath of the crackdown. State media reports in the immediate aftermath were sympathetic to the students. As a result, those responsible were all later removed from their posts. Two news anchors [[Xue Fei (host)|Xue Fei]] and [[Du Xian (news anchor)|Du Xian]], who reported this event on June 4 in the daily ''[[Xinwen Lianbo]]'' broadcast on [[China Central Television]] were fired because they displayed sad emotions. Wu Xiaoyong, the son of former foreign minister [[Wu Xueqian]] was removed from the English Program Department of [[Chinese Radio International]], ostensibly for his sympathies towards protesters. Editors and other staff at ''[[People's Daily]]'', including director [[Qian Liren]] and Editor-in-Chief Tan Wenrui, were also sacked because of reports in the paper which were sympathetic towards the protesters. Several editors were arrested.&lt;ref name="VOA"&gt;{{cite news |title=北京避谈1989年天安门屠杀纪念日 (Chinese) |url=https://www.voachinese.com/a/voa-china-internal-silence-june-4-anniversary/4423612.html |accessdate=8 June 2018 |publisher=Voice of America (China) |date=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the imposition of martial law, the Chinese government cut off the satellite transmissions of foreign broadcasters such as CNN and CBS.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=3366 Assignment:China – Tiananmen Square]'' for footage of the shutting down of CNN.&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcasters tried to defy these orders by reporting via telephone.

==== Obscure dissidents ====
Not all of the 21 most wanted are as well known as Chai Ling or Wang Dan. Others such Zhang Zhiqing have essentially disappeared. After his initial arrest in January 1991 and subsequent release, nothing further is known about his situation and where he lives now.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Zhang Zhiqing's role and reason for being listed on the list of 21 most wanted is generally unknown; this is the case for many others on the list such Wang Chaohua. Other dissidents that are not as well known to the public include Zhou Fengsuo and Wang Zhengyun. Zhou Fengsuo was a physics student at Tsinghua University and a member of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Students Autonomous Federation during the protests.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Fengsuo was turned in by his sister and arrested on June 13, 1989 in Xi'an.&lt;ref name="Cheng 2009 p276"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Standoff At Tiananmen|last=Cheng|first=Eddie|publisher=Sensys Corp|year=2009|isbn=|location=|page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He was imprisoned for one year before being released in 1990 due to international pressures, along with 97 other political prisoners.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Leaving China for the United States, he attended the University of Chicago.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/03/tiananmens-most-wanted/?mtrref=web.archive.org&amp;mtrref=web.archive.org|title=Tiananmen's Most Wanted|last=Jacobs|first=Andrew|date=June 3, 2014|work=Sinosphere, New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180415080207/https://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/03/tiananmens-most-wanted/?mtrref=web.archive.org&amp;mtrref=web.archive.org|archive-date=2018-04-15|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steady in his activist roots he co-founded Humanitarian China, an organization that promotes rule of law in China and also raises money for Chinese political prisoners.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Wang Zhengyun was a student of the [[Central University for Nationalities]] and was the only member of the [[Kucong|Kucon]] ethnicity minority group to be studying at a university.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Zhengyun was arrested on July 1989 and released two years later.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He was sent back to his village in the Yunnan countryside.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In December 1998, Wang was one of 19 dissidents, including Zhai Weimin, who staged a hunger strike to protest the oppression of [[Democracy Party of China|CDP]] members and other dissidents.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Ma Shaofang and Yang Tao are another pair of dissidents that lack public attention despite their constant activist efforts. Ma Shaofang was a student of the Beijing Film Academy during the protests and turned himself in on 13 June 1989.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cheng 2009 p276"/&gt; In October 1990 he was sentenced to three years in prison for counterrevolutionary incitement.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrichina.org/en/content/3747|title=Tiananmen's Most Wanted—Where Are They Now?|last=Mosher|first=Stacy|date=May 26, 2004|website=HRI China|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413071105/https://www.hrichina.org/en/content/3747|archive-date=2018-04-13|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1994, he participated with Wang Dan and other dissidents in a petition to the National People's Congress calling for a reassessment of 4 June.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; He has had issues in attempting to open a business and has had a series of short lived jobs ever since and is living in Shenzhen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/campaigns/china/scholars/t15/mashaofang.htm|title=Where Are Some of the "Most Wanted" Participants Today?|last=|first=|date=May 24, 2004|website=Human Rights Watch Asia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416181118/https://www.hrw.org/legacy/campaigns/china/scholars/t15/mashaofang.htm|archive-date=2018-04-16|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Yang Tao, who was at one time the head of Beijing University's Autonomous Student Federation, remains in China today.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/campaigns/china/scholars/t15/yangtao.htm|title=Where Are Some of the "Most Wanted" Participants Today?|last=|first=|date=May 24, 2005|website=Human Rights Watch Asia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416181529/https://www.hrw.org/legacy/campaigns/china/scholars/t15/yangtao.htm|archive-date=2018-04-16|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was initially charged as being an instigator of the counterrevolutionary rebellion and imprisoned for one year on 16 June 1989.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; In 1998, he wrote an open letter asking for the release of Wang Youcai.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; His continued efforts landed him in prison in 1999 after lobbying for the government to reverse the labeling of the protest as a "counterrevolutionary rebellion".&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; He was originally arrested on charges of "incitement to overthrow state political power."&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; However, he was indicted on amended charges of tax evasion on 23 December due to lack of evidence and on 5 January 2003 was sentenced to four years in prison.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt; He was released in May 2003.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; Yang too has had trouble earning a living.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

Among the student leaders, [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]] and [[Zhao Changqing]] were arrested. As a lesser figure in the demonstrations, Zhao was released after six months in prison. However, he was once again incarcerated for continuing to petition for political reform in China. Wang Dan was sent to prison, then allowed to emigrate to the United States in 1998 on the grounds of [[medical parole]]. He eventually received a PhD from Harvard University and went on to teach modern Chinese history at [[National Tsing Hua University]] in [[Hsinchu]], Taiwan. [[Wu'erkaixi]] fled to [[Taiwan]] and has since become a political commentator on Taiwanese national radio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/01_51/b3762058.htm Listening to China's Dissidents] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628204604/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/01_51/b3762058.htm |date=June 28, 2011 }}, ''Bloomberg BusinessWeek'', December 17, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chai Ling]] fled to France and then went on to the United States to study at Princeton and Harvard.

=== Domestic political developments ===
{{see|Political purges during and after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests}}
The protests led to a strengthened role for the state. In its aftermath, many of the freedoms introduced during the 1980s were rescinded, as the party returned to a conventional Leninist mold and re-established firm control over the press, publishing, and mass media. The protests were also a blow to the separation of powers model established by the 1982 Constitution and by convention, whereby the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] was a symbolic position ([[figurehead]]), and the real centres of power of the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary of the Communist Party]], the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier of the State Council]] and the [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] were [[Separation of powers|intended to be different people]], to prevent the excesses of Mao-style personal rule.

However, when President [[Yang Shangkun]] asserted his [[reserve powers]] with his post of [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] and openly split with general secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] over the use of force to side with Premier [[Li Peng]] and Central Military Commission chairman [[Deng Xiaoping]], official policy became inconsistent and incoherent, significantly impeding the exercise of power. In 1993, the positions of General Secretary, Central Military Commission Chairman and President were all consolidated into the same office, reverting to the previous Maoist distribution of power that had previously existed since 1972.

In 1989, neither the Chinese military nor the Beijing police had sufficient anti-riot gear, such as rubber bullets and tear gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/asiapcf/9906/02/tiananmen/MacKinnon/zhu.muzhi.html Chinese human rights official says the crackdown 'completely correct'] Rebecca MacKinnon, "Tiananmen Ten Years Later." CNN, June 2, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Tiananmen Square protests, riot police in Chinese cities were equipped with non-lethal equipment for riot control. The protests led to increased spending on internal security and expanded the role of the People's Armed Police in suppressing urban protests.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The aftermath of the protests saw the resurgence of conservative attitudes towards reform among policymakers, intended to slow the rapid changes that were said to have contributed to the causes of the protest.&lt;ref name="Goodman" /&gt; Deng Xiaoping, the "architect" of the reform policy, saw his influence significantly reduced following the protests, forcing him into making concessions with socialist hardliners.&lt;ref name="macfarquhar"&gt;''The Politics of China'' By Roderick MacFarquhar&lt;/ref&gt; In dismissing Zhao Ziyang, who shared Deng's vision for economic reform but disagreed with him over politics, Deng had lost the foremost champion of his own economic vision. Facing pressure from the conservative camp, Deng distanced himself from state affairs.&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt;

This slow pace of reform was met with stiff resistance from provincial governors and broke down completely in the early 1990s as a result of the dissolution of the Soviet Union and Deng's Southern Tour of 1992, designed by the ailing but influential leader as a means to reinstate his economic reform agenda.&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt; On the tour, Deng criticized the leftist hardliners that had gained power following the protests, and praised entrepreneurship and other market-driven policies. Initially ignored by Beijing, the Chinese Politburo eventually sided with Deng and economic reforms again gained prominence.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

=== Hong Kong ===
[[File:2009candlevigil1.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Candlelight vigil]] in Hong Kong in 2009 on 20th anniversary of the June 4th incident]]
In Hong Kong, the Tiananmen square protests led to fears that China would renege on its commitments under [[one country, two systems]] following the impending handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom in 1997. In response, Governor [[Chris Patten]] tried to expand the [[1994 Hong Kong electoral reform|franchise for the Legislative Council of Hong Kong]], which led to friction with Beijing. For many Hong Kongers, Tiananmen served as a turning point for when they lost trust in the Beijing government. The event, coupled with general uncertainty about the status of Hong Kong after the transfer of sovereignty, led to [[Waves of mass migrations from Hong Kong|a sizeable exodus of Hong Kongers]] to Western countries such as Canada and Australia prior to 1997.

There have been [[Memorials for the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|large candlelight vigils attended by tens of thousands in Hong Kong every year since 1989]] even after the transfer of power to China in 1997. The [[June 4th Museum]] closed in July 2016, after only two years in its location. The group that runs the museum, the [[Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China|Hong Kong Alliance]], has started to crowdfund money to open the museum in a new location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/11/asia/hong-kong-china-tiananmen-museum-closes/index.html |title = Hong Kong's Tiananmen Museum to close |last = Kam |first = Vivian |date=2016-07-11 |publisher = CNN |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170111005706/http://edition.cnn.com/2016/07/11/asia/hong-kong-china-tiananmen-museum-closes/ |archive-date = 2017-01-11 |dead-url = no |access-date = 2017-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact on China's national image ===
The Chinese government drew widespread condemnation for its suppression of the protests. In its immediate aftermath, China seemed to be becoming a [[pariah state]], increasingly isolated internationally. This was a significant setback for the leadership, who had courted international investment for much of the 1980s as the country emerged from the chaos of the Cultural Revolution. However, Deng Xiaoping and the core leadership vowed to continue economic liberalization policies after 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Deng et al., "Minutes of the CCP Central Politburo Standing Committee Meeting", in The Tiananmen Papers: The Chinese Leadership's Decision to use Force Against their own People – In their Own Words, eds. Zhang Liang, Andrew J. Nathan, and Perry Link (New York: Perseus, 2001), 424.&lt;/ref&gt; From there on, China would work domestically as well as internationally to reshape its national image from that of a repressive regime to a benign global economic and military partner.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Cabestan, "How China Managed to De-Isolate Itself on the International Stage and Re-Engage the World after Tiananmen", in The Impact of China's 1989 Tiananmen Massacre, ed. Jean-Philippe Beja (New York: Routledge, 2011), 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Domestic trends ====
During the early 1990s, officials such as Yang Shangkun, Li Peng and others sought to return to a planned economy. Deng Xiaoping largely stayed out of politics until his groundbreaking 1992 "southern tour", which was intended to re-instate policies of economic liberalization.&lt;ref&gt;Cabestan, "How China Managed to De-Isolate Itself", 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the liberalization came the loosening of state control in many areas of daily life. Privately run print media flourished. Private newspapers increased from 250 in the 1980s to over 7,000 by 2003. Provincially run satellite TV stations sprung up all over the country and challenged the market share of state-run CCTV.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Kurlantzick, "The Dragon Still Has Teeth: How the West Winks at Chinese Repression", World Policy Journal, 20 no. 1 (2003): 50, https://www.jstor.org/stable/40209847&lt;/ref&gt; The leadership also stepped away from promoting communism as an all-encompassing belief system. State-approved religious organizations increased their membership significantly, and traditional beliefs suppressed during the Mao era re-appeared.&lt;ref&gt;Kurlantzick, "The Dragon Still Has Teeth", 50.&lt;/ref&gt; This state-sanctioned plurality also created the environment for unsanctioned forms of spirituality and worship to grow.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kurlantzick, "The Dragon Still Has Teeth", 52.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to reduce the need for controversial methods of state control, while Protestants, Buddhists, and Taoists were largely left alone, the state often used these 'approved' denominations to "fight against cults" such as [[Falun Gong]], playing sects off each other.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

As the party departed from the orthodox communism it was founded upon, much of its attention was focused on the cultivation of nationalism as an alternative ideology.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Cabestan, "How China Managed to De-Isolate Itself", 199.&lt;/ref&gt; This policy largely succeeded in tying the party's legitimacy to China's "national pride", turning public opinions in its favour.&lt;ref&gt;Cabestan, "How China Managed to De-Isolate Itself", 201.&lt;/ref&gt; This is perhaps most prominently seen in May 1999, when the United States [[United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade|bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Link, "June Fourth: Memory and Ethics", 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The bombings saw an outpouring of nationalist sentiment and increased support for the party as the foremost advocate of China's national interest.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

==== International perception ====
Facing global condemnation for their handling of the protests in 1989, China has endeavored to demonstrate its willingness to participate in international economic and defense institutions in order to secure investment for continued economic reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Link, "June Fourth: Memory and Ethics", 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the end of 1991, China normalized ties with the Russian government's newly elected president, [[Boris Yeltsin]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Cabestan, "How China Managed to De-Isolate Itself", 196.&lt;/ref&gt; China also welcomed Taiwanese business as a replacement for Western investment.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Further, China expedited negotiations with the [[World Trade Organization]] as well as established relations with Indonesia, Israel, South Korea and others in 1992.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Regarding defense alignments, the government signed the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|Non-Proliferation Treaty]] in 1992, the [[Chemical Weapons Convention|Convention on Chemical Weapons]] in 1993 and the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty|Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; Whereas China had been a member of just 30 international organizations in 1986, this membership increased to over 50 by 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Cabestan, "How China Managed to De-Isolate Itself", 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, while China was a net recipient of aid throughout the 1980s, its growing economic and military role transformed it into a provider of aid, with $100 million given to Thailand in 1997 alone.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Kurlantzick, "The Dragon Still Has Teeth", 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the government has successfully promoted China as an attractive destination for investment by emphasizing the country's skilled workers, comparatively lower wages, established infrastructure, and sizeable consumer base.&lt;ref&gt;Kurlantzick, "The Dragon Still Has Teeth", 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Increased foreign investment in the country led many world leaders to believe that by constructively engaging China in the global marketplace, political reforms would inevitably follow.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; At the same time, the explosion of commercial interest in the country opened the way for multinational corporations to turn a blind eye to politics and human rights in favour of doing business. Since then, Western leaders who were previously critical of China have generally paid lip service to the legacy of Tiananmen, but the substance of bilateral relationships focus on business and trade interests.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;

In Hong Kong, the events of Tiananmen in 1989 have become permanently etched in the public consciousness, perhaps more than anywhere else outside mainland China. The events continue to have a strong impact on perceptions of China, its government, attitudes towards democracy, and the extent to which Hong Kongers should identify as Chinese. The events of 4 June are seen as emblematic of the Chinese brand of authoritarianism and is prominently discussed in Hong Kong's political circles, often in relation to democratic reform in Hong Kong and the territory's relationship with Beijing. Academic studies indicate that those who supported the rehabilitation of the Tiananmen Square movement had a tendency to support democratization in the territory{{Sfn|Lee|2012|p=152}} as well as the election of pro-democracy parties.{{Sfn|Lee|2012|p=155}}

=== Economic impact ===
There was a significant impact on the Chinese economy after the incident. The ramifications of the Tiananmen Square protests led to changes in China's economic direction, and these reverberated not only internationally, but also domestically from within the Chinese government themselves. These events led to the Chinese government concentrating power, especially over the direction of the economy. While there was a slowdown immediately after the massacre, the economy quickly rebounded during the 1990s.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Impact of China's 1989 Tiananmen Massacre|last=Naughton|first=Barry|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=9781136906848|editor-last=Béja|editor-first=Jean-Philippe|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Tiananmen Square protests, many analysts downgraded their outlook of China's economic future.&lt;ref name="barry2007"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Chinese economy : transitions and growth|last=Barry.|first=Naughton,|date=2007|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262640640|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=70839809}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese Communist Party's response to the protests was one of the factors that led to a delay in China's acceptance to the [[World Trade Organization]] and China did not become a member until twelve years later on 11 December 2001.&lt;ref name="barry2007"/&gt; Furthermore, bilateral aid to China decreased from $3.4 billion in 1988 to $1.5 billion in 1989, and to $0.7 billion in 1990.&lt;ref name="worldcat1948"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rights beyond borders : the global community and the struggle over human rights in China|last=1948-|first=Foot, Rosemary,|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198297765|location=New York|oclc=47008462}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loans to China were suspended by the [[World Bank]], [[Asian Development Bank]], and foreign governments;&lt;ref&gt;Thakur, M., Burton, G.

L. &amp; Shenkar, O. ''International Business in China''. Routledge, 1993. pp. 120–122. {{ISBN|978-0-415-05345-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[Presidency of George H. W. Bush|Bush administration]] had wanted to normalize and improve relations with China, the violent crackdown of the protests on June 4, 1989, led to his administration banning all sales of weapons to China on June 5. Similar to the Bush administrations initiatives, other countries imposed their own sanctions in response to Tiananmen.&lt;ref name="worldcat1948"/&gt; By July 1989, the [[Group of Seven|G7]] had halted $10 billion in foreign aid, loans from Japan as well as $780 million in bank loans by the [[World Bank]] for the end of June. These coordinated actions hurt the Chinese economy, leading to a decline in international investment, a reduction in the number of tourists, as well as a decline in China's credit rating.&lt;ref name="worldcat1948"/&gt; However, most of these sanctions were eased and lifted by the early 1990s and China's economy rebounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-06-30/news/mn-2555_1_united-states|title=Many 1989 U.S. Sanctions on China Eased or Ended|last=MANN|first=JIM|date=1991-06-30|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the mainly negative [[Reactions to the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|world reaction]] to China's Tiananmen response, as well as internal conflict regarding whether China should continue on a path of economic liberalization, leadership in China pursued a self-imposed enforcement of party discipline. Although political liberals were purged from the Chinese Communist Party, many of those who were economically liberal remained.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This led to a restructuring within the Chinese Communist Party. Even though more reformed-minded leaders such as [[Zhao Ziyang]] were purged from the Communist Party ranks by leaders like [[Deng Xiaoping]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thediplomat.com/2015/06/why-chinas-political-reforms-failed/|title=Why China's Political Reforms Failed|last=Diplomat|first=Wu Wei, The|work=The Diplomat|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; the economically liberal side prevailed as it helped the Chinese economy regain and later surpass the slowdown it had experienced after the Tiananmen Square protests.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Deng was of the main forces behind [[Chinese economic reform|China's economic reform]].

Chinese Premier Li Peng visited the [[United Nations Security Council]] on 31 January 1992 and argued that the economic and arms embargoes on China were a violation of national sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, W. C. ''The United Nations at the Crossroads of Reform''. M. E. Sharpe, 1994. p. 167. {{ISBN|978-1-56324-400-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Union and United States arms embargo ===
{{main|European Union arms embargo on the People's Republic of China}}
The European Union and United States embargo on armament sales to China, put in place as a result of the violent suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests, remains in place today. China has been calling for a lift of the ban for years and has had a varying amount of support from European Union members. Since 2004, China has portrayed the ban as "outdated" and damaging to China–European Union relations. In early 2004, French President [[Jacques Chirac]] spearheaded a movement within the European Union to lift the ban, which was supported by German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]]. However, the passing of the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]] in March 2005 increased tensions between mainland China and Taiwan, damaging attempts to lift the ban and several European Union Council members retracted their support for a lift of the ban. Moreover, Schröder's successor [[Angela Merkel]] opposed lifting the ban. Members of the United States Congress had also proposed restrictions on the transfer of military technology to the European Union if the latter lifted the ban. The United Kingdom also opposed the lifting of the embargo when it took charge of the European Union presidency in July 2005.

In addition, the [[European Parliament]] has consistently opposed the lifting of the arms embargo to China. Though its agreement is not necessary for lifting the ban, many argue it reflects the will of the European people better as it is the only directly elected European body. The arms embargo has limited China's options from where it may seek military hardware. Among the sources that were sought included the former [[Soviet bloc]] that it had a strained relationship with as a result of the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. Other willing suppliers have previously included Israel and South Africa, but American pressure has restricted this co-operation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/markets/feeds/afx/2007/11/27/afx4376482.html "Japan concerned by call to lift China embargo – official"] {{webarchive |url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071128105735/http://www.forbes.com/markets/feeds/afx/2007/11/27/afx4376482.html |date = November 28, 2007 }}, ''Forbes'', November 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The party's official stance towards the incident is that the use of force was necessary in order to control a "political disturbance"&lt;ref name="Human"&gt;Human Rights Watch, "China: Tiananmen's Unhealed Wounds", https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/05/12/china-tiananmen-s-unhealed-wounds&lt;/ref&gt; and that it ensured the stability necessary for economic prosperity.&lt;ref name="IHT"&gt;''International Herald Tribune'', "Relatives of dead at Tiananmen seek review", https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/29/world/asia/29iht-china.1839321.html&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese leaders, including former [[paramount leader]]s [[Jiang Zemin]] and [[Hu Jintao]], reiterate this line when questioned by foreign press.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?menu=c10400&amp;no=228397&amp;rel_no=1&amp;isSerial=&amp;sort_name=&amp;ip_sort=221.154.106.74&amp;page=1 "Hong Kong's Long-Haired' Provocateur"] OhmyNews International, David Kootnikoff&lt;/ref&gt;

Public memory of the Tiananmen Square protests has been suppressed by the authorities since 1989. Print media containing reference to the protests must be consistent with the government's version of events.&lt;ref name="Human"/&gt; Currently, many Chinese citizens are reluctant to speak about the protests because of potential repercussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=CNN |title=China's Youth post-Tiananmen: Apathy a fact or front? |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2009-06-03/world/china.post.tiananmen.generation_1_tiananmen-uprising-post-tiananmen-beijing-s-tiananmen-square/2? |accessdate=July 28, 2012 |df= }}{{dead link|date=November 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rob Gifford held that many young people born after 1980 are unfamiliar with the events and are apathetic about politics.

"No Longer Relying on Heaven." ''[[China Road]]''. 167–168.&lt;/ref&gt;

While public discussion of the events has become a social taboo, private discussions continue to take place despite frequent interference and harassment from the authorities. Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Liu Xiaobo]] remained in China to speak out about Tiananmen in the 1990s despite offers of asylum; he faced constant surveillance. [[Zhang Xianling]] and [[Ding Zilin]], mothers of victims who lost their lives in 1989, founded the [[Tiananmen Mothers]] organization and were particularly outspoken on the humanitarian aspects of the subject.&lt;ref name="Reporters"/&gt; The authorities mobilize security forces, including members of the [[People's Armed Police]], every year on June 4 to prevent public displays of remembrance, with especially heavy security for major anniversaries such as the [[20th anniversary of Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|20th anniversary in 2009]] and the 25th anniversary in 2014.&lt;ref name="Bristow"&gt;Michael Bristow, "Journalists banned from Tiananmen". BBC News, http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8082407.stm&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists have been frequently denied entry to the Square on anniversaries.&lt;ref name="Bristow"/&gt; In addition, the authorities are known to have detained foreign journalists and increase surveillance on prominent human rights activists during this time of year.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/31086212/ns/world_news-asia-pacific "Security tight on Tiananmen Anniversary: China clamps down on Web access 20 years after bloody crackdown"] [[MSNBC]]/[[Associated Press]], June 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet searches of 4 June Tiananmen Square made within China return censored results or result in temporarily severed server connections.&lt;ref name="Reporters"&gt;Reporters Without Borders, "All references to Tiananmen Square massacre closely censored for 20 years", http://en.rsf.org/china-all-references-to-tiananmen-square-02-06-2009,33198.html&lt;/ref&gt; Specific web pages with select keywords are censored while other websites, such as those of overseas Chinese democracy movements, are blocked wholesale.&lt;ref name="Alexa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reporters" /&gt; The censorship, however, has been inconsistent—with many sites being blocked, unblocked and re-blocked over the years, including YouTube, Wikipedia and Flickr.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/article/20090430/FOREIGN/704299900/1103/NEWS China eases its Tiananmen taboo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707095153/http://www.thenational.ae/article/20090430/FOREIGN/704299900/1103/NEWS |date=July 7, 2009 }}, ''The National'', April 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the policy is much more stringent with Chinese-language sites than foreign-language ones.

=== Calls to reverse the verdict ===
Over the years some Chinese citizens have called for a reassessment of the protests and compensation from the government to victims' families. One group in particular, [[Tiananmen Mothers]], seeks compensation, vindication for victims and the right to receive donations from within the mainland and abroad.&lt;ref name="IHT"/&gt; Zhang Shijun, a former soldier who was involved in the military crackdown, had published an open letter to President Hu Jintao seeking to have the government reevaluate its position on the protests. He was subsequently arrested and taken from his home.&lt;ref&gt;Tania Branigan, "Chinese detain soldier who spoke out against Tiananmen Square massacre". ''The Guardian'', http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/20/tiananmen-square-china-zhang-shijun&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Chinese government never officially acknowledged relevant accusations when it came to the incident, in April 2006 a payment was made to the mother of one of the victims, the first publicized case of the government offering redress to a Tiananmen-related victim's family. The payment was termed a "hardship assistance", given to Tang Deying (唐德英) whose son Zhou Guocong ({{zh|s=周国聪|t=周國聰}}) died at age 15 years while in police custody in [[Chengdu]] on 6 June 1989, two days after the Chinese Army dispersed the Tiananmen protesters. She was reportedly paid CNY70,000 (approximately US$10,250). This has been welcomed by various Chinese activists, but it was regarded by some as a measure to maintain social stability and not believed to herald a changing of the party's official position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4960762.stm|title=China makes 1989 Tiananmen payout|date=April 30, 2006|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leaders voicing regret ===
Before his death in 1998, Yang Shangkun told army doctor [[Jiang Yanyong]] that 4 June was the most serious mistake committed by the Communist Party in its history, a mistake that Yang himself could not correct, but one that certainly will eventually be corrected.&lt;ref&gt;(Chinese) [http://www.voachinese.com/content/yangbaibing-20130117/1585554.html "镇压六四主将、党内斗争牺牲品杨白冰病逝" Voice of America] January 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Zhao Ziyang remained under house arrest until his death in 2005. Zhao's aide [[Bao Tong]] has repeatedly called on the government to reverse the verdict for the demonstrations. Chen Xitong, the mayor of Beijing, who read the martial law order and was later disgraced by a political scandal, expressed regret for the death of innocent civilians in 2012, a year before his death.&lt;ref name=nytchen&gt;{{cite news |last1=Buckley |first1 = Chris |title = Chen Xitong, Beijing Mayor During Tiananmen Protests, Dies at 82 |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/06/world/asia/chen-xitong-mayor-during-tiananmen-protests-dies.html|accessdate = June 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Premier [[Wen Jiabao]] reportedly suggested reversing the government's position on Tiananmen in party meetings prior to his departure from politics in 2013, only to be rebuffed by his colleagues.&lt;ref name="ja4"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Anderlini |first1=Jamil |title=Wen lays ground for Tiananmen healing |url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/13c6fcb2-7285-11e1-9be9-00144feab49a.html |accessdate=June 6, 2014 |date = March 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Nations report ===
The [[UN Committee Against Torture|Committee Against Torture]] met for its 41st session from 3–21 November 2008 to consider reports submitted by member states under article 19 of the [[UN Convention Against Torture|Convention]]. The Committee found that China's response to the 1989 Democracy movement was worrying. The Committee was concerned that despite the multiple requests by relatives of people "killed, arrested or disappeared on or following the&amp;nbsp;4 June 1989 Beijing suppression", there was a lack of investigations into these matters. It was also concerned with the failure of the Chinese government to inform families of the fate of relatives involved, and it regretted that those responsible for the use of excessive force have not "faced any sanction, administrative or criminal."&lt;ref name="UN4"&gt;5. [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cat/docs/CAT.C.CHN.CO.4.pdf Committee Against Torture, "Consideration of Reports Submitted by States Parties Under Article 19 of the Convention: China"], CAT/C/CHN/CO/4, page 8, paragraph 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee recommended the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The State party should conduct a full and impartial investigation into the suppression of the Democracy Movement in Beijing in June
1989, provide information on the persons who are still detained from that period, inform the family members of their findings, offer apologies and reparation as appropriate and prosecute those found responsible for excessive use of force, torture and other illtreatment.&lt;ref name="UN4"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In December 2009, the Chinese government responded to the Committee's recommendations by saying that the government had closed the case concerning the "political turmoil in the spring and summer of 1989."&lt;ref name="UN5"&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cat/docs/followup/CAT.C.CHN.CO.4.Add2.pdf "Consideration of Reports Submitted by States Parties Under Article 19 of the Convention: Comments by the Government of the People's Republic of China concerning the Concluding Observations and Recommendations of the Committee Against Torture"], Committee Against Torture, CAT/C/CHN/CO/4/ADD.2, page 13, paragraph 9.&lt;/ref&gt; It also stated that the "practice of the past 20 years has made it clear that the timely and decisive measures taken by the Chinese Government at the time were necessary and correct." It claimed that the labelling of the "incident as 'the Democracy Movement'" is a "distortion in the nature of the incident." According to the Chinese Government these observations were "inconsistent with the Committee's responsibilities."&lt;ref name="UN5"/&gt;

=== Documentaries ===
In 1995, Richard Gordon and Carma Hinton produced ''[[The Gate of Heavenly Peace]]'' an award-winning three-hour documentary film about the Tiananmen Square protests. The film contains interviews with Liu Xiaobo, Wang Dan, Wu'erkaixi, Han Dongfang, Ding Zilin, Chai Ling, Dai Qing, Feng Congde, and Hou Dejian.

The same year saw the release of [[Moving the Mountain (1994 film)|''Moving the Mountain'']] a feature documentary directed by [[Michael Apted]] and produced by [[Trudie Styler]], with cinematography by [[Maryse Alberti]]. The film takes its title from the memoir by [[Li Lu]], one of the student leaders of the Tiananmen Square protests. Though Li Lu is a central figure in the finished film, the project set out to provide a comprehensive understanding of the events leading up to and following the protests and features many other interviews.

A primetime special hosted by [[Tom Brokaw]] honored both the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing and the [[Downfall of Berlin Wall|fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989, a momentous year for human rights around the world.

In April 2006, the [[PBS]] series ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' produced an episode titled ''[[The Tank Man (film)|The Tank Man]]'', which examined his role in the 1989 Tiananmen Square Protests and the change that has overtaken China economically and politically since.

On 3 June 2009, the [[BBC]] aired the documentary ''Kate Adie returns to Tiananmen'' in which documented reporter [[Kate Adie]]'s return to China, where Adie recalls the events she witnessed in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00l17sy "Kate Adie returns to Tiananmen"].

Since Tiananmen, the iconic "Tank Man" image has become a worldwide symbol for civil disobedience. What happened to the "Tank Man" following the demonstration is not known. Some say he was pulled away and went into hiding, others say he was executed by the authorities.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4313282.stm Picture Power:Tiananmen Standoff] BBC News. Last updated October 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Time'' dubbed him "The Unknown Rebel" and later named him one of the [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|100 most influential people of the 20th century]]. In an interview with United States media, then Chinese paramount leader Jiang Zemin said he did not think the man was killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Iyer |first=Pico |title=TIME 100: The Unknown Rebel |work=Time |date=April 13, 1998 |url = http://205.188.238.181/time/time100/leaders/profile/rebel2.html |accessdate=May 25, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110512174903/http://205.188.238.181/time/time100/leaders/profile/rebel2.html |archivedate = May 12, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Songs ===
* Joan Baez' song "China", from her 1989 ''[[Speaking of Dreams]]'' album, was a chronicle of the events. She also dedicated the album to the students who "nonviolently, and at an enormous price, have changed the face of China forever".
* The 1989 song "The King of Sunset Town" by [[Marillion]] has its lyrical roots in the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/seasons-end-mw0000205251 |title = Marillion – Seasons End |publisher = AllMusic |first = Jeri |last = Montesano |accessdate = 8 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1989 song "[[Tin Omen (song)|Tin Omen]]" by [[Skinny Puppy]] is about the massacre.&lt;ref name="Milwaukee"&gt;{{cite web |last = Nichols |first1 = Kathy |date = 17 November 2015 |title = Skinny Puppy bring Politicized Industrial, Over-the-Top Theatrics to The Rave |url = http://milwaukeerecord.com/music/skinny-puppy-bring-politicized-industrial-over-the-top-theatrics-to-the-rave/ |website= ''MilwaukeeRecord.com'' |accessdate= 26 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Billy Joel]]'s 1989 song "[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]" mentions China's declaration of martial law to disperse the protest.
* The 1990 song "Tiananmen Square" by [[Chumbawamba]], from their album ''[[Slap!]]'', explicitly refers to the tragedy.
* The 1991 song "[[Shiny Happy People]]" by [[R.E.M.]] is supposedly an ironic reference to a piece of roughly translated Chinese propaganda regarding the massacre, two years before the song was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://music.aol.com/feature/111-wussiest-songs-number-1 |archive-url = http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090630204733/http://music.aol.com/feature/111-wussiest-songs-number-1 |dead-url = yes |archive-date = June 30, 2009 |title = The 111 Wussiest Songs of All Time (No. 1) – AOL Music |website = Music.aol.com |accessdate = November 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1992 song "Watching TV" by [[Roger Waters]] (from his album ''[[Amused to Death]]'') describes a fictional woman killed at Tiananmen Square in 1989 to show how much of an effect someone's death can have on the world if it happens live on TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=4282 |title = Watching TV by Roger Waters – Songfacts |accessdate = June 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1996 song "The Tienanmen Man" by [[Nevermore]] appears on their album, ''[[The Politics of Ecstasy (album)|The Politics of Ecstasy]]''. The song is about the anonymous person who became known as "[[Tank Man]]".
* The 2005 song "[[Hypnotize (System of a Down song)|Hypnotize]]" by [[System of a Down]] uses the protests as a counterpoint to a materialistic vision of freedom.
* The 2010 song "[[4 June 1989]]" by [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]], from the point of view of a young soldier, appears on her album ''[[The Age of Miracles]]''.
* The 2013 song "[[Gunfight (song)|Gunfight]]" by [[Sick Puppies]] has a verse about the incident.

'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right to access information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right to access public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Freedom of Information (FOI) in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] is regulated by chapter 3 of the General Administrative code of Georgia, which is in force since 1999. Despite the fact that the ensuring legal framework on freedom of information contains sound provisions, in view of the existing international standards and practices, as well as existing practices in Georgia, the act is considered outdated &lt;ref name=IDFI&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= December 2015 |title= Access to Public Information in Georgia.

Georgia. Monitoring Report |url=https://www.osgf.ge/files/2016/EU%20publication/Angarishi_A4__Corruption_ENG.pdf  |publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Anti-corruption Network for Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Istanbul Anti-corruption Action Plan |access-date= 24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, Georgian civil society organisations have advocated for improvements of the law, and the Government took obligation to elaborate a new law on freedom of information.&lt;ref name=IDFI/&gt; The adoption of a new Freedom of Information law is one of the Georgian Government's commitments in the framework of its annual action plan for the implementation of the [[European Union Association Agreement|Association Agreement]] between the [[European Union|EU]] and Georgia signed in 2014.&lt;ref name=OSGF&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= July 2016|title=Reforming Georgia’s Access to Information Law |url=https://www.osgf.ge/files/2016/EU%20publication/Angarishi_A4__Corruption_ENG.pdf  |publisher=Open Society Georgia Foundation |access-date= 24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal framework==

The existing law states that all public information is open except for the cases established by the law and the information covered by privacy rights or commercial secret. In Georgia, anyone is entitled to request public information. The applicants do not have to specify the reasons for their request. An applicant has the option to be allowed to view the original of the information required or to ask for a copy. Requests for information should be made in writing, including via electronic means.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt; Fees for the provision of public information are expressly prohibited by the law, except for covering the actual costs for producing copies.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt;

Public institutions are obliged to provide the requested information immediately or not later than within 10 working days of the application.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt; Applicants must be notified of the refusal to disclose information immediately and must be given, within 3 days of the refusal, a written explanation of the reason for denial and with information on the appeals procedures. In the appeal procedures, aiming at challenging the denial decision of a public institution, the burden of the proof lies with the public institutions.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt;

The Georgian law also establishes that public bodies have to proactively publish information, that is without the need of sending a request, according to the rules set forth in secondary legislation, namely in the amendment made to the General Administrative Code of Georgia in 2012 on proactive disclosure and electronic request of public information.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt;

Public institutions are obliged to report annually to Parliament, the President and the Prime Minister on their compliance with access to information law and provide updated statistics and data.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt;

One of the most important novelties of the draft elaborated by civil society and experts is the establishment of the office of the [[Information commissioner|Information Commissioner]], a new institution with the mandate of monitoring the application of the law, revealing cases of misconduct and taking action to protect the right to public information.&lt;ref name=IDFI/&gt; This would address one of the major gaps in existing legislation, i.e. the lack of a designed central body with the power to oversee the compliance of public institutions with existing regulations.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt; Another shortcoming of the current legal framework concerns the lack of a sanctions system in cases of non-compliance.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt; Also, the exceptions for non-disclosure are ambiguous and not clearly defined in the law which does not cover state-owned enterprises.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt;

The shortcomings of the law have resulted in an uneven application of the right to access to information in  practice. In this process, the judiciary has not proven to be an effective means of dealing with the refusals of some public institutions to push them to disclose the required information.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt;

==Access to information in practice==

Access to information law is poorly enforced in Georgia and its application remains a problem.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt; A local NGO, the [[Institute for Development of Freedom of Information|Institute for Development of Freedom of Information (IDFI)]], has conducted a comprehensive analysis assessing the implementation of the law and the compliance of public institutions to it, carrying out a series of large-scale FOI tests between 2010-2015.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt;

The IDFI study shows that in the period monitored, 24% of the request filed by the organisation remained unanswered. A complete answer was received in 64% of cases and an incomplete one in 10%, while the refusal to provide the information required occurred in 2% of the cases.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt;&lt;ref name=IDFI/&gt; In terms of annual evaluation, the overall response rate was the worst in 2010-11, while it improved significantly in 2012-13 - as a result of the 2012 parliamentary elections - but started to deteriorate again in 2014. Over time, the rate of provision of the requested information within the deadline established by the law improved significantly, ranging from 22% of 2010 to 75% of 2015.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt;&lt;ref name=IDFI/&gt; The assessment also found out great variations between public agencies with regard to their compliance with the law: for instance, some ministers recorded a 100% response rate, others provided a complete answer in less than 50% of the cases, while the lowest score concerned the Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development with a mere 10% in the rating.&lt;ref name=OSGF/&gt;&lt;ref name=IDFI/&gt;

'''Activity recognition''' aims to recognize the actions and goals of one or more agents from a series of observations on the agents' actions and the environmental conditions. Since the 1980s, this research field has captured the attention of several [[computer science]] communities due to its strength in providing personalized support for many different applications and its connection to many different fields of study such as medicine, human-computer interaction, or sociology.

Due to its many-faceted nature, different fields may refer to activity recognition as plan recognition, goal recognition, intent recognition, behavior recognition, location estimation and location-based services.

==Types==

===Sensor-based, single-user activity recognition===
[[Sensor]]-based activity recognition integrates the emerging area of sensor networks with novel [[data mining]] and [[machine learning]] techniques to model a wide range of human activities.&lt;ref&gt;Tanzeem Choudhury, [[Gaetano Borriello]], et al. The Mobile Sensing Platform: An Embedded System for Activity Recognition. Appears in the IEEE Pervasive Magazine - Special Issue on Activity-Based Computing, April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nishkam Ravi, Nikhil Dandekar, Preetham Mysore, Michael Littman. [http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2005/IAAI05-013.pdf Activity Recognition from Accelerometer Data]. Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence (IAAI/AAAI 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile devices (e.g. smart phones) provide sufficient sensor data and calculation power to enable physical activity recognition to provide an estimation of the energy consumption during everyday life. Sensor-based activity recognition researchers believe that by empowering [[ubiquitous computing|ubiquitous computers]] and sensors to monitor the behavior of agents (under consent), these computers will be better suited to act on our behalf.

====Levels of sensor-based activity recognition====
Sensor-based activity recognition is a challenging task due to the inherent noisy nature of the input. Thus, [[statistical modeling]] has been the main thrust in this direction in layers, where the recognition at several intermediate levels is conducted and connected. At the lowest level where the sensor data are collected, statistical learning concerns how to find the detailed locations of agents from the received signal data. At an intermediate level, [[statistical inference]] may be concerned about how to recognize individuals' activities from the inferred location sequences and environmental conditions at the lower levels. Furthermore, at the highest level a major concern is to find out the overall goal or subgoals of an agent from the activity sequences through a mixture of logical and statistical reasoning.

===Sensor-based, multi-user activity recognition===
Recognizing activities for multiple users using on-body sensors first appeared in the work by ORL using active badge systems&lt;ref&gt;Want R., Hopper A., Falcao V., Gibbons J.: The Active Badge Location System, ACM Transactions on Information, Systems, Vol. 40, No. 1, pp. 91-102, January 1992&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 90's. Other sensor technology such as acceleration sensors were used for identifying group activity patterns during office scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;Bieber G., Kirste T., Untersuchung des gruppendynamischen Aktivitaetsverhaltes im Office-Umfeld, 7. Berliner Werkstatt Mensch-Maschine-Systeme, Berlin, Germany, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Activities of Multiple Users in intelligent environments are addressed in Gu et al.&lt;ref&gt;Tao Gu, Zhanqing Wu, Liang Wang, Xianping Tao, and Jian Lu. [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5326404/ Mining Emerging Patterns for Recognizing Activities of Multiple Users in Pervasive Computing]. In Proc. of the 6th International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Computing, Networking and Services (MobiQuitous '09), Toronto, Canada, July 13–16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, they investigate the fundamental problem of recognizing activities for multiple users from sensor readings in a home environment, and propose a novel pattern mining approach to recognize both single-user and multi-user activities in a unified solution.

===Sensor-based group activity recognition===
Recognition of group activities is fundamentally different from single, or multi-user activity recognition in that the goal is to recognize the behavior of the group as an entity, rather than the activities of the individual members within it.&lt;ref&gt;Dawud Gordon, Jan-Hendrik Hanne, Martin Berchtold, Ali Asghar Nazari Shirehjini, Michael Beigl: [http://www.teco.edu/~gordon/publications/MONE_GAR.pdf Towards Collaborative Group Activity Recognition Using Mobile Devices], Mobile Networks and Applications 18(3), 2013, p. 326-340&lt;/ref&gt;  Group behavior is emergent in nature, meaning that the properties of the behavior of the group are fundamentally different then the properties of the behavior of the individuals within it, or any sum of that behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Lewin, K. Field theory in social science: selected theoretical papers. Social science paperbacks. Harper, New York, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;  The main challenges are in modeling the behavior of the individual group members, as well as the roles of the individual within the group dynamic &lt;ref&gt;Hirano, T., and Maekawa, T. [http://www-nishio.ist.osaka-u.ac.jp/~maekawa/paper/maekawa-ISWC2013.pdf A hybrid unsupervised/supervised model for group activity recognition]. In Proceedings of the 2013 International Symposium on Wearable Computers, ISWC ’13, ACM (New York, NY, USA, 2013), 21–24&lt;/ref&gt; and their relationship to emergent behavior of the group in parallel.&lt;ref&gt;Brdiczka, O., Maisonnasse, J., Reignier, P., and Crowley, J. L. [http://www-prima.imag.fr/Prima/Homepages/jlc/papers/BrdiczkaAppliedIntelligence.pdf Detecting small group activities from multimodal observations]. Applied Intelligence 30, 1 (July 2007), 47–57.&lt;/ref&gt;  Challenges which must still be addressed include quantification of the behavior and roles of individuals who join the group, integration of explicit models for role description into inference algorithms, and scalability evaluations for very large groups and crowds.  Group activity recognition has applications for crowd management and response in emergency situations, as well as for social networking and [[Quantified Self]] applications.&lt;ref&gt;Dawud Gordon, Group Activity Recognition Using Wearable Sensing Devices, Dissertation, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches==

===Activity recognition through logic and reasoning===
Logic-based approaches keep track of all [[logically consistent]] explanations of the observed actions. Thus, all possible and consistent plans or goals must be considered. Kautz provided a formal theory of plan recognition. He described plan recognition as a logical inference process of circumscription. All actions, plans are uniformly referred to as goals, and a recognizer's knowledge is represented by a set of first-order statements called event hierarchy encoded in first-order logic, which defines abstraction, decomposition and functional relationships between types of events.&lt;ref&gt;H. Kautz. "[https://urresearch.rochester.edu/fileDownloadForInstitutionalItem.action?itemId=5934&amp;itemFileId=9297 A formal theory of plan recognition]". In PhD thesis, University of Rochester, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kautz's general framework for plan recognition has an exponential time complexity in worst case, measured in the size of input hierarchy. Lesh and Etzioni went one step further and presented methods in scaling up goal recognition to scale up his work computationally. In contrast to Kautz's approach where the plan library is explicitly represented, Lesh and Etzioni's approach enables automatic plan-library construction from domain primitives. Furthermore, they introduced compact representations and efficient algorithms for goal recognition on large plan libraries.&lt;ref&gt;N. Lesh and O. Etzioni. "[http://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/95-2/Papers/088.pdf A sound and fast goal recognizer]". In ''Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence'', 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inconsistent plans and goals are repeatedly pruned when new actions arrive. Besides, they also presented methods for adapting a goal recognizer to handle individual idiosyncratic behavior given a sample of an individual's recent behavior. Pollack et al. described a direct argumentation model that can know about the relative strength of several kinds of arguments for belief and intention description.

A serious problem of logic-based approaches is their inability or inherent infeasibility to represent uncertainty. They offer no mechanism for preferring one consistent approach to another and incapable of deciding whether one particular plan is more likely than another, as long as both of them can be consistent enough to explain the actions observed. There is also a lack of learning ability associated with logic based methods.

Another approach to logic-based activity recognition is to use stream reasoning based on Answer Set Programming,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Do|first=Thang|author2=Seng W. Loke|author3=Fei Liu|title=Answer Set Programming for Stream Reasoning|journal=Advances in Artificial Intelligence, Lecture Notes in Computer Science|year=2011|volume=6657|pages=104–109|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-21043-3_13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been applied to recognising activities for health-related applications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Do|first=Thang|author2=Seng W. Loke|author3=Fei Liu|title=HealthyLife: an Activity Recognition System with Smartphone using Logic-Based Stream Reasoning|journal=Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Computing, Networking and Services, (Mobiquitous 2012)|year=2012|url=http://homepage.cs.latrobe.edu.au/sloke/papers/Mobiquitous2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which uses weak constraints to model a degree of ambiguity/uncertainty.

===Activity recognition through probabilistic reasoning===
Probability theory and statistical learning models are more recently applied in activity recognition to reason about actions, plans and goals under uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;E. Charniak and R.P. Goldman. "[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000437029390060O A Bayesian model of plan recognition]". ''Artificial Intelligence'', 64:53–79, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; In the literature, there have been several approaches which explicitly represent uncertainty in reasoning about an agent's plans and goals.

Using sensor data as input, Hodges and Pollack designed machine learning-based systems for identifying individuals as they perform routine daily activities such as making coffee.&lt;ref&gt;M.R. Hodges and M.E. Pollack. "[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.109.5487&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf An 'object-use fingerprint': The use of electronic sensors for human identification]". In ''Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Ubiquitous Computing'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intel Research Lablets|Intel Research (Seattle) Lab]] and [[University of Washington]] at Seattle have done some important works on using sensors to detect human plans.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Perkowitz, Matthai Philipose, Donald J. Patterson, and Kenneth P. Fishkin. "[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.103.7512&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Mining models of human activities from the web]".

The use of temporal probabilistic models has been shown to perform well in activity recognition and generally outperform non-temporal models.&lt;ref&gt;TLM van Kasteren, Gwenn Englebienne, BJA Kröse.

Discriminative models such as Conditional Random Fields (CRF) are also commonly applied and also give good performance in activity recognition.&lt;ref&gt;TLM Van Kasteren, Athanasios Noulas, Gwenn Englebienne, Ben Kröse, "[https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1409637 Accurate activity recognition in a home setting]", 2008/9/21, Proceedings of the 10th international conference on Ubiquitous computing, 1-9, ACM&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Derek Hao Hu, Sinno Jialin Pan, Vincent Wenchen Zheng, Nathan NanLiu, and Qiang Yang. Real world activity recognition with multiple goals. In Proceedings of the 10th international conference on Ubiquitous computing, Ubicomp, pages 30–39, New York, NY, USA, 2008. ACM.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generative and discriminative models both have their pros and cons and the ideal choice depends on their area of application. A dataset together with implementations of a number of popular models (HMM, CRF) for activity recognition can be found [https://sites.google.com/site/tim0306/datasets here].

Conventional temporal probabilistic models such as the hidden Markov model (HMM) and conditional random fields (CRF) model directly model the correlations between the activities and the observed sensor data. In recent years, increasing evidence has supported the use of hierarchical models which take into account the rich hierarchical structure that exists in human behavioral data.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[[Nuria Oliver]], Ashutosh Garg, and Eric Horvitz. Layered representations for learning and inferring office activity from multiple sensory channels. Comput. Vis. Image Underst., 96(2):163–180, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amarnag Subramanya, Alvin Raj, Jeff Bilmes, and Dieter Fox. Hierarchical models for activity recognition. In Proceedings of the international conference on Multimedia Signal Processing, MMSP, Victoria, CA, October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The core idea here is that the model does not directly correlate the activities with the sensor data, but instead breaks the activity into sub-activities (sometimes referred to as actions) and models the underlying correlations accordingly. An example could be the activity of preparing spaghetti, which can be broken down into the subactivities or actions of cutting vegetables, frying the vegetables in a pan and serving it on a plate. Examples of such a hierarchical model are Layered Hidden Markov Models (LHMMs)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and the hierarchical hidden Markov model (HHMM), which have been shown to significantly outperform its non-hierarchical counterpart in activity recognition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Data mining based approach to activity recognition===
Different from traditional machine learning approaches, an approach based on data mining has been recently proposed. In the work of Gu et al., the problem of activity recognition is formulated as a pattern-based classification problem. They proposed a data mining approach based on discriminative patterns which describe significant changes between any two activity classes of data to recognize sequential, interleaved and concurrent activities in a unified solution.&lt;ref&gt;Tao Gu, Zhanqing Wu, Xianping Tao, Hung Keng Pung, and Jian Lu. [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4912776/ epSICAR: An Emerging Patterns based Approach to Sequential, Interleaved and Concurrent Activity Recognition]. In Proc. of the 7th Annual IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (Percom '09), Galveston, Texas, March 9–13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert ''et al.'' use 2D corners in both space and time. These are grouped spatially and temporally using a hierarchical process, with an increasing search area. At each stage of the hierarchy, the most distinctive and descriptive features are learned efficiently through data mining (Apriori rule).&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert A, Illingworth J, Bowden R.

==Sensor usage==

===Vision-based activity recognition===
It is a very important and challenging problem to track and understand the behavior of agents through videos taken by various cameras. The primary technique employed is computer vision. Vision-based activity recognition has found many applications such as human-computer interaction, user interface design, [[robot learning]], and surveillance, among others.
Scientific conferences where vision based activity recognition work often appears are [[ICCV]] and [[CVPR]].

In vision-based activity recognition, a great deal of work has been done. Researchers have attempted a number of methods such as [[optical flow]], [[Kalman filtering]], [[Hidden Markov model]]s, etc., under different modalities such as single camera, stereo, and infrared. In addition, researchers have considered multiple aspects on this topic, including single pedestrian tracking, group tracking, and detecting dropped objects.

Recently some researchers have used RGBD cameras like Microsoft Kinect to detect human activities. Depth cameras add extra dimension i.e. depth which normal 2d camera fails to provide. Sensory information from these depth cameras have been used to generate real-time skeleton model of humans with different body positions. These skeleton information provides meaningful information that researchers have used to model human activities which are trained and later used to recognize unknown activities.&lt;ref&gt;Piyathilaka, L.; Kodagoda, S., "[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6566433&amp;isnumber=6566328 Gaussian mixture based HMM for human daily activity recognition using 3D skeleton features]," Industrial Electronics and Applications (ICIEA), 2013 8th IEEE Conference on, vol., no., pp.567,572, 19–21 June 2013  URL: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6566433&amp;isnumber=6566328&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite remarkable progress of vision-based activity recognition, its usage for most actual visual surveillance applications remains a distant aspiration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bux |first1=Allah |last2=Angelov |first2=Plamen |last3=Habib |first3=Zulfiqar |title=A comprehensive review on handcrafted and learning-based action representation approaches for human activity recognition |journal=Applied Sciences |date=2017 |volume=7 |issue=1 |page=110 |doi=10.3390/app7010110}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Conversely, the human brain seems to have perfected the ability to recognize human actions. This capability relies not only on acquired knowledge, but also on the aptitude of extracting information relevant to a given context and logical reasoning. Based on this observation, it has been proposed to enhance vision-based activity recognition systems by integrating [[commonsense reasoning]] and, contextual and commonsense knowledge. Experiments performed using video and RGBD cameras demonstrate the added value of such approach &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Martinez-del-Rincon |first1=Jesus |last2=Santofimia |first2=Maria Jose |last3=Nebel |first3=Jean-Christophe |title=Common Sense Reasoning for Human Action Recognition |journal=Pattern Recognition Letters |date=2013 |volume=34 |issue=15 |page=1849-1860 |doi=10.1016/j.patrec.2012.10.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cantarero |first1=R. |last2=Santofimia |first2=M.

====Levels of vision-based activity recognition====
In vision-based activity recognition, the computational process is often divided into four steps, namely human detection, human tracking, human activity recognition and then a high-level activity evaluation.

====Fine-grained action localization====
{{main|Object Co-segmentation}}

In [[computer vision]]-based activity recognition, fine-grained action localization typically provides per-image segmentation masks delineating the human object and its action category (e.g., ''Segment-Tube''&lt;ref name="Wang Duan Zhang Niu p=1657"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wang | first=Le | last2=Duan | first2=Xuhuan | last3=Zhang | first3=Qilin | last4=Niu | first4=Zhenxing | last5=Hua | first5=Gang | last6=Zheng | first6=Nanning | title=Segment-Tube: Spatio-Temporal Action Localization in Untrimmed Videos with Per-Frame Segmentation | journal=Sensors | publisher=MDPI AG | volume=18 | issue=5 | date=2018-05-22 | issn=1424-8220 | doi=10.3390/s18051657 | page=1657 | url=https://qilin-zhang.github.io/_pages/pdfs/Segment-Tube_Spatio-Temporal_Action_Localization_in_Untrimmed_Videos_with_Per-Frame_Segmentation.pdf}}  [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]]].&lt;/ref&gt;). Techniques such as dynamic [[Markov random field|Markov Networks]], [[Convolutional neural network|CNN]] and [[Long short-term memory|LSTM]] are often employed to exploit the semantic correlations between consecutive video frames.

====Automatic gait recognition====
{{Main|Gait recognition}}

One way to identify specific people is by how they walk. Gait-recognition software can be used to record a person's gait or gait feature profile in a database for the purpose of recognizing that person later, even if they are wearing a disguise.

===Wi-Fi-based activity recognition===
When activity recognition is performed indoors and in cities using the widely available [[Wi-Fi]] signals and [[802.11]] access points, there is much noise and uncertainty. These uncertainties can be modeled using a dynamic [[Bayesian network]] model.&lt;ref&gt;Jie Yin, Xiaoyong Chai and Qiang Yang, "[http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2004/AAAI04-092.pdf High-level Goal Recognition in a Wireless LAN]". In ''Proceedings of the Nineteenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence'' (AAAI-04), San Jose, CA USA, July 2004. Pages 578-584&lt;/ref&gt; In a multiple goal model that can reason about user's interleaving goals,a [[deterministic]] state transition model is applied.&lt;ref&gt;Xiaoyong Chai and Qiang Yang, "[http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2005/AAAI05-001.pdf Multiple-Goal Recognition From Low-level Signals]". ''Proceedings of the Twentieth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence'' (AAAI 2005), Pittsburgh, PA USA, July 2005. Pages 3-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible method models the concurrent and interleaving activities in a probabilistic approach.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Hao Hu, Qiang Yang. "[http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2008/AAAI08-216.pdf CIGAR: Concurrent and Interleaving Goal and Activity Recognition]", to appear in AAAI 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A user action discovery model could segment Wi-Fi signals to produce possible actions.&lt;ref&gt;Jie Yin, Dou Shen, Qiang Yang and Ze-nian Li "[http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2005/AAAI05-005.pdf Activity Recognition through Goal-Based Segmentation]". ''Proceedings of the Twentieth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence'' (AAAI 2005), Pittsburgh, PA USA, July 2005. Pages 28-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

By automatically monitoring human activities, home-based rehabilitation can be provided for people suffering from traumatic brain injuries. One can find applications ranging from security-related applications and logistics support to [[location-based service]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martha E. Pollack|Pollack, M.E.]], and et al., L. E. B. 2003.

'''Akrasia''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|k|r|eɪ|z|i|ə}}; [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἀκρασία|ἀκρασία]]}}, "lacking command"), occasionally transliterated as '''acrasia''' or Anglicised as '''acrasy''' or '''acracy''', is described as a lack of self-control or the state of acting against one's better judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ad6grll-ak&amp;t=339s?t=5m49s | title=College Info Geek}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adjectival form is "akratic".&lt;ref&gt;Although this philosopher's technical term is usually employed in its Greek form (i.e., '''akrasia'''/'''akratic''') in English texts, it was once the philosophers' English language convention to use the precise English equivalent of '''akrasia/akratic''', '''[[wikt:incontinence|incontinence]]'''/'''incontinent'''. However, it now seems that the correct, widely established convention is to use the term '''akrasia'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical approaches==
[[Image:Socrates Louvre.jpg|thumb|Portrait in marble of [[Socrates]], who was an early investigator of akrasia]]
The problem goes back at least as far as Plato. In [[Plato]]'s ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'' [[Socrates]] asks precisely how it is possible that, ''if'' one judges action A to be the best course of action, one would do anything other than A?

In the [[dialogue]] ''Protagoras'', Socrates attests that akrasia does not exist, claiming "No one goes willingly toward the bad" (358d). If a person examines a situation and decides to act in the way he determines to be best, he will pursue this action, as the best course is also the good course, i.e. man's natural goal.  An all-things-considered assessment of the situation will bring full knowledge of a decision's outcome and worth linked to well-developed principles of the good. A person, according to Socrates, never chooses to act poorly or against his better judgment; and, therefore, actions that go against what is best are simply a product of being ignorant of facts or knowledge of what is best or good.

[[Aristotle]], on the other hand, took a more empirical approach to the question, acknowledging that we intuitively believe in akrasia. He distances himself from the Socratic position by locating the breakdown of reasoning in an agent’s opinion, not his [[appetition]]. Now, without recourse to appetitive desires, Aristotle reasons that akrasia occurs as a result of opinion. Opinion is formulated mentally in a way that may or may not imitate truth, while appetites are merely desires of the body. Thus, opinion is only incidentally aligned with or opposed to the good, making an akratic action the product of opinion instead of reason. For Aristotle, the antonym of ''akrasia'' is ''[[enkrateia]]'', which means "in power" (over oneself).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/aristotle-ethics/#Akr|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Richard|last=Kraut|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=14 July 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''akrasia'' occurs twice in the [[Koine Greek]] [[New Testament]]. In {{Bibleverse|Matthew|23:25}} [[Jesus]] uses it to describe hypocritical religious leaders, translated "self-indulgence" in several translations, including the English Standard version. [[Paul the Apostle]] also gives the threat of temptation through akrasia as a reason for a husband and wife to not deprive each other of sex ({{Bibleverse|1 Corinthians|7:5}}). In another passage (Rom. 7:15–25) Paul, without actually using the term ''akrasia'', seems to reference the same psychological phenomenon in discussing the internal conflict between, on the one hand, "the law of God," which he equates with "the law of my mind"; and "another law in my members," identified with "the flesh, the law of sin." "For the good that I would do, I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do." (v.19)

In [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', book II, Acrasia, the embodiment of intemperance dwelling in the "Bower of Bliss", had the [[Circe]]-like capacity of transforming her lovers into monstrous animal shapes.

==Contemporary approaches==
[[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] (1969–1980) attempted to solve the problem by first criticizing earlier thinkers who wanted to limit the scope of akrasia to agents who despite having reached a [[Rational choice theory|rational decision]] were somehow swerved off their "desired" tracks.  Indeed, Davidson expands akrasia to include any judgment that is reached but not fulfilled, whether it be as a result of an opinion, a real or imagined good, or a moral belief. "[T]he puzzle I shall discuss depends only on the attitude or belief of the agent…my subject concerns evaluative judgments, whether they are analyzed cognitively, prescriptively, or otherwise."  Thus, he expands akrasia to include cases in which the agent seeks to fulfill desires, for example, but ends up denying himself the pleasure he has deemed most choice-worthy.

Davidson sees the problem as one of reconciling the following apparently [[inconsistent triad]]:
* If an agent believes A to be better than B, then they want to do A more than B.
* If an agent wants to do A more than B, then they will do A rather than B if they only do one.
* Sometimes an agent acts against their better judgment.

Davidson solves the problem by saying that, when people act in this way, they temporarily believe that the worse course of action is better, because they have not made an all-things-considered judgment, but only a judgment based on a subset of possible considerations.

Another contemporary philosopher, [[Amélie Rorty]] (1980) has tackled the problem by distilling out akrasia's many forms.  She contends that akrasia is manifested in different stages of the [[practical reasoning]] process. She enumerates four types of akrasia: akrasia of direction or aim, of interpretation, of irrationality, and of character.  She separates the practical reasoning process into four steps, showing the breakdown that may occur between each step and how each constitutes an akratic state.

Another explanation is that there are different forms of [[motivation]] which can conflict with each other. Throughout the ages, many have identified a conflict between [[reason]] and [[emotion]], which might make it possible to believe that one should do A rather than B, but still end up wanting to do B more than A.

Psychologist [[George Ainslie (psychologist)|George Ainslie]] argues that akrasia results from the empirically verified phenomenon of [[hyperbolic discounting]], which causes us to make different judgements close to a reward than we will when further from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Weakness of will==
Richard Holton (1999), argues that weakness of the will involves revising one's [[wikt:resolution|resolution]]s too easily. Under this view, it is possible to act against one's better judgment (that is, be akratic), but without being weak-willed. Suppose, for example, Sarah ''judges'' that taking revenge upon a murderer is not the best course of action, but makes the resolution to take revenge anyway and sticks to that resolution.  According to Holton, Sarah behaves akratically but does not show weakness of will. &lt;!-- holds to that intention? As in she does actually make an attempt on the murderer? --&gt;

In [[engineering]] and [[machining]], an '''allowance''' is a planned deviation between an exact dimension and a [[Real versus nominal value|nominal]] or [[theoretical]] dimension, or between an intermediate-stage dimension and an intended final dimension. The unifying abstract concept is that a certain amount of difference ''allows for'' some known factor of compensation or interference. For example, an area of excess metal may be left because it is needed to complete subsequent machining. Common cases are listed below. An ''allowance,'' which is a ''planned'' deviation from an ideal, is contrasted with a ''[[Engineering tolerance|tolerance]],'' which accounts for expected but unplanned deviations.

Allowance is basically the size difference between components that work together. Allowance between parts that are assembled is very important. For example, the axle of a car has to be supported in a bearing otherwise it will fall to the ground. If there was no gap between the axle and the bearing then there would be a lot of friction and it would be difficult to get the car to move. If there was too much of a gap then the axle would be jumping around in the bearing. It is important to get the allowance between the axle and the bearing correct so that the axle rotates smoothly and easily without juddering. 

__TOC__

==Examples of engineering and machining allowances==

* Outer dimensions (such as the length of a bar) may be cut intentionally oversize, or inner dimensions (such as the diameter of a hole) may be cut intentionally undersize, to allow for a predictable dimensional change following future cutting, [[Grinding machine|grinding]], or [[Heat treatment|heat-treating]] operations. For example:
** the outer diameter of a pin may be ground to {{convert|0.0005|in|mm|3}} oversize because it is known that subsequent heat-treatment of the pin is going to cause it to shrink by {{convert|0.0005|in|mm|3}}.
** A hole may be drilled {{convert|0.012|in|mm|2}} undersize to allow for the material that will be removed by subsequent [[Reamer|reaming]].
* Outer dimensions (such as the diameter of a railroad car's axle) may be cut intentionally oversize, or inner dimensions (such as the diameter of the railroad car's wheel hub) may be cut intentionally undersize, to allow for an [[interference fit|interference fit (press fit)]].
* A part may be cast intentionally too big when it is desired to later machine the surface. This ensures that the roughness that the casting process leaves is removed, and a smooth machined surface is produced. This machining allowance may be e.g. 1mm, but this depends on the size of the part and the accuracy of the casting process.
* A chain segment may be oversized so that at the end of its useful service life (around 20 years), the corroded chain is still above the minimum diameter required to meet the minimum break strength.  This is called a corrosion allowance and accounts for the steel molecules lost through oxidation, erosion and wear, and Microbially Influenced Corrosion.

==Confounding of the engineering concepts of ''allowance'' and ''tolerance''==
{{see also|Engineering tolerance}}
Often the terms ''allowance'' and ''[[Engineering tolerance|tolerance]]'' are used inaccurately and are improperly interchanged in engineering contexts. This is logical because both words generally can relate to the abstract concept of permission — that is, of a limit on what is acceptable. However, in engineering, separate meanings are enforced, as explained below.

A tolerance is the limit of acceptable ''unintended'' deviation from a nominal or theoretical dimension. Therefore, a pair of tolerances, upper and lower, defines a range within which an actual dimension may fall while still being acceptable.

In contrast, an allowance is a ''planned'' deviation from the nominal or theoretical dimension.

=== Example ===
An example of the concept of tolerance is a shaft for a machine is intended to be precisely 10&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter: 10&amp;nbsp;mm is the ''nominal'' dimension. The engineer designing the machine knows that in reality, the [[grinding machine|grinding]] operation that produces the final diameter may introduce a certain small-but-unavoidable amount of random error. Therefore, the engineer specifies a tolerance of ±0.01&amp;nbsp;mm ("plus-or-minus" 0.01&amp;nbsp;mm).

As long as the grinding machine operator can produce a shaft with actual diameter somewhere between 9.99&amp;nbsp;mm and 10.01&amp;nbsp;mm, the shaft is acceptable. Understanding how much error is predictable in a process and how much is easily avoidable; how much is unavoidable (or whose avoidance is possible but simply too expensive to justify); and how much is truly acceptable involves considerable judgment, intelligence, and experience.

An example of the concept of allowance can be shown in relation to the hole that this shaft must enter. It is evident that the above shaft cannot be certain to freely enter a hole that is also 10&amp;nbsp;mm with the same tolerance. It might, if the actual shaft diameter is 9.99&amp;nbsp;mm and the actual hole diameter is 10.01&amp;nbsp;mm, but it would not if conversely the actual shaft diameter is 10.01&amp;nbsp;mm and the actual hole diameter is 9.99&amp;nbsp;mm.

To be sure that there will be enough clearance between the shaft and its hole, ''taking account of the tolerance,'' an ''allowance'' is ''intentionally'' introduced in the dimensions specified. The hole diameter might be specified as 10.03&amp;nbsp;mm with a manufacturing tolerance of ±0.01&amp;nbsp;mm ("plus-or-minus" 0.01&amp;nbsp;mm). This means that the smallest acceptable hole diameter will be 10.02&amp;nbsp;mm while the largest acceptable shaft diameter will be 10.04&amp;nbsp;mm, leaving an "allowance" of 0.01&amp;nbsp;mm. The minimum [[Engineering tolerance|clearance]] between the hole and the shaft will then be 0.01&amp;nbsp;mm. This will occur when both the shaft and the hole are at [[maximum material condition]].

[[File:An Antology of Chance Operations.jpg|thumb|right|Book cover.]]

'''''An Anthology of Chance Operations''''' (An Anthology) was an [[artist's book]] publication from the early 1960s of experimental [[neodada]] art and music composition that used [[John Cage]] inspired [[Aleatoric music|indeterminacy]]. It was edited by [[La Monte Young]] and [[DIY]] co-published in 1963 by Young and [[Jackson Mac Low]] in [[New York City]]. Its full title is: '''''An Anthology''''' of chance operations concept art anti-art indeterminacy improvisation meaningless work natural disasters plans of action stories diagrams Music poetry essays dance constructions mathematics compositions''. 

==Legacy==
The project became the manifestation of the original impetus for establishing [[Fluxus]].   

In autumn 1960 the editor of the magazine ''Beatitude'' magazine approached Young and Mac Low after a reading and asked them if they would guest-edit an issue of the East Coast edition of his magazine, ''Beatitude East''. Given free rein to include whoever and whatever he wanted, Young collected a large body of new and experimental music, [[anti art]], [[poetry]], essays and performance scores from America, Europe and Japan. The magazine, however, folded after only one issue, and the materials that Young had collected were never published until An Anthology of Chance Operations.

In June 1961 [[George Maciunas]], who had already begun plans to publish a magazine in the autumn of the same year, designed the book's layout and title pages, while others, including Mac Low, produced the typescript for the works themselves.

Although it can be argued&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon-noir.com/BOOKS/6_%20The_Fluxus_Reader_Ken_Friedman.pdf Fluxus Reader by [[Ken Friedman]]]&lt;/ref&gt; that An Anthology is not strictly a [[Fluxus]] publication, its development and production was a central event in the formation of Fluxus. It was the first collaborative publication project between people who were to become part of Fluxus: Young (editor and co-publisher), Mac Low (co-publisher) and Maciunas (designer).

The art dealer [[Heiner Friedrich]] issued a second edition in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ubu.com/historical/young/ An Anthology of Chance Operations]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2331">The concept of '''armed violence reduction (AVR)''' has gained significant in importance after the [[Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development|2006 Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development]]. According to [[OECD]], more than 740,000 people die each year as a result of the violence associated with [[armed conflict]]s and large- and small-scale [[criminality]]. Furthermore, armed violence impedes humanitarian and socio-economic development and, hence, it is an obstruction to achieving the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goals (MDG)]].

== Key numbers on armed violence from the Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development ==

* More than 740,000 people have died directly or indirectly from armed violence - both conflict and [[violent crime|criminal violence]] - every year in recent years.
* More than 540,000 of these deaths are violent, with the vast majority occurring in non-conflict settings.
* At least 200,000 people - and perhaps many thousands more - have died each year in conflict zones from non-violent causes (such as [[malnutrition]], [[dysentery]], or other easily preventable diseases) that resulted from the effects of war on populations.
* Between 2004 and 2007, at least 208,300 violent deaths were recorded in armed conflicts - an average of 52,000 people killed per year. This is a conservative estimate including only recorded deaths: the real total may be much higher.
* The annual economic cost of armed violence in non-conflict settings, in terms of lost [[productivity]] due to violent deaths, is [[USD]] 95 billion and could reach as high as USD 163 billion - 0.14 percent of the annual [[global GDP|global]] [[GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;Geneva Declaration key numbers: http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/Geneva-Declaration-Millennium-Development-Goals.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Armed violence reduction is therefore essential for the achievement of the [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref&gt;ɡ&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="71809">The '''behavioral analysis of child development''' originates from [[John B. Watson]]'s [[behaviorism]].&lt;ref&gt;Watson, J.B. (1926). What the nursery has to say about instincts. In C. Murchison (Eds.) ''Psychologies of 1925''. Worchester, MA: Clark University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Watson studied child development, looking specifically at development through conditioning (see [[Little Albert experiment]]). He helped bring a natural science perspective to child psychology by introducing objective research methods based on observable and measurable behavior. [[B.F. Skinner]] then further extended this model to cover [[operant conditioning]] and [[verbal behavior]]. Skinner was then able to focus these research methods on feelings and how those emotions can be shaped by a subject’s interaction with the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1974). ''About Behaviorism.'' Knopf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1953) ''Science and Human Behavior''. New York: The Free Press&lt;/ref&gt; Sidney Bijou (1955) was the first to use this methodological approach extensively with children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bijou |first=S.W. |year= 1955 |title=A systematic approach to an experimental analysis of young children |journal=Child Development |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=161–168 |pmid=13261293 |doi=10.2307/1126106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bijou |first=S.W. |year=1957 |title=Patterns of reinforcement and resistance to extinction in young children |journal=Child Development |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=47–54 |pmid=13404656 |doi=10.2307/1125999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bijou |first=S.W. |year=1958 |title=Operant extinction after fixed-interval schedules with young children |journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=25–29 |pmid=16811199 |pmc= 1403884 |doi=10.1901/jeab.1958.1-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1948, [[Sidney Bijou]] took a   position as associate professor of psychology at the University of Washington and served as director of the university’s Institute of Child Development. Under his leadership, the Institute added a child development clinic, nursery school classrooms, and a research lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morris|first=Edward K.|title=Sidney W. Bijou: The Illinois Years, 1965-1975|journal=Behavior Anal.|date=Fall 2008|volume=31|issue=2|pages=179–203|pmc=2591757|pmid=22478510}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bijou began working with [[Donald M. Baer|Donald Baer]] in the Department of Human Development and Family Life at the [[University of Kansas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Baer |first=D.M. |year=1993 |title=A brief, selective history of the Department of Human Development and Family Life at the University of Kansas: The early years |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=569–572 |pmid=16795815 |pmc=1297894 |doi= 10.1901/jaba.1993.26-569}}&lt;/ref&gt; applying [[behavior analytic]] principles to child development in an area referred to as "Behavioral Development" or "Behavior Analysis of Child Development".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bijou, S.W. |author2=Baer, D.M. |year=1961 |title=Child Development: Vol. 1: a Systematic and Empirical Theory |publisher=Prentice-Hall |isbn=0-13-130377-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner's behavioral approach and Kantor's interbehavioral approach were adopted in Bijou and Baer's model. They created a three-stage model of development (e.g., basic, foundational, and societal). Bijou and Baer looked at these socially determined stages, as opposed to organizing behavior into change points or cusps ([[behavioral cusp]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bosch |first=S. |last2=Hixson |first2=M.D. |year=2004 |title=The Final Piece to a Complete Science of Behavior: Behavior Development and Behavioral Cusps |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=244–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the behavioral model, development is considered a behavioral change. It is dependent on the kind of stimulus and the person’s behavioral and learning function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Baer |first=D.M. |year=1982 |title=Behavior analysis and developmental psychology: Discussant comments |journal=Human Development |volume=25 |pages=357–361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior analysis in child development takes a mechanistic, contextual, and pragmatic approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Morris |first=E.K. |year=1988 |title=Contextualism: The worldview of behavior analysis |journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=289–323 |doi=10.1016/0022-0965(88)90063-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Schlinger |first=H.D. |year=2004 |title=The almost blank slate: Making a case for human nurture |journal=Skeptic |volume=11 |pages=34–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its inception, the behavioral model has focused on prediction and control of the developmental process.&lt;ref&gt;Baer, D.M. (1973). The control of developmental process: Why wait? In J.R. Nesselrode &amp; H.W. Reese (Eds.) ''Life Span Developmental Psychology: Methodological Issues''. Oxford, England: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schlinger, H.D. 1995"&gt;Schlinger, H.D., Jr. (1995). ''A Behavior Analytic View of Child Development''. NY: Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; The model focuses on the analysis of a behavior and then synthesizes the action to support the original behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Catania, A.C. (1998). ''Learning'' (fourth edition). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The model was changed after [[Richard J. Herrnstein]] studied the [[matching law]] of choice behavior developed by studying of reinforcement in the natural environment. More recently, the model has focused more on behavior over time and the way that behavioral responses become repetitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Morris |first=E.K. |last2=Hursch |first2=D.E. |year=1982 |title=Behavior analysis and developmental psychology: Metatheoretical considerations |journal=Human Development |volume=25 |pages=344–349}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has become concerned with how behavior is selected over time and forms into stable patterns of responding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Reese |first=H.W. |year=2005 |title=A Conceptual Analysis of Selectionism: Parts I and II. |journal=Behavioral Development Bulletin |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=8–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Vyse |first=S. |year=2004 |title=Stability over time: Is behavior analysis a trait psychology? |journal=The Behavior Analyst |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=43–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; A detailed history of this model was written by Pelaez.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pelaez |year=1998 |title=Behavior analysis of development: History, theory, and research |journal=Mexican Journal of Behavior Analysis |volume=24 |pages=85–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Henry D. Schlinger, Jr. provided the first behavior analytic text since Bijou and Baer comprehensively showed how behavior analysis—a natural science approach to human behavior—could be used to understand existing research in child development.&lt;ref name= "Schlinger, H.D. 1995"/&gt; In addition, the quantitative behavioral developmental model by Commons and Miller is the first behavioral theory and research to address notion similar to stage.&lt;ref&gt;''Behavioral Development Bulletin'', 13 (1)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research methods==

The methods used to analyze behavior in [[child development]] are based on several types of measurements. [[Single-subject research]] with a [[longitudinal study]] follow-up is a commonly-used approach. Current research is focused on integrating [[single-subject design]]s through meta-analysis to determine the effect sizes of behavioral factors in development. Lag sequential analysis has become popular for tracking the stream of behavior during observations. Group designs are increasingly being used. Model construction research involves [[latent growth modeling]] to determine developmental trajectories and [[structural equation modeling]]. [[Rasch model|Rasch analysis]] is now widely used to show sequentiality within a developmental trajectory.

A recent methodological change in the behavioral analytic theory is the use of observational methods combined with lag sequential analysis can determine [[reinforcement]] in the natural setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Snyder |first=J.J. |last2=Patterson |first2=G.R. |year=1986 |title=The effects of consequences on patterns of social interaction: A quasi-experimental approach to [[reinforcement]] in the natural environment |journal=Child Development |volume=57 |issue=5 |pages=1257–1268 |pmid=3769609 |doi=10.2307/1130448 |jstor=1130448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantitative behavioral development===

The [[model of hierarchical complexity]] is a quantitative analytic theory of development. This model offers an explanation for why certain tasks are acquired earlier than others through developmental sequences and gives an explanation of the biological, cultural, organizational, and individual principles of performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Commons|first=M.L.|title=Formal, systematic, and metasystematic operations with a balance-beam task series: A reply to Kallio's claim of no distinct systematic stage|journal=Adult Development|year=1995|volume=2|issue=3|pages=193–199|doi=10.1007/bf02265717|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It quantifies the order of hierarchical complexity of a task based on explicit and mathematical measurements of behavior.

===Contingencies, uncertainty, and attachment===
The behavioral model of [[Attachment theory|attachment]] recognizes the role of uncertainty in an infant and the child’s limited communication abilities. Contingent relationships are instrumental in the behavior analytic theory, because much emphasis is put on those actions that produce parents’ responses.&lt;ref name="Cavell02"&gt;Cavell, T.A. &amp; Strand, P.S. (2002). Parent-Based interventions for aggressive, antisocial children: Adapting to a bilateral lens. In L. Kuczynski (Ed.) ''Handbook of dynamics in parent-child relations''. (pp. 395–419). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gewirtz, J.L. 1991 pp. 123"&gt;Gewirtz, J.L. &amp; Peláez-Nogueras, M. (1991). The attachment metaphor and the conditioning of infant separation protests. In J.L. Gewirtz &amp; W.M. Kurtines (Eds.), ''Intersections with attachment''. (pp. 123–144). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, G.R. (2002). The early development of coercive family processes. In J.B. Reid, G.R. Patterson &amp; J. Snyder, J.J. (Eds.). ''Antisocial behavior in children and adolescents: A Developmental analysis and model for intervention''. APA Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of contingency appears to be highlighted in other developmental theories,&lt;ref&gt;Watson, J.S. (1979). Perception of contingency as a determinant of social responsiveness. In E.B. Thoman (Ed.), Origins of the infant's social responsiveness. In E.B. Thoman (Ed.) ''Origins of the infant's social responsiveness''. (pp. 33–64). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; but the behavioral model recognizes that contingency must be determined by two factors:&lt;ref&gt;Gewirtz, J.L. &amp; Boyd, E.F. (1977). Experiments on mother-infant interaction underlying mutual attachment acquisition: The infant conditions the mother. In T. Alloway, P. Plinger &amp; L. Krames (Eds.). ''Attachment behavior''. (pp. 109–143). New York: Plenum Press&lt;/ref&gt; the efficiency of the action and that efficiency compared to other tasks that the infant might perform at that point. Both infants and adults function in their environments by understanding these contingent relationships. Research has shown that contingent relationships lead to emotionally satisfying relationships.&lt;ref name="Dunst 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dunst |first=C.J. |last2=Raab |first2=M. |last3=Trivette |first3=C.M. |last4=Parkey |first4=C. |last5=Gatens |first5=M. |last6=Wilson |first6=L.L.

Since 1961, behavioral research has shown that there is relationship between the parents’ responses to separation from the infant and outcomes of a “stranger situation.”.&lt;ref&gt;Gewirtz, J.L. (1961). A learning analysis of the effects of normal stimulation, privation, and deprivation on the acquisition of social motivation and attachment. In B.M. Foss (Ed.), ''Determinants of infant behaviour''. (pp. 213–229). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; In a study done in 2000, six  infants participated in a classic reversal design (see [[single-subject research]]) study that assessed infant approach rate to a stranger. If attention was based on stranger avoidance, the infant avoided the stranger. If attention was placed on infant approach, the infant approached the stranger.&lt;ref&gt;Gewirtz, J. &amp; Pelaez-Nogueras, M. (2000). Infant emotions under the positive-reinforcer control of caregiver attention and touch. In J.C. Leslie &amp; D. Blackman (Eds.), ''Issues in Experimental and Applied Analysis of Human Behavior''. (pp. 271–291). Reno, NV: Context Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent meta-analytic studies of this model of attachment based on contingency found a moderate effect of contingency on attachment, which increased to a large effect size when the quality of reinforcement was considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kassow |first=D.Z. |last2=Dunst |first2=C.J. |year=2004 |title=Relationship between parental contingent-responsiveness and attachment outcomes |url=http://www.researchtopractice.info/bridges/bridges_vol2_no4.pdf |journal=Bridges |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research on contingency highlights its effect on the development of both pro-social and anti-social behavior.&lt;ref name="Cavell02"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wahler |first=R.G. |last2=Herring |first2=M. |last3=Edwards |first3=M. |year=2001 |title=[[Coregulation]] of balance between children's prosocial approaches and acts of compliance: A pathway to mother–child cooperation? |journal=Journal of Clinical Child Psychology |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=473–478 |pmid=11708235 |doi=10.1207/S15374424JCCP3004_04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wahler |first=R.G. |last2=Bellamy |first2=A. |year=1997 |title=Generating reciprocity with conduct problem children and their mothers: The effectiveness of compliance teaching and responsive parenting |journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships (Special issue: Reciprocity and Bidirectionality) |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=549–564 |doi=10.1177/0265407597144009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wahler |first=R.G. |last2=Smith |first2=G.G. |year=1999 |title=Effective parenting as the integration of lessons and dialogue |journal=Journal of Child and Family Studies |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=135–149 |doi=10.1023/A:1022031716547}}&lt;/ref&gt; These effects can also be furthered by training parents to become more sensitive to children’s behaviors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dunst |first=C.J. |last2=Kassow |first2=D.Z. |year=2004 |title=Characteristics of interventions promoting parental sensitivity to child behavior |journal=Bridges |volume=2 |pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meta-analytic research supports the notion that attachment is operant-based learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dunst |first=C.J. |last2=Kassow |first2=D.Z. |year=2008 |title=Caregiver Sensitivity, Contingent Social Responsiveness, and Secure Infant Attachment |journal=Journal of Early and Intensive Behavioral Intervention |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=40–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An infant's sensitivity to contingencies can be affected by biological factors and environment changes. Studies show that being placed in erratic environments with few contingencies may cause a child to have conduct problems and may lead to depression. (see Behavioral Development and Depression below).&lt;ref&gt;Cairns, R.B. (1979). ''The analysis of social interaction: Methods, issues, and illustrations.'' Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quay, H.C. (1987). Patterns of delinquent behavior. In H.C. Quay (Ed.). ''Handbook of Juvenile Delinquency''. (pp. 118–138). New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; Research continues to look at the effects of learning-based attachment on [[moral development]]. Some studies have shown that erratic use of contingencies by parents early in life can produce devastating long-term effects for the child.&lt;ref&gt;Commons, M.L. (1991).

===Motor development===
Since Watson developed the theory of behaviorism, behavior analysts have held that [[motor development]] represents a conditioning process. This holds that crawling, climbing, and walking displayed by infants represents conditioning of biologically innate [[reflexes]]. In this case, the reflex of stepping is the respondent behavior and these reflexes are environmentally conditioned through experience and practice. This position was criticized by maturation theorists. They believed that the stepping reflex for infants actually disappeared over time and was not "continuous". By working with a slightly different theoretical model, while still using operant conditioning, [[Esther Thelen]] was  able to show that children's stepping reflex disappears as a function of increased physical weight. However, when infants were placed in water, that same stepping reflex returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Savelsbergh |first=G.J.P. |year=2005 |title=Discovery Of Motor Development: A Tribute To Esther Thelen |url= |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=243–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Thelen |first=E. |last2=Fisher |first2=D.M. |year= 1982 |title=Newborn stepping: An explanation for a 'disappearing reflex{{'-}} |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=760–775 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.18.5.760}}&lt;/ref&gt; This offered a model for the continuity of the stepping reflex and the progressive stimulation model for behavior analysts.

Infants [[relative deprivation|deprived]] of physical [[stimulation]] or the opportunity to respond were found to have delayed motor development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dennis |first=W. |year=1960 |title=Causes of retardation among institutional children: Iran |journal=Journal of Genetic Psychology |volume=96 |pages=47–59 |pmid=13815945 |doi=10.1080/00221325.1960.10534274}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dennis |first=W. |last2=Najarian |first2=P. |year=1957 |title=Infant development under environmental handicap |journal=Psychological Monograph |volume=71 |issue=7 |pages=1–13 |doi=10.1037/h0093705}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under conditions of extra stimulation, the motor behavior of these children rapidly improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sayegh |first=Y. |last2=Dennis |first2=W. |year=1965 |title=The effects of supplementary experience upon behavioral development of infants in institutions |journal=Child Development |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=81–90 |pmid=14296799 |doi=10.2307/1126782 |jstor=1126782}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research has shown that the use of a treadmill can be beneficial to children with motor delays including [[Down syndrome]] and cerebral palsy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Masiello |first=T. |last2=Tucker |year=2006 |title=Influences of treadmill training on the motor development of infants with and without disabilities |url=http://www.researchtopractice.info/bridges/bridges_vol4_no5.pdf |journal=Bridges |volume=4 |issue=5 |pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on opportunity to respond and the building of motor development continues today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cautilli |first=J.D. |last2=Dziewolska |first2=H. |year=2005 |title=A Brief Report: Can Contingent Imitation Reinforce Truck Lifting In A Three-Month-Old Infant? |url= |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=229–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dziewolska |first=H. |last2= Cautilli |first2=J.D. |year= 2006 |title=The Effects of a Motor Training Package on Minimally Assisted Standing Behavior in a Three-Month-Old Infant |url= |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=111–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cautilli |first=J.D. |last2=Dziewolska |first2=H. |year=2006 |title=Brief Report: The Use of Opportunity to Respond and Practice to increase efficiency of the stepping reflex in a five-month-old infant |url= |journal=Behavior Analyst Today |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=538–547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The behavioral development model of motor activity has produced a number of techniques, including [[operant]]-based [[biofeedback]] to facilitate development with success. Some of the stimulation methods such as operant-based biofeedback have been applied as treatment to children with [[cerebral palsy]] and even spinal injury successfully.&lt;ref&gt;Ince, L.; Brucker, B. &amp; Alba A.

San Diego: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Skinner, language learning depends on environmental variables, which can be mastered by a child through imitation, practice, and selective [[reinforcement]] including automatic reinforcement.

[[B.F. Skinner]] was one of the first psychologists to take the role of imitation in verbal behavior as a serious mechanism for acquisition.&lt;ref name="Skinner57"/&gt; He identified echoic behavior as one of his basic verbal operants, postulating that verbal behavior was learned by an infant from a verbal community. Skinner's account takes verbal behavior beyond an intra-individual process to an inter-individual process. He defined verbal behavior as "behavior reinforced through the mediation of others".&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1957), page 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noam Chomsky]] refuted Skinner’s assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Chomsky |first=N. |last2=Skinner |first2=B.F. |year=1959 |title=Review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior |journal=Language |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=26–58 |doi=10.2307/411334 |jstor= 411334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the behavioral model, the child is prepared to contact the contingencies to "join" the listener and speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Greer |first=R.D. |last2=Keohane |first2=D. |year=2006 |title=The Evolution of Verbal Behavior in Children |journal=Slp- Aba |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=111–140}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the very core, verbal episodes involve the rotation of the roles as speaker and listener.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Reese |first=H.W. |year=2004 |title=Private Speech and Other Forms of Self-Communication |url= |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=182–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skinner (1957).

Conversational units is a measure of socialization because they consist of verbal interactions in which the exchange is reinforced by both the speaker and the listener.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Greer |first=R.D. |last2=Ross |first2=D.E. |year=2004 |title=Verbal behavior analysis: A program of research in the induction and expansion of complex verbal behavior |journal=Journal of Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention |url= |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=141–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; H.C.

===Development of self===
Robert Kohelenberg and Mavis Tsai (1991) created a behavior analytic model accounting for the development of one’s “self”.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlenberg, R. &amp; Tsai, M. (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Their model proposes that verbal processes can be used to form a stable sense of who we are through behavioral processes such as [[stimulus control]]. Kohlenberg and Tsai developed [[functional analytic psychotherapy]] to treat psychopathological disorders arising from the frequent invalidations of a child’s statements such that “I” does not emerge.
Other behavior analytic models for personality disorders exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nelson-Gray |first=R.O. |last2=Mitchell |first2=J.T. |last3=Kimbrel |first3=N.A. |last4=Hurst |first4=R.M. |year=2007 |title=The Development and Maintenance of Personality Disorders: A Behavioral Perspective |url= |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=443–445}}&lt;/ref&gt; They trace out the complex biological–environmental interaction for the development of avoidant and borderline personality disorders. They focus on [[Reinforcement sensitivity theory]], which states that some individuals are more or less sensitive to reinforcement than others. Nelson-Grey views problematic response classes as being maintained by reinforcing consequences or through rule governance.

===Socialization===
Over the last few decades, studies have supported the idea that contingent use of [[reinforcement]] and [[punishment]] over extended periods of time lead to the development of both pro-social and anti-social behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eisenberg, N. |author2=Wolchik, S.A. |author3=Goldberg, L. |author4=Engel, I. |year=1992 |title=Parental values, reinforcement, and young children's prosocial behavior: a longitudinal study |journal=J Genet Psychol |volume=153 |issue=1 |pages=19–36 |pmid=1645156 |doi=10.1080/00221325.1992.10753699}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Snyder, J.J.; Patterson, G.R. 1995 371–91"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Snyder, J.J. |author2=Patterson, G.R. |year=1995 |title=Individual differences in social aggression: a test of a reinforcement model of socialization in the natural environment |journal=Behav Ther |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=371–91 |doi=10.1016/S0005-7894(05)80111-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Patterson, G.R. |year=2002 |title=Etiology and treatment of child and adolescent antisocial behavior |journal=Behav Analyst Today |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=133–45 |url=http://behavior-analyst-today.com/VOL-3/BAT-3-2.pdf |type = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; However research has shown that reinforcement is more effective than punishment when teaching behavior to a child. It has also been shown that modeling is more effective than “preaching” in developing pro-social behavior in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bryan |first=J.H. |last2=Walbek |first2=N.H. |year=1970 |title=Impact of words and deeds concerning altruism upon children |journal=Child Development |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=747–759 |doi=10.2307/1127221 |jstor=1127221}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bryan |first=J.H. |last2=Walbek |first2=N. |year=1970 |title=Preaching and practicing generosity: Children's action and reaction |journal=Child Development |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=329–353 |doi=10.2307/1127035 |jstor=1127035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rewards have also been closely studied in relation to the development of social behaviors in children.

The development of social skills in children is largely affected in that classroom setting by both teachers and peers. Reinforcement and punishment play major roles here as well.

Behavioral principles have also been researched in emerging peer groups, focusing on status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Coie |first=J.D. |last2=Kupersmidt |first2=J.B. |year=1983 |title=A Behavioral Analysis of Emerging Social Status in Boys' Groups. |journal=Child Development |volume=54 |issue=6 |pages=1400–1416 |doi=10.2307/1129803 |jstor=1129803}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that it takes different social skills to enter groups than it does to maintain or build one’s status in groups. Research also suggests that neglected children are the least interactive and aversive, yet remain relatively unknown in groups. 
Children suffering from social problems do see an improvement in social skills after [[behavior therapy]] and [[behavior modification]]  (see [[applied behavior analysis]]). Modeling has been successfully used to increase participation by shy and withdrawn children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jakibuchuk |first=Z. |last2=Smeriglio |first2=V.L. |year=1976 |title=The influence of symbolic modeling on the social behavior of preschool children with low levels of social responsiveness |journal=Child Development |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=838–841 |doi=10.2307/1128203 |jstor=1128203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaping of socially desirable behavior through [[positive reinforcement]] seems to have some of the most positive effects in children experiencing social problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/h0033226 |author=O'Connor, R.D. |year=1972 |title=Relative efficacy of modeling, shaping, and the combined procedure for the modification of social withdrawal |journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=327–334 |pmid=5033375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-social behavior===
In the development of [[anti-social behavior]], [[etiology|etiological models]] for anti-social behavior show considerable correlation with [[negative reinforcement]] and response matching (see [[matching law]]).&lt;ref name= "Patterson02"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Snyder |first=J. |last2=Stoolmiller |first2=M. |last3=Patterson |first3=G.R. |last4=Schrepferman |first4=L. |last5=Oeser |first5=J. |last6=Johnson |first6=K. |last7= Soetaert |first7=D. |year=2003 |title=The Application of Response Allocation Matching to Understanding Risk Mechanisms in Development: The Case of Young Children's Deviant Talk and Play, and Risk for Early-Onset Antisocial Behavior |url= |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=435–453}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aversives|Escape conditioning]], through the use of coercive behavior, has a powerful effect on the development and use of future anti-social tactics. The use of anti-social tactics during conflicts can be negatively reinforced and eventually seen as functional for the child in moment to moment interactions.&lt;ref name="Snyder, J.J.; Patterson, G.R. 1995 371–91"/&gt;
Anti-social behaviors will also develop in children when imitation is reinforced by social approval. If approval is not given by teachers or parents, it can often be given by peers. An example of this is swearing. Imitating a parent, brother, peer, or a character on TV, a child may engage in the anti-social behavior of swearing. Upon saying it they may be reinforced by those around them which will lead to an increase in the anti-social behavior. 
The role of [[stimulus control]] has also been extensively explored in the development of anti-social behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, G.R.; Reid, J.B. &amp; Eddy, J.M. (2002). A brief history of the Oregon model. In J.B. Reid, G.R. Patterson &amp; J. Snyder (Eds.) ''Antisocial behavior in children and adolescents: A developmental analysis and model for interventions''. APA Press&lt;/ref&gt;
Recent behavioral focus in the study of anti-social behavior has been a focus on rule-governed behavior. While correspondence for saying and doing has long been an interest for behavior analysts in normal development and typical socialization, recent conceptualizations have been built around families that actively train children in anti-social rules, as well as children who fail to develop rule control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Osnes |first=P.G. |last2=Adelinis |first2=J. |year=2005 |title=Correspondence Training, Rule Governance, Generalization, and Stimulus Control: Connections or Disconnections? |journal=Behavioral Development Bulletin |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=48–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bevill-Davis Alicia |author2=Clees Tom J. |author3=Gast David L. |year=2004 |title= Correspondence Training: A Review of the Literature |journal=JEIBI |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=14–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Peleaz |first=M. |last2=Moreno |first2=R. |year=1998 |title=A taxonomy of rules and their correspondence in rule governed behavior |journal=Mexican Journal of Behavior Analysis |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=197–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Snyder |first=J.J. |last2=McEachern |first2=A. |last3=Schrepferman |first3=L. |last4=Zettle |first4=R. |last5=Johnson |first5=K. |last6= Swink |first6=N. |last7=McAlpine |first7=C. |year=2006 |title=Rule-Governance, Correspondence Training, and Discrimination Learning: A Developmental Analysis of Covert Conduct Problems |journal=Slp-Aba |volume= 1 |issue=1 |pages=43–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Barry |first=L.M. |last2=Haraway |first2=D.L. |year=2005 |title=Behavioral Self-Control Strategies for Young Children |url= |journal=JEIBI |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=79–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental depression with origins in childhood===
Behavioral theory of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] was outlined by [[Charles Ferster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ferster |first=C.B. |year=1973 |title=A functional analysis of depression |journal=American Psychologist |volume=28 |issue=10 |pages=857–870 |pmid=4753644 |doi=10.1037/h0035605}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later revision was provided by Peter Lewisohn and Hyman Hops. Hops continued the work on the role of [[negative reinforcement]] in maintaining depression with Anthony Biglan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hops |first=H. |year=1992 |title=Parental depression and child behaviour problems: Implications for behavioural family intervention |journal= Behavior Change |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=126–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hops |first=H. |last2=Biglan |first2=A. |last3=Sherman |first3=L.

The most recent summary and conceptual revisions of the behavioral model was provided by Johnathan Kanter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kanter |first=J.W. |last2=Cautilli |first2=J.D. |last3=Busch |first3=A.M. |last4=Baruch |first4=D.E. |year=2005 |title=Toward a Comprehensive Functional Analysis of Depressive Behavior: Five Environmental Factors and a Possible Sixth and Seventh |url= |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=65–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard model is that depression has multiple paths to develop. It can be generated by five basic processes, including: lack or loss of [[positive reinforcement]],&lt;ref&gt;In addition to loss of reinforcement, the loss of contingency between behavior and reinforcement can also lead to depression&lt;/ref&gt; direct positive or negative reinforcement for depressive behavior, lack of rule-governed behavior or too much rule-governed behavior, and/or too much environmental [[punishment]]. For children, some of these variables could set the pattern for lifelong problems. For example, a child whose depressive behavior functions for [[negative reinforcement]] by stopping fighting between parents could develop a lifelong pattern of depressive behavior in the case of conflicts. Two paths that are particularly important are (1) lack or loss of reinforcement because of missing necessary skills at a developmental cusp point or (2) the failure to develop adequate rule-governed behavior. For the latter, the child could develop a pattern of always choosing the short-term small immediate reward (i.e., escaping studying for a test) at the expense of the long-term larger reward (passing courses in middle school). The treatment approach that emerged from this research is called [[behavioral activation]].

In addition, use of positive reinforcement has been shown to improve symptoms of depression in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rawson |first=H.E. |last2=Tabb |first2=L.C. |year=1993 |title=Effects of therapeutic intervention on childhood depression |journal=Child and Adolesent Social Work Journal |volume=10 |pages=39–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reinforcement has also been shown to improve the self-concept in children with depression comorbid with learning difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rawson |first=H.E. |last2=Cassady |first2=J.C. |year=1995 |title=Effects of therapeutic intervention on self-concepts of children with learning disabilities |journal=Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=19–31 |doi=10.1007/BF01876137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rawson and Tabb (1993) used reinforcement with 99 students (90 males and 9 females) aged from 8 to 12 with behavior disorders in a residential treatment program and showed significant reduction in depression symptoms compared to the control group.

===Cognitive behavior===

===Learned units and developmental retardation===
Behavior analysts have spent considerable time measuring learning in both the classroom and at home. In these settings, the role of  a lack of stimulation has often been evidenced in the development of mild and moderate mental retardation.&lt;ref&gt;Bijou, S.W. (1966). A functional analysis of retarded development. In N.R. Ellis (Ed.) ''International Review of Research in Mental Retardation''. NY: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work has focused on a model of "developmental retardation,".&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, C.R.; Hart, B.; Walker, D. &amp; Risley, T. (1994). The opportunity to respond and academic performance revisited: A behavioral theory of developmental retardation and its prevention. In R. Gardener, D.M. Sainato, J.O. Cooper, T.E. Heron, W.L. Heward, J. Eshleman &amp; T.A. Grossi (Eds.) ''Behavior analysis in education: Focus on measurably superior instruction''. (pp. 161–171) Pacific Grove, CA: Brookes-Cole&lt;/ref&gt; an area that emphasizes cumulative environmental effects and their role in developmental delays. To measure these developmental delays, subjects are given the opportunity to respond, defined as the instructional antecedent, and success is signified by the appropriate response and/or fluency in responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Greenwood |first=Ward |last2=Luze |year=2003 |title=The Early Communication Indicator (ECI) for Infants and Toddlers: What It Is, Where It's Been, and Where It Needs to Go |url= |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=383–392}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the learned unit is identified by the opportunity to respond in addition to given reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Greer |first=D. |last2=Keohane |first2=D. |last3=Healy |year=2002 |title=Quality and Comprehensive Applications of Behavior Analysis to Schooling |url= |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=120–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study employed this model by comparing students' time of instruction was in affluent schools to time of instruction in lower income schools. Results showed that lower income schools displayed approximately 15 minutes less instruction than more affluent schools due to disruptions in [[classroom management]] and [[behavior management]]. Altogether, these disruptions culminated into two years worth of lost instructional time by grade 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Greenwood |first=C.R. |last2=Carta |first2=J.J. |last3=Hart |first3=B. |last4=Kamps |first4=D. |last5=Terry |first5=D. |last6=Delquardi |first6=J.C. |last7=Walker |first7=D. |last8=Risley |first8=T.R. |last9= Risley |first9=T. |last10=Delquadri |first10=Joseph C. |year=1992 |title=Out of the laboratory and into the community: Twenty-six years of applied behavior analysis at Juniper Gardens Children Center |journal=American Psychologist |volume=47 |issue=11 |pages=1464–1474 |pmid=1482007 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.47.11.1464|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of behavior analytic research is to provide methods for reducing the overall number of children who fall into the retardation range of development by [[behavioral engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;Bijou, S.W. (1983). The prevention of mild and moderate retarded development. In F.J. Menolascino, R. Neman &amp; J.A. Stark (Eds.) ''Curative aspects of mental retardation: Biomedical and behavioral advances''. (pp. 223–241). Baltimore: Brookes.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart and Risely (1995, 1999) have completed extensive research on this topic as well.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, B. &amp; Risley, T.R. (1995). ''Meaningful differences in the everyday experience of young American children''. Baltimore: Brookes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hart, B. &amp; Risley, T.R. (1999). ''The social world of children learning to talk''. Baltimore: Brookes&lt;/ref&gt; These researchers measured the rates of parent communication with children of the ages of 2–4 years and correlated this information with the IQ scores of the children at age 9. Their analyses revealed that higher parental communication with younger children was positively correlated with higher IQ in older children, even after controlling for race, class, and socio-economic status. Additionally, they concluded a significant change in IQ scores required intervention with at-risk children for approximately 40 hours per week.

===Class formation===
The formation of class-like behavior has also been a significant aspect in the behavioral analysis of development. .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zentall |first=T.R. |last2=Galizio |first2=M. |last3=Critchfield |first3=T.S. |year=2002 |title=Categorization, concept learning, and behavior analysis: An introduction |journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=237–248 |pmid=12507002 |pmc=1284898 |doi=10.1901/jeab.2002.78-237}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research has provided multiple explanations to the development and formation of class-like behavior, including primary [[stimulus generalization]],&lt;ref&gt;Goldiamond, I.

Responses are organized based upon the particular form needed to fit the current environmental challenges as well as the functional consequences. An example of large response classes lies in contingency adduction,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Andronis |first=P.T. |last2=Lang |first2=T.V.J. |last3=Goldiamond |first3=I. |year=1997 |title=Contingency adduction of "symbolic aggression" by pigeon |journal=The Analysis of Verbal Behavior |volume=16 |pages=10–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is an area that needs much further research, especially with a focus on how large classes of concepts shift. For example, as [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]] observed, individuals have a tendency at the pre-operational stage to have limits in their ability to preserve information(Piaget &amp; Szeminska, 1952). While children’s training in the development of conservation skills has been generally successful,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bucher |first=B. |last2=Schneider |first2=R.E. |year=1973 |title=Acquisition and generalization of conservation by pre-schoolers, using operant training |journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=187–204 |doi=10.1016/0022-0965(73)90160-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Waghorn |first=L. |last2= Sullivan |first2=E.V. |year=1970 |title=The exploration of transition rules in conservation of quantity (substance) using film mediated modeling |journal=Acta Psychologica |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages= 65–80 |pmid=5497127 |doi=10.1016/0001-6918(70)90091-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; complications have been noted.&lt;ref name=Field1987&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Field |first=D. |year=1987 |title=A review of preschool conservation training: An analysis of analyses |journal=Developmental Review |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=210–251 |doi=10.1016/0273-2297(87)90013-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior analysts argue that this is largely due to the number of tool skills that need to be developed and integrated. Contingency adduction offers a process by which such skills can be synthesized and which shows why it deserves further attention, particularly by early childhood interventionists.

===Autism===
Ferster (1961) was the first researcher to posit a behavior analytic theory for [[autism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ferster |first=C.B. |year=1961 |title=Positive reinforcement and the behavioral deficits of autistic children |journal=Child Development |volume=32 |pages=437–456 |pmid=13699189 |doi=10.2307/1126210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferster's model saw autism as a by-product of social interactions between parent and child. Ferster presented an analysis of how a variety of contingencies of reinforcement between parent and child during early childhood might establish and strengthen a repertoire of behaviors typically seen in children diagnosed with autism. A similar model was proposed by Drash and Tutor (1993), who developed the contingency-shaped or behavioral incompatibility theory of autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Drash |first=P.W. |last2=Tudor |first2=R.M. |year=1993 |title=A functional analysis of verbal delay in preschool children: Implications for prevention and total recovery |journal=The Analysis of Verbal Behavior |volume=11 |pages=19–29|pmid=22477077 |pmc=2748560 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They identified at least six [[reinforcement]] paradigms that may contribute to significant deficiencies in verbal behavior typically characteristic of children diagnosed as austistic. They proposed that each of these paradigms may also create a repertoire of avoidance responses that could contribute to the establishment of a repertoire of behavior that would be incompatible with the acquisition of age-appropriate verbal behavior.
More recent models attribute [[autism]] to neurological and sensory models that are overly worked and subsequently produce the autistic repertoire. Lovaas and Smith (1989) proposed that children with autism have a mismatch between their nervous systems and the environment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lovaas |first=O.I. |last2=Smith |first2=T. |year=1989 |title=A comprehensive behavior theory of autistic children: Paradigm for research and treatment |journal=Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=17–29 |pmid=2671048 |doi=10.1016/0005-7916(89)90004-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Bijou and Ghezzi (1999) proposed a behavioral interference theory.&lt;ref&gt;Bijou, S.W. &amp; Ghezzi, P.M. (1999). The behavior interference theory of autistic behavior in young children. In P.M. Ghezzi, W.L. Williams &amp; J.E. Carr (Eds.), ''Autism: Behavior analytic perspectives''. (pp. 33–43). Reno, NV: Context Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, both the environmental mismatch model and the inference model were recently reviewed,&lt;ref&gt;Hixson, M.D.; Wilson, J.L.; Doty, S.J. &amp; Vladescu, J.C. (2008). A Review of the Behavioral Theories of Autism and Evidence for an Environmental Etiology. ''Journal of Speech-Language Pathology and Applied Behavior Analysis''. Special Compiled Issue 2.4 - 3.1, 46–59.&lt;/ref&gt; and new evidence shows support for the notion that the development of autistic behaviors are due to escape and avoidance of certain types of sensory stimuli. However, most behavioral models of autism remain largely speculative due to limited research efforts.

==Role in education==
One of the largest impacts of behavior analysis of child development is its role in the field of education. In 1968, Siegfried Englemann used [[operant conditioning]] techniques in a combination with rule learning to produce the [[direct instruction]] curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Engelmann, S. &amp; Carnine, D. (1991). ''Theory of instruction: Principles and applications''. Eugene, OR: ADI Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Englemann |first=S.E. |year=1968 |title=Relating operant techniques to programming and teaching |journal=Journal of School Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=89–96 |doi=10.1016/0022-4405(68)90002-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Fred S. Keller]] used similar techniques to develop [[programmed instruction]]. [[B.F. Skinner]] developed a programmed instruction curriculum for teaching handwriting. One of Skinner's students, [[Ogden Lindsley]], developed a standardized semilogrithmic chart, the "Standard Behavior Chart," now "Standard Celeration Chart," used to record frequencies of behavior, and to allow direct visual comparisons of both frequencies and changes in those frequencies (termed "celeration"). The use of this charting tool for analysis of instructional effects or other environmental variables through the direct measurement of learner performance has become known as [[precision teaching]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Calkin, A.B. |year=2005 |title=Precision teaching: the standard celeration charts |journal=Behav Analyst Today |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=207–16 |url= |type = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavior analysts with a focus on behavioral development form the basis of a movement called [[positive behavior support]] (PBS). PBS has focused on building safe schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Scott |first=T.M. Gagnon |last2=Nelson |first2=C.M. |year=2008 |title=School-Wide Systems of Positive Behavior Support: A Framework for Reducing School Crime and Violence |journal=Journal of Behavior Analysis of Offender and Victim: Treatment and Prevention |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=69–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In education, there are many different kinds of learning that are implemented to improve skills needed for interactions later in life. Examples of this differential learning include social and language skills.&lt;ref&gt;"Child Development" Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory. 2001. 5 February 2008. http://www.nwrel.org/request/june01/child.html&lt;/ref&gt; According to the NWREL (Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory), too much interaction with technology will hinder a child's social interactions with others due to its potential to become an addiction and subsequently lead to anti-social behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Meltz, Barbara F. "Zora and the explorer" ''The Boston Globe'' October 22, 2007 Globe Newspaper Company 5 February 2008 http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2007/10/22/zora_and_the_explorer&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of language development, children will start to learn and know about 5–20 different words by 18 months old.&lt;ref&gt;"Language Development In Children" Child Development Institute, LLC 1998–2007. 5 February 2008. http://www.childdevelopmentinfo.com/development/language_development.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques of behavioral approach and new developments==
Behavior analytic theories have been criticized for their focus on the explanation of the acquisition of relatively simple behavior (i.e., the behavior of nonhuman species, of infants, and of individuals who are intellectually disabled or autistic) rather than of complex behavior (see Commons &amp; Miller).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Commons |first=M.L. |last2=Miller |first2=P.M. |year=2001 |title=A Quantitative Behavioral Model of Developmental Stage Based upon the Model of Hierarchical Complexity |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=222–252}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Commons]] continued [[behavior analysis]]'s rejection of [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalism]] and the substitution of a [[task analysis]] of the particular skills to be learned. In his new model, Commons has created a behavior analytic model of more complex behavior in line with more contemporary quantitative behavior analytic models called the [[model of hierarchical complexity]]. Commons constructed the model of hierarchical complexity of tasks and their corresponding stages of performance using just three main axioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Commons |first=M.L. |last2=Miller |first2=P.M. |year=1998 |title=A quantitative behavior-analytic theory of development |journal=Mexican Journal of Experimental Analysis of Behavior |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=153–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Commons |first=M.L. |last2=Trudeau |first2=E.J. |last3=Stein |first3=S.A. |last4=Richards |first4= F.A. |last5=Krause |first5=S.R. |year=1998 |title=Hierarchical Complexity of Tasks Shows the Existence of Developmental Stages |journal=Developmental Review |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=237–278 |doi=10.1006/drev.1998.0467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the study of development, recent work has been generated regarding the combination of behavior analytic views with dynamical systems theory.&lt;ref&gt;Novak, G. &amp; Pelaez, M. (2004). ''Child and adolescent development: A behavioral systems approach''. Sage&lt;/ref&gt; The added benefit of this approach is its portrayal of how small patterns of changes in behavior in terms of principles and mechanisms over time can produce substantial changes in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Novak |first=G. |last2=Pelaez |first2=M. |year=2002 |title=A behavior-analytic developmental model is better |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=25 |pages=466–468 |doi=10.1017/s0140525x02340081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current research in behavior analysis attempts to extend the patterns learned in childhood and to determine their impact on [[adult development]].

==Professional organizations==
The [[Association for Behavior Analysis]] International has a special interest group for the behavior analysis of child development.

Doctoral level behavior analysts who are psychologists belong to [[American Psychological Association]]'s division 25: [[behavior analysis]].

The World Association for Behavior Analysis has a certification in behavior therapy. The exam draws questions on behavioral theories of child development as well as behavioral theories of child psychopathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baojournal.com/WCBA/WCBA.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110222511/http://www.baojournal.com/WCBA/WCBA.html |archivedate=2011-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concept is usually perceived as a regularity in events or objects or in their records. While constructing a [[concept map]], it is essential to keep in mind that the concept be built with reference to a focus question. Hence, initially, the focus question to which we seek to answer is carefully chosen because learners usually tend to deviate from this question relating only to domains and thus, fails to answer the question.

With the selected domain and the focus question, the next step is to identify the key concepts which apply to this domain.About 15 to 25 concepts is sufficient which is usually ordered in a rank ordered list. Such list should be established from the most general and inclusive concept for the particular chosen problem. This list will assist in at least in the beginning of the construction of the concept map. The list is referred to as Parking Lot since the list is constantly shuffled to build up the required network of the concept. Two or more concepts are connected to each other using linking words or phrases which can only then complete a meaningful sentence.Another important characteristics of a concept map is the [[cross-link]]s.  This cross link acts as the relationship between two different domains  used in the concept map.This helps in a clear representation of the knowledge contained in the concept and also gives a clear background with specific examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmu.edu/teaching/assessment/howto/assesslearning/conceptmaps.html |title=Concept Maps - Enhancing Education - Carnegie Mellon University |publisher=Cmu.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cropping''' is the removal of a person's [[ear]]s as an act of physical punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Stronghold Knights|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was performed along with the [[pillory]]ing or immobilisation in the [[stocks]],&lt;ref name="Warner"&gt;{{harvtxt|Warner|2005|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Corlew163"&gt;{{harvtxt|Corlew|Folmsbee|Mitchell|1990|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes alongside punishments such as [[human branding#As punishment|branding]] or fines.&lt;ref name="Warner" /&gt;  The punishment is described in [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]''.&lt;ref name="Hugo"&gt;{{harvtxt|Hugo|1831|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Cropping sometimes occurred as a standalone punishment (such as in the case of [[William Prynne]] for [[seditious libel]]),&lt;ref name="DuCane"&gt;{{harvtxt|Du Cane|2005|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; where criminals' ears would be cut off with a [[blade]].  Cropping was also a secondary punishment to having criminals' ears nailed to the pillory (with the intention that their body movements would tear them off).&lt;ref name="DuCane" /&gt;  In 1538 [[Thomas Barrie]] spent a whole day with his ears nailed to the pillory in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]], England, before having them cut off to release him.&lt;ref name="Ford"&gt;{{harvtxt|Ford|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Cropping is mentioned in ancient [[Assyrian law]] and the Babylonian [[Code of Hammurabi]].

Cropping was quite rare in [[England]], but more common in [[Guernsey]].&lt;ref name="Ogier14"&gt;{{harvtxt|Ogier|1996|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable cases of cropping in England include [[Thomas Barrie]] in 1538, who reputedly died from [[Acute stress reaction|shock]] following his cropping,&lt;ref name="Ford" /&gt; and [[John Bastwick]], [[William Prynne]], and [[Henry Burton (Puritan)|Henry Burton]] in 1637.&lt;ref name="Dearmer"&gt;{{harvtxt|Dearmer|2009|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16th century, Henry VIII amended the laws on [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] to decree that first offences would be punished with three days in the stocks, second offences with cropping, and third offences with [[hanging]].&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;{{harvtxt|Adams|1998|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Records show that croppings took place in the [[United States]] in the late 18th century, particularly in states such as [[Pennsylvania]]&lt;ref name="Warner" /&gt; and [[Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="Corlew163" /&gt;
 
From page 153 of Reverend Samuel Peters’, General History of Connecticut, during the colonial period we have this account:

“Newhaven is celebrated for giving the name of “Pumpkin Heads” to all of New Englanders. It originated from the “Blue Laws” which enjoined every male to have his hair cut round by a cap. When caps are not to be had, they substituted a hard shell of a pumpkin, which being put on the head every Saturday, the hair is cut by the shell all round the head…….. and fourthly, such persons as have lost their ears for heresy, and other wickedness, cannot conceal their misfortune and disgrace.”

In [[Rhode Island]], cropping was a punishment for crimes such as [[Counterfeit money|counterfeiting money]], [[perjury]], and "burning houses, barns, and outbuildings" (but not amounting to [[arson]]).&lt;ref name="PDS"&gt;{{harvtxt|Prison Discipline Society|1826|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cropping (along with the pillory and stocks) was abolished in Tennessee in 1829, with abolition further afield starting from approximately 1839.&lt;ref name="Kellaway"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kellaway|2003|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10996">'''Death by boiling''' is a method of [[execution (legal)|execution]] in which a person is killed by being immersed in a [[boiling]] liquid. While not as common as other methods of execution, boiling to death has been used in many parts of [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Bhai Dayala Ji being boiled alive by the Muslim Moguls 1675 A.D.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Sikh martyr [[Bhai Dayala]] being boiled alive by the orders of Mughul Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] in November 1675 A.D.]] --&gt;
Executions of this type were often carried out using a large vessel such as a [[cauldron]] or a sealed [[kettle]] that was filled with a liquid such as water, oil, [[tar]], or [[tallow]], and a [[Pulley|hook and pulley]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Abbott, ''Execution blunders'', pages 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical practice==

===Europe===
[[File:Deventer ketel.jpg|thumb|upright|Execution cauldron at [[Deventer]] ([[Netherlands]])]]
In England, the 9th statute passed in 1531 (the 22nd year of the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]) made boiling alive the prescriptive form of capital punishment for murder committed by [[poison]]ing, which by the same Act was defined as [[High Treason]].&lt;ref&gt;'Anno 22 Henry VIII (1530-31), Chapter 9', in ''The Statutes of the Realm'' Vol. 3: The Statutes of King Henry VIII, (By Command 1817), Reprint (Dawsons of Pall Mall, London 1963), [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000017915533;view=1up;seq=382 p. 326] (Hathi Trust).&lt;/ref&gt; This arose from an incident in which the [[John Fisher|Bishop of Rochester's]] cook, [[Richard Roose]], gave several people poisoned [[porridge]], resulting in two deaths in February 1531.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kesselring| first = K.J.| date = Sep 2001|title = A Draft of the 1531 'Acte for Poysoning'|jstor = 579196| pages = 894–899 | publisher = The English Historical Review Vol. 116, No. 468}}&lt;/ref&gt; A partial confession having been extracted by torture, the sentence was thus imposed by [[attainder]] and without [[benefit of clergy]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Boiling to Death|volume=4|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary chronicle reports the following:&lt;ref&gt;(S.H.

{{quote|He roared mighty loud, and divers women who were big with child did feel sick at the sight of what they saw, and were carried away half dead; and other men and women did not seem frightened by the boiling alive, but would prefer to see the headsman at his work.}}
Boiling to death was employed again in 1542 for a woman, Margaret Davy,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} who had also used poison.&lt;ref name=Newlin2000&gt;{{Citation | last = Newlin | first = George | year = 2000 | title = Understanding Great expectations | pages = 136 | isbn = 978-0-313-29940-7 | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Conn. | oclc = 41488673 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, Frank, Frank Leslie, and Ellery Sedgwick. 1876.

Scotland has several traditions of persons boiled to death. For example, in 1222, with the consent of [[Jon Haraldsson]], the "Bloody Earl" of [[Orkney]], the bishop of [[Caithness]] [[Adam of Melrose]] and a monk named Surlo, are said to have been boiled to death by angry husbandmen over the bishop's aggressive means of collecting tithes. [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]] is said to have executed upwards to eighty persons as a punishment for the crime,  and the earl fled his lands.&lt;ref&gt;Pinkerton: "[https://books.google.com/books?id=mFJBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA158 A General Collection of the Best and Most Interesting Voyages], Volume 3", London 1809, p.158 The same tradition is transmitted in {{Cite book | last =Journal| first =| year =1842| title = The Scottish journal of topography, antiquities, traditions| pages =248| isbn = | publisher = Stevenson and Menzies| location =Edinburgh| oclc =}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Melrose Chronicle]], Adam of Melrose was "burned alive", rather than boiled, and Alexander III executed up to 400.&lt;ref&gt;''Soc.

The nobles are said each to have taken a spoonful of the brew afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=6NE9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA34 The new statistical account of Scotland, Volum 18]", Edinburgh 1838, pp.34-35&lt;/ref&gt;

Boiling as an execution method was also used for [[counterfeiter]]s, [[swindler]]s and [[forger|coin forger]]s during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Monter|first=E. William |title=A bewitched duchy: Lorraine and its dukes, 1477-1736|publisher=Librairie Droz|year=2007|page=163|ISBN=978-2-600-01165-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], for example, being boiled to death in oil is recorded for [[forger|coin forgers]] and extremely grave murderers. In 1392, a man was boiled alive in Nuremberg for having raped and murdered his own mother.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, M.M: "[https://books.google.com/books?id=HS1BAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA102 Kleine Chronik der Reichsstadt Nürnberg: Mit einem Grundrisse], Nuremberg 1847 p.102,&lt;/ref&gt; Coin forgers were boiled to death in 1452 in [[Danzig]]&lt;ref&gt;Krüger, J.G: "[https://books.google.com/books?id=RnMAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA20 Die beglückte und geschmückte Stadt Lübeck]", 1697, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1471 in [[Stralsund]].&lt;ref&gt;

In the Dutch town of [[Deventer]], the kettle that was used for boiling criminals to death can still be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetware.com/deventer/weigh-house-nl-ov-dwh.htm|title=10 Top Tourist Attractions in Arnhem &amp; Easy Day Trips - PlanetWare|author=|date=|website=planetware.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
[[File:Excecution of Goemon Ishikawa.jpg|thumb|upright|Bandit [[Ishikawa Goemon]] was boiled to death for the attempted assassination of warlord [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] in 16th-century Japan.]]
In 16th-century Japan, the semi-legendary Japanese bandit [[Ishikawa Goemon]] was boiled alive in a large iron kettle-shaped bathtub.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pixelmap.ca/gallery2/rumi/japan_2010/IMG_2189.jpg.html Goemonburo - Goemon-style bath] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706193636/http://www.pixelmap.ca/gallery2/rumi/japan_2010/IMG_2189.jpg.html |date=July 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His public execution, which might have included his entire family, was done after he failed to kill warlord [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]].

In 1675, a [[Sikh]] [[martyr]], called [[Bhai Dayala]], was boiled to death in [[Delhi]] after he refused to accept [[Islam]]. He was put into a [[cauldron]] full of cold water which was then heated to boiling point. Sikh scriptures record that Dayala recited the [[Japji]] of [[Guru Nanak]] and the [[Sukhmani]] of [[Guru Arjan]] as he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singha|first=H. S |title=The encyclopedia of Sikhism|publisher=Hemkunt Press|year=2000|page=56|ISBN=978-81-7010-301-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern times===
The government of [[Uzbekistan]] under [[Islam Karimov]] has been alleged to have boiled suspected terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Uzbekistan: Two Brutal Deaths in Custody|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/08/09/uzbekistan-two-brutal-deaths-custody|accessdate=6 January 2015|publisher=Hrw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2004 document from [[US Department of State]], the following is written:{{quote|During the year, there were no developments or investigations in the following 2002 deaths in custody: Mirzakomil Avazov and Khusnuddin Olimov, members of [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] who were tortured to death in [[Jaslyk Prison]] in [[Karakalpakstan]] resulting in extensive bruises and burns, the latter reportedly caused by immersion in boiling water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2003/27873.htm|title=Uzbekistan|author=|date=|website=state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}Former ISIS commander Abu Abboud al-Raqqawi referred to ISIS' brutal execution methods, among others, boiling prisoners alive in engine oil:

{{quote|Some people were boiled alive in oil. Engine oil. They burned wood on a fire for an hour before throwing the victim into boiling oil. It's the Tunisians who were responsible for that.[https://www.expressen.se/nyheter/qs/avhoppade-ledaren-talar-ut-om-livet-med-is/]}}

==Depictions in Western culture==
Early reports of [[cannibals]] from islands in the Pacific, such as [[Fiji]] or [[Papua New Guinea]], killing western [[Christian missionaries]] were assumed to involve some form of boiling alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thatsweird.net/news19.shtml|title=Villagers apologize for cannibal ancestors eating missionary: Weird News, Strange But True Stories, Odd Facts, Bizarre|author=|date=|website=www.thatsweird.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became a fertile ground for film makers and especially cartoonists, whose clichéd depiction of tourists or missionaries sitting restrained in a large cauldron above a wood fire and surrounded by bone-nosed tribesmen was a staple of popular magazines and film for decades. Examples include the dream sequence in the movie ''[[Bagdad Café]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiefilm.com/cookbook/encyclopedia/ecmB.html|title=Encyclopedia of Cannibal Movies: B|first=Satellite Ground|last=Systems|date=|website=www.indiefilm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''digital matte artist''', or '''digital matte painter''' (DMP), is today's modern form of a traditional [[Matte painting|matte painter]] in the [[List of entertainment industry topics|entertainment industry]]. He or she digitally paints photo-realistic interior and exterior environments that could not have been otherwise created or visited.

The term 'digital' is used to distinguish a DMP from a traditional matte painter, although this is unnecessary, as the nature of a matte painter's work remains the same, regardless of the tools and techniques used. [[Craig Barron]], the co-founder of [[Matte World Digital]], offered an insight regarding the transition of the art from traditional to digital in the following words:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is difficult to categorize what a matte painting shot is today... Most filmmakers still call what we do matte shots, and we like that because we see our work as an extension of the original craft. But it's more accurate to say we are involved in environment creation. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art Direction and Production Design|last=Fischer|first=Lucy|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780813564364|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== From traditional to digital ==
Traditional matte painting is older than the movie camera itself and has actually been already practiced in the early years of photography to create painted elements in photographs. With the advantages of the digital age, matte painters have slowly transitioned to a digital work environment, using pressure-sensitive pens and graphic tablets in conjunction with a painting software such as [[Adobe Photoshop]]. A digital matte painter is part of a visual effects team being involved in [[post-production]], as opposed to a traditional matte painter, who was a member of a special effects crew, often creating matte paintings on set to be used as backdrops. 

One particular drawback to the work of the digital matte artist is an occasional tendency of their output to look too realistic, which traditional artists avoided by using [[Impressionism|impressionistic]] elements or by suggesting details.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Special Effects: An Introduction to Movie Magic|last=Miller|first=Ron|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|year=2006|isbn=0761329188|location=Minneapolis, Minnesota|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; What this means is that digital matte art is often characterized by an artificially perfect look. One of the modern approaches adopted to address this is the integration of details from a photograph, say, of real places to depict realistic scenes. It is this reason why some digital matte artists refer to their work as a combination of digital painting, photo manipulation, and 3D, for the purpose of creating virtual sets that are hard or impossible to find in the real world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Art Masters:, Volume 3|last=3Dtotal|first=|publisher=Elsevier|year=2008|isbn=9780240521190|location=Boston|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Workflow and skillset ==
The involvement of the digital matte artist in film production vary. However, there are artists such as [[Mathieu Raynault]] who stated that they are often brought into the production at a very early stage, providing sketches and concepts to get a dialogue started with the director or art director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cinematic Game Secrets for Creative Directors and Producers: Inspired Techniques From Industry Legends|last=Newman|first=Rich|publisher=Focal Press|year=2009|isbn=9780240810713|location=Boston|pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raynault was involved on films like ''[[300 (film)|300]], [[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones]]'', and two [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''Lord of the Rings'']] films, among others.

Through the growing need for 'moving' mattes [[3D projection|camera projection mapping]] has been implemented into the matte painting pipeline. Although ILM CG Supervisor [[Stefen Fangmeier]] came up with the idea of projecting Yusei Uesugi's aerial painting of Neverland onto a 3D mesh modeled by Geoff Campbell while working on the motion picture [[Hook (film)|''Hook'']] in 1991, projection-mapping based 3D environment matte art was until recently, like its predecessor matte painting has been, the industry's best-kept secret. The involvement of 3D in this until then 2D art form was revealed by Craig Barron in 1998 after completing their work on the feature film [[Great Expectations (2012 film)|''Great Expectations'']] when they introduced this technique as a 2.5D matte to the public. In production today this combination of 2D and 3D is part of every matte artist's bread and butter.

Because of their high artistic skills, digital matte artists are often also involved with the creation of [[concept art]]work.

The '''Edith-Russ-Haus für Medienkunst''' ("Edith Russ House") is an [[art gallery]] in the city of [[Oldenburg]], [[Lower Saxony]], [[Germany]], dedicated to [[new media art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.oldenburg.de/startseite/kultur/museen-kunsthaeuser/edith-russ-haus.html | title=Edith-Russ-Haus für Medienkunst | website=[http://www.oldenburg.de/ Stadt Oldenburg] | location=Germany | language=German | accessdate=13 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gallery was founded due to an endowment from [[Edith Russ]], a secondary school teacher in Oldenburg. It does not have a permanent collection but presents temporary exhibitions and associated events. The building is close to the [[Peter-Friedrich-Ludwig-Hospital]], a cultural centre and former hospital, located to the southwest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1762">'''Ethical formalism''' is a type of [[Ethics|ethical]] theory which defines moral judgments in terms of their [[logic]]al form (e.g., as "laws" or "universal prescriptions") rather than their content (e.g., as judgments about what actions will best promote human well-being). The term also often carries critical connotations. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], for example, has been criticized for defining morality in terms of the formal feature of being a "universal law", and then attempting to derive from this formal feature various concrete moral duties.

Ethical formalism is related to, but not identical to, [[Harry J. Gensler]]'s relatively recent (circa 1996) theory of [[formal ethics]].  Formal ethics is similar to ethical formalism in that it focuses on formal features of moral judgments, but is distinct in that the system of formal ethics is explicitly (and intentionally) incomplete.  Specifically, while some ethical formalist systems (e.g., arguably Kant's "universal laws") view a set of formal features as both necessary and sufficient, formal ethics views such formal features as necessary but not sufficient.

Ethical formalism is "considered as an absolutist system, if something is wrong, it is wrong all the time" (Pollock, 2004). Just the same, if something is right, it is then right all the time.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; applying at all levels of scale in biological organisms.

The theory asserts that energy and structure (also information) become synonymous in complex biological structures via a self-organizing, multiple-scale catalytic process (thus: bioenergetics = bioinformatics) – the proposed mechanism involving the catalytic action of [[soliton]] propagation in (biological) [[excitable media]].&lt;ref name="Davia2006"/&gt; The theory resolves problems (particularly problems associated with brain function) arising from an assumed distinction between function and metabolism. The theory attempts to show that no such distinction exists; thus: FUNCTION = METABOLISM = CATALYSIS.&lt;ref name="Davia2006"/&gt;

'''Greed''', or '''avarice''', is an inordinate or insatiable longing for material gain, be it [[food]], [[wealth|money]], [[Social status|status]], or [[Power (social and political)|power]].

As a secular psychological concept, greed is an inordinate [[desire (emotion)|desire]] to acquire or possess more than one needs. The degree of inordinance is related to the inability to control the reformulation of "wants" once desired "needs" are eliminated. [[Erich Fromm]] described greed as "a bottomless pit which exhausts the person in an endless effort to satisfy the need without ever reaching satisfaction." It is typically used to criticize those who seek excessive material wealth, although it may apply to the need to feel more [[self-righteousness|excessively moral]], [[popularity|social]], or otherwise [[narcissism|better than]] someone else.

The purpose for greed, and any actions associated with it, is possibly to deprive others of potential means (perhaps, of basic survival and comfort) or future opportunities accordingly, or to obstruct them therefrom, thus insidious and [[Tyranny|tyrannical]] or otherwise having a negative connotation. Alternately, the purpose could be defense or counteraction from such dangerous, potential negotiation in matters of questionable agreeability. A consequence of greedy activity may be an inability to sustain any of the [[cost]]s or burdens associated with that which has been or is being accumulated, leading to a [[Back-fire|backfire]] or destruction, whether of self or more generally. So, the level of "inordinance" of greed pertains to the amount of [[vanity]], [[Malice (law)|malice]] or burden associated with it.

== Views ==
[[Thomas Aquinas]] says that greed "is a sin against God, just as all mortal sins, in as much as man condemns things eternal for the sake of temporal things."&lt;ref name="st3118"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3118.htm |publisher=New Advent |author=Thomas Aquinas |title=The Summa Theologica II-II.Q118 (The vices opposed to liberality, and in the first place, of covetousness) |edition=1920, Second and Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|A1}} In Dante's ''[[Purgatorio|Purgatory]]'', the avaricious penitents were bound and laid face down on the ground for having concentrated too much on earthly thoughts.


[[Meher Baba]] dictated that "Greed is a state of restlessness of the heart, and it consists mainly of craving for power and possessions. Possessions and power are sought for the fulfillment of desires. Man is only partially satisfied in his attempt to have the fulfillment of his desires, and this partial satisfaction fans and increases the flame of craving instead of extinguishing it. Thus greed always finds an endless field of conquest and leaves the man endlessly dissatisfied. The chief expressions of greed are related to the emotional part of man."&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967). ''Discourses.'' Volume II. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ivan Boesky]] famously defended greed in an 18 May 1986 commencement address at the [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]]'s [[Haas School of Business|School of Business]] Administration, in which he said, "Greed is all right, by the way. I want you to know that. I think greed is healthy. You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself".&lt;ref name="Gabriel"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gabriel |first=Satya J |title=Oliver Stone's ''Wall Street'' and the Market for Corporate Control |work=Economics in Popular Film |publisher=Mount Holyoke |date=November 21, 2001 |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/sgabriel/filmcourse/oliver_stone.html |accessdate=2008-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This speech inspired the 1987 film ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'', which features the famous line spoken by [[Gordon Gekko]]: "Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right, greed works. Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed, in all of its forms; greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge has marked the upward surge of mankind."&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ross |first=Brian |title=Greed on Wall Street |work=[[ABC News]] |publisher= |date=November 11, 2005 |url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=1305010 |accessdate=2008-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inspirations ==
[[Scavenging]] and [[hoarding]] of materials or objects, theft and [[robbery]], especially by means of violence, trickery, or manipulation of [[authority]] are all actions that may be inspired by greed. Such misdeeds can include [[simony]], where one profits from soliciting goods within the actual confines of a church.
A well-known example of greed is the pirate [[Hendrick Lucifer]], who fought for hours to acquire Cuban gold, becoming mortally wounded in the process. He died of his wounds hours after having transferred the booty to his ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dream-the-impossible.blogspot.com/2009/01/greed-is-good-discuss.html |title=Examples of greed |author=Dreamtheimpossible |date=September 14, 2011 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=October 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118071652/http://dream-the-impossible.blogspot.com/2009/01/greed-is-good-discuss.html |archivedate=January 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetics ==
Some research suggests there is a genetic basis for greed. It is possible people who have a shorter version of the [[ruthlessness gene]] (AVPR1a) may behave more selfishly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080404/full/news.2008.738.html 'Ruthlessness gene' discovered]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contains Arabic text|section}}
'''''Hikmah''''' (also '''''Hikmat''''', {{lang-ar|حكمة}}, ''{{transl|ar|ḥikma}}'', literally [[wisdom]], philosophy; rationale, underlying reason,&lt;ref name="wehr"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wehr|first1=Hans|editor1-last=Cowan|editor1-first=J. Milton|title=A DIctionary of Modern Written Arabic, Arabic-English|date=1961|publisher=MacDonald &amp; Evans Ltd.|page=197|edition=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a concept in [[Islamic philosophy]] and law.

[[Mulla Sadra]] defined ''hikmah'' as "coming to know the essence of beings as they really are" or as "a man's becoming an intellectual world corresponding to the objective world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Cooper|first=John|title=Mulla Sadra (Sadr al-Din Muhammad al-Shirazi) (1571/2-1640)|editor-first=Edward|editor-last=Craig|encyclopedia=[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|volume=6|pages=595–599|location=London; New York|publisher=Routledge|year=1998|isbn=978-0415073103|via=Islamic Philosophy Online|url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H027.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various Islamic commentaries describe hikmah as "to know the best of things by way of the best of sciences ...",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ibn Mandhur|title=Lisan al-'Arab|pages=15/30}}&lt;/ref&gt; having experience,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al-Asma'i|title=as-Sihah|pages=5/1901}}&lt;/ref&gt; using "justice in judging", "knowledge of the reality of things",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Taj al-'Arus'|pages=8/353}}&lt;/ref&gt; "that which prevents ignorance,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ibn Faris's|title=Mu'jam Maqayis al-Lughah|pages=2/91}}&lt;/ref&gt; putting "things in their proper places, assigning them to their proper status", etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Taysir al-Karim ar-Rahman|pages=1/233}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ibn al-Qayyim]], the highest and most exclusive of the three levels of hikmah are "reserved for the [[Sahabah|Companions]] over the rest of the [[Ummah]], and it is the highest level that the [Islamic] scholars can reach."{{cn|date=November 2016}}

As a term of ''[[fiqh]]'' (Islamic jurisprudence), [[Taqi Usmani]] describes it as meaning "the wisdom and the philosophy taken into account by the legislator while framing the [Islamic] law or the benefit intended to be drawn by [the law's] enforcement". One Dr Dipertua calls it "the objectives and wisdom" as "prescribed by Shariah".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Asyraf Wajdi Bin Dato’ Hj. Dusuki Yang Dipertua|title=The Challenge of Realizing Maqasid Shariah in Islamic Finance|url=http://www.iais.org.my/e/attach/2015/maqasid2015/pdf/keynote3_ppt.pdf|website=iais.org.my|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usmani gives as an example the secular law for traffic lights, where ''illat'' (another term of ''fiqh'' meaning "the basic feature of a transaction that causes relevant law to be applied") is obedience to stopping at red lights, and ''hikmah'' is traffic safety -- avoiding vehicle and pedestrian collisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Usmani |first1=Muhammad Taqi |title=The Historic Judgment on Interest Delivered in the Supreme Court of Pakistan |publisher=albalagh.net |location=Karachi, Pakistan|url=http://www.albalagh.net/Islamic_economics/riba_judgement.pdf |date=December 1999 |ref=MTUHJI1999 |}}, paras 119-120&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14603">'''Instrumental convergence''' is the hypothetical tendency for most sufficiently [[intelligent agent]]s to pursue certain instrumental goals such as [[self-preservation]] and [[resource]] acquisition.

Instrumental convergence suggests that an intelligent agent with apparently harmless goals can act in surprisingly harmful ways. For example, a computer with the sole goal of solving the [[Riemann hypothesis]] could attempt to turn the entire Earth into [[computronium]] in an effort to increase its computing power so that it can succeed in its calculations.&lt;ref name=aama/&gt;

Proposed '''basic AI drives''' include utility function or goal-content integrity, self-protection, freedom from interference, [[self-improvement]], and non-satiable acquisition of additional resources.

==Instrumental and final goals==

{{See also|Instrumental value}}

Final goals, or final values, are intrinsically valuable to an intelligent agent, whether an [[artificial intelligence]] or a human being, as an [[ends-in-themselves|end in itself]]. In contrast, instrumental goals, or instrumental values, are only valuable to an agent as a means toward accomplishing its final goals. The contents and tradeoffs of a completely rational agent's "final goal" system can be formalized into a [[utility function]].

==Hypothetical examples of convergence==

One hypothetical example of instrumental convergence is provided by the [[Riemann Hypothesis]] catastrophe. [[Marvin Minsky]], the co-founder of [[MIT]]'s AI laboratory, has suggested that an artificial intelligence designed to solve the Riemann hypothesis might decide to take over all of Earth's resources to build supercomputers to help achieve its goal.&lt;ref name=aama&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Stuart J.|last2=Norvig|first2=Peter|title=[[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]]|date=2003|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=0137903952|chapter=Section 26.3: The Ethics and Risks of Developing Artificial Intelligence|quote="Similarly, Marvin Minsky once suggested that an AI program designed to solve the Riemann Hypothesis might end up taking over all the resources of Earth to build more powerful supercomputers to help achieve its goal."}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the computer had instead been programmed to produce as many paper clips as possible, it would still decide to take all of Earth's resources to meet its final goal.&lt;ref&gt;Bostrom 2014, Chapter 8, p. 123. "An AI, designed to manage production in a factory, is given the final goal of maximizing the manufacturing of paperclips, and proceeds by converting first the Earth and then increasingly large chunks of the observable universe into paperclips."&lt;/ref&gt; Even though these two final goals are different, both of them produce a ''convergent'' instrumental goal of taking over Earth's resources.&lt;ref name="bostrom chapter 7" /&gt;

===Paperclip maximizer===
The paperclip maximizer is a [[thought experiment]] described by Swedish philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] in 2003. It illustrates the [[existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence|existential risk]] that an [[artificial general intelligence]] may pose to human beings when programmed to pursue even seemingly-harmless goals, and the necessity of incorporating [[machine ethics]] into [[artificial intelligence]] design. The scenario describes an advanced artificial intelligence tasked with manufacturing paperclips. If such a machine were not programmed to value human life, then given enough power its optimized goal would be to turn all matter in the universe, including human beings, into either paperclips or machines which manufacture paperclips.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/ai.html|title = Ethical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence|date = 2003|access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = Bostrom|first = Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text = Suppose we have an AI whose only goal is to make as many paper clips as possible. The AI will realize quickly that it would be much better if there were no humans because humans might decide to switch it off. Because if humans do so, there would be fewer paper clips. Also, human bodies contain a lot of atoms that could be made into paper clips. The future that the AI would be trying to gear towards would be one in which there were a lot of paper clips but no humans.|sign = |source = [[Nick Bostrom]], as quoted in {{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/22/artificial-intelligence-oxford_n_5689858.html|title=Artificial Intelligence May Doom The Human Race Within A Century, Oxford Professor Says}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/22/artificial-intelligence-oxford_n_5689858.html|title=Artificial Intelligence May Doom The Human Race Within A Century, Oxford Professor Says}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}Bostrom has emphasised that he does not believe the paperclip maximiser scenario ''per se'' will actually occur; rather, his intention is to illustrate the dangers of creating [[Superintelligence|superintelligent]] machines without knowing how to safely program them to eliminate existential risk to human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Are We Smart Enough to Control Artificial Intelligence?|url = http://www.technologyreview.com/review/534871/our-fear-of-artificial-intelligence/|website = MIT Technology Review|access-date = 25 January 2016|date = 11 February 2015|last = Ford|first = Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paperclip maximizer example illustrates the broad problem of managing powerful systems that lack human values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Friend|first1=Tad|title=Sam Altman’s Manifest Destiny|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/sam-altmans-manifest-destiny|accessdate=25 November 2017|work=The New Yorker|date=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic AI drives==

[[Steve Omohundro]] has itemized several convergent instrumental goals, including [[self-preservation]] or self-protection, utility function or goal-content integrity, self-improvement, and resource acquisition. He refers to these as the "basic AI drives". A "drive" here denotes a "tendency which will be present unless specifically counteracted";&lt;ref&gt;Omohundro, S. M. (2008, February). The basic AI drives. In AGI (Vol. 171, pp. 483-492).&lt;/ref&gt; this is different from the psychological term "[[drive theory|drive]]", denoting an excitatory state produced by a homeostatic disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;Seward, J. (1956). Drive, incentive, and reinforcement. Psychological Review, 63, 19-203.&lt;/ref&gt; A tendency for a person to fill out income tax forms every year is a "drive" in Omohundro's sense, but not in the psychological sense.&lt;ref&gt;Bostrom 2014, footnote 8 to chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Dewey of the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]] argues that even an initially introverted self-rewarding AGI may continue to acquire free energy, space, time, and freedom from interference to ensure that it will not be stopped from self-rewarding.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, Daniel. "Learning what to value." Artificial General Intelligence (2011): 309-314.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goal-content integrity===

In humans, maintenance of final goals can be explained with a thought experiment. Suppose a man named "Gandhi" has a pill that, if he took it, would cause him to want to kill people. This Gandhi is currently a pacifist: one of his explicit final goals is to never kill anyone. Gandhi is likely to refuse to take the pill, because Gandhi knows that if in the future he wants to kill people, he is likely to actually kill people, and thus the goal of "not killing people" would not be satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;Yudkowsky, Eliezer. "Complex value systems in friendly AI." In Artificial general intelligence, pp. 388-393. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in other cases, people seem happy to let their final values drift. Humans are complicated, and their goals can be inconsistent or unknown, even to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Bostrom 2014, chapter 7, p. 110. "We humans often seem happy to let our final values drift... For example, somebody deciding to have a child might predict that they will come to value the child for its own sake, even though at the time of the decision they may not particularly value their future child... Humans are complicated, and many factors might be in play in a situation like this... one might have a final value that involves having certain experiences and occupying a certain social role; and become a parent&amp;mdash; and undergoing the attendant goal shift&amp;mdash; might be a necessary aspect of that..."&lt;/ref&gt;

====In artificial intelligence====

In 2009, [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] concluded, in a setting where agents search for proofs about possible self-modifications, "that any rewrites of the utility function can happen only if the Gödel machine first can prove that the rewrite is useful according to the present utility function."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s12559-009-9014-y| title = Ultimate Cognition à la Gödel| journal = Cognitive Computation| volume = 1| issue = 2| pages = 177| year = 2009| last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = J. R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hibbard&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2478/v10229-011-0013-5| title = Model-based Utility Functions| journal = Journal of Artificial General Intelligence| volume = 3| pages = 1| year = 2012| last1 = Hibbard | first1 = B. }}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis by [[Bill Hibbard]] of a different scenario is similarly consistent with maintenance of goal content integrity.&lt;ref name=hibbard /&gt; Hibbard also argues that in a utility maximizing framework the only goal is maximizing expected utility, so that instrumental goals should be called unintended instrumental actions.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbard, Bill (2014): Ethical Artificial Intelligence. https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1373&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resource acquisition===

Many instrumental goals, such as [...] resource acquisition, are valuable to an agent because they increase its ''freedom of action''.&lt;ref name=formalizing&gt;Benson-Tilsen, T., &amp; Soares, N. (2016, March). Formalizing Convergent Instrumental Goals. In AAAI Workshop: AI, Ethics, and Society.&lt;/ref&gt;{{fcn|date=September 2018}}

For almost any open-ended, non-trivial reward function (or set of goals), possessing more resources (such as equipment, raw materials, or energy) can enable the AI to find a more "optimal" solution. Resources can benefit some AIs directly, through being able to create more of whatever stuff its reward function values: "The AI neither hates you, nor loves you, but you are made out of atoms that it can use for something else."&lt;ref&gt;Yudkowsky, Eliezer. "Artificial intelligence as a positive and negative factor in global risk." Global catastrophic risks (2008): 303. p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shanahan 7.5"&gt;[[Murray Shanahan]]. ''The Technological Singularity''. MIT Press, 2015. Chapter 7, Section 5: "Safe Superintelligence".&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, almost all AIs can benefit from having more resources to spend on other instrumental goals, such as self-preservation.&lt;ref name="shanahan 7.5" /&gt;

===Cognitive enhancement===

"If the agent's final goals are fairly unbounded and the agent is in a position to become the first superintelligence and thereby obtain a decisive strategic advantage, [...] according to its preferences. At least in this special case, a rational intelligent agent would place a very *high instrumental value on cognitive enhancement*" &lt;ref name=super&gt;Bostrom, N. (2016). Superintelligence, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=September 2018}}

===Technological perfection===

Many instrumental goals, such as [...] technological advancement, are valuable to an agent because they increase its ''freedom of action''.&lt;ref name=formalizing/&gt;{{fcn|date=September 2018}}

===Self-preservation===

Many instrumental goals, such as [...] self-preservation, are valuable to an agent because they increase its ''freedom of action''.&lt;ref name=formalizing/&gt;{{fcn|date=September 2018}}

==Instrumental convergence thesis==

The instrumental convergence thesis, as outlined by philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]], states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Several instrumental values can be identified which are convergent in the sense that their attainment would increase the chances of the agent's goal being realized for a wide range of final goals and a wide range of situations, implying that these instrumental values are likely to be pursued by a broad spectrum of situated intelligent agents.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The instrumental convergence thesis applies only to instrumental goals; intelligent agents may have a wide variety of possible final goals.&lt;ref name="bostrom chapter 7"&gt;Bostrom 2014, chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

Agents can acquire resources by trade or by conquest. A rational agent will, by definition, choose whatever option will maximize its implicit utility function; therefore a rational agent will trade for a subset of another agent's resources only if outright seizing the resources is too risky or costly (compared with the gains from taking all the resources), or if some other element in its utility function bars it from the seizure. In the case of a powerful, self-interested, rational superintelligence interacting with a lesser intelligence, peaceful trade (rather than unilateral seizure) seems unnecessary and suboptimal, and therefore unlikely.&lt;ref name=formalizing/&gt;{{fcn|date=September 2018}}

Some observers, such as Skype's [[Jaan Tallinn]] and physicist [[Max Tegmark]], believe that "basic AI drives", and other [[unintended consequences]] of superintelligent AI programmed by well-meaning programmers, could pose a significant threat to [[human survival]], especially if an "intelligence explosion" abruptly occurs due to [[recursive]] self-improvement. Since nobody knows how to predict beforehand when [[superintelligence]] will arrive, such observers call for research into [[friendly artificial intelligence]] as a possible way to mitigate [[existential risk from artificial general intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Is Artificial Intelligence a Threat?|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Is-Artificial-Intelligence-a/148763|accessdate=25 November 2017|work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|date=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19489">[[File:Panthera leo &amp; Crocuta crocuta.jpg|thumb|Subadult male [[lion]] and [[spotted hyena]] in the [[Masai Mara]]. The two species share the same ecological niche, and are thus in competition with each other.]]
'''Interspecific competition''', in [[ecology]], is a form of [[Competition (biology)|competition]] in which individuals of ''different'' [[species]] compete for the same resources in an ecosystem (e.g. food or living space). This can be contrasted with [[interspecific cooperation]], a type of [[symbiosis]]. Competition between members of the same species is called [[intraspecific competition]].

If a tree species in a dense [[forest]] grows taller than surrounding tree species, it is able to absorb more of the incoming sunlight. However, less sunlight is then available for the trees that are shaded by the taller tree, thus interspecific competition. [[Leopard]]s and [[lion]]s can also be in interspecific competition, since both species feed on the same [[prey]], and can be negatively impacted by the presence of the other because they will have less food.

Competition is only one of many interacting [[Biotic component|biotic]] and [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] factors that affect community structure. Moreover, competition is not always a straightforward, direct, interaction. Interspecific competition may occur when individuals of two separate species share a [[limiting resource]] in the same area. If the resource cannot support both populations, then lowered [[fecundity]], growth, or survival may result in at least one species. Interspecific competition has the potential to alter [[population]]s, [[Community|communities]] and the [[evolution]] of interacting species. On an individual organism level, competition can occur as interference or exploitative competition.

Direct competition has been observed between individuals, populations and species, but there is little evidence that competition has been the driving force in the evolution of large groups. For example, between amphibians, reptiles and mammals.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html | author=Sahney, S.; Benton, M.J.; Ferry, P.A. | year=2010 | title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land | journal=Biology Letters | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024 | volume = 6 | pages = 544–547 |format=PDF | issue=4 | pmid=20106856 | pmc=2936204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
All of the types described here can also apply to [[intraspecific competition]], that is, competition among individuals within a species. Also, any specific example of interspecific competition can be described in terms of both a mechanism (e.g., resource or interference) and an outcome (symmetric or asymmetric).

=== Based on mechanism ===

Exploitative competition, also referred to as resource competition, is a form of competition in which one species consumes and either reduces or more efficiently uses a shared limiting resource and therefore depletes the availability of the resource for the other species.&lt;ref&gt;Tilman, D. (1982). Resource Competition and Community Structure. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is an indirect interaction because the competing species interact via a shared resource.

Interference competition is a form of competition in which individuals of one species interacts directly with individuals of another species via antagonistic displays or more aggressive behavior.

In a review and synthesis of experimental evidence regarding interspecific competition, Schoener&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schoener T. W. | year = 1983 | title = Field experiments on interspecific competition | url = | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 122 | issue = 2| pages = 240–285 | doi=10.1086/284133}}&lt;/ref&gt; described six specific types of mechanisms by which competition occurs, including consumptive, preemptive, overgrowth, chemical, territorial, and encounter. Consumption competition is always resource competition, but the others are cannot always be regarded as exclusively exploitative or interference.

Separating the effect of resource use from that of interference is not easy. A good example of exploitative competition is found in [[aphid]] species competing over the sap in plant [[phloem]]. Each aphid species that feeds on host plant sap uses some of the resource, leaving less for competing species. In one study, ''[[Fordinae geoica]]'' was observed to out-compete ''[[Fordinae formicaria|F. formicaria]]'' to the extent that the latter species exhibited a reduction in survival by 84%. Another example is the one of competition for calling space in amphibians, where the calling activity of a species prevents the other one from calling in an area as wide as it would in allopatry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borzée|first1=Amaël|last2=Kim|first2=Jun Young|last3=Jang|first3=Yikweon|title=Asymmetric competition over calling sites in two closely related treefrog species|journal=Scientific Reports|date=7 Sep 2016|volume=6|page=32569|doi=10.1038/srep32569|pmc=5013533|pmid=27599461}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A last example is driving of bisexual rock lizards of genus ''[[Darevskia]]'' from their natural habitats by a daughter unisexual form;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.2010.01498.x | volume=101 | title=Unisexual rock lizard might be outcompeting its bisexual progenitors in the Caucasus | year=2010 | journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society | pages=447–460 | author=Tarkhnishvili David}}&lt;/ref&gt; interference competition can be ruled out in this case, because [[parthenogenetic]] forms of the [[lizards]] never demonstrate aggressive behavior.

This type of competition can also be observed in forests where large trees dominate the [[Canopy (forest)|canopy]] and thus allow little light to reach smaller competitors living below. These interactions have important implications for the [[population dynamics]] and distribution of both species.

=== Based on outcome ===
{{main|Scramble competition|Contest competition}}

Scramble and contest competition refer to the relative success of competitors. Scramble competition is said to occur when each competitor is equal suppressed, either through reduction in survival or birth rates. Contest competition is said to occur when one or a few competitors are unaffected by competition, but all others suffer greatly, either through reduction in survival or birth rates. Sometimes these types of competition are referred to as symmetric (scramble) vs. asymmetric (contest) competition. Scramble and contest competition are two ends of a spectrum, of completely equal or completely unequal effects.

==Apparent competition==

Apparent competition is actually an example of predation that alters the relative abundances of prey on the same [[trophic level]]. It occurs when two or more species in a [[habitat]] affect shared natural enemies in a higher [[trophic level]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Holt R. D., Lawton J. H. | year = 1994 | title = The ecological consequences of shared natural enemies | url = | journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 495–520 | doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.25.1.495}}&lt;/ref&gt; If two species share a common [[predator]], for example, apparent competition can exist between the two prey items in which the presence of each prey species increases the abundance of the shared enemy, and thereby suppresses one or both prey species.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, R. D. (1977.) Predation, apparent competition, and the structure of prey communities. ''Theoretical Population Biology'' 12: 197-229.&lt;/ref&gt; This mechanism gets its name from experiments in which one prey species is removed and the second prey species increases in abundance. Investigators sometimes mistakenly attribute the increase in abundance in the second species as evidence for resource competition between prey species. It is "apparently" competition, but is in fact due to a shared predator, parasitoid, parasite, or pathogen.

== Consequences ==

Many studies, including those cited previously, have shown major impacts on both individuals and populations from interspecific competition. Documentation of these impacts has been found in species from every major branch of organism. The effects of interspecific competition can also reach communities and can even influence the evolution of species as they adapt to avoid competition. This evolution may result in the [[Competitive exclusion principle|exclusion]] of a species in the habitat, [[niche separation]], and [[local extinction]]. The changes of these species over time can also change communities as other species must adapt.

=== Competitive exclusion ===
{{main|Gause's law}}

The competitive exclusion principle, also called "[[Gause's law]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Competition among species|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-03026-5_7|publisher = Springer International Publishing|date = 2014-01-01|isbn = 978-3-319-03025-8|pages = 175–208|series = UNITEXT|doi = 10.1007/978-3-319-03026-5_7|language = en|first = Mimmo|last = Iannelli|first2 = Andrea|last2 = Pugliese}}&lt;/ref&gt; which arose from mathematical analysis and simple competition models states that two species that use the same limiting resource in the same way in the same space and time cannot coexist and must diverge from each other over time in order for the two species to coexist. One species will often exhibit an advantage in resource use. This superior competitor will out-compete the other with more efficient use of the limiting resource. As a result, the inferior competitor will suffer a decline in population over time. It will be excluded from the area and replaced by the superior competitor.

A well-documented example of competitive exclusion was observed to occur between Dolly Varden charr (Trout)(''[[Salvelinus malma]]'') and white spotted char (Trout)(''[[Salvelinus leucomaenis|S. leucomaenis]]'') in Japan. Both of these species were morphologically similar but the former species was found primarily at higher elevations than the latter. Although there was a zone of overlap, each species excluded the other from its dominant region by becoming better adapted to its habitat over time. In some such cases, each species gets displaced into an exclusive segment of the original habitat. Because each species suffers from competition, natural selection favors the avoidance of competition in such a way.

=== Niche differentiation ===
{{Main|Niche differentiation}}

Niche differentiation is a process by which competitive exclusion leads to differences in resource use. In the previous example, niche differentiation resulted in spatial displacement. In other cases it may result in other changes that also avoid competition. If competition avoidance is achievable, each species will occupy an edge of the niche and will become more specialized to that area thus minimizing competition. This phenomenon often results in the separation of species over time as they become more specialized to their edge of the niche, called niche differentiation. The species do not have to be in separate habitats however to avoid niche overlap. Some species adapt regionally to utilizing different resources than they ordinarily would in order to avoid competition.

There have been several well-documented cases in birds where species that are very similar change their habitat use where they overlap. For example, they may consume different food resources or use different nesting habitat or materials. On the [[Galapagos Islands]], [[finch]] species have been observed to change dietary specializations in just a few generations in order to utilize limited resources and minimize competition.

In some cases, third party species interfere to the detriment or benefit of the competing species. In a laboratory study, coexistence between two competing bacterial species was mediated by [[phage]] parasites.&lt;ref&gt;Brockhurst, M.A., A. Fenton, B. Roulston and P.B. Rainey. 2006. The impact of phages on interspecific competition in experimental populations of bacteria. BMC Ecology6:19.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of interaction actually helped to maintain diversity in bacterial communities and has far reaching implications in medical research as well as ecology. Similar effects have been documented for many communities as a result of the action of a keystone predator that preys on a competitively superior species.

=== Local extinction ===

{{main|Local extinction}}
Although local extinction of one or more competitors has been less documented than niche separation or competitive exclusion, it does occur. In an experiment involving [[zooplankton]] in artificial rock pools, local extinction rates were significantly higher in areas of interspecific competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bengtsson J | year = 1989 | title = Interspecific competition increases local extinction rate in a metapopulation system | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 340 | issue = | pages = 713–715 | doi=10.1038/340713a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, therefore, the negative effects are not only at the population level but also species richness of communities.

=== Impacts on communities ===
[[File:Cooper Marsh - Purple-loosestrife.jpg|thumb|upright|Naturalised [[purple-loosestrife]] plants growing in the Cooper Marsh Conservation Area, near Cornwall Ontario.]]

As mentioned previously, interspecific competition has great impact on community composition and structure. Niche separation of species, local extinction and competitive exclusion are only some of the possible effects. In addition to these, interspecific competition can be the source of a cascade of effects that build on each other. An example of such an effect is the introduction of an [[invasive species]] to the United States, [[purple-loosestrife]]. This plant when introduced to wetland communities often outcompetes much of the native flora and decreases species richness, food and shelter to many other species at higher trophic levels. In this way, one species can influence the populations of many other species as well as through a myriad of other interactions. Because of the complicated web of interactions that make up every ecosystem and habitat, the results of interspecific competition are complex and site-specific.

== Competitive Lotka-Volterra model ==
{{main|Competitive Lotka–Volterra equations}}

The impacts of interspecific competition on populations have been formalized in a mathematical model called the [[Competitive Lotka–Volterra equations]], which creates a theoretical prediction of interactions. It combines the effects of each species on the other. These effects are calculated separately for the first and second population respectively:

:&lt;math&gt;{dN_1\over dt}=r_1 N_1 {K_1-N_1-\alpha N_2\over K_1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{dN_2\over dt}=r_2 N_2 {K_2-N_2-\beta N_1\over K_2}&lt;/math&gt;

In these formulae, '''N''' is the population size, '''t''' is time, '''K''' is the carrying capacity, '''r''' is the intrinsic rate of increase and '''α''' and '''β''' are the relative competition coefficients.&lt;ref&gt;Gotelli, N.J. 2008. A Primer of Ecology, 4th ed. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; The results show the effect that the other species has on the species being calculated. The results can be graphed to show a trend and possible prediction for the future of the species. One problem with this model is that certain assumptions must be made for the calculation to work. These include the lack of [[wikt:migration|migration]] and constancy of the carrying capacities and competition coefficients of both species. The complex nature of ecology determines that these assumptions are rarely true in the field but the model provides a basis for improved understanding of these important concepts.

An equivalent formulation of these models&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, M. H. H. (2009). A Primer of Ecology with R. (R. Gentleman, Hornik K., &amp; G. Parmigiani, Eds.). Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;{dN_1\over dt}=r_1 N_1 \left(1-\alpha_{11}N_1-\alpha_{12} N_2\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{dN_2\over dt}=r_2 N_2 \left(1-\alpha_{21}N_1-\alpha_{22} N_2\right)&lt;/math&gt;

In these formulae, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{11}&lt;/math&gt; is the effect that an individual of species 1 has on its own population growth rate. Similarly, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{12}&lt;/math&gt; is the effect that an individual of species 2 has on the population growth rate of species 1. One can also read this as the effect on species 1 of species 2. In comparing this formulation to the one above, we note that &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{11} = 1/K_1,~ \alpha_{22}=1/K_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{12}=\alpha/K_1&lt;/math&gt;.

Coexistence between competitors occurs when &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{11} &gt; \alpha_{12}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{22} &gt; \alpha_{21}&lt;/math&gt;. We can translate this as coexistence occurs when the effect of each species on itself is greater the effect of the competitor.

There are other mathematical representations that model species competition, such as using non-polynomial functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rabajante JF, Talaue CO |title=Equilibrium switching and mathematical properties of nonlinear interaction networks with concurrent antagonism and self-stimulation|journal=Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals|date=April 2015|volume=73|pages=166–182|doi=10.1016/j.chaos.2015.01.018|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077915000259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6439">The '''inventor's paradox''' is a phenomenon that occurs in seeking a solution to a given problem. Instead of solving a specific type of problem, which would seem intuitively easier, it can be easier to solve a more general problem, which covers the specifics of the sought-after solution. The ''inventor's paradox''  has been used to describe phenomena in mathematics, programming, and logic, as well as other areas that involve critical thinking.

==History==
In the book ''[[How to Solve It]]'', [[George Pólya]] introduces what he defines as the inventor's paradox:
{{Quote|The more ambitious plan may have more chances of success […] provided it is not based on a mere pretension but on some vision of the things beyond those immediately present.|[[George Pólya]]|[[How to Solve It]].&lt;ref&gt;Pólya, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Or, in other words, to solve what one desires to solve, one may have to solve more than that in order to get a properly working flow of information.&lt;ref name=Barwise41/&gt;

When solving a problem, the natural inclination typically is to remove as much excessive variability and produce limitations on the subject at hand as possible. Doing this can create unforeseen and intrinsically awkward parameters.&lt;ref name=tate110&gt;Tate, et al., p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to find elegant and relatively simple solutions to broader problems, allowing for the ability to focus on the specific portion that was originally of concern.&lt;ref name=tate111&gt;Tate, et al., p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

There lies the ''inventor's paradox'', that it is often significantly easier to find a general solution than a more specific one, since the general solution may naturally have a simpler algorithm and cleaner design, and typically can take less time to solve in comparison with a particular problem.&lt;ref name=tate110/&gt;

==Examples==
===Mathematics===
The sum of numbers sequentially from 1-99:
:&lt;math&gt;1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 97 + 98 + 99\, &lt;/math&gt;
This process, although not impossible to do in one's head, can prove to be difficult for most. However, the ability to generalize the problem exists, in this case by reordering the sequence to:
:&lt;math&gt;(1 + 99) + (2 + 98) + (3 + 97) + ... + (48 + 52) + (49 + 51) + (50) \,&lt;/math&gt;
In this form, the example can be solved by most without the use of a calculator.&lt;ref name=tate110/&gt;  If one notices the problem's lowest and highest numbers (1 + 99) sum to 100, and that the next pair of lowest and highest numbers (2 + 98) also sum to 100, they'll also realize that all 49 numbers are matching pairs that each sum to 100, except for the single number in the middle, 50.  The inventive mathematician will reformulate the problem in their mind as (49 * 100) + 50.  Since 49 * 100 is easy to calculate by adding 2 zeros to the digit places of 49, they think: 4900 + 50.  This is easy to add, because 50's maximum ordinal placement of the most significant digit (number 5 in the 2nd position "10s" place) is less than the minimum ordinal position of 4900's smallest significant digit (number 9 in the 3rd position "100s" place).  So the solver simply replaces the last two 0s in 4900 with 50 to add them together, yielding the answer 4950.  While the text description of this process seems complicated, each of the steps performed in the mind is simple and fast.

Although appearing in several applications, it can be easiest to explain through inspection of a relatively simple mathematical sequence.&lt;ref name=Barwise40&gt;Barwise p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;1 + 3 = 4\, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;1 + 3 + 5 = 9\, &lt;/math&gt;

and further along in the sequence:

:&lt;math&gt;1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25\, &lt;/math&gt;

In allowing the sequence to expand to a point where the sum cannot be found quickly, we can simplify by finding that the sum of consecutive odd numbers follows:&lt;ref name=Barwise41&gt;Barwise p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{n}\mathbf(2k-1) = n^2.&lt;/math&gt;

===Programming===
As an example in applying the same logic, it may be harder to solve a 25-case problem than it would be to solve an n-case problem, and then apply it to the case where n=25.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley (2000), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
This paradox has applications in writing efficient programs. It is intuitive to write programs that are specialized, but in practice it can become easier to develop more generalized procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley (1982), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Bruce Tate]], some of the most successful frameworks are simple generalizations of complex problems, and he says that [[Visual Basic]], the Internet, and [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache web servers]] plug-ins are primary examples of such practice.&lt;ref name=tate111/&gt; In the investigation of the semantics of language, many logicians find themselves facing this paradox. An example of application can be seen in the inherent concern of logicians with the conditions of truth within a sentence, and not, in fact, with the conditions under which a sentence can be truly asserted.&lt;ref name=Barwise41/&gt;
Additionally, the paradox has been shown to have applications in industry.&lt;ref name=tate110/&gt;

==Early life, family and education==
Rapping grew up in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. At a young age, Rapping went to demonstrations and protests with his mother, [[Elayne Rapping]], a community organizer, activist and professor in Pittsburgh. Rapping's mother was particularly involved in the anti-war and women's movements.&lt;ref name=Trend&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosen|first1=Karen|title=Transforming Public Defense|url=http://atlantatrend.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=870&amp;catid=40|publisher=Atlanta Trend|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of working with his activist mother taught Rapping about [[social justice]], and trying to change things in the world that aren't fair or right.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt; Friends of Rapping's family were even arrested and he admired the lawyers who worked to keep them out of jail.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt; After witnessing social justice activism as a young person, Rapping aspired to be a criminal defense attorney at a young age.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt;

Rapping attended [[Allderdice High School]] in [[Squirrel Hill (Pittsburgh)|Squirrel Hill]], and graduated in 1984.&lt;ref name=trib&gt;{{cite web|last1=Branddolph|first1=Adam|title=Professor, lawyer with Pittsburgh ties earn MacArthur 'genius grants' |url=http://triblive.com/news/allegheny/6811526-74/foundation-hayes-macarthur#axzz3bVIhvdvN|website=triblive.com|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After high school, Rapping attended the [[University of Chicago]] where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in [[economics]] ''[[cum laude]]''.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt; People close to Rapping convinced him that he would incur tremendous debt if he went to law school, so he worked as a research assistant with the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C. for two years,&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt; following in the footsteps of his father, [[Leonard Rapping]], a well-known economist.  Rapping earned a scholarship to attend the [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]] at [[Princeton University]] where he earned a [[Master of Public Administration]] in 1992.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt;  Rapping's sister, Alison Rapping has spent her career in the non-profit sector, and is widely considered a leader in that realm.  Both siblings attribute their commitment to social justice to the influence of their parents.

Right after graduating from Princeton and still unfulfilled, Rapping decided to attend [[George Washington University School of Law]] in Washington, D.C. After his first year of law school at GWU, Rapping interned with the [[Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia]], where he found his calling.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt; He worked at PDS throughout law school.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt;

While living in Washington, Rapping met and married his wife, Ilham Askia, who was teaching at an elementary school and then spent two years at a charter high school for court involved children.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt; Askia was born in [[Buffalo, New York]] and every man in her family has been a victim of the criminal justice system.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt; Askia's father went to [[Attica Correctional Facility]] when she was five years old.  She helped raise her younger brother who ended up in prison.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt; Askia became a teacher to break the [[school-to-prison pipeline]], but soon questioned how much of a difference she could make on the front end.&lt;ref name=Trend/&gt;  This led to her joining Rapping to start Gideon's Promise and, ultimately, to become the organization's Executive Director, where she advocates for attacking the pipeline on the back end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0IGzOEHuaQ|title=Gideon's Promise receives 2015 MLK, Jr. Community Service Award|date=29 January 2015|work=YouTube|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal career==

===Public defender===
After law school, Rapping worked as a staff attorney for The [[Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia]] (1995–2004), where he served his final three years as training director.&lt;ref name=Mac&gt;{{cite web|title=MacArthur Fellows / Meet the Class of 2014|url=http://www.macfound.org/fellows/925/|website=macfound.org|publisher=MacArthur Foundation|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2004-2006, Rapping was the training director for the Georgia Public Defender Standards Council.&lt;ref name=Mac/&gt;

From 2006-2007, he served as training chief for the New Orleans Office of the Public Defender.&lt;ref name=Mac/&gt; In recognition of his work in New Orleans to rebuild the public defender system post-[[Hurricane Katrina]], he was a co-recipient of the Lincoln Leadership Award, given by Kentucky's Department of Public Advocacy to honor leadership in national efforts to improve indigent defense.

===Gideon's Promise===
In 2007, Rapping created the Southern Public Defender Training Center, subsequently renamed [[Gideon's Promise]], along with his wife, Ilham Askia. Named after the landmark 1963 Supreme Court case Gideon v. Wainwright, Gideon's Promise teaches public defenders to work more effectively within the judicial system by providing coaching, training, and professional development as well as a supportive network of peers and mentors from around the country. Rapping received a grant to help start the center from [[George Soros]]' [[Open Society Foundations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Over $1 Million Awarded to Visionary Leaders in Criminal Justice|url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/press-releases/over-1-million-awarded-visionary-leaders-criminal-justice|publisher=Open Society Foundations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its founding, the organization has grown from a single training program for sixteen attorneys in two offices in Georgia and Louisiana, to a multi-tiered enterprise with over 300 participants in more than 35 offices across 15 mostly Southern states. An initial three-year "Core" program for new public defenders has since expanded into a comprehensive model that includes programs for graduates of the initial Core program as they continue their development, public defender leaders, trainers and supervisors, and law students. Further, the organization is unique in that it intervenes at the trial stage, rather than after conviction, where challenges to criminal injustice often take place.&lt;ref name=Mac/&gt;

In 2013, HBO Films produced a documentary called [[Gideon's Army]], based in part on the Gideon's Promise program and highlighting participants in the program.

Gideon's Promise has won numerous awards including [[Emory University]]'s 2014 Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Service Award,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.emory.edu/stories/2015/01/er_king_week_events/campus.html|title=Emory honors MLK legacy with service, awards, special events|work=emory.edu|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Southern Center for Human Rights]]' 2013 Gideon's Promise Award,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.schr.org/action/resources/schr_to_honor_justice_harold_clarke_with_lifetime_achievement_award|title=SCHR to Honor Justice Harold Clarke with Lifetime Achievement Award|work=schr.org|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Association of Sentencing Advocates and Mitigation Specialists 2013 Sentencing Project Award, and the American College of Trail Lawyers' 2011 Emil Gumpert Award.

In 2014, Rapping became the Director of Strategic Planning and Organizational Development for the [[Maryland Office of the Public Defender]]. In 2014, Rapping earned a [[MacArthur Foundation]] "Genius Fellow."&lt;ref name=ATL&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Michelle|title=Atlanta lawyer Jonathan Rapping wins MacArthur 'genius grant'|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/news/breaking-news/atlanta-lawyer-jonathan-rapping-wins-macarthur-gen/nhN5M/|website=ajc.com|publisher=AJC|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law professor===
Since 2007, Rapping has also been an associate professor at Atlanta's John Marshall Law School.&lt;ref name=Mac/&gt; In 2015 he was promoted to full Professor.  Rapping is also a visiting associate professor of law at Harvard Law School.&lt;ref name=harvard&gt;{{cite web|title=Harvard Bio for Rapping|url=http://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/11243/Rapping|website=harvard.edu|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Rapping was selected as one of Harvard Law School's Wasserstein Public Interest Fellows in recognition of his contribution to the public interest legal arena.&lt;ref name=harvard/&gt; In 2013, Rapping was the Public Interest Scholar in Residence at Touro Law School.&lt;ref name=touro&gt;{{cite web|last1=Touro Law Center|title=Distinguished Public Interest Lawyer in Residence Program|url=http://law.touro.edu/AboutTouroLaw/?pageid=379#.VBoXOvldV8E|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings &amp; views==
Rapping has been a leading voice in discussing how culture shapes our [[criminal justice system]].  He has written and talked extensively about the culture of criminal justice, has theorized how criminal justice reform can be accomplished through cultural transformation, and through his work with Gideon's Promise, has applied his ideas to build a movement of public defenders to drive criminal justice reform.  He is a thought leader in articulating the critical role public defenders must play in any comprehensive criminal justice reform strategy.  His work in this area earned him a 2014 MacArthur "Genius" grant.

Rapping first applied organizational culture theory to indigent defense reform in his 2007 article, Directing the Winds of Change.&lt;ref name=winds/&gt; In 2009, he laid out a vision for how to put this theory to practice in describing the work of the Southern Public Defender Training Center (the precursor to Gideon's Promise) in You Can't Build on Shaky Ground.&lt;ref name=shaky/&gt;  He made the case that supporting public defenders in their quest to drive cultural transformation should be a priority of the [[United States federal government]] in National Crisis, National Neglect.&lt;ref name=crisis/&gt;  And in 2012—applying his work to prosecutors in Who's Guarding the Henhouse—he examined how prosecutors too have been shaped by the existing criminal justice culture and, as a result, help perpetuate injustice.&lt;ref name=henhouse/&gt;

Believing that well-intentioned professionals are shaped by a criminal justice system that has become unmoored from is foundational values, Rapping's vision involves supporting defenders as they struggle to resist the pressure to adapt to the status quo.  This vision is best articulated in his article "Redefining Success as a Public Defender"&lt;ref name=redefine/&gt; and in a speech he delivered at Touro Law School.&lt;ref name=Tourotalk&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IgR_jBnt_E|title=Jonathan Rapping - Touro Law - 2013 Public Interest Lawyer in Residence - Public Speech|date=16 October 2013|work=YouTube|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has examined how the American story of justice has evolved to a narrative that would be unrecognizable to our founding fathers in "Reviving the Hero Image of the Public Defender."&lt;ref name=reviving/&gt;  He has analyzed how defenders can combat the pernicious role of race in driving this culture in "Implicitly Unjust."&lt;ref name=implicit/&gt;  And in "Retuning Gideon's Trumpet," he answers skeptics who believe public defenders are only important to individuals and play no role in driving systemic reform.&lt;ref name=retuning/&gt;

Rapping frequently addresses criminal justice issues of the day by promoting a narrative in which a movement of public defenders, serving as the voice for the vast majority of people in the criminal justice system, serve as the catalyst for reform.  As the nation grappled with a seeming epidemic of police killings of young black men like Michael Brown, [[Eric Garner]], and Tamir Rice, Rapping urged that we not see that issue as disconnected from "routine injustice" destroying poor communities of color every day.  In "It's Not Just the Cops"&lt;ref name=cops/&gt; and "From Ferguson to Staten Island: In Case Anyone Doubted the Public Needs Defending,"&lt;ref name=Ferguson/&gt; he argues that public defenders are a necessary component to a comprehensive strategy to realize equal justice that is illusive throughout the criminal justice system.  In "The Other Baltimore Story," he makes a similar argument as the nation focused its attention on the killing of [[Death of Freddie Gray|Freddy Gray]] by reminding us of the routine injustice in [[Baltimore]] through the story of Ronald Hammond, and the response of public defenders.&lt;ref name=bmore/&gt;

In articles like "Continuing the March of Civil Rights Warriors in Selma,"&lt;ref name=selma/&gt; "One of the Most Important Civil and Human Rights Battles of Our Time,"&lt;ref name=battle/&gt; and "Redefining Success as a Public Defender,"&lt;ref name=redefine/&gt; Rapping makes the case that criminal justice is the civil rights struggle of this generation and that public defenders are on the front lines of that battle.

He routinely tips his hat to the men and women who represent poor people accused of crimes, particularly in essays like "Reviving the Hero Image of the Public Defender By Changing the Story of Our Clients,"&lt;ref name=hero/&gt; "To All the Patriots Out There, and Especially Our Public Defenders,"&lt;ref name=patriots/&gt; and "Gideon's Orchestra: It's Time For the Encore."&lt;ref name=orchestra/&gt;  And in pieces like "The Special Few"&lt;ref name=special/&gt; and "Who Will Heal the Public Defenders,"&lt;ref name=heal/&gt; he explains the emotional toll that makes this work so difficult.

Rapping's 2015 TEDx Atlanta talk&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-j20aGs6uU|title=Building a new generation of public defenders - Jonathan Rapping - TEDxAtlanta|date=8 May 2015|work=YouTube|accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a powerful articulation of the critical role of culture in shaping our criminal justice system and the importance of a public defender movement to transforming it.

==Vedic background==

In the [[Rig Veda]], [[Soma (drink)|Soma]], the Vedic symbol for deep spiritual truth, is addressed as ''Madhu'', the nector or ambrosia, the drink of Immortality sought by both gods and men. Rishi [[Vamadeva]] has described how the saving of the knowledge of ''Madhu'' or ''Soma'' Doctrine came to him through a hawk in a sudden flash in his darkest hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Indian Education: Brahamanical and Buddhist|author=Radha Kumad Mookerji|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=14, 15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mjFfqpq7HhkC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=Madhu+vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tufYU7uMD4vh8AXC84HoBw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAThk#v=onepage&amp;q=Madhu%20vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that Rishi Dadhichi had his ''ashrama'' in Dudheshwara on the banks of [[Sabarmati River]] near present-day [[Ahmedabad]]. His name appears in the [[Rig Veda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Spiritual India Handbook|author=Stephen Knapp|publisher=Jaico Publishing|page=504|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=djI5mL2qeocC&amp;pg=PT504&amp;dq=Madhu+vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=muHYU9mnBI3k8AWl44DQCg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Madhu%20vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dadhichi was a sage of Vedic repute (Rig Veda I.84.13: इन्द्रो दधीचो अस्थ भिर्वृत्राण्यप्रतिष्कुतः| जघान नवतीर्नव ||). He was the son of Rishi [[Atharvan]] of the [[Atharvaveda]], and the father of [[Pippalada]] of the [[Prasna Upanishad]]. His name is seen to occur in the first Mandala of the Rig Veda, and in the [[Bhagavata Purana]]. Rishi Kakshivana,the sage of the [[Rig Veda]] [[Sukta]] 119 which is addressed to the [[Ashvins]], in [[Mantra]] 9 tells us :

:उत स्या वां मधुमन्मक्षिकारपन्मदे सोमरयौशिजा हुवन्यति |
:युवं दधीचो मन आ विवास्थोऽथा शिरः प्रति वामश्व्यं वदत् ||

:"The bee desirous of honey sang praise-song for you. Aushij in delight of Soma tells how Dadhichi, told you the secret of his mind after the head of his horse was cured."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rig Veda, The Rise of Aryan Power, Book 1|publisher=The Rise of Aryan Power|page=261|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HF80jlFPpc4C&amp;pg=PA261&amp;lpg=PA261&amp;dq=dadhichi+rig+veda&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=utgUL0lgfl&amp;sig=8wvJyxOt0REMt0Jv26Uj6cTBo6Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=npnZU9bRDNWRuASi5YGQBQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dadhichi%20rig%20veda&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dadhichi's exposition==

Dadhichi knew the secret of the ''Madhu-vidya''; he held the doctrine of the mutual interdependence of things, because all things are indissolubly connected in and through the Self. As all the spokes are contained between the axle and felly of a wheel, all things and all selves are connected in and through the Supreme Self. Nothing exists that is not covered by the Supreme Self. Thus, he taught the doctrine of the supreme existence of the one, and the apparent existence of the many.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Constructive Survey of upanishadic Philosophy|author=R.D.Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|page=36|url= http://www.worldcat.org/title/constructive-survey-of-upanishadic-philosophy-being-an-introduction-to-the-thought-of-the-upanishads/oclc/799119712 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dadhichi states that the sun is surely the honey of the gods. Of it, heaven is surely the bent bamboo. The intermediate-space is the hive. The rays are the off-springs. Of that sun, those which are the eastern rays, they themselves are its eastern cells. The ''Rk-mantras'' are verily the bees. The Rig Veda is indeed the flower. Those waters are the nectars. They, which are verily these ''Rk-mantras'' – heated up this Rig Veda. From that which was heated up issued the juice in the form of fame, lustre, vigours of organs, strength, and eatable food. It flowed profusely and settled on a side of the sun. That verily is this, which is the red appearance (aspect) of the sun. Thus, he begins narrating the scheme of colours – red, white and black which are the different colours of the sun, and concludes that the Vedas indeed are the nectars.`&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chandogya Upanishad|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=166–175|url= https://advaitaashrama.org/Book/Search/Author=Swami%20Gambhirananda  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

''Madhu-vidya'' occupies a unique place in the Upanishadic scheme of ''[[upasana]] '', due to its supremely hidden significance and peculiarly mystic presentation. Chandogya Upanishad takes the Sun as the main symbol and works out the ''vidya'' thereon; Brihadaranyaka Upanishad depicts a long series of cause and effect, showing their mutual interdependence and finally leads to the Atman which is shown to be the supreme source of everything else. [[Adi Shankara|Sankara]] takes ''madhu'' to mean effect, and he also accepts the primary sense of delight. The effects that flow are not mere imaginary things but are actualities that become visualised; every effect takes shape in a particular form or colour which signifies its concretisation and completion but the essence or the honey has no particular form or colour because it happens to be beyond all manifestations; it is recognized by the heaving at the centre of the Sun. Chandogya Upanishad concludes by saying that, to him, who gains this knowledge, there dawns the eternal day. In the case of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the search for the essence begins with the earth, the essence of all ''bhutas'' or creatures, the effects of the earth and essence are identical. All physical, moral and psychical principles make up man who in turn produces these principles, beyond man is the composite self of body, mind etc., the producer of all this – this [[Brahman]] is the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], the very self of the seeker; nothing exists apart from it, everything is of the nature of everything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in the Upanishads|author=Govindagopal Mukhopadhyaya|publisher=Pilgrim Books|pages=197–203|url= http://www.abebooks.com/Studies-Upanishads-Govindagopal-Mukhopadhyaya-Pilgrims-Publishing/12423632861/bd  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implication==

''Madhu-vidya'' establishes the following five truths:-
:1)	The correspondence and interrelationships between the elements of the external world and the individual beings are analogous to those existing between the honey and the bees.
:2)	There is only one supreme god and that is [[Brahman]]. All the divine powers witnessed in the macrocosm (the external world) and the microcosm (the individual being), are but his manifestations. Brahman behind the cosmic universe is same as the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] underlying the individual self.
:3)	Brahman exists within each and every element of the external universe and also within the individual beings as their essence (''[[Dharma]]'' or law). He is immanent through and through. The idea of transcendent God separate from the external universe and the individual is rejected.
:4)	The eternal laws governing the union of the two fundamental principles – ''Annam'' ('matter') and the ''[[prana]]''  ('life-breath') – and the interaction between the elements of the macrocosm and the microcosm and the evolutions from these interactions and unions are also Brahman.
:5)	Brahman is an integral whole and unity like a wheel; in Brahman are held together all the elements of the external universe, all worlds, all divinities and all breathing creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In search of Reality|author=O.N.Krishnan|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FROVycG3kP8C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=Madhu+vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YODYU8-0LIHi8AXkx4LYAw&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Madhu%20vidya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chandogya Upanishad (III.i.1) begins teaching ''Madhu Vidya'' by stating – The Sun is verily honey to the [[Devatas (Vedanta)|Devas]] (''[[Vasu]]s'', ''[[Rudras]]'', ''[[Ādityas|Aditya]]s'', ''[[Maruts]]'' and ''Sadhyas''), the Heaven is like the cross-beam, the intermediate region is the beehive; and the rays are the sons. But, this [[Vidya (Knowledge)|vidya]] does not teach meditation on ''Devas'' but on Brahman who is also known by the names ''Devas'' are known; it is a Brahma-vidya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sacred Books of the Hindus Vol.5, Part 1|publisher=Genesis Publishing|page=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TD2TmogOfdYC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=Madhu+vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YODYU8-0LIHi8AXkx4LYAw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Madhu%20vidya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bondage that is experienced as individuals is due to the emphasis on individuality rather than the task, and independently on the cause which is organically connected by the same Atman that is present in both; the essence of the ''Madhu-vidya'' is the cosmic contemplation of the reality of ''[[Prana]]'' within and ''[[Vayu]]'' outside, and the correlation with the Universal Consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gleanings from Rig Veda – When Science Was Reliogion|author=C.S.Moorthy|publisher=Author House|page=134|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kv86C_pd5-YC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=Madhu+vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YODYU8-0LIHi8AXkx4LYAw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Madhu%20vidya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tantra sadhana==

Transformation of ''[[Jiva]]'' into [[Shiva]] is the goal of ''Tantra sadhana''; ''Jiva'' is Shiva in the state of bondage due to ''[[Saṃskāra|samskaras]]'' whose increase must be halted for attaining release. When a ''sadhaka'' takes initiation he comes to know the art of stopping further increase of ''samskaras''. This art is known as ''Madhu-vidya'' whose practice burns the seed of ''samskaras'' and paves the path for liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tantra, Its Mystic and Scientific Basis|author=Lalaan Prasad Singh|publisher=Concept Publishing|page=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1pz28mw2zywC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=Madhu+vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=muHYU9mnBI3k8AWl44DQCg&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Madhu%20vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hindu philosophy]], '''Mauna''' (Silence), which has a voice of its own, refers to peace of mind, inner quietude, [[Samadhi]] and the Absolute Reality. The [[Hindu]] texts insist upon proper understanding of silence by experiencing it through control of speech and practice.

== Background ==

'''Mauna''' ([[Sanskrit]]: मौनम्) or Maunitva (मौनित्व) means – silence, taciturnity, silence of the mind – as in मौनमुद्रा (the attitude of silence) and मौनव्रतम् (a vow of silence) or मौनिन् (observing vow of silence). A [[Sanskrit]] Dictionary gives many words such as – अनिर्वचनम् (silence, not uttering anything), अभाषणम् (silence, not speaking), अवचन (absence of assertion, silence, taciturnity), अव्याहृतम् (silence), निःशब्दम् (silence, a calm), - as referring to silence. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author= Vaman Shivram Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=apte&amp;query=Silence&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary gives the meaning of the word, Silence, as absence of sound; abstention from sounding, speech, mention, or communication; a time of such absence or abstention, taciturnity. 

[[Kumārila Bhaṭṭa|Kumarila]] lists sound as one of the eleven substances and as one of the twenty-four qualities, he does not include silence in any one of these two lists nor does he describe silence as he does sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Outlines of Indian Philosophy 1999 Ed.|author=Jadunath Sinha|publisher=Pilgrims Book|pages=336-337|url= http://www.pilgrimsbookhouse.com/xauthordetailsnew.php?mauthor=Jadunath%20Sinha }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Understanding silence ==

''Asat'', the word meaning non-existent or indescribable, appears seven times in the [[Rig Veda]]); it differs from the word, ''Mithya'', which means false or untrue, .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On Being and What There Is|author=Wilhelm Halbfass|publisher=SUNY Press|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x7cLHPj1dj8C&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=asat++rig+veda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AzdeU5KWBYuMrAfflIHoCQ&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=asat%20%20rig%20veda&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Asat'' is the opposite of ''[[Rta]]''. It is the ground of transcendence, the origin of all organized perception, the original ground any and all sounds count in order to sound, and is also called the language of non-Existence. In the sense of "non-Existence" or "inaction", ''Asat'' is simply '''silence'''; in the sense of "obscuring" or "covering" or "chaos, " it is pure noise downwards moving from which tone is a distillation ([[Rig Veda]] VII.104.1,10,11). ''Rta'' is the end of an effective synthesis of sensorium, through a whole range of clear and distinct acts of particular senses and their subsequent insights. ''Asat'' stands as the initial space-ground of indeterminate perception or of sets of organized perceptions, the sounding silence from which the worlds, gods and man emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Meditations Through the Rig Veda: Four-Dimensional Man|author=Antonio T. De Nicolas|publisher=iUniverse|page=105|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t7mNaMDu6o0C&amp;pg=PA279&amp;dq=silence+rig+veda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6wZeU661O8eGrgfWtYHQAQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=silence%20rig%20veda&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ramana Maharshi]] in the 6th paragraph of ''Nān Yār'' reminds us that only after firmly establishing our mind in our heart will our primal thought "I" which is the root of all thoughts disappear for the ever-existing real '''self''' to shine; the place (innermost core of our being) devoid of even a little trace of our primal thought "I" is ''svarupa'' (our own essential self) which alone is called ''mauna'' (silence), it is the state of egolessness. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Happiness and The Art of Being|author=Michael James|publisher=Arul Books|pages=183,193|url= http://www.happinessofbeing.com/Happiness_and_the_Art_of_Being.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experiencing silence ==

[[Kena Upanishad]] tells us -  यद्वाचाऽनभ्युदितं येन वागभ्युद्यते – "That which is not uttered by speech that by which speech is revealed" (I.5), - यच्छ्रोत्रेण न शृणोति येन श्रोत्रमिदं श्रुतम् - "That which man does not hear with the ear, that by which man knows the ear", - तदेव ब्रह्म त्वं विद्धि नेदं यदिदमुपासते - "know that to be Brahman and not this that people worship as an object" (I.9).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eight Upanishads Vol.1|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=49-53|url=https://advaitaashrama.org/Book/Detail/262 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is only when the knower is utterly negative and yet aware that the known conveys Its secret to him, that the process of knowing as emanating from the knower ceases, and that the interval between knowing and not knowing is not covered by any projection of the knower. The sensitive mind ready to receive the subtlest intimation of [[Brahman]] responds to the voice of silence. The mind liberated from even the attribute of ''[[sattva]]'' must stand in front of utter silence. [[Yajnavalkya]] insists that the spiritual man in order to experience Brahman must transcend both silence (''mauna'') and non-silence (''amauna'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Call of the Upanishads|author=Rohit Mehta|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=38,276|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_aGXsz4C2z8C&amp;pg=PA276&amp;dq=silence+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZBNeU4eTKIWurAfwp4GACQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=silence%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practice of silence ==

Human knowledge suffers from the limitation of incompleteness but the [[Vedantic]] view of knowledge is rooted in self-revelation or self-luminosity. The truth of knowledge consists in its non-contradictedness and novelty, and not in mere correspondence or coherence. Metaphysical knowledge essentially implies permanent and changeless certitude. [[Nididhyasana]] with the aid of ''sravana'' (with a basis of the [[Mahavakyas]]) must precede knowledge. [[Sruti]] is the starting point of enquiry. [[Śraddhā|Sraddha]] (Provisional belief), induced by [[Sabda]] or [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agama]] (authoritative statements) and supported by [[Anubhava]] (experiences or realizations), is required to start an enquiry. Knowledge is truth and truth is the foundation of the Upanishads. Truthfulness in speech leads to truthfulness in spirit because in truth is initiation based. Truth is based on the heart, and reason is the true abode of truth. [[Satya]] or truth is a quality of speech and [[Dharma]] is the actualization of truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in the Upanishads 1999 Ed.|author=Govindagopal Mukhopadhyaya|publisher=Pilgrims Book| pages=121-123,136 -137|url=http://www.pilgrimsbookhouse.com/xauthordetailsnew.php?mauthor=Govinda%20Gopal%20Mukhopadhyaya}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Control of speech is not forced silence. Meditation is the practice of silence. The state of [[Samadhi]] is the boundless ocean of silence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Vedanta way to Peace and Happiness|author=Swami Adiswarananda|publisher=Jaico Publishing House|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5WocujrSu_sC&amp;pg=PT166&amp;dq=silence+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wA9eU6TRK4XrrAeZkoBI&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=silence%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absorptive concentration is Samadhi. Superconscious trance is [[Nirbīja|nirbija]] (seedless) because it is objectless and devoid of ignorance which is the seed of bondage. The dispositions of super-conscious trances, brought about by supreme detachment due to faith (which is purity of mind), overpower and counteract the dispositions of conscious trances, when these are destroyed along with the mind to merge in Prakrti, the pure self, liberated, abides in its essential nature and shines forth with its light of transcendental consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Outlines of Indian Philosophy 1999 Ed.|author=Jadunath Sinha|publisher=Pilgrims Book|pages=312-313|url= http://www.pilgrimsbookhouse.com/xauthordetailsnew.php?mauthor=Jadunath%20Sinha }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attribute-less Brahman denoted by silence ==

The attribute-less [[Brahman]] is explained sometimes by silence. In his commentary on [[Brahma Sutras]] III.ii.17, [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] tells us that Bhadhva, questioned about Brahman by Bashkalin asked him to learn Brahman and became silent; on second and third questioning by Bashkalin he replied – " I am teaching you indeed, but you do not understand. Silence is that Self." The soundless ''Ardhamatra'', that lingers after the three differentiated sounds of [[Pranava]] (''[[Om]]'') die away, is [[Turiya]] or Pure Consciousness, the attributeless Brahman ([[Mandukya Upanishad]] 12).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Principal Upanishads|publisher=Courier Diver Publications|pages=33,156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BQxXk7pAx0cC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=silence+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fideU5GKH8iLrQeE74BI&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=silence%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The causal and the resultant conditions, the non-apprehension and misapprehension of Reality, do not exist in Turiya. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eight Upanishads Vol.2 |publisher=Advaita Ashrama|page=213|url= https://advaitaashrama.org/Book/Detail/263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silence is Awareness, it is the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], the Self ([[Mundaka Upanishad]] II.ii.6) .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Know the Upanishads|author=Ramanuj Prasad|publisher=S.Publishers|page=59|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZpTC2rIhWegC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=silence++upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ty1eU9G-J8bVrQfJq4HYBw&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=silence%20%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absolutistic interpretation is that silence is the genuine teaching about the ultimate Reality, because the Absolute is beyond the scope of speech and thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism|publisher=SUNY Press|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p1bASTAOhjoC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=silence+advaita+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ta9dU5b9EoStrAeR0oDACg&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=silence%20advaita%20vedanta&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kaivalya ==

[[Samkhya]] and [[Yoga]] are dualistic systems; they treat [[Purusa]] and [[Prakrti]] as equally real entities even though absolutely opposed to each other. The concept of [[Kaivalya]] signifies that the aim of these systems is to secure an "aloneness" by severing all connections. The discriminating knowledge does cause the separation of Purusa from Prakrti but Prakrti remains intact to cause further bondage. Kaivalya is false transcendence achieved by cutting oneself of altogether from all manifestation and through the ushering in of a blissful silence. The true transcendence, too, is a state above all manifestation, but not aloof or away from transcendence. True transcendence is also silence, but not the silence that is opposed to movement or change because its inherent nature is not disturbed. True transcendence is not the silence of death benumbing the creative flow of life but the silence of which both death and immortality are equal shadows – यस्य च्छायामृतं यस्य मृत्युः ([[Rig Veda]] X.121.2). The true [[advaita]] never needs the excision of a second in order to achieve its non-duality. The Mimamsakas took the view that nothing but exhaustion of all actions can lead to liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in the Upanishads 1999 Ed.|author=Govindagopal Mukhopadhyaya|publisher=Pilgrims Book| page=64|url=http://www.pilgrimsbookhouse.com/xauthordetailsnew.php?mauthor=Govinda%20Gopal%20Mukhopadhyaya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==

[[Yama]] tells [[Naciketa]] ([[Katha Upanishad]] I.iii.13) that the discriminating mind should merge the organ of speech into the mind; he who has extracted and tasted the real essence enjoys true happiness in total silence and all alone united with the source and protecting it ([[Rig Veda]] I.79.3). Sankara explains this unity by citing Badhva’s response to Bashkalin. The silence referred to by Badhva as the indescribable nature of Brahman is meant to be felt somewhere deep within. It is of far greater magnitude than mere looking into one’s own mind, far more acute than even the sharpest intellect that can ever read into and decipher its codes. This silence compels the framing of questions, and by itself is the answer not merely in the sound of speech that covers it and reaches the ears. The letters of the alphabet and the words they constitute do not emit the sound or sounds they represent; the sounds they depict are of no value if there is no meaning attached. The silence spoken of by Badhva by itself speaks out most eloquently because it has a meaning attached to it; we are that meaning as also the interpretation of its subtleness. Rishi Ayasya ([[Rig Veda]] IX.46.2) prays –

: परिष्कृतास इन्दवो योषेव पित्र्यावती |
: वायुं सोमा असृक्षत ||

He states that having acquired the knowledge of the Highest the learned people easily unravel the deeply hidden meaning of the most subtle kind. The letters of the alphabet are the limiting adjuncts of the sounds they denote. The space that exists between two lines is the same that exists between sentences, between words and between letters making up those words. But this space denotes no sound; it is devoid of limiting adjuncts or barriers, the same as the Supreme Being who is a mass of Pure Consciousness devoid of limiting adjuncts. Thus, Space which is silent, unchangeable, eternal and infinite is Brahman. Silence is the [[Avyakta]], the only reality whereas sound is the other Avyakta which is [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] or [[Prakrti]] that projects itself on account of its three qualities ([[guna]]s). Turiya is beyond utterance and is therefore called the Amatra. Sankara tells us that ignorance is the cause of all conditioned experiences, from the darkness of ignorance arises the sense of separateness, and an ignorant person is hardly aware of the continuous perception of Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|author=Ravinder Kumar Soni|publisher=GBD Books|pages=61-66|url=http://indiabookmart.com/Book_detail.asp?Bid=The+Illumination+Of+Knowledge&amp;catId=9788188951208 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110713024745/http://indiabookmart.com/Book_detail.asp?Bid=The+Illumination+Of+Knowledge&amp;catId=9788188951208 |archivedate=2011-07-13}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]] and [[probability theory]], '''mean field theory''' ('''MFT''' also known as '''self-consistent field theory''') studies the behavior of large and complex [[stochastic]] models by studying a simpler model. Such models consider a large number of small individual components that interact with each other. The effect of all the other individuals on any given individual is approximated by a single averaged effect, thus reducing a [[many-body problem]] to a [[one-body problem]].

The ideas first appeared in physics in the work of [[Pierre Curie]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kadanoff | first1 = L.

A [[many-body system]] with interactions is generally very difficult to solve exactly, except for extremely simple cases ([[random field]] theory, 1D [[Ising model]]). The n-body system is replaced by a 1-body problem with a chosen good external field. The external field replaces the interaction of all the other particles to an arbitrary particle.  The great difficulty (e.g., when computing the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] of the system) is the treatment of [[combinatorics]] generated by the interaction terms in the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] when summing over all states. The goal of mean field theory is to resolve these combinatorial problems. MFT is known under a great many names and guises. Similar techniques include [[Bragg–Williams approximation]], models on [[Bethe lattice]], [[Landau theory]], [[Pierre–Weiss approximation]], [[Flory–Huggins solution theory]], and [[Scheutjens–Fleer theory]].

The main idea of MFT is to replace all interactions to any one body with an average or effective interaction, sometimes called a ''molecular field''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chaikin|first=P. M.  |first2=T. C. |last2=Lubensky |title=Principles of condensed matter physics|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-79450-3|edition=4th print}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This reduces any multi-body problem into an effective one-body problem.  The ease of solving MFT problems means that some insight into the behavior of the system can be obtained at a relatively low cost.

In [[classical field theory|field theory]], the Hamiltonian may be expanded in terms of the magnitude of fluctuations around the mean of the field.  In this context, MFT can be viewed as the "zeroth-order" expansion of the Hamiltonian in fluctuations.  Physically, this means an MFT system has no fluctuations, but this coincides with the idea that one is replacing all interactions with a "mean field".  Quite often, in the formalism of fluctuations, MFT provides a convenient launch-point to studying first or second order fluctuations.

In general, dimensionality plays a strong role in determining whether a mean-field approach will work for any particular problem.  In MFT, many interactions are replaced by one effective interaction.  Then it naturally follows that if the field or particle exhibits many interactions in the original system, MFT will be more accurate for such a system.  This is true in cases of high dimensionality, when the Hamiltonian includes long-range forces, or when the particles are extended (e.g., polymers). The [[Ginzburg criterion]] is the formal expression of how fluctuations render MFT a poor approximation, often depending upon the number of spatial dimensions in the system of interest.

While MFT arose primarily in the field of [[statistical mechanics]], it has more recently been applied elsewhere, for example in [[inference]], [[graphical models]] theory, [[neuroscience]], and [[artificial intelligence]].

==Formal approach==
The formal basis for mean field theory is the [[Helmholtz free energy#Bogoliubov inequality|Bogoliubov inequality]]. This inequality states that the [[thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] of a system with Hamiltonian

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{H}_0 + \Delta \mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;

has the following upper bound:

:&lt;math&gt;F \leq F_0 \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \langle \mathcal{H} \rangle_0 - T S_0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[entropy]] and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_0&lt;/math&gt; are Helmholtz free energies. The average is taken over the equilibrium ensemble of the reference system with Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_{0}&lt;/math&gt;. In the special case that the reference Hamiltonian is that of a non-interacting system and can thus be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_0 = \sum_{i=1}^N h_i \left( \xi_i \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\left(\xi_i\right) &lt;/math&gt; is shorthand for the [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] of the individual components of our statistical system (atoms, spins and so forth), one can consider sharpening the upper bound by minimizing the right hand side of the inequality. The minimizing reference system is then the "best" approximation to the true system using non-correlated degrees of freedom, and is known as the '''mean field approximation'''.

For the most common case that the target Hamiltonian contains only pairwise interactions, ''i.e.,''

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H} = \sum_{(i,j) \in \mathcal{P}} V_{i,j} \left( \xi_i, \xi_j \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of pairs that interact, the minimizing procedure can be carried out formally. Define &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tr}_i f(\xi_i)&lt;/math&gt; as the generalized sum of the observable &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; over the degrees of freedom of the single component (sum for discrete variables, integrals for continuous ones). The approximating free energy is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  F_{0} ={} &amp;\operatorname{Tr}_{1,2,\ldots,N} \mathcal{H} \left(\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots,\xi_N\right) P^{(N)}_0 \left(\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots,\xi_N\right) \\
            &amp;{} + kT \,\operatorname{Tr}_{1,2,\ldots,N} P^{(N)}_0 \left(\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots,\xi_N\right) \log P^{(N)}_0 \left(\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots,\xi_N\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P^{(N)}_{0}(\xi_{1},\xi_{2},...,\xi_{N})&lt;/math&gt; is the probability to find the reference system in the state specified by the variables &lt;math&gt;(\xi_{1},\xi_{2},...,\xi_{N})&lt;/math&gt;. This probability is given by the normalized [[Boltzmann factor]]
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  P^{(N)}_0(\xi_1,\xi_2,\ldots,\xi_N)
    &amp; {}= \frac{1}{Z^{(N)}_0} e^{-\beta \mathcal{H}_0 (\xi_1, \xi_2, \ldots, \xi_N)} \\
    &amp; {}= \prod_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{Z_0} e^{-\beta h_i \left( \xi_i \right)} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \prod_{i=1}^N P^{(i)}_0 (\xi_i)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; Z_0 &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]].  Thus
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  F_0 ={} &amp;\sum_{(i,j)\in\mathcal{P}} \operatorname{Tr}_{i,j} V_{i,j} \left( \xi_i,\xi_j \right) P^{(i)}_0 (\xi_i) P^{(j)}_0 (\xi_j)  \\
          &amp;{} + kT \sum_{i=1}^N \operatorname{Tr}_i P^{(i)}_0 (\xi_i) \log P^{(i)}_0 (\xi_i).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In order to minimize we take the derivative with respect to the single degree-of-freedom probabilities &lt;math&gt;P^{(i)}_0&lt;/math&gt; using a [[Lagrange multiplier]] to ensure proper normalization. The end result is the set of self-consistency equations
:&lt;math&gt;P^{(i)}_0(\xi_i) = \frac{1}{Z_0} e^{-\beta h_i^{MF}(\xi_i)}\qquad i = 1, 2, \ldots, N&lt;/math&gt;

where the mean field is given by
:&lt;math&gt;h_i^{MF}\left(\xi_i\right) = \sum_{\{j|(i,j)\in\mathcal{P}\}} \operatorname{Tr}_j V_{i,j} \left( \xi_i,\xi_j \right) P^{(j)}_0 \left(\xi_j\right).&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
Mean field theory can be applied to a number of physical systems so as to study phenomena such as [[phase transitions]].&lt;ref name=Stanley&gt;

===Ising Model===
Consider the [[Ising model]] on a &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional lattice.  The Hamiltonian is given by
:&lt;math&gt;H = -J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} s_i s_j - h \sum_i s_i&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;\sum_{\langle i,j \rangle}&lt;/math&gt; indicates summation over the pair of nearest neighbors &lt;math&gt;\langle i,j \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;s_i = \pm 1&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;s_j&lt;/math&gt; are neighboring Ising spins.

Let us transform our spin variable by introducing the fluctuation from its mean value &lt;math&gt; m_i \equiv \langle s_i \rangle &lt;/math&gt;. We may rewrite the Hamiltonian:
:&lt;math&gt;H = -J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \left(m_i + \delta s_i\right)\left(m_j + \delta s_j\right) - h \sum_i s_i&lt;/math&gt;

where we define &lt;math&gt; \delta s_i \equiv  s_i - m_i &lt;/math&gt;; this is the ''fluctuation'' of the spin.

If we expand the right hand side, we obtain one term that is entirely dependent on the mean values of the spins, and independent of the spin configurations.  This is the trivial term, which does not affect the statistical properties of the system.  The next term is the one involving the product of the mean value of the spin and the fluctuation value.  Finally, the last term involves a product of two fluctuation values.

The mean-field approximation consists of neglecting this second order fluctuation term. These fluctuations are enhanced at low dimensions, making MFT a better approximation for high dimensions.

:&lt;math&gt;H \approx H^{MF} \equiv -J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \left(m_i m_j + m_i \delta s_j + m_j \delta s_i \right) - h \sum_i s_i&lt;/math&gt;

Again, the summand can be reexpanded. In addition, we expect that the mean value of each spin is site-independent, since the Ising chain is translationally invariant. This yields

:&lt;math&gt;H^{MF} = -J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \left( m^2 + 2m(s_i - m) \right) - h \sum_i s_i&lt;/math&gt;

The summation over neighboring spins can be rewritten as &lt;math&gt; \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_i \sum_{j\in nn(i)}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;nn(i)&lt;/math&gt; means 'nearest-neighbor of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;' and the &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt; prefactor avoids double-counting, since each bond participates in two spins. Simplifying leads to the final expression
:&lt;math&gt;H^{MF} = \frac{J m^2 N z}{2} - \underbrace{(h + m J z)}_{h^\text{eff}} \sum_i s_i &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is the [[coordination number]]. At this point, the Ising Hamiltonian has been ''decoupled'' into a sum of one-body Hamiltonians with an ''effective mean-field'' &lt;math&gt;h^\text{eff} = h + J z m&lt;/math&gt; which is the sum of the external field &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and of the ''mean-field'' induced by the neighboring spins. It is worth noting that this mean field directly depends on the number of nearest neighbors and thus on the dimension of the system (for instance, for a hypercubic lattice of dimension &lt;math&gt; d&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; z = 2 d&lt;/math&gt;).

Substituting this Hamiltonian into the partition function, and solving the effective 1D problem, we obtain

:&lt;math&gt; Z = e^{-\frac{\beta J m^2 Nz}{2}} \left[2 \cosh\left(\frac{h + m J z}{k_BT} \right)\right]^N &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; is the number of lattice sites.  This is a closed and exact expression for the partition function of the system.  We may obtain the free energy of the system, and calculate [[critical exponent]]s. In particular, we can obtain the magnetization &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; as a function of &lt;math&gt;h^{\mathrm{eff}}&lt;/math&gt;.

We thus have two equations between &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h^\text{eff}&lt;/math&gt;, allowing us to determine &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; as a function of temperature. This leads to the following observation:
* for temperatures greater than a certain value &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt;, the only solution is &lt;math&gt;m = 0&lt;/math&gt;. The system is paramagnetic.
* for &lt;math&gt;T &lt; T_c&lt;/math&gt;, there are two non-zero solutions: &lt;math&gt; m = \pm m_0 &lt;/math&gt;. The system is ferromagnetic.

&lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt; is given by the following relation: &lt;math&gt; T_c = \frac{J z}{k_B} &lt;/math&gt;.
This shows that MFT can account for the ferromagnetic phase transition.

===Application to other systems===
Similarly, MFT can be applied to other types of Hamiltonian as in the following cases:
* To study the metal-[[superconductor]] transition. In this case, the analog of the magnetization is the superconducting gap &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;.
* The molecular field of a [[liquid crystal]] that emerges when the [[Laplacian]] of the director field is non-zero.
* To determine the optimal [[amino acid]] [[side chain]] packing given a fixed [[tertiary structure|protein backbone]] in [[protein structure prediction]] (see [[Self-consistent mean field (biology)]]).
* To determine the [[elasticity (physics)|elastic properties]] of a composite material.

==Extension to time-dependent mean fields==
{{Main|Dynamical mean field theory}}

In mean-field theory, the mean field appearing in the single-site problem is a scalar or vectorial time-independent quantity. However, this need not always be the case: in a variant of mean-field theory called [[dynamical mean field theory]] (DMFT), the mean-field becomes a time-dependent quantity. For instance, DMFT can be applied to the [[Hubbard model]] to study the metal-Mott insulator transition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1751">'''Media Scape''' is a set of meetings with exhibitions, film/video programs and symposia of international artists in the context of [[media art]]. Media Scape was founded in May 1991 by [[Heiko Daxl]], [[Ingeborg Fülepp]], [[Bojan Baletic]] and [[Malcolm Le Grice]] in [[Zagreb]] (Croatia).

From 1991 to 1999 Media Scape took place annually in the [[Mimara Museum]], in the MultimediaCentar, in the HDLU (Hrvatsko drustvo likovnih umjetnika - Croatian Association of Fine Arts) and in the Museum for Contemporary Art in Zagreb. Within this time frame around 300 artists from more than 30 countries participated.

In the year 2005 Media Scape moved into the Galerija Rigo/Museum Lapidarium in the city of [[Novigrad, Istria]] (Cittánova), led by Jerica Ziherl, in the Croatian region of [[Istria]].
Since 2006 in co-operation with [[Noam Braslavsky]] the Galerie der Künste (GdK) in [[Berlin]], became an additional venue under the title "[[Strictly Berlin]]".
In 2010 Media Scape came back to Zagreb under the title "The Year We Make Contact" and will continue in 2013 as the MSBZ "Media Scape Biennale Zagreb" for Contemporary Time Based Art.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2009}}

'''Metafiction''' is a form of literature that emphasizes its own constructedness in a way that continually reminds the reader to be aware that they are reading or viewing a fictional work. Metafiction is self-conscious about language, literary form, storytelling, and directly or indirectly draw attention to their status as artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metafiction – The Theory and Practice of Self-Conscious Fiction|last=Waugh|first=Patricia|publisher=Routledge|year=1984|isbn=|location=London, New York|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metafiction is frequently used as a form of parody or a tool to undermine literary conventions and explore the relationship between literature and reality, life, and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Metafiction – A Poetological Study of Metafiction in English since 1939|last=Imhof|first=Rüdiger|publisher=Carl Winter Universitätsverlag|year=1986|isbn=|location=Heidelberg|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although metafiction is most commonly associated with [[postmodern literature]], its use can be traced back to much earlier works of fiction, such as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s [[The Canterbury Tales|''Canterbury Tales'']] (1387), [[Miguel de Cervantes]]' ''[[Don Quixote]]'' (1605), [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]'' (c.1608), [[Laurence Sterne]]'s ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'' (1759), [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]'s [[Vanity Fair (novel)|''Vanity Fair'']] (1847), as well as more recent works such as [[J. R. R. Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1954–1955), or [[Douglas Adams]]' ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' (1979). Metafiction, however, became particularly prominent in the 1960s, with authors and works such as [[John Barth]]'s ''[[Lost in the Funhouse]]'', [[Robert Coover]]'s "The Babysitter" and "The Magic Poker", [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'',&lt;ref name="jensen"&gt;Jensen, Mikkel (2016) "[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00144940.2015.1133546 Janus-Headed Postmodernism: The Opening Lines of ''Slaughterhouse-Five'']" in ''[[The Explicator]]'', 74:1, 8-11.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Fowles]]' ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'',  [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s ''[[The Crying of Lot 49]]'' and [[William H. Gass]]'s ''Willie Master's Lonesome Wife''.

== History of the term ==
The term 'metafiction' was coined in 1970 by [[William H. Gass]] in his book ''Fiction and the Figures of Life''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fiction and the Figures of Life|last=Gass|first=William H.|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|year=1970|isbn=|location=New York|pages=24-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gass describes the increasing use of metafiction at the time as a result of authors developing a better understanding of the medium. This new understanding of the medium led to a major change in the approach toward fiction. Theoretical issues became more prominent aspects, resulting in an increased self-reflexivity and formal uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fiction and the Figures of Life|last=Gass|first=William H.|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|year=1970|isbn=|location=New York|pages=24-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metafiction – The Theory and Practice of Self-Conscious Fiction|last=Waugh|first=Patricia|publisher=Routledge|year=1984|isbn=|location=London, New York|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Scholes]] expands upon Gass' theory and identifies four forms of criticism on fiction, which he refers to as formal, behavioural, structural, and philosophical criticism. Metafiction assimilates these perspectives into the fictional process, putting emphasis on one or more of these aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fabulation and Metafiction|last=Scholes|first=Robert|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1979|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=111-115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These developments were part of a larger movement (arguably a 'metareferential turn'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Metareferential Turn in Contemporary Arts and Media: Forms, Functions, Attempts at Explanation|last=|first=|publisher=Rodopi|year=2011|isbn=|editor-last=Wolf|editor-first=Werner|series=Studies in Intermediality 5|location=Amsterdam|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) which, approximately from the 1960s onwards, was the consequence of an increasing social and cultural self-consciousness, stemming from, as [[Patricia Waugh]] puts it, "a more general cultural interest in the problem of how human beings reflect, construct and mediate their experience in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metafiction – The Theory and Practice of Self-Conscious Fiction|last=Waugh|first=Patricia|publisher=Routledge|year=1984|isbn=|location=London, New York|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to this development, an increasing number of novelists rejected the notion of rendering the world through fiction. The new principle became to create through the medium of language a world that does not reflect the real world. Language was considered an "independent, self-contained system which generates its own 'meanings.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metafiction – The Theory and Practice of Self-Conscious Fiction|last=Waugh|first=Patricia|publisher=Routledge|year=1984|isbn=|location=London, New York|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a means of mediating knowledge of the world. Thus, literary fiction, which constructs worlds through language, became a model for the construction of 'reality' rather than a reflection of it. Reality itself became regarded as a construct instead of an objective truth. Through its formal self-exploration, metafiction thus became the device that explores the question of how human beings construct their experience of the world.

Robert Scholes identifies the time around 1970 as the peak of experimental fiction (which metafiction is an instrumental part of) and names a lack of commercial and critical success as reasons for its subsequent decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fabulation and Metafiction|last=Scholes|first=Robert|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1979|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development toward metafictional writing in postmodernism generated mixed responses. Some critics argued that it signified the decadence of the novel and an exhaustion of the artistic capabilities of the medium, with some going as far as to call it the '[[death of the novel]]'. Others see the self-consciousness of fictional writing as a way to gain deeper understanding of the medium and a path that leads to innovation that resulted in the emergence of new forms of literature, such as the [[Historiographic metafiction|historiographic novel]] by [[Linda Hutcheon]].

== Forms ==
According to Werner Wolf, metafiction can be differentiated into four pairs of forms that can be combined with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Werner (2009). "Metareference across Media: The Concept, its Transmedial Potentials and Problems, Main Forms and Functions". ''Metareference across Media: Theory and Case Studies''. Studies in Intermediality 4, eds. Werner Wolf, Katharina Bantleon, and Jeff Thoss. Amsterdam: Rodopi. pp. 37-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Explicit/implicit metafiction ===
Explicit metafiction is identifiable through its use of clear metafictional elements on the surface of a text. It comments on its own artificiality and is quotable. Explicit metafiction is described as a mode of telling. An example would be a narrator explaining the process of creating the story they are telling. 

Rather than commenting on the text, implicit metafiction foregrounds the medium or its status as an artefact through various, for example disruptive, techniques such as [[metalepsis]]. It relies more than other forms of metafiction on the reader's ability to recognize these devices in order to evoke a metafictional reading. Implicit metafiction is described as a mode of showing.

=== Direct/indirect metafiction ===
Direct metafiction establishes a reference within the text one is just reading. In contrast to this, indirect metafiction consists in metareferences external to this text, such as reflections on specific other literary works or genres (as in parodies) and general discussions of aesthetic issues; since there is always a relationship between the text in which indirect metafiction occurs and the referenced external texts or issues, indirect metafiction always also impacts the text one is reading, albeit in an indirect way. 

=== Critical/non-critical metafiction ===
Critical metafiction aims to find the artificiality or fictionality of a text in some critical way, which is frequently done in [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] fiction. Non-critical metafiction does not criticize or undermine the artificiality or fictionality of a text and can, for example, be used to "suggest that the story one is reading is authentic".&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Werner (2009). "Metareference across Media: The Concept, its Transmedial Potentials and Problems, Main Forms and Functions". ''Metareference across Media: Theory and Case Studies''. Studies in Intermediality 4, eds. Werner Wolf, Katharina Bantleon, and Jeff Thoss. Amsterdam: Rodopi. p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Generally media-centred/truth- or fiction-centred metafiction ===
While all metafiction somehow deals with the medial quality of fiction or narrative and is thus generally media-centred, in some cases there is an additional focus on the truthfulness or inventedness (fictionality) of a text, which merits mention as a specific form. The suggestion of a story being authentic (a device frequently used in [[Literary realism|realistic]] fiction) would be an example of (non-critical) truth-centred metafiction.

== Examples ==

=== Laurence Sterne, ''The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman'' ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is with LOVE as with CUCKOLDOM—&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;—But now I am talking of beginning a book, and have long had a thing upon my mind to be imparted to the reader, which if not imparted now, can never be imparted to him as long as I live (whereas the COMPARISON may be imparted to him any hour of the day)—I'll just mention it, and begin in good earnest.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The thing is this.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;That of all the several ways of beginning a book which are now in practice throughout the known world, I am confident my own way of doing it is the best—I'm sure it is the most religious—for I begin with writing the first sentence—and trusting to Almighty God for the second.&lt;ref&gt;Sterne, Laurence (1759-1767/2003). ''The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman''. London:&amp;nbsp;Penguin. p. 490.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In this scene [[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|Tristram Shandy]], the eponymous character and narrator of the novel, foregrounds the process of creating literature as he interrupts his previous thought and begins to talk about the beginnings of books. The scene evokes an explicitly metafictional response to the problem (and by addressing a problem of the novel one is just reading but also a general problem the excerpt is thus an example of both direct and indirect metafiction, which may additionally be classified as generally media-centred, non-critical metafiction). Through the lack of context to this sudden change of topic (writing a book is not a plot point, nor does this scene take place at the beginning of the novel, where such a scene might be more willingly accepted by the reader) the metafictional reflection is foregrounded. Additionally, the narrator addresses the reader directly, thereby confronting the reader with the fact that they are reading a constructed text.

=== David Lodge, ''The British Museum is Falling Down'' ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;Has it ever occurred to you that novelists are using up experience at a dangerous rate? No, I see it hasn't. Well, then, consider that before the novel emerged as the dominant literary form, narrative literature dealt only with the extraordinary or the allegorical – with kings and queens, giants and dragons, sublime virtue and diabolic evil. There was no risk of confusing that sort of thing with life, of course. But as soon as the novel got going, you might pick up a book at any time and read about an ordinary chap called Joe Smith doing just the sort of things you did yourself. Now, I know what you're going to say – you're going to say that the novelist still has to invent a lot. But that's just the point: there've been such a fantastic number of novels written in the past couple of centuries that they've just about exhausted the possibilities of life. So all of us, you see, are really enacting events that have already been written about in some novel or other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The British Museum Is Falling Down|last=Lodge|first=David|publisher=McGibbon &amp; Kee|year=1965|isbn=|location=London|pages=129-130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This scene from ''[[The British Museum Is Falling Down|The British Museum is Falling Down]]'' (1965) features several instances of metafiction. First, the speaker, Adam Appleby (the protagonist of the novel) discusses the change the rise of the novel brought upon the literary landscape, specifically with regards to thematic changes that occurred. Second, he talks about the [[Mimesis|mimetic]] aspect of [[Literary realism|realist]] novels. Third, he alludes to the notion that the capabilities of literature have been exhausted, and thus to the idea of the [[death of the novel]] (all of this is explicit, critical indirect metafiction). Fourth, he covertly foregrounds that fact that the characters in the novel are fictional characters, rather than masking this aspect, as would be the case in non-metafictional writing. Therefore, this scene features metafictional elements with reference to the medium (the novel), the form of art (literature), a genre (realism), and arguably also lays bare the fictionality of the characters and thus of the novel itself (which could be classified as critical, direct, fiction-centred metafiction).

=== Jasper Fforde, ''The Eyre Affair'' ===
''[[The Eyre Affair]]'' (2001) is set in an alternate history in which it is possible to enter the world of a work of literature through the use of a machine. In the novel, literary detective [[Thursday Next]] chases a criminal through the world of [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]''. This paradoxical transgression of narrative boundaries is called [[metalepsis]], an implicitly metafictional device when used in literature. Metalepsis has a high inherent potential to disrupt [[aesthetic illusion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Breaking the Frame: Metalepsis and the Construction of the Subject|last=Malina|first=Debra|publisher=Ohio State University Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=Columbus|pages=2-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and confronts the reader with the fictionality of the text. However, as metalepsis is used as a plot device that has been introduced as part of the world of ''The Eyre Affair'' it can, in this instance, have the opposite effect and is compatible with immersion. It can thus be seen as an example of metafiction that does not (necessarily) break aesthetic illusion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2255">The '''Moscow Conceptualist''', or '''Russian Conceptualist''', movement began with the [[Sots art]] of [[Komar and Melamid]] in the early 1970s, and continued as a trend in [[Russian art]] into the 1980s.  It attempted to subvert socialist ideology using the strategies of [[conceptual art]] and [[appropriation art]].

The central figures were [[Dmitri Prigov]], [[Ilya Kabakov]], [[Irina Nakhova]], [[Viktor Pivovarov]], [[Eric Bulatov]], [[Andrei Monastyrski]] and [[Komar and Melamid]].

[[Mikhail Epstein]], in ''After the Future: The Paradoxes of Postmodernism and Contemporary Russian Culture'' (1995) explains why conceptualism is particularly appropriate to the culture and history of Russia, but also how it differs from Western Conceptualism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In the West, conceptualism substitutes "one thing for another"--a real object for its verbal description. But in Russia the object that should be replaced is simply absent.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Epstein (1995) quotes [[Ilya Kabakov]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“This contiguity, closeness, touchingness, contact with nothing, emptiness makes up, we feel, the basic peculiarity of 'Russian conceptualism'... It is like something that hangs in the air, a self-reliant thing, like a fantastic construction, connected to nothing, with its roots in nothing... So, then, we can say that our own local thinking, from the very beginning in fact, could have been called 'conceptualism'.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11692">{{Algebraic structures}}

In [[mathematics]], there are many types of [[algebraic structure]]s which are studied. [[Abstract algebra]] is primarily the study of specific algebraic structures and their properties. Algebraic structures may be viewed in different ways, however the common starting point of algebra texts is that an algebraic object incorporates one or more [[set theory|set]]s with one or more [[binary operation]]s or [[unary operation]]s satisfying a collection of [[axiom]]s.

Another branch of mathematics known as [[universal algebra]] studies algebraic structures in general.   From the universal algebra viewpoint, most structures can be divided into [[variety (universal algebra)|varieties]] and [[quasivariety|quasivarieties]] depending on the axioms used. Some [[axiom]]atic [[formal system]]s that are neither varieties nor quasivarieties, called ''nonvarieties'', are sometimes included among the algebraic structures by tradition.

Concrete examples of each structure will be found in the articles listed.

Algebraic structures are so numerous today that this article will inevitably be incomplete. In addition to this, there are sometimes multiple names for the same structure, and sometimes one name will be defined by disagreeing axioms by different authors. Most structures appearing on this page will be common ones which most authors agree on. Other web lists of algebraic structures, organized more or less alphabetically, include [http://math.chapman.edu/~jipsen/structures/doku.php Jipsen] and [http://planetmath.org/browse/objects/ PlanetMath.] These lists mention many structures not included below, and may present more information about some structures than is presented here.

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

== Study of algebraic structures ==

Algebraic structures appear in most branches of mathematics, and one can encounter them in many different ways.
*Beginning study: In American universities, [[group (mathematics)|group]]s, [[vector space]]s and [[field (mathematics)|field]]s are generally the first structures encountered in subjects such as [[linear algebra]]. They are usually introduced as sets with certain axioms.
*Advanced study:
**[[Abstract algebra]] studies properties of specific algebraic structures.
**[[Universal algebra]] studies algebraic structures abstractly, rather than specific types of structures. 
***[[Variety (universal algebra)|Varieties]]
**[[Category theory]] studies interrelationships between different structures, algebraic and non-algebraic. To study a non-algebraic object, it is often useful to use category theory to relate the object to an algebraic structure. 
***Example: The [[fundamental group]] of a [[topological space]] gives information about the topological space.

== Types of algebraic structures ==

In full generality, an algebraic structure may use any number of sets and any number of axioms in its definition. The most commonly studied structures, however, usually involve only one or two sets and one or two [[binary operation]]s. The structures below are organized by how many sets are involved, and how many binary operations are used. Increased indentation is meant to indicate a more exotic structure, and the least indented levels are the most basic.

===One binary operation on one set===
{{Group-like structures}}
The following structures consist of a set with a binary operation. The most common structure is that of a ''group''. Other structures involve weakening or strengthening the axioms for groups, and may additionally use unary operations.

*[[Group (mathematics)|Group]]s are key structures. [[Abelian group]]s are an important special type of group.
**[[semigroup]]s and [[monoid]]s: These are like groups, except the operation need not have inverse elements.
**[[quasigroup]]s and [[quasigroup|loops]]: These are like groups, except the operation need not be associative.
**[[Magma (algebra)|Magmas]]: These are like groups, except the operation need not be associative or have inverse elements.
*[[Semilattice]]: This is basically "half" of a lattice structure (see below).

===Two binary operations on one set===
The main types of structures with one set having two binary operations are ''rings'' and ''lattices''. The axioms defining many of the other structures are modifications of the axioms for rings and lattices. One major difference between rings and lattices is that their two operations are related to each other in different ways. In ring-like structures, the two operations are linked by the [[distributive law]]; in lattice-like structures, the operations are linked by the [[absorption law]].

*[[ring (mathematics)|Ring]]s: The two operations are usually called addition and multiplication. [[Commutative ring]]s are an especially important type of ring where the multiplication operation is commutative. [[Integral domain]]s and [[field (mathematics)|fields]] are especially important types of commutative rings.
**[[Nonassociative ring]]s: These are like rings, but the multiplication operation need not be associative.
***[[Lie ring]]s and [[Jordan ring]]s are special examples of nonassociative rings.
**[[semiring]]s: These are like rings, but the addition operation need not have inverses.
**[[nearring]]s: These are like rings, but the addition operation need not be commutative.
**[[*-ring]]s: These are rings with an additional unary operation known as an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]].
*[[lattice (order theory)|Lattice]]s: The two operations are usually called [[meet and join]].
**[[Latticoid]]: meet and join [[Commutativity|commute]] but need not [[Integral domain|associate]].
**[[Skew lattice]]: meet and join associate but need not commute.

===Two binary operations and two sets===
The following structures have the common feature of having two sets, ''A'' and ''B'', so that there is a binary operation from ''A''×''A'' into ''A'' and another operation from ''A''×''B'' into ''A''.

*[[Vector space]]s: The set ''A'' is an abelian group, and the set ''B'' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]].
**[[Graded vector space]]s: Vector spaces which are equipped with a [[direct sum]] decomposition into subspaces.
*[[module (mathematics)|Module]]s: The set ''A'' is an abelian group, but the ''B'' is only a general ring and not necessarily a field.
**Special types of modules, including [[free module]]s, [[projective module]]s, [[injective module]]s and [[flat module]]s are studied in abstract algebra.
*[[Group with operators]]: In this case, the set ''A'' is a group, and the set ''B'' is just a set.

===Three binary operations and two sets===
Many structures here are actually hybrid structures of the previously mentioned ones.

*[[Algebra over a field]]: This is a ring which is also a vector space over a field. There are axioms governing the interaction of the two structures. Multiplication is usually assumed to be associative.
**[[Algebra over a ring]]: These are defined the same way as algebras over fields, except that the field may now be any commutative ring.
**[[Graded algebra]]: These algebras are equipped with a decomposition into ''grades''.
*[[Non-associative algebra]]s: These are algebras for which the associativity of ring multiplication is relaxed. 
**[[Lie algebra]]s and [[Jordan algebra]]s are special examples of non-associative algebras.
*[[Coalgebra]]: This structure has axioms which make its multiplication [[dual (category theory)|dual]] to those of an associative algebra.
**[[Bialgebra]]: These structures are simultaneously algebras and coalgebras whose operations are compatible. There are actually four operations for this structure.

==Algebraic structures with additional non-algebraic structure==
There are many examples of mathematical structures where algebraic structure exists alongside non-algebraic structure.

*[[Topological vector space]]s are vector spaces with a compatible [[topology]].
*[[Lie group]]s: These are topological manifolds that also carry a compatible group structure.
*[[Ordered group]]s, [[ordered ring]]s and [[ordered field]]s have algebraic structure compatible with an [[order theory|order]] on the set.
*[[Von Neumann algebra]]s: these are *-algebras on a [[Hilbert space]] which are equipped with the [[weak operator topology]].

==Algebraic structures in different disciplines==
Some algebraic structures find uses in disciplines outside of abstract algebra. The following is meant to demonstrate some specific applications in other fields.

In [[Physics]]:
*[[Lie group]]s are used extensively in physics. A few well-known ones include the [[orthogonal group]]s and the [[unitary group]]s.
*[[Lie algebra]]s
*[[Inner product space]]s
*[[Kac–Moody algebra]]
*The [[quaternions]] and more generally [[geometric algebra]]s

In [[Mathematical logic]]:
*[[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s are both rings and lattices, under their two operations.
**[[Heyting algebra]]s are a special example of boolean algebras.
*[[Peano arithmetic]]
*[[Boundary algebra]]
*[[MV-algebra]]

In [[Computer science]]:
*[[Max-plus algebra]]
*[[Syntactic monoid]]
*[[Transition monoid]]

''The Masters and the Path''  Adyar, Madras, India: 1925, Theosophical Publishing House. "The Venetian Chohan" is profiled on page 238.&lt;/ref&gt; and is regarded as one of the [[ascended master]]s in the [[Ascended Master Teachings]] (also collectively called the ''Great White Brotherhood'').  He is regarded as the Master of the Third Ray&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A, '' A Treatise on Cosmic Fire'' (Section Three - Division A - Certain Basic Statements), 1932, Lucis Trust. 1925, p 1237&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Seven Rays]]).  According to the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]], his final life was his incarnation as the artist [[Paolo Veronese]] (1528-1588), after which he is said to have become an ''Ascended Master''.

==Paul the Venetian's etheric retreat==
{{Theosophy}}
According to [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]], Paul the Venetian's "''Ascended Master Retreat''" is believed to be in an enormous mansion called the "Chateau de Liberte" on the [[etheric plane]] above an area of southern [[France]] called [[Provence]].&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare,  Staff of Summit University (2002).''Walking with the Master: Answering the Call of Jesus''. Summit University Press. p. 398. {{ISBN|0972040218}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethericretreats.com/chateauliberte.htm Picture of Paul the Venetian's "Etheric Retreat":]&lt;/ref&gt;  This mansion is supposed to be larger than the [[Versailles Palace]] and have thousands of rooms decorated with copies of paintings (rendered in etheric matter) from all civilizations and eras of human history.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare  ''Lords of the Seven Rays'' Livingston, Montana, U.S.A.:1986 - Summit University Press - "Morya - Master of the First Ray" pages 131-132&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Church Universal and Triumphant, the largest organization adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings, practice meditation exercises which, they are taught, will allow them to visit this retreat on the etheric plane in their [[dream]]s.

==Previous incarnations==
The Theosophical author [[C.W. Leadbeater]] mentioned a Venetian Chohan, but did not name him Paul or identify him with Veronese.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W.  ''The Masters and the Path''  Adyar, Madras, India: 1925, Theosophical Publishing House, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the lesser known Ancient Wisdom groups maintain that Paul the Venetian was incarnated as [[Plotinus]].&lt;ref&gt;Melton, J. Gordon ''Encyclopedia of American Religions'' 5th Edition New York:1996 Gale Research Page 154&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ascended Master Teachings]], Paul the Venetian is believed to have been incarnated as a "Minister of Culture" in the government of [[Atlantis]], as one of the [[architect]]s of the [[pyramids]] in [[Ancient Egypt]], and as an [[artist]] (mural painter) in the [[Inca Empire]]. During the Building of the Pyramidos(Adytum), he like the 71 other Builders took no Call or Name.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare  ''Lords of the Seven Rays'' Livingston, Montana, U.S.A.:1986 -Summit University Press - "Paul the Venetian - Master of the Third Ray" pages 119 - 148&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ascension==
According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Paul the Venetian ascended on April 19, 1588. [http://www.preterhuman.net/texts/other/crystalinks/paul.html]

==Twin flame==

According to [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] (the founder and former head of the [[Ascended Master Teachings]] organization the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]]), Paul the Venetian’s ''[[twin flame]]'' ([[Celestial marriage|celestial wife]])  was incarnated as [[Ruth Hawkins]] and is now known as the '''Lady Master Adoremus'''.  Ruth Hawkins was born in [[Topeka, Kansas]] in 1907 and died (“ascended”) in 1995 in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. She was an [[artist]] who painted many portraits of the [[ascended masters]] and was very devoted to Paul the Venetian, addressing many "violet flame decrees" toward him. She was a member of the [["I AM" Activity]] and later of [[The Bridge to Freedom]].  According to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, "Lady Master Adoremus" is now known as the ''Goddess of Beauty''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=V2W1vspm8QQC&amp;pg=PA310&amp;lpg=PA310&amp;dq=%22Lord+Maitreya%22+%22twin+flame%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8CQoqkkpp-&amp;sig=XMCUUEdIZaQ2kCwnaMrBi3UtSUs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mQF6SsOmLYbgsQPS2pDCDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Lord%20Maitreya%22%20%22twin%20flame%22&amp;f=false Quotation from “The Masters and Their Retreats” by Elizabeth Clare Prophet:]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to the [[Ascended Master Teachings]] organization the [[Inner Light-Workers]], Paul the Venetian’s ''[[twin flame]]''  (celestial wife) is '''Lady Master Chi Seong Li''', who was incarnated as a widely educated [[Chinese people|Chinese]] lady of noble birth who, following changes in her family's circumstances, taught basic lessons including mathematics to the young children of a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] noble's household.  ''Lady Master Chi Seong Li'' is said to govern the realm of [[logic]], [[mathematics]] and [[Visual appearance|form]].

==Skeptical view==

The scholar [[K. Paul Johnson]] maintains that the "Masters" that [[Madame Blavatsky]] wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her [[mentor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul K. Initiates of Theosophical Masters Albany, New York:1995 State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Also see the article “Talking to the Dead and Other Amusements” by Paul Zweig ''New York Times'' October 5, 1980, which maintains that Madame Blavatsky's revelations were fraudulent.

A '''polar concept argument''' is a type of [[argument]] that posits the understanding of one concept, from the mere understanding of its [[wikt:polar opposite|polar opposite]]. A well-known instance of a polar concept argument is [[Gilbert Ryle]]'s argument against scepticism (1960). According to Anthony Grayling's characterisation, Ryle's argument can be stated as follows:

:''There cannot be counterfeit coins, (...) unless there are genuine ones, nor crooked paths unless there are straight paths, nor tall men unless there are short men''.

According to Ryle's polar concept argument, counterfeit and genuine coins come in pairs, and one cannot conceive of counterfeit coins without also capturing the essence of the genuine coins at the same time. When one grasps the essence of one polar concept, one also grasps immediately the essence of its polar opposite. Ryle's original argument (1960) runs as follows:

:''A country which had no coinage would offer no scope to counterfeiters. There would be nothing for them to manufacture or pass counterfeits of. They could, if they wished, manufacture and give away decorated disks of brass or lead, which the public might be pleased to get. But these would not be false coins. There can be false coins only where there are coins made of the proper materials by the proper authorities. In a country where there is a coinage, false coins can be manufactured and passed; and the counterfeiting might be so efficient that an ordinary citizen, unable to tell which were false and which were genuine coins, might become suspicious of the genuineness of any particular coin that he received.''

A polar concept argument bears on some more or less strong version of [[dialectical monism]], a philosophical doctrine that views reality as a unified whole, due to the complementarity of [[polar concepts]].

The  '''Tree of Porphyry'''  is a classic device for illustrating what is also called a "scale of being". It was suggested—if not first, then most famously in the European philosophical tradition—by the 3rd century [[Common Era|CE]] Greek [[Neoplatonism|neoplatonist]] philosopher and logician [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]].&lt;ref&gt;James Franklin, "Aristotle on Species Variation", ''Philosophy'', 61:236 (April 1986), pp. 245-252.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as ''scala praedicamentalis''.

[[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] suggests the Porphyrian tree in [[Isagoge|his introduction (in Greek, "''Isagoge''")]] to [[Aristotle]]'s [[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]. Porphyry presented Aristotle's classification of categories in a way that was later adopted into tree-like diagrams of dichotomous divisions, which indicate that a species is defined by [[genus-differentia|a genus and a differentia]] and that this logical process continues until the lowest species is reached, which can no longer be so defined.  No illustrations or diagrams occur in editions of Porphyry's original work.  But, diagrams were eventually made, and became associated with the scheme that Porphyry describes, following Aristotle.

[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/porphyry_isagogue_01_intro.htm Porphyry's ''Isagoge''] was originally written in Greek, but was translated into Latin in the early 6th century CE by [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]].  Boethius's translation became the standard philosophical logic textbook in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/medieval-categories/#WilOckBCa128D134 Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] - Medieval Theories of the Categories&lt;/ref&gt;   Until the late 19th century, theories of categories based on Porphyry's work were still being taught to students of [[logic]].

The following very helpful passage by philosopher [[James Franklin (philosopher)|James Franklin]] gives some hint as to the history of the Porphyrian tree:

:In medieval education, the standard introduction to Aristotle's works was via Porphyry's ''Isagoge'', and division entered the educated consciousness in the form of 'Porphyry's Tree'. It is not clear that Porphyry himself, in the relevant passage,&lt;ref&gt;Franklin's note:  "Porphyry, ''Isagoge'', trans. E. W. Warren (Toronto:  Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies, 1975), 34."&lt;/ref&gt; went any further than Aristotle in recommending division. But his brief comment was developed into the Tree by medieval logicians. It appears in [[William of Sherwood|William of Sherwood's]] ''Introduction to Logic'' and is given the name '''arbor Porphyrii''' in the most popular medieval logic, [[Peter of Spain (author)|Peter of Spain]]'s ''Summulae Logicales''.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin's note:  "[[Norman Kretzmann|N. Kretzmann]], ''William of Sherwood's Introduction to Logic'' (Minneapolis:  University of Minnesota Press, 1966), 54; Peter of Spain, ''Summulae Logicales'', [[Józef Maria Bocheński|I. M. Boche&amp;#324;ski]] (ed.) (Turin:  Marietti, 1947), 17-18."&lt;/ref&gt;  Linnaeus's system of static and discrete species was simply the result of filling in the abstract Tree with the names of actual species.&lt;ref&gt;James Franklin, "Aristotle on Species Variation", ''Philosophy'', 61:236 (April 1986), pp. 245-252.  The passage quoted here is from pp. 251-252.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the notion of the Porphyrian tree as an actual diagram comes later than Porphyry himself.  Still, scholars do speak of Porphyry's tree as in the ''Isagoge'' and they mean by this only that the idea of dividing genera into species via differentiae is found in the ''Isagoge''.  But, of course, Porphyry was only following what was already in Aristotle, and Aristotle was following what was already in his teacher, [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;A number of Plato's dialogs contain the idea of division in them:  see [[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]], [[Philebus]], [[Statesman (dialogue)|Statesman]], [[Republic (dialogue)|Republic]] (book VII), and [[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]] for starters.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
The following Porphyrian tree consists of three columns of words; the middlemost (in boldface) contains the series of [[Genus|genera]] and [[species]], and we can take as analogous to the trunk of a tree. The extremes (the terms that jut out to the left and right), containing the [[differentia]]e, we can take as analogous to the branches of a tree:

[[File:Porphyrian Tree.png|frameless|center|400px|This image is an illustration of the notion of a Porphyrian Tree as it comes down to us today through the European philosophical and logical tradition.]]

The diagram shows the highest genus to be substance.  (Whether substance is a highest genus, really, is not in question here:  right now we are only going to discuss what the diagram shows, not whether what it shows is true or false.)  The technical term for a highest substance is "[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/summum_genus ''summum genus'']".  So, substance is the ''summum genus'' as far as this diagram goes.  The diagram shows that the genus substance to have two differentia, namely, "thinking" and "extended".  This indicates that there are two species of the genus substance, thinking substance and extended substance.  The diagram does not give a term for the species of thinking substance (this would be "mind"), but it does give the term for the species of extended substance, namely, body.  That is, body is a species of the genus substance; body is that species of the genus substance that is extended.

Now that we have seen body as a species of substance, we treat body as a genus itself.  As a genus, it has two differentia of its own, inanimate and animate.  So, there are two species of body, inanimate body and animate body.  The diagram does not tell us what the term for inanimate body is, but it indicates a term for animate body, namely, animal.  Animal is an animate species of the genus body.

And, again, now that we have looked at animal as a species of the genus body, we look at animal now as a genus and consider its differentia, which are shown on the diagram to be irrational and rational.  Thus, according to the diagram there are two species of the genus animal, irrational animal and rational animal.  We are not told by the diagram what a term for irrational animal is, but the diagram indicates that a rational animal is a human.  Thus, human is a rational species of the genus animal.

Beneath human, however, there are no further species.  "This" and "that" if they are considered differentiae, are of a special kind that map the species human not onto a new species but onto particular humans.,&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of "this" and "that" as universals/differentia, see [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]], ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', "A. Consciousness", "I. Sense-Certainty:  or the 'this' and 'meaning' [Meinen]", translated by A. V. Miller, Oxford University Press, pp. 58-66.&lt;/ref&gt;   The particular human Plato is named in the diagram.  Plato is not a species (that is why his name is not in bold, unlike the species above).  So, human is the lowest species in this diagram.  The technical name for the lowest species in such a scheme is the "[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/infima_species ''infima species'']".  So, for this diagram, human is the ''infima species''.

{{refimprove|date=October 2009}}
'''Preventive detention''' is an [[imprisonment]] that is putatively justified for non-[[punishment|punitive]] purposes.

A related, but different form of detention, is detention of suspects or [[Remand (detention)|remand]]. In contrast to preventive detention, detention of suspects must quickly be followed by a criminal charge (or happen after the charge).

In most jurisdictions, people suffering from serious mental illness may be subject to [[involuntary commitment]] under mental health legislation. This is undertaken on health grounds or in order to protect the person or others. It does not strictly speaking constitute a form of preventive detention, because the person is detained for treatment and released once this has proven effective.

==Specific jurisdictions==

===Australia===
Australia laws authorize preventive detention in a variety of circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203807774|title=Dangerous People|language=en-US|doi=10.4324/9780203807774}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[mandatory detention in Australia]] (a form of [[immigration detention]]) is applied to asylum seekers who arrive in Australian territorial waters or territory, until their status as an asylum seeker is established.

In Australia's most populous State, New South Wales, preventive detention regimes have established powers to detain or to continuously monitor and limit particular activities of those who were once convicted of various serious sexual and violent offences. Recently, this has been extended, with the State government now able to control the free movement, speech, association and work of individuals and businesses via Serious Crime Prevention Orders (‘SCPOs’).&lt;ref&gt;''Crimes (Serious Crime Prevention Orders) Act 2016'' (NSW)&lt;/ref&gt; Based on provisions in the United Kingdom, a range of state officials may apply to the NSW District or Supreme Courts to create an SCPO consisting of any conditions they consider appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;''Crimes (Serious Crime Prevention Orders) Act 2016'' (NSW) ss 5-7&lt;/ref&gt; These conditions may include positive obligations - such as an obligation to report to a police station - or negative ‘prohibitions’ or ‘restrictions’, for instance, a prohibition on travelling beyond a certain location. Failure to comply with the SCPO, carries with it a maximum penalty of five years’ imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;''Crimes (Serious Crime Prevention Orders) Act 2016'' (NSW) s 8&lt;/ref&gt;

SCPOs have been described as a "watershed extension of state power in New South Wales"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Methven|first=Elyse|last2=Carter|first2=David J.|date=2016|title=Serious Crime Prevention Orders|url=https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/handle/10453/74815|journal=Current Issues in Criminal Justice|publisher=|volume=28|issue=2|pages=223–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; by legal academics, and were strongly opposed by the legal community when they were introduced and passed into with less than two weeks' consideration by the Parliament of NSW.

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], anyone declared a [[dangerous offender]] by the courts is subject to an indefinite period of detention

===Costa Rica===
In [[Costa Rica]], the 1998 Criminal Proceedings Code allows for a normal pre-trial "''prisión preventiva''" or [[Remand (detention)|remand]]&lt;ref name=Q2013/&gt; of 12 months if the person is considered a "flight risk", but if the case is declared "complex", it can be increased to up to three years and a half of imprisonment without conviction, or even more in some cases. As of 23 May 2013, over 3,000 people were in pre-trial detention.&lt;ref name=Q2013&gt;{{cite web |url= http://qcostarica.com/in-costa-rica-17-persons-ordered-daily-to-preventive-detention/ |title=In Costa Rica 17 persons ordered daily to preventive detention |date=30 June 2013 |work=QCostarica.com |publisher=Q Media |accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
The police can detain people for 6 hours without involving the courts or pay compensation for wrongful arrest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politi.dk/da/loveogrettigheder/politiloven/ The police law {{dk icon}}], Web page of the Danish police&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to the ongoing gang war in Copenhagen between the biker gangs and second generation youth gangs it has been suggested to extend the 6 hour limit to several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dr.dk/Regioner/Kbh/Nyheder/Koebenhavn/2009/02/22/114719.htm S vil sætte bandekrigen bag tremmer], by Bente Lund, Denmarks Radio, February 22, 2009 {{dk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[Copenhagen Climate Council]] a new set of [[State of emergency|emergency laws]] was introduced allowing the police to detain people for up to 12 hours without charging them for a crime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Politik/2009/11/26/104519.htm Hårdt politisk opgør før Folketinget sagde ja til lømmelpakken], by Jens Ringberg, Denmarks Radio, November 26, 2009 {{dk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics fear that they will remain as permanent laws when the summit is over.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politiken.dk/indland/article833988.ece Lømmelpakken bekymrer dommerne], Politiken, November 13, 2009 {{dk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--different definition so this is a level 2 heading where above the countries are level 3--&gt;

===Germany===
In [[Germany]], "preventive detention" (German: ''Sicherungsverwahrung'', [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#StGBengl_000P66 §66 [[Strafgesetzbuch]]]) has a similar meaning to that in New Zealand. Sicherungsverwahrung can only be imposed as part of a criminal sentence, and it is handed down to individuals who have committed a grave offence and are considered a danger to public safety. It is an indeterminate sentence that follows a regular jail sentence. To assure the suitability of the preventive detention, it has to be reviewed every two years to determine the ongoing threat posed by the individual. Preventive detention is typically served in regular prisons, though separated from regular prisoners and with certain privileges.

The Sicherungsverwahrung is usually imposed in the original verdict, but can be imposed later under certain circumstances. This practice of subsequent incapacitation orders was ruled a violation of Art 7 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] by the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=860012&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649l|title=HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, a huge discussion in Germany over the handling of this verdict occurred. In reaction to this the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] issued a verdict on Sicherungsverwahrung in May 2011, deeming it unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15046630,00.html|title=German court rules preventive detention unconstitutional - Germany - DW.COM - 04.05.2011|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, a new law regulating Sicherungsverwahrung was passed in November 2012
.&lt;ref&gt;Gesetz zur bundesrechtlichen Umsetzung des Abstandsgebotes im Recht der Sicherungsverwahrung (BR-Drs. 689/12) {{cite web |url=http://www.bundesrat.de/cln_320/nn_8336/SharedDocs/Drucksachen/2012/0601-700/689-12,templateId=raw,property=publicationFile.pdf/689-12.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019193120/http://www.bundesrat.de/cln_320/nn_8336/SharedDocs/Drucksachen/2012/0601-700/689-12,templateId=raw,property=publicationFile.pdf/689-12.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-19 |df= }} (PDF; 266&amp;nbsp;kB)&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
In [[India]], preventive detention can be extended for up to six months. After three months, such a case is brought before an advisory board for review.

Preventive detention in India dates from British rule in the early 1800s, and continued with such laws as the Defence of India Act 1939 and the Preventive Detention Act 1950.&lt;ref&gt;A. Faizur Rahman, "[http://www.thehindu.com/op/2004/09/07/stories/2004090700101500.htm Preventive detention an anachronism]", ''The Hindu'', 7 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversial ''[[Maintenance of Internal Security Act]]'' was enacted by Indian parliament during [[Indira Gandhi]] prime ministership in 1971, however it was amended several times during [[Indian Emergency|national emergency]] (1975-1977), leading to human right violations. It was subsequently repealed after Indira Gandhi lost the election in 1977, and the new government took over.&lt;ref name="Saxena2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Saxena|first=Priti|title=Preventive Detention and Human Rights|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n2k3QCHpcroC&amp;pg=PA99|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Deep &amp; Deep Publications|isbn=978-81-7629-992-3|pages=99–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
{{See also|Daiyo_kangoku|Public order and internal security in Japan}}
In [[Japan]], pre-trial detention of a suspect can be for up to 23 days without charge. The length of detention, up to the maximum period, is at the discretion of the public prosecutor and subject to the approval of local courts. It can also be further extended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=214811 Code of Criminal Procedure (Act No. 131 of July 10, 1948, as amended in 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malaysia===
In Malaysia the [[Internal Security Act 1960]] (ISA) was a preventive detention law that was enacted after Malaysia gained independence from Britain in 1957. The ISA allowed for detention without trial or criminal charges under limited, legally defined circumstances. The ISA was invoked against terrorism activity and against anyone deemed a threat to national security. On 15 September 2011, [[Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak|Najib Razak]], the Prime Minister of Malaysia, said that this legislation would be repealed and replaced by two new laws.&lt;ref name="bernamanajib"&gt;[http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v5/newsindex.php?id=613836 Internal Security Act to be abolished, says Najib], 15 September 2011, Bernama.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 April 2012, the [[Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012]] (SOSMA) was approved by the [[Parliament of Malaysia|Malaysian Parliament]] as a replacement for the ISA. It was given the Royal Assent on 18 June 2012 and gazetted on 22 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalgazette.agc.gov.my/outputaktap/20120622_747_BI_Act%20747%20BI.pdf Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
{{See also|Life imprisonment in New Zealand#Preventive detention|Prisoners' rights in New Zealand#Preventive detention}}
In [[New Zealand]], "preventive detention" is an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment, second only to life imprisonment in terms of seriousness. It may be given to offenders aged 18 or over who are convicted of a qualifying sexual or violent offence, and the court is satisfied that the person is likely to commit another qualifying sexual or violent offence if they were given a determinate sentence of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2002/0009/latest/DLM136454.html|title=Sentencing Act 2002 No 9 (as at 22 December 2016), Public Act 87 Sentence of preventive detention – New Zealand Legislation|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Preventive detention has a minimum non-parole period of five years in prison, but the sentencing judge can extend this if they believe that the prisoner's history warrants it. A total of 314 people were serving terms of preventive detention in 2013, of whom 34 were on parole.&lt;ref name=Stuff_20130717&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/8926501/A-third-of-Kiwi-life-termers-are-out-on-parole |title=A third of Kiwi life termers are out on parole |last=Sharpe |first=Marty |date=17 July 2013 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred Thomas Vincent has been in prison on preventive detention since 1968 and was still there as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Zealand's longest serving prisoner gets half a century behind bars |first=Deidre |last=Mussen |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/72732437/new-zealands-longest-serving-prisoner-gets-half-a-century-behind-bars |newspaper=Stuff |date=11 October 2015 |accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Africa ===
Under [[Apartheid]], the government of South Africa used preventive detention laws to target its political opponents. These included, notably, the [[Terrorism Act, 1967|Terrorism Act of 1967]], which gave police commanders the power to detain terrorists—or people with information about terrorists—without warrant.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Cohen, "[http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/1967-terrorism-act-no-83-1967 1967 Terrorism Act, No. 83 of 1967]", ''South African History Online''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
[[England and Wales]] used to have provisions, introduced by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Government in 2003, to deal with [[dangerous offender]]s similar to what is used in Canada. However, the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 abolished what was called [[Imprisonment for Public Protection]] (IPP) without replacement, although offences committed prior to the coming into force of the 2012 Act may still trigger IPP.

===United States===
In the [[United States]], the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] guarantees the right to "a speedy and public trial". Thus, arrested persons may not be held for extended periods of time without trial. However, since the passage of the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012]] (NDAA), controversy has broken out as to whether or not the U.S. government now has the power to indefinitely detain citizens. Section 1021 and 1022 of the legislation enacted policies described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as allowing indefinite detention "without trial [of] American terrorism suspects arrested on U.S. soil who could then be shipped to Guantánamo Bay".&lt;ref&gt;McGreal, C., "Military given go-ahead to detain US terrorist suspects without trial", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 14 December 2011: [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/15/americans-face-guantanamo-detention-obama].&lt;/ref&gt;

Convicted persons can be held indefinitely as a "[[dangerous offender]]".

'''Pure thought''' is an English translation of an expression originally attributed to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Hegel]]. Their usage of the German counterpart revolved around the question of whether pure thought could exist without an object or some material. &lt;ref&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=-IMXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA203&amp;dq=%22pure+thought%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0#PPA202,M1 Mind: A Quarterly Review of Psychology and Philosophy], : Vol. 105, issue 417 (Jan. 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=CdYLAAAAIAAJ Treatise on Logic] (1895) &lt;/ref&gt; Today, more popular uses exist.  That "Pure Thought" could existent and is part of the evidentiary change. The usage here is that pure thought is simply a process, another term for [[thought experiment]].   &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg14619764.300-the-thought-that-counts.html The Thought that Counts], [[Paul Davies]], [[New Scientist]], 6 May 1995 &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14247">'''Self-complexity''' is a person’s perceived knowledge of herself or himself, based upon the number of distinct cognitive structures, or self-aspects, they believe themselves to possess. These self-aspects can include context-dependent social roles, relationships, activities, superordinate traits, and goals of the individual,&lt;ref name="Linville85"&gt;Linville, P.W. (1985). Self-complexity and affective extremity: Don’t put all your eggs in one cognitive basket. Social Cognition, 3, 94-120.&lt;/ref&gt; which combine to form the larger, associative network of their [[self-concept]].&lt;ref name="Linville87"&gt;Linville, P.W. (1987). Self-complexity as a cognitive buffer against stress-related illness and depression. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 52(4), 663-676.&lt;/ref&gt; According to self-complexity theory, an individual who has a number of self-aspects that are unique in their attributes will have greater self-complexity than one who has only a few self-aspects, or whose self-aspects are closely associated to one another.&lt;ref name="Linville87" /&gt; In other words, self-complexity may invoke the question, “How full is the self-concept”?&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Brown, J.D. (1998). The self. New York, NY: Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The self-complexity model==
The term self-complexity was first coined by psychologist Patricia Linville (1985, 1987), who also developed a model for the concept. Linville’s model for self-complexity suggests that self-aspects are “activated” in the context of a relevant experience,&lt;ref name="Linville85" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linville87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt; and it is these experiences that impact how particular self-aspects are viewed. If an individual experiences a favourable event towards which they feel positively, self-aspects that have been activated by the experience will be associated with positive feelings. In contrast, self-aspects will be associated with negative thoughts and feelings when they are activated by unfavourable experiences. In addition, the more similar self-aspects are to one another, the more likely it will be for the thoughts and feelings associated with one self-aspect to “spillover”, influencing the thoughts and feelings linked to other, overlapping self-aspects.&lt;ref name="Linville87" /&gt; Consequently, the self-complexity model suggests that highly self-complex individuals who possess the greatest number of distinct self-aspects will be less vulnerable to swings in affect and self-appraisal in response to life events, relative to individuals who possess limited and/or indistinct self-aspects (i.e., low self-complexity).&lt;ref name="Linville85" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linville87" /&gt; This is due to the fact that highly self-complex individuals are suspected of being better able to [[Compartmentalization (psychology)|compartmentalize]] their life events,&lt;ref name="Ryan"&gt;Ryan, R.M., LaGuardia, J.G., &amp; Rawsthorne, L.J. (2005). Self-complexity and the authenticity of self-aspects: Effects on well being and resilience to stressful events. North American Journal of Psychology,7(3), 431-448.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Showers"&gt;Showers, C. (1992). Compartmentalization of positive and negative self-knowledge: Keeping bad apples out of the bunch. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 62(6), 1036-1049.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as having a smaller proportion of their self-aspects affected by any salient emotional event, whether positive or negative.&lt;ref name="Linville87" /&gt; In essence, after receiving any form of self-relevant feedback individuals high in self-complexity will have less of their self-concept represented, and as a result will exhibit less extreme affective responses.&lt;ref name="Linville85" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linville87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryan" /&gt;

==Approaches==

===Developmental perspective===
A variety of different views are held concerning the nature of self-complexity. From a developmental perspective, self-complexity is viewed as one of the primary features of development, and it is thought to increase with age.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Evans, D.W. (1994). Self-complexity and its relation to development, symptomatology and self-perception during adolescence. Child Psychiatry and Human Development, 24(3), 173-182.&lt;/ref&gt; Young children are believed to possess relatively few and undifferentiated self-aspects (i.e., low self-complexity), resulting in a simplified self-concept. As children grow in terms of their physical, social, and cognitive selves, they should attain the cognitive capacity necessary to identify a greater number of distinct self-aspects (i.e., increasing self-complexity) and thus reflect a more developed, multi-faceted self-concept.&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt; The developmentalist perspective would therefore expect older children to have not only a greater number of self-aspects in comparison to younger children, but also to have less interrelation between their self-aspects. The perspective also stresses the need to examine other indices of development, including identity status, cognitive developmental level, and ego development,&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt; as factors that have the potential to provide an enhanced understanding of self-complexity development.

===Clinical and personality perspectives===
Contrary to the developmental viewpoint, clinical and personality perspectives focus predominantly upon the potential protective factors of self-complexity that carry into adulthood.&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt; Specifically, the perspective suggests that highly self-complex individuals are at less risk for [[major depressive disorder|depression]]&lt;ref name="Linville87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt; and psychopathologies,&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt;  such as [[borderline personality disorder]],&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;Parker, A.G., Boldero, J.M., &amp; Bell, R.C. (2006). Borderline personality disorder features: The role of self-discrepancies and self-complexity. Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, and Practice, 79(3), 309-321.&lt;/ref&gt; because they can compensate for their negatively affected self-aspects by focusing on their unaffected self-aspects, thus preserving their global self-worth.&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt; In comparisons of clinical and normal adolescent populations, the self-concept domains of psychiatric inpatients are often found to be significantly more interrelated, suggesting low self-complexity.&lt;ref name="EvansII"&gt;Evans, D.W., Noam, G.G., Wertleib, D., Paget, K.F., &amp; Wolf, M. (1994). Self-perception and adolescent psychopathology: A clinical-developmental perspective. [[American Journal of Orthopsychiatry]], 64(2), 293-300.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, clinical and personality perspectives not only consider low self-complexity as a factor in psychopathology, they also infer that individuals with psychopathologies may be delayed in the normal development of self-complexity.&lt;ref name="EvansII" /&gt;

==Implications for high vs. low self-complexity==
In accordance with clinical and personality perspectives, variations in self-complexity are suggested to be factors that either contribute to, or protect against damages to individuals’ physical and mental well-being.&lt;ref name="Linville85" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linville87" /&gt; In particular, individual differences in self-complexity are predictive of emotional stability and reactivity to [[stress (biology)|stress]],&lt;ref name="Linville87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rafaeli-Mor"&gt;Rafaeli-Mor, E., Gotlib, I.H., &amp; Revelle, W. (1998). The meaning and measurement of self-complexity. Personality and Individual Differences, 27(2), 341-356.&lt;/ref&gt; which can moderate depression, physical illnesses, and [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref name="McConnell"&gt;McConnell, A.R., Strain, L.M., Brown, C.M.,&amp; Rydell, R.J. (2009). The simple life: On the benefits of low self-complexity. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 35(7), 823-835.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits of high self-complexity===
According to Linville, individuals who possess high self-complexity may use their unaffected self-aspects as cognitive buffers,&lt;ref name="Linville87" /&gt; protecting against negative affects/self-appraisals and the health consequences associated with these stressors. For example, a woman who considers herself a successful lawyer, mother, wife and friend may experience less negative affects and self-appraisals, following a divorce, compared to a woman whose self-aspects were limited to her being a successful lawyer and wife, because the former retains a number of diverse self-aspects on which she can rely.&lt;ref name="Linville87" /&gt; Furthermore, if another woman’s self-aspect as a wife was closely associated with her self-aspect as a lawyer (if, for example, her husband was also a lawyer) her affectivity could be even more severely impacted due to the spillover process,&lt;ref name="Linville85" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linville87" /&gt; leading to heightened feelings of inadequacy and stress. In this vein, high self-complexity could be considered a buffer against threats to a particular domain of self-aspects, while low self-complexity could be viewed as a [[wikt:diathesis|diathesis]] for stress-related disorders and depression; the majority of an individual’s self-aspects would be negatively affected by stressful life events.&lt;ref name="Linville87" /&gt;

===Benefits of low self-complexity===
As an alternative to the conclusions above, other members in the field of psychology consider low self-complexity to benefit individuals’ well-being in select scenarios.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McConnell" /&gt; Despite the fact that  highly self-complex individuals are capable of limiting their affective reactivity to negative events,&lt;ref name="Linville87" /&gt; this same emotional restraint is observed in reaction to positive events.&lt;ref name="McConnell"/&gt; Therefore, in comparison to highly self-complex individuals, individuals who are low in self-complexity, but who generally experience positive life events are likely to experience increased positive affect, enhancing well-being and self-esteem and deterring the effects of depression and physical illness that are typically stress-induced.&lt;ref name="McConnell" /&gt; This effect is especially likely if low self-complexity individuals believe they possess an extensive social support network and desirable personality characteristics.&lt;ref name="McConnell" /&gt;
Moreover, although high self-complexity allows numerous, differentiated self-aspects to diffuse the damage incurred by one or more self-aspects in undesirable experiences, the possession of multiple, unrelated self-aspects can be viewed as a fragmentation of one’s self-concept.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rafaeli-MorII"&gt;Rafaeli-Mor, E., &amp; Steinberg, J. (2002). Self-complexity and well-being: A review and research synthesis. Personality and Social Psychology Review, 6(1), 31-58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Donahue"&gt;Donahue, E.M., Robins, R.W., Roberts, B.W., &amp; John, O.P. (1993). The divided self: Concurrent and longitudinal effects of psychological adjustment and social roles on self-concept differentiation. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 64(5), 834-846.&lt;/ref&gt; From this stance, highly self-complex individuals may suffer the strain of [[role conflict]], identity uncertainty, and/or identity competition&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt; (e.g., determined businesswoman vs. nurturing mother), all of which have been known to enhance depression, [[neuroticism]], and low self-esteem&lt;ref name="Donahue" /&gt; and can ultimately lead to chronic, low-level stress as a result of everyday hassle.&lt;ref name="Ryan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Showers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rafaeli-MorII" /&gt; In light of these arguments, it is suggested that high self-complexity is beneficial only to the extent that one’s various self-aspects remain distinct, yet integrated with one another.&lt;ref name="Woolfolk"&gt;Woolfolk, R.L., Novalany, J.G., Allen, M.A., &amp; Polino, M. (1995). Self-complexity, self-evaluation, and depression: An examination of form and content within the self-schema. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 68, 1108-1120.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future of the self-complexity model==
Linville’s model for self-complexity has been widespread in the research community since the time of its inception in 1985. Given the influence and popularity of her model for explaining personality complexity and its relation to well-being, numerous criticisms and alternative suggestions have been made to improve upon the model’s consistency, reliability, and validity.&lt;ref name="Rafaeli-Mor" /&gt;

===Criticisms===
In terms of criticisms, research has found that the buffering effect of high self-complexity, as proposed by Linville,&lt;ref name="Linville87" /&gt; receives mixed support at best.&lt;ref name="Ryan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rafaeli-MorII" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solomon"&gt;Solomon, A., &amp; Haaga, David A.F. (2003). Reconsideration of self-complexity as a buffer against depression. Cognitive Therapy and Research 27(5), 579-591.&lt;/ref&gt; Other criticisms have focused upon Linville’s choice to operationally define self-complexity as a combination of the number and differentiation of self-aspects; many believe that variations in well-being could be better accounted for if the two factors were considered separately, rather than as one entity in self-complexity theory.&lt;ref name="Rafaeli-Mor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solomon" /&gt;

===Suggested alternatives===									
Recent alternatives suggest that it is not the complexity of an individual, that is, the number and distinctiveness of their self-aspects, which moderates well-being, but rather the authenticity of one’s self-aspects.&lt;ref name="Ryan" /&gt; This emphasizes the potential prominence of [[self-determination theory]] (SDT), which focuses upon the authentication of behaviours, values, and self-presentations as an integral feature to personal well-being.&lt;ref name="Ryan" /&gt; The concept of possible self-complexity has also been addressed to consider how this factor could mediate reactions to feedback regarding future, rather than present goals of an individual.&lt;ref name="Niedenthal"&gt;Niedenthal, P. M., Setterlund, M. B., &amp; Wherry, M. B. (1992). Possible self-complexity and affective reactions to goal-relevant evaluation. Journal of Personality &amp; Social Psychology, 63(1), 5-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''silver cord''' in [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] studies and [[literature]], also known as the sutratma or life thread of the antahkarana, refers to a life-giving linkage from the [[higher self]] ([[atman (disambiguation)|atma]]) down to the physical body. It also refers to an extended synthesis of this thread and a second (the consciousness thread, passing from the [[soul]] to the physical body) that connects the physical body to the [[etheric body]], onwards to the [[astral body]] and finally to the [[mental body]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.alice.bailey.it/testi-inglese/Education-in-the-New-Age.pdf |title= Education in the New Age |first= Alice |last= Bailey |authorlink= Alice Bailey |pages= 19, 21, 76-9 |isbn= 9780853301059 |publisher= [[Lucis Trust]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=October 2014}}

In other research, it is described as a strong, silver-colored, elastic cord which joins a person's physical body to its [[astral body]] (a manifestation of the physical body that is less distinct).&lt;ref name="Smed2013"&gt;{{cite web |last= Smed |first= Jouni A. |year= 2013 |title= Out-of-body experience studies |url= http://www.monroeinstitute.org/resources/out-of-body-experience-studies |website= www.monroeinstitute.org |publisher= [[The Monroe Institute]] |accessdate=  |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130415103607/http://www.monroeinstitute.org/resources/out-of-body-experience-studies |archivedate= 2013-04-15 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=October 2014}}

Alfred Ballabene,&lt;ref name= "Ballabene1997"&gt;{{cite web |last= Ballabene |first= Alfred |year= 1997 |title= The silver cord (observations and traditions) |url= http://www.paranormal.de/ballabene/obe/english/cord.htm |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=October 2014}} an astral projector whose works are mostly published and accessed online, observed that during his [[out-of-body experiences]] "glue-like strings" appear as the [[astral body]] tries to separate itself from the physical body. As the [[astral body]] moves further away from the tangible body, some of the strings break apart and clump into a specific and smaller region - preferably the head, breast, back, stomach, and the abdomen area - thus forming the silver cord.

Some prophets and soothsayers in ancient times also claimed to have seen the silver cord during their [[out-of-body experiences]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Life after death |url= http://hpb.theosophy.org.nz/life-after-death |website= hpb.theosophy.org.nz |publisher= Auckland Theosophical Centre: HPB Lodge |date= 2013-06-08 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=October 2014}}

==Astral projection==

During [[astral projection]] and [[out-of-body experience]]s, some{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} claim they can (at will or otherwise) see a silver cord linking their astral form to their physical body. This cord mainly appears to a beginning projector as an assurance they will not become lost.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} However, even experienced projectors find it useful, claiming it is a fast way to return to the body.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Ballabene,&lt;ref name= "Ballabene1997"/&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=October 2014}} on the other hand, stated that the cord not only serves as a link between the two bodies, but it also limits the [[astral body]] from wandering great distances. His experiment showed that as the [[astral body]] moves farther away from the physical body and reaches a distance of "50 to 70 meters," the silver cord pulls the astral form right back into the physical body.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Others asserted though, that the cases of silver cord observations during [[out-of-body experience]]s and [[astral projection]]s are rare;&lt;ref name= "Smed2013"/&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=October 2014}} rather, no [[astral body]] is observed and the projector sees himself or herself as a "disembodied awareness or a point of view" in most cases.&lt;ref name= "Blackmore2004"&gt;{{cite book |last= Blackmore |first= Susan |authorlink= Susan Blackmore |year= 2004 |chapter= Out-of-body experience |editor-first= Richard L. |editor-last= Gregory |editorlink= Richard Gregory |title= The Oxford Companion to the Mind |edition= 2nd |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |isbn= 9780198662242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passing through a tunnel is compared to the [[birth canal]], and the silver cord resembling the [[umbilical cord]] - these are a few observations during [[out-of-body experience]]s that are sometimes likened to [[childbirth]]. "Birth theories" hypothesized that people who were delivered by [[Caesarean section]] do not have tunnel experiences during astral projections. On the contrary, one study showed that there is no discrepancy between the experiences observed by people who are born through [[Caesarean section]] and those born naturally during their [[out-of-body experience|OBE]] or [[astral projection]].&lt;ref name= "Blackmore2004"/&gt;

The attachment point of the cord to the astral body differs, not only between projectors but also from projection to projection.  These points correspond to major [[chakra]] positions.  According to the observations of Robert Bruce, there is not a single point of connection to the denser body, but rather a locally converging collection of strands leading out of all of the major chakras, and some of the minor ones (Astral Dynamics, p398).

The silver cord is mentioned by [[mysticism|mystics]], especially in contexts of dying and of [[near-death experiences]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} It is said that the cord must remain connected to the [[Astral body|astral]] and the physical bodies during the projection because if it breaks, the projector will die. If a person gets older or if their death is near, the [[astral body]] slowly separates itself from the physical body and the silver cord breaks, making a complete and irreversible separation of the two bodies. In this situation, the idea of death and dying is interpreted as a "permanent [[astral projection]]" that cannot be undone.&lt;ref name= "Smed2013"/&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=October 2014}}

==Origin of the term==

The term is derived from [[Ecclesiastes]] 12:6-7 in the [[Hebrew Bible|Jewish Bible]] or [[Old Testament|Christian Old Testament]].  

As translated from the original Hebrew in ''The Complete Tanakh'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/63255/jewish/The-Bible-with-Rashi.htm|title=The Complete Tanach with Rashi's Commentary - English translation with Rashi's commentary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: "Before the silver cord snaps, and the golden fountain is shattered, and the pitcher breaks at the fountain, and the wheel falls shattered into the pit.  And the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns to God, Who gave it."

As rendered in the [[KJV|Authorised Version]]:

: "Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern. Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it."

Or from the [[NIV|New International Version]]:

: "Remember him—before the silver cord is severed, or the golden bowl is broken; before the pitcher is shattered at the spring, or the wheel broken at the well, and the dust returns to the ground it came from, and the spirit returns to God who gave it."

These verses, Ecclesiastes 12:6-7, are variously translated, and there is a lack of consensus among Bible commentators as to its meaning. [[Matthew Henry]]'s commentary, for example, states that the silver cord refers simply to the "spinal marrow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Commentary Upon the Holy Bible |volume= 3: Job to Salomon's song |first1= Matthew |last1= Henry |first2= Thomas |last2= Scott |page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=c3JAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA496 496] |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=c3JAAAAAcAAJ |publisher= Religious Tract Society |location= London |year= 1835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Single-stream''' (also known as “fully commingled” or "single-sort") [[recycling]] refers to a system in which all [[paper]] fibers, plastics, metals, and other containers are mixed in a collection truck, instead of being sorted by the depositor into separate commodities ([[newspaper]], [[paperboard]], [[corrugated fiberboard]], [[plastic]], [[glass]], etc.) and handled separately throughout the collection process. In single-stream, both the collection and processing systems are designed to handle this fully commingled mixture of recyclables, with materials being separated for reuse at a [[materials recovery facility]] (MRF).&lt;ref&gt;City of Chicago, Illinois. Department of Streets and Sanitation. [http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/streets/supp_info/recycling1/what_is_single_streamrecycling.html "What is Single Stream Recycling."] Accessed 2013-12-09.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery County, Maryland. Division of Solid Waste Services, Rockville, MD (2010). [http://www6.montgomerycountymd.gov/content/dep/solidwaste/reference/10yr_plan/10_yr_plan_complete.pdf "Comprehensive Solid Waste Management 10 Year Plan: 2009-2019."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110403085249/http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/content/dep/solidwaste/reference/10yr_plan/10_yr_plan_complete.pdf |date=2011-04-03 }} p. 3-40.&lt;/ref&gt; The single-stream option replaces the dual-stream option, which is where people separate certain recyclable materials and place them in separate containers for collection.

Single-stream recycling programs were first developed in several [[California]] communities in the 1990s. Subsequently, many large and small municipalities across the United States began single-stream programs. As of 2012, there are 248 MRFs operating in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;de Thomas, Dylan (2013-11-14).

Proponents of single-stream note several advantages:&lt;ref&gt;Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority, Hartford, CT (2013-03-28).
[http://www.crra.org/pages/single-stream_recycling.htm "The Facts About Single-Stream Recycling."]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reduced sorting effort by residents may mean more recyclables are [[Curbside collection|placed at the curb]] and more residents may participate in recycling;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Diehl |first=Phil |date=2013-03-05 |title=Single-stream system increases recycling |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/Mar/05/tp-single-stream-system-brings-increase-in/ |newspaper=[[San Diego Union-Tribune]] |location=San Diego, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reduced collection costs because single-compartment [[truck]]s are cheaper to purchase and operate, collection can be automated, and collection routes can be serviced more efficiently. Single-stream reduced the amount of time it takes for a driver to collect the recyclables, which reduces the driver time on the road. 
* Greater fleet flexibility, which allows single-compartment vehicles to be used to collect recycling, providing greater fleet flexibility and reducing the number of reserve vehicles needed. To avoid confusing customers, a large sign or banner is sometimes used to distinguish when a [[Garbage truck|refuse truck]] is being used to collect recycling (instead of refuse).
* Worker injuries may decrease because the switch to single-stream is often accompanied by a switch from bins to cart-based collection.
* Changing to single-stream may provide an opportunity to update the collection and processing system and to add new materials to the list of recyclables accepted; and
* More paper grades may be collected, including junk mail, [[telephone book]]s and mixed residential paper.

== Disadvantages ==
Potential disadvantages of single-stream recycling may include:
* Initial [[capital cost]] for:
** New carts
** Different collection vehicles
** Upgrading the processing facility
* Processing costs may increase compared to multiple stream systems. Overall, single-stream costs about $3 more per ton than dual-stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2004|title=Paper Recycling: Quality is Key to Long-Term Success|url=|journal=J.Poyry and Skumatz Economic Research Associates.|volume=|pages=32|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Increased [[downcycling]] of paper, i.e., use of high quality fibers for low-end uses like boxboard because of presence of contaminants;
* Possible increase in residual rates after processing (chiefly because of increased breakage of [[glass]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.recyclingtoday.com/Article.aspx?article_id=25326 |title=Single-Stream Recycling Generates Debate |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2002-05-22 |website=Recycling Today |publisher=GIE Media, Inc. |location=Richfield, OH |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216075032/http://www.recyclingtoday.com/Article.aspx?article_id=25326 |archive-date=2014-12-16 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Potential for diminished public confidence if more recyclables are destined for [[landfill]] disposal because of contamination or inability to market materials.

==Single-stream system==

A single-stream system is a complex network of machinery that uses a combination of newer and older technologies to sort materials for recycling, including PET, HDPE, aluminum, tin cans, cardboard and paper.

'''List of equipment used in a single-stream system:'''
# '''Back Scraping Drum:''' spreads materials out on a conveyor belt
# '''OCC Screen:''' sorts cardboard/ old corrugated containers (OCC). Cardboard is sent to the American Baler to be baled.
# '''Fines Screen:''' all material except for cardboard go through Fines Screen. Fines Screen sorts out pieces of glass and fine materials less than two inches long. Glass is sent to the Glass Cleanup System for more separating.
# '''News Screen:''' sorts out newspaper from the rest of the recycling.
# '''Elliptical Separator:''' sorts 2D objects from 3D objects.
# '''Ferrous Magnet:''' pulls all ferrous metals to the magnet such as tin cans and steel. 
# '''Optical Sorter:''' reads the containers for PET plastic.
# '''Eddy Current Separator:''' pulls out all of the aluminum and non-ferrous materials.
# '''Two-Ram Baler:''' bales everything except for the cardboard and clear film.
# '''Glass CleanUp System:''' cleans glass coming off fines screen by pulling off all the light fractions.
# '''Closed Door Baler:''' bales the clear film plastic.
# '''Motion Floor:''' walking floor bunkers that stores corrugated and mixed paper.
# '''Single Ram Baler:''' bales all corrugated materials.

'''Situational strength''' is defined as cues provided by environmental forces regarding the desirability of potential behaviors.&lt;ref name="snyder-ickes-1985"/&gt; Situational strength is said to result in psychological pressure on the individual to engage in and/or refrain from particular behaviors. A consequence of this psychological pressure to act in a certain way is the likelihood that despite an individual's [[Personality type|personality]], they will act in a certain manner. As such, when strong situations (situations where situational strength is high) exist, the relationship between personality variables (for example, [[extraversion]], risk-taking behaviors, etc...) and behaviors is reduced, because no matter what the personality of the individual is, they will act in a way dictated by the situation. When weak situations exist, there is less structure and more ambiguity with respect to what behaviors to perform.&lt;ref name="snyder-ickes-1985"/&gt; In sum, situations have the ability to restrict the expression of [[individual differences]] in terms of actual behaviors.

==Contrasting strong and weak situations==
An example of a strong situation is a red traffic light. Traffic rules dictate how people are supposed to act when they see a red light, and this influence often prevents people from engaging in behaviors that are consistent with their personality. For example, most people, no matter whether they are daring or cautious, will stop in front of a red traffic light. Therefore, one could not reasonably predict how a person would behave with personality in this situation.

In contrast, an example of a weak situation is a yellow traffic light because the most appropriate course of action is not especially well defined and norms are inconsistent. Thus, individuals who are more daring are likely to speed through the intersection on a yellow light, whereas cautious individuals are likely to stop.

==Origins and history==
Although it is difficult to formally express when situations restricting individual differences in personality began in [[psychology]], work conducted by [[Carl Rogers]] suggested that certain individual differences are mostly likely to manifest themselves in situations where there is psychological freedom and safety, compared to situations where psychological freedom and safety do not exist.&lt;ref name="rogers-1954"/&gt; Additionally, [[Stanley Milgram]] argued that psychological forces of conflict may not be brought into play under diluted conditions.&lt;ref name="milgram-1965"/&gt; However, recent conceptualization and study of situational strength can be traced back to the work of [[Walter Mischel]]. In 1968, Mischel published his classic book, ''Personality and Assessment'', where he argued that personality cannot be studied in a vacuum; instead, the complexity of human behavior and its determinants must be studied from a perspective that accounts for the simultaneous and interactive impact of individual differences and situational characteristics.&lt;ref name="mischel-1968"/&gt; It is important to note that Mischel did not imply that people show no consistencies in behavior, or that individual differences are unimportant. The major theme was rather that the trait approach to personality was not as sensitive to the influence of situations as it should have been.&lt;ref name="mischel-1999"/&gt;

In books and articles on the topic, Mischel stressed the importance of better understanding how, when, and why individual differences are most likely to be important predictors of behavior, and when they are more likely to be nullified by situational influences. Specifically, Mischel began laying the foundation for subsequent thought in this area by arguing that psychological "situations" and "treatments" are powerful to the degree that they lead all persons to construe the particular events the same way, induce uniform expectancies regarding the most appropriate response pattern, provide adequate incentives for the performance of that response pattern, and instill the skills necessary for its satisfactory construction and execution (p.&amp;nbsp;276).&lt;ref name="mischel-1973"/&gt; He further argued that individual differences are most likely to directly affect behavior "when the situation is ambiguously structured... so that subjects are uncertain about how to categorize it and have no clear expectations about the behaviors most likely to be appropriate (normative, reinforced) in that situation" (p.&amp;nbsp;276).&lt;ref name="mischel-1973"/&gt; Thus, he helped to lay the foundation for the general idea underlying what is now typically referred to as "situational strength" (or "situation strength").

Mischel's work led to an important shift in social scientists' thinking about the behavioral expression of personality. But, as some have recently argued, situational strength is too often viewed as being true without treating situational strength as a theoretical construct in need of conceptual development and empirical verification.&lt;ref name="cooper-withey-2009"/&gt;

==Modern conceptualization and empirical verification==
Meyer, Dalal, and Hermida argue that for theoretical understanding and practical application of situational strength to be advanced, at least three important issues must be addressed:&lt;ref name="meyer-dalal-hermida-2009"/&gt;
# Examining the nature of the situational strength. Specifically, examining if there are unique facets in situational strength.
# Examining whether these facets affect all non-ability individual differences uniformly, or if some facets affect the expression of some traits more so than others.
# If facets do in fact have differential effects on the expression of various behaviors and predictor-outcome relationships, it will be necessary to develop theory regarding the specific mechanisms through which these facet-based effects occur.

Four facets of situational strength have been identified:
# Clarity: The extent to which cues regarding work-related responsibilities or requirements are available and easy to understand.
# Consistency: The extent to which cues regarding work-related responsibilities or requirements are compatible with each other.
# Constraints: The extent to which an individual's freedom of decision and action is limited by forces outside his or her control.
# Consequences: The extent to which decisions or actions have important positive or negative implications for any relevant person or entity.

In an empirical study, which incorporated vote-counting [[meta-analysis]], it has been found that conceptualizations of situational strength that currently exist in psychological literature form an interaction with non-ability individual differences. Additionally, the [[effect size]] of the interaction effect was reasonably large.&lt;ref name="meyer-dalal-hermida-2009"/&gt;

==Implications==
Perhaps the most important implication of situational strength is that it is commonly believed to explain cross-situational variability in the criterion-related validity of non-cognitive individual differences.&lt;ref name="snyder-ickes-1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mischel-1977"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mullins-cummings-1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="weiss-adler-1984"/&gt; This suggests that psychology should not focus on whether personality constructs predict job performance but rather about the conditions under which they predict job performance. This also shows great practical implications for personnel selection because the criterion-related validity of individual differences may vary across different occupations. For instance, Meyer, Dalal, and Bonaccio found that occupation-level situational strength moderates the conscientiousness–performance relationship, such that conscientiousness better predicts performance in characteristically weak occupations than in characteristically strong occupations.&lt;ref name="meyer-dalal-bonaccio-2009"/&gt;

Another important implication revolves around the idea of [[person-environment fit]]. One of the core ideas expressed in the fit literature is that a mismatch between individuals' needs and environmental supplies can have deleterious effects on performance, attitudes, and health.&lt;ref name="kristofbrown-zimmerman-johnson-2005"/&gt; Within the context of situational strength, some employees may view highly constraining environments as stifling and frustrating, whereas others may find the regimented and predictable nature of constraining environments to be comforting and relaxing. If these differences do in fact exist, this would suggest that employees' psychological reactions are partially a function of their individual differences profile and partially a function of the nature of the situation they are experiencing.

==Future directions==
Two critical aspects of situational strength can be fruitful for future study:
# It is possible that more or fewer categories of operationalizations exist. Thus, researchers should be encouraged to continue theoretical development and empirical tests of alternative structures of situational strength that might also serve to move our understanding of this phenomenon forward. Although the structure outlined by research carried out by Meyer, Dalal, &amp; Hermida was derived by attempting to find common themes among extant operationalizations, the approach assumed that the existing corpus of studies is a representative sample of situational strength's theoretical construct space. Thus, inductive theorizing that focuses on additional (or alternative) categories of operationalizations might be fruitful. Ultimately, however, direct empirical tests of any proposed conceptualization will need to be conducted—a task that is made more meaningful by the presence of a standardized instrument.&lt;ref name="meyer-dalal-hermida-2009"/&gt;
# Once the dimensional structure of situational strength has been determined, it will be possible to develop a standardized measure for use alongside traditional job analytic tools, in order "to analyze the context within which the job is embedded" (page 349).&lt;ref name="murphy-dzieweczynski-2005"/&gt; There are many potential benefits of such an instrument. First, it would allow researchers interested in examining the effects of situational strength on relevant trait-outcome relationships to do so in a way that is not only consistent across studies (which is not the case at present, as evidenced by our review of the empirical literature), but that also helps to develop a general situational strength literature—the absence of which has been noted.&lt;ref name="cooper-withey-2009"/&gt; Second, it would allow for an assessment of the relative importance of the dimensions of situational strength, helping researchers to determine which dimensions are necessary and/or sufficient to adequately understand a given interactional question.&lt;ref name="azen-budescu-2003"/&gt; Third, it would help researchers determine whether the situational strength dimensions [[interaction|interact]] with each other—and, if they do, whether these interactions are synergistic or antagonistic. Fourth, it would allow for large-scale analyses of the relative levels of situational strength that exist in diverse situations, the results of which could then be compiled into centralized databases that could help inform future practice and research.

[[File:CGJung.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|&lt;center&gt;Carl Gustav Jung&lt;/center&gt;]]

'''Synchronicity''' ({{lang-de|Synchronizität}}) is a concept, first introduced by [[Analytical psychology|analytical psychologist]] [[Carl Jung]], which holds that events are "meaningful coincidences" if they occur with no [[Causality|causal relationship]] yet seem to be meaningfully related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Cosmos and Psyche |last=Tarnas |first=Richard |year= 2006 |publisher=Penguin Group  |location=New York|isbn=0-670-03292-1 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his career, Jung furnished several different definitions of it.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard D. Beitman (2009) "Coincidence Studies: A Freudian Perspective..."&lt;/ref&gt; Jung defined synchronicity as an "acausal connecting (togetherness) principle," "meaningful coincidence", and "acausal parallelism." He introduced the concept as early as the 1920s but gave a full statement of it only in 1951 in an [[Eranos]] lecture.&lt;ref&gt;Casement, Ann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0g8chpSOI3AC&amp;printsec=frontcover "Who Owns Jung?"], Karnac Books, 2007. {{ISBN|1-85575-403-7}}. Cf. page 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952 Jung published a paper "Synchronizität als ein Prinzip akausaler Zusammenhänge" (Synchronicity&amp;nbsp;– An Acausal Connecting Principle)&lt;ref name=Synchronicity&gt;{{cite book |author=Jung, Carl G.|title=Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle|year=1993|publisher=Bollingen Foundation|location=Bollingen, Switzerland|origyear=1952 |isbn=978-0-691-01794-5}} Since included in his ''Collected Works'' volume 8.&lt;/ref&gt; in a volume which also contained a related study by the physicist and Nobel laureate [[Wolfgang Pauli]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/centres/psycho/publications/RMpapers.htm|title=Religion, Science, and Synchronicity|author=Roderick Main|year=2000|work=Harvest: Journal for Jungian Studies|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208041508/http://www.essex.ac.uk/centres/psycho/publications/RMpapers.htm|archivedate=2006-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was sometimes critical of Jung's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Metanexus Institute]] Charlene P. E. Burns (2011) [http://www.metanexus.net/essay/wolfgang-pauli-carl-jung-and-acausal-connecting-principle-case-study-transdisciplinarity Wolfgang Pauli, Carl Jung, and the Acausal Connecting Principle: A Case Study in Transdisciplinarity]&lt;/ref&gt; Jung's belief was that, just as events may be connected by causality, they may also be connected by [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]. Events connected by meaning need not have an explanation in terms of causality, which does not generally contradict the [[Axiom of Causality]].

Jung used the concept in arguing for the existence of the [[paranormal]].&lt;ref name=Roderick /&gt; A believer in the paranormal, [[Arthur Koestler]] wrote extensively on synchronicity in his 1972 book ''[[The Roots of Coincidence]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Koestler, Arthur (1973). ''The Roots of Coincidence''. Vintage. {{ISBN|0-394-71934-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of synchronicity as extending beyond mere coincidence (as well as the paranormal generally) is widely rejected in the academic and scientific community.

==Description==
[[File:Schéma synchronicité in English.png|thumb|400px|Diagram illustrating Carl Jung's concept of synchronicity]]
Jung coined the word "synchronicity" to describe "temporally coincident occurrences of acausal events." In his book ''[[Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle]]'', Jung wrote:&lt;ref name="Jung 1973 8"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jung |first=Carl |edition=first Princeton/Bollingen paperback|date=1973 |title=Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle |page=8|location=Princeton, New Jersey |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-15050-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation| How are we to recognize acausal combinations of events, since it is obviously impossible to examine all chance happenings for their causality? The answer to this is that acausal events may be expected most readily where, on closer reflection, a causal connection appears to be inconceivable.}}

In the introduction to his book, ''Jung on Synchronicity and the Paranormal'', Roderick Main wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Main|first1=Roderick|title=Jung on Synchronicity and the Paranormal|date=1997|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|The culmination of Jung's lifelong engagement with the paranormal is his theory of synchronicity, the view that the structure of reality includes a principle of acausal connection which manifests itself most conspicuously in the form of meaningful coincidences. Difficult, flawed, prone to misrepresentation, this theory none the less remains one of the most suggestive attempts yet made to bring the [[paranormal]] within the bounds of intelligibility.  It has been found relevant by psychotherapists, parapsychologists, researchers of spiritual experience and a growing number of non-specialists. Indeed, Jung's writings in this area form an excellent general introduction to the whole field of the paranormal.}}

In his book ''Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle'', Jung wrote:&lt;ref name="Jung 1973 8"/&gt;
{{quotation|...it is impossible, with our present resources, to explain [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]], or the fact of meaningful coincidence, as a phenomenon of energy. This makes an end of the causal explanation as well, for "effect" cannot be understood as anything except a phenomenon of energy. Therefore it cannot be a question of cause and effect, but of a falling together in time, a kind of simultaneity. Because of this quality of simultaneity, I have picked on the term "synchronicity" to designate a hypothetical factor equal in rank to causality as a principle of explanation.}}

Synchronicity was a principle which, Jung felt, gave conclusive evidence for his concepts of [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]] and the [[collective unconscious]].&lt;ref&gt;Jung defined the collective unconscious as akin to instincts in ''Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious''.&lt;/ref&gt; It described a governing dynamic which underlies the whole of human experience and history — social, emotional, psychological, and spiritual. The emergence of the synchronistic [[paradigm]] was a significant move away from [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualism]] towards an underlying philosophy of [[double-aspect theory]]. Some argue this shift was essential to bringing theoretical coherence to Jung's earlier work.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, R.S. (2014). Evolving Attitudes. ''International Journal of Jungian Studies'', 6.3, 243–253.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In ''Synchronicity'' in the final two pages of the Conclusion, Jung stated that not all coincidences are meaningful and further explained the creative causes of this [[phenomenon]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Even at Jung's presentation of his work on synchronicity in 1951 at an [[Eranos]] lecture, his ideas on synchronicity were evolving.  On Feb. 25, 1953, in a letter to Carl Seelig, the Swiss author and journalist who wrote a biography of Albert Einstein, Jung wrote, "Professor Einstein was my guest on several occasions at dinner. . . These were very early days when Einstein was developing his first theory of relativity [and] It was he who first started me on thinking about a possible relativity of time as well as space, and their psychic conditionality. More than 30 years later the stimulus led to my relation with the physicist professor W. Pauli and to my thesis of psychic synchronicity."&lt;ref name=Synchronicity /&gt; 

Following discussions with both [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Wolfgang Pauli]], Jung believed there were parallels between synchronicity and aspects of [[relativity theory]] and [[quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Igor V. Limar |title=Carl G. Jung’s Synchronicity and Quantum Entanglement: Schrödinger’s Cat ‘Wanders’ Between Chromosomes |url=http://www.neuroquantology.com/index.php/journal/article/view/376  |journal=NeuroQuantology |volume= 09 |page=313 |year=2011 |archiveurl = https://www.academia.edu/1248055/Carl_G._Jung_s_Synchronicity_and_Quantum_Entanglement_Schrodinger_s_Cat_Wanders_Between_Chromosomes |archivedate = 2011-06-30| issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=December 2018}} 

Jung believed life was not a series of random events but rather an expression of a deeper order, which he and Pauli referred to as ''[[Unus mundus]]''. This deeper order led to the insights that a person was both embedded in a universal wholeness and that the realisation of this was more than just an intellectual exercise, but also had elements of a spiritual awakening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Main|first1=Roderick|title=Revelations of Chance: Synchronicity as Spiritual Experience|date=2007|publisher=The State University of New York Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the religious perspective, synchronicity shares similar characteristics of an "intervention of grace". Jung also believed that in a person's life, synchronicity served a role similar to that of dreams, with the purpose of shifting a person's egocentric conscious thinking to greater wholeness.

==Examples==
[[File:Cetonia-aurata.jpg|thumb|''[[Cetonia aurata]]'']]
In his book ''Synchronicity'' Jung tells the following story as an example of a synchronistic event:
{{Quote|text=My example concerns a young woman patient who, in spite of efforts made on both sides, proved to be psychologically inaccessible. The difficulty lay in the fact that she always knew better about everything. Her excellent education had provided her with a weapon ideally suited to this purpose, namely a highly polished Cartesian rationalism with an impeccably "geometrical" idea of reality. After several fruitless attempts to sweeten her rationalism with a somewhat more human understanding, I had to confine myself to the hope that something unexpected and irrational would turn up, something that would burst the intellectual retort into which she had sealed herself. Well, I was sitting opposite her one day, with my back to the window, listening to her flow of rhetoric. She had an impressive dream the night before, in which someone had given her a golden scarab — a costly piece of jewellery. While she was still telling me this dream, I heard something behind me gently tapping on the window. I turned round and saw that it was a fairly large flying insect that was knocking against the window-pane from outside in the obvious effort to get into the dark room. This seemed to me very strange. I opened the window immediately and caught the insect in the air as it flew in. It was a scarabaeid beetle, or common rose-chafer (''Cetonia aurata''), whose gold-green colour most nearly resembles that of a golden scarab. I handed the beetle to my patient with the words, "Here is your scarab." This experience punctured the desired hole in her rationalism and broke the ice of her intellectual resistance. The treatment could now be continued with satisfactory results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jung |first=C.G. |title=Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle|year=1969 |publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey |isbn=978-0-691-15050-5 |pages=109–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The French writer [[Émile Deschamps]] claims in his memoirs that, in 1805, he was treated to some plum pudding by a stranger named Monsieur de Fontgibu. Ten years later, the writer encountered plum pudding on the menu of a Paris restaurant and wanted to order some, but the waiter told him that the last dish had already been served to another customer, who turned out to be de Fontgibu. Many years later, in 1832, Deschamps was at a dinner and once again ordered plum pudding. He recalled the earlier incident and told his friends that only de Fontgibu was missing to make the setting complete – and in the same instant, the now-senile de Fontgibu entered the room, having got the wrong address.&lt;ref&gt;Emile Deschamps, Oeuvres completes : Tomes I–VI, Reimpr. de l'ed. de Paris 1872–74&lt;/ref&gt;

Jung wrote, after describing some examples, "When coincidences pile up in this way, one cannot help being impressed by them – for the greater the number of terms in such a series, or the more unusual its character, the more improbable it becomes."&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung  Jung on Synchronicity and the Paranormal, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wolfgang Pauli young.jpg|left|thumb|Wolfgang Pauli]]In his book ''Thirty Years That Shook Physics – The Story of Quantum Theory'' (1966), George Gamow writes about [[Wolfgang Pauli]], who was apparently considered a person particularly associated with synchronicity events. Gamow whimsically refers to the "[[Pauli effect]]", a mysterious phenomenon which is not understood on a purely materialistic basis, and probably never will be. The following anecdote is told:
{{Quotation|It is well known that theoretical physicists cannot handle experimental equipment; it breaks whenever they touch it. Pauli was such a good theoretical physicist that something usually broke in the lab whenever he merely stepped across the threshold. A mysterious event that did not seem at first to be connected with Pauli's presence once occurred in Professor J. Franck's laboratory in Göttingen. Early one afternoon, without apparent cause, a complicated apparatus for the study of atomic phenomena collapsed. Franck wrote humorously about this to Pauli at his Zürich address and, after some delay, received an answer in an envelope with a Danish stamp. Pauli wrote that he had gone to visit Bohr and at the time of the mishap in Franck's laboratory his train was stopped for a few minutes at the Göttingen railroad station. You may believe this anecdote or not, but there are many other observations concerning the reality of the Pauli Effect! &lt;ref&gt;Thirty Years That Shook Physics – The Story of Quantum Theory, George Gamow, p. 64, Doubleday &amp; Co. Inc. New York, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Relationship with causality==
[[Causality]], when defined expansively (as for instance in the "mystic psychology" book ''[[The Kybalion]]'', or in the [[plato]]nic [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]-style [[Axiom of Causality]]), states that "nothing can happen without being caused." Such an understanding of causality may be incompatible with synchronicity. Other definitions of causality (for example, the [[David Hume#Causation|neo-Humean]] definition) are concerned only with the relation of cause to effect. As such, they are compatible with synchronicity. There are also opinions which hold that, where there is no external observable cause, the cause can be internal.&lt;ref&gt;Psychologies of Mind: The Collected Papers of [[John Maze]], edited by Rachael Henry&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also pointed out that, since Jung took into consideration only the narrow definition of causality – only the [[Four causes#Efficient cause|efficient cause]] – his notion of "''acausality''" is also narrow and so is not applicable to [[Four causes#Final cause|final]] and [[Four causes#Formal cause|formal]] causes as understood in [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] or [[Thomism|Thomist]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;James Arraj (1996) ''The Mystery of Matter: Nonlocality, Morphic Resonance, Synchronicity and the Philosophy of Nature of St. Thomas Aquinas, [http://www.innerexplorations.com/catchmeta/mys8.htm ch. 8. Synchronicity and Formal Causality]''&lt;/ref&gt; The final causality is inherent&lt;ref&gt;Victor Mansfield, (1995), ''Synchronicity, Science and Soul-Making: Understanding Jungian Synchronicity Through Physics, Buddhism, and Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; in synchronicity (because it leads to [[individuation]]) or synchronicity can be a kind of replacement for final causality; however, such [[finalism]] or [[teleology]] is considered to be outside the domain of modern science.

==Explanations==

===Religion===

Many people believe that the Universe or God causes synchronicities. Among the general public, divine intervention is the most widely accepted explanation for meaningful coincidences.&lt;ref name=Roderick&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rushnell|first1=S.|title=When God winks|date=2006|publisher=Atria Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Mathematics===

Jung and his followers (e.g., Marie-Louise von Franz) share in common the belief that numbers are the archetypes of order, and the major participants in synchronicity creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Number and Time: Reflections Leading toward a Unification of Depth Psychology and Physics. |last=Von Franz |first=M.L. |year= 1974 |publisher=Northwestern University Press|}}&lt;/ref&gt;This hypothesis has implications that are relevant to some of the “chaotic” phenomena in nonlinear dynamics. [[Dynamical systems theory]] has provided a new context from which to speculate about synchronicity because it gives predictions about the transitions between emergent states of order and nonlocality.&lt;ref&gt;Hogenson, G. B. (2005). The self, the symbolic and synchronicity: Virtual realities and the emergence of the psyche. ''Journal of Analytical Psychology'', 50, 271–284. https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0021-8774.2005.00531.x&lt;/ref&gt; This view, however, is not part of mainstream mathematical thought.

===Quantum Physics===

According to a certain view, synchronicity serves as a way of making sense of or describing some aspects of quantum mechanics. It argues that quantum experiments demonstrate that, at least in the microworld of subatomic particles, there is an instantaneous connection between particles no matter how far away they are from one another. Known as quantum non-locality or [[Quantum_entanglement|entanglement]], the proponents of this view argue that this points to a unified field that precedes physical reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Mind, Matter and Quantum Mechanics.|last=Stapp |first=H.P. |year= 2015 |publisher=Springer Verlag  |location=Berlin, Heidelberg|}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with archetypal reasoning, the proponents argue that two events can correspond to each other (e.g. particle with particle, or person with person) in a meaningful way. 

Synchronicity can also be seen in [[David Bohm]]'s theory of [[implicate order]]. According to Bohm's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Wholeness and the implicate order.|last=Bohm |first=David |year= 1980 |publisher=Routledge   |location=London, UK|}}&lt;/ref&gt; theory, there are three major realms of existence: the explicate (unfolded) order, the implicate (enfolded) order, and a source or ground beyond both. The flowing movement of the whole can thus be understood as a process of continuous enfolding and unfolding of order or structure. From moment to moment there is a rhythmic pulse between implicate and explicate realities. Therefore, synchronicity would literally take place as the bridge between implicate and explicate orders, whose complementary nature define the undivided totality.

===Probability theory===

Mainstream mathematics argues that statistics and probability theory (exemplified in, e.g., [[Littlewood's law]] or the [[law of truly large numbers]]) suffice to explain any purported synchronistic events as mere [[coincidence]]s.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;John Navin, interview with [[David Hand (statistician)|David Hand]], (2014), [https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnnavin/2014/02/18/why-coincidences-miracles-and-rare-events-happen-every-day/3/ Why Coincidences, Miracles And Rare Events Happen Every Day], [[Forbes]].com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Lane &amp; Andrea Diem Lane, 2010, [http://www.integralworld.net/lane15.html DESULTORY DECUSSATION Where Littlewood’s Law of Miracles meets Jung’s Synchronicity], www.integralworld.net&lt;/ref&gt; The law of large numbers, for instance, states that in large enough populations, any strange event is arbitrarily likely to happen by mere chance. However, some proponents of synchronicity question whether it is even sensible in principle to try to evaluate synchronicity statistically. Jung himself and von Franz argued that statistics work precisely by ignoring what is unique about the individual case, whereas synchronicity tries to investigate that uniqueness.  

Among some psychologists, Jung's works, such as ''The Interpretation of Nature and the Psyche'', were received as problematic. Fritz Levi, in his 1952 review in ''Neue Schweizer Rundschau'' (New Swiss Observations), critiqued Jung's theory of synchronicity as vague in determinability of synchronistic events, saying that Jung never specifically explained his rejection of "magic causality" to which such an acausal principle as synchronicity would be related. He also questioned the theory's usefulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Bishop|first = Paul|title = Synchronicity and Intellectual Intuition in Kant, Swedenborg, and Jung| publisher = The Edwin Mellen Press

===Psychology===

In [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]], [[confirmation bias]] is a tendency to search for or interpret new information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions, and avoids information and interpretations that contradict prior beliefs. It is a type of [[cognitive bias]] and represents an error of [[inductive inference]], or is a form of [[selection bias]] toward confirmation of the hypothesis under study, or disconfirmation of an alternative hypothesis. Confirmation bias is of interest in the teaching of [[critical thinking]], as the skill is misused if rigorous critical scrutiny is applied only to evidence that challenges a preconceived idea, but not to evidence that supports it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/timvangelder/publications-1/heads-i-win-tails-you-lose-desire-s-hold-over-reason/HeadsIWin.pdf Tim van Gelder, "Heads I win, tails you lose": A Foray Into the Psychology of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, in psychology and sociology, the term [[apophenia]] is used for the mistaken detection of a pattern or meaning in random or meaningless data.&lt;ref&gt;Brugger, Peter. "From Haunted Brain to Haunted Science: A Cognitive Neuroscience View of Paranormal and Pseudoscientific Thought", ''Hauntings and Poltergeists: Multidisciplinary Perspectives'', edited by J. Houran and R. Lange (North Carolina: [[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland &amp; Company, Inc. Publishers]], 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptics, such as Robert Todd Carroll of the Skeptic's Dictionary, argue that the perception of synchronicity is better explained as apophenia. Primates use pattern detection in their form of intelligence,&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03201828 Pattern recognition of behavioral events in the nonhuman primate]&lt;/ref&gt; and this can lead to erroneous identification of non-existent patterns. A famous example of this is the fact that human face recognition is so robust, and based on such a basic archetype (essentially two dots and a line contained in a circle), that human beings are very prone to identify faces in random data all through their environment, like the "man in the moon", or faces in wood grain, an example of the visual form of apophenia known as [[pareidolia]].&lt;ref name="faces"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/13/health/psychology/13face.html|title=Facial Recognition – Brain – Faces, Faces Everywhere|publisher=New York Times|first=Elizabeth | last=Svoboda | date= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Charles Tart]] sees danger in synchronistic thinking: 'This danger is the temptation to mental laziness. [...] it would be very tempting to say, "Well, it's synchronistic, it's forever beyond my understanding," and so (prematurely) give up trying to find a causal explanation.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Tart]],  [http://www.roma1.infn.it/rog/group/frasca/b/synchtart.html Causality and Synchronicity – Steps Toward Clarification], (1981), [[Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research]], vol. 75, pp. 121–141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyway, synchronicity cannot be attained to by mere intellectual means. It is an autonomous phenomenon that is not invented by the intellect, but rather, experienced. synchronicity is a self produced image spontaneously blossoming from the psyche as a whole that simultaneously reflects and effects what is going on within the very psyche that produced it. It has also been argued that [[Analytical psychology|Jungian psychology's]] theory of synchronicity is equivalent to intellectual [[Intuition (psychology)|intuition]].&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, pp. 17–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The World Without Us''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book about what would happen to the [[natural environment|natural]] and [[built environment]] if humans suddenly disappeared, written by American journalist [[Alan Weisman]] and published by [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Thomas Dunne Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Weisman |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Weisman |title=The World Without Us |date=2007-07-10 |publisher=Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=0-312-34729-4 |oclc=122261590}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a book-length expansion of Weisman's own February 2005 ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' article "Earth Without People".&lt;ref name=EWP&gt;{{Citation |last=Weisman |first=Alan |author-link=Alan Weisman |publication-date=February 2005 |title=Earth Without People |periodical=Discover Magazine |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=60–65 |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2005/feb/earth-without-people/ |accessdate=2007-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written largely as a [[thought experiment]], it outlines, for example, how cities and houses would deteriorate, how long man-made artifacts would last, and how remaining lifeforms would evolve. Weisman concludes that residential neighborhoods would become forests within 500 years, and that radioactive waste, [[bronze]] statues, [[plastics]], and [[Mount Rushmore]] would be among the longest-lasting evidence of human presence on Earth.

The author of four previous books and numerous articles for magazines, Weisman traveled to interview academics, scientists and other authorities. He used quotations from these interviews to explain the effects of the natural environment and to substantiate predictions. The book has been translated and published in many countries. It was successful in the U.S., reaching #6 on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]]&lt;ref name=NYTBSsept9&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/09/books/bestseller/0909besthardnonfiction.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090423212726/http://www.nytimes.com/glogin?URI=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/09/books/bestseller/0909besthardnonfiction.html&amp;OQ=_rQ3D2Q26orefQ3Dslogin&amp;OP=6d9c2618Q2FQ23(Q2B,Q23Q51i8!_iihNQ23NQ3CQ3CQ5EQ23Q3CQ26Q23Q3CQ26Q23,ii0!Q23,Q2B!h!Q2BvvQ2B_Q23Q3CQ26Q3CQ26,Q2B!hYM_Q514i4Q5Dm8hmi4DYhjv |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-04-23 |title=Best Sellers: Hardcover Nonfiction |accessdate=2007-11-02 |date=2007-09-09 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and #1 on the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' Best-Sellers list in September 2007.&lt;ref name=SFC&gt;{{Citation |url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/09/23/RV0SS7TK4.DTL&amp;hw=world+without+us&amp;sn=004&amp;sc=995 |title=San Francisco Chronicle Best-Sellers: Nonfiction Bay Area |accessdate=2007-11-02 |date=2007-09-23 |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ranked #1 on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/top10/article/0,30583,1686204_1686244_1691412,00.html Poniewozik, James; Top 10 New TV Series; time.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'s'' {{nowrap|top 10 non-fiction books}} of 2007.

==Background==
The idea of exploring the effects of the depopulating of the Earth is an old one, having been a regular trope in [[science fiction]] novels for decades. Post-apocalyptic literature in general had often tried to imagine the fate of civilization and its artifacts after the end of humanity. Indeed, an extremely popular 1949 novel, ''[[Earth Abides]],'' portrayed the breakdown of urban systems and structures after a pandemic, through the eyes of a survivor, who muses at the end of the first chapter: "What would happen to the world and its creatures without man? That he was left to see."

''The World Without Us'' applies a more ecological view to ''Earth Abides''. Before writing it, the author, [[Alan Weisman]], had written four books, including, ''Gaviotas: A Village to Reinvent the World,'' in 1998, about the [[eco-village]] of [[Gaviotas]] in Colombia; and ''An Echo In My Blood,'' in 1999, about his family's history immigrating from [[Ukraine]] to the United States. He has worked as an international journalist for American magazines and newspapers, and at the time of writing the book was an Associate Professor of Journalism and Latin American Studies at the [[University of Arizona]]. The position required him to teach only one class in the spring semester, and he was free to travel and conduct research the rest of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Williams |first=Wilda |date=2007-05-15 |title=The Lonely Planet |periodical=[[Library Journal]] |publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] |volume=132 |issue=9 |page=112 |issn=0363-0277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea for ''The World Without Us'' was suggested to Weisman in 2004 by Josie Glausiusz, an editor at ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]''.&lt;ref name=pg277&gt;Weisman (2007), 277.&lt;/ref&gt; She had pondered the idea for several years and asked Weisman to write a feature on the subject after she re-read "Journey through a Doomed Land", an article he published in 1994 in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' about the state of [[Chernobyl]] eight years after abandonment.&lt;ref name=pg277/&gt; His ''Discover'' article, "Earth Without People", published in the February 2005 issue and re-printed in ''The Best American Science Writing 2006'' anthology,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Weisman |first=Alan |author-link=Alan Weisman |date=February 2005 |publication-date=September 5, 2006 |contribution=Earth Without People |editor-last=Gawande |editor-first=Atul |editor-link=Atul Gawande |editor2-last=Cohen |editor2-first=Jesse |title=The Best American Science Writing |edition=2006 |publication-place=New York |publisher=Harper Perennial |pages=28–36 |isbn=978-0-06-072644-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes how nature has thrived in the abandoned [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] and how nature would overwhelm the [[built environment]] of [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=EWP/&gt; Using interviews with [[Paleoecology|paleoecologists]], the article speculates that [[megafauna]] would return and that forest cover, like the [[Białowieża Forest]], would spread over Europe and the [[eastern United States]]. The article raises the prospect of failing power plants, chemical plants, dams, and petroleum tanks.

To expand this into a book, Weisman's agent found an editor and publisher at [[St. Martin's Press]]. Among the 23-page bibliography are two articles he wrote for the [[Los Angeles Times Magazine]] ("Naked Planet" on persistent organic pollutants, and "The Real Indiana Jones" on the [[Mayan civilization]]) and one published in the ''[[Condé Nast Traveler]]'' ("Diamond in the Wild" on diamond mining), as well as ''Discover'''s "Earth Without People".&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 289–311.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional research saw Weisman travel to England, Cyprus, Turkey, Panama, and Kenya. Interviews with academics quoted in the book include biologist [[E. O. Wilson]] on the Korean Demilitarized Zone,&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 129, 189–190.&lt;/ref&gt; archaeologist [[William Rathje]] on plastics in garbage,&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt; forest botanist [[Oliver Rackham]] on vegetative cover across Britain,&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 150–151.&lt;/ref&gt; anthropologist [[Arthur Demarest]] on the crash of [[Maya civilization|Mayan civilization]],&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 224–229.&lt;/ref&gt; paleobiologist [[Douglas Erwin]] on evolution,&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 229–232.&lt;/ref&gt; and philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] on [[Transhumanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 240–244.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The book is divided into 27 chapters, with a [[Prologue|prelude]], [[epilogue|coda]], [[bibliography]] and [[Index (publishing)|index]]. Each chapter deals with a new topic, such as the potential fates of plastics, petroleum infrastructure, nuclear facilities, and artworks. It is written from the point of view of a [[science journalist]] with explanations and testimonies backing his predictions. There is no unifying narrative, cohesive single-chapter overview, or thesis.&lt;ref name=Weiler&gt;{{Citation |last=Weiler |first=Derek |publication-date=August 12, 2007 |title=And the wild things shall inherit the Earth |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/245456 |accessdate=2007-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Appleton&gt;{{Citation |last=Appleton |first=Josie |date=July 2007 |title=Unleashing nature's terror |work=[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]|issue=3 |url=http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/reviewofbooks_article/3628/ |accessdate=2007-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weisman's thought experiment pursues two themes: how nature would react to the disappearance of humans and what legacy humans would leave behind. To foresee how other life could continue without humans, Weisman reports from areas where the natural environment exists with little human intervention, like the [[Białowieża Forest]], the [[Kingman Reef]], and the [[Palmyra Atoll]]. He interviews biologist [[E. O. Wilson]] and visits with members of the [[Korean Federation for Environmental Movement]] at the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] where few humans have penetrated since 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 183&amp;ndash;188.&lt;/ref&gt; He tries to conceive how life may evolve by describing the past evolution of pre-historic plants and animals, but notes Douglas Erwin's warning that "we can't predict what the world will be 5 million years later by looking at the survivors".&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Several chapters are dedicated to [[megafauna]], which Weisman predicts would proliferate. He profiles soil samples from the past 200 years and extrapolates concentrations of heavy metals and foreign substances into a future without industrial inputs. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere and implications for climatic change are likewise examined.

[[File:Pripjat Panorama.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The abandoned city of [[Pripyat]], near [[Chernobyl]]]]With material from previous articles, Weisman uses the fate of the [[Mayan civilization]] to illustrate the possibility of an entrenched society vanishing and how the natural environment quickly conceals evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 223&amp;ndash;8.&lt;/ref&gt; To demonstrate how vegetation could compromise human built infrastructure, Weisman interviewed hydrologists and employees at the [[Panama Canal]], where constant maintenance is required to keep the jungle vegetation and silt away from the dams.&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 173&amp;ndash;178.&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate abandoned cities succumbing to nature, Weisman reports from [[Chernobyl|Chernobyl, Ukraine]] (abandoned in 1986) and [[Varosha (Famagusta)|Varosha, Cyprus]] (abandoned in 1974). Weisman finds that their structures crumble as weather does unrepaired damage and other life forms create new habitats. In Turkey, Weisman contrasts the construction practices of the rapidly growing [[Istanbul]], as typical for large cities in less developed countries, with the [[underground cities]] in [[Cappadocia]]. Due to a large demand for housing in Istanbul much of it was developed quickly with whatever material was available and could collapse in a major earthquake or other natural disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 103&amp;ndash;105.&lt;/ref&gt; Cappadocian underground cities were built thousands of years ago out of volcanic [[tuff]], and are likely to survive for centuries to come.&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 106&amp;ndash;111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weisman uses [[New York City]] as a model to outline how an unmaintained urban area would deconstruct. He explains that sewers would clog, underground streams would flood subway corridors, and soils under roads would erode and cave in. From interviews with members of the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]]&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 22&amp;ndash;24.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[New York Botanical Gardens]]&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 28&amp;ndash;32.&lt;/ref&gt; Weisman predicts that native vegetation would return, spreading from parks and out-surviving invasive species. Without humans to provide food and warmth, rats and cockroaches would die off.
[[File:Dunn County-old farm.jpg|right|thumb|200px|An abandoned house in a state of collapse]]
Weisman explains that a common house would begin to fall apart as water eventually leaks into the roof around the flashings, erodes the wood and rusts the nails, leading to sagging walls and eventual collapse. After 500 years, all that would be left would be aluminum dishwasher parts, stainless steel cookware, and plastic handles.&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The longest-lasting evidence on Earth of a human presence would be radioactive materials, ceramics, bronze statues, and Mount Rushmore. In space, the [[Pioneer plaque]]s, the [[Voyager Golden Record]], and radio waves would outlast the Earth itself.&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 249&amp;ndash;254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Breaking from the theme of the natural environment after humans, Weisman considers what could lead to the sudden, complete [[human extinction|demise of humans]] without serious damage to the built and natural environment. That scenario, he concludes, is extremely unlikely. He also considers [[transhumanism]], the [[Voluntary Human Extinction Movement]], the [[Church of Euthanasia]] and [[John A. Leslie]]'s ''The End of the World: the Science and Ethics of Human Extinction''.&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 239&amp;ndash;244.&lt;/ref&gt; Weisman concludes the book considering a new version of the [[one-child policy]]. While he admits it is a "draconian measure",&lt;ref&gt;Weisman (2007), 272.&lt;/ref&gt; he states, "The bottom line is that any species that overstretches its resource base suffers a population crash. Limiting our reproduction would be damn hard, but limiting our consumptive instincts may be even harder."&lt;ref name=WaPo&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2007/07/27/DI2007072701908.html |title=Book World |accessdate=2007-11-11

Pete Garceau designed the cover art for the American release, which one critic said was "a thick layer of sugar-coated sweetness in an effort to not alarm potential readers.

Several critics found the lack of an anthropomorphic point of view hurt the book's relevance.&lt;ref name=Long/&gt; Robert Braile in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' wrote that it has "no real context ... no rationale for probing this fantasy other than [Weisman's] unsubstantiated premise that people find it fascinating".&lt;ref name=Braile&gt;{{Citation | last=Braile | first=Robert | publication-date= August 18, 2007 | title=He imagines a world without people.

She writes the "book [is] designed to help us find the how of survival by shaking us out of our passive dance with death".&lt;ref name=Michell&gt;{{Citation | last=Michell| first=Alanna| publication-date= July 21, 2007 | title=Good riddance to us and our bad rubbish | newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |publisher=[[CTVglobemedia]] |pages=D6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book's environmental focus was also criticized by some.

Other critics hailed the environmental perspective.

==Genre==
The book is categorized as [[Science book|non-fiction science]] but some commentators emphasize it may be better described as [[speculative fiction]].&lt;ref name=Stott&gt;{{Citation | last=Stott| first=Philip |author-link=Philip Stott |year= 2008 |volume=1 |issue=2| title=Book review: The World Without Us By Alan Weisman |publisher =[[Electronic Journal of Sustainable Development]] |url= http://www.ejsd.org/docs/REVIEW_OF_THE_WORLD_WITHOUT_US.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2008-06-17 |pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The World Without Us'' is grounded in [[Environmental journalism|environmental]] and [[science journalism]].

This approach to the genre, which "throw[s] the spotlight on the earth itself",&lt;ref name=Kamiya/&gt; was found to be creative and objective.&lt;ref name=Weiler /&gt; There have been other books that address similar topics, such as [[Gregory Benford]]'s 1999 book ''Deep Time: How Humanity Communicates Across Millennia''. [[Science fiction]] writers such as [[H. G. Wells]] (''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', 1898) and [[John Wyndham]] (''[[The Day of the Triffids]]'', 1951) had earlier touched upon the possible fate of cities and other man-made structures after the sudden removal of their creators. Similar parallels in the decay of civilization are detailed in 1949 post-apocalyptic [[science fiction]] [[novel]] by Berkeley English professor [[George R. Stewart]], ''[[Earth Abides]].''

Addressing his approach, Weisman said that eliminating the human element eliminated the "fear factor" that people are doing something wrong or that they will die; it is meant to be read as a fantasy, according to the author.&lt;ref name=powell/&gt; Josie Appleton of ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]'' related the book to "today's romanticisation of nature" in that it linked "the decadence and detachment of a modern consumerist society" with an ignorance of the efforts required to produce products so easily disposed.&lt;ref name=Appleton /&gt; Appleton also felt the book countered the "Nature knows best" notion by highlighting the randomness of natural forces.&lt;ref name=Appleton/&gt;

Weisman's science journalism style uses interviews with academic and professional authorities to substantiate conclusions, while maintaining the "cool and dispassionate [tone]...of a scientific observer rather than an activist".&lt;ref name=Weiler/&gt; Weisman said he purposely avoided the [[activist]] label: "Some of our finest science and nature writers only get read by people who already agree with them. It's nice to get some affirmation for whatever it is you believe is true, even if it's quite sobering, but I wanted to write something that people would read ... without minimizing the significance of what's going on, nor trivializing it, nor oversimplifying it."&lt;ref name=powell&gt;{{cite interview | subject=Alan Weisman | subjectlink =Alan Weisman |interviewer= Dave Weich| title = With People out of the Picture, Alan Weisman Gets Creative |url= http://www.powells.com/authors/alanweisman.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071228054006/http://www.powells.com/authors/alanweisman.html |archivedate= 2007-12-28 | work = [[Powell's Books|Powells.com]] |location= Portland |date= 2007-07-19 | accessdate = 2007-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Fortey]] compares the book to the works of [[Jared Diamond]], [[Tim Flannery]] and [[E.O.

'''Tranquillity''' (also spelled '''tranquility'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/tranquility&amp;r=67 Answers.com], retrieved on 12-16-2010.&lt;/ref&gt;) is the quality or state of being tranquil; that is, calm, serene, and worry-free. The word tranquillity appears in numerous texts ranging from the religious writings of Buddhism, where the term ''[[passaddhi]]'' refers to tranquillity of the body, thoughts and consciousness on the path to enlightenment, to an assortment of policy and planning guidance documents, where interpretation of the word is typically linked to engagement with the [[natural environment]].

==Benefits==
[[psychology|Psychological]] being in a tranquil or ‘restorative’ environment allows individuals to take respite from the periods of sustained ‘directed attention’ that characterise modern living. In developing their [[Attention Restoration Theory]] (ART), Kaplan and Kaplan&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan R. and Kaplan, S. (1989). The Experience of Nature. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that recovery from cognitive overload could most effectively be achieved by engaging with natural restorative environments, that are away from daily distractions and have the extent and mystery that allows the imagination to wander, thereby enabling individuals to engage effortlessly with their surroundings. The theory works on the principle that the amount of reflection possible within such an environment depends upon the type of cognitive engagement, i.e. fascination; that the environment holds. ‘Soft fascination’ is deemed to occur when there is enough interest in the surroundings to hold attention but not so much that it compromises the ability to reflect. In essence, soft fascination, which has been taken by Herzog&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, T. R. and Bosley, P. J. (1992). Tranquillity and preference as affective qualities of natural environments. Journal of Environmental Psychology 12, 115-127.&lt;/ref&gt; and Pheasant&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Pheasant, Mark N. Fisher, Greg R. Watts, David J. Whitaker and Kirill V. Horoshenkov. (2010). The importance of auditory-visual interaction in the construction of tranquil space. Journal of Environmental Psychology 30, 501 -509.&lt;/ref&gt; as a reasonable term to describe tranquillity, provides a pleasing level of sensory input that involves no cognitive effort other than removing oneself from an overcrowded mental space.

===Enjoyment===
For many, the chance to experience tranquillity is what makes the countryside different from cities. In a survey by the [[United Kingdom Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] (DEFRA) 58% of people said that tranquillity was the most positive feature of the countryside.

===Health===
In contrast to ‘soft fascination’, ‘directed attention’ requires a significant amount of cognitive effort and it is known that prolonged periods of sustained mental activity can lead to directed attention fatigue. This condition has the potential to significantly affect performance and bring about negative emotions, irritability and decreased sensitivity to interpersonal cues.&lt;ref&gt;Hartig, T., Kaiser, F. G. &amp; Bowler, P. A. (1997). Further development of a measure of perceived environmental restorativeness. Working paper 5, Institute for Housing Research, Uppsala University, Sweden.&lt;/ref&gt; As the incidence of mental illness continues to rise,&lt;ref&gt;Berglund, B., Lindvall, T and Schwela, D. H. (1999). World Health Organisation guidelines for community noise.&lt;/ref&gt; there is growing evidence that exposure to natural environments can make a significant contribution to health and [[wellbeing]]. Mounting evidence shows, that exposure to nature contributes to physical and psychological wellbeing, such as the review carried out by Louv,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Louv. (2008). Last Child in the Woods: Saving our Children from Nature Deficit Disorder. Algonquin Press&lt;/ref&gt; that found evidence of ‘nature-deficit-disorder’ in children, which suggests that the importance of being able to engage with restorative environments applies across a wide age range. 
Others report that natural tranquil surroundings have profound physiological effects on people suffering from [[Stress (biology)|stress]]. For example, Ullrich&lt;ref&gt;R. S. Ulrich, F. Simons, B. D. Losito, E. Fiorito, M. A. Miles and M. Zelson. (1991). Stress recovery during exposure to natural and urban environments. Journal of Environmental Psychology 11, 201-230.&lt;/ref&gt; found that stress (as measured by blood pressure, muscle tension and skin conductance response), induced by showing videos of workplace injuries, improved significantly quicker following further viewing if videos included natural surroundings rather than busy traffic or shopping scenes. A recent study has demonstrated the benefits of simulating such environments for pain relief during bone marrow aspirate and biopsy.&lt;ref&gt;biopsyLechtzin N, Busse A M, Smith M T, Grossman S, Nesbit S, Diette G B. (2010).  Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine 16(9), 965–972.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic===
Since seeking tranquillity is an important reason why many people visit the countryside, the presence of tranquil areas helps boost rural tourism. Since rural tourism in the UK directly supports 380,000 jobs and £13.8 billion annually to the economy, and a recent survey showed that tranquillity is the main reason why 49% of visitors go are attracted to the countryside, one can conclude that tranquillity is worth 186,200 jobs and £6.76 billion a year to the economy.{{Ref|rural}}

==Tranquillity research==
Natural settings that effortlessly engage our attention are typically associated with soft fascination and with the analysis of tranquillity and preference published by Herzog and Bosely (1992). In this study, the authors attempted to distinguish empirically between the constructs of tranquillity and preference as affective qualities of natural environments. Motivated by ART, from which they took tranquillity as a reasonable term to describe soft fascination, they produced definitions for each component. Tranquillity they defined as "how much you think this setting is a quiet, peaceful place, a good place to get away from everyday life", and preference as "how much you like this setting for whatever reason".
Subjects were asked to score the following visual settings: mountains, deserts, fields / forests and waterscapes against the two target variables, tranquillity and preference, and four descriptor variables: mistiness, unstructured openness, focus and surface calmness. Tranquillity and preference were positively correlated across all settings with tranquillity scoring higher ratings in the field / forest, waterscape and mountain categories, whilst rushing water had the highest rating in the preference category.
Analysis of the results identified three physical features that help explain the apparent split between tranquillity and preference. These were; mistiness, unstructured openness; which refers to how open the scene is and how difficult it is to establish a sense of depth or distance, and surface calmness. Mistiness and unstructured openness tended to depress preference relative to tranquillity whilst surface calmness tended to enhance it. Herzog and Barnes&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, T. R. &amp; Barnes, G. J. (1999). Tranquillity and preference revisited. Journal of Environmental Psychology 19, 171-18.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a follow up study in which deserts and waterscapes were included in the setting types. In 2000, Herzog and Chernick&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, T. R. and Chernick, K. K. (2000). Tranquility and Danger in Urban and Natural Settings. Journal of Environmental Psychology, 20, 29-39.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted further research into the tranquillity construct when they investigated the relationship between tranquillity and danger in urban and rural settings.
The key results that emerged from this research were that ‘setting care’, which relates to how safe we feel in a particular setting, is more salient for judgments of danger in urban settings than natural ones and that openness was a significant predictor of danger but not of tranquillity. The authors concluded therefore that tranquillity and danger should not simply be viewed as polar opposites, but like preference and tranquillity as distinct constructs.

===The role of audio-visual interaction within the tranquillity construct===

Within tranquillity studies, much of the emphasis has been placed on understanding the role of vision in the [[perception]] of natural environments, which is probably not surprising, considering that upon first viewing a scene its configurational coherence can be established with incredible speed. Indeed, scene information can be captured in a single glance&lt;ref&gt;Oliva, A. &amp; Torralba, A. (2006). Building the gist of a scene: The role of global image features and recognition. Progress in Brain Research 155 (2), 23 – 36.&lt;/ref&gt; and the gist of a scene determined in as little as 100ms.&lt;ref&gt;Dobel, C. &amp; Gumnoir, H. (2006). Describing scenes hardly seen. Acta Psychologica 125, 129 – 143.&lt;/ref&gt; The speed of processing of complex natural images was tested by Thorpe ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe, S., Fize, D. &amp; Marlot, C. (1996). Speed of processing in the human visual system. Nature 381, 520 – 522.&lt;/ref&gt; using colour photographs of a wide range of animals (mammals, birds, reptiles and fish), in their natural environments, mixed with distracters that included pictures of forests, mountains, lakes, buildings and fruit. During this experiment, subjects were shown an image for 20ms and asked to determine whether it contained an animal or not. The electrophysiological brain responses obtained in this study showed that a decision could be made within 150ms of the image being seen, indicating the speed at which cognitive visual processing occurs.
However, audition, and in particular the individual components that collectively comprise the [[soundscape]], a term coined by Schafer&lt;ref&gt;Schafer, R. M. (1977). The Soundscape: Our sonic environment and the tuning of the world. Destiny Books Rochester, Vermont.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the ever-present array of sounds that constitute the sonic environment, also significantly inform the various schemata used to characterise differing landscape types. This interpretation is supported by the auditory reaction times, which are 50 to 60ms faster than that of the visual modality.&lt;ref&gt;Jaśkowski, P., Jaroszyk, F., &amp; Hojan-Jezierska, D. (1990). Temporal-order judgement and reaction time for stimuli of different modalities. Psychol Research  52, 35-38.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known that sound can alter visual perception&lt;ref&gt;Shams, L., Kanutani, S. &amp; Shimojo, S. (2002). Visual illusion induced by sound. Journal of Cognitive Brain Research 14, 147 – 152.&lt;/ref&gt; and that under certain conditions areas of the brain involved in processing auditory information can be activated in response to visual stimuli. 
Research conducted by Pheasant ''et al.'' has shown that when individuals make tranquillity assessments based on a uni-modal auditory or visual sensory input, they characterise the environment by drawing upon a number of key landscape and soundscape characteristics. For example, when making assessments in response to visual-only stimuli the percentage of water, flora and geological features present within a scene, positively influence how tranquil a location is perceived to be. Likewise when responding to uni-modal auditory stimuli, the perceived loudness of biological sounds positively influences the perception of tranquillity, whilst the perceived loudness of mechanical sounds have a negative effect. However, when presented with bi-modal auditory-visual stimuli the individual soundscape and landscape components alone no longer influenced the perception of tranquillity. Rather configurational coherence was provided by the percentage of natural and contextual features present within the scene and the equivalent continuous sound pressure level (LAeq).

===Predicting tranquillity===

Researchers at the Bradford Centre for Sustainable Environments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainable-environments.brad.ac.uk/|title=Please wait while you are being redirected|website=www.sustainable-environments.brad.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; have developed a methodology by which the perceived tranquillity rating (TR) of an amenity area such as park, green or urban square can be measured, on a 0 - 10 scale.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J Pheasant, Kirill V Horoshenkov and Greg R Watts. Tranquillity Rating prediction tool (TRAPT). Institute of Acoustics – Acoustics Bulletin, 35 (6), November/December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Pheasant., K. V. Horoshenkov., G. R. Watts and B. T. Barrett. (2008). The acoustic and visual factors influencing the construction of tranquil space in urban and rural environments: Tranquil Spaces - Quiet places? J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 123(3), 1446-1457.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Pheasant., G. R. Watts. and K. V. Horoshenkov. (2009). Validation of a tranquillity rating prediction tool, J. ACTA Acustica United with Acustica. 95(6), 1024-1031.&lt;/ref&gt; The method involves the assessment of average daytime noise levels Lday (usually traffic noise) and the measurement of the percentage of natural and contextual features NCF contained within the visual scene. The latter includes the percentage area in the visual scene occupied by natural features in the landscape such as vegetation, water and geological features, e.g. exposed rock outcrops, and contextual features. These contextual elements include listed buildings, religious and historic buildings, landmarks, monuments and elements of the landscape, such as traditional farm buildings, that directly contribute to the visual context of the natural environment. Lastly, the equation includes moderating factors (MF) that can influence the perception of tranquillity in either a positive, or a negative way. 
	
TR = 9.68 + 0.041 NCF – 0.146 Lday + MF 		

These moderating factors are not expected to be large and because they are relatively difficult to quantify they are the subject of ongoing research. One potentially effective solution to improving tranquillity, is to mask traffic noise or distract attention with an attractive water sound. A previous experiment has demonstrated that water generated sounds have the potential to improve the perceived tranquillity of gardens blighted by noise.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Watts, R. J. Pheasant, K. V. Horoshenkov and L. Ragonesi. (2009). Measurement and subjective assessment of water generated sounds. Acta Acustica united with Acustica, 95, 1032-1039.&lt;/ref&gt;  A further study has demonstrated that litter has the potential to degrade an environment such that the tranquillity rating drops on average by one scale point.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Watts, R. J. Pheasant and K. V. Horoshenkov. Validation of tranquillity rating method, Proceedings of the Institute of Acoustics &amp; Belgium Acoustical Society, Noise in the Built Environment, Ghent, 29–30 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

This bi-modal relationship is supported by work recently carried out by SCANLab at the University of Sheffield, using [[fMRI]] neuro-imaging techniques.&lt;ref&gt;M.D.Hunter., S. B. Eickhoff., R. J. Pheasant., M. J. Douglas., G. R. Watts., T. F. D. Farrow., D. Hyland., J. Kang., I. D. Wilkinson., K. V. Horoshenkov and P. W. R. Woodruff. (2010). The state of tranquillity: Subjective perception is shaped by contextual modulation of auditory connectivity. NeuroImage 53(2), 611 – 18.&lt;/ref&gt; This study demonstrated for the first time the significant differences in effective connectivity between areas of the brain, namely the auditory cortex and the medial [[pre-frontal cortex]], under tranquil and non-tranquil conditions. Specifically the medial pre-frontal cortex receives significantly enhanced contributions from the [[auditory cortex]] when presented with a tranquil visual scene compared with non-tranquil visual stimuli.

===Mapping tranquillity===
[[Image:CPRE England tranquillity map.jpg|frame|right|2007 Tranquillity map of England. Green areas denote very tranquil areas, whereas red areas denote areas with much less tranquillity.]]

The first method of mapping tranquillity was developed by Simon Rendel of ASH Consulting for a [[Department of Transport]] study in 1991. This led to the production of a set of Tranquil Area maps covering England, produced by Rendel and ASH Consulting and published by the [[Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE)]] and the former [[Countryside Commission]].

In these maps ''tranquil areas'' were defined as ''places sufficiently far from the visual or noise intrusion of development or traffic to be considered unspoilt by urban influences''.

More sophisticated mapping techniques are now available following work by researchers at [[Northumbria University]], [[Newcastle University]], and [[Campaign to Protect Rural England|CPRE]].

Maps have been produced for the whole of [[England]] that show the tranquillity score of [[Ordnance Survey]] Grid derived 500mx500m squares. The tranquillity rating for these is based on 44 different factors that add to or detract from people’s feelings of tranquillity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.surrey.ac.uk/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/ENG/RESEARCH/CES/EVENTS/ABSTRACTSANDPPTS/MAPPING%20TRANQUILLITY%20ANDREW%20OLIVER%202007.PDF] Presentation given by Andrew Oliver on Tranquillity to the University of Surrey, retrieved 2 Nov 2007&lt;/ref&gt; These factors were defined following extensive public consultations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpre.org.uk/filegrab/saving-tranquil-places-report.pdf?ref=2583 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013142009/https://www.cpre.org.uk/filegrab/saving-tranquil-places-report.pdf?ref=2583 |archivedate=2007-10-13 |df= }} ''Saving Tranquil Places'', CPRE report on Tranquillity, retrieved 2 Nov 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The new methodology uses advanced modelling techniques to look at the diffusion of the impact of these factors over distance, taking into account the terrain of the land. For example, the tranquillity increases gradually the further one is from a busy road, but increases more sharply if the road is hidden in a cutting.

The mapping process was developed by Northumbria and Newcastle Universities. The dark green areas represent those with the highest composite tranquillity score; dark red areas have the lowest composite tranquillity score (i.e., are least tranquil).

===Stimuli with positive impacts on tranquillity===
*a natural landscape, including woodland
*presence of rivers, streams, lakes or the sea
*birds and other wildlife
*wide open spaces
*clear open night sky with/without moon
*beach in a unique location
*open field,flora etc. with gentle to moderate wind flow

===Examples of stimuli having negative impacts on tranquillity===
*Motorised [[transport]]: [[car]]s, [[motorbikes|motorcycle]], [[train]]s and [[aircraft]] – and [[road]]s and [[railway]]s
*[[light pollution]]
*[[crowd|large numbers]] of people
*[[Electricity pylon|pylon]]s, [[electric power transmission|power line]]s, masts and [[wind turbine]]s
*[[Noise (sound)|noise]]

Note: This cartographic study showed that tranquillity is not the absence of all noise, activity and buildings. Indeed, it found that many rural activities, such as farming and hiking, and natural noises such as birdsong and cows lowing, enhance people’s experience of tranquillity.

'''Ulrich Beck''' (15 May 1944 – 1 January 2015) was a well known [[Germany|German]] [[sociologist]], and one of the most cited social scientists in the world during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;PDF at www.manuelcastells.info&lt;/ref&gt;  His work focused on questions of uncontrollability, [[Sociology of scientific ignorance|ignorance]] and [[uncertainty]] in the [[modernity|modern age]], and he coined the terms "[[risk society]]" and "[[second modernity]]" or "[[reflexive modernization]]". He also tried to overturn national perspectives that predominated in sociological investigations with a [[cosmopolitanism]] that acknowledges the interconnectedness of the [[modern history|modern world]]. He was a professor at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]] and also held appointments at the ''Fondation Maison des Sciences de l’Homme'' (FMSH) in Paris, and at the [[London School of Economics]].

==Life==
[[File:UlrichBeck.jpg|thumb|Ulrich Beck in his flat in Munich, 1999]]
Beck was born in the [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Pomeranian]] town of [[Stolp]], [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] (now Słupsk in [[Poland]]), in 1944, and grew up in [[Hanover]]. He began university studies with a focus on law at [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]], and from 1966 onwards studied [[sociology]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]] and [[political science]] at the University of Munich. Starting in 1972, after earning a [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]], he was employed at Munich as a sociologist. In 1979 he qualified as a university lecturer with a [[habilitation]] thesis. He received appointments as professor at the universities of [[University of Münster|Münster]] (1979–1981) and [[Otto-Friedrich-Universität Bamberg|Bamberg]] (1981–1992). From 1992 until his death, Beck was professor of sociology and director of the Institute for Sociology at the University of Munich. He received numerous international awards and honors, including election to the Council and Executive Board of the German Society for Sociology.

From 1995 to 1997 he was a member of the ''Kommission für Zukunftsfragen der Freistaaten Bayern und Sachsen'' ([[Bavaria]]n and [[Saxony|Saxon]] State Commission for Questions Concerning the Future). Beginning in 1999, he was the speaker of the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|DFG]] research programme on [[Reflexive modernization|reflexive modernity]].

From 1999 to 2009 Beck was a spokesman of the Collaborative Reflexive Modernization Research Centre 536, an interdisciplinary consortium of four universities in the Munich area funded and overseen by the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|German Research Foundation (DFG)]].&lt;ref&gt;Collaborative Reflexive Modetnization Research Centre 536&lt;/ref&gt; Beck's theory of interdisciplinary reflexive modernization on a basis of a wide range of topics in appropriate research was empirically tested. The theory of reflexive modernization works from the basic idea that the rise of the modern industrial age produces side-effects across the globe that provide the institutional basis and coordinates that modern nation-states question, modify, and open for political action.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Beck and Wolfgang Bonß (ed.): ''The modernization of modernity''. Suhrkamp, Frankfurt am Main 2001; Ulrich Beck and Christoph Lau (ed.): ''Delimitation and Decision''. Frankfurt 2004 special issue of the journal Social World: theory and empirical reflexive modernization, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

He was active as sociologist and public intellectual in Germany and throughout the world, regularly intervening in debates on the European Union, climate change and nuclear energy. At the time of his death, he and his international research group were only 1.5 years into the 5-year research project "Methodological Cosmopolitanism – in the Laboratory of Climate Change" (the Cosmo-Climate Research Project), of which Beck was the [[Principal investigator]]. For this research project he received the prestigious ERC Advanced Grant, scheduled to terminate in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://erc.europa.eu/methodological-cosmopolitanism-laboratory-climate-change&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Beck, sociologists David Tyfield and [[Anders Blok]] lead work packages within the overall project.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., http://www.soc.ku.dk/english/about/news/project_greening/&lt;/ref&gt; The project also fostered international research collaboration with various research 'hubs' in East Asia through the [[Europe-Asia Research Network (EARN)]].&lt;ref&gt;http://cosmostudies.com/east-asian-research-network/&lt;/ref&gt; In cooperation with EARN, Beck and sociologist Sang-Jin Han had been set to lead a 2-year project for the [[Seoul Metropolitan Government]] beginning in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://isa-global-dialogue.net/in-memory-of-professor-ulrich-beck-january-8-2015/&lt;/ref&gt;

Beck was a member of the Board of Trustees at the [[Ohel Jakob synagogue (Munich)|Jewish Center in Munich]] and a member of the German branch of [[PEN International]].

He was married to the German [[social scientist]] [[Elisabeth Beck-Gernsheim]]. He died of a cardiac infarction on 1 January 2015, at the age of 70.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jan/06/ulrich-beck Ulrich Beck obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research contributions==
For 25 years, Beck delivered new diagnoses to the following question: How can social and political thought and action in the face of radical global change (environmental destruction, financial crisis, global warming, the crisis of democracy and the nation-state institutions) be intertwined in a new modernity?&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Beck: ''World Risk Society''. Suhrkamp, Frankfurt am Main, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A radicalized modernity, for Beck, attacks its own foundations. Institutions such as the nation-state and the family are globalized 'from the inside'.

Beck studied [[modernization]], ecological problems, [[individual]]ization and [[globalization]]. Later in his career, he embarked on exploring the changing conditions of work in a world of increasing global [[capitalism]], declining influence of unions and flexibilisation of the labour process, a then new theory rooted in the concept of [[cosmopolitanism]]. Beck also contributed a number of new words to German and anglophone sociology, including "[[risk society]]", "[[second modernity]]", [[reflexive modernization]] and [[Brazilianization]] ([[Brasilianisierung]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} According to Beck, all contemporary political thinking emanates from the methodological nationalism of political thought and sociology (and other social sciences).&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Beck and Edgar Grande: Beyond methodological nationalism: Non-European and European variations of the second modernity, in: Social World 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Risk society}} Risk society was coined by Ulrich Beck and [[Anthony Giddens]] during the 1980s. According to Beck and Giddens, the traditional industrial class structure of modern society is breaking apart. Globalization creates risks that concern people from all different classes; for example, radioactivity, pollution, and even unemployment. Affluent households act to insulate themselves from these risks, but cannot do so for some; for example global environmental change. The poor suffer them. He points out that risks are also socially constructed and some risks are perceived as more dangerous because they are discussed in mass media more frequently, such as terrorism. Risk society leads to analysis of risks, causing prejudgment.&lt;ref&gt;See also: Joachim Möller, Achim Schmillen: ''Hohe Konzentration auf wenige – steigendes Risiko für alle'' (IAB-Kurzbericht 24/2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Beck was the editor of the sociological journal, ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Soziale Welt|de|vertical-align=sup}}'' (in German, since 1980), author of some 150 articles, and author or editor of many books.

==The Spinelli Group==

On 15 September 2010 Beck supported the [[European Parliament]]'s [[Spinelli Group]] initiative to reinvigorate [[federalism]] in the [[European Union]]. The [[Union of European Federalists]] and its youth organisation [[Young European Federalists]] have been promoting the idea of European federalism for over 60 years, with a "belief that only a European Federation, based on the idea of unity in diversity, could overcome the division of the European continent".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.federalists.eu/uef/history/|title=Union of European Federalists (UEF): History|website=www.federalists.eu|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent supporters of the initiative include [[Jacques Delors]], [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]], [[Guy Verhofstadt]], [[Andrew Duff]] and [[Elmar Brok]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

'''Verbal self-defense''', also known as '''verbal judo''' or '''verbal aikido''', is defined as using one's words to prevent, [[De-escalation|de-escalate]], or end an attempted assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Mattingly, Katy | title= Self-Defense: Steps to Survival |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dwOxP18guFgC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=%22Verbal+Self+Defense%22+define&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XpHw1X4Pkb&amp;sig=XLk0_MI60hCx443y8n-P1YjW9eE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rhloTOjbB9uUOJHS8LkF&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  |publisher = (via [[Google Books]]) | accessdate= July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a way of using words to maintain mental and emotional safety. This kind of "conflict management" involves using posture and body language, tone of voice, and choice of words as a means for calming a potentially volatile situation before it can manifest into physical violence. This often involves techniques such as taking a [[Child time-out|time-out]], deflecting the conversation to less argumentative topics, and/or redirecting the conversation to other individuals in the group who are less passionately involved.

==Overview==
Verbal self-defense experts have widely varying definitions of what it is and how it is applied. These include everything from a person simply saying no to someone else or repeatedly refusing a request to telling someone who has violated a personal boundary what he/she ought to know. It could even entail a more complicated scenario in which a person is called on to refuse to engage verbally with someone [[psychological manipulation|manipulative]], to set limits, and to end the conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Mattingly, Katy | title= Self-Defense: Steps to Survival |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dwOxP18guFgC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=%22Verbal+Self+Defense%22+define&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XpHw1X4Pkb&amp;sig=XLk0_MI60hCx443y8n-P1YjW9eE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rhloTOjbB9uUOJHS8LkF&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | publisher = (via [[Google Books]]) | accessdate= July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any definition it is always agreed that verbal self-defense is necessary as a means of enforcing [[personal boundaries]] and limits. Part of learning these skills includes learning how to identify communication triggers which cause a person to experience negative feelings and, in some cases, what those triggers represent with regards to what personal values the other person are violating.

The abusive types of communication that verbal self-defense is designed to acknowledge and deal with also vary greatly. This includes indirect forms of [[abuse]] such as  backhanded comments, and backstabbing or two-faced behaviors. As well, verbal self-defense is meant to address more commonly recognized forms of abuse such as yelling, belittling, and name calling. Going beyond verbal attacks, abusive behaviors also recognized in the field of verbal self-defense are aggressive posturing (taking a threatening posture or making a threatening gesture), physically interfering with personal belongings, and inappropriately intruding on one's personal space..

==Key components==
Most experts who write and publish articles and books on the subject of verbal self-defense identify several key elements to strong verbal self-defense skills.

* Being able to identify people, situations, and/or behaviors that induce hurtful feelings {{spaced ndash}}such as fear, inadequacy, and shame{{spaced ndash}}is important in order to know when a person needs to apply verbal tactics of defense.
* Controlling how a person responds to conflict, both mentally and emotionally, is key to applying verbal defense skills efficiently and appropriately.
* Having a general knowledge of what to say in advance offers a significant advantage for anyone using verbal self-defense. Some authors have even gone so far as to provide actual statements for people to use as a way to deal with verbally aggressive communicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Archer|first=Luke A|title=Verbal Aikido - Green Belt|year=2013|publisher=Createspace|location=USA|isbn=9781478198079|pages=101–106|url=http://www.verbal-aikido.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Authors and professional instructors offering seminars and workshops have differing views with regard to whether or not verbal self-defense is a form of "[[persuasion]]" and if "consequences" for the attacker should be considered a key component.

===Persuasion vs. self-defense===
In the field of verbal self-defense, the one element not entirely agreed upon is the concept that verbal defense tactics include the art of persuasion. Several authors clearly proclaim that verbal self-defense is designed as a means for persuading others; however, more recent books on the subject have denounced this commonly accepted fact.

The newer definition of verbal self-defense divides persuasion into a category of its own and states that verbal defense tactics should be more in line with the concept of physical self-defense. This idea, taken from ideologies of martial arts, puts forth the belief that verbal self-defense should only be used with respect to maintaining one's mental and emotional well-being. The position regarding self-protection in a verbal conflict and the further intention to protect the verbal assailant is posited in [[Verbal Aikido]], which aims at proposing a balanced or collaborative result wherein the attacker may save face.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Verbal Aikido: The art of directing verbal attacks to a balanced outcome |url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=h20TmwEACAAJ&amp;dq=1478198079 |accessdate=2013-06-11 |isbn=978-1-47819-807-9 |author1=Archer, Luke A. |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as a martial artist would not use skills against someone who was not threatening them, verbal self-defense artists should not consider their skills as a means of influencing others. The concern is that verbal self defense and "verbal manipulation" are not one and the same. Proponents of verbal self-defense as a way to influence and guide others, however, argue that skills of persuasion can be used as a way to ensure one's mental and emotional safety.

===Consequences===
The requirement for having a means to enforce "consequences" on people as a pre-requisite for effective verbal self-defense still remains questionable. Almost every author on the subject includes ways of handling non-physical aggression without having any repercussions for the attacker in the event the conflict is not solved amicably.

With specific regard to verbal self-defense in schools the concept of having consequences for bullying is considered by some to be key, where others are less focused on punishment and choose, instead, to put more emphasis on dealing with the aggressor in more positive ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Marcia Frid: I Like You, I Like Me, Too! |url=http://www.marciafrid.com/ |accessdate= July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this topic has only recently begun being addressed by experts in this field it remains to be seen to what degree the importance of consequences will have in handling interpersonal conflicts using verbal self-defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Verbal Defense Tactics: Cyber-Bullies Are Above the Law |url=http://verbaldefensetactics.com/2010/08/cyber-bullies-are-above-the-law/ |accessdate= July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common approaches==
Leading authors in the area of verbal self-defense and defensive communication styles offer several different techniques for defusing potentially volatile and/or abusive situations of conflict.

===Avoidance===
Being aware of situations that will likely lead to verbal conflict or abuse and making an effort to avoid them.

===Withdrawing===
Once engaged in an argument, situation of conflict, or when being verbally attacked, making an excuse and exiting the area.

===Deflecting===
Changing topic or focus on the interaction as a means of avoiding any disagreement or negative reaction on the part of the aggressor.

===Compromise===
Openly offering ideas and seeking ways to placate the attacker and/or their reasons for the abusive communication.

===Verbal Aikido===
A means of communication that is based on the aikido philosophy and martial way, created and propagated by [[Morihei Ueshiba]] during the 20th century. It is a style of [[conflict management]] and resolution that involves treating the 'attacker' as a partner rather than an adversary. The techniques practised by Aikidoists aim at restoring a balanced [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal dynamic]] and/or reaching a positive emotional result in an [[Conversation|exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;Pace &amp; Kyeli Smith [http://usualerror.com/e-book/verbal-aikido/] ''The usual error'' Ch.28 - Verbal Aikido (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a common teaching of this communication style, developed by Luke Archer,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verbal-aikido.com Verbal Aikdio website]&lt;/ref&gt; the approach is simplified into three steps:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verbal-aikido.com/articles-and-exercises/managing-conflict-with-the-three-steps/ Managing conflict with the Three Steps]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Receiving the attack with an 'Inner Smile'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verbal-aikido.com/articles-and-exercises/so-whats-this-inner-smile-about-anyway/ What's this Inner Smile about anyway?]&lt;/ref&gt; (a serene inner-confidence)
# Accompanying the attacker with verbal ''[[Irimi]]'' until destabilization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Archer|first=Luke A.|title=Verbal Aikido - The art of directing verbal attacks to a balanced outcome|year=2013|publisher=Createspace|location=USA|isbn=9781478198079|pages=35–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Proposing ''Ai-ki'' (an energy balance)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Archer|first=Luke A.|title=Verbal Aikido - The art of directing verbal attacks to a balanced outcome|year=2013|publisher=Createspace|location=USA|isbn=9781478198079|pages=53–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the methods and exercises taught in Verbal Aikido training, the practitioner works on developing a sense of [[self-control]], an [[assertive]] style of communication, and the practice of deliberate intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Archer|first=Luke A.|title=Verbal Aikido - The art of directing attacks to a balanced outcome (Green Belt)|year=2013|publisher=Createspace|location=USA|isbn=9781478198079|pages=3–4, 63–65|url=http://www.verbal-aikido.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Websites and news stories stating the rise in bullying in the workplace&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NoBullying: What is Workplace Bullying? |url=http://www.nobullying.com/what-is-workplace-bullying/| accessdate= April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on the playground&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NoBullying: Bullying Statistics |url=http://www.nobullying.com/bullying-statistics/|accessdate= April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; has led to a recent increase in awareness of the art of verbal self-defense. Considered a form of communication, verbal self-defense has become a sought after skill in schools and workplaces around the world as a way to counter this unhealthy trend.

Incidents of school and workplace shootings have put strong emphasis on being more aware of bullying, and consequently the need for a means to respond to such events have led to a growth in the field of verbal self-defense. Today, more and more individuals are presenting themselves as verbal self-defense experts and offering individual and corporate training, both on and off line, as a way to battle bullying at school, in the workplace and on the Internet.

===Workplace bullying===
{{Main|Workplace bullying}}
With the increased awareness of bullying in the workplace, it has become necessary for companies and organizations to ensure they meet the requirements of due diligence with regard to maintaining a safe work environment. U.S. and international laws have even gone so far as to recognize workplace bullying as its own form of harassment. Today, it is becoming common for businesses in almost every industry around the world to start providing their staff and employees with training designed to address and minimize the effects from incidents of workplace bullying.

===School bullying===
{{Main|School bullying}}
Since the school-shooting incident in Columbine there has been greater emphasis on stopping acts of school-yard bullying. Many educational institutions around the world have implemented anti-bullying campaigns with great success. In each of these campaigns it is common to find at least one of the anti-bullying tactics specifically addressing the need for victims of bullying to say something as a way to verbally defend themselves.

===Cyberbullying===
{{Main|Cyberbullying}}
In written form, verbal self-defense is meant to address concepts such as cyberbullying. This includes addressing hostile and hurtful messages posted on social networks such as [[Facebook]] and [[MySpace]], as well as in online forums and chat rooms. With ongoing investigations into teen [[bullycide]]s (a suicide caused as the result of depression from bullying, especially children) finding more than ever before the link directly to cyberbullying by classmates, the need of verbal self-defense skills for teens has led to a number of new books specifically addressing this subject.

==Influential contributors==
Several people are considered to be significant contributors to the field of verbal self-defense. These include people who were early pioneers to advocate for the importance of verbal defense skills, developers of new techniques for verbally defensive tactics, and internationally recognized and known trainers.

* [[Suzette Haden Elgin]] (1936–2015), the author of ''The Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense'', was one of the earliest writers to use the term. She states that verbal self-defense defends against the eight most common types of verbal violence, and redirect and defuse potential verbal confrontations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PqgT2Be70JwC&amp;dq=%22Verbal+Self+Defense%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wFbvfJPrXj&amp;sig=gSxpvuqUwfQJb3otRlKz6khYHnM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DCZoTOKVEo_LONyizLgF&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAzgK | publisher = (via [[Google Books]]) | accessdate= July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* George Thompson (1941–2011), author of ''Verbal Judo'', advanced the field of verbal self-defense by breaking down how to apply the techniques for de-escalation and defusing used by professionally trained police officers. He was one of the leading experts in verbal self-defense tactics and trained law-enforcement agencies around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Verbal Judo |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2jJemY_31AYC&amp;dq=%22Verbal+Judo%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Gl1tTIi8A4P0tgPLwbCkCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA | publisher = (via [[Google Books]]) | accessdate= July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Daniel Scott, author of ''Verbal Self Defense for The Workplace'', more recently combined self-defense concepts with the language patterns of neuro linguistic programming in order to develop a new form of verbal self-defense. His new six-step model for verbal self-defense includes all the main components necessary for people to defend themselves against bullies and aggressive people in the work place and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Verbal Self Defense for the Workplace |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=128qQwAACAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Dr+Daniel+Scott%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OHhoTOLIMt_U4wbh9KmZBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA | publisher = (via [[Google Books]]) | accessdate= July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Discrimination sidebar}}
Both adults and children who have some form of [[disability]] will experience acts of [[violence]] against them more often than those without disabilities. Children with disabilities are 3.7 times more likely to be affected by any sort of violence, 3.6 times more likely to be victims of physical violence, 2.9 times more likely to be victims of [[sexual violence]], and children with [[intellectual impairment]] are among the most vulnerable being 4.6 times more likely to experience sexual violence than their non-disabled peers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/disabilities/violence/en/|title=Violence against adults and children with disabilities|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|access-date=2018-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article published by the [[World Health Organization]] titled ''Prevalence and risk of violence against adults with disabilities: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies'' revealed that adults with any form of disability are 1.5 times more likely to experience some form of violence while adults with some form of mental impairment are 4 times more likely to experience violence than those without disabilities. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/disabilities/publications/violence_children_lancet.pdf?ua=1|title=Prevalence and risk of violence against adults with disabilities: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison Groups ==
As mentioned by Powers and Oschwald,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Powers|first1=Laurie|last2=Oschwald|first2=Mary|date=|title=Violence and abuse against people with disabilities: Experiences, barriers and prevention strategies.|url=http://nasuad.org/sites/nasuad/files/hcbs/files/53/2622/AbuseandViolenceBrief.pdf|publisher=[[Oregon Health &amp; Science University]] Center on Self-Determination}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are seven categories of abusive behavior defined by both male and female individuals who have some form of disability: physical abuse, sexual abuse, verbal or emotional abuse, neglect or withholding support, financial abuse, manipulation of medications, and destroying or disabling equipment. With the scope of abuse being clearly defined, we can begin building evidence and empirical data from the individual experiences to find and implement solutions where they are most effective.

=== Institutional vs. non-institutional ===
When comparing and contrasting Institutional and Non-Institutional cases of violence against people with disabilities, we find that 82% of violence against people who are disabled happens when they are Institutionalized. Common thought is that Institutions "inherently promote abuse and dehumanization."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cdrnys.org/blog/advocacy/the-unacknowledged-crisis-of-violence-against-disabled-people/|title=The Unacknowledged Crisis of Violence Against Disabled People|last=Morgan|first=Cameron|publisher=Center for Disability Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, Institutionalized cases are far more present than Non-Institutionalized cases, statistics show that sexual assault based violence is 7 times more probable among intellectually disabled people and that number jumps to 12 times more probable if that person is a woman compared to a non-disabled peer.

=== Disability type vs. age ===
Age plays a major factor when looking into non-institutionalized violence. Those who have some form of disability ranging from the ages of 12 to 15 experience violence at a rate of 144.1 out of 1000 persons compared to their non-disabled peers at a rate of 38.8 out of a thousand with a rate difference being 105.3.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/capd0915st.pdf|title=Crime Against Persons with Disabilities, 2009-2015 - Statistical Tables|last=Harrel|first=Erika|date=July 2017|publisher=
[[Bureau of Justice Statistics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disabled teens ranging from the ages of 16 to 19 experience violence at a rate of 86.6 out of 1000 persons compared to their non-disabled peers at the rate of 31.4 out of 1000 persons.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Examining the age ranges of 20 to 24, and 25 to 34 collectively to represent a persons twenties to mid thirties, the data shows that people with a some form of disability in that age range goes at a rate of 147.9 out of 1000 persons compared to 55.9 to their non-disabled peers with a rate difference of 92 out of 1000.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Disability type vs. gender ===
Examining statistics from ''Crime Against Persons with Disabilities''{{cn|date=December 2018}} table 5,{{clarify|the table must be here, you are not allowed to force readers to look elsewhere to make sense of this article|date=November 2018}} results highlight that females between the ages of 12 and higher experience slightly higher percentages of violence among the disabled community compared to males of the same age group except for ambulatory disabilities. The rate of violence committed against men with a cognitive disability is 55.4 while females are at 60.3 out of 1000.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ambulatory disability being the only category where men have a higher rate comes to 29.6 while females are at 29.3 with a difference of 0.3.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Visual impairment has a significant affect on the outcome of violence between the sexes as men are at a rate of 24.6 while females are 32.3 out of 1000 concluding a difference of 7.7.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lastly, table 8{{clarify|the table must be here, you are not allowed to force readers to look elsewhere to make sense of this article|date=November 2018}} displays a slight difference of 1.8 between the sexes with males at 15 while females are at 16.8.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Victim-offender relationship vs. disability status ===

Referencing ''Crime Against Persons with Disabilities''{{cn|date=December 2018}} table 8,{{clarify|the table must be here, you are not allowed to force readers to look elsewhere to make sense of this article|date=November 2018}} it is evident{{says who|date=November 2018}} that persons with disabilities are at risk of a higher rate of violence committed against them than their non-disabled peers. Additionally, according to the data, individuals who have some form of disability are at a higher risk of being victimized by a well-known or casual acquaintance over a complete stranger unlike their non-disabled peers; people whom have experienced an act of violence by a stranger with a disability being at 30.3% while non-disabled people are at 39.4% by a complete stranger.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A '''Waste broker''' is someone within the waste industry who acts as [[intermediary|middle man]] between other waste industry parties. They are required to be registered with the [[Environment Agency]].

==Waste Broker==
The client would typically have some [[rubbish]] (trash) to take away, and rather than ring round a few contractors in the area they ring the Waste Broker, and give them all the details of what they want. This Broker person or organisation will have a list of those contractors in the area, and it is they who will do the ringing round or emailing, to see who is available to do the client's pickup.

==Trade Broker (a type of Waste Broker)==
The client might be a producer of recycled materials, and want to sell them. They will contact a Trade Broker who performs a similar function.
Usually the Waste Broker is local or at most national, but the Trade Broker could be arranging shipments between countries.

As a component of the [[virtue]] of [[courage]], zest is defined as living life with a sense of excitement, anticipation, and energy. Approaching life as an adventure; such that one has “motivation in challenging situations or tasks”. Zest is essentially a concept of courage, and involves acquiring the motivation to complete challenging situations and tasks. Those who have zest exude [[enthusiasm]], excitement and energy while approaching tasks in life. Hence, the concept of zest involves performing tasks wholeheartedly, whilst also being adventurous, vivacious and energetic.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, C. R., &amp; Lopez, S. J. (2007). The Value of Wisdom and Courage. Positive psychology: the scientific and practical explorations of human strengths (p. 241). Thousand Oaks, Calif.: SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; It discourages the focus on the negative views of psychology. It embraces a notion that one must observe people that "live well" in order to truly understand positive psychology. (For example, a [[Buddhist]] monk would be a preferred subject of observation compared to a college student.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peterson |first=C. |year=2009 |title=Positive psychology |journal=Reclaiming Children and Youth |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=3–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zestful people simply enjoy things more than people low in zestfulness.&lt;ref name="SnyderLopez"&gt;{{cite book |last=Snyder |first=C. R. |last2=Lopez |first2=S. J. |title=Positive Psychology: The Scientific and Practical Explorations of Human Strengths |publisher=Sage |location=California |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zest is a positive trait reflecting a person’s approach to life with anticipation, energy, [[enthusiasm]] and excitement.&lt;ref name=Zest_and_Work&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/job.584| title = Zest and work| journal = Journal of Organizational Behavior| volume = 30| issue = 2| pages = 161–172| year = 2009| last1 = Peterson | first1 = C. | last2 = Park | first2 = N. | last3 = Hall | first3 = N. | last4 = Seligman | first4 = M. E. P. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Christopher Peterson]] and [[Martin Seligman]] developed terminology to describe human strengths. They developed a descriptive list of six human virtues (Wisdom and Knowledge, Courage, Humanity, Justice, Temperance, and Transcendence) comprising 24 strengths.  Zest is one of the four strengths that combine to make up the virtue of courage, as defined by this system.&lt;ref name="SnyderLopez" /&gt;

==Measurement==
The '''[[Values in Action Inventory of Strengths|VIA-IS]]''' is a self-report questionnaire that assesses the strength with which respondents answer strength-relevant statements about themselves on a 1-5 [[Likert scale]].  The following statements on the VIA-IS are used to measure a persons zest: I look forward to each new day; I cannot wait to get started on a project; I want to fully participate in life, not just view it from the sidelines.&lt;ref name=Zest_and_Work /&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2016}}

As with many other constructs in the relatively new field of Positive Psychology, it is difficult to [[Quantification (science)|quantify]] zest. Other traits like [[socioeconomic status]], which can easily be measured by [[gross income]] per household, or constructs like fear, which can be quantified by changes in [[heart rate]], [[skin conductance]], and [[pupil dilation]], have much more defined and widely accepted methods of measure. However, measurements of Zest are still in the beginning stages of development. How do we measure how energetic one person is compared to another? How do we determine exactly how excited a person is about life? What precisely does it mean to approach life adventurously? These are just a few of the questions that must be answered to most effectively research zest.

Relating to the problem of operationalizing zest, much of the research currently done on this and many of the 24 character strengths are done via self-report. A [[Self report study]] is one in which participants are simply asked to report their own feelings or thoughts. There are many problems in research associated with self-report. The most pertinent one being the validity and reliability of measures as they are completely subjective rather than objective. People can misrepresent themselves or misinterpret the questions posed to them.

Since such data is not the most scientifically convincing body of evidence upon which to rest scientific conclusions, Positive Psychological research is very focused on developing more objective measures for topics such as zest in order to help build a stronger science of [[organizational behavior]].&lt;ref name="WrightQuick2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/job.582| title = The emerging positive agenda in organizations: Greater than a trickle, but not yet a deluge| journal = Journal of Organizational Behavior| volume = 30| issue = 2| pages = 147–159| year = 2009| last1 = Wright | first1 = T. A. | last2 = Quick | first2 = J. C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
[[File:Skylab 2 Conrad in shower.jpg|thumb|NASA astronaut [[Pete Conrad]] taking a shower aboard the [[Skylab]] space station.]]
Zest can be promoted in the [[workplace]] so that workers can have a more positive approach in their life which indirectly can affect their anticipation, excitement, and energy in the workplace. Evidence from a present study that had 9803 employed adults respond to a survey on an internet site, measured zest, orientation to work as a calling, and [[job satisfaction|satisfaction]] to work and life in general. The survey showed that for many of the employees, work was a calling and a satisfaction. Employers can use such information to increase the [[productivity]] of their employees by taking zest into consideration. The study found that professionals had the highest zest, while clerical workers and homemakers were the least zestful. Professionals and homemakers viewed their job as a calling, while clerical workers were the least likely to do so. Clerical workers displayed one of the lowest levels of zest because in most instances they viewed their work as a career, a pedestal in the hopes of acquiring status and power to find a more suitable job for themselves in the future.&lt;ref name=Zest_and_Work /&gt; The results of this study follow trends observed by many other studies as well.&lt;ref name=Zest_and_Work /&gt;

Zest is speculated to be contagious just like many other strengths of character. Zest is obviously connected to, if not equal to group [[morale]] and can be a point of discussion for new studies from a positive organizational perspective with emphasis on zest.&lt;ref name=Zest_and_Work /&gt; Psychologists have learned about two main ways of promoting zest within workers: [[physical fitness]] and health set the tone for zest and it can be sustained through hope and [[optimism]].&lt;ref name=Zest_and_Work /&gt; Depression is a well-documented enemy of zest, and its toll on productivity and physical health is enormous. The prevention or reduction of depression among workers might pay the additional benefit of increasing their sense that work is a calling.&lt;ref name=Zest_and_Work /&gt;

Zest is also linked to psychological well-being which is crucial in a work organization. For instance, psychological well-being predicts improved [[job performance]], reduced [[absenteeism]] and reduced [[employee turnover]]. These are all benefits that can be explored more critically to make changes in the workplace.&lt;ref name=Zest_and_Work /&gt;

Increasing zestfulness is highly likely to increase the ability to be habitually happy.&lt;ref&gt;Wilner, J. (2012). Zest, Savoring and Happiness. Psych Central. Retrieved on March 21, 2013, from http://blogs.psychcentral.com/positive-psychology/2012/04/zest-savoring-and-happiness/&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of a 2009 study on 228 [[schoolteacher]] in Hong Kong indicated that zest was often associated with positive emotions as well as increased levels of life satisfaction in teachers. It is suggested that cultivating zest in school teachers could help combat teacher [[Occupational burnout|burnout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0742051X09000225|title = The hierarchy of strengths: their relationship with subjective well-being among Chinese teachers in Hong Kong|date = 2009|accessdate = April 1, 2015|journal = Teaching and Teacher Education|last = Chan|first = David W.|doi=10.1016/j.tate.2009.01.010|volume=25|issue = 6|pages=867–875}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, zest is said to be one character strength that coincides with healthy working behaviors such as ambition, creativity, persistence and leadership,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The good character at work: an initial study on the contribution of character strengths in identifying healthy and unhealthy work-related behavior and experience patterns|date = January 20, 2012|author = Gander|author2 = Proyer|author3 = Ruch|author4 = Wyss|last-author-amp = yes|pmid=22261976|doi=10.1007/s00420-012-0736-x|volume=85|issue=8|journal=Int Arch Occup Environ Health|pages=895–904|url = http://doc.rero.ch/record/312151/files/420_2012_Article_736.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrating that strengths-based interventions that cultivate zest can help improve work environments (see application for more information).It is also suggested that zest should be cultivated in the workplace in order to increase work satisfaction as well as general life satisfaction. The cultivation of zest may also decrease workplace burnout, which is the loss of productivity and enthusiasm for working.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/61871/584_ftp.pdf|title = Zest and Work|date = 2009|accessdate = April 1, 2015|website = Deepblue|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.|last = Peterson, Park, Hall, Seligman|first = Christopher, Nansook, Nicholas, Martin E.

==Positive youth development==
Zest, along with gratitude, hope, curiosity and love, are important aspects of positive psychology and key to positive character development. The adequate promotion of these characteristics not only in domestic life but also in schools and other educational environments is extremely important to positive youth development. Furthermore, through promotion of character strengths such as zest children tend to experience fewer psychological problems such as depression and anxiety disorders. In fact, research shows that zest, along with hope and leadership, is associated with fewer issues with anxiety and depression.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-007-4611-4_2#page-1|title = VIA Character Strengths: Research and Practice (The first 10 Years)|date = July 10, 2012|accessdate = April 6, 2015|website = springer.com|publisher = springer|author = Knoop|author2 = Niemic|last-author-amp = yes|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-4611-4_2|pages=11–29|isbn = 9789400746107 9789400746114}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the cultivation of zest can serve as a buffer against mental illness.

Youths with high levels of zest also tend to excel academically and lead happier, brighter lives. More emphasis needs to be placed on positive developing characteristics such as zest, gratitude, hope, curiosity and love in schooling environments and live in general so that youth successfully and positively develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Park|first=Nansook|title=Building Strengths of Character: Keys to Positive Youth Development|journal=Reclaiming Children and Youth|year=2009|volume=18|issue=2|pages=42–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life satisfaction and Zest ==
Zest has been found to be linked to higher levels of [[life satisfaction]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Testing Strengths-Based Interventions: A preliminary study on the effectiveness of a program targeting curiosity, gratitude, hope, humor, and zest for enhancing life satisfaction.|journal = Journal of Happiness Studies|date = March 16, 2012|author1 = Proyer|author2 = Ruch|author3 = Buschor|last-author-amp = yes|doi=10.1007/s10902-012-9331-9|volume=14|pages=275–292|citeseerx = 10.1.1.474.7083}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226476882|title = Character Strengths and Well Being: Are There Gender Differences?|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.academia.edu/1038647|title = Strengths of Character and Well Being|issue = 5|pages = 603–619|date = 2004|accessdate = April 6, 2015|journal = Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|volume = 23|author1 = Park|author2 = Peterson|author3 = Seligman|last-author-amp = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; among adults as well as youths.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Character Strengths: Research and Practice|journal = Journal of College and Character|date = April 4, 2009|author = Park|author2 = Peterson|last-author-amp = yes|doi=10.2202/1940-1639.1042|volume=10|issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies suggest that certain character strengths, including zest as well as [[curiosity]], [[gratitude]], hope, and [[humor]] are highly [[correlation|correlated]] with life satisfaction, whereas others strengths demonstrate low correlations with life satisfaction (appreciation of beauty and excellence, [[creativity]], kindness, love of learning and perspective) &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is suggested that zest is associated with higher life satisfaction because it is associated with living in the "here and now," which is also associated with life satisfaction. Furthermore, it is difficult to imagine zestful people who are often unhappy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Demographics ==
Certain character strengths, including zest, have been found to be more common among youths than adults. This possibly reflects the influence of social and cognitive maturation and certain needs during different developmental periods &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In yet another study that reaffirmed the idea that zest was one of the VIA character strengths that had a strong link to life satisfaction, another trend in zest was discovered. This study indicated slight gender differences in levels of zest. For women, life satisfaction was predicted by zest, gratitude, hope, appreciation of beauty and love, whereas men's life satisfaction was predicted by creativity, perspective, fairness and humor.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These findings go along with gender stereotypes and suggest that life satisfaction comes when one lives according to the strengths especially valued in one's culture.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

== Zest and mental state ==
There is evidence on the VIA-Youth subscale&lt;ref&gt;https://www.viacharacter.org/www/Portals/0/VIA%20Supplement-%20Using%20Youth%20Survey%20with%20Children%20with%20Intellectual%20Disabilities.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.viacharacter.org/www/Research/Psychometric-Data-VIA-Youth-Survey | title=VIA Youth Survey Character Psychometric Data: VIA Character}}&lt;/ref&gt; that zest is correlated with higher levels of [[neuroticism]] as well.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Levels of zest have been found to be linked with [[post-traumatic growth]], meaning that levels of zest increased with each traumatic event. This suggest that people may be more [[Psychological resilience|resilient]] than existing theories state, given the correlation between traumatic events and increases in character strengths such as zest &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/58571/20332_ftp.pdf|title = Strengths of Character and Posttraumatic Growth|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==
There are a few working ways to help individuals cultivate zest:

One method to cultivate zest is acting "as if,' which involves living a "faith-based" rather than an "evidenced-based" life. This means believing in things that there may not be much evidence for or proof of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.positive-living-now.com/increase-your-happiness-add-some-zest-to-your-life/|title = Increase your happiness: add some zest to your life|date = Jan 18, 2013|accessdate = April 7, 2015|website = Positive-Living-Now|publisher = Positive-Living-Now|last = Minarik|first = Susan K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, adopting strong body language may help, as well as "faking it until you make it" meaning acting as though one has an increased enthusiasm for life (more zest) until that increased enthusiasm is a reality (thus, an increase in zest is a reality) .

Another 2012 study demonstrated that groups that trained strengths (worked to cultivate these strengths) which are highly correlated with life satisfaction (including zest), had significant improvements in self-reported life satisfaction post-test (after training those strengths).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Zest can be an important characteristic to cultivate life satisfaction, thereby acting as a potential buffer against mental illness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
