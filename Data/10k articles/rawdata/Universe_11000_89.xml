'''Aerolíneas Argentinas Flight 644''' was a scheduled flight operated by the [[Douglas DC-6]], [[Aircraft registration|registration]] LV-ADW, on 19 July 1961 which was due to operate a domestic scheduled passenger service between [[Ministro Pistarini International Airport]] and [[General Enrique Mosconi International Airport]], but crashed {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of Pardo, [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], half an hour after [[takeoff]], owing to severe turbulence during climb out. This aircraft had been originally named 'Presidente Peron' but by 1956-57 had been renamed 'General San Martin'.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Allan publication Civil Aircraft Markings 1957&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ASN"&gt;{{ASN accident|id= 19610719-2|accessdate= 1 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Flight"&gt;{{cite journal|title= 1961 ACCIDENT RECORD|journal= [[Flight (magazine)|Flight]]|date= 28 September 1961|pages= 523|format= pdf|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1961/1961%20-%201419.html|accessdate= 5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some reports stated the aircraft was struck by [[lightning]].&lt;ref name="Flight"/&gt;

The manufacture of bungaroosh involved placing miscellaneous materials, such as whole or broken bricks, cobblestones, [[flint]]s (commonly found on the [[South Downs]] around Brighton), small pebbles, sand and pieces of wood into [[hydraulic lime]] and then pouring it between [[Formwork|shuttering]] until it has set.&lt;ref name="Context29"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Antram7"/&gt;  The shuttering (formwork) process typically involved erecting a wooden frame (often made out of [[Railroad tie|railway sleepers]] after they became readily available in the 19th century), pouring in the lime and adding solid materials to the mixture.  Other structural fittings, such as brick [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] or wooden [[Lintel (architecture)|lintel]]s, could then be added if more support was needed or other structures were to be added.&lt;ref name="Context29"/&gt;  This was particularly common in Brighton, where bungaroosh walls were often built behind the impressive [[stucco]]ed façades of [[Regency architecture|Regency-style houses]].&lt;ref name="Context29"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Antram7"/&gt; The material is particularly prevalent in the early 19th-century squares, crescents and terraces of Brighton's seafront,&lt;ref name="LewesCAA24"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lewes.gov.uk/Files/plan_CAA_Lewespages15to28.pdf |title=Lewes Conservation Area Character Appraisal |date=April 2007 |format=PDF |publisher=Lewes District Council |page=24 |accessdate=21 February 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EbY90nZA?url=http://www.lewes.gov.uk/Files/plan_CAA_Lewespages15to28.pdf |archivedate=21 February 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Regency Square, Brighton|Regency Square]], [[Royal Crescent, Brighton|Royal Crescent]] and the [[Kemp Town]] estate.  Another technique was to wait for the mixture to set, then render it with a lime-based mixture and paint it.  This produced a consistent, regular surface which could be used to build the symmetrical façades required in [[Georgian architecture|Georgian architecture -]] a popular style in Lewes.&lt;ref name="LewesCAA24"/&gt;

Although the material is solid once set, it has poor resistance to water.  If it dries out completely, it can crumble away; but if it gets wet it can dissolve and start to move, causing structural failure.  Regular drying-out and saturation caused by the effects of the weather has caused some [[Bay window|bay-window fronts]] to collapse in Brighton.&lt;ref name="Context29"/&gt;  A common maxim states that much of Brighton "could be demolished with a well-aimed hose"; the supposed extent of this destruction varies between "a third" and "half" depending on the source.&lt;ref name="Context29"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Antram7"/&gt;

The [[etymology]] of the first part of the word is the same as bungalow; late 17th century: from Hindi ''baṅglā'' ‘belonging to Bengal’. Second part is unknown, possibly a colloquialism.

[[File:Cfk heli slw.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Tail of a [[radio-controlled helicopter]], made of CFRP]]
'''Carbon fiber reinforced polymer''', '''carbon fiber reinforced plastic''', or '''carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic''' ('''CFRP''', '''CRP''', '''CFRTP''', or often simply '''carbon fiber''', '''carbon composite''', or even '''carbon'''), is an extremely strong and light [[fiber-reinforced plastic]] which contains [[carbon fibers]]. The alternative spelling 'fibre' is common in British Commonwealth countries. CFRPs can be expensive to produce but are commonly used wherever high [[strength-to-weight ratio]] and [[stiffness]] (rigidity) are required, such as aerospace, superstructure of ships, automotive, civil engineering, [[sports equipment]], and an increasing number of consumer and technical applications.

The binding [[polymer]] is often a [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset]] resin such as [[epoxy]], but other thermoset or [[thermoplastic]] polymers, such as [[polyester]], [[vinyl ester resin|vinyl ester]], or [[nylon]], are sometimes used. The [[composite material]] may contain [[aramid]] (e.g. [[Kevlar]], [[Twaron]]), [[ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene]] (UHMWPE), [[aluminium]], or [[glass fiber]]s in addition to carbon fibers. The properties of the final CFRP product can also be affected by the type of additives introduced to the binding matrix (resin). The most common additive is silica, but other additives such as rubber and [[carbon nanotube]]s can be used. The material is also referred to as ''graphite-reinforced polymer'' or ''graphite fiber-reinforced polymer'' (''GFRP'' is less common, as it clashes with glass-(fiber)-reinforced polymer).

==Properties==

CFRPs are [[composite material]]s. In this case the composite consists of two parts: a matrix and a reinforcement. In CFRP the reinforcement is carbon fiber, which provides the strength. The matrix is usually a polymer resin, such as epoxy, to bind the reinforcements together.&lt;ref&gt;Kopeliovich, Dmitri. [http://www.substech.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=carbon_fiber_reinforced_polymer_composites Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer Composites] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514092827/http://www.substech.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=carbon_fiber_reinforced_polymer_composites |date=14 May 2012}}. substech.com&lt;/ref&gt; Because CFRP consists of two distinct elements, the material properties depend on these two elements.

Reinforcement gives CFRP its strength and rigidity; measured by [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] and [[elastic modulus]] respectively. Unlike [[isotropy|isotropic]] materials like steel and aluminum, CFRP has directional strength properties. The properties of CFRP depend on the layouts of the carbon fiber and the proportion of the carbon fibers relative to the polymer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ornl.gov/~webworks/cpr/v823/rpt/106099.pdf Basic Properties of Reference Crossply Carbon-Fiber Composite] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619134226/http://www.ornl.gov/~webworks/cpr/v823/rpt/106099.pdf |date=19 June 2012}}. Oak Ridge National Laboratory (February 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; The two different equations governing the net elastic modulus of composite materials using the properties of the carbon fibers and the polymer matrix can also be applied to carbon fiber reinforced plastics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title= Mechanical Behavior of Materials|last= Courtney|first= Thomas|publisher= Waveland Press, Inc.|year= 2000|isbn= 1-57766-425-6|location= United States of America|pages= 247–249}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following equation,
:&lt;math&gt;E_c = V_mE_m + V_fE_f&lt;/math&gt;

is valid for composite materials with the fibers oriented in the direction of the applied load. &lt;math&gt;E_c&lt;/math&gt; is the total composite modulus, &lt;math&gt;V_m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_f&lt;/math&gt; are the volume fractions of the matrix and fiber respectively in the composite, and &lt;math&gt;E_m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_f&lt;/math&gt; are the elastic moduli of the matrix and fibers respectively.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The other extreme case of the elastic modulus of the composite with the fibers oriented transverse to the applied load can be found using the following equation:&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_c = \left( \frac{V_m}{E_m} + \frac{V_f}{E_f} \right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

The fracture toughness of carbon fiber reinforced plastics is governed by the following mechanisms: 1) debonding between the carbon fiber and polymer matrix, 2) fiber pull-out, and 3) delamination between the CFRP sheets.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Composite Materials |last=Chawla |first=Krishan |publisher=Springer |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-387-74364-6 |location=United States of America |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical epoxy-based CFRPs exhibit virtually no plasticity, with less than 0.5% strain to failure. Although CFRPs with epoxy have high strength and elastic modulus, the brittle fracture mechanics present unique challenges to engineers in failure detection since failure occurs catastrophically.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; As such, recent efforts to toughen CFRPs include modifying the existing epoxy material and finding alternative polymer matrix. One such material with high promise is [[polyether ether ketone|PEEK]], which exhibits an order of magnitude greater toughness with similar elastic modulus and tensile strength.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; However, PEEK is much more difficult to process and more expensive.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Despite its high initial strength-to-weight ratio, a design limitation of CFRP is its lack of a definable [[fatigue limit]]. This means, theoretically, that stress cycle failure cannot be ruled out. While steel and many other structural metals and alloys do have estimable fatigue or endurance limits, the complex failure modes of composites mean that the fatigue failure properties of CFRP are difficult to predict and design for. As a result, when using CFRP for critical cyclic-loading applications, engineers may need to design in considerable strength safety margins to provide suitable component reliability over its service life.

Environmental effects such as temperature and humidity can have profound effects on the polymer-based composites, including most CFRPs. While CFRPs demonstrate excellent corrosion resistance, the effect of moisture at wide ranges of temperatures can lead to degradation of the mechanical properties of CFRPs, particularly at the matrix-fiber interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Temperature effect during humid ageing on interfaces of glass and carbon fibers reinforced epoxy composites|journal= Journal of Colloid and Interface Science|date= 1 June 2006|pages= 111–117|volume= 298|issue= 1|doi= 10.1016/j.jcis.2005.12.023|pmid= 16386268|first= B. C.|last= Ray|bibcode= 2006JCIS..298..111R}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the carbon fibers themselves are not affected by the moisture diffusing into the material, the moisture plasticizes the polymer matrix.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; The epoxy matrix used for engine fan blades is designed to be impervious against jet fuel, lubrication, and rain water, and external paint on the composites parts is applied to minimize damage from ultraviolet light.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Multi-factorial models of a carbon fibre/epoxy composite subjected to accelerated environmental ageing|journal= Composite Structures|date= May 2014|pages= 179–192|volume= 111|doi= 10.1016/j.compstruct.2013.12.028|first1= Enrique|last1= Guzman|first2= Joël|last2= Cugnoni|first3= Thomas|last3= Gmür}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacture==
[[File:Steinbichler Shearography Honeycomb with CFRP Top Layer Artificial failures that simulate layer- core delaminations Material Top view.jpg|thumbnail|right|Carbon fiber reinforced polymer]]

The primary element of CFRP is a [[carbon fibers#Synthesis|carbon filament]]; this is produced from a precursor [[polymer]] such as [[polyacrylonitrile]] (PAN), [[rayon]], or petroleum [[pitch (resin)|pitch]]. For synthetic polymers such as PAN or rayon, the precursor is first [[spinning (polymers)|spun]] into filament yarns, using chemical and mechanical processes to initially align the polymer chains in a way to enhance the final physical properties of the completed carbon fiber. Precursor compositions and mechanical processes used during spinning filament yarns may vary among manufacturers. After drawing or spinning, the polymer filament yarns are then heated to drive off non-carbon atoms ([[carbonization]]), producing the final carbon fiber. The carbon fibers filament yarns may be further treated to improve handling qualities, then wound on to [[bobbin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zoltek.com/carbonfiber/how-is-it-made/ |title=How is it Made |publisher=Zoltek |accessdate=26 March 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319182214/http://www.zoltek.com/carbonfiber/how-is-it-made/ |archivedate=19 March 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From these fibers, a unidirectional sheet is created. These sheets are layered onto each other in a quasi-isotropic layup, e.g. 0°, +60°, or −60° relative to each other.

From the elementary fiber, a bidirectional woven sheet can be created, i.e. a [[twill]] with a 2/2 weave. The process by which most CFRPs are made varies, depending on the piece being created, the finish (outside gloss) required, and how many of the piece will be produced. In addition, the choice of matrix can have a profound effect on the properties of the finished composite.

Many CFRP parts are created with a single layer of carbon fabric that is backed with fiberglass. A tool called a chopper gun is used to quickly create these composite parts. Once a thin shell is created out of carbon fiber, the chopper gun cuts rolls of fiberglass into short lengths and sprays resin at the same time, so that the fiberglass and resin are mixed on the spot. The resin is either external mix, wherein the hardener and resin are sprayed separately, or internal mixed, which requires cleaning after every use.
Manufacturing methods may include the following:

===Molding===

One method of producing CFRP parts is by layering sheets of carbon fiber cloth into a [[molding (process)|mold]] in the shape of the final product. The alignment and weave of the cloth fibers is chosen to optimize the strength and stiffness properties of the resulting material. The mold is then filled with [[epoxy]] and is heated or air-cured. The resulting part is very corrosion-resistant, stiff, and strong for its weight. Parts used in less critical areas are manufactured by draping cloth over a mold, with epoxy either preimpregnated into the fibers (also known as ''[[pre-preg]]'') or "painted" over it. High-performance parts using single molds are often vacuum-bagged and/or [[autoclave (industrial)|autoclave]]-cured, because even small air bubbles in the material will reduce strength. An alternative to the autoclave method is to use internal pressure via inflatable air bladders or [[polystyrene|EPS foam]] inside the non-cured laid-up carbon fiber.

===Vacuum bagging===

For simple pieces of which relatively few copies are needed (1–2 per day), a [[vacuum bag]] can be used. A fiberglass, carbon fiber, or aluminum mold is polished and waxed, and has a [[release agent]] applied before the fabric and resin are applied, and the vacuum is pulled and set aside to allow the piece to cure (harden). There are three ways to apply the resin to the fabric in a vacuum mold.

The first method is manual and called a wet layup, where the two-part resin is mixed and applied before being laid in the mold and placed in the bag. The other one is done by infusion, where the dry fabric and mold are placed inside the bag while the vacuum pulls the resin through a small tube into the bag, then through a tube with holes or something similar to evenly spread the resin throughout the fabric. Wire loom works perfectly for a tube that requires holes inside the bag. Both of these methods of applying resin require hand work to spread the resin evenly for a glossy finish with very small pin-holes.

A third method of constructing composite materials is known as a dry layup. Here, the carbon fiber material is already impregnated with resin (pre-preg) and is applied to the mold in a similar fashion to adhesive film. The assembly is then placed in a vacuum to cure. The dry layup method has the least amount of resin waste and can achieve lighter constructions than wet layup. Also, because larger amounts of resin are more difficult to bleed out with wet layup methods, pre-preg parts generally have fewer pinholes. Pinhole elimination with minimal resin amounts generally require the use of [[autoclave (industrial)|autoclave]] pressures to purge the residual gases out.

===Compression molding===

A quicker method uses a [[compression molding|compression mold]]. This is a two-piece (male and female) mold usually made out of aluminum or steel that is pressed together with the fabric and resin between the two. The benefit is the speed of the entire process. Some car manufacturers, such as BMW, claimed to be able to cycle a new part every 80 seconds. However, this technique has a very high initial cost since the molds require CNC machining of very high precision.

===Filament winding===
For difficult or convoluted shapes, a [[filament winding|filament winder]] can be used to make CFRP parts by winding filaments around a mandrel or a core.

==Applications==
Applications for CFRP include the following:

Many aircraft that use CFRP have experienced delays with delivery dates due to the relatively new processes used to make CFRP components, whereas metallic structures have been studied and used on airframes for years, and the processes are relatively well understood. A recurrent problem is the monitoring of structural ageing, for which new methods are constantly investigated, due to the unusual multi-material and anisotropic nature of CFRP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/206768/files/EPFL_TH6422.pdf |first1=Enrique |last1=Guzman |first2=Thomas (dir.) |last2=Gmür |title=A Novel Structural Health Monitoring Method for Full-Scale CFRP Structures |publisher=EPFL PhD thesis |year=2014 |doi=10.5075/epfl-thesis-6422 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625152917/https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/206768/files/EPFL_TH6422.pdf |archivedate=2016-06-25 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968 a ''Hyfil'' carbon-fiber fan assembly was in service on the [[Rolls-Royce Conway]]s of the [[Vickers VC10]]s operated by [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%202107.html?search=rolls-royce%20rb211%20hyfil |title=Engines |journal=Flight International |date=26 September 1968 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814123711/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%202107.html?search=rolls-royce%20rb211%20hyfil |archivedate=14 August 2014 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specialist aircraft designers and manufacturers [[Scaled Composites]] have made extensive use of CFRP throughout their design range, including the first private manned spacecraft [[Spaceship One]]. CFRP is widely used in [[micro air vehicle]]s (MAVs) because of its high strength to weight ratio.

[[SpaceX]] is using carbon fiber for the entire primary structure of their new [[super heavy-lift launch vehicle]], the [[ITS launch vehicle]]—as well as the two very large [[spacecraft]] that will be launched by it, the ''[[Interplanetary Spaceship]]'' and the ''[[ITS tanker]]''. This is a particular issue for the large [[liquid oxygen]] tank structure due to design challenges of such dense carbon/oxygen contact for long periods of time.&lt;ref name=nsf20160927&gt;

CFRPs are extensively used in high-end automobile racing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Red Bull's How To Make An F1 Car Series Explains Carbon Fiber Use: Video|url=http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1087167_red-bulls-how-to-make-an-f1-car-series-explains-carbon-fiber-use-video|work=motorauthority|accessdate=11 October 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929162005/http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1087167_red-bulls-how-to-make-an-f1-car-series-explains-carbon-fiber-use-video|archivedate=29 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high cost of carbon fiber is mitigated by the material's unsurpassed strength-to-weight ratio, and low weight is essential for high-performance automobile racing. Race-car manufacturers have also developed methods to give carbon fiber pieces strength in a certain direction, making it strong in a load-bearing direction, but weak in directions where little or no load would be placed on the member. Conversely, manufacturers developed omnidirectional carbon fiber weaves that apply strength in all directions. This type of carbon fiber assembly is most widely used in the "safety cell" [[monocoque]] chassis assembly of high-performance race-cars.

Many [[supercar]]s over the past few decades have incorporated CFRP extensively in their manufacture, using it for their monocoque chassis as well as other components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/162582-bmw-i3-will-bmws-new-ev-finally-be-the-breakthrough-for-carbon-fiber-cars |work=Extreme Tech |title=BMW i3: Cheap, mass-produced carbon fiber cars finally come of age |first=Bill |last=Howard |date=30 July 2013 |accessdate=31 July 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150731091626/http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/162582-bmw-i3-will-bmws-new-ev-finally-be-the-breakthrough-for-carbon-fiber-cars |archivedate=31 July 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As far back as 1971, the [[Citroën SM]] offered optional lightweight carbon fiber wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jalopnik.com/michelin-made-carbon-fiber-wheels-for-citroen-back-in-1-1543922374 |title=Michelin Made Carbon Fiber Wheels For Citroën Back In 1971 |first=Máté |last=Petrány |work=Jalopnik |date=17 March 2014 |accessdate=31 July 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518103133/http://jalopnik.com/michelin-made-carbon-fiber-wheels-for-citroen-back-in-1-1543922374 |archivedate=18 May 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hemmings.com/hmn/stories/2007/04/01/hmn_feature23.html |title=Reinventing the Wheel Leave it to Citroën to bring the world's first resin wheels to market |first=David |last=L:aChance |work=Hemmings |date=April 2007 |accessdate=14 October 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906005508/http://www.hemmings.com/hmn/stories/2007/04/01/hmn_feature23.html |archivedate=6 September 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the material has been more readily adopted by low-volume manufacturers who used it primarily for creating body-panels for some of their high-end cars due to its increased strength and decreased weight compared with the [[glass-reinforced polymer]] they used for the majority of their products.

===Civil engineering===
{{Further|Fibre-reinforced plastic#Structural applications|l1=Structural applications of FRP}}
CFRP has become a notable material in [[structural engineering]] applications. Studied in an academic context as to its potential benefits in construction, it has also proved itself cost-effective in a number of field applications strengthening concrete, masonry, steel, cast iron, and timber structures. Its use in industry can be either for retrofitting to strengthen an existing structure or as an alternative reinforcing (or pre-stressing) material instead of steel from the outset of a project.

[[Retrofitting]] has become the increasingly dominant use of the material in civil engineering, and applications include increasing the load capacity of old structures (such as [[bridge]]s) that were designed to tolerate far lower service loads than they are experiencing today, seismic retrofitting, and repair of damaged structures. Retrofitting is popular in many instances as the cost of replacing the deficient structure can greatly exceed the cost of strengthening using CFRP.&lt;ref&gt;Ismail, N. [https://web.archive.org/web/20120425231749/http://www.najif.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/cfrp-paper.pdf "Strengthening of bridges using CFRP composites."] najif.net.&lt;/ref&gt;

Applied to reinforced concrete structures for flexure, CFRP typically has a large impact on strength (doubling or more the strength of the section is not uncommon), but only a moderate increase in stiffness (perhaps a 10% increase). This is because the material used in this application is typically very strong (e.g., 3000 MPa ultimate [[tensile strength]], more than 10 times mild steel) but not particularly stiff (150 to 250 GPa, a little less than steel, is typical). As a consequence, only small cross-sectional areas of the material are used. Small areas of very high strength but moderate stiffness material will significantly increase strength, but not stiffness.

CFRP can also be applied to enhance shear strength of reinforced concrete by wrapping fabrics or fibers around the section to be strengthened. Wrapping around sections (such as bridge or building columns) can also enhance the ductility of the section, greatly increasing the resistance to collapse under earthquake loading. Such 'seismic retrofit' is the major application in earthquake-prone areas, since it is much more economic than alternative methods.

If a column is circular (or nearly so) an increase in axial capacity is also achieved by wrapping. In this application, the confinement of the CFRP wrap enhances the compressive strength of the concrete. However, although large increases are achieved in the ultimate collapse load, the concrete will crack at only slightly enhanced load, meaning that this application is only occasionally used. Specialist ultra-high modulus CFRP (with tensile modulus of 420 GPa or more) is one of the few practical methods of strengthening cast-iron beams. In typical use, it is bonded to the tensile flange of the section, both increasing the stiffness of the section and lowering the [[neutral axis]], thus greatly reducing the maximum tensile stress in the cast iron.

In the United States, pre-stressed concrete cylinder pipes (PCCP) account for a vast majority of water transmission mains. Due to their large diameters, failures of PCCP are usually catastrophic and affect large populations. Approximately {{convert|19000|mi}} of PCCP have been installed between 1940 and 2006. Corrosion in the form of hydrogen embrittlement has been blamed for the gradual deterioration of the pre-stressing wires in many PCCP lines. Over the past decade, CFRPs have been utilized to internally line PCCP, resulting in a fully structural strengthening system. Inside a PCCP line, the CFRP liner acts as a barrier that controls the level of strain experienced by the steel cylinder in the host pipe. The composite liner enables the steel cylinder to perform within its elastic range, to ensure the pipeline's long-term performance is maintained. CFRP liner designs are based on strain compatibility between the liner and host pipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rahman |first=S. |date=November 2008 |title=Don't Stress Over Prestressed Concrete Cylinder Pipe Failures |journal=Opflow Magazine |pages=10–15 |url=http://www.awwa.org/publications/opflow/abstract/articleid/18373.aspx|volume=34|issue=11|deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402142138/http://www.awwa.org/publications/opflow/abstract/articleid/18373.aspx |archive-date=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CFRP is a more costly material than its counterparts in the construction industry, glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) and aramid fiber-reinforced polymer (AFRP), though CFRP is, in general, regarded as having superior properties. Much research continues to be done on using CFRP both for retrofitting and as an alternative to steel as a reinforcing or pre-stressing material. Cost remains an issue and long-term durability questions still remain. Some are concerned about the brittle nature of CFRP, in contrast to the ductility of steel. Though design codes have been drawn up by institutions such as the American Concrete Institute, there remains some hesitation among the engineering community about implementing these alternative materials. In part, this is due to a lack of standardization and the proprietary nature of the fiber and resin combinations on the market.

===Carbon-fiber microelectrodes===

Carbon fibers are used for fabrication of carbon-fiber [[microelectrode]]s. In this application typically a single carbon fiber with diameter of 5–7 μm is sealed in a glass capillary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pike|first=Carolyn M.|author2=Grabner, Chad P. |author3=Harkins, Amy B. |title=Fabrication of Amperometric Electrodes|journal=Journal of Visualized Experiments|date=4 May 2009|issue=27|doi=10.3791/1040|pmc=2762914}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the tip the capillary is either sealed with epoxy and polished to make carbon-fiber disk microelectrode or the fiber is cut to a length of 75–150 μm to make carbon-fiber cylinder electrode. Carbon-fiber microelectrodes are used either in [[amperometry]] or [[fast-scan cyclic voltammetry]] for detection of biochemical signaling.

===Sports goods===
[[File:Carbon Fiber and Kevlar Canoe.jpg|thumb|A carbon-fiber and [[Kevlar]] canoe (Placid Boatworks Rapidfire at the [[Adirondack Canoe Classic]])]]

CFRP is now widely used in sports equipment such as in squash, tennis, and badminton racquets, [[sport kite]] spars, high quality arrow shafts, hockey sticks, fishing rods, [[surfboard]]s, high end swim fins, and rowing [[racing shell|shells]]. Amputee athletes such as [[Jonnie Peacock]] use carbon fiber blades for running. It is used as a shank plate in some [[basketball]] sneakers to keep the foot stable, usually running the length of the shoe just above the sole and left exposed in some areas, usually in the arch.

Controversially, in 2006, cricket bats with a thin carbon-fiber layer on the back were introduced and used in competitive matches by high-profile players including [[Ricky Ponting]] and [[Michael Hussey]]. The carbon fiber was claimed merely to increase the durability of the bats but was banned from all first-class matches by the [[International Cricket Council|ICC]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://netcomposites.com/news/2006/october/03/icc-and-kookaburra-agree-to-withdrawal-of-carbon-bat/|title=ICC and Kookaburra Agree to Withdrawal of Carbon Bat|publisher=NetComposites|date=19 February 2006|accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A CFRP [[bicycle frame]] weighs less than one of [[steel]], [[aluminum]], or [[titanium]] having the same strength. The type and orientation of the carbon-fiber weave can be designed to maximize stiffness in required directions. Frames can be tuned to address different riding styles: sprint events require stiffer frames while endurance events may require more flexible frames for rider comfort over longer periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lookcycle.com/en/technologies/carbon-technology/ |title=Carbon Technology |publisher=Look Cycle |access-date=30 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130050211/http://www.lookcycle.com/en/technologies/carbon-technology/ |archivedate=30 November 2016 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The variety of shapes it can be built into has further increased stiffness and also allowed [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] tube sections. CFRP [[Bicycle fork|forks]] including suspension fork crowns and steerers, [[bicycle handlebar|handlebars]], [[seatpost]]s, and [[crankset|crank arm]]s are becoming more common on medium as well as higher-priced bicycles. CFRP [[Bicycle wheel|rims]] remain expensive but their stability compared to aluminium reduces the need to re-true a wheel and the reduced mass reduces the [[moment of inertia]] of the wheel. CFRP spokes are rare and most carbon wheelsets retain traditional stainless steel spokes. CFRP also appears increasingly in other components such as derailleur parts, brake and shifter levers and bodies, cassette sprocket carriers, suspension linkages, disc brake rotors, pedals, shoe soles, and saddle rails. Although strong and light, impact, over-torquing, or improper installation of CFRP components has resulted in cracking and failures, which may be difficult or impossible to repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://bicycling.com/blogs/boulderreport/2012/01/16/the-perils-of-progress/ |title=The Perils of Progress |journal=Bicycling Magazine |accessdate=16 February 2013 |date=16 January 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123184259/http://bicycling.com/blogs/boulderreport/2012/01/16/the-perils-of-progress/ |archivedate=23 January 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bustedcarbon.com/ |title=Busted Carbon |accessdate=30 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130174553/http://www.bustedcarbon.com/ |archivedate=30 November 2016 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other applications===
The fire resistance of polymers and thermo-set composites is significantly improved if a thin layer of carbon fibers is moulded near the surface because a dense, compact layer of carbon fibers efficiently reflects heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Zhao, Z. |author2=Gou, J. |title=Improved fire retardancy of thermoset composites modified with carbon nanofibers|journal= Sci.

CFRP is also finding application in an increasing number of high-end products that require stiffness and low weight, these include:
*Musical instruments, including violin bows, guitar picks and pick-guards, drum shells, bagpipe chanters, and entire musical instruments such as [[Luis and Clark]]'s carbon fiber cellos, violas, and violins; and [[Blackbird Guitars]]' acoustic guitars and ukuleles; also audio components such as turntables and loudspeakers.
*Firearms use it to replace certain metal, wood, and fiberglass components but many of the internal parts are still limited to metal alloys as current reinforced plastics are unsuitable.
*High-performance drone bodies and other radio-controlled vehicle and aircraft components such as helicopter rotor blades.
*Lightweight poles such as: tripod legs, tent poles, fishing rods, billiards cues, walking sticks, and high-reach poles such as for window cleaning.
*Dentistry, carbon fiber posts are used in restoring root canal treated teeth.
*Railed train [[bogie]]s for passenger service. This reduces the weight by up to 50% compared to metal bogies, which contributes to energy savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/traction-rolling-stock/single-view/view/carbon-fibre-reinforced-plastic-bogies-on-test.html |title=Carbon fibre reinforced plastic bogies on test |work=Railway Gazette |date=7 August 2016 |access-date=9 August 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808152345/http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/traction-rolling-stock/single-view/view/carbon-fibre-reinforced-plastic-bogies-on-test.html |archivedate=8 August 2016 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disposal and recycling==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
CFRPs have a long service lifetime when protected from the sun. When it is time to decommission CFRPs, they cannot be melted down in air like many metals. When free of vinyl (PVC or [[polyvinyl chloride]]) and other halogenated polymers, CFRPs can be thermally decomposed via [[thermal depolymerization]] in an oxygen-free environment. This can be accomplished in a refinery in a one-step process. Capture and reuse of the carbon and monomers is then possible. CFRPs can also be milled or shredded at low temperature to reclaim the carbon fiber; however, this process shortens the fibers dramatically. Just as with [[downcycling|downcycled]] paper, the shortened fibers cause the recycled material to be weaker than the original material. There are still many industrial applications that do not need the strength of full-length carbon fiber reinforcement. For example, chopped reclaimed carbon fiber can be used in consumer electronics, such as laptops. It provides excellent reinforcement of the polymers used even if it lacks the strength-to-weight ratio of an aerospace component.

==Carbon nanotube reinforced polymer (CNRP)==

'''Castor wax''', also called [[hydrogenated]] [[castor oil]], is an opaque, white vegetable [[wax]].  It is produced by the [[hydrogenation]] of pure [[castor oil]] often in the presence of a [[nickel]] [[catalyst]] to increase the rate of reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.castoroil.in/castor/castor_seed/castor_oil/hco/hco_hydrogenated_castor_oil_castoroil.html|title=Hydrogenated castor oil|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hydrogenation of castor oil forms [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|saturated molecules]] of castor wax; this saturation is responsible for the hard, brittle and insoluble nature of the wax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/science/aqa/plantoilsanduses/vegoilsrev4.shtml|title=BBC - GCSE Bitesize: Double bonds and hydrogenation|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Castor wax is used in polishes, [[cosmetics]], electrical [[capacitors]], carbon paper, [[lubrication]] and coatings and greases where resistance to moisture, [[oils]] and [[petrochemical]] products is required. Castor wax is also useful in polyurethane coating formulation, as it contains three secondary hydroxyl groups. These coating compositions are useful as a top coat varnish for leather, wood and rubber.
Castor wax can also be added to beeswax for [[encaustic painting]].

==Properties==
* [[Melting point]] = 80 C
* [[Acid number]] = 2
* [[Saponification value]] = 179
* [[Iodine number]] = 4

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6460">{{short description|the part of a molecule responsible for its color}}
A '''chromophore''' is the part of a [[molecule]] responsible for its [[color]].&lt;ref&gt;[[IUPAC Gold Book]] [http://goldbook.iupac.org/C01076.html Chromophore]&lt;/ref&gt;
The color that is seen by our eyes is the one not [[Absorption (light)|absorbed]] within a certain [[wavelength]] spectrum of [[visible spectrum|visible light]]. The chromophore is a region in the molecule where the energy difference between two separate [[molecular orbitals]] falls within the range of the visible spectrum. Visible light that hits the chromophore can thus be absorbed by exciting an [[electron]] from its [[ground state]] into an [[excited state]].

In biological molecules that serve to capture or detect light energy, the chromophore is the [[Functional group|moiety]] that causes a [[conformational change]] of the molecule when hit by light.

[[File:Beta-Carotene conjugation.svg|thumb|400px| The eleven conjugated double bonds that form the chromophore of the molecule are highlighted in red.]]

== Conjugated pi-bond system chromophores ==
[[File:RetinalCisandTrans.svg|380px|right|thumb|'''Conjugated chromophore''' that straightens in response to a [[photon]] γ (light), of the correct wavelength: 11-cis-retinal becomes [[retinal|all-trans-retinal]]]]

In the [[Conjugated system|conjugated]] chromophores, the [[Molecular electron transition|electrons jump between energy levels]] that are extended [[pi bond|pi orbitals]], created by a series of alternating [[chemical bond|single and double bonds]], often in [[aromatic]] systems.  Common examples include [[retinal]] (used in the eye to detect light), various [[food coloring]]s, fabric [[dye]]s ([[azo compound]]s), [[pH indicator]]s, [[lycopene]], [[Carotene|β-carotene]], and [[anthocyanins]].  Various factors in a chromophore's structure go into determining at what wavelength region in a spectrum the chromophore will absorb.  Lengthening or extending a [[conjugated system]] with more unsaturated (multiple) bonds in a molecule will tend to shift absorption to longer wavelengths.  [[Woodward-Fieser rules]] can be used to approximate [[ultraviolet]]-visible maximum absorption wavelength in organic compounds with conjugated pi-bond systems.

Some of these are metal complex chromophores, which contain a metal in a [[coordination complex]] with ligands. Examples are [[chlorophyll]], which is used by plants for photosynthesis and [[hemoglobin]], the oxygen transporter in the blood of vertebrate anirnals.  In these two examples, a metal is complexed at the center of a [[tetrapyrrole]] [[macrocycle]] ring: the metal being iron in the [[heme group]] (iron in a [[porphyrin]] ring) of hemoglobin, or magnesium complexed in a [[chlorin]]-type ring in the case of chlorophyll.  The highly conjugated pi-bonding system of the macrocycle ring absorbs visible light.  The nature of the central metal can also influence the absorption spectrum of the metal-macrocycle complex or properties such as excited state lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Gouterman, M. (1978) Optical spectra and electronic structure of porphyrins and related rings. In Dolphin, D. (ed.) The porphyrins.  Academic Press, New York. Volume III, Part A, pp 1-165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scheer, H. (2006) An overview of chlorophylls and bacteriochlorophylls: biochemistry, biophysics, functions and applications. Advances in Photosynthesis and Respiration, vol 25, pp 1-26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shapley, P. (2012) Absorbing light with organic molecules. http://butane.chem.uiuc.edu/pshapley/GenChem2/B2/1.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The tetrapyrrole moiety in organic compounds which is not macrocyclic but still has a conjugated pi-bond system still acts as a chromophore.  Examples of such compounds include [[bilirubin]] and [[urobilin]], which exhibit a yellow color.

==Auxochrome==
An [[auxochrome]] is a functional group of atoms attached to the chromophore which modifies the ability of the chromophore to absorb light, altering the wavelength or intensity of the absorption.

==Halochromism==
[[Halochromism]] occurs when a substance changes color as the [[pH]] changes.  This is a property of [[pH indicator]]s, whose [[molecular structure]] changes upon certain changes in the surrounding pH.  This change in structure affects a chromophore in the pH indicator molecule.  For example, [[phenolphthalein]] is a pH indicator whose structure changes as pH changes as shown in the following table:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align: center;"
! Structure
| | [[File:Phenolphthalein-low-pH-2D-skeletal.svg|200px]] || [[File:Phenolphthalein-mid-pH-2D-skeletal.svg|200px]]
|-
! pH
|  0-8.2  ||  8.2-12
|-
! Conditions
|  acidic or near-neutral ||basic 
|-
! Color name
|  colorless || pink to [[fuchsia (color)|fuchsia]] 
|-
! Color
|   bgcolor="white" | ||  bgcolor="fuchsia" |
|-
|}

In a pH range of about 0-8, the molecule has three [[aromatic ring]]s all bonded to a [[tetrahedral]] sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; [[Orbital hybridization|hybridized]] [[carbon atom]] in the middle which does not make the π-bonding in the aromatic rings conjugate. Because of their limited extent, the aromatic rings only absorb light in the ultraviolet region, and so the compound appears colorless in the 0-8 pH range.  However, as the pH increases beyond 8.2, that central carbon becomes part of a double bond becoming sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybridized and leaving a p orbital to overlap with the π-bonding in the rings. This makes the three rings conjugate together to form an extended chromophore absorbing longer wavelength visible light to show a fuchsia color.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemguide.co.uk/analysis/uvvisible/theory.html#top UV-Visible Absorption Spectra]&lt;/ref&gt;  At pH ranges outside 0-12, other molecular structure changes result in other color changes; see [[Phenolphthalein]] for details.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8412">'''Mexican conifers''' extend mainly across the main mountain ranges [[Sierra Madre Oriental]], [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] and the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]]. Enclosed between these mountains there are dispersed groups of conifers in mid and high elevations valleys when rainfall conditions allow their growth. Mexican conifers grow in some places often associated with oaks.

The dry season is about 7–8 months. Most rainfall (80-95%) occurs from June to October (5 months) and for only four months in the north. Precipitation throughout the year is present only in a little portion of the Sierra Madre Oriental in the State of [[Veracruz]]. The greatest number of species belong to the ''[[Pinus]]'' [[genus]], including about 60 species and subspecies.

Mexican conifers growing in subtropical climates include [[Pinus chiapensis]], [[Pinus oocarpa]], and [[pinus tecunumanii]].

Mexican conifers in temperate-to-cool climates are as follow:

* [[Pinus ayacahuite]]
* [[Pinus cembroides]]
* [[Pinus durangensis]]
* [[Apache pine|Pinus engelmanii]]
* [[Pinus greggii]]
* [[Pinus hartwegii]]
* [[Pinus leiophylla]]
* [[Pinus lumholtzii]]
* [[Pinus devoniana]]
* [[Pinus montezumae]]
* [[Nelson's Pinyon|Pinus nelsonii]]
* [[Pinus oocarpa]] var. trifoliata
* [[Pinus patula]]
* [[Pinus pseudostrobus]]
* [[Pinus hartwegii]]
* [[Pinus rudis]]
* [[Pinus teocote]]
* [[Taxodium mucronatum]]
* [[Abies religiosa]]
* [[Cupressus lusitanica]]

Mexican conifers that grow in exclusively in cool climates are [[Pinus hartwegii]] and [[Pinus rudis]].

== Cultivation and uses ==
[[Image:Pinus devoniana 01.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Pinus devoniana at [[Hackfalls Arboretum]], New Zealand]]

Some of the trees are harvested locally for their wood, which is used mainly in boards, construction, [[rustic furniture]] and in [[paper]] production. [[Resin]] is extracted from some species. Some trees are esteemed for their seeds: Pinus nelsonii, Pinus maximartinezii, Pinus cembroides and Pinus orizabenzis.

Mexican conifers have been recently started to be introduced in different parts around the world, and their plantations are considered very important. The leading reason for that expansion is the good quality that their wood has for paper production, but they are also planted as ornamental due to their unique characteristics and as exotic plants. The main genera used with this purposes are pines, cypresses and firs and taxodiums.

In their natural environment, they grow from 30° to 14° North Latitude, at altitudes between 600 to 4300 meters above sea level. There are some advantages for their introduction in several places in different altitudes, latitudes and climates: The average rainfall in regions where they occur fluctuates between 380 to 2000 millimeters a year. Above 2400 meters' elevation, snowfall is usual. Moist conditions vary from a short season of rainfall in summer to a climate with rainfall throughout the year, and can develop from semiarid to very wet conditions. In general they can withstand dry summers and some of are drought tolerant in several degrees. They grow from subtropical to cool climates; the average temperature varies from 24&amp;nbsp;°C to 10&amp;nbsp;°C. Some are surprisingly hardy (Pinus hartweggi, Pinus rudis, Pinus ayacahuite, etc.), tolerating temperatures as low as -30&amp;nbsp;°C. These trees occur on very tilted slopes and plain valleys.

'''Mexican conifers from temperate and cool climates which are being cultivated in other countries for paper industry according to altitudinal, latitudinal and climatic characteristics:'''

''Near or on the [[Equator]] at high altitudes'':

Pinus leiophylla in [[Kenya]]. Pinus montezumae in Kenya. Pinus ayacahuite in Kenya, [[Tanzania]], Cupressus lusitanica in [[Colombia]] where it is used for creating [[windbreak]]s curtains in mountain slopes and fighting against soil erosion. Pinus greggi in Colombia. Pinus patula in [[Ecuador]] (3500 m), Colombia (3300 m), Kenya, Tanzania, [[Papua New Guinea]].

''In tropical latitudes at high altitudes'':

Pinus leiophylla in [[Malawi]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Zambia]]. Pinus montezumae in Malawi, Botswana and Zimbabwe. Pinus ayacahuite in [[Angola]]. Pinus greggi in Zimbabwe and [[Bolivia]]. Pinus patula in Bolivia, Zimbabwe, Angola, [[Hawaii]]. Cupressus lusitanica in Bolivia

'''Mexican conifers from temperate and cool climates and from mid and high altitudes that are being cultivated near sea level for paper industry''':

[[New Zealand]] has been a pioneer country in cultivating massively trees from high altitudes and tropical latitudes and it has proved that Mexican conifers can thrive in big extensions near sea level when temperature and rainfall conditions are favorable. Most of this species are fully naturalized. Mexican conifers planted in New Zealand are:

Cupressus lusitanica, Pinus ayacahuite, Pinus devoniana, Pinus patula, Pinus pseudostrobus,
Pinus montezumae

'''Mexican conifers that have been planted with forestation purposes at temperate latitudes at mid and low altitudes''':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rama.com.ar/rama_newasp/PaginasIngles/Especies.asp?itemMenu=6&amp;subitemMenu=12

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4349">The '''Ewald sphere''' is a geometric construction used in [[electron_crystallography|electron]], [[neutron_diffraction|neutron]], and [[X-ray crystallography]] which demonstrates the relationship between: 

:* the [[wavevector]] of the incident and diffracted x-ray beams, 
:* the [[bragg angle|diffraction angle]] for a given reflection, 
:* the [[reciprocal lattice]] of the [[crystal]] 

It was conceived by [[Paul Peter Ewald]], a German physicist and crystallographer. Ewald himself spoke of the '''sphere of reflection'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1107/S0567739469000155|title=Introduction to the dynamical theory of X-ray diffraction|year=1969|author=Ewald, P. P.|journal=Acta Crystallographica Section A|volume=25|issue=1|pages=103–108|bibcode = 1969AcCrA..25..103E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ewald's sphere can be used to find the [[Resolution (electron density)|maximum resolution]] available for a given x-ray wavelength  and the unit cell dimensions. It is often simplified to the two-dimensional "Ewald's circle" model or may be referred to as the Ewald sphere.

== Ewald Construction ==
[[image:Ewald Sphere.svg|right|250px|thumb|Ewald construction ]]

A [[crystal]] can be described as a [[lattice (group)|lattice]] of points of equal symmetry. The requirement for [[bragg diffraction|constructive interference]] in a diffraction experiment means that in momentum or [[reciprocal space]] the values of momentum transfer where constructive interference occurs also form a lattice (the [[reciprocal lattice]]). For example, the  reciprocal lattice of a [[Cubic crystal system|simple cubic]] real-space lattice is also a simple cubic structure. Another example, the reciprocal lattice of an FCC crystal real-space lattice is a BCC structure, and vice versa. The aim of the Ewald sphere is to determine which lattice planes (represented by the grid points on the reciprocal lattice) will result in a diffracted signal for a given wavelength, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, of incident radiation. 

The incident plane wave falling on the crystal has a wave vector '''&lt;math&gt;K_i&lt;/math&gt;''' whose length is &lt;math&gt;2\pi/\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. The diffracted plane wave has a wave vector '''&lt;math&gt;K_f&lt;/math&gt;'''. If no energy is gained or lost in the diffraction process (it is  elastic) then '''&lt;math&gt;K_f&lt;/math&gt;''' has the same length as '''&lt;math&gt;K_i&lt;/math&gt;'''. The difference between the wave-vectors of diffracted and incident wave is defined as scattering vector '''&lt;math&gt;\Delta{K}=K_f-K_i&lt;/math&gt;'''. Since '''&lt;math&gt;K_i&lt;/math&gt;''' and '''&lt;math&gt;K_f&lt;/math&gt;''' have the same length the scattering vector must lie on the surface of a sphere of radius &lt;math&gt;2\pi/\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. This sphere is called the Ewald sphere.

The reciprocal lattice points are the values of momentum transfer where the [[bragg diffraction| Bragg diffraction condition]] is satisfied and for diffraction to occur the scattering vector must be equal to a reciprocal lattice vector. Geometrically this means that if the origin of reciprocal space is placed at the tip of  '''&lt;math&gt;K_i&lt;/math&gt;''' then diffraction will occur only  for reciprocal lattice points that lie on the surface of the Ewald sphere.

==Applications==
===Small scattering-angle limit===
When the wavelength of the radiation to be scattered is much smaller than the spacing between atoms, the Ewald sphere radius becomes large compared to the spatial frequency of atomic planes.  This is common, for example, in [[transmission electron microscopy]].  In this approximation, diffraction patterns in effect illuminate planar slices through the origin of a crystal's [[reciprocal lattice]].  However, it is important to note that while the Ewald sphere may be quite flat, a diffraction pattern taken perfectly aligned down a zone axis (high-symmetry direction) contains precisely zero  spots that exactly satisfy the Bragg condition. As one tilts a single crystal with respect to the incident beam, diffraction spots wink on and off as the Ewald sphere cuts through one zero order [[Laue zone]] (ZOLZ) after another.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1324">'''Freighting''' refers to the hauling of [[cargo]], historically, using a [[dog]] team to [[mushing|mush]] goods cross-country. During the [[Gold rush#North America|North American gold rushes]], such as the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], dogs were valuable [[draft animal]]s, going where [[horse]]s could not and withstanding harsher [[weather]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wm9dCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT148|title=The Draft Dog - Past and Present|last=Lavigne|first=Guillaume de|date=2015-03-18|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc|year=|isbn=9781326218447|location=|pages=148|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dog teams were commonly used for [[transportation]] and in [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] were used to [[Mail delivery by animal|deliver the mail]] during the winter. Large teams of sturdy dogs were required to haul the heavy loads. With the advent of [[air mail]] in the 1920s, mail delivery by dog team became outmoded, and gradually the mail runs became fewer until the last regular mail freighting route in Canada was shut down in the 1960s and in 1963 in the United States.

The dog sport of [[weight pulling]] is a modern adaptation of freighting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Haematein.png|thumb|[[Haematein]].]]

'''Haematoxylin''' [[American and British English spelling differences#ae and oe|or]] '''hematoxylin''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|h|iː|m|ə|ˈ|t|ɒ|k|s|ᵻ|l|ᵻ|n}}), also called '''natural black 1''' or '''C.I. 75290''', is a [[chemical compound|compound]] extracted from the [[wood#Heartwood and sapwood|heartwood]] of the logwood tree (''[[Haematoxylum campechianum]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Cooksey 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Haematoxylin and [[eosin]] together make up [[H&amp;E stain|haematoxylin and eosin stain]], one of the most commonly used stains in [[histology]]. This type of stain is a permanent stain as opposed to temporary stains (e.g. iodine solution in KI). Another common stain is [[phosphotungstic acid haematoxylin]], a mix of haematoxylin with [[phosphotungstic acid]]. When [[Redox|oxidized]], it forms [[haematein]], a compound that forms strongly coloured complexes with certain metal ions, the most notable ones being Fe(III) and Al(III) salts. Metal-haematein complexes are used to [[staining (biology)|stain]] cell nuclei prior to examination under a [[microscope]]. Structures that stain with iron- or aluminium-haematein are often called [[basophilic]], even though the mechanism of the staining is different from that of staining with basic dyes.

In the early 1970s and in 2008, there were shortages of haematoxylin due to interruptions in its extraction from logwood. The price of the compound increased, affecting the cost of diagnostic [[histopathology]], and prompted a search for alternative nuclear stains.  Before the use of any alternatives became firmly established, haematoxylin returned to the market, though at a higher price, and resumed its place in histopathology.  Several synthetic dyes have been recommended as replacements, notably [[celestine blue]] (CI 51050), [[gallocyanine]] (CI 51030), [[gallein]] (CI 45445) and [[eriochrome cyanine R]] (also called chromoxane cyanine R and solochrome cyanine (CI 43820).  All four have Fe(III) as the [[mordant]]. An alternative is the aluminium complex of oxidized [[brazilin]], which differs from haematoxylin by only one hydroxyl group.

==Staining solutions==
[[File:H&amp;E Eby Loyola University Chicago.tif|thumb|left|Mouse skin showing hematoxylin (nuclear/purple) and eosin (cytosolic/pink).]]
These stains are commonly employed for histological studies. The [[mordant]]s used to demonstrate nuclear and cytoplasmic structures are [[alum]] and [[iron]], forming lakes or coloured complexes (dye-mordant-tissue complexes), the colour of which will depend on the salt used. Aluminium salt lakes are usually coloured blue-white, whereas ferric salt lakes are coloured blue-black.

===Aluminium solutions===
The three main alum haematoxylin solutions employed are Ehrlich's haematoxylin, Harris's haematoxylin, and Mayer's haematoxylin. The name ''haemalum'' is preferable to "haematoxylin" for these solutions because haematein, a product of oxidation of haematoxylin, is the compound that combines with aluminium ions to form the active dye-metal complex. Alum haematoxylin solutions impart to the nuclei of cells a light transparent red stain that rapidly turns blue on exposure to any neutral or alkaline liquid.

Alum or potassium aluminium sulfate used as the [[mordant]] usually dissociates in an alkaline solution, combining with [[hydroxide ion|OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]] of water to form insoluble aluminium hydroxide. In the presence of excess acid, aluminium hydroxide cannot be formed, thus causing failure of aluminium haematoxylin dye-lake to form, due to lack of OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Hence, acid solutions of alum haematoxylin become red. During staining, alum haematoxylin-stained sections are usually passed on to a neutral or alkaline solution (e.g., hard tap water or 1% ammonium hydroxide) in order to neutralize the acid and form an insoluble blue aluminium haematin complex. This procedure is known as ''blueing''. 

When tap water is not sufficiently alkaline, or is even acidic and is unsatisfactory for blueing haematoxylin, a tap water substitute consisting of 3.5&amp;nbsp;g NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and 20&amp;nbsp;g MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·7H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in one litre of water with thymol (to inhibit formation of moulds), is used to accelerate blueing of thin paraffin sections. Addition of a trace of any alkali to tap or distilled water also provides an effective blueing solution; a few drops of strong ammonium hydroxide or of saturated aqueous lithium carbonate, added immediately before use, are sufficient for a 400&amp;nbsp;ml staining dish full of water. Use of very cold water slows down the blueing process, whereas warming accelerates it. In fact, the use of water below 10&amp;nbsp;°C for blueing sections may even produce pink artifact discolorations in the tissue.

:''Not to be confused with the modern [[towboat]].''

A '''horse-drawn boat''' or '''tow-boat''' is a historic [[boat]] operating on a [[canal]], pulled by a [[horse]] walking beside the canal on a [[towpath]].

==United Kingdom==
The Romans are known to have used mules to haul boats on their waterways in the UK.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Donald|title=The Horse on the Cut|publisher=Patrick Stephens Ltd|location=Cambridge|year=1982|edition=First|pages=11|isbn=0-85059-514-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boat horses were the prime movers of the [[Industrial Revolution]], and they remained at work until the middle of the 20th century. A horse, towing a boat with a rope from the [[towpath]], could pull fifty times as much [[cargo]] as it could pull in a [[cart]] or [[wagon]] on roads. In the early days of the Canal Age, from about 1740, all boats and barges were towed by [[horse]], [[mule]], [[hinny]], [[pony]] or sometimes a pair of [[donkey]]s. Many of the surviving buildings and structures had been designed with horse power in mind. Horse-drawn boats were used well into the 1960s on UK canals for commercial transport, and are still used today by passenger trip boats and other pleasure traffic.

The [[Horseboating Society]] has the primary aims of preserving and promoting Horseboating on the [[canals of the United Kingdom]]. There are horseboat operators at [[Foxton, Leicestershire|Foxton]], [[Godalming]], [[Tiverton, Devon|Tiverton]], [[Ashton-under-Lyne]], [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]] and [[Llangollen]].

===NB ''Maria''===
[[Image:Maria Towline.jpg|right|thumb|Horseboat Maria on the [[Peak Forest Canal]]]]
''[[NB Maria|Maria]]'' is Britain's oldest surviving wooden [[narrowboat]], built in 1854 by Jinks Boatyard in [[Marple, Greater Manchester|Marple]], and was never converted to have an engine. From 1854 to 1897, ''Maria'' was used to carry railway [[track ballast]] for the [[Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway]]. She was then used as a maintenance boat until 1962, lay abandoned for nine years until being salvaged in 1972 and converted to a passenger boat in 1978. In 2000 she was restored to near original operating condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationalhistoricships.org.uk/index.cfm/event/getVessel/vref/358 |title=Narrowboat Maria, Certificate Number 358|work=Register of Historic Vessels|publisher=National Historic Ships Register|accessdate=2008-11-28}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Maria'' is currently owned by Ashton Packet Boat Company. She is sometimes loaned to the [[Horseboating Society]] and has taken part in several of their events, including British Waterways' "Coal and Cotton" event, celebrating the Leeds and Liverpool Canal's history of transporting coal from [[Leeds]] and [[Wigan]] to Liverpool, and taking [[cotton]] from Liverpool [[Dock (maritime)|docks]] to [[Leeds]].&lt;ref name="LDP1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2007/06/07/narrowboats-flotilla-head-for-special-mersey-rally-64375-19257536/|title=Narrowboats flotilla head for special Mersey rally|last=Anderson|first=Vicky |date=June 7, 2007 |work=Liverpool Daily Post|accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LE1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2007/06/07/hey-no-barging-there-at-the-back-100252-19257479/|title=Hey, no barging there at the back|last=Turner|first=Ben |date=June 7, 2007 |work=Liverpool Echo|accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 she was the first boat to have been [[Legging (canals)|legged]] through [[Standedge Tunnel]] in 60 years. A [[UK Government]] minister and a local [[Member of Parliament]] took turns at legging ''Maria'' through the highest, longest, and deepest canal tunnel in the UK.

Numerous [[genetic disorders]] are caused by errors in '''[[fatty acid]] [[metabolism]]'''. These disorders may be described as [[fatty oxidation disorder]]s or as a ''[[lipid storage disorder]]s'', and are any one of several [[inborn errors of metabolism]] that result from enzyme defects affecting the ability of the body to [[oxidize]] [[fatty acid]]s in order to produce energy within muscles, liver, and other [[cell (biology)|cell]] types.

Some of the more common fatty acid metabolism disorders are:

==Coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiencies==
* [[Very long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency]] (VLCAD) - [[Very long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase]]
* [[Long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency]] (LCHAD) - [[Long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A]]
* [[Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency]] (MCAD) - [[Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase]]
* [[Short-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency]] (SCAD) - [[Short-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase]]
* [[3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency]] (HADH) - [[3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase]]

==Other Coenzyme A enzyme deficiencies==
* [[2,4 Dienoyl-CoA reductase deficiency]] - [[2,4 Dienoyl-CoA reductase]]
* [[3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency]] - [[3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase]]
* [[Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency]] - [[Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase]]

==Carnitine related==
* [[Primary carnitine deficiency]] - [[SLC22A5]] (carnitine transporter)
* [[Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency]] - [[Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase]]
* [[Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I deficiency]] (CPT) - [[Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I]]

The '''National Oncologic Institute''' or '''ION''' ({{lang-es|Instituto Oncológico Nacional}}) is a specialized hospital for cancer treatment, located in [[Panama City]], [[Panama]]. Between August 2000 and March 2001, patients receiving radiation treatment for prostate cancer and cancer of the cervix received lethal doses of radiation, resulting in 8 fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1114_scr.pdf Investigation of an accidental Exposure of radiotherapy patients in Panama - International Atomic Energy Agency]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On 1936, President [[Juan Demóstenes Arosemena]] (a physician), conceived the creation of the National Radiologic Institute, an institution dedicated to treat cancer. The treatments were given on the [[Hospital Santo Tomas|Santo Tomas Hospital]] and on the former Panama Hospital.

On September 18, 1940, during the administration of President [[Augusto Samuel Boyd|Augusto Boyd]], the new facilities of the National Radiologic Institute were inaugurated, giving it its own building. The Institute was part of the [[Hospital Santo Tomas|Santo Tomas Hospital]]. This institute had 4 doctors, 3 nurses, and 40 beds. The treatments they had were [[radiotherapy]], implantation of [[Radium]] needles, injections of hydrogenated mustard and surgery.

The institute had a passive handling of cancer, because the treatment of cancer given at the time was to ease pain in patients.

On 1965, a more active role in the battle against cancer is started, when the latest advancements of the time are applied in the detection and treatment of this illness.

Later that year the National Radiologic Institute was renamed [[Juan Demóstenes Arosemena]] Cancerologic Center, as a recognition of the work of this physician and creator of the institution. A [[cobalt-60]] pump was acquired.

On 1980, the institution begins relations with the government of [[Japan]], that was interested on the treatment of cancer in [[Panama]], and by which a donation of medical and surgical equipment, including [[ultrasound]], [[X-rays]], and others are acquired.

On 1984, by law 11, the National Oncologic Institute (Instituto Oncologico Nacional) [[Juan Demóstenes Arosemena]] is created.

On June 3, 1999, the Panamanian Government, on President [[Ernesto Perez Balladares]] administration, gives buildings 242 and 254 of the former [[Gorgas Hospital]] to the Institute, and on July 23 the Institute moves to this location from the building on Justo Arosemena Avenue.

The Hospital has continued its growth and acquired new equipment, like a [[linear accelerator]], a new [[X-ray computed tomography|CT]] and opened its [[Intensive care unit|ICU]].

==Accident==
As in most radiotherapy departments, the one at ION uses a treatment planning system (TPS) to
calculate the resulting dose distributions and determine treatment times. The data for each shielding block should be entered into the TPS separately. The TPS allows a maximum of four shielding blocks per field to be taken into account when calculating treatment times and dose distributions. Shielding blocks are used to protect healthy tissue of patients undergoing radiotherapy at the Institute, as is the normal practice.

In order to satisfy the request of a radiation oncologist to include five blocks in the field, in August 2000 the method of digitizing shielding blocks was changed. It was found that it was possible to enter data into the TPS for multiple shielding blocks together as if they were a single block, thereby apparently overcoming the limitation of four blocks per field. As was found later, although the TPS accepted entry of the data for multiple shielding blocks as if they were a single block, at least one of the ways in which the data were entered the computer output indicated a treatment time substantially longer than it should have been. The result was that patients received a proportionately higher dose than that prescribed. The modified treatment protocol was used for 28 patients, who were treated between August 2000 and March 2001 for [[prostate cancer]] and [[cancer of the cervix]]. There were 8 deaths and 20 injuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1114_scr.pdf Investigation of an accidental Exposure of radiotherapy patients in Panama - International Atomic Energy Agency]&lt;/ref&gt;

The modified protocol was used without a verification test, i.e. a manual calculation of the treatment time for comparison with the computer calculated treatment time, or a simulation of treatment by irradiating a [[Imaging phantom|water phantom]] and measuring the dose delivered. In spite of the treatment times being about twice those required for correct treatment, the error went unnoticed. Some early symptoms of excessive exposure were noted in some of the irradiated patients. The seriousness, however, was not realized, with the consequence that the accidental exposure went unnoticed for a number of months. The continued emergence of these symptoms, however, eventually led to the accidental exposure being detected in March 2001.

In May 2001, the Government of Panama requested assistance under the terms of the [[Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency]]. In its response, the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] sent a team of five medical doctors and two physicists to Panama to perform a dosimetric and medical assessment of the accidental exposure and a medical evaluation of the affected patients’ prognosis and treatment. The team was complemented by a physicist from the [[Pan American Health Organization]] (PAHO), also at the request of the Government of Panama.

The accidental exposures at the ION in Panama were very serious. Many patients have suffered severe radiation effects due to excessive dose. Both [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] have increased significantly. 

The IAEA report was consistent with the report made by local investigators. It was found that the [[radiotherapy]] equipment was properly calibrated and worked properly. The error was on the data entry, using a protocol not validated to enter more shielding blocks, that resulted in increased dose in the treatment. Most of the exposed patients have died, some radiation related, others by means of their advanced cancer. The Government of [[Panama]] agreed to share urgently the conclusions of the report to help prevent similar accidents. The physicists of ION involved were taken to trial by the patients' families.

The '''Intertropical Convergence Zone''' ('''ITCZ'''), known by sailors as the '''[[doldrums]]''' or the '''calms''', is the area encircling Earth near the [[Equator]], where the northeast and southeast [[trade wind]]s converge.

The ITCZ was originally identified from the 1920s to the 1940s as the "Intertropical Front" ("ITF"), but after the recognition in the 1940s and the 1950s of the significance of [[convergence zone|wind field convergence]] in [[tropics|tropical]] weather production, the term ''ITCZ'' was then applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=[[Roger G. Barry|Barry, Roger Graham]]; [[Richard Chorley|Chorley, Richard J.]]|title=Atmosphere, weather, and climate|year=1992|oclc=249331900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bIw9AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Atmosphere,+weather,+and+climate&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;ct=result#PPR5,M1|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-07760-6|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When it lies near the Equator, it is called the '''near-equatorial trough'''.  Where the ITCZ is drawn into and merges with a [[monsoon]]al circulation, it is sometimes referred to as a [[monsoon trough]], a usage more common in Australia and parts of Asia. In the seamen's speech, the zone is referred to as the doldrums because of its erratic (monotonous)  weather patterns with stagnant calms and violent [[thunderstorm]]s.

The ITCZ appears as a band of clouds, usually thunderstorms, that encircle the globe near the Equator. In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], the [[trade winds]] move in a southwestward direction from the northeast, while in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], they move northwestward from the southeast. When the ITCZ is positioned north or south of the Equator, these directions change according to the [[Coriolis effect]] imparted by [[Earth's rotation]]. For instance, when the ITCZ is situated north of the Equator, the southeast trade wind changes to a southwest wind as it crosses the Equator. The ITCZ is formed by vertical motion largely appearing as [[convection|convective]] activity of thunderstorms driven by solar heating, which effectively draw air in; these are the trade winds.&lt;ref name="noaa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream//tropics/itcz.htm|work=JetStream - Online School for Weather| publisher=[[NOAA]]|date=2007-10-24|accessdate=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ITCZ is effectively a tracer of the ascending branch of the [[Hadley cell]] and is wet. The dry descending branch is the [[horse latitudes]].

The location of the ITCZ gradually varies with the seasons, roughly corresponding with the location of the thermal equator. As the heat capacity of the oceans is greater than air over land, migration is more prominent over land. Over the oceans, where the convergence zone is better defined, the seasonal cycle is more subtle, as the convection is constrained by the distribution of ocean temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Inter_Tropical_Convergence_Zone_(ITCZ)|title=Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) - SKYbrary Aviation Safety|website=www.skybrary.aero|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, a double ITCZ forms, with one located north and another south of the Equator, one of which is usually stronger than the other. When this occurs, a narrow ridge of high pressure forms between the two convergence zones.

==South Pacific convergence zone==
The [[South Pacific convergence zone]] (SPCZ) is a reverse-oriented, or west-northwest to east-southeast aligned, trough extending from the west Pacific warm pool southeastwards towards [[French Polynesia]]. It lies just south of the equator during the Southern Hemisphere warm season, but can be more extratropical in nature, especially east of the [[International Date Line]]. It is considered the largest and most important piece of the ITCZ, and has the least dependence upon heating from a nearby [[land mass]] during the summer than any other portion of the [[monsoon trough]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Linacre and B. Geerts. [http://www-das.uwyo.edu/~geerts/cwx/notes/chap12/spcz.html Movement of the South Pacific convergence zone] Retrieved on 2006-11-26.&lt;/ref&gt;  The southern ITCZ in the southeast Pacific and southern Atlantic, known as the SITCZ, occurs during the Southern Hemisphere fall between [[3rd parallel south|3°]] and [[10th parallel south|10° south]] of the equator east of the [[140th meridian west]] longitude during cool or neutral [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) patterns. When ENSO reaches its warm phase, otherwise known as El Niño, the tongue of lowered [[sea surface temperature]]s due to upwelling off the South American continent disappears, which causes this convergence zone to vanish as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Semyon A. Grodsky |author2=James A.

==Effects on weather==
[[Image:ITCZ january-july.png|thumb|right|The ITCZ moves further away from the equator during the Northern summer than the Southern one due to the North-heavy arrangement of the continents.]]
Variation in the location of the intertropical convergence zone drastically affects rainfall in many equatorial nations, resulting in the wet and dry seasons of the tropics rather than the cold and warm seasons of higher latitudes.  Longer term changes in the intertropical convergence zone can result in severe [[drought]]s or flooding in nearby areas.

In some cases, the ITCZ may become narrow, especially when it moves away from the equator; the ITCZ can then be interpreted as a [[Weather front|front]] along the leading edge of the equatorial air.&lt;ref&gt;Djurić, D: ''Weather Analysis''. Prentice Hall, 1994. {{ISBN|0-13-501149-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  There appears to be a 15 to 25-day cycle in thunderstorm activity along the ITCZ, which is roughly half the wavelength of the [[Madden–Julian oscillation]] (MJO).&lt;ref&gt;Patrick A. Harr. [http://www.onr.navy.mil/sci_tech/32/reports/docs/05/mmharr.pdf Tropical Cyclone Formation/Structure/Motion Studies.] [[Office of Naval Research]] Retrieved on 2006-11-26. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129132952/http://www.onr.navy.mil/sci_tech/32/reports/docs/05/mmharr.pdf |date=November 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the ITCZ the average winds are slight, unlike the zones north and south of the equator where the trade winds feed. Early sailors named this belt of calm ''the doldrums'' because of the inactivity and stagnation they found themselves in after days of no wind.  To find oneself becalmed in this region in a hot and muggy climate could mean death in an era when wind was the only effective way to propel ships across the ocean. Even today leisure and competitive sailors attempt to cross the zone as quickly as possible as the erratic weather and wind patterns may cause unexpected delays.

==Role in tropical cyclone formation==

[[Tropical cyclogenesis]] depends upon low-level [[vorticity]] as one of its six requirements, and the ITCZ fills this role as it is a zone of wind change and speed, otherwise known as horizontal [[wind shear]].  As the ITCZ migrates to tropical - subtropical latitudes and even beyond ([[Shandong]] province of the People's Republic of China) during the respective hemisphere's summer season, increasing [[Coriolis effect|Coriolis force]] makes the formation of [[tropical cyclone]]s within this zone more possible. Surges of higher pressure from high latitudes can enhance tropical disturbances along its axis.&lt;ref&gt;C.-P. Chang, J.E. Erickson, and K.M. Lau.

Part I: Synoptic Aspects.] Retrieved on 2007-04-26.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the north Atlantic and the northeastern Pacific oceans, [[tropical wave]]s move along the axis of the ITCZ causing an increase in thunderstorm activity, and under weak vertical wind shear, these clusters of thunderstorms can come.

==Hazards==
Thunderstorms along the Intertropical Convergence Zone played a role in the loss of [[Air France Flight 447]], which left [[Rio de Janeiro–Galeão International Airport]] on Sunday, May 31, 2009, at about 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. local time (6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] or 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) and had been expected to land at [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] near [[Paris]] on Monday, June 1, 2009, at 11:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. (5:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. EDT or 9:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. UTC)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/01/air-france-crash-air-turbulence "Q &amp; A Turbulences"] 1.June.2009 ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft crashed with no survivors while flying through a series of large ITCZ thunderstorms, and ice forming rapidly on airspeed sensors was the precipitating cause for a cascade of human errors which ultimately doomed the flight.

An '''ion''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|ɒ|n|,_|-|ə|n}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/ion "Ion"] entry in ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[atom]] or [[molecule]] that has a non-zero net [[electric charge|electrical charge]]. Since the charge of the electron (considered "negative" by convention) is equal and opposite to that of the proton (considered "positive" by convention), the net charge of an ion is non-zero due to its total number of [[electron]]s being unequal to its total number of [[proton]]s.  A [[cation]] is a positively charged ion, with fewer electrons than protons, while an [[anion]] is negatively charged, with more electrons than protons. Because of their opposite electric currents, cations and anions attract each other and readily form [[ionic compound]]s. 

Ions consisting of only a single atom are termed atomic or [[monatomic ion]]s, while two or more atoms form molecular ions or [[polyatomic ion]]s. In the case of physical ionization in a medium, such as a gas,  "ion pairs" are created by ion collisions, where each generated pair consists of a free electron and a positive ion.&lt;ref name = "knoll"&gt;{{cite book |first=Glenn F |last=Knoll |title=Radiation detection and measurement |edition=3rd |date=1999 |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |isbn=0-471-07338-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ions are also created by chemical interactions, such as the dissolution of a [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] in liquids, or by other means, such as passing a [[direct current]] through a conducting solution, dissolving an [[anode]] via [[ionization]].

== History of discovery ==
The word ''ion'' comes from the Greek word ἰόν, ''ion'', "going", the present participle of ἰέναι, ''ienai'', "to go". This term was introduced by English physicist and chemist [[Michael Faraday]] in 1834 for the then-unknown species that ''goes'' from one [[electrode]] to the other through an aqueous medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/faraday_michael.shtml | title=Michael Faraday (1791-1867) | publisher=[[BBC]] | location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ion | title=Online etymology dictionary | accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faraday did not know the nature of these species, but he knew that since metals dissolved into and entered a solution at one electrode and new metal came forth from a solution at the other electrode; that some kind of substance has moved through the solution in a current. This conveys matter from one place to the other.

Faraday also introduced the words ''anion'' for a negatively charged ion, and ''cation'' for a positively charged one. In Faraday's nomenclature, cations were named because they were attracted to the [[cathode]] in a galvanic device and anions were named due to their attraction to the [[anode]].

[[Svante Arrhenius]] put forth, in his 1884 dissertation, his explanation of the fact that solid crystalline salts [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociate]] into paired charged particles when dissolved, for which he would win the 1903 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1903/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1903|website=www.nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrhenius' explanation was that in forming a solution, the salt dissociates into Faraday's ions. Arrhenius proposed that ions formed even in the absence of an electric current.&lt;ref name="columbia"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Harris|editor1-first=William|editor2-last=Levey|editor2-first=Judith|title=The New Columbia Encyclopedia|date=1975|publisher=[[Columbia University]]|location=New York City|isbn=0-231035-721|page=155|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref  name="EncBrit"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=McHenry|editor1-first=Charles|title=The New Encyclopædia Britannica|date=1992|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]]|location=Chicago|isbn=085-229553-7|page=587|volume=1|edition=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SciBio"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Cillispie|editor1-first=Charles|title=Dictionary of Scientific Biography|date=1970|publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]]|location=New York City|isbn=0-684101-122|pages=296–302|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Ions in their gas-like state are highly reactive and will rapidly interact with ions of opposite charge to give neutral molecules or ionic salts. Ions are also produced in the liquid or solid state when salts interact with solvents (for example, water) to produce ''solvated ions'', which are more stable, for reasons involving a combination of [[energy]] and [[entropy]] changes as the ions move away from each other to interact with the liquid.  These stabilized species are more commonly found in the environment at low temperatures. A common example is the ions present in seawater, which are derived from dissolved salts.

As charged objects, ions are attracted to opposite electric charges (positive to negative, and vice versa) and repelled by like charges. When they move, their trajectories can be deflected by a [[magnetic field]].

Electrons, due to their smaller mass and thus larger space-filling properties as [[matter waves]], determine the size of atoms and molecules that possess any electrons at all. Thus, anions (negatively charged ions) are larger than the parent molecule or atom, as the excess electron(s) repel each other and add to the physical size of the ion, because its size is determined by its [[electron cloud]]. Cations are smaller than the corresponding parent atom or molecule due to the smaller size of the electron cloud. One particular cation (that of hydrogen) contains no electrons, and thus consists of a single proton - ''very much smaller'' than the parent hydrogen atom.

=== Anions and cations===
[[File:Ions.svg|thumb|upright=1.75|[[Hydrogen atom]] (center) contains a single [[proton]] and a single [[electron]].  Removal of the electron gives a cation (left), whereas addition of an electron gives an anion (right).  The hydrogen anion, with its loosely held two-electron cloud, has a larger radius than the neutral atom, which in turn is much larger than the bare proton of the [[cation]]. Hydrogen forms the only charge-+1 cation that has no electrons, but even cations that (unlike hydrogen) still retain one or more electrons are still smaller than the neutral atoms or molecules from which they are derived.]]
{{redirect2|Cation|Anion|the particle physics/quantum computing concept|Anyon|other uses|Ion (disambiguation)}}
Since the electric charge on a proton is equal in magnitude to the charge on an electron, the net electric charge on an ion is equal to the number of protons in the ion minus the number of electrons.

There are additional names used for ions with multiple charges.  For example, an ion with a −2 charge is known as a [[dianion]] and an ion with a +2 charge is known as a [[dication]].  A [[zwitterion]] is a neutral molecule with positive and negative charges at different locations within that molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/genchem/topicreview/bp/1biochem/amino2.html#zwitter | title =Amino Acids | author =''[[Purdue University]]'' | publisher =purdue.edu | date =November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cations and anions are measured by their [[ionic radius]] and they differ in relative size: "Cations are small, most of them less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; m (10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; cm) in radius. But most anions are large, as is the most common Earth anion, [[oxygen]]. From this fact it is apparent that most of the space of a [[crystal]] is occupied by the anion and that the cations fit into the spaces between them."&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Press]] &amp; Raymond Siever (1986) ''Earth'', 14th edition, page 63, [[W. H. Freeman and Company]] {{ISBN|0-7167-1743-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cation has radius less than 0.8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; m (0.8 Å) while an anion has radius greater than 1.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; m (1.3 Å).&lt;ref&gt;[[Linus Pauling]] (1960) {{Google books|L-1K9HmKmUUC&amp;PA544|Nature of the Chemical Bond|page=544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ions are ubiquitous in [[nature]] and are responsible for diverse phenomena from the luminescence of the Sun to the existence of the Earth's [[ionosphere]]. Atoms in their ionic state may have a different colour from neutral atoms, and thus light absorption by metal ions gives the colour of [[gemstone]]s. In both inorganic and organic chemistry (including biochemistry), the interaction of water and ions is extremely important; an example is the energy that drives breakdown of adenosine triphosphate ([[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]). The following sections describe contexts in which ions feature prominently; these are arranged in decreasing physical length-scale, from the astronomical to the microscopic.

== Related technology ==
Ions can be non-chemically prepared using various [[ion source]]s, usually involving high [[voltage]] or temperature.  These are used in a multitude of devices such as [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometers]], [[optical emission spectrometer]]s, [[particle accelerators]], [[Ion implantation|ion implanters]], and [[Ion thruster|ion engines]].

As reactive charged particles, they are also used in [[Air ioniser|air purification]] by disrupting microbes, and in household items such as [[smoke detector]]s.

As signalling and metabolism in organisms are controlled by a precise ionic gradient across [[cell membrane|membrane]]s, the disruption of this gradient contributes to cell death.  This is a common mechanism exploited by natural and artificial [[biocides]], including the [[ion channels]] [[gramicidin]] and [[amphotericin]] (a [[fungicide]]).

Inorganic dissolved ions are a component of [[total dissolved solids]], a widely-known indicator of [[water quality]].

===Detection of ionizing radiation===
[[File:Ion chamber operation.gif|thumb|right|300px|Schematic of an ion chamber, showing drift of ions. Electrons drift faster than positive ions due to their much smaller mass.&lt;ref name = "knoll"/&gt;]]
[[File:Electron avalanche.gif|thumbnail|300px|Avalanche effect between two electrodes. The original ionization event liberates one electron, and each subsequent collision liberates a further electron, so two electrons emerge from each collision: the ionizing electron and the liberated electron.]]
The ionizing effect of radiation on a gas is extensively used for the detection of radiation such as [[alpha particle|alpha]], [[beta particle|beta]], [[gamma ray|gamma]] and [[X-rays]]. The original ionization event in these instruments results in the formation of an "ion pair"; a positive ion and a free electron, by ion impact by the radiation on the gas molecules. The [[ionization chamber]] is the simplest of these detectors, and collects all the charges created by ''direct ionization'' within the gas through the application of an electric field.&lt;ref name = "knoll"/&gt;

The [[Geiger–Müller tube]] and the [[proportional counter]] both use a phenomenon known as a [[Townsend avalanche]] to multiply the effect of the original ionizing event by means of a cascade effect whereby the free electrons are given sufficient energy by the electric field to release further electrons by ion impact.

=== Notation ===

====Denoting the charged state====
[[File:Ions notation.svg|thumb|right|Equivalent notations for an [[iron]] atom (Fe) that lost two electrons, referred to as [[ferrous]].]]

When writing the [[chemical formula]] for an ion, its net charge is written in superscript immediately after the chemical structure for the molecule/atom.  The net charge is written with the magnitude ''before'' the sign; that is, a doubly charged cation is indicated as '''2+''' instead of '''+2'''.   However, the magnitude of the charge is omitted for singly charged molecules/atoms; for example, the [[sodium]] cation is indicated as Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and ''not'' Na&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt;.

An alternative (and acceptable) way of showing a molecule/atom with multiple charges is by drawing out the signs multiple times, this is often seen with transition metals.  Chemists sometimes circle the sign; this is merely ornamental and does not alter the chemical meaning.  All three representations of {{chem|Fe|2+}} shown in the figure, are thus equivalent.

[[File:Ions notation2.svg|thumb|Mixed Roman numerals and charge notations for the uranyl ion. The oxidation state of the metal is shown as superscripted Roman numerals, whereas the charge of the entire complex is shown by the angle symbol together with the magnitude and sign of the net charge.]]

Monatomic ions are sometimes also denoted with Roman numerals; for example, the {{chem|Fe|2+}} example seen above is occasionally referred to as Fe(II) or Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;.  The Roman numeral designates the ''formal [[oxidation state]]'' of an element, whereas the superscripted numerals denote the net charge.  The two notations are, therefore, exchangeable for monatomic ions, but the Roman numerals ''cannot'' be applied to polyatomic ions.  However, it is possible to mix the notations for the individual metal centre with a polyatomic complex, as shown by the uranyl ion example.

====Sub-classes====
If an ion contains [[unpaired electron]]s, it is called a ''[[radical (chemistry)|radical]]'' ion. Just like uncharged radicals, radical ions are very reactive.  Polyatomic ions containing oxygen, such as carbonate and sulfate, are called ''[[oxyanion]]s''.   Molecular ions that contain at least one carbon to hydrogen bond are called ''organic ions''.  If the charge in an organic ion is formally centred on a carbon, it is termed a ''[[carbocation]]'' (if positively charged) or ''[[carbanion]]'' (if negatively charged).

=== Formation ===
==== Formation of monatomic ions ====
Monatomic ions are formed by the gain or loss of electrons to the [[Valence electron|valence shell]] (the outer-most electron shell) in an atom. The inner shells of an atom are filled with electrons that are tightly bound to the positively charged [[atomic nucleus]], and so do not participate in this kind of chemical interaction. The process of gaining or losing electrons from a neutral atom or molecule is called ''ionization''.

Atoms can be ionized by bombardment with [[radiation]], but the more usual process of ionization encountered in [[chemistry]] is the transfer of electrons between atoms or molecules. This transfer is usually driven by the attaining of stable ("closed shell") electronic configurations. Atoms will gain or lose electrons depending on which action takes the least energy.

For example, a [[sodium]] atom, Na, has a single electron in its valence shell, surrounding 2 stable, filled inner shells of 2 and 8 electrons. Since these filled shells are very stable, a sodium atom tends to lose its extra electron and attain this stable configuration, becoming a sodium cation in the process

:Na → {{chem|Na|+}} + {{Subatomic particle|electron}}

On the other hand, a [[chlorine]] atom, Cl, has 7 electrons in its valence shell, which is one short of the stable, filled shell with 8 electrons. Thus, a chlorine atom tends to ''gain'' an extra electron and attain a stable 8-electron configuration, becoming a chloride anion in the process:

:Cl + {{Subatomic particle|electron}} → {{chem|Cl|-}}

This driving force is what causes sodium and chlorine to undergo a chemical reaction, wherein the "extra" electron is transferred from sodium to chlorine, forming sodium cations and chloride anions. Being oppositely charged, these cations and anions form [[ionic bond]]s and combine to form [[sodium chloride]], NaCl, more commonly known as table salt.

:{{chem|Na|+}} + {{chem|Cl|-}} → NaCl

==== Formation of polyatomic and molecular ions ====

Polyatomic and molecular ions are often formed by the gaining or losing of elemental ions such as a proton, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, in neutral molecules. For example, when [[ammonia]], NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, accepts a proton, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;—a process called [[protonation]]—it forms the [[ammonium]] ion, {{chem|NH|4|+}}. Ammonia and ammonium have the same number of electrons in essentially the same [[electron configuration|electronic configuration]], but ammonium has an extra proton that gives it a net positive charge.

Ammonia can also lose an electron to gain a positive charge, forming the ion {{chem|NH|3|•+}}. However, this ion is unstable, because it has an incomplete [[Valence electron|valence shell]] around the nitrogen atom, making it a very reactive [[radical (chemistry)|radical]] ion.

Due to the instability of radical ions, polyatomic and molecular ions are usually formed by gaining or losing elemental ions such as {{chem|H|+}}, rather than gaining or losing electrons. This allows the molecule to preserve its stable electronic configuration while acquiring an electrical charge.

==== Ionization potential ====
{{main article|Ionization potential}}
The [[energy]] required to detach an electron in its lowest energy state from an atom or molecule of a gas with less net electric charge is called the ''ionization potential'', or ''ionization energy''. The ''n''th ionization energy of an atom is the energy required to detach its ''n''th electron after the first ''n − 1'' electrons have already been detached.

Each successive ionization energy is markedly greater than the last. Particularly great increases occur after any given block of [[atomic orbital]]s is exhausted of electrons. For this reason, ions tend to form in ways that leave them with full orbital blocks. For example, sodium has one ''[[valence electron]]'' in its outermost shell, so in ionized form it is commonly found with one lost electron, as {{chem|Na|+}}. On the other side of the periodic table, chlorine has seven valence electrons, so in ionized form it is commonly found with one gained electron, as {{chem|Cl|-}}. Caesium has the lowest measured ionization energy of all the elements and helium has the greatest.&lt;ref name="lenntech.com"&gt;[http://www.lenntech.com/Periodic-chart-elements/ionization-energy.htm Chemical elements listed by ionization energy]. Lenntech.com&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the ionization energy of [[metals]] is much lower than the ionization energy of [[nonmetals]], which is why, in general, metals will lose electrons to form positively charged ions and nonmetals will gain electrons to form negatively charged ions.

===Ionic bonding===
{{main article|Ionic bond}}

''Ionic bonding'' is a kind of [[chemical bond]]ing that arises from the mutual attraction of oppositely charged ions. Ions of like charge repel each other, and ions of opposite charge attract each other. Therefore, ions do not usually exist on their own, but will bind with ions of opposite charge to form a [[crystal lattice]]. The resulting compound is called an ''ionic compound'', and is said to be held together by ''ionic bonding''. In ionic compounds there arise characteristic distances between ion neighbours from which the spatial extension and the [[ionic radius]] of individual ions may be derived.

The most common type of ionic bonding is seen in compounds of metals and nonmetals (except [[noble gas]]es, which rarely form chemical compounds). Metals are characterized by having a small number of electrons in excess of a stable, closed-shell electronic configuration. As such, they have the tendency to lose these extra electrons in order to attain a stable configuration. This property is known as ''[[electropositivity]]''. Non-metals, on the other hand, are characterized by having an electron configuration just a few electrons short of a stable configuration. As such, they have the tendency to gain more electrons in order to achieve a stable configuration. This tendency is known as ''[[electronegativity]]''. When a highly electropositive metal is combined with a highly electronegative nonmetal, the extra electrons from the metal atoms are transferred to the electron-deficient nonmetal atoms. This reaction produces metal cations and nonmetal anions, which are attracted to each other to form a ''[[salt (chemistry)|salt]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7857">An '''ionomer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|aɪ|ˈ|ɑː|n|ə|m|ər}}) (''[[wikt:iono-|iono-]]'' + ''[[wikt:-mer|-mer]]'') is a [[polymer]] composed of repeat units of both [[electric charge|electrically]] neutral repeating units and a [[ion]]ized units covalently bonded to the polymer backbone as [[pendant group]] [[Functional_group#moiety|moieties]].  Usually no more than 15 [[mole percent]] are ionized.  The ionized units are often carboxylic acid groups.

The classification of a polymer as an ionomer depends on the level of substitution of ionic groups as well as how the ionic groups are incorporated into the polymer structure. For example, [[polyelectrolyte]]s also have ionic groups covalently bonded to the polymer backbone, but have a much higher ionic group molar substitution level (usually greater than 80%); [[wikt:ionene|ionenes]] are polymers where ionic groups are part of the actual polymer backbone. These two classes of ionic-group-containing polymers have vastly different morphological and physical properties and are therefore not considered ionomers. 

Ionomers have unique physical properties including [[electrical conductivity]] and [[wikt:viscous|viscosity]]—increase in ionomer solution viscosity with increasing temperatures (see [[conducting polymer]]). Ionomers also have unique morphological properties as the non-polar polymer backbone is energetically incompatible with the polar ionic groups. As a result, the ionic groups in most ionomers will undergo [[microphase separation]] to form ionic-rich domains.

Commercial applications for ionomers include [[golf ball]] covers, [[semipermeable membrane]]s, sealing tape and [[thermoplastic elastomer]]s.  Common examples of ionomers include [[polystyrene sulfonate]], [[Nafion]] and [[Hycar]].

}}

==Synthesis==
Usually ionomer synthesis consists of two steps – the introduction of acid groups to the polymer backbone and the neutralization of some of the acid groups by a metal cation. In very rare cases, the groups introduced are already neutralized by a metal cation. The first step (introduction of acid groups) can be done in two ways; a neutral non-ionic monomer can be copolymerized with a monomer that contains pendant acid groups or acid groups can be added to a non-ionic polymer through post-reaction modifications. For example, ethylene-methacrylic acid and sulfonated perfluorocarbon (Nafion) are synthesized through copolymerization while polystyrene sulfonate is synthesized through post-reaction modifications.

In most cases, the acid form of the copolymer is synthesized (i.e. 100% of the carboxylic acid groups are neutralized by hydrogen cations) and the ionomer is formed through subsequent neutralization by the appropriate metal cation. The identity of the neutralizing metal cation has an effect on the physical properties of the ionomer; the most commonly used metal cations (at least in academic research) are zinc, sodium, and magnesium. Neutralization or ionomerization, can also be accomplished in two ways: the acid copolymer can be melt-mixed with a basic metal or neutralization can be achieved through solution processes. The former method is preferred commercially. However, as commercial manufacturers are reluctant to share their procedures, little is known about the exact conditions of the melt-mixing neutralization process other than that hydroxides are generally used to provide the metal cation. The latter solution neutralization process is generally used in academic settings. The acid copolymer is dissolved and a basic salt with the appropriate metal cation is added to this solution. Where dissolution of the acid copolymer is difficult, simply swelling the polymer in the solvent is sufficient, though dissolving is always preferred. Because basic salts are polar and are not soluble in the non-polar solvents used to dissolve most polymers, mixed solvents (e.g. 90:10 toluene/alcohol) are often used.

Neutralization level must be determined after an ionomer is synthesized as varying the neutralization level varies the morphological and physical properties of the ionomer. One method used to do this is to examine the peak heights of infrared vibrations of the acid form. However, there may be substantial error in determining peak height, especially since small amounts of water appear in the same wavenumber range. Titration of the acid groups is another method that can be used, though this is not possible in some systems.

[[File:1963 Jeep Pickup FL engine-R.jpg|thumb|right|1963 Jeep Tornado engine]]

The '''Jeep Tornado engine''' was the first post-World War II U.S.-designed mass-produced [[overhead cam]] (OHC) automobile engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i8-1AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Jeep+OHC+Tornado+engine+mass&amp;dq=Jeep+OHC+Tornado+engine+mass |title=Kaiser Jeep |journal=Ward's Automotive Yearbook - Volume 26 |page=137 |accessdate=22 December 2013 |year=1964 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|230.5|cuin|L|2|abbr=on}} [[straight-six]] was introduced in mid-year 1962, and replaced the [[Flathead engine|flathead]] 6-226 [[Willys Super Hurricane engine|Willys Super Hurricane]] that was in use since 1954.

The Tornado engine was also manufactured in [[Argentina]] by [[Industrias Kaiser Argentina]] (IKA)  from 1965 to 1973.

==History==
The development of a new engine for [[Kaiser Jeep]] for an entirely new vehicle began under Chief Engineer, A.C. "Sammy" Sampietro, in the late-1950s.&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.oramagazine.com/pastIssues/0806-issue/index.asp?article=oldiron |title=Back To The Future: The Strange Life of Jeep's OHC 230 |first=Jim |last=Allen |journal=Off-road Adventures |date=August 2006 |accessdate=22 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224093731/http://www.oramagazine.com/pastIssues/0806-issue/index.asp?article=oldiron |archivedate=24 December 2013 |authorlink=Jim Allen (4x4 writer) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sampietro worked under [[Donald Healey]] in Europe and focused on improving power output through better engine breathing.&lt;ref name="Allen"/&gt; The single overhead cam design was combined with hemispheric combustion chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ifsja.org/tech/motors/tornado.html |title=Tornado 230 CI Engine Information / History |first=Ben |last=Page |publisher=The International Full Size Jeep Association |accessdate=22 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mass production of the new engine began in 1962.

The Jeep Tornado engine was introduced in the [[Willys Jeep Wagon]] and [[Willys Jeep Truck|truck]] models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZpdUEVGU2toC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=Jeep+Tornado+OHC+engine |title=The Story of Jeep |first=Patrick R. |last=Foster |page=111 |publisher=KP Books |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-87349-735-0 |accessdate=22 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Six-cylinder versions built after May 3, 1962, received the 230 OHC "Tornado" engine, replacing the [[Willys Super Hurricane engine|226 L-head "Super Hurricane"]] I6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zTsAbTJB5RIC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=Jeep+Tornado+OHC+engine |page=111 |title=Jeep |first=Jim |last=Allen |publisher=Motorbooks International |year=2004 |isbn=9780760319796 |accessdate=22 December 2013 |authorlink=Jim Allen (4x4 writer)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was made the standard engine in the completely new [[Jeep Wagoneer]] station wagons (today called SUV) and [[Jeep Gladiator]] pickup trucks that began production in the fall 1962 for the 1963 model year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rUoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=Jeep+Tornado+OHC+engine |title=Meet the beautiful brute - Jeep Gladiator (advertisement) |journal=[[Life Magazine|Life]] |page=23 |date=30 November 1962 |volume=53 |issue=23 |accessdate=22 December 2013 |author1=Inc |first1=Time }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tornado was the only U.S.-built overhead-cam engine in production at that time. The new engine was designed for robust, heavy-duty performance with maximum efficiency. Its excellent fuel economy was proven in tests with the Tornado-OHC engine having the lowest specific fuel consumption of all production gasoline engines on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.fourwheeler.com/features/0801-4wd-1963-jeep-wagoneer/ |first=Patrick |last=Foster |title=1963 Jeep Wagoneer - Landmark Vehicle |journal=4-Wheel Drive &amp; Sport Utility |date=January 2008 |accessdate=22 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The Tornado, like most Jeep engines, was [[undersquare]] for better low-speed [[torque]]. It had a 3&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt; inch (84.93mm) bore with a 4&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; inch (111.1mm) stroke. The standard version had an 8.5:1 [[compression ratio]]. Output was {{convert|140|hp|kW|lk=in|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm and {{convert|210|lb·ft|N.m|lk=on|abbr=on}} of torque at 1750 rpm. A low-compression (7.5:1) version was also available, with {{convert|133|hp|kW|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm and {{convert|199|lb·ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque at 2400 rpm. It was a "high-efficiency" engine with a conservatively rated power output.&lt;ref name="autodriver"&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SCALAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Jeep+Tornado+OHC+engine&amp;dq=Jeep+Tornado+OHC+engine |page=23 |journal=Autodriver |year=1961 |title=Overhead Camshaft Design is Feature of New Willys 140 H.P. 6-cyl Engine |accessdate=22 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new engine's overhead camshaft design was only one of the advanced features offered for the first time in a U.S.-designed and mass-produced engine.&lt;ref name="autodriver"/&gt; The Tornado was a good engine; unfortunately, it was complex (by 1960s standards) and was discontinued in civilian vehicles in the U.S. in 1965. It continued to be used in military versions of the Jeep pickup, the M-715 and M-725, until 1969. These engines had block-mounted motor mounts, rather than the front cover mounts that were a cause of oil leaks on the civilian versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=X95PU39mzSMC&amp;pg=PA195&amp;lpg=PA195&amp;dq=1963-1967+230+%22Tornado%22+OHC+Six-+Cylinder+Applications: |page=195 |last=Allen |first=Jim |title=Jeep 4x4 Performance Handbook |edition=Second |year=2007 |publisher=Motorbooks/MBI |isbn=9780760326879 |accessdate=22 December 2013 |authorlink=Jim Allen (4x4 writer)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One unique feature of the design was that the [[camshaft]] only had six lobes. One lobe operated both the intake and exhaust valve for each cylinder. This made engineering cam profiles a bit more difficult than conventional two lobe per cylinder (one per valve) designs, but allowed the valves to be better arranged for the cross-flow head. Valves were directly opposite their respective ports, and ports were short with wide radius turns.

Road tests of the new Jeep Wagoneer by ''Car Life'' magazine described the OHC six as "commendably smooth and quiet."&lt;ref name="stuff-wagoneer"&gt;{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=1963-1992 Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer |date=29 August 2007 |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1963-1992-jeep-wagoneer-and-grand-wagoneer.htm |accessdate=22 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The engine accelerated the four-wheel-drive full-size station wagon (the SUV designation was not yet known) with an automatic transmission from [[0 to 60 mph]] in 15.9 seconds.&lt;ref name="stuff-wagoneer"/&gt; Their tests recorded {{convert|17|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} on the highway and {{convert|14.5|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} in the city, that "certainly demonstrates the remarkable efficiency of the OHC engine."&lt;ref name="stuff-wagoneer"/&gt;

==Production==
Production of this engine continued in [[Argentina]] by [[Industrias Kaiser Argentina]] (IKA) after 1965. The engine was used in a variety of Jeep vehicles and [[American Motors]] (AMC) passenger cars assembled under license.&lt;ref name="pictures"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldcarandtruckpictures.com/Argentina/Argentinajamc.html |title=Kaiser Industries in Argentina |publisher=oldcarandtruckpictures.com |accessdate=25 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The engine became best known for powering the [[IKA-Renault Torino]], their version of the AMC [[Rambler American]] having unique styled front body parts that was built in Argentina from 1966 to 1981. It achieved international success in the 1969 [[Nürburgring]] 84-hour endurance race when a Torino placed third due to penalty points after covering 334 laps, the most of all the racers (c.9450&amp;nbsp;km/5868&amp;nbsp;mi.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jalopnik.com/5827242/when-argentina-ruled-the-nurburgring |title=When Argentina ruled the Nürburgring |publisher=jalopnik |date=8 March 2011|first=Peter |last=Orosz |accessdate=22 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://touringcarracing.net/Races/1969%20Nurburgring%2084hrs.html |last=de Jong |first=Frank |title=1969 Nurburgring 84hrs|publisher=touringcarracing.net |accessdate=22 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The engine name was changed to "Torino" to match the car in 1973. It also received a major block and crankshaft refinement that year — seven main bearings instead of the original four. Industrias Kaiser Argentina was eventually bought out by [[Renault]], and in 1975, the "IKA" name was dropped and it became "Renault Argentina". The Torino, Jeeps, AMC cars, as well as the Tornado engine itself, continued to receive upgrades over the years.
Argentinian's Tornado engines raised up the power from 155 HP to 215 HP (street versions) and 250 HP to 350 HP (Racing versions). It was achieved by a new Cylinder head, which has improved the intake and exhaust ducts. Also adopted a new camshaft, a new exhaust manifold 3-1 / 3-1 type, two 2" diamenter exhaust pipes and 3 carburators Weber DCOE 45-45. 
The Torino and the Jeep Tornado engine continued production through 1973. It was marketed as the "Tornado Jet", and later as the "Tornado Interceptor", in AMC automobiles.&lt;ref name="pictures"/&gt; From 1976 to 1982 they were the only non-Renault–designed cars and engines built by the French company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.carfolio.com/specifications/models/car/?car=78507 |title=Renault Torino GR (1982 MY) |publisher=carfolio.com |accessdate=22 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The Jeep Tornado engine was used in the following vehicles:
* [[Willys Jeep Truck]] 1962-65
* [[Willys Jeep Wagon]] 1962-65
* [[Jeep Gladiator]] 1963-64
* [[Jeep Wagoneer]] 1963-64
* [[Kaiser Jeep M715]] 1963-69 (military only)

Born in [[Kouvola]], Finland, he studied at [[Sibelius Academy]] and [[Berklee College of Music]].&lt;ref name="bej"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feather|first1=Leonard|last2=Gitler|first2=Ira|title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=9780195320008|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B4EjDgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began playing professionally at the end of the 1950s. He played in a sextet led by [[Heikki Rosendahl]] during that time, and then studied flute performance at the [[Sibelius Academy]] and in the U.S. at the [[Berklee College of Music]].&lt;ref name="New Grove" /&gt; Moving back to Finland, he settled in [[Helsinki]] and began working both as a [[session musician]] and with [[jazz fusion|fusion]] groups. Later in the 1960s he formed a duo with [[Edward Vesala]], as well as in the group [[Eero Koivistoinen]] for four years. He played with [[Tasavallan Presidentti]] in their earlier days, including for their first, eponymous, album. He recorded with [[Thad Jones]] and [[Mel Lewis]] and with [[Heikki Sarmanto]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and his first album as a soloist, ''Etiquette'', was released in 1974.

In 1975, he became a member of the [[New Music Orchestra]], and worked with the [[Nordic All Stars]], [[Arild Andersen]], and [[Peter Brötzmann]] later in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="RCJE"/&gt; The 1980s saw him working with the [[UFO Big Band]], [[Jan Garbarek]], [[Charlie Mariano]], and others. He was granted a 15-year state grant from Finland in the mid-1980s. In 1983 he rejoined Tasavallan Presidentti, and has recorded and toured with them since. He led a touring quartet from 1990 to 1992 with [[Olli Ahvenlahti]], [[Heikki Virtanen]] and [[Reino Laine]]. Aaltonen and [[Heikki Sarmanto]] released a duo recording, ''Rise'', in 2001; in 2003 Aaltonen's trio album ''Mother Tongue'' won a Jazz-Emma in Finland. Aaltonen continues to teach at the annual [[Nilsiä]] Music Camp.

== Features ==
The KT88 fits a standard eight-pin [[Tube socket#Octal base|octal]] socket and has similar [[pinout]] and applications as the [[6L6]] and [[EL34]]. Specifically designed for audio amplification, the KT88 has similar ratings to the [[United States|American]] [[6550]] which was designed for use as a servo amplifier. It is one of the largest tubes in its class and can handle significantly higher plate [[voltage]]s than similar tubes, up to 800 [[volts]]. A KT88 [[Push–pull output|push-pull]] pair in class AB1 fixed bias is capable of 100 [[watt]]s of output with 2.5% total harmonic distortion or up to about 50W at low distortion in [[hi-fi]] applications. The transmitting tubes TT21 and TT22 have almost identical transfer characteristics to KT88 but a different pinout, and by virtue of their [[anode]] being connected to the top cap have a higher plate voltage rating (1.25 [[kilovolt]]) and a higher power output capability of 200 watts in class AB1 push–pull.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vintage-technology.info/pages/valves/geckt88.htm ''Vintage Technology, KT88''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[screen grid]] is sometimes tied to the anode so that it becomes effectively a [[triode]] with a lower maximum power output.

== History ==
The KT88 was introduced by GEC in 1956 as a larger variant of the [[KT66]]. It was manufactured in the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] by the MOV ([[Marconi-Osram Valve]]) subsidiary of [[The General Electric Company plc|G.E.C]], also labelled as IEC/Mullard, and, in the U.S., Genelex ''Gold Lion''.  

[[File:Kt88 power tubes in traynor yba200 amplifier.jpg|thumb|left|Four KT88s installed and powered.]]
As of 2018, KT88 valves are produced by Shuguang ([[China]]), [[JJ Electronic]] ([[Slovakia]]), [[Svetlana (company)|Svetlana]] ([[Russia]]), and [[New Sensor Corporation]] (Russia). [[New old stock|NOS]] examples in good condition are extremely rare. Due to its availability and characteristics, the KT88 is popular in [[hi-fi]] production amplifiers.

Historically, it has been far more popular with high fidelity stereo manufacturers than [[guitar]] amplifier builders, given its characteristics of high-power and low-distortion.  Due to these characteristics, it is regularly used to replace 6550 tubes by end users seeking a guitar amplifier tone with less distortion.  Some of the amplifiers which shipped with the KT88 power tube include the [[Hiwatt]] Custom 200 and 400 Bass Heads, Sound City L/B 200, 200 watt [[Marshall Major]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fliegler|first=Ritchie|title=Amps!: the other half of rock 'n' roll|year=1993|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=978-0-7935-2411-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NgG8bmBayLwC&amp;pg=PA15|author2=Jon F.

The work function relates to many surface phenomena, including [[Catalysis|catalytic activity]], reconstruction of surfaces, doping and band-bending of [[semiconductor]]s, charge trapping in [[dielectric]]s and [[corrosion]]. The map of the work function produced by KPFM gives information about the composition and electronic state of the local structures on the surface of a solid.

==Working principle==
KPFM is a scanning probe method where the [[Electric potential|potential]] offset between a probe tip and a surface can be measured using the same principle as a macroscopic Kelvin probe. The cantilever in the AFM is a [[reference electrode]] that forms a capacitor with the surface, over which it is scanned laterally at a constant separation. The cantilever is not piezoelectrically driven at its mechanical [[resonance]] frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; as in normal AFM although an alternating current (AC) voltage is applied at this frequency.

When there is a direct-current (DC) potential difference between the tip and the surface, the AC+DC voltage offset will cause the cantilever to vibrate. The origin of the force can be understood by considering that the energy of the capacitor formed by the cantilever and the surface is

:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{1}{2}C[V_{DC} + V_{AC}\sin(\omega_0 t)]^2 = \frac{1}{2}C[2V_{DC}V_{AC}\sin(\omega_0 t) - \frac{1}{2}V_{AC}^2 \cos(2\omega_0 t)]&lt;/math&gt;

plus terms at DC. Only the cross-term proportional to the ''V&lt;sub&gt;DC&lt;/sub&gt;·V&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt;'' product is at the resonance frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. The resulting vibration of the cantilever is detected using usual scanned-probe microscopy methods (typically involving a diode laser and a four-quadrant detector). A null circuit is used to drive the DC potential of the tip to a value which minimizes the vibration. A map of this nulling DC potential versus the lateral position coordinate therefore produces an image of the work function of the surface.

A related technique, [[electrostatic force microscope|electrostatic force microscopy]] (EFM), directly measures the force produced on a charged tip by the electric field emanating from the surface. EFM operates much like [[magnetic force microscope|magnetic force microscopy]] in that the frequency shift or amplitude change of the cantilever oscillation is used to detect the electric field. However, EFM is much more sensitive to topographic artifacts than KPFM. Both EFM and KPFM require the use of conductive cantilevers, typically metal-coated [[silicon]] or [[silicon nitride]].

==Work function==
The Kelvin probe force microscope or Kelvin force microscope (KFM) is based on an AFM set-up and the determination of the work function is based on the measurement of the electrostatic forces between the small AFM tip and the sample. The conducting tip and the sample are characterized by (in general) different work functions, which represent the difference between the [[Fermi level]] and the [[vacuum level]] for each material. If both elements were brought in contact, a net electric current would flow between them until the Fermi levels were aligned. The difference between the work functions is called the [[Volta potential|contact potential difference]] and is denoted generally with ''V&lt;sub&gt;CPD&lt;/sub&gt;''. An electrostatic force exists between tip and sample, because of the electric field between them. For the measurement a voltage is applied between tip and sample, consisting of a DC-bias ''V&lt;sub&gt;DC&lt;/sub&gt;'' and an AC-voltage ''V&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt; sin(ωt)'' of frequency ''ω''.

:&lt;math&gt;V = (V_{DC} - V_{CPD}) + V_{AC} \cdot \sin (\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

Tuning the AC-frequency to the [[resonant frequency]] of the AFM cantilever results in an improved sensitivity. The electrostatic force in a capacitor may be found by differentiating the energy function with respect to the separation of the elements and can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{1}{2} \frac{dC}{dz} V^2&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' is the capacitance, ''z'' is the separation, and ''V'' is the voltage, each between tip and surface. Substituting the previous formula for voltage (V) shows that the electrostatic force can be split up into three contributions, as the total electrostatic force ''F'' acting on the tip then has spectral components at the frequencies ''ω'' and ''2ω''.

:&lt;math&gt;F = F_{DC} + F_{\omega} + F_{2 \omega}&lt;/math&gt;

The DC component, ''F&lt;sub&gt;DC&lt;/sub&gt;'', contributes to the topographical signal, the term ''F&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;'' at the characteristic frequency ''ω'' is used to measure the contact potential and the contribution ''F&lt;sub&gt;2ω&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be used for capacitance microscopy.

:&lt;math&gt;F_{DC} = \frac{dC}{dz} \left[\frac{1}{2}(V_{DC} - V_{CPD})^2 + \frac{1}{4} V^2_{AC}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;F_{\omega} = \frac{dC}{dz} [V_{DC} - V_{CPD}] V_{AC} \sin(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;F_{2 \omega} = - \frac{1}{4} \frac{dC}{dz} V^2_{AC} \cos(2 \omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

==Contact potential measurements==
For contact potential measurements a [[lock-in amplifier]] is used to detect the cantilever oscillation at ''ω''. During the scan ''V&lt;sub&gt;DC&lt;/sub&gt;'' will be adjusted so that the electrostatic forces between the tip and the sample become zero and thus the response at the frequency ω becomes zero. Since the electrostatic force at ''ω'' depends on ''V&lt;sub&gt;DC&lt;/sub&gt; − V&lt;sub&gt;CPD&lt;/sub&gt;'', the value of ''V&lt;sub&gt;DC&lt;/sub&gt;'' that minimizes the ''ω''-term corresponds to the contact potential. Absolute values of the sample work function can be obtained if the tip is first calibrated against a reference sample of known work function{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}. Apart from this, one can use the normal topographic scan methods at the resonance frequency ''ω'' independently of the above. Thus, in one scan, the topography and the contact potential of the sample are determined simultaneously.
This can be done in (at least) two different ways: 1) The topography is captured in AC mode which means that the cantilever is driven by a piezo at its resonant frequency. Simultaneously the AC voltage for the KPFM measurement is applied at a frequency slightly lower than the resonant frequency of the cantilever. In this measurement mode the topography and the contact potential difference are captured at the same time and this mode is often called single-pass. 2) One line of the topography is captured either in contact or AC mode and is stored internally. Then, this line is scanned again, while the cantilever remains on a defined distance to the sample without a mechanically driven oscillation but the AC voltage of the KPFM measurement is applied and the contact potential is captured as explained above. It is important to note that the cantilever tip must not be too close to the sample in order to allow good oscillation with applied AC voltage. Therefore, KPFM can be performed simultaneously during AC topography measurements but not during contact topography measurements.

[[File:Lunar cataclysm.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Artist's impression of the Moon during the ''Late Heavy Bombardment'' (above) and today (below).]]

The '''Late Heavy Bombardment''' (abbreviated '''LHB''' and also known as the '''lunar cataclysm''') is an event thought to have occurred approximately 4.1 to 3.8 billion [[year]]s (Ga) ago,&lt;ref name=taylor1/&gt; at a time corresponding to the [[Neohadean]] and [[Eoarchean]] eras on Earth. During this interval, a disproportionately large number of [[asteroid]]s are theorized to have collided with the early [[terrestrial planet]]s in the inner [[Solar System]], including [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], and [[Mars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-642-11274-4_869|title= Encyclopedia of Astrobiology|first1= Philippe|last1= Claeys|first2= Alessandro|last2= Morbidelli|editor-first1= Muriel|editor-last1= Gargaud|editor-first2= Prof Ricardo|editor-last2= Amils|editor-first3= José Cernicharo|editor-last3= Quintanilla|editor-first4= Henderson James (Jim) |editor-last4= Cleaves II|editor-first5= William M.|editor-last5= Irvine|editor-first6= Prof Daniele L.|editor-last6= Pinti|editor-first7= Michel|editor-last7= Viso|date= 1 January 2011|publisher= Springer Berlin Heidelberg|pages= 909–912|via= link.springer.com|doi= 10.1007/978-3-642-11274-4_869|chapter= Late Heavy Bombardment|isbn= 978-3-642-11271-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Late Heavy Bombardment happened after the Earth and other rocky planets had formed and [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accreted]] most of their mass, but still quite early in Earth's history.

Evidence for the LHB derives from lunar samples brought back by the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] astronauts. [[Radiometric dating|Isotopic dating]] of [[Moon]] rocks implies that most impact melts occurred in a rather narrow interval of time. Several hypotheses attempt to explain the apparent spike in the flux of impactors (i.e. [[asteroid]]s and [[comet]]s) in the inner Solar System, but no consensus yet exists. The [[Nice model]], popular among [[Planetary science|planetary scientists]], postulates that the [[giant planet]]s underwent [[Planetary migration|orbital migration]] and in doing so, scattered objects in the [[asteroid belt|asteroid]] and/or [[Kuiper belt]]s into eccentric orbits, and into the path of the terrestrial planets. Other researchers argue that the lunar sample data do not require a cataclysmic cratering event near 3.9&amp;nbsp;Ga, and that the apparent clustering of impact-melt ages near this time is an artifact of sampling materials retrieved from a single large impact basin.&lt;ref name=taylor1/&gt; They also note that the rate of impact cratering could differ significantly between the outer and inner zones of the Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;

== Evidence for a cataclysm ==
The main piece of evidence for a lunar cataclysm comes from the [[radiometric dating|radiometric ages]] of impact melt rocks that were collected during the Apollo missions. The majority of these impact melts are believed to have formed during the collision of asteroids or comets tens of kilometres across, forming impact craters hundreds of kilometres in diameter. The [[Apollo 15]], [[Apollo 16|16]], and [[Apollo 17|17]] landing sites were chosen as a result of their proximity to the [[Mare Imbrium|Imbrium]], [[Mare Nectaris|Nectaris]], and [[Mare Serenitatis|Serenitatis]] basins, respectively.

The apparent clustering of ages of these impact melts, between about 3.8 and 4.1&amp;nbsp;Ga, led to postulation that the ages record an intense bombardment of the [[Moon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tera |first=F. |last2=Papanastassiou |first2=D.A. |last3=Wasserburg |first3=G.J.| date=1974 |title=Isotopic evidence for a terminal lunar cataclysm |journal=Earth Planet. Sci. Lett.| issue=22| pages=1–21 | doi=10.1016/0012-821x(74)90059-4|bibcode=1974E&amp;PSL..22....1T}}&lt;/ref&gt; They called it the "lunar cataclysm" and proposed that it represented a dramatic increase in the rate of bombardment of the Moon around 3.9&amp;nbsp;Ga. If these impact melts were derived from these three basins, then not only did these three prominent impact basins form within a short interval of time, but so did many others based on [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] grounds. At the time, the conclusion was considered controversial.

As more data has become available, particularly from [[lunar meteorite]]s, this theory, while still controversial, has gained in popularity. The lunar meteorites are believed to randomly sample the lunar surface, and at least some of these should have originated from regions far from the Apollo landing sites. Many of the [[Feldspar|feldspathic]] lunar meteorites probably originated from the lunar far side, and impact melts within these have recently been dated. Consistent with the cataclysm hypothesis, none of their ages was found to be older than about 3.9&amp;nbsp;Ga.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cohen |first=B. A. |last2=Swindle |first2=T.

Dating of [[howardite]], [[eucrite]] and [[diogenite]] (HED) meteorites and [[H chondrite]] meteorites originating from the asteroid belt reveal numerous ages from 3.4–4.1 Ga and an earlier peak at 4.5 Ga. The 3.4–4.1 Ga ages has been interpreted as representing an increase in impact velocities as computer simulations using hydrocode reveal that the volume of impact melt increases 100–1,000 times as the impact velocity increases from the current asteroid belt average of 5&amp;nbsp;km/s to 10&amp;nbsp;km/s. Impact velocities above 10&amp;nbsp;km/s require very high inclinations or the large eccentricities of asteroids on planet crossing orbits. Such objects are rare in the current asteroid belt but the population would be significantly increased by the sweeping of resonances due to giant planet migration.&lt;ref name=March_etal_2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marchi|first=S. |author2=Bottke, W.

== Criticisms of the cataclysm hypothesis ==
While the cataclysm hypothesis has recently gained in popularity, particularly among dynamicists who have identified possible causes for such a phenomenon, the cataclysm hypothesis is still controversial and based on debatable assumptions. Two criticisms are that (1) the "cluster" of impact ages could be an artifact of sampling a single basin's ejecta, and (2) that the lack of impact melt rocks older than about 4.1&amp;nbsp;Ga is related to all such samples having been pulverized, or their ages being reset.

The first criticism concerns the origin of the impact melt rocks that were sampled at the Apollo landing sites. While these impact melts have been commonly attributed to having been derived from the ''closest basin'', it has been argued that a large portion of these might instead be derived from the Imbrium basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = L.

According to this alternative hypothesis, the cluster of impact melt ages near 3.9&amp;nbsp;Ga simply reflects material being collected from a single impact event, Imbrium, and not several. Additional criticism also argues that the age spike at 3.9 Ga identified in 40Ar/39Ar dating could also be produced by an episodic early crust formation followed by partial 40Ar losses as the impact rate declined.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A second criticism concerns the significance of the lack of impact melt rocks older than about 4.1&amp;nbsp;Ga. One hypothesis for this observation that does not involve a cataclysm is that old melt rocks did exist, but that their ages have all been reset by the continuous effects of impact cratering over the past 4 billion years. Furthermore, it is possible that these putative samples could all have been pulverized to such small sizes that it is impossible to obtain age determinations using standard radiometric methods.&lt;ref name=Hartmann_2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hartmann|first=W.

Latest reinterpretation of crater statistics suggests that the flux on the Moon and on Mars may have been lower in general. Thus, the recorded crater population can be explained without any peak in the earliest bombardment of the inner Solar System.

Before the formulation of the LHB theory, geologists generally assumed that the Earth remained molten until about 3.8&amp;nbsp;Ga. This date could be found in many of the [[Oldest dated rocks|oldest-known rocks]] from around the world, and appeared to represent a strong "cutoff point" beyond which older rocks could not be found. These dates remained fairly constant even across various dating methods, including the system considered the most accurate and least affected by environment, [[uranium–lead dating]] of [[zircon]]s. As no older rocks could be found, it was generally assumed that the Earth had remained molten until this date, which defined the boundary between the earlier [[Hadean]] and later [[Archean]] eons. Nonetheless, more recently, in 1999, the oldest known rock on Earth was dated to be 4.031 ± 0.003 billion years old, and is part of the [[Acasta Gneiss]] of the [[Slave Craton]] in northwestern Canada.&lt;ref name="Bowring"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s004100050465 | title = Priscoan (4.00–4.03 Ga) orthogneisses from northwestern Canada | year = 1999 | author = Bowring, Samuel A. | journal = Contributions to Mineralogy and Petrology | volume = 134 | page = 3 | bibcode=1999CoMP..134....3B | last2 = Williams | first2 = Ian S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Older rocks could be found, however, in the form of [[asteroid]] fragments that fall to Earth as [[meteorite]]s. Like the rocks on Earth, asteroids also show a strong cutoff point, at about 4.6&amp;nbsp;Ga, which is assumed to be the time when the first solids formed in the [[protoplanetary disk]] around the then-young Sun. The Hadean, then, was the period of time between the formation of these early rocks in space, and the eventual solidification of the Earth's crust, some 700 million years later. This time would include the accretion of the planets from the disk and the slow cooling of the Earth into a solid body as the gravitational potential energy of accretion was released.

Later calculations showed that the rate of collapse and cooling depends on the size of the rocky body. Scaling this rate to an object of Earth mass suggested very rapid cooling, requiring only 100 million years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001AGUFM.U52A0009M Lithosphere-Hydrosphere Interactions on the Hadean (&gt;4 Ga) Earth], covers many of the Hadean issues and timelines in depth&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between measurement and theory presented a conundrum at the time.

The LHB offers a potential explanation for this anomaly. Under this model, the rocks dating to 3.8&amp;nbsp;Ga solidified only after much of the crust was destroyed by the LHB. Collectively, the [[Acasta Gneiss]] in the North American cratonic shield and the gneisses within the [[Jack Hills]] portion of the Narryer Gneiss Terrane in Western Australia are the oldest continental fragments on Earth, yet they appear to post-date the LHB. The oldest mineral yet dated on Earth, a 4.404 Ga zircon from Jack Hills, predates this event, but it is likely a fragment of crust left over from before the LHB, contained within a much younger (~3.8&amp;nbsp;Ga old) rock. {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

The Jack Hills zircon led to something of a revolution in our understanding of the Hadean eon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/12/051227155953.htm Revising Earth's Early History]&lt;/ref&gt; Older references generally show that Hadean Earth had a molten surface with prominent [[volcano]]s. The name "Hadean" itself refers to the "hellish" conditions assumed on Earth for the time, from the Greek [[Hades]]. Zircon dating suggested, albeit controversially, that the Hadean surface was solid, temperate, and covered by acidic oceans. This picture derives from the presence of particular isotopic ratios that suggest the action of water-based chemistry at some time before the formation of the oldest rocks (see [[Cool early Earth]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocean.tamu.edu/Quarterdeck/1999/01/morse.html |title=Carbonates' role in the chemical evolution of oceans on Earth &amp; Mars |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613174016/http://ocean.tamu.edu/Quarterdeck/1999/01/morse.html |archivedate=2010-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of particular interest, Manfred Schidlowski argued in 1979 that the carbon isotopic ratios of some sedimentary rocks found in [[Greenland]] were a relic of organic matter. There was much debate over the precise dating of the rocks, with Schidlowski suggesting they were about 3.8&amp;nbsp;Ga old, and others suggesting a more "modest" 3.6&amp;nbsp;Ga. In either case it was a very short time for [[abiogenesis]] to have taken place, and if Schidlowski was correct, arguably too short a time. The ''Late Heavy Bombardment'' and the "re-melting" of the crust that it suggests provides a timeline under which this would be possible; [[life]] either formed immediately after the ''Late Heavy Bombardment'', or more likely survived it, having arisen earlier during the [[Hadean]]. Recent studies suggest that the rocks Schidlowski found are indeed from the older end of the possible age range at about 3.85&amp;nbsp;Ga, suggesting the latter possibility is the most likely answer.&lt;ref name="AB-20021014"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tenenbaum |first=David |title=When Did Life on Earth Begin?

More recently, a similar study of Jack Hills rocks shows traces of the same sort of potential organic indicators. Thorsten Geisler of the Institute for Mineralogy at the [[University of Münster]] studied traces of carbon trapped in small pieces of diamond and graphite within zircons dating to 4.25&amp;nbsp;Ga. The ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-13 was unusually high, normally a sign of "processing" by life.&lt;ref name="NS-20080702"&gt;{{cite web |last=Courtland |first=Rachel |title=Did newborn Earth harbour life? |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14245-did-newborn-earth-harbour-life.html |date=July 2, 2008 |work=[[New Scientist]] |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three-dimensional computer models developed in May 2009 by a team at the [[University of Colorado Boulder|University of Colorado at Boulder]] postulate that much of Earth's crust, and the microbes living in it, could have survived the bombardment. Their models suggest that although the surface of the Earth would have been sterilized, [[hydrothermal vent]]s below the Earth's surface could have incubated life by providing a sanctuary for [[Thermophile|heat-loving microbes]].&lt;ref name="RN-20090520"&gt;{{cite web |last=Steenhuysen |first=Julie |title=Study turns back clock on origins of life on Earth |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/05/20/us-asteroids-idUSTRE54J5PX20090520 |date=May 20, 2009 |work=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=April 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, scientists reported finding evidence of the largest terrestrial meteor [[impact event]] to date near the [[Barberton Greenstone Belt#Barberton greenstone belt|Barberton Greenstone Belt]]. They estimated the impact occurred about 3.26 billion years ago and that the impactor was approximately 37 to 58 kilometres (23 to 36 miles) wide.

In the Nice model the Late Heavy Bombardment is the result of a dynamical instability in the outer Solar System. The original Nice model simulations by Gomes ''et al.'' began with the [[Solar System]]'s giant planets in a tight orbital configuration surrounded by a rich [[Trans-Neptunian object|trans-Neptunian belt]]. Objects from this belt stray into planet crossing orbits causing the orbits of the planets to migrate over several hundred million years. Jupiter and Saturn's orbits drift apart slowly until they cross a 2:1 [[orbital resonance]] causing the [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricities]] of their orbits to increase. The orbits of the planets become unstable and Uranus and Neptune are scattered onto wider orbits that disrupt the outer belt, causing a bombardment of comets as they enter planet crossing orbits. Interactions between the objects and the planets also drive a faster migration of Jupiter and Saturn's orbits. This migration causes resonances to sweep through the asteroid belt, increasing the eccentricities of many asteroids until they enter the inner Solar System and impact the terrestrial planets.&lt;ref name=taylor1&gt;Taylor, G.

=== Late Uranus/Neptune formation ===
According to one [[planetesimal]] simulation of the establishment of the planetary system, the outermost planets Uranus and Neptune formed very slowly, over a period of several billion years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Formation of planets around stars of various masses. I – Formulation and a star of one solar mass|first=T.|last=Nakano|date=1 January 1987|publisher=|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=224|pages=107–130|via=NASA ADS|doi=10.1093/mnras/224.1.107|bibcode=1987MNRAS.224..107N}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harold Levison and his team have also suggested that the relatively low density of material in the outer Solar System during planet formation would have greatly slowed their accretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Aug01/bombardment.html | title = Uranus, Neptune, and the Mountains of the Moon | publisher = Planetary Science Research Discoveries | last = G. J. Taylor | date = August 21, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This "late appearance" of these planets has therefore been suggested as a different reason for the LHB. However, recent calculations of gas-flows combined with planetesimal runaway growth in the outer Solar System imply that [[Giant planet|Jovian planets]] formed extremely rapidly, on the order of 10 My, which does not support this explanation for the LHB.

=== Planet V hypothesis ===
{{Main|Planet V}}
The Planet V hypothesis posits that a fifth [[terrestrial planet]] created the ''Late Heavy Bombardment'' when its meta-stable orbit entered the inner asteroid belt. The hypothetical fifth terrestrial planet, Planet V, had a mass less than half of Mars and originally orbited between Mars and the asteroid belt. Planet V's orbit became unstable due to perturbations from the other inner planets causing it to intersect the inner asteroid belt. After close encounters with Planet V, many asteroids entered Earth-crossing orbits producing the ''Late Heavy Bombardment''. Planet V was ultimately lost, likely plunging into the Sun. In numerical simulations, an uneven distribution of asteroids, with the asteroids heavily concentrated toward the inner asteroid belt, has been shown to be necessary to produce the LHB via this mechanism.&lt;ref name=Brasser_2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brasser|first=R|author2=Morbidelli, A. |title=The terrestrial Planet V hypothesis as the mechanism for the origin of the late heavy bombardment|journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics|date=2011|volume=535|page=A41|url=http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2011/11/aa17336-11/aa17336-11.html|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201117336|bibcode=2011A&amp;A...535A..41B}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternate version of this hypothesis in which the lunar impactors are debris resulting from Planet V impacting Mars, forming the [[North Polar Basin (Mars)|Borealis Basin]], has been proposed to explain a low number of giant lunar basins relative to craters and a lack of evidence of cometary impactors.&lt;ref name=Minton_etal_2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Minton|first1=D.

=== Disruption of Mars-crossing asteroid ===
A hypothesis proposed by Matija Ćuk posits that the last few basin-forming impacts were the result of the collisional disruption of a large Mars-crossing asteroid. This [[4 Vesta|Vesta]]-sized asteroid was a remnant of a population which initially was much larger than the current main asteroid belt. Most of the pre-Imbrium impacts would have been due to these Mars-crossing objects, with the early bombardment extending until 4.1 billion years ago. A lull in basin-forming impacts then followed during which the lunar magnetic field decayed. Then roughly 3.9 billion years ago a catastrophic impact disrupted the Vesta-sized asteroid radically increasing the population of Mars-crossing objects. Many of these objects then evolved onto Earth-crossing orbits producing a spike in the lunar impact rate during which the last few lunar impact basins are formed. Ćuk points to the weak or absent residual magnetism of the last few basins and a change in the size-frequency distribution of craters which formed during this late bombardment as evidence supporting this hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Cuk_1012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ćuk|first=Matija|title=Chronology and sources of lunar impact bombardment|journal=Icarus|date=2012|volume=218|issue=1|pages=69–79|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2011.11.031|arxiv=1112.0046|bibcode=2012Icar..218...69C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The timing&lt;ref name=Cuk_etal_2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ćuk|first=Matija|author2=Gladman, Brett J. |author3=Stewart, Sarah T. |title=Constraints on the source of lunar cataclysm impactors|journal=Icarus|date=2010|volume=207|issue=2|pages=590–594|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2009.12.013|arxiv=0912.1847|bibcode=2010Icar..207..590C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Malhatra_2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malhotra|first=Renu|author2=Strom, Robert G. |title=Comment on "Constraints on the source of lunar cataclysm impactors"|journal=Icarus|date=2011|volume=216|issue=1|pages=359–362|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2010.11.037|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103510004586|bibcode=2011Icar..216..359M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cuk_etal_2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ćuk|first=Matija|author2=Gladman, Brett J. |author3=Stewart, Sarah T. |title=Rebuttal to the comment by Malhotra and Strom on "Constraints on the source of lunar cataclysm impactors"|journal=Icarus|volume=216|issue=1|pages=363–365|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2011.08.011|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103511003289|bibcode=2011Icar..216..363C|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fasset_2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fassett|first=C.

=== Other potential sources ===
A number of other possible sources of the ''Late Heavy Bombardment'' have been investigated. Among these are additional Earth satellites orbiting independently or as lunar trojans, planetesimals left over from the formations of the terrestrial planets, Earth or Venus co-orbitals, and the breakup of a large main belt asteroid.

'''Laura Bay Conservation Park''' is a [[protected area]] located in the Australian state of [[South Australia]] on the west coast of [[Eyre Peninsula]] adjoining the [[headland]] of Laura Bay Point in the gazetted locality of [[Laura Bay, South Australia|Laura Bay]] about {{convert|20|km|abbr=off}} south east of the town of [[Ceduna, South Australia|Ceduna]].&lt;ref name=PLB/&gt;  

It was proclaimed on 15 February 1973.&lt;ref name=ReserveList/&gt; The Laura Bay Conservation Reserve which have been dedicated as a [[conservation reserves of South Australia|conservation reserve]] under the state’s ''Crown Lands Act 1929''  on 11 November 1993 was added to the conservation park on 10 July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=CROWN LANDS ACT, 1929: SECTION 5, The Seventh Schedule |journal=The South Australian Government Gazette |date=11 November 1993|page=2438 |url= http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/sa_gazette/1993/114.pdf |accessdate=23 December 2016 |publisher=Government of South Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=National Parks and Wildlife (Laura Bay Conservation Park) Proclamation 2014|journal=The South Australian Government Gazette |date=10 July 2014 |page=3211|url= http://www.governmentgazette.sa.gov.au/sites/default/files/documentstore/2014/July/2014_052.pdf|accessdate=26 December 2016 |publisher=Government of South Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 The following state of significance was published in 1980:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Register of the National Estate (Non-statutory archive), Laura Bay Conservation Park, Flinders Hwy, Laura Bay via Ceduna, SA, Australia|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/ahdb/search.pl?mode=place_detail;place_id=6735|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia, Department of the Environment|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This small park (sic) preserves a diversity of coastal communities ranging from coastal mallee scrub through to mangrove flats. Mangrove areas in South Australia have been markedly depleted.  Laura Bay Conservation Park is scenically attractive and accommodates many tourists and visitors.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The conservation park is classified as an [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] [[IUCN protected area categories#Category III — Natural Monument or Feature|Category III protected area]].&lt;ref name=CAPAD2012SASum/&gt;

[[Image:DistMatchWiki1.png|thumb|500px|Example: The matching distance between &lt;math&gt;\ell_1=r+a+b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ell_2=r'+a'&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;d_\text{match}(\ell_1, \ell_2)=\max\{\delta(r,r'),\delta(b,a'),\delta(a,\Delta)\}=4&lt;/math&gt;]]

The core of the definition of matching distance is the observation that the
information contained in a size function can be combinatorially stored in a formal series of lines and points of the plane, called respectively ''[[size function|cornerlines]]''  and ''[[size function|cornerpoints]]''.

Given two size functions &lt;math&gt;\ell_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ell_2&lt;/math&gt;,  let  &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; (resp. &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;) be the multiset of
all cornerpoints and cornerlines for &lt;math&gt;\ell_1&lt;/math&gt; (resp. &lt;math&gt;\ell_2&lt;/math&gt;) counted with their
multiplicities, augmented by adding a countable infinity of points  of the
diagonal &lt;math&gt;\{(x,y)\in \R^2: x=y\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''matching distance'' between &lt;math&gt;\ell_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ell_2&lt;/math&gt; is given by
&lt;math&gt;d_\text{match}(\ell_1, \ell_2)=\min_\sigma\max_{p\in C_1}\delta (p,\sigma(p))&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; varies among all the bijections between &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; and

: &lt;math&gt;\delta\left((x,y),(x',y')\right)=\min\left\{\max \{|x-x'|,|y-y'|\}, \max\left\{\frac{y-x}{2},\frac{y'-x'}{2}\right\}\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Roughly speaking, the matching distance &lt;math&gt;d_\text{match}&lt;/math&gt;
between two size functions is the minimum, over all the matchings
between the cornerpoints of the two size functions, of the maximum
of the &lt;math&gt;L_\infty&lt;/math&gt;-distances between two matched cornerpoints. Since
two size functions can have a different number of cornerpoints,
these can be also matched to points of the diagonal &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, the definition of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; implies that matching two points of the diagonal has no cost.

[[File:Melting icecubes.gif|thumb|Melting ice cubes illustrate the process of fusion.]]

'''Melting''', or [[Enthalpy of fusion|fusion]], is a physical process that results in the [[phase transition]] of a [[chemical substance|substance]] from a [[solid]] to a [[liquid]]. This occurs when the [[internal energy]] of the solid increases, typically by the application of [[heat]] or [[pressure]], which increases the substance's [[temperature]] to the [[melting point]]. At the melting point, the ordering of [[ion]]s or [[molecule]]s in the solid breaks down to a less ordered state, and the solid '''melts''' to become a liquid.

Substances in the molten state generally have reduced [[viscosity]] as  the temperature increases. An exception to this principle is the element [[sulfur]], whose viscosity increases to a point due to [[polymerization]] and then decreases with higher temperatures in its molten state.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan (2011) ''Sulfure'', Encyclopedia of Earth, eds. A.Jorgensen and C.J.Cleveland, National Council for Science and the environment, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[organic compound]]s melt through [[mesophase]]s, states of partial order between solid and liquid.

== Melting as a first-order phase transition ==
From a thermodynamics point of view, at the melting point the change in [[Gibbs free energy]] ''∆G'' of the substances is zero, but there are non-zero changes in the [[enthalpy]] (''H'') and the [[entropy]] (''S''), known respectively as the [[enthalpy of fusion]] (or [[latent heat]] of fusion) and the [[entropy of fusion]]. Melting is therefore classified as a [[Phase transition#Modern classifications|first-order phase transition]]. Melting occurs when the Gibbs free energy of the liquid becomes lower than the solid for that material. The temperature at which this occurs is dependent on the ambient pressure.

Low-temperature [[helium]] is the only known exception to the general rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Atkins |first=Peter |last2=Jones |first2=Loretta |year=2008 |title=Chemical Principles: The Quest for Insight |edition=4th |publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company |isbn=0-7167-7355-4 |page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helium-3]] has a negative enthalpy of fusion at temperatures below 0.3 K. [[Helium-4]] also has a very slightly negative enthalpy of fusion below 0.8 K. This means that, at appropriate constant pressures, heat must be ''removed'' from these substances in order to melt them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Ott |first=J. Bevan |last2=Boerio-Goates |first2=Juliana |year=2000 |title=Chemical Thermodynamics: Advanced Applications |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=0-12-530985-6 |pages=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Melting criteria==
Among the theoretical criteria for melting, the [[Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell|Lindemann]]&lt;ref&gt;F.A. Lindemann, Phys. Z. 11 (1910) 609–614.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Max Born|Born]]&lt;ref&gt;M. Born, J. Chem. Phys. 7 (1939) 591–601.&lt;/ref&gt; criteria are those most frequently used as a basis to analyse the melting conditions . The Lindemann criterion states that melting occurs because of vibrational instability, e.g. [[crystal]]s melt when the average amplitude of thermal vibrations of atoms is relatively high compared with interatomic distances, e.g. &lt;''δu&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; ''δ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', where ''δu'' is the atomic displacement, the Lindemann parameter ''δ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≈ 0.20...0.25 and ''R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is one-half of the inter-atomic distance.&lt;ref name="Rice2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stuart A. Rice|title=Advances in Chemical Physics|date=15 February 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-23807-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|177}} The Lindemann melting criterion is supported by experimental data both for [[crystal]]line materials and for [[glass-liquid transition]]s in amorphous materials. The Born criterion is based on rigidity catastrophe caused by the vanishing elastic shear modulus, e.g. when the crystal no longer has sufficient rigidity to mechanically withstand load.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert W. Cahn]] (2001) [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v413/n6856/full/413582a0.html Materials science: Melting from Within], [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] 413 (#6856)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supercooling==
{{main|Supercooling}}

Under a standard set of conditions, the melting point of a substance is a characteristic property.  The melting point is often equal to the [[melting point|freezing point]]. However, under carefully created conditions, supercooling or superheating past the melting or freezing point can occur. [[properties of water|Water]] on a very clean glass surface will often supercool several degrees below the freezing point without freezing.  Fine emulsions of pure water have been cooled to −38 degrees Celsius without nucleation to form [[ice]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Nucleation occurs due to fluctuations in the properties of the material. If the material is kept still there is often nothing (such a physical vibration) to trigger this change, and supercooling (or superheating) may occur. Thermodynamically, the supercooled liquid is in the metastable state with respect to the crystalline phase, and it is likely to crystallize suddenly.

==Melting of amorphous solids (glasses)==
Glasses are [[amorphous solid]]s which are usually fabricated when the molten material cools very rapidly to below its glass transition temperature, without sufficient time for a regular crystal lattice to form. Solids are characterised by a high degree of connectivity between their molecules, and fluids have lower connectivity of their structural blocks. Melting of a solid material can also be considered as a percolation via broken connections between particles e.g. connecting bonds.&lt;ref&gt;S.Y. Park and D. Stroud, Phys. Rev. B 67, 212202 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach melting of an amorphous material occurs when the broken bonds form a percolation cluster with ''T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' dependent on quasi-equilibrium thermodynamic parameters of bonds e.g. on enthalpy (''H&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'') and entropy (''S&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'') of formation of bonds in a given system at given conditions:&lt;ref&gt;M.I. Ojovan, W.E. Lee. J. Non-Cryst. Solids, 356, 2534–2540 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;T_g = \frac{H_d}{S_d+ R \ln(\frac{1-f_c}{f_c})},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the percolation threshold and ''R'' is the universal gas constant. Although ''H&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''S&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' are not true equilibrium thermodynamic parameters and can depend on the cooling rate of a melt they can be found from available experimental data on [[viscosity of amorphous materials]].

Even below its melting point, quasi-liquid films can be observed on crystalline surfaces. The thickness of the film is temperature dependent. This effect is common for all crystalline materials. Pre-melting shows its effects in e.g. frost heave, the growth of snowflakes and, taking grain boundary interfaces into account, maybe even in the movement of [[glacier]]s.

The '''Montalto di Castro photovoltaic power station''' is a 84 [[megawatt]] (MW) [[photovoltaic power station]] at [[Montalto di Castro]] in [[Province of Viterbo|Viterbo province]], [[Italy]]. The project was developed by the independent developer SunRay that was later acquired by [[SunPower]]. The park is the largest PV project in Italy, and among [[List of photovoltaic power stations|the largest in Europe]].

The project was built in several phases. The first phase with a total capacity of 24&amp;nbsp;MW&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt; was connected in late 2009. It uses SunPower solar panels as well as its tracker systems.&lt;ref name=exen /&gt; The second phase (8 MW) was commissioned in 2010, and the third and fourth phases, totaling 44&amp;nbsp;MW&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt;, were completed in December 2010, totaling 276,156 [[solar module]]s with 305 watt each.&lt;ref&gt;

In [[Photoelectrochemistry#Semiconductor electrochemistry|semiconductor electrochemistry]], a '''Mott–Schottky plot''' describes the reciprocal of the square of [[capacitance]] &lt;math&gt;(1/C^2)&lt;/math&gt; versus the potential difference between bulk [[semiconductor]] and bulk [[electrolyte]]. In many theories, and in many experimental measurements, the plot is linear.The use of Mott–Schottky plots to determine system properties (such as flatband potential, doping density or Helmholtz capacitance) is termed Mott–Schottky analysis.&lt;ref name="JuanBisquert"&gt;{{cite book | title=Nanostructured Energy Devices: Equilibrium Concepts and Kinetics|last1=Bisquert |first1=Juan |authorlink1=Juan Bisquert |year= 2014 |publisher=CRC Press | url= https://www.crcpress.com/Nanostructured-Energy-Devices-Equilibrium-Concepts-and-Kinetics/Bisquert/p/book/9781439836026}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GeldermanLee2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gelderman|first1=K.|last2=Lee|first2=L.|last3=Donne|first3=S.

[[File:Mott-Schottky plot scheme.tif|thumb| Figure 1. (a) Shows an energy diagram of n-type [[semiconductor]] in contact with redox electrolyte at the left side (yellow), and with a metallic ohmic contact at the right side. E&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[conduction band]] edge energy, E&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[valence band]] energy of the semiconductor. By equilibration of the Fermi level in the semiconductor, E&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;, and the redox energy of electrolyte, E&lt;sub&gt;redox&lt;/sub&gt;, a Schottky barrier is formed at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. The vertical size of the barrier in the energy diagram corresponds to the built-in potential V&lt;sub&gt;bi&lt;/sub&gt;. In the spatial axis the equilibration of Fermi levels produces a space charge region or depletion region of size w. A positive voltage applied to the back contact in (b) raises the Fermi level of electrons E&lt;sub&gt;Fn&lt;/sub&gt;, and decreases the size of the depletion region. Consequently, the capacitance of the junction increases, and the reciprocal square capacitance decreases forming a linear Mott–Schottky plot in (c). The intercept with the x-axis shows the flatband situation, that reveals the built-in potential, depending on the reference of voltage in the electrolyte side. (d) In the presence of a surface state of density N&lt;sub&gt;ss&lt;/sub&gt;, when the Fermi level reaches the bandgap state level, it is discharged and a plateau occurs depending on the value of the Helmholtz layer capacitance C&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; at the electrolyte side of the junction. When the surface state is charged the Mott–Schottky lines continues, but the flatband potential is modified according to the extend of unpinning of the Fermi level.

Mott–Schottky plot of a fluor-doped tin oxide (FTO) semiconductor electrode measured in aqueous electrolyte at different pH, with respect to standard Ag/AgCl electrode. Changing the pH modifies the apparent flatband potential by 570 mV corresponding to a 59 mV displacement per unit of pH. From the slope the donor density N&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; is determined. Then the same sample is measured after nanostructured TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is deposited on top of FTO. The observed change of slope is due to the decrease of the surface in direct contact with the electrolyte.]]

Consider the semiconductor/electrolyte junction shown in Figure 1. Under applied bias voltage &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; the size of the depletion layer &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is

&lt;math&gt;w={\left\lbrack \frac{2\varepsilon }{{\mathit{q}}{\mathit{N}}_{D}}\left(V+{V}_{\text{bi}}\right)\right\rbrack }^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; (1)

Here &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; is the dielectric constant, &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the elementary charge, &lt;math&gt;{N}_{D}&lt;/math&gt; is the doping density, &lt;math&gt;{V}_{\text{bi}}&lt;/math&gt; is the built-in potential.

The depletion region contains positive charge compensated by ionic negative charge at the semiconductor surface (in the liquid electrolyte side). Charge separation forms a [[dielectric]] [[capacitor]] at the interface of the metal/semiconductor contact. We calculate the capacitance for an electrode area &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; as

&lt;math&gt;C=\frac{\partial Q}{\partial V}={\mathit{q}}{\mathit{N}}_{D}A\frac{\partial w}{\partial V}&lt;/math&gt; (2)

replacing &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial w}{\partial V}&lt;/math&gt; as obtained from equation 1, the result of the [[capacitance]] per unit area is

&lt;math&gt;C=A\frac{\varepsilon }{w}&lt;/math&gt; (3)

a equation describing the capacitance of a capacitor constructed of two parallel plates both of area &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; separated by a distance  &lt;math&gt;w &lt;/math&gt;.

Replacing equation (3) in (1) we obtain the result

&lt;math&gt;{C}^{-2}=\frac{2}{{\mathit{qA}}^{2}{\mathit{\varepsilon N}}_{D}}\left(V+{V}_{\text{bi}}\right)&lt;/math&gt; (4).

Therefore, a representation of the reciprocal square capacitance, is a linear function of the voltage, which constitutes the Mott–Schottky plot as shown in Fig. 1c. The measurement of the Mott–Schottky plot brings us two important pieces of information.

# The slope gives the [[doping (semiconductor)]] density (provided that the [[dielectric constant]] is known).
# The intercept to the ''x'' axis provides the built-in potential, or the flatband potential (as here the surface barrier has been flattened) and allows establishing the semiconductor conduction band level with respect to the reference of potential.

In liquid junction the reference of potential is normally a standard [[reference electrode]]. In solid junctions, we can take as a reference the metal Fermi level, if the [[work function]] is known, which provides a full energy diagram in the physical scale. The Mott–Schottky plot is sensitive to the electrode surface in contact with solution, see Figure 2.

A more accurate analysis considering the statistics of electrons provides the following result for the size of the depletion region

&lt;math&gt;w={\left\lbrack \frac{2\varepsilon }{{\mathit{qN}}_{D}}\left({V}_{\text{bi}}+V-\frac{{k}_{B}T}{q}\right)\right\rbrack }^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;(5)

in this case the [[Mott–Schottky equation]] is

&lt;math&gt;{C}^{-2}=\frac{2}{{\mathit{qA}}^{2}{\mathit{\varepsilon N}}_{D}}\left({V}_{\text{bi}}+V-\frac{{k}_{B}T}{q}\right)&lt;/math&gt;(6)

When the interfacial barrier is of the order &lt;math&gt;{k}_{B}T&lt;/math&gt;, special care has to be taken to interpret the capacitance measurement. In fact at these small voltages the capacitance makes a peak that can be used for the determination of the built-in voltage.

The Mott–Schottky analysis can more generally resolve a variable [[Capacitance–voltage profiling|doping profile]] in the semiconductor as follows

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\left({C}^{-2}\right)}{\text{d}\mathit{V}}=\frac{2}{{\mathit{qA}}^{2}{\mathit{\varepsilon N}}_{D}\left(w\right)}&lt;/math&gt;(7)

The derivative gives the doping at the edge of the depletion region, &lt;math&gt;{N}_{D}\left(w\right)&lt;/math&gt;. This method only provides a spatial resolution of the order of a [[Debye length]] &lt;math&gt;{\lambda }_{D}&lt;/math&gt;.

In systems where more than one process gives a substantial kinetic response, it is necessary to adopt [[Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy]] that resolves the different capacitances in the system.&lt;ref name="KlahrGimenez2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klahr|first1=Benjamin|last2=Gimenez|first2=Sixto|last3=Fabregat-Santiago|first3=Francisco|last4=Hamann|first4=Thomas|last5=Bisquert|first5=Juan|authorlink5=Juan Bisquert |title=Water Oxidation at Hematite Photoelectrodes: The Role of Surface States|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=134|issue=9|year=2012|pages=4294–4302|issn=0002-7863|doi=10.1021/ja210755h}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the presence of a surface state at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface, the spectra show two arcs, one at low frequency and another one at high frequency. The depletion capacitance leading to Mott–Schottky plot is situated in the high frequency arc, as the depletion capacitance is a dielectric capacitance. On the other hand, the low frequency feature corresponds to the [[Quantum capacitance|chemical capacitance]] of the surface states. The surface state charging produces a plateau as indicated in Fig. 1d. Similarly, defect levels in the gap affect the changes of capacitance and conductance.

Another widely used method to scan deep levels in Schottky barriers is termed [[admittance spectroscopy]] and consists on measuring the capacitance at a fixed frequency while varying the temperature.

Surface photovoltage technique is used to determine the position of the band edges.

The '''November 2006 nor'easter''' was a powerful [[extratropical cyclone]] that formed offshore of the [[Southeastern United States]] on November 20, bringing heavy rains, high winds, beach erosion, and coastal flooding to the Carolinas and southern [[New England]]. In addition, the earliest snowfall ever noted in both [[Charleston, South Carolina]] and [[Savannah, Georgia]] occurred on the southwest side of this cyclone. Over 10,000 were without power during the storm. No longer a [[nor'easter]], the extratropical cyclone accelerated rapidly across the North Atlantic while rapidly strengthening, becoming a cyclonic storm again by November 25, but this time with hurricane-force sustained winds. The intense low made a cyclonic loop west of [[Iceland]], before being absorbed by another strengthening extratropical cyclone to the west of [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], late on December 1.

==Meteorological synopsis==
A shortwave moved through the southern stream of the [[polar jet]] of the Westerlies, dropping temperatures in its wake across the southeast United States. [[Cyclogenesis]] spurred a developing surface [[cyclone]] which quickly occluded on November 20. Surface pressure gradient between this cyclone and a sprawling high stretching around its periphery from [[New England]] into the [[Deep South]] led to strong winds in the Carolinas.  he cyclone deepened to a central pressure of {{convert|999|hPa|inHg}} before swinging westward into the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]] on November 22. At this time, a trio of upper-level shortwaves were rotating around the main closed cyclone aloft, which spurred development of a new, weaker low pressure center offshore North Carolina. This cyclone was weaker after its interaction with North Carolina until it reached New England, when renewed strengthening led to significant impacts across Long Island and southern New England. The system then began accelerating east-northeast while continuing to slowly strengthen, passing offshore [[Atlantic Canada]] on November 24. The cyclone subsequently bombed, or strengthened quite rapidly, and accelerated east-northeast, becoming a [[hurricane]]-force storm in the far north Atlantic with a central pressure of {{convert|967|hPa|inHg}} by the afternoon of November 25 and peaking at {{convert|944|hPa|inHg}} by the morning of November 26.&lt;ref&gt;Ocean Prediction Center. [http://www.opc.ncep.noaa.gov/UA/OPC_ATL.gif Weather Map of the North Atlantic.] Retrieved at 1408 UTC on 2006-11-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Slow weakening occurred soon afterward as the system slowed down and turned towards [[Iceland]]. By the evening of November 27, its central pressure had increased to {{convert|957|hPa|inHg}} while located a couple hundred miles south of Iceland. The cyclone continued to loop cyclonically west of Iceland, absorbing a cyclone along the way as it passed southwest off the southern tip of [[Greenland]], before a developing gale approaching Great Britain absorbed this cyclone late on December 1.&lt;ref&gt;Ocean Prediction Center.

There had been indications in the [[numerical weather prediction|forecast model guidance]] as early as the first week of November that [[weather]] would be unsettled/rainy across the eastern United States around November 23. Within seven days of the event, medium range forecasts generally maintained the idea of a coastal storm offshore the Southeast, though its progression out to sea remained uncertain until November 21, after the cyclone actually formed offshore the Southeast United States and began edging northeast.

The '''Nuclear Institute for Agriculture and Biology''', also known as '''NIAB''', is an agriculture and [[food irradiation]] [[Ministry of Science and Technology (Pakistan)|national research institute]] managed by the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]]. Along with Nuclear Institute for Food and Agriculture (NIFA), the NIAB reports directly to the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission|PAEC Biological Science Directorate]] whose current member is [[Abdul Rashid (agriculturist)|Abdul Rashid]]. The current director is Dr.Muhammad Hamed, and it is located in [[Faisalabad]], [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]].

==History==
The NIAB was established by [[Ishrat Hussain Usmani]] when PAEC established its first Biological Science Directorate in 1965. In 1967, with the efforts led by dr. [[Abdus Salam]], the [[Government of Pakistan|Government]] approved a project, and Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission began its construction. The operations and research began in 1970, and it was officially inaugurated by [[Munir Ahmad Khan]], then Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, in April 6, 1972. Khan later developed the institute and led the research activities in the institution. The nuclear medical research was also put under Khan, and NIAB had developed 23 different crop varieties, which are high yielding; they are disease resistant and are being cultivated throughout the country{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}.

At first, the institute was mandate to create and maintain new genetic material for sustained agriculture development and to conduct research on applied problems in the field of agriculture and biology using nuclear and other related techniques.

==Facilities==
The institute is equipped with well-equipped laboratories having facilities. The institute currently operates &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;[[Cobalt-60|Co]] irradiation sources, gas chromatographs, Photo-documentation system, and atomic absorption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niab.org.pk/index1.htm Facilities]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operative temperature''' (&lt;math&gt;t_o&lt;/math&gt;), also known as ''Dry resultant temperature'', or ''Resultant temperature'', is defined as a uniform temperature of an imaginary black enclosure in which an occupant would exchange the same amount of heat by [[radiation]] plus [[convection]] as in the actual nonuniform environment.&lt;ref name="7726_1998"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = International Standard Organization | year = 1998 | title = ISO 7726:1998 Ergonomics of the thermal environment -- Instruments for measuring physical quantities}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="7730_2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = International Standard Organization | year = 2005 | title = ISO 7730:2005 Ergonomics of the thermal environment -- Analytical determination and interpretation of thermal comfort using calculation of the PMV and PPD indices and local thermal comfort criteria}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="55_2013"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = ASHRAE Standard 55 | year = 2013 | title = Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ASHRAE Terminology, ASHRAE Handbook CD, 1999-2002&lt;/ref&gt; Some references also use the terms 'equivalent temperature" or 'effective temperature' to describe combined effects of convective and radiant heat transfer.&lt;ref&gt;Nilsson, H.O., Comfort Climate Evaluation with Thermal Manikin Methods and Computer Simulation Models, National Institute for Working Life, 2004, pg. 37&lt;/ref&gt; In design, operative temperature can be defined as the average of the [[Mean radiant temperature|mean radiant]] and [[Dry-bulb temperature|ambient air temperatures]], weighted by their respective [[heat transfer coefficient]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Thermal Comfort, ASHRAE Handbook, Fundamentals, Ch. 9, pg.3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument used for assessing environmental thermal comfort in terms of operative temperature is called a eupatheoscope and was invented by A. F. Dufton in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Meteorology, American Meteorological Society, &lt; {{cite web |url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/browse?s=e&amp;p=42 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514085748/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/browse?s=e&amp;p=42 |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&gt;, accessed Sept 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematically, operative temperature can be shown as;

::&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;t_o = \frac{(h_r t_{mr} + h_c t_a)}{ h_r + h_c}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

where,

:&lt;math&gt;h_c&lt;/math&gt; = convective heat transfer coefficient
:&lt;math&gt;h_r&lt;/math&gt; = linear radiative heat transfer coefficient
:&lt;math&gt;t_a&lt;/math&gt; = air temperature
:&lt;math&gt;t_{mr}&lt;/math&gt; = mean radiant temperature

Or

::&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;t_o = \frac{(t_{mr} + (t_a \times \sqrt{10v}))}{ 1 + \sqrt{10v}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = International Standard Organization | year = 1998 | title = ISO 7726:1998 Ergonomics of the thermal environment -- Instruments for measuring physical quantities}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

where,

:&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; = air velocity
:&lt;math&gt;t_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_{mr}&lt;/math&gt; have the same meaning as above.

It is also acceptable to approximate this relationship for occupants engaged in near sedentary physical activity (with metabolic rates between 1.0 met and 1.3 met), not in direct sunlight, and not exposed to air velocities greater than 0.10 m/s (20 fpm). &lt;ref&gt;ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55-2010, Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy&lt;/ref&gt; 

::&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;t_o = \frac{(t_a + t_{mr})}{ 2 }&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;t_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_{mr}&lt;/math&gt; have the same meaning as above.

==Application==

Operative temperature is used in heat transfer and thermal comfort analysis in transportation and buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Dufton, A. F. The Equivalent Temperature of a room and its Measurement, Building Research Technical Paper No. 13. London, 1932&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Psychrometrics|psychrometric]] charts used in HVAC design only show the dry bulb temperature on the x-axis(abscissa), however, it is the operative temperature which is specified on the x-axis of the psychrometric chart illustrated in ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55 – Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human occupancy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21294">The '''Peterson Field Guides''' (PFG) are a popular and influential series of [[United States|American]] [[field guide]]s intended to assist the [[layman]] in identification of birds, plants, insects and other natural phenomena. The series was created and edited by renowned [[ornithologist]] [[Roger Tory Peterson]] (1908–1996). His inaugural volume was the classic 1934 book ''A Field Guide to the Birds'', published (as were all subsequent volumes) by the [[Houghton Mifflin Company]].

The PFG series utilized what became known as the [[Peterson Identification System]], a practical method for field identification which highlights readily noticed visual features rather than focusing on the technical features of interest to scientists.  The series both reflected and contributed to awareness of the emerging [[environmental movement]].

Most books in this series use a section of plates of drawings (usually reduced from commissioned paintings) rather than photographs of the subject species, grouped at the center of the book. This allows for idealized portraits that highlight the identifying "field marks" of each species; such field marks are often indicated by arrows or straight lines in the plate illustrations. However, in several books in this series, the plates consist of photographs (usually without such arrows or indicators), such as in the guides for the atmosphere, coral reefs, rocks and minerals, and the (old Charles Covell 1984 guide to) Eastern moths. In many books in this series (especially older editions), a number of the plates are in black and white. For examples, older editions of the Eastern reptiles/amphibians book had many black and white plates which were colorized for the current edition,&lt;ref&gt;Conant, Roger; and Collins, Joseph. A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co, 1998 pp viii, xii.&lt;/ref&gt;  and the original 1934 Eastern bird book had only 4 color plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtpi.org/a-book-collectors-guide-to-roger-tory-peterson/ |title=A Book-collector’s Guide to Roger Tory Peterson &amp;#124; Roger Tory Peterson Institute |publisher=Rtpi.org |date=2011-11-25 |accessdate=2012-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909003834/http://www.rtpi.org/a-book-collectors-guide-to-roger-tory-peterson/ |archivedate=2012-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one book (insects) was entirely in black and white. However, most newer editions are often full-color (or almost full-color) and tend to be larger. One source claims that the increased size of one of the new editions (Eastern reptiles/amphibians) was considered detrimental to its use as a field guide by its own author and was a publisher decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/78484/in_memoriam_roger_conant_19092003_with_reflections_by_some_of/ |title=In Memoriam: Roger Conant (1909-2003) With Reflections By Some of Roger's Many Friends and Colleagues - Science News |publisher=redOrbit |date=2004-08-12 |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, new "editions" in this series are entirely new books with completely new texts and illustrations. For example, the fourth edition of the mammals guide has an entirely new text and illustrations by new author Fiona Reid, because the author (William Burt) and illustrator (Richard Grossenheider) of previous editions are both deceased. In fact, Grossenheider died prior to the publication of the ''previous'' third edition of 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Burt, William H; and Grossenheider, Richard P. A Field Guide to the Mammals of North America North of Mexico. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co; 1976. p vi.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the current Northeastern moths guide by David Beadle and Seabrooke Leckie is an entirely new book than the out-of-print 1984 Eastern moths guide by Charles Covell.&lt;ref name="seabrookeleckie1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seabrookeleckie.com/the-new-peterson-moth-guide/ |title=The new Peterson moth guide |publisher=Seabrooke Leckie |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beadle/Leckie book covers a smaller geographical area and (one author claims) covers moths in greater detail.&lt;ref name="seabrookeleckie1"/&gt; The old Covell book has been out-of-print for many years, but is currently available through the Virginia Museum of Natural History (which purchased the rights to that book).&lt;ref name="seabrookeleckie1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vmnh.net/news.cfm?ID=193 |title=What's New &amp;#124; Virginia Museum of Natural History |publisher=Vmnh.net |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above situation of an old "edition" persisting alongside its intended replacement edition is not unique to the Eastern moths guide. [[George A. Petrides|George Petrides]]' 1988 Eastern trees book (PFG11B) was originally intended to replace Petrides' own 1958 Eastern tree and shrubs (PFG11A) book. However, both books remain popular and the original publisher still offers both books for sale (unlike the case of the old Eastern moths book).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmhbooks.com/peterson/plants.cfm |title=Peterson Field Guides(R)- Birds |publisher=Hmhbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences between editions can serve to indicate changes in scientific perspective as well as changes species distribution. For example, the second edition of the freshwater fishes guide by Page and Burr (2011), published 20 years after the first edition, increased the number of species included from 768 to 909, largely due to the addition of previously unrecognized species (114), as well as increased numbers of newly established exotic species (16).&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/freshwater/fieldguide.html Peterson Field Guide to Freshwater Fishes" Florida Museum of Natural History.] flmnh.ufl.edu. Retrieved 2014-08-20.&lt;/ref&gt; It also expanded coverage of marine fish commonly found in freshwater (19).

{{Sound measurements}}

'''Sound power''' or '''acoustic power''' is the rate at which [[sound energy]] is emitted, reflected, transmitted or received, per unit time.&lt;ref name=clinical&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ElPyvaJbDiwC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=sound+power+loudness&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YF0XVdbsEpOBNoeFgKgN&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sound%20power%20loudness&amp;f=false|title=Clinical Measurement of Speech and Voice|author=Ronald J. Baken, Robert F. Orlikoff|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2000|isbn=9781565938694|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of sound power is the [[watt]] (W).&lt;ref name=clinical/&gt; It is the power of the sound force on a surface of the medium of propagation of the sound wave. For a sound source, unlike [[sound pressure]], sound power is neither room-dependent nor distance-dependent. Sound pressure is a property of the field at a point in space, while sound power is a property of a sound source, equal to the total power emitted by that source in all directions. Sound power passing through an area is sometimes called '''sound flux''' or '''acoustic flux''' through that area.

The [[A-weighting]] scale is used in the calculation as the regulation is concerned with the loudness as perceived by the human ear. Measurements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blog.nti-audio.com/measurement/eu-sound-power-regulation-vacuum-cleaners | title = EU Sound Power Regulation for Vacuum Cleaners | publisher = [NTi Audio] | accessdate = 22 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are taken at several defined points around the device.

The test environment can be located indoors or outdoors. The ideal environment is on the ground in a large open space or hemi-anechoic chamber (free-field over a reflecting plane). To account for undesired [[Reverberation|reflections]] from nearby objects, walls, and the ceiling, and for any residual [[Environmental noise|background noises]], measurement corrections are applied.

==Mathematical definition==
Sound power, denoted ''P'', is defined by&lt;ref&gt;Landau &amp; Lifshitz, "Fluid Mechanics", Course of Theoretical Physics, Vol. 6&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P = \mathbf f \cdot \mathbf v = Ap\, \mathbf u \cdot \mathbf v = Apv&lt;/math&gt;
where
*'''f''' is the sound force of unit vector '''u''';
*'''v''' is the [[particle velocity]] of projection ''v'' along '''u''';
*''A'' is the area;
*''p'' is the [[sound pressure]].

In a [[Transmission medium|medium]], the sound power is given by
:&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{A p^2}{\rho c} \cos \theta,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''A'' is the area of the surface;
*''ρ'' is the [[mass density]];
*''c'' is the [[sound velocity]];
*''θ'' is the angle between the direction of propagation of the sound and the normal to the surface.

For example, a sound at SPL = 85&amp;nbsp;dB or ''p'' = 0.356 Pa in air (''ρ'' = 1.2&amp;nbsp;kg·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; and ''c'' = 343 m·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) through a surface of area ''A'' = 1 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; normal to the direction of propagation (''θ'' = 0 °) has a sound energy flux ''P'' = 0.3&amp;nbsp;mW.

This is the parameter one would be interested in when converting noise back into usable energy, along with any losses in the capturing device.

==Relationships with other quantities==
Sound power is related to [[sound intensity]]:
:&lt;math&gt;P = AI,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''A'' is the area;
*''I'' is the sound intensity.

Sound power is related [[sound energy density]]:
:&lt;math&gt;P = Acw,&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''c'' is the [[speed of sound]];
*''w'' is the sound energy density.

==Sound power level definition==
{{Other uses|Sound level (disambiguation){{!}}Sound level}}
'''Sound power level''' (SWL) or '''acoustic power level''' is a [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|logarithmic measure]] of the power of a sound relative to a reference value.&lt;br&gt;
Sound power level, denoted ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''W''&lt;/sub&gt; and measured in [[Decibel|dB]], is defined by&lt;ref name=IEC60027-3&gt;[http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/artnum/028981 "Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology – Part 3: Logarithmic and related quantities, and their units"], ''IEC 60027-3 Ed. 3.0'', International Electrotechnical Commission, 19 July 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L_W = \frac{1}{2} \ln\!\left(\frac{P}{P_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{Np} = \log_{10}\!\left(\frac{P}{P_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{B} = 10 \log_{10}\!\left(\frac{P}{P_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{dB},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''P'' is the sound power;
*''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''reference sound power'';
*{{no break|1=1 Np = 1}} is the [[neper]];
*{{no break|1=1 B = {{sfrac|2}} ln 10}} is the [[Decibel|bel]];
*{{no break|1=1 dB = {{sfrac|20}} ln 10 }} is the [[decibel]].

The commonly used reference sound power in air is&lt;ref&gt;Ross Roeser, Michael Valente, ''Audiology: Diagnosis'' (Thieme 2007), p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P_0 = 1~\mathrm{pW}.&lt;/math&gt;
The proper notations for sound power level using this reference are {{nobreak|''L''&lt;sub&gt;''W''/(1 pW)&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{nobreak|''L''&lt;sub&gt;''W''&lt;/sub&gt; (re 1 pW)}}, but the suffix notations {{nobreak|dB SWL}}, {{nobreak|dB(SWL)}}, dBSWL, or dB&lt;sub&gt;SWL&lt;/sub&gt; are very common, even if they are not accepted by the SI.&lt;ref name=NIST2008&gt;Thompson, A. and Taylor, B. N. sec 8.7, "Logarithmic quantities and units: level, neper, bel", ''Guide for the Use of the International System of Units (SI) 2008 Edition'', NIST Special Publication 811, 2nd printing (November 2008), SP811 [http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/sp811.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

The reference sound power ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is defined as the sound power with the reference sound intensity {{nowrap|1=''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 pW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} passing through a surface of area {{nowrap|1=''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}:
:&lt;math&gt;P_0 = A_0 I_0,&lt;/math&gt;
hence the reference value {{nowrap|1=''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 pW}}.

===Relationship with sound pressure level===
The generic calculation of sound power from sound pressure is as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;L_W = L_p + 10 \log_{10}\!\left(\frac{A_S}{A_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{dB},&lt;/math&gt;
where:
&lt;math&gt;{A_S}&lt;/math&gt; defines the area of a surface that wholly encompasses the source.  This surface may be any shape, but it must fully enclose the source. 
 
In the case of a sound source located in free field positioned over a reflecting plane (i.e. the ground), in air at ambient temperature, the sound power level at distance ''r'' from the sound source is approximately related to [[sound pressure level]] (SPL)  by&lt;ref name=Chadderton&gt;Chadderton, David V. ''Building services engineering'', pp. 301, 306, 309, 322. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004. {{ISBN|0-415-31535-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L_W = L_p + 10 \log_{10}\!\left(\frac{2\pi r^2}{A_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{dB},&lt;/math&gt;
where
*''L''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is the sound pressure level;
*''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;;
*&lt;math&gt; {2\pi r^2},&lt;/math&gt; defines the surface area of a hemisphere; and 
*''r'' must be sufficient that the hemisphere fully encloses the source.

Derivation of this equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
L_W &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \ln\!\left(\frac{P}{P_0}\right)\\
        &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \ln\!\left(\frac{AI}{A_0 I_0}\right)\\
        &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \ln\!\left(\frac{I}{I_0}\right) + \frac{1}{2} \ln\!\left(\frac{A}{A_0}\right)\!.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
For a ''progressive'' spherical wave,
:&lt;math&gt;z_0 = \frac{p}{v},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A = 4\pi r^2,&lt;/math&gt; (the surface area of sphere)
where ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Acoustic impedance#Characteristic specific acoustic impedance|characteristic specific acoustic impedance]].

Consequently,
:&lt;math&gt;I = pv = \frac{p^2}{z_0},&lt;/math&gt;
and since by definition {{nobreak|1=''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where {{nobreak|1=''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 20 μPa}} is the reference sound pressure,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
L_W &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \ln\!\left(\frac{p^2}{p_0^2}\right) + \frac{1}{2} \ln\!\left(\frac{4\pi r^2}{A_0}\right)\\
        &amp;= \ln\!\left(\frac{p}{p_0}\right) + \frac{1}{2} \ln\!\left(\frac{4\pi r^2}{A_0}\right)\\
        &amp;= L_p + 10 \log_{10}\!\left(\frac{4\pi r^2}{A_0}\right)\!~\mathrm{dB}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The sound power estimated practically does not depend on distance. The sound pressure used in the calculation may be affected by distance due to viscous effects in the propagation of sound unless this is accounted for.

=== Matrix Converter===
[[Matrix converter]] is a device which converts AC input supply to the required variable AC supply as output without any intermediate conversion process whereas in case of Inverter  which converts AC - DC - AC which takes more extra components as diode rectifiers, filters, charge-up circuit but not needed those in case of matrix converters

Characteristics of the Sparse Matrix Converter topology are 15 Transistors, 18 Diodes, and 7 Isolated Driver Potentials. Compared to the [[Direct matrix converter]] this topology provides identical functionality, but with a reduced number of power switches and the option of employing an improved zero DC-link current commutation scheme, which provides lower control complexity and higher safety and reliability.

===Very Sparse Matrix Converter===
[[Image:Very sparse matrix.jpg|thumb|Fig 2: Topology of the very-sparse matrix.]]
Characteristics of the Very Sparse Matrix Converter topology are 12 Transistors, 30 Diodes, and 10 Isolated Driver Potentials. There are no limitations in functionality compared to the Direct Matrix Converter and Sparse Matrix Converter. Compared to the Sparse Matrix Converter there are fewer transistors but higher conduction losses due to the increased number of diodes in the conduction paths.

===Ultra Sparse Matrix Converter===
[[Image:Ultra sparse matrix.jpg|thumb|Fig 3: Topology of the ultra-sparse matrix.]]
Characteristics of the Ultra Sparse Matrix Converter topology are 9 Transistors, 18 Diodes, and 7 Isolated Driver Potentials. The significant limitation of this converter topology compared to the Sparse Matrix Converter is the restriction of its maximal phase displacement between input voltage and input current which is restricted to ± 30°.

===Multi-Step Commutation===
[[Image:Multistep commutation of sm.jpg|thumb|Fig 4: Multistep commutation of the Sparse Matrix Converter rectifier input stage.]]
This is a commutation scheme, depicted in Fig. 4.   For a given switching state of the rectifier input stage, the commutation of the inverter output stage has to be performed in an identical manner to the commutation of a conventional voltage dc-link converter. The basic structure of the commutating bridge legs of the Sparse Matrix Converter is shown in Fig. 4(a). The switch sequence to change the connection of the positive dc-link voltage bus p from input a to input b is shown in Fig. 4(b) and Fig. 4(c). In Fig. 4(b) the assumption is current-independent commutation with uab &gt; 0. In Fig. 4(c) the assumption is voltage-independent commutation with i &gt; 0.  

A dead time between the turn-off and turn-on of the power transistors of a bridge leg has to be implemented in order to avoid a short circuit of the dc-link voltage. To change the switching state of the Sparse Matrix Converter rectifier input stage for a given inverter switching state, one has to make sure that there is no bidirectional connection between any two input lines. This guarantees that no short-circuiting of an input line-to-line voltage can occur. Additionally a current path must be continuously provided. Therefore multistep commutation schemes, using voltage independent and current independent commutation as known for the Conventional Direct Matrix Converter 
&lt;ref&gt;P. Wheeler, J. Rodriguez, J. Clare, L. Empringham, A. Weinstein, “Matrix converters: A technology review”, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, Vol. 49, No. 2, pp. 276–288, Apr. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
, can be employed.

===Zero DC Link Current Commutation===
[[Image:Zero dc link commutation.jpg|thumb|Fig 5: Zero DC link current commutation shown for the Sparse Matrix Converter.]]
The drawback of the multistep commutation describe before is its complexity. Indirect matrix converters like the Sparse Matrix Converter provide a degree of control freedom that is not available for the Conventional Direct Matrix Converter. This can be used to simplify the complex commutation problem. It has been proposed &lt;ref&gt;J. Holtz, U. Boelkens, “Direct frequency converter with sinusoidal line currents for speed-variable ac motors”, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, Vol. 36, No. 4, pp. 475 – 478, Nov. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; to switch the inverter stage into a free-wheeling state, and then to commutate the rectifier stage with zero dc-link current. This is shown in Fig. 5. 

Fig. 5(a) shows the control of the power transistors in one bridge leg of the Sparse Matrix Converter. Fig. 5(b) shows the switching state sequence where s0; s7 = 1 indicates free-wheeling operation of the inverter stage. Furthermore, the dc-link current i is shown. 

The zero DC link current commutation scheme gives the additional benefit of a reduction in the switching losses of the input stage. One only has to ensure that no overlapping of turn-on intervals of power transistors in a bridge half occurs, because this would result in a short circuit of an input line-to-line voltage. 

[[Image:Characteristic voltages sparse matrix.jpg|thumb|Fig 6: Characteristic voltages and currents and switching states of the Sparse Matrix Converter during on-switching period.]]

Fig 6 shows the formation of the dc-link voltage u and dc-link current i within one switching period 
Furthermore, it shows as an example the switching functions of the rectifier and inverter stage for &lt;math&gt;\phi_1&lt;/math&gt; in interval &lt;math&gt;(0...\pi/6)&lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt;\phi_2&lt;/math&gt; in interval &lt;math&gt;(0 . . . \pi/6)&lt;/math&gt;. Input stage switching occurs at zero dc-link current. The dc-link current has a constant average value &lt;math&gt;\bar{i}&lt;/math&gt; within &lt;math&gt;\tau_{ac}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;. The switching state functions are given as &lt;math&gt;s_A, s_B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;s_C&lt;/math&gt;. The switching frequency ripple of &lt;math&gt;u_{ac} , u_{ab} , i_A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i_C&lt;/math&gt; is neglected

[[File:SIPs panel sample.PNG|thumb|SIPs are most commonly made of OSB panels sandwiched around a foam core made of polystyrene.]]
A '''structural insulated panel''', or '''structural insulating panel''', ('''SIP'''), is a form of [[sandwich panel]] used in the [[construction]] industry.

SIP is a [[sandwich structured composite]], consisting of an insulating layer of rigid core sandwiched between two layers of structural board, used as a [[building material]]. The board can be sheet metal, plywood, cement, [[Magnesium oxide wallboard|magnesium oxide board]] (MgO) or [[oriented strand board]] (OSB) and the core either expanded [[polystyrene|polystyrene foam]] (EPS), [[extruded polystyrene]] foam (XPS), [[polyisocyanurate]] foam, [[Polyurethane uses|polyurethane foam]] or [[composite honeycomb]] (HSC).

SIPs share the same structural properties as an I-beam or I-column. The rigid insulation core of the SIP acts as a web, while the sheathing fulfills the function of the flanges. SIPs combine several components of conventional building, such as studs and joists, insulation, vapor barrier and air barrier. They can be used for many different applications, such as exterior wall, roof, floor and foundation systems.

== History ==
[[File:J-Deck Inc.SIP.jpg|thumb|upright|Standard OSB with EPS core Structural Insulated Panel]]
Although foam-core panels gained attention in the 1970s, the idea of using stress skinned panels for construction began in the 1930s. Research and testing of the technology was done primarily by [[Forest Products Laboratory]] (FPL) in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] as part of a [[U.S. Forest Service]] attempt to conserve forest resources. In 1937, a small stressed-skin house was constructed and garnered enough attention to bring in [[First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] to dedicate the house. In a testament to the durability of such panel structures, it has endured the severe Wisconsin climate and was used by [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] as a day care center up until 1998 when it was removed to make way for a new Pharmacy School building. With the success of the stress skinned panels, it was suggested stronger skins could take all of the structural load and eliminate the frame altogether.

Thus in 1947, structural insulated panel development began when corrugated paperboard cores were tested with various skin materials of plywood, tempered hardboard and treated paperboard. The building was dismantled in 1978 and most of the panels retained their original strength with the exception of paperboard which is unsuited to outdoor exposure. Panels consisting of polystyrene core and paper overlaid with plywood skins were used in a building in 1967 and the panels have performed well to the present day.

SIP systems were used by Woods Constructors of Santa Paula, California in their homes and apartments from 1965 until 1984. This work was the basis for John Thomas Woods, Paul Flather Woods, John David Woods, and Frederick Thomas Woods when they used a similar concept to patent the Footing Form for Modular homes (US Patent #4817353) issued on April 4, 1989. Numerous homes in Santa Paula, Fillmore, Palm Springs, and surrounding areas use SIP panels as the primary method of construction. The design was awarded approval from (then) ICBO and SBCCI, now ICC.

== Materials ==
SIPs are most commonly made of OSB panels sandwiched around a foam core made of expanded polystyrene (EPS), extruded polystyrene (XPS) or rigid polyurethane foam. Other materials can be used in replacement of OSB, such as plywood, pressure-treated plywood for below-grade foundation walls, steel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://greenhome-supply.com/docs/sips/Engineering%20and%20Architectural%20Design%20Guidelines.pdf http://greenhome-supply.com/docs/sips/Engineering%20and%20Architectural%20Design%20Guidelines.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; {{dead link|date=October 2018}}aluminum, [[cement board]] such as Hardiebacker, and even exotic materials like stainless steel, fiber-reinforced plastic, and magnesium oxide. Some SIPs use [[Fiber cement siding|fiber-cement]] or plywood sheets for the panels, and agricultural fiber, such as wheat straw, for the core.

The third component in SIPs is the spline or connector piece between SIP panels.  Dimensional lumber is commonly used but creates thermal bridging and lowers insulation values.  To maintain higher insulation values through the spline, manufacturers use Insulated Lumber, Composite Splines, Mechanical Locks, Overlapping OSB Panels, or other creative methods.  Depending on the method selected, other advantages such as full nailing surfaces or increased structural strength may become available.

== Methods of manufacturing ==
{{unreferenced|date=May 2018}}
SIP's are most often manufactured in a traditional factory. Processing equipment is used to regulate pressures and heat in a uniform and consistent manner. There are two main processing methods which correspond to the materials used for the SIP Panel core.  When manufacturing a panel with a polystyrene core both pressure and heat are required to ensure the bonding glue has penetrated and set completely. Although a number of variations exist, in general, the foam core is first covered with an adhesive and the skin is set in place.  The three pieces are set into a large clamping device and pressure and heat are applied.  The three pieces must stay in the clamping device until the glue has cured.

When manufacturing a panel with a polyurethane core pressure and heat are both generated from the expansion of the foam during the foaming process.  The skins are set in a large clamping device which functions as a mold.  The skins must be held apart from each other to allow the liquid polyurethane materials to flow into the device.  Once in the device, the foam begins to rise.  The mold/press is generally configured to withstand the heat and the pressures generated from the chemical foaming.  The SIP Panel is left in the mold/press to cure slightly and when removed will continue to cure for several days.

Until recently, both of these processes required a factory setting. However, recent advancements have presented an alternative with SIP Panel processing equipment that allows SIP Panels to be manufactured on the job-site. This is welcome news for builders in developing countries where the technology may be best suited to reduce greenhouse emissions and improve sustainability in housing but are unavailable.

== Benefits and drawbacks ==
The use of SIPs brings many benefits and some drawbacks compared to a conventional framed building.

The cost of SIPs are higher than the materials for a comparable framed building in the United States; however, this may not be true elsewhere. A well-built home using SIPs will have a tighter building envelope and the walls will have higher insulating properties, which leads to fewer draughts and a decrease in operating costs. Also, due to the standardized and all-in-one nature of SIPs, construction time can be less than for a frame home, as well as requiring fewer tradespeople. The panels can be used as floor, wall, and roof, with the use of the panels as floors being of particular benefit when used above an uninsulated space below. As a result, the total life-cycle cost of a SIP-constructed building will, in general, be lower than for a conventional framed one—by as much as 40%. Whether the total construction cost (materials and labor) is lower than for conventional framing appears to depend on the circumstances, including local labor conditions and the degree to which the building design is optimized for one or the other technology.

An OSB skinned system structurally outperforms conventional stick framed construction in some cases; primarily in axial load strength.  SIPs maintain similar versatility to stick framed houses when incorporating custom designs.  Also, since SIPs work as framing, insulation, and exterior sheathing, and can come precut from the factory for the specific job, the exterior building envelope can be built quite quickly. SIPs panels also tend to be lightweight and compact which aids this offsite construction. The environmental performance of SIPs, moreover, is very good due to their exceptional thermal insulation. They also offer a resistance to damp and cold problems like compression shrinkage and cold bridging that cannot be matched by timber and more traditional building materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.green-modular.com/blog/structural-insulated-panels/|title=Structural Insulated Panels {{!}} Green Modular|website=Green Modular|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When tested under laboratory conditions, the SIP, included in a wall, foundation, floor, or roof system, is installed in a steady-state (no air infiltration) environment; systems incorporating fiberglass insulation are not installed in steady-state environments as they require ventilation to remove moisture.

With the exception of structural metals, such as steel, all structural materials [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] over time. In the case of SIPs, the creep potential of OSB faced SIPs with EPS or polyurethane foam cores has been studied and creep design recommendations exist.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.B, Manbeck, H.B, Janowiak, J.J, Hiltunum, D.R. "Modeling Structural Insulated Panel (SIP) Flexural Creep Deflection." J. Structural Engineering, Vol. 123, No. 12, December, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Using NTA Listing Report Data 2009"&gt;3NTA IM 14 TIP 01, Engineered Design Guide Using NTA Listing Report Data. NTA, Inc. Nappanee, IN. 3/19/2009, 12 pg.&lt;/ref&gt;  The long-term effects of using unconventional facing and core materials require material specific testing to quantify creep design values.

== Dimensions and characteristics ==
In the United States, SIPs tend to come in sizes from 4 feet (1.22&amp;nbsp;m) to 24 feet (7.32&amp;nbsp;m) in width. Elsewhere, typical product dimensions are 300, 600, or 1,200&amp;nbsp;mm wide and 2.4, 2.7, and 3&amp;nbsp;m long, with roof SIPs up to 6&amp;nbsp;m long. Smaller sections ease transportation and handling, but the use of the largest panel possible will create the best insulated building. At 15−20&amp;nbsp;kg/m², longer panels can become difficult to handle without the use of a crane to position them, and this is a consideration that must be taken into account due to cost and site limitations. Also of note is that when needed for special circumstances longer spans can often be requested, such as for a long roof span. Typical U.S. height for panels is eight or nine feet (2.44 to 2.75 m). Panels come in widths ranging from 4 to 12&amp;nbsp;inches thick and a rough cost is $4–$6/ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenwall.us/services.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430194053/http://www.greenwall.us/services.php |archivedate=2011-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 4Q 2010, new methods of forming radius, sine curve, arches and tubular SIPs were commercialized.  Due to the custom nature and technical difficulty of forming and curing specialty shapes, pricing is typically three or four times that of standard panels per foot.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cowleytimberwork.co.uk/CurvedPanels.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earthcoresips.com/42-2/sip-radius-panels/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[polystyrene|EPS]] is the most common of the foams used and has an [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]] ([[thermal resistance]]) of about 4 K·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/W per 25&amp;nbsp;mm thickness, which would give the {{convert|3.5|in|mm}} of foam in a {{convert|4.5|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick}} panel an R value of 13.8 (caution:  extrapolating R-values over thickness may be imprecise due to non-linear thermal properties of most materials). This at face value appears to be comparable to an R-13 batt of fiberglass, but because in a standard stick frame house there is significantly more wall containing low R value wood that acts as a cold bridge, the thermal performance of the R-13.8 SIP wall will be considerably better.

The air sealing features of SIP homes resulted in the Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Star program to establish an inspection protocol in lieu of the typically required blower door test to assess the home's air leakage.  This serves to speed the process and save the builder/homeowner money.

== Standardization and design ==
[[Image:Prefabricated house construction.gif|thumb|right|Construction of a [[prefabricated building|prefabricated]] [[modular building|modular house]] ([[:Image:Prefabricated house construction.ogg|Click here for a time-lapse video]])]] 
The International Building Code references APA, Plywood Design Specification 4—Design &amp; Fabrication of Plywood Sandwich Panels for the design of SIPs.&lt;ref&gt;APA. Plywood Design Specification Supplement 4: Design and Fabrication of Plywood Sandwich Panels. Document U814-H. March 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; This document addressed the basic engineering mechanics of SIP panels but does not provide design properties for the panels provided by any specific manufacturer. In 2007, prescriptive design provisions for OSB faced SIPs were first introduced in the 2006 International Residential Code. These provisions provide guidance on the use of SIPs as walls panels only.

Aside from these non-proprietary standards, the SIP industry has relied heavily on proprietary code evaluation reports. In early 2009, SIPA partnered with [[NTA Inc]], a product certification agency, to produce the first industry wide code report which is available to all SIPA members who qualify. Unlike previous code reports, the prescriptive provisions provided in the SIPA code report are derived from an engineering design methodology which permits the design professional to consider loading conditions not addressed in the code report.&lt;ref name="Using NTA Listing Report Data 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://online.ntainc.com/public/certification/reports/report/?ID=7ae06f12-ef2a-4c8c-b5bb-95c32ae20839 SIPA code report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620063935/http://www.sips.org/content/index.cfm?pageId=272 |date=2009-06-20 }} SIPA code report requirements at SIPA web site&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==

The geometry of the tetrafluoroammonium ion is [[tetrahedral molecular geometry|tetrahedral]], with an estimated nitrogen-fluorine bond length of 124&amp;nbsp;[[Picometre|pm]]. All fluorine atoms are in equivalent positions.&lt;ref name="sykes1" /&gt;

== Synthesis ==

Tetrafluoroammonium salts are prepared by oxidising [[nitrogen trifluoride]] with [[fluorine]] in the presence of a strong [[Lewis acid]] which acts as a [[fluoride]] ion acceptor. The original synthesis by Tolberg, Rewick, Stringham, and Hill in 1966 employs [[antimony pentafluoride]] as the Lewis acid:&lt;ref name="sykes1" /&gt;

: {{chem|NF|3}} + {{chem|F|2}} + {{chem|SbF|5}} → {{chem|NF|4|SbF|6}}

The hexafluoroarsenate salt was also prepared by a similar reaction with [[arsenic pentafluoride]] at 120&amp;nbsp;°C:&lt;ref name="sykes1" /&gt;

The reaction of nitrogen trifluoride with fluorine and [[boron trifluoride]] at 800&amp;nbsp;°C yields the tetrafluoroborate salt:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{chem|NF|4|+}} salts can also be prepared by fluorination of {{chem|NF|3}} with [[krypton difluoride]] ({{chem|KrF|2}}) and fluorides of the form {{chem|MF|''n''}}, where M is Sb, Nb, Pt, Ti, or B.

Many tetrafluoroammonium salts can be prepared with [[Salt metathesis reaction|metathesis reactions]].

== Reactions ==

Tetrafluoroammonium salts are extremely [[hygroscopic]]. The {{chem|NF|4|+}} ion is readily [[hydrolysis|hydrolysed]] into nitrogen trifluoride, [[Fluoronium|{{chem|H|2|F|+}}]], and [[oxygen]] gas:

:2 {{chem|NF|4|+}} + 2 {{chem|H|2|O}} → 2 {{chem|NF|3}} + 2 {{chem|H|2|F|+}} + {{chem|O|2}}

Some [[hydrogen peroxide]] ({{chem|H|2|O|2}}) is also formed during this process.&lt;ref name="sykes1" /&gt;

Reaction of {{chem|NF|4|+|SbF|6|-}} with [[alkali metal]] nitrates yields [[fluorine nitrate]], {{chem|FONO|2}}.&lt;ref name="hoge" /&gt;

==Properties==
Because tetrafluoroammonium salts are destroyed by water, it cannot be used as a solvent.  Instead anhydrous [[hydrogen fluoride]] or [[bromine pentafluoride]] can be used as a solvent to dissolve these salts.&lt;ref name="Sykes1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sykes|first=A. G.|title=Advances in Inorganic Chemistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qzN5pnPwuaoC&amp;pg=PA154|accessdate=22 June 2014|date=1989-07-17|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780080578828|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tetrafluoroammonium salts usually have no colour.  However some are coloured due to other metals in them. Red salts include {{chem|(|NF|4|+|)|2|CrF|6|2-}}, {{chem|(|NF|4|+|)|2|NiF|6|2-}} and {{chem|(|NF|4|+|)|2|PtF|6|2-}}. {{chem|(|NF|4|+|)|2|MnF|6|2-}}, {{chem|NF|4|+|UF|7|-}}, {{chem|NF|4|+|UOF|5|-}} and {{chem|NF|4|+|XeF|7|-}} are yellow.&lt;ref name="Sykes1989"/&gt;

== Applications ==
{{chem|NF|4|+}} salts are important for solid propellant {{chem|NF|3|&amp;ndash;F|2}} gas generators. They are also used as reagents for [[electrophilic fluorination]] of aromatic compounds in [[organic chemistry]].&lt;ref name="sykes1"&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9488">[[File:Drini-conjugatehyperbolas.svg|thumb|right|The unit hyperbola is blue, its conjugate is green, and the asymptotes are red.]]
In [[geometry]], the '''unit hyperbola''' is the set of points (''x,y'') in the [[Cartesian plane]] that satisfy the [[implicit equation]] &lt;math&gt; x^2 - y^2 = 1 .&lt;/math&gt; In the study of [[indefinite orthogonal group]]s, the unit hyperbola forms the basis for an ''alternative radial length''
: &lt;math&gt;r = \sqrt {x^2 - y^2} .&lt;/math&gt;
Whereas the [[unit circle]] surrounds its center, the unit hyperbola requires the ''conjugate hyperbola'' &lt;math&gt;y^2 - x^2 = 1 &lt;/math&gt; to complement it in the plane. This pair of hyperbolas share the [[asymptote]]s  ''y'' = ''x''  and  ''y'' = &amp;minus;''x''. When the conjugate of the unit hyperbola is in use, the alternative radial length is &lt;math&gt;r = \sqrt {y^2 - x^2} . &lt;/math&gt;

The unit hyperbola is a special case of the [[rectangular hyperbola]], with a particular [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]], [[translation (geometry)|location]], and [[Scaling (geometry)|scale]]. As such, its [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] equals &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Weisstein]] [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RectangularHyperbola.html Rectangular hyperbola] from Wolfram Mathworld&lt;/ref&gt;

The unit hyperbola finds applications where the circle must be replaced with the hyperbola for purposes of analytic geometry. A prominent instance is the depiction of [[spacetime]] as a [[pseudo-Euclidean space]]. There the asymptotes of the unit hyperbola form a [[light cone]]. Further, the attention to areas of [[hyperbolic sector]]s by [[Gregoire de Saint-Vincent]] led to the logarithm function and the modern parametrization of the hyperbola by sector areas. When the notions of conjugate hyperbolas and hyperbolic angles are understood, then the classical [[complex number]]s, which are built around the unit circle, can be replaced with numbers built around the unit hyperbola.

==Asymptotes==
{{main|Asymptote}}
Generally asymptotic lines to a curve are said to converge toward the curve. In [[algebraic geometry]] and the theory of [[algebraic curves]] there is a different approach to asymptotes.  The curve is first interpreted in the [[projective plane]] using [[homogeneous coordinates]]. Then the asymptotes are lines that are tangent to the projective curve at a [[point at infinity]], thus circumventing any need for a distance concept and convergence.  In a common framework (''x, y, z'') are homogeneous coordinates with the [[line at infinity]] determined by the equation ''z'' = 0. For instance, C. G. Gibson wrote:&lt;ref&gt;C.G. Gibson (1998) ''Elementary Geometry of Algebraic Curves'', p 159, [[Cambridge University Press]] {{isbn|0-521-64140-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:For  the standard rectangular hyperbola &lt;math&gt;f = x^2 - y^2 -1&lt;/math&gt; in ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the corresponding projective curve is &lt;math&gt;F = x^2 - y^2 - z^2,&lt;/math&gt; which meets ''z'' = 0 at the points ''P'' = (1 : 1 : 0) and ''Q'' = (1 : &amp;minus;1 : 0). Both ''P'' and ''Q'' are [[zero (complex analysis)#Multiplicity of a zero|simple]] on ''F'', with tangents  ''x'' + ''y'' = 0, ''x'' &amp;minus; ''y'' = 0; thus we recover the familiar 'asymptotes' of elementary geometry.

==Minkowski diagram==
{{main|Minkowski diagram}}
The Minkowski diagram is drawn in a spacetime plane where the spatial aspect has been restricted to a single dimension. The units of distance and time on such a plane are 
* units of 30 centimetres length and [[nanosecond]]s, or
* [[astronomical unit]]s and intervals of 8 minutes and 20 seconds, or
* [[light year]]s and [[year]]s.
Each of these scales of coordinates results in [[photon]] connections of events along diagonal lines of [[slope]] plus or minus one.
Five elements constitute the diagram [[Hermann Minkowski]] used to describe the relativity transformations: the unit hyperbola, its conjugate hyperbola, the axes of the hyperbola, a diameter of the unit hyperbola, and the [[conjugate diameters|conjugate diameter]].
The plane with the axes refers to a resting [[frame of reference]]. The diameter of the unit hyperbola represents a frame of reference in motion with [[rapidity]] ''a'' where tanh ''a'' = ''y''/''x'' and (''x'',''y'') is the endpoint of the diameter on the unit hyperbola. The conjugate diameter represents the ''spatial hyperplane of simultaneity'' corresponding to rapidity ''a''.
In this context the unit hyperbola is a ''calibration hyperbola''&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony French]] (1968) ''Special Relativity'', page 83, [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.G.V. Rosser (1964) ''Introduction to the Theory of Relativity'', figure 6.4, page 256, London: [[Butterworths]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Commonly in relativity study the hyperbola with vertical axis is taken as primary:
:The arrow of time goes from the bottom to top of the figure — a convention adopted by [[Richard Feynman]] in his famous diagrams. Space is represented by planes perpendicular to the time axis. The here and now is a singularity in the middle.&lt;ref&gt;A.P. French (1989) "Learning from the past; Looking to the future", acceptance speech for 1989 [[Oersted Medal]], [[American Journal of Physics]] 57(7):587&amp;ndash;92&lt;/ref&gt;
The vertical time axis convention stems from Minkowski in 1908, and
is also illustrated on page 48 of Eddington's ''The Nature of the Physical World'' (1928).

==Parametrization==
{{main|Hyperbolic angle}}
[[Image:Hyperbolic functions-2.svg|thumb|296px|right|The branches of the unit hyperbola evolve as the points &lt;math&gt;(\cosh a, \sinh a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(-\cosh a, -\sinh a)&lt;/math&gt; depending on the hyperbolic angle parameter &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.]]

A direct way to parameterizing the unit hyperbola starts with the hyperbola ''xy'' = 1 parameterized with the [[exponential function]]: &lt;math&gt;( e^t, \ e^{-t}).&lt;/math&gt;

This hyperbola is transformed into the unit hyperbola by a [[linear mapping]] having the matrix &lt;math&gt;A = \tfrac {1}{2}\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; -1 \end{pmatrix}\ :&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(e^t, \ e^{-t}) \ A = (\frac{e^t + e^{-t}}{2},\ \frac{e^t - e^{-t}}{2}) = (\cosh t,\ \sinh t).&lt;/math&gt;

This parameter ''t'' is '''hyperbolic angle''', which is the [[argument of a function|argument]] of the [[hyperbolic function]]s.

One finds an early expression of the parametrized unit hyperbola in [[Elements of Dynamic]] (1878) by [[William Kingdon Clifford|W. K. Clifford]]. He describes quasi-harmonic motion in a hyperbola as follows:
:The motion &lt;math&gt;\rho = \alpha \cosh(nt + \epsilon) + \beta \sinh(nt + \epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; has some curious analogies to elliptic harmonic motion. ... The acceleration &lt;math&gt;\ddot{\rho} = n^2 \rho \ ;&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; thus it is always proportional to the distance from the centre, as in elliptic harmonic motion, but directed ''away'' from the centre.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Kingdon Clifford]] (1878) [http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=math;cc=math;view=toc;subview=short;idno=04370002 Elements of Dynamic], pages 89 &amp; 90, London: MacMillan &amp; Co; on-line presentation by [[Cornell University]] ''Historical Mathematical Monographs''&lt;/ref&gt;

As a particular [[conic section|conic]], the hyperbola can be parametrized by the process of addition of points on a conic. The following description 
was given by Russian analysts:
:Fix a point ''E'' on the conic. Consider the points at which the straight line drawn through ''E'' parallel to ''AB'' intersects the conic a second time to be the ''sum of the points A and B''.
:For the hyperbola &lt;math&gt;x^2 - y^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt; with the fixed point ''E'' = (1,0) the sum of the points &lt;math&gt;(x_1,\ y_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(x_2,\ y_2)&lt;/math&gt; is the point &lt;math&gt;(x_1 x_2 + y_1 y_2,\ y_ 1 x_2 + y_2 x_1 )&lt;/math&gt; under the parametrization &lt;math&gt;x = \cosh \ t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y = \sinh \ t&lt;/math&gt; this addition corresponds to the addition of the parameter ''t''.&lt;ref&gt;Viktor Prasolov &amp; Yuri Solovyev (1997) ''Elliptic Functions and Elliptic Integrals'', page one, Translations of Mathematical Monographs volume 170, [[American Mathematical Society]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complex plane algebra==
{{main|Split-complex number}}
Whereas the unit circle is associated with [[complex number]]s, the unit hyperbola is key to the ''split-complex number plane'' consisting of ''z'' = ''x'' + ''yj'', where ''j'' &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = +1.
Then ''jz = y + xj'',  so the action of ''j'' on the plane is to swap the coordinates. In particular, this action swaps the unit hyperbola with its conjugate and swaps pairs of [[conjugate diameters]] of the hyperbolas.

In terms of the hyperbolic angle parameter ''a'', the unit hyperbola consists of points
:&lt;math&gt;\pm(\cosh a + j \sinh a) &lt;/math&gt;, where ''j'' = (0,1).
The right branch of the unit hyperbola corresponds to the positive coefficient. In fact, this branch is the image of the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] acting on the ''j''-axis. Since
:&lt;math&gt; \exp(aj) \exp(bj) = \exp((a+b)j)&lt;/math&gt;,
the branch is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under multiplication. Unlike the [[circle group]], this unit hyperbola group is ''not'' [[compact space|compact]].
Similar to the ordinary complex plane, a point not on the diagonals has a [[polar decomposition#Alternative planar decompositions|polar decomposition]] using the parametrization of the unit hyperbola and the alternative radial length.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2793">'''Vortex power''' is a form of [[hydro power]] which generates energy by placing obstacles in rivers/oceans in order to cause the formation of [[vortices]] which can then be tapped to a usable form of energy such as electricity. This method is pioneered by a team at the [[University of Michigan]] who call the technology VIVACE which stands for Vortex Induced Vibrations Aquatic Clean Energy (patent pending through the University of Michigan).

The company ''Vortex Hydro Power'' has been created to commercialize the technology. This technology has 10–20 years life span which meets life cycle cost targets.

== Environmental impacts ==
As of right now, this technology seems to be nonpolluting and low maintenance, it does not have any major impact on the wildlife such as fish and other animals. This [[environmentally friendly]] technology is still in research stage and is currently undergoing optimization experiments before it can be implemented.
