      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5237">The term '''''[[abstraction]]''''' has a number of uses in the field of [[linguistics]]. It can denote a process (also called '''object abstraction''') in the development of language, whereby terms become used for concepts further removed from the objects to which they were originally attached. It can also denote a process applied by linguists themselves, whereby phenomena are considered without the details that are not relevant to the desired level of analysis.

==Object abstraction==
Object abstraction, or simply ''[[abstraction]]'', is a concept wherein terms for objects become used for more abstract concepts, which in some languages develop into further abstractions such as verbs and grammatical words ([[grammaticalisation]]). 
Abstraction is common in human language, though it manifests in different ways for different languages. In language acquisition, children typically learn object words first, and then develop from that vocabulary an understanding of the alternate uses of such words.

For example, the word "book" refers objectively to a physical object constructed with bound pages, but in abstraction refers to a particular literary creation &amp;mdash;regardless of how many physical copies of the "book" there are, it is one "book."&lt;ref&gt;Example taken from [[Chomsky]], [[BBC]] interview titled: "Silent Children, New Language"&lt;/ref&gt; The word "book" then developed more abstract uses, such as in keeping a record (bookkeeping), or to keep a record of betting (booking), or as a verb for entering persons into a record ("to book"). Words may then be further abstracted and even have  [[embedded pun]]s, such as in 'to make history of oneself' ("he booked").

An early example of this kind of study came from [[John Horne Tooke]], who in his [[conversational writing|conversational]] ''[[The Diversions of Purley]]'' (1786), proposed that the abstract word [[wikt:through|through]] came to English through both [[sound change]] and [[derivation (linguistics)|derivation]] from the [[Gothic language|Gothic]]:
:"For as the French peculiar preposition CHEZ is no other than the Italian substantive CASA or CA, so is the English preposition THOROUGH no other than the Gothic substantive ''dauro'', or the Teutonic substantive ''thuruh'': and like them, means door, gate, passage. I am persuaded that Door and Through have one and the same Gothic origin dauro, mean one and the same thing, and are in fact one and the same word."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in [[John McWhorter]], ''Understanding Linguistics,'' lecture series.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Tooke was incorrect about "through," but his insights about the way words migrated via geography, language, sound change, and meaning were innovative, and fundamentally correct.

==Abstraction used by linguists==

===Syntax, semantics, and pragmatics===
The relation among [[syntax]], [[semantics]], and [[pragmatics]] has also been cashed out in terms of what could be called an "abstraction hierarchy." For instance, [[Rudolf Carnap]] in his ''Introduction to Semantics'' (1942, Harvard University Press) writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If… explicit reference is made to the speaker, or, to put it in more general terms, to the user of a language, then we assign it to the field of pragmatics. (Whether in this case reference to designata is made or not makes no difference for this classification.) If we abstract from the user of the language and analyze only the expressions and their designata, we are in the field of semantics. And if, finally, we abstract from the designata also and analyze only the relations between the expressions, we are in (logical) syntax. The whole science of language, consisting of the three parts mentioned, is called semiotic. (p. 9)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A related statement was made a few years earlier by Carnap's fellow American philosopher [[Charles W. Morris]], PhD student of the sociologist and pragmatist philosopher [[George Herbert Mead]], and heavily influenced by the pragmatist and founder of (analytical) [[semiotics]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]:   
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Syntactics, as the study of the syntactical relations of signs to one another in abstraction from the relations of signs to objects [i.e., semantics] or to interpreters [i.e., pragmatics], is the best developed of all the branches of semiotic." (p. 13)&lt;ref&gt;Morris CW. 1938. ''Foundations of the Theory of Signs''. (Volume 1, #2 of ''Foundations of the Unity of Science. Toward an International Encyclopedia of Unified Science''). University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The relation between abstraction and Morris' influential trichotomy is a matter of ongoing discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Korta, K, Perry, J, "Pragmatics", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/pragmatics/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emic units===
A kind of abstraction commonly considered in linguistics is the ''[[phoneme]]'', which abstracts [[speech sound]]s in such a way as to neglect details that cannot serve to differentiate meaning. Other analogous kinds of abstractions (sometimes called "[[emic unit]]s") include [[morpheme]]s, [[grapheme]]s and [[lexeme]]s.

'''''Applied Drama''''', also known as '''''Applied Theatre, Interactive Theatre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sant|first=Toni|title=The Applied and Interactive Theatre Guide|date=22 Sep 2006|url=http://www.interactiveimprov.com/aitg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''or '''Applied Drama''' '''and Theatre (ADT)''''' is an [[umbrella term]] for the use of [[drama]] practice in an educational, community or therapeutic context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Phillip|title=Applied Theatre/Drama: an e-debate in 2004|journal=Research in Drama Education: The Journal of Applied Theatre and Performance J|date=February 2006|volume=11|issue=1|pages=90–95|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13569780500437960#.UZmDvSsa-nk|doi=10.1080/13569780500437960}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often done in non-theatrical spaces, with participants who do not consider themselves to be artists.

There are several forms and practices considered to be under the umbrella of Applied Drama. In all these fields approaches and methods of [[Applied improvisation|Applied Improvisation]] are used. 

==History and definition==
Applied Drama is a term that has been contested{{By whom|date=August 2015}}, gaining popularity towards the end of the 20th century to describe drama practice in an educational, community or therapeutic context.

James Thompson states that "Applied theatre is a participatory theatre created by people who would not usually make theatre. It is, I would hope, a practice by, with and for the excluded and marginalised." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Applied Theatre: Bewilderment and Beyond|last = Thompson|first = James|publisher = Peter Lang|year = 2008|isbn = |location = Oxford|pages = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judith Ackyroyd confirms the inclusion of both of these elements in ADT: "I have identified two features which I believe to be central to our understanding of applied theatre; an intention to generate change (of awareness, attitude, behaviour, etc), and the participation of the audience."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Applied Theatre: Problems and Possibilities|last = Ackroyd|first = Judith|date = 2000|journal = Applied Theatre Researcher|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applied drama can be either scripted or unscripted.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|quote = |title = Applied Theatre, International Case Studies and Challenges for Practice|year = 2009|publisher = Intellect Publishers|location = Briston, UK|page = 7|editor1=Monica Prendergast |editor2=Juliana Saxton }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some practitioners focus primarily on improvisation, whereas others  introduce a range of artistic practices, such as developing scripted plays,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cleanbreak.org.uk retrieved 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; devised performances,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oilycart.org.uk.retrieved{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; or indigenous forms of cultural performance, sometimes combined with new forms of digital communication.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example www.charles-royal.com, www.africanperformers.com, www.storyworkshop.org. retrieved 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fields associated with applied drama==

===Playback Theatre===
{{Main|Playback Theatre}}
[[Playback Theatre]] involves audience or group members telling stories from their lives and viewing them as enacted by actors improvising. It can also be used in conjunction with [[Narrative Therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Playback theatre and narrative therapy: introducing a new model|journal=Dramatherapy |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=108–119 |quote=Article elaborates how such integration (Playback theatre with Narrative Therapy) can be achieved and how it can contribute to the process of narrative re-authoring.|doi=10.1080/02630672.2013.821865|year=2013|last1=Barak|first1=Adi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drama in Health Education===
Drama in healthcare is drama created in medical contexts, often with the intention of rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Bernie|title=Using the Creative Arts in Therapy and Healthcare: A Practical Introduction|publisher=Routledge|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of Applied Drama focuses on using theatre to educate, engage, and stimulate healing in medical professionals, patients, and the general public. Theatre and drama in healthcare are tilted towards conscientizing the populace about their health and improving their health and longevity irrespective of status or social stratification. This form of drama is often used to educate people on important health issues such as healthy eating, grief and loss, exercise, and sexual assault prevention. Examples include using actors to [[Role-playing|role-play]] health ailments in order to train healthcare professionals, performing plays focused on [[Preventive healthcare|primary prevention]], and facilitating drama workshops for patients.

===Drama Therapy===
{{Main|Drama therapy}}
[[Drama therapy]] is the use of Applied Drama techniques to facilitate personal growth and promote mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Loretta Gallo-Lopez, Lawrence C. C. Rubin -Play-Based Interventions for Children and Adolescents on the ...  2012- Page 100 "An overview of drama therapy is provided next, along with support for the use of drama therapy with children with ASd."&lt;/ref&gt;

Drama therapy is rooted in a clinical practice, facilitated by licensed clinicians, that stimulates language, cognitive development and builds resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Clinical Applications of Drama Therapy in Child and Adolescent Treatment|last = Weber|first = Anna Marie|publisher = Brunner-Routledge|year = 2005|isbn = |location = New York|pages = |last2 = Haen|first2 = Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre for Development===
{{Main|Theatre for Development}}
Theatre for Development uses Applied Drama techniques to facilitate development in [[less developed countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kabaso|first=Sydney|title=Theater for Development in Zambia|year=2013|publisher=Kabsy Digital Media|location=Zambia|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drama in Education ===
{{Confusing section|date=August 2015}}
Drama in Education can allow students to develop an understanding of themselves and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arts, The Ontario Curriculum, Grades 1-8|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/curriculum/elementary/arts18curr.pdf|publisher=Ontario Ministry of Education and Training|accessdate=20 May 2013|page=5|quote=Education in the arts is essential to students’ intellectual, social, physical, and emotional growth.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kathleen Galllagher has argued that 'What is clear is that there is no correct pedagogical model on offer for drama education. [...] In theatre pedagogy, we not only endow experience with meaning, but we are - as players - invited to make manifest our own subjectivities in the world evoked through character and play, a world laden with metaphor and nuance, a world where relationship to other and self-spectatorship are in dynamic and unrelenting interaction.'&lt;ref&gt;See 'Emergent Conceptions in Theatre Pedagogy and Production' in  ''How Theatre Education: Convergences and Counterpoints'' 3-13, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre in Education===
{{Main|Theatre in education}}
{{Overly detailed|date=August 2015|section=yes}}
Theatre in education (TIE) originated in Britain in the mid-1960s. Monica Prendergast and Juliana Saxton cite TIE as "one of the two historic roots of applied theatre practice."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; TIE typically includes a theatre company performing in an educational setting (i.e. a school) for youth, including interactive and performative moments.

Practitioner Lynn Hoare defines TIE as a combination of "theatrical elements with interactive moments in which audience participants (in or out of role) work with actor-teachers towards an educational or social goal, using the tools of theatre in service of this goal."&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, Lynn. Considering the Form: Fundamental Factors in Devising for Theatre-In-Education. Thesis. University of Texas at Austin. n.p. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar Helen Nicholson notes that this work "involves professional theatre-makers working with young people in all kinds of educational settings and learning environments, including schools, hospitals, theaters, museums and heritage sites."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Nicholson, Helen, Applied Drama: The Gift of Theatre, Palgrave MacMillan, Basingstoke, UK, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

TIE seeks to educate young people in issues that are relevant to both them and their communities, for example: bullying, dating violence, environmental preservation, and peer conflict resolution. "TIE companies have always been among the most socially conscious of theatre groups, consistently choosing to examine issues they believe to be of direct relevance to the lives of the children with whom they work."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Anthony, and Chris Vine. Learning through Theatre: The Changing Face of Theatre in Education. 3rd ed. New York: Routledge, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Theatre for Dialogue" (TFD) is a more recent term describing a model that was created specifically for the University of Texas at Austin campus community which pulls methods and theory from a variety of applied theatre practices such as TO and TIE. In her thesis, Spring Snyder explains that "Theatre For Dialogue performances explore the intersection between theatre and education as a way to investigate, reflect, provoke dialogue and serve as a rehearsal for reality without asking participants to share their own personal experiences. Although some of the Theatre For Dialogue’s roots originate from an adapted form of Boal’s Theatre of the Oppressed’s forum structure, it is Theatre in Education (TIE) that more closely aligns with TFD."&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Spring. A Transformative Classroom Experience: Exploring Campus Mental Health through Theatre For Dialogue. Thesis. University of Texas at Austin. 2015. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prison Theatre===
In prison theatre, practitioners engage offenders in correctional facilities, jails, prisons, and detention centers in exploring drama work often with the objective of education or rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shailor|first1=Jonathan|title=Performing New Lives: Prison Theatre|date=2010|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|quote=In the prison setting, as elsewhere, the needs that theatre addresses are those of self-expression and identity, freedom (of the imagination), creativity, and community.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include Wabash Valley Correctional Facility’s ''Shakespeare in Shackles'' where maximum security prisoners learn about and perform [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. The University of Texas’ Center for Women and Gender Studies’ Performing Justice Project works with incarcerated female youth to learn about gender and racial justice while devising a play based on the youth’s unique experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Drama Workshops for Anger Management and Offending Behaviour|last = Thompson|first = James|publisher = Jessica Kingsley Publishers|year = 1999|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Theatre of the Oppressed ===
{{Main|Theatre of the Oppressed}}The '''Theatre of the Oppressed''' (TO) describes theatrical forms that the Brazilian theatre practitioner Augusto Boal first developed in the 1960s, initially in Brazil and later in Europe. Boal's techniques aim to use theatre as means of promoting social and political change through allowing the audience to take an active role in the creation of the show. Theatre of the Oppressed can include aspects of [[Forum Theatre]], [[Invisible theater|Invisible Theatre]], Legislative Theatre and [[Image theatre|Image Theatre]].

=== Museum Theatre ===
{{Main|Museum theatre}}Museum theatre aims to use theatrical techniques to add emotion and value to the museum experience.&lt;ref name="IMTAL {{!}} IMTAL"&gt;{{Cite web|title = IMTAL {{!}} IMTAL|url = http://imtal-europe.net/|website = imtal-europe.net|accessdate = 2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically more common in cultural institutions like heritage sites, history museums, and science and industry museums.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Hughes. Museum theatre: Communicating with visitors through drama. Heinemann Drama, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Genshaft, Lindsay Michelle. "Bridging theatre and visual art: the role of an applied theatre practitioner in a fine art museum." (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; As with the other forms of applied drama, it can involve a variety of theatrical techniques.&lt;ref name="IMTAL {{!}} IMTAL" /&gt;

This part of the south side of [[Loch Assynt]] has been fenced off to assist natural regeneration of the tree cover. So far, there are few trees showing, despite the OS mapping showing this as a wooded area.]]

'''Assisted natural regeneration''' ('''ANR''') is the human protection and preservation of natural tree seedlings in forested areas. Seedlings are, in particular, protected from undergrowth and extremely flammable plants such as ''Imperata'' grass. In addition to protection efforts, new trees are planted when needed or wanted (enrichment planting). With ANR, forests grow faster than they would naturally, resulting in a significant contribution to [[carbon sequestration]] efforts. It also serves as a cheaper alternative to [[reforestation]] due to decreased nursery needs.

ANR is labor-intensive and requires nearly constant maintenance of selected forest areas. can be effective as a community project, and people involved may see significant benefits and jobs if funding is available. However, if the forestation is not a positive change, for example if the land is needed for food, the people of the community will be unlikely to get involved and produce successful ANR. 

The most effective way to implement ANR is very site-specific, and many nations provide guidebooks on how to select and maintain an ANR project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldagroforestry.org/sea/publications/manuals/imperata%20engmanual/CHAPTER-5.pdf|title=Chapter 5: Assisted Natural Regeneration }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.treeseedfa.org/doc/SiteSelectionEnglish/PartII3.pdf|chapter=3. Assisted Natural Regeneration*|publisher=Forestry Administration/Cambodia Tree Seed Project/DANIDA|year=2005|title=Guidelines for Site Selection and Tree Planting in Cambodia}}  Source: Kathleen et al, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current practice ==
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), China has since 1999 funded extensive ANR in an effort to prevent soil corrosion in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/004/ad466e/ad466e07.htm|title=Assisted natural regeneration in China - Jiang Sannai|work=fao.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the FAO reports that ANR is a common practice in Thailand.

ANR is gaining popularity as [[global climate change]] becomes a growing concern.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6874">'''Biocultural diversity''' is defined by [[Luisa Maffi]] as "the diversity of life in all its manifestations: [[biology|biological]], [[culture|cultural]], and [[linguistics|linguistic]] — which are interrelated (and possibly coevolved) within a complex [[socio-ecological system|socio-ecological]] [[adaptive system]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maffi|first=Luisa|title=The SAGE Handbook of Environment and Society|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=nyZFZgbpdKYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA267&amp;dq=maffi+l+2007+biocultural+diversity+and+sustainability&amp;ots=gm2o2vvjok&amp;sig=-19eTvoZ0ikAqSJ1xpQMzxGM34Q#v=onepage&amp;q=maffi&amp;f=false|authorlink=Biocultural Diversity and Sustainability|editor=Jules Pretty|accessdate=27 October 2012|page=269|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The diversity of life is made up not only of the diversity of plants and animal species, habitats and ecosystems found on the planet, but also of the diversity of human cultures and languages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maffi|first=Luisa|title=Biocultural Diversity Conservation|year=2012|publisher=Earthscan|location=UK|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain geographic areas have been positively correlated with high levels of biocultural diversity, including those of [[low latitudes]], higher rainfalls, higher temperatures, [[coastline]]s, and [[high altitude]]s. A negative correlation is found with areas of [[high latitudes]], [[plain]]s, and drier climates. Positive correlations can also be found between biological diversity and [[linguistic diversity]], illustrated in the overlap between the distribution of plant diverse and language diverse zones. Social factors, such as modes of [[subsistence]], have also been found to affect biocultural diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maffi|first=Luisa|title=Biocultural Diversity Conservation|year=2012|publisher=Earthscan|location=UK|pages=6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic Diversity==
Cultural traditions are passed down through language, making language an important factor in the existence of biocultural diversity. There has been a decline in the number of languages globally. The [[Linguistic Diversity Index]] has recorded that between 1970 and 2005, the number of languages spoken globally has decreased by 20%. This decline has been especially observed in [[indigenous language]]s, with a 60% decline in the Americas, 30% in the Pacific, and 20% in Africa. Currently, there are 7,000 languages being spoken in the world. Half the population speaks only 25 of these languages, the top 5 in order being [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[English language|English]], [[Hindi]], and [[Bengali language|Bengali]]. The remaining 6975 languages are divided between the other half of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Harmon, Loh |first=David, Jonathan |title=Index of Linguistic Diversity |url=http://www.terralingua.org/linguisticdiversity/ |work=Terralingua: unity in biocultural diversity |accessdate=29 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822015417/http://www.terralingua.org/linguisticdiversity/ |archivedate=22 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because languages develop in a given community of speakers as that society adapts to its environment, languages reflect and express the [[biodiversity]] of that area. In areas of high biodiversity, language diversity is also higher, suggesting that a greater diversity in culture can be found in these areas. In fact, many of the areas of the world inhabited by smaller, isolated communities are also home to large numbers of endemic plant and animal species. As these people are often considered to be "[[Stewardship|stewards]]" of their environments, loss of language diversity means a disappearance of traditional ecological knowledge ([[Traditional Environmental Knowledge|TEK]]), an important factor in the conservation of biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On Biocultural Diversity|year=2001|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|location=Washington|pages=1–11|editor=Luisa Maffi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Declaration of Belem==
Awareness about the balance between biological and cultural diversity has been increasing for a few decades. At the first international congress on ethnobiology in 1988, scientists met with indigenous peoples to discuss ways to better manage the use of natural resources and protect vulnerable communities around the world. They developed the [http://www.ethnobiology.net/what-we-do/core-programs/global-coalition-2/declaration-of-belem/ Declaration of Belem], named after the city where the congress was held, which outlined eight steps to ensure conservation efforts would be implemented effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Declaration of Belem|url=http://www.ethnobiology.net/what-we-do/core-programs/global-coalition-2/declaration-of-belem/|publisher=International Society of Ethnobiology|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hotspots of Biocultural Diversity==
There are three areas which have been identified as hotspots of biocultural diversity: The Amazon Basin, Central Africa, and Indomalaysia/Malenesia. Hot spots of biocultural diversity can be calculated by averaging a countries biological diversity and cultural diversity. Cultural diversity is scored based on "a country's language diversity, religion diversity, and ethnic group diversity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loh|first=Jonathan|author2=Harmon|title=A Global Index of Biocultural Diversity|journal=Ecological Indicators|date=August 2005|volume=5|issue=3|pages=231–241|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X0500018X|accessdate=21 November 2012|doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2005.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent programs in the Eastern Himalayas have also engaged this concept to promote conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O'Neill |first1=Alexander |display-authors=etal |date=2017-03-29 |title=Integrating ethnobiological knowledge into biodiversity conservation in the Eastern Himalayas |url=https://ethnobiomed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13002-017-0148-9 |journal=Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine |volume=13 |issue=21 |pages= |doi=10.1186/s13002-017-0148-9 |access-date=2017-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Causal dynamical triangulation''' (abbreviated as '''CDT''') theorized by [[Renate Loll]], [[Jan Ambjorn|Jan Ambjørn]] and [[Jerzy Jurkiewicz]], and popularized by [[Fotini Markopoulou]] and [[Lee Smolin]], is an approach to [[quantum gravity]] that like [[loop quantum gravity]] is [[background independent]].  

This means that it does not assume any pre-existing arena (dimensional space), but rather attempts to show how the [[spacetime]] fabric itself evolves.  

The [http://loops05.aei.mpg.de/ Loops '05] conference, hosted by many loop quantum gravity theorists, included several presentations which discussed CDT in great depth, and revealed it to be a pivotal insight for theorists.  It has sparked considerable interest as it appears to have a good semi-classical description.  At large scales, it re-creates the familiar 4-dimensional spacetime, but it shows spacetime to be 2-d near the [[Planck scale]], and reveals a [[fractal]] structure on slices of constant time.  These interesting results agree with the findings of Lauscher and Reuter, who use an approach called [[Asymptotic safety in quantum gravity#Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG)|Quantum Einstein Gravity]], and with other recent theoretical work.  A brief article appeared in the February 2007 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'', which gives an overview of the theory, explained why some physicists are excited about it, and put it in historical perspective.  The same publication gives CDT, and its primary authors, a feature article in its July 2008 issue.

== Introduction ==
Near the Planck scale, the structure of spacetime itself is supposed to be constantly changing due to [[quantum fluctuation]]s and topological fluctuations. CDT theory uses a [[triangulation (topology)|triangulation]] process which varies [[dynamical system|dynamically]] and follows [[deterministic]] rules, to map out how this can evolve into dimensional spaces similar to that of our universe.

The results of researchers suggest that this is a good way to model the [[early universe]]{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}, and describe its evolution. Using a structure called a [[simplex]], it divides spacetime into tiny triangular sections. A simplex is the multidimensional analogue of a [[triangle]]; a 3-simplex is usually called a [[tetrahedron]], while the 4-simplex, which is the basic building block in this theory, is also known as the [[pentachoron]]. Each simplex is geometrically flat, but simplices can be "glued" together in a variety of ways to create curved spacetimes, where previous attempts at triangulation of quantum spaces have produced jumbled universes with far too many dimensions, or minimal universes with too few.

CDT avoids this problem by allowing only those configurations in which the timelines of all joined edges of simplices agree.

== Derivation ==

CDT is a modification of quantum [[Regge calculus]] where spacetime is discretized by approximating it with a piecewise linear [[manifold]] in a process called [[triangulation]]. In this process, a ''d''-dimensional spacetime is considered as formed by space slices that are labeled by a discrete time variable ''t''.  Each space slice is approximated by a [[simplicial manifold]] composed by regular (''d'' − 1)-dimensional simplices and the connection between these slices is made by a piecewise linear manifold of ''d''-simplices.  In place of a smooth manifold there is a network of triangulation nodes, where space is locally flat (within each simplex) but globally curved, as with the individual faces and the overall surface of a [[geodesic dome]].  The line segments which make up each triangle can represent either a space-like or time-like extent, depending on whether they lie on a given time slice, or connect a vertex at time ''t'' with one at time ''t'' + 1.  The crucial development is that the network of simplices is constrained to evolve in a way that preserves [[Causality (physics)|causality]].  This allows a [[Path integral formulation|path integral]] to be calculated [[non-perturbative]]ly, by summation of all possible (allowed) configurations of the simplices, and correspondingly, of all possible spatial geometries.

Simply put, each individual simplex is like a building block of spacetime, but the edges that have a time arrow must agree in direction, wherever the edges are joined.  This rule preserves causality, a feature missing from previous "triangulation" theories. When simplexes are joined in this way, the complex evolves in an orderly{{how|date=March 2013}} fashion, and eventually creates the observed framework of dimensions.  CDT builds upon the earlier work of [[John W. Barrett|Barrett]] and [[Louis Crane|Crane]], and [[John C. Baez|Baez]] and Barret, but by introducing the causality constraint as a fundamental rule (influencing the process from the very start), Loll, Ambjørn, and Jurkiewicz created something different.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

CDT derives the observed nature and properties of spacetime from a small set of assumptions, without adjusting factors.  The idea of deriving what is observed from first principles is very attractive to physicists.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} CDT models the character of spacetime both in the ultra-microscopic realm near the Planck scale, and at the scale of the cosmos, so CDT may provide insights into the nature of reality.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Evaluation of the observable implications of CDT relies heavily on [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo simulation]] by computer. Some{{who|date=March 2013}} feel that this makes CDT an inelegant quantum gravity theory. Also, it has been argued{{according to whom|date=March 2013}} that discrete time-slicing may not accurately reproduce all possible modes of a dynamical system. However, research by [[Fotini Markopoulou-Kalamara|Markopoulou]] and [[Lee Smolin|Smolin]]{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} demonstrates that the cause for those concerns may be limited{{how|date=March 2013}}. Therefore, many physicists still regard this line of reasoning as promising{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}.

== Related theories ==

CDT has some similarities with [[loop quantum gravity]], especially with its [[spin foam]] formulations.  For example, the Lorentzian [[Barrett–Crane model]] is essentially a non-perturbative prescription for computing path integrals, just like CDT.  There are important differences, however.  Spin foam formulations of quantum gravity use different degrees of freedom and different Lagrangians.  For example, in CDT, the distance, or "the interval", between any two points in a given triangulation can be calculated exactly (triangulations are eigenstates of the distance operator). This is not true for spin foams or loop quantum gravity in general.

Another approach to quantum gravity that is closely related to causal dynamical triangulation is called [[causal sets]].  Both CDT and causal sets attempt to model the spacetime with a discrete causal structure.  The main difference between the two is that the causal set approach is relatively general, whereas CDT assumes a more specific relationship between the lattice of spacetime events and geometry. Consequently, the Lagrangian of CDT is constrained by the initial assumptions to the extent that it can be written down explicitly and analyzed (see, for example, [http://www.arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0505154 hep-th/0505154], page 5), whereas there is more freedom in how one might write down an action for causal-set theory.

[[Image:Dana60CADDodge.jpg|thumb|275px|Center axle disconnect on a [[Dana 60]], in a 1999 4x4 Dodge 2500HD]]
A '''center axle disconnect''' system or CAD is an alternative to [[locking hubs]].   CAD systems are typically used in [[front drive]] [[axle]]s on [[four wheel drive]] vehicles. A CAD system works by having an axle shaft (typically the longer shaft) split into two pieces. One piece is connected to the carrier, the other connected to the wheel. This reduces drag on the axle by allowing only the spider and side gears to spin, while the differential carrier, [[pinion]] and [[drive shaft]] are at rest (as is the inner portion of the disconnected long shaft and its associated side gear). The axle is engaged by connecting the two split axle shafts. The ends of the axles are typically [[Spline (mechanical)|splined]] and use a collar to connect the two shafts together by sliding over both shafts.

==Comparison with locking hubs==
Although a widely used system, this system is not as efficient as a system with locking hubs.    A CAD system spins the axle shafts, spider gears, and side gears in the carrier during normal driving.  Locking hubs disengage the axle at the wheels, allowing all of the axle to be at rest during normal driving.   Nevertheless, a CAD system still makes for much less drag than having the axle completely locked in (which would spin the axles, differential, driveshaft and part of the internals of the transfer case). 

Like locking hubs, the CAD system is designed to improve [[fuel efficiency]] of the vehicle.    Other, often debated, benefits of CAD systems are reduced vibration, axle wear, and noise, as well as improved steering and drivability.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

Unlike locking hubs, CAD systems are generally automatic and engaged when the vehicle is placed in four wheel drive. Due to the lack of driver control over the CAD, it is not as well known to the public as manual locking hubs are (but no different from automatic locking hubs in terms of driver involvement, and manual hubs are rare on modern 4x4 vehicles).

Locking hubs are obtrusive and damage can occur that can cause the four wheel drive system to fail — damage that would not be an issue in a CAD system. However CAD systems are mostly vacuum controlled and damage can occur to the vacuum system and to the CAD itself. Rotting of vacuum lines will cause the four wheel drive system to fail — damage that would not be an issue with locking hubs.

== Later CAD systems ==

[[Ram Truck]]s used the CAD from 1994-2001. In 2002 it was phased out of the 2500 and 3500, leaving some late models without a CAD system. Ram 2013 model year trucks began using a CAD system again, this time electronically controlled instead of vacuum.

{{Infobox Observatory}}
The '''Chilbolton Observatory''' is a facility for atmospheric and radio research located on the edge of the village of [[Chilbolton]] near [[Stockbridge, Hampshire|Stockbridge]] in [[Hampshire]], England.  The facilities are run by the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council|STFC]] Radio Communications Research Unit of the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] and form part of the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]].

== Overview ==

The Chilbolton Observatory operates many pieces of research equipment associated with [[radar]] propagation and [[meteorology]]. {{As of|2007}}, these include [http://www.chilbolton.rl.ac.uk/facilities.htm]:
* An [[S band]] Doppler [[weather radar]] with its distinctive, fully steerable, 25 metre parabolic antenna. This equipment can be referred to as '''CAMRa''' ('''Chilbolton Advanced Meteorological Radar''').
* An [[L band]] Clear-air radar
* A [[W band]] bistatic zenith radar
* A [[UV]] [[Raman scattering|Raman]] [[Lidar]]
* Multiple [[Ka band|K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; band]] radiometers
* Multiple [[rain gauge]]s

The observatory also hosts the UK's [[LOFAR]] station.

== Timeline of projects ==

* 1998 - CLARE'98 Cloud Lidar and Radar experiment [https://web.archive.org/web/20061009093137/http://www.chilbolton.rl.ac.uk/clare.htm], which eventually fed into the [[European Space Agency]] EarthCARE programme [http://www.esa.int/esaLP/LPearthcare.html]
* 2001 to 2004 - CLOUDMAP2 [https://web.archive.org/web/20060510202214/http://www.cloudmap2.rl.ac.uk/] project to assist in [[Numerical weather prediction]] models
* 2006 - Chilbolton Observatory joined forces with several European Space Agency sites to verify the L band radio transmissions from the [[GIOVE-A]] satellite [http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEM21VMVGJE_Improving_0.html]
* 2006 - [[Natural Environment Research Council|NERC]] Cirrus and Anvils: European Satellite and Airborne Radiation measurements project
* 2008 - In-Orbit Test (IOT) performed for GIOVE-B
* 2008-9 - APPRAISE [https://web.archive.org/web/20090625103936/http://ncasweb.leeds.ac.uk/appraise/], during which the CAMRa and Lidar were used to direct airborne measurements in mixed-phase clouds
* 2010 - [[LOFAR]] station UK608 constructed

== History ==
[[File:Equipment rooms at Chilbolton Observatory - geograph.org.uk - 811894.jpg|thumb|right|The equipment rooms at the Observatory]]
Construction of Chilbolton Observatory started in 1963. It was built partially on the site of [[RAF Chilbolton]], which was decommissioned in 1946. Several sites around the south-east of England were considered for the construction. The site at Chilbolton, on the edge of [[Salisbury Plain]], was chosen in part because of excellent visibility of the horizon and its relative remoteness from major roads whose cars could cause interference.

The facility was opened in April 1967. Within several months of being commissioned the [[azimuth]] bearing of the antenna suffered a catastrophic failure. [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]] were contracted to repair the bearing and devised a system to replace the failed part while leaving the 400 [[tonne]] dish ostensibly in-place.

Originally, the antenna was engaged in [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]] [[radio astronomy]], but now operates as a S and L band radar.

==Function==

===Effects of growth===
[[Directional selection]] appears to act on organisms' size, whereas it exhibits a far smaller effect on other morphological traits,&lt;ref name=Kingsolver2008&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kingsolver| first1=J. G. | last2=Pfennig | first2=D. W.| title=Individual-level selection as a cause of Cope's rule of phyletic size increase | journal=Evolution| volume=58| issue=7| pages=1608–1612| date=July 2004| pmid=15341162| doi=10.1554/04-003}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is possible that this perception may be a result of sample bias.&lt;ref name=Hone2005/&gt; This selectional pressure can be explained by a number of advantages, both in terms of mating success and survival rate.&lt;ref name=Kingsolver2008/&gt;

For example, larger organisms find it easier to avoid or fight off predators and capture prey, to reproduce, to kill competitors, to survive temporary lean times, and to resist rapid climatic changes.&lt;ref name=Hone2005/&gt; They may also potentially benefit from better thermal efficiency, increased intelligence, and a longer lifespan.&lt;ref name=Hone2005/&gt;

Offsetting these advantages, larger organisms require more food and water, and shift from [[r/K selection|r to K-selection]]. Their longer generation time means a longer period of reliance on the mother, and on a macroevolutionary scale restricts the clade's ability to evolve rapidly in response to changing environments.&lt;ref name=Hone2005/&gt;

===Capping growth===
Left unfettered, the trend of ever-larger size would produce organisms of gargantuan proportions. Therefore, some factors must limit this process.
At one level, it is possible that the clade's increased vulnerability to extinction, as its members become larger, means that no taxon survives long enough for individuals to reach huge sizes.&lt;ref name=Hone2005/&gt; There are probably also physically imposed limits to the size of some organisms; for instance, insects must be small enough for oxygen to diffuse to all parts of their bodies, flying birds must be light enough to fly, and the length of giraffes' necks may be limited by the amount of pressure it is possible for their hearts to generate.&lt;ref name=Hone2005/&gt; Finally, there may be a competitive element, in that changes in size are necessarily accompanied by changes in ecological niche. For example, terrestrial carnivores over 21&amp;nbsp;kg almost always prey on organisms larger, not smaller, than themselves.&lt;ref name="Van Valkenburgh2004"&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1126/science.1102417| title=Cope's Rule, Hypercarnivory, and Extinction in North American Canids| year=2004| author=Van Valkenburgh, B.| journal=Science| volume=306| pages=101–4| pmid=15459388| last2=Wang| first2=X| last3=Damuth| first3=J| issue=5693| bibcode=2004Sci...306..101V}}&lt;/ref&gt; If such a niche is already occupied, competitive pressure may oppose the directional selection.&lt;ref name=Hone2005/&gt; The three [[Canidae]] clades show a trend towards larger size before becoming extinct.&lt;ref name=Paleobiol2008&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1666/07030.1|title=Testing hypotheses of the evolution of encephalization in the Canidae (Carnivora, Mammalia)|year=2008|author=Finarelli, John A.|journal=Paleobiology|volume=34|pages=35–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Validity==
Cope recognised that clades of Cenozoic mammals appeared to originate as small individuals, and that body mass increased through a clade's history.&lt;ref name=Alroy1998/&gt; Discussing the case of [[canid]] evolution in [[North America]], [[Blaire Van Valkenburgh]] of [[UCLA]] and coworkers state:
{{quotation| Cope's rule, or the evolutionary trend toward larger body size, is common among mammals. Large size enhances the ability to avoid predators and capture prey, enhances reproductive success, and improves thermal efficiency. Moreover, in large carnivores, interspecific competition for food tends to be relatively intense, and bigger species tend to dominate and kill smaller competitors. Progenitors of hypercarnivorous lineages may have started as relatively small-bodied scavengers of large carcasses, similar to foxes and coyotes, with selection favoring both larger size and enhanced craniodental adaptations for meat eating. Moreover, the evolution of predator size is likely to be influenced by changes in prey size, and a significant trend toward larger size has been documented for large North American mammals, including both herbivores and carnivores, in the Cenozoic.&lt;ref name="Van Valkenburgh2004"/&gt;}}

In some cases, the increase in body size may represent a passive, rather than an active, trend.&lt;ref name=Carrano2006&gt;{{cite journal | author=Carrano, M.T. | year=2006
 | title=Body-Size Evolution in the Dinosauria | journal=Amniote Paleobiology: Perspectives on the Evolution of Mammals, Birds, and Reptiles: a Volume Honoring James Allen Hopson | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4uNMCqSRQ9gC&amp;pg=RA4-PA225&amp;dq=carrano | publisher=University of Chicago Press | isbn=978-0-226-09478-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the maximum size increases, but the minimum size does not; this is usually a result of size varying pseudo-randomly rather than directed evolution. This does not fall into Cope's rule ''[[Sensu|sensu stricto]]'', but is considered by many workers to be an example of "Cope's rule ''[[Sensu|sensu lato]]''".&lt;ref name=Jablonski1997/&gt; In other cases, an increase in size may in fact represent a transition to an optimal body size, and not imply that populations always develop to a larger size.&lt;ref name=Alroy1998&gt;{{cite journal| first1=J. | title=Cope's Rule and the Dynamics of Body Mass Evolution in North American Fossil Mammals | journal=Science | volume=280 | issue=5364 | pages=731–734 | year=1998| pmid=9563948| last1=Alroy|doi=10.1126/science.280.5364.731|bibcode=1998Sci...280..731A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many [[palaeobiologist]]s are skeptical of the validity of Cope's rule, which may merely represent a statistical artefact.&lt;ref name=Hone2005/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gould1996"&gt;{{cite journal | first=Stephen Jay |last=Gould | year=1997 | title=Cope's rule as psychological artefact | journal=Nature | volume=385 | pages=199–200 |doi=10.1038/385199a0 | issue=6613|bibcode=1997Natur.385..199G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Purported examples of Cope's rule often assume that the stratigraphic age of fossils is proportional to their "clade rank", a measure of how derived they are from an ancestral state; this relationship is in fact quite weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sereno|first1=P.

Despite many counter-examples, Cope's rule is supported in many instances. For example, all marine invertebrate phyla except the molluscs show a size increase between the Cambrian and Permian.&lt;ref name="Novack-Gottshall2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Novack-Gottshall |first=Philip M. | year=2008 | title=Ecosystem-wide body-size trends in Cambrian–Devonian marine invertebrate lineages | doi=10.1666/0094-8373(2008)034[0210:EBTICM]2.0.CO;2 | journal=Paleobiology | volume=34 | pages=210–228 | issn=0094-8373 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectively, [[dinosaurs]] exhibit an increase in body length over their evolution.&lt;ref name="HoneKeesey2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hone |first1= D.

For instance, one may expect the size of birds to be constrained, as larger masses mean more energy must be expended in flight. Birds have been suggested to follow Cope's law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last2=Dyke | pages=618–624| issue=2| volume=21| journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology| date=Mar 2008 | doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2007.01483.x| last1=Hone| pmid=18194232| issn=1010-061X | first3=M. | first2=J. | first4=J. | last4=Benton| last3=Haden| title=Body size evolution in Mesozoic birds| first1=W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a subsequent reanalysis of the same data suggested otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Butler | first1=R.

An extensive study published in 2015 supports the presence of a trend toward larger body size in marine animals during the [[Phanerozoic]]. However, this trend was present mainly in the [[Paleozoic]] and [[Cenozoic]]; the [[Mesozoic]] was a period of relative stasis. The trend is not attributable simply to neutral drift in body size from small ancestors, and was mainly driven by a greater rate of diversification in classes of larger mean size. A smaller component of the overall trend is due to trends of increasing size within individual families.&lt;ref name="Helm2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Heim | first1=N. A. | last2=Knope | first2=M.

'''''Credo ut intelligam''''' (alternatively spelled '''''Credo ut intellegam''''') is [[Latin]] for "I believe so that I may understand" and is a maxim of [[Anselm of Canterbury]] (''Proslogion'', 1), which is based on a saying of [[Augustine of Hippo]] (''crede, ut intelligas'', "believe so that you may understand"; ''Tract. Ev. Jo.'', 29.6) to relate [[faith]] and [[reason]]. In Anselm's writing, it is placed in juxtaposition to its converse, ''intellego ut credam'' ("I think so that I may believe"), when he says ''Neque enim quaero intelligere ut credam, sed credo ut intelligam'' ("I do not seek to understand in order that I may believe, but rather, I believe in order that I may understand"). It is often associated with Anselm's other famous phrase ''[[fides quaerens intellectum]]'' ("faith seeking understanding").
Augustine understood the saying to mean that we must believe in something in order to know anything about God.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald H. Nash|Nash, Ronald H.]],"Faith and Reason," p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;  

The term has been used pejoratively to describe uncritical acceptance of questionable concepts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Tallis|Tallis, Raymond]], "The Shrink from Hell", ''The Times Higher Education Supplement'' October 1997 p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[cosmology]], '''decoupling''' refers to a period in the development of the universe when different types of [[particle]]s fall out of [[thermal equilibrium]] with each other. This occurs as a result of the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]], as their interaction rates decrease (and [[mean free path]]s increase) up to this critical point. The two verified instances of decoupling since the [[Big Bang]] which are most often discussed are photon decoupling and neutrino decoupling, as these led to the [[cosmic microwave background]] and [[cosmic neutrino background]], respectively.

Photon decoupling is closely related to [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]], which occurred about 378,000 years after the [[Big Bang]] (at a [[cosmic redshift|redshift]] of ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{val|1100}}), when the universe was a hot [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] ("foggy") [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. During recombination, free electrons became bound to protons (hydrogen nuclei) to form neutral [[hydrogen]] [[atom]]s. Because direct recombinations to the [[ground state]] (lowest energy) of hydrogen are very inefficient, these hydrogen atoms generally form with the electrons in a high energy state, and the electrons quickly transition to their low energy state by emitting [[photon]]s. Because the neutral hydrogen that formed was transparent to light, those photons which were not captured by other hydrogen atoms were able, for the first time in the [[Chronology of the universe|history of the universe]], to travel long distances. They can still be detected today, although they now appear as radio waves, and form the [[cosmic microwave background]] ("CMB"). They reveal crucial clues about how the universe formed.

==Photon decoupling==
{{main article|Recombination (cosmology)}}
Photon decoupling occurred during the [[epoch (cosmology)|epoch]] known as the recombination. During this time, electrons combined with protons to form [[hydrogen atoms]], resulting in a sudden drop in free electron density. Decoupling occurred abruptly when the rate of [[Compton scattering]] of photons &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; was approximately equal to the rate of [[Accelerating universe|expansion of the universe]] &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;,  or alternatively when the [[mean free path]] of the photons &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; was approximately equal to the [[Particle horizon|horizon size]] of the universe &lt;math&gt;H^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. After this photons were able to [[Free streaming|stream freely]], producing the cosmic microwave background as we know it, and the universe became transparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ryden|first1=Barbara Sue|title=Introduction to cosmology|date=2003|publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]]|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interaction rate of the photons is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \frac{c}{\lambda} = n_e \sigma_e c &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; n_e &lt;/math&gt; is the electron [[number density]], &lt;math&gt;\sigma_e&lt;/math&gt; is the electron [[cross section (physics)|cross sectional]] area, and &lt;math&gt; c &lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]].

In the [[matter-dominated era]] (when recombination takes place),
:&lt;math&gt;H \varpropto a^{-{3/2}}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|cosmic scale factor]]. &lt;math&gt;\Gamma &lt;/math&gt; also decreases as a more complicated function of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, at a faster rate than &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kolb|first1=Edward|last2=Turner|first2=Michael|title=The Early Universe|date=1994|publisher=[[Westview Press]]|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; By working out the precise dependence of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; on the scale factor and equating &lt;math&gt;\Gamma=H&lt;/math&gt;, it is possible to show that photon decoupling occurred approximately 380,000 years after the [[Big Bang]], at a [[redshift]] of &lt;math&gt;z = 1100&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hinshaw|first1=G.|last2=Weiland|first2=J. L.|last3=Hill|first3=R. S.|last4=Odegard|first4=N.|last5=Larson|first5=D.|last6=Bennett|first6=C. L.|last7=Dunkley|first7=J.|last8=Gold|first8=B.|last9=Greason|first9=M.

==Neutrino decoupling==
{{main article|Neutrino decoupling}}

Another example is the neutrino decoupling which occurred within one second of the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Longair|first1=M.S.|title=Galaxy formation|date=2008|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e-wJHSBOuZAC&amp;pg=PA290&amp;lpg=PA290&amp;dq=longair+neutrino+decoupling&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xxwLIT3iJ3&amp;sig=UmKNJZmtDHAgLCyZVgg5HARAESY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Dla-U47VNMWEOL-PgMgJ&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=longair%20neutrino%20decoupling&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analogous to the decoupling of photons, neutrinos decoupled when the rate of [[weak interaction]]s between neutrinos and other forms of matter dropped below the rate of expansion of the universe, which produced a cosmic neutrino background of freely streaming neutrinos. An important consequence of neutrino decoupling is that the [[cosmic neutrino background#Derivation of the CνB temperature|temperature]] of this neutrino background is lower than the temperature of the cosmic microwave background.

==WIMPs: non-relativistic decoupling==

Decoupling may also have occurred for the [[dark matter]] candidate, [[Weakly interacting massive particles|WIMPs]]. These are known as "cold relics", meaning they decoupled after they became [[Relativistic particle|non-relativistic]] (by comparison, photons and neutrinos decoupled while still relativistic and are known as "hot relics"). By calculating the hypothetical time and temperature of decoupling for non-relativistic WIMPs of a particular mass, it is possible to find their [[density]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bringmann|first1=Torsten|last2=Hofmann|first2=Stefan|title=Thermal decoupling of WIMPs from first principles|journal=Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics|date=23 April 2007|volume=2007|issue=04|pages=016–016|doi=10.1088/1475-7516/2007/04/016|arxiv = hep-ph/0612238 |bibcode = 2007JCAP...04..016B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing this to the measured [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter|density parameter]] of [[cold dark matter]] today of 0.222 &lt;math&gt;\pm&lt;/math&gt; 0.0026 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jarosik|first1=N.|title=Seven-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Sky Maps, Systematic Errors, and Basic Results.

'''Dennis Vincent Brutus''' (28 November 1924&amp;nbsp;– 26 December 2009) was a [[South Africa]]n activist, educator, journalist and poet best known for his campaign to have South Africa banned from the [[Olympic Games]] due to its controversial racial policy of [[apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/dennis-brutus | title = Dennis Brutus South Africa Online | accessdate = 2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Born in [[Salisbury (Rhodesia)|Salisbury]], [[Southern Rhodesia]] to South African parents, Brutus was of indigenous Khoi, Dutch, French, English, German and Malaysian ancestry. His parents moved back home to [[Port Elizabeth]] when he was aged four, and young Brutus was classified under [[South Africa]]'s [[apartheid]] racial code as "coloured".&lt;ref name="DBT01"&gt;[https://books.google.lu/books?id=mpSqpLpvKcMC "The Dennis Brutus Tapes: Essays at Autobiography"], ''The Dennis Brutus Tapes: Essays at Autobiography''&lt;/ref&gt;

Brutus was a graduate of the [[University of Fort Hare]] (BA, 1946) and of the [[University of the Witwatersrand]], where he studied law. He taught English and [[Afrikaans]] at several high schools in South Africa after 1948, but was eventually dismissed for his vocal criticism of apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith A. P.

===Activist===
Brutus was an activist against the apartheid government of South Africa in the 1960s. He learned politics in the [[Trotsky]]ist movement of the Eastern Cape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Dennis+Brutus:+a+memorial+statement.-a0219588353|title=Dennis Brutus: a memorial statement. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not an accomplished athlete in his own right, he was motivated by the unfairness of selections for athletic teams. He joined the Anti-Coloured Affairs Department organisation (Anti-CAD), a Trotskyist group that organised against the Coloured Affairs Department, which was an attempt by the government to institutionalise divisions between [[Black people|blacks]] and [[coloureds]].

Brutus was a co-founder of the South African Non-Racial Olympic Committee (SANROC), an organization that would be heavily influential in the banning of [[Apartheid-era South Africa and the Olympics]] in 1964. In 1961, Brutus was banned for his political activities as part of SANROC.  As South Africa attempted, in 1968, to get back into the Olympics by arguing that they would field multi-racial teams, SANROC successfully pointed out that those teams were chosen on a segregated basis, leading to South Africa's continued ban from 1968 until 1992.&lt;ref name="George Houser 1989"&gt;George Houser, ''No One Can Stop the Rain: Glimpses of Africa's Freedom Struggle''(New York: Pilgrim Press, 1989), 273-276.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrest and jail===
In 1963, Brutus was arrested for trying to meet with an International Olympic Committee (IOC) official; he was accused of breaking the terms of his "banning," which were that he could not meet with more than two people outside his family, and he was sentenced to 18 months in jail. However, he "jumped bail" by trying to leave South Africa to attend the IOC meeting in Baden-Baden, West Germany, on behalf of SANROC and while in [[Mozambique]], on a Rhodesian passport, the Portuguese secret police arrested him and returned him to South Africa. There, while trying to escape, he was shot in the back at point-blank range. After only partly recovering from the wound, Brutus was sent to [[Robben Island]] ... for 16 months, five in solitary." He was in the cell next to [[Nelson Mandela]]'s. Brutus was in prison when news of the country's suspension from the 1964 [[1964 Summer Olympics|Tokyo Olympics]], for which he had campaigned, broke.&lt;ref name="NYT01" /&gt;&lt;ref name="George Houser 1989"/&gt;

Brutus was forbidden to teach, write and publish in South Africa. His first collection of poetry, ''Sirens, Knuckles and Boots'', was published in [[Nigeria]] while he was in prison. The book received the [[The Mbari Club|Mbari Poetry Prize]], awarded to a black poet of distinction, but Brutus turned it down on the grounds of its racial exclusivity.&lt;ref&gt;Josh MacPhee, [https://justseeds.org/242-mbari-publishing/ "242: Mbari Publishing"], ''Justseeds'', 20 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Brutus, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mpSqpLpvKcMC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=Mbari+prize+&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xc8hf72JPU&amp;sig=CCSXqnTGthL_lRgo6ZrdD9jM1Lg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6qtWyhZbXAhUIY1AKHeVyC_UQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Mbari%20prize%20&amp;f=false ''The Dennis Brutus Tapes: Essays at Autobiography''] (edited by Bernth Lindfors), James Currey, 2011, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the author of 14 books.&lt;ref name="NYT01" /&gt;

===Release from jail===
After he was released, in 1965, Brutus left South Africa on an exit permit, which meant he could never return home while the apartheid regime stayed in power. He went into exile in the  [[United Kingdom|Britain]],where he first met [[George Houser]], the Executive Director of the [[American Committee on Africa]] (ACOA).  South Africa made a concerted effort to get reinstated to the Olympic Games in Mexico City in 1968. Its Prime Minister John Vorster outlined a new policy of fielding a multi-racial team.  At first the IOC accepted this new policy and was going to allow South Africa to compete, but SANROC pointed out that there would be no mixed sporting events within South Africa and therefore all South African athletes chosen for the Games would be chosen under a segregated framework. In 1967, Brutus came to the United States under the auspices of the ACOA on a speaking tour; where he acquainted Americans more closely with the present situation in South Africa, informed American sports organizations about the segregated conditions that South African athletes must endure, and raised money to support the ACOA's Africa Defense and Aid Fund to support the defense of those charged under the apartheid laws.  The Supreme Council for Sport in Africa  which represented the independent African nations at the IOC threatened to boycott if South Africa was included in the 1968 Games.  In cooperation with SANROC, the ACOA organized a boycott of American athletes in February 1968.  [[Jackie Robinson]], the first African American athlete to break to color barrier in [[Major League Baseball]], published a statement calling for continued suspension of South Africa from the Olympic Games. Asa result of the international pressure, the IOC relented and kept South Africa out of the Olympic Games from 1968 until 1992.&lt;ref name="George Houser 1989"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ACOA, "Announcing Dennis Brutus," found at: http://africanactivist.msu.edu/document_metadata.php?objectid=32-130-B92 [accessed on 27 October 2017].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ACOA, "Statement by Jackie Robinson and K.C.

In 1983, Brutus won the right to stay in the [[United States]] as a political refugee, after a protracted legal struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Dudley Clendenin, [https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/14/us/black-poet-an-exile-for-10-years-battles-us-deportation-to-africa.html "Black poet, an exile for 10 years, battles U.S. Deportation to Africa"], ''The New York Times'', 14 January 1982.

===Return to South Africa, poetry and activism===
He returned to South Africa and was based at the [[University of KwaZulu-Natal]], where he often contributed to the annual [[Poetry Africa]] Festival hosted by the university and supported activism against neo-liberal policies in contemporary South Africa through working with [[NGO]]s. 
In December 2007, Brutus was to be inducted into the South African Sports Hall of Fame. 
At the induction ceremony, he publicly turned down his nomination, stating: 

{{quote|It is incompatible to have those who championed racist sport alongside its genuine victims. It's time—indeed long past time—for sports truth, apologies and reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;''Philadelphia Weekly'', 9 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

According to fellow writer [[Olu Oguibe]], interim Director of the Institute for African American Studies at the [[University of Connecticut]], "Brutus was arguably Africa's greatest and most influential modern poet after [[Leopold Sedar Senghor]] and [[Christopher Okigbo]], certainly the most widely-read, and no doubt among the world's finest poets of all time. More than that, he was a fearless campaigner for justice, a relentless organizer, an incorrigible romantic, and a great humanist and teacher."

Brutus died of [[prostate cancer]] on 26 December 2009, at his home in [[Cape Town]], South Africa.&lt;ref name=bond/&gt;&lt;ref name=demo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7edc02ba-f73d-11de-9fb5-00144feab49a.html |title=Poet, political prisoner and a campaigner to the end |publisher=www.ft.com|author= Martin, Jurek|date=2 January 2010&lt;!-- 02:00 --&gt;|accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is survived by two sisters, eight children including his son Anthony, nine grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.&lt;ref name="NYT01" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1400">'''Dionysius Exiguus's Easter table''' was constructed in the year 525 by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] for the years 532–626. He obtained it from an Easter table attributed to Patriarch [[Cyril of Alexandria]] for the years 437–531. The latter was constructed around the year 440 by means of extrapolation from an Alexandrian Easter table constructed around the year 390 by Patriarch [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria|Theophilus of Alexandria]]. The great historical importance of Dionysius' Easter table is twofold: 

# From this Easter table [[Beda Venerabilis' Easter cycle|Bede's Easter cycle]] would ultimately be developed by means of which all future [[Julian calendar]] dates of [[Easter Sunday]] were determined (as in column G of Dionysius' table); 
# With his Easter table Dionysius introduced in passing the [[Christian era]] (see column A of Dionysius' table) which would be developed into a full system for dating historical events by [[Bede]] two centuries later.

In this type of survey [[electrical resistance]] meters are used to detect and map subsurface archaeological [[Feature (archaeology)|features]] and patterning.

== Overview ==
Electrical resistance meters can be thought of as similar to the Ohmmeters used to test electrical circuits. Archaeological features can be mapped when they are of higher or lower resistivity than their surroundings. A stone foundation might impede the flow of electricity, while the organic deposits within a midden might conduct electricity more easily than surrounding soils. Although generally used in archaeology for planview mapping, resistance methods also have a limited ability to discriminate depth and create vertical profiles (see [[Electrical resistivity tomography]]). Further applications include the measurement of the [[Electrical resistivity measurement of concrete|electrical resistivity of concrete]] to determinate the corrosion potential in concrete structures. Electrical resistance surveying is one of the most popular geophysical methods thanks to the fact it is a nondestructive and economically favorable investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amini|first=Amin|last2=Ramazi|first2=Hamidreza|date=2017-03-02|title=CRSP, numerical results for an electrical resistivity array to detect underground cavities|url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/geo.2017.9.issue-1/geo-2017-0002/geo-2017-0002.xml|journal=Open Geosciences|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=13–23|doi=10.1515/geo-2017-0002|issn=2391-5447|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrumentation==
[[File:Res survey.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Electrical resistance survey of an archaeological site using a twin probe system]]In most systems, metal probes (electrodes) are inserted into the ground to obtain a reading of the local electrical resistance. A variety of [[Electrode array|probe configurations]] are used, most having four probes, often mounted on a rigid frame. In these systems, Two of the probes, called current probes, are used to introduce a current (either direct or low-frequency switching current) into the earth. The other two probes, called voltage or potential probes, are used to measure the voltage, which indicates the local resistivity. In general, greater probe spacings yield greater depth of investigation, but at the cost of sensitivity and spatial resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Anthony J. (1996). Seeing Beneath the Soil. Prospecting Methods in Archaeology. London, United Kingdom: B.T. Batsford Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wenner electrode array.svg|thumb|250px|Arrangement of probes in a Wenner electrode array.]]Early surveys (beginning in the mid 20th century) often used the [[Wenner array]], which was a linear array of four probes. These were arranged current-voltage-voltage-current, at equal distances across the array. Probes were mounted on a rigid frame, or placed individually. While quite sensitive, this array has a very wide span for its depth of investigation, leading to problems with horizontal resolution. A number of experimental arrays attempted to overcome the shortcomings of the Wenner array, The most successful of these being the twin-probe array, which has become the standard for archaeological use. The twin-probe array - despite its name - has four probes: one current and one voltage probe mounted on a mobile frame to collect survey readings, and the other current probe placed remotely along with a voltage reference probe. These fixed remote probes are connected to the mobile survey probes by a trailing cable. This configuration is very compact for its depth of investigation, resulting in superior horizontal resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Anthony J. (1996). Seeing Beneath the Soil. Prospecting Methods in Archaeology. London, United Kingdom: B.T. Batsford Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; The logistical advantage of the more compact array is somewhat offset by the trailing cable.

A disadvantage of the systems described above is a relatively slow rate of survey. One solution to this has been wheeled arrays. These use spiked wheels or metal disks as electrodes, and may use a square array (a variation of the Wenner array) to avoid the encumbrance of a trailing cable. Wheeled arrays may be towed by vehicles or by human power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Historic England: Geophysical Survey in Archaeological Field Evaluation | url=https://www.historicengland.org.uk/images-books/publications/geophysical-survey-in-archaeological-field-evaluation/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems having long linear arrays of many electrodes are often used in geological applications, and less commonly in archaeology.  These take repeated measurements (often computer controlled) using different electrode spacings  at multiple points along the extended line of electrodes.&lt;ref&gt;Broken Weblink&lt;/ref&gt; Data collected in this way may be used for tomography, or generating vertical profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/esc/geotech/gg/geophysics2002/061cardimona_resistivity_overview.pdf |title=Electrical Resistivity Techniques for Subsurface Investigation |author=Cardimona, Steve |work= |publisher= |accessdate=2010-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122164806/http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/esc/geotech/gg/geophysics2002/061cardimona_resistivity_overview.pdf |archivedate=2009-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capacitively coupled systems that do not require direct physical contact with the soil have also been developed. These systems are capable of tomographic studies as well as mapping horizontal patterning. They may also be used on hard or very dry surfaces that preclude electrical contact necessary for probe resistance systems. While these show promise for archaeological applications, currently available systems operating on this principle lack sufficient spatial resolution and sensitivity.

== Data collection ==
Survey usually involves walking with the instrument along closely spaced parallel traverses, taking readings at regular intervals. In most cases, the area to be surveyed is staked into a series of square or rectangular survey "grids" (terminology can vary). With the corners of the grids as known reference points, the instrument operator uses tapes or marked ropes as a guide when collecting data. In this way, positioning error can be kept to within a few centimeters for high-resolution mapping. Early surveys recorded readings by hand, but computer controlled data logging and storage are now the norm.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Anthony J. (1996). Seeing Beneath the Soil.

Typically, prior to some process, such as transmission over cable, or recording to phonograph record or tape, the input frequency range most susceptible to noise is boosted. This is referred to as "pre-emphasis"{{snd}}"pre-" the process the signal will undergo. Later, when the signal is received, or retrieved from recording, the reverse transformation is applied ("de-emphasis") so that the output accurately reproduces the original input. Any noise added by transmission or record/playback, to the frequency range previously boosted, is now attenuated in the de-emphasis stage.

The high-frequency signal components are emphasized to produce a more equal [[modulation index]] for the transmitted frequency spectrum, and therefore a better [[signal-to-noise ratio]] for the entire [[frequency range]].

Emphasis is commonly used in [[FM broadcasting]] and [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] (e.g. [[LP record|LP]]) records.

== Pre-emphasis ==
In processing electronic [[audio signal]]s, pre-emphasis refers to a system process designed to increase (within a [[frequency band]]) the magnitude of some (usually higher) frequencies with respect to the magnitude of other (usually lower) frequencies in order to improve the overall signal-to-noise ratio by minimizing the adverse effects of such phenomena as [[attenuation distortion]] or [[Clipping (audio)|saturation]] of recording media in subsequent parts of the system. The mirror operation is called de-emphasis, and the system as a whole is called emphasis.

Pre-emphasis is achieved with a '''pre-emphasis network''' which is essentially a calibrated [[Filter (signal processing)|filter]]. The [[frequency response]] is decided by special [[time constant]]s. The [[cutoff frequency]] can be calculated from that value.

Pre-emphasis is commonly used in [[telecommunication]]s, [[digital audio]] recording, [[phonograph|record]] cutting, in [[FM broadcasting]] [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]]s, and in displaying the [[spectrogram]]s of speech signals.

One example of this is the [[RIAA equalization]] curve on 33&amp;nbsp;rpm and 45&amp;nbsp;rpm [[Gramophone record|vinyl records]]. Another is the [[Dolby noise-reduction system]] as used with magnetic tape.

In high speed digital transmission, pre-emphasis is used to improve [[signal integrity|signal quality]] at the output of a [[data transmission]].  In transmitting signals at high data rates, the transmission medium may introduce distortions, so pre-emphasis is used to distort the transmitted signal to correct for this distortion.  When done properly this produces a received signal which more closely resembles the original or desired signal, allowing the use of higher frequencies or producing fewer bit errors.

Pre-emphasis is employed in [[frequency modulation]] or [[phase modulation]] transmitters to equalize the modulating [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] drive [[Power (physics)|power]] in terms of [[modulation index|deviation ratio]]. The receiver [[demodulation]] process includes a reciprocal network, called a de-emphasis network, to restore the original signal power distribution.

== De-emphasis ==
In telecommunication, '''de-emphasis''' is the complement of pre-emphasis, in the antinoise system called emphasis.  De-emphasis is a system process designed to decrease, (within a band of frequencies), the magnitude of some (usually higher) frequencies with respect to the magnitude of other (usually lower) frequencies in order to improve the overall signal-to-noise ratio by minimizing the adverse effects of such phenomena as attenuation distortion or saturation of recording media in subsequent parts of the system.

Special [[time constant]]s dictate the [[frequency response]] curve, from which one can calculate the [[cutoff frequency]].

In [[Serial communication|serial data transmission]], de-emphasis has a different meaning, which is to reduce the level of all bits except the first one after a transition. That causes the high frequency content due to the transition to be emphasized compared to the low frequency content which is de-emphasized. This is a form of transmitter equalization; it compensates for losses over the channel which are larger at higher frequencies.  Well known serial data standards such as [[PCI Express]], [[SATA]] and [[Serial attached SCSI|SAS]] require transmitted signals to use de-emphasis.

== Red Book audio ==
Although rarely used, there exists the capability for standardized emphasis in [[Red Book (CD standard)|Red Book CD]] mastering. As CDs were intended to work on 14-bit audio, a specification for 'pre-emphasis' was included to compensate for [[Quantization error|quantization noise]]. After production [[Specification (technical standard)|spec]] was set at 16&amp;nbsp;bits, quantization noise became less of a concern, but emphasis remained an option through standards revisions. The pre-emphasis is described as a first-order filter with a gain of 10&amp;nbsp;dB (at 20&amp;nbsp;dB/decade) and time constants 50&amp;nbsp;μs and 15&amp;nbsp;μs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = IEC 60908:1999: Audio recording{{snd}}Compact disc digital audio system|last =|first =|publisher = International Electrotechnical Commission|year = 1999|isbn =|location = Geneva|pages = 29, 131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''emulation theory of representation''' postulates that there are multiple internal modeling circuitries in the brain referred to as emulators. These emulators mimic the input-output patterns of many cognitive operations including action, perception, and imagery.&lt;ref name="Grush 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Grush |first=R. |year=2004 |title=The emulation theory of representation: Motor control, imagery, and perception |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=27 |pages=377–422 |doi=10.1017/s0140525x04000093}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bickle"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bickle |first=J. |year=2009 |title=The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy and Neuroscience |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often running in parallel, these emulators provide resultant feedback in the form of mock sensory signals of a motor command with less delay than sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Desmurget |first1=M. |last2=Grafton |first2=S. |year=2000 |title=Forward modeling allows feedback control for fast reaching movements |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=4 |pages=423–431 |doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(00)01537-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; These forward models receive efference copies of input motor commands being sent to the body and the resulting output sensory signals. Emulators are continually updating so as to give the most accurate anticipatory signal following motor inputs.&lt;ref name="Grush 2004"/&gt;

== Mechanics and structure ==
Little is known about the overall structure of emulators. It could operate like a search glossary with a very large associative memory of input-output sequences. Under this system, the emulator receives a motor command input, finds the closest matching input from its database, and then sends the associated output in that sequence. The other model is an articulated emulator. This model requires that for each significant sensor of the [[human musculoskeletal system]] there is a group of neurons with a parallel firing frequency within the emulator.&lt;ref name="Grush 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kawato"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kawato |first1=M. |last2=Furukawa |first2=K. |last3=Suzuki |first3=R. |year=1987 |title=A Hierarchical Neural-Network Model for Control and Learning of Voluntary Movement |journal=Biological Cybernetics |volume=57 |pages=169–185 |doi=10.1007/bf00364149}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups of neurons would receive the same input as that being sent to their corresponding part of the musculoskeletal system. For example, when raising one’s hand signals will be sent to neurons responsible for wrist, elbow, and shoulder angles and arm angular inertia.

Regardless of this structure both systems will grow and change over time. This is due to constant, fluctuating noise from the environment and the fact that the body changes over time. Growing limbs and muscles result in changes in both required input commands and the resulting output. This requires a degree of plasticity in the emulators. Emulators are thus continually updating, always receiving the resulting output from the musculoskeletal system from an inputted command and comparing it to its own output. It is likely that this is accomplished through [[Kalman Filter]]. Complete correction from the difference in outputs, however, is not applied to the emulators.

[[File:Basic concept of Kalman filtering.svg|800x405px|thumbnail|center|Basic Concept of a Kalman Filter]]

Noise is a constant, fluctuating variable affecting musculoskeletal sensory output. Thus, output differences are almost always greater than they actually should be. Consequently, an internal calculation is made; taking into account the relative reliability of the emulator’s output and if the situational conditions tend to result in very variable or stable sensory outputs, the correction is weighted and applied.&lt;ref name="Grush 2004"/&gt;

The location of these emulators have been found to be largely dependent on the motor system they provide processing and information for.

== Cognitive function ==
Emulators are helpful tools to the body. Sensory feedback naturally takes longer than a predetermined forward model that the brain can compute or access directly. This timing gap can be delayed further by other environmental or physical factors that often occur throughout life. Emulators allow a mock output signal that is often close to that of the real thing. It is further postulated that the emulator can be run independently thus allowing the brain see the likely outcome of a command without running it on the entire system. Furthermore, when returning sensory information has noise and\or holes, the emulator can be run in parallel, making corrections and filling in gaps.&lt;ref name="Bickle 2009"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bickle |first=John |year=2009 |title=The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy and Neuroscience |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Motor control ===
Experiments have found that the temporal length of the motor control loop takes approximately 250-400 ms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ito |first=M. |year=1984 |title=The cerebellum and neural control |location=New York, NY |publisher=Raven Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motor centers, however, are already making corrections to their previous motor plan about 70 ms after the onset of the movement based on peripheral information that should not have arrived yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=van der Meulen |first1=J.H.P. |last2=Gooskens |first2=R.H.J.M. |last3=Dennier van der Gon |first3=J.J. |last4=Gielen |first4=C.C.A.M. |last5=Wilhelm |first5=K. |year=1990 |title=Mechanisms Underlying Accuracy in Fast Goal-Directed Arm Movements in Man |journal=Journal of Motor Behavior |volume=22 |number=1 |pages=67–84 |doi=10.1080/00222895.1990.10735502}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus likely that there are motor emulators that receive and process efferent copies and then send predictive peripheral output before the actual peripheral output from sensors is received. Motor centers often have to run very quickly. Feedback delays and peripheral errors make real-time, rapid motor movement very difficult and liable to failure. Through the use of emulators motor centers can receive fast and reliable feedback in the form of a priori predictions. The later real periphery output can then be incorporated into a more accurate model.&lt;ref name="Bickle 2009"/&gt;

=== Motor imagery ===
It is possible that emulators are largely responsible for [[motor imagery]]. By running motor areas offline, emulators can receive hypothetical movement commands and provide the imagined likely sensory results. Much of this may be run without conscious awareness. For instance, when walking towards an object on the ground to grab it, the brain is running offline motor plans to determine the optimal hand positioning and grip strength to pick up the object.&lt;ref name="Bickle 2009"/&gt;

=== Visual system ===
Visual modal specific emulators have been experimentally shown to exist in an experiment by Ernst Mach in 1896. In his experiment, the subjects’ eyes were prevented from moving and then they were exposed to a stimulus that would trigger a saccade. Most subjects reported experiencing their entire visual scene briefly being shift in the opposite direction of the stimulus. Mach thus inferred that there is a mechanism within the visual system producing an a priori estimate of future visual scenes based upon motor commands and current visual stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mach |first=E. |year=1896 |title=Contributions to the Analysis of the Sensations |translator= C. M. WIlliams |location=La Salle |publisher=Open Court Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar experiment on monkeys, this particular emulator was found to exist within a group of neurons within parietal cortex. Furthermore, it was discovered that these neurons began firing before the eye even moved. They only fired, however, if the motor command would result in a visual saccade. This suggests that visual emulators are modally specific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Duhamel |first1=J. |last2=Colby |first2=C. |last3=Goldberg |first3=M. |year=1992 |title=The Updating of the Representation of Visual Space in Parietal Cortex by Intended Eye Movements |journal=Science |volume=255 |pages=90–92 |doi=10.1126/science.1553535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications for emulators ==
Emulators can be useful in a variety of industries and systems. Many factories and plants have central control systems that cannot afford to wait for certain information or updates. For example, control systems in chemical plants and reactors cannot wait for correctional signals from target systems to make alterations to chemical and material distribution and flow, thus accurate a priori predictions are made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Clark |first=A. |year=2003 |title=Natural-Born Cyborgs: Minds, Technologies, and the Future of Human Intelligence |location=New York |publisher=Oxford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Robotics ===
Emulator-like programming has already been applied to many [[Artificial intelligence|AI]]. systems. In 1988 [[Bartlett Mel]] created a robot he named Murphy. Murphy was a robot arm with three joints and whose main objective was to reach out and grasp an object while avoiding contact with several objects in the way. The robot could operate under two modes. Under the first mode, Murphy would simply move its arm around the workspace until it found a path of unobstructed movement to the intended object. After enough of these runs, Murphy learns to associate a motor command with a future visual output. This leads to its second mode of operation. Similar to an emulator, Murphy can solve the navigation problem offline. Receiving visual imagery of the workspace, Murphy can manipulate an internal visual grid with [[efference copy|efference copies]]. Consequently, the robot can navigate through the obstacles and grasp the intended object in only one run.&lt;ref name="Grush 2004"/&gt;

The [[Mars landing]] rovers have to utilize a similar manipulation of input. [[NASA]] has to overcome an approximately twenty-minute time delay in information exchange from Earth and the rover on Mars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Mission Timeline: Surface Operations |url=http://marsrover.nasa.gov/mission/tl_surface_nav.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5406">'''Ethnoornithology''' (also ethno-ornithology) is the study of the relationship between [[person|people]] and [[birds]] (from "[[Ethnology|ethno-]]" - relating to people and culture - and "[[ornithology]]" - the study of birds). It is a branch of [[ethnozoology]] and so of the wider field of [[ethnobiology]]. Ethnoornithology is an interdisciplinary subject and combines [[anthropology|anthropological]], [[cognitive science|cognitive]] and [[linguistics|linguistic]] perspectives with [[natural science|natural scientific]] approaches to the description and interpretation of people's knowledge and use of birds. Like [[ethnomethodology|ethnoscience]] and other cognate terms, "ethnoornithology" is sometimes used narrowly to refer to people's practice rather than the study of that practice. The broader focus is on how birds are perceived, used and managed in [[human]] [[society|societies]], including their use for [[food]], [[medicine]] and personal [[beauty|adornment]], as well as their use in [[divination]] and [[ritual]]. Applied ethnoornithological research is also starting to play an increasingly important role in the development of [[conservation biology|conservation]] initiatives.

== History of ethnoornithology ==
The work of [[Ralph Bulmer]] in [[New Guinea]], culminating in his collaboration with Ian Saem Majnep in writing ''Birds of My Kalam Country'' (1977), set a new standard for ethnoornithological research, and this book has deservedly become a classic of modern ethnoornithology.

== Approaches to ethnoornithology ==

{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}

== Ethnoornithology and conservation ==
Like other branches of ethnozoology, ethnoornithology has been long undervalued as a resource for [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/endangered-languages/biodiversity-and-linguistic-diversity/ conservation], though this is now beginning to change. Mark Bonta's ''Seven Names for the Bellbird'' (2003), which highlights the importance of local traditions and practices relating to birds for the future of biodiversity conservation in Honduras, and Ricardo Rozzi´s ''Multi-ethnic Bird Guide of the Subantarctic Forests of South America'' (2003), which focuses on the integration of traditional ornithological knowledge and environmental ethics in southern Chile, provide good examples of this trend. Soma (2015) pointed out that ethnoornithological knowledge of falconers contribute to conservation for local avifauna (especially focusing on Kazakh eagle masters). This realisation is the basis for founding the [http://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/egi/research-at-the-egi/ethno-ornithology-world-archive-ewa/ Ethno-ornithology World Archive (EWA)], a collaborative project between Oxford University (linking the Department of Zoology and School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography) and [[BirdLife International]].

== Professional associations ==
The [http://ethnobiology.org Society of Ethnobiology], which publishes the ''Journal of Ethnobiology'', provides a general forum for ethnobiological - including ethnoornthological - research. In January 2006 the [http://uk.groups.yahoo.com/group/ethnoornithology/ Ethnoornithology Research &amp; Study Group (ERSG)] was established "to provide a clearinghouse, information source and discussion point for people interested in the study of, research about and application of indigenous bird knowledge".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3297">In [[bioinformatics]], the '''EzTaxon database''' is a web-based tool for the identification of [[prokaryotes]] based on [[16S ribosomal RNA]] gene sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chun | first1 = Jongsik | last2 = Lee | first2 = Jae-Hak | last3 = Jung | first3 = Yoonyoung | last4 = Kim | first4 = Myungjin | last5 = Kim | first5 = Seil | last6 = Kwon Kim | first6 = Byung | last7 = Lim | first7 = Young-Woon | year = 2007 | title = EzTaxon: a web-based tool for the identification of prokaryotes based on 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences | url = | journal = International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology | volume = 57 | issue = 10| pages = 2259–2261 | doi = 10.1099/ijs.0.64915-0 | pmid=17911292}}&lt;/ref&gt; EzTaxon is an [[open access]] database that is produced and maintained by ChunLab, Inc.

The EzTaxon database contains sequences of type strains of prokaryotic species with validly published names. Although EzTaxon is mainly used for the routine identification of prokaryotic isolates, sequences from uncultured taxa were not included. Thus in 2012, EzTaxon was extended to include uncultured prokaryotes and the name of the database was changed to EzTaxon-e.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = OS | last2 = Cho | first2 = YJ | last3 = Lee | first3 = K | last4 = Yoon | first4 = SH | last5 = Kim | first5 = M | last6 = Na | first6 = H | last7 = Park | first7 = SC | last8 = Jeon | first8 = YS | last9 = Lee | first9 = JH | last10 = Yi | first10 = H | last11 = Won | first11 = S | last12 = Chun | first12 = J | year = 2012 | title = Introducing EzTaxon-e: a prokaryotic 16S rRNA gene sequence database with phylotypes that represent uncultured species | url = | journal = Int J Syst Evol Microbiol | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 716–21 | doi = 10.1099/ijs.0.038075-0 | pmid=22140171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Naming convention ==
[[Taxa]] names included in EzTaxon-e represent groups of uncultured sequences found in [[public domain]] databases. The names included in EzTaxon-e have no standing in formal nomenclature but they were created to help in the comparison of microbial communities and diversity in nature.
 
* New names found in EzTaxon-e are formed by adding special suffixes to [[Genbank]] sequence accession numbers of sequences (e.g. AB177171_s -&gt; species of which the sequence entry AB177171 serves type; AB177171_g -&gt; genus; AB177171_f -&gt; family; AB177171_o -&gt; order; AB177171_c -&gt; class; AB177171_p -&gt; phylum).
* Well-known names have been preserved for historical reasons. [[SAR11]], the famous marine inhabitant, is labeled as [[SAR11]](order), and further divided into 4 families (SAR11-1_f to SAR11-4_f).
* Based on 16S rRNA sequence [[phylogeny]], some obviously misclassified species have been renamed using special suffixes. For example, Bacteroides pectinophilus is not an authentic member of the [[genus]] Bacteroides. However, it may represent a novel genus in the family Lachnospiraceae. Therefore, in the EzTaxon-e database, Bacteroides pectinophilus is placed under a tentatively named new genus Bacteroides_g1.
*Sequences and tentative taxa that start with "4P" are products of the Roche 454 GS FLX Titanium system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33043">{{Short description|The scientific naming of genes}}
'''Gene nomenclature''' is the scientific [[nomenclature|naming]] of [[gene]]s, the units of [[heredity]] in living organisms. An international committee published recommendations for genetic symbols and nomenclature in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the International Committee on Genetic Symbols and Nomenclature (1957). ''Union of International Sci Biol Ser B'', Colloquia No. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The need to develop formal guidelines for human gene names and symbols was recognized in the 1960s and full guidelines were issued in 1979 (Edinburgh Human Genome Meeting).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genenames.org/aboutHGNC.html|title=About the HGNC - HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other [[genus]]-specific research communities (e.g., ''[[Drosophila]]'' fruit flies, ''[[mouse|Mus]]'' mice) have adopted nomenclature standards, as well, and have published them on the relevant [[model organism]] websites and in scientific journals, including the ''[[Trends in Genetics]]'' Genetic Nomenclature Guide.&lt;ref&gt;Genetic nomenclature guide (1995). ''Trends Genet''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ''Trends In Genetics'' Nomenclature Guide (1998). Elsevier, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists familiar with a particular [[gene family]] may work together to revise the nomenclature for the entire set of genes when new information becomes available.&lt;ref name="genenames.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genenames.org/guidelines.html|title=HGNC Guidelines - HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many genes and their corresponding [[protein]]s, an assortment of alternate names is in use across the scientific literature and public [[biological databases]], posing a challenge to effective organization and exchange of biological information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fundel, Zimmer  | year = 2006 | title = Gene and protein nomenclature in public databases | url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/372 | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 372 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2105-7-372 | pmid = 16899134 | pmc = 1560172 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Standardization]] of nomenclature thus tries to achieve the benefits of [[controlled vocabulary|vocabulary control]] and [[bibliographic control]], although adherence is voluntary. The advent of the [[Information Age|information age]] has brought [[gene ontology]], which in some ways is a next step of gene nomenclature, because it aims to unify the representation of gene and gene product attributes across all species.

Gene nomenclature and '''protein nomenclature''' are not separate endeavors; they are aspects of the same whole. Any name or symbol used for a protein can potentially also be used for the gene that encodes it, and vice versa. But owing to the nature of how science has developed (with knowledge being uncovered bit by bit over decades), proteins and their corresponding genes have not always been discovered simultaneously (and not always physiologically understood when discovered), which is the largest reason why protein and gene names do not always match, or why scientists tend to favor one symbol or name for the protein and another for the gene. Another reason is that many of the mechanisms of life are the same or very similar across [[species]], genera, orders, and phyla (through [[homology (biology)#Homology vs analogy|homology, analogy, or some of both]]), so that a given protein may be produced in many kinds of organisms; and thus scientists naturally often use the same symbol and name for a given protein in one species (for example, mice) as in another species (for example, humans). Regarding the first duality (same symbol and name for gene or protein), the context usually makes the sense clear to scientific readers, and the nomenclatural systems also provide for some specificity by using [[italic type|italic]] for a symbol when the gene is meant and plain (roman) for when the protein is meant. Regarding the second duality (a given protein is [[endogeny|endogenous]] in many kinds of organisms), the nomenclatural systems also provide for at least human-versus-nonhuman specificity by using different [[capitalization]], although scientists often ignore this distinction, given that it is often biologically irrelevant.

Also owing to the nature of how scientific knowledge has unfolded, proteins and their corresponding genes often have several names and symbols that are [[synonym]]ous. Some of the earlier ones may be [[deprecation|deprecated]] in favor of newer ones, although such deprecation is voluntary. Some older names and symbols live on simply because they have been widely used in the [[scientific literature]] (including before the newer ones were coined) and are well established among users.

Lastly, some proteins and [[protein complex]]es are built from the products of several genes (each gene contributing a [[peptide|polypeptide]] subunit), which means that the protein or complex will not have the same name or symbol as any one gene. For example, a particular protein called "example" (symbol "EXAMP") may have 2 chains (subunits), which are encoded by 2 genes named "example alpha chain" and "example beta chain" (symbols ''EXAMPA'' and ''EXAMPB'').

==Species-specific guidelines==

The [[HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee]] is responsible for providing human gene naming guidelines and approving new, unique human gene names and symbols (short [[identifier]]s typically created by abbreviating). For some nonhuman species, model organism databases serve as central repositories of guidelines and help resources, including advice from [[Biocurator|curators]] and nomenclature committees. In addition to species-specific databases, approved gene names and symbols for many species can be located in the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|National Center for Biotechnology Information's]]  "Entrez Gene"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=gene|title=Home - Gene - NCBI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; database.

==Bacterial genetic nomenclature==
There are generally accepted rules and conventions used for naming [[gene]]s in [[bacteria]]. Standards were proposed in 1966 by Demerec et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Demerec M, etal | year = 1966 | title = A proposal for a uniform nomenclature in bacterial genetics | url = | journal = Genetics | volume = 54 | issue = 1| pages = 61–76 | pmid = 5961488 | pmc = 1211113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General rules===
Each bacterial gene is denoted by a [[mnemonic]] of three lower case letters which indicate the pathway or process in which the gene-product is involved, followed by a capital letter signifying the actual gene. In some cases, the gene letter may be followed by an [[allele]] number. All letters and numbers are underlined or italicised.  For example, ''leuA'' is one of the genes of the [[leucine]] biosynthetic pathway, and ''leuA273'' is a particular allele of this gene.

Where the actual protein coded by the gene is known then it may become part of the basis of the mnemonic, thus:
*''rpoA'' encodes the α-subunit of '''R'''NA '''po'''lymerase
*''rpoB'' encodes the β-subunit of '''R'''NA '''po'''lymerase
*''polA'' encodes DNA '''pol'''ymerase I
*''polC'' encodes DNA '''pol'''ymerase III
*''rpsL'' encodes '''r'''ibosomal '''p'''rotein, '''s'''mall S12

Some gene designations refer to a known general function:
*''dna'' is involved in DNA replication

===Common mnemonics===

====Biosynthetic genes====
Loss of gene activity leads to a nutritional requirement ([[auxotrophy]]) not exhibited by the [[wildtype]] ([[prototrophy]]).

Amino acids:
*''ala'' = alanine
*''arg'' = arginine
*''asn'' = asparagine

Some pathways produce metabolites that are precursors of more than one pathway. Hence, loss of one of these enzymes will lead to a requirement for more than one amino acid. For example:
*''ilv'': '''i'''so'''l'''eucine and '''v'''aline

Nucleotides:
*''gua'' = guanine
*''pur'' = purines
*''pyr'' = pyrimidine
*''thy'' = thymine

Vitamins:
*''bio'' = biotin
*''nad'' = NAD
*''pan'' = pantothenic acid

====Catabolic genes====
Loss of gene activity leads to loss of the ability to catabolise (use) the compound.

*''ara'' = arabinose
*''gal'' = galactose
*''lac'' = lactose
*''mal'' = maltose
*''man'' = mannose
*''mel'' = melibiose
*''rha'' = rhamnose
*''xyl'' = xylose

====Drug and bacteriophage resistance genes====

*''amp'' = ampicillin resistance
*''azi'' = azide resistance
*''bla'' = beta-lactam resistance
*''cat'' = chloramphenicol resistance
*''kan'' = kanamycin resistance
*''rif'' = rifampicin resistance
*''tonA'' = phage T1 resistance

====Nonsense suppressor mutations====

*''sup'' = suppressor (for instance, ''supF'' suppresses amber mutations)

===Mutant nomenclature===

If the gene in question is the wildtype a superscript '+' sign is used:
*''leuA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''

If a gene is mutant, it is signified by a superscript '-':
*''leuA&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;''

By convention, if neither is used, it is considered to be mutant.

There are additional superscripts and subscripts which provide more information about the mutation:

*&lt;sup&gt;ts&lt;/sup&gt; = temperature sensitive (''leuA&lt;sup&gt;ts&lt;/sup&gt;'')
*&lt;sup&gt;cs&lt;/sup&gt; = cold sensitive (''leuA&lt;sup&gt;cs&lt;/sup&gt;'')
*&lt;sub&gt;am&lt;/sub&gt; = amber mutation (''leuA&lt;sub&gt;am&lt;/sub&gt;'')
*&lt;sub&gt;um&lt;/sub&gt; = umber (opal) mutation (''leuA&lt;sub&gt;um&lt;/sub&gt;'')
*&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt; = ochre mutation (''leuA&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;'')
*&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt; = resistant (Rif&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;)

Other modifiers:
*Δ = deletion (Δ''leuA'')
*- = fusion (''leuA''-''lacZ'')
*&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; = fusion (''leuA'':''lacZ'')
*&lt;nowiki&gt;::&lt;/nowiki&gt; = insertion (''leuA''::Tn''10'')
*Ω = a genetic construct introduced by a two-point crossover (Ω''leuA''){{Citation needed|reason=May be not a conventional nomenclature, references from academic journal guidelines are required|date=January 2017}}
*Δ''deleted gene''::''replacing gene'' = deletion with replacement (Δ''leuA''::''nptII''(Kan&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;) indicates that the ''leuA'' gene has been deleted and replaced with the gene for neomycin phosphotransferase, which confers kanamycin-resistance, as oftentimes parenthetically noted for drug-resistance markers)

===Phenotype nomenclature===

When referring to the genotype (the gene) the mnemonic is italicized and not capitalised. When referring to the gene product or phenotype, the mnemonic is first-letter capitalised and not italicized (''e.g.'' DnaA – the protein produced by the ''dnaA'' gene; LeuA&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; – the phenotype of a ''leuA'' mutant; Amp&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt; – the ampicillin-resistance phenotype of the β-lactamase gene ''bla'').

===Bacterial protein name nomenclature===
Protein names are the same as the gene names, but the protein names are not italicized, and the first letter is upper-case. E.g. the name of '''R'''NA '''po'''lymerase is RpoB, and this protein is encoded by ''rpoB'' gene.&lt;ref&gt;

To distinguish among different alleles, the abbreviation is followed by an upper-case letter (e.g., the ''rpoB'' gene encodes the β subunit of RNA polymerase). Protein symbols are not italicized, and the first letter is upper-case (e.g., RpoB).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research communities of [[vertebrate]] model organisms have adopted guidelines whereby genes in these species are given, whenever possible, the same names as their human [[orthologs]]. The use of prefixes on gene symbols to indicate species (e.g., "Z" for zebrafish) is discouraged. The recommended formatting of printed gene and protein symbols varies between species.

===Symbol and name===
Vertebrate genes and proteins have names (typically strings of words) and symbols, which are short [[identifier]]s (typically 3 to 8 characters). For example, the gene [[CTLA-4|cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4]] has the HGNC symbol ''CTLA4''. These symbols are usually, but not always, coined by [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]] or [[acronym]]ic abbreviation of the name. They are [[pseudo-acronym]]s, however, in the sense that they are complete identifiers by themselves—short names, essentially. They are synonymous with (rather than standing for) the gene/protein name (or any of its aliases), regardless of whether the initial letters "match". For example, the symbol for the gene v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1, which is ''AKT1'', cannot be said to be an acronym for the name, and neither can any of its various synonyms, which include ''AKT'', ''PKB'', ''PRKBA'', and ''RAC''. Thus, the relationship of a gene symbol to the gene name is functionally the relationship of a [[nickname]] to a formal name (both are complete [[identifier]]s)—it is not the relationship of an acronym to its expansion. In this sense they are similar to the symbols for [[units of measurement]] in the SI system (such as km for the [[kilometre]]), in that they can be viewed as true [[logogram]]s rather than just abbreviations. Sometimes the distinction is academic, but not always. Although it is not wrong to say that "VEGFA" is an acronym standing for "[[vascular endothelial growth factor A]]", just as it is not wrong that "km" is an abbreviation for "kilometre", there is more to the formality of symbols than those statements capture.

The [[root (linguistics)|root]] portion of the symbols for a [[gene family]] (such as the "[[Serpin|SERPIN]]" root in ''SERPIN1'', ''SERPIN2'', ''SERPIN3'', and so on) is called a root symbol.&lt;ref name="genenames.org_gene_families"&gt;{{Citation |author=HGNC |authorlink=HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee |title=Gene Families Index |url=https://www.genenames.org/cgi-bin/genefamilies/ |accessdate=2016-04-11 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human===
The [[HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee]] is responsible for providing human gene naming guidelines and approving new, unique human gene names and symbols (short [[identifier]]s typically created by abbreviating). All human gene names and symbols can be searched online at the HGNC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genenames.org/|title=HGNC database of human gene names - HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; website, and the guidelines for their formation are available there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genenames.org/guidelines|title=HGNC Guidelines - HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guidelines for humans fit logically into the larger scope of [[vertebrate]]s in general, and the HGNC's remit has recently expanded to assigning symbols to all vertebrate species without an existing nomenclature committee, to ensure that vertebrate genes are named in line with their human orthologs/paralogs. Human gene symbols generally are italicised, with all letters in uppercase (e.g., ''SHH'', for [[sonic hedgehog]]). Italics are not necessary in gene catalogs. Protein designations are the same as the gene symbol except that they are not italicised. Like the gene symbol, they are in [[all caps]] because human (human-specific or human homolog). mRNAs and cDNAs use the same formatting conventions as the gene symbol.&lt;ref name="genenames.org"/&gt; For naming [[gene family|families of genes]], the HGNC recommends using a "root symbol"&lt;ref name="HGNC_gene_families_help"&gt;{{Citation |author=HGNC |authorlink=HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee |title=Gene families help |url=https://www.genenames.org/help/genefamilies |accessdate=2015-10-13 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the root for the various gene symbols. For example, for the [[peroxiredoxin]] family, ''PRDX'' is the root symbol, and the family members are ''[[PRDX1]]'', ''[[PRDX2]]'', ''[[PRDX3]]'', ''[[PRDX4]]'', ''[[PRDX5]]'', and ''[[PRDX6]]''.

===Mouse and rat===

Gene symbols generally are italicised, with only the first letter in uppercase and the remaining letters in lowercase (''Shh''). Italics are not required on web pages. Protein designations are the same as the gene symbol, but are not italicised and all are upper case (SHH).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/nomen/gene.shtml|title=MGI-Guidelines for Nomenclature of Genes, Genetic Markers, Alleles, &amp; Mutations in Mouse &amp; Rat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chicken (''Gallus'' sp.)===

Nomenclature generally follows the conventions of human nomenclature. Gene symbols generally are italicised, with all letters in uppercase (e.g., ''NLGN1'', for neuroligin1). Protein designations are the same as the gene symbol, but are not italicised; all letters are in uppercase (NLGN1). mRNAs and cDNAs use the same formatting conventions as the gene symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 19607656 | doi=10.1186/1471-2164-10-S2-S5 | volume=10 Suppl 2 | title=The Chicken Gene Nomenclature Committee report | pmc=2966335 | journal=BMC Genomics | pages=S5 |vauthors=Burt DW, Carrë W, Fell M, Law AS, Antin PB, Maglott DR, Weber JA, Schmidt CJ, Burgess SC, McCarthy FM | year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anole lizard (''Anolis'' sp.)===

==Gene and protein symbol and description in copyediting==
==="Expansion" (glossing)===
A nearly universal rule in copyediting of articles for [[medical literature|medical journals]] and other health science publications is that abbreviations and acronyms must be [[acronym#Expansion|expanded]] at first use, to provide a [[gloss (annotation)|glossing]] type of explanation. Typically no exceptions are permitted except for small lists of especially well known terms (such as ''[[DNA]]'' or ''[[HIV]]''). Although readers with high [[subject-matter expert]]ise do not need most of these expansions, those with intermediate or (especially) low expertise are appropriately served by them.

One complication that gene and protein symbols bring to this general rule is that they are not, accurately speaking, abbreviations or acronyms, despite the fact that many were originally coined via abbreviating or acronymic etymology. They are [[Acronym#Pseudo-acronyms|pseudoacronym]]s (as ''[[SAT]]'' and ''[[KFC]]'' also are) because they do not "stand for" any expansion. Rather, the relationship of a gene symbol to the gene name is functionally the relationship of a [[nickname]] to a formal name (both are complete [[identifier]]s)—it is not the relationship of an acronym to its expansion. In fact, many official gene symbol–gene name pairs do not even share their initial-letter sequences (although some do). Nevertheless, gene and protein symbols "look just like" abbreviations and acronyms, which presents the problem that "failing" to "expand" them (even though it is not actually a failure and there are no true expansions) creates the appearance of violating the spell-out-all-acronyms rule.

One common way of reconciling these two opposing forces is simply to exempt all gene and protein symbols from the glossing rule. This is certainly fast and easy to do, and in highly specialized journals, it is also justified because the entire target [[wikt:readership|readership]] has high subject matter expertise. (Experts are not confused by the presence of symbols (whether known or novel) and they know where to look them up online for further details if needed.) But for journals with broader and more general target readerships, this action leaves the readers without any [[gloss (annotation)|explanatory annotation]] and can leave them wondering what the apparent-abbreviation stands for and why it was not explained. Therefore, a good alternative solution is simply to put either the official gene name or a suitable short description (gene alias/other designation) in parentheses after the first use of the official gene/protein symbol. This meets both the formal requirement (the presence of a gloss) and the functional requirement (helping the reader to know what the symbol refers to). The same guideline applies to shorthand names for sequence variations; [[AMA Manual of Style|AMA]] says, "In general medical publications, textual explanations should accompany the shorthand terms at first mention."&lt;ref name="AMA10_sec_15.6.1"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Iverson |first=Cheryl, et al. (eds) |title=AMA Manual of Style |edition=10th |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford, Oxfordshire |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-19-517633-9 |section=15.6.1 Nucleic Acids and Amino Acids }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus "188del11" is glossed as "an 11-bp deletion at nucleotide 188." This corollary rule (which forms an adjunct to the spell-everything-out rule) often also follows the "abbreviation-leading" style of expansion that is becoming more prevalent in recent years. Traditionally, the abbreviation always followed the fully expanded form in parentheses at first use. This is still the general rule. But for certain classes of abbreviations or acronyms (such as [[clinical trial]] acronyms [e.g., ''[[Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group|ECOG]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; or standardized polychemotherapy regimens [e.g., ''[[CHOP]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;), this pattern may be reversed, because the short form is more widely used and the expansion is merely parenthetical to the discussion at hand. The same is true of gene/protein symbols.

===Synonyms and previous symbols and names===
The [[HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee]] (HGNC) maintains an official symbol and name for each human gene, as well as a list of synonyms and previous symbols and names. For example, for ''[[AFF1]]'' (AF4/FMR2 family, member 1), previous symbols and names are ''MLLT2'' ("myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia (trithorax (Drosophila) homolog); translocated to, 2") and ''PBM1'' ("pre-B-cell monocytic leukemia partner 1"), and synonyms are ''AF-4'' and ''AF4''. Authors of journal articles often use the latest official symbol and name, but just as often they use synonyms and previous symbols and names, which are well established by earlier use in the literature. AMA style is that "authors should use the most up-to-date term"&lt;ref name="AMA10_sec_15.6.2"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Iverson |first=Cheryl, et al. (eds) |title=AMA Manual of Style |edition=10th |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford, Oxfordshire |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-19-517633-9 |section=15.6.2 Human Gene Nomenclature }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and that "in any discussion of a gene, it is recommended that the approved gene symbol be mentioned at some point, preferably in the title and abstract if relevant."&lt;ref name="AMA10_sec_15.6.2"/&gt; Because copyeditors are not expected or allowed to rewrite the gene and protein nomenclature throughout a manuscript (except by rare express instructions on particular assignments), the middle ground in manuscripts using synonyms or older symbols is that the copyeditor will add a mention of the current official symbol at least as a parenthetical gloss at the first mention of the gene or protein, and query for confirmation.

===Styling===
Some basic conventions, such as (1) that animal/human homolog (ortholog) pairs differ in [[letter case]] ([[title case]] and [[all caps]], respectively) and (2) that the symbol is italicized when referring to the gene but nonitalic when referring to the protein, are often not followed by contributors to medical journals. Many journals have the copyeditors restyle the casing and formatting to the extent feasible, although in complex genetics discussions only [[subject-matter expert]]s (SMEs) can effortlessly parse them all. One example that illustrates the potential for ambiguity among non-SMEs is that some official gene names have the word "protein" within them, so the phrase "brain protein I3 (''BRI3'')" (referring to the gene) and "brain protein I3 (BRI3)" (referring to the protein) are both valid. The ''[[AMA Manual of Style|AMA Manual]]'' gives another example: both "the TH gene" and "the ''TH'' gene" can validly be parsed as correct ("the gene for tyrosine hydroxylase"), because the first mentions the alias (description) and the latter mentions the symbol. This seems confusing on the surface, although it is easier to understand when explained as follows: in this gene's case, as in many others, the alias (description) "happens to use the same letter string" that the symbol uses. (The matching of the letters is of course acronymic in origin and thus the phrase "happens to" implies more coincidence than is actually present; but phrasing it that way helps to make the explanation clearer.) There is no way for a non-SME to know this is the case for any particular letter string without looking up every gene from the manuscript in a database such as NCBI Gene, reviewing its symbol, name, and alias list, and doing some mental cross-referencing and double-checking (plus it helps to have biochemical knowledge). Most medical journals do not (in some cases cannot) pay for that level of [[fact checker|fact-checking]] as part of their copyediting service level; therefore, it remains the author's responsibility. However, as pointed out earlier, many authors make little attempt to follow the letter case or italic guidelines; and regarding protein symbols, they often won't use the official symbol at all. For example, although the guidelines would call [[p53]] protein "TP53" in humans or "Trp53" in mice, most authors call it "p53" in both (and even refuse to call it "TP53" if edits or queries try to), not least because of the biologic principle that many proteins are essentially or exactly the same molecules regardless of mammalian species. Regarding the gene, authors are usually willing to call it by its human-specific symbol and capitalization, ''TP53'', and may even do so without being prompted by a query. But the end result of all these factors is that the published literature often does not follow the nomenclature guidelines completely.

'''Genetically modified crops''' ('''GM crops''' or '''biotech crops''') are plants used in [[agriculture]], the [[DNA]] of which has been modified using [[genetic engineering]] methods. In most cases, the aim is to introduce a new [[trait (biology)|trait]] to the plant which does not occur naturally in the species. Examples in food crops include resistance to certain pests, diseases, or environmental conditions, reduction of spoilage, or resistance to chemical treatments (e.g. resistance to a [[herbicide]]), or improving the nutrient profile of the crop. Examples in non-food crops include production of [[Plant manufactured pharmaceuticals|pharmaceutical agents]], [[biofuels]], and other industrially useful goods, as well as for [[bioremediation]].&lt;ref name="James2013"&gt;ISAAA 2013 Annual Report [http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/briefs/46/executivesummary/ Executive Summary, Global Status of Commercialized Biotech/GM Crops: 2013] ISAAA Brief 46-2013, Retrieved 6 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Farmers have widely adopted GM technology. It is the fastest adopted crop technology in the world. Acreage increased from 1.7 million hectares in 1996 to 185.1 million hectares in 2016, some 12% of global cropland. As of 2016, major crop (soybean, maize, canola and cotton) traits consist of herbicide tolerance (95.9 million hectares) insect resistance (25.2 million hectares), or both (58.5 million hectares). In 2015, 53.6 million ha of GM maize were under cultivation (almost 1/3 of the maize crop). GM maize outperformed  its predecessors: yield was 5.6 to 24.5% higher with less [[mycotoxin]]s (−28.8%), [[Fumonisin B1|fumonisin]] (−30.6%) and thricotecens (−36.5%). Non-target organisms were unaffected, except for ''[[Braconidae]]'', represented by a [[parasitoid]] of [[European corn borer]], the target of ''[[Lepidoptera]]'' active Bt maize. Biogeochemical parameters such as lignin content did not vary, while biomass decomposition was higher.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pellegrino|first=Elisa|last2=Bedini|first2=Stefano|last3=Nuti|first3=Marco|last4=Ercoli|first4=Laura|date=15 February 2018|title=Impact of genetically engineered maize on agronomic, environmental and toxicological traits: a meta-analysis of 21 years of field data|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21284-2|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|pages=3113|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-21284-2|issn=2045-2322|pmc=5814441|pmid=29449686|bibcode=2018NatSR...8.3113P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GM jury reached the conclusion that the sale of GM foods currently available should be halted and the moratorium on commercial growth of GM crops should be continued. These conclusions were based on the precautionary principle and lack of evidence of any benefit. The Jury expressed concern over the impact of GM crops on farming, the environment, food safety and other potential health effects.&lt;br/&gt;The Royal Society review (2002) concluded that the risks to human health associated with the use of specific viral DNA sequences in GM plants are negligible, and while calling for caution in the introduction of potential allergens into food crops, stressed the absence of evidence that commercially available GM foods cause clinical allergic manifestations.

==Methods==
{{Main|Genetic engineering techniques}}

[[File:Transformation with Agrobacterium.JPG|thumb|Plants (''Solanum chacoense'') being transformed using agrobacterium]]
Genetically engineered crops have genes added or removed using [[genetic engineering]] techniques,&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Boyle for Popular Science.  24 January 2011. [http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2011-01/life-cycle-genetically-modified-seed?single-page-view=true How To Genetically Modify a Seed, Step By Step]&lt;/ref&gt; originally including [[gene gun]]s, [[electroporation]], [[microinjection]] and [[agrobacterium]]. More recently, [[CRISPR]] and [[Transcription activator-like effector nuclease|TALEN]] offered much more precise and convenient editing techniques.

Gene guns (also known as biolistics) "shoot" (direct high energy particles or radiations against&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bombarded|title=Bombarded - Define Bombarded at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;) target genes into plant cells. It is the most common method. [[DNA]] is bound to tiny particles of gold or tungsten which are subsequently shot into plant tissue or single plant cells under high pressure. The accelerated particles penetrate both the [[cell wall]] and [[cell membrane|membranes]]. The DNA separates from the metal and is integrated into plant DNA inside the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]]. This method has been applied successfully for many cultivated crops, especially [[monocot]]s like wheat or maize, for which [[transformation (genetics)|transformation]] using ''Agrobacterium tumefaciens'' has been less successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Shrawat | first1 = A.| last2 = Lörz | first2 = H.| title = Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of cereals: a promising approach crossing barriers| journal = Plant Biotechnology Journal| volume = 4| issue = 6| pages = 575–603| year = 2006| pmid = 17309731| doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7652.2006.00209.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major disadvantage of this procedure is that serious damage can be done to the cellular tissue.

''[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens]]-''mediated transformation is another common technique. Agrobacteria are natural plant [[parasites]].&lt;ref name="Halford"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/785724094|title=Genetically modified crops|last=G.|first=Halford, Nigel|date=2012|publisher=Imperial College Press|others=World Scientific (Firm)|isbn=978-1848168381|edition=2nd|location=London|oclc=785724094}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their natural ability to transfer genes provides another engineering method. To create a suitable environment for themselves, these Agrobacteria insert their genes into plant hosts, resulting in a proliferation of modified plant cells near the soil level ([[crown gall]]). The genetic information for tumor growth is encoded on a mobile, circular DNA fragment ([[plasmid]]). When ''Agrobacterium'' infects a plant, it transfers this [[Ti plasmid|T-DNA]] to a random site in the plant genome. When used in genetic engineering the bacterial T-DNA is removed from the bacterial plasmid and replaced with the desired foreign gene. The bacterium is a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], enabling transportation of foreign genes into plants. This method works especially well for [[dicotyledon]]ous plants like potatoes, tomatoes, and tobacco. Agrobacteria infection is less successful in crops like wheat and maize.

Electroporation is used when the plant tissue does not contain cell walls. In this technique, "DNA enters the plant cells through miniature pores which are temporarily caused by electric pulses."

Microinjection is used to directly inject foreign DNA into cells.&lt;ref&gt;Maghari, Behrokh Mohajer, and Ali M. Ardekani. "Genetically Modified Foods And Social Concerns." Avicenna Journal of Medical Biotechnology 3.3 (2011): 109-117. Academic Search Premier. Web. 7 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant scientists, backed by results of modern comprehensive profiling of crop composition, point out that crops modified using GM techniques are less likely to have unintended changes than are conventionally bred crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isb.vt.edu/news/2006/news06.jan.htm#jan0603|title=Information Systems for Biotechnology News Report|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Catchpole|first1=G.

Introducing new genes into plants requires a [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] specific to the area where the gene is to be expressed. For instance, to express a gene only in rice grains and not in leaves, an [[endosperm]]-specific promoter is used. The [[codons]] of the gene must be optimized for the organism due to [[codon usage bias]].

== Types of modifications ==
[[File:Btcornafrica.jpg|thumb|[[Transgenic maize]] containing a gene from the bacteria ''Bacillus thuringiensis'']]

=== Transgenic ===
[[Transgenesis|Transgenic]] plants have genes inserted into them that are derived from another species.

=== Cisgenic ===
[[cisgenesis|Cisgenic]] plants are made using genes found within the same species or a closely related one, where conventional [[plant breeding]] can occur. Some breeders and scientists argue that cisgenic modification is useful for plants that are difficult to [[crossbreed]] by conventional means (such as [[potatoes]]), and that plants in the cisgenic category should not require the same regulatory scrutiny as transgenics.&lt;ref&gt;MacKenzie, Deborah (2 August 2008).

=== Subgenic ===
Genetically modified plants can also be developed using [[gene knockdown]] or [[gene knockout]] to alter the genetic makeup of a plant without incorporating genes from other plants. In 2014, Chinese researcher Gao Caixia filed patents on the creation of a strain of [[wheat]] that is resistant to [[powdery mildew]]. The strain lacks genes that encode proteins that repress defenses against the mildew. The researchers deleted all three copies of the genes from wheat's [[hexaploid]] genome. Gao used the [[Transcription activator-like effector nuclease|TALENs]] and [[CRISPR]] [[genome editing|gene editing]] tools without adding or changing any other genes. No field trials were immediately planned.&lt;ref name=tr1407&gt;{{cite web|last=Talbot |first=David |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/529181/chinese-researchers-stop-wheat-disease-with-gene-editing/ |title=Beijing Researchers Use Gene Editing to Create Disease-Resistant Wheat &amp;#124; MIT Technology Review |publisher=Technologyreview.com |date=19 July 2014 |accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2969 | title=Simultaneous editing of three homoeoalleles in hexaploid bread wheat confers heritable resistance to powdery mildew | journal=Nature Biotechnology | date=2014 | first=Yanpeng | last=Wang | volume=32 | issue=9 | pages=947–51 | pmid=25038773}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CRISPR technique has also been used to modify white button mushrooms (''[[Agaricus bisporus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Waltz|first1=Emily|title=Gene-edited CRISPR mushroom escapes US regulation|url=http://www.nature.com/news/gene-edited-crispr-mushroom-escapes-us-regulation-1.19754|website=nature.com|publisher=Nature|accessdate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics challenged the claimed benefits to farmers over the prevalence of biased observers and by the absence of [[randomized controlled trial]]s.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The main Bt crop grown by small farmers in developing countries is cotton.

In 2013 the European Academies Science Advisory Council (EASAC) asked the EU to allow the development of agricultural GM technologies to enable more sustainable agriculture, by employing fewer land, water, and nutrient resources. EASAC also criticizes the EU's "time-consuming and expensive regulatory framework" and said that the EU had fallen behind in the adoption of GM technologies.&lt;ref name=easac&gt;[http://www.easac.eu/home/reports-and-statements/detail-view/article/planting-the.html Planting the future: opportunities and challenges for using crop genetic improvement technologies for sustainable agriculture], EASAC policy report 21, 27.06.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants in agriculture business markets include seed companies, agrochemical companies, distributors, farmers, grain elevators and universities that develop new crops/traits and whose agricultural extensions advise farmers on best practices.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} According to a 2012 review based on data from the late 1990s and early 2000s, much of the GM crop grown each year is used for livestock feed and increased demand for meat leads to increased demand for GM feed crops.&lt;ref name="Rajib"&gt;Rajib Deb, et al.

Some patents on GM traits have expired, allowing the legal development of generic strains that include these traits. For example, generic glyphosate-tolerant GM soybean is now available.

== Yield ==
In 2014, the largest review yet concluded that GM crops' effects on farming were positive. The [[meta-analysis]] considered all published English-language examinations of the agronomic and economic impacts between 1995 and March 2014 for three major GM crops: soybean, maize, and cotton. The study found that herbicide-tolerant crops have lower production costs, while for insect-resistant crops the reduced pesticide use was offset by higher seed prices, leaving overall production costs about the same.&lt;ref name="KlumperQaim"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Klümper | first1 = W | last2 = Qaim | first2 = M | year = 2014 | title = A Meta-Analysis of the Impacts of Genetically Modified Crops | url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111629 | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 9 | issue = 11| page = e111629 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0111629 | pmid=25365303|bibcode = 2014PLoSO...9k1629K | pmc=4218791}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21630961-biggest-study-so-far-finds-gm-crops-have-large-widespread-benefits-field|title = Genetically modified crops - Field research|date= 8 November 2014|work = Economist|accessdate =3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yields increased 9% for herbicide tolerance and 25% for insect resistant varieties. Farmers who adopted GM crops made 69% higher profits than those who did not. The review found that GM crops help farmers in developing countries, increasing yields by 14 percentage points.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The researchers considered some studies that were not peer-reviewed and a few that did not report sample sizes. They attempted to correct for [[publication bias]], by considering sources beyond [[academic journals]]. The large data set allowed the study to control for potentially confounding variables such as fertilizer use. Separately, they concluded that the funding source did not influence study results.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Traits==
GM crops grown today, or under development, have been modified with various [[Phenotypic trait|traits]]. These traits include improved [[shelf life]], [[Plant_disease_resistance|disease resistance]], stress resistance, [[herbicide resistance]], [[pest resistance]], production of useful goods such as biofuel or drugs, and ability to absorb toxins and for use in [[bioremediation]] of pollution.

Recently, [[research and development]] has been targeted to [[crop enhancement|enhancement of crops]] that are locally important in [[developing countries]], such as insect-resistant [[cowpea]] for Africa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seedquest.com/News/releases/2006/august/16608.htm|title=SeedQuest - Central information website for the global seed industry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and insect-resistant [[Bt brinjal|brinjal]] (eggplant).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/pocketk/35/default.asp|title=Bt Brinjal in India - Pocket K - ISAAA.org|website=www.isaaa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Improved photosynthesis ===
Plants use [[non-photochemical quenching]] (NPQ) to protect them from excessive amounts of sunlight. Plants can switch on the quenching mechanism almost instantaneously but it takes much longer for it to switch off again. During the time that it is switched off, the amount of energy that is wasted increases.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} A genetic modification in three genes allows to correct this (in a trial with tobacco plants). As a result, yields were 14-20% higher, in terms of the weight of the dry leaves harvested. The plants had bigger leaves, were taller and had more vigorous roots.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/17/plants-genetically-modified-to-boost-photosynthesis-produce-greater-yields-study-shows Plants modified to boost photosynthesis produce greater yields, study shows]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6314/857 Improving photosynthesis and crop productivity by accelerating recovery from photoprotection]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another improvement that can be made on the photosynthesis process (with [[C3 carbon fixation|C3 pathway plants]]) is on [[photorespiration]]. By inserting the C4 pathway into C3 plants, productivity may increase by as much as 50% for [[cereal crop]]s, such as rice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://theconversation.com/how-gm-crops-can-help-us-to-feed-a-fast-growing-world-71112 How GM crops can help us to feed a fast-growing world]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.technologyreview.com/s/535011/supercharged-photosynthesis/ Advanced genetic tools could help boost crop yields and feed billions more people.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2017/10/24/supercharged-gmo-rice-variety-increase-yields-50-percent-improved-photosynthesis/ ‘Supercharged’ GMO rice could increase yields 50 percent with improved photosynthesis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=4883725|year=2013|last1=Karki|first1=S|title=Improvement of photosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.) by inserting the C4 pathway|journal=Rice|volume=6|issue=1|pages=28|last2=Rizal|first2=G|last3=Quick|first3=W.

Drought resistance occurs by modifying the plant's genes responsible for the mechanism known as the [[crassulacean acid metabolism]] (CAM), which allows the plants to survive despite low water levels. This holds promise for water-heavy crops such as rice, wheat, soybeans and poplar to accelerate their adaptation to water-limited environments.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/drought-resistant-crops-plants-genetic-engineering-a8091816.html Scientists aim to develop drought-resistant crops using genetic engineering]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307873609_Genetically_Modified_Crops_with_Drought_Tolerance_Achievements_Challenges_and_Perspectives Genetically Modified Crops with Drought Tolerance: Achievements, Challenges, and Perspectives]&lt;/ref&gt; Several salinity tolerance mechanisms have been identified in salt-tolerant crops.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958166913007192 Salt resistant crop plants]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, rice, canola and tomato crops have been genetically modified to increase their tolerance to salt stress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/pocketk/31/default.asp Pocket K No. 31: Biotechnology with Salinity for Coping in Problem Soils]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scidev.net/global/biotechnology/news/genetic-change-could-make-crops-thrive-on-salty-so.html Genetic change could make crops thrive on salty soils]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Herbicides ====

===== Glyphosate =====
As of 1999, the most prevalent GM trait was [[glyphosate]]-tolerance.&lt;ref name="agbioforum1999" /&gt;{{update inline|reason=Still true 18 years later?|date=July 2017}} Glyphosate (the active ingredient in Roundup and other herbicide products) kills plants by interfering with the [[shikimic acid|shikimate]] pathway in plants, which is essential for the synthesis of the [[Aromatic amino acids|aromatic]] amino acids [[phenylalanine]], [[tyrosine]], and [[tryptophan]]. The shikimate pathway is not present in animals, which instead obtain aromatic amino acids from their diet. More specifically, glyphosate inhibits the enzyme [[EPSP synthase|5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase]] (EPSPS).

This trait was developed because the herbicides used on grain and grass crops at the time were highly toxic and not effective against narrow-leaved weeds. Thus, developing crops that could withstand spraying with glyphosate would both reduce environmental and health risks, and give an agricultural edge to the farmer.&lt;ref name="agbioforum1999"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carpenter | first1 = J. | last2 = Gianessi | first2 = L. | year = 1999 | title = Herbicide tolerant soybeans: Why growers are adopting Roundup Ready varieties | url = http://agbioforum.org/v2n2/v2n2a02-carpenter.htm | journal = AgBioForum | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 65–72 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some micro-organisms have a version of EPSPS that is resistant to glyphosate inhibition. One of these was isolated from an ''[[Agrobacterium]]'' strain CP4 (CP4 EPSPS) that was resistant to glyphosate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2135/cropsci2005.0329 | title = Development and Characterization of a CP4 EPSPS-Based, Glyphosate-Tolerant Corn Event | author = G.

This transit peptide was used because it had shown previously an ability to deliver bacterial EPSPS to the chloroplasts of other plants. This CP4 EPSPS gene was [[Cloning#Molecular cloning|cloned]] and [[Transfection|transfected]] into [[soybeans]].

The [[plasmid]] used to move the gene into soybeans was PV-GMGTO4. It contained three bacterial genes, two CP4 EPSPS genes, and a gene [[encoding]] [[beta-glucuronidase]] (GUS) from ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' as a marker. The DNA was injected into the soybeans using the [[gene gun|particle acceleration method]]. Soybean cultivar A54O3 was used for the [[transformation (genetics)|transformation]].

===Bioremediation===

Retrieved 20 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 16 million hectares in the US (1.5% of the total surface) are estimated to be contaminated with TNT and RDX. However ''A. thaliana'' was not tough enough for use on military test grounds.&lt;ref name="Growing a grass that loves bombs"&gt;Chard, Abigail (2011) [http://www.britishscienceassociation.org/web/News/FestivalNews/Growingagrassthatlovesbombs.htm Growing a grass that loves bombs] The British Science Association.

Marine environments are especially vulnerable since pollution such as [[oil spills]] are not containable. In addition to anthropogenic pollution, millions of tons of [[petroleum]] annually enter the marine environment from natural seepages. Despite its toxicity, a considerable fraction of petroleum oil entering marine systems is eliminated by the hydrocarbon-degrading activities of microbial communities. Particularly successful is a recently discovered group of specialists, the so-called [[hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria]] (HCCB) that may offer useful genes.&lt;ref name=chapter9&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/biod|author=Martins VAP|year=2008|chapter=Genomic Insights into Oil Biodegradation in Marine Systems|title=Microbial Biodegradation: Genomics and Molecular Biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|url=http://www.lefitummidi.webs.com/biod|isbn=978-1-904455-17-2}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asexual reproduction===

Crops such as [[maize]] reproduce sexually each year. This randomizes which genes get propagated to the next generation, meaning that desirable traits can be lost. To maintain a high-quality crop, some farmers purchase seeds every year. Typically, the seed company maintains two [[inbred]] varieties and crosses them into a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] strain that is then sold. Related plants like [[sorghum]] and gamma grass are able to perform [[apomixis]], a form of asexual reproduction that keeps the plant's DNA intact. This trait is apparently controlled by a single dominant gene, but traditional breeding has been unsuccessful in creating asexually-reproducing maize. Genetic engineering offers another route to this goal. Successful modification would allow farmers to replant harvested seeds that retain desirable traits, rather than relying on purchased seed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1 March 2003|periodical=[[Technology Review]]|author=Daniel Charles|title=Corn That Clones Itself|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/401826/corn-that-clones-itself/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
Genetic modifications to some crops also exist, which make it easier to process the crop. For instance, the [[Onion#Eye irritation|"no tears" onion]] prevents the synthesis of lachrymatory factor synthase in onions (otherwise put, it does not irritate the eyes when the onion is cut.

Also, some crops (such as tomatoes) have been genetic modified to contain no seed at all.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/2127640-gene-editing-opens-doors-to-seedless-fruit-with-no-need-for-bees/ Gene editing opens doors to seedless fruit with no need for bees]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development ===
The number of USDA-approved field releases for testing grew from 4 in 1985 to 1,194 in 2002 and averaged around 800 per year thereafter. The number of sites per release and the number of gene constructs (ways that the gene of interest is packaged together with other elements)&amp;nbsp;– have rapidly increased since 2005. Releases with agronomic properties (such as drought resistance) jumped from 1,043 in 2005 to 5,190 in 2013. As of September 2013, about 7,800 releases had been approved for corn, more than 2,200 for soybeans, more than 1,100 for cotton, and about 900 for potatoes. Releases were approved for herbicide tolerance (6,772 releases), insect resistance (4,809), product quality such as flavor or nutrition (4,896), agronomic properties like drought resistance (5,190), and virus/fungal resistance (2,616). The institutions with the most authorized field releases include Monsanto with 6,782, Pioneer/DuPont with 1,405, Syngenta with 565, and USDA’s Agricultural Research Service with 370. As of September 2013 USDA had received proposals for releasing GM rice, squash, plum, rose, tobacco, flax, and chicory.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/1282242/err162_summary.pdf|title=Genetically Engineered Crops in the United States (summary)|date=February 2014|accessdate=3 October 2016|website=Economic Research Service USDA|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|last=Fernandez-Cornejo|first=Jorge|first2=Seth|last2=Wechsler|first3=Mike|last3=Livingston|first4=Lorraine|last4=Mitchell|page=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127005201/http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/1282242/err162_summary.pdf|archive-date=27 November 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resistance===

====''Bacillus thuringiensis''====
Constant exposure to a toxin creates [[evolutionary pressure]] for pests resistant to that toxin. Over-reliance on [[glyphosate]] and a reduction in the diversity of weed management practices allowed the spread of glyphosate resistance in 14 weed species in the US,&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; and in soybeans.&lt;ref name=perry/&gt;

To reduce resistance to ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' (Bt) crops, the 1996 commercialization of transgenic cotton and maize came with a management strategy to prevent insects from becoming resistant. Insect resistance management plans are mandatory for Bt crops. The aim is to encourage a large population of pests so that any (recessive) resistance genes are diluted within the population. Resistance lowers evolutionary fitness in the absence of the stressor, Bt. In refuges, non-resistant strains outcompete resistant ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tabashnik | first1 =  | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2003 | title = Insect Resistance to Transgenic Bt Crops: Lessons from the Laboratory and Field | url = http://www.gmo-safety.eu/pdf/dokumente/bt_tabashnik.pdf | format = PDF | journal = J. Econ. Entomol. | volume = 96 | issue = 4 | pages = 1031–38 | doi = 10.1603/0022-0493-96.4.1031 | pmid = 14503572 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130314215007/http://www.gmo-safety.eu/pdf/dokumente/bt_tabashnik.pdf | archivedate = 14 March 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With sufficiently high levels of transgene expression, nearly all of the heterozygotes (S/s), i.e., the largest segment of the pest population carrying a resistance allele, will be killed before maturation, thus preventing transmission of the resistance gene to their progeny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author =Roush RT | year= 1997 | title=Bt-transgenic crops: just another pretty insecticide or a chance for a new start in the resistance management? | journal = Pestic. Sci. | volume = 51 | issue =3 | pages=328–34 | doi =10.1002/(SICI)1096-9063(199711)51:3&lt;328::AID-PS650&gt;3.0.CO;2-B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refuges (i. e., fields of nontransgenic plants) adjacent to transgenic fields increases the likelihood that homozygous resistant (s/s) individuals and any surviving heterozygotes will mate with susceptible (S/S) individuals from the refuge, instead of with other individuals carrying the resistance allele. As a result, the resistance gene frequency in the population remains lower.

Complicating factors can affect the success of the high-dose/refuge strategy. For example, if the temperature is not ideal, thermal stress can lower Bt toxin production and leave the plant more susceptible. More importantly, reduced late-season expression has been documented, possibly resulting from [[DNA methylation]] of the [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year= 2007 | title= Variability of Endotoxin Expression in Bt Transgenic Cotton | journal= Journal of Agronomy &amp; Crop Science | volume= 193 | pages=21–29 | doi=10.1111/j.1439-037X.2006.00240.x | author= Dong, H. Z. | last2= Li | first2= W. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the high-dose/refuge strategy has successfully maintained the value of Bt crops. This success has depended on factors independent of management strategy, including low initial resistance allele frequencies, fitness costs associated with resistance, and the abundance of non-Bt host plants outside the refuges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tabashnik BE, Carrière Y, Dennehy TJ |title=Insect resistance to transgenic Bt crops: lessons from the laboratory and field |journal=J.

Companies that produce Bt seed are introducing strains with multiple Bt proteins. Monsanto did this with Bt cotton in India, where the product was rapidly adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/Pages/india-pink-bollworm.aspx|title=Monsanto - Pink Bollworm Resistance to GM Cotton in India|author=APPDMZ\ccvivr|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monsanto has also; in an attempt to simplify the process of implementing refuges in fields to comply with Insect Resistance Management(IRM) policies and prevent irresponsible planting practices; begun marketing seed bags with a set proportion of refuge (non-transgenic) seeds mixed in with the Bt seeds being sold. Coined "Refuge-In-a-Bag" (RIB), this practice is intended to increase farmer compliance with refuge requirements and reduce additional labor needed at planting from having separate Bt and refuge seed bags on hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Real Deal: Explaining Monsanto's Refuge-in-the-Bag Concept|url = http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/explaining-refuge-in-the-bag-concept.aspx|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100910040406/http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/Pages/Explaining-Refuge-in-the-Bag-Concept.aspx|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 10 September 2010|website = www.monsanto.com|accessdate = 3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy is likely to reduce the likelihood of Bt-resistance occurring for [[corn rootworm]], but may increase the risk of resistance for [[lepidopteran]] corn pests, such as [[European corn borer]]. Increased concerns for resistance with seed mixtures include partially resistant larvae on a Bt plant being able to move to a susceptible plant to survive or cross pollination of refuge pollen on to Bt plants that can lower the amount of Bt expressed in kernels for ear feeding insects.&lt;ref name="Siegfried"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Siegfried|first=B.D.|title= Understanding successful resistance management |journal= GM Crops &amp; Food |volume= 3 |issue= 3 |pages= 184–93 |year= 2012 |url= http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1060&amp;context=ent_pubs |doi=10.4161/gmcr.20715|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Devos"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Devos|first=Y.|title= Resistance evolution to the first generation of genetically modified Diabrotica-active Bt-maize events by western corn rootworm: management and monitoring considerations |journal= Transgenic Research |volume= 22  |issue=2|pages= 269–99 |year= 2013 |url= http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2247&amp;context=usdaarsfacpub |doi=10.1007/s11248-012-9657-4|display-authors=etal |pmid=23011587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Herbicide resistance====
[[Best management practices]] (BMPs) to control weeds may help delay resistance. BMPs include applying multiple herbicides with different modes of action, rotating crops, planting weed-free seed, scouting fields routinely, cleaning equipment to reduce the transmission of weeds to other fields, and maintaining field borders.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; The most widely planted GM crops are designed to tolerate herbicides. By 2006 some weed populations had evolved to tolerate some of the same herbicides. [[Palmer amaranth]] is a weed that competes with cotton. A native of the southwestern US, it traveled east and was first found resistant to glyphosate in 2006, less than 10 years after GM cotton was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Culpepper, Stanley A|title=Glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) confirmed in Georgia|volume=54|issue=4|pages=620–26|year=2006|journal=Weed Science|doi=10.1614/ws-06-001r.1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gallant, Andre|title=Pigweed in the Cotton: A superweed invades Georgia|journal=Modern Farmer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plant protection ===
Farmers generally use less insecticide when they plant Bt-resistant crops. Insecticide use on corn farms declined from 0.21 pound per planted acre in 1995 to 0.02 pound in 2010. This is consistent with the decline in [[European corn borer]] populations as a direct result of Bt corn and cotton. The establishment of minimum refuge requirements helped delay the evolution of Bt resistance. However, resistance appears to be developing to some Bt traits in some areas.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

===Tillage===
By leaving at least 30% of crop residue on the soil surface from harvest through planting, [[conservation tillage]] reduces soil erosion from wind and water, increases water retention, and reduces soil degradation as well as water and chemical runoff. In addition, conservation tillage reduces the carbon footprint of agriculture.&lt;ref name=till&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.agbioforum.org/v15n3/v15n3a01-fernandez-cornejo.htm|title = Conservation Tillage, Herbicide Use, and Genetically Engineered Crops in the United States: The Case of Soybeans|last = Fernandez-Cornejo |first = Jorge |first2=Charlie |last2 = Hallahan, |first3 = Richard |last3 = Nehring,  |first4 = Seth |last4 = Wechsler |first5 = Arthur |last5 = Grube|date = 2014|journal = AgBioForum|doi = |pmid = |access-date =3 October 2016|volume = 15|issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 review covering 12 states from 1996 to 2006, found that a 1% increase in herbicde-tolerant (HT) soybean adoption leads to a 0.21% increase in conservation tillage and a 0.3% decrease in quality-adjusted herbicide use.&lt;ref name=till/&gt;

==Regulation==
{{main|Regulation of genetic engineering|Regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms}}

The regulation of genetic engineering concerns the approaches taken by governments to assess and manage the risks associated with the development and release of genetically modified crops. There are differences in the regulation of GM crops between countries, with some of the most marked differences occurring between the US and Europe. Regulation varies in a given country depending on the intended use of each product. For example, a crop not intended for food use is generally not reviewed by authorities responsible for food safety.&lt;ref name="Wesseler-2011"&gt;[[Justus Wesseler|Wesseler]], J. and N.

Farmers have widely adopted GM technology (see figure). Between 1996 and 2013, the total surface area of land cultivated with GM crops increased by a factor of 100, from {{convert|17000|km2|acre|sp=us}} to 1,750,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (432 million acres).&lt;ref name="James2013" /&gt; 10% of the world's [[arable land]] was planted with GM crops in 2010.&lt;ref name="James2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/briefs/43/executivesummary/default.asp|title=ISAAA Brief 43, Global Status of Commercialized Biotech/GM Crops: 2011|last=James|first=C|year=2011|work=ISAAA Briefs|publisher=International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA)|location=Ithaca, New York|accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, 11 different transgenic crops were grown commercially on 395 million acres (160 million hectares) in 29 countries such as the US, Brazil, Argentina, India, Canada, China, Paraguay, Pakistan, South Africa, Uruguay, Bolivia, Australia, Philippines, Myanmar, Burkina Faso, Mexico and Spain.&lt;ref name="James2011" /&gt; One of the key reasons for this widespread adoption is the perceived economic benefit the technology brings to farmers. For example, the system of planting glyphosate-resistant seed and then applying glyphosate once plants emerged provided farmers with the opportunity to dramatically increase the yield from a given plot of land, since this allowed them to plant rows closer together. Without it, farmers had to plant rows far enough apart to control post-emergent weeds with mechanical tillage.&lt;ref name="HighPlainsJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpj.com/archives/roundup-ready-soybean-trait-patent-nears-expiration-in/article_8c7a83b7-2a37-5291-9204-2633eb3e4c0d.html |title=Roundup Ready soybean trait patent nears expiration in 2014 |publisher=Hpj.com |accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, using Bt seeds means that farmers do not have to purchase insecticides, and then invest time, fuel, and equipment in applying them. However critics have disputed whether yields are higher and whether chemical use is less, with GM crops. See [[Genetically modified food controversies]] article for information.

==Controversy==
{{Main|Genetically modified food controversies}}

Direct genetic engineering has been controversial since its introduction. Most, but not all of the controversies are over GM foods rather than crops per se. GM foods are the subject of protests, vandalism, referenda, legislation, court action&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2015) [http://orgprints.org/29110/8/29110.pdf The threat of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to organic agriculture: A case study update], Agriculture &amp; Food, 3: 56-63.&lt;/ref&gt; and scientific disputes. The controversies involve consumers, biotechnology companies, governmental regulators, non-governmental organizations and scientists.

Opponents have objected to GM crops on multiple grounds including environmental impacts, food safety, whether GM crops are needed to address food needs, whether they are sufficiently accessible to farmers in developing countries&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; and concerns over subjecting crops to [[intellectual property]] law. Secondary issues include labeling, the behavior of government regulators, the effects of pesticide use and pesticide tolerance.

A significant environmental concern about using genetically modified crops is possible cross-breeding with related crops, giving them advantages over naturally occurring varieties. One example is a glyphosate-resistant rice crop that crossbreeds with a weedy relative, giving the weed a competitive advantage. The transgenic hybrid had higher rates of photosynthesis, more shoots and flowers, and more seeds than the non-transgenic hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Qiu|first=Jane|date=2013-08-16|title=Genetically modified crops pass benefits to weeds|url=https://www.nature.com/news/genetically-modified-crops-pass-benefits-to-weeds-1.13517|journal=Nature|language=en|doi=10.1038/nature.2013.13517|issn=1476-4687}}&lt;/ref&gt; This demonstrates the possibility of ecosystem damage by GM crop usage.

There is a [[scientific consensus]]&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ronald 11–20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food,&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Library of Congress" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nap.edu" /&gt; but that each GM food needs to be tested on a case-by-case basis before introduction.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Haslberger 2003 739–741" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4" /&gt; Nonetheless, members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe.&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marris 2001 545–548" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Final Report of the PABE research project" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto5" /&gt; The legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by country, with some nations banning or restricting them, and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation.&lt;ref name="loc.gov" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bashshur" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sifferlin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Council on Foreign Relations" /&gt;

[[File:Heat Pump.jpg|thumb|265px|Outdoor components of a residential air-source heat pump]]
A '''heat pump''' is a device that transfers heat energy from a source of heat to what is called a [[heat sink]]. Heat pumps move [[thermal energy]] in the opposite direction of spontaneous heat transfer, by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. A heat pump uses a small amount of external power to accomplish the work of transferring energy from the heat source to the heat sink.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hQDOBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=%22heat+pump%22+%22heat+sink%22+opposite+direction#v=onepage&amp;q=%22heat%20pump%22%20%22heat%20sink%22%20opposite%20direction&amp;f=false|title=Sustainable Energy Solutions in Agriculture |last=Bundschuh |first=Jochen |last2=Chen|first2=Guangnan|date=2014-03-07|publisher=CRC Press|year=|isbn=9781315778716|location=|pages=111|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most common design of a heat pump involves four main components – a [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]], an [[Thermal expansion valve|expansion valve]], an [[evaporator]] and a [[compressor]]. The heat transfer medium circulated through these components is called [[refrigerant]].&lt;ref&gt;https://heatpumpingtechnologies.org/market-technology/heat-pump-work/ Article on IEA HPT TCP How does a heat pump work?&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[air conditioner]]s and [[freezer]]s are familiar examples of heat pumps, the term "heat pump" is more general and applies to many [[HVAC]] (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) devices used for space heating or space cooling. When a heat pump is used for heating, it employs the same basic [[Heat pump and refrigeration cycle|refrigeration-type cycle]] used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator, but in the opposite direction – releasing heat into the conditioned space rather than the surrounding environment. In this use, heat pumps generally draw heat from the cooler external air or from the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy01osti/28037.pdf Air-source heat pumps] [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In heating mode, heat pumps are three to four times more effective at heating than simple [[Electric heating|electrical resistance heater]]s using the same amount of electricity. However, the typical cost of installing a heat pump is also higher than that of a resistance heater.

When discussing about and comparing energy efficiency of heat pumping applications some different factors are mainly used, COP ([[Coefficient of Performance]]), SCOP ([[Seasonal Coefficient of Performance]]) and SPF ([[Seasonal Performance Factor]]). The more efficient a heat pump is the less energy consuming it will be and the more cost-effective it can be to operate. There are several factors that will affect the efficiency of a heat pump such as climate, temperature, auxiliary equipment, technology, size and control system.&lt;ref&gt;https://heatpumpingtechnologies.org/market-technology/efficiency-heat-pumps/ IEA HPT TCP Efficiency and heat pumping application&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{main|Heat pump and refrigeration cycle}}
[[Heat|Heat energy]] naturally transfers from warmer places to colder spaces. However, a heat pump can reverse this process, by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. Heat is not conserved in this process and requires some amount of external energy, such as electricity. In heating, ventilation and air conditioning ([[HVAC]]) systems, the term ''heat pump'' usually refers to [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] devices optimized for high efficiency in both directions of thermal energy transfer. These heat pumps can be reversible, and work in either direction to provide heating or cooling to the internal space.

Heat pumps are used to transfer heat because less high-grade energy is required than is released as heat. Most of the energy for heating comes from the external environment, only a fraction of which comes from electricity (or some other high-grade energy source required to run a compressor). In electrically-powered heat pumps, the heat transferred can be three or four times larger than the electrical power consumed, giving the system a coefficient of performance (COP) of 3 or 4, as opposed to a COP of 1 for a conventional electrical resistance heater, in which all heat is produced from input electrical energy.

Heat pumps use a refrigerant as an intermediate fluid to absorb heat where it vaporizes, in the evaporator, and then to release heat where the refrigerant condenses, in the condenser. The refrigerant flows through insulated pipes between the evaporator and the condenser, allowing for efficient thermal energy transfer at relatively long distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BxEOvbuMSGgC&amp;pg=PA224&amp;dq=%22heat+pump%22+refrigerant+evaporator+condenser+efficient+thermal+energy+transfer#v=onepage&amp;q=%22heat%20pump%22%20refrigerant%20evaporator%20condenser%20efficient%20thermal%20energy%20transfer%20distance&amp;f=false|title=The Future of Energy Use|last=O'Keefe|first=Philip|last2=O'Brien|first2=Geoff|last3=Pearsall|first3=Nicola|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Earthscan|year=|isbn=9781844075041|location=|pages=224|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reversible heat pumps===
Reversible heat pumps work in either direction to provide heating or cooling to the internal space. They employ a [[reversing valve]] to reverse the flow of refrigerant from the compressor through the condenser and evaporation coils.

In '''heating mode,''' the outdoor coil is an evaporator, while the indoor is a condenser. The refrigerant flowing from the evaporator (outdoor coil) carries the thermal energy from outside air (or soil, or better still, moving water) indoors. Vapor temperature is augmented within the pump by compressing it. The indoor coil then transfers thermal energy (including energy from the compression) to the indoor air, which is then moved around the inside of the building by an [[air handler]].

Alternatively, thermal energy is transferred to water, which is then used to heat the building via radiators or [[underfloor heating]]. The heated water may also be used for [[domestic hot water]] consumption.  The refrigerant is then allowed to expand, and hence cool, and absorb heat from the outdoor temperature in the outside evaporator, and the cycle repeats. This is a standard refrigeration cycle, save that the "cold" side of the refrigerator (the evaporator coil) is positioned so it is outdoors where the environment is colder.

In cold weather, the outdoor unit of an air source heat pump needs to be intermittently defrosted. This will cause the auxiliary or emergency heating elements (located in the air-handler) to be activated. At the same time, the frost on the outdoor coil will quickly be melted due to the warm refrigerant. The condenser/evaporator fan will not run during defrost mode.

In '''cooling mode''' the cycle is similar, but the outdoor coil is now the condenser and the indoor coil (which reaches a lower temperature) is the evaporator. This is the familiar mode in which air conditioners operate.

==Operating principles==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2016}}
Mechanical heat pumps exploit the physical properties of a volatile evaporating and [[Condensation|condensing]] fluid known as a [[refrigerant]]. The heat pump compresses the refrigerant to make it hotter on the side to be warmed, and releases the pressure at the side where heat is absorbed. [[File:Heatpump2.svg|thumb|300px|A simple stylized diagram of a heat pump's [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] cycle: 1)&amp;nbsp;[[condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]], 2)&amp;nbsp;[[Thermal expansion valve|expansion valve]], 3)&amp;nbsp;[[evaporator]], 4)&amp;nbsp;[[compressor]]]]
[[File:refrigeration PV diagram.svg|thumb|300px|A fictitious pressure-volume diagram for a typical refrigeration cycle]]
The [[Working fluids|working fluid]], in its gaseous state, is pressurized and circulated through the system by a [[Gas compressor|compressor]]. On the discharge side of the compressor, the now hot and highly pressurized vapor is cooled in a [[heat exchanger]], called a [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]], until it condenses into a high pressure, moderate temperature liquid. The condensed refrigerant then passes through a pressure-lowering device also called a metering device. This may be an [[Thermal expansion valve|expansion valve]], [[capillary]] tube, or possibly a work-extracting device such as a [[turbine]]. The low-pressure liquid refrigerant then enters another heat exchanger, the evaporator, in which the fluid absorbs heat and boils. The refrigerant then returns to the compressor and the cycle is repeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ruR7U3IjrR0C&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=%22heat+pump%22+turbine++expansion+valve,+capillary#v=onepage&amp;q=%22heat%20pump%22%20turbine%20%20expansion%20valve,%20capillary&amp;f=false|title=EXERGY: Energy, Environment and Sustainable Development|last=Dincer|first=Ibrahim|last2=Rosen|first2=Marc A.|date=2007-09-18|publisher=Elsevier|year=|isbn=9780080531359|location=|pages=98|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is essential that the refrigerant reaches a sufficiently high temperature, when compressed, to release heat through the "hot" heat exchanger (the condenser). Similarly, the fluid must reach a sufficiently low temperature when allowed to expand, or else heat cannot flow from the ambient cold region into the fluid in the cold heat exchanger (the evaporator). In particular, the pressure difference must be great enough for the fluid to condense at the hot side and still evaporate in the lower pressure region at the cold side. The greater the temperature difference, the greater the required pressure difference, and consequently the more energy needed to compress the fluid. Thus, as with all heat pumps, the [[coefficient of performance]] (amount of thermal energy moved per unit of input work required) decreases with increasing temperature difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.automaticheating.com.au/heat-pumps-explained/|title=Introduction to Heat Pumps|work=Automatic Heating|access-date=2018-11-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thermal insulation|Insulation]] is used to reduce the work and energy required to achieve a low enough temperature in the space to be cooled.

===Heat transport===
Heat is typically transferred through engineered heating or cooling systems by using a flowing gas or liquid.  Air is sometimes used, but quickly becomes impractical under many circumstances because it requires large ducts to transfer relatively small amounts of heat. In systems using refrigerant, this working fluid can also be used to transfer heat a considerable distance, though this can become impractical because of increased risk of expensive refrigerant leakage.  When large amounts of heat are to be transferred, water is typically used, often supplemented with [[antifreeze]], [[corrosion inhibitors]], and other additives.

===Heat sources/sinks===
A common source or sink for heat in smaller installations is the outside air, as used by an air-source heat pump.  A fan is needed to improve heat exchange efficiency.

Larger installations handling more heat, or in tight physical spaces, often use water-source heat pumps.  The heat is sourced or rejected in water flow, which can carry much larger amounts of heat through a given pipe or duct cross-section than air flow can carry.  The water may be heated at a remote location by [[boiler]]s, [[solar energy]], or other means.  Alternatively when needed, the water may be cooled by using a [[cooling tower]], or discharged into a large body of water, such as a lake, stream or an ocean.

[[Geothermal heat pump]]s or ground-source heat pumps use shallow underground heat exchangers as a heat source or sink, and water as the heat transfer medium.  This is possible because below ground level, the temperature is relatively constant across the seasons, and the earth can provide or absorb a large amount of heat. Ground source heat pumps work in the same way as air-source heat pumps, but exchange heat with the ground via water pumped through pipes in the ground. Ground source heat pumps are more simple and therefore more reliable than air source heat pumps as they do not need fan or defrosting systems and can be housed inside. Although a ground heat exchanger requires a higher initial capital cost, the annual running costs are lower, because well-designed ground source heat pump systems operate more efficiently because they start with a warmer source temperature than the air in winter.

Heat pump installations may be installed alongside an auxiliary conventional heat source such as electrical resistance heaters, or oil or gas combustion. The auxiliary source is installed to meet peak heating loads, or to provide a back-up system.

==Applications==
There are millions of domestic installations using air source heat pumps.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/buildings_roadmap.pdf pg16&lt;/ref&gt; They are used in climates with moderate space heating and cooling needs (HVAC) and may also provide domestic hot water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://energy.gov/energysaver/heat-pump-systems|title = Heat Pump Systems |publisher = U.S. Department of Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purchase costs are supported in various countries by consumer rebates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.gshp.org.uk/RHI_Domestic.html|title = Renewable Heat Incentive – Domestic RHI – paid over 7 years |website = Ground Source Heat Pump Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HVAC===
In [[HVAC]] applications, a heat pump is typically a [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] device that includes a reversing valve and optimized heat exchangers so that the direction of ''heat flow'' (thermal energy movement) may be reversed. The reversing valve switches the direction of refrigerant through the cycle and therefore the heat pump may deliver either heating or cooling to a building. In cooler climates, the default setting of the reversing valve is heating.

The default setting in warmer climates is cooling. Because the two heat exchangers, the condenser and evaporator, must swap functions, they are optimized to perform adequately in both modes. Therefore, the SEER rating, which is the Seasonal Energy [[SEER|Efficiency]] Rating, of a reversible heat pump is typically slightly less than two separately optimized machines. For equipment to receive the Energy Star Rating, it must have a rating of at least 14.5 SEER.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rfohl.com/heating-cooling-mechanics-terminology/|title=Heating And Cooling Mechanics and Terminology - R.F. Ohl|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water heating===
In [[water heating]] applications, a heat pump may be used to heat or preheat water for swimming pools or heating potable water for use by homes and industry. Usually heat is extracted from outdoor air and transferred to an indoor water tank, another variety extracts heat from indoor air to assist in cooling the space.

===District heating===
[[File:Generations of district heating systems EN.svg|thumb|Heat pumps can be integrated in district heating systems, especially if these are operated with low temperatures.]]
Heat pumps can also be used as heat supplier for [[district heating]]. Possible heat sources for such applications are [[sewage]] water, ambient water (like sea, lake and river water), industrial [[waste heat]], [[geothermal energy]], [[flue gas]], waste heat from [[district cooling]] and heat from [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|solar heat storage]]. In Europe, more than 1500 MW were installed since the 1980s, of which about 1000 MW were in use in Sweden in 2017.&lt;ref name="David"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=David |first1=Andrei et al |last2= |first2= |date=2017 |title=Heat Roadmap Europe: Large-Scale Electric Heat Pumps in District Heating Systems |url= |journal=[[Energies]] |volume=10 |issue= 4|pages=578 |doi=10.3390/en10040578 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large scale heat pumps for district heating combined with thermal energy storage offer high flexibility for the integration of variable renewable energy. Therefore they are regarded as a key technology for smart energy systems with high shares of [[renewable energy]] up to 100 % and advanced 4th generation district heating systems.&lt;ref name="David" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=[[Henrik Lund (academic)|Lund]] |first1=Henrik et al. |last2= |first2= |date=2014 |title=4th Generation District Heating (4GDH): Integrating smart thermal grids into future sustainable energy systems |url= http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/4th-generation-district-heating-4gdh(61c90957-a9e5-4725-b145-6d481776f827).html|journal=[[Energy (journal)|Energy]] |volume=68 |issue= |pages=1–11 |doi=10.1016/j.energy.2014.02.089 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sayegh |first1=M.A. et al. |last2= |first2= |date=2018 |title=Heat pump placement, connection and operational modes in European district heating |url= |journal=Energy and Buildings |volume=166 |issue= |pages=122–144 |doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.02.006 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example for such an usage is the [[Drammen Heat Pump]] commissioned in 2011. This heat pump uses heat from a fjord whose temperature is around 8&amp;nbsp;°C using 3 systems giving a combined capacity of 14 megawatts to town center residences and businesses. A city ordinance mandates this heating system for many new buildings.

===Industrial heating===
There is a great potential to reduce the energy consumption and related greenhouse gas emissions in the industry by application of industrial heat pumps. An international collaboration project completed in 2015 collected totally 39 examples of R&amp;D-projects and 115 case studies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;https://heatpumpingtechnologies.org/annex35/ IEA HPT TCP Annex 35&lt;/ref&gt; The study shows that short payback periods are possible (less than 2 years), high reduction of CO2-emissionen can be achieved (in some cases more than 50 %).&lt;ref&gt;https://heatpumpingtechnologies.org/publications/?search=Annex+35 IEA HPT TCP Annex 35 Publications&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://heatpumpingtechnologies.org/publications/application-of-industrial-heat-pumps-annex-35-two-page-summary/ IEA HPT TCP Annex 25 Summary &lt;/ref&gt;

==Refrigerants==
Until the 1990s, the [[refrigerant]]s were often [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s such as R-12 ([[dichlorodifluoromethane]]), one in a class of several refrigerants using the brand name [[Freon]], a trademark of [[DuPont]]. Its manufacture is now banned or severely restricted by the [[Montreal Protocol]] of August 1987 because of the [[ozone depletion|damage]] that [[CFCs]] cause to the [[ozone layer]] if released into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ozone.unep.org/Publications/MP_Handbook/Section_1.2_Control_measures/Annex_A_-_Group_I.shtml|title=Handbook for the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer - 7th Edition|year=2007|publisher=United Nations Environment Programme - Ozone Secretariat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One widely adopted replacement refrigerant is the hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) known as [[R-134a]] (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane). Heat pumps using R-134a replaced [[Dichlorodifluoromethane|R-12]] (dichlorodifluoromethane) and have similar thermodynamic properties but with insignificant [[ozone depletion potential]] and a somewhat lower [[global warming potential]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/Refrigerants-Environment-Properties-d_1220.html|title=Refrigerants - Environmental Properties|website=The Engineering ToolBox|accessdate=2016-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other substances such as liquid R-717 [[ammonia]] are widely used in large-scale systems, or occasionally the less corrosive but more flammable [[propane]] or [[butane]], can also be used.&lt;ref name="Ullmann"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ammonia, in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|publisher=Wiley-VCH|year=2006|location=Weinheim|doi=10.1002/14356007.a02_143.pub2|author=Max Appl|chapter=Ammonia|isbn=978-3527306732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2001, [[carbon dioxide]], [[R-744]], has increasingly been used, utilizing the [[transcritical cycle]], although it requires much higher working pressures. In residential and commercial applications, the hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) R-22 is still widely used, however, HFC [[R-410A]] does not deplete the ozone layer and is being used more frequently; however, it is a powerful greenhouse gas which contributes to climate change.&lt;ref name=R-410A&gt;[[R-410A#Environmental effects]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ecometrica.com|title=Calculation of green house gas potential of R-410A|url=http://ecometrica.com/article/calculating-the-global-warming-potential-of-refrigerant-gas-mixes|accessdate=2015-07-13|ref=Calculation of green house gas potential of R-410A}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, or plain air is used in the [[Stirling engine#Stirling cryocoolers|Stirling cycle]], providing the maximum number of options in environmentally friendly gases.

More recent refrigerators use [[R600A]] which is [[isobutane]], and does not deplete the ozone and is less harmful to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LpStalb-tF4C&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=R600A+isobutane+ozone+environment#v=onepage&amp;q=R600A%20isobutane%20ozone%20environment&amp;f=false|title=Green Electricity and Global Warming|last=Itteilag|first=Richard L.|date=2012-08-09|publisher=AuthorHouse|year=|isbn=9781477217405|location=|pages=77|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dimethyl ether]] (DME) has also gained in popularity as a refrigerant.&lt;ref name="mecanica-dme"&gt;[http://www.e-bookspdf.org/view/aHR0cDovL25yZWMubW4vZGF0YS91cGxvYWRzL05vbSUyMHNldGd1dWwlMjB4aWNoZWVsL092ZXJ2aWV3L0dsb2JhbCUyMHdhcm1pbmcucGRm/UjQwNGEgJiBEbWUgLSDQodGN0YDQs9GN0Y3Qs9C00Y3RhSDQrdGA0YfQuNC8INCl0q/Rh9C90LjQuQ== r404a &amp; dme eco-refrigerant blend as a new solution to limit the global warming effect] [https://web.archive.org/web/20120314211640/http://www.mecanica.pub.ro/frigo-eco/R404A_DME.pdf archive 2012.03.14]&lt;/ref&gt;

As quite similar criteria shall be fulfilled by [[working fluids]] applied to heat pumps, refrigeration and ORC cycles, several working fluids are applied by all these technologies and can be sorted into the same thermodynamic classification category based on the shape of their saturation curve.

==Noise==
A ground source heat pump has no need for an outdoor unit with moving mechanical components: no external noise is produced.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

An air source heat pump requires an outdoor unit containing moving mechanical components including fans which produce noise. In 2013, the [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] started work on standards for protection from noise pollution caused by heat pump outdoor units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://standards.cen.eu/BP/6095.pdf|title=HEAT PUMPS AND AIR CONDITIONING UNITS, Social Factors, CEN/TC 113 Business Plan, p. 2|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the CEN/TC 113 Business Plan outset was that "consumers increasingly require a low acoustic power of these units as the users and their neighbours now reject noisy installations", no standards for noise barriers or other means of noise protection had been developed by January 2016.

In the United States, the allowed nighttime noise level was defined in 1974 as "an average 24-hr exposure limit of 55 [[A-weighting|A-weighted decibels (dBA)]] to protect the public from all adverse effects on health and welfare in residential areas (U.S. EPA 1974). This limit is a day–night 24-hr average noise level (LDN), with a 10-dBA penalty applied to nighttime levels between 2200 and 0700 hours to account for sleep disruption and no penalty applied to daytime levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1307272/|title=Monica S. Hammer, Tracy K. Swinburn, and Richard L. Neitzel "Environmental Noise Pollution in the United States: Developing an Effective Public Health Response" Environmental Health Perspectives V122,I2,2014|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 10-dB(A) penalty makes the permitted U.S. nighttime noise level equal to 45 dB(A), which is more than is accepted in some European countries but less than the noise produced by some heat pumps.

Another feature of [[Air source heat pumps|ASHP]] external heat exchangers is their need to stop the fan from time to time for a period of several minutes in order to get rid of frost&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hannabery.com/faq8.shtml|title= Hannabery HVAC "Commonly Reported HVAC Problems: Outdoor unit makes strange or loud noises"|accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that accumulates in the outdoor unit in the heating mode. After that, the heat pump starts to work again. This part of the work cycle results in two sudden changes of the noise made by the fan. The acoustic effect of such disruption on neighbors is especially powerful in quiet environments where background nighttime noise may be as low as 0 to 10dBA. This is included in legislation in France. According to the French concept of noise nuisance, "noise emergence" is the difference between ambient noise including the disturbing noise, and ambient noise without the disturbing noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiil.org/bestpractices/How%20to%20determine%20acceptable%20levels%20of%20noise%20nuisance%20%28France%29|title=Hiil innovating Justice "How to determine acceptable levels of noise nuisance (France)|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006072665&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000006910540&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=cid |title=Code de la santé publique - Article R1334-33 (in French)|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance considerations==
When comparing the performance of heat pumps, it is best to avoid the word "efficiency", which has a very specific thermodynamic definition. The term [[coefficient of performance]] (COP) is used to describe the ratio of useful heat movement per work input. Most vapor-compression heat pumps use electrically powered motors for their work input.

According to the US [[EPA]], geothermal heat pumps can reduce energy consumption up to 44% compared with air-source heat pumps and up to 72% compared with electric resistance heating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/choosing-and-installing-geothermal-heat-pumps|title=Choosing and Installing Geothermal Heat Pumps|website=Energy.gov|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The COP for heat pumps range from 3.2 to 4.5 for air source heat pumps to 4.2 to 5.2 for ground source heat pumps.&lt;ref name="Lowe2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=David|last2=Madani|first2=Hatef|title=On heat pumps in smart grids: A review|journal=[[Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews]]|volume=70|issue=2|year=2017|pages=342–357|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2016.11.182|url=https://zenodo.org/record/895978/files/article.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When used for heating a building with an outside temperature of, for example, 10&amp;nbsp;°C, a typical [[air-source heat pump]] (ASHP) has a COP of 3 to 4, whereas an electrical resistance [[heater]] has a COP of 1.0. That is, one [[joule]] of electrical energy will cause a resistance heater to produce only one joule of useful heat, while under ideal conditions, one joule of electrical energy can cause a heat pump to move three or four joules of heat from a cooler place to a warmer place. Note that an air source heat pump is more efficient in hotter climates than cooler ones, so when the weather is much warmer the unit will perform with a higher COP (as it has a smaller temperature gap to bridge).  When there is a wide temperature differential between the hot and cold reservoirs, the COP is lower (worse). In extreme cold weather the COP will go down to 1.0.

On the other hand, well designed [[ground-source heat pump]] (GSHP) systems benefit from the moderate temperature underground, as the ground acts naturally as a store of thermal energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icax.co.uk/ThermalBanks.html Thermal Banks store heat between seasons | Seasonal Heat Storage | Rechargeable Heat Battery | Thermogeology | UTES | Solar recharge of heat batteries]&lt;/ref&gt; Their year-round COP is therefore normally in the range of 3.2 to 5.0.

When there is a high temperature differential (e.g., when an air-source heat pump is used to heat a house with an outside temperature of, say, 0&amp;nbsp;°C (32&amp;nbsp;°F)), it takes more work to move the same amount of heat to indoors than on a milder day. Ultimately, due to [[Carnot cycle|Carnot efficiency]] limits, the heat pump's performance will decrease as the outdoor-to-indoor temperature difference increases (outside temperature gets colder), reaching a theoretical limit of 1.0 at −273&amp;nbsp;°C. In practice, a COP of 1.0 will typically be reached at an outdoor temperature around −18&amp;nbsp;°C (0&amp;nbsp;°F) for air source heat pumps.

Also, as the heat pump takes heat out of the air, some moisture in the outdoor air may condense and possibly freeze on the outdoor heat exchanger. The system must periodically melt this ice; this defrosting translates into an additional energy (electricity) expenditure. When it is extremely cold outside, it is simpler to heat using an alternative heat source (such as an electric resistance heater, oil furnace, or gas furnace) rather than to run an air-source heat pump. Also, avoiding the use of the heat pump during extremely cold weather translates into less wear on the machine's compressor.

The design of the evaporator and condenser heat exchangers is also very important to the overall efficiency of the heat pump. The heat exchange surface areas and the corresponding temperature differential (between the refrigerant and the air stream) directly affect the operating pressures and hence the work the compressor has to do in order to provide the same heating or cooling effect. Generally, the larger the heat exchanger, the lower the temperature differential and the more efficient the system becomes.

Heat exchangers are expensive, requiring drilling for some heat-pump types or large spaces to be efficient, and the heat pump industry generally competes on price rather than efficiency. Heat pumps are already at a price disadvantage when it comes to initial investment (not long-term savings) compared to conventional heating solutions like boilers, so the drive towards more efficient heat pumps and air conditioners is often led by legislative measures on minimum efficiency standards. Electricity rates will also influence the attractiveness of heat pumps.&lt;ref&gt;[[BSRIA]], "European energy legislation explained", www.bsria.co.uk, May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In cooling mode, a heat pump's operating performance is described in the US as its [[energy efficiency ratio]] (EER) or [[seasonal energy efficiency ratio]] (SEER), and both measures have units of BTU/(h·W) (1 BTU/(h·W)&amp;nbsp;= 0.293 W/W). A larger EER number indicates better performance. The manufacturer's literature should provide both a COP to describe performance in heating mode, and an EER or SEER to describe performance in cooling mode. Actual performance varies, however, and depends on many factors such as installation details, temperature differences, site elevation, and maintenance.

As with any piece of equipment that depends on coils to transfer heat between air and a fluid, it is important for both the condenser and evaporator coils to be kept clean. If deposits of dust and other debris are allowed to accumulate on the coils, the efficiency of the unit (both in heating and cooling modes) will suffer.

Heat pumps are more ''effective'' for heating than for cooling an interior space if the temperature differential is held equal. This is because the compressor's input energy is also converted to useful heat when in heating mode, and is discharged along with the transported heat via the condenser to the interior space. But for cooling, the condenser is normally outdoors, and the compressor's dissipated work (waste heat) must also be transported to outdoors using more input energy, rather than being put to a useful purpose. For the same reason, opening a food refrigerator or freezer has the net effect of heating up the room rather than cooling it, because its refrigeration cycle rejects heat to the indoor air. This heat includes the compressor's dissipated work as well as the heat removed from the inside of the appliance.

The COP for a heat pump in a heating or cooling application, with steady-state operation, is:
:&lt;math&gt;
COP_\text{heating} = \frac{\Delta Q_\text{hot}}{\Delta A} \leq \frac{T_\text{hot}}{T_\text{hot}-T_\text{cool}},
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
COP_\text{cooling} = \frac{\Delta Q_\text{cool}}{\Delta A} \leq \frac{T_\text{cool}}{T_\text{hot}-T_\text{cool}},
&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;\Delta Q_\text{cool}&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of heat extracted from a cold reservoir at temperature &lt;math&gt;T_\text{cool}&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;\Delta Q_\text{hot}&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of heat delivered to a hot reservoir at temperature &lt;math&gt;T_\text{hot}&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;\Delta A&lt;/math&gt; is the compressor's dissipated work.
* All temperatures are absolute temperatures usually measured in [[kelvin]]s or degrees [[Rankine scale|Rankine]].

=== Coefficient of performance and lift ===
The coefficient of performance (COP) increases as the temperature difference, or "lift", decreases between heat source and destination. The COP can be maximized at design time by choosing a heating system requiring only a low final water temperature (e.g. underfloor heating), and by choosing a heat source with a high average temperature (e.g. the ground). Domestic hot water (DHW) and conventional heating radiators require high water temperatures, reducing the COP that can be attained, and affecting the choice of heat pump technology.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

One observation is that while current "best practice" heat pumps (ground source system, operating between 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 35&amp;nbsp;°C) have a typical COP around 4, no better than 5, the maximum achievable is 8.8 because of fundamental [[Carnot cycle]] limits. This means that in the coming decades, the energy efficiency of top-end heat pumps could roughly double. Cranking up efficiency requires the development of a better [[gas compressor]], fitting HVAC machines with larger heat exchangers with slower gas flows, and solving internal [[lubrication]] problems resulting from slower gas flow.

Depending on the working fluid, the expansion stage can be important also. Work done by the expanding fluid cools it and is available to replace some of the input power.  (An evaporating liquid is cooled by free expansion through a small hole, but an ideal gas is not.)

==Types==

The two main types of heat pumps are [[Gas compression|compression]] and absorption. Compression heat pumps operate on mechanical energy (typically driven by electricity), while absorption heat pumps may also run on heat as an energy source (from electricity or burnable fuels).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.vlaanderen.be/economie/energiesparen/doc/brochure_warmtepomp.pdf Warmtepompen voor woningverwarming brochure] 9-10-2013&lt;/ref&gt; An absorption heat pump may be fueled by [[natural gas]] or [[LP gas]], for example. While the gas utilization efficiency in such a device, which is the ratio of the energy supplied to the energy consumed, may average only 1.5, that is better than a natural gas or LP gas furnace, which can only approach 1.

==Heat sources and sinks==
By definition, all heat sources for a heat pump must be colder in temperature than the space to be heated. Most commonly, heat pumps draw heat from the air (outside or inside air) or from the ground ([[groundwater]] or [[soil]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.vlaanderen.be/economie/energiesparen/doc/folder_warmtepomp.pdf |title=Heat pumps sources including groundwater, soil, outside and inside air) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007174118/http://www2.vlaanderen.be/economie/energiesparen/doc/folder_warmtepomp.pdf |archivedate=2009-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heat drawn from ground-sourced systems is in most cases stored solar heat, and it should not be confused with direct [[geothermal heating]], though the latter will contribute in some small measure to all heat in the ground. True geothermal heat, when used for heating, requires a circulation pump but no heat pump, since for this technology the ground temperature is higher than that of the space that is to be heated, so the technology relies only upon simple [[heat convection]].

Other heat sources for heat pumps include water; nearby streams and other natural water bodies have been used, and sometimes domestic waste water (via [[drain water heat recovery]]) which is often warmer than cold winter ambient temperatures (though still of lower temperature than the space to be heated).

A number of sources have been used for the heat source for heating private and communal buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/pdfs/26161b.pdf|title=Homeowners using heat pump systems|publisher=[[United States Department of Energy]]|date=September 1998|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080131222926/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/pdfs/26161b.pdf|archivedate=January 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air source heat pump===
{{Main|Air source heat pumps}}
* Air source heat pump (extracts heat from outside air)
** Air–air heat pump (transfers heat to inside air)
** Air–water heat pump (transfers heat to a heating circuit and a tank of domestic hot water)

Air-air heat pumps, that extract heat from outside air and transfer this heat to inside air, are the most common type of heat pumps and the cheapest. These are similar to [[air conditioner]]s operating in reverse. Air-water heat pumps are otherwise similar to air-air heat pumps, but they transfer the extracted heat into a water heating circuit, [[floor heating]] being the most efficient, and they can also transfer heat into a domestic hot water tank for use in showers and hot water taps of the building. However, ground-water heat pumps are more efficient than air-water heat pumps, and therefore they are often the better choice for providing heat for the floor heating and domestic hot water systems.

Air source heat pumps are relatively easy and inexpensive to install and have therefore historically been the most widely used heat pump type. However, they suffer limitations due to their use of the outside air as a heat source. The higher temperature differential during periods of extreme cold leads to declining efficiency. In mild weather, [[Coefficient of performance|COP]] may be around 4.0, while at temperatures below around 0&amp;nbsp;°C (32&amp;nbsp;°F) an air-source heat pump may still achieve a COP of 2.5. The average COP over seasonal variation is typically 2.5-2.8, with exceptional models able to exceed this in mild climates.

The heating output of low temperature optimized heat pumps (and hence their energy efficiency) still declines dramatically as the temperature drops, but the threshold at which the decline starts is lower than conventional pumps, as shown in the following table (temperatures are approximate and may vary by manufacturer and model):

===Ground-source heat pump===
{{Main|Ground-source heat pump}}
* Ground source heat pump (extracts heat from the ground or similar sources)
** Ground–air heat pump (transfers heat to inside air)
*** Soil–air heat pump (soil as a source of heat)
*** Rock–air heat pump (rock as a source of heat)
*** Water–air heat pump (body of water as a source of heat, can be [[groundwater]], [[lake]], [[river]] etc.)
** Ground–water heat pump (transfers heat to a heating circuit and a tank of domestic hot water)
*** Soil–water heat pump (ground as a source of heat)
*** Rock–water heat pump (rock as a source of heat)
*** Water–water heat pump (body of water as a source of heat)

Ground-source heat pumps, also called geothermal heat pumps, typically have higher efficiencies than air-source heat pumps.  This is because they draw heat from the ground or [[groundwater]] which is at a relatively constant temperature all year round below a depth of about 30 feet (9 m).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130530033808/http://www.geo4va.vt.edu/A1/A1.htm Earth Temperature and Site Geology]&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the temperature differential is lower, leading to higher efficiency.  Well maintained ground-source heat pumps typically have COPs of 4.0&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydro.mb.ca/regulatory_affairs/electric/gra_2012_2013/Appendix_38.pdf Performance of Ground Source Heat Pumps in Manitoba] Rob Andrushuk, Phil Merkel, June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; at the beginning of the heating season, with lower seasonal COPs of around 3.0 as heat is drawn from the ground. The tradeoff for this improved performance is that a ground-source heat pump is more expensive to install, due to the need for the drilling of boreholes for vertical placement of heat exchanger piping or the digging of trenches for horizontal placement of the piping that carries the heat exchange fluid (water with a little antifreeze).

When compared, groundwater heat pumps are generally more efficient than heat pumps using heat from the soil. Closed loop soil or ground heat exchangers tend to accumulate cold if the ground loop is undersized. This can be a significant problem if nearby ground water is stagnant or the soil lacks thermal conductivity, and the overall system has been designed to be just big enough to handle a "typical worst case" cold spell, or is simply undersized for the load.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516220648/http://geothermalhelp.com/sizing-a-geothermal-heating-system/ Geothermalhelp.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; One way to fix cold accumulation in the ground heat exchanger loop is to use ground water to cool the floors of the building on hot days, thereby transferring heat from the dwelling into the ground loop. There are several other methods for replenishing a low temperature ground loop; one way is to make large solar collectors, for instance by putting plastic pipes just under the roof, or by putting coils of black polyethylene pipes under glass on the roof, or by piping the tarmac of the parking lot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icax.co.uk/asphalt_solar_collector.html Asphalt Solar Collector Renewable Heat for IHT | Solar Collectors | Solar Recharge for GSHP | Pavement Solar Collectors | Road Solar Thermal Collector&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A further solution is to ensure ground collector arrays are correctly sized, by ensuring [[soil thermal properties]] and thermal conductivity are correctly measured and integrated into the design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carbonzeroco.com/field-services/soil-thermal-conductivity-testing/ Soil Thermal Conductivity Surveys]&lt;/ref&gt;

** Single-pass — water source is a body of water or a stream, and utilized water is rejected at a different temperature without further use
** Recirculation
*** When cooling, closed-loop heat transfer medium to central [[cooling tower]] or [[chiller]] (typically in a building or industrial setting)
*** When heating, closed-loop heat transfer medium from central boilers generating heat from combustion or other sources

===Hybrid heat pump===
Hybrid (or twin source) heat pumps: when outdoor air is above 4 to 8 Celsius, (40-50 Fahrenheit, depending on ground water temperature) they use air; when air is colder, they use the ground source. These twin source systems can also store summer heat, by running ground source water through the air exchanger or through the building heater-exchanger, even when the heat pump itself is not running. This has dual advantage: it functions as a low running cost for air cooling, and (if ground water is relatively stagnant) it cranks up the temperature of the ground source, which improves the energy efficiency of the heat pump system by roughly 4% for each degree in temperature rise of the ground source.

===Air/water-brine/water heat pump (hybrid heat pump)===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}
The air/water-brine/water heat pump is a hybrid heat pump, developed in Rostock, Germany, that uses only renewable energy sources.  Unlike other hybrid systems, which usually combine both conventional and renewable energy sources, it combines air and geothermal heat in one compact device. The air/water-brine/water heat pump has two evaporators — an outside air evaporator and a brine evaporator — both connected to the heat pump cycle. This allows use of the most economical heating source for the current external conditions (for example, air temperature).  The unit automatically selects the most efficient operating mode — air or geothermal heat, or both together.  The process is controlled by a control unit, which processes the large amounts of data delivered by the complex heating system.

The control unit comprises two controllers, one for the air heat cycle and one for the geothermal circulation, in one device.  All components communicate over a common bus to ensure they interact to enhance the efficiency of the hybrid heating system.  The German Patent and Trade Mark Office in Munich granted the air/water-brine/water heat pump a patent in 2008, under the title “Heat pump and method for controlling the source inlet temperature to the heat pump”. This hybrid heat pump can be combined with a solar thermal system or with an ice-storage.  It trades and is marketed under the name ''ThermSelect''.  In the United Kingdom, ''ThermSelect'' won the 2013 Commercial Heating Product of the Year award of the HVR Awards for Excellence, organised by ''Heating and Ventilating Review'', an industry magazine.

=== Solar-assisted heat pump ===
{{see also|Solar-assisted heat pump}}
A solar-assisted heat pump is a machine that represents the integration of a heat pump and [[Solar thermal collector|thermal solar panels]] in a single integrated system. Typically these two technologies are used separately (or only placing them in parallel) to produce [[Water heating|hot water]].&lt;ref name = ref1&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bine.info/en/publications/themeninfos/publikation/elektrisch-angetriebene-waermepumpen/waermepumpen-plus-solar/ | title = Solar-assisted heat pumps | language = en | access-date = 21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this system the solar thermal panel performs the function of the low temperature heat source and the heat produced is used to feed the heat pump's evaporator.&lt;ref name = ref2&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.climatizzazioneconfontirinnovabili.enea.it/index.php/pompe-di-calore-elioassistite | title = Pompe di calore elio-assistite | language = it | access-date = 21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of this system is to get high [[Coefficient of performance|COP]] and then produce energy in a more [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficient]] and less expensive way.

==Solid state heat pumps==

===Magnetic===
{{Main|Magnetic refrigeration}}
In 1881, the German physicist [[Emil Warburg]] put a block of iron into a strong magnetic field and found that it increased very slightly in temperature. Some commercial ventures to implement this technology are underway, claiming to cut energy consumption by 40% compared to current domestic refrigerators&lt;!-- The article referenced is unclear what the reference "standard fridge" is --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Guardian Unlimited, December 2006 [http://environment.guardian.co.uk/energy/story/0,,1971818,00.html 'A cool new idea from British scientists: the magnetic fridge']&lt;/ref&gt; The process works as follows: Powdered [[gadolinium]] is moved into a magnetic field, heating the material by 2 to 5&amp;nbsp;°C (4 to 9&amp;nbsp;°F). The heat is removed by a circulating fluid. The material is then moved out of the magnetic field, reducing its temperature below its starting temperature.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Thermoelectric===
{{Main|Thermoelectric cooling|Thermoelectric materials}}
Solid state heat pumps using the [[thermoelectric effect]] have improved over time to the point where they are useful for certain refrigeration tasks.  Thermoelectric (Peltier) heat pumps are generally only around 10-15% as efficient as the ideal [[refrigerator]] ([[Carnot cycle]]), compared with 40–60% achieved by conventional compression cycle systems (reverse [[Rankine cycle|Rankine]] systems using compression/expansion);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/pnnl-19259.pdf - The Prospects of Alternatives to Vapor Compression Technology for Space Cooling and Food Refrigeration Applications] DR Brown, N Fernandez, JA Dirks, TB Stout. [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]] March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; however, this area of technology is currently the subject of active research in materials science.
A reason why this is popular is because it has a "long lifetime" as there are no moving parts and it does not use potentially hazardous refrigerants.

===Thermoacoustic===
{{Main|Thermoacoustic hot air engine}}
Near-solid-state heat pumps using [[thermoacoustics]] are commonly used in cryogenic laboratories.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

'''James Arthur Dean Wallace Anderson''' Known as '''James Anderson''' is an [[academic staff]] member in the School of Systems Engineering at the [[University of Reading]], England. He is currently teaching [[compilers]], [[algorithms]], and [[computer algebra]], and in the past he has taught [[Computer programming|programming]] and [[computer graphics]].&lt;ref name="reading"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson quickly gained publicity in December 2006 in the United Kingdom when the regional [[BBC South Today]] reported his claim of "having solved a 1200 year old problem", namely that of [[division by zero]]. However, commentators quickly responded that his ideas are just a variation of the standard [[IEEE 754]] concept of [[NaN]] (Not a Number), which has been commonly employed on [[computer]]s in [[floating point]] [[arithmetic]] for many years.&lt;ref name="Good Math, Bad Math"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2006/12/nullity_the_nonsense_number_1.php|title=Nullity: The Nonsense Number|work=Good Math, Bad Math|date=7 December 2006|author=Mark C. Chu-Carroll|accessdate=7 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Anderson defended against the criticism of his claims on BBC Berkshire on 12 December 2006, saying, "If anyone doubts me I can hit them over the head with a computer that does it."&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2006/12/12/nullity_061212_feature.shtml|title='Nullity is a number, and that makes a difference'|accessdate=12 December 2006|date=12 December 2006|work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and background==
Anderson is a member of the [[British Computer Society]], the British Machine Vision Association, [[Eurographics]], and the British Society for the Philosophy of Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a teacher in the Computer Science department (School of Systems Engineering) at the [[University of Reading]].&lt;ref name="reading" /&gt;  He was
a psychology graduate who worked in the Electrical and Electronic Engineering departments at the [[University of Sussex]] and Plymouth Polytechnic (now the [[University of Plymouth]]). His doctorate is from the University of Reading for (in Anderson's words) "developing a canonical description of the perspective transformations in whole numbered dimensions".

He has written two papers on [[division by zero]]&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2006/12/06/divide_zero_feature.shtml|title=1200-year-old problem "easy"|date=7 December 2006|author=Ben Moore|author2=Ollie Williams|work=[[BBC News]]|quote=Schoolchildren from Caversham have become the first to learn a brand new theory that dividing by zero is possible using a new number—"nullity".

Anderson claims that "mathematical arithmetic is sociologically invalid" and that [[IEEE floating point standard|IEEE floating-point arithmetic]], with NaN, is also faulty.&lt;ref name ="investor presentation"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.angletechnology.com/events/investorday/Dr%20James%20Anderson%20Transreal%20presentation.pdf|title=Transreal Computing Research and Portfolio — Company Showcase|author=Dr James A.D.W.

Anderson's transreal numbers were first mentioned in a 1997 publication,&lt;ref name=Pub1&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997RSPTB.352.1129A|title=Representing Geometrical Knowledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made well-known on the [[Internet]] in 2006, but not accepted as useful by the mathematics community. These numbers are used in his concept of '''transreal arithmetic''' and the Perspex machine.  According to Anderson, transreal numbers include all of the [[real number]]s, plus three others: [[infinity]] (&lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;), negative infinity (&lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;) and "nullity" (&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;), a numerical representation of a non-number that lies outside of the [[affinely extended real number line]].  ([[Null space|Nullity]], confusingly, has an existing mathematical meaning.)

Anderson intends the [[axiom]]s of transreal arithmetic to complement the axioms of standard arithmetic; they are supposed to produce the same result as standard arithmetic for all calculations where standard arithmetic defines a result. In addition, they are intended to define a consistent numeric result for the calculations which are undefined in standard arithmetic, such as [[division by zero]].&lt;ref name="perplex8"&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.bookofparagon.com/Mathematics/PerspexMachineVIII.pdf|format=PDF|title=Perspex Machine VIII: Axioms of Transreal Arithmetic|author=J A D W Anderson|year=2006|booktitle=Vision Geometry XV: Proceedings of SPIE|volume=6499|editor=[[Longin Jan Latecki]] |editor2=David M. Mount |editor2-link=David Mount|editor3=Angela Y. Wu|editor3-link=Angela Y. Wu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transreal arithmetic and other arithmetics===
"Transreal arithmetic" closely resembles IEEE floating point arithmetic, a [[floating point]] arithmetic commonly used on [[computer]]s. IEEE floating point arithmetic, like transreal arithmetic, uses affine infinity (two separate infinities, one positive and one negative) rather than [[projectively extended real numbers|projective infinity]] (a single unsigned infinity, turning the number line into a loop).

The main difference is that IEEE arithmetic replaces the real (and transreal) number [[zero]] with positive and [[negative zero]]. (This is so that it can preserve the sign of a nonzero [[real number]] whose [[absolute value]] has been rounded down to zero. See also [[infinitesimal]].) Division of any non-zero finite number by zero results in either positive or negative infinity.

However, in IEEE arithmetic, division of zero by zero is still considered [[indeterminate form|indeterminate]]. The reason for this is simple: A statement about the quotient of two numbers is understood in mathematics as another statement about multiplication.  Specifically, if

&lt;math&gt;a \div b = c&lt;/math&gt;

this is understood as simply another way of saying that

&lt;math&gt;a = b \times c&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, if for some number &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;0 \div 0 = c&lt;/math&gt;

then this is just another way of saying that

&lt;math&gt;0 = 0 \times c&lt;/math&gt;

But in fact this is true for '''all''' real numbers &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.  And that is precisely the reason that mathematicians do not assign a single value to &lt;math&gt;0 \div 0&lt;/math&gt; but rather label it "indeterminate".  Assigning a value to &lt;math&gt;0 \div 0&lt;/math&gt;, even a newly fabricated "number", misses the point entirely.

In IEEE arithmetic, the value of &lt;math&gt;0 \div 0&lt;/math&gt; is therefore represented by the symbol [[NaN|Not a Number (NaN)]] (Not a Number). NaN is '''not''' meant to be a number, but rather an error message conveying the fact that the arithmetical operation the computer just attempted cannot be assigned a single number as an answer – even if &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; are considered numbers. Because &lt;math&gt;NaN&lt;/math&gt; is an error message and not a number, it is not considered equal to anything, even itself. That is, the comparison &lt;math&gt;NaN = NaN&lt;/math&gt; evaluates to false.

Here are some [[identity (mathematics)|identities]] in transreal arithmetic with the IEEE equivalents:
{| class="wikitable" border="3"
! Transreal arithmetic !! IEEE standard floating point arithmetic
|-
| &lt;math&gt;0 \div 0 = \Phi&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;0 \div 0 = NaN&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\infty \times 0 = \Phi&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\infty \times 0 = NaN&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\infty - \infty = \Phi&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\infty - \infty = NaN&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\Phi + a = \Phi \ &lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;NaN + a = NaN&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\Phi \times a = \Phi&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;NaN \times a = NaN&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;-\Phi = \Phi \ &lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;-NaN = NaN&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. applying unary negation to NaN yields NaN)
|-
| &lt;math&gt;+1 \div 0 = +\infty&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;1 \div +0 = -1 \div -0 = +\infty&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;-1 \div 0 = -\infty&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;1 \div -0 = -1 \div +0 = -\infty&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\Phi = \Phi \Rightarrow True \ &lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;NaN = NaN \Rightarrow False &lt;/math&gt;
|}

The main difference between transreal arithmetic and IEEE floating-point arithmetic is thus that nullity compares equal to nullity, whereas NaN does not compare equal to NaN.

Anderson's analysis of the properties of transreal algebra is given in his paper on "perspex machines".&lt;ref name="perplex9"&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.bookofparagon.com/Mathematics/PerspexMachineIX.pdf|format=PDF|title=Perspex Machine IX: Transreal Analysis|author=J A D W Anderson|year=2006|booktitle=Vision Geometry XV: Proceedings of SPIE|volume=6499|editor=[[Longin Jan Latecki]] |editor2=David M. Mount |editor3=Angela Y. Wu.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the more expansive definition of numbers in transreal arithmetic, several identities and theorems which apply to all numbers in standard arithmetic are not universal in transreal arithmetic. For instance, in transreal arithmetic, &lt;math&gt;a-a=0&lt;/math&gt; is not true for all &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;\Phi-\Phi=\Phi&lt;/math&gt;. That problem is addressed in ref.&lt;ref name="perplex9"/&gt; pg. 7. Similarly, it is not always the case in transreal arithmetic that a number can be cancelled with its [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] to yield &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. Cancelling zero with its reciprocal in fact yields nullity.

Examining the [[axiom]]s provided by Anderson,&lt;ref name="perplex8"/&gt; it is easy to see that any term which contains an occurrence of the constant &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is provably equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;. Formally, let &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; be any term with a sub-term &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;, then
&lt;math&gt;t=\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is a [[theorem]] of the theory proposed by Anderson.

==Media coverage==
Anderson's transreal arithmetic, and concept of "nullity" in particular, were introduced to the public by the [[BBC]] with its report in December 2006&lt;ref name=BBC1 /&gt; where Anderson was featured on a BBC television segment teaching schoolchildren about his concept of "nullity". The report implied that Anderson had ''discovered'' the solution to division by zero, rather than simply attempting to formalize it. The report also suggested that Anderson was the first to solve this problem, when in fact the result of zero divided by zero has been expressed formally in a number of different ways (for example, [[NaN]]).

The BBC was criticized for irresponsible journalism, but the producers of the segment defended the BBC, stating that the report was a light-hearted look at a mathematical problem aimed at a mainstream, regional audience for [[BBC South Today]] rather than at a global audience of mathematicians. The BBC later posted a follow-up giving Anderson's response to many claims that the theory is flawed.&lt;ref name="BBC2"/&gt;

==Applications==
Anderson has been trying to market his ideas for transreal arithmetic and "Perspex machines" to investors.  He claims that his work can produce computers which run "orders of magnitude faster than today's computers".&lt;ref name ="investor presentation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="company"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.transrealcomputing.com/|title=Transreal Computing Ltd.|accessdate=12 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also claimed that it can help solve such problems as [[quantum gravity]],&lt;ref name ="investor presentation" /&gt; the [[mind-body connection]],&lt;ref name="paragon"&gt;http://www.bookofparagon.com/&lt;/ref&gt; [[consciousness]]&lt;ref name="paragon"/&gt; and [[free will]].&lt;ref name="paragon"/&gt;

'''Kansei engineering''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 感性工学 ''kansei kougaku'', emotional or affective engineering) aims at the development or improvement of products and services by translating the customer's [[Sensibility|psychological feelings and needs]] into the domain of product design (i.e. parameters). It was founded by [[Mitsuo Nagamachi]], Professor Emeritus of [[Hiroshima University]] (also former Dean of [[Hiroshima International University]] and CEO of [[International Kansei Design Institute]]).  Kansei engineering parametrically links the customer's emotional responses (i.e. physical and psychological) to the properties and characteristics of a product or service. In consequence, products can be designed to bring forward the intended feeling.

It has now been adopted as one of the topics for [[professional development]] by the [[Royal Statistical Society]].

==Introduction==
{{essay-like|date=January 2018}}
Product design on today's markets has become increasingly complex since products contain more functions and have to meet increasing demands such as user-friendliness, manufacturability and ecological considerations. With a shortened [[product lifecycle]], development costs are likely to increase. Since errors in the estimations of market trends can be very expensive, companies therefore perform benchmarking studies that compare with competitors on strategic, process, marketing, and product levels. However, success in a certain market segment not only requires knowledge about the competitors and the performance of competing products, but also about the impressions which a product leaves to the customer. The latter requirement becomes much more important as products and companies are becoming mature. Customers purchase products based on subjective terms such as [[brand image]], reputation, design, impression etc.. A large number of manufacturers has started to consider such subjective properties and develop their products in a way that conveys the company image. A reliable instrument is therefore needed: an instrument which can predict the reception of a product on the market before the development costs become too large.

This demand has triggered the research dealing with the translation of the customer's subjective, hidden needs into concrete products. Research is done foremost in Asia, including Japan and Korea. In Europe, a network has been forged under the 6th EU framework. This network refers to the new research field as "[[emotional design]]" or "affective engineering".

== History ==

Nowadays, people want to use products that are functional at the physical level, usable at the psychological level and attractive at the subjective, emotional level{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}. Affective engineering is the study of the interactions between the customer and the product at that third level. It focuses on the relationships between the physical traits of a product and its affective influence on the user. Thanks to this field of research, it is possible to gain knowledge on how to design more attractive products and make the customers satisfied.

Methods in affective engineering (or Kansei engineering) is one of the major areas of [[ergonomics]] (human factor engineering ){{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}.  The study of integrating affective values in artefacts is not new at all. Already in the 18th century philosophers such as [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] established the area of aesthetics. In addition to pure practical values, artefacts always also had an affective component. One example is jewellery found in excavations from the stone ages. The period of Renaissance is also a good example.

In the middle of the 20th century, the idea of aesthetics was deployed in scientific contexts. [[Charles E. Osgood]] developed his [[semantic differential]] method in which he quantified the peoples' perceptions of artefacts. Some years later, in 1960, Professors Shigeru Mizuno and [[Yoji Akao]] developed an engineering approach in order to connect peoples' needs to product properties. This method was called [[quality function deployment]] (QFD). Another method, the [[Kano model]], was developed in the field of quality in the early 1980s by Professor [[Noriaki Kano]], of Tokyo University. Kano's model is used to establish the importance of individual product features for the customer's satisfaction and hence it creates the optimal requirement for process oriented product development activities. A pure marketing technique is [[Conjoint analysis (marketing)|conjoint analysis]]. Conjoint analysis estimates the relative importance of a product's attributes by analysing the consumer's overall judgment of a product or service. A more artistic method is called Semantic description of environments. It is mainly a tool for examining how a single person or a group of persons experience a certain (architectural) environment.

Although all of these methods are concerned with subjective impact, none of them can translate this impact to design parameters sufficiently. This can, however, be accomplished by Kansei engineering. Kansei engineering (KE) has been used as a tool for affective engineering. It was developed in the early 70s in Japan and is now widely spread among Japanese companies. In the middle of the 90s, the method spread to the United States, but cultural differences may have prevented the method to enfold its whole potential.

==Procedure ==

As mentioned above, Kansei engineering can be considered as a methodology within the research field of 'affective engineering'. Some researchers have identified the content of the methodology. Shimizu et al. state that 'Kansei Engineering is used as a tool for product development and the basic principles behind it are the following: identification of product properties and correlation between those properties and the design characteristics'.

According to Nagasawa, one of the forerunners of Kansei engineering, there are three focal points in the method:
# How to accurately understand consumer Kansei
# How to reflect and translate Kansei understanding into product design
# How to create a system and organization for Kansei orientated design

== A model on methodology ==

In Japanese publications{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}, different types of Kansei engineering are identified and applied in various contexts. Schütte examined different types of Kansei engineering and developed a general model covering the contents of Kansei engineering.

; Choice of Domain
''Domain'' in this context describes the overall idea behind an assembly of products, i.e. the product type in general. Choosing the domain includes the definition of the intended target group and user type, market-niche and type, and the product group in question. Choosing and defining the domain are carried out on existing products, concepts and on design solutions yet unknown. From this, a domain description is formulated, serving as the basis for further evaluation. The process is necessary and has been described by Schütte in detail in a couple of publications.

; Span the Semantic Space
The expression ''Semantic Space'' was addressed for the first time by Osgood et al.. He posed that every artifact can be described in a certain vector space defined by semantic expressions (words). This is done by collecting a large number of words that describe the domain. Suitable sources are pertinent literature, commercials, manuals, specification list, experts etc. The number of the words gathered varies according to the product, typically between 100 and 1000 words. In a second step the words are grouped using manual (e.g. Affinity diagram, compare: Bergman and Klefsjö, 1994) or mathematical methods (e.g. factor and/or cluster analysis, compare: Ishihara et al., 1998). Finally a few representing words are selected from this spanning the Semantic Space. These words are called "Kansei words" or "Kansei Engineering words".

; Span the Space of Properties
The next step is to span the Space of Product Properties, which is similar to the Semantic Space. The Space of Product Properties collects products representing the domain, identifies key features and selects product properties for further evaluation.
The collection of products representing the domain is done from different sources such as existing products, customer suggestions, possible technical solutions and design concepts etc. The key features are found using specification lists for the products in question. To select properties for further evaluation, a Pareto-diagram (compare Bergman and Klefsjö, 1994) can assist the decision between important and less important features.
Synthesis
In the synthesis step, the Semantic Space and the Space of Properties are linked together, as displayed in Figure 3. Compared to other methods in Affective Engineering, Kansei engineering is the only method that can establish and quantify connections between abstract feelings and technical specifications. For every Kansei word a number of product properties are found, affecting the Kansei word.

; Synthesis
The research into constructing these links has been a core part of Nagamachi's work with Kansei engineering in the last few years. Nowadays, a number of different tools is available. Some of the most common tools are :

* Category Identification
* Regression Analysis /Quantification Theory Type I
* Rough Sets Theory
* Genetic Algorithm
* Fuzzy Sets Theory

; Model building and Test of Validity
After doing the necessary stages, the final step of validation remains. This is done in order to check if the prediction model is reliable and realistic. However, in case of prediction model failure, it is necessary to update the Space of Properties and the Semantic Space, and consequently refine the model.
The process of refinement is difficult due to the shortage of methods. This shows the need of new tools to be integrated. The existing tools can partially be found in the previously mentioned methods for the synthesis.

==Software tools==
Kansei engineering has always been a statically and mathematically advanced methodology. Most types require good expert knowledge and a reasonable amount of experience to carry out the studies sufficiently. This has also been the major obstacle for a widespread application of Kansei engineering.
In order to facilitate application some software packages have been developed in the recent years, most of them in Japan. There are two different types of software packages available: User consoles and data collection and analysis tools. User consoles are software programs that calculate and propose a product design based on the users' subjective preferences (Kanseis). However, such software requires a database that quantifies the connections between Kanseis and the combination of product attributes. For building such databases, data collection and analysis tools can be used. This part of the paper demonstrates some of the tools. There are many more tools used in companies and universities, which might not be available to the public.
User consoles

== Software ==

As described above, Kansei data collection and analysis is often complex and connected with statistical analysis. Depending on which synthesis method is used, different computer software is used. Kansei Engineering Software (KESo) uses QT1 for linear analysis. The concept of Kansei Engineering Software (KESo) Linköping University in Sweden ([http://www.kanseiengineering.net www.kanseiengineering.net]). The software generates online questionnaires for collection of Kansei raw-data

Another software package (Kn6) was developed at the [[Polytechnic University of Valencia]] in Spain.

Both software packages improve the collection and evalutation of Kansei data. In this way even users with no specialist competence in advanced statistics can use Kansei engineering.

'''Lawrence University''' is a liberal arts college and conservatory of music in [[Appleton, Wisconsin]], United States. Founded in 1847, the school held its first classes on November 12, 1849. Lawrence was the second college in the United States to be founded as a [[coeducational]] institution. 

In a study by the [[National Science Foundation]], Lawrence ranked 28th nationally in the percentage of graduates who go on to earn doctorates in science and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/infbrief/nsf13323/|title=National Science Foundation, Baccalaureate Origins of U.S.-trained S&amp;E Doctorate Recipients}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence is consistently ranked in the top tier of national liberal arts colleges by ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]''. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/lawrence-university-3856| title =Lawrence University; US News |publisher=Colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campus ==
The {{convert|84|acre|ha|0|adj=on}} campus is located in downtown Appleton, divided into two parts by the [[Fox River (Wisconsin)|Fox River]]. The academic campus is on the north shore of the river, and the major athletic facilities (including the 5000-seat Banta Bowl) are on the southeast shore. Lawrence also has a {{convert|425|acre|ha|sing=on}} northern estate called [[Björklunden]] (full name: Björklunden vid sjön), which serves as a site for retreats, seminars, concerts, and theatrical performances.  It contains a chapel for weddings.  Donald and Winifred Boynton of [[Highland Park, Illinois|Highland Park]], [[Illinois]], donated the property in [[Door County, Wisconsin|Door County]] to Lawrence in 1963.

===Campus development===
In the mid-1980s, the Physics Department built a $330,000 small laser laboratory (known as the "laser palace"), which includes 800 5&amp;nbsp;mW small lasers and more than 500 mirrors.

In 2009, Lawrence opened the Richard and Margot Warch Campus Center, a gathering place for students, faculty, staff, alumni, and guests from the Fox Cities community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawrence.edu/s/warch_campus_center/about |title=About the Campus Center |accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 107,000 square foot building is situated on the Fox River on the site of the former Hulburt House. The Warch Campus Center includes a cinema, campus dining services, campus mailboxes, and various meeting and event spaces. The building has earned a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Gold certification for meeting sustainability goals in energy conservation, environmental friendliness, and green building.

The college has a long history of razing buildings on its campus, because of the limited land available for constructing new buildings. Many buildings on campus are built on the site of former buildings. Some razed buildings include:
* Peabody Hall of Music (20th century)
* Hamar Union (1960)
* Underwood Observatory (1962)
* Alexander Gym I (1962)
* Carnegie Library (1964)
* Worcester Art Center (1987)
* Stephenson Hall of Science (1998)
* Hulbert House (2006) (new construction: Warch Campus Center, 2009)

==History==
Lawrence's first president, William Harkness Sampson, founded the school with [[Henry R. Colman]], using $10,000 provided by [[philanthropist]] [[Amos Adams Lawrence]], and matched by the [[Methodist]] church. Both founders were ordained Methodist [[minister of religion|ministers]], but Lawrence was [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]]. The school was originally named '''Lawrence Institute of Wisconsin''' in its 1847 charter from the Wisconsin Territorial Legislature, but the name was changed to Lawrence University before classes began in November 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawrence.edu/library/archives/history.shtml |title=Lawrence History &amp;#124; Lawrence University |publisher=Lawrence.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also  Charles Breunig’s book, A Great and Good Work: A History of Lawrence University, 1847-1964.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its oldest extant building, [[Main Hall (Lawrence University)|Main Hall]], was built in 1853.&lt;ref name=hcap&gt;Council of Independent Colleges, "[http://hcap.artstor.org/cgi-bin/library?a=d&amp;d=p976 Main Hall]", Historic Campus Architecture Project.&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence University was the second coeducational institution in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawrence.edu/admissions/about/president |title=President Mark Burstein |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Lawrence University |publisher=Lawrence University |access-date=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence's first period of major growth came during the tenure of [[alumnus]] [[Samuel G. Plantz]] as president. From 1894 to 1924, when Plantz presided over the school, its student body grew from 200 to 800.

From 1913 until 1964, the school was named '''Lawrence College''', to emphasize its small size and [[liberal arts]] education focus. The name was changed to Lawrence University when it merged with [[Milwaukee-Downer College]]. The state of Wisconsin then purchased the Milwaukee-Downer property and buildings to expand the campus of the [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]]. Initially, the university designated two entities: Lawrence College for Men and Downer College for Women. This separation has not lasted in any material form, though degrees are still conferred "on the recommendation of the Faculty of Lawrence and Downer Colleges" and the university by-laws still make the distinction.

During [[World War II]], Lawrence College was one of 131 colleges and universities in the nation that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]], which offered students a path to a Navy commission.&lt;ref name="lawrence-v-12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myhistorymuseum.org/WWII/1943/lawrence.htm |title=Call to Duty, Lawrence University's V-12 Program |publisher=Outagamie County Historical Society (OCHS) |last= |first= |accessdate=September 27, 2011 |year=2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208022740/http://www.myhistorymuseum.org/WWII/1943/lawrence.htm |archivedate=February 8, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lawrence Conservatory of Music, usually referred to as "the Con", was founded in 1874.  Lawrence offers two degrees: a [[Bachelor of Arts]] and a [[Bachelor of Music]]. It also offers a five-year dual degree program, where students can receive both B.A. and B.Mus. degrees. 

Freshman Studies at Lawrence is a mandatory two-term class, in which all students study the same selected 11 classic works of literature, art, and music. President [[Nathan M. Pusey]] is credited with initiating the program in 1945, although Professor Waples chaired the Freshman Studies Committee and was responsible for implementing the program. The program continues to this day, despite being temporarily suspended in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freshman Studies History|url=http://www.lawrence.edu/academics/study/freshman_studies/history|website=Lawrence University|publisher=Lawrence University|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Lawrence University initiated a capital campaign called "More Light!", which aimed at raising $150 million. By October 2011 the college had raised $160,272,839, with the conclusion event held on October 28, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.lawrence.edu/mlfinale/2011/10/photos-from-the-more-light-finale-celebration.html |title=Photos From the More Light!

Lawrence University is part of the [[Oberlin Group]], a consortium of liberal arts college libraries.

===Milwaukee-Downer traditions===
[[File:Lawrence University.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The cupola on [[Main Hall (Lawrence University)|Main Hall]] at Lawrence University is an Appleton landmark.]]
The [[traditions]] and heritage of Milwaukee-Downer are woven into the Appleton campus, from the grove of [[Crataegus|hawthorn]] trees (called Hawthornden) between Brokaw and Colman halls, to the [[sundial]] on the back of [[Main Hall (Lawrence University)|Main Hall]], to the bestowing upon each class a class color and banner.

The Lawrence Dean of Women was referred to as the "Dean of Downer", but when the offices of Dean of Men and Dean of Women were merged to form the Dean of Students, the substantive duties of the "Dean of Downer" came to an end; the title is still borne by a senior female professor, but her only duty is to carry the Downer Mace in academic processions. For many years the women's choir was called the Downer Chorus.  At one time the BA was conferred upon women in the name of "Downer College of Lawrence University" and upon men in the name of "Lawrence College of Lawrence University"; now all B.A. degrees are conferred in the name of "Lawrence &amp; Downer Colleges of Lawrence University." (The B.Mus. degree is from "the Lawrence University Conservatory of Music.)

==Academics==
[[File:muddlib.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Seeley G. Mudd Library. The library contains over 420,000 volumes.]]
Lawrence University operates on a [[Academic term|trimester]] calendar. The academic year runs from mid-September to mid-June. The student/faculty ratio at Lawrence is 9:1.&lt;ref name="lawrence1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawrence.edu/admissions/about/international/ |title=International Resources - Lawrence University |publisher=Lawrence.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511013306/http://lawrence.edu/admissions/about/international/ |archive-date=2012-05-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence grants Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Music degrees, with a [[double degree]] possible. Lawrence offers a number of cooperative degree programs in areas such as [[engineering]], [[health sciences]] and [[environmental studies]].

The college offers majors in most of the [[liberal arts]]. The school also offers the option of [[interdisciplinary]] areas of study and allows students to design their own majors.  All students are required to take Freshman Studies, which introduces students to broad areas of study and provides a common academic experience for the college. Lawrence's freshman studies program focuses on a mixture of Great Books and more contemporary, influential works. The 2013–2014 list included Plato's ''Republic'' and Alison Bechdel's ''Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic''.

The school has an independent study option that allows students to design their own courses. This allows students to explore academic interests not covered by Lawrence’s classes or to explore topics more deeply. Over 90% of the students take advantage of the independent study program.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Conservatory of Music===
The [[Lawrence University Conservatory of Music]] was founded in 1874 and has been a part of Lawrence University ever since. The Conservatory offers Bachelor of Music degrees in Performance, Theory/Composition, Music Education, and a five-year double degree option that grants both a BM degree from the Conservatory and a BA degree from the College.  Approximately 25% of the Lawrence student body, or 350 students, is in the Conservatory. The Conservatory has three choirs, two bands, two jazz ensembles, a symphony orchestra, an improvisation collective, five world music ensembles, and numerous chamber music groups.

==Student body==

At the beginning of every academic year in September, incoming freshmen arrive a week before returning students to partake in Welcome Week. During Welcome Week, various activities are planned in order to help the incoming class get to know one another and to help them acclimate to college life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome Week 2016 Schedule|url=https://www.lawrence.edu/mw/DS16-111%20WW%20Schedule-Domestic%20Students_1.pdf|website=Lawrence University|publisher=Lawrence University|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first night of Welcome Week, students and their parents attend the President's Welcome, which concludes with the traditional matriculation handshake, where every member of the incoming class shakes hands and exchanges words with the university's president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome Week 2016 Schedule|url=https://www.lawrence.edu/mw/DS16-111%20WW%20Schedule-Domestic%20Students_1.pdf|website=Lawrence University|publisher=Lawrence University|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the fall term, the on-campus fraternity [[Beta Theta Pi]] hosts the annual Beach Bash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lawrentian.com/archives/104359 |last1=Denault|first1=Ethan|title=Y’all gonna make me act a fool|website=The Lawrentian|publisher=The Lawrentian |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324213703/http://www.lawrentian.com/archives/104359 |archivedate=24 March 2016 |accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this event, the brothers of Beta Theta Pi shovel approximately 14 tons of sand into the fraternity house basement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Birch|first1=Hannah|title=Senator Tim Kaine campaigns on campus, pushes early voting|url=http://www.lawrentian.com/archives/1009298|website=The Lawrentian|publisher=The Lawrentian|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and install a boardwalk and a lifeguard station that doubles as a DJ booth.

During Spring Term, Lawrence University hosts a music festival, LU-aroo (a play on words on the popular music festival [[Bonnaroo]]). Held on the quad, the festival features many talented student bands, both from the college and the conservatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Senye|first1=Yame|title=LUAROO|url=http://blogs.lawrence.edu/admissions-studentstories/2014/05/luaroo.html|website=Lawrence University Student Stories|publisher=Lawrence University|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the musician [[The Tallest Man on Earth]] played at the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nyman|first1=Shane|title=LU to host Tallest Man on Earth|url=http://www.postcrescent.com/story/entertainment/music/2016/04/05/lu-host-tallest-man-earth/82656062/|website=The Post-Crescent|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the university's Spring Term, many seniors participate in the Senior Streak, which typically happens during the eighth week of the term.&lt;ref name="The Lawrentian"&gt;{{cite web|title=Staff Editorial: Senior streak re-revisited|url=http://www.lawrentian.com/archives/108681|website=The Lawrentian|publisher=The Lawrentian|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the senior streak is to provide seniors with one last opportunity to let loose before finals, graduation, and post-college life.&lt;ref name="The Lawrentian"/&gt; Although rumor says that the senior streak was created as a result of former president [[Richard Warch]]'s aversion to the activity, this has been proven to be false.&lt;ref name="The Lawrentian"/&gt; Students, often coming from Lawrence's on-campus bar, the Viking Room, strip their clothes and run around the area of Main Hall, as one last hurrah before finals and graduation.

==Media==
The student newspaper, ''[[The Lawrentian]]'', has been published for over a century. 

Lawrence University hosts the [[Great Midwest Trivia Contest]], webcast every January over the college radio station, [[WLFM]].

The '''[[wikt:manus#Latin|manus]]''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for ''[[hand]]'') is the [[Zoology|zoological]] term for the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] portion of the fore limb of an animal. In [[tetrapod]]s, it is the part of the [[pentadactyl limb]] that includes the [[metacarpal]]s and digits ([[Phalanx bones|phalanges]]). During [[evolution]], it has taken many forms and served a variety of functions. It can be represented by the hand of [[primate]]s, the lower front limb of hoofed animals or the fore paw and is represented in the wing of [[bird]]s, [[bat]]s and prehistoric flying reptiles ([[pterosaur]]s), the flipper of marine [[mammal]]s and the 'paddle' of [[Extinction|extinct]] marine [[reptile]]s, such as [[plesiosaur]]s and [[ichthyosaur]]s.

In [[cephalopods]], the ''manus'' is the end, broader part of a tentacle or arm, and its [[sucker (cephalopod anatomy)|suckers]] are often larger and arranged differently from those on the rest of the arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U7N1j-8LMsEC&amp;pg=PA277&amp;dq=Manus+%28zoology%29&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HLAUTcfVFMSblgeputDgCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Manus&amp;f=false|title=Modern Text Book of Zoology: Vertebrates|last=Prof. R.L.Kotpal|publisher=Rastogi Publications|year=2009|isbn=81-7133-891-7|location=Meerut, New Delhi, India|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509183158/https://books.google.com/books?id=U7N1j-8LMsEC#v=onepage&amp;q=Manus&amp;f=false|archivedate=2016-05-09|df=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|biological molecular motors|man-made molecular motors|Synthetic molecular motor}}
'''Molecular motors''' are biological [[molecular machine]]s that are the essential agents of movement in living organisms. In general terms, a [[Engine|motor]] is a device that consumes energy in one form and converts it into motion or [[mechanical work]]; for example, many [[protein]]-based molecular motors harness the chemical [[Gibbs free energy|free energy]] released by the [[hydrolysis]] of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] in order to perform mechanical work.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bustamante C, Chemla YR, Forde NR, Izhaky D |title=Mechanical processes in biochemistry |journal=Annu. Rev. Biochem. |volume=73 |issue= |pages=705–48 |year=2004 |pmid=15189157 |doi=10.1146/annurev.biochem.72.121801.161542}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of energetic efficiency, this type of motor can be superior to currently available man-made motors. One important difference between molecular motors and macroscopic motors is that molecular motors operate in the [[Thermal bath (thermodynamics)|thermal bath]], an environment in which the [[Thermal fluctuations|fluctuations]] due to [[Fluctuation dissipation theorem|thermal noise]] are significant.

** [[Kinesin]] moves cargo inside cells away from the nucleus along [[microtubule]]s.

The catalysis of the chemical reaction and the movement of protons are coupled to each other via the mechanical rotation of parts of the complex. This is involved in ATP synthesis in the [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplasts]] as well as in [[V-ATPase|pumping of protons across the vacuolar membrane]].&lt;ref name="ATPase"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tsunoda SP, Aggeler R, Yoshida M, Capaldi RA |title=Rotation of the c subunit oligomer in fully functional F1Fo ATP synthase |journal=Proc.

** The bacterial [[flagellum]] responsible for the swimming and tumbling of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' and other bacteria acts as a rigid propeller that is powered by a rotary motor.

** Viral DNA packaging motors inject viral genomic [[DNA]] into capsids as part of their replication cycle, packing it very tightly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith DE, Tans SJ, Smith SB, Grimes S, Anderson DL, Bustamante C |title=The bacteriophage straight phi29 portal motor can package DNA against a large internal force |journal=Nature |volume=413 |issue=6857 |pages=748–52 |date=October 2001 |pmid=11607035 |doi=10.1038/35099581|bibcode = 2001Natur.413..748S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several models have been put forward to explain how the protein generates the force required to drive the DNA into the capsid; for a review, see [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4614-0980-9_23]. An alternative proposal is that, in contrast with all other biological motors, the force is not generated directly by the protein, but by the DNA itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harvey, SC |title=The scrunchworm hypothesis: Transitions between A-DNA and B-DNA provide the driving force for genome packaging in double-stranded DNA bacteriophages |journal=Journal of Structural Biology |volume=189 |pages=1–8 |year=2015 |pmid=25486612 |doi=10.1016/j.jsb.2014.11.012 |pmc=4357361}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, ATP hydrolysis is used to drive protein conformational changes that alternatively dehydrate and rehydrate the DNA, cyclically driving it from [[B-DNA]] to [[A-DNA]] and back again. A-DNA is 23% shorter than B-DNA, and the DNA shrink/expand cycle is coupled to a protein-DNA grip/release cycle to generate the forward motion that propels DNA into the capsid.
* Enzymatic motors:
**Catalase
**Urease
**Aldolase
**Hexokinase
**Phosphoglucose isomerase
**Phosphofructokinase
*[[Synthetic molecular motors]] have been created by chemists that yield rotation, possibly generating torque.

== Theoretical considerations ==
Because the motor events are [[stochastic]], molecular motors are often modeled with the [[Fokker–Planck equation]] or with [[Monte Carlo method]]s. These theoretical models are especially useful when treating the molecular motor as a [[Brownian motor]].

== Experimental observation ==
In experimental [[biophysics]], the activity of molecular motors is observed with many different experimental approaches, among them:

* Fluorescent methods: fluorescence resonance energy transfer ([[Fluorescence resonance energy transfer|FRET]]), fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ([[Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy|FCS]]), total internal reflection fluorescence ([[Total internal reflection fluorescence microscope|TIRF]]).
* [[Magnetic tweezers]] can also be useful for analysis of motors that operate on long pieces of DNA.
* [[Neutron spin echo]] spectroscopy can be used to observe motion on nanosecond timescales.
* [[Optical tweezers]] (not to be confused with [[molecular tweezers]] in context) are well-suited for studying molecular motors because of their low spring constants.
* Scattering techniques: single particle tracking based on [[dark field microscopy]] or [[interferometric scattering microscopy]] (iSCAT)
* Single-molecule [[electrophysiology]] can be used to measure the dynamics of individual ion channels.

Many more techniques are also used. As new technologies and methods are developed, it is expected that knowledge of naturally occurring molecular motors will be helpful in constructing synthetic nanoscale motors.

== Non-biological ==
{{Main|Synthetic molecular motor}}
Recently, [[chemists]] and those involved in [[nanotechnology]] have begun to explore the possibility of creating molecular motors ''de novo.'' These [[synthetic molecular motors]] currently suffer many limitations that confine their use to the research laboratory. However, many of these limitations may be overcome as our understanding of chemistry and physics at the nanoscale increases. One step toward understanding nanoscale dynamics was made with the study of catalyst diffusion in the Grubb's catalyst system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dey|first=Krishna Kanti|last2=Pong|first2=Frances Ying|last3=Breffke|first3=Jens|last4=Pavlick|first4=Ryan|last5=Hatzakis|first5=Emmanuel|last6=Pacheco|first6=Carlos|last7=Sen|first7=Ayusman|date=2016|editor4-last=|title=Dynamic Coupling at the Angstrçm Scale|url=|journal=Angew. Chem.|volume=128|pages=1125–1129|doi=10.1002/ange.201509237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other systems like the [[nanocar]]s, while not technically motors, are also illustrative of recent efforts towards synthetic nanoscale motors. 

Other non-reacting molecules can also behave as motors. This has been demonstrated by using dye molecules that move directionally in gradients of polymer solution through favorable hydrophobic interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guha|first=Rajarshi|last2=Mohajerani|first2=Farzad|last3=Collins|first3=Matthew|last4=Ghosh|first4=Subhadip|last5=Sen|first5=Ayusman|last6=Velegol|first6=Darrell|date=2017-10-24|title=Chemotaxis of Molecular Dyes in Polymer Gradients in Solution|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.7b08783|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|language=EN|volume=139|issue=44|pages=15588–15591|doi=10.1021/jacs.7b08783|issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nautical Archaeology Program''' (NAP) is a degree-granting program within the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080929210141/http://anthropology.tamu.edu/index.htm Anthropology Department] at [[Texas A&amp;M University]] in [[College Station, Texas]].

The Nautical Archaeology Program offers admission to students seeking graduate degrees in [[Maritime archaeology|nautical archaeology]]. The primary focus is on training archaeologists to become divers, rather than teaching divers the principles of anthropology and archaeology.  Students are also required to learn the principles of archaeological conservation, with primary emphasis on the treatment of waterlogged artifacts.

==Academic Program==
The program has six full-time faculty members and many research associates who conduct surveys, excavations, conservation and reconstruction of ancient, medieval, and early modern shipwrecks. Each professor holds an endowed fellowship.  All NAP students are required to take several core courses: History of Wooden Shipbuilding, Research and Reconstruction of Ships, Conservation of Cultural Resources, and Archaeological Methods and Theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nautarch.tamu.edu/academic/classes.html NAP Class Information]&lt;/ref&gt; The average time to complete a master's degree is three to five years; for a Ph.D. the average is five to seven years.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Donny L. 2005. ''The Institute of Nautical Archaeology &amp; The Nautical Archaeology Program: A History of Both Institutions, Their Interaction, and Their Role in Student Education''. The INA Quarterly, 32(2) 14-21.&lt;/ref&gt; The program admits between eight and ten students each year. Graduating students are awarded their M.A. or Ph.D. in Anthropology.

==History of the Program==
The Nautical Archaeology Program began after the [[Institute of Nautical Archaeology]] (INA) became affiliated with Texas A&amp;M University in 1976.  As part of the affiliation, Texas A&amp;M established the Nautical Archaeology Program as a separate entity.  Since the first excavations INA carried out were in the Mediterranean, the main focus was initially on Old World nautical archaeology; after affiliating with the University, a New World archaeologist joined the staff, and work began in North America and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Bass, George F. "Introduction: Reclaiming Lost History from Beneath the Seven Seas" ''In Beneath the Seven Seas: Adventures with the Institute of Nautical Archaeology'', ed. George F. Bass, 10-27. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  The establishment of a department dedicated to the discipline allowed [[nautical archaeology]] to develop into an important subfield of archaeology.

===Laboratories===

*[http://nautarch.tamu.edu/WilderLab/ The Wilder Imaging Laboratory] was directed by Dr. C. Wayne Smith until 2016

===Creation of Center for Maritime Archaeology and Conservation===
In 2005, the Texas A&amp;M University System Board of Regents established the [[Center for Maritime Archaeology and Conservation]] (CMAC), a research center intended to be the main mechanism of cooperation between the Nautical Archaeology Program and the Institute of Nautical Archaeology. All of the laboratories once part of the Nautical Archaeology Program are now administered by CMAC. CMAC is meant to be the Nautical counterpart of the Center for the Study of the First Americans (CSFA), a highly regarded research institute affiliated with Texas A&amp;M which works closely with the terrestrial archaeologists in the Anthropology department.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, D. 2005, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nautical Archaeology Program Faculty===
The staff of six full-time professors of Nautical Archaeology makes the NAP one of the largest academic programs in nautical archaeology in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, D. 2005, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; NAP professors direct most of INA's projects, since the security offered by their permanent positions allows a long-term commitment to excavation and publishing.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, D. 2005, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Each professor holds an endowed fellowship, professorship, or chair&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, D. 2005, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the creation of the program, there have been only 11 faculty members: Dr. [[George Bass (archaeologist)|George Bass]], Dr. Frederick van Doornick, Jr., Dr. Fred Hocker, J. Richard Steffy, Dr. Deborah Carlson, Dr. Filipe Vieira de Castro, Dr. Kevin Crisman, Dr. Donny Hamilton, Dr. Cemal Pulak, Dr. C. Wayne Smith, and Dr. Shelley Wachsmann.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, D. 2005, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Bass and Dr. van Doornick are now professors emeriti and Dr. Hocker left the program in 1999 after eight years of teaching to take a position with the Center for Maritime Archaeology, part of the [[National Museum of Denmark]] in Roskilde. J. Richard Steffy died from chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder on November 29, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/04/us/04steffy.html NY Times Obituary, December 4, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[population dynamics]] and [[population ecology]], '''overshoot''' occurs when a population temporarily exceeds the long term [[carrying capacity]] of its environment. The environment usually has mechanisms in place to prevent overshoot. For example, plants are only able to regenerate and regrow a few times after being consumed before completely dying off. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thesenecaeffect.wordpress.com/2014/12/01/humans-in-ecological-overshoot-collapse-now-to-avoid-a-larger-catastrophe/|title=Humans in ecological overshoot: Collapse now to avoid a larger catastrophe|last=schreef|first=Nathan Surendran|date=2014-12-01|website=The Seneca Effect|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consequence of overshoot is called a collapse, a crash or a die-off in which there is a decline in [[population density]]. The entire sequence or trajectory undergone by the population and its environment together is often termed 'overshoot-and-collapse'.

Overshoot can occur due to lag effects.  [[Reproduction]] rates may remain high relative to the [[Mortality rate|death rate]].&lt;ref name="eaec"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ecology and Ecosystem Conservation |last=Schmitz |first=Oswald J. |author2= |year=2013 |publisher=Island Press |isbn=1597265985 |page=51 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ip7phSL199YC |accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entire [[ecosystem]]s may be severely affected and sometimes reduced to less-[[Complexity|complex]] states due to prolonged overshoot.&lt;ref name="geap"&gt;{{cite book |title=Green Ethics and Philosophy: An A-to-Z Guide Volume 8 of The SAGE Reference Series on Green Society: Toward a Sustainable Future-Series Editor: Paul Robbins |chapter=Development and Ethical Sustainability |last=Howes |first=Michael |editor1-first=Julie |editor1-last=Newman |year=2011 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=1452266220 |page=114 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l7e9AwAAQBAJ |accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The eradication of disease can trigger overshoot when a population suddenly exceeds the land's carrying capacity. An example of this occurred on the [[Horn of Africa]] when [[smallpox]] was eliminated. A region that had supported around 1 million [[pastoralists]] for centuries was suddenly expected to support 14 million people. The result was [[overgrazing]], which led to [[soil erosion]].&lt;ref name="lkp"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21029-lowkey-projects-keep-horn-of-africa-famine-at-bay.html?DCMP=OTC-rss&amp;nsref=online-news |title=Low-key projects keep Horn of Africa famine at bay |author=Debora MacKenzie |accessdate=11 October 2011 |date=10 October 2011 |work=NewScientist |publisher=Reed Business Information }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measuring human overshoot==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
Globally, we can measure how much the human economy demands against what the biosphere can renew.&lt;ref&gt;Mathis Wackernagel, Niels B. Schulz, Diana Deumling, Alejandro Callejas Linares, Martin Jenkins, Valerie Kapos, Chad Monfreda, Jonathan Loh, Norman Myers Richard Norgaard and Jørgen Rander (May 16, 2002). [http://www.pnas.org/content/99/14/9266.full.pdf+html?sid=1dc62d01-1f10-4ef5-a47c-af92a54dacb2 Tracking the ecological overshoot of the human economy]. Retrieved 2 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; One accounting approach is the [[ecological footprint]]. Footprint accounting measures the demand on [[biocapacity]], i.e., area of biologically productive land and water required to produce the ecological services (including resource regeneration and waste absorption) for a given population. Biocapacity encompasses the biologically productive capacity of all of the planet's surface areas – cropland, grazing land, forest, fresh water etc. Footprint accounts include non-renewable resources like fossil fuels and other minerals in as far as their use puts a demand on biocapacity. Some demands are difficult to measure and are not included in the accounts – hence the results tend to underestimate dependency. Ecological footprint and biocapacity are measured in global hectares (hectares with world average biological productivity). Thus increased productivity would reduce dependency; while increased population or consumption per head would increase it.

The percentage of an area's footprint supported from its renewable resources shows its overall resource dependence within or above its areas' regeneration rate. A percentage over 100 percent indicates local overuse or net dependence on ecosystems elsewhere.  Similarly, the percentage of an area’s population supported from its renewable resources is its sustainable population at current consumption levels with current technology; the remaining percentage is its overshoot population. A country's biocapacity deficit increases as either their population or their per capita consumption grows; and faster if both grow.

==Overshoot Index of various countries==
A detailed list of countries and their main figures to compute the Overshoot (overpopulation) index has been computed by The Optimum Population Trust. All source data is from [http://www.footprintnetwork.org/images/uploads/Ecological_Footprint_Atlas_2010.pdf The Ecological Footprint Atlas 2010], based on 2007 figures, produced by the [[Global Footprint Network]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footprintnetwork.org Global Footprint Network]. Retrieved 6 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Countries with populations of under one million have been omitted. Global Footprint Network’s data are largely from UN sources; their methodology&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/methodology/ Methodology and Sources]. Global Footprint Network. Retrieved 6 August 2016. &lt;/ref&gt; is still admittedly imprecise, but is subject to continuous refinement.

'''Pal(a)eoethnobotany''' or '''Archaeobotany''' is the [[archaeology|archaeological]] sub-field that studies [[plant]] remains from archaeological sites.&lt;ref&gt;Current Paleoethnobotany Analytical Methods and Cultural Interpretations of Archaeological Plant Remains&lt;/ref&gt;  Basing on the recovery and identification of plant remains and the ecological and cultural information available for modern plants, the major research themes are the use of wild plants, the [[origins of agriculture]] and [[domestication]], and the [[co-evolution]] of human-plant interactions.

==Preservation==
Plant macro[[fossil]]s are preserved through four main modes of preservation at archaeological sites. First, plant remains, usually [[cereal]] grains, chaff, seeds and charcoal are largely reduced to elemental carbon (charred) when they are heated in a reducing atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Märkle |first1=T|last2=Rösch|first2=M |title=Experiments on the effects of carbonization on some cultivated plant seeds |journal=Vegetation History and Archaeobotany |volume=17|pages=257–263 |doi=10.1007/s00334-008-0165-7|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00334-008-0165-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are referred to as 'charred' or 'carbonised' plant remains. This mode of preservation is biased towards plant remains that come into contact with fire, through cooking or fuel use, and those that are less fragile, such as cereal grains and nutshell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hillman, G |title=Reconstructing crop husbandry practices from charred remains of crops|editor1-last=Mercer|editor1-first=R |work=Farming Practice in British Prehistory |date=1981|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|pages=123–162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, plant remains deposited in permanently waterlogged anoxic conditions are preserved as the absence of oxygen prohibits microbial activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kenward |first1=H|last2=Hall |first2=A |title=Urban organic archaeology: an irreplacable palaeoecological archive at risk|journal=World Archaeology|date=2014 |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=584–596 |doi=10.1080/00438240802453286|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00438240802453286#.VET0DIvF9ps}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mode of preservation occurs in deep archaeological features such as wells, in urban settlements where organic refuse is rapidly deposited, and at settlements adjacent to lakes or rivers. A wide range of plant remains are usually preserved, including seeds, fruit stones, nutshells, leaves, straw and other vegetative material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jacomet, S |title=Archaeobotany: analyses of plant remains from waterlogged archaeological sites|editor1-last=Menotti|editor1-first=F|editor2-last=O'Sullivan |editor2-first=A |work=The Oxford Handbook of Wetland Archaeology|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=497–514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third, calcium-phosphate mineralisation of plant remains occurs usually in latrine pits and in middens, as plant remains are completely replaced by calcium-phosphate. In latrine pits, plant remains consumed by humans are the most common items, such as seeds of flavourings, fruit pips and fruit stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=D |title=Defining an ‘indicator package’ to allow identification of ‘cess pits’ in the archaeological record|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=40|pages=526–543 |doi=10.1016/j.jas.2012.06.014|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440312002531}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, plant remains are preserved by desiccation in arid environments, where the absence of water limits decomposition. Delicate vegetative plant remains are preserved, such as onion skin and artichoke bracts, alongside fruit stones, cereal chaff and seeds of wild plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van der Veen|first1=M|title=Formation processes of desiccated and carbonized plant remains e the identification of routine practice |journal=Journal of Archaeological Science |date=2007 |volume=34 |issue=6|pages=968–990 |doi=10.1016/j.jas.2006.09.007|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440306001865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recovery methods ==
Paleoethnobotanists use a variety of methods to recover and identify plant remains. Charred plant remains are usually recovered by flotation. The matrix (the soil from a suspected [[feature (archaeology)|archaeological feature]]) is slowly added to agitated water.  The soil, sand, and other heavy material, known as ''heavy fraction'', sink to the bottom. Less dense organic material, such as charred seeds, grains and charcoal tend to float to the surface. The material that floats to the top, called ''light fraction'', is poured into a sieve (usually 250-500&amp;nbsp;µm). The light fraction is then dried and later examined under a low power microscope.  Samples of the heavy fraction are also gathered for later analysis. Flotation can be undertaken manually with buckets, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/archaeobotany/buckets|title=buckets - archaeobotany|author=|date=|website=sites.google.com|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by machine-assisted flotation where water is circulated through a series of tanks by a pump. Waterlogged plant remains are separated from the matrix by a combination of wet-sieving and/or small-scale flotation in a laboratory. &lt;ref&gt;Tolar et al. 2010.

== Identification and Quantification ==
Identification of macroremains is then usually carried out under a stereomicroscope, using [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] features such as shape and surface features in the case of seeds,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Method and Theory in Paleoethnobotany|last=Fritz|first=G|last2=Nesbitt|first2=M|publisher=University of Colorado|year=2014|isbn=|location=Boulder|pages=115–145|chapter=Laboratory analysis and identification of plant macroremains}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[histology|microanatomy]] in the case of wood or charcoal. Identification literature as well as a comparative collection of modern plant materials are crucial for reliable results. Depending on the type of material, and its condition, also other methods such as [[thin section]]s or [[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] are applied. Plant macroremains are quantified on the basis of a sample, using either quantitative, semi-quantitive, or presence/absence scores.

Paleoethnobotanists also recover and analyze microremains (such as [[phytoliths]] and [[palynology|pollen]]), human and animal excrements ([[paleofeces]], sometimes called [[coprolite]]s), or plant impressions in ceramic sherds and clay (such as in daub).

[[Palynology]] is a mature and distinct scientific discipline that studies [[pollen]], typically in the context of reconstructing past environments.

[[Dendrochronology]], the study of growth rings on trees relating to study of past environments, is another scientific discipline useful to paleoethnobotanical study.

==Research==
The work done in paleoethnobotany can be divided into [[field work]], collections management, systematic description of species, and theories into the origins of human and plant interaction. Some examples of this analysis:

A paleoethnobotanist may find discrete concentrations of burned or dried remnants of seeds in an area of discolored soil (a possible [[hearth]] feature).  If later analyses indicates that the remnants were of only mature wild seeds of a type of plant that grows locally, it could be inferred that the site was only visited seasonally.  Such an inference could be supported by a lack of other features that would suggest that no permanent shelters were built at the site.

Alternatively, a paleoethnobotanist may find that a fire pit
feature contains concentrated remnants of a wide variety of edible
wild plants that mature throughout the year.  An archaeologist may find
features at the site that indicate some sort of semi-permanent
dwellings (such as post holes and [[middens]]).  The middens may have
concentrations of animal remains, identified by a [[zooarchaeology|zooarchaeologist]] as those of wild game, with a variety of species-specific maturity levels.  In that case, a more permanent settlement may be inferred, perhaps to the level of a village.  Such an analysis of the archaeological features could suggest a society of [[hunter-gatherer]]s who inhabited the site on a
more-or-less year-round basis.

A paleoethnobotanist may also find concentrated remains of plants
that typically are only grown through active [[tillage|cultivation]] (such as [[cereals]], [[legumes]], and [[oilseeds]]).  At the same site, an archaeologist might identify features such as stone walls surrounding enclosures arrayed in a pattern, and deep, layered middens with concentrations of domesticated animal remains such as goats or pigs.  An analysis of the site, set within the context of the archaeological features and animal and plant remains, would suggest a settled [[agriculture|agrarian]] community.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5091">'''Papyrology''' is the study of ancient literature, correspondence, legal archives, etc., as preserved in [[manuscript]]s written on [[papyrus]], the most common form of writing material in the ancient civilizations of [[Egypt]], [[Greece]], and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. Papyrology includes both the translation and interpretation of ancient documents in a variety of languages and the care and preservation of rare papyrus originals.

Papyrology as a systematic discipline dates from the 1890s, when large caches of well-preserved papyri were discovered by [[archaeologist]]s in several locations in [[Egypt]], such as Arsinoe ([[Faiyum]]) and [[Oxyrhynchus]]. Leading centres of papyrology include [[Oxford University]], [[Heidelberg University]], [[Columbia University]], the [[University of Michigan]], [[Leiden University]], the [[Österreichische Nationalbibliothek]], 
[[University of California, Berkeley]] and the Istituto Papirologico "G. Vitelli" connected to the [[University of Florence]]. Founders of papyrology were the Viennese orientalist {{ill|Joseph von Karabacek|de}} (Arabic papyrology),&lt;ref&gt;Jane Turner, ''The Dictionary of Art'', Grove's Dictionaries, 1996, p.548&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilhelm Schubart]] (Greek papyrology),&lt;ref&gt;''The Harvard Theological Review'', Harvard Divinity School 1941, p.220&lt;/ref&gt; the Austrian antiquarian {{ill|Theodor Graf|de}} who acquired more than 100,000 Greek, Arabic, Coptic and Persian papyri in Egypt, which were bought by the Austrian [[Archduke Rainer Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Rainer]],&lt;ref&gt;Glenn W. Most, ''Disciplining Classics: Altertumswissenschaft als Beruf'', 2002, p.192&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grigol Tsereteli|G. F. Tsereteli]] who published papyri of Russian and Georgian collections,&lt;ref&gt;Bobodzhan Gafurovich Gafurov, Yuri Vladimirovich Gankovskiĭ, ''Fifty Years of Soviet Oriental Studies'', Institut narodov Azii (Akademii︠a︡ nauk SSSR) 1968, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Frederic George Kenyon]],&lt;ref&gt;Leo Deuel, ''Testaments of Time: The Search for Lost Manuscripts and Records'', Knopf, 1965, p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ulrich Wilcken]], [[Bernard Pyne Grenfell]], [[Arthur Surridge Hunt]]&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Centre for Postgraduate Hebrew Studies, ''The Journal of Jewish Studies'', Jewish Chronicle Publications, 1974, p.420&lt;/ref&gt; and other distinguished scientists. 

The collection of pagan, Christian and Arabic [[papyrus|papyri]] in Vienna called the {{ill|Rainer papyri|de|Papyrussammlung und Papyrusmuseum Wien}} represents the first large discovery of manuscripts on papyrus found in the [[Fayum]] in [[Egypt]]. Around 1880, a carpet trader in Cairo acquired on behalf of Karabacek over 10,000 papyri and some texts written on linen. Of those Fayum papyri, over 3000 are written in Arabic. The papyri originated from Kôm Fâris ([[Crocodilopolis|Krokodílon Pólis]]) and Ihnasiyyah al-Madinah ([[Herakleopolis Magna]]), the textile pages from Kôm al-‘Azâma. They were exported to Vienna in 1882, and presented in a public exhibition the following year that caused a sensation. Later the papyri were bought by the Grand Duke Rainer and presented to the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences|Kaiserliche Akademie der Wissenschaften]] in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Anker, ''Libri: International Library Review'', International Federation of Library Associations  1951, p.234&lt;/ref&gt;

The first papyrus was published in the West by Cardinal [[Stefano Borgia]] in [[Velletri]] in 1778, with the title "Charta papyracea Graece scripta Museums Borgiani Velitris" famous by the name of Charta Borgiana.

'''Physically based rendering''' or '''PBR''' is a [[shader|shading model]] in [[computer graphics]] that seeks to [[3D rendering|render]] graphics in a way that more accurately models the [[optics|flow of light]] in the real world.  Many PBR pipelines (though not all) have the accurate simulation of [[photorealism]] as their goal, often in [[real time computing]].  [[Photogrammetry]] may be used to help discover and encode accurate optical properties of materials.

==History==

Starting in the 1980s, a number of rendering researchers worked on establishing a solid theoretical basis for rendering, including physical correctness. Much of this work was done at the [[Cornell University]] Program of Computer Graphics; a 1997 paper from that lab&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Donald P., Torrance, Kenneth E., Shirley, Peter, Arvo, James, Ferwerda, James A., Pattanaik, Suumanta, Lafortune, Eric, Walter, Bruce, Foo, Sing-Choong, and Trumbore, Ben [http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/pubs/1997/GTS+97.pdf "A Framework for Realistic Image Synthesis". Retrieved on 27 November 2017].&lt;/ref&gt; describes the work done at Cornell in this area to that point.

The phrase was more widely popularized by [[Matt Pharr]], Greg Humphreys, and Pat Hanrahan in their book of the same name from 2004, a seminal work in modern computer graphics that won its authors a Technical Achievement [[Academy Award]] for [[special effects]].&lt;ref&gt;Pharr, Matt, Humphreys, Greg, and Hanrahan, Pat. [http://www.pbrt.org "Physically Based Rendering"].  Retrieved on 14 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==

As described by researcher Jeff Russell of Marmoset, a physically based rendering pipeline may focus on the following areas:&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Jeff, [https://www.marmoset.co/toolbag/learn/pbr-theory "PBR Theory"]. Retrieved on 14 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Reflection (computer graphics)|Reflection]]
* [[Diffusion]]
* [[Translucency|Translucency and transparency]]
* [[Conservation of energy]]
* [[Metallic color|Metallicity]]
* [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel|Fresnel]] reflectivity
* [[Microsurface]] scattering

PBR is, as Joe Wilson puts it, "more of a concept than a strict set of rules"&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Joe. [https://www.marmoset.co/posts/physically-based-rendering-and-you-can-too/ "Physically Based Rendering – And You Can Too!"] Retrieved on 12 Jan 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; – but the concept contains several distinctive points of note.   One of these is that – unlike many previous models that sought to differentiate surfaces between non-reflective and reflective – PBR recognizes that, in the real world, as John Hable puts it, "everything is shiny".&lt;ref&gt;Hable, John . [http://filmicgames.com/archives/547 "Everything Is Shiny"].  Retrieved on 14 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even "flat" or "matte" surfaces in the real world such as [[rubber]] will reflect a small degree of light, and many [[metal]]s and [[liquid]]s will reflect a great deal of it.  Another thing that PBR models attempt to do is to integrate [[photogrammetry]] - measurements from photographs of real-world materials - to study and replicate real physical ranges of values to accurately simulate [[albedo]], [[gloss (optics)|gloss]], [[reflectivity]], and other physical properties.  Finally, PBR puts a great deal of emphasis on [[microsurface]]s, and will often contain additional textures and mathematical models intended to model small-scale [[specular highlights]] and cavities resulting from smoothness or roughness in addition to traditional specular or reflectivity maps.

== State of the art ==
A typical application provides an intuitive [[graphical user interface]] that allows artists to define and layer materials with arbitrary properties and to assign them to a given 2D or 3D object to recreate the appearance of any synthetic or organic material. Environments can be defined with procedural shaders or textures as well as procedural geometry or meshes or pointclouds&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://help.sketchfab.com/hc/en-us/articles/209143806-Point-Clouds|title=Point Clouds|last=|first=|date=|website=Sketchfab Help Center|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;. If possible all changes are made visible in real-time and therefore allow for quick iterations. Sophisticated applications allow savvy users to write custom shaders in a [[shading language]].

A '''private defense agency''' ('''PDA''') is an enterprise which would provide personal protection and [[military|military defense]] services to individuals who would voluntarily contract for its services. PDAs are advocated in [[anarcho-capitalism]] and market-based forms of [[social anarchism]], such as [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

A PDA is distinguished from a [[Private military company|private contractor]] of the state which is [[Subsidy|subsidized]] financially through [[taxation]] or legally through [[monopoly]] and [[Immunity from prosecution|immunity]], and relies on [[conscription]] and other involuntary support. Instead, such agencies would be voluntarily financed primarily by competing [[insurance]] and [[security]] companies, which are penalized for losses and damages, and have a financial incentive to minimize waste and maximize quality of service.

==Theory==
As proponents of [[free-market anarchism]],
[[Benjamin Tucker]]&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin,''The Relation of the State to the Individual'', 1890&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tucker |first=Benjamin |title=Liberty and Taxation |journal=[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gustave de Molinari]] first explicitly proposed for-profit private defense agencies.
The concept later was advanced and expanded upon by [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] who consider the state to be illegitimate, and therefore believe defense is something that should be provided or determined privately by individuals and firms competing in a free market. The [[Mises Institute]] published a book of essays entitled ''[[The Myth of National Defense: Essays on the Theory and History of Security Production]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The Mises Review (Vol. 10, No. 1; Spring 2004) A summary is given in a review by David Gordon [https://www.mises.org/misesreview_detail.asp?control=247&amp;sortorder=issue].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murray N. Rothbard]] in ''[[For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto]]'' and [[David D. Friedman]] in ''[[The Machinery of Freedom]]'' expand substantially on the idea. Both hold that a PDA would be part of a [[privatization|privatized]] system of [[law]], [[police]], [[court]]s, [[insurance companies]] and [[arbitration]] agencies who are responsible for preventing and dealing with aggression. In this environment, [[victimless crime]]s and "crimes against the state" would be rendered [[Mootness|moot]], and the legal realm would be limited to [[contract]]ual disputes and [[tort]] damages, as from [[assault]], [[burglary]], [[pollution]], and all other forms of aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Murray N. |last=Rothbard |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard133.html |title=Society without a State |journal=[[The Libertarian Forum]] |volume=7 |issue=1 |date=January 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Friedman, [http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Libertarian/Machinery_of_Freedom/MofF_Chapter_29.html Police, Courts, and Laws---on the Market], [http://daviddfriedman.com David Friedman home page].&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is similar to [[Polycentric law]]. Within [[economics]], discussion of the concept largely has been confined to the [[Austrian School]], as in [[Hans Hoppe]]'s article "The Private Production of Defense" published by the [[Mises Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Hans |last=Hoppe |url=https://www.mises.org/journals/jls/14_1/14_1_2.pdf |journal=[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]] |format=[[PDF]] | title=The Private Production of Defense}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These authors emphasize that PDAs have different motives from existing [[Statism|statist]] defense agencies. Their survival depends on quality of service leading to a wide customer base, rather than the ability to extract funds via the force of law, as is true of [[Sovereign state|states]]. Customers and markets would thus dictate that PDAs minimize offensive tendencies and [[Militarism|militarization]] in favor of a pure defense. Anarcho-capitalists believe such privatization and [[decentralization]] of defense would eliminate the credibility of, and popular support for, the state.

As a private firm offering individually determined defense, the PDA provides a model for how an entirely private defense would work in a free market. [[John Frederic Kosanke]] argues that the need for large-scale defense is minimized in direct inverse proportion to the extent of domestic control by the state. Since the greater number of [[proprietor]]s makes [[Surrender (military)|surrender]] more costly to an aggressor than a relatively authoritarian region, [[vulnerability]] to attack is less likely. Furthermore, since individuals minding their own business pose little threat to neighboring regions, official or [[Ideology|ideological]] justification by those neighbors for attacking them is also proportionately diminished.&lt;ref&gt;John Frederic Kosanke, [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/johnfkosanke/Civilization101.html%23biv&amp;date=2009-10-26+00:56:26 "Civilization 101 - Elements of Security"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of monopoly power===
Hoppe points out that there is a contradiction in the beliefs of most philosophers and economists in reference to national defense. They generally hold that any [[monopoly]] is "bad" for consumers because, shielded from potential new entrants into his area of production, the price of his product X will be higher and its quality lower than otherwise. Yet they simultaneously hold that security must be undertaken by the government, which is a territorial monopoly of law and order (the ultimate decision maker and enforcer). Hoppe holds that the two propositions are clearly incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of National Defense|chapter=Introduction|pages=3–4|author=Hoppe, Hans-Hermann|isbn=0-945466-37-4|year=2003|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Inst.|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay ''The Production of Security'', Molinari concluded:&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/web/2716 The Production of Security&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|If there is one well-established truth in political economy, it is this: That in all cases, for all commodities that serve to provide for the tangible or intangible needs of the consumer, it is in the consumer's best interest that labor and trade remain free, because the freedom of labor and of trade have as their necessary and permanent result the maximum reduction of price. And this: That the interests of the consumer of any commodity whatsoever should always prevail over the interests of the producer. Now in pursuing these principles, one arrives at this rigorous conclusion: That the production of security should, in the interests of the consumers of this intangible commodity, remain subject to the law of free competition. Whence it follows: That no government should have the right to prevent another government from going into competition with it, or to require consumers of security to come exclusively to it for this commodity.}}
Tyler Cowen, however, argues that allowing private defense agencies would not necessarily prevent a monopoly on defense services, by positing that a cooperating network of such firms could use aggressive force to enforce the [[cartel]]'s market domination. Noting that advocates of PDAs typically argue that abuses would be prevented by the presence of rival agencies acting under the authority of rulings made by arbitrators empowered by inter-agency [[arbitration agreement]]s, Cowen opines, "The adjudication network is stable only if it can use force to put down outlaw agencies that do not accept its higher-order arbitration decisions. Such a network could also use force to put down firms that do not adhere to the collusive agreement."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Rejoinder to David Friedman on the Economics of Anarchy|author=Cowen, Tyler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anarcho-capitalist]]s argue that competing defense providers would concentrate on comparatively lower-cost defense and security technology rather than relatively costly offensive weaponry, in order to maintain lower premiums and service charges. A company's offensive capabilities would also be readily exposed by such an aggressor's competitors. State-subsidized militaries, in contrast, are granted a distinct offensive advantage, resulting in a proportionately greater tendency toward monopolization.

===Aggression and abuses by private defense agencies===
[[Randall G. Holcombe]] argues that "Firms might prey on their competitors' customers, as competing mafia groups do, to show those customers that their current protective firm is not doing the job and thus to induce them to switch protection firms. This action seems to be a profit-maximizing strategy; hence, protection firms that do not prey on noncustomers may not survive." Holcombe states that [[mafia]]s offers protection for a fee, but it also uses its resources for predation; and thus profit-maximizing firms could be expected to employ them in the dual roles of protection and predation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Government: Unnecessary but Inevitable|author=Holcombe, Randall G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Leeson]] and [[Edward Stringham]] rebut this argument by claiming that unless the firm were overwhelmingly more powerful than its prey, it could incur substantial costs and risks in attempting to extract wealth by force. They argue that the potential for even a small state to inflict losses on a larger state explains why violent confrontations between states are less common than between individuals in [[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]]; in other words, it is not the size of the group in question that matters, since in either case being the aggressor is likely to bring about undesirable risks and diminution of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Is Government Inevitable? Comment on Holcombe's Analysis|author1=Leeson, Peter  |author2=Stringham, Edward P  |lastauthoramp=yes |ssrn=1674461 |journal=[[Independent Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Market for Liberty]]'', Linda and Morris Tannehill note that a private defense agency would be unlikely to engage in aggression, as it would not only become a target of retaliatory force, but would become the subject of severe business ostracism. Honest and productive individuals would dissociate themselves from it, fearing that it might use its aggressive force against them in the event of a dispute; or that they might become accidental casualties when retaliatory force is used by one of its other victims; or that their own reputation would suffer due to their ties to it. Moreover, the private defense agency's reputation would suffer and it would be regarded as a poor credit and insurance risk, the latter due to the high risk of claims resulting from its involvement in aggression. The employees and leaders of such an agency as well could face personal civil liability for their involvement, and the agency would not be shielded by [[sovereign immunity]]. High-quality employees would presumably be less willing to be involved with such an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Market for Liberty|pages=109–111|chapter=Warring Defense Agencies and Organized Crime|author=Tannehill, Linda and Morris|isbn=0-930073-08-8|year=1993|publisher=Fox &amp; Wilkes|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also argue that a defense company would be less likely to abuse its power and impose tyranny, noting that it "couldn't extract taxes from them, as a government does...A market relationship is a free relationship, and if a customer doesn't like a company's service or mistrusts its goals, he is free to take his business elsewhere, or to start his own competitive company, or to do without the service and just provide from himself...The objection that a tyrant might take over is actually a devastating argument against government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Market for Liberty|chapter=Warring Defense Agencies and Organized Crime|author=Tannehill, Linda and Morris|isbn=0-930073-08-8|page=115|year=1993|publisher=Fox &amp; Wilkes|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rothbard makes a similar point, noting, "Of course, some of the private defense agencies will become criminal, just as some people become criminal now. But the point is that in a stateless society there would be no regular, ''legalized'' channel for crime and aggression, no government apparatus the control of which provides a secure monopoly for invasion of person and property...To create such an instrument ''de novo'' is very difficult, and, indeed, almost impossible; historically, it took State rulers centuries to create a functioning State apparatus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Man, Economy and State with Power and Market|author=Rothbard, Murray N.|isbn=0-945466-30-7|page=1054|year=2004|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued, "If Defense Agency A instead of invading a business decides to invade a more worthwhile target such as a gold warehouse they are left with a much more complicated problem. The gold warehouse is owned by an entrepreneur who has his own defense agency and the gold in the warehouse also have owners that have hired their own respective defense agencies. In essence, Defense Agency A will have to deal with the wrath of the warehouse owner, the warehouse owner's defense agency and the defense agencies of all the owners of the gold in that warehouse."&lt;ref name=Villacampa&gt;{{Cite journal|title=In a State of Anarchy|author=Villacampa, Alexander|publisher=Grove City College|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert P. Murphy opines that given the privatization of other services in an anarcho-capitalist society, "We must consider that in such an environment, the law-abiding majority would have all sorts of mechanisms at their disposal, beyond physical confrontation. Once private judges had ruled against a particular rogue agency, the private banks could freeze its assets (up to the amount of fines levied by the arbitrators). In addition, the private utility companies could shut down electricity and water to the agency’s headquarters, in accordance with standard provisions in their contracts."&lt;ref&gt;https://mises.org/story/1855&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument that customers will be able to hire a competing firm to protect them against a rogue defense agency has been critiqued by Jonathan Bond's essay, ''The Price of Private Law'', which argues, "If two defense firms are engaged in a truly ‘local’ dispute, and the remaining firms are not convinced that either their own interests will be affected or that systemic destabilization will result if the conflict continues, then the costs of intervening and ending the inter-agency war could presumably bar such third parties from stepping into the crossfire." Bond also argues that some firms may not be concerned with the risk of alienating other clients, because their clientele may consist of a small number of, or even only one, enormous multinational corporations. Bond further argues that some PDAs may reduce their risk of retaliation by carrying out anonymous sabotage or terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Price of Private Law|author=Bond, Jonathan C.|date=11 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Villacampa notes that consumers with large amounts of wealth would likely pay more for private defense, stating "There is no reason for someone void of valuable assets to hire a defense agency that is meant to protect assets other than oneself; but, in an involuntary government payment is demanded for the services regardless of whether they are use or not." He argues an alliance of aggressor private defense agencies would likely be unprofitable: "Chances are high that a mobilization of a mass army of defense agencies will cost more to each individual than his gain from gold, land, and such divided equally amongst themselves. If the region being attacked has large stashes of valuable goods, they will most likely have very effective defense agencies (stronger defense agencies for more valuable assets are logical) and thus the fight against the invading defense agencies will inflict more cost upon the invaders."&lt;ref name=Villacampa/&gt;

===Financing of private defense agencies===
Defense is often viewed as an archetypical [[public good]]{{spaced ndash}}i.e., a product that can only be provided by government because of its [[non-excludability]] and [[non-rivalrous consumption]]. Specifically, the [[free rider problem]], in which people refuse to pay for defense but instead rely on their neighbors to pay for defending the community, is said to make it inevitable that it be financed by taxes if an equitable allocation of costs is to be achieved. According to anarcho-capitalist theorists, there are many ways by which this problem can be overcome or rendered irrelevant. Rothbard's solution was to simply say "Who cares?" when it comes to the issue of free riders. He points out that free riders are commonplace in other aspects of our economy, asking hypothetically, "Are we to be critical because more than one person benefits from someone's actions?...In short, am I to be taxed for enjoying the view of my neighbor's well-kept garden?" He notes that we are all free riders on the past, as we would be living in a primitive society if it were not for the efforts of our ancestors; and we are free riders on the present, because we benefit from the continuing investment of our fellow men and from their specialized skills on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Man, Economy and State|author=Rothbard, Murray N.|isbn=0-945466-30-7|page=1037|year=2004|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph R. Stromberg notes that the [[American Revolution]] occurred despite the fact that some individuals might have been free riders who benefited from it without funding it; he opines that successful defense of freedom often relies not on precise allocations of cost, but on "nationalism, religion, the desire for freedom, hatred of the enemy, social pressure to do the right thing, and so on," some of which might represent "[[enlightened self interest]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of National Defense|pages=237–238|chapter=Mercenaries, Militias, Guerrillas, and the Defense of Minimal States and Free Societies|author=Stromberg, Joseph R.|isbn=0-945466-37-4|year=2003|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Inst.|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Linda and Morris Tannehill]] believe that big businesses will tend to pay the bulk of the defense costs (since they stand to lose the most in the event of an attack); they would then pass on the costs to their customers, and so the costs of defense would be spread out among the whole population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Market for Liberty|chapter=Foreign Aggression|author=Tannehill, Morris and Linda|isbn=0-930073-08-8|page=131|year=1993|publisher=Fox &amp; Wilkes|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; A landowner seeking to establish a community may sell or lease the land with provisions written into the deed or lease agreement, requiring the new owner or tenant to pay for defense on a permanent basis; this same technique has already been in some neighborhoods to ensure that residents pay for private streets shared in common by all of them. As is true for homeowners today, everyone would be responsible for buying or otherwise being covered by aggression insurance in order to protect themselves against catastrophic loss from foreign attack; in the event of an invasion, a claim would be filed with right of [[subrogation]], and the insurer would hire a private defense company to collect from the aggressor. An argument against this method of funding is that other aggression insurers who didn't pay for defense would still benefit from the reduced risk of attack on their customers in the same area, in effect becoming free riders who could drive the "altruistic" insurer out of business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.no-treason.com/archives/2001/06/ No Treason » 2001 » June&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the private defense agency's activity need not be limited to defensive and retaliatory measures funded by the insurer; It could also go after the aggressor in an effort to obtain restitution (including reasonable [[collection cost]]s), perhaps through ransom or capture of enemy assets, as [[privateer]]s did in the 18th and 19th centuries under [[Letter of marque|letters of marque and reprisal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of National Defense|author=Sechrest, Larry J. |authorlink=Larry J. Sechrest |chapter=Privateering and National Defense: Naval Warfare for Private Profit|isbn=0-945466-37-4|page=258|year=2003|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Inst.|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prisoners of war also used to have [[shadow price]]s (ransoms) which were a source of income for victorious forces; this represents another potential alternative to taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of National Defense|author=Radnitzky, Gerard|chapter=Is Democracy More Peaceful than Other Forms of Government?|isbn=0-945466-37-4|page=147|year=2003|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Inst.|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes arguments are made for voluntary funding of defense by way of attacking taxation. Anarcho-capitalists often argue, for instance, that the argument that taxation is needed to fund protection of liberty and property from aggression is a contradiction, because taxation itself requires aggression in order to be enforced. Another argument comes from the fact that, unlike voluntary transactions, no [[demonstrated preference]] has been made by the taxpayer; so there is no objective way of showing that he is receiving a service he wants and needs, at a price that is fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of National Defense|author=Block, Walter|chapter=National Defense and the Theory of Externalities, Public Goods, and Clubs|isbn=0-945466-37-4|page=310|year=2003|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Inst.|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical examples of widespread use==

===Ancient Europe===
Ancient city-states in Greece and Rome depended on [[Liturgy (ancient Greece)|liturgy]]{{spaced ndash}}contributions made by rich citizens for specific purposes{{spaced ndash}}for defense. A liturgy might be used, for instance, to fund the manning of a warship. Although a certain amount was assessed by magistrates, some citizens paid more than required in order to obtain popularity, influence, and sympathy among jurors in the event they were taken to court. During the [[Second Punic War]], [[Quintus Maximus Fabius Verrucosus]] used his personal resources to pay for the release of some Roman prisoners. When the son of [[Scipio Africanus]], who at the time was acting as de facto commander-in chief, was captured during the war against [[Antiochus III the Great]] in 190 BC, he came up with ransom himself. As Rome grew wealthier, greater use was made of private money and/or private armed forces, consisting of relatives and clients, to accomplish public objectives. Between 73 and 71 BC, [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] and [[Pompey|Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] used their own resources to suppress the armies of [[Spartacus]] in the [[Third Servile War]]. [[Julius Caesar]] made his fortune by vanquishing pirates in the Mediterranean and then by [[Gallic Wars|conquering]] [[Gaul]]. The emergence of the modern state caused the members of the upper classes to be disarmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rise and Decline of the State|author=van Creveld, Martin|pages=32–33, 207|isbn=0-521-65629-X|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Iceland===
[[File:Law speaker.jpg|right|thumb|19th century interpretation of the [[Althing]] in the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]], which authors such as [[David D. Friedman|David Friedman]] and [[Roderick Long]] believe to have some features of anarcho-capitalist society.]]
According to [[David D. Friedman|David Friedman]], "[[Icelandic Commonwealth|Medieval Icelandic institutions]] have several peculiar and interesting characteristics; they might almost have been invented by a mad economist to test the lengths to which market systems could supplant government in its most fundamental functions."&lt;ref name="Friedman-79"&gt;Friedman, David D. (1979) [http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Iceland/Iceland.html Private Creation and Enforcement of Law: A Historical Case]. Retrieved 12 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; While not directly labeling it anarcho-capitalist, he argues that the Icelandic Commonwealth between 930 and 1262 had "some features" of an anarcho-capitalist society&amp;nbsp;– while there was a single legal system, enforcement of law was entirely private and highly capitalist; and so provides some evidence of how such a society would function.  "Even where the Icelandic legal system recognized an essentially "public" offense, it dealt with it by giving some individual (in some cases chosen by lot from those affected) the right to pursue the case and collect the resulting fine, thus fitting it into an essentially private system."&lt;ref name="Friedman-79"/&gt;

===American Old West===
According to the research of [[Terry L. Anderson]] and P. J. Hill, the [[Old West]] in the United States in the period of 1830 to 1900 was similar to anarcho-capitalism in that "private agencies provided the necessary basis for an orderly society in which property was protected and conflicts were resolved," and that the common popular perception that the Old West was chaotic with little respect for property rights is incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Terry L. and Hill, P. J. [http://invisiblemolotov.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/wild-west3.pdf An American Experiment in Anarcho-Capitalism: The Not So Wild, Wild West], The Journal of Libertarian Studies&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[squatter]]s had no claim to western lands under federal law, extra-legal organizations formed to fill the void. Benson explains:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=To Serve and Protect: Privatization and Community in Criminal Justice|page=101|chapter=Private Justice in America|isbn=978-0-8147-1327-3|author=Benson, Bruce L.|year=1998|publisher=[[New York University Press]]|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The [[land club]]s and claim associations each adopted their own written contract setting out the laws that provided the means for defining and protecting property rights in the land. They established procedures for registration of land claims, as well as for protection of those claims against outsiders, and for adjudication of internal disputes that arose. The reciprocal arrangements for protection would be maintained only if a member complied with the association's rules and its court's rulings. Anyone who refused would be ostracized. Boycott by a land club meant that an individual had no protection against aggression other than what he could provide himself.}}
According to Anderson, "Defining anarcho-capitalist to mean minimal government with property rights developed from the bottom up, the western frontier was anarcho-capitalistic. People on the frontier invented institutions that fit the resource constraints they faced."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/grilling_terry_l_anderson_free_market_environmentalist/C39/L39/|title=Grilling Terry L.

===Post-Feudal Sicily===
The Mafia began in the 19th century.  Modern scholars believe that the seeds were planted in the upheaval of Sicily's transition out of [[feudalism]] beginning in 1812 and its later annexation by mainland Italy in 1860. Under feudalism, the nobility owned most of the land and enforced law and order through their private armies. After 1812, the feudal barons steadily sold off or rented their lands to private citizens. [[Primogeniture]] was abolished, land could no longer be seized to settle debts, and one fifth of the land became private property of the peasants.&lt;ref name=sardell&gt;Jason Sardell, [http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-031609-103313/unrestricted/JSardellMafia.pdf Economic Origins of the Mafia and Patronage System in Sicily], 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; After Italy annexed Sicily in 1860, it redistributed a large share of public and church land to private citizens. The result was a huge boom in landowners — from 2,000 in 1812 to 20,000 by 1861.&lt;ref name=bandiera&gt;[[Oriana Bandiera]], [http://econ.lse.ac.uk/staff/bandiera/mafia1101.pdf Private States and the Enforcement of Property Rights: Theory and evidence on the origins of the Sicilian mafia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319025549/http://econ.lse.ac.uk/staff/bandiera/mafia1101.pdf |date=2012-03-19 }}, 2001, pp. 8-10&lt;/ref&gt; With this increase in property owners and commerce came more disputes that needed settling, contracts that needed enforcing, transactions that needed oversight, and properties that needed protecting. The barons were releasing their private armies to let the state take over the job of enforcing the law, but the new authorities were not up to the task, largely due to their inexperience with capitalism.&lt;ref name=Gambetta1993p94&gt;{{harvp|Gambetta|1993|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of manpower was also a problem; there were often fewer than 350 active policemen for the entire island. Some towns did not have any permanent police force, only visited every few months by some troops to collect malcontents, leaving criminals to operate with impunity in the interim.&lt;ref&gt;D. Mack Smith. ''A History of Sicily: Modern Sicily, after 1713''. p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; Compounding these problems was banditry; rising food prices,&lt;ref name=bandiera/&gt; the loss of public and church lands,&lt;ref name=sardell/&gt; and the loss of feudal [[common rights|commons]] pushed many desperate peasants to steal. In the face of rising crime, booming commerce, and inefficient authorities, property owners turned to extralegal arbitrators and protectors.  These extralegal protectors eventually organized themselves into the first Mafia clans.

The '''Science and Technology Options Assessment (STOA)''' panel is a committee of members of the [[European Parliament]] devoted to all issues related to science and [[technology assessment]].

==Role==

STOA is an official organ of the [[European Parliament]], responsible for [[technology assessment]] and is active since 1987. Its task is to carry out expert, independent assessments of the impact of new technologies and identify long-term, strategic policy options useful to the Parliament's committees in their policy-making role.
STOA's work is carried out in partnership with external experts. These can be research institutes, universities, laboratories, consultancies or individual researchers contracted to help prepare specific projects. STOA increasingly focuses upon round-table expert discussions, conferences and workshops with associated or consequent studies. Members of Parliament (MEPs) and invited experts from EU institutions, international institutions, universities, specialist institutes, academies and other sources of expertise worldwide can jointly participate in the analysis of current issues at these events. 

The [[European Parliament]] defines its position on these issues through reports prepared by its Committees. If Committees decide that it would be helpful to their policy making role to seek out expert, independent assessments of the various scientific or technological options in the policy sectors concerned, they have STOA at their disposal: the Parliament's own Scientific and Technological Options Assessment unit.

==Organisation==
The STOA Panel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/stoa/cms/home/about/panel |title=STOA Panel |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is politically responsible for STOA's work. The STOA Panel consists of 15 Members of the European Parliament, namely the Vice-President of the Parliament responsible for STOA, four members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and two members from each of the Committees on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety; Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Employment and Social Affairs; Transport and Tourism; and Agriculture and Rural Development.
The STOA Bureau runs the activities of STOA and prepares the Panel meetings. The STOA Bureau is elected by the STOA Panel. 
Currently, the chairman is [[António Correia de Campos]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/96975/António%20Fernando_CORREIA%20DE%20CAMPOS.html António Correia de Campos, MEP and STOA Chair]&lt;/ref&gt; of Portugal.
The two Vice-Chairmen are [[Paul Rübig]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paulruebig.eu/ |title=Paul Rübig, MEP and STOA Vice-Chair |publisher=Paulruebig.eu |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Austria and [[Malcolm Harbour]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/4538/Malcolm_HARBOUR.html |title=Malcolm Harbour, MEP and STOA Vice-Chair |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the United Kingdom. The fourth member of the STOA Bureau is the Vice-President of the European Parliament responsible for STOA, Oldřich Vlasák.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/28323/Oldřich_VLASÁK.html Oldřich Vlasák, MEP, Vice-President of the European Parliament responsible for STOA]&lt;/ref&gt;
Former STOA Chairmen were [[Paul Rübig]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paulruebig.eu/ |title=Paul Rübig, MEP, STOA Vice-Chair, former STOA Chair |publisher=Paulruebig.eu |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philippe Busquin]], [[Rolf Linkohr]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/1258/ROLF_LINKOHR.html |title=Rolf Linkohr, former STOA Chair |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alain Pompidou]] and [[Antonios Trakatellis]].

Based upon the needs expressed by the different parliamentary committees, STOA provides the parliamentary bodies with independent, high-quality and impartial scientific information and studies. This helps them to assess the impact of the introduction or promotion of new technologies, and identify from a technological point of view, the best possible options for action. Plenty of studies are available so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/stoa/cms/home/publications/studies |title=STOA Studies, Final reports |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

STOA is member of the [[European Parliamentary Technology Assessment]] (EPTA) network.

== Annual STOA Lecture ==
To raise public awareness of and interest in science and technology issues, STOA hosts an Annual Lecture. The event features eminent scientists - often Nobel Prize laureates - speaking about subjects placed high on the political agenda, such as the information society, oil-free future, sustainability, advances in medical research, as well as major discoveries in fundamental science. The event is open to the public. [http://www.europarl.europa.eu/stoa/cms/home/workshops/annual_lectures]

The '''Sweet Track''' is an [[ancient trackway]], or [[causeway]] in the [[Somerset Levels]], England, named after its finder, Ray Sweet. It was built in 3807&amp;nbsp;BC and is the second-oldest [[timber trackway]] discovered in the British Isles, dating to the [[Neolithic British Isles|Neolithic]]. It is now known that the Sweet Track was predominantly built over the course of an earlier structure, the [[Post Track]].

The track extended across the now largely drained [[marsh]] between what was then an island at [[Westhay]] and a ridge of high ground at [[Shapwick, Somerset|Shapwick]], a distance close to {{convert|2000|m|ft}} or around 1.2 miles. The track is one of a network that once crossed the Somerset Levels. Various artifacts and prehistoric finds, including a [[jadeitite]] ceremonial axe head, have been found in the peat bogs along its length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/CD29F07E5335AC5B12F5670959B19A01/S0003598X00057987a.pdf/div-class-title-a-jade-axe-from-the-somerset-levels-div.pdf|title=Antiquity|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cambridge.org|access-date=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction was of crossed wooden poles, driven into the waterlogged soil to support a walkway that consisted mainly of planks of [[oak]], laid end-to-end. The track was used for a period of only around ten years and was then abandoned, probably due to rising water levels. Following its discovery in 1970, most of the track has been left in its original location, with active [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation]] measures taken, including a water pumping and distribution system to maintain the wood in its damp condition. Some of the track is stored at the [[British Museum]] and at the [[Museum of Somerset]] in Taunton. A reconstruction has been made on which visitors can walk, on the same line as the original in [[Shapwick Heath|Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve]].

==Location==
In the early [[4th millennium BC|fourth millennium BC]] the track was built between an island at [[Westhay]] and a ridge of high ground at [[Shapwick, Somerset|Shapwick]] close to the [[River Brue]]. A group of mounds at Westhay mark the site of [[Prehistoric Britain|prehistoric]] lake dwellings, which were likely to have been similar to those found in the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] [[Glastonbury Lake Village]] near [[Godney]], itself built on a [[marsh|morass]] on an artificial foundation of timber filled with brushwood, [[bracken]], rubble, and [[clay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunliffe|first=Barry|title=Iron Age Communities in Britain (4th Ed)|year=2005|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3lkEgdtOvGEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn=0-415-34779-3&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxon|isbn=978-0-415-34779-2|page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remains of similar tracks have been uncovered nearby, connecting settlements on the [[peat bog]]; they include the Honeygore, Abbotts Way, Bells, Bakers, Westhay, and Nidons trackways.&lt;ref name="digitaldigging"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sweet Track&amp;nbsp;– Somerset Levels|url=http://digitaldigging.co.uk/maps/trackways/prehistoric-sweet-track-somerset-levels.html|publisher=Digital Digging|accessdate=8 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305145358/http://digitaldigging.co.uk/maps/trackways/prehistoric-sweet-track-somerset-levels.html|archivedate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sites such as the nearby [[Meare Pool]] provide evidence that the purpose of these structures was to enable easier travel between the settlements. Investigation of the Meare Pool indicates that it was formed by the encroachment of [[raised bog|raised peat bogs]] around it, particularly during the [[Subatlantic]] climatic period (1st millennium BC), and [[core sample|core sampling]] demonstrates that it is filled with at least {{convert|2|m|ft}} of detritus mud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rippon|first=Stephen|year=2004|title=Making the Most of a Bad Situation?

The two [[Meare Lake Village]]s within Meare Pool appear to originate from a collection of structures erected on the surface of the dried peat, such as tents, windbreaks and animal folds. Clay was later spread over the peat, providing raised stands for occupation, industry and movement, and in some areas thicker clay spreads accommodated [[hearth]]s built of clay or stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chapmana|first1=Henry P.|last2=Van de Noort|first2=Robert|year=2001|title=High-Resolution Wetland Prospection, using GPS and GIS: Landscape Studies at Sutton Common (South Yorkshire), and Meare Village East (Somerset)|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=28|issue=4|pages=365–375|doi=10.1006/jasc.2000.0581|accessdate=11 July 2010|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WH8-45BT6MH-S&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=5d01004612f0220ca987f9ba64bf1175|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery and study==
The track was discovered in 1970 during [[peat]] excavations, and is named after its finder, Ray Sweet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Robin |last2=Williams |first2=Romey |title=The Somerset Levels|year=1992|pages=35–36|publisher=Ex Libris Press|location=Bradford on Avon|isbn=978-0-948578-38-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company for which he worked, E. J. Godwin, sent part of a plank from the track to John Coles, an assistant lecturer in archaeology at [[Cambridge University]], who had carried out some excavations on nearby trackways.&lt;ref name="brunning"/&gt; Coles' interest in the trackways led to the Somerset Levels Project, which ran from 1973 to 1989, funded by various donors including [[English Heritage]]. The project undertook a range of local archaeological activities, and established the economic and geographic significance of various trackways from the third and first millennia BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coles|first=J.M.|title=Effect of Man on the Landscape: The Lowland Zone|year=1978|publisher=Council for British Archaeology|isbn=978-0-900312-60-1|chapter-format=PDF|pages=86–89|chapter-url=http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/cba_rr/rr21.cfm|editor=Susan Limbrey|location=York|chapter=Man and landscape in the Somerset Levels|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003082045/http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/cba_rr/rr21.cfm|archivedate=3 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of John Coles, [[Bryony Coles]], and the Somerset Levels Project was recognised in 1996 when they won the [[Imperial Chemical Industries|Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI)]] Award for the best archaeological project offering a major contribution to knowledge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British Archaeological Awards|url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/awards/baa1998.html|publisher=Council for British Archeology|accessdate=17 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603093627/http://www.britarch.ac.uk/awards/baa1998.html|archivedate=3 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2006 with the European Archaeological Heritage Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Archaeological Heritage Prize 2006|url=http://www.e-a-a.org/EAA/Awards/Heritage_Prize/2006/EAA/Navigation_Prizes_and_Awards/Heritage_Prize_2006.aspx?hkey=e9a184bb-ef4b-4247-807d-7ea9ea84b375|publisher=European Association of Archaeologists|format=PDF|accessdate=17 June 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001201917/http://www.e-a-a.org/EAA/Awards/Heritage_Prize/2006/EAA/Navigation_Prizes_and_Awards/Heritage_Prize_2006.aspx?hkey=e9a184bb-ef4b-4247-807d-7ea9ea84b375|archivedate=1 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wood used to build the track is now classed as [[bog-wood]], the name given to wood (of any source) that for long periods (sometimes hundreds of thousands of years) has been buried in peat bogs, and kept from [[decomposition|decaying]] by the [[acid]]ic and [[hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] bog conditions. Bog-wood usually is stained brown by [[tannin]]s dissolved in the acidic water, and represents an early stage of [[fossil]]isation. The age of the track prompted large-scale excavations in 1973, funded by the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Department of the Environment]].&lt;ref name="brunning"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brunning|first=Richard|title=Somerset Archaeology: Papers to Mark 150 Years of the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society|year=2000|publisher=South West Heritage Trust|chapter-url=http://www1.somerset.gov.uk/archives/hes/downloads/HES_150_Years_Chapter_11.pdf|chapter-format=PDF|editor=CJ Webster|chapter=11.

A [[geophysical]] survey of the area in 2008 showed unclear [[magnetometer]] data; the wood may be influencing the peat's [[hydrology]], causing the loss or collection of minerals within the pore water and peat matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Armstrong|first1=K.|title=Archaeological geophysical prospection in peatland environments: Locating the Sweet Track at Canada Farm, Shapwick Heath (Somerset)|url=http://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/11145/1/armstrong_cheetham_abstract_v2_.pdf|work=EIGG 8th Meeting on Recent Work in Archaeological Geophysics, 16 Dec 2008, The Geological Society, Burlington House, London, UK.|format=PDF|publisher=Bournemouth University |accessdate=8 June 2010|last2=Cheetham|first2=P|year=2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719185241/http://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/11145/1/armstrong_cheetham_abstract_v2_.pdf|archivedate=19 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The community that constructed the trackway were Neolithic farmers who had colonised the area around 3900 BC, and the evidence suggests that they were, by the time of construction, well organised and settled.&lt;ref name="Costen"&gt;{{cite book|author=Costen, M.

Although the wood recovered from the Levels was visually intact, it was extremely degraded and very soft. Where possible, pieces of wood in good condition, or the worked ends of pegs, were taken away and conserved for later analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Coles|Coles|1986|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conservation process involved keeping the wood in heated tanks in a solution of [[polyethylene glycol]] and, by a process of evaporation, gradually replacing the water in the wood with the wax over a period of about nine months. After this treatment the wood was removed from the tank and wiped clean. As the wax cooled and hardened, the artefact became firm and could be handled freely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Coles|Coles|1986|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A section of the track on land owned by [[Fisons]] (who extracted peat from the area) was donated to the [[British Museum]] in London.&lt;ref name="bm"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/s/section_of_the_sweet_track.aspx|title=1986,1201.1–27 Sweet Track exhibition highlight|publisher=[[British Museum]]|accessdate=19 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429101940/https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/s/section_of_the_sweet_track.aspx|archivedate=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this short section can be assembled for display purposes, it is currently kept in store, off site, and under controlled conditions. A reconstructed section was displayed at the [[Peat Moors Centre]] near [[Glastonbury]]. The centre was run by the Somerset Historic Environment Service, but was closed in October 2009 as a result of budget cuts imposed by [[Somerset County Council]]. The main exhibits are extant, but future public access is uncertain. Other samples of the track are held in the [[Museum of Somerset]].&lt;ref name="digitaldigging"/&gt;

Sections of the track have been designated as a [[scheduled monument]],&lt;ref name="sshersweettrack"/&gt; meaning that it is a "nationally important" historic structure and [[archaeological site]] protected against unauthorised change.&lt;ref name="schedule"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scheduled monuments policy statement|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/scheduled-monuments-policy-statement|publisher=Gov.uk|accessdate=21 November 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122112341/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/scheduled-monuments-policy-statement|archivedate=22 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sections are also included in [[Historic England]]'s [[Heritage at Risk Register]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South West England|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/HAR_Register_South_West_2009/southwest-2009-har-register.pdf|work=Heritage at Risk|publisher=English Heritage|format=PDF|accessdate=30 June 2010|page=183|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609181327/http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/publications/HAR_Register_South_West_2009/southwest-2009-har-register.pdf|archivedate=9 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tainter gate''' is a type of radial arm [[floodgate]] used in [[dam]]s and [[canal lock]]s to control water flow.  It is named for [[Wisconsin]] [[structural engineer]] [[Jeremiah Burnham Tainter]].&lt;ref name="dunn"&gt;{{cite web
  | title=The Tainter Gate

  | url=http://discover-net.net/~dchs/history/exgate.html

  |archivedate=2006-02-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A side view of a Tainter gate resembles a slice of [[pie]] with the curved part of the piece facing the source or upper pool of water and the tip pointing toward the destination or lower pool. The curved face or skinplate of the gate takes the form of a wedge section of [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]].  The straight sides of the pie shape, the [[trunnion]] arms, extend back from each end of the cylinder section and meet at a trunnion which serves as a pivot point when the gate rotates.&lt;ref name="providence"&gt;{{cite web
 |title       = Fox Point Hurricane Barrier

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pressure forces acting on a submerged body act perpendicular to the body's surface.  The design of the Tainter gate results in every pressure force acting through the centre of the imaginary circle of which the gate is a section, so that all resulting pressure force acts through the pivot point of the gate, making construction and design easier.

When a Tainter gate is closed, water bears on the convex (upstream) side. When the gate is rotated, the rush of water passing under the gate helps to open and close the gate. The rounded face, long radial arms and [[trunnion|trunnion bearings]] allow it to close with less effort than a flat gate. Tainter gates are usually controlled from above with a chain/gearbox/[[electric motor]] assembly.

A critical factor in Tainter gate design is the amount of stress transferred from the skinplate through the radial arms and to the trunnion, with calculations pertaining to the resulting friction encountered when raising or lowering the gate. Some older systems have had to be modified to allow for [[friction|frictional forces]] which the original design did not anticipate.&lt;ref name="tuttle"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tainter gate is used in water control dams and locks worldwide.  The [[Upper Mississippi River]] basin alone has 321 Tainter gates, and the [[Columbia River]] basin has 195. A Tainter gate is also used to divert the flow of water to San Fernando Power Plant on the [[Los Angeles Aqueduct]].&lt;ref name="dunn"/&gt; The Tainter gate was invented and first implemented in [[Menomonie, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name="dunn" /&gt;

'''''The Great Theatre of Dutch Painters''''', or ''De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen'', as it was originally known in Dutch, is a series of artist biographies with engraved portraits written by the 18th-century painter [[Arnold Houbraken]]. It was published in three volumes as a sequel to [[Karel van Mander]]'s own list of biographies known as the ''[[Schilder-boeck]]''. The first volume appeared in 1718, and was followed by the second volume in 1719, the year Houbraken died. The third and last volume was published posthumously by Houbraken's wife and children in 1721. This work is considered to be a very important source of information on 17th-century artists of the Netherlands. The ''Schouburg'' is listed as one of the 1000 most important works in the [[Canon of Dutch Literature]] from the Middle Ages to today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/basisbibliotheek/index.php?c=17 Website of the ''Basic Library'' of the dbnl, the section on the Golden Age] (in Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and influence==
The ''Schouburg'' was not the first sequel to Karel van Mander's work. Various authors had attempted to illustrate Van Mander's work and in 1649, [[Jan Meyssen]] published ''Image de divers hommes'' in imitation of [[Van Dyck|Anthony van Dyck]]'s ''Iconography''. [[Cornelis de Bie]] published his ''[[Het Gulden Cabinet]]'' in 1662, [[André Félibien]] published his ''Entretiens sur les vies et sur les ouvrages des plus excellents peintres anciens et modernes'' in 1666, and these were followed by [[Jacob von Sandrart]]'s illustrated ''Teutsche Akademie'' in 1668. Houbraken was very familiar with ''Inleyding tot de Hooge Schoole der Schilderkonst'', 1678, published by his teacher [[Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten|Samuel van Hoogstraten]] for students of art. [[Roger de Piles]] published ''L'Abrégé de la vie des peintres'' in the 1690s followed by [[Florent le Comte]] with his ''Cabinet des singularitez'' in 1699. As a gifted engraver, Houbraken wished to correct mistakes and omissions in these earlier works, while updating biographies with engraved portraits of artists. All of these works were used as sources for Houbraken and he mentions them in the first chapter of his first volume.

The ''Schouburg'' was published in three volumes, the first of which was simply meant as an addendum to Karel van Mander's work, and listed about 200 artists born between 1466 (starting with [[Erasmus]]) and 1613 (ending with [[Jacques van Artois]]) that had been omitted or whose lives extended beyond Van Mander's 1604 publication date. The popularity of this volume was such that a second volume was prepared immediately, while plans were made to continue the project up to the period in which Houbraken was writing at the start of the 18th century.

While leaning heavily on the sources already mentioned, Houbraken also consulted local history books of various cities in the Netherlands. Other, unpublished sources for his material came from various contacts via his professional network, mostly members of [[Guild of St. Luke|St. Luke Guilds]] in Holland. He listed many men who became members of the [[Bentvueghels]] group in [[Rome]] while on their [[Grand Tour]], but he also listed most of the men in a competency list drawn up by [[Vincent van der Vinne]] before he died in 1702. Houbraken kept to a system of importance where capitals meant very important, and lower case were honorable mentions. Though the capitalized names were meant for the index, the index of the first volume was far from complete at the time of publication. A later edition of all three books in 1756 contains an improved index and this book is now available on line in the [[Digital library for Dutch literature]].

===Notable omissions===
The absence from Houbraken's work of several painters who are now much more highly regarded than very many painters he considered noteworthy, is an interesting feature of the work, and reveals changes in taste since his time; the most notorious omission is [[Jan Vermeer]], who is mentioned once in passing.  One must not forget however, that Houbraken himself died before publishing the final work, and he mentions again and again the impossibility of a complete list. In his first volume he includes painters that he complained were oversights by Karel van Mander, who he regarded as his greatest example. He highly respected all artist biographers who came before him, such as Sandrart, de Bie, and de Lairesse. In fact, Houbraken was quite keen to include painters that he thought were overlooked before him, and was quite thorough in his endeavors. Therefore, his omissions are equally the omissions of previous biographers, though it is Houbraken who receives all the blame. Unfortunately we don't know the exact state of his book at the time of his death, but his son Jacob, his daughter Antonina, and his wife all helped to patch things up for publication, and it is quite possible that their own opinions slipped into the finished work. In general, Houbraken tends to follow the contemporary prejudices of the [[hierarchy of genres]] and undervalue [[landscapist]]s, [[marine artist]]s and painters of [[still life]]. One can also speak of certain prejudices of the Houbraken family. These were in order:

* '''Family dynasties''': All painters who made up a family dynasty received extra space in the book. More space was given to the founder of the dynasty than to any other member (note that Houbraken considered himself the founder of his own family dynasty). An example is that though [[Rachel Ruysch]] was the most famous painter of her family, Houbraken devotes more space to her grandfather Pieter Post and his brother Frans. Similarly, though [[Wouter Crabeth II]] was the most famous painter of the family, Houbraken devotes more space to his illustrious heritage in Gouda, the glass painters Dirk and Wouter.
* '''Engravers''': Houbraken had a business of his own in biographical engravings, and his large family probably all helped in the business, with his son and daughter helping with the oval portraits. Houbraken was quick to realize the importance of reprints, and used them whenever possible for art provenance. He highly respected good engravings. Therefore he was heavily prejudiced towards artists who were also good draftsmen and engravers, such as Rembrandt and the Visschers. He includes also notes about various publishers and engravers, who did not paint at all.
* '''Rome''': Houbraken had great respect for all artists who took the trouble and overcame many hardships to travel to Rome. He went to great pains to add entries for the entire list of painters mentioned in a poem about the [[Bentvueghels]].
* '''Flattery''': As a Mennonite, Houbraken would have been against flattery; however, he writes again and again of the importance of flattering one's patrons in his books, and a recurring theme is when an artist fell onto bad times because he failed to flatter his patron. This type of artist is admired by Houbraken as a sort of "martyr to the artist's cause". Examples of flatterers that Houbraken deprecates are Anthony van Dyck  and Sir Peter Lely followers, and his omissions speak for themselves if we note famous portrait painters of his day such as [[Adriaen Hanneman]], [[Johannes Cornelisz Verspronck]] and [[Thomas de Keyser]]. Similarly, though architecture was considered one of the highest genre's, the popular "family portrait with a view of the house or garden" was omitted as a genre entirely from Houbraken's praise, since this just showed off the wealth of the sitters. Thus landscape-portraitists were often omitted or deprecated, such as [[Hendrik van Steenwijk II]] and his wife.
* '''Religion''': Certainly Houbraken included artists of all religions in his book, but we can say that Mennonites are over-represented (see his story on the Mennonite martyr [[Jan Woutersz van Cuyck]]), while Catholics are under-represented. These were the De Grebbers, the De Brays, the Ruisdael family, Jan Vermeer, [[Adriaen Coorte]], Adriaen Hanneman, Johannes Cornelisz Verspronck, [[Hendrick Dubbels]], [[Pieter Anthonisz. van Groenewegen]], [[Meindert Hobbema]], and others.

Other notorious omissions are [[Jan van de Cappelle]], [[Judith Leyster]], [[Jan Wynants]], [[Jacobus Mancadan]],  [[Hendrick Avercamp]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Vermeer, Ruysch, and Leyster were mentioned, but only briefly.  The subject is dealt with in ''Arnold Houbraken's "Groote Schouburgh" and the Canon of Seventeenth-Century Dutch Painting'', by Bart Cornelis, Simiolus: Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art, Vol. 26, No. 3 (1998), pp. 144-161, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3780895 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schilderessen==
Translated, the title of the book is ''Theatre of Painters and Paintresses'', indicating that Houbraken wrote about women painters, or ''schilderessen''. However, the list of women he included in the book is really quite short. Though he included short biographies of very many painters who were closely related to women painters, the only paintresses he included by name were: [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], [[Anna Francisca de Bruijns]], [[Mayken Verhulst]], [[Anna Maria van Schurman]], [[Margaretha van Godewijk]], [[Maria de Grebber]] (sister of [[Pieter de Grebber]]), [[Maria Potter]], [[Alida Withoos]], [[Catharina Oostfries]] (from a glaspainting family, married glasspainter [[Claes van der Meulen]]), [[Maria van Oosterwijk]], [[Geertgen Wyntges]] (who he mentions as being the servant of Maria van Oosterwijk), [[Anna Katrina]], [[Catharina Rozee]] (1632–82), [[Adriana Spilberg]] (daughter of [[Johannes Spilberg]]), [[Rachel Ruysch]], the three sisters [[Anna Maria van Thielen]], [[Françoise Katharina van Thielen]], and [[Maria Theresa van Thielen]], [[Marie Duchatel]], [[Diana Glauber]], [[Maria Sybilla Merian]], [[Margaretha Wulfraet]], and [[Johanna Koerten Blok]]. Of these, he included illustrations of only three women: Schurman, Merian, and Koerten-Blok. Houbraken also mentioned two poetesses; [[Gesina Brit]] and [[Catharina Questiers]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7809">A '''tronie''' (16/17th-century [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for "face") is a common type, or group of types, of works common in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and [[Flemish Baroque painting]] that shows an exaggerated [[facial expression]] or a [[stock character]] in costume.

==Definition==
[[File:Joos van Craesbeeck - The Smoker.jpg|thumb|right|270px|upright|[[Joos van Craesbeeck]]'s ''The Smoker'', an example of a "tronie"]]
The term 'tronie' is not clearly defined in art historical literature. Literary and archival sources show that initially the term 'tronie' was not always associated with people. Inventories sometimes referred to flower and fruit still lifes as 'tronies'.  More common was the meaning of face or visage. Often the term referred to the entire head, even a bust, and in exceptional cases the whole body. A tronie could be two-dimensional, but also made of plaster or stone. Sometimes a tronie was a likeness, the depiction of an individual, including the face of God, Christ, Mary, a saint or an angel.  In particular a tronie denoted the characteristic appearance of the head of a type, for example a farmer, a beggar or a jester. Tronie sometimes meant so much as a grotesque head or a model such as the type of an ugly old person.  When conceived as the face of an individual and of a type a tronie's aim was to express feelings and character in an accurate manner and must therefore be expressive.&lt;ref name=tronie&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_zev001200101_01/_zev001200101_01_0017.php Jan Muylle, ''Tronies toegeschreven aan Pieter Bruegel''], in: De zeventiende eeuw. Jaargang 17. Uitgeverij Verloren, Hilversum 2001, p. 174-203 {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern art-historical usage the term tronie is typically restricted to figures not intended to depict an identifiable person, so it is a form of [[genre painting]] in a portrait format.  Typically a painted head or bust only, if concentrating on the facial expression, but often half-length when featured in an exotic costume, tronies might be based on studies from life or use the features of actual sitters.  The picture was typically sold on the art market without identification of the sitter, and was not commissioned and retained by the sitter as [[portrait]]s normally were.  Similar unidentified figures treated as [[history painting]]s would normally be given a title from the classical world, for example the Rembrandt painting now known as ''Saskia as Flora''.

==History==
The genre started in the Low Countries in the 16th century where it was likely inspired by some of the grotesque heads drawn by Leonardo.  Leonardo had pioneered drawings of paired grotesque heads whereby two heads, usually in profile, were placed opposite each other in order to accentuate their diversity.  This paired juxtaposition was also adopted by artists in the Low Countries.  In 1564 or 1565 Joannes and Lucas van Doetecum are believed to have engraved 72 heads attributed to [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] that followed this paired arrangement.&lt;ref name=tronie/&gt;

This paired model was still being used by some artists in the 17th century.  For instance, the Flemish artist [[Jan van de Venne]] who was active in the first half of the 17th century painted a number of tronies juxtaposing different faces.

File:Jan van der Venne - Head of an old woman.jpg|Jan van de Venne, ''Head of an old woman''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Several [[Rembrandt]] [[self-portrait]] [[etching]]s are tronies, as are paintings of himself, his son and his wives. &lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;This is true of modern art-historical terminology; however, historical usage is not so precise. Seventeenth-century Dutch and Flemish inventories of paintings might use the term for any unidentified sitter.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;  Three [[Vermeer]] paintings were described as "tronies" in the [[Jacob Dissius|Dissius]] auction of 1696, perhaps including the ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' and the Washington ''[[:File:Johannes Vermeer - Young Girl with a Flute - WGA24683.jpg|Young Girl with a flute]]''.  [[Frans Hals]] also painted a number of tronies, which are now among his best-known works, including the two tronies known as ''[[Malle Babbe]]'' and the ''[[The Gypsy Girl - Malle Babbe|Gypsy Girl]]'' (see gallery).

[[Adriaen Brouwer]] was one of the most successful practitioners of the genre as he had a talent for expressiveness. His work gave a face to lower-class figures by infusing their images with recognizable and vividly expressed human emotions—anger, joy, pain, and pleasure.   His ''Youth Making a Face'' (c. 1632/1635, [[National Gallery of Art]]) shows a young man with a satirical and mocking gesture which humanises him, however uninviting he may appear. Brouwer's vigorous application of paint in this composition, with his characteristically short, unmodulated brushstrokes, increases the dramatic effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.86204.html Brouwer, Adriaen, ''Youth Making a Face''] at the [[National Gallery of Art]]&lt;/ref&gt;   Genre painters often returned to the old theme of the allegory of the five senses and created series of tronies depicting the five senses. Examples are  [[Lucas Franchoys the Younger]]'s ''A man removing a plaster, the sense of touch'' and [[Joos van Craesbeeck]]'s ''The Smoker'' which represents taste.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.wellcomelibrary.org/record=b1202823 ''A man removing a plaster, the sense of touch'' by [[Lucas Franchoys the Younger]]] at the [[Wellcome Library]], London&lt;/ref&gt;

The tronie is related to, and has some overlap with, the "portrait historié", a portrait of a real person '''as''' another, usually historical or [[mythological]], figure. [[Jan de Bray]] specialised in these, and many portraitists sometimes showed aristocratic ladies in particular as mythological figures.

&lt;!--Technology, platforms, etc--&gt;
At the conference Indonesia published its [[Vessel monitoring system]] (VMS) publicly revealing the location and activity of its commercial fishing boats on the [[Global Fishing Watch]] public mapping platform.&lt;ref name=phys1&gt;{{cite web|title=Indonesia makes its fishing fleet visible to the world through Global Fishing Watch|url=https://phys.org/news/2017-06-indonesia-fishing-fleet-visible-world.html|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Sullivan (Google)|Brian Sullivan]] states that the platform is can easily incorporate additional data sources which may allow "mov[ing] from raw data to quickly producing dynamic visualizations and reporting that promote scientific discovery and support policies for better [[Fisheries management|fishery management]]".&lt;ref name=phys1/&gt;

&lt;!--Science, research, etc--&gt;
Irina Bokova of [[UNESCO]] notes that "we cannot manage what we cannot measure, and no single country is able to measure the myriad changes taking place in the ocean", and asks for more [[Oceanography|maritime research]] and the [[knowledge sharing|sharing of knowledge]] to craft common [[evidence-based policy|science-based policies]].&lt;ref name=xinhuanet1/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

UN Secretary-General [[António Guterres]] warned that unless nations overcome short-term territorial and resource interests the state of the oceans will continue to deteriorate.

&lt;!--India--&gt;
India, attended indirectly via two non-governmental organisations&lt;ref name=hindu1/&gt; until 9 June when Minister of State for External Affairs [[M J Akbar]] told the conference that the negative impact of overfishing, habitat destruction, pollution and climate change are becoming increasingly clear and that the time for action would be "already long overdue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Don't turn seas into areas of conflict, says MJ Akbar at United Nations Ocean Conference|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/dont-turn-seas-into-areas-of-conflict-says-mj-akbar-at-united-nations-ocean-conference-3534035.html|publisher=Firstpost|accessdate=9 June 2017|date=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do Not Turn Seas into Areas of Conflict: MJ Akbar|url=http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/do-not-turn-seas-into-areas-of-conflict-mj-akbar-1709938|publisher=NDTV|accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--US--&gt;
Bolivia's President [[Evo Morales]] told the conference that, one of the world's main polluters, the [[government of the United States|United States]] denied science, turned its backs on multilateralism, and attempted to deny a future to upcoming generations by its national government deciding to [[United States withdrawal from the Paris Agreement|leave the Paris agreement]], making "it the main threat to Mother Earth and life itself".&lt;ref name=aljazeera1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Papenfuss|first1=Mary|title=U.S. Lashed As 'Main Threat' To Environment at UN Ocean Conference|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-main-environmental-threat-united-nations_us_593618e4e4b0099e7faeaac2|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=6 June 2017|date=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wash1/&gt;&lt;ref name=chicagotribune1/&gt;&lt;ref name=townhall1/&gt; [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco]] called Trump's withdrawal "catastrophic" and the reaction from US mayors, governors and many in the corporate world as "wonderful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monaco's ruler: Trump should listen to scientists on climate|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/monacos-ruler-trump-should-listen-to-scientists-on-climate/2017/06/07/3eeca946-4bce-11e7-987c-42ab5745db2e_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 May Sweden's deputy prime minister [[Isabella Lövin]] stated that the United States is resisting plans to highlight how climate change is disrupting life in the oceans at the conference, that the US has negatively affected preparations and that "the decline of the oceans is really a threat to the entire planet" with a "need to start working together".&lt;ref name=reuters1&gt;{{cite web|title=INTERVIEW-US resists plan to link climate change, ocean health-UN co-chair|url=http://news.trust.org/item/20170530150853-6bg97|publisher=Thomson Reuters Foundation|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. resists plan to link climate change, ocean health: U.N. co-chair|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/r-us-resists-plan-to-link-climate-change-ocean-health-un-co-chair-2017-5?IR=T|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=9 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovin also makes note of difficulties to engage with Washington in the conference, partly because key posts at the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] remain unfilled since the end of the Obama administration.&lt;ref name=reuters1/&gt;

&lt;!--Subsidies--&gt;
UNCTAD Secretary-General [[Mukhisa Kituyi]] states that [[subsidies]] from wealthy governments encourage overfishing, overcapacity and may contribute to [[Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing|illegal and unregulated fishing]], creating [[food insecurity]], unemployment and poverty for people relying mainly on fish as their primary source of nourishment or livelihood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNCTAD and other global influencers gather to discuss eliminating harmful fisheries subsidies at UN Ocean Conference|url=http://unctad.org/en/pages/newsdetails.aspx?OriginalVersionID=1494|accessdate=7 June 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact and progress==&lt;!--/continuation/...--&gt;
&lt;!--Requires not just UN--&gt;
[[Marine biologist]] Ayana Elizabeth Johnson notes that the UN's work alone is not nearly enough and that for a solution to this existential crisis of the health of our global environment, strong and inspired leadership at all levels – from mayors, to governors, CEOs, scientists, artists and presidents is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Ayana Elizabeth|title=Climate, Oceans, the United Nations, and What's Next|url=http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2017/06/02/climate-oceans-the-united-nations-and-whats-next/|website=National Geographic Society (blogs)|accessdate=6 June 2017|date=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Goals and how much of it has been achieved etc--&gt;
In 2010 the international community agreed to protect 10% of the ocean by 2020 in the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]'s Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020 and Sustainable
Development Goal 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marine Protected Areas and climate change|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2016-067.pdf|accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global marine protected are a target of 10% to be achieved by 2020|url=https://www.cbd.int/doc/press/2017/pr-2017-06-05-mpa-pub-en.pdf|accessdate=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However as of June 2017 less than 3% of the ocean are under some form of protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mittler|first1=Daniel|title=Time for ocean action – for us, our climate and diversity on earth|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/time-for-ocean-action-for-us-our-climate-and-diversity_us_59382a87e4b0b65670e566c6|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=9 June 2017|date=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pledges made during the conference would add around an additional 4.4 percent of protected marine areas,&lt;ref name=indianexpress1/&gt; increasing the protected total to around 7.4% of the ocean.

&lt;!--Organizers' résumé--&gt;
Peter Thomson called the conference was a success, stating that he was "satisfied with [its] results", that the conference "held at a very critical time" has "turned the tide on [[marine pollution]]". He says that "we are now working around the world to restore a relationship of balance and respect towards the ocean".&lt;ref name=unn1/&gt;&lt;ref name=xin1/&gt;

&lt;!--Procedure from there--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1033">The '''universal relation assumption''' in [[relational databases]] states, that one can place all data attributes into a (possibly very wide) table, which may then be decomposed into smaller tables as needed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Igor Hawryszkiewycz|I. T. Hawryszkiewycz]], ''Database analysis and design,'' 1984. {{ISBN|0-574-21485-2}}, pages 59-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the assumption that a single large table can capture real database designs is often plagued with a number of difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Carlo Zaniolo, ''Advances in database technology--EDBT 2000,'' 2000. {{ISBN|3-540-67227-3}}, page 276&lt;/ref&gt; The "nested universal relation" model has attempted to address some of the problems and offer improvements.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Levene, ''The nested universal relation database model,'' 2000. {{ISBN|3-540-55493-9}}, pages 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Woman on top''', also called the '''cowgirl''' or '''riding''' position, is a group of [[sex position]]s in which a man lies on his back or sits, a woman straddles him facing either forward or back, and the man [[sexual penetration|inserts]] his erect [[Human penis|penis]] into the woman's [[vagina]] or [[Human anus|anus]].&lt;ref name="discovery"&gt;[http://healthguide.howstuffworks.com/sexual-positions-dictionary2.htm "Discovery Health Sexual Positions"]. ''healthguide.howstuffworks.com''. Retrieved 2010-10-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cowgirl name derives from the image of the receiving partner "riding" the partner as a [[cowgirl]] rides a bucking horse. It is one of a number of receptive-partner-superior sexual positions, another being the [[#Reverse cowgirl position|reverse cowgirl]] position. It is fairly simple to achieve and maintain and pleasures both partners. This position is also used as a precursor to the [[lateral coital position]] described by [[Masters and Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=Little Brown and Company|edition=1st|year=June 1970|isbn=0-316-54985-1|title=Human Sexual Inadequacy|last=Masters|first=Johnson|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This position is commonly cited as one of the more popular sex positions, especially by women, because of its ability to adequately stimulate the [[clitoris]]. In this position, the woman is usually the active partner during the sexual activity.

==Cowgirl position==
In the cowgirl position, the man lies on his back or sits, with the woman straddling him across his pelvis facing forward, either in a [[kneeling]] or [[squatting position|squatting]] position. The woman will align her [[vagina]] with the man's erect [[penis]], and lower herself onto the penis with either the man or the woman guiding the penis into the woman's vagina for [[sexual penetration|penetration]].&lt;ref name="discovery" /&gt; With the erect penis inside the woman, the woman can glide up and down the man's penis,&lt;ref name="Kar"&gt;{{cite book |authors=Nilamadhab Kar, Gopal Chandra Kar| title = Comprehensive Textbook of Sexual Medicine | publisher = [[Jaypee Brothers| Jaypee Brothers Publishers]]|pages=108–109| isbn = 8180614050|year=2005| accessdate = February 10, 2014 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=YxcjMPbGHQIC&amp;pg=PA108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=everydayhealth&gt;[http://www.everydayhealth.com/sexual-health/sexual-positions.aspx "Sex Positions For Better Sex"]. Retrieved 2010-10-22.&lt;/ref&gt; controlling the rhythm and pace of vaginal stimulation and the extent and duration of penetration.&lt;ref name="discovery"/&gt; The woman is free to change her position ranging from leaning back to stretching out on her partner's chest to rocking from side to side or in a circular motion. Each of those changes would alter the angle and depth of penetration and which part of the vaginal area and sex organs are stimulated. The man's hands are free to reach and touch the woman's breasts, clitoris, buttocks, face etc.,&lt;ref name="Kar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="everydayhealth"/&gt; and the partners can maintain eye contact. With the woman in the sitting or leaning back positions, the man may also [[Stimulation of nipples|stimulate her nipples]] and [[clitoral stimulation|clitoris]] with his fingers, or suck on her nipples if she inclines towards him or he raises his torso towards her.

In this position a woman can continue with the up and down motion after the man has achieved orgasm until she reaches orgasm. Afterwards, she may collapse onto the man's chest, with her vagina being very sensitive to further stimulation. On the other hand, if the woman reaches orgasm before the man, the woman may raise her pelvis to enable the man to actively thrust upwards&lt;ref name="Kar" /&gt; or the couple may change to a position which enables the man to continue thrusting, such as the [[missionary position]].

A woman may also engage in [[Pegging (sexual practice)|pegging]] (penetrating a man with a [[strap-on dildo]]) while being on top.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.esquire.com/uk/life/sex-relationships/news/a11943/a-guide-to-pegging/ Why All Men Should Try Pegging]. Esquire. Retrieved 2018-08-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reverse missionary position==
[[File:PeterJohannNepomukGeigerEroticWatercolor06.jpg|thumb|Depiction of reverse missionary position by [[Johann Nepomuk Geiger]] (1840)]]
When the woman lies on her partner's chest, a better description is the '''reverse missionary position'''. Stretching out with her legs on the man&lt;ref name="Kar" /&gt; puts more pressure on the woman's [[mons pubis]] and clitoris. If the man separates his legs, the woman can put her legs between his.&lt;ref name="Kar" /&gt; In this position she can increase the tightness on the man's penis by pressing her thighs together, or the man may press the woman's thighs together. This increases vaginal friction but she can still control the pace and rhythm of her thrusts. As most women approach orgasm, they experience acute [[vaginal contraction]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8174183 |year=1994 |last1=Kratochvíl |first1=S |title=Vaginal contractions in female orgasm |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=28–33 |journal=Československá psychiatrie}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also increases the man's sexual stimulation by increasing tightness on his penis.

==Reverse cowgirl position==
[[File:Michael Zichy-love1.jpg|thumb|Depiction of reverse cowgirl position by [[Mihály Zichy]] (around 1911)]]
In the '''reverse cowgirl''' position, the woman straddles the man facing the man's feet in a [[kneeling]] or [[squatting position|squatting]] position. After either she or the man has guided the penis into the woman's vagina, the woman can keep her torso upright, or she can lean forward or back to lie on the man's chest or move sideways at will. The man's legs can be flat on the bed or arched. The woman also has control over the pace, rhythm, depth and duration of penetration. By changing her position and thrusts, the woman can change the level of stimulation for the man, while simultaneously stimulating her clitoris or an area termed "the [[G-spot]]." When planting her feet instead of kneeling, still facing away from her partner, the position is known as Reverse Asian Cowgirl.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sexinfo101.com/reverseasiancowgirl.shtml Reverse Asian Cowgirl Sex Position] Sexinfo101.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantage==
An advantage of the woman on top positions is that the man's weight is not on the woman. The woman on top positions are ideal during pregnancy as there is no pressure on the woman's abdomen, and it is easy for her to control the depth and speed of penetration. It is also useful if the man is recovering from a serious illness or surgery or if the woman has recently given birth.&lt;ref name="Kar" /&gt;

==Comparison to the cowboy position==
The '''cowboy position''' is the equivalent for sex wherein the man is being penetrated; in the [[LGBT community]], the major difference is that it is usually anal sex in which the [[Top, bottom and versatile#Bottom|bottom]] straddles the [[Top, bottom and versatile#Top|top]], who otherwise assumes the same role as the male does in the cowgirl position.&lt;ref&gt; [http://vadamagazine.com/features/vada-that/vada-guide-anal-sex-men The Vada Guide to Anal Sex for Men] Vada Magazine. Retrieved 2018-08-27.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to sharing many of the same advantages as the cowgirl variant, the position is often cited as being advantageous for bottoms who are new to anal sex, as it allows the receiving partner to lower himself on to the other's penis at his own pace.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/04/11/gay-sex-positions/ Pink News Explainer: The Best Gay Sex Positions] Pink News.
