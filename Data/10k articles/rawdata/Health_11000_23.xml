&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Asbestosis''' is long term [[inflammation]] and [[pulmonary fibrosis|scarring]] of the [[human lung|lung]]s due to [[asbestos]].&lt;ref name=Mer2013/&gt; Symptoms may include [[shortness of breath]], cough, [[wheezing]], and [[chest pain]].&lt;ref name=NHS2017Int&gt;{{cite web|title=Asbestosis symptoms and treatments|url=https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/lungs-and-airways/asbestosis|website=NHS Inform|accessdate=19 December 2017|date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complications may include [[lung cancer]], [[mesothelioma]], and [[pulmonary heart disease]].&lt;ref name=NHS2017Int/&gt;&lt;ref name=EU2009&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/123072/AQG2ndEd_6_2_asbestos.PDF |title=World Health Organization.

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Asbestosis is caused by [[inhalation|breathing in]] asbestos fibers.&lt;ref name=NHS2017Int/&gt; Generally it requires a relatively large exposure over a long period of time.&lt;ref name=NHS2017Int/&gt; Such levels of exposure typically only occur in those who work with the material.&lt;ref name=EU2009/&gt; All types of asbestos fibers are associated with concerns.&lt;ref name=NHS2017Ca&gt;{{cite web|title=Asbestosis symptoms and treatments|url=https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/lungs-and-airways/asbestosis#causes|website=NHS Inform|accessdate=19 December 2017|date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally recommended that currently existing asbestos be left undisturbed.&lt;ref name=NHS2017Pre&gt;{{cite web|title=Asbestosis symptoms and treatments|url=https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/lungs-and-airways/asbestosis#prevention|website=NHS Inform|accessdate=19 December 2017|date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnosis is based upon a history of exposure together with [[medical imaging]].&lt;ref name=Mer2013/&gt; Asbestosis is a type of [[interstitial pulmonary fibrosis]].&lt;ref name=Mer2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Asbestosis - Pulmonary Disorders|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/en-ca/professional/pulmonary-disorders/environmental-pulmonary-diseases/asbestosis|website=Merck Manuals Professional Edition|accessdate=19 December 2017|language=en-CA|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and epidemiology --&gt;
There is no specific treatment.&lt;ref name=NHS2017Int/&gt; Recommendations may include [[influenza vaccination]], [[pneumococcal vaccination]], [[oxygen therapy]], and stopping [[smoking]].&lt;ref name=NIH2017Tx&gt;{{cite web|title=Asbestosis symptoms and treatments|url=https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/lungs-and-airways/asbestosis#treatment|website=NHS Inform|accessdate=19 December 2017|date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asbestosis affected about 157,000 people and resulted in 3,600 deaths in 2015.&lt;ref name=GBD2015De&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2015 Mortality and Causes of Death|first1=Collaborators.|title=Global, regional, and national life expectancy, all-cause mortality, and cause-specific mortality for 249 causes of death, 1980-2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015.|journal=Lancet|date=8 October 2016|volume=388|issue=10053|pages=1459–1544|pmid=27733281|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(16)31012-1|pmc=5388903}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GBD2015Pre&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2015 Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence|first1=Collaborators.|title=Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 310 diseases and injuries, 1990-2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015.|journal=Lancet|date=8 October 2016|volume=388|issue=10053|pages=1545–1602|pmid=27733282|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31678-6|pmc=5055577}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asbestos use has been banned in a number of countries in an effort to prevent disease.&lt;ref name=NHS2017Int/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
The signs and symptoms of asbestosis typically manifest after a significant amount of time has passed following asbestos exposure, often several decades under current conditions in the US.&lt;ref name="ATS 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author=American Thoracic Society |title=Diagnosis and initial management of nonmalignant diseases related to asbestos |journal=Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. |volume=170 |issue=6 |pages=691–715 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15355871 |doi=10.1164/rccm.200310-1436ST |url=http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15355871}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary symptom of asbestosis is generally the slow onset of [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]], especially with physical activity.&lt;ref name="Roggli1"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sporn, Thomas A |author2=Roggli, Victor L. |author3=Oury, Tim D |title=Pathology of asbestos-associated diseases |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2004 |isbn=0-387-20090-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinically advanced cases of asbestosis may lead to [[respiratory failure]]. When a [[physician]] listens with a stethoscope to the lungs of a person with asbestosis, they may hear inspiratory [[crackles]].

The characteristic pulmonary function finding in asbestosis is a restrictive ventilatory defect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miller A, Lilis R, Godbold J, Chan E, Selikoff IJ |title=Relationship of pulmonary function to radiographic interstitial fibrosis in 2,611 long-term asbestos insulators.

The TLC may be reduced through alveolar wall thickening; however, this is not always the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kilburn KH, Warshaw RH |title=Airways obstruction from asbestos exposure. Effects of asbestosis and smoking |journal=Chest |volume=106 |issue=4 |pages=1061–70 |date=October 1994 |pmid=7924474 |url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7924474 |doi=10.1378/chest.106.4.1061}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Large airway function, as reflected by FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/FVC, is generally well preserved.&lt;ref name="ATS 2004"/&gt;  In severe cases, the drastic reduction in lung function due to the stiffening of the lungs and reduced TLC may induce right-sided heart failure ([[cor pulmonale]]).&lt;ref name="Roggli2"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roggli VL, Sanders LL |title=Asbestos content of lung tissue and carcinoma of the lung: a clinicopathologic correlation and mineral fiber analysis of 234 cases |journal=Ann Occup Hyg |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=109–17 |year=2000 |pmid=10717262 |url=http://annhyg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10717262 |doi=10.1016/s0003-4878(99)00067-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burdorf2"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Burdorf A, Swuste P |title=An expert system for the evaluation of historical asbestos exposure as diagnostic criterion in asbestos-related diseases |journal=Ann Occup Hyg |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=57–66 |year=1999 |pmid=10028894 |url=http://annhyg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10028894 |doi=10.1093/annhyg/43.1.57}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to a restrictive defect, asbestosis may produce reduction in [[diffusing capacity|diffusion capacity]] and a [[hypoxemia|low amount of oxygen]] in the blood of the arteries.

==Cause==
[[File:Weißasbestfaser 5000fach Rasterelektronenmikroskop.jpg|thumb|[[White asbestos]] fibers identified in room air analysis, magnified 5000 times using a [[scanning electron microscope]]]]
The cause of asbestosis is the [[inhalation]] of microscopic [[asbestos]] mineral fibers suspended in the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/asbestos/default.html|title=Asbestos|website=CDC|accessdate=13 November 2015|date=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, E. R. A. Merewether found that greater exposure resulted in greater risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Health Effects of Asbestos: An Evidence-based Approach|date=2015|isbn=9781498728409|url=https://books.google.no/books?id=mTDSCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathogenesis==
Asbestosis is the scarring of lung tissue (beginning around terminal [[bronchiole]]s and [[alveolar duct]]s and extending into the alveolar walls) resulting from the inhalation of [[asbestos]] fibers. There are two types of fibers: amphibole (thin and straight) and serpentine (curly). All forms of asbestos fibers are responsible for human disease as they are able to penetrate deeply into the lungs.  When such fibers reach the alveoli (air sacs) in the lung, where oxygen is transferred into the blood, the foreign bodies (asbestos fibers) cause the activation of the lungs' local [[immune system]] and provoke an [[inflammation|inflammatory]] reaction dominated by lung macrophages that respond to chemotactic factors activated by the fibers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Warheit D. B. |author2=Hill L. H. |author3=George G. |author4=Brody A. R. | year = 1986 | title = Time Course of chemotactic factor generation and the macrophage response to asbestos inhalation | url = | journal = Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. | volume = 134 | issue = | pages = 128–133 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This inflammatory reaction can be described as chronic rather than acute, with a slow ongoing progression of the immune system attempting to eliminate the foreign fibers. [[Macrophage]]s [[phagocytosis|phagocytose]] (ingest) the fibers and stimulate [[fibroblast]]s to deposit connective tissue. Due to the asbestos fibers' natural resistance to digestion, some macrophages are killed and others release [[cytokine|inflammatory chemical signals]], attracting further lung macrophages and fibrolastic cells that synthesize fibrous scar tissue, which eventually becomes diffuse and can progress in heavily exposed individuals. This tissue can be seen microscopically soon after exposure in animal models.   Some asbestos fibers become layered by an iron-containing proteinaceous material ([[ferruginous body]]) in cases of heavy exposure where about 10% of the fibers become coated.  Most inhaled asbestos fibers remain uncoated.  About 20% of the inhaled fibers are transported by cytoskeletal components of the alveolar epithelium to the interstitial compartment of the lung where they interact with macrophages and mesenchymal cells. The cytokines, transforming growth factor beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha, appear to play major roles in the development of  scarring inasmuch as the process can be blocked in animal models by preventing the expression of the growth factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Liu J.-Y. |author2=Brass D. M. |author3=Hoyle G. W. |author4=Brody A. R. | year = 1998 | title = TNF-α receptor knockout mice are protected from the fibroproliferative effects of inhaled asbestos fibers | url = | journal = Am. J. Pathol. | volume = 153 | issue = | pages = 1839–1847 | doi=10.1016/s0002-9440(10)65698-2|pmc=1866331 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Liu J.-Y. |author2=Sime P.

Cell Mol. Biol. | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 3–7 | doi=10.1165/ajrcmb.25.1.4481}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is fibrosis in the interstitial space, thus asbestosis. This fibrotic scarring causes alveolar walls to thicken, which reduces elasticity and gas diffusion, reducing oxygen transfer to the blood as well as the removal of [[carbon dioxide]].  This can result in shortness of breath, a common symptom exhibited by individuals with asbestosis.&lt;ref&gt;Brody, A. R.  Asbestosis.  In: Comprehensive Toxicology.  (Roth, R. A., Ed.), Elsevier Science, New York, Vol. 8(25), pp. 393–413, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==

[[Image:Asbestosis.ILO 2-2 S-S.jpg|thumb|Close-up asbestosis right lower zone ILO 2/2 S/S]]
[[Image:Early Asbestosis in a Retired Pipe Fitter.jpg|thumb|right|Lateral chest X-ray in asbestosis shows plaquing of the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]].]]
According to the [[American Thoracic Society]] (ATS), the general diagnostic criteria for asbestosis are:&lt;ref name="ATS 2004"/&gt;
*Evidence of structural pathology consistent with asbestosis, as documented by imaging or histology
*Evidence of causation by asbestos as documented by the occupational and environmental history, markers of exposure (usually pleural plaques), recovery of asbestos bodies, or other means
*Exclusion of alternative plausible causes for the findings

The abnormal chest x-ray and its interpretation remain the most important factors in establishing the presence of pulmonary fibrosis.&lt;ref name="ATS 2004"/&gt; The findings usually appear as small, irregular parenchymal opacities, primarily in the lung bases. Using the [[ILO Classification]] system, "s", "t", and/or "u" opacities predominate. CT or high-resolution CT (HRCT) are more sensitive than plain radiography at detecting pulmonary fibrosis (as well as any underlying pleural changes). More than 50% of people affected with asbestosis develop plaques in the [[parietal pleura]], the space between the chest wall and lungs. Once apparent, the radiographic findings in asbestosis may slowly progress or remain static, even in the absence of further asbestos exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Becklake MR, Case BW |title=Fiber burden and asbestos-related lung disease: determinants of dose-response relationships |journal=Am.

Asbestosis resembles many other diffuse interstitial lung diseases, including other [[pneumoconiosis]]. The differential diagnosis includes [[idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis]] (IPF), [[hypersensitivity pneumonitis]], [[sarcoidosis]], and others. The presence of pleural plaquing may provide supportive evidence of causation by asbestos. Although lung biopsy is usually not necessary, the presence of asbestos bodies in association with pulmonary fibrosis establishes the diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Craighead JE, Abraham JL, Churg A |title=The pathology of asbestos-associated diseases of the lungs and pleural cavities: diagnostic criteria and proposed grading schema.

==Treatment==
There is no cure available for asbestosis.&lt;ref name="Castleman"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Berger, Stephen A. |author2=Castleman, Barry I. |title=Asbestos: medical and legal aspects |publisher=Aspen |location=Gaithersburg MD |year=2005 |isbn=0-7355-5260-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oxygen therapy]] at home is often necessary to relieve the shortness of breath and correct underlying low blood oxygen levels. Supportive treatment of symptoms includes respiratory [[physiotherapy]] to remove secretions from the lungs by postural drainage, chest percussion, and vibration. [[Nebulizer|Nebulized]] medications may be prescribed in order to loosen secretions or treat underlying [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]]. Immunization against [[pneumococcal pneumonia]] and annual [[influenza]] vaccination is administered due to increased sensitivity to the diseases. Those with asbestosis are at increased risk for certain cancers. If the person smokes, quitting the habit reduces further damage. Periodic pulmonary function tests, chest x-rays, and clinical evaluations, including cancer screening/evaluations, are given to detect additional hazards.

===Legal issues===
{{main|Asbestos and the law}}

The death of [[England|English]] textile worker [[Nellie Kershaw]] in 1924 from pulmonary asbestosis was the first case to be described in medical literature, and the first published account of disease attributed to occupational asbestos exposure. However, her former employers (Turner Brothers Asbestos) denied that asbestosis even existed because the medical condition was not officially recognised at the time. As a result, they accepted no liability for her injuries and paid no compensation, either to Kershaw during her final illness or to her bereaved family after she had died. Even so, the findings of the [[inquest]] into her death were highly influential insofar as they led to a parliamentary enquiry by the [[British Parliament]]. The enquiry formally acknowledged the existence of asbestosis, recognised that it was hazardous to health and concluded that it was irrefutably linked to the prolonged inhalation of asbestos dust. Having established the existence of asbestosis on a medical and judicial basis, the report resulted in the first Asbestos Industry Regulations being published in 1931, which came into effect on 1 March 1932.&lt;ref name="cooke"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.3317.147|author=Cooke WE |title=Fibrosis of the Lungs due to the Inhalation of Asbestos Dust |journal=[[BMJ|Br Med J]] |volume=2 |issue=3317 |pages=140–2, 147 |date=1924-07-26 |pmc=2304688|pmid=20771679}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="selikoff"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1001/jama.265.7.898|last1=Selikoff|first1=Irving J.|last2=Greenberg|first2=Morris|title=A Landmark Case in Asbestosis|journal=[[Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]]|volume=265|issue=7|pages =898–901 |date=1991-02-20 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/265/7/898.pdf |format=PDF |pmid=1825122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first lawsuits against asbestos manufacturers occurred in 1929.  Since then, many lawsuits have been filed against  asbestos manufacturers and employers, for neglecting to implement safety measures after the link between asbestos, asbestosis and mesothelioma became known (some reports seem to place this [[Asbestos#Asbestosis and cancer|as early as 1898]] in modern times).  The liability resulting from the sheer number of lawsuits and people affected has reached billions of dollars.  The amounts and method of allocating compensation have been the source of many court cases, and government attempts at resolution of existing and future cases.&lt;ref&gt;[[Armley asbestos disaster]], [[Spodden Valley asbestos controversy]], [[Turner &amp; Newall]]&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, about 100 companies have declared bankruptcy at least partially due to asbestos-related liability. In accordance with Chapter 11 and  § 524(g) of the federal bankruptcy code, a company may transfer its liabilities and certain assets to an asbestos personal injury trust, which is then responsible for compensating present and future claimants. Since 1988, 60 trusts have been established to pay claims with about $37 billion in total assets. From 1988 through 2010, analysis from the United States Government Accountability Office indicates that trusts have paid about 3.3 million claims valued at about $17.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mesothelioma.guide/documents/asbestos-litigation-report.pdf Report to the Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives] Retrieved April 30, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12865">The '''Australian Paradox''' is a term coined in 2011 to describe what its proponents claim are diverging trends in [[sugar]] consumption and [[Obesity in Australia|obesity rates in Australia]]. The term was first used in a 2011 study published in [[Nutrients (journal)|''Nutrients'']] by Professor [[Jennie Brand-Miller]], in which she and co-author Dr Alan Barclay reported that, in Australia, "a substantial decline in refined sugars intake occurred over the same timeframe that obesity has increased."&lt;ref name=Nutrients&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barclay AW, Brand-Miller J |title=The Australian paradox: a substantial decline in sugars intake over the same timeframe that overweight and obesity have increased |journal=[[Nutrients (journal)|Nutrients]] |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=491–504 |date=April 2011 |pmid=22254107 |pmc=3257688 |doi=10.3390/nu3040491 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The "paradox" in its name refers to the fact that sugar consumption is often considered (for example by [[Robert Lustig]]) to be a significant contributor to rising obesity rates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21228360.200-australian-paradox.html | title=Australian paradox | work=[[New Scientist]] | date=26 October 2011 | accessdate=8 April 2014 | author=Russell, Geoff}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because [[Ecological study|ecological studies]] in the [[United States]] have found a positive relationship over certain time periods between sugar consumption and obesity prevalence &lt;ref name=Nutrients/&gt;, although added sugars consumption is now also [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21753067 declining] in the [[United States]].

==Reaction==
Some people have criticized Brand-Miller's 2011 study, such as economist Rory Robertson, who argued that "[Brand-Miller's study's] regular claim &amp;ndash; "In Australia sugar consumption has dropped 23 per cent since 1980" &amp;ndash; is woefully misleading, based as it is on a series that was abandoned by the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] (ABS) as unreliable a decade ago."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/economist-v-nutritionists-big-sugar-and-lowgi-brigade-lose-20120307-1uj6u.html | title=Economist v nutritionists: big sugar and low-GI brigade lose | work=[[Sydney Morning-Herald]] | date=7 March 2012 | accessdate=8 April 2014 | author=Pascoe, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson has also argued that while the paper claims that consumption of sugary [[soft drink]]s in Australia declined by 10% between 1994 and 2006, it actually increased by 30%. He cites these and other data to support calling the research "a menace to public health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/backgroundbriefing/2014-02-09/5239418 | title=Is sugar innocent? | work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | date=9 February 2014 | accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In February 2014, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) aired a program criticizing the 2011 study proposing the existence of the paradox, based in part on Robertson's research. The CEO of the [[Australian Beverages Council]], Geoff Parker, has responded that his industry cites other studies besides Brand-Miller's 2011 study to support their view that sugar is not uniquely linked to obesity.&lt;ref name=Safi&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/11/soft-drink-industry-sugar-consumption-evidence | title=Soft-drink industry resists sugar consumption evidence in documentary | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=10 February 2014 | accessdate=8 April 2014 | author=Safi, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Robertson's allegations, [[Sydney University]], Brand-Miller's employer, launched an investigation to determine if she is guilty of research misconduct. A spokesperson for the university said there were "...no substantiated claims against the work of any academic at the university, nor indeed has there been any finding that the complaints warrant any further investigation".&lt;ref name=Safi/&gt; 

In July 2014, Brand-Miller and Barclay were cleared of misconduct by a six-month investigation conducted by Robert Clark of the [[University of New South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/21/sugar-row-nutritionists-cleared-misconduct | title=Researchers cleared of misconduct in row over sugar link to obesity | work=The Guardian | date=20 July 2014 | accessdate=24 July 2014 | author=Safi, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following an investigation prompted by the Australian economist, two minor arithmetical errors were identified in the original manuscript of The Australian Paradox which were promptly corrected. This was the only allegation out of 8 others that was substantiated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sydney.edu.au/news/84.html?newsstoryid=13779 Outcome of inquiry into 'Australian Paradox' research]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study on the same topic was published in 2013 by researchers (Rikkers et al.) from the [[University of Western Australia]]. The study concluded that "The Australian Paradox assertion is based on incomplete data, as it excludes sugar contained in imported processed foods, which have increased markedly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rikkers W, Lawrence D, Hafekost K, Mitrou F, Zubrick SR |title=Trends in sugar supply and consumption in Australia: is there an Australian Paradox? |journal=BMC Public Health |volume=13 |issue= |pages=668 |year=2013 |pmid=23866719 |pmc=3726354 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-13-668 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study argued that the claim that sugar consumption had been declining in Australia relied only on production data, and that Australia gets back much of the raw sugar it exports in the form of processed foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/25/obesity-comes-to-australia/ | title=Australians Are Getting Fatter | work=[[New York Times]] | date=25 July 2013 | accessdate=8 April 2014 | author=O'Connor, Anahad | authorlink=Anahad O'Connor}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-13-668/comments Tom McNeill] demonstrated that Rikkers paper was significantly flawed: "Rikkers et al.'s biggest source of error is the inclusion of incorrect products in the category of "moderate to high sugar content", in violation of their study inclusion criteria. Fruit juices and fruit drinks have been added to the analysis by the authors without consideration of their actual sugar content, or the very definition of these products which must be adhered to by food manufacturers under the control of Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ)". A narrative review of eye disease published the following year argued that the claim of the existence of an Australian paradox "is flawed as it assumes declining sugar intake, without taking into account imported foods containing sugar.", quoting Rikkers et al's flawed analysis as evidence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kearney|first=Frances M|author2=Fagan, Xavier J |author3=Al-Qureshi, Salmaan |title=Review of the role of refined dietary sugars (fructose and glucose) in the genesis of retinal disease|journal=Clinical &amp; Experimental Ophthalmology|date=April 2014|pages=564–573|doi=10.1111/ceo.12290|volume=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Brand-Miller and Barclay have responded that Rikkers et al. are wrong and that, in fact, the sugar consumption data they used (compiled by the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], the Australian Bureau of Statistics and Australian beverage industry) "all incorporated data on imported products".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barclay AW, Brand-Miller JC |title=Trends in added sugar supply and consumption in Australia: there is an Australian Paradox |journal=BMC Public Health |volume=13 |issue= |pages=898 |year=2013 |pmid=24079329 |pmc=3853158 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-13-898 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research by Levy and Shrapnel ("Quenching Australia's thirst: A trend analysis of water-based beverage sales from 1997 to 2011") has concluded that [[added sugar]] from soft drinks has continued to decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/1747-0080.12108 | volume=71 | title=Quenching Australia's thirst: A trend analysis of water-based beverage sales from 1997 to 2011 | year=2014 | journal=Nutrition &amp; Dietetics | pages=193–200 | author=Levy Gina S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brand-Miller's stated that per capita sales of sugar-sweetened beverages had decreased by 10%, in an interview with ABC Radio in 2014, "it might be that a key word came out. It's possible that this should be, 'While nutritively sweetened beverages ... 10 per cent sweetened beverages decreased by 10 per cent.' So I'll double-check it." Barclay, the 2011 study's other author, also said, in an email to the program, that "the 10 per cent decline could not possibly refer to per capita sales of nutritively sweetened soft drinks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ama.com.au/ausmed/attack-controversial-sugar-study-intensifies | title=Attack on controversial sugar study intensifies | publisher=[[Australian Medical Association]] | date=4 March 2014 | accessdate=8 April 2014 | author=Rollins, Adrian}}&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned previously, Brand-Miller and Barclay published a correction to their original 2011 study addressing this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barclay|first=Alan|author2=Brand-Miller, Jennie|title=Barclay, A.W. and Brand-Miller, J. The Australian Paradox: A Substantial Decline in Sugars Intake over the Same Timeframe that Overweight and Obesity Have Increased. Nutrients 2011, 3, 491-504|journal=Nutrients|date=12 February 2014|volume=6|issue=2|pages=663–664|doi=10.3390/nu6020663}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Esther Han, this correction invalidates the study's claim that soft drink consumption decreased from 1994 to 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/diet-and-fitness/rise-in-sugary-drinks-is-really-a-fall-says-study-funded-by-beverages-australia-20140216-32tr5.html | title=Rise in sugary drinks is really a fall, says study funded by Beverages Australia | work=Sydney Morning-Herald | date=17 February 2014 | accessdate=10 April 2014 | author=Han, Esther}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Brand-Miller and Barclay disagree. 

Complaints about the scientific journal ''[[Nutrients (journal)|Nutrients]]'' over its publication of The Australian Paradox paper led to the [[Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association]] (OASPA) investigating ''Nutrients'' publisher, [[MDPI]]. In 2014, OASPA's investigation concluded that MDPI continued to meet its membership criteria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oaspa.org/conclusions-from-oaspa-membership-committee-investigation-into-mdpi/ Conclusions from OASPA Membership Committee Investigation into MDPI]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, an update of all available Australian added sugars consumption data titled "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28275129 Declining consumption of added sugars and sugar-sweetened beverages in Australia: a challenge for obesity prevention]" was published in the American Journal Of Clinical Nutrition. The analysis concluded "In Australia, 4 independent data sets confirmed shorter- and longer-term declines in the availability and intake of added sugars, including those contributed by SSBs (Sugar Sweetened Beverages)."

Independent analyses by Australian researchers including [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28231135 Ridoutt and colleagues] at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26794833 Lei and colleagues] also concluded that Australians consumed less added sugars in the years 2011-12 than they did in 1995.

In December 2017, the Australian Bureau of Statistics published a comparison of free sugars consumption using Australia's 1995 National Nutrition Survey and 2011/2 Australian Health Survey titled "[http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/4364.0.55.011~2011-12~Main%20Features~Consumption%20of%20Added%20Sugars%20-%20A%20comparison%20of%201995%20to%202011-12~20 CONSUMPTION OF ADDED SUGARS - A COMPARISON OF 1995 TO 2011-12]". Its main conclusion was "Between 1995 and 2011-12, Australians had a relative decrease in their consumption of free sugars, with the average proportion of dietary energy from free sugars declining from 12.5% to 10.9%."

Overall, the weight of evidence ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28231135 Ridoutt and colleagues], [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26794833 Lei and colleagues], [http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4364.0.55.011Main+Features202011-12?OpenDocument Australian Bureau of Statistics]) supports Brand-Miller and Barclay's hypothesis that free and added sugars consumption has declined in Australia over the time-frame that overweight and obesity have increased.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29731">[[Ionizing radiation]] can cause biological effects which are passed on to offspring through the [[epigenome]]. The [[radiobiology|effects of radiation on cells]] has been found to be dependent on the [[Radiation dose|dosage]] of the radiation, the location of the cell in regards to tissue, and whether the cell is a [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] or [[germ line]] cell. Generally, ionizing radiation appears to reduce [[DNA methylation|methylation]] of [[DNA]] in cells.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Joong-Gook|last2=Park|first2=Moon-Taek|last3=Heo|first3=Kyu|last4=Yang|first4=Kwang-Mo|last5=Yi|first5=Joo Mi|date=2013-07-18|title=Epigenetics Meets Radiation Biology as a New Approach in Cancer Treatment|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|volume=14|issue=7|pages=15059–15073|doi=10.3390/ijms140715059|issn=1422-0067|pmc=3742287|pmid=23873297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ionizing radiation has been known to cause damage to cellular components such as [[proteins]], [[lipids]], and [[nucleic acids]]. It has also been known to cause [[DNA repair#Double-strand breaks|DNA double-strand breaks]]. Accumulation of DNA double strand breaks can lead to [[cell cycle]] arrest in somatic cells and cause [[cell death]]. Due to its ability to induce cell cycle arrest, ionizing radiation is used on abnormal growths in the human body such as cancer cells, in [[radiation therapy]]. Most cancer cells are fully treated with some type of [[radiotherapy]], however some cells such as [[Cancer stem cell|stem cell cancer cells]] show a reoccurrence when treated by this type of therapy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Radiation exposure in everyday life ==
Non-ionising radiations, [[EMFs and cancer|electromagnetic fields (EMF)]] such as [[Radio frequency|radiofrequency]] (RF), or power frequency radiation have become very common in everyday life. All of these exist as low frequency radiation which can come from wireless cellular devices or through electrical appliances which induce [[extremely low frequency]] radiation (ELF).

=== Radiation and medical imaging ===
{{see also|Radiation protection}}
Advances in [[medical imaging]] has resulted in increased exposure of humans to low doses of ionizing radiation. Radiation exposure in [[pediatrics]] has been shown to have a greater impact as children's cells are still developing.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The radiation obtained from medical imaging techniques is only harmful if consistently targeted multiple times in a short space of time. Safety measures have been introduced in order to limit the exposure of harmful ionizing radiation such as the usage of protective material during the use of these imaging tools. A lower dosage is also used in order to fully rid the possibility of a harmful effect from the medical imaging tools. The [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] along with many other scientific committees have ruled in favor of continued use of medical imaging as the reward far outweighs the minimal risk obtained from these imaging techniques. If the safety protocols are not followed there is a potential increase in the risk of developing cancer. This is primarily due to the decreased methylation of cell cycle genes, such as those relating to [[apoptosis]] and [[DNA repair]]. The ionizing radiation from these techniques can cause many other detrimental effects in cells including changes in [[gene expression]] and halting the cell cycle. However, these results are extremely unlikely if the proper protocols are followed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

== Target theory ==
Target theory concerns the models of how radiation kills biological cells and is based around two main postulates:

# "Radiation is considered to be a sequence of random projectiles;
# the components of the cell are considered as the targets bombarded by these projectiles"&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Summers|first=William C|date=|title=Physics and Genes: Einstein to Delbrück|url=|journal=Creating a Physical Biology:The Three-Man Paper and Early Molecular Biology|location=Chicago, USA|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|volume=|pages=39–68|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several models have been based around the above two points. From the various proposed models three main conclusions were found:

# Physical hits obey a [[Poisson distribution]] 
# Failure of [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] particles to attack sensitive areas of cells allow for survival of the cell
# Cell death is an exponential function of the dose of radiation received as the number of hits received is directly proportional to the radiation dose; all hits are considered lethal&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bodgi|first=Larry|last2=Canet|first2=Aurelien|last3=Pujo-Menjouet|first3=Laurent|last4=Lesne|first4=Annick|last5=Victor|first5=Jean-Marc|last6=Foray|first6=Nicolas|date=2016-04-07|title=Mathematical models of radiation action on living cells: From the target theory to the modern approaches. A historical and critical review|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519316000515|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|language=en|volume=394|pages=93–101|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2016.01.018|issn=0022-5193|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radiation exposure through ionizing radiation (IR) affects a variety of processes inside of an exposed cell. IR can cause changes in gene expression, disruption of cell cycle arrest, and apoptotic cell death. The extent of how radiation effects cells depends on the type of cell and the dosage of the radiation. Some irradiated cancer cells have been shown to exhibit DNA methylation patterns due to epigenetic mechanisms in the cell. In medicine, medical diagnostic methods such as [[CT scans]] and radiation therapy expose the individual to ionizing radiation. Irradiated cells can also induce [[genome instability|genomic instability]] in neighboring un-radiated cells via the bystander effect. Radiation exposure could also occur via many other channels than just ionizing radiation.

=== The basic ballistic models ===

==== The single-target single-hit model ====
In this model a single hit on a target is sufficient to kill a cell&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The equation used for this model is as follows:

&lt;math&gt;
p(k) =  \frac{m^k}{k!} e^{-m}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where k represents a hit on the cell and m represents the mass of the cell.

===== The n-target single-hit model =====
In this model the cell has a number of targets n. A single hit on one target is not sufficient to kill the cell but does disable the target. An accumulation of successful hits on various targets leads to cell death.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The equation used for this model is as follows:

&lt;math&gt;
p(n) = (1-e^{-\frac{D}{D_0}})^n
&lt;/math&gt;

Where n represents number of the targets in the cell.

=== The linear quadratic model ===
The equation used for this model is as follows:&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
S(D) = e^{-\alpha D -\beta D^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

where αD represents a hit made by a one particle track and βD represents a hit made by a two particle track and S(D) represents the probability of survival of the cell.

==== The three lambda model ====

This model showed the accuracy of survival description for higher or repeated doses.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The equation used for this model is as follows:

&lt;math&gt;
S(D) = e^{-\lambda_3 (1 - e^{\lambda_1D}(1  -(1 - e^{-(\lambda_2 - \lambda_1)D})^2))}
&lt;/math&gt;

==== The linear-quadratic-cubic model ====

The equation used for this model is as follows:&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
S(D) = e^{-\alpha D-\beta D^{2}+\gamma D^{3}}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Sublesions hypothesis models ===

==== The repair-misrepair model ====

This model shows the mean number of [[lesion]]s before any repair activations in a cell.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The equation used for this model is as follows:

&lt;math&gt;
S_\psi = e^{-U_0} (1+ \frac{U_0(1-e^{-\lambda T})}{\epsilon})^{\psi \epsilon}
&lt;/math&gt;

where U&lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; represents the yield of initially induced lesions, with λ being the linear self-repair coefficient, and T equaling time

==== The lethal-potentially lethal model ====

This equation explores the hypothesis of a lesion becoming fatal within a given of time if it is not repair by repair enzymes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The equation used for this model is as follows:

&lt;math&gt;
S = e^{-n_{tot} (T+t_r)} = e^{-N_{tot}} [\frac{1+N_{PL}}{\epsilon (1-e^{- \epsilon_{PL}t_r})}]^\epsilon
&lt;/math&gt;

T is the radiation duration and t&lt;small&gt;r&lt;/small&gt; is the available repair time.

==== The saturable repair model ====

This model illustrates the efficiency of the repair system decreasing as the dosage of radiation increases. This is due to the repair kinetics becoming increasingly saturated with the increase in radiation dosage.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The equation used for this model is as follows:

&lt;math&gt;
S(D) = e^{-\frac{n_0-c_0}{1-\frac{c_0}{n_0}e^{kT(c_0-n_0)}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

n(t) is the number of unrepaired lesions, c(t) is the number of repair molecules or enzymes, k is the proportionality coefficient, and T is the time available for repair.

== Cellular environment and radiation hormesis ==
=== [[Radiation hormesis]] ===
[[Hormesis]] is the hypothesis that low levels of disrupting stimulus can cause beneficial adaptations in an organism.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vaiserman|first=Alexander M.|accessdate=April 1, 2018|year=2011|title=Hormesis and epigenetics: Is there a link?|url=https://ac-els-cdn-com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/S1568163711000055/1-s2.0-S1568163711000055-main.pdf?_tid=28b1af2b-89f9-4efd-8833-c8280bbd8ea6&amp;acdnat=1522641757_9cde4ff1b14f4fd87539791c6d41bcc9|journal=Ageing Research Reviews|publisher=Elsevier Ireland LTD|publication-date=September 2011|volume=10|issue=4|pages=413–421|via=Web of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ionizing radiation stimulates repair proteins that are usually not active. Cells use this new stimuli to adapt to the stressors they are being exposed to.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Se-A.|last2=Lee|first2=Yu-Mi|last3=Choi|first3=Je-Yong|last4=Jacobs|first4=David R.|last5=Lee|first5=Duk-Hee|title=Evolutionarily adapted hormesis-inducing stressors can be a practical solution to mitigate harmful effects of chronic exposure to low dose chemical mixtures|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0269749117335534|journal=Environmental Pollution|volume=233|pages=725–734|doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2017.10.124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Bystander effect (radiobiology)|Radiation-Induced Bystander Effect (RIBE)]] ===
In biology, the bystander effect is described as changes to nearby non-targeted cells in response to changes in an initially targeted cell by some disrupting agent.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Verma|first=Neha|last2=Tiku|first2=Ashu Bhan|access-date=Jun 27, 2018|title=Significance and nature of bystander responses induced by various agents|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138357421630014X?via%3Dihub|journal=Mutation Research/Reviews in Mutation Research|publisher=Elsevier Science Bv|publication-date=Jul 2017|volume=773|pages=104–121|via=Web of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of [[Bystander effect (radiobiology)|Radiation-Induced Bystander Effect]], the stress on the cell is caused by ionizing radiation.

The bystander effect can be broken down into two catagories, long range bystander effect and short range bystander effect. In long range bystander effect, the effects of stress are seen further away from the initially targeted cell. In short range bystander, the effects of stress are seen in cells adjacent to the target cell.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Both low [[linear energy transfer]] and high linear energy transfer photons have been shown to produce RIBE. Low linear energy transfer photons were reported to cause increases in mutagenesis and a reduction in the survival of cells in [[clonogenic assay]]s. X-rays and gamma rays were reported to cause increases in DNA double strand break, methylation, and apoptosis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Further studies are needed to reach a conclusive explanation of any epigenetic impact of the bystander effect.

== Radiation and oxidative stress ==
=== Formation of ROS ===
Ionizing radiation produces fast moving particles which have the ability to damage DNA, and produce highly reactive free radicals known as [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS). The production of ROS in cells radiated by LDIR (Low-Dose Ionizing Radiation) occur in two ways, by the [[radiolysis]] of water molecules or the promotion of [[Biological functions of nitric oxide|nitric oxide synthesis]] (NOS) activity. The resulting nitric oxide formation reacts with [[superoxide]] radicals. This generates [[peroxynitrite]] which is toxic to biomolecules. Cellular ROS is also produced with the help of a mechanism involving nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide phosphate ([[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADPH]]) oxidase. NADPH oxidase helps with the formation of ROS by generating a superoxide anion by transferring electrons from cytosolic NADPH across the cell membrane to the extracellular molecular oxygen. This process increases the potential for leakage of electrons and free radicals from the mitochondria. The exposure to the LDIR induces electron release from the mitochondria resulting in more electrons contributing to the superoxide formation in the cells.

The production of ROS in high quantity in cells results in the degradation of biomolecules such as proteins, DNA, and RNA. In one such instance the ROS are known to create double stranded and single stranded breaks in the DNA. This causes the DNA repair mechanisms to try to adapt to the increase in DNA strand breaks. Heritable changes to the DNA sequence have been seen although the DNA nucleotide sequence seems the same after the exposure with LDIR.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Activation of NOS  ===
The formation of ROS is coupled with the formation of [[nitric oxide synthase]] activity (NOS). NO reacts with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; generating peroxynitrite. The increase in the NOS activity causes the production of [[peroxynitrite]] (ONOO&lt;big&gt;-).&lt;/big&gt; Peroxynitrite is a strong oxidant radical and it reacts with a wide array of biomolecules such as DNA bases, proteins and lipids. Peroxynitrite affects biomolecules function and structure and therefore effectively destabilizes the cell.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Mechanism of oxidative stress and epigenetic gene regulation ===
Ionizing radiation causes the cell to generate increased ROS and the increase of this species damages biological macromolecules. In order to compensate for this increased radical species, cells adapt to IR induced oxidative effects by modifying the mechanisms of epigenetic gene regulation. There are 4 epigenetic modifications that can take place:

# formation of protein [[adduct]]s inhibiting epigenetic regulation
# alteration of genomic [[DNA methylation]] status
# [[Post-translational modification|modification of post translational]] [[histone]] interactions affecting [[chromatin]] compaction
# modulation of signaling pathways that control [[transcription factor]] expression

====ROS-mediated protein adduct formation====

ROS generated by ionizing radiation chemically modify histones which can cause a change in transcription. Oxidation of cellular lipid components result in an [[Electrophile|electrophilic]] molecule formation. The electrophilic molecule binds to the [[lysine]] residues of histones causing a ketoamide adduct formation. The ketoamide adduct formation blocks the lysine residues of histones from binding to [[acetylation]] proteins thus decreasing gene transcription.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

====ROS-mediated DNA methylation changes====

DNA hypermethylation is seen in the genome with DNA breaks at a gene-specific basis, such as promoters of regulatory genes, but the global methylation of the genome shows a hypomethylation pattern during the period of reactive oxygen species stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-10-23|title=Epigenetics of malignant melanoma|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044579X1730130X|journal=Seminars in Cancer Biology|language=en|doi=10.1016/j.semcancer.2017.10.006|issn=1044-579X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA damage induced by reactive oxygen species results in increased gene methylation and ultimately gene silencing. Reactive oxygen species modify the mechanism of epigenetic methylation by inducing DNA breaks which are later repaired and then methylated by [[DNMT]]s. DNA damage response genes, such as [[GADD45A]], recruit nuclear proteins [[UHRF1|Np95]] to direct [[histone methyltransferase|histone methyltransferase's]] towards the damaged DNA site. The breaks in DNA caused by the ionizing radiation then recruit the DNMTs in order to repair and further methylate the repair site.

Genome wide hypomethylation occurs due to reactive oxygen species hydroxylating [[methylcytosine]]s to [[5-Hydroxymethylcytosine|5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ni|first=Qihan  Wu and   Xiaohua|date=2014-12-31|title=ROS-Mediated DNA Methylation Pattern Alterations in Carcinogenesis|url=http://www.eurekaselect.com/127591/article|journal=Current Drug Targets|language=en|volume=16|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of 5hmC serves as an epigenetic marker for DNA damage which is recognizable by DNA repair enzymes. The DNA repair enzymes attracted by the marker convert 5hmC to an unmethylated cytosine base resulting in the hypomethylation of the genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kafer|first=Georgia Rose|last2=Li|first2=Xuan|last3=Horii|first3=Takuro|last4=Suetake|first4=Isao|last5=Tajima|first5=Shoji|last6=Hatada|first6=Izuho|last7=Carlton|first7=Peter Mark|date=Feb 4, 2016|title=5-Hydroxymethylcytosine Marks Sites of DNA Damage and Promotes Genome Stability|url=https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(16)00056-5?_returnURL=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211124716000565?showall=true|journal=Cell Reports|language=English|volume=14|issue=6|pages=1283–1292|doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2016.01.035|issn=2211-1247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another mechanism that induces hypomethylation is the depletion of [[S-adenosylmethionine synthetase enzyme|S-adenosyl methionine synthetase]] (SAM). The prevalence of super oxide species causes the oxidization of reduced [[glutathione]] (GSH) to [[GSSG]]. Due to this, synthesis of the cosubstrate SAM is stopped. SAM is an essential cosubtrate for the normal functioning of DNMTs and histone methyltrasnferase proteins.

==== ROS-mediated post-translation modification ====

Double stranded DNA breaks caused by exposure to ionizing radiation are known to alter chromatin structure. Double stranded breaks are primarily repaired by [[Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase|poly ADP (PAR) polymerases]] which accumulate at the site of the break leading to activation of the chromatin remodeling protein [[CHD1L|ALC1]]. ALC1 causes the [[nucleosome]] to relax resulting in the epigenetic up-regulation of genes. A similar mechanism involves the [[ataxia telangiectasia mutated]] (ATM) [[Serine/threonine-specific protein kinase|serine/threonine kinase]] which is an enzyme involved in the repair of double stranded breaks caused by ionizing radiation. ATM phosphorylates [[TRIM28|KAP1]] which causes the [[heterochromatin]] to relax, allowing increased transcription to occur.

The DNA mismatch repair gene ([[MSH2]]) promoter has shown a hypermethylation pattern when exposed to ionizing radiation. Reactive oxygen species induce the oxidization of [[deoxyguanosine]] into [[8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine|8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine]] (8-OHdG) causing a change in chromatin structure. Gene promoters that contain 8-OHdG deactivate the chromatin by inducing [[H3K27me3|trimethyl-H3K27]] in the genome. Other enzymes such as [[Transglutaminase|transglutaminases (TGs]]) control chromatin remodeling through proteins such as [[Sirtuin 1|sirtuin1]] (SIRT1). TGs cause transcriptional repression during reactive oxygen species stress by binding to the chromatin and inhibiting the [[sirtuin 1]] [[histone deacetylase]] from performing its function.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==== ROS-mediated loss of epigenetic imprinting ====

[[Epigenetic imprinting]] is lost during reactive oxygen species stress. This type of oxidative stress causes a loss of [[NF-κB|NF- κB]] signaling. Enhancer blocking element CCCTC-binding factor ([[CTCF]]) binds to the imprint control region of [[insulin-like growth factor 2]] (IGF2) preventing the enhancers from allowing the transcription of the gene. The NF- κB proteins interact with [[IκB]] inhibitory proteins, but during oxidative stress IκB proteins are degraded in the cell. The loss of [[IκB]] proteins for NF- κB proteins to bind to results in NF- κB proteins entering the nucleus to bind to specific response elements to counter the oxidative stress. The binding of NF- κB and corepressor [[HDAC1]] to response elements such as the CCCTC-binding factor causes a decrease in expression of the enhancer blocking element. This decrease in expression hinders the binding to the IGF2 imprint control region therefore causing the loss of imprinting and biallelic [[IGF2]] expression.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Mechanisms of epigenetic modifications  ==
After the initial exposure to ionizing radiation, cellular changes are prevalent in the unexposed offspring of irradiated cells for many cell divisions. One way this [[Non-Mendelian inheritance|non-Mendelian mode of inheritance]] can be explained is through epigenetic mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tharmalingam|first=Sujeenthar|last2=Sreetharan|first2=Shayenthiran|last3=Kulesza|first3=Adomas V.|last4=Boreham|first4=Douglas R.|last5=Tai|first5=T.

=== Ionizing radiation and DNA methylation ===

==== Genomic instability via hypomethylation of LINE1 ====
Ionizing radiation exposure affects patterns of DNA methylation. [[Breast cancer]] cells treated with fractionated doses of ionizing radiation showed DNA hypomethylation at the various gene loci; [[dose fractionation]] refers to breaking down one dose of radiation into separate, smaller doses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms|title=NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms|website=National Cancer Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hypomethylation of these genes correlated with decreased expression of various DNMTs and [[Methyl-CpG-binding domain|methyl CpG]] binding proteins. [[LINE1]] transposable elements have been identified as targets for ionizing radiation. The hypomethylation of LINE1 elements results in activation of the elements and thus an increase in LINE1 protein levels. Increased transcription of LINE1 transposable elements results in greater mobilization of the LINE1 loci and therefore increases genomic instability.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tharmalingam|first=Sujeenthar|last2=Sreetharan|first2=Shayenthiran|last3=Kulesza|first3=Adomas V.|last4=Boreham|first4=Douglas R.|last5=Tai|first5=T. C.|date=Jul 28, 2017|title=Low-Dose Ionizing Radiation Exposure, Oxidative Stress and Epigenetic Programing of Health and Disease|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/10.1667/RR14587.1?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed|volume=188|issue=4.2|pages=525–538|doi=10.1667/rr14587.1|issn=0033-7587|bibcode=2017RadR..188..525T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ionizing radiation and histone modification ====
Irradiated cells can be linked to a variety of histone modifications. Ionizing radiation in breast cancer cell inhibits H4 lysine tri-methylation. Mouse models exposed to high levels of X-ray irradiation exhibited a decrease in both the tri-methylation of H4-Lys20 and the compaction of the chromatin. With the loss of tri-methylation of H4-Lys20, DNA hypomethylation increased resulting in DNA damage and increased genomic instability.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==== Loss of methylation via repair mechanisms ====

Breaks in DNA due to ionizing radiation can be repaired. New [[DNA synthesis]] by [[DNA polymerase]]s is one of the ways radiation induced DNA damage can be [[DNA repair|repaired]]. However, DNA polymerases do not insert methylated bases which leads to a decrease in methylation of the newly synthesized strand. Reactive oxygen species also inhibit DNMT activity which would normally add the missing methyl groups. This increases the chance that the demethylated state of DNA will eventually become permanent.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miousse|first=Isabelle R.|last2=Kutanzi|first2=Kristy R.|last3=Koturbash|first3=Igor|date=Feb 21, 2017|title=Effects of Ionizing Radiation on DNA Methylation: From Experimental Biology to Clinical Applications|journal=International journal of radiation biology|volume=93|issue=5|pages=457–469|doi=10.1080/09553002.2017.1287454|issn=0955-3002|pmc=5411327|pmid=28134023|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09553002.2017.1287454?journalCode=irab20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clinical consequences and applications ==
=== Epigenetic affects on a developing brain ===
Chronic exposure to these types of radiation can have an effect on children from as early as when they are fetuses. There have been multiple cases reported of hindrance in the development of the brain, behavioral changes such as anxiety, and the disruption of proper learning and language processing. An Increase in the cases of [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] behavior and [[autism]] behavior has been shown to be directly correlated with the exposure of EMF waves. The [[World Health Organization]] has classified RFR as a possible carcinogen for its epigenetic effects on DNA expression. The exposure to EMF waves on a consistent 24hr basis has shown to lower the activity of [[MicroRNA|miRNA]] in the brain affecting developmental and neuronal activity. This epigenetic change causes the silencing of necessary genes along with the change in expression of other genes integral for the normal development of the brain.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== MGMT- and LINE1- specific DNA methylation ===
DNA methylation influences tissue responses to ionizing radiation. Modulation of methylation in the gene [[O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase|MGMT]] or in transposable elements such as [[LINE1]] could be used to alter tissue responses to ionizing radiation and potentially opening new areas for cancer treatment.

[[O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase|MGMT]] serves as a prognostic marker in [[glioblastoma]]. Hypermethylation of MGMT is associated with the regression of tumors. Hypermethylation of MGMT silences its transcription inhibiting alkylating agents in tumor killing cells. Studies have shown patients who received [[radiotherapy]], but no [[chemotherapy]] after tumor extraction, had an improved response to radiotherapy due to the methylation of the MGMT promoter.

Almost all human cancers include hypomethylation of LINE1 elements. Various studies depict that the hypomethylation of LINE1 correlates with a decrease in survival after both chemotherapy and radiotheraphy.

=== Treatment by DNMT inhibitors ===
[[DNA methyltransferase#DNMT inhibitors|DMNT inhibitors]] are being explored in the treatment of malignant tumors. Recent [[in-vitro]] studies show that DNMT inhibitors can increase the effects of other anti-cancer drugs. Knowledge of [[in-vivo]] effect of DNMT inhibitors are still being investigated. The long term effects of the use of DNMT inhibitors are still unknown.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A '''burn center''', '''burn unit''' or '''burns unit''' is a [[hospital]] specializing in the treatment of [[burn]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Burn Center|url=http://www.uwhealth.org/emergency-room/burn-center/10771|publisher= University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics Authority|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Johns Hopkins Burn Center|url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/burn|publisher=Johns Hopkins University|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burn centers are often used for the [[Therapy|treatment]] and [[Healing|recovery]] of patients with more severe burns.

The severity of a burn, and therefore whether a referral will be made after the patient is treated and stabilized, differs depending upon many factors, among them: the age of the victim (burns to infants and toddlers or to those over age 65 are generally more serious, particularly if the face, head, respiratory system, chest, abdomen, groin, or extremities are burned; those who are not in these age groups can be more affected if they are or were already ill, injured, or immunocompromised), the total [[body surface area]] that is burned (the [[Total body surface area|rule of nines]]), if proper treatment and referrals are delayed or the wrong treatments are given, if the burns are of the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th degree (the bigger and deeper, the worse it is), the source (if it was due to a chemical, or from a scald, or fire, or radiation, the treatment regimen has to be modified appropriately), or if skin grafting is not feasible and/or important organs are harmed. 

Burn centers needs a team approach for the management of critically burnt patient. Usually the burns management team consists of plastic surgeon, intensivist, chest physician, general surgeon, pediatrician, nurses and technicians, microbiologist, psychiatrist, nutritionist, physiotherapist and a social worker. Early burn wound excision and immediate wound cover can improve the chances of survival in major burn cases.

==Decriminalization==
From 2013, there is a distinction in the Croatian penal code between various illegal substances, they are now separated on heavy drugs and light drugs like cannabis. According to the law, growing or selling cannabis is considered a felony punishable by a [[mandatory prison sentence]] (three years minimum). From 2013, the possession of small amount of marijuana and other light drugs is a minor offence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encod.org/info/CROATIA-TO-DECRIMINALIZE-DRUG.html |title=Croatia To Decriminalize Drug Possession |publisher=ENCOD |date=1 August 2012 |accessdate=6 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817091744/http://www.encod.org/info/CROATIA-TO-DECRIMINALIZE-DRUG.html |archive-date=17 August 2012 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; which leads to a fine of 5000–20000[[Croatian kuna|kn]] (US$800–3500) depending on the case in question. 

==Medical cannabis==
As of 15 October 2015, the [[Ministry of Health (Croatia)|Ministry of Health]] officially legalized the use of cannabis-based drugs for medical purposes for patients with illnesses such as cancer, multiple sclerosis, or AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url =http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/croatia-first-balkan-county-to-legalize-medical-marijuana-10-15-2015-1|title=Croatia Legalises Marijuana for Medical Use|date=15 October 2015|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''''Cartel of the Suns''''' ({{lang-es|Cartel de los Soles}}) describes a [[Venezuela]]n organization allegedly headed by high-ranking members of the [[Armed Forces of Venezuela]] who are involved in international [[Illegal drug trade|drug trade]].&lt;ref name=CARTELsuns&gt;{{cite web|title=Cartel de los Soles|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/venezuela-organized-crime-news/cartel-de-los-soles-profile|website=InSightCrime|accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Héctor Landaeta, journalist and author of ''Chavismo, Narco-trafficking and the Military'', the phenomenon began when Colombian drugs began to enter into Venezuela from corrupt border units and the "rot moved its way up the ranks".&lt;ref name=MHjan27&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wyss|first1=Jim|title=Venezuela’s Maduro calls reports that Cabello faces drug charges ‘vulgar’|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/venezuela/article8232987.html|accessdate=1 February 2015|agency=Miami Herald|date=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{details|Illegal drug trade in Venezuela}}

Reports that members of the Venezuelan military&lt;ref&gt;http://revolucionemosanzoategui.blogspot.com/2007/04/el-general-ramn-guilln-dvila-i.html&lt;/ref&gt; were involved in drug trafficking began in the 1990s, though it was limited to taking payments and ignoring drug traffickers.&lt;ref name=CARTELsuns/&gt; It was alleged that officers of Hugo Chávez's [[Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200]] that planned the [[1992 Venezuelan coup d'état attempts]] had created a group that participated in drug trafficking that was known as the "Cartel Bolivariano" or "''Bolivarian Cartel''".&lt;ref name=CARTELsuns/&gt; Following the 1992 coup attempts, ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' noted that Venezuelan officers may have sought to take over the government since there was "money to be made from corruption, particularly in drugs".&lt;ref name="LA1992"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Freed|first1=Kenneth|last2=Long|first2=William R.|title=Regional Outlook Recession, Corruption Fuel Latin Coup Jitters the Region has made Enormous Progress Toward Democracy. but Decades of Military-Dominated History are Hard to Erase|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|issue=pp. 6|date=15 December 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the term "Cartel de los Soles" or "''Cartel of the Suns"'' was first used when allegations of two National Guard generals, who wore emblems that looked like suns on their uniforms, were investigated for drug trafficking crimes.&lt;ref name=CARTELsuns/&gt;

===Bolivarian government===
The "Cartel of the Suns" name returned in 2004 by reporter and city council member Mauro Marcano. Shortly before he was murdered, Marcano alleged that Alexis Maneiro, head of the National Guard and the [[National Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention Services|Dirección General de Inteligencia Militar]], was involved in drug trafficking.&lt;ref name="CARTELsuns" /&gt;

According to ''[[Vice News]]'', the Venezuelan government under [[Hugo Chavez]] expanded corruption to "unprecedented levels" in an already corrupt military.&lt;ref name=VICEdrugs/&gt; Chavez gave military officials millions of dollars for social programs that allegedly disappeared, also giving legal immunity to drug trafficking officials to maintain power and loyalty.&lt;ref name=VICEdrugs/&gt; When Chavez ousted the United States [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] in 2005, Venezuela became a more attractive route for drug trade.&lt;ref name=VICEdrugs/&gt; According to Colombian [[Intelligence agency|intelligence]], an arrested drug vigilante stated that "senior figures in President Hugo Chavez's security forces to arrange drug shipments through Venezuela".&lt;ref name=TELE2007&gt;{{cite news|last1=McDermott|first1=Jeremy|title=Venezuela is key link for the drug smugglers|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1557941/Venezuela-is-key-link-for-the-drug-smugglers.html|accessdate=1 February 2015|agency=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=19 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been alleged that the National Guard had worked with the [[FARC]] with drug trade.&lt;ref name=EPsol&gt;{{cite news|last=Mario Cárdenas|first=Hugo|title=FF.AA. venezolanas tienen cartel propio|url=http://historico.elpais.com.co/paisonline/notas/Julio232007/narco.html|accessdate=26 May 2014|newspaper=El Pais|date=23 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; British officials alleged that planes from Colombia would also be sheltered by Venezuelan Air Force bases.&lt;ref name=TELE2007/&gt;

==Incidents==
In September 2013, an incident allegedly linked to the Cartel of the Suns and involving men from the Venezuelan National Guard who placed 31 suitcases containing 1.3 tons of [[cocaine]] on an Air France flight astonished [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] authorities as it was the largest seizure of cocaine recorded in mainland [[France]].&lt;ref name=VICEdrugs&gt;{{cite news|last=al-Ameri|first=Alaa|title=Venezuela's Drug-Running Generals May Be Who Finally Ousts Maduro|url=https://news.vice.com/article/venezuelas-drug-running-generals-may-be-who-finally-ousts-maduro|accessdate=26 May 2014|newspaper=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice News]]|date=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ELPAISdrugs"&gt;{{cite news|last=Meza|first=Alfredo|title=Corrupt military officials helping Venezuela drug trade flourish|url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/09/26/inenglish/1380217098_793793.html|accessdate=18 March 2014|newspaper=El Pais|date=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 February 2014, a commander for the Venezuelan National Guard was stopped while driving to [[Valencia, Carabobo|Valencia]] with his family and was arrested for having 554 kilos of cocaine in his possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanchez|first=Nora|title=Detienen a comandante de la Milicia con cargamento de drogas|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/sucesos/140215/detienen-a-comandante-de-la-milicia-con-cargamento-de-drogas|accessdate=20 April 2014|newspaper=El Universal|date=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 November 2015, DEA agents arrested two relatives (an adopted son and a nephew) of Venezuelan president [[Nicolás Maduro]] while trying to move 800 kilograms of cocaine from Venezuela to the USA, a source from DEA stated unofficially that there is no way that the huge amount of cocaine that passes through Venezuela does it without high levels of corruption in the government.&lt;ref&gt;http://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2015/11/11/autoridades-de-ee-uu-detienen-a-dos-familiares-de-la-primera-dama-de-venezuela/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
There are groups within the branches of the Armed Forces of Venezuela such as the [[Venezuelan Army]], [[Venezuelan Navy]], [[Venezuelan Air Force]], and [[Venezuelan National Guard]]; from the lowest to the highest levels of personnel.&lt;ref name=CARTELsuns/&gt;

===Low-level personnel===
Allegedly, lower ranking National Guardsmen compete for positions at border checkpoints so they can be paid bribes for "illicit trade", though a large portion of bribes go to their superiors.&lt;ref name=CGviolence&gt;{{cite web|title=VIOLENCE AND POLITICS IN VENEZUELA|url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/latin-america/venezuela/38%20Violence%20and%20Politics%20in%20Venezuela.pdf|work=Report|publisher=International Crisis Group|accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegedly, the corrupt officials of the Cartel of the Suns traffic drugs from [[Colombia]] to Venezuela where they are shipped internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Every last gram of cocaine is soaked with innocent blood'|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland/top-stories/every-last-gram-of-cocaine-is-soaked-with-innocent-blood-1-746724|accessdate=26 May 2014|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=14 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High-level officials===

==== Nicolás Maduro ====
President of Venezuela [[Nicolás Maduro]] has personally promoted individuals accused of drug trafficking to high positions of the Venezuelan government.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Venezuela: A Mafia State?|last=|first=|publisher=[[InSight Crime]]|year=2018|isbn=|location=[[Medellin, Colombia]]|pages=3-84}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2018, he was said to have received drug trafficking profits from Diosdado Cabello.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Diosdado Cabello====
In January 2015, the former security chief of both Hugo Chavez and [[Diosdado Cabello]], [[Leamsy Salazar]], made accusations that Cabello was head of the Cartel of the Suns.&lt;ref name=ENHjan2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maria Delgado|first1=Antonio|title=Identifican a Diosdado Cabello como jefe del Cartel de los Soles|url=http://www.elnuevoherald.com/noticias/mundo/america-latina/venezuela-es/article8206548.html|accessdate=27 January 2015|agency=El Nuevo Herald|date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABCjan2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blasco|first1=Emili J.|title=El jefe de seguridad del número dos chavista deserta a EE.UU. y le acusa de narcotráfico|url=http://www.abc.es/internacional/20150127/abci-venezuela-cabello-eeuu-201501262129.html|accessdate=27 January 2015|agency=[[ABC (Spain)|ABC]]|date=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salazar was placed in [[witness protection]], fleeing to the United States with assistance of the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]]'s [[Drug Enforcement Administration#Special Operations Division|Special Operations Division]] after cooperating with the administration and providing possible details on Cabello's involvement with international drug trade.&lt;ref name=ENHjan2015/&gt; Salazar stated that he saw Cabello give orders on transporting tons of cocaine.&lt;ref name=ABCjan2015/&gt; The shipments of drugs were reportedly sent from the FARC in Colombia to the United States and Europe, with the possible assistance of Cuba.&lt;ref name=ENHjan2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABCjan2015/&gt; The alleged international drug operation had possibly involved other senior members of Venezuela's government as well, such as [[Tarek El Aissami]] and [[José David Cabello]], Diosdado's brother.&lt;ref name=ENHjan2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABCjan2015/&gt;

On 18 May 2018, the [[Office of Foreign Assets Control|Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)]] of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] placed sanctions in effect against Cabello, his wife, his brother and his "testaferro" Rafael Sarria. OFAC stated that Cabello and others used their power within the Bolivarian government "to personally profit from extortion, money laundering, and embezzlement", with Cabello allegedly directing drug trafficking activities with Vice President of Venezuela, [[Tareck El Aissami]] while dividing profits with President Nicolás Maduro. The Office also stated that Cabello would use public information to track wealth individuals who were potentially drug trafficking and steal their drugs and property in order to get rid of potential competition.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0389|title=Treasury Targets Influential Former Venezuelan Official and His Corruption Network|last=|first=|date=18 May 2018|website=[[Office of Foreign Assets Control]]|publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tareck El Aissami ====
Tareck El Aissami was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department on 13 February 2017 under the [[Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;after being accused of facilitating drug shipments from Venezuela to Mexico and the United States, freezing tens of millions of dollars of assets purportedly under El Aissami's control.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/02/14/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-2142017-12|title=Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, 2/14/2017, #12|date=14 February 2017|website=White House|language=en|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/a95c0636-f247-11e6-8758-6876151821a6|title=US labels Venezuelan vice-president a drug kingpin|last=Lynch|first=|last2=Sevastopulo|date=14 February 2017|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-15|last3=Schipani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Néstor Reverol ====
Head of the [[Venezuelan National Guard|Bolivarian National Guard]], [[Néstor Reverol]], has been indicted by the United States government of assisting with drug trafficking in Venezuela.

===FARC===
{{main|Corruption in Venezuela#FARC}}
In 2005, all branches of the [[National Bolivarian Armed Forces of Venezuela]] were given the duty to combat drug trafficking in Venezuela, granting data once held only by the Bolivarian National Guard to the army, navy and air force. Mildred Camero, former anti-drug official of the Chávez government, stated that this data created competition within the ranks of the military who fought to make deals with the FARC to actively partake in drug trafficking.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Authorities in [[Colombia]] stated that through laptops they had seized on a raid against [[Raul Reyes]] in 2007, they found documents purporting to show that Hugo Chávez offered payments of as much as $300 million to the [[FARC]] "among other financial and political ties that date back years" and documents showing the FARC rebels sought Venezuelan assistance in acquiring surface-to-air missiles, alleging that Chavez met personally with FARC rebel leaders.&lt;ref name="Padgett"&gt;{{cite news|last=Padgett|first=Tim|title=Chávez and the Cash-Filled Suitcase|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1838145,00.html|accessdate=28 March 2014|newspaper=TIME|date=3 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FARCrafael"&gt;{{cite web|title=FARC files 'show ties to Chavez'|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2011/05/20115115856153893.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USATODAYfarc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Colombia: Chavez funding FARC rebels|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-03-02-venezuelacolombia_N.htm?csp=34|accessdate=21 April 2014|newspaper=USA Today|date=4 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Interpol]], the files found by Colombian forces were considered to be authentic.&lt;ref name="INTERPOLfarc"&gt;{{cite news|last=Forero|first=Juan|title=FARC Computer Files Are Authentic, Interpol Probe Finds|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/15/AR2008051504153.html|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=6 March 2013|date=16 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the [[United States Department of Treasury]] accused two senior Venezuelan government officials and one former official of providing material assistance for drug-trafficking operations carried out by the FARC guerrilla group in Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Treasury Targets Venezuelan Government Officials Supporting the FARC|url = http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/hp1132.aspx|work = Press Release|publisher = United States Department of Treasury|accessdate = 5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, independent analyses of the documents by some U.S. academics and journalists have challenged the Colombian interpretation of the documents, accusing the Colombian government of exaggerating their contents.&lt;ref name="Palast, Greg"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gregpalast.com/300-million-from-chavez-to-farc-a-fake/ | title=$300 MILLION FROM CHAVEZ TO FARC A FAKE | publisher=Tomaine.com/Ourfuture.org | date=16 May 2008 | accessdate=2 August 2014 | author=Palast, Greg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/colombia/doc/paz/open.html | title=Interpol Analysis of FARC Laptop Authenticity Will Not "Prove" Links Between Venezuela, Rebels | publisher=derechos.org | date=25 April 2008 | accessdate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the Secretary General of the [[Organization of American States]], [[Jose Miguel Insulza]], testified before the U.S. Congress that "there are no evidences" that Venezuela is supporting "terrorist groups", including the FARC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.eluniversal.com/2008/04/10/en_pol_art_oas-insulza:-there_10A1509639|title = OAS' INSULZA: THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF VENEZUELAN SUPPORT TO TERRORISTS|publisher = El Universal|date = 10 April 2008|accessdate = 2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later in 2011, the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] (IISS) concluded that Chavez's government funded FARC's Caracas office and granted it access to intelligence services. Venezuelan diplomats denounced the IISS' findings saying that they had "basic inaccuracies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/americas/05/10/venezuela.farc.documents/index.html|title=Study: Colombian rebels were willing to kill for Venezuela's Chavez|last=Martinez|first=Michael|date=10 May 2011|newspaper=CNN|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nevertheless, as of 2018, [[FARC dissidents]] who left FARC when it disbanded in 2017 still operate within Venezuela with virtual impunity. These dissident forces, with armed personnel numbering up to 2,500 individuals, allegedly still cooperate with the Cartel of the Suns.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

A '''cool store''' or '''cold store''' is a large [[refrigeration|refrigerated]] room or building designed for storage of goods in an environment below the outdoor temperature. Products needing refrigeration include [[fruit]], [[vegetable]]s, [[seafood]] and [[meat]]. Cold stores are often located near [[shipping port]]s used for import/export of produce.

Cool stores have been an essential part of the shipping industry since the late 19th century. [[Christian Salvesen]] expanded from a small Scottish whaling company when they established a cold store in [[Grimsby]], then a major fishing port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/15963682.Obituary___Sir_Gerald_Elliot__former_chairman_of_Christian_Salvesen_and_patron_of_the_arts_in_Scotland/|title=Obituary - Sir Gerald Elliot, former chairman of Christian Salvesen and patron of the arts in Scotland|newspaper=Herald Scotland|date=8 February 2018|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine Elms Cold Store, constructed in 1965, could hold 16,000 tons of meat, cheese and butter. It closed in 1979 and was used by squatters and various illegal activities before being demolished towards the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.timeout.com/london/blog/16-creepy-london-stories-to-get-you-in-the-mood-for-halloween-103116|title=16 creepy London stories to get you in the mood for Halloween|first=Andy|last=Hill|work=Time Out|date=31 October 2016|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stores themselves vary in size. A thirty hectare (74 acre) cold store with 200,000 tonne capacity was planned for [[Wuhan, China]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8652">'''Cost-effectiveness analysis''' ('''CEA''') is a form of [[economic]] [[financial analysis|analysis]] that compares the relative costs and outcomes (effects) of different courses of action.  Cost-effectiveness analysis is distinct from [[cost–benefit analysis]], which assigns a monetary value to the measure of effect.&lt;ref name=CEAvCBA&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bleichrodt H, Quiggin J |title=Life-cycle preferences over consumption and health: when is cost-effectiveness analysis equivalent to cost-benefit analysis? |journal=J Health Econ |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=681–708 |date=December 1999 |pmid=10847930 |doi= 10.1016/S0167-6296(99)00014-4|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cost-effectiveness analysis is often used in the field of health services, where it may be inappropriate to [[monetize]] health effect.  Typically the CEA is expressed in terms of a ratio where the denominator is a gain in health from a measure (years of life, premature births averted, sight-years gained) and the numerator is the cost associated with the health gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Gold MR | title = Cost-effectiveness in health and medicine | page = xviii|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most commonly used outcome measure is [[quality-adjusted life year]]s (QALY).&lt;ref name=CEAvCBA/&gt;

[[Cost-utility analysis]] is similar to cost-effectiveness analysis. Cost-effectiveness analyses are often visualized on a plane consisting of [[Quadrant (plane geometry)|four-quadrants]], the cost represented on one axis and the effectiveness on the other axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Black|first=William|title=A Graphical Representation of Cost-Effectiveness.|journal=Med Decis Making|year=1990|volume=10|issue=3|pages=212–214|doi=10.1177/0272989x9001000308}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cost-effectiveness analysis focuses on maximising the average level of an outcome, [[distributional cost-effectiveness analysis]] extends the core methods of CEA to incorporate concerns for the distribution of outcomes as well as their average level and make trade-offs between equity and efficiency, these more sophisticated methods are of particular interest when analysing interventions to tackle [[health inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Asaria|first1=M|last2=Griffin|first2=S|last3=Cookson|first3=R|title=Distributional Cost-Effectiveness Analysis: A Tutorial.|journal=Medical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making|date=January 2016|volume=36|issue=1|pages=8–19|pmid=25908564|doi=10.1177/0272989x15583266|pmc=4853814}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Asaria|first1=M|last2=Griffin|first2=S|last3=Cookson|first3=R|last4=Whyte|first4=S|last5=Tappenden|first5=P|title=Distributional cost-effectiveness analysis of health care programmes--a methodological case study of the UK Bowel Cancer Screening Programme.|journal=Health economics|date=June 2015|volume=24|issue=6|pages=742–54|pmid=24798212|doi=10.1002/hec.3058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

The concept of cost-effectiveness is applied to the planning and management of many types of organized activity. It is widely used in many aspects of life. In the acquisition of military [[tank]]s, for example, competing designs are compared not only for purchase price, but also for such factors as their operating [[radius]], top speed, [[rate of fire]], armor protection, and caliber and armor [[penetration (weapons)|penetration]] of their guns. If a tank's performance in these areas is equal or even slightly inferior to its competitor, but substantially less expensive and easier to produce, military planners may select it as more cost effective than the competitor.

Conversely, if the difference in price is near zero, but the more costly competitor would convey an enormous battlefield advantage through special ammunition, [[radar]] [[Fire-control system|fire control]] and [[laser]] [[range finding]], enabling it to destroy enemy tanks accurately at extreme ranges, military planners may choose it instead—based on the same cost-effectiveness principle.

===In pharmacoeconomics===

In the context of [[pharmacoeconomics]], the cost-effectiveness of a therapeutic or preventive intervention is the ratio of the cost of the intervention to a relevant measure of its effect. Cost refers to the resource expended for the intervention, usually measured in monetary terms such as [[dollar]]s or [[pound sterling|pounds]]. The measure of effects depends on the intervention being considered. Examples include the number of people cured of a disease, the mm Hg reduction in diastolic [[blood pressure]] and the number of symptom-free days experienced by a patient. The selection of the appropriate effect measure should be based on clinical judgment in the context of the intervention being considered.

A special case of CEA is [[cost–utility analysis]], where the effects are measured in terms of years of full health lived, using a measure such as [[quality-adjusted life year]]s or [[disability-adjusted life year]]s. Cost-effectiveness is typically expressed as an [[incremental cost-effectiveness ratio]] (ICER), the ratio of change in costs to the change in effects. A complete compilation of cost-utility analyses in the peer reviewed medical literature is available from the [[Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry]] website.

A 1995 study of the cost-effectiveness of over 500 life-saving medical interventions found that the median cost per intervention was $42,000 per life-year saved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tengs TO, Adams ME, Pliskin JS |title=Five-hundred life-saving interventions and their cost-effectiveness |journal=Risk Anal. |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=369–90 |date=June 1995 |pmid=7604170 |doi= 10.1111/j.1539-6924.1995.tb00330.x|url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 systematic review found that industry-funded studies often concluded with cost effective ratios below $20,000 per QALY and low quality studies and those conducted outside the US and EU were less likely to be below this threshold. While the two conclusions of this article may indicate that industry-funded ICER measures are lower methodological quality than those published by non-industry sources, there is also a possibility that, due to the nature of retrospective or other non-public work, publication bias may exist rather than methodology biases. There may be incentive for an organization not to develop or publish an analysis that does not demonstrate the value of their product. Additionally, peer reviewed journal articles should have a strong and defendable methodology, as that is the expectation of the peer-review process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bell CM, Urbach DR, Ray JG |title=Bias in published cost effectiveness studies: systematic review.|journal=BMJ |volume=332 |issue=7543 |pages=699–703 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16495332 |pmc=1410902 |doi=10.1136/bmj.38737.607558.80 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In energy efficiency investments===
CEA has been applied to [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] investments in buildings to calculate the value of energy saved in $/kWh. The energy in such a calculation is virtual in the sense that it was never consumed but rather saved due to some energy efficiency investment being made. Such savings are sometimes called ''[[negawatt]]s''. The benefit of the CEA approach in energy systems is that it avoids the need to guess future energy prices for the purposes of the calculation, thus removing the major source of uncertainty in the appraisal of energy efficiency investments.&lt;ref&gt;Pekka Tuominen, Francesco Reda, Waled Dawoud, Bahaa Elboshy, Ghada Elshafei, Abdelazim Negm: [http://doi.org/10.1016/S2212-5671(15)00195-1 Economic Appraisal of Energy Efficiency in Buildings Using Cost-effectiveness Assessment].

Developmental biology and embryology provides the basic knowledge of the cell types' differentiation through [[mutation]] analysis, lineage tracing, embryo micro-manipulation and [[gene expression]] studies. Cell differentiation and tissue [[organogenesis]] involve a  limited set of [[Signaling pathways|developmental signaling pathways]].&lt;ref name="nih3"/&gt; It is thus possible to direct cell fate by controlling cell decisions through extracellular signaling, mimicking developmental signals.

==Source material==
''Directed differentiation'' is primarily applied to [[pluripotent stem cell]]s (PSCs) of mammalian origin, in particular mouse and human cells for [[biomedical research]] applications.&lt;ref name="cshlp"/&gt;  Since the discovery of [[Embryonic stem cells|embryonic stem]] (ES) cells (1981) and [[Induced pluripotent stem cells|induced pluripotent stem]] (iPS) cells (2006), source material is potentially unlimited.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nih3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nih4"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Investigating human disease using stem cell models|publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information|vauthors=Sterneckert JL, Reinhardt P, Schöler HR|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|volume=15|issue=9|pages=625–639|year=2014|doi=10.1038/nrg3764|pmid=25069490}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Historically, [[P19 cell|embryonic carcinoma]] (EC) cells have also been used.&lt;ref name="nih5"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Retinoic acid induces embryonal carcinoma cells to differentiate into neurons and glial cells|publisher=The Rockefeller University Press|pmid=7107698|pmc=2112882|vauthors=Jones-Villeneuve EM, McBurney MW, Rogers KA, Kalnins VI|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|year=1982|volume=94|issue=2|pages=253–262|doi=10.1083/jcb.94.2.253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fibroblasts or other differentiated cell types have been used for [[Examples of in vitro transdifferentiation by lineage-instructive approach|direct reprogramming]] strategies.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;

==Methods==
Cell differentiation involves a transition from a proliferative mode toward differentiation mode. ''Directed differentiation'' consists in mimicking developmental (embryo's development) decisions in vitro using the stem cells as source material.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt; For this purpose, pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are cultured in controlled conditions involving specific substrate or [[extracellular matrices]] promoting cell adhesion and differentiation, and define [[Chemically defined medium|culture media]] compositions.&lt;ref name="nih3"/&gt; A limited number of signaling factors such as [[growth factors]] or [[small molecules]], controlling cell differentiation, is applied sequentially or in a combinatorial manner, at varying [[Dose (biochemistry)|dosage]] and exposure time.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt; Proper differentiation of the cell type of interest is verified by analyzing  [[Biomarker|cell type specific markers]], [[gene expression]] profile, and functional assays.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;

===Early methods===
* co-culture with [[stromal cells]] or [[feeder cell]]s, and on specific culture substrates:
support cells and matrices provide developmental-like environmental signals.&lt;ref name="nih6"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Embryonic stem-cell culture as a tool for developmental cell biology|publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information|pmid=17522593|vauthors=Nishikawa S, Jakt LM, Era T|journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology|volume=8|issue=6|pages=502–507|year=2007| doi=10.1038/nrm2189}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 3D cell aggregate formation, termed [[Embryoid body|embryoid bodies]] (EBs): the aggregate aim at mimicking early embryonic development and instructing the cell differentiation.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cshlp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nih6"/&gt;
* culture in presence of [[fetal bovine serum]], removal of pluripotency factors.

===Current methodologies===

====Directed differentiation====
This method consists in exposing the cells to specific signaling pathways modulators and  manipulating cell culture conditions (environmental or exogenous) to mimick the natural sequence of developmental decisions to produce a given cell type/tissue.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nih6"/&gt; A drawback of this approach is the necessity to have a good understanding of how the
cell type of interest is formed.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;

====Direct reprogramming====
This method, also known as [[transdifferentiation]] or direct conversion, consists in overexpressing one or several factors, usually transcription factors, introduced in the cells.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt; The starting material can be either pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), or either differentiated cell type such as fibroblasts. The principle was first demonstrated in 1987 with the myogenic factors MyoD.&lt;ref name="nih7"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Expression of a single transfected cDNA converts fibroblasts to myoblasts.
|vauthors=Davis RL, Weintraub H, Lassar AB|journal=Cell|volume=51|issue=6|pages=987–1000|year=1987|publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information|pmid=3690668|doi=10.1016/0092-8674(87)90585-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A drawback of this approach is the introduction of foreign nucleic acid in the cells and the forced expression of transcription factors which effects are not fully understood.

====Lineage/cell type-specific selection====
This methods consists in selecting the cell type of interest, usually with [[antibiotic resistance]]. For this purpose, the source material cells are modified to contain antibiotic resistance cassette under a target cell type specific [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]].&lt;ref name="nih8"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Endothelial cells genetically selected from differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells incorporate at sites of neovascularization in vivo|publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information|pmid=11973349|doi=|journal=Journal of Cell Science|year=2002|volume=115|issue=Pt 10|pages=2075–2085|vauthors=Marchetti S, Gimond C, Iljin K, Bourcier C, Alitalo K, Pouysségur J, Pagès G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nih9"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Genetically selected cardiomyocytes from differentiating embronic stem cells form stable intracardiac grafts|publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information|vauthors=Klug MG, Soonpaa MH, Koh GY, Field LJ|pmid=8690796|pmc=507419|doi=10.1172/JCI118769|journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation|year=1996|volume=98|issue=1|pages=216–224.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only cells committed to the lineage of interest is surviving the [[Selection (biology)|selection]].

==Applications==
''Directed differentiation'' provides a potentially unlimited and manipulable source of cell and tissues.
Some applications are impaired by the [[Developmental biology|immature phenotype]] of the pluripotent stem cells (PSCs)-derived cell type, which limits the physiological and functional studies possible.&lt;ref name="nih4"/&gt;
Several application domains emerged:

===Model system for basic science===
For [[basic science]], notably [[developmental biology]] and [[cell biology]], [[Stem cell|PSC]]-derived cells allow to study at the molecular and cellular levels fundamental questions in vitro,&lt;ref name="cshlp"/&gt; that would have been otherwise extremely difficult or impossible to study for technical and ethical reasons in vivo such as embryonic development of human. In particular, differentiating cells are amenable for quantitative and qualitative studies.&lt;ref name="nih6"/&gt;
More complex processes can also be studied in vitro and formation of organoids, including cerebroids, [[Optic cup (embryology)|optic cup]] and [[kidney]] have been described.

===[[Drug discovery]] and [[toxicology]]===
Cell types differentiated from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are being evaluated as [[preclinical]] in vitro models of Human diseases.&lt;ref name="cshlp"/&gt; Human cell types in a dish provide an alternative to traditional preclinical assays using animal, human [[immortalized cells]] or primary cultures from [[biopsies]], which their limitations. Clinically-relevant cell types i.e. cell type affected in diseases are a major focus of research, this includes [[hepatocytes]], [[Islets of Langerhans|Langerhans islet]] [[beta-cells]],&lt;ref name="nih10"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Differentiation of embryonic stem cells to insulin-secreting structures similar to pancreatic islets|vauthors=Lumelsky N, Blondel O, Laeng P, Velasco I, Ravin R, McKay R|journal=Science|year=2001|
volume=292|issue=5520|pages=1389–1394|doi=10.1126/science.1058866|publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information|pmid=11326082}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cardiomyocytes]] and  [[neurons]]. [[Drug screen]] are performed on miniaturized cell culture in multiwell-plates or on a chip.&lt;ref name="nih4"/&gt;

===Disease modeling===
PSCs-derived cells from patients are used in vitro to recreate specific pathologies.&lt;ref name="nih4"/&gt; The specific cell type affected in the pathology is at the base of the model. For example, motoneurons are used to study [[spinal muscular atrophy]] (SMA) and cardiomyocytes&lt;ref name="cell"/&gt; are used to study [[arrythmia]]. This can allow for a better understanding of the [[pathogenesis]] and the development of new treatments through drug discovery.&lt;ref name="nih4"/&gt; Immature PSC-derived cell types can be matured in vitro by various strategies, such as [[in vitro ageing]], to modelize age-related disease in vitro.
Major diseases being modelized with PSCs-derived cells are [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), [[Alzheimer's]] (AD), [[Parkinson's]] (PD), [[fragile X syndrome]] (FXS), [[Huntington disease]] (HD), [[Down syndrome]], Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), [[muscular dystrophies]],&lt;ref name="pmid26237517"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Chal J, Oginuma M, Al Tanoury Z, Gobert B, Sumara O, Hick A, Bousson F, Zidouni Y, Mursch C, Moncuquet P, Tassy O, Vincent S, Miyanari A, Bera A, Garnier JM, Guevara G, Hestin M, Kennedy L, Hayashi S, Drayton B, Cherrier T, Gayraud-Morel B, Gussoni E, Relaix F, Tajbakhsh S, Pourquié O|title = Differentiation of pluripotent stem cells to muscle fiber to model Duchenne muscular dystrophy |journal = [[Nat.

===Regenerative medicine===
The potentially unlimited source of cell and tissues may have direct application for [[tissue engineering]], cell replacement and [[organ transplantation|transplantation]] following acute injuries and [[reconstructive surgery]].&lt;ref name="cell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cshlp"/&gt; These applications are limited to the cell types that can be differentiated efficiently and safely from human PSCs with the proper [[organogenesis]].&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt; Decellularized organs are also being used as tissue scaffold for organogenesis. Source material can be normal healthy cells from another donor (heterologous transplantation) or genetically corrected from the same patient (autologous).
Concerns on  patient safety have been raised due to the possibility of contaminating undifferentiated cells. The first clinical trial using hESC-derived cells was in 2011.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/first-test-of-human-embryonic-stem-cell-therapy-in-people-discontinued/2011/11/14/gIQAQBTOMN_story.html|title=First test of human embryonic stem cell therapy in people discontinued - The Washington Post|publisher=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=2014-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first clinical trial using hiPSC-derived cells started in 2014 in Japan.&lt;ref name="japantimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/09/12/national/science-health/japanese-ips-based-retina-transplant-a-global-first/#.VFmnIBZ5fYE|title=Japanese team first to use iPS cells in bid to restore human sight &amp;#124; The Japan Times|publisher=japantimes.co.jp|accessdate=2014-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates for the prevalence of '''disability in Indonesia''' vary widely based on criteria. The 2010 Indonesian census reports that only 4.29% of Indonesians have disabilities, with a rate of 3.94% among men and 4.64% among women.&lt;ref name=tnp2k&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adioetomo|first1=Sri Moertiningsih|title=Persons with Disabilities in Indonesia: Empirical Facts and Implications for Social Protection Policies|url=http://www.tnp2k.go.id/images/uploads/downloads/Disabilities%20report%20Final%20sept2014%20%281%29.pdf|publisher=The National Team for the Acceleration of Poverty Reduction|accessdate=21 November 2015|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from the 2007 Riskesdas household survey, by contrast, based on a definition of having a lot of difficulty in at least one functional domain, gives a rate of disability of 11.05%, with 9.40% for males and 12.57% for females.&lt;ref name="tnp2k" /&gt; Both sets of data show rates of disability rising significantly with age.

Indonesia is a party to the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], having signed the treaty on 30 March 2007 and ratified it on 30 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-15&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |title=UN Treaty Collection: parties to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities: List of parties |publisher=United Nations |date=2012-03-21 |accessdate=2015-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819033725/http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-15&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |archivedate=2012-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16199">In medical research, a '''dynamic treatment regime''' (DTR), '''adaptive intervention,''' or '''adaptive treatment strategy''' is a set of rules for choosing effective treatments for individual patients.&lt;ref name=Lei2012&gt;{{Citation| last = Lei | first = H. | last2 = Nahum-Shani | first2 = I. | last3 = Lynch | first3 = K.  | last4 = Oslin | first4 = D.| last5 = Murphy | first5 = S.

A dynamic treatment regime is analogous to a ''policy'' in the field of [[reinforcement learning]], and analogous to a [[Controller (control theory)|controller]] in [[control theory]].  While most work on dynamic treatment regimes has been done in the context of medicine, the same ideas apply to time-varying policies in other fields, such as education, marketing, and economics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="70641">The '''environmental impact of meat production''' varies because of the wide variety of [[Agriculture|agricultural]] practices employed around the world. All agricultural practices have been found to have [[environmental impact of agriculture|a variety of effects on the environment]]. Some of the environmental effects that have been associated with [[meat production]] are [[pollution]] through [[fossil fuel]] usage, animal methane, effluent waste, and water and [[land consumption]]. Meat is obtained through a variety of methods, including [[organic farming]], [[Free range|free range farming]], [[Intensive animal farming|intensive livestock production]], [[subsistence agriculture]], [[hunting]], and [[fishing]].

The 2006 report ''[[Livestock's Long Shadow]]'', released by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) of the [[United Nations]], states that "the livestock sector is a major stressor on many ecosystems and on the planet as a whole. Globally it is one of the largest sources of [[greenhouse gas]]es (GHG) and one of the leading causal factors in the loss of [[biodiversity]], while in developed and emerging countries it is perhaps the leading source of [[water pollution]]."&lt;ref name=Steinfeld2006&gt;{{Citation |last= Steinfeld|first= Henning|last2= Gerber|first2= Pierre|last3= Wassenaar|first3= Tom|last4= Castel|first4= Vincent|last5= Rosales|first5= Mauricio|last6= de Haan|first6= Cees|year= 2006|title= Livestock's Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options|publisher= FAO|publication-place= Rome|page= |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/climatechange/doc/FAO%20report%20executive%20summary.pdf |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Removing all US agricultural animals would reduce [[Greenhouse gas emissions by the United States|US greenhouse gas emissions]] by 2.6%.&lt;ref name=pnas/&gt; (In this and much other FAO usage, but not always elsewhere, [[poultry]] are included as "livestock".)

==Consumption and production trends==
Changes in demand for meat may change the environmental impact of meat production by influencing how much meat is produced. It has been estimated that global meat consumption may double from 2000 to 2050, mostly as a consequence of increasing world population, but also partly because of increased per capita meat consumption (with much of the per capita consumption increase occurring in the developing world).&lt;ref name=FAOGPU2006&gt;FAO. 2006. World agriculture: towards 2030/2050. Prospects for food, nutrition, agriculture and major commodity groups. Interim report. Global Perspectives Unit, United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. 71 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Global production and consumption of [[poultry]] meat have recently been growing at more than 5 percent annually.&lt;ref name=FAOGPU2006/&gt; Trends vary among livestock sectors. For example, global per capita consumption of [[pork]] has increased recently (almost entirely due to changes in consumption within China), while global per capita consumption of [[ruminant]] meats has been declining.&lt;ref name=FAOGPU2006/&gt;

==Grazing and land use==
[[File:Two cows grazing.jpg|thumb|Dryland grazing on the [[Great Plains]] in [[Colorado]].]]

In comparison with [[grazing]], intensive livestock production requires large quantities of harvested feed, this overproduction of feed can also hold negative effects. The growing of [[cereal]]s for feed in turn requires substantial areas of land. However, where grain is fed, less feed is required for meat production. This is due not only to the higher concentration of metabolizable energy in grain than in roughages, but also to the higher ratio of net energy of gain to net energy of maintenance where metabolizable energy intake is higher.&lt;ref name=NRC2000&gt;National Research Council. 2000. Nutrient Requirements of Beef Cattle. National Academy Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It takes seven pounds of feed to produce a pound of [[beef]] (live weight), compared to more than three pounds for a pound of pork and less than two pounds for a pound of chicken.&lt;ref name="sm201206"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-the-chicken-conquered-the-world-87583657/ | title=How the Chicken Conquered the World | work=Smithsonian | date=June 2012 | accessdate=April 19, 2015 |author1=Adler, Jerry |author2=Lawler, Andrew }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, assumptions about feed quality are implicit in such generalizations. For example, production of a pound of beef cattle live weight may require between 4 and 5 pounds of feed high in protein and metabolizable energy content, or more than 20 pounds of feed of much lower quality.&lt;ref name=NRC2000/&gt;

Free-range animal production requires land for grazing, which in some places has led to land use change. According to FAO, "Ranching-induced [[deforestation]] is one of the main causes of loss of some unique plant and animal species in the tropical rainforests of Central and South America as well as carbon release in the atmosphere."&lt;ref name=fao2005&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2005/102924/ |title=Cattle ranching is encroaching on forests in Latin America |publisher=Fao.org |date=2005-06-08 |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has implications for—among other things—meat consumption in Europe, which imports significant amounts of feed from Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewg.org/meateatersguide/a-meat-eaters-guide-to-climate-change-health-what-you-eat-matters/reducing-your-footprint/ |title=Reducing Your Footprint - 2011 Meat Eaters Guide &amp;#124; Meat Eater's Guide to Climate Change + Health &amp;#124; Environmental Working Group |publisher=Ewg.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raising animals for human consumption accounts for approximately 40% of the total amount of agricultural output in industrialized countries. Grazing occupies 26% of the earth's ice-free terrestrial surface, and feed crop production uses about one third of all arable land.&lt;ref name=Steinfeld2006/&gt;

Land quality decline is sometimes associated with [[overgrazing]], as these animals are removing much needed nutrients from the soil without the land having time to recover. Rangeland health classification reflects soil and site stability, hydrologic function, and biotic integrity.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council. 1994. Rangeland Health. New Methods to Classify, Inventory and Monitor Rangelands. Nat. Acad. Press. 182 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2002, the US [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM) had evaluated rangeland health on 7,437 grazing allotments (i.e., 35 percent of its grazing allotments or 36 percent of the land area contained in its grazing allotments) and found that 16 percent of these failed to meet rangeland health standards due to existing grazing practices or levels of grazing use. This led the BLM to infer that a similar percentage would be obtained when such evaluations were completed.&lt;ref&gt;US BLM. 2004. Proposed Revisions to Grazing Regulations for the Public Lands. FES 04-39&lt;/ref&gt; Soil [[erosion]] associated with [[overgrazing]] is an important issue in many dry regions of the world.&lt;ref name=Steinfeld2006/&gt; However, on US farmland, much less soil erosion is associated with pastureland used for livestock grazing than with land used for production of crops. Sheet and rill erosion is within estimated soil loss tolerance on 95.1 percent, and wind erosion is within estimated soil loss tolerance on 99.4 percent of US pastureland inventoried by the US [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]].&lt;ref&gt;NRCS. 2009. Summary report 2007 national resources inventory. USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service. 123 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bovine Connection to Increasing Atmospheric Greenhouse Gases ==
[[Ruminant|Ruminants]] have a four-compartment stomach that contains microbes. [[Microorganism|Microbes]] aid in the digestion of food. Some of these microbes ([[Methanogen|methanogenic archaea]]) produce methane as a metabolic byproduct. When the [[Bovinae|bovine]] ingests the food, the food travels to the rumen where microbes begin breaking down the roughage. The bovine then belches; this is when methane is first introduced to the atmosphere during this process. The food belched up is also known as cud. The cud is then swallowed where it is digested once more in the rumen before it enters the reticulum, omasum, abomasum, small intestine, and large intestine respectively. The remains exit where approximately 5% of the methane produced from cattle is emitted. This process is known as [[enteric fermentation]]. Enteric Fermentation occurs when methane is produced as cows' rumens digest carbohydrates through [[Fermentation|microbial fermentation]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://extension.umn.edu/dairy-nutrition/ruminant-digestive-system|title=The ruminant digestive system|website=extension.umn.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Methane makes up approximately 27% of rumen gases, carbon dioxide makes up approximately 66% of rumen gases, nitrogen makes up approximately 7% of rumen gases, and oxygen and hydrogen make up the remaining percentages. Animal waste contributes to 5% of methane sources available in the atmosphere while enteric fermentation makes up to 16% of all methane sources currently in the atmosphere. Together, that makes up 21% of the methane released into the atmosphere. Compare this percentage to the methane contribution of natural wetlands, which make up 22% of the methane released in the atmosphere. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://icp.giss.nasa.gov/education/methane/intro/cycle.html|title=GSS ICP: Global Methane Inventory|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

More methane is produced from cows' belching than from flatulence; approximately 95% of methane produced by bovines is from belching. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/do-cow-farts-actually-contribute-to-global-warming-1562144730|title=Do Cow Farts Actually Contribute to Global Warming?|last=TodayIFoundOut.com|first=Matt Blitz -|work=Gizmodo|access-date=2018-12-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methane is 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide and speeds up the [[Greenhouse effect|Greenhouse Effect]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.edf.org/climate/methane-other-important-greenhouse-gas|title=Methane: The other important greenhouse gas|work=Environmental Defense Fund|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greenhouse Effect is a process that warms Earth's surface and keeps the global temperature stable at 33°C by retaining a portion of greenhouse gases on Earth while releasing the rest back into space. As more methane and other greenhouse gases are introduced and held in the atmosphere or on Earth's surface, the global temperature will rise due to the fact that greenhouse gases absorb [[infrared radiation]], also known as heat. The methane concentration has been growing exponentially since 1984 and is projected to continue to do so. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://environmentcounts.org/upward-revision-of-methane-emissions-from-shale-gas-production-could-erode-natural-gas-cleaner-energy-advantage/|title=Upward revision of methane emissions from shale gas production could erode natural gas' cleaner energy advantage » Environment Counts|date=2017-06-30|work=Environment Counts|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Any deviation from the global temperature of 33°C will result in drastic [[Effects of climate change|effects in climate change]] such as a loss of biodiversity and more intense and unpredictable weather patterns. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/post/What_is_the_effects_of_global_warming|title=What is the effects of global warming?|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coastal erosion]] is also another effect of climate change which leads to loss of fertile land as the sea levels rise. The sporadic weather patterns and change in seasons will also lead to unpredictable farming patterns. Pests and [[Vector-borne disease|vector borne diseases]] will become more common and available as the global temperature rises. Growing seasons will become longer in cooler areas. 

Americans are one of the largest contributing groups to the excessive amounts of beef consumption worldwide. The United States is the fourth largest consumer of beef and the 16th largest consumer of dairy worldwide. Americans consume four times the world average of beef consumption. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wri.org/blog/2018/01/2018-will-see-high-meat-consumption-us-american-diet-shifting|title=2018 Will See High Meat Consumption in the U.S., but the American Diet is Shifting {{!}} World Resources Institute|website=www.wri.org|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On average, each American consumes around 600 pounds of beef and cow dairy products annually. The average American eats about 50 pounds of beef annually. 

There are some controllable ways to reduce the amount of methane released into the atmosphere. Improving the digestion of bovine will decrease the bovine's tendency to belch and release digestive gases through the anus, which emit methane into the atmosphere. One way is to grind the cattle feed to make it finer which leads the cow to take less time and energy to digest it, and as a result, less methane is produced in the process. Scientists have introduced garlic into cattle's diets; garlic inhibits the microorganisms in the intestines from producing methane. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Researchers at Penn State introduced [[3-Nitrooxypropanol|3-nitrooxypropanol]] to the cows' diets which suppresses the cows' ability to release methane but leads the cattle to gain weight since they are using less energy to digest their food. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://modernfarmer.com/2015/08/supplement-reduce-cow-produced-methane/|title=Scientists Discover a Way To Make Cows Fatter and Less Flatulent - Modern Farmer|date=2015-08-14|work=Modern Farmer|access-date=2018-12-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have been conducted in adding plants high in [[tannin]] to ruminants' diets which in turn effectively reduces their methane emissions. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; All potential solutions in reducing bovine's methane emissions have proved to not be cost efficient which inhibits current farmers and ranchers from adopting them.

Another way to reduce methane released in the atmosphere is to monitor dietary practices. If the demand for cattle decreases, then the supply of cattle will also decrease as a result. Reducing beef and dairy intake in one's diet decreases one's risk in developing diseases such as lung cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, diabetes, Alzheimers, and heart disease. Dairy contains high levels of saturated fats. For example, cheese is 70% saturated fat. Overall, the overconsumption of beef and dairy shortens one's lifespan. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcrm.org/good-nutrition/nutrition-information/health-concerns-about-dairy|title=Health Concerns About Dairy|work=Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine|access-date=2018-12-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicken, seafood, quinoa, tofu, mushrooms, lentils, nuts, and many other protein-rich foods are healthier alternative to beef. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mintel.com/press-centre/food-and-drink/meat-free-days-top-reason-for-protein-alternative-use|title=Meat-free days top reason for protein alternative use|website=Mintel|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatives that contain less saturated fats than cow milk include: almond milk, coconut milk, soy milk, rice milk, and hemp milk. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.breasthealth.org/plant-milks-101-a-guide-to-dairy-alternatives/|title=Plant Milks 101: A Guide to Dairy Alternatives {{!}} BreastHealth.org|date=2015-08-12|work=BreastHealth.org|access-date=2018-12-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being environmentally conscious when making dietary decisions as well as altering the cow's feed will effectively decrease bovine's methane emissions into the atmosphere.

Virtual water use for livestock production includes water used in producing feed.
However, virtual water use data, such as those shown in the table, are often unrelated to environmental impacts of water use. For example, in a high-rainfall area, if similar soil infiltration capacity is maintained across different land uses, mm of [[groundwater recharge]] and hence sustainability of water use tends to be about the same for food crop production, meat-yielding livestock production, and saddle horse production, although virtual water use per kg of food produced may be several hundred L, several thousand L, and an infinite number of L, respectively. In contrast, in some low-rainfall areas, some livestock production is more sustainable than food crop production, from a water use standpoint, despite higher virtual water use per kg of food produced. Unirrigated land in many water-short areas may support grassland ecosystems in perpetuity, and thus may be able to support well-managed production of grazing cattle or sheep with a sustainable level of water use, whereas more water-demanding food crops would be unsustainable in the long run due to inadequate surface water supplies and groundwater recharge to sustain a high level of irrigation. Such considerations are important on much rangeland in western North America and elsewhere that can support [[cow-calf operation]]s, backgrounding of stocker cattle, and sheep flocks. In the US, withdrawn surface water and groundwater use for crop irrigation exceeds that for livestock by about a ratio of 60:1.&lt;ref name=Kenny2009&gt;Kenny, J. F. et al. 2009. [http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/1344/pdf/c1344.pdf Estimated use of water in the United States in 2005], ''[[United States Geological Survey|US Geological Survey]] Circular'' 1344. 52 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the high virtual water use figures associated with meat production do not necessarily imply reduction of water use if food crops are produced, instead of livestock. For example, some grazing lands are unsuitable for food crop production, so that evapotranspirational water use would continue on land vacated by livestock, while additional water would be needed for crops to provide substituting food from lands elsewhere, and additional water would also be needed to produce substitutes for the non-food products of livestock. (In the US, Land Capability Classes V, VI and VII contain soils unsuited for cultivation, much of which is suitable for grazing. Of non-federal land in the US, about 43 percent is classed as unsuitable for cultivation.)

Irrigation accounts for about 37 percent of US withdrawn freshwater use, and groundwater provides about 42 percent of US irrigation water.&lt;ref name=Kenny2009/&gt; Irrigation water applied in production of livestock feed and forage has been estimated to account for about 9 percent of withdrawn freshwater use in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Zering, K.

However, rainfed agriculture, which cannot deplete its water source, produces much of the livestock feed in North America. Corn (maize) is of particular interest, accounting for about 91.8 percent of the grain fed to US livestock and poultry in 2010.&lt;ref name=USDA2011&gt;USDA. 2011. USDA Agricultural Statistics 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|table 1–75}} About 14 percent of US corn-for grain land is irrigated, accounting for about 17 percent of US corn-for-grain production, and about 13 percent of US irrigation water use,&lt;ref&gt;USDA 2010. 2007 Census of agriculture.

Table 1.&lt;/ref&gt; but only about 40 percent of US corn grain is fed to US livestock and poultry.&lt;ref name=USDA2011/&gt;{{rp|table 1–38}} Together, these figures indicate that most production of grain used for US livestock and poultry feed does not deplete water resources and that irrigated production of grain for livestock feed accounts for a small fraction of US irrigation water use. However, where production relies on irrigation from groundwater reserves, water table monitoring is appropriate to provide timely warning if groundwater depletion occurs.

==Effects on aquatic ecosystems==
In the [[Western United States]], many [[stream]] and riparian [[habitat]]s have been negatively affected by livestock grazing. This has resulted in increased [[phosphate]]s, [[nitrate]]s, decreased dissolved oxygen, increased temperature, [[turbidity]], and [[eutrophication]] events, and reduced [[species diversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Belsky | first1 = A.

==Greenhouse gas emissions==
[[Image:Farming-on-Indonesia.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Farmer ploughing [[rice paddy]], in [[Indonesia]]. Animals can provide a useful source of draught power to farmers in the [[developing world]]]]
At a global scale, the FAO has recently estimated that livestock (including poultry) accounts for about 14.5 percent of [[anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions]] estimated as 100-year CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents.&lt;ref name=Gerber2013&gt;Gerber, P. J., H. Steinfeld, B. Henderson, A. Mottet, C. Opio, J. Dijkman, A. Falcucci and G. Tempio. 2013. Tackling climate change through livestock - a global assessment of emissions and mitigation opportunities. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome. 115 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; A previous widely cited FAO report using somewhat more comprehensive analysis had estimated 18 percent.&lt;ref name=Steinfeld2006/&gt; Because this emission percentage includes contributions associated with livestock used for the production of draft power, eggs, wool and dairy products, the percentage attributable to meat production alone is significantly lower, as indicated by the report's data. The indirect effects contributing to the percentage include emissions associated with the production of feed consumed by livestock and carbon dioxide emission from deforestation in Central and South America, attributed to livestock production. Using a different sectoral assignment of emissions, the IPCC ([[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]) has estimated that agriculture (including not only livestock, but also food crop, biofuel and other production) accounted for about 10 to 12 percent of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (expressed as 100-year carbon dioxide equivalents) in 2005&lt;ref&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 2007. Climate change 2007, Mitigation of climate change. [[Fourth Assessment Report]]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010.&lt;ref name=IPCC2014&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 2014. Climate change 2014, Mitigation of climate change. [[Fifth Assessment Report]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A PNAS model showed that even if animals were completely removed from US agriculture and diets, [[Greenhouse gas emissions by the United States|US GHG emissions]] would be decreased by 2.6%(or 28% of agricultural GHG emissions). This is because of the need to replace animal manures by fertilizers and to replace also other animal coproducts, and because livestock now use human-inedible food and fiber processing byproducts.&lt;ref name=pnas&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/114/48/E10301.full|title=Nutritional and greenhouse gas impacts of removing animals from US agriculture|date=Nov 13, 2017|volume=114|issue=48|doi=10.1073/pnas.1707322114|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, [[methane emissions]] associated with [[ruminant]] livestock (6.4 Mt in 2013)&lt;ref name=USEPA2015&gt;US Environmental Protection Agency. 2015. Inventory of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and sinks, 1990-2013.

Climate change 2013, The physical science basis. Fifth Assessment Report.&lt;/ref&gt; and methane accounts for about 32 to 40 percent of agriculture’s greenhouse gas emissions (estimated as 100-year carbon dioxide equivalents) as tabulated by the IPCC.&lt;ref name=IPCC2014/&gt; Methane has a global warming potential recently estimated as 35 times that of an equivalent mass of carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name=IPCC2013/&gt; However, despite the magnitude of methane emissions (recently about 330 to 350 Tg per year from all anthropogenic sources), methane’s current effect on global warming is quite small. This is because degradation of methane nearly keeps pace with emissions, resulting in a relatively little increase in atmospheric methane content (average of 6 Tg per year from 2000 through 2009), whereas [[atmospheric carbon dioxide]] content has been increasing greatly (average of nearly 15,000 Tg per year from 2000 through 2009).&lt;ref name=IPCC2013/&gt;

In [[New Zealand]], nearly half of [anthropogenic] greenhouse gas emission is associated with agriculture, which plays a major role in the nation’s economy, and a large fraction of this is assignable to the [[meat industry|livestock industry]].&lt;ref&gt;Voluntary Greenhouse Gas Reporting Feasibility Study. 2. Agricultural sector GHG emissions in NZ. http://maxa.maf.govt.nz/climatechange/slm/vggr/page-01.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Some fraction of this is assignable to meat production: FAO data indicate that meat accounted for about 7 percent of product tonnage from [[New Zealand's livestock]] (including poultry) in 2010.&lt;ref name=FAOSTAT/&gt; Livestock sources (including enteric fermentation and manure) account for about 3.1 percent of US anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents, according to [[US EPA]] figures compiled using [[UNFCCC]] methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;US EPA. 2009.

Cultural energy in sheep production. In: ''Handbook of Energy Utilization in Agriculture''. CRC Press, Boca Raton. pp. 425-430&lt;/ref&gt; and prolificacy;&lt;ref&gt;USDA. 2010. Agricultural Statistics 2010, Table 7-43.&lt;/ref&gt; both factors strongly influence emissions per kg of lamb production.

According to a 2018 study in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', a significant reduction in meat consumption will be "essential" to mitigate climate change, especially as the human population increases by a projected 2.3 billion by the middle of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Carrington |first=Damian|date=October 10, 2018 |title=Huge reduction in meat-eating ‘essential’ to avoid climate breakdown|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/10/huge-reduction-in-meat-eating-essential-to-avoid-climate-breakdown|work=[[The Guardian]] |location= |access-date=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of air pollution on human respiratory health ==
Meat production is one of the leading causes of greenhouse gas emissions and other particulate matter pollution in the atmosphere. This type of production chain produces copious byproducts; endotoxin, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, and particulate matter (PM), such as dust, are all released along with the aforementioned methane and CO2.&lt;ref&gt;Merchant, J. A., Naleway, A. L., Svendsen, E. R., Kelly, K. M., Burmeister, L. F., Stromquist, A. M., . . . Chrischilles, E. A. (2004). Asthma and Farm Exposures in a Cohort of Rural Iowa Children. Environmental Health Perspectives, 113(3), 350-356. doi:10.1289/ehp.7240&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, elevated greenhouse gas emissions have been associated with respiratory diseases like asthma, bronchitis, and COPD, as well as increased chances of acquiring pneumonia from bacterial infections.&lt;ref&gt;George, M., Bruzzese, J., &amp; Matura, L. A. (2017). Climate Change Effects on Respiratory Health: Implications for Nursing. Journal of Nursing Scholarship, 49(6), 644-652. doi:10.1111/jnu.12330&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, exposure to PM10 (particulate matter 10 micrometers in diameter) may produce diseases that impact the upper and proximal airways.&lt;ref&gt;Viegas, S., Faísca, V. M., Dias, H., Clérigo, A., Carolino, E., &amp; Viegas, C. (2013). Occupational Exposure to Poultry Dust and Effects on the Respiratory System in Workers. Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part A, 76(4-5), 230-239. doi:10.1080/15287394.2013.757199&lt;/ref&gt; However, farmers aren’t the only ones at risk for exposure to these harmful byproducts. In fact, concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) in proximity to residential areas adversely affect these individuals' respiratory health similarly seen in the farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Radon, K., Schulze, A., Ehrenstein, V., Strien, R. T., Praml, G., &amp; Nowak, D. (2007). Environmental Exposure to Confined Animal Feeding Operations and Respiratory Health of Neighboring Residents. Epidemiology, 18(3), 300-308. doi:10.1097/01.ede.0000259966.62137.84&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrated hog feeding operations release air pollutants from confinement buildings, manure holding pits, and land application of waste. Air pollutants from these operations have caused acute physical symptoms, such as respiratory illnesses, wheezing, increased breath rate, and irritation of the eyes and nose.&lt;ref&gt;Schinasi, L., Horton, R. A., Guidry, V. T., Wing, S., Marshall, S. W., &amp; Morland, K. B. (2011). Air Pollution, Lung Function, and Physical Symptoms in Communities Near Concentrated Swine Feeding Operations. Epidemiology, 22(2), 208-215. doi:10.1097/ede.0b013e3182093c8b&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mirabelli, M. C., Wing, S., Marshall, S. W., &amp; Wilcosky, T. C. (2006). Asthma Symptoms Among Adolescents Who Attend Public Schools That Are Located Near Confined Swine Feeding Operations. Pediatrics, 118(1). doi:10.1542/peds.2005-2812&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pavilonis, B. T., Sanderson, W. T., &amp; Merchant, J. A. (2013). Relative exposure to swine animal feeding operations and childhood asthma prevalence in an agricultural cohort. Environmental Research, 122, 74-80. doi:10.1016/j.envres.2012.12.008&lt;/ref&gt; That prolonged exposure to airborne animal particulate, such as swine dust, induces a large influx of inflammatory cells into the airways.&lt;ref&gt;Müller-Suur, C., Larsson, K., Malmberg, P., &amp; Larsson, P. (1997). Increased number of activated lymphocytes in human lung following swine dust inhalation. European Respiratory Journal, 10(2), 376-380. doi:10.1183/09031936.97.10020376&lt;/ref&gt; Those in close proximity to CAFOs could be exposed to elevated levels of these byproducts, which may lead to poor health and respiratory outcomes.

==Energy consumption==
Data of a USDA study indicate that about 0.9 percent of energy use in the United States is accounted for by raising food-producing livestock and poultry. In this context, energy use includes energy from fossil, nuclear, hydroelectric, biomass, geothermal, technological solar, and wind sources. (It excludes solar energy captured by photosynthesis, used in hay drying, etc.) The estimated energy use in agricultural production includes embodied energy in purchased inputs.&lt;ref&gt;Canning, P., A. Charles, S. Huang, K. R. Polenske, and A Waters. 2010. Energy use in the U.S. food system. USDA Economic Research Service, ERR-94. 33 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important aspect of energy use of livestock production is the energy consumption that the animals contribute. Feed Conversion Ratio is an animal’s ability to covert feed into meat. The Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) is calculated by the taking the energy, protein or mass input of the feed divided by the output of meat provided by the animal. A lower FCR corresponds with a smaller requirement of feed per meat out-put, therefore the animal contributes less GHG emissions. Chickens and pigs usually have a lower FCR compared to ruminants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Röös|first=Elin|last2=Sundberg|first2=Cecilia|last3=Tidåker|first3=Pernilla|last4=Strid|first4=Ingrid|last5=Hansson|first5=Per-Anders|date=2013-01-01|title=Can carbon footprint serve as an indicator of the environmental impact of meat production?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X12002956|journal=Ecological Indicators|volume=24|pages=573–581|doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intensification and other changes in the livestock industries influence energy use, emissions and other environmental effects of meat production. For example, in the US beef production system, practices prevailing in 2007 are estimated to have involved 8.6 percent less fossil fuel use, 16 percent less greenhouse gas emissions, 12 percent less water use and 33 percent less land use, per unit mass of beef produced, than in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Capper | first1 = J. L. | year = 2011 | title = The environmental impact of beef production in the United States: 1977 compared with 2007. | url = | journal = J. Animal Sci. | volume = 89 | issue = | pages = 4249–4261 | doi=10.2527/jas.2010-3784}}&lt;/ref&gt; These figures are based on analysis taking into account feed production, feedlot practices, forage-based cow-calf operations, backgrounding before cattle enter a feedlot, and production of culled dairy cows.

==Animal waste==
Water pollution due to animal waste is a common problem in both developed and developing nations.&lt;ref name=Steinfeld2006&gt;{{Citation |last= Steinfeld|first= Henning|last2= Gerber|first2= Pierre|last3= Wassenaar|first3= Tom|last4= Castel|first4= Vincent|last5= Rosales|first5= Mauricio|last6= de Haan|first6= Cees|year= 2006|title= Livestock's Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options|publisher= FAO|publication-place= Rome|page= |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/climatechange/doc/FAO%20report%20executive%20summary.pdf |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The USA, Canada, India, Greece, Switzerland and several other countries are experiencing major environmental degradation due to water pollution via animal waste.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/wairdocs/lead/x6130e/x6130e02.htm&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Table I-1}} Concerns about such problems are particularly acute in the case of CAFOs ([[concentrated animal feeding operation]]s). In the US, a permit for a CAFO requires implementation of a plan for management of manure nutrients, contaminants, wastewater, etc., as applicable, to meet requirements under the Clean Water Act.&lt;ref&gt;US Code of Federal Regulations 40 CFR 122.42(e)&lt;/ref&gt; There were about 19,000 CAFOs in the US as of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency. Appendix to EPA ICR 1989.06: Supporting Statement for the Information Collection Request for NPDES and ELG Regulatory Revisions for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (Final Rule)&lt;/ref&gt; In fiscal 2014, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) concluded 26 enforcement actions for various violations by CAFOs.&lt;ref&gt;US EPA. National Enforcement Initiative: Preventing animal waste from contaminating surface and ground water. http://www2.epa.gov/enforcement/national-enforcement-initiative-preventing-animal-waste-contaminating-surface-and-ground#progress&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental performance of the US livestock industry can be compared with several other industries. The EPA has published 5-year and 1-year data for 32 industries on their ratios of enforcement orders to inspections, a measure of non-compliance with environmental regulations: principally, those under Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act. For the livestock industry, inspections focused primarily on CAFOs. Of the 31 other industries, 4 (including crop production) had a better 5-year environmental record than the livestock industry, 2 had a similar record, and 25 had a worse record in this respect. For the most recent year of the five-year compilation, livestock production and dry cleaning had the best environmental records of the 32 industries, each with an enforcement order/inspection ratio of 0.01. For crop production, the ratio was 0.02. Of the 32 industries, oil and gas extraction and the livestock industry had the lowest percentages of facilities with violations.&lt;ref&gt;US EPA. 2000. Profile of the agricultural livestock production industry. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Office of Compliance. EPA/310-R-00-002. 156 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

With good management, manure has environmental benefits. Manure deposited on pastures by grazing animals themselves is applied efficiently for maintaining soil fertility. Animal manures are also commonly collected from barns and concentrated feeding areas for efficient re-use of many nutrients in crop production, sometimes after composting. For many areas with high livestock density, manure application substantially replaces application of synthetic fertilizers on surrounding cropland. Manure was spread as a fertilizer on about 15.8 million acres of US cropland in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, J. M. et al. 2009. Manure use for fertilizer and for energy. Report to Congress. USDA, AP-037. 53pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Manure is also spread on forage-producing land that is grazed, rather than cropped. Altogether, in 2007, manure was applied on about 22.1 million acres in the United States.&lt;ref name=USDA2009/&gt; Substitution of animal manure for synthetic fertilizer has important implications for energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, considering that between about 43 and 88 MJ (i.e. between about 10 and 21 Mcal) of fossil fuel energy are used per kg of N in the production of synthetic nitrogenous fertilizers.&lt;ref&gt;Shapouri, H. et al. 2002. The energy balance of corn ethanol: an update. USDA Agricultural Economic Report 814&lt;/ref&gt;

Manure can also have environmental benefit as a renewable energy source, in digester systems yielding biogas for heating and/or electricity generation.

Grazing (especially [[overgrazing]]) may detrimentally affect certain wildlife species, e.g. by altering cover and food supplies. However, habitat modification by livestock grazing can also benefit some wildlife species. For example, in North America, various studies have found that grazing sometimes improves habitat for

Some scientists claim that the growing demand for meat is contributing to [[Holocene extinction|significant biodiversity loss]] as it is a significant driver of [[deforestation]] and habitat destruction; species-rich habitats, such as significant portions of the Amazon region, are being converted to agriculture for meat production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/radical-conservation/2015/oct/20/the-four-horsemen-of-the-sixth-mass-extinction|title=How humans are driving the sixth mass extinction|first=Jeremy |last=Hance|date=October 20, 2015|work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/08/meat-eaters-may-speed-worldwide-species-extinction-study-warns|title=Meat-eaters may speed worldwide species extinction, study warns|first= Virginia |last=Morell |date=August 11, 2015|work=[[Science (magazine)|Science]]|accessdate=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Machovina 2015 419–431"&gt;{{cite journal|first=B.|last=Machovina|first2=K.

Among other environmental benefits of meat production, is the conversion of materials that might otherwise be wasted, to produce high-protein food.

There are environmental benefits of meat-producing small ruminants for control of specific invasive or [[noxious weed]]s (such as [[spotted knapweed]], [[tansy ragwort]], [[Euphorbia virgata|leafy spurge]], [[yellow starthistle]], [[tall larkspur]], etc.) on rangeland {{citation needed | date=May 2017}}. Small ruminants are also useful for vegetation management in forest plantations, and for clearing brush on rights-of-way. These represent food-producing alternatives to herbicide use.&lt;ref&gt;Launchbaugh, K. (ed.) 2006. Targeted Grazing: a natural approach to vegetation management and landscape enhancement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7066">'''EuResist''' is an international project designed to improve the treatment of [[HIV]] patients by developing a computerized system that can recommend optimal treatment based on the patient’s clinical and genomic data.

The project is part of the [[Virtual Physiological Human]] framework, funded by the [[European Commission]]. It started in 2006 with the formation of a consortium of several research institutes and hospitals in [[Europe]] and [[Israel]]. The consortium completed its commitment to the [[European Commission]] near the end of 2008, at which time the system became available online. A non-profit organization was consequently established by the main partners to maintain and improve the system.

In 2009, the EuResist project was named as a Computerworld honors program laureate.&lt;ref name="site1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwhonors.org/laureates/finalists2009.htm|title=Computerworld Honors Program - 2009 Finalists|website=www.cwhonors.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background  ==
[[AIDS]] is a disease caused by the [[HIV]] [[retrovirus]], which progressively reduces the effectiveness of the [[immune system]], leading to [[infections]] and ultimately [[death]].

More than 30 different drugs exist for treating HIV patients. [[Antiretroviral drugs]] can disrupt the virus’s replication process causing its numbers to decrease dramatically. While the virus cannot be eradicated completely, in small numbers it is harmless. Usually a patient is given a combination of three or four drugs, a treatment known as highly active antiretroviral therapy, or [[HAART]]. The main reason such a treatment might fail is the development of mutated strands of the virus, resistant to one or more of the prescribed drugs.

Thus an important consideration when choosing treatment for a patient is to prescribe those drugs to which the particular patient’s virus strands are most susceptible. One way to achieve that is to extract virus samples from the patient’s blood and test them against all possible drugs. Since this process is lengthy and costly, computerized systems have been developed to predict virus resistance based on its genotype. The treating physician samples virus genotype sequences from the patient’s blood and provides this data to a computerized system. The system then responds with drug recommendations.

Such systems are limited in accuracy, depending on the amount of data used for their creation, its quality and the richness of mathematical models used for the actual prediction. Prior to EuResist, such systems had several common characteristics that negatively impacted their accuracy:&lt;ref name="paper1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/24/13/i399/226470|title=Selecting anti-HIV therapies based on a variety of genomic and clinical factors|first1=Michal|last1=Rosen-Zvi|first2=Andre|last2=Altmann|first3=Mattia|last3=Prosperi|first4=Ehud|last4=Aharoni|first5=Hani|last5=Neuvirth|first6=Anders|last6=Sönnerborg|first7=Eugen|last7=Schülter|first8=Daniel|last8=Struck|first9=Yardena|last9=Peres|first10=Francesca|last10=Incardona|first11=Rolf|last11=Kaiser|first12=Maurizio|last12=Zazzi|first13=Thomas|last13=Lengauer|date=1 July 2008|publisher=|journal=Bioinformatics|volume=24|issue=13|pages=i399–i406|via=bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btn141|pmc=2718619}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The amount of data used for creating the system was relatively small
* This data was [[in vitro]] data: laboratory measures of the resistance of various strands of HIV to individual drugs. Such data is known to be inaccurate because laboratory tests do not simulate exactly the processes of a living organism, and since resistance to individual drugs does not accurately predict the resistance to a combination of drugs.
* They used a relatively simple mathematical prediction model

== EuResist  overview ==
EuResist sought to create a more accurate HIV treatment prediction system by collecting a large database of [[in vivo]] data (clinical and genomic records of real treatments of HIV patients and their consequences), and by using an array of prediction models instead of just one.
 
The database was created by merging local databases of various clinics across Europe. This database is thought to be the largest of its kind in the world.
For each patient, it includes various personal and demographic details such as gender, age, country of origin, genomic sequencing of HIV found in the patient’s blood, records of the drugs prescribed, and the changes in the amount of virus in the blood following these treatments.

This data was used to train an array of prediction models, created by using various contemporary [[machine learning]] techniques, among them [[Bayesian networks]], [[logistic regression]], and others.

A web interface allows physicians to specify patients' clinical and genomic data. This data is sent to the prediction engines, and the combined response, which is displayed to the physician, includes various suggested treatments and a prediction of their effect on the amount of HIV in the blood.

The EuResist system was tested and compared with its predecessors by feeding it with historical data on patients for which treatment results are known. The developers of EuResist, who conducted this test, reported an improved performance over the previous state-of-the-art system.

== History ==

EuResist started in 2006 as a consortium funded by the [[European Union]] as part of the [[Virtual Physiological Human]] FP-6 framework. The partners of this consortium were:
* [[IBM Haifa Research Laboratory]] ([[Israel]])
* Informa S.r.l. ([[Italy]])
* [[Karolinska Institutet]] ([[Sweden]])
* [[Kingston University]] ([[United Kingdom]])
* [[Max Planck Institute for Informatics]] ([[Germany]])
* {{ill|MTA Wigner Fizikai Kutatóközpont Részecske- és Magfizikai Intézet|hu}} ([[Hungary]])
* [[University of Siena]] ([[Italy]])
* {{ill|Universitätsklinikum Köln|de}} ([[Germany]])
 
The consortium completed its commitment to the [[European Union]] in late 2008, at which time the EuResist system became available on line.
The first five partners mentioned above continued to form a non-profit organization that maintains the system, expands the database with new clinical and genomical records and updates the prediction engines accordingly. As of mid-2010, an average of 600 queries are submitted to the EuResist system every quarter.

== Recognition ==
On June 1, 2009, EuResist received a Computerworld honors program laureate award, a global program honoring individuals and organizations that use information technology to benefit society.&lt;ref name="site1"/&gt;

The '''European Federation of Biotechnology''' (EFB) was established by European scientists in 1978. It is a non-profit federation of national biotechnology associations, learned societies, universities, scientific institutes, biotechnology companies and individual biotechnologists working to promote biotechnology throughout Europe and beyond.

The mission of the EFB is to promote the safe, sustainable and beneficial use of the life sciences, to promote research and innovation at the cutting edge of biotechnology, to provide a forum for interdisciplinary and international cooperation, to improve scientific education and to facilitate an informed dialogue between scientists, the biotechnology industries and the public.

The EFB Central Office (ECO) is located in Barcelona, Spain. Membership administration, organization of Executive Board meetings and General Assemblies, website management and organization of scientific meetings for EFB Sections and promotion of the European Congresses on Biotechnology are some of the main responsibilities of ECO.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efbiotechnology.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Congress on Biotechnology==
[[File:ECB2018 Logo.png|alt=ECB2018 Logo|thumb|Logo of the European Congress on Biotechnology 2018]]
The European Congress on Biotechnology (ECB) is a conference for academic and industrial biotechnologists in Europe, organised by the European Federation of Biotechnology.

The first Congress in the series was held in 1978 (Interlaken, Switzerland).  As in all of the earlier congresses, the principal aim of the current ECB2018 is bring together the international scientific community and many segments of the biotech industry.  The Congress will present the latest developments in front-line research and provide a platform for exchanging ideas in biotechnology and its applications. Participants will be able to interact with business leaders, investors, trade exhibitors and policy makers to discuss regulatory issues and the bioeconomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecb2018.com/|title=ECB 2018 {{!}} 1st - 4th July 2018|website=www.ecb2018.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journal==
''[https://www.journals.elsevier.com/new-biotechnology/ New Biotechnology]'' is the official journal of the European Federation of Biotechnology (EFB) and is published bimonthly. It covers both the science of biotechnology and its surrounding political, business and financial milieu. The journal publishes peer-reviewed basic research papers, authoritative reviews, feature articles and opinions in all areas of biotechnology.

[[File:Ecard-rückseite-österreich.png|thumb|Sample European Health Insurance Card from Austria (reverse).]]
[[File:Elektronische Gesundheitskarte Mustermann RS.svg|thumb|German card]]
[[File:Carte Européenne d'Assurance Maladie France.jpg|thumb|Sample French EHIC]]
[[File:EHIC Slovenia.jpg|thumb|Slovenian card]]

The '''European Health Insurance Card''' (or '''EHIC''') is issued free of charge and allows anyone who is insured by or covered by a statutory social security scheme of the [[European Economic Area|EEA]] countries and [[Switzerland]] to receive medical treatment in another member state free or at a reduced cost, if that treatment becomes necessary during their visit (for example, due to illness or an accident), or if they have a chronic [[pre-existing condition]] which requires care such as [[kidney dialysis]].  The term of validity of the card varies according to the issuing country.

The intention of the scheme is to allow people to continue their stay in a country without having to return home for medical care; as such, it does not cover people who have visited a country for the purpose of obtaining medical care, nor does it cover care, such as many types of dental treatment, which can be delayed until the individual returns to his or her home country. The costs not covered by self-liability fees are paid by the issuing country, which is usually the country of residence but may also be the country where one receives the most pension from.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/society/reality-check/2015/aug/11/are-foreigners-gaming-nhs-pay-medical-treatment-abroad-ehic&lt;/ref&gt;

It only covers healthcare which is normally covered by a statutory health care system in the visited country, so it does not render [[travel insurance]] obsolete.

The card was phased in from 1 June 2004 and throughout 2005, becoming the sole healthcare entitlement document on 1 January 2006. The card is applicable in all [[France|French]] [[overseas department]]s ([[Martinique]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Réunion]], and [[French Guiana]]) as they are part of the EEA, but not [[Special Member State territories and the European Union|non-EEA dependent territories]] such as [[Jersey]], the [[Isle of Man]], [[Aruba]], or [[French Polynesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/asia-oceania/french-polynesia |title=UK FCO Travel Advice: French Polynesia |publisher=Fco.gov.uk |date=2012-09-12 |accessdate=2012-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are agreements for the use of the EHIC in the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Greenland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/europe/denmark |title=UK FCO Travel Advice: Denmark |publisher=Fco.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though they are not in the EEA.

The reason for the existence of this card, is that the right to health care in Europe is based on the country of legal residence, not the country of citizenship. Therefore, a passport is not enough to receive health care. It is however possible that a photo ID document is asked for, since the European Health Insurance Card does not contain a photo.

In some cases, even if a person is covered by the health insurance of an [[European Union member state|EU country]], one is not eligible for a European Health Insurance Card. For instance, in Romania, a person who is currently insured has to have been insured for the previous five years to be eligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libertatea.ro/stire/cardul-european-de-asigurari-de-sanatate-eliberat-gratuit-250099.html |title=Cardul european de asigurări de sănătate, eliberat gratuit |publisher=Libertatea.ro |date=2009-08-01 |accessdate=2012-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romania is also the only participating country where not all permanent residents are covered by a health insurance. Due to these reasons the Romanian [[Romani people in Romania|Roma people]] typically neither have European insurance cards nor is their costs paid by the country of residence.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

It replaced the following medical forms:
* E110 - For international road [[haulier]]s
* E111 - For tourists
* E119 - For [[unemployment|unemployed people]]/[[job hunting|job seekers]]
* E128 - For students and workers in another member state

==Third party application processors==
European Health Insurance cards are provided free to all legal residents of participating countries. There are however various businesses who act as non-official agents on behalf of individuals, arranging supply of the cards in return for payment, often offering additional services such as the checking of applications for errors and general advice or assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://redbpo.com/third-party-application-processors/ |title=Third Party Application Processors |publisher= |date=2016-09-02 |accessdate=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has proved extremely controversial. In 2010 the British government moved against companies that invited people to pay for the free EHIC, falsely implying that through payment the applicant could speed up the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-10925685 |title=BBC News - European health card scam stopped by OFT |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2010-08-10 |accessdate=2012-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerfocus.org.uk/wales/news/consumers-warned-to-be-search-engine-savvy |title=Consumers warned to be search engine savvy – Consumer Focus Wales |publisher=Consumerfocus.org.uk |date=2011-06-22 |accessdate=2012-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the practice continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ray Massey |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2010441/Millions-duped-paying-free-EU-health-cards.html |title=Millions duped into paying for free EU health cards &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2011-07-01 |accessdate=2012-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=James Coney |url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/holidays/article-2162077/EHIC-scam-warning--dont-pay-card.html |title=EHIC scam warning - don't pay for a card |publisher=This is Money |date=2012-06-20 |accessdate=2012-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Channel Islands]] and [[Isle of Man]] do not supply coverage under the EHIC, and their residents are not eligible for EHICs.

==Controversy==
In August 2015 the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' ran a story about abuse of the EHIC system in which a card was issued to its undercover Hungarian reporter who “obtained the card after visiting the UK for less than one day” after another journalist posed as her landlord and presented a GP with the tenancy agreement of a property that neither occupied in order to get an NHS number.  It claimed that "foreigners were charging the NHS for care in their own country." As ''[[The Guardian]]'' pointed out, the NHS issued a card to an individual that wasn’t eligible to receive the card because a GP was duped into issuing an NHS number, and it was unclear what benefit would accrue as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Are foreigners really gaming the NHS to pay for their medical treatment abroad?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/reality-check/2015/aug/11/are-foreigners-gaming-nhs-pay-medical-treatment-abroad-ehic|accessdate=22 August 2015|publisher=Guardian|date=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With no active investigation branch, the likelihood of NHS authorities discovering fraud is extremely low. The ''[[Huffington Post]]'' reported that only nine instances of low-level fraud involving the EHIC in the UK had been discovered in five years with a combined cost of £712.56.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Exclusive: Migrant NHS Fraud Costs Only £700 Despite Fury Over Health Card Abuse.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1574">The '''Halachic Organ Donor Society''', also known as the HOD Society, was started in December 2001 by Robert Berman.&lt;ref name=directors&gt;{{cite web|title=Directors|url=http://www.hods.org/English/directorsE.shtml|website=HODS|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission is to save lives by increasing [[organ donation]] from Jews to the general public (including [[gentiles]]).&lt;ref name="taboo article"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berg|first1=Elaine|title=Beating the Organ Donor Taboo|url=http://forward.com/articles/743/beating-the-organ-donor-taboo/?|website=Jewish Daily Forward|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization recognizes the legitimate debate in Orthodox [[Halacha|Jewish law]] surrounding [[brain stem death]] and offers a unique organ donor card that allows people to choose between donating organs at [[brain stem death]] or alternatively at cessation of heart beat ([[asystole]]). It currently has thousands of members, including more than 200 Orthodox Rabbis and several [[Chief Rabbi]]s.&lt;ref name=rabbis&gt;{{cite web|title=Rabbis|url=http://www.hods.org/English/rabbisE.shtml|website=HODS|accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has delivered educational lectures that have encouraged more than 34,000 Jews to donate organs.

The '''history of Indian cuisine''' consists of [[cuisine from the Indian subcontinent]], which is rich and diverse. As a land that has experienced extensive immigration and intermingling through many millennia, the Indian subcontinent has benefited from numerous food influences. The diverse climate in the region, ranging from deep tropical to alpine, has also helped considerably broaden the set of ingredients readily available to the many schools of cookery in India. In many cases, food has become a marker of religious and social identity, with varying taboos and preferences (for instance, a segment of the [[Jainism|Jain]] population consume no roots or subterranean vegetable; see [[Jain vegetarianism]]) which has also driven these groups to innovate extensively with the food sources that are deemed acceptable.

One strong influence over Indian foods is the longstanding [[vegetarianism]] within sections of [[India]]'s [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and Jain communities. At 31%, slightly less than a third of Indians are vegetarians.&lt;ref name="JT_Thakrar_2007-04-22"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20070422x4.html |title=Japanese warm to real curries and more |work=[[Japan Times]] |last=Thakrar |first=Raju |date=22 April 2007 |accessdate=2007-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==
Around 7000 BCE, agriculture spread from the Fertile Crescent to the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]], and wheat and barley began to be grown. [[Sesame]], and [[zebu|humped cattle]] were domesticated in the local farming communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Diamond |first=Jared |title=Guns, Germs And Steel |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_BrB7kg19RgC |year=2013 |publisher=Random House |isbn=978-1-4481-8020-2 |p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 3000 BCE, [[turmeric]], [[cardamom]], [[black pepper]] and [[Mustard plant|mustard]] were harvested in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.menumagazine.co.uk/book/dawnofhistory.html Curry, Spice &amp; All Things Nice: Dawn of History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2013/01/indus_civilization_food_how_scientists_are_figuring_out_what_curry_was_like.html The Mystery of Curry]&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient [[Hindu]] text ''[[Mahabharata]]'' mentions rice and meat cooked together, and the word "pulao" or "pallao" is used to refer to the dish in ancient [[Sanskrit]]  works, such as [[Yājñavalkya Smṛti]].&lt;ref name="KTAchaya1994"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[K. T. Achaya]] |title=Indian food: a historical companion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-cFcH2ZHWLcC |year=1994 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vegetarianism was facilitated by the advent of [[Buddhism]] and a cooperative climate where a variety of fruits, vegetables, and grains could easily be grown throughout the year. A food classification system that categorized any item as [[satvic|saatvic]], [[rajasic|raajsic]] or [[tamasic|taamsic]] developed in [[Ayurveda]]. 

Later, arrivals from [[Arabia]], [[Central Asia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://indianfood.about.com/od/thebasics/p/northindia.htm ''The Cuisine of North India''], about.com&lt;/ref&gt; and others had a deep and fundamental effect on Indian cooking. [[Islam in India|Islamic rule]] introduced rich gravies, [[biryani]] and non-vegetarian fare such as [[kebab]]s, resulting in [[Mughlai cuisine]] ([[Mughal era|Mughal]] in origin), as well as such fruits as apricots, melons, peaches, and plums. The Mughals were great patrons of cooking. Lavish dishes were prepared during the reigns of [[Jahangir]] and [[Shah Jahan]]. The [[Muslim]] meat dishes includes [[bovine]], [[ovine]], [[poultry]] and [[seafood]] dishes. The [[Nizam]]s of [[Hyderabad state]] (1700s-1947) perfected their own style of cooking with the most notable dish being the [[Hyderabad biryani]], often considered by many connoisseurs to be the finest of the main dishes in India.

The [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]] and [[British India|British]] during their rule introduced cooking techniques such as baking, and foods from the [[New World]]. The [[New World crops|new-world vegetables]] popular in cuisine from the Indian subcontinent include [[tomato]], [[potato]], [[sweet potatoes]], [[peanut]]s, [[Squash (plant)|squash]], and [[Capsicum|chilli]]. Most New world vegetables such as sweet potatoes, potatoes, [[Amaranth]], peanuts and [[cassava]] based [[Sago]] are allowed on Hindu fasting days.

[[Image:Isinnhou.jpg|thumb|250px|The 22nd volume of the ''Ishinpō''.

{{nihongo|'''''Ishinpō'''''|醫心方|ishinpō or ishinhō}} is the oldest surviving [[Japan]]ese medical text. It was completed in 984 by Tamba Yasuyori (also referred in some sources as Tanba no Yasuyori&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Culture in Traditional Japan|last=Sugimoto|first=Masayoshi|last2=Swain|first2=David|publisher=Charles E. Tuttle company|year=1989|isbn=9781462918133|location=Rutland, VT|pages=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and is 30 volumes in length. The work is partly based on a [[traditional Chinese medicine|Chinese medical work]] called ''[[Zhubing Yuanhou Lun]]'' 諸病源候論 (''Treatise on the Many Illnesses''), compiled by [[Sui Dynasty]] writer [[Chao Yuanfang]]. Many of the texts cited in ''Ishinpō'' have been lost in China, and have only survived to the present through their inclusion in the work. It is a [[National Treasures of Japan|national treasure of Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;Yoshida (2001: 192)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Ishinpō'' preserved more than 200 important medical documents that were all Chinese in origin and no Japanese sources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The medical knowledge in the tome  covered clinical treatments that drew from the ancient Chinese traditional medicine and influenced by Indian medical theories found in [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist]] scriptures as well as [[Taoism|Taoist]] references (e.g. Taoist drugs).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For instance, there was the so-called ''Scripture on Pregnancy'', which outlined the physical developments and fetal movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gendering Chinese Religion: Subject, Identity, and Body|last=Jia|first=Jinhua|last2=Kang|first2=Xiaofei|last3=Yao|first3=Ping|publisher=SUNY Press|year=2014|isbn=9781438453071|location=New York|pages=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars cite its similarity with a prescription from the old Chinese medical text called ''Taichan shu,'' which contained doctrines about the development of embryo and fetus as well as proper hygiene for pregnant women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suzuki|first=Chiharu|date=December 2004|title=[Transition of the doctrine from ancient to medieval China for embryo and fetus on each month during pregnancy period]|journal=Nihon Ishigaku Zasshi. [Journal of Japanese History of Medicine]|volume=50|issue=4|pages=569–589|issn=0549-3323|pmid=15818873}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Ishinpō'' is also notable for preserving some of the [[Taoist sexual practices|Taoist sexual manuals]] from the Han to the Tang dynasty. The twenty-eighth section of the ''Ishinpō'' contains a complete transcription of a Daoist text known as ''The Classic of Sunu'' which is a dialogue between the Dark Maiden and the [[Yellow Emperor]], with the former providing advice on sexual practices to the latter.

While the text is written in [[kanbun]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] terms are written to the side in [[Man'yōgana]] for plants, animals, and minerals.

== Snake species ==
The United States has about 20 species of venomous snakes, which include 16 species of [[rattlesnakes]], two species of [[coral snakes]], one species of [[cottonmouth]] (or water moccasin), and one species of [[Agkistrodon contortrix|copperhead]]. At least one species of venomous snake is found in every state except Alaska and Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venombyte.com/venom/snakes/venomous_snakes_by_state.asp|title=Venomous Snakes of the United States by State|first=David W.|last=George|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been estimated that 7,000–8,000 people per year receive venomous snake bites in the United States, and about five of those people die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Venomous Snakes |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/snakes/|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most fatal bites are attributed to the [[eastern diamondback rattlesnake]] and the [[western diamondback rattlesnake]]. The copperhead accounts for more cases of venomous snake bite than any other North American species; however, its venom is the least toxic, so its bite is seldom fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Copperhead snake page |publisher=Snakesandfrogs.com |url=http://www.snakesandfrogs.com/scra/snakes/copperh.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000916094157/http://www.snakesandfrogs.com/scra/snakes/copperh.htm |archivedate=2000-09-16 |accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Venomous snakes are distributed unevenly throughout the United States &amp;mdash; the vast majority of snake bites occur in warm weather states. States like [[Florida]] and [[Texas]] have a wide variety and large population of venomous snakes. Bites from venomous snakes are extremely rare in the states near the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–US border]]. [[Maine]], for example, has only one species ([[timber rattlesnake]]); it is rarely seen, and then only in the southern part of the state, but the species is likely extirpated in Maine, with the last sighting in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newenglandreptile.com/timber.html|title=Timber Rattlesnakes|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7987">'''Medical slang''' is the use of [[acronym]]s and informal terminology to describe patients, other healthcare personnel and medical concepts. Some terms are pejorative. In [[English language|English]], medical slang has entered [[popular culture]] via television hospital and forensic science dramas such as ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', ''[[House (TV series)|House M.D.]]'', ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'', ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', and ''[[Grey's Anatomy (TV series)|Grey's Anatomy]]''.

Examples of pejorative language include ''bagged and tagged'' for a corpse, a reference to the intake process at a [[mortuary]], ''donorcycle'' for ''[[motorcycle]] or PFO'' for ''pissed [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]]] and fell over''. Less offensive are the terms ''blue pipes'' for [[vein]]s; ''cabbage'' for a heart bypass (''coronary artery bypass graft'' or CABG), and ''champagne tap'' for a flawless [[lumbar puncture]], that is, one where [[erythrocyte]] count is zero.

==Limitations on use==
In many countries, facetious or insulting acronyms are now considered unethical and unacceptable, and patients can access their medical records. Medical facilities risk being sued by patients offended by the descriptions.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}  Another reason for the decline is that facetious acronyms could be confused with genuine medical terms and the wrong treatment administered.

In one of his annual reports (related by the BBC), medical slang collector Dr. Adam Fox cited an example where a practitioner had entered “TTFO”, meaning “told to [[wikt:fuck off|fuck off]]”, on a patient’s chart. When questioned about the chart entry, the practitioner said that the initials stood for “to take fluids orally.”&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, medical slang tends to be restricted to oral use and to informal notes or [[Electronic mail|E-mails]] which do not form part of a patient’s formal records. It may also be used among medical staff outside of the hospital. It is not found on patients’ charts and, due to growing awareness of medical slang, often not used in front of patients themselves.{{original research inline|date=April 2017}}

==Non-English==
Although online medical slang dictionaries are primarily from English-speaking countries, non-English medical slang has been collected by Fox from elsewhere. Brazilian medical slang includes ''PIMBA'' ("Pé Inchado Mulambo Bêbado Atropelado" meaning "swollen-footed, drunk, run-over beggar"), ''Poliesculhambado'' (multi-messed-up patient) and ''Trambiclínica'' (a "fraudulent clinic" staffed cheaply by medical students).&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peterson C |title=Medical slang in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil |journal=Cadernos de Saúde Pública |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=671–82 |year=1998 |pmid=9878893 |doi=10.1590/S0102-311X1998000400002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annual round-up==
There is an annual round-up of the usage of medical slang by British physician Dr. Adam Fox of [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St Mary's Hospital]], [[London]]. Fox has spent five years charting more than 200 examples, regional and national terms and the general decline of medical slang.&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=Adam|last2=Fertleman|first2=Michael|last3=Cahill|first3=Pauline|last4=Palmer|first4=Roger|journal=Ethics and Behavior|title=Medical Slang in British Hospitals|volume=13|issue=2|pages=173–189|url=http://interesting-articles.wikispaces.com/file/view/Medical+Slang+in+British+Hospitals.pdf|accessdate=2015-04-21|doi=10.1207/s15327019eb1302_04|pmid=15124632|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that doctors have become more respectful of patients, which has contributed to the decline. While its use may be declining in the medical profession, several dictionaries of the slang have been compiled on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Doctors issue warning over misuse of slang| pmc=1142506 | page=360 | volume=327| issue=7411| journal=BMJ: British Medical Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Membrane bioreactor''' ('''MBR''') is the combination of a [[Membrane technology|membrane process]] like [[microfiltration]] or [[ultrafiltration]] with a biological [[wastewater treatment]] process, the [[Activated sludge|activated sludge process]]. It is now widely used for [[Sewage treatment|municipal]] and [[industrial wastewater treatment]].&lt;ref name=judd&gt;S. Judd, The MBR book (2006) Principles and applications of membrane bioreactors in water and wastewater treatment, Elsevier, Oxford {{ISBN|1856174816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[Image:MBR Schematic.jpg|thumb|400 px|Simple schematic describing the MBR process]]
When used with [[sewage|domestic wastewater]], MBR processes can produce effluent of high quality enough to be discharged to coastal, surface or brackish waterways or to be reclaimed for urban irrigation. Other advantages of MBRs over conventional processes include small footprint, easy retrofit and upgrade of old wastewater treatment plants.

It is possible to operate MBR processes at higher [[mixed liquor suspended solids]] (MLSS) concentrations compared to conventional settlement separation systems, thus reducing the reactor volume to achieve the same loading rate.

Two MBR configurations exist: internal/submerged, where the membranes are immersed in and integral to the biological reactor; and external/sidestream, where membranes are a separate unit process requiring an intermediate pumping step.

[[Image:MBRvsASP Schematic.jpg|thumb|550 px|Schematic of conventional [[activated sludge]] process (top) and external (sidestream) membrane bioreactor (bottom)]]

Recent technical innovation and significant membrane cost reduction have enabled MBRs to become an established process option to treat wastewaters.&lt;ref name=judd/&gt; As a result, the MBR process has now become an attractive option for the treatment and reuse of industrial and municipal wastewaters, as evidenced by their constantly rising numbers and capacity. The current MBR market has been estimated to value around US$216 million in 2006 and to rise to US$363 million by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=S. Atkinson|doi=10.1016/S0958-2118(06)70635-8|title=Research studies predict strong growth for MBR markets|year=2006|journal=Membrane Technology|volume=2006|issue=2|pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:SubmergedMBR Schematic.jpg|thumb|400px|Schematic of a submerged MBR]]

Membrane bioreactors can be used to reduce the footprint of an activated sludge sewage treatment system by removing some of the liquid component of the mixed liquor. This leaves a concentrated waste product that is then treated using the [[activated sludge]] process.

==History and basic operating parameters==
The MBR process was introduced by the late 1960s, as soon as commercial scale [[ultrafiltration]] (UF) and [[microfiltration]] (MF) membranes were available. The original process was introduced by Dorr-Oliver Inc. and combined the use of an [[activated sludge]] bioreactor with a crossflow membrane filtration loop. The flat sheet membranes used in this process were polymeric and featured pore sizes ranging from 0.003 to 0.01 μm. Although the idea of replacing the [[settling tank]] of the conventional activated sludge process was attractive, it was difficult to justify the use of such a process because of the high cost of membranes, low economic value of the product (tertiary effluent) and the potential rapid loss of performance due to membrane fouling. As a result, the focus was on the attainment of high fluxes, and it was therefore necessary to pump the MLSS at high crossflow velocity at significant energy penalty (of the order 10 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; product) to reduce fouling. Because of the poor economics of the first generation MBRs, they only found applications in niche areas with special needs, such as isolated trailer parks or ski resorts.

The breakthrough for the MBR came in 1989 with Yamamoto and co-workers idea of submerging the membranes in the bioreactor. Until then, MBRs were designed with the separation device located external to the reactor (sidestream MBR) and relied on high transmembrane pressure (TMP) to maintain filtration. With the membrane directly immersed in the bioreactor, submerged MBR systems are usually preferred to sidestream configuration, especially for domestic wastewater treatment. The submerged configuration relies on [[Coarse bubble diffusers|coarse bubble aeration]] to produce mixing and limit fouling. The energy demand of the submerged system can be up to 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of the sidestream systems and submerged systems operate at a lower flux, demanding more membrane area. In submerged configurations, aeration is considered as one of the major parameters in process performance both hydraulic and biological. Aeration maintains solids in suspension, scours the membrane surface and provides oxygen to the biomass, leading to a better biodegradability and cell synthesis.

The other key steps in the recent MBR development were the acceptance of modest fluxes (25 percent or less of those in the first generation), and the idea to use two-phase bubbly flow to control fouling. The lower operating cost obtained with the submerged configuration along with the steady decrease in the membrane cost encouraged an exponential increase in MBR plant installations from the mid 90s. Since then, further improvements in the MBR design and operation have been introduced and incorporated into larger plants. While early MBRs were operated at solid retention times (SRT) as high as 100 days with MLSS up to 30 g/L, the recent trend is to apply lower solid retention times (around 10–20 days), resulting in more manageable MLSS levels (10 to 15 g/L). Thanks to these new operating conditions, the oxygen transfer and the pumping cost in the MBR have tended to decrease and overall maintenance has been simplified. There is now a range of MBR systems commercially available, most of which use submerged membranes although some external modules are available; these external systems also use two-phase flow for fouling control. Typical hydraulic retention times (HRT) range between 3 and 10 hours. In terms of membrane configurations, mainly [[Hollow fiber membrane|hollow fiber]] and flat sheet membranes are applied for MBR applications.&lt;ref name=le-clech1&gt;{{cite journal|author1=P. Le-Clech |author2=V. Chen |author3=A.G. Fane |doi=10.1016/j.memsci.2006.08.019|title=Fouling in membrane bioreactors used in wastewater treatment|year=2006|journal=Journal of Membrane Science|volume=284|pages=17–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wastewater UF membrane system, Aquabio.jpg|thumb|UF membrane side stream configuration]]
Despite the more favourable energy usage of submerged membranes, there continued to be a market for the side stream configuration, particularly in smaller flow industrial applications. For ease of maintenance the side stream configuration can be installed on a lower level in a plant building. Membrane replacement can be undertaken without specialised lifting equipment. As a result, research continued with the side stream configuration, during which time it was found that full scale plants could be operated with higher fluxes. This has culminated in recent years with the development of low energy systems which incorporate more sophisticated control of the operating parameters coupled with periodic back washes, which enable sustainable operation at energy usage as low as 0.3 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of product.

==Configurations==

===Internal/submerged===
The filtration element is installed in either the main bioreactor vessel or in a separate tank. The membranes can be flat sheet or tubular or combination of both, and can incorporate an online backwash system which reduces membrane surface fouling by pumping membrane permeate back through the membrane. In systems where the membranes are in a separate tank to the bioreactor, individual trains of membranes can be isolated to undertake cleaning regimes incorporating membrane soaks, however the biomass must be continuously pumped back to the main reactor to limit MLSS concentration increase. Additional aeration is also required to provide air scour to reduce fouling. Where the membranes are installed in the main reactor, membrane modules are removed from the vessel and transferred to an offline cleaning tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Z. | last2 = Wu | first2 = Z. | last3 = Yin | first3 = X. | last4 = Tian | first4 = L. | year = 2008 | title = Membrane fouling in a submerged membrane bioreactor (MBR) under sub-critical flux operation: Membrane foulant and gel layer characterization | url = | journal = Journal of Membrane Science | volume = 325 | issue = 1| pages = 238–244 | doi = 10.1016/j.memsci.2008.07.035 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===External/sidestream===
The filtration elements are installed externally to the reactor, often in a plant room. The biomass is either pumped directly through a number of membrane modules in series and back to the bioreactor, or the biomass is pumped to a bank of modules, from which a second pump circulates the biomass through the modules in series. Cleaning and soaking of the membranes can be undertaken in place with use of an installed cleaning tank, pump and pipework.

==Major considerations==

===Fouling and fouling control===
The MBR filtration performance inevitably decreases with filtration time. This is due to the deposition of soluble and particulate materials onto and into the membrane, attributed to the interactions between activated sludge components and the membrane. This major drawback and process limitation has been under investigation since the early MBRs, and remains one of the most challenging issues facing further MBR development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.membrane.unsw.edu.au/research/mbr.htm Membrane Bioreactors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308092504/http://www.membrane.unsw.edu.au/research/mbr.htm |date=2008-03-08 }}. membrane.unsw.edu.au&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cui&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Z.F. Cui |author2=S. Chang |author3=A.G. Fane |doi=10.1016/S0376-7388(03)00246-1|title=The use of gas bubbling to enhance membrane processes|year=2003|journal=Journal of Membrane Science|volume=221|pages=1–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent reviews covering membrane applications to bioreactors, it has been shown that, as with other membrane separation processes, membrane fouling is the most serious problem affecting system performance. Fouling leads to a significant increase in hydraulic resistance, manifested as permeate flux decline or transmembrane pressure (TMP) increase when the process is operated under constant-TMP or constant-flux conditions respectively.&lt;ref name=meng&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meng|first1=Fangang|last2=Yang|first2=Fenglin|last3=Shi|first3=Baoqiang|last4=Zhang|first4=Hanmin|title=A comprehensive study on membrane fouling in submerged membrane bioreactors operated under different aeration intensities|journal=Separation and Purification Technology|date=February 2008|volume=59|issue=1|pages=91–100|doi=10.1016/j.seppur.2007.05.040|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383586607002675|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In systems where flux is maintained by increasing TMP, the energy required to achieve filtration increases. Alternatively frequent membrane cleaning is therefore required, increasing significantly the operating costs as a result of cleaning agents and production downtime. More frequent membrane replacement is also expected.

Membrane fouling results from interaction between the membrane material and the components of the activated sludge liquor, which include biological flocs formed by a large range of living or dead microorganisms along with soluble and colloidal compounds. The suspended biomass has no fixed composition and varies both with feed water composition and MBR operating conditions employed. Thus though many investigations of membrane fouling have been published, the diverse range of operating conditions and feedwater matrices employed, the different analytical methods used and the limited information reported in most studies on the suspended biomass composition, has made it difficult to establish any generic behaviour pertaining to membrane fouling in MBRs specifically.

[[Image:MBR FiltrationFactors.jpg|thumb|700 px|Factors influencing fouling (interactions in red)]]
The air-induced cross flow obtained in submerged MBR can efficiently remove or at least reduce the fouling layer on the membrane surface. A recent review reports the latest findings on applications of aeration in submerged membrane configuration and describes the enhancement of performances offered by gas bubbling.&lt;ref name=cui/&gt; As an optimal air flow-rate has been identified behind which further increases in aeration have no effect on fouling removal, the choice of aeration rate is a key parameter in MBR design.

Many other anti-fouling strategies can be applied to MBR applications. They comprise, for example:
*Intermittent permeation or relaxation, where the filtration is stopped at regular time interval before being resumed. Particles deposited on the membrane surface tend to diffuse back to the reactor; this phenomenon being increased by the continuous aeration applied during this resting period.
*Membrane backwashing, where permeate water is pumped back to the membrane, and flow through the pores to the feed channel, dislodging internal and external foulants.
*Air backwashing, where pressurized air in the permeate side of the membrane build up and release a significant pressure within a very short period of time. Membrane modules therefore need to be in a pressurised vessel coupled to a vent system. Air usually does not go through the membrane. If it did, the air would dry the membrane and a rewet step would be necessary, by pressurizing the feed side of the membrane.
*Proprietary anti-fouling products, such as Nalco's Membrane Performance Enhancer Technology.&lt;ref&gt;Nalco. http://www.nalco.com/ASP/applications/membrane_tech/products/mpe.asp . {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607074607/http://www.nalco.com/ASP/applications/membrane_tech/products/mpe.asp |date=June 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, different types/intensities of chemical cleaning may also be recommended:
*Chemically enhanced backwash (daily);
*Maintenance cleaning with higher chemical concentration (weekly);
*Intensive chemical cleaning (once or twice a year).

Intensive cleaning is also carried out when further filtration cannot be sustained because of an elevated transmembrane pressure (TMP). Each of the four main MBR suppliers (Kubota, Evoqua, Mitsubishi and GE Water) have their own chemical cleaning recipes, which differ mainly in terms of concentration and methods (see Table 1). Under normal conditions, the prevalent cleaning agents remain NaOCl ([[sodium hypochlorite]]) and [[citric acid]]. It is common for MBR suppliers to adapt specific protocols for chemical cleanings (i.e. chemical concentrations and cleaning frequencies) for individual facilities.&lt;ref name=le-clech1/&gt;

[[Image:MBR Cleaning.jpg|thumb|550 px|Intensive chemical cleaning protocols for four MBR suppliers (the exact protocol for chemical cleaning can vary from a plant to another)]]

===Biological performances/kinetics===

====COD removal and sludge yield====
Simply due to the high number of microorganism in MBRs, the pollutants uptake rate can be increased. This leads to better degradation in a given time span or to smaller required reactor volumes. In comparison to the conventional activated sludge process (ASP) which typically achieves 95 percent, COD removal can be increased to 96 to 99 percent in MBRs (see table,&lt;ref name=kraume&gt;{{cite journal|author1=M. Kraume |author2=U. Bracklow |author3=M. Vocks |author4=A. Drews |pmid=16004001|year=2005|title=Nutrients removal in MBRs for municipal wastewater treatment|volume=51|issue=6–7|pages=391–402|journal=Water Science and Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;). COD and BOD5 removal are found to increase with MLSS concentration. Above 15 g/L COD removal becomes almost independent of biomass concentration at &gt;96 percent.&lt;ref name=drews&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A. Drews |author2=H. Evenblij |author3=S. Rosenberger |doi=10.1002/ep.10113|title=Potential and drawbacks of microbiology-membrane interaction in membrane bioreactors|year=2005|journal=Environmental Progress|volume=24|issue=4|pages=426–433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arbitrary high MLSS concentrations are not employed, however, as oxygen transfer is impeded due to higher and [[non-Newtonian fluid]] viscosity. Kinetics may also differ due to easier substrate access. In ASP, flocs may reach several 100 μm in size. This means that the substrate can reach the active sites only by diffusion which causes an additional resistance and limits the overall reaction rate (diffusion controlled). Hydrodynamic stress in MBRs reduces floc size (to 3.5 μm in sidestream MBRs) and thereby increases the apparent reaction rate. Like in the conventional ASP, sludge yield is decreased at higher SRT or biomass concentration. Little or no sludge is produced at sludge loading rates of 0.01 kgCOD/(kgMLSS d).&lt;ref&gt;T. Stephenson, S. Judd, B. Jefferson, K. Brindle, Membrane bioreactors for wastewater treatment, IWA Publishing (2000) {{ISBN|1900222078}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the imposed biomass concentration limit, such low loading rates would result in enormous tank sizes or long HRTs in conventional ASP.

====Nutrient removal====
Nutrient removal is one of the main concerns in modern [[wastewater treatment]] especially in areas that are sensitive to [[eutrophication]]. Like in the conventional ASP, currently, the most widely applied technology for N-removal from municipal wastewater is [[nitrification]] combined with [[denitrification]]. Besides phosphorus precipitation, [[enhanced biological phosphorus removal]] (EBPR) can be implemented which requires an additional anaerobic process step. Some characteristics of MBR technology render EBPR in combination with post-denitrification an attractive alternative that achieves very low nutrient effluent concentrations.&lt;ref name=drews/&gt;

[[Image:MBR NutrientRemoval.jpg|thumb|600 px|Nutrients removal in MBRs for municipal wastewater treatment&lt;ref name=kraume/&gt;]]

====Anaerobic MBRs====
[[Anaerobic Membrane Bioreactor|Anaerobic MBRs]] (sometimes abbreviated AnMBR) were introduced in the 1980s in South Africa and currently see a renaissance in research. However, anaerobic processes are normally used when a low cost treatment is required that enables [[energy recovery]] but does not achieve advanced treatment (low carbon removal, no nutrients removal). In contrast, membrane-based technologies enable advanced treatment (disinfection), but at high energy cost. Therefore, the combination of both can only be economically viable if a compact process for energy recovery is desired, or when disinfection is required after anaerobic treatment (cases of water reuse with nutrients). If maximal energy recovery is desired, a single anaerobic process will be always superior to a combination with a membrane process.

Recently, anaerobic MBRs have seen successful full-scale application to the treatment of some types of industrial wastewaters—typically high-strength wastes. Example applications include the treatment of alcohol stillage wastewater in Japan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grant|first=Shannon|author2=Page, Ian |author3=Moro, Masashi |author4= Yamamoto, Tetsuya |title=Full-Scale Applications of the Anaerobic Membrane Bioreactor Process for Treatment of Stillage from Alcohol Production in Japan|journal=Proceedings of the Water Environment Federation|year=2008|series=WEFTEC 2008: Session 101 through Session 115|pages=7556–7570|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/wef/wefproc/2008/00002008/00000007/art00007|accessdate=3 Jan 2013 |doi=10.2175/193864708790894179 |volume=2008|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the treatment of salad dressing/barbecue sauce wastewater in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Christian|first=Scott |author2=Shannon Grant |author3=Peter McCarthy |author4=Dwain Wilson |author5=Dale Mills|title=The First Two Years of Full-Scale Anaerobic Membrane Bioreactor (AnMBR) Operation Treating High-Strength Industrial Wastewater|journal=Water Practice &amp; Technology|year=2011|volume=6|issue=2|doi=10.2166/wpt.2011.032|url=http://www.iwaponline.com/wpt/006/wpt0060032.htm|doi-broken-date=2018-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mixing and hydrodynamics===
Like in any other reactors, the [[hydrodynamics]] (or mixing) within an MBR plays an important role in determining the pollutant removal and fouling control within an MBR.  It has a substantial effect on the energy usage and size requirements of an MBR, therefore the whole life cost of an MBR is high.

The removal of pollutants is greatly influenced by the length of time fluid elements spend in the MBR (i.e. the [[residence time distribution]] or RTD).  The [[residence time distribution]] is a description of the [[hydrodynamics]]/mixing in the system and is determined by the design of the MBR (e.g. MBR size, inlet/recycle flowrates, wall/baffle/mixer/aerator positioning, mixing energy input).  An example of the effect of mixing is that a [[continuous stirred-tank reactor]] will not have as high pollutant conversion per unit volume of reactor as a [[plug flow]] reactor.

The control of fouling, as previously mentioned, is primarily undertaken using coarse bubble aeration.  The distribution of bubbles around the membranes, the shear at the membrane surface for cake removal and the size of the bubble are greatly influenced by the mixing/[[hydrodynamics]] of the system.  The mixing within the system can also influence the production of possible foulants.  For example, vessels not completely mixed (i.e. plug flow reactors) are more susceptible to the effects of shock loads which may cause cell lysis and release of soluble microbial products.

[[Image:MBR-Mixing RTD-and-CFD.jpg|thumb|600 px|Example of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modelling results (streamlines) for a full-scale MBR (Adapted from the Project AMEDEUS – Australian Node Newsletter August 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbr-network.eu/mbr-forum/forum_entry.php?id=194 MBR-Network] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080425045125/http://www.mbr-network.eu/mbr-forum/forum_entry.php?id=194 |date=2008-04-25 }}. mbr-network.eu&lt;/ref&gt;).]]

Many factors affect the hydrodynamics of wastewater processes and hence MBRs.  These range from physical properties (e.g. mixture [[rheology]] and gas/liquid/solid density etc.) to the fluid [[boundary conditions]] (e.g. inlet/outlet/recycle flowrates, baffle/mixer position etc.).  However, many factors are peculiar to MBRs, these cover the filtration tank design (e.g. membrane type, multiple outlets attributed to membranes, membrane packing density, membrane orientation etc.) and its operation (e.g. membrane relaxation, membrane back flush etc.).

The mixing modelling and design techniques applied to MBRs are very similar to those used for conventional activated sludge systems.  They include the relatively quick and easy [[compartmental modelling]] technique which will only derive the RTD of a process (e.g. the MBR) or the process unit (e.g. membrane filtration vessel) and relies on broad assumptions of the mixing properties of each sub-unit.  [[Computational fluid dynamics]] modelling (CFD) on the other hand does not rely on broad assumptions of the mixing characteristics and attempts to predict the hydrodynamics from a fundamental level.  It is applicable to all scales of fluid flow and can reveal much information about the mixing in a process, ranging from the RTD to the shear profile on a membrane surface.  Visualisation of MBR CFD modelling results is shown in the image.

Investigations of MBR hydrodynamics have occurred at many different scales, ranging from examination of shear stress at the membrane surface to RTD analysis of the whole MBR.  Cui et al. (2003)&lt;ref name=cui/&gt; investigated the movement of Taylor bubbles through tubular membranes. Khosravi, M. (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Khosravi, M. and Kraume, M. (2007) Prediction of the circulation velocity in a membrane bioreactor, IWA Harrogate, UK&lt;/ref&gt; examined the entire membrane filtration vessel using CFD and velocity measurements, while Brannock et al. (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Brannock, M.W.D., Kuechle, B., Wang, Y. and Leslie, G. (2007) Evaluation of membrane bioreactor performance via residence time distribution analysis: effects of membrane configuration in full-scale MBRs, IWA Berlin, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; examined the entire MBR using tracer study experiments and RTD analysis.

&lt;!-- Definition and epidemiology--&gt;
'''Menopause''', also known as the '''climacteric''', is the time in most women's lives when [[Menstrual cycle|menstrual period]]s stop permanently, and they are no longer [[fertility|able to bear children]].&lt;ref name=NIH2013Def&gt;{{cite web|title=Menopause: Overview|url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/menopause/Pages/default.aspx|publisher=Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|access-date=8 March 2015|date=2013-06-28|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402111845/http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/menopause/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PubMed2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Menopause: Overview|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0072495/|publisher=PubMedHealth|access-date=8 March 2015|date=29 August 2013|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910181404/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0072495/|archive-date=10 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Menopause typically occurs between 49 and 52 years of age.&lt;ref name=Tak2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi TA, Johnson KM | title = Menopause | journal = The Medical Clinics of North America | volume = 99 | issue = 3 | pages = 521–34 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25841598 | doi = 10.1016/j.mcna.2015.01.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical professionals often define menopause as having occurred when a woman has not had any vaginal bleeding for a year.&lt;ref name=NIH2013Con&gt;{{cite web|title=What is menopause?|url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/menopause/conditioninfo/Pages/default.aspx|publisher=Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|access-date=8 March 2015|date=2013-06-28|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319224154/http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/menopause/conditioninfo/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=19 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be defined by a decrease in [[hormone]] production by the [[Ovary|ovaries]].&lt;ref name=Sie2006&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sievert|first1=Lynnette Leidy|title=Menopause : a biocultural perspective|date=2006|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, N.J.|isbn=9780813538563|page=81|edition=[Online-Ausg.]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fWH606kOGYQC&amp;pg=PA81|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910181403/https://books.google.com/books?id=fWH606kOGYQC&amp;pg=PA81|archive-date=10 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In those who have had surgery to remove their [[uterus]] but still have ovaries, menopause may be viewed to have occurred at the time of the surgery or when their hormone levels fell.&lt;ref name=Sie2006/&gt; Following the removal of the uterus, symptoms typically occur earlier, at an average of 45 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=International position paper on women's health and menopause : a comprehensive approach|date=2002|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=9781428905214|page=36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NCzYsz6Uv0IC&amp;pg=PA36|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910181403/https://books.google.com/books?id=NCzYsz6Uv0IC&amp;pg=PA36|archive-date=10 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Symptoms and prognosis --&gt;
In the years before menopause, a woman's periods typically become irregular,&lt;ref name=NIH2013Sym/&gt;&lt;ref name=NIA2017&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/what-menopause|title=What Is Menopause?|website=National Institute on Aging|language=en|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means that periods may be longer or shorter in duration or be lighter or heavier in the amount of flow.&lt;ref name=NIH2013Sym/&gt; During this time, women often experience [[hot flash]]es; these typically last from 30 seconds to ten minutes and may be associated with shivering, [[sweating]], and reddening of the skin.&lt;ref name=NIH2013Sym/&gt; Hot flashes often stop occurring after a year or two.&lt;ref name=PubMed2013/&gt; Other symptoms may include [[vaginal dryness]], trouble sleeping, and mood changes.&lt;ref name=NIH2013Sym&gt;{{cite web|title=What are the symptoms of menopause?|url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/menopause/conditioninfo/Pages/symptoms.aspx|publisher=Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|access-date=8 March 2015|date=6 May 2013|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320015025/http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/menopause/conditioninfo/Pages/symptoms.aspx|archive-date=20 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The severity of symptoms varies between women.&lt;ref name=PubMed2013/&gt; While menopause is often thought to be linked to an increase in [[heart disease]], this primarily occurs due to increasing age and does not have a direct relationship with menopause.&lt;ref name=PubMed2013/&gt; In some women, problems that were present like [[endometriosis]] or [[painful periods]] will improve after menopause.&lt;ref name=PubMed2013/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause --&gt;
Menopause is usually a natural change.&lt;ref name=NIH2013Ca&gt;{{cite web|title=What causes menopause?|url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/menopause/conditioninfo/Pages/causes.aspx|publisher=Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|access-date=8 March 2015|date=6 May 2013|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402091652/http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/menopause/conditioninfo/Pages/causes.aspx|archive-date=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can occur earlier in those who [[smoke tobacco]].&lt;ref name=NIH2013Con/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warren|first1=volume editors, Claudio N.

&lt;!-- Treatment --&gt;
Specific treatment is not usually needed.&lt;ref name=NIH2013Tx/&gt; Some symptoms, however, may be improved with treatment.&lt;ref name=NIH2013Tx/&gt; With respect to hot flashes, avoiding smoking, caffeine, and alcohol is often recommended.&lt;ref name=NIH2013Tx/&gt; Sleeping in a cool room and using a fan may help.&lt;ref name=NIH2013Tx/&gt; The following medications may help: [[menopausal hormone therapy]] (MHT), [[clonidine]], [[gabapentin]], or [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]].&lt;ref name=NIH2013Tx/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kra2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krause MS, Nakajima ST | title = Hormonal and nonhormonal treatment of vasomotor symptoms | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America | volume = 42 | issue = 1 | pages = 163–79 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25681847 | doi = 10.1016/j.ogc.2014.09.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exercise may help with sleeping problems.&lt;ref name=NIH2013Tx/&gt; While MHT was once routinely prescribed, it is now only recommended in those with significant symptoms, as there are concerns about side effects.&lt;ref name=NIH2013Tx&gt;{{cite web|title=What are the treatments for other symptoms of menopause?|url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/menopause/conditioninfo/Pages/treatments.aspx|publisher=Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|access-date=8 March 2015|date=2013-06-28|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320030632/http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/menopause/conditioninfo/Pages/treatments.aspx|archive-date=20 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; High-quality evidence for the effectiveness of [[alternative medicine]] has not been found.&lt;ref name=PubMed2013/&gt; There is tentative evidence for [[phytoestrogens]].&lt;ref name=Franco2016&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Franco OH, Chowdhury R, Troup J, Voortman T, Kunutsor S, Kavousi M, Oliver-Williams C, Muka T | title = Use of Plant-Based Therapies and Menopausal Symptoms: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis | journal = JAMA | volume = 315 | issue = 23 | pages = 2554–63 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27327802 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2016.8012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Symptoms of menopause (vector).svg|thumb|300px|Symptoms of menopause]]
During early menopause transition, the menstrual cycles remain regular but the interval between cycles begins to lengthen. Hormone levels begin to fluctuate. Ovulation may not occur with each cycle.&lt;ref name=Hoffman2012/&gt;

The date of the final menstrual period is usually taken as the point when menopause has occurred.&lt;ref name=Hoffman2012&gt;{{cite book | last = Hoffman | first = Barbara | title = Williams gynecology | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | year = 2012 | isbn = 9780071716727|pages=555–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the menopausal transition and after menopause, women can experience a wide range of symptoms.

===Vagina and uterus===
During the transition to menopause, [[Menstrual cycle|menstrual patterns]] can show shorter cycling (by 2–7 days);&lt;ref name=Hoffman2012/&gt; longer cycles remain possible.&lt;ref name=Hoffman2012/&gt; There may be [[Irregular menstruation|irregular bleeding]] (lighter, heavier, spotting).&lt;ref name=Hoffman2012/&gt; [[Dysfunctional uterine bleeding]] is often experienced by women approaching menopause due to the hormonal changes that accompany the menopause transition. Spotting or bleeding may simply be related to vaginal atrophy, a benign sore ([[Polyp (medicine)|polyp]] or lesion), or may be a functional endometrial response. The [[European Menopause and Andropause Society]] has released guidelines for assessment of the [[endometrium]], which is usually the main source of spotting or bleeding.&lt;ref name="pmid23619009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dreisler E, Poulsen LG, Antonsen SL, Ceausu I, Depypere H, Erel CT, Lambrinoudaki I, Pérez-López FR, Simoncini T, Tremollieres F, Rees M, Ulrich LG | title = EMAS clinical guide: assessment of the endometrium in peri and postmenopausal women | journal = Maturitas | volume = 75 | issue = 2 | pages = 181–90 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23619009 | doi = 10.1016/j.maturitas.2013.03.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In post-menopausal women, however, any genital [[bleeding]] is an alarming symptom that requires an appropriate study to rule out the possibility of malignant diseases.

Symptoms that may appear during menopause and continue through postmenopause include:
*[[Dyspareunia|painful intercourse]]&lt;ref name=Hoffman2012/&gt;
*[[vaginal dryness]]&lt;ref name=Hoffman2012/&gt;
* [[atrophic vaginitis]] – thinning of the membranes of the [[vulva]], the [[vagina]], the [[cervix]], and the outer [[urinary tract]], along with considerable shrinking and loss in elasticity of all of the outer and inner genital areas.

===Other physical===

==Causes==

Menopause can be induced or occur naturally. Induced menopause occurs as a result of medical treatment such as [[chemotherapy]], [[radiotherapy]], [[oophorectomy]], or complications of [[tubal ligation]], [[hysterectomy]], unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or [[leuprorelin]] usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hon.ch/Dossier/MotherChild/gynae_problems/menopausal.html|title=Gynaecologic Problems: Menopausal Problems|publisher=Health on the Net Foundation|access-date=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age===
Menopause typically occurs between 49 and 52 years of age.&lt;ref name=Tak2015/&gt; The majority women have their last period between the ages of 48 and 55. The average age of the last period in the United States is 51 years, in the United Kingdom is 52 years, in Ireland is 50 years and in Australia is 51 years. In [[India]] and the [[Philippines]], the median age of natural menopause is considerably earlier, at 44 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ringa V |year=2000 |title=Menopause and treatments |journal=Quality of Life Research |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=695–707 |doi=10.1023/A:1008913605129 |pmid= |jstor=4036942 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The menopausal transition or perimenopause leading up to menopause usually lasts 7 years (sometimes as long as 14 years).&lt;ref name="NIH2013Def" /&gt;&lt;ref name=NIA2017/&gt;

In rare cases, a woman's ovaries stop working at a very early age, ranging anywhere from the age of [[puberty]] to age 40. This is known as [[premature ovarian failure]] and affects 1 to 2% of women by age 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Podfigurna-Stopa A, Czyzyk A, Grymowicz M, Smolarczyk R, Katulski K, Czajkowski K, Meczekalski B | title = Premature ovarian insufficiency: the context of long-term effects | journal = [[Journal of Endocrinological Investigation]] | volume = 39 | issue = 9 | pages = 983–90 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 27091671 | pmc = 4987394 | doi = 10.1007/s40618-016-0467-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Undiagnosed and untreated [[coeliac disease]] is a risk factor for early menopause. Coeliac disease can present with several non-gastrointestinal symptoms, in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, and most cases escape timely recognition and go undiagnosed, leading to a risk of long-term complications. A strict [[gluten-free diet]] reduces the risk. Women with early diagnosis and treatment of coeliac disease present a normal duration of fertile life span.&lt;ref name=TersigniCastellani&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tersigni C, Castellani R, de Waure C, Fattorossi A, De Spirito M, Gasbarrini A, Scambia G, Di Simone N | title = Celiac disease and reproductive disorders: meta-analysis of epidemiologic associations and potential pathogenic mechanisms | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 582–93 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24619876 | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmu007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LasaZubiaurre&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lasa JS, Zubiaurre I, Soifer LO | title = Risk of infertility in patients with celiac disease: a meta-analysis of observational studies | journal = Arquivos de Gastroenterologia | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 144–50 | date = 2014 | pmid = 25003268 | doi = 10.1590/S0004-28032014000200014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women who have undergone hysterectomy with ovary conservation go through menopause on average 3.7 years earlier than the expected age. Other factors that can promote an earlier onset of menopause (usually 1 to 3 years early) are smoking cigarettes or being extremely thin.&lt;ref name="What causes early menopause"&gt;{{cite web|last=Healthline|title=What causes early menopause|url=http://www.healthline.com/health/menopause/causes-early|publisher=Healthline|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928065554/http://www.healthline.com/health/menopause/causes-early|archive-date=28 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Premature ovarian failure===
[[Premature ovarian failure]] (POF) is the cessation of the ovarian function before the age of 40 years.&lt;ref name=Laissue2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Laissue P | title = Aetiological coding sequence variants in non-syndromic premature ovarian failure: From genetic linkage analysis to next generation sequencing | journal = Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology | volume = 411 | pages = 243–57 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 25960166 | doi = 10.1016/j.mce.2015.05.005 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=-Fenton2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fenton AJ | title = Premature ovarian insufficiency: Pathogenesis and management | journal = Journal of Mid-Life Health | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 147–53 | year = 2015 | pmid = 26903753 | pmc = 4743275 | doi = 10.4103/0976-7800.172292 | type = Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is diagnosed or confirmed by high blood levels of [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) on at least three occasions at least four weeks apart.&lt;ref name="Kalantaridou SN 1006"/&gt;

Known causes of premature ovarian failure include [[autoimmune disorder]]s, [[thyroid]] disease, [[diabetes mellitus]], [[chemotherapy]], being a carrier of the [[fragile X syndrome]] gene, and [[radiotherapy]].&lt;ref name=-Fenton2015 /&gt; However, in about  50–80% of spontaneous cases of premature ovarian failure, the cause is unknown, i.e., it is generally [[idiopathic]].&lt;ref name=Laissue2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kalantaridou SN 1006"&gt;Kalantaridou SN, Davis SR, Nelson LM. ''Endocrinology Metabolism Clinics of North America'', December 1998; 27(4) 989–1006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women who have a functional disorder affecting the reproductive system (e.g., [[endometriosis]], [[polycystic ovary syndrome]], cancer of the reproductive organs) can go into menopause at a younger age than the normal timeframe. The functional disorders often significantly speed up the menopausal process.

An early menopause can be related to [[cigarette]] smoking, higher [[body mass index]], racial and ethnic factors, illnesses, and the [[Oophorectomy|surgical removal of the ovaries]], with or without the removal of the uterus.&lt;ref name="Bucher, et al. 1930"&gt;Bucher, et al. 1930&lt;/ref&gt;

Rates of premature menopause have been found to be significantly higher in fraternal and identical [[twins]]; approximately 5% of twins reach menopause before the age of 40. The reasons for this are not completely understood. Transplants of ovarian tissue between identical twins have been successful in restoring fertility.

===Surgical menopause===

Menopause can be surgically induced by bilateral [[oophorectomy]] (removal of ovaries), which is often, but not always, done in conjunction with removal of the Fallopian tubes (salpingo-oophorectomy) and uterus (hysterectomy).&lt;ref name="STRAW"/&gt; Cessation of menses as a result of removal of the ovaries is called "surgical menopause". Surgical treatments, such as the removal of ovaries, might cause periods to stop altogether.&lt;ref name = "Womenshealth.gov" /&gt; The sudden and complete drop in hormone levels usually produces extreme withdrawal symptoms such as hot flashes, etc. The symptoms of early menopause may be more severe.&lt;ref name = "Womenshealth.gov" /&gt;

Removal of the uterus ''without'' removal of the ovaries does ''not'' directly cause menopause, although pelvic surgery of this type can often precipitate a somewhat earlier menopause, perhaps because of a compromised blood supply to the ovaries.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}. The time between surgery and possible early menopause is due to the fact that ovaries are still producing hormones.&lt;ref name = "Womenshealth.gov" /&gt;

==Mechanism==
[[File:615 Age and Bone Mass.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Bone loss due to menopause occurs due to changes in a woman's hormone levels.]]
The menopausal transition, and postmenopause itself, is a natural change, not usually a disease state or a disorder. The main cause of this transition is the natural depletion and aging of the finite amount of [[oocytes]] ([[ovarian reserve]]). This process is sometimes accelerated by other conditions and is known to occur earlier after a wide range of gynecologic procedures such as [[hysterectomy]] (with and without [[ovariectomy]]), [[endometrial ablation]] and [[uterine artery embolisation]]. The depletion of the ovarian reserve causes an increase in circulating [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) and [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) levels because there are fewer [[oocyte]]s and follicles responding to these hormones and producing estrogen.

The transition has a variable degree of effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen LS, Soares CN, Vitonis AF, Otto MW, Harlow BL | title = Risk for new onset of depression during the menopausal transition: the Harvard study of moods and cycles | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = 385–90 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16585467 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.63.4.385 | series = The Harvard Study of Moods and Cycles }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stages of the menopause transition have been classified according to a woman's reported bleeding pattern, supported by changes in the pituitary [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH) levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Soules MR, Sherman S, Parrott E, Rebar R, Santoro N, Utian W, Woods N | title = Executive summary: Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) | journal = Climacteric | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = 267–72 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11770182 | doi = 10.1080/cmt.4.4.267.272 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In younger women, during a normal [[menstrual cycle]] the ovaries produce [[estradiol]], [[testosterone]] and [[progesterone]] in a cyclical pattern under the control of FSH and [[luteinising hormone]] (LH) which are both produced by the [[pituitary gland]]. During perimenopause (approaching menopause), [[estradiol]] levels and patterns of production remain relatively unchanged or may increase compared to young women, but the cycles become frequently shorter or irregular.&lt;ref name=Prior_2013&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prior JC | title = Perimenopause: the complex endocrinology of the menopausal transition | journal = Endocrine Reviews | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 397–428 | date = August 1998 | pmid = 9715373 | doi = 10.1210/edrv.19.4.0341 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The often observed increase in estrogen is presumed to be in response to elevated FSH levels that, in turn, is hypothesized to be caused by decreased feedback by [[inhibin]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burger HG | title = Diagnostic role of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) measurements during the menopausal transition--an analysis of FSH, oestradiol and inhibin | journal = European Journal of Endocrinology | volume = 130 | issue = 1 | pages = 38–42 | date = January 1994 | pmid = 8124478 | doi = 10.1530/eje.0.1300038 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, decreased inhibin feedback after [[hysterectomy]] is hypothesized to contribute to increased ovarian stimulation and earlier menopause.&lt;ref name="cite journal|pmid=12737673"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nahás E, Pontes A, Traiman P, NahásNeto J, Dalben I, De Luca L | title = Inhibin B and ovarian function after total abdominal hysterectomy in women of reproductive age | journal = Gynecological Endocrinology | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 125–31 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12737673 | doi = 10.1080/713603218 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cite journal|pmid=15661947"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Petri Nahás EA, Pontes A, Nahas-Neto J, Borges VT, Dias R, Traiman P | title = Effect of total abdominal hysterectomy on ovarian blood supply in women of reproductive age | journal = Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–74 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15661947 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The menopausal transition is characterized by marked, and often dramatic, variations in FSH and estradiol levels. Because of this, measurements of these hormones are ''not'' considered to be reliable guides to a woman's exact menopausal status.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Menopause occurs because of the sharp decrease of estradiol and progesterone production by the ovaries. After menopause, estrogen continues to be produced mostly by [[aromatase]] in fat tissues and is produced in small amounts in many other tissues such as ovaries, bone, blood vessels, and the brain where it acts locally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Simpson ER, Davis SR | title = Minireview: aromatase and the regulation of estrogen biosynthesis--some new perspectives | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 142 | issue = 11 | pages = 4589–94 | date = November 2001 | pmid = 11606422 | doi = 10.1210/en.142.11.4589 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The substantial fall in circulating estradiol levels at menopause impacts many tissues, from brain to skin.

In contrast to the sudden fall in estradiol during menopause, the levels of total and free testosterone, as well as [[dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate]] (DHEAS) and [[androstenedione]] appear to decline more or less steadily with age. An effect of natural menopause on circulating [[androgen]] levels has not been observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Davison SL, Bell R, Donath S, Montalto JG, Davis SR | title = Androgen levels in adult females: changes with age, menopause, and oophorectomy | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 90 | issue = 7 | pages = 3847–53 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 15827095 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2005-0212 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus specific tissue effects of natural menopause cannot be attributed to loss of androgenic hormone production.&lt;ref name="Ovarian Androgen Production in Postmenopausal Women"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fogle RH, Stanczyk FZ, Zhang X, Paulson RJ | title = Ovarian androgen production in postmenopausal women | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 92 | issue = 8 | pages = 3040–3 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17519304 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2007-0581 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hot flashes and other vasomotor symptoms accompany the menopausal transition. While many sources continue to claim that hot flashes during the menopausal transition are caused by low estrogen levels, this assertion was shown incorrect in 1935 and, in most cases, hot flashes are observed despite elevated estrogen levels. The exact cause of these symptoms is not yet understood, possible factors considered are higher and erratic variation of estradiol level during the cycle, elevated FSH levels which may indicate hypothalamic dysregulation perhaps caused by missing feedback by inhibin. It has been also observed that the vasomotor symptoms differ during early perimenopause and late menopausal transition and it is possible that they are caused by a different mechanism.&lt;ref name=Prior_2013 /&gt;

Long-term effects of menopause may include [[osteoporosis]], [[vaginal atrophy]] as well as changed metabolic profile resulting in cardiac risks.

===Ovarian aging===
Decreased inhibin feedback after [[hysterectomy]] is hypothesized to contribute to increased ovarian stimulation and earlier menopause. Hastened ovarian aging has been observed after [[endometrial ablation]]. While it is difficult to prove that these surgeries are causative, it has been hypothesized that the [[endometrium]] may be producing endocrine factors contributing to the endocrine feedback and regulation of the ovarian stimulation. Elimination of this factors contributes to faster depletion of the ovarian reserve. Reduced blood supply to the ovaries that may occur as a consequence of hysterectomy and [[uterine artery embolisation]] has been hypothesized to contribute to this effect.&lt;ref name="cite journal|pmid=12737673"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cite journal|pmid=15661947"/&gt;

Impaired DNA repair mechanisms may contribute to earlier depletion of the ovarian reserve during aging.&lt;ref name=Titus&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Titus S, Li F, Stobezki R, Akula K, Unsal E, Jeong K, Dickler M, Robson M, Moy F, Goswami S, Oktay K | title = Impairment of BRCA1-related DNA double-strand break repair leads to ovarian aging in mice and humans | journal = Science Translational Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = 172 | pages = 172ra21 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23408054 | pmc = 5130338 | doi = 10.1126/scitranslmed.3004925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As women age, double-strand breaks accumulate in the DNA of their primordial follicles. Primordial follicles are immature primary oocytes surrounded by a single layer of granulosa cells. An enzyme system is present in oocytes that ordinarily accurately repairs DNA double-strand breaks. This repair system is called "[[homologous recombination]]al repair", and it is especially effective during meiosis. Meiosis is the general process by which germ cells are formed in all sexual eukaryotes; it appears to be an adaptation for efficiently removing damages in germ line DNA.&lt;ref&gt;Harris Bernstein, Carol Bernstein and Richard E. Michod (2011). Meiosis as an Evolutionary Adaptation for DNA Repair. Chapter 19 in ''DNA Repair''. Inna Kruman editor. InTech Open Publisher. {{doi|10.5772/25117}} {{cite web |url=http://www.intechopen.com/books/dna-repair/meiosis-as-an-evolutionary-adaptation-for-dna-repair |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-07-29 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616090717/http://www.intechopen.com/books/dna-repair/meiosis-as-an-evolutionary-adaptation-for-dna-repair |archive-date=16 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Meiosis]].)

Human primary oocytes are present at an intermediate stage of meiosis, termed prophase I (see [[Oogenesis]]). Expression of four key DNA repair genes that are necessary for homologous recombinational repair during meiosis (BRCA1, MRE11, Rad51, and ATM) decline with age in oocytes.&lt;ref name=Titus /&gt; This age-related decline in ability to repair DNA double-strand damages can account for the accumulation of these damages, that then likely contributes to the depletion of the ovarian reserve.

During perimenopause, [[estrogen]] levels average about 20–30% higher than during premenopause, often with wide fluctuations.&lt;ref name="cemcor" /&gt; These fluctuations cause many of the physical changes during perimenopause as well as menopause, especially during the last 1–2 years of perimenopause (before menopause).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chichester M, Ciranni P | title = Approaching menopause (but not there yet!): caring for women in midlife | journal = Nursing for Women's Health | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 320–4 | date = August–September 2011 | pmid = 21884497 | doi = 10.1111/j.175-486X.2011.01652.x | doi-broken-date = 2018-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these changes are [[hot flash]]es, night sweats, difficulty sleeping, mood swings, [[vaginal dryness]] or [[vaginal atrophy|atrophy]], [[Fecal incontinence|incontinence]], [[osteoporosis]], and heart disease.&lt;ref name="cemcor" /&gt; During this period, [[fertility]] diminishes but is not considered to reach zero until the official date of menopause.

In some women, menopause may bring about a sense of loss related to the end of fertility. In addition, this change often occurs when other stressors may be present in a woman's life:

* Caring for, and/or the death of, elderly parents
* [[Empty nest syndrome]] when children leave home
* The birth of grandchildren, which places people of "middle age" into a new category of "older people" (especially in cultures where being older is a state that is looked down on)

Some research appears to show that [[melatonin]] supplementation in perimenopausal women can improve thyroid function and gonadotropin levels, as well as restoring fertility and menstruation and preventing depression associated with menopause.&lt;ref name=Bellipanni_2005&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bellipanni G, DI Marzo F, Blasi F, Di Marzo A | title = Effects of melatonin in perimenopausal and menopausal women: our personal experience | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1057 | issue = 1 | pages = 393–402 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16399909 | doi = 10.1196/annals.1356.030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postmenopause===
The term "postmenopausal" describes women who have not experienced any menstrual flow for a minimum of 12 months, assuming that they have a [[uterus]] and are not pregnant or [[Lactation|lactating]].&lt;ref name="STRAW"/&gt; In women without a uterus, menopause or postmenopause can be identified by a blood test showing a very high FSH level. Thus postmenopause is the time in a woman's life that takes place after her last period or, more accurately, after the point when her ovaries become inactive.

The reason for this delay in declaring postmenopause is because periods are usually erratic at this time of life. Therefore, a reasonably long stretch of time is necessary to be sure that the cycling has ceased. At this point a woman is considered infertile; however, the possibility of becoming pregnant has usually been very low (but not quite zero) for a number of years before this point is reached.

A woman's reproductive hormone levels continue to drop and fluctuate for some time into post-menopause, so hormone withdrawal effects such as hot flashes may take several years to disappear.

A period-like flow during postmenopause, even spotting, may be a sign of [[endometrial cancer]].

==Management==
Perimenopause is a natural stage of life. It is not a disease or a disorder. Therefore, it does not automatically require any kind of medical treatment. However, in those cases where the physical, mental, and emotional effects of perimenopause are strong enough that they significantly disrupt the life of the woman experiencing them, palliative medical therapy may sometimes be appropriate.

In the context of the menopause, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the use of [[estrogen]] in women without a uterus and estrogen plus [[progestin]] in women who have an intact uterus.&lt;ref&gt;The Woman's Health Program Monash University, [http://med.monash.edu.au/sphpm/womenshealth/docs/postmenopausal-hormone-therapy.pdf Oestrogen and Progestin as Hormone Therapy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711003526/http://med.monash.edu.au/sphpm/womenshealth/docs/postmenopausal-hormone-therapy.pdf |date=11 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HRT may be reasonable for the treatment of menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Estrogen and progestogen use in postmenopausal women: 2010 position statement of The North American Menopause Society | journal = Menopause | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 242–55 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20154637 | doi = 10.1097/gme.0b013e3181d0f6b9 | last1 = &amp;Na }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most effective treatment option, especially when delivered as a skin patch.&lt;ref name=HRT2017&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = The 2012 hormone therapy position statement of: The North American Menopause Society | journal = Menopause | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 257–71 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22367731 | pmc = 3443956 | doi = 10.1097/GME.0000000000000921 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sarri G, Pedder H, Dias S, Guo Y, Lumsden MA | title = Vasomotor symptoms resulting from natural menopause: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of treatment effects from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline on menopause | journal = Bjog | volume = 124 | issue = 10 | pages = 1514–1523 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28276200 | doi = 10.1111/1471-0528.14619 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use, however, appears to increase the risk of [[stroke]]s and [[blood clots]].&lt;ref name=boardman2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boardman HM, Hartley L, Eisinga A, Main C, Roqué i Figuls M, Bonfill Cosp X, Gabriel Sanchez R, Knight B | title = Hormone therapy for preventing cardiovascular disease in post-menopausal women | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 3 | pages = CD002229 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25754617 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD002229.pub4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When used for menopausal symptoms some recommend it be used for the shortest time possible and at the lowest dose possible.&lt;ref name=boardman2015 /&gt; Evidence to support long term use however is poor.&lt;ref name=HRT2017/&gt;

HRT may be unsuitable for some women, including those at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, increased risk of thromboembolic disease (such as those with obesity or a history of venous thrombosis) or increased risk of some types of cancer.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There is some concern that this treatment increases the risk of breast cancer.&lt;ref name="ChlebowskiAnderson2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chlebowski RT, Anderson GL | title = Menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer mortality: clinical implications | journal = Therapeutic Advances in Drug Safety | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 45–56 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25922653 | pmc = 4406918 | doi = 10.1177/2042098614568300 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adding [[testosterone]] to hormone therapy has a positive effect on sexual function in postmenopausal women, although it may be accompanied by hair growth, acne and a reduction in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Somboonporn W, Davis S, Seif MW, Bell R | title = Testosterone for peri- and postmenopausal women | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 4 | pages = CD004509 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16235365 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004509.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These side effects diverge depending on the doses and methods of using testosterone.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Selective estrogen receptor modulators===
[[Selective estrogen receptor modulator|SERM]]s are a category of drugs, either synthetically produced or derived from a botanical source, that act selectively as agonists or antagonists on the [[estrogen receptor]]s throughout the body. The most commonly prescribed SERMs are [[raloxifene]] and [[tamoxifen]]. Raloxifene exhibits oestrogen agonist activity on bone and lipids, and antagonist activity on breast and the endometrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Davis SR, Dinatale I, Rivera-Woll L, Davison S | title = Postmenopausal hormone therapy: from monkey glands to transdermal patches | journal = The Journal of Endocrinology | volume = 185 | issue = 2 | pages = 207–22 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15845914 | doi = 10.1677/joe.1.05847 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tamoxifen is in widespread use for treatment of hormone sensitive breast cancer. Raloxifene prevents vertebral fractures in postmenopausal, osteoporotic women and reduces the risk of invasive breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bevers TB | title = The STAR trial: evidence for raloxifene as a breast cancer risk reduction agent for postmenopausal women | journal = Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network | volume = 5 | issue = 8 | pages = 719–24 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17927929 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other medication===
Some of the [[SSRIs]] and [[SNRIs]] appear to provide some relief.&lt;ref name=Kra2015/&gt; Low dose [[paroxetine]] has been [[food and drug administration|FDA]]-approved for hot moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause.&lt;ref name="OrleansLi2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Orleans RJ, Li L, Kim MJ, Guo J, Sobhan M, Soule L, Joffe HV | title = FDA approval of paroxetine for menopausal hot flushes | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 370 | issue = 19 | pages = 1777–9 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24806158 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMp1402080 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They may, however, be associated with sleeping problems.&lt;ref name=Kra2015/&gt;

[[Gabapentin]] or [[clonidine]] may help but does not work as well as hormone therapy.&lt;ref name=Kra2015/&gt; Clonidine may be associated with constipation and sleeping problems.&lt;ref name=Kra2015/&gt;

===Other therapies===
*Lack of lubrication is a common problem during and after perimenopause. Vaginal moisturizers can help women with overall dryness, and lubricants can help with lubrication difficulties that may be present during intercourse. It is worth pointing out that moisturizers and lubricants are different products for different issues: some women complain that their genitalia are uncomfortably dry all the time, and they may do better with moisturizers. Those who need only lubricants do well using them only during intercourse.
*Low-dose prescription vaginal estrogen products such as estrogen creams are generally a safe way to use estrogen topically, to help vaginal thinning and dryness problems (see [[vaginal atrophy]]) while only minimally increasing the levels of estrogen in the bloodstream.
*In terms of managing hot flashes, lifestyle measures such as drinking cold liquids, staying in cool rooms, using fans, removing excess clothing, and avoiding hot flash triggers such as hot drinks, spicy foods, etc., may partially supplement (or even obviate) the use of medications for some women.
*Individual counseling or support groups can sometimes be helpful to handle sad, depressed, anxious or confused feelings women may be having as they pass through what can be for some a very challenging transition time.
*[[Osteoporosis]] can be minimized by [[smoking cessation]], adequate [[vitamin D]] intake and regular weight-bearing exercise. The bisphosphate drug alendronate may decrease the risk of a fracture, in women that have both bone loss and a previous fracture and less so for those with just osteoporosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wells GA, Cranney A, Peterson J, Boucher M, Shea B, Robinson V, Coyle D, Tugwell P | title = Alendronate for the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 1 | pages = CD001155 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18253985 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD001155.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
The cultural context within which a woman lives can have a significant impact on the way she experiences the menopausal transition. Menopause has been described as a subjective experience, with social and cultural factors playing a prominent role in the way menopause is experienced and perceived.

Within the United States, social location affects the way women perceive menopause and its related biological effects. Research indicates that whether a woman views menopause as a medical issue or an expected life change is correlated with her socio-economic status.&lt;ref&gt;Winterich, J. (August 2008).

Ethnicity and geography play roles in the experience of menopause. American women of different ethnicities report significantly different types of menopausal effects. One major study found Caucasian women most likely to report what are sometimes described as psychosomatic symptoms, while African-American women were more likely to report vasomotor symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Avis N, Stellato RC, Bromberger J, Gan P, Cain V, Kagawa-Singer M | year = 2001 | title = Is there a menopausal syndrome? Menopausal status and symptoms across racial/ethnic group | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 52 | issue = 3| pages = 345–56 | doi = 10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00147-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems that Japanese women experience menopause effects, or ''konenki'', in a different way from American women.&lt;ref name="Lock 1998, pp. 410"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lock M | title = Menopause: lessons from anthropology | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 60 | issue = 4 | pages = 410–9 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9710286 | doi = 10.1097/00006842-199807000-00005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese women report lower rates of hot flashes and night sweats; this can be attributed to a variety of factors, both biological and social. Historically, konenki was associated with wealthy middle-class housewives in Japan, i.e., it was a "luxury disease" that women from traditional, inter-generational rural households did not report. Menopause in Japan was viewed as a symptom of the inevitable process of aging, rather than a "revolutionary transition", or a "deficiency disease" in need of management.&lt;ref name="Lock 1998, pp. 410"/&gt;

In Japanese culture, reporting of vasomotor symptoms has been on the increase, with research conducted by Melissa Melby in 2005 finding that of 140 Japanese participants, hot flashes were prevalent in 22.1%.&lt;ref name="pmid16154301"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Melby MK | title = Factor analysis of climacteric symptoms in Japan | journal = Maturitas | volume = 52 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 205–22 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16154301 | doi = 10.1016/j.maturitas.2005.02.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was almost double that of 20 years prior.&lt;ref name="Lock, M 2010, p.87"&gt;Lock, M. &amp; Nguyen, V. (2010) ''An Anthropology of Biomedicine'', Chapter 4 "Local Biologies and Human Difference" (pp. 84–89), West Sussex, Wiley-Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the exact cause for this is unknown, possible contributing factors include significant dietary changes, increased medicalisation of middle-aged women and increased media attention on the subject.&lt;ref name="Lock, M 2010, p.87"/&gt; However, reporting of vasomotor symptoms is still significantly lower than North America.&lt;ref name="pmid15191936"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gold EB, Block G, Crawford S, Lachance L, FitzGerald G, Miracle H, Sherman S | title = Lifestyle and demographic factors in relation to vasomotor symptoms: baseline results from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation | journal = American Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 159 | issue = 12 | pages = 1189–99 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15191936 | doi = 10.1093/aje/kwh168 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, while most women in the United States apparently have a negative view of menopause as a time of deterioration or decline, some studies seem to indicate that women from some Asian cultures have an understanding of menopause that focuses on a sense of liberation and celebrates the freedom from the risk of pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maoz B, Dowty N, Antonovsky A, Wisjenbeck H | year = 1970 | title = Female attitudes to menopause | journal = Social Psychiatry | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 35–40 | doi = 10.1007/BF01539794 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Postmenopausal Indian women can enter [[Hindu]] temples and participate in rituals, marking it as a celebration for reaching an age of wisdom and experience.

Diverging from these conclusions, one study appeared to show that many American women "experience this time as one of liberation and [[self-actualization]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stotland NL | title = Menopause: social expectations, women's realities | journal = Archives of Women's Mental Health | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–8 | date = August 2002 | pmid = 12503068 | doi = 10.1007/s007370200016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
Menopause literally means the "end of monthly cycles" (the end of [[monthly period]]s or [[menstruation]]), from the Greek word ''pausis'' ("pause") and ''mēn'' ("month"). This is a medical [[calque]]; the Greek word for [[menses]] is actually different. In Ancient Greek, the [[menses]] were described in the plural, ''ta emmēnia'', ("the monthlies"), and its modern descendant has been clipped to ''ta emmēna''. The Modern Greek medical term is ''emmenopausis'' in [[Katharevousa]] or ''emmenopausi'' in [[Demotic Greek]].

The word "menopause" was coined specifically for human females, where the end of fertility is traditionally indicated by the permanent stopping of monthly menstruations. However, menopause exists in some other animals, many of which do not have monthly menstruation;&lt;ref name="Walker2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walker ML, Herndon JG | title = Menopause in nonhuman primates? | journal = Biology of Reproduction | volume = 79 | issue = 3 | pages = 398–406 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18495681 | pmc = 2553520 | doi = 10.1095/biolreprod.108.068536 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in this case, the term means a natural end to fertility that occurs before the end of the natural lifespan.

==Evolutionary rationale==
{{main|Disposable soma theory of aging}}
Various theories have been suggested that attempt to suggest evolutionary benefits to the human species stemming from the cessation of women's reproductive capability before the end of their natural lifespan. Explanations can be categorized as adaptive and non-adaptive:

===Non-adaptive hypotheses===

The high cost of female investment in offspring may lead to physiological deteriorations that amplify susceptibility to becoming infertile. This hypothesis suggests the reproductive lifespan in humans has been optimized, but it has proven more difficult in females and thus their reproductive span is shorter. If this hypothesis were true, however, age at menopause should be negatively correlated with reproductive effort&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gaulin SJ | year = 1980 | title = Sexual Dimorphism in the Human Post-reproductive Life-span: Possible Causes | journal = Journal of Human Evolution | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 227–32 | doi = 10.1016/0047-2484(80)90024-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the available data do not support this.&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg, I. (1970), "Fecundity, Fertility and Family Planning". Demography Institute University of Gothenburg Reports. 10: pp. 1–109&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent increase in female [[longevity]] due to improvements in the standard of living and social care has also been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Washburn, S.L. (1981). "Longevity in Primates". In: Aging: Biology and Behavior by McGaugh, J.L. and S. B. Kiesler, S.B. (eds). pp. 11–29. Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult for selection, however, to favour aid to offspring from parents and grandparents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hawkes K | title = Human longevity: the grandmother effect | journal = Nature | volume = 428 | issue = 6979 | pages = 128–9 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 15014476 | doi = 10.1038/428128a }}&lt;/ref&gt; Irrespective of living standards, adaptive responses are limited by physiological mechanisms. In other words, [[senescence]] is programmed and regulated by specific genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ricklefs RE, Wikelski M | year = 2002 | title = The Physiology/Life-history Nexus | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 17 | issue = 10| pages = 462–68 | doi = 10.1016/S0169-5347(02)02578-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early human selection shadow====
While it is fairly common for extant hunter-gatherers to live past age 50 provided that they survive childhood, fossil evidence shows that mortality in adults have decreased over the last 30000 to 50000 years (possibly due to innovations relating to defense from large carnivores and/or decrease in the ratio of large carnivores to humans) and that it was extremely unusual for early Homo sapiens to live to age 50. This discovery have led some biologists to argue that there was no selection for or against menopause at the time at which the ancestor of all modern humans lived in Africa and had not split into different ethnicities, suggesting that menopause is instead a random evolutionary effect of a [[selection shadow]] regarding ageing in early Homo sapiens. It is also argued that since the population fraction of post-menopausal women in early Homo sapiens was so low, menopause had no evolutionary effect on mate selection or social behaviors related to mate selection.&lt;ref&gt;"How Women Got Their Curves and Other Just-So Stories: Evolutionary Enigmas", David Barash, David P. Barash, Judith Eve Lipton 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Arc of Life: Evolution and Health Across the Life Course", Grazyna Jasienska, Diana S. Sherry, Donna J. Holmes 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adaptive hypotheses===

===="Survival of the fittest" hypothesis====
This hypothesis suggests that younger mothers and offspring under their care will fare better in a difficult and predatory environment because a younger mother will be stronger and more agile in providing protection and sustenance for herself and a nursing baby. The various biological factors associated with menopause had the effect of male members of the species investing their effort with the most viable of potential female mates.&lt;ref name="Origin of Species"&gt;{{cite book|last=Darwin|first=Charles | name-list-format = vanc |title=Origin of Species|url=http://www.literature.org/authors/darwin-charles/the-origin-of-species/|access-date=24 September 2013|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003145126/http://www.literature.org/authors/darwin-charles/the-origin-of-species/|archive-date=3 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2016}}
One problem with this hypothesis is that we would expect to see menopause exhibited in the animal kingdom&lt;ref name="Walker2"/&gt; and another problem is that in the case of extended child development, even a female who was relatively young and still agile and attractive (but not very young) when producing a child would lose future support from her male partner due to him seeking out fertile mates when she reaches menopause while the child is still not independent. That would be counterproductive to the supposed adaptation of getting male support as a fertile female and ruin survival for children produced over much of the female's fertile and agile life, unless children were raised in ways that did not rely on support from a male partner which would eliminate that type of resource diverting selection anyway.&lt;ref&gt;"A View to a Kill: Investigating Middle Palaeolithic Subsistence Using an Optimal Foraging perspective", Gerrit Leendert Dusseldorp 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Journey of Adulthood", Helen L. Bee, Barbara R. Bjorklund 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Young female preference hypothesis =====
The young female preference hypothesis proposes that changes in male preferences for younger mates allowed  late-age acting fertility [[Mutation|mutations]] to accumulate in females without any evolutionary penalty, giving rise to menopause. A computer model was constructed to test this hypothesis, and showed that it was feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morton RA, Stone JR, Singh RS | title = Mate choice and the origin of menopause | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 6 | pages = e1003092 | date = 2013-06-13 | pmid = 23785268 | pmc = 3681637 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003092 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, in order for deleterious mutations that affect fertility past roughly age fifty to accumulate, human maximum lifespan had to first be extended to about its present value, and as of 2016 it was unclear if there has been sufficient time since that happened, for such an evolutionary process to occur.&lt;ref name=Takahashi2016&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi M, Singh RS, Stone J | title = A Theory for the Origin of Human Menopause | journal = Frontiers in Genetics | volume = 7 | pages = 222 | date = 2017-01-06 | pmid = 28111590 | pmc = 5216033 | doi = 10.3389/fgene.2016.00222 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Male-biased philopatry hypothesis ====
The male-biased [[philopatry]] theory proposes that male-biased philopatry in social species leads to increased relatedness to the group in relation to female age, making inclusive fitness benefits older females receive from helping the group greater than what they would receive from continued reproduction, which eventually lead to the evolution of menopause.&lt;ref name = "Johnstone_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnstone RA, Cant MA | title = The evolution of menopause in cetaceans and humans: the role of demography | journal = Proceedings. Biological Sciences | volume = 277 | issue = 1701 | pages = 3765–71 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 20591868 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2010.0988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a pattern of male-biased dispersal and local mating, the relatedness of the individuals in the group decreases with female age, leading to a decrease in [[kin selection]] with female age.&lt;ref name = "Johnstone_2010" /&gt; This occurs because a female will stay with her father in her natal group throughout life, initially being closely related to the males and females. Females are born and stay in the group, so relatedness to the females stays about the same. However, throughout time, the older male relatives will die and any sons she gives birth to will disperse, so that local relatedness to males, and therefore the whole group, declines. The situation is reversed in species where males are philopatric and either females disperse, or mating is non-local.&lt;ref name = "Johnstone_2010" /&gt; Under these conditions, a female’s reproductive life begins away from her father and paternal relatives because she was either born into a new group from non-local mating or because she dispersed. In the case of female-biased dispersal, the female is initially equally unrelated with every individual in the group, and with non-local mating, the female is closely related to the females of the group, but not the males since her paternal relatives are in another group. As she gives birth, her sons will stay with her, increasing her relatedness to males in the group overtime and thus her relatedness with the overall group. The common feature that connects these two otherwise different behaviors is male-biased philopatry, which leads to an increase in kin selection with female age.

While not conclusive, evidence does exist to support the idea that female-biased dispersal existed in pre-modern humans. The closest living relatives to humans, [[Chimpanzee|chimpanzees]], [[Bonobo|bonobos]], and both [[Mountain gorilla|mountain gorillas]] and [[Western lowland gorilla|western lowland gorillas]], are female-biased dispersers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lawson Handley LJ, Perrin N | title = Advances in our understanding of mammalian sex-biased dispersal | journal = Molecular Ecology | volume = 16 | issue = 8 | pages = 1559–78 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17402974 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-294x.2006.03152.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of sex specific genetic material, the non-recombining portions of the Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA, show evidence of a prevalence of female-biased dispersal as well; however, these results could also be affected by the effective breeding numbers of males and females in local populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ségurel L, Martínez-Cruz B, Quintana-Murci L, Balaresque P, Georges M, Hegay T, Aldashev A, Nasyrova F, Jobling MA, Heyer E, Vitalis R | title = Sex-specific genetic structure and social organization in Central Asia: insights from a multi-locus study | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 4 | issue = 9 | pages = e1000200 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18818760 | pmc = 2535577 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of female-biased dispersion in hunter-gatherers is not definitive, with some studies supporting the idea,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lawson Handley LJ, Perrin N | title = Advances in our understanding of mammalian sex-biased dispersal | journal = Molecular Ecology | volume = 16 | issue = 8 | pages = 1559–78 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17402974 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-294x.2006.03152.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; and others suggesting there is no strong bias towards either sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sugiyama Y | title = Sex-biased dispersal of human ancestors | journal = Evolutionary Anthropology | volume = 26 | issue = 4 | pages = 172–180 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28815964 | doi = 10.1002/evan.21539 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Killer whale|killer whales]], both sexes mate non-locally with members of a different pod but return to the pod after copulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Bigg MA, Olesiuk PF, Ellis GM, Ford JK, Balcomb KC | title = Social organization and genealogy of resident killer whales (Orcinus orca) in the coastal waters of British Columbia and Washington State. | journal = Report of the International Whaling Commission | year = 1990 | volume = 12 | pages = 383–405. |date=1990-01-01 |url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279895908_Organization_and_genealogy_of_resident_killer_whales_Orcinus_orca_in_the_coastal_waters_of_British_Columbia_and_Washington_State }}&lt;/ref&gt; Demographic data shows that a female’s mean relatedness to the group does increase over time due to increasing relatedness to males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Croft DP, Johnstone RA, Ellis S, Nattrass S, Franks DW, Brent LJ, Mazzi S, Balcomb KC, Ford JK, Cant MA | title = Reproductive Conflict and the Evolution of Menopause in Killer Whales | language = English | journal = Current Biology | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 298–304 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 28089514 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2016.12.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While less well-studied, there is evidence that [[Short-finned pilot whale|short-finned pilot whales]], another menopausal species, also display this behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | vauthors = Heimlich-Boran JR | title = Social organisation of the short-finned pilot whale, Globicephala macrorhynchus, with special reference to the comparative social ecology of delphinids |date=1993 | degree = Doctoral | publisher = University of Cambridge |url=http://aquaticcommons.org/4005/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, mating behavior that increases local relatedness with female age is prevalent in non-menopausal species,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lawson Handley LJ, Perrin N | title = Advances in our understanding of mammalian sex-biased dispersal | journal = Molecular Ecology | volume = 16 | issue = 8 | pages = 1559–78 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17402974 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-294x.2006.03152.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; making it unlikely that it is the only factor that determines if menopause will evolve in a species.

====Mother hypothesis====

The mother hypothesis suggests that menopause was selected for humans because of the extended development period of human offspring and high costs of reproduction so that mothers gain an advantage in reproductive fitness by redirecting their effort from new offspring with a low survival chance to existing children with a higher survival chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Peccei JS | year = 2001 | title = Menopause: Adaptation or Epiphenomenon? | journal = Evolutionary Anthropology | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 43–57 | doi = 10.1002/evan.1013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grandmother hypothesis====

The [[grandmother hypothesis]] suggests that menopause was selected for humans because it promotes the survival of grandchildren. According to this hypothesis, post-reproductive women feed and care for children, adult nursing daughters, and grandchildren whose mothers have weaned them. Human babies require large and steady supplies of glucose to feed the growing brain. In infants in the first year of life, the brain consumes 60% of all calories, so both babies and their mothers require a dependable food supply. Some evidence suggests that hunters contribute less than half the total food budget of most hunter-gatherer societies, and often much less than half, so that foraging grandmothers can contribute substantially to the survival of grandchildren at times when mothers and fathers are unable to gather enough food for all of their children. In general, selection operates most powerfully during times of famine or other privation. So although grandmothers might not be necessary during good times, many grandchildren cannot survive without them during times of famine. Arguably, however, there is no firm consensus on the supposed evolutionary advantages (or simply neutrality) of menopause to the survival of the species in the evolutionary past.

Indeed, analysis of historical data found that the length of a female's post-reproductive lifespan was reflected in the reproductive success of her offspring and the survival of her grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lahdenperä M, Lummaa V, Helle S, Tremblay M, Russell AF | title = Fitness benefits of prolonged post-reproductive lifespan in women | journal = Nature | volume = 428 | issue = 6979 | pages = 178–81 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 15014499 | doi = 10.1038/nature02367 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found comparative effects but only in the maternal grandmother—paternal grandmothers had a detrimental effect on infant mortality (probably due to paternity uncertainty).&lt;ref&gt;Voland, E. and Beise, J. (2002). "Opposite Effects of Maternal and Paternal Grandmothers on Infant Survival in Historical Krummörn". MPIDR WP 2001–026.&lt;/ref&gt; Differing assistance strategies for maternal and paternal grandmothers have also been demonstrated. Maternal grandmothers concentrate on offspring survival, whereas paternal grandmothers increase birth rates.&lt;ref&gt;Mace, R and Sear, R. (2004). "Are Humans Communal Breeders?" In: Voland, E., Chasiotis, A. and Schiefenhoevel, W. (eds). ''Grandmotherhood – the Evolutionary Significance of the Second Half of Female Life''. [[Rutgers University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe a problem concerning the grandmother hypothesis is that it requires a history of female [[philopatry]], while in the present day the majority of hunter-gatherer societies are [[patrilocal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Peccei JS | title = A critique of the grandmother hypotheses: old and new | journal = American Journal of Human Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 434–52 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11400215 | doi = 10.1002/ajhb.1076 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is disagreement split along ideological lines about whether [[patrilineality]] would have existed before modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://libcom.org/history/engels-was-right-early-human-kinship-was-matrilineal|title=Engels was Right: Early Human Kinship was Matrilineal|publisher=|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227062103/http://libcom.org/history/engels-was-right-early-human-kinship-was-matrilineal|archive-date=27 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe variations on the mother, or grandmother effect fail to explain longevity with continued spermatogenesis in males (oldest verified paternity is 94 years, 35 years beyond the oldest documented birth attributed to females).&lt;ref&gt;10. Finch, C.E. 1990. Longevity senescence and the genome. University of Chicago Press. London.&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the survival time past menopause is roughly the same as the maturation time for a human child. That a mother's presence could aid in the survival of a developing child, while an unidentified father's absence might not have affected survival, could explain the paternal fertility near the end of the father's lifespan.&lt;ref name="pmid17492968"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pavard S, Sibert A, Heyer E | title = The effect of maternal care on child survival: a demographic, genetic, and evolutionary perspective | journal = Evolution; International Journal of Organic Evolution | volume = 61 | issue = 5 | pages = 1153–61 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17492968 | doi = 10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00086.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A man with no certainty of which children are his may merely attempt to father additional children, with support of existing children present but small. Note the existence of partible paternity supporting this.&lt;ref name="pmid20974947"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walker RS, Flinn MV, Hill KR | title = Evolutionary history of partible paternity in lowland South America | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 45 | pages = 19195–200 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 20974947 | pmc = 2984172 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1002598107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that the mother and grandmother hypotheses fail to explain the detrimental effects of losing ovarian follicular activity, such as [[osteoporosis]], [[osteoarthritis]], [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[coronary artery disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Massart F, Reginster JY, Brandi ML | title = Genetics of menopause-associated diseases | journal = Maturitas | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 103–16 | date = November 2001 | pmid = 11716989 | doi = 10.1016/S0378-5122(01)00283-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theories discussed above assume that evolution directly selected for menopause. Another theory states that menopause is the byproduct of the evolutionary selection for [[follicular atresia]], a factor that causes menopause. Menopause results from having too few ovarian follicles to produce enough estrogen to maintain the ovarian-pituitary-hypothalamic loop, which results in the cessation of menses and the beginning of menopause. Human females are born with approximately a million oocytes, and approximately 400 oocytes are lost to ovulation throughout life.&lt;ref&gt;Leidy, L. "Menopause in evolutionary perspective". in: Trevathan WR, McKenna JJ, Smith EO (Eds.) ''Evolutionary Medicine''. Oxford University Press, pp. 407–27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Clinical Obstetrics and Gynaecology|date=2014|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780702054105|page=69|edition=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rsc0AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Reproductive conflict hypothesis =====
In social [[Vertebrate|vertebrates]], the sharing of resources among the group places limits on how many offspring can be produced and supported by members of the group. This creates a situation in which each female must compete with others of the group to ensure they are the one that reproduces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clutton-Brock TH, Hodge SJ, Spong G, Russell AF, Jordan NR, Bennett NC, Sharpe LL, Manser MB | title = Intrasexual competition and sexual selection in cooperative mammals | language = En | journal = Nature | volume = 444 | issue = 7122 | pages = 1065–8 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17183322 | doi = 10.1038/nature05386 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reproductive conflict hypothesis proposes that this female reproductive conflict favors the cessation of female reproductive potential in older age to avoid reproductive conflict, increasing the older female’s fitness through [[Inclusive fitness|inclusive]] benefits. Female-biased dispersal or non-local mating leads to an increase in relatedness to the social group with female age.&lt;ref name = "Johnstone_2010" /&gt; In the human case of female-biased dispersal, when a young female enters a new group, she is not related to any individual and she reproduces to produce an offspring with a [[Coefficient of relationship|relatedness]] of 0.5. An older female could also choose to reproduce, producing an offspring with a relatedness of 0.5, or she could refrain from reproducing and allow another pair to reproduce. Because her relatedness to males in the group is high, there is a fair probability that the offspring will be her grandchild with a relatedness of 0.25. The younger female experiences no cost to her inclusive fitness from using the resources necessary to successfully rear offspring since she is not related to members of the group, but there is a cost for the older female. As a result, the younger female has the advantage in reproductive competition. Although a female killer whale born into a social group is related to some members of the group, the whale case of non-local mating leads to similar outcomes because the younger female relatedness to the group as a whole is less than the relatedness of the older female. This behavior makes more likely the cessation of reproduction late in life to avoid reproductive conflict with younger females.

Research using both human and killer whale demographic data has been published that supports the role of reproductive conflict in the evolution of menopause. Analysis of demographic data from pre-industrial Finnish populations found significant reductions in offspring survivorship when mothers-in-laws and daughters-in-laws had overlapping births,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lahdenperä M, Gillespie DO, Lummaa V, Russell AF | title = Severe intergenerational reproductive conflict and the evolution of menopause | journal = Ecology Letters | volume = 15 | issue = 11 | pages = 1283–1290 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 22913671 | doi = 10.1111/j.1461-0248.2012.01851.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; supporting the idea that avoiding reproductive conflict is beneficial to offspring survivorship. Humans, more so than other primates, rely on food sharing for survival,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jaeggi AV, Gurven M | title = Natural cooperators: food sharing in humans and other primates | journal = Evolutionary Anthropology | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 186–95 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23943272 | doi = 10.1002/evan.21364 | url = https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/evan.21364 }}&lt;/ref&gt; so the large survivorship reduction values could be caused by a straining of community resources. Avoiding such straining is a possible explanation for why the reproductive overlap seen in humans is much lower than other primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cant MA, Johnstone RA | title = Reproductive conflict and the separation of reproductive generations in humans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 105 | issue = 14 | pages = 5332–6 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18378891 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0711911105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Food sharing is also prevalent among another menopausal species, killer whales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Wright BM, Stredulinsky EH, Ellis GM, Ford JK | title = Kin-directed food sharing promotes lifetime natal philopatry of both sexes in a population of fish-eating killer whales, Orcinus orca. | journal = Animal Behaviour | date = May 2016 | volume = 115 | pages = 81–95 | doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2016.02.025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reproductive conflict has also been observed in killer whales, with increased calf mortality seen when reproductive overlap between a younger and older generational female occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Croft DP, Johnstone RA, Ellis S, Nattrass S, Franks DW, Brent LJ, Mazzi S, Balcomb KC, Ford JK, Cant MA | title = Reproductive Conflict and the Evolution of Menopause in Killer Whales | language = English | journal = Current Biology | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 298–304 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 28089514 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2016.12.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other animals==
Menopause in the animal kingdom appears to be uncommon, but the presence of this phenomenon in different species has not been thoroughly researched. [[Biological life cycle|Life histories]] show a varying degree of [[senescence]]; rapid senescing organisms (e.g., [[Pacific salmon]] and [[annual plants]]) do not have a post-reproductive life-stage. Gradual senescence is exhibited by all [[placental mammal]]ian life histories.

Menopause has been observed in several species of nonhuman [[primates]],&lt;ref name="Walker2"/&gt; including [[rhesus monkeys]]&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Walker ML | title=Menopause in female rhesus monkeys|journal=Am J Primatol|volume=35|pages=59–71|year=1995 | doi = 10.1002/ajp.1350350106}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[chimpanzees]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowden, D.

Dogs do not experience menopause; the [[Canine reproduction#The reproductive cycle|canine estrus cycle]] simply becomes irregular and infrequent.

One key focus of the study relates to the effects of [[Hormone replacement therapy (menopause)|hormone replacement therapy]] use on women's health.  The study has confirmed the findings in the [[Women's Health Initiative]] (WHI) that women currently using HRT are more likely to develop breast cancer than those who are not using HRT.

Results from the Million Women Study, together with those of the WHI trial from the USA, have influenced national policy, including recent recommendations on the prescribing and use of hormone replacement therapy from the [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] and from the [[Commission on Human Medicines]].

==Study design==
The Million Women Study is a multi-centre, population-based prospective cohort study of women aged 50 and over invited to routine [[breast cancer]] screening in the UK. Between 1996 and 2001, women were invited to join the Million Women Study when they received their invitation to attend breast screening at one of 66 participating NHS Breast Screening Centres in the UK. At these centres, women received a study questionnaire with their invitation, which they were asked to complete and return at the time of screening. Around 70% of those attending the programme returned questionnaires and agreed to take part in the study, over 1 in 4 women in the UK in the target age group. The Million Women Study is the largest study of its kind in the world.&lt;ref name="millionwomenstudy1"/&gt;

==Aims==
The Million Women Study was set up with the aim of recruiting 1,000,000 women in the UK into a cohort study, to provide answers to the following questions: 
* What effects do combined estrogen and progestogen hormone replacement therapy (HRT) preparations have on breast cancer risk?
* Are breast cancers detected at screening in women who have used HRT or oral contraceptives different in terms of size and invasiveness from the cancers detected in women who have never used these hormones?
* How does HRT use affect the efficacy of breast cancer screening?
* How does HRT use affect mortality from breast cancer and other conditions?

==Findings==

===HRT and breast cancer===
Initial analysis of the results from over 1 million women in the Million Women Study appeared to confirm preliminary findings from other studies at the turn of the century finding that women currently using progestin-estrogen HRT were more likely to develop breast cancer than those who are not using HRT. This initial analysis received extensive press coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Current users of estrogen-progestogen HRT were at 2 fold increased risk of developing breast cancer, and current users of estrogen-only HRT appeared to have a 1.3 fold risk. Use of HRT by women aged 50–64 in the UK in the decade from 1993-2003 was estimated to have caused 20,000 extra breast cancers.  Past users were not seen as having increased risk.

Upon reanalysis by the authors, the initial conclusion that HRT increased the risk of breast cancer was retracted in a 2012 paper in the ''Journal of Family Planning and Reproductive Health Care''. The paper's authors, led by Samuel Shapiro of the [[University of Cape Town]], revealed that the study had not in fact establish a causal relationship between HRT and breast cancer, and admitted that their original analysis had been flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shapiro|first1=S.|last2=Farmer|first2=R.

===HRT and endometrial (womb) cancer===
It is well known that post-menopausal women who have not had a [[hysterectomy]] are at increased risk of cancer of the [[endometrium]] (the lining of the womb) if they take estrogen-only HRT. Follow up of over 700 000 women in the Million Women Study confirmed this and showed that the risk of endometrial cancer is also increased in women who take tibolone; but is not altered, or may even be reduced, in women taking combined estrogen-progestogen HRT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These effects depend also on a woman’s body mass index (BMI, a measure of obesity) such that adverse effects of tibolone and estrogen-only HRT are greatest in thinner women, and the beneficial effects of combined HRT are greatest in fatter women.

===HRT and ovarian cancer===
Results of the study show a small increase in risk of ovarian cancer in women taking HRT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an increased risk had been suspected from some previous studies, and has now been confirmed with the larger numbers available in this study. The findings come from analyses on 948,576 post-menopausal women in the study, followed up for about 5 years. Women currently taking HRT were at higher risk of developing and of dying from ovarian cancer than women not using HRT. Past users were not at increased risk. The risk in current users was increased about 1.2 fold; for every 1000 women using HRT, 2.6 developed ovarian cancer over 5 years, compared with 2.2 in those not taking HRT. The risk was the same for estrogen-only, combined estrogen-progestogen and other types of HRT (including tibolone) and did not vary by specific type of estrogen or progestogen, or between oral and transdermal (patch) administration.

These results are equivalent to one extra case of ovarian cancer for every 2500 women taking HRT, and one extra death from ovarian cancer per 3300 women taking HRT, over 5 years. Publishers of these studies say that the results need to be looked at in the context of the other risks and benefits of HRT. In particular, an estimation of the overall effect of HRT use on three common cancers in women: breast cancer, endometrial (womb) cancer and ovarian cancer. Together, these cancers account for about 4 in 10 cancers in women in the UK. According to the findings, in women aged 50–69, about 19 of these cancers will develop over 5 years in every 1000 women not taking HRT. In women taking HRT the estimate is for the number of cancers to be increased to about 31. The overall increased risk is higher in women using combined estrogen-progestogen HRT than in women using estrogen-only HRT because most of the overall increase is due to an increase in breast cancer, and users of combined HRT have a higher risk of breast cancer than users of estrogen-only HRT.

===Alcohol and cancer===
The study has also found that low to moderate [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] consumption increases the risk of a variety of types of cancer in women, including [[breast cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allen|first1=N.

In contrast to the increase in HRT prescriptions between 1991 and 1996, which remained stable through to 2001, sales of HRT fell by 50% between 2002 and 2005 following the publication of the Million Women Study and the Women's Health Initiative study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

A number of recent studies have shown that the Million Women Study continues to impact women’s health and behavioural patterns in Europe. Research examining breast cancer incidence trends in Sweden between 1997 and 2007, showed that the prevalence of HRT use in women aged 50–59 years decreased from a peak of 36% in 1999 to 9% in 2007, a parallel decrease in incidence of breast cancer was also reported between 2003 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In 2005, most NHS trusts estimated that around half of their staff were suffering from workplace stress, but less than a third of health service managers that responded were able to say that their trusts had a stress management policy at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4399930.stm |title=NHS staff stress rife, bosses say |work=BBC News |date=2 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 they launched a ''Speaking Up Charter'', asking [[NHS trust]]s to commit to actions that would help staff to raise concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-31362196 |title=NHS 'to get whistleblower guardians’ |first=Nick |last=Triggle |work=BBC News |date=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014 they published statistics highlighting the proportion of women in various sections of the NHS workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independentnurse.co.uk/news/nhs-employers-publishes-gender-statistics/64414 |title=NHS Employers publishes gender statistics |first=Alex |last=Turnbull |work=Independent Nurse |date=2 June 2014 |accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson became the APA's first African-American CEO when he was named to the post in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2002/09/anderson.aspx|title=Norman B. Anderson Named Next CEO of the American Psychological Association|website=http://www.apa.org|access-date=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the editor for the APA journal ''[[American Psychologist]]''.&lt;ref name="apa-biography"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/about/governance/council/members/norman-b-anderson.aspx |title=Anderson biography at apa.org|accessdate=July 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to joining APA Anderson was an Associate Director of the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), and held other roles in academia.

==Early life==
Anderson was born October 16, 1955, in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], to Rev. Dr. Charles W. and Rev. Dr. Lois J. Anderson. A graduate of the [[North Carolina Central University]] in Durham, N.C., Anderson earned master's and doctoral degrees in clinical psychology from the [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uncgnow.uncg.edu/anderson-will-receive-honorary-degree-deliver-commencement-speech/|title=Anderson will receive honorary degree, deliver commencement speech|website=uncgnow.uncg.edu|access-date=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received additional clinical and research training at the schools of medicine at [[Brown University|Brown]] and [[Duke University|Duke Universities]], including postdoctoral fellowships in psychophysiology and aging at Duke.  Anderson also received training in Mindfulness Facilitation from the UCLA Mindful Awareness Research Center&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://marc.ucla.edu/|title=UCLA Mindful Awareness Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|University of California at Los Angeles]]. In addition, Dr. Anderson is trained as a Certified Executive and Professional Coach through the College of Executive Coaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.executivecoachcollege.com/|title=College of Executive Coaching}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Anderson was the founding Associate Director of the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) in charge of social and behavioral science, and was the first Director of the NIH Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://obssr.od.nih.gov/|title=OBSSR}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At NIH, he facilitated behavioral and social sciences research across all of the Institutes and Centers of the NIH.  Research in the behavioral and social research was under his purview in areas such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, children's health, mental health, minority health, aging, and oral health.  His special focus at NIH was in sociocultural determinants of health, and in advancing an integrated, trans-disciplinary, bio-psycho-social approach to health science, health promotion, prevention, and health care.

In addition to his formal leadership roles, Anderson served as a tenured associate professor of medical psychology and of psychology at [[Duke University]] and as a professor of health and social behavior at the [[Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health|Harvard School of Public Health]]. 

In 2012, he was elected to the [[National Academy of Medicine|Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine)]], which is part of the [[National Academy of Sciences]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

In addition to publishing dozens of scientific articles,  Anderson is the author or editor of several books.  He served as editor-in-chief of the two-volume ''Encyclopedia of Health and Behavior'' (2003) and as co-editor of ''Interdisciplinary research: Case studies from health and social science'' (2008). For over 12 years he was editor-in-chief of APA's flagship journal, ''[[American Psychologist]]''.

With his wife, P. Elizabeth Anderson, he wrote a health book for the general public, ''Emotional Longevity: What Really Determines How Long You Live,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Emotional Longevity: What Really Determines How Long You Live|last2=Anderson|first2=P. Elizabeth|date=2004, ©2003|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9780142003954|location=New York|last1=Anderson|first1=Norman B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powells.com/biblio/63-9780142003954-0|title=Emotional Longevity: What Really Determines How Long You Live|author=Roger Hobbs|work=powells.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; released in 2003.

Anderson retired from APA in July 14, 2015, following an APA authorized independent review report relating to ethics guidelines conducted by former assistant Assistant U.S. Attorney [[David H. Hoffman]]. Prior to the report's release, Anderson had informed the board that he would be retiring at the end of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apa.org/news/press/releases/2015/07/retirements-resignation.aspx|title=APA Announces Retirements and Resignation of Senior Leaders|website=http://www.apa.org|access-date=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Obstructed labour''', also known as '''labour dystocia''', is when, even though the [[uterus]] is contracting normally, the baby does not exit the pelvis during [[childbirth]] due to being physically blocked.&lt;ref name=WHO2008S1/&gt; Complications for the baby include [[Perinatal asphyxia|not getting enough oxygen]] which may result in death.&lt;ref name=BMJ2003/&gt; It increases the risk of the mother getting an [[puerperal infection|infection]], having [[uterine rupture]], or having [[post-partum bleeding]].&lt;ref name=BMJ2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neilson|first1=JP|last2=Lavender|first2=T|last3=Quenby|first3=S|last4=Wray|first4=S|title=Obstructed labour.|journal=British Medical Bulletin|date=2003|volume=67|pages=191–204|pmid=14711764|doi=10.1093/bmb/ldg018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long term complications for the mother include [[obstetrical fistula]].&lt;ref name=WHO2008S1/&gt; Obstructed labour is said to result in [[prolonged labour]], when the active phase of labour is longer than twelve hours.&lt;ref name=WHO2008S1/&gt;

&lt;!-- Causes and diagnosis --&gt;

==Cause==
The main causes of obstructed labour include: a large or abnormally positioned baby, a small [[pelvis]], and problems with the birth canal.&lt;ref name=WHO2008S1/&gt;  Both the size and the position of the fetus can lead to obstructed labor. Abnormal positioning includes [[shoulder dystocia]] where the anterior shoulder does not pass easily below the [[pubic bone]].&lt;ref name=WHO2008S1/&gt; A small pelvis of the mother can be a result of many factors. Risk factors for a small pelvis include [[malnutrition]] and a lack of exposure to sunlight causing [[vitamin D deficiency]].&lt;ref name=WHO2008S2/&gt; A deficiency in calcium can also result in a small pelvis as the structures of the pelvic bones will be weak due to the lack of calcium.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Konje|first=Justin C|last2=Ladipo|first2=Oladapo A|date=2000-07-01|title=Nutrition and obstructed labor|url=https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/72/1/291S/4729711|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|language=en|volume=72|issue=1|pages=291S–297S|doi=10.1093/ajcn/72.1.291s|issn=0002-9165}}&lt;/ref&gt; A relationship between maternal height and pelvis size is present and can be used to predict the possibility of obstructed labor. This relationship is a result of the mother's nutritional health throughout her life leading up to childbirth.&lt;ref name="BMJ2003" /&gt;Younger mothers are also at more risk for obstructed labor due to growth of the pelvis not being completed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Problems with the birth canal include a narrow vagina and perineum which may be due to [[female genital mutilation]] or [[tumors]].&lt;ref name=WHO2008S1/&gt; All of these mechanical factors lead to a failure to progress in labor.

=== Evolution ===
Obstructed labor is unique to humans compared to other primates. The evolution of humans to become obligate bipedal and increase in brain size create the problems associated with obstructed labor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wittman|first=Anna Blackburn|last2=Wall|first2=L Lewis|date=2007-11|title=The Evolutionary Origins of Obstructed Labor: Bipedalism, Encephalization, and the Human Obstetric Dilemma|url=https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00006254-200711000-00023|journal=Obstetrical &amp; Gynecological Survey|language=ENGLISH|volume=62|issue=11|pages=739–748|doi=10.1097/01.ogx.0000286584.04310.5c|issn=0029-7828}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order for bipedal locomotion to be possible, many changes had to occur to the skeletal structure of humans, especially in the pelvis. Both the shape and orientation of the pelvis changed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other primates have straighter and wider pelvises compared to humans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A narrow pelvis is better for bipedal locomotion but makes childbirth more difficult. The pelvis is sexually dimorphic, with females having a wider pelvis to be better suited for childbirth. However, the female pelvis still must accommodate for bipedal locomotion which is what creates the challenges for obstructed labor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The brain size of humans have also increased as the species has evolved. This creates a larger head of the fetus that must exit the womb. This requires human infant to be born less developed when compared to other species. The bones of the skull are not fused when a human infant is born in order to prevent the head from becoming too large to exit the womb. The head of the fetus is still large and poses the possibility for obstructed labor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Obstructed labour is usually diagnosed based on physical examination.&lt;ref name=WHO2008S3/&gt; Ultrasound can be used to predict malpresentation of the fetus.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In examination of the cervix once labor has begun, all examinations are compared to regular cervical assessments. The comparison between the average cervical assessment and the current state of the mother allows for a diagnosis of obstructed labor.&lt;ref name="BMJ2003" /&gt; An increasingly long time in labor also indicates a mechanical issue that is preventing the fetus from exiting the womb.&lt;ref name="BMJ2003" /&gt;

== Prevention ==
Access to proper health services can reduce the prevalence of obstructed labor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Less developed areas have inadequate health services to attend to obstructed labor, resulting in a higher prevalence among less developed area. Improving nutrition of female, both before and during pregnancy, is important for reducing the risk of obstructive labor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Creating education programs about reproduction and increasing access to reproductive services such as contraception and family planning in developing areas can also reduce the prevalence of obstructed labor.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Treatment==
Before considering surgical options, changing the posture of the mother during labor can help to progress labor.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hofmeyr|first=G.J|date=2004-05-19|title=Obstructed labor: using better technologies to reduce mortality|url=https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.ijgo.2004.01.011|journal=International Journal of Gynecology &amp; Obstetrics|language=en|volume=85|pages=S62–S72|doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2004.01.011|issn=0020-7292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment of obstructed labour may require [[cesarean section]] or vacuum extraction with possible [[symphysiotomy|surgical opening of the symphysis pubis]].&lt;ref name=WHO2008S6/&gt; Caesarean section is an invasive method but is often the only method that will save the lives of both the mother and the infant.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Symphysiotomy is the surgical opening of the symphysis pubis. This procedure can be completed more rapidly than Caesarean sections and does not require anesthesia, making it a more accessible option in places with less advanced medical technology.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This procedure also leaves no scars on the uterus which makes further pregnancies and births safer for the mother.&lt;ref name="BMJ2003" /&gt; Another important factor in treating obstructed labor is monitoring the energy and hydration of the mother.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Contractions of the uterus require energy, so the longer the mother is in labor the more energy she expends. When the mother is depleted of energy, the contractions become weaker and labor will become increasingly longer.&lt;ref name="BMJ2003" /&gt; Antibiotics are also an important treatment as infection is a possible result of obstructed labor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Prognosis ==
If [[cesarean section]] is obtained in a timely manner, prognosis is good.&lt;ref name="BMJ2003" /&gt; Prolonged obstructed labour can lead to [[stillbirth]], [[obstetric fistula]], and [[maternal death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carmen Dolea, Carla AbouZahr|first=|date=July 2003|title=Global burden of obstructed labour in the year 2000|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/bod_obstructedlabour.pdf|journal=Evidence and Information for Policy (EIP), World Health Organization|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fetal death can be caused by asphyxia.&lt;ref name="BMJ2003" /&gt; Obstructed labor is the leading cause of uterine rupture worldwide.&lt;ref name="BMJ2003" /&gt; Maternal death can result from uterine rupture, complications during caesarean section, or sepsis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Epidemiology==
In 2013 it resulted in 19,000 maternal deaths down from 29,000 deaths in 1990.&lt;ref name=GDB2013/&gt; Globally, obstructed labor accounts for 8% of maternal deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khan|first=Khalid S|last2=Wojdyla|first2=Daniel|last3=Say|first3=Lale|last4=Gülmezoglu|first4=A Metin|last5=Van Look|first5=Paul FA|date=2006-04|title=WHO analysis of causes of maternal death: a systematic review|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673606683979|journal=The Lancet|volume=367|issue=9516|pages=1066–1074|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(06)68397-9|issn=0140-6736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word dystocia means difficult labour.&lt;ref name=BMJ2003/&gt; Its [[antonym]] is eutocia ({{lang-grc|τόκος|tókos|childbirth}}) or easy labour.

Other terms for obstructed labour include: difficult labour, abnormal labour, difficult childbirth, abnormal childbirth, and dysfunctional labour.

==Other animals==
The term can also be used in the context of various animals. Dystocia pertaining to birds and reptiles is also called [[egg binding]].

In part due to extensive selective breeding, miniature horse mares experience dystocias more frequently than other breeds.

'''Physical fitness''' is a state of [[health]] and [[well-being]] and, more specifically, the ability to perform aspects of [[Outline of sports|sports]],  occupations and daily activities. Physical fitness is generally achieved through proper [[nutrition]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tremblay MS, Colley RC, Saunders TJ, Healy GN, Owen N | title = Physiological and health implications of a sedentary lifestyle | journal = Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism = Physiologie Appliquee, Nutrition et Metabolisme | volume = 35 | issue = 6 | pages = 725–40 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21164543 | doi = 10.1139/H10-079 }}&lt;/ref&gt; moderate-vigorous [[physical exercise]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Groot GC, Fagerström L | title = Older adults' motivating factors and barriers to exercise to prevent falls | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Occupational Therapy | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 153–60 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 20545467 | doi = 10.3109/11038128.2010.487113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and sufficient rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Physical activity and health of youth | vauthors = Malina R  | publisher = Ovidius University Annals, Series Physical Education and Sport/Science, Movement and Health|year = 2010|isbn = |location = Constanta|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the industrial revolution, ''fitness'' was defined as the capacity to carry out the day’s activities without undue fatigue. However, with automation and changes in lifestyles ''physical fitness'' is now considered a measure of the body's ability to function efficiently and effectively in work and leisure activities, to be [[healthy]], to resist [[hypokinetic diseases]], and to meet emergency situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports Definitions for Health, Fitness, and Physical Activity |url=http://www.fitness.gov/digest_mar2000.htm |archive-date=12 July 2012 |publisher=fitness.gov |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712201046/http://www.fitness.gov/digest_mar2000.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
== Fitness ==
Fitness is defined&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fitness}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the quality or state of being fit. Around 1950, perhaps consistent with the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the treatise of [[World War II]], the term "fitness" increased in western vernacular by a factor of ten.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=7&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;content=fitness&amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2Cfitness%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bfitness%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BFitness%3B%2Cc0 "Google Ngram Viewer"]. Google.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern definition of fitness describes either a person or machine's ability to perform a specific function or a holistic definition of human adaptability to cope with various situations. This has led to an interrelation of human fitness and attractiveness that has mobilized global fitness and fitness equipment industries. Regarding specific function, fitness is attributed to persons who possess significant [[aerobic exercise|aerobic]] or [[anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]] ability, i.e. endurance or strength. A well-rounded fitness program improves a person in all aspects of fitness compared to practicing only one, such as only cardio/respiratory endurance or only weight training.

A comprehensive fitness program tailored to an individual typically focuses on one or more specific skills,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skill-related physical fitness essential for sports success|url=http://www.tradoc.army.mil/pao/Web_specials/H_and_PWB/013204.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617084150/http://www.tradoc.army.mil/pao/Web_specials/H_and_PWB/013204.htm|archive-date=June 2011|work=tradoc.army.mil|date=19 January 2004| last = Colfer | first = George R. | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on age-&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nied RJ, Franklin B | title = Promoting and prescribing exercise for the elderly | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 65 | issue = 3 | pages = 419–26 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 11858624 | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2002/0201/p419.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; or health-related needs such as bone health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Bone/Bone_Health/Exercise/default.asp "Exercise for Your Bone Health"]. nih.gov.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many sources&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/4177.0 | title = Participation in Sport and Physical Recreation, Australia, | date = 18 February 2015    | publisher = Australian Bureau of Statistics }}&lt;/ref&gt; also cite [[mental health|mental]], [[social health|social]] and [[emotional health]] as an important part of overall fitness. This is often presented in textbooks as a [[triangle]] made up of three points, which represent physical, emotional, and mental fitness. Physical fitness can also prevent or treat many chronic health conditions brought on by unhealthy [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] or aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141111095756/http://aspe.hhs.gov/health/reports/physicalactivity/ | title = Physical Activity Fundamental To Preventing Disease | publisher = U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | date = 20 June 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Working out can also help some people sleep better and possibly alleviate some mood disorders in certain individuals.&lt;ref name=how&gt;{{cite web | title=How much physical activity do adults need?  | work=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | url=https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/guidelines/adults.html | date=1 December 2011  | access-date=29 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developing research has demonstrated that many of the benefits of exercise are mediated through the role of skeletal muscle as an endocrine organ. That is, contracting muscles release multiple substances known as [[myokine]]s, which promote the growth of new tissue, tissue repair, and various anti-inflammatory functions, which in turn reduce the risk of developing various inflammatory diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pedersen BK, Febbraio MA | title = Muscles, exercise, and obesity: skeletal muscle as a secretory organ | journal = Nature Reviews.

== Activity guidelines ==
The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans was created by the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. This publication suggests that all adults should avoid inactivity to promote good health mentally and physically. For substantial health benefits, adults should participate in at least 150 minutes  a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. Aerobic activity should be performed in episodes of at least 10 minutes, and preferably, it should be spread throughout the week.

For additional and more extensive health benefits, adults should increase their aerobic physical activity to 300 minutes (5 hours) a week of moderate-intensity, or 150 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity. Additional health benefits are gained by engaging in physical activity beyond this amount. Adults should also do muscle-strengthening activities that are moderate or high intensity and involve all major muscle groups on 2 or more days a week, as these activities provide additional health benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://health.gov/paguidelines/pdf/paguide.pdf/ | title = Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans | publisher = Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion | date = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aerobic exercise ===
{{Main|Aerobic exercise}}
[[Cardiorespiratory fitness]] can be measured using [[VO2 max]], a measure of the amount of oxygen the body can uptake and utilize.&lt;ref name="r27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23025219"&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Chakravertty B, Parkavi K, Coumary SA, Felix AJ | title = Antepartum cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) quantification by estimation of maximal oxygen consumption (Vo2 max) in pregnant South Indian women | journal = Journal of the Indian Medical Association | volume = 110 | issue = 4 | pages = 214–7 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 23025219 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aerobic exercise, which improves cardiorespiratory fitness, involves movement that increases the heart rate to improve the body's oxygen consumption. This form of exercise is an important part of all training regiments ranging from professional athletes to the everyday person. Also, it helps increase stamina.

* Elliptical training – This is a stationary exercise machine used to perform [[walking]], or [[running]] without causing excessive stress on the joints. This form of exercise is perfect for people with achy hips, knees, and ankles.
*[[Walking]] – Moving at a fairly regular pace for a short, medium or long distance.
*[[Treadmill]] training – Many treadmills have programs set up that offer numerous different workout plans. One effective cardiovascular activity would be to switch between running and walking. Typically warm up first by walking and then switch off between walking for three minutes and running for three minutes.
*[[Human swimming|Swimming]] – Using the arms and legs to keep oneself afloat and moving either forwards or backward. This is a good full body exercise for those who are looking to strengthen their core while improving cardiovascular endurance.
*[[Cycling]] – Riding a bicycle typically involves longer distances than walking or jogging. This is another low-stress exercise on the joints and is great for improving leg strength.&lt;ref name="r29" /&gt;
* Sprinting - Running short distances as fast as possible

=== Anaerobic exercise ===
{{Main|Anaerobic exercise}}

== Training ==
{{anchor|PT}}

Specific or task-oriented fitness is a person's ability to perform in a specific activity with a reasonable efficiency: for example, sports or [[military service]]. Specific training prepares athletes to perform well in their sport.

Examples are:
* [[100 m sprint]]: in a sprint, the athlete must be trained to work anaerobically throughout the race, an example of how to do this would be interval training.
* [[Century ride|Century Ride]]: cyclists must be prepared aerobically for a bike ride of 100 miles or more.
* [[Middle distance running]]: athletes require both speed and endurance to gain benefit out of this training. The hard-working muscles are at their peak for a longer period of time as they are being used at that level for the longer period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.brianmac.co.uk/middist/index.htm|title = Middle Distance Running|year = 2001|website = Middle Distance Running|publisher = BrianMac Sports Coach| authors = Mackenzie B }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Marathon]]: in this case, the athlete must be trained to work aerobically and their endurance must be built-up to a maximum.
* Many firefighters and police officers undergo regular [[Physical fitness test|fitness testing]] to determine if they are capable of the physically demanding tasks required of the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140630055700/http://sccfd.org/physical_fitness.html#appendix2 | title = Training: Physical Fitness Program | work = sccfd.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Members of [[armed forces]] are often required to pass a formal fitness test. For example, soldiers of the [[US Army]] must be able to pass the [[Army Physical Fitness Test]] (APFT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enlist : Army Physical Fitness Test | url = http://www.army.com/enlist/APFT.html |work=Army.com |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106111832/http://www.army.com/enlist/APFT.html |archive-date=6 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hill sprints: requires a level of fitness to begin with; the exercise is particularly good for the leg muscles. The army often trains to do mountain climbing and races.
* [[Plyometrics|Plyometric]] and [[isometric exercise]]s: An excellent way to build strength and increase muscular endurance.
* [[Beach running|Sand running]] creates less strain on leg muscles than running on grass or concrete. This is because sand collapses beneath the foot, softening the landing. Sand training is an effective way to lose weight and become fit, as more effort is needed (one and a half times more) to run on the soft sand than on a hard surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Running on the Beach: The Benefits &amp; Dangers | work = Runners Feed|url = http://runnersfeed.com/running-on-the-beach-the-benefits-dangers/ |access-date = 2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Aquajogging]] is a form of exercise that decreases strain on joints and bones. The water supplies minimal impact{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=February 2016}} to muscles and bones, which is good for those recovering from injury. Furthermore, the resistance of the water as one jogs through it provides an enhanced effect of exercise (the deeper you are the greater the force needed to pull your leg through).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.livestrong.com/article/444522-aqua-jogging-for-runners/ | title = Aqua Jogging for Runners|date = 28 January 2015|website = livestrong.com|last = Harriman|first = Dan | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For physical fitness activity to benefit an individual, the exertion triggers a response called a stimulus. Exercise with the correct amount of intensity, duration, and frequency can produce a significant amount of improvement. The person may overall feel better, but the physical effects on the human body take weeks or months to notice and possibly years for full development. For training purposes, exercise must provide a stress or demand on either a function or tissue. To continue improvements, this demand must eventually increase little over an extended period of time. This sort of exercise training has three basic principles: overload, specificity, and progression.  These principles are related to health but also enhancement of physical working capacity.&lt;ref name= Blair&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Blair SN | title = 1993 C.H.

=== High intensity interval training ===
{{Main|High-intensity interval training}}
High intensity interval training (HIIT) consists of repeated, short bursts of exercise, completed at a high level of intensity. These sets of intense activity are followed by a predetermined time of rest or low intensity activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wisløff U, Ellingsen Ø, Kemi OJ|date=July 2009|title=High-intensity interval training to maximize cardiac benefits of exercise training?|journal=Exercise and Sport Sciences Reviews|volume=37|issue=3|pages=139–46|doi=10.1097/JES.0b013e3181aa65fc|pmid=19550205}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have shown that exercising at a higher intensity has increased cardiac benefits for humans, compared to when exercising at a low or moderate level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gillen JB, Gibala MJ|date=March 2014|title=Is high-intensity interval training a time-efficient exercise strategy to improve health and fitness?|journal=Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism = Physiologie Appliquee, Nutrition et Metabolisme|volume=39|issue=3|pages=409–12|doi=10.1139/apnm-2013-0187|pmid=24552392}}&lt;/ref&gt; When your workout consists of an HIIT session, your body has to work harder to replace the oxygen it lost. Research into the benefits of HIIT have revealed that it can be very successful for reducing fat, especially around the abdominal region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.minervamedica.it/en/journals/sports-med-physical-fitness/article.php?cod=R40Y2016N04A0483|title=Eight weeks of a combination of high intensity interval training and conventional training reduce visceral adiposity and improve physical fitness: a group-based intervention|last=|first=|date=April 2016|website=minervamedica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, when compared to continuous moderate exercise, HIIT proves to burn more calories and increase the amount of fat burned post- HIIT session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Shiraev T, Barclay G|date=December 2012|title=Evidence based exercise - clinical benefits of high intensity interval training|journal=Australian Family Physician|volume=41|issue=12|pages=960–2|pmid=23210120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of time is one of the main reasons stated for not exercising; HIIT is a great alternative for those people because the duration of an HIIT session can be as short as 10 minutes, making it much quicker than conventional workouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Whitehurst M|year=2012|title=High-intensity interval training: An alternative for older adults|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/769333|journal=American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine|volume=6|issue=5|pages=382–386|doi=10.1177/1559827612450262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
{{Main|Exercise physiology}}

=== Controlling blood pressure ===
Physical fitness has proven to result in positive effects on the body's blood pressure because staying active and exercising regularly builds up a stronger heart. The heart is the main organ in charge of [[systolic|systolic blood pressure]] and [[diastolic blood pressure]]. Engaging in a physical activity raises blood pressure. Once the subject stops the activity, the blood pressure returns to normal. The more physical activity that one engages in, the easier this process becomes, resulting in a more ‘fit’ individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/high-blood-pressure/art-20045206 | title = Exercise: A Drug-free Approach to Lowering High Blood Pressure | work = mayoclinic.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through regular physical fitness, the heart does not have to work as hard to create a rise in blood pressure, which lowers the force on the arteries, and lowers the overall blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bloodpressureuk.org/BloodPressureandyou/Yourlifestyle/Beingactive | title = Blood Pressure : Exercise &amp; Activity Lower Blood Pressure | work = bloodpressureuk.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cancer prevention ===
Centers for disease control and prevention provide lifestyle guidelines of maintaining a balanced diet and engaging in physical activity to reduce the risk of disease. The WCRF/ [[American Institute for Cancer Research]]  (AICR) published a list of recommendations that reflect the evidence they have found through consistency in fitness and dietary factors that directly relate to cancer prevention.

The WCRF/AICR recommendations include the following: 
* Be as lean as possible without becoming underweight.
* Each week, adults should engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity physical activity.
* Children should engage in at least one hour of moderate or vigorous physical activity each week.
* Be physically active for at least thirty minutes every day.
* Avoid [[sugar]], and limit the consumption of energy packed foods.
* Balance one's diet with a variety of vegetables, grains, fruits, legumes, etc.
* Limit [[sodium]] intake, the consumption of red meats and the consumption of processed meats.
* Limit alcoholic drinks to two for men and one for women a day.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Alberts, David S. and Hess, Lisa M. (2005). ''Fundamentals of Cancer Prevention''. Berlin: Springer, {{ISBN|364238983X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These recommendations are also widely supported by the [[American Cancer Society]].  The guidelines have been evaluated and individuals that have higher guideline adherence scores substantially reduce cancer risk as well as help towards control with a multitude of chronic health problems. Regular physical activity is a factor that helps reduce an individual’s blood pressure and improves cholesterol levels, two key components that correlate with heart disease and [[Type 2 Diabetes]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. [https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/sgr/pdf/sgrfull.pdf ''Physical Activity and Health: A Report of the Surgeon General'']. Atlanta, GA: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The American Cancer Society encourages the public to "adopt a physically active lifestyle" by meeting the criteria in a variety of physical activities such as hiking, swimming, circuit training, resistance training, lifting, etc. It is understood that cancer is not a disease that can be cured by physical fitness alone, however, because it is a multifactorial disease, physical fitness is a controllable prevention. The large associations tied with being physically fit and reduced cancer risk are enough to provide a strategy to reduce cancer risk.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
The American Cancer Society asserts different levels of activity ranging from moderate to vigorous to clarify the recommended time spent on a physical activity. These classifications of physical activity consider the intentional exercise and basic activities are done on a daily basis and give the public a greater understanding of what fitness levels suffice as future disease prevention.

=== Inflammation ===
Studies have shown an association between increased physical activity and reduced inflammation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Colbert LH, Visser M, Simonsick EM, Tracy RP, Newman AB, Kritchevsky SB, Pahor M, Taaffe DR, Brach J, Rubin S, Harris TB | title = Physical activity, exercise, and inflammatory markers in older adults: findings from the Health, Aging and Body Composition Study | journal = Journal of the American Geriatrics Society | volume = 52 | issue = 7 | pages = 1098–104 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15209647 | doi = 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2004.52307.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; It produces both a short-term inflammatory response and a long-term anti-inflammatory effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kasapis C, Thompson PD | title = The effects of physical activity on serum C-reactive protein and inflammatory markers: a systematic review | journal = Journal of the American College of Cardiology | volume = 45 | issue = 10 | pages = 1563–9 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15893167 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2004.12.077 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical activity reduces inflammation in conjunction with or independent of changes in body weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Campbell KL, McTiernan A | title = Exercise and biomarkers for cancer prevention studies | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 137 | issue = 1 Suppl | pages = 161S–169S | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17182820 | doi = 10.1093/jn/137.1.161S }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the mechanisms linking physical activity to inflammation are unknown.

=== Immune system ===
Physical activity boosts the [[immune system]]. This is dependent on the concentration of endogenous factors (such as sex hormones, metabolic hormones and growth hormones), body temperature, blood flow, hydration status and body position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nieman DC | title = Exercise immunology: practical applications | journal = International Journal of Sports Medicine | volume = 18 Suppl 1 | pages = S91–100 | date = March 1997 | pmid = 9129268 | doi = 10.1055/s-2007-972705 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical activity has shown to increase the levels of natural killer (NK) cells, NK T cells, macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils, complements, cytokines, antibodies and T cytotoxic cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fairey AS, Courneya KS, Field CJ, Mackey JR | title = Physical exercise and immune system function in cancer survivors: a comprehensive review and future directions | journal = Cancer | volume = 94 | issue = 2 | pages = 539–51 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11900239 | doi = 10.1002/cncr.10244 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kruijsen-Jaarsma M, Révész D, Bierings MB, Buffart LM, Takken T | title = Effects of exercise on immune function in patients with cancer: a systematic review | journal = Exercise Immunology Review | volume = 19 | pages = 120–43 | date = 2013-01-01 | pmid = 23977724 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the mechanism linking physical activity to immune system is not fully understood.

=== Weight control ===
Achieving resilience through physical fitness promotes a vast and complex range of health-related benefits. Individuals who keep up physical fitness levels generally regulate their distribution of body fat and stay away from obesity. Abdominal fat, specifically visceral fat, is most directly affected by engaging in aerobic exercise. Strength training has been known to increase the amount of muscle in the body, however, it can also reduce body fat.&lt;ref name=r28/&gt; Sex steroid hormones, insulin, and an appropriate immune response are factors that mediate metabolism in relation to the abdominal fat. Therefore, physical fitness provides weight control through regulation of these bodily functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Westerlind KC | title = Physical activity and cancer prevention--mechanisms | journal = Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise | volume = 35 | issue = 11 | pages = 1834–40 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14600547 | doi = 10.1249/01.MSS.0000093619.37805.B7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Menopause and physical fitness ===
[[Menopause]] is often said to have occurred when a woman has had no vaginal bleeding for over a year since her last [[menstrual cycle]]. There are a number of symptoms connected to menopause, most of which can affect the quality of life of a woman involved in this stage of her life. One way to reduce the severity of the symptoms is to exercise and keep a healthy level of fitness.  Prior to and during menopause, as the female body changes, there can be physical, physiological or internal changes to the body. These changes can be reduced or even prevented with regular exercise. These changes include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Sternfeld B, Dugan S | title = Physical activity and health during the menopausal transition | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America | volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 537–66 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21961719 | pmc = 3270074 | doi = 10.1016/j.ogc.2011.05.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Preventing weight gain: around menopause women tend to experience a reduction in muscle mass and an increase in fat levels. Increasing the amount of physical exercise undertaken can help to prevent these changes.
* Reducing the risk of [[breast cancer]]: weight loss from regular exercise may offer protection from breast cancer.
* Strengthening bones: physical activity can slow the bone loss associated with menopause, reducing the chance of bone fractures and osteoporosis.
* Reducing the risk of disease: excess weight can increase the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes, and regular physical activity can counter these effects.
* Boosting mood: being involved in regular activities it can improve psychological health, an effect that can be seen at any age and not just during or after [[menopause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/womens-health/in-depth/fitness-tips-for-menopause/art-20044602 | title = Fitness Tips for Menopause: Why fitness counts | date = June 2013 | access-date = 11 April 2015 | publisher = Mayo Clinic | last = Pruthi | first = Sandhya | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Melbourne Women's Midlife Health Project provided evidence that showed over an eight-year time period 438 were followed. Even though the physical activity was not associated with VMS in this cohort at the beginning. Women who reported they were physically active every day at the beginning were 49% less likely to have reported bothersome hot flushes. This is in contrast to women whose level of activity decreased and were more likely to experience bothersome hot flushes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.acsm.org/access-public-information/articles/2012/01/12/exercise-recommendations-for-menopause-aged-women|title = Exercise Recommendations for Menopause-Aged Women|date = January 12, 2012|access-date = 12 April 2015|website = American College of Sports Medicine|publisher = American College of Sports Medicine|last = Eschbach|first = Chris | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mental health ===
{{Main|Neurobiological effects of physical exercise}}
Studies have shown that physical activity can improve mental health and well-being.&lt;ref name="Callaghan_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Callaghan P | title = Exercise: a neglected intervention in mental health care? | journal = Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 476–83 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15255923 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2850.2004.00751.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/a-to-z/p/physical-activity-and-mental-health | title=Physical activity and mental health| date=2015-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;This improvement is due to an increase in blood flow to the brain and the release of hormones. Being physically fit and working out on a consistent and constant basis can positively impact one's mental health and bring about several other benefits, such as the following.&lt;ref name="Sharma_2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharma A, Madaan V, Petty FD | title = Exercise for mental health | journal = Primary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 106 | date = 2006 | pmid = 16862239 | pmc = 1470658 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Physical activity has been linked to the alleviation of depression and anxiety symptoms.&lt;ref name="Callaghan_2004" /&gt;
* In patients suffering from schizophrenia, physical fitness has been shown to improve their quality of life and decrease the effects of schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Vancampfort D, Probst M, Scheewe T, De Herdt A, Sweers K, Knapen J, van Winkel R, De Hert M | title = Relationships between physical fitness, physical activity, smoking and metabolic and mental health parameters in people with schizophrenia | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 207 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 25–32 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23051886 | doi = 10.1016/j.psychres.2012.09.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Being fit can improve one's self-esteem.
* Working out can improve one's mental alertness and it can reduce fatigue.
* Studies have shown a reduction in stress levels.
* Increased opportunity for social interaction, allowing for improved social skills&lt;ref name="Sharma_2006" /&gt;

To achieve some of these benefits, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests at least 30-60 minutes of exercise 3-5 times a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/pa-health/index.htm|title=Benefits of Physical Activity|date=2018-03-06|work=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pre-ejaculate_2014-06-06_07-20.jpg|thumbnail|Pre-ejaculate on the glans of a circumcised penis]] 
'''Pre-ejaculate''' (also known as '''pre-ejaculatory fluid''', '''pre-seminal fluid''' or '''Cowper's fluid''', and colloquially as ''pre-cum'') is a clear, colorless, [[viscosity|viscous]] fluid that is emitted from the [[urethra]] of the [[human penis|penis]] during [[sexual arousal]]. It is similar in composition to [[semen]] but has distinct chemical differences. The presence of [[sperm]] in the fluid is variable from low to absent. Pre-ejaculate functions as a [[lubricant]] and an [[acid]] neutralizer.

==Origin and composition==
The fluid is discharged from the urethra of the penis during [[sexual arousal|arousal]], [[masturbation]], [[foreplay]] or at an early stage during [[sexual intercourse]], some time before the individual fully reaches [[orgasm]] and semen is ejaculated. It is primarily produced by the [[bulbourethral gland]]s (Cowper's glands), with the glands of Littre (the [[Urethra#Histology|mucus-secreting urethral glands]]) also contributing.&lt;ref name=Chudnovskycite&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Chudnovsky, A. | author2 = Niederberger, C.S. | year = 2007 | title = Copious Pre-Ejaculation: Small Glands--Major Headaches | journal = Journal of Andrology | pmid = 17251594 | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 374–5 | doi = 10.2164/jandrol.107.002576}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chughtai"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Chughtai B, Sawas A, O'Malley RL, Naik RR, Ali Khan S, Pentyala S |title=A neglected gland: a review of Cowper's gland |journal=Int.

Pre-ejaculate contains some chemicals associated with semen, such as [[acid phosphatase]]. However, other semen markers, such as [[gamma-glutamyltransferase]], are completely absent from pre-ejaculate fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Gohara WF |title=Rate of decrease of glutamyltransferase and acid phosphatase activities in the human vagina after coitus |journal=Clin.

==Function and risks==

Pre-ejaculate neutralizes residual acidity in the urethra caused by [[urine]], creating a more favorable environment for the passage of sperm.&lt;ref name=chughtai/&gt; The [[vagina]] is normally acidic, so the deposit of pre-ejaculate before the emission of semen may change the vaginal environment to promote sperm survival.&lt;ref name=Chudnovskycite /&gt; Pre-ejaculate also acts as a lubricant during [[sexual activity]],&lt;ref name=Chudnovskycite /&gt; and plays a role in semen [[coagulation]].&lt;ref name=Chudnovskycite /&gt;

Low levels or no sperm exists in pre-ejaculate, although studies examined small samples of men.&lt;ref name="zukerman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HIV"/&gt; Two contrary studies found mixed evidence, including individual cases of a high sperm concentration.&lt;ref name="Killick"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Killick SR, Leary C, Trussell J, Guthrie KA |doi=10.3109/14647273.2010.520798|year=2011|title=Sperm content of pre-ejaculatory fluid|journal=Human Fertility|volume=14|issue=1|pages=48–52|pmid=21155689|pmc=3564677}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kovavisarach|first1=E.|last2=Lorthanawanich|first2=S.|last3=Muangsamran|first3=P.|title=Presence of Sperm in Pre-Ejaculatory Fluid of Healthy Males|journal=J Med Assoc Thai|date=2016|volume=99 Suppl 2|pages=S38–41|pmid=27266214|issn=0125-2208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular belief&amp;nbsp;– dating to a 1966 Masters and Johnson study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Masters|first=W.H.|title=Johnson, V.E.|year=1966|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=Boston, MA|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– stated that pre-ejaculate may contain sperm that can cause pregnancy, which is a common basis of argument against the use of [[coitus interruptus]] (withdrawal) as a contraceptive method. However, pre-ejaculate is ineffectual at causing pregnancy.&lt;ref name=zukerman/&gt;&lt;ref name="HIV"&gt;{{Cite journal| title=Researchers find no sperm in pre-ejaculate fluid | journal=Contraceptive Technology Update |date=October 1993 | volume=14 | issue=10 | pmid=12286905 | pages=154–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have demonstrated the presence of [[HIV]] in most pre-ejaculate samples from infected men.&lt;ref name=HIV/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/0140-6736(92)92659-4|authors=Pudney, J., Oneta, M., Mayer, K., Seage, G., Anderson, D.|title=Pre-ejaculatory fluid as potential vector for sexual transmission of HIV-1|journal=Lancet|year=1992|volume=340|page=1470|pmid=1360584|issue=8833}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/0140-6736(92)92658-3|authors=Ilaria, G., Jacobs, J.L., Polsky, B.|title=Detection of HIV-1 DNA sequences in pre-ejaculatory fluid|journal=Lancet|year=1992|volume=340|issue=8833|page=1469|pmid=1360583|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overproduction==
In rare cases, an individual may produce an excessive amount of pre-ejaculate fluid that can be a cause of embarrassment or irritation. A few case reports have indicated satisfactory results when such individuals are treated with a [[5-alpha-reductase inhibitor]], such as [[finasteride]].&lt;ref name=Chudnovskycite /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5463">[[File:Eucharius Rösslin - Der schwangeren Frauen und Hebammen Rosengarten.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Presentation of twins in ''Der Rosengarten'' ("The Rose Garden"), a standard medical text for [[midwive]]s published in 1513.]]

In [[obstetrics]], the '''presentation''' of a [[fetus]] about to be [[Childbirth|born]] refers to which [[Human anatomy|anatomical part]] of the fetus is leading, that is, is closest to the [[human pelvis|pelvic]] inlet of the birth canal. According to the leading part, this is identified as a [[cephalic presentation|cephalic]], [[breech presentation|breech]], or [[shoulder presentation|shoulder]] presentation. A '''malpresentation''' is any presentation other than a vertex presentation (with the top of the head first).

==Classification==
Thus the various presentations are:
* [[cephalic presentation]] (head first):
** vertex ([[crown (anatomy)|crown]]) &amp;mdash; the most common and associated with the fewest complications
** [[sinciput]] (forehead)
** brow (eyebrows)
** face
** chin
* [[breech presentation]]&lt;ref name=kish&gt;{{cite book |last= Kish|first= Karen|author2=Joseph V. Collea|editor= Alan H. DeCherney|others= Lauren Nathan|title= Current Obstetric &amp; Gynecologic Diagnosis &amp; Treatment|edition= Ninth|year= 2003|publisher= Lange/McGraw-Hill|isbn= 0-07-118207-1|pages= 369|chapter= Malpresentation &amp; Cord Prolapse (Chapter 21)}}&lt;/ref&gt; (buttocks or feet first):
** complete breech
** footling breech
** frank breech
* [[shoulder presentation]]:
**arm
**shoulder
**trunk
*compound presentation - when any other part presents along with the fetal head

==Related obstetrical terms==

===Attitude===
* Definition: Relationship of fetal head to spine: 
**flexed, (this is the normal situation)
**neutral (“military”), 
**extended.
**hyperextended

===Position===
* Relationship of presenting part to maternal pelvis based on presentation. The fetus enters the pelvis in the occipito-transverse plane (left or right), descent, and flexion and then rotates 90 degrees to the occipitoanterior (most commonly).
** [[Cephalic presentation]]
*** Vertex presentation with longitudinal lie:&lt;ref name=kish/&gt;
****Left occipitoanterior (LOA)&amp;mdash;the [[occiput]] is close to the vagina (hence known as vertex presentation), facing anteriorly (forward with mother standing) and toward the left. This is the most common position and lie.
****Right occipitoanterior (ROA)&amp;mdash;the occiput faces anteriorly and toward the right. Less common than LOA, but not associated with labor complications.
****Left occipitoposterior (LOP)&amp;mdash;the occiput faces posteriorly (behind) and toward the left.
****Right occipitoposterior (ROP)&amp;mdash;the occiput faces posteriorly and toward the right.
****Occipitoanterior &amp;mdash;the occiput faces anteriorly (absolutely straight without any turning to any of the sides)
****Occipitoposterior &amp;mdash;the occiput faces posteriorly (absolutely straight without any turning to any of the sides)
*** Face presentation
****Mentum anterior - the fetal chin is in the direction of the maternal pubic symphysis.
****Mentum posterior - the fetal chin is in the direction of the maternal sacrum. This presentation is not compatible with vaginal delivery
**[[Breech presentation]] with longitudinal lie:&lt;ref name=kish/&gt;  
***Left [[sacrum]] anterior (LSA)&amp;mdash;the buttocks, as against the occiput of the vertex presentation, lie close to the vagina (hence known as breech presentation), which lie anteriorly and toward the left.
***Right sacrum anterior (RSA)&amp;mdash;the buttocks face anteriorly and toward the right.
***Left sacrum posterior (LSP)&amp;mdash;the buttocks face posteriorly and toward the left.
***Right sacrum posterior (RSP)&amp;mdash;the buttocks face posteriorly and toward the right.
***Sacrum anterior(SA)&amp;mdash;the buttocks face anteriorly.
***Sacrum posterior (SP)&amp;mdash;the buttocks face posteriorly.
** [[Shoulder presentation]]s with transverse lie are classified into four types, based on the location of the [[scapula]] (shoulder blade). This presentation needs to be delivered by [[cesarean section]].
***Left scapula-anterior (LSA)
***Right scapula-anterior (RSA)
***Left scapula-posterior (LSP)
***Right scapula-posterior (RSP)

===Lie===
* Definition: Relationship between the longitudinal axis of fetus and mother: 
**longitudinal (resulting in either cephalic or breech presentation)
**oskie (cephalic presentation, fetus legs straight along frontal axis of mother)
**oblique (unstable, will eventually become either transverse or longitudinal) 
**transverse (resulting in shoulder presentation)
***back up
***back down (indication for vertical uterine incision during cesarean delivery)

==Theories==
Chachoua's treatments depend on theories he has named, including "Induced Remission Therapy" and "The Nemesis Theory", ''i.e.'' "for every disease there is an anti-disease organism capable of destroying it and restoring health".&lt;ref name=barrett/&gt;

For treatment of HIV, Chachoua vaccinates patients with [[Caprine arthritis encephalitis virus]], which is known to cross-react [[immunology|immunologically]] with HIV.&lt;ref name="pmid14602501"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tesoro-Cruz E |author2=Hernández-González R |author3=Kretschmer-Schmid R |author4=Aguilar-Setién A |title=Cross-reactivity between caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus and type 1 human immunodeficiency virus |journal=Arch.

==Lawsuit==
In 1997, Chachoua filed a lawsuit in the [[Los Angeles]] [[US District Court]] against [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]]. Chachoua stated that he had shared his [[cell culture]]s with them, but after the results had been published, the medical center claimed both the material and the credit. The only issues that made it to trial were Chachoa's claims of breach of contract and of a conspiracy to defame him.&lt;ref name=hall&gt;{{Cite web|title = Charlie Sheen’s HIV Goat Milk Doctor|url = http://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/charlie-sheens-hiv-goat-milk-doctor/|website = Skeptic.com|author=Hall, Harriet|access-date = 2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Chachoua prevailed on his breach of contract claim, the trial court reduced the verdict to $11,250, the amount Chachoua had paid for the testing of his samples, and gave Chachoua the choice of accepting that amount or a new trial on the breach of contract claim.&lt;ref name=hall/&gt; Chachoua requested a new trial.&lt;ref name=hall/&gt; The lawsuit was dismissed by Judge [[Margaret M. Morrow]] on November 13, 2001, due to Chachoua's  “history of repeatedly disobeying court orders and resort to other dilatory tactics” and his “pattern of misconduct [that] spanned the tenures of several different attorneys.”&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-mied-2_00-cv-70615/pdf/USCOURTS-mied-2_00-cv-70615-0.pdf Opinion and order granting plaintiff's motion for default judgment as to complaint and denying as moot plaintiff's motion to dismiss counterclaim]", [[US Government Printing Office]]&lt;/ref&gt; Chachoua was later successfully sued by one of his lawyers for unpaid legal fees and costs, losing a counterclaim in which he accused her of legal malpractice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hansen v.

==Charlie Sheen==
In an episode of ''[[The Dr. Oz Show]]'' taped in late 2015 and aired January 12, 2016, [[Charlie Sheen]] said he had been receiving [[alternative medicine|alternative]] treatment for HIV in [[Mexico]] from Chachoua, stating "I'm [sic] been off my meds for about a week now"; according to his manager, however, after the episode was taped he resumed taking his medications.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.people.com/article/charlie-sheen-off-hiv-meds Charlie Sheen Temporarily Went Off HIV Medications to Seek Alternative Treatment in Mexico: 'So What?

In the course of his treatment of Sheen, Chachoua claims that he injected himself with Sheen's blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alexander|first1=Harriet|title=Charlie Sheen's HIV doctor injected himself with Sheen's blood|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/12098833/Charlie-Sheens-HIV-doctor-injected-himself-with-Sheens-blood.html|accessdate=January 30, 2016|publisher=The Telegraph|date=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheen has stated that Chachoua may have switched the needle before injecting himself with blood.&lt;ref name=juzwiak2/&gt; Chachoua has claimed that his treatments rendered Sheen HIV negative, despite the fact that Sheen continues to be HIV positive.&lt;ref name=juzwiak1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYiq0-M1MDU|title=Bill Maher Full Interview Sam Chachoua on Charlie Sheens &amp; The Cure for HIV/AIDS|date=29 January 2016|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheen has claimed that Chachoua unlawfully administered treatments in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parry|first1=Hannah|title=It was illegal for you to treat me': Charlie Sheen blasts doctor who claimed to have cured him of HIV with goats milk and told him to go off anti-viral meds|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3427532/It-illegal-treat-Charlie-Sheen-blasts-doctor-claimed-cured-HIV-goats-milk-told-anti-viral-meds.html|accessdate=February 2, 2016|agency=Daily Mail|date=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he is not licensed to practice medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kramer|first1=Peter|title=Charlie Sheen quit HIV meds for "alternative" treatment|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/charlie-sheen-quit-hiv-meds-for-alternative-treatment/|accessdate=February 2, 2016|agency=CBS News|date=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stretching-muscles-579122 640.jpg|thumb|310x310px|Static stretching]]
'''Stretching''' is a form of [[physical exercise]] in which a specific [[skeletal muscle|muscle]] or [[tendon]] (or muscle group) is deliberately flexed or stretched in order to improve the muscle's felt [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] and achieve comfortable [[muscle tone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Weerapong, Pornratshanee |author2=Hume, Patria A. |author3=Kolt, Gregory S. |title=Stretching: Mechanisms and Benefits for Sports Performance and Injury Prevention|journal= Physical Therapy Reviews |volume=9|issue=4|year=2004|pages= 189–206|doi=10.1179/108331904225007078}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is a feeling of increased muscle control, flexibility, and range of motion. Stretching is also used [[Physical therapy|therapeutically]] to alleviate [[cramps]].&lt;ref&gt;Dagenais, Marc (December 2011) [http://www.softballperformance.com/softball-training-tips-do-you-know-how-to-stretch/ Softball Training Tips – Do you know how to stretch?] softballperformance.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In its most basic form, stretching is a natural and [[instinctive]] activity; it is performed by [[human]]s and many other [[animal]]s. It can be accompanied by [[yawn]]ing. Stretching often occurs instinctively after waking from sleep, after long periods of inactivity, or after exiting confined spaces and areas.

Increasing flexibility through stretching is one of the basic tenets of physical fitness. It is common for athletes to stretch before (for [[warming up]]) and after exercise in an attempt to reduce risk of injury and increase performance.&lt;ref name=prevention/&gt;{{rp|42}}

Stretching can be dangerous when performed incorrectly. There are many techniques for stretching in general, but depending on which muscle group is being stretched, some techniques may be ineffective or detrimental, even to the point of causing [[Hypermobility (joints)|hypermobility]], instability, or permanent damage to the [[tendons]], [[ligaments]], and [[muscle]] fiber.&lt;ref name="ris"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tsatsouline, Pavel |title=Relax into stretch: instant flexibility through mastering muscle tension|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=buyFfeuFmekC|year=2001|publisher=Dragon Door Publications|isbn=978-0-938045-28-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physiological nature of stretching and theories about the effect of various techniques are therefore subject to heavy inquiry.

Although static stretching (see image on the right for an example) is part of some [[Warming up|warm-up]] routines, a study in 2013 indicated that it weakens muscles. For this reason, an active dynamic warm-up (movement of the muscle groups with lights weights for example) is recommended before exercise in place of static stretching.&lt;ref&gt;[https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/03/reasons-not-to-stretch/ Reasons Not to Stretch] New York Times, 2013-04-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physiology ==
Studies have shed light on the function, in stretching, of a large [[protein]] within the [[myofibrils]] of skeletal muscles named [[titin]].&lt;ref&gt;Molecular origin of the hierarchical elasticity of titin: simulation, experiment and theory. Jen Hsin, Johan Strümpfer, Eric H. Lee, and Klaus Schulten. Annual Review of Biophysics, 40:187-203, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A study performed by Magid and Law demonstrated that the origin of passive muscle tension (which occurs during stretching) is actually within the [[myofibrils]], not extracellularly as had previously been supposed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muscle.ucsd.edu/musintro/contractions.shtml University of California Regents &gt; Muscle Physiology – Types of Contractions]. muscle.ucsd.edu&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to neurological safeguards against injury, it is normally impossible for adults to stretch most muscle groups to their fullest length without training due to the activation of muscle antagonists as the muscle reaches the limit of its normal range of motion.&lt;ref name="ris"/&gt;

[[Image:Surestart.png|thumb|Sure Start logo]]
'''Sure Start''' is a [[UK Government]] area-based initiative, announced in 1998 by the then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Gordon Brown]], applying primarily in England with slightly different versions in [[Wales]], [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esrc.ac.uk/_images/Sure_Start_final_report_tcm8-20116.pdf Sure Start Case Study] for Economic and Social Research Council, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative originated from [[HM Treasury]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Glass N | date = 1999 | title = Sure Start: The Development of an Early Intervention Programme for Young Children in the United Kingdom. | journal = Children &amp; Society | volume = 13 | pages = 257–264 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of "giving children the best possible start in life" through improvement of [[childcare]], early education, health and family support, with an emphasis on outreach and community development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukpolicymatters.thelancet.com/policy-summary-sure-start/|title=Sure Start|date=11 May 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Launched in 1998 by [[Tessa Jowell]], Sure Start had similarities to the much older, and similarly named, [[Head Start Program|Head Start]] programme in the United States and is also comparable to Australia Head Start&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kids.nsw.gov.au/director/resources/publications.cfm?itemID=6493305605B68789513156DEBD879851 A Head Start for Australia: An Early Years Framework] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080728210041/http://www.kids.nsw.gov.au/director/resources/publications.cfm?itemID=6493305605B68789513156DEBD879851 |date=28 July 2008 }} NSW Commission for Children and Young People, 26 February 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and Ontario's Early Years Plan. The initiatives were subsequently bound together to form ''Sure Start Children's Centres'', and responsibility for them was transferred to local government. Tessa Jowell subsequently commented in 2015, "I am very proud of setting up Sure Start, because the first three years of a child's life are absolutely critical in determining the chances they have subsequently."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/26/tessa-jowell-proud-setting-up-sure-start|title=Tessa Jowell: ‘I’m most proud of setting up Sure Start’|last=O'Connor|first=Joanne | name-list-format = vanc |date=26 April 2015|website=The Guardian|access-date=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Evaluation of Sure Start (NESS) project ran from 2001 until 2012. Initial research findings from NESS, published in 2005, suggested the impact of (the then termed) Sure Start Local Programmes (SSLPs) was not as great as had been hoped.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/sep/13/childrensservices.politics Shaky Times for Sure Start] ''The Guardian'', 13 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 2010, NESS could identify a significant impact on some of the outcomes set for Sure Start.&lt;ref name="ness.bbk.ac.uk"&gt;[http://www.ness.bbk.ac.uk/impact/documents/RB067.pdf The Impact of Sure Start Local Programmes on five-year-olds and their families] National Evaluation of Sure Start team, November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Evaluation of Children's Centres in England (ECCE) project ran from 2009 until 2015.  Results concerning the impact of (the subsequently termed) Sure Start Children's Centres (SSCCs) concluded that, "''Children's Centres set up to support parents of young children can improve the mental health of mothers and functioning of families but that these benefits are being eroded by cuts''.".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
{{out of date|date=September 2018}}

===Initial arrangement===
Initial funding was substantial, with £540m allocated for expenditure between 1999 and 2002, £452m of it within England, to set up 250 Sure Start Local Programmes (SSLPs) reaching up to 150,000 children in areas of deprivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roberts H | title = What is Sure Start? | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood | volume = 82 | issue = 6 | pages = 435–7 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10833172 | pmc = 1718349 | doi = 10.1136/adc.82.6.435 | url = https://adc.bmj.com/content/82/6/435 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK Government initially pledged to fund Sure Start for 10 years, but in 2003, Chancellor Gordon Brown announced the Government's long-term plan to transfer Sure Start into the control of local government by 2005, and create a Sure Start Children's Centre in every community.&lt;ref&gt;Moss P (2004) A new era for universal childcare? Childcare and Early Years Services in 2004. Setting the Scene: A Vision of Universal Children's Spaces. London: [[Daycare Trust]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Related to the Government's goal of reducing [[child poverty]], the initial districts for Sure Start development were selected "according to the levels of deprivation within their areas"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/everychildmatters/earlyyears/surestart/aboutsurestart/challenge/1998greenpaper/ The 1998 Green Paper] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20090617083907/http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/everychildmatters/earlyyears/surestart/aboutsurestart/challenge/1998greenpaper/ |date=17 June 2009 }} Department for Children, Schools and Families, 30 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; the focus being particularly on disadvantaged areas but open to all families living in the catchment area. Such catchment areas were selected locally by the projects.

Sure Start was overseen by the [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] and the [[Department for Work and Pensions]]. The programme has been described by [[Tony Blair]] as "one of [[New Labour]]'s greatest achievements".

Each project was allowed to develop in its own way depending on the expressed wishes of parents and the guidance of the various organisations heading up each one. Policy on such matters as choosing volunteers and even the services offered were a local level decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/everychildmatters/earlyyears/localauthorities/earlyyearschildcare/ Early Years and childcare information for LAs] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20090516013718/http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/everychildmatters/earlyyears/localauthorities/earlyyearschildcare/ |date=16 May 2009 }} Department for Children, Schools and Families, 28 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Sure Start local programmes were opened in waves, Round 1 indicates the first wave of programmes starting 1999. Round 6 represents the final wave of Sure Start local programmes mostly starting in 2003.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/everychildmatters/strategy/improvingquality/guidance/guidanceresources/ssguidanceresources/ Guidance resources – Every Child matters] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202080447/http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/everychildmatters/strategy/improvingquality/guidance/guidanceresources/ssguidanceresources/ |date=2 December 2009 }} Department for Children, Schools and Families, 30 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Move from programmes to centres===
[[File:Wetherby Children's Centre (30th August 2015) 002.JPG|thumb|right|A Sure Start centre on the [[Hallfield]] Estate in [[Wetherby]], West Yorkshire.]]

[[Every Child Matters]] proposed a switch from Sure Start Local Programmes (SSLPs) to Sure Start Children's Centres (SSCCs), which would be controlled by local authorities, and would be provided not just in the most disadvantaged areas. In the 2004 Comprehensive Spending Review, Chancellor Gordon Brown announced that the Government would provide funding for 2,500 Children's Centres by 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Daycare Trust 2004: A New Era For Universal Childcare? Leading the Vision Policy Paper No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; This target was later increased to 3,500 children's centres by 2010. Of the 524 original Sure Start local programmes, most are now Sure Start Children's Centres.

Some Sure Start Local Programmes have become registered Charities and Companies Limited by guarantee. Sure Start Hounslow, a programme in West London, became a company limited by guarantee in 2004 and now delivers a range of services, many through Service Level Agreement with the local authority, not all of which focus entirely on children under five. This development has been one of many routes that Sure Start Local Programmes have taken to ensure sustainability during the "tapering" of the original Sure Start Grant.

In 2005, Norman Glass, one of the original architects of Sure Start wrote an article praising the increased government focus on the early years, but criticising cuts in funding per head; the change from child development to childcare and getting mothers into work; and the shift back to local authority control, rather than being run by boards including parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/jan/05/guardiansocietysupplement.childrensservices | work=The Guardian | title=Surely some mistake? | date=5 January 2005 | access-date=24 May 2010 | first=Norman | last=Glass | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children's Centres are expected to provide:
* In centres in the 30% most disadvantaged areas: integrated early learning and childcare (early years provision) for a minimum of 10 hours a day, five days a week, 48 weeks a year; and support for a childminder network
* In centres in the 70% least disadvantaged areas, which do not elect to offer early years provision: drop-in activity sessions for children, such as stay and play sessions
* Family Support, including support and advice on parenting, information about services available in the area and access to specialist, targeted services; and Parental Outreach
* Child and Family Health Services, such as antenatal and postnatal support, information and guidance on breastfeeding, health and nutrition, smoking cessation support, and speech and language therapy and other specialist support
* Links with [[Jobcentre Plus]] to encourage and support parents and carers who wish to consider training and employment
* Quick and easy access to wider services&lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.education.gov.uk/eOrderingDownload/Governance%20guidance.pdf Governance guidance for Sure Start Children’s Centres and extended schools] Department for Education and Skills, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Under the Coalition Government (2010–2015)===
Cuts in general funding from central government to local authorities in England led to fears, in 2011, that up to 250 Sure Start centres would close.&lt;ref name=Closure250&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-12301690 Closure threat to '250 children's centres'] BBC News, 28 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The former Secretary of State for Education, [[Michael Gove]], has admitted that funding for Sure Start has not been protected,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8287090/250-Sure-Start-centres-could-close-within-a-year.html 250 Sure Start centres 'could close within a year'] The Telegraph, 28 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; as most central funding of local authorities will no longer be ring-fenced. The decision would be left to local councils, though Children's Minister [[Sarah Teather]] said there was enough money available to maintain existing children's centres, should they wish.&lt;ref name=Closure250/&gt;

A number of local councils announced cuts to their Sure Start budgets,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-12182994 Many children's centres 'under threat of closure'] BBC News, 14 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and parents and mothers' groups protested against these cuts,&lt;ref name=ParentsThreat/&gt; taking their campaign directly to [[Downing Street]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-12940355 Mothers take Sure Start cuts fight to Downing Street] BBC News, 3 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Many councils retreated. In February 2017, all 44 Sure Start children's centres in [[Oxfordshire]] were closed after [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] appeals against the measure failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-35543021|title=Changes to Oxfordshire children's centre plans dismissed by campaigners|date=10 February 2016|work=''BBC News''|access-date=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-36945353|title=High Court backs Oxfordshire children's centre closures|date=1 August 2016|work=''BBC News''|access-date=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/news/15088183.Under_threat_children_s_centres_handed_more_than___300_000/|title=Under-threat children's centres handed more than £300,000|website=The Oxford Times|access-date=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ministers said they want to refocus the scheme to help the most disadvantaged families.&lt;ref name=ParentsThreat&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-12847919 Parent threatens action over Sure Start closure plan] BBC News, 24 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The government is now allowing parents to choose their own childcare provider, and to get part-funding provided via tax credits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/childcare-tax-credits|title=Help paying for childcare|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than a centrally run service.

=== Under the Conservative Government (2015–2017) ===
In 2017, a Briefing Paper for [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Pariliament]] summarised the changes to Sure Start that had occurred under the 2015–2017 Conservative Government.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7257|title=Sure Start (England) – Parliament UK|website=House of Commons Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although "The Conservative Government did not make any significant operational or legislative changes to Sure Start during the 2015-2017 Parliament", "Arguably the most significant changes related to funding".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Briefing Paper notes that in [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real terms]], spending in 2015/16 was 47% less than in 2010/11 with budgets for 2016/17 showing a further planned reduction in spending.  This Briefing Paper for MPs also reported a reduction of 208 Sure Start Children's Centre sites between 2015 and 2017.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/06/sure-start-children-worked-why-theresa-may-out-to-kill-it |title= Sure Start worked. So why is Theresa May out to kill it? |first=Lucy|last=Rigby| name-list-format = vanc |date=6 February 2017 |work = The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence concerning effectiveness==

A 2007 study by researchers from the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Wales|Wales]] published in the [[British Medical Journal]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/334/7595/678 Parenting intervention in Sure Start services for children at risk of developing conduct disorder: pragmatic randomised controlled trial] ''BMJ'', 23 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; looking at parenting interventions within the Sure Start system in Wales examined 153 parents from socially deprived areas and showed that a course teaching improved parenting skills had great benefits in reducing problem behaviour in young children. Parents were taught to:
* Increase positive child behaviour through praise and incentives
* Improve parent-child interaction: relationship building
* Set clear expectations: limit-setting and non-aversive management strategies for non-compliance
* Apply consistent gentle consequences for problem behaviour

The study recommended that this evidence-based class be expanded from Wales to the rest of the UK, making it available for all parents who need it, stating that the Sure Start programme has not yet produced results as good as these in England.

A lack of effectiveness in England has been suggested by a [[University of Durham]] study which suggested that Sure Start was ineffective at improving results in early schooling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/education/article2337386.ece £3bn scheme to help pre-school children learn ‘has had no effect’] ''The Times'', 28 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dur.ac.uk/research/directory/view/?mode=project&amp;id=11 Sure Start in County Durham] University of Durham, 17 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A national longitudinal evaluation of Sure Start, known as NESS, was set up in 2001. Although early evaluations did not find Sure Start Local Programmes (SSLPs) to have been particularly effective, by 2008 NESS was able to conclude "For the time being, it remains plausible, even if by no means certain, that the differences in findings across the first and second phases of the NESS Impact Study reflect actual changes in the impact of SSLPs resulting from the increasing quality of service provision, greater attention to the hard-to-reach and the move to Children's Centres, as well as the greater exposure to the programme of children and families in the latest phase of the impact evaluation."&lt;ref name=NESS027&gt;[http://www.ness.bbk.ac.uk/impact/documents/42.pdf The Impact of Sure Start Local Programmes on Three Year Olds and Their Families] National Evaluation of Sure Start Research Team, March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, robust research conducted by NESS demonstrated significant effects of SSLPs on eight of 21 outcomes: two positive outcomes for children (lower BMIs and better physical health), four positive outcomes for mothers and families (more stimulating and less chaotic home environments, less harsh discipline, and greater life-satisfaction)&lt;ref name="ness.bbk.ac.uk"/&gt;

A new publicly-funded national longitudinal evaluation of Sure Start, known as ECCE, was set up in 2009.  This study, different in design to NESS, ran for 6 years and by 2015 had, "''identified a number of [[Statistical significance|significant]] [[Effect size|but relatively small positive effects]] in promoting better outcomes for each user group considered (child, mother, and families)''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/485347/DFE-RB495_Evaluation_of_children_s_centres_in_England__the_impact_of_children_s_centres_brief.pdf|title=The impact of children's centres: studying the effects of children's centres in promoting better outcomes for young children and their families|website=UK Department for Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; although no impact was found on household employment status (whether or not one or adults in a household works) or on children's health.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, in 2016 the [[The BMJ|British Medical Journal]] noted that the benefits of Sure Start to children and families were being eroded by austerity cuts&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bmj.com/content/352/bmj.i335|title=Austerity cuts are eroding benefits of Sure Start Children's Centres|website=BMJ, 19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that, "''[[disadvantaged]] families are at greatest risk from [these] austerity cuts''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bmj.com/content/352/bmj.i897|title=Disadvantaged families are at greatest risk from austerity cuts to Children's Centres|website=BMJ 23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the evidence concerning the effectiveness of Sure Start from both the NESS and the ECCE studies was summarised by a Briefing Paper that was written for the (then) Members of the UK [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Syphilis''' is a [[sexually transmitted infection]] caused by the [[bacterium]] ''[[Treponema pallidum]]'' [[subspecies]] ''pallidum''.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Tx&gt;{{cite web|title=Syphilis|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/syphilis.htm|website=CDC|accessdate=3 February 2016|date=June 4, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160221200405/http://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/syphilis.htm|archivedate=21 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The signs and symptoms of syphilis vary depending in which of the four stages it presents (primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary).&lt;ref name=CDC2015Fact/&gt; The primary stage classically presents with a single [[chancre]] (a firm, painless, non-itchy [[skin ulceration]]) but there may be multiple sores.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Fact/&gt; In secondary syphilis, a diffuse [[rash]] occurs, which frequently involves the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Fact/&gt; There may also be sores in the mouth or vagina.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Fact/&gt; In latent syphilis, which can last for years, there are few or no symptoms.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Fact/&gt; In tertiary syphilis, there are [[gumma (pathology)|gummas]] (soft, non-cancerous growths), neurological, or heart symptoms.&lt;ref name=Kent08&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kent ME, Romanelli F |title=Reexamining syphilis: an update on epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and management |journal=Annals of Pharmacotherapy |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=226–36 |date=February 2008 |pmid=18212261 |doi=10.1345/aph.1K086 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syphilis has been known as "[[the great imitator]]" as it may cause symptoms similar to many other diseases.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Fact&gt;{{cite web|title=Syphilis - CDC Fact Sheet (Detailed)|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-syphilis-detailed.htm|website=CDC|accessdate=3 February 2016|date=November 2, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206003059/http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-syphilis-detailed.htm|archivedate=6 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kent08/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Syphilis is most commonly spread through [[human sexual activity|sexual activity]].&lt;ref name=CDC2015Fact/&gt; It may also be [[Vertical transmission|transmitted from mother to baby]] during pregnancy or at birth, resulting in [[congenital syphilis]].&lt;ref name=CDC2015Fact/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wood09&gt;{{cite journal |author=Woods CR|title=Congenital syphilis-persisting pestilence|journal=Pediatr.

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
The risk of sexual transmission of syphilis can be reduced by using a [[latex condom]].&lt;ref name=CDC2015Fact/&gt; Syphilis can be effectively treated with [[antibiotics]].&lt;ref name=CDC2015Tx/&gt; The preferred antibiotic for most cases is [[benzathine benzylpenicillin]] [[intramuscular|injected into a muscle]].&lt;ref name=CDC2015Tx/&gt; In those who have a severe [[penicillin allergy]], [[doxycycline]] or [[tetracycline]] may be used.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Tx/&gt; In those with [[neurosyphilis]], [[intravenous]] [[benzylpenicillin]] or [[ceftriaxone]] is recommended.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Tx/&gt; During treatment people may develop fever, headache, and [[myalgia|muscle pains]], a reaction known as [[Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction|Jarisch-Herxheimer]].&lt;ref name=CDC2015Tx/&gt;

===Latent===
Latent syphilis is defined as having [[serology|serologic]] proof of infection without symptoms of disease.&lt;ref name=RedBookSyphilis/&gt; It is further described as either early (less than 1&amp;nbsp;year after secondary syphilis) or late (more than 1&amp;nbsp;year after secondary syphilis) in the United States.&lt;ref name=Eye07/&gt; The United Kingdom uses a cut-off of two years for early and late latent syphilis.&lt;ref name=Pri2008/&gt; Early latent syphilis may have a relapse of symptoms.&lt;!-- Eye07 --&gt; Late latent syphilis is [[asymptomatic]], and not as contagious as early latent syphilis.&lt;ref name=Eye07/&gt;

===Tertiary===
[[File:Tertiary syphilis head.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Model of a head of a person with tertiary (gummatous) syphilis that is located in [[Musée de l'Homme]], Paris.]]
Tertiary syphilis may occur approximately 3 to 15 years after the initial infection, and may be divided into three different forms: gummatous syphilis (15%), late [[neurosyphilis]] (6.5%), and cardiovascular syphilis (10%).&lt;ref name=Kent08/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eye07/&gt; Without treatment, a third of infected people develop tertiary disease.&lt;ref name=Eye07/&gt; People with tertiary syphilis are not infectious.&lt;ref name=Kent08/&gt;

Gummatous syphilis or late [[benignity|benign]] syphilis usually occurs 1 to 46&amp;nbsp;years after the initial infection, with an average of 15&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;!-- Kent08 --&gt; This stage is characterized by the formation of chronic [[gumma (pathology)|gummas]], which are soft, tumor-like balls of inflammation which may vary considerably in size.&lt;!-- Kent08 --&gt; They typically affect the skin, bone, and liver, but can occur anywhere.&lt;ref name=Kent08/&gt;

Neurosyphilis refers to an infection involving the [[central nervous system]]. It may occur early, being either asymptomatic or in the form of syphilitic [[meningitis]], or late as meningovascular syphilis, [[general paresis]], or [[tabes dorsalis]], which is associated with poor balance and lightning pains in the lower extremities.&lt;!-- Kent08 --&gt; Late neurosyphilis typically occurs 4 to 25 years after the initial infection.&lt;!-- Kent08 --&gt; Meningovascular syphilis typically presents with apathy and [[seizure]]s, and general paresis with [[dementia]] and [[tabes dorsalis]].&lt;ref name=Kent08/&gt; Also, there may be [[Argyll Robertson pupil]]s, which are bilateral small pupils that constrict when the person focuses on near objects ([[accommodation reflex]]) but do not constrict when exposed to bright light ([[Light reflex|pupillary reflex]]).

Cardiovascular syphilis usually occurs 10–30&amp;nbsp;years after the initial infection.&lt;!-- Kent08 --&gt; The most common complication is [[syphilitic aortitis]], which may result in [[aortic aneurysm]] formation.&lt;ref name=Kent08/&gt;

===Congenital===
{{Main|Congenital syphilis}}
Congenital syphilis is that which is transmitted during pregnancy or during birth.&lt;!-- Wood09 --&gt; Two-thirds of syphilitic infants are born without symptoms.&lt;!-- Wood09 --&gt; Common symptoms that develop over the first couple of years of life include [[hepatosplenomegaly|enlargement of the liver and spleen]] (70%), rash (70%), fever (40%), neurosyphilis (20%), and [[pneumonitis|lung inflammation]] (20%).&lt;!-- Wood09 --&gt; If untreated, [[late congenital syphilis]] may occur in 40%, including [[saddle nose]] deformation, [[Higoumenakis sign]], [[saber shin]], or [[Clutton's joints]] among others.&lt;ref name="Wood09" /&gt; Infection during pregnancy is also associated with [[miscarriage]].&lt;ref name="Will2013"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Williams Obstetrics|last=Cunningham|first=F, Leveno KJ, Bloom SL, Spong CY, Dashe JS, Hoffman BL, Casey BM, Sheffield JS|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=5|chapter=Abortion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Treponema pallidum}}
''Treponema pallidum'' subspecies'' pallidum'' is a spiral-shaped, [[Gram-negative]], highly mobile bacterium.&lt;ref name=Music08/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pri2008/&gt; Three other human diseases are caused by related ''Treponema pallidum'' subspecies, including [[yaws]] (subspecies ''pertenue''), [[Pinta (disease)|pinta]] (subspecies ''carateum'') and [[nonvenereal endemic syphilis|bejel]] (subspecies ''endemicum'').&lt;ref name=Kent08/&gt; Unlike subspecies ''pallidum'', they do not cause neurological disease.&lt;ref name=Wood09/&gt; Humans are the only known [[natural reservoir]] for subspecies ''pallidum''.&lt;ref name=ST10/&gt; It is unable to survive more than a few days without a [[Host (biology)|host]].&lt;!-- Pri2008 --&gt; This is due to its small genome (1.14[[base pair|Mbp]]) failing to encode the metabolic pathways necessary to make most of its macronutrients.&lt;!-- Pri2008 --&gt; It has a slow [[doubling time]] of greater than 30&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;ref name=Pri2008/&gt;

===Transmission===
Syphilis is transmitted primarily by sexual contact or during [[pregnancy]] from a mother to her [[fetus]]; the spirochete is able to pass through intact mucous membranes or compromised skin.&lt;ref name=Kent08/&gt;&lt;ref name=ST10/&gt; It is thus transmissible by [[kissing]] near a lesion, as well as [[Oral sex|oral]], [[Vaginal sex|vaginal]], and [[anal sex]].&lt;ref name=Kent08/&gt; Approximately 30% to 60% of those exposed to primary or secondary syphilis will get the disease.&lt;ref name=Eye07&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bhatti MT |title=Optic neuropathy from viruses and spirochetes |journal=Int Ophthalmol Clin |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=37–66, ix |year=2007 |pmid=18049280 |doi=10.1097/IIO.0b013e318157202d |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[infectivity]] is exemplified by the fact that an individual [[Inoculation|inoculated]] with only 57 organisms has a 50% chance of being infected.&lt;ref name=Pri2008/&gt; Most (60%) of new cases in the United States occur in men who have sex with men.&lt;!-- Kent08 --&gt; Syphilis can be transmitted by [[blood product]]s, but the risk is low due to screening of [[Blood donation|donated blood]] in many countries.&lt;!-- Kent08 --&gt; The risk of transmission from [[sharing needles]] appears limited.&lt;ref name=Kent08/&gt;

It is not generally possible to contract syphilis through toilet seats, daily activities, hot tubs, or sharing eating utensils or clothing.&lt;ref name=CDC2014&gt;{{cite web |title= Syphilis &amp; MSM (Men Who Have Sex With Men) - CDC Fact Sheet |publisher= [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) |date= 16 September 2010 |url= http://m.cdc.gov/en/HealthSafetyTopics/DiseasesConditions/STDs/syphilisMSM_FS |accessdate= 18 October 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141024093624/http://m.cdc.gov/en/HealthSafetyTopics/DiseasesConditions/STDs/syphilisMSM_FS |archivedate= 24 October 2014 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is mainly because the bacteria die very quickly outside of the body, making transmission by [[fomite|objects]] extremely difficult.&lt;ref name="Csonka1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=G.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Syphilis false shame and fear may destroy your future.png|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=Poster for testing of syphilis, showing a man and a woman bowing their heads in shame|This poster acknowledges the social stigma of syphilis, while urging those who possibly have the disease to be tested (circa 1936).]]
Syphilis is difficult to diagnose clinically during early infection.&lt;ref name=Pri2008/&gt; Confirmation is either via [[blood tests]] or direct visual inspection using [[Dark-field microscopy|dark field microscopy]].&lt;!-- Kent08 --&gt; Blood tests are more commonly used, as they are easier to perform.&lt;ref name=Kent08/&gt; Diagnostic tests are unable to distinguish between the stages of the disease.&lt;ref name= Orgin10/&gt;

===Blood tests===
Blood tests are divided into [[Nontreponemal tests for syphilis|nontreponemal]] and treponemal tests.&lt;ref name=Pri2008/&gt;

Nontreponemal tests are used initially, and include [[venereal disease research laboratory]] (VDRL) and [[rapid plasma reagin]] (RPR) tests. [[False positive#Type I error|False positives]] on the nontreponemal tests can occur with some viral infections, such as [[varicella]] (chickenpox) and [[measles]]. False positives can also occur with [[lymphoma]], [[tuberculosis]], [[malaria]], [[endocarditis]], [[connective tissue disease]], and [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref name="RedBookSyphilis"/&gt;

Because of the possibility of false positives with nontreponemal tests, confirmation is required with a treponemal test, such as [[treponemal pallidum particle agglutination]] (TPHA) or [[fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test]] (FTA-Abs).&lt;ref name="Kent08"/&gt; Treponemal antibody tests usually become positive two to five weeks after the initial infection.&lt;ref name="Pri2008"/&gt; Neurosyphilis is diagnosed by finding high numbers of [[leukocytes]] (predominately [[lymphocytes]]) and high protein levels in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] in the setting of a known syphilis infection.&lt;ref name="Kent08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RedBookSyphilis"/&gt;

===Direct testing===
[[Dark field microscopy]] of [[serous fluid]] from a chancre may be used to make an immediate diagnosis.&lt;!-- Pri2008 --&gt; Hospitals do not always have equipment or experienced staff members, and testing must be done within 10&amp;nbsp;minutes of acquiring the sample.&lt;!-- Pri2008 --&gt; [[Sensitivity and specificity|Sensitivity]] has been reported to be nearly 80%; therefore the test can only be used to confirm a diagnosis, not to rule one out.&lt;!-- Pri2008 --&gt; Two other tests can be carried out on a sample from the chancre: [[direct fluorescent antibody]] (DFA) and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) tests.&lt;!-- Pri2008 --&gt; DFA uses [[antibodies]] tagged with [[fluorescein]], which attach to specific syphilis proteins, while PCR uses techniques to detect the presence of specific syphilis [[gene]]s.&lt;!-- Pri2008 --&gt; These tests are not as time-sensitive, as they do not require living bacteria to make the diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Pri2008/&gt;

==Prevention==

===Vaccine===
{{As of|2018}}, there is no [[vaccine]] effective for prevention.&lt;ref name=ST10/&gt; Several vaccines based on treponemal proteins reduce lesion development in an [[animal model]] but research continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cameron|first1=CE|last2=Lukehart|first2=SA|title=Current status of syphilis vaccine development: need, challenges, prospects.|journal=Vaccine|date=20 March 2014|volume=32|issue=14|pages=1602–9|pmid=24135571|doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.09.053|pmc=3951677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex===
[[Condom]] use reduces the likelihood of transmission during sex, but does not completely eliminate the risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=July 2009|title=A systematic review of epidemiologic studies assessing condom use and risk of syphilis|url=|journal=Sex Transm Dis|volume=36|issue=7|pages=401–5|doi=10.1097/OLQ.0b013e3181a396eb|pmid=19455075|vauthors=Koss CA, Dunne EF, Warner L}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) states, "Correct and consistent use of latex condoms can reduce the risk of syphilis only when the infected area or site of potential exposure is protected. However, a syphilis sore outside of the area covered by a latex condom can still allow transmission, so caution should be exercised even when using a condom."&lt;ref name="CDC Fact Sheet"/&gt;

[[Abstinence]] from intimate physical contact with an infected person is effective at reducing the transmission of syphilis. The CDC states, "The surest way to avoid transmission of sexually transmitted diseases, including syphilis, is to abstain from sexual contact or to be in a long-term mutually [[monogamous]] relationship with a partner who has been tested and is known to be uninfected."&lt;ref name="CDC Fact Sheet"&gt;{{cite web |title= Syphilis - CDC Fact Sheet |publisher= [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) |date= 16 September 2010 |url= https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-syphilis-detailed.htm |accessdate= 30 May 2007 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120916073018/http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/STDFact-Syphilis-detailed.htm |archivedate= 16 September 2012 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==

===Early infections===
The first-line treatment for uncomplicated syphilis remains a single dose of [[Intramuscular injection|intramuscular]] [[benzathine benzylpenicillin]].&lt;ref name=CDC2015a/&gt; [[Doxycycline]] and [[tetracycline]] are alternative choices for those allergic to penicillin; due to the risk of [[birth defect]]s, these are not recommended for pregnant women.&lt;ref name=CDC2015a&gt;{{cite web|last1=Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)|title=Syphilis-CDC fact sheet|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-syphilis-detailed.htm|website=CDC|accessdate=1 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225182123/http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-syphilis-detailed.htm|archivedate=25 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antibiotic resistance|Resistance]] to [[macrolide]]s, [[rifampicin]], and [[clindamycin]] is often present.&lt;ref name=ST10/&gt; [[Ceftriaxone]], a third-generation [[cephalosporin]] [[antibiotic]], may be as effective as penicillin-based treatment.&lt;ref name=Kent08/&gt; It is recommended that a treated person avoid sex until the sores are healed.&lt;ref name=CDC2014/&gt;

===Late infections===
For neurosyphilis, due to the poor penetration of benzathine penicillin into the [[central nervous system]], those affected are given large doses of [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] [[penicillin]] for a minimum of 10 days.&lt;ref name=Kent08/&gt;&lt;ref name=ST10/&gt; If a person is allergic to penicillin, ceftriaxone may be used or penicillin desensitization attempted.&lt;!-- Kent08 --&gt; Other late presentations may be treated with once-weekly intramuscular benzathine penicillin for three weeks.&lt;!-- Kent08 --&gt; Treatment at this stage solely limits further progression of the disease and has a limited effect on damage which has already occurred.&lt;ref name=Kent08/&gt;

===Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction===
One of the potential side effects of treatment is the [[Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction]].&lt;!-- Kent08 --&gt; It frequently starts within one hour and lasts for 24 hours, with symptoms of fever, muscle pains, headache, and a [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]].&lt;ref name="Kent08"/&gt; It is caused by [[cytokines]] released by the immune system in response to [[lipoprotein]]s released from rupturing syphilis bacteria.&lt;ref name=Radolf2006&gt;{{cite book |author= Radolf, JD; Lukehart SA (editors) |year=2006 |title=Pathogenic ''Treponema'': Molecular and Cellular Biology |publisher=Caister Academic Press |isbn= 1-904455-10-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th through 19th centuries, syphilis was one of the largest public health burdens in [[prevalence]], symptoms, and disability,&lt;ref name="de_Kruif_1932"&gt;{{cite book |author=de Kruif, Paul |authorlink=Paul de Kruif |chapter=Ch. 7: Schaudinn: The Pale Horror |title=Men Against Death |publisher=Harcourt, Brace  |location=New York |year=1932 |oclc=11210642 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IokwAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=editions:IokwAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|208–209}}&lt;ref name="pmid_"&gt;{{Citation |last=Rayment |first=Michael |last2=Sullivan |first2=Ann K |display-authors=etal |year=2011 |title="He who knows syphilis knows medicine"—the return of an old friend |journal=British Journal of Cardiology |volume=18 |issue= |pages=56–58 |url=https://bjcardio.co.uk/2011/04/he-who-knows-syphilis-knows-medicine-the-return-of-an-old-friend/ |quote=“He who knows syphilis knows medicine” said Father of Modern Medicine, Sir William Osler, at the turn of the 20th Century. So common was syphilis in days gone by, all physicians were attuned to its myriad clinical presentations. Indeed, the 19th century saw the development of an entire medical subspecialty – syphilology – devoted to the study of the great imitator, ''[[Treponema pallidum]]''. |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; although records of its true prevalence were generally not kept because of the fearsome and sordid status of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s in those centuries.&lt;ref name="de_Kruif_1932"/&gt;{{rp|208–209}} At the time the [[causative agent]] was unknown but it was well known that it was spread sexually and also often from mother to child. Its association with sex, especially [[sexual promiscuity]] and [[prostitution]], made it an object of fear and revulsion and a taboo. The magnitude of its morbidity and mortality in those centuries reflected that, unlike today, there was no adequate understanding of its [[pathogenesis]] and no truly effective treatments. Its damage was caused not so much by great sickness or death early in the course of the disease but rather by its gruesome effects decades after infection as it progressed to [[neurosyphilis]] with [[tabes dorsalis]].

The causative organism, ''Treponema pallidum'', was first identified by [[Fritz Schaudinn]] and [[Erich Hoffmann]], in 1905.&lt;ref name=Schaudinn1905&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Schaudinn| first1 = Fritz Richard| authorlink1 = Fritz Richard Schaudinn| last2 = Hoffmann| first2 = Erich| authorlink2 = Erich Hoffmann| year = 1905| title = Vorläufiger Bericht über das Vorkommen von Spirochaeten in syphilitischen Krankheitsprodukten und bei Papillomen| trans-title = Preliminary report on the occurrence of Spirochaetes in syphilitic chancres and papillomas| journal = [[Arbeiten aus dem Kaiserlichen Gesundheitsamte]]| publisher = [[Verlag von Julius Springer]]| location = Berlin| volume = 22| pages = 527–534| url = https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_TPkAAAAAYAAJ#page/n535/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Music08"/&gt; The first effective treatment for syphilis was [[Salvarsan]], developed in 1910 by [[Paul Ehrlich]].

Before the discovery and use of antibiotics in the mid-twentieth century, [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and isolation were commonly used, with treatments often worse than the disease.&lt;ref name="Old05"/&gt; During the 20th century, as both [[microbiology]] and [[pharmacology]] advanced greatly, syphilis, like many other infectious diseases, became more of a manageable burden than a scary and disfiguring mystery, at least in [[developed countries]] among those people who could afford to pay for timely diagnosis and treatment.

The Public Health Service started working on this study in 1932 in collaboration with [[Tuskegee University]], a [[historically black college]] in Alabama. Investigators enrolled in the study a total of 600 impoverished, African-American [[sharecroppers]] from [[Macon County, Alabama|Macon County]], [[Alabama]]. Of these men, 399 had previously contracted syphilis before the study began, and 201 did not have the disease.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; The men were given free medical care, meals, and free burial insurance for participating in the study. The men were told that the study was only going to last six months, but it actually lasted 40 years.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; After funding for treatment was lost, the study was continued without informing the men that they would never be treated. None of the men infected were ever told that they had the disease, and none were treated with [[penicillin]] even after the antibiotic was proven to successfully treat syphilis. According to the [[Centers for Disease Control]], the men were told that they were being treated for "bad blood", a colloquialism that described various conditions such as syphilis, anemia, and fatigue. "Bad blood"—specifically the collection of illnesses the term included—was a leading cause of death within the southern African-American community.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt;

The 40-year study was controversial for reasons related to [[medical ethics|ethical standards]]. Researchers knowingly failed to treat patients appropriately after the 1940s validation of [[penicillin]] was found as an effective cure for the disease that they were studying. The revelation in 1972 of study failures by a [[whistleblower]], [[Peter Buxtun]], led to major changes in U.S. law and regulation on the protection of participants in clinical studies. Now studies require [[informed consent]],&lt;ref name="hhs.gov"&gt;{{cite web | title = Code of Federal Regulations Title 45 Part 46 Protections of Human Subjects 46.1.1(i) | publisher = U.S. Department of Health and Humand Services | date = January 15, 2009 | url = https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/ohrpregulations.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate = February 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; communication of [[diagnosis]], and accurate reporting of test results.&lt;ref name="hsl.virginia.edu"&gt;{{cite web | title = Final Report of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study Legacy Committee | publisher = Tuskegee Syphilis Study Legacy Committee | date = May 20, 1996 | url = http://www.hsl.virginia.edu/historical/medical_history/bad_blood/report.cfm|accessdate = December 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar experiments were carried out in [[Guatemala]] from 1946 to 1948. It was done during the administration of American President [[Harry S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4064">'''''The Food Defect Action Levels: Levels of natural or unavoidable defects in foods that present no health hazards for humans''''' is a publication of the [[United States Food and Drug Administration]]'s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition&lt;ref name="defects"&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/SanitationTransportation/ucm056174.htm The Food Defect Action Levels], last revised November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; detailing acceptable levels of food contamination from sources such as [[maggots]], [[thrips]], insect fragments, "foreign matter", [[mold]], [[rodent]] hairs, and insect and mammalian [[feces]].

The publication details the acceptable amounts of contaminants on a per food basis, listing both the defect source (pre-harvest infection, [[Food processing|processing]] infestation, processing contamination, etc.) and significance (aesthetic, potential health hazard, mouth/tooth injury, etc.).  For example, the limit of insect contaminants allowed in [[Canning|canned]] or frozen [[peach]]es is specified as: "In 12 1-pound cans or equivalent, one or more [[larva]]e and/or larval fragments whose aggregate length exceeds 5 mm."&lt;ref name="defects"/&gt;

''The Food Defect Action Levels'' was first published in 1995.  A printed version of the publication may be obtained by written request to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or by clicking [https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/SanitationTransportation/ucm056174.htm here].

==Health hazards==
The insect fragments are classified as an aesthetic problem.  ''The Food Defect Action Levels'' states that these contaminants "pose no inherent hazard to health."&lt;ref name="defects"/&gt;

'''Webbed penis''', also called '''penis palmatus''' or '''penoscrotal fusion''', is an acquired or [[congenital]] condition in which the scrotal skin extends onto the ventral penile shaft. The penile shaft is buried in scrotum or tethered to the scrotal midline by a fold or web of skin. The [[urethra]] and erectile bodies are usually normal. Webbed penis is usually [[asymptomatic]], but the cosmetic appearance is often unacceptable. This condition may be corrected by surgical techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abbate |first=B |last2=Danti |first2=DA |last3=Pancani |first3=S |last4=Pampaloni |first4=A |title=Congenital anomalies of the penis in children.

In the [[congenital]] form, the deformity represents an abnormality of the attachment between the penis and the scrotum; the penis, the urethra, and the remainder of the scrotum typically are normal.

Webbed penis may also be acquired ([[iatrogenic]]) after circumcision or other penile surgery, resulting from excessive removal of ventral penile skin; the penis can retract into the scrotum, resulting in secondary [[phimosis]] (trapped penis).
