'''AP Physics B''' was an [[Advanced Placement]] [[science]] course equivalent to a year-long introductory college course in physics. High school students studied [[Newtonian Mechanics|Newtonian mechanics]], [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]], [[Fluid Mechanics|fluid mechanics]], and [[Thermodynamics|thermal physics]], [[wave|waves]] and [[optics]], and [[atom]]ic and [[Nuclear Physics|nuclear physics]] in preparation for a cumulative exam given each May. The course was non-calculus-based and involved [[algebra]] and [[trigonometry]] to solve various physics problems. &lt;ref name="CB0922"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/sub_physb.html?physicsb|title=AP Physics B|year=2011|work=AP Central|publisher=[[College Board]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702141730/http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/sub_physb.html?physicsb|archivedate=2 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no|accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This course also helped prepare students for the [[SAT Subject Test in Physics]], which is also administered by [[College Board]].

Beginning in the 2014-2015 school year, the College Board has discontinued AP Physics B and replaced it with [[AP Physics 1]] and [[AP Physics 2]], making May 2014 the last administration of the AP Physics B exam.

==Exam==

The exam consisted of a 70 MCQ section, followed by a 6-7 FRQ section. Each section was 90 minutes and was worth 50% of the final score. The MCQ section banned calculators, while the FRQ allowed calculators and a list of common formulas. Overall, the exam was configured to approximately cover a set percentage of each of the five target categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/physics_b/topic.html?physicsb |title=AP: Physics B: Topic Outline |publisher=Collegeboard.com |accessdate=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==

According to the College Board web site, the Physics B course provided "a foundation in physics for students in the life sciences, premedicine, and some applied sciences, as well as other fields not directly related to science."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/ap/students/physics/ap-cd-physics-0607.pdf |title=2006, 2007 AP Physics Course Description |format=PDF |accessdate=December 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210223217/http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/ap/students/physics/ap-cd-physics-0607.pdf |archivedate=February 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discontinuation==
Starting in the 2014–2015 school year, AP Physics B was no longer offered, and AP Physics 1 and AP Physics 2 took its place. Like AP Physics B, both are algebra-based, and both are designed to be taught as year-long courses.&lt;ref&gt;http://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/science/physics&lt;/ref&gt;

A fundamental principle in the field of [[acoustics]], the acoustic approximation states that an acoustic wave is created by a small, adiabatic, pressure [[Capillary wave|ripple]] riding on a comparatively large equilibrium ([[bias]]) [[pressure]]. Typically, the acoustic pressure is on the order of a few ppm of the equilibrium pressure.

By extension, the acoustic approximation also guarantees that an acoustic wave travels at a speed exactly equal to the local [[speed of sound]], such that the [[Mach number]]:

&lt;math&gt;M = 1&lt;/math&gt;

'''Actuarial notation''' is a shorthand method to allow [[Actuary|actuaries]] to record mathematical formulas that deal with [[Interest|interest rates]] and [[life tables]].

Traditional notation uses a [[halo system]] where symbols are placed as [[superscript]] or [[subscript]] before or after the main letter. Example notation using the halo system can be seen below.

Various proposals have been made to adopt a linear system where all the notation would be on a single line without the use of superscripts or subscripts. Such a method would be useful for computing where representation of the halo system can be extremely difficult. However, a standard linear system has yet to emerge.

==Example notation==

===Interest rates===
&lt;math&gt;\,i&lt;/math&gt; is the annual [[effective interest rate]], which is the "true" rate of interest over ''a year''. Thus if the annual interest rate is 12% then &lt;math&gt;\,i = 0.12&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\,i^{(m)}&lt;/math&gt; (pronounced "i ''upper'' m") is the [[nominal interest rate]] convertible &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; times a year, and is numerically equal to &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; times the effective rate of interest over one &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''th''&lt;/sup&gt; of a year. For example, &lt;math&gt;\,i^{(2)}&lt;/math&gt; is the nominal rate of interest convertible semiannually. If the effective annual rate of interest is 12%, then &lt;math&gt;\,i^{(2)}/2&lt;/math&gt; represents the effective interest rate every six months. Since &lt;math&gt;\,(1.0583)^{2}=1.12&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\,i^{(2)}/2=0.0583&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt;\,i^{(2)}=0.1166&lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;sup&gt;"(m)"&lt;/sup&gt; appearing in the symbol &lt;math&gt;\,i^{(m)}&lt;/math&gt; is not an "[[exponent]]." It merely represents the number of interest conversions, or compounding times, per year. Semi-annual compounding, (or converting interest every six months), is frequently used in valuing [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] (see also [[fixed income securities]]) and similar [[monetary financial liability]] instruments, whereas home [[mortgages]] frequently convert interest monthly. Following the above example again where &lt;math&gt;\,i=0.12&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\,i^{(12)}=0.1139&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;\,\left(1+\frac{0.1139}{12}\right)^{12}=1.12&lt;/math&gt;.

Effective and nominal rates of interest are not the same because interest paid in earlier measurement periods "earns" interest in later measurement periods; this is called [[compound interest]]. That is, nominal rates of interest credit interest to an investor, (alternatively charge, or [[debit]], interest to a debtor), more frequently than do effective rates. The result is more frequent compounding of interest income to the investor, (or interest expense to the debtor), when nominal rates are used.

The symbol &lt;math&gt;\,v&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[present value]] of 1 to be paid one year from now:
:&lt;math&gt;\,v = {(1+i)}^{-1}\approx 1-i+i^2&lt;/math&gt;
This present value factor, or discount factor, is used to determine the amount of money that must be invested now in order to have a given amount of money in the future. For example, if you need 1 in one year, then the amount of money you should invest now is: &lt;math&gt;\,1 \times v&lt;/math&gt;. If you need 25 in 5 years the amount of money you should invest now is: &lt;math&gt;\,25 \times v^5&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\,d&lt;/math&gt; is the [[annual effective discount rate]]:
:&lt;math&gt;d = \frac{i}{1+i}\approx i-i^2&lt;/math&gt;
The value of &lt;math&gt;\,d&lt;/math&gt; can also be calculated from the following relationships: &lt;math&gt;\,(1-d) = v = {(1+i)}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
The rate of discount equals the amount of interest earned during a one-year period, divided by the balance of money at the end of that period. By contrast, an annual effective rate of interest is calculated by dividing the amount of interest earned during a one-year period by the balance of money at the beginning of the year. The present value (today) of a payment of 1 that is to be made &lt;math&gt;\,n&lt;/math&gt; years in the future is &lt;math&gt;\,{(1-d)}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;. This is analogous to the formula &lt;math&gt;\,{(1+i)}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; for the future (or accumulated) value &lt;math&gt;\,n&lt;/math&gt; years in the future of an amount of 1 invested today.

&lt;math&gt;\,d^{(m)}&lt;/math&gt;, the nominal rate of discount convertible &lt;math&gt;\,m&lt;/math&gt; times a year, is analogous to &lt;math&gt;\,i^{(m)}&lt;/math&gt;. Discount is converted on an &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''th''&lt;/sup&gt;-ly basis.

&lt;math&gt;\,\delta&lt;/math&gt;, the [[force of interest]], is the limiting value of the nominal rate of interest when &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; increases without bound:

:&lt;math&gt;\,\delta = \lim_{m\to\infty}i^{(m)}&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, interest is [[continuously compounded interest|convertible continuously]].

The general relationship between &lt;math&gt;\,i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\,\delta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\,d&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;\,(1+i) = \left(1+\frac{i^{(m)}}{m}\right)^{m} = e^{\delta} = \left(1-\frac{d^{(m)}}{m}\right)^{-m} = (1-d)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Their numerical value can be compared as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\, i &gt; i^{(2)} &gt; i^{(3)} &gt; \cdots &gt; \delta &gt; \cdots &gt; d^{(3)} &gt; d^{(2)} &gt; d&lt;/math&gt;

===Life tables===
A [[life table]] (or a mortality table) is a mathematical construction that shows the number of people alive (based on the assumptions used to build the table) at a given age. In addition to the number of lives remaining at each age, a mortality table typically provides various probabilities associated with the development of these values.

&lt;math&gt;\,l_x&lt;/math&gt; is the number of people alive, relative to an original cohort, at age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. As age increases the number of people alive decreases.

&lt;math&gt;\,l_0&lt;/math&gt; is the starting point for &lt;math&gt;\,l_x&lt;/math&gt;: the number of people alive at age 0. This is known as the '''radix''' of the table. Some mortality tables begin at an age greater than 0, in which case the radix is the number of people assumed to be alive at the youngest age in the table.

&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the limiting age of the mortality tables. &lt;math&gt;\,l_n&lt;/math&gt; is zero for all &lt;math&gt;\,n \geq \omega&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\,d_x&lt;/math&gt; is the number of people who die between age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and age &lt;math&gt;x + 1&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\,d_x&lt;/math&gt; may be calculated using the formula &lt;math&gt;\,d_x = l_x - l_{x+1}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\,q_x&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of death between the ages of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and age &lt;math&gt;x + 1&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\,q_x = d_x / l_x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\,p_x&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that a life age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; will survive to age &lt;math&gt;x + 1&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\,p_x = l_{x+1} / l_x&lt;/math&gt;

Since the only possible alternatives from one age (&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;) to the next (&lt;math&gt;x+1&lt;/math&gt;) are living and dying, the relationship between these two probabilities is:

:&lt;math&gt;\,p_x+q_x=1&lt;/math&gt;

These symbols may also be extended to multiple years, by inserting the number of years at the bottom left of the basic symbol.

&lt;math&gt;\,_nd_x = d_x + d_{x+1} + \cdots + d_{x+n-1} = l_x - l_{x+n}&lt;/math&gt; shows the number of people who die between age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and age &lt;math&gt;x + n&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\,_nq_x&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of death between the ages of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and age &lt;math&gt;x + n&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\,_nq_x = {}_nd_x / l_x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\,_np_x&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that a life age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; will survive to age &lt;math&gt;x + n&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\,_np_x = l_{x+n} / l_x&lt;/math&gt;

Another statistic that can be obtained from a life table is [[life expectancy]].

&lt;math&gt;\,e_x&lt;/math&gt; is the curtate expectation of life for a person alive at age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. This is the expected number of complete years remaining to live (you may think of it as the expected number of birthdays that the person will celebrate).

:&lt;math&gt;\,e_x = \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \ _tp_x&lt;/math&gt;

A life table generally shows the number of people alive at integral ages. If we need information regarding a fraction of a year, we must make assumptions with respect to the table, if not already implied by a mathematical formula underlying the table. A common assumption is that of a Uniform Distribution of Deaths (UDD) at each year of age. Under this assumption, &lt;math&gt;\,l_{x+t}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[linear interpolation]] between &lt;math&gt;\,l_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\,l_{x+1}&lt;/math&gt;. i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\,l_{x+t} = (1 - t)l_x + tl_{x+1} &lt;/math&gt;

===Annuities===
The basic symbol for the present value of an [[Annuity (finance theory)|annuity]] is &lt;math&gt;\,a&lt;/math&gt;. The following notation can then be added:

* Notation to the top-right indicates the frequency of payment (i.e., the number of annuity payments that will be made during each year). A lack of such notation means that payments are made annually.
* Notation to the bottom-right indicates the age of the person when the annuity starts and the period for which an annuity is paid.
* Notation directly above the basic symbol indicates when payments are made. Two dots indicates an annuity whose payments are made at the beginning of each year (an "annuity-due"); a horizontal line above the symbol indicates an annuity payable continuously (a "continuous annuity"); no mark above the basic symbol indicates an annuity whose payments are made at the end of each year (an "annuity-immediate").

If the payments to be made under an annuity are independent of any life event, it is known as an [[Annuity (European financial arrangements)#Annuity certain|annuity-certain]]. Otherwise, in particular if payments end upon the [[beneficiary]]'s death, it is called a [[life annuity]].

&lt;math&gt;a_{\overline{n|}i}&lt;/math&gt; (read ''a-angle-n at i'') represents the present value of an annuity-immediate, which is a series of unit payments at the end of each year for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; years (in other words: the value one period before the first of ''n'' payments). This value is obtained from:

:&lt;math&gt;\,a_{\overline{n|}i} = v + v^2 + \cdots + v^n = \frac{1-v^n}{i}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ddot{a}_{\overline{n|}i}&lt;/math&gt; represents the present value of an annuity-due, which is a series of unit payments at the beginning of each year for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; years (in other words: the value at the time of the first of ''n'' payments). This value is obtained from:

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{a}_{\overline{n|}i} = 1 + v + \cdots + v^{n-1} = \frac{1-v^n}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\,s_{\overline{n|}i}&lt;/math&gt; is the value at the time of the last payment, &lt;math&gt;\ddot{s}_{\overline{n|}i}&lt;/math&gt; the value one period later.

If the symbol &lt;math&gt;\,(m)&lt;/math&gt; is added to the top-right corner, it represents the present value of an annuity whose payments occur each one &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;th of a year for a period of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; years, and each payment is one &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;th of a unit.

:&lt;math&gt;a_{\overline{n|}i}^{(m)} = \frac{1-v^n}{i^{(m)}}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\ddot{a}_{\overline{n|}i}^{(m)} = \frac{1-v^n}{d^{(m)}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\overline{a}_{\overline{n|}i}&lt;/math&gt; is the limiting value of &lt;math&gt;\,a_{\overline{n|}i}^{(m)}&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; increases without bound. The underlying annuity is known as a [[continuous annuity]].

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{a}_{\overline{n|}i}= \frac{1-v^n}{\delta}&lt;/math&gt;

The present values of these annuities may be compared as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;a_{\overline{n|}i} &lt; a_{\overline{n|}i}^{(m)} &lt; \overline{a}_{\overline{n|}i} &lt; \ddot{a}_{\overline{n|}i}^{(m)}&lt; \ddot{a}_{\overline{n|}i}&lt;/math&gt;

To understand the relationships shown above, consider that cash flows paid at a later time have a smaller present value than cash flows of the same total amount that are paid at earlier times.

* The subscript &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; which represents the rate of interest may be replaced by &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, and is often omitted if the rate is clearly known from the context.
* When using these symbols, the rate of interest is not necessarily constant throughout the lifetime of the annuities. However, when the rate varies, the above formulas will no longer be valid; particular formulas can be developed for particular movements of the rate.

===Life annuities===
A life annuity is an annuity whose payments are contingent on the continuing life of the annuitant. The age of the annuitant is an important consideration in calculating the [[actuarial present value]] of an annuity.

* The age of the annuitant is placed at the bottom right of the symbol, without an "angle" mark.

For example:

&lt;math&gt;\,a_{65}&lt;/math&gt; indicates an annuity of 1 unit per year payable at the end of each year until death to someone currently age 65

&lt;math&gt;a_{\overline{10|}}&lt;/math&gt; indicates an annuity of 1 unit per year payable for 10 years with payments being made at the end of each year

&lt;math&gt;a_{65:\overline{10|}}&lt;/math&gt; indicates an annuity of 1 unit per year for 10 years, or until death if earlier, to someone currently age 65

&lt;math&gt;a_{65:64}&lt;/math&gt; indicates an annuity of 1 unit per year until the earlier death of member or death of spouse, to someone currently age 65 and spouse age 64

&lt;math&gt;a_{\overline{65:64}}&lt;/math&gt; indicates an annuity of 1 unit per year until the later death of member or death of spouse, to someone currently age 65 and spouse age 64. 

&lt;math&gt;a_{65}^{(12)}&lt;/math&gt; indicates an annuity of 1 unit per year payable 12 times a year (1/12 unit per month) until death to someone currently age 65

&lt;math&gt;{\ddot{a}}_{65}&lt;/math&gt; indicates an annuity of 1 unit per year payable at the start of each year until death to someone currently age 65

or in general:

&lt;math&gt;a_{x:\overline{n|}i}^{(m)}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the age of the annuitant, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of years of payments (or until death if earlier), &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the number of payments per year, and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is the interest rate.

In the interest of simplicity the notation is limited and does not, for example, show whether the annuity is payable to a man or a woman (a fact that would typically be determined from the context, including whether the life table is based on male or female mortality rates).
 
The Actuarial Present Value of life contingent payments can be treated as the mathematical expectation of a present value random variable, or calculated through the current payment form.

===Life insurance===
The basic symbol for a [[life insurance]] is &lt;math&gt;\,A&lt;/math&gt;. The following notation can then be added:

* Notation to the top-right indicates the timing of the payment of a death benefit. A lack of notation means payments are made at the end of the year of death. A figure in parenthesis (for example &lt;math&gt;A^{(12)}&lt;/math&gt;) means the benefit is payable at the end of the period indicated (12 for monthly; 4 for quarterly; 2 for semi-annually; 365 for daily).
* Notation to the bottom-right indicates the age of the person when the life insurance begins.
* Notation directly above the basic symbol indicates the "type" of life insurance, whether payable at the end of the period or immediately. A horizontal line indicates life insurance payable immediately, whilst no mark above the symbol indicates payment is to be made at the end of the period indicated.

For example:

&lt;math&gt;\,A_x&lt;/math&gt; indicates a life insurance benefit of 1 payable at the end of the year of death.

&lt;math&gt;\,A_x^{(12)}&lt;/math&gt; indicates a life insurance benefit of 1 payable at the end of the month of death.

&lt;math&gt;\,\overline{A}_x&lt;/math&gt; indicates a life insurance benefit of 1 payable at the (mathematical) instant of death.

== Force of mortality ==

Among actuaries, '''force of mortality''' refers to what [[economists]] and other social scientists call the [[hazard rate]] and is construed as an instantaneous rate of mortality at a certain age measured on an annualized basis.

In a life table, we consider the probability of a person dying between age (''x'') and age ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1; this probability is called ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;. In the continuous case, we could also consider the [[conditional probability]] that a person who has attained age (''x'') will die between age (''x'') and age (''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;Δ''x'') as:

: &lt;math&gt;P_{\Delta x}(x)=P(x&lt;X&lt;x+\Delta\;x\mid\;X&gt;x)=\frac{F_X(x+\Delta\;x)-F_X(x)}{(1-F_X(x))}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is the [[cumulative distribution function]] of the continuous age-at-death [[random variable]], X. As Δ''x'' tends to zero, so does this probability in the continuous case. The approximate force of mortality is this probability divided by Δ''x''. If we let Δ''x'' tend to zero, we get the function for '''force of mortality''', denoted as ''μ''(''x''):

:&lt;math&gt;\mu\,(x)=\frac{F'_X(x)}{1-F_X(x)}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Altimir Glacier''' ({{lang-bg|italic=yes|ледник Алтимир}}, 'Lednik Altimir' \'led-nik al-ti-'mir\) is a {{convert|4.8|km|adj=on}} long and {{convert|5.5|km|adj=on}} wide glacier draining the north slopes of the [[Osterrieth Range]] on [[Anvers Island]] in the [[Palmer Archipelago]], [[Antarctica]]. It flows northwards to enter [[Dalchev Cove]] in [[Fournier Bay]] east of [[Studena Point]].

The glacier is named after the settlement of [[Altimir]] in northwestern [[Bulgaria]].

==Location==
Altimir Glacier is located at {{coord|64|35|50|S|63|09|00|W|display=inline,title}}.  It was mapped by the British [[Directorate of Overseas Surveys]] in 1980.

The '''angular momentum problem''' is a problem in astrophysics identified by [[Leon Mestel]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://academic.oup.com/astrogeo/article/53/5/5.19/208905/Losing-spin-the-angular-momentum-problem|title=Losing spin: the angular momentum problem|last=Ray|first=Tom|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|access-date=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was found that the angular momentum of a [[protoplanetary disk]] is misappropriated when compared to models during stellar birth. The [[Sun]] and other stars are predicted by models to be rotating considerably faster than they actually are. The Sun, for example, only accounts for about 0.3 percent of the total angular momentum of the [[Solar System]] while about 60% is attributed to [[Jupiter]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38593">'''Appraisal theory''' is the theory in [[psychology]] that [[emotions]] are extracted from our evaluations (appraisals or estimates) of events that cause specific reactions in different people. Essentially, our appraisal of a situation causes an emotional, or affective, response that is going to be based on that appraisal.&lt;ref name="Scherer, K. R. 2001"/&gt; An example of this is going on a first [[Dating (activity)|date]]. If the date is perceived as positive, one might feel [[happiness]], [[joy]], giddiness, [[Psychomotor agitation|excitement]], and/or [[anticipation (emotion)|anticipation]], because they have appraised this event as one that could have positive long-term effects, i.e. starting a new relationship, [[engagement]], or even [[marriage]]. On the other hand, if the date is perceived negatively, then our emotions, as a result, might include [[depression (mood)|dejection]], [[sadness]], [[emptiness]], or [[fear]]. (Scherer et al., 2001)&lt;ref name="Scherer, K. R. 2001"&gt;Scherer, K. R., &amp; Shorr, A., &amp; Johnstone, T. (Ed.). (2001). Appraisal processes in emotion: theory, methods, research . Canary, NC: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reasoning]] and [[understanding]] of one's emotional reaction becomes important for future appraisals as well.  The important aspect of the appraisal theory is that it accounts for individual variability in emotional reactions to the same event.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Craig A. &amp; Lazarus, Richard S. (1990).  Chapter 23. Emotion and Adaptation. In L.A. Pervin (Ed.). ''Handbook of Personality: Theory and Research.'' (pp. 609-637). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt;

Appraisal theories of emotion are theories that state that emotions result from people's interpretations and explanations of their circumstances even in the absence of physiological arousal (Aronson, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, E., Wilson, T.D., &amp; Akert, R.M. (2005). Social psychology, 7th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two basic approaches; the structural approach and process model. These models both provide an explanation for the appraisal of emotions and explain in different ways how emotions can develop. In the absence of physiological arousal we decide how to feel about a situation after we have interpreted and explained the phenomena. Thus the sequence of events is as follows: event, thinking, and simultaneous events of arousal and emotion. Social psychologists have used this theory to explain and predict coping mechanisms and people's patterns of emotionality. By contrast, for example, [[personality psychology]] studies emotions as a function of a person's personality, and thus does not take into account the person's appraisal, or cognitive response, to a situation.{{Example needed|reason=this is a strawman argument against an entire discipline. Need an example from a specific personality theory|date=September 2018}}

The main controversy surrounding these theories argues that emotions cannot happen without physiological arousal.

== History ==

For the past several decades, appraisal theory has developed and evolved as a prominent theory in the field of communication and psychology by testing affect and emotion. In history, the most basic ideology dates back to some of the most notable philosophers such as [[Aristotle]], [[Plato]], the [[Stoics]], [[Spinoza]] and [[David Hume|Hume]], and even early German psychologist Stumpf (Reisenzein &amp; Schonpflug, 1992).&lt;ref&gt;Scherer, K. R., &amp; Shorr, A., &amp; Johnstone, T. (Ed.). (2001). Appraisal processes in emotion: theory, methods, research . Canary, NC: Oxford University Press. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the past fifty years, this theory has expanded exponentially with the dedication of two prominent researchers: Magda Arnold and Richard Lazarus, amongst others who have contributed appraisal theories.

The question studied under appraisal theories is why people react to things differently.  Even when presented with the same, or a similar situation all people will react in slightly different ways based on their perception of the situation.  These perceptions elicit various emotions that are specific to each person.  About 30 years ago, psychologists and researchers began to categorize these emotions into different groups.  This is where cognitive appraisal theory stems from.  They decided to categorize these emotional reaction behaviors as appraisals.  The two main theories of appraisal are the structural model and the process model.  These models are broken down into subtypes as well (Smith &amp; Kirby, 2009).&lt;ref name="Smith, Craig A. 2009"&gt;Smith, Craig A., &amp; Kirby, Leslie D. (2009). Putting appraisal in context: Toward a relational model of appraisal and emotion. Cognition and Emotion, 23 (7), 1352–1372.&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers have attempted to specify particular appraisals of events that elicit emotions (Roseman et al., 1996).&lt;ref&gt;Roseman, I.J. and Smith, C.A. (2001). Appraisal theory: overview, assumptions, varieties, controversies.. New York, NY: Oxford University Press, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Magda Arnold ===

Dating back to the 1940s and 1950s, Magda Arnold took an avid interest in researching the appraisal of emotions accompanying general arousal. Specifically, Arnold wanted to "introduce the idea of emotion differentiation by postulating that emotions such as [[fear]], [[anger]], and [[Psychomotor agitation|excitement]] could be distinguished by different excitatory phenomena" (Arnold, 1950).&lt;ref&gt;Scherer, K. R., &amp; Shorr, A., &amp; Johnstone, T. (Ed.). (2001). Appraisal processes in emotion: theory, methods, research . Canary, NC: Oxford University Press. p. 21&lt;/&lt;/ref&gt; With these new ideas, she developed her "cognitive theory" in the 1960s, which specified that the first step in emotion is an appraisal of the situation.&lt;ref&gt;Scherer, K. R., &amp; Shorr, A., &amp; Johnstone, T. (Ed.). (2001). Appraisal processes in emotion: theory, methods, research . Canary, NC: Oxford University Press. p. 21,22&lt;/&lt;/ref&gt; According to Arnold, the initial appraisals start the emotional sequence and arouse both the appropriate actions and the emotional experience itself, so that the physiological changes, recognized as important, accompany, but do not initiate, the actions and experiences (Arnold, 1960a).&lt;ref name="Scherer-Shorr-Johnston-p22"&gt;Scherer, K. R., &amp; Shorr, A., &amp; Johnstone, T. (Ed.). (2001). Appraisal processes in emotion: theory, methods, research . Canary, NC: Oxford University Press. p. 22&lt;/&lt;/ref&gt; A notable advancement was Arnold's idea of intuitive appraisal in which she describes emotions that are good or bad for the person lead to an action. For example, if a student studies hard all semester in a difficult class and passes the tough mid-term exam with an "A", the felt emotion of happiness will motivate the student to keep studying hard for that class.

[[Emotion]] is a difficult concept to define as emotions are constantly changing for each individual, but Arnold's continued advancements and changing theory led her to keep researching her work within appraisal theory.  Furthermore, the 1970s proved to be difficult as fellow researchers challenged her theory with questions concerning the involvement of psycho physiological factors and the psychological experiences at the Loyola Symposium on Feelings and Emotions.&lt;ref name="Scherer-Shorr-Johnston-p22" /&gt; Despite this and re-evaluating the theory, Arnold's discoveries paved the way for other researchers to learn about variances of emotion, affect, and their relation to each other.

=== Richard Lazarus ===

Following close to Magda Arnold in terms of appraisal theory examination was [[Richard Lazarus]] who continued to research emotions through appraisal theory before his death in 2002. Since he began researching in the 1950s, this concept evolves and expands to include new research, methods, and procedures. Although Arnold had a difficult time with questions, Lazarus and other researchers discussed the biopsychological components of the theory at the Loyola Symposium ("Towards a Cognitive Theory of Emotion").&lt;ref name="Scherer, K. R. 2001 p. 23"&gt;Scherer, K. R., &amp; Shorr, A., &amp; Johnstone, T. (Ed.). (2001). Appraisal processes in emotion: theory, methods, research . Canary, NC: Oxford University Press. p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, he identified two essential factors in an essay in which he discusses the cognitive aspects of emotion: "first, what is the nature of the cognitions (or appraisals) which underlie separate emotional reactions (e.g. [[fear]], [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[grief]], [[joy]], etc.). Second, what are the determining antecedent conditions of these cognitions." (Lazarus, Averill, &amp; Opton (1970, p.&amp;nbsp;219)&lt;ref name="Scherer, K. R. 2001 p. 23" /&gt; These two aspects are absolutely crucial in defining the reactions that stem from the initial emotions that underlie the reactions. Moreover, Lazarus specified two major types of appraisal methods which sit at the crux of the appraisal method: 1) primary appraisal, directed at the establishment of the significance or meaning of the event to the organism, and 2) secondary appraisal, directed at the assessment of the ability of the organism to cope with the consequences of the event.&lt;ref name="Scherer, K. R. 2001 p. 23" /&gt;  These two types go hand in hand as one establishes the importance of the event while the following assesses the coping mechanisms which Lazarus divided up into two parts: direct actions and [[cognitive reappraisal]] processes.

To simplify Lazarus's theory and emphasize his stress on cognition, as you are experiencing an event, your thought must precede the arousal and emotion (which happen simultaneously).&lt;ref name="21 March 2004"&gt;Psychology 101. Chapter 7: Motivation and Emotion. Section 3, Emotion. All Psych Online. All Psych and Hefner Media Group, Inc. http://allpsych.com/psychology101/emotion.html. 21 March 2004&lt;/ref&gt; For example: You are about to give a speech in front of 50 of your peers. Your mouth goes dry, your heart beat quickens, your palms sweat, and your legs begin to shake and at the same time you experience fear.

=== Structural model ===
[[File:Transactional Model of Stress and Coping - Richard Lazarus.svg|thumb|Transactional Model of Stress and Coping of Richard Lazarus]]
''The structural model of appraisal'' helps to explain the relation between appraisals and the emotions they elicit.  This model involves examination of the appraisal process as well as examination of how different appraisals influence which emotions are experienced.
According to Lazarus (1991),&lt;ref name="Lazarus, Richard S. 1991"&gt;Lazarus, Richard S. (1991). Progress on a cognitive-motivational-relational theory of Emotion. American Psychologist, 46(8), 819-834.&lt;/ref&gt; theories of emotion involve a relational aspect, a motivational aspect, and a cognitive aspect (Lazarus, 1991).  The relational aspect involves the relationship between a person and the environment and suggests that emotions always involve an interaction between the two (Lazarus, 1991).  The motivational aspect involves an assessment of the status of one's goals and is the aspect of the evaluation of a situation in which a person determines how relevant the situation is to his or her goals (Lazarus, 1991).   Finally, the cognitive component involves one's appraisal of the situation, or an evaluation of how relevant and significant a situation is to one's life (Lazarus, 1991).  Lazarus suggests that different emotions are elicited when situations are evaluated differently according to these three categories.  In order to evaluate each emotion individually, however, a structural model of appraisal is necessary (Lazarus, 1991).  This model allows for the individual components of the appraisal process to be determined for each emotion.  In addition, this model allows for the evaluation of how and where the appraisal processes differ for different emotions (Lazarus, 1991).

====Primary appraisal====
The appraisal process is broken up into two different categories, primary appraisal and secondary appraisal (Lazarus, 1991). In a person's ''primary appraisal,'' he or she evaluates two aspects of a situation: the motivational relevance and the motivational congruence (Smith &amp; Kirby, 2009).&lt;ref name="Smith, Craig A. 2009" /&gt;  When evaluating motivational relevance, an individual answers the question, "How relevant is this situation to my needs?"  Thus, the individual evaluates how important the situation is to his or her well-being.  The motivational relevance aspect of the appraisal of the process has been shown to influence the intensity of the experienced emotions so that when a situation is highly relevant to one's well-being, the situation elicits a more intense emotional response (Smith &amp; Kirby, 2009).  The second aspect of an individual's primary appraisal of a situation is the evaluation of motivational congruence. When evaluating the motivational congruence of a situation, an individual answers the question, "Is this situation congruent or incongruent (consistent or inconsistent) with my goals?" (Smith &amp; Kirby, 2009).&lt;ref name="Smith, Craig A. 2009" /&gt; Individuals experience different emotions when they view a situation as consistent with their goals than when they view it as inconsistent.

====Secondary appraisal====
People's emotions are also influenced by their ''secondary appraisal'' of situations. ''Secondary appraisal'' involves people's evaluation of their resources and options for coping (Lazarus, 1991).&lt;ref name="Lazarus, Richard S. 1991" /&gt;  One aspect of secondary appraisal is a person's evaluation of who should be held accountable.  A person can hold herself, another, or a group of other people accountable for the situation at hand.  Blame may be given for a harmful event and credit may be given for a beneficial event (Lazarus, 1991).&lt;ref name="Lazarus, Richard S. 1991" /&gt; In addition, an individual might also see the situation as due to chance.  The way in which people view who or what should be held accountable directs and guides their efforts to cope with the emotions they experience. Another aspect of [[secondary appraisal]] is a person's coping potential.'' Coping potential'' is potential to use either problem-focused coping or emotion-focused coping strategies to handle an emotional experience. (Smith &amp; Kirby, 2009).&lt;ref name="Smith, Craig A. 2009" /&gt;  ''Problem-focused coping'' refers to one's ability to take action and to change a situation to make it more congruent with one's goals (Smith &amp; Kirby, 2009).  Thus, a person's belief about their ability to perform problem-focused coping influences the emotions they experience in the situation.  On the other hand, ''emotion-focused coping'' refers to one's ability to handle or adjust to the situation should the circumstances remain inconsistent with one's goals (Smith &amp; Kirby, 2009).  Again, the emotions people experience are influenced by how they perceive their ability to perform emotion-focused coping.  The fourth component of secondary appraisal is one's future expectancy (Lazarus, 1991).&lt;ref name="Lazarus, Richard S. 1991" /&gt;  ''Future expectancy'' refers to one's expectations of change in the motivational congruence of a situation (for any reason).  Thus, an individual may believe the situation will change favorably or unfavorably (Lazarus, 1991).  One's future expectancy influences the emotions elicited during a situation as well as the coping strategies used.

The structural model of appraisal suggests that the answers to the different component questions of the primary and secondary categories allow researchers to predict which emotions will be elicited from a certain set of circumstances.  In other words, the theory suggests that researchers are able to examine an individual's appraisal of a situation and then predict the emotional experiences of that individual based upon his or her views of the situation.  An example of a particular emotion and its underlying appraisal components can be seen when examining the emotion of anger.   If a person appraises a situation as motivationally relevant, motivationally incongruent, and also holds a person other than himself accountable, the individual would most likely experience [[anger]] in response to the situation (Smith &amp; Haynes, 1993).  Another example of the appraisal components of an emotion can be given in regards to anxiety.  Like anger, anxiety comes from the evaluation of a situation as motivationally relevant and motivationally incongruent (Lazarus, 1991).&lt;ref name="Lazarus, Richard S. 1991" /&gt; However, where anxiety differs from anger is in who is held accountable.  For anger, another person or group of people is held accountable or blamed for a wrongdoing.  However, in regards to anxiety, there is no obvious person or group to hold accountable or to blame. The structural model of appraisal allows for researchers to assess different appraisal components that lead to different emotions.

=== Process model ===
Appraisal theory, however, has often been critiqued for failing to capture the dynamic nature of emotion. To better analyze the complexities of emotional appraisal, social psychologists have sought to further complement the structural model. One suggested approach was a cyclical process, which moves from appraisal to coping, and then reappraisal, attempting to capture a more long-term theory of emotional responses (Smith &amp; Lazarus 1990).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, C. A., &amp; Lazarus, R. (1990). Emotion and Adaptation. In L. A. Pervin (Ed.), Handbook of Personality: theory &amp; research (pp. 609-637). NY: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This model, however, failed to hold up under scholarly and scientific critique, largely due to the fact that it fails to account for the often rapid or automatic nature of emotional responses (Marsella &amp; Gratch 2009).&lt;ref name="Marsella, S. 2003"&gt;Marsella, S. &amp; Gratch, J. (2003). Modeling coping behaviors in virtual humans: Don't worry, be happy. Paper presented at the Second International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-agent Systems, Melbourne, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; Further addressing the concerns raised with structural and cyclical models of appraisal, two different theories emerged that advocated a process model of appraisal.

==== Two-process model of appraisal ====
Smith and Kirby (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Smith, C. A., &amp; Kirby, L. (2000). Consequences require antecedents: Toward a process model of emotion elicitation. In J. P. Forgas (Ed.), Feeling and Thinking: The role of affect in social cognition (pp. 83-106): Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; argue for a two-process model of appraisal, which expands on the function of the structural model of appraisal. While the structural model of appraisal focuses on what one is evaluating, the process model of appraisal focuses on how one evaluates emotional stimuli. There are three main components to the process model of appraisal: perceptual stimuli, associative processing, and reasoning. Perceptual stimuli are what the individual picks up from his or her surroundings, such as sensations of pain or pleasure, perception of facial expression (Smith &amp; Kirby 2000).  In addition to these stimuli, the process model is composed to two main appraisal processes. Associative processing is a memory-based process that makes quick connections and provides appraisal information based on activated memories that are quickly associated with the given stimulus (Marsella &amp; Gratch 2009).&lt;ref name="Marsella, S. 2003" /&gt; Reasoning is a slower, more deliberate, and thorough process that involves logical, critical thinking about the stimulus and/or situation (Marsella &amp; Gratch 2009). In the two-process model of appraisal theory, associative processing and reasoning work in parallel in reaction to perceptual stimuli, thus providing a more complex and cognitively based appraisal of the emotional encounter (Smith &amp; Kirby 2000).

==== Scherer's multi-level sequential check model ====
An alternative process model of appraisal, Scherer's multi-level sequential check model is made up of three levels of appraisal process, with sequential constraints at each level of processing that create a specifically ordered processing construct (Scherer 2001).&lt;ref&gt;Scherer, K. R. (2001). Appraisal Considered as a Process of Multilevel Sequential Checking. In K. R. Scherer, A. Schorr &amp; T. Johnstone (Eds.), Appraisal Processes in Emotion: Theory, Methods, Research (pp. 92-120): Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The three levels of processing are: innate (sensory-motor), learned (schema-based), and deliberate (conceptual) (Marsella &amp; Gratch 2009).&lt;ref name="Marsella, S. 2003" /&gt; Further, Scherer constructs a strict, ordered progression by which these appraisal processes are carried out. There are various evaluation checks throughout the processes, which allow for observation of stimuli at different points in the process sequence, thus creating a sort of step-by-step appraisal process (Scherer 2001). Such checks include: a relevance (novelty and relevance to goals) check, followed by an implication check (cause, goal conduciveness, and urgency), then coping potential check (control and power), and finally the check for normative significance (compatibility with one's standards) (Marsella &amp; Gratch 2009). While the two-process model involves processes occurring at the same time, parallel to one another, Scherer's multi-level sequential check model is composed of processes that take place in a specific sequence.

=== Roseman's theory of appraisal ===
''Roseman's theory of appraisal'' holds that there are certain appraisal components that interact to elicit different emotions (Roseman, 1996).&lt;ref name="Roseman, Ira J. 1996"&gt;Roseman, Ira J. (1996). Appraisal Determinants of Emotions: Constructing a More Accurate and Comprehensive Theory. Cognition &amp; Emotion, 10: 3, 241 -278.&lt;/ref&gt; One appraisal component that influences which emotion is expressed is ''motive consistency''.  When one evaluates a situation as inconsistent with one's goals, the situation is considered motivationally inconsistent and often elicits a negative emotion, such as anger or regret (Roseman, 1996).&lt;ref name="Roseman, Ira J. 1996" /&gt;   A second component of appraisal that influences the emotional response of an individual is the ''evaluation of responsibility or accountability'' (Roseman, 1996).&lt;ref name="Roseman, Ira J. 1996" /&gt;  A person can hold oneself or another person or group accountable.  An individual might also believe the situation was due to chance.  An individual's evaluation of accountability influences which emotion is experienced.  For example, if one feels responsible for a desirable situation, pride may be an emotion that is experienced.

In addition to the two appraisal components, the different ''intensities'' of each component also influence which emotion or emotions are elicited. Specifically, the ''certainty'' and the ''strength'' of the evaluation of accountability influences which emotions are experienced (Roseman, 1996).&lt;ref name="Roseman, Ira J. 1996" /&gt;  In addition, the ''appetitive or aversive nature of motive consistency'' also influences the emotions that are elicited (Roseman, 1996).

Roseman's theory of appraisal suggests that motive consistency and accountability are the two most important components of the appraisal process (1996).&lt;ref name="Roseman, Ira J. 1996" /&gt;  In addition, the different levels of intensity of each component are important and greatly influence the emotions that are experienced due to a particular situation.

=== Structural v. process oriented models ===

Most models currently advanced are more concerned with structure or contents of appraisals than with process oriented appraisal. "These models attempt to specify the evaluations that initiate specific emotional reactions. Examination of these models indicates that although there is significant overlap [between the two types of structural models], there are also differences: in which appraisals are included; how particular appraisals are operationalized; which emotions are encompassed by a model; and which particular combinations of appraisals are proposed to elicit a particular emotional response." (Scherer et al., 2001).&lt;ref name="Scherer, K. R. 2001" /&gt; Ultimately, structurally based appraisals rely on the idea that our appraisals cultivate the emotional responses. Process-oriented models of appraisal theory are rooted in the idea that it is important to specify the cognitive principles and operations underlying these appraisal modes. Using this orientation for evaluating appraisals, we find fewer issues with repression, a "mental process by which distressing thoughts, memories, or impulses that may give rise to anxiety are excluded from consciousness and left to operate in the unconscious" (Merriam-Webster, 2007).

=== Continuous v. categorical nature of appraisal and emotion ===

Within the continuous versus categorical nature of appraisal and emotion, there are many standpoints of the flow of this appraisal process. To begin, Roseman's (1996) model shows that appraisal information "can vary continuously but categorical boundaries determine which emotion will occur". Motive consistency and inconsistency make up an example of this categorical framework. A positive or negative emotional response in conjunction with the affect has much to do with the appraisal and the amount of motivational consistency. To accurately understand this concept, an example of Roseman's model could come from a motive-consistent goal as it is caused by the self and someone else to reach one's objective in which a positive emotion is created from the specific appraisal event. In addition, Scherer's (1984) model shows that most appraisal falls in a continuous spectrum in which points along the way represent distinct emotional points made possible from the appraisal. Between appraisal space and number of emotions experienced, these two components are both positively correlated. "According to Scherer (1984a), the major categorical labels we used to describe our emotional experiences reflect a somewhat crude attempt to highlight and describe the major or most important ways these emotional experiences vary". With so much variation and levels within one's emotions, it can be seen as injustice to the emotional experience and the appraisal process to limit oneself to such categories. To solve the problem between categorical and continuous appraisal order, it may be a good idea to place discrete emotional categories (i.e. happiness, sadness, etc.) while continuous models represent the varieties, styles, and levels of these already defined distinct emotions.

== Empirical findings and real world applications ==
[[Stanley Schachter]]'s contributions should also be noted as his studies supported the relevance of emotion induced in appraisal. In 1962, Schachter and [[Jerome E. Singer]] devised an experiment to explain the physiological and psychological factors in emotional appraising behaviors. By inducing an experimental group with [[epinephrine]] while maintaining a control group, they were able to test two emotions: euphoria and anger. Using a stooge to elicit a response, the research proved three major findings relevant to appraisal:
#Both cognitive and physiological factors contribute to emotion;
#Under certain circumstances cognition follows physiological arousal; and
#People assess their emotional state, in part, by observing how physiologically stirred up they are (Schachter &amp; Singer, 1962)&lt;ref&gt;Scherer, K. R., &amp; Shorr, A., &amp; Johnstone, T. (Ed.). (2001). Appraisal processes in emotion: theory, methods, research . Canary, NC: Oxford University Press. p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;
By taking into account heightened emotion, reaction to the stooge, as well as prompted questions, all these elicited factors provide a negative or positive affect. Although the study took place in 1962, it is still studied in both psychology and communication fields today as an example of appraisal theory in relation to affect and emotion.
Through these findings, Schachter and Singer assess that an event happens which in turn elicits as physiological arousal. From the reasoning of the arousal, you are then able to have an emotion.&lt;ref name="21 March 2004" /&gt;  For example: You are about to give a speech. You approach the podium and look out into the audience as your mouth goes dry, your heart beat quickens, your palms sweat, and your legs begin to shake. From this arousal, you understand you feel this way because you are about to give a speech in front of 50 of your peers. This feeling causes anxiety and you experience the emotion of fear.

In a study aimed at defining stress and the role of coping, conducted by Dewe (1991),&lt;ref&gt;Dewe, P.J. (1991). Primary appraisal, secondary appraisal and coping: their role in stressful work encounters. Journal of Occupational Psychology, 64(4), 331-351.&lt;/ref&gt; significant relationships between primary appraisal, coping, and emotional discomfort were recorded. It was proven that primary appraisal was the main contributor of predicting how someone will cope. This finding enables psychologists to be able to begin to predict the emotion that will be elicited by a certain event and may give rise to an easier way to predict how well someone will cope with their emotion.

A study by Rogers &amp; Holmbeck (1997)&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, M. J., &amp; Holmbeck, G. N. (1997). "Effects of Interparental Aggression on Children's Adjustment: The Moderating Role of Cognitive Appraisal and Coping." Journal of Family Psychology. Vol. 11 (1), 125-130.&lt;/ref&gt; explores a previous finding that "the psychological impact of interparental conflict on children is influenced by children's cognitive appraisals."  The researchers hypothesized that cognitive appraisal and coping would help moderate variables for the children, and therefore the emotional impact of parent conflict would vary based on the nature of the child's "appraisals and coping strategies" (Rogers &amp; Holmbeck 1997). The researchers tested coping strategies and measured child adjustment based on the children's self-reported emotional and behavioral adjustment, determined from levels of self-worth and depression (Rogers &amp; Holmbeck 1997). The results demonstrated a significant negative main effect of problematic cognitive appraisal on self-worth and a significant positive main effect of problematic cognitive appraisal on depression, thus showing the impact of cognitive appraisal on children's emotional well being and ability to deal with interparental conflict (Rogers &amp; Holmbeck 1997).  This study demonstrates the significance of cognitive appraisal in coping with emotionally difficult circumstances and their own behavioral adjustment and self-esteem.  An understanding of the role of cognitive appraisal and cognitive appraisal theories can assist psychologists in understanding and facilitating coping strategies, which could contribute to work in the field that acts to facilitate healthy behavioral adjustment and coping strategies in individuals.

In another study conducted by Jacobucci (2000),&lt;ref&gt;Jacobucci, G.D. (2000). Primary appraisal as a function of attachment pattern, personality, and situational circumstances. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering, 60(7-B), 3609.&lt;/ref&gt; findings suggested that individual differences and primary appraisals had a very strong correlation. This shows that primary appraisal is a function of personality and may be stable over time.  This in fact is a very strong finding for social psychologists because it proves that if we can predict the primary appraisal strategy and thinking pattern of an individual, then coping patterns and emotional tendencies of an individual may be able to be predicted in any situation and social setting.

A study by Verduyn, Mechelen, &amp; Tuerlinckx (2011)&lt;ref&gt;Verduyn, P., Van Mechelen, I., &amp; Tuerlinckx. F. (2011). "The Relationship Between Event Processing and the Duration of Emotional Experience." Emotion. Vol. 11(1), 20-28.&lt;/ref&gt; explores the factors that affect the duration of an emotional experience.  One aspect of the research focuses on the difference between rumination versus reappraisal of an emotional event, exploring how they affect the duration of an emotional experience, and in which direction (shortening or lengthening) (Verduyn et al. 2011).  The researchers argue that cognition is very significant to the duration and experience of emotion, claiming that "thoughts appear to act as fuel that stirs up the emotional fire and leads to a prolongation of the episode" (Verduyn et al. 2011).  Further, the researchers reference the significance of emotions "lining up with" initial appraisals of the emotion-eliciting experience, which then strengthens the emotion and may lead to prolongation of the experience (Verduyn et al. 2011).  This concept alludes to the significance of congruence among emotions, appraisal, and cognitions.  This particular article discusses the coping effect of appraisal and reappraisal, claiming reappraisal can act as an "adaptive strategy," while rumination is not (Verduyn et al. 2011).   Both reappraisal (or initial cognitive appraisal) and rumination, however, can affect the duration of an emotional experience.  This study demonstrates the significance of cognitive appraisal by indicating its role in the duration of an emotional experience. Because the duration of an emotional experience can have significant effects on how an individual reacts to given stimuli, and thus have relevant real-world application in how individuals deal with emotional experiences.  This study also presents reappraisal—appraising the emotional situation in a new way—can act as an adaptive strategy to deal  with difficult circumstances, thus further highlighting the necessity of cognitive appraisal to coping with emotional stressors.

One study completed by Folkman et al. (1986) focuses on the relationship between appraisal and coping processes that are used across stressful events, and indicators of long-term adaptation.  They define primary appraisal as "the stakes a person has in a stressful encounter," and secondary appraisal as "options for coping."  Eighty-five California married couples with at least one child were the participants of the study, and they were interviewed in their homes once a month for 6 months.  In each interview the subject was asked what their most stressful event was in the previous week, and then interviewer asked them structured questions about how they dealt with that stressor.  There was a significant gender difference in primary appraisal.  They also concluded that coping strategies were dependent upon psychological and somatic problems as well (Folkman, Lazarus, Gruen &amp; DeLongis, 1986).&lt;ref&gt;Folkman, S., Lazarus, R. S., Gruen, R. J., &amp; DeLongis, A. (1986). Appraisal, Health Status and Psychological Symptoms. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 50(3), 571-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study by Folkman the goal was to look at the relationship between cognitive appraisal and coping processes and their short-term outcomes within stressful situations.  Subjects were interviewed once a month for six months.  Primary and secondary appraisals were assessed using different subscales.  This study found that there is a functional relationship among appraisal and coping and the outcomes of stressful situations.  There were significant positive correlations between primary appraisal and coping.  There were also significant correlations between secondary appraisal and coping, and they were very specific about the type of stressful situation and with which each would help the most.  For example, they found that appraisals of changeability and having to hold back from acting were related to the encounter outcomes (Folkman, Lazarus, Dunkel-Schetter, DeLongis &amp; Gruen, 1986).&lt;ref&gt;Folkman, S., Lazarus, R.S., Dunkel-Schetter, C., DeLongis, A. &amp; Gruen, R.J. (1986). Dynamics of a Stressful Encounter: Cognitive Appraisal, Coping, and Encounter Outcomes. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 50(5), 992-1003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== More appraisal theories of emotion ==

Many current theories of emotion now place the appraisal component of emotion at the forefront in defining and studying emotional experience. However, most contemporary [[psychologists]] who study emotion accept a working definition acknowledging that emotion is not just appraisal but a complex multifaceted experience with the following components{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}:

#  Subjective feelings. The appraisal is accompanied by feelings that are good or bad, pleasant or unpleasant, calm or aroused.
# Physiological arousal. Emotions are accompanied by autonomic nervous system activity. [[Arousal]] is defined as "to rouse or stimulate to action or to physiological readiness for activity" (Merriam-Webster, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster Online. (2007). Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary: Arousal. In Merriam-Webster [Web]. Retrieved April 20, 2008, from http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/arousal&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schachter and Singer (1962)&lt;ref&gt;4&lt;/ref&gt; we can have arousal without [[emotion]], but we cannot have an emotion without arousal. Essentially, humans injected with [[epinephrine]] without knowing the actual content of the injection, feel an increase in heart rate, sweating, and [[Anxiety|nervousness]], but that doesn't elicit an affective response. When the same [[physiological]] responses are paired with a contextual pretext, winning the lottery, for example, the state of arousal is appraised to mean extreme excitement, joy, and happiness. Without a context, we feel aroused, but cannot label it as an emotional response to a stimulus. If a context is present, we can evaluate our arousal in terms of that context, and thus an emotional response is present.
# Expressive behaviors. Emotion is communicated through facial and bodily expressions, postural and voice changes.

An '''astro-comb''' is a type of [[frequency comb]] which increases the resolution of previous [[spectrograph]]s by nearly a hundredfold, allowing it to be used as an observational tool in [[astronomy]] and detect redshift wobbles caused by smaller [[exoplanet]]s than what was detectable with traditional calibrators.  Existing frequency combs were too precise to be useful for astronomy, with "teeth" too close together. In other words, the repetition rate or the frequency spacing between the comb lines was much smaller (&lt;1 [[gigahertz]]) than that required for astronomical applications (~tens of gigahertz or more). A "green astro-comb" was installed in January 2013 in the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher in the Northern hemisphere ([[HARPS-N]]) spectrograph at the [[Telescopio Nazionale Galileo]] on the [[Canary Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spie.org/newsroom/5730-a-green-astro-comb-to-search-for-earth-like-exoplanets#B1|title=A green astro-comb to search for Earth-like exoplanets|last=|first=|date=|website=spie.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device was developed by a team led by Chih-Hao Li of [[Harvard University]].

The astro-comb uses a [[pulsed laser]] to filter starlight before feeding the signal into a spectrograph. It has the potential to revolutionise astrophysical spectroscopy and discover other Earth-like planets outside our solar system. Currently, it is gathering data from Venus to demonstrate its ability to discover exoplanets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tng.iac.es/news/2015/07/28/tng-harps-astrocomb/|title=TNG :: TNG, HARPS-N and Astro Comb ready to characterize the first earth twin|website=www.tng.iac.es|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chicago principles''' are a set of guiding principles intended to demonstrate a commitment to [[freedom of speech]] and freedom of expression on college campuses in the United States. Initially adopted by the [[University of Chicago]] following a report issued by a designated Committee on Freedom of Expression in 2014 (''″Report of the Committee on Freedom of Expression″'')&lt;ref name="FOECReport_2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://provost.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/documents/reports/FOECommitteeReport.pdf|title=Report of the Committee on Freedom of Expression|last1=Zimmer|first1=Robert J.|last2=Isaacs|first2=Eric D.|website=uchicago.edu|publisher=ommittee on Freedom of Expression at the University of Chicago|accessdate=31 July 2018|last3=(et al.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;, they came to be known as the “Chicago principles” after other universities across the country committed to the principles or modelled their own based on similar goals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-purdue-chicago-principles-free-speech-20150523-story.html|title=Purdue adopts 'Chicago principles' to protect free speech|last=|first=|date=3 May 2015|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2017-03-29|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since 2014, several other universities have committed to the principles, including [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and [[Purdue University|Purdue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mag.uchicago.edu/university-news/opening-inquiry|title=Opening inquiry {{!}} The University of Chicago Magazine|website=mag.uchicago.edu|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/15/purdue-free-speech-chicago-principles_n_7278716.html|title=Purdue Takes A Stand For Free Speech, No Matter How Offensive Or Unwise|last=Kingkade|first=Tyler|date=2015-05-15|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-03-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of September 2018, the [[Foundation for Individual Rights in Education]] reported that 45 American colleges and universities had "adopted or endorsed the Chicago Statement or a substantially similar statement."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefire.org/chicago-statement-university-and-faculty-body-support/|title=Chicago Statement: University and Faculty Body Support|website=www.thefire.org|date=2018-08-31|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context and formulation ==
In July 2014, the University of Chicago formed the ‘University of Chicago's Committee on Freedom of Expression’ after a series of incidents where students at various schools sought to prevent controversial commencement speakers that year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The committee returned a report which re-emphasized the school’s commitment to principles of free expression as “an essential element of the University’s culture.” The University's commitment to free speech gained national media attention in August 2016, when Dean of Students John Ellison sent a letter to the incoming freshman class of 2020 affirming the free speech principles and stating that the University did not support the use of [[trigger warnings]] or [[safe spaces]]. 

In adopting the principles, Purdue president, [[Mitch Daniels]] later said “we didn’t see how we could improve on the language.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Children of the revolution''' is a [[concept]] associated with the generation growing up after revolutionary activity. It refers to the first [[generation]] of persons born after a [[revolution]]. The children of the revolution are a [[blank slate]] on which the [[Norm (sociology)|values]] of the revolution are [[Biopower|imposed]]. Because the generation have no shared memory of the prior world they cannot compare the new system with the old and will uncritically accept the new system as the natural order.

The phrase usually refers to political revolutions,&lt;ref&gt;e.g.: Kozal, J. 1978. ''Children of the Revolution'', Delacorte Press.&lt;/ref&gt; but is also applied to revolutions in [[culture]], [[science]], or [[art]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53583">'''Compliance gaining''' is a term used in the [[social sciences]] that encompasses the intentional act of altering another's behavior. Research in this area originated in the field of [[social psychology]], but communication scholars have also provided ample research in compliance gaining. While [[persuasion]] focuses on attitudes and beliefs, compliance gaining focuses on behavior.

==Overview==
Compliance gaining occurs whenever a person intentionally induces another person to do something that they might have not done otherwise.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=S.R.|title=Introductions to the special issue on seeking and resisting compliance: the  vitality of compliance-gaining research.|journal=Communication Studies|date=1998|volume=49|issue=4|pages=273–275|doi=10.1080/10510979809368537}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compliance gaining and persuasion are related; however, they are not one and the same. Changes in attitudes and beliefs are often the goal in persuasion; compliance gaining seeks to change the behavior of a target. It is not necessary to change a person's attitude or beliefs to gain compliance. For instance, an automobile driver might have positive attitudes towards driving fast. The threat of a speeding ticket from a police officer positioned in a speed trap may gain compliance from the driver. Conversely, persuading someone to change their attitude or belief will not necessarily gain compliance. A doctor might tell a patient that tobacco use poses a serious threat to a smoker's health. The patient may accept this as a fact and view smoking negatively, but might also continue to use tobacco.

==Developments==
Compliance gaining research has its roots in social psychology, but overlaps with many other disciplines such as communication and sociology. Compliance gaining can occur via mediated channels, but the research is most associated with interpersonal communication.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;  In 1967,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marwell|first1=G|last2=Schmitt|first2=D|title=Dimensions of compliance-gaining behavior: an empirical  analysis.|journal=Sociometry|volume=30|pages=350–364|doi=10.2307/2786181}}&lt;/ref&gt; sociologists Marwell and Schmitt attempted to explain how people select compliance gaining messages.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dillard|first1=J.P|last2=Burgoon|first2=M|title=Situational influences on the selection of compliance-gaining  messages: two tests of the predictive utility of the Cody-McLaughlin typology.|journal=Communication Monographs|date=1985|volume=52|pages=289–304|doi=10.1080/03637758509376113}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers posited that people have a mental bank of strategies that they draw from when selecting a message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boster|first1=F.J|last2=Shaw|first2=A.S|last3=Hughes|first3=M|last4=Kotowski|first4=M.R|last5=Strom|first5=R.E|last6=Deatrick|first6=L.M|title=Dump-and-chase: The effectiveness of persistence as a sequential request compliance-gaining strategy|journal=Communication Studies|date=2009|volume=60|issue=3|pages=219–234|doi=10.1080/10510970902955976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marwell and Schmitt created a typology for compliance gaining techniques: promise, threat, positive expertise, negative expertise, liking, pregiving, aversive stimulation, debt, moral appeal, positive self-feeling, negative self-feeling, positive altercasting, negative altertcasting, altruism, positive esteem, and negative esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marwell|first1=G|last2=Schmitt|first2=D.R|title=Dimensions of compliance-gaining behavior: an empirical  analysis|journal=Sociometry|date=1967|volume=30|pages=350–367|doi=10.2307/2786181}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study was the catalyst for more interest in compliance gaining from communication scholars.

Miller, Boster, Roloff, and Seibold (1977)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=G.R.|last2=Boster|first2=F|last3=Roloff|first3=M.E.|last4=Siebold|first4=D|title=Compliance‐gaining message  strategies: A typology and some findings concerning effects of situational differences.|journal=Communication Monographs|date=1977|volume=44|issue=1|pages=37–51|doi=10.1080/03637757709390113}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Cody and McLaughlin (1980)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cody|first1=M.J.|last2=Mclaughlin|first2=M.L|title=Perceptions of compliance-gaining situations: a  dimensional analysis.|journal=Communication Monographs|date=1980|volume=47|issue=2|pages=132–148|doi=10.1080/03637758009376026}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied the situational variables that influences compliance gaining strategies. The latter study identified six different typologies of situations that can influence compliance gaining behaviors: personal benefits (how much personal gain an actor can yield from the influencing behavior), dominance (the power relation between the actor and the target), rights (whether the actor has the right to expect compliance), resistance (how easy will the target be influenced), intimacy (whether the relation between actor and target is shallow), and consequences (what sort of effect this situation would have on the relationship between actor and target). Dillard and Burgoon (1985)&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; later investigated the Cody-McLaughlin typologies. They concluded that situational variables, as described by Cody and McLaughlin, did very little to predict compliance gaining strategy selection. As early as 1982, there was already strong criticism about the strength of the relationships between situational variables and compliance gaining message selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=S|last2=Backus|first2=D|title=Are compliance-gaining strategies dependent on situational  variables?|journal=Central States Speech Journal|date=1982|volume=33|pages=469–479|doi=10.1080/10510978209388453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1990s, many research efforts attempting to link compliance gaining strategy selection and features of a situation or features of the individual "failed to coalesce into a coherent body of knowledge".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schrader|first1=D.C.|last2=Dillard|first2=J.P.|title=Goal structures and interpersonal influence.|journal=Communication Studies|date=1998|volume=49|issue=4|page=134,1,89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Situational dimensions and individual differences were not effective in predicting so researchers went into other perspectives in an effort to understand compliance gaining.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; For instance, Schrader and Dillard (1998)&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; linked primary and secondary goals to compliance gaining strategy. Using the theoretical framework of Goals-Plans-Actions developed by Dillard in 1980, Schrader and Dillard operate from the assumption that individuals possess and act on multiple goals. In any compliance seeking situation, the actor has primary goals that drive the attempt to influence a target. The primary goal is what the interaction is all about. For instance, if an actor wants a target to stop smoking, this is the primary goal and this is what drives the interaction. However, in the course of pursuing that goal, there are "secondary" goals to consider. These are goals that limit the behavior of the actor. If getting a target to stop smoking is the primary goal, then a secondary goal might be to maintain a friendly relationship with the target. Dillard specifies five types of secondary goals that temper the compliance gaining behavior: identity goals (morals and personal standards), interaction goals (impression management), relational resource goals (relationship management), personal resource goals (material concerns of the actor), and arousal management goals (efforts to manage anxiety about the compliance gaining attempt).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Despite the charges of individual differences making very little progress in prediction compliance gaining strategies, some researchers in the 2000s have focused their efforts to rectify this weakness in the research to link individual differences with compliance gaining effectiveness. King (2001),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=P.E.|title=Automatic responses, target resistance, and the adaptation of compliance – seeking requests|journal=Communication Monographs|date=2001|volume=68|issue=4|pages=386–399|doi=10.1080/03637750128067}}&lt;/ref&gt; acknowledging the paucity of robust situational and trait studies linked to compliance gaining, attempted to isolate one situation as a predictor for compliance gaining message selection. King's research suggested that when target of compliance gaining were perceived to be less resistant to influence attempts, the actors used more compliance gaining tactics. When targets were perceived as strongly resistant, the actors used less tactics. Elias and Loomis (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elias|first1=S.M|last2=Loomis|first2=R.J|title=The effect of instructor gender and race/ethnicity on gaining  compliance in the classroom|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|date=2004|volume=34|issue=5|pages=937–958|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2004.tb02578.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that gender and race affect an instructor's ability to gain compliance in a college classroom. Punyanunt (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Punyanunt|first1=N.M.|title=The effects of humor on perceptions of compliance-gaining in the  college classroom|journal=Communication Research Reports|date=2000|volume=17|issue=1|pages=30–38|doi=10.1080/08824090009388748}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that using humor may enhance the effectiveness of pro-social compliance gaining techniques in the classroom. Remland and Jones (1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Remland|first1=M.S.|last2=Jones|first2=T.S|title=The influence of vocal intensity and touch on compliance  gaining|journal=Journal of Social Psychology|date=1994|volume=134|issue=1|page=89|doi=10.1080/00224545.1994.9710887}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that vocal intensity and touch also affect compliance gaining. Goei et al. (2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goei|first1=R|last2=Massi-Lindsey|first2=L.L|last3=Boster|first3=F.J|last4=Skalski|first4=P.D.|last5=Bowman|first5=J.m|title=The mediating  roles of liking and obligation on the relationship between favors and compliance|journal=Communication Research|date=2003|volume=30|issue=2|pages=178–197|doi=10.1177/0093650202250877}}&lt;/ref&gt; posited that "feelings of liking" between target and actor as well as doing favors for the target lead to liking and obligation, which leads to increased compliance. Pre-giving (giving a target a small gift or favor such as a free sample of food) is positively associated with increased compliance in strangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boster|first1=F.J|last2=Rodriguez|first2=J.I|last3=Cruz|first3=M.G.|last4=Marshal|first4=L|title=The relative effectiveness of a  direct request message and a pregiving message on friends and strangers|journal=Communication Research|date=1995|volume=22|issue=4|pages=475–484|doi=10.1177/009365095022004005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
One of the major criticisms of examining compliance gaining literature is that very little research studies actual compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grant|first1=J|last2=King|first2=P.E.|last3=Behnke|first3=R.R|title=ompliance gaining strategies, communication  satisfaction, and willingness to comply.|journal=Communication Reports|date=1994|volume=7|issue=2|pages=99–108|doi=10.1080/08934219409367592}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filling out a survey and reporting intent to comply with a request is certainly different than actually completing the request. For example, many people might report that they will comply with a doctor's order, but away from the doctor's office, they may ignore medical advice.

==Application==
Compliance gaining research has a fairly diverse background so much of the research uses alternate paradigms and perspectives. As mentioned above, the field of compliance gaining originated in social psychology, but was adopted by many communication scholars as well. Many fields from consumer psychology to primary education pedagogy have taken great interest in compliance gaining.

=== Medicine ===
Doctors have expressed much frustration with compliance resistance from their patients. A reported 50% of patients do not comply with medical advice and prescriptions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wrench|first1=J.S.|last2=Booth-Butterfield|first2=M|title=Increasing patient satisfaction and compliance: An  examination of physician humor orientation, compliance‐gaining strategies, and  perceived credibility.|journal=Communication Quarterly|date=2003|volume=51|issue=4|pages=482–503|doi=10.1080/01463370309370169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers, as well as medical professionals, have a vested interest in learning strategies that can increase compliance in their patients. Many severe and chronic conditions can be avoided if early treatments are followed as prescribed, avoiding death, permanent injury, and costlier medical treatments later on.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Researchers in communication have reported some key findings such as: clear and effective communication about a patient's condition or illness increases the likelihood of patient compliance with medical advice;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burgoon|first1=J.K|last2=Pfau|first2=M|last3=Parrott|first3=R|last4=Birk|first4=T|last5=Coke|first5=R|last6=Burgoon|first6=M|title=Relational  communication, satisfaction, compliance-gaining strategies, and compliance in  communication between physicians and patients.|journal=Communication Monographs|date=1987|volume=54|pages=307–324|doi=10.1080/03637758709390235}}&lt;/ref&gt; doctors that use humor in their communication with patients have higher satisfaction rates;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; high satisfaction rates with physicians is highly correlated with patient compliance.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lambert|first1=B.L|last2=Gillespie|first2=J.L|title=Patient perceptions of pharmacy students' hypertension  compliance-gaining messages: effects of message design logic and content themes.|journal=Health Communication|date=1994|volume=6|issue=4|pages=311–325|doi=10.1207/s15327027hc0604_6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pedagogy ===
For teachers, gaining compliance from students is a must for effective teaching. Studies in compliance gaining have ranged from elementary education &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marshall|first1=L.J.|last2=Levy|first2=V.M|title=The development of children's perceptions of obstacles in  compliance‐gaining interactions|journal=Communication Studies|date=1998|volume=49|issue=4|pages=342–357|doi=10.1080/10510979809368543}}&lt;/ref&gt; all the way to adult and higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Punyanunt|first1=N.M.|title=The effects of humor on perceptions of compliance-gaining in the  college classroom.|journal=Communication Research Reports|date=2000|volume=17|issue=1|pages=30–38|doi=10.1080/08824090009388748}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elias|first1=S.M.|last2=Loomis|first2=R.J.|title=The effect of instructor gender and race/ethnicity on gaining  compliance in the classroom|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|date=2004|volume=34|issue=5|pages=937–958|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2004.tb02578.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Golish|first1=T|title=Students' use of compliance gaining strategies with graduate teaching  assistants: examining the other end of the power spectrum|journal=Communication Quarterly|date=1999|volume=47|issue=1|pages=12–32|doi=10.1080/01463379909370121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sales and consumer psychology ===
Advertising and marketing are tools of persuasion. There is literally centuries' worth of literature available about persuasion. However, changing attitudes and beliefs about a product does not necessarily change behaviors. Purchasing a product is a behavior. Researchers such as Parrish-Sprowl, Carveth, &amp; Senk (1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parrish-Sprowl|first1=J|last2=Carveth|first2=R|last3=Senk|first3=M|title=The effect of compliance gaining strategy  choice and communicator style on sales success|journal=Journal of Business Communication|date=1994|volume=31|issue=4|pages=291–310|doi=10.1177/002194369403100404}}&lt;/ref&gt; have applied compliance gaining research to effective sales.

==Compliance==
Compliance gaining was not originally conceived in the field of communication but found its roots in the late 1960s as a result of studies and research by two sociologists, [[Gerald Marwell]] and [[David Schmitt]]. In 1967, Marwell and Schmitt produced some interesting compliance-gaining tactics concerning the act of getting a teenager to study. The tactics, sixteen in all, are as follows.

# '''Promise''': If you comply, I will reward you. For example, you offer to increase Dick's allowance if he studies more.
# '''Threat''': If you do not comply, I will punish you. For example, you threaten to forbid Dick to use the car if he doesn't start studying more.
# '''Expertise''' (positive): If you comply, you will be rewarded because of the "nature of things." For example, you tell Dick that if he gets good grades he be able to get into college and get a good job.
# '''Expertise''' (negative): If you do not comply, you will be punished because of the "nature of things." For example, you tell Dick that if he does not get good grades he will not be able to get into college or get a good job.
# '''Liking''': Act friendly and helpful to get the person in a "good frame of mind" so they comply with the request. For example, you try to be as friendly and pleasant as possible to put Dick in a good mood before asking him to study.
# '''Pre-giving''': Reward the person before requesting compliance. For example, raise Dick's allowance and tell him you now expect him to study.
# '''Aversive stimulation''': Continuously punish the person, making cessation contingent on compliance. For example, you tell Dick he may not use the car until he studies more.
# '''Debt''': You owe me compliance because of past favors. For example, you point out that you have sacrificed and saved to pay for Dick's education and that he owes it to you to get good enough grades to get into a good college.
# '''Moral appeal''': You are immoral if you do not comply. You tell Dick that it is morally wrong for anyone not to get as good grades as possible and that he should study more.
# '''Self-feeling''' (positive): You will feel better about yourself if you comply. For example, you tell Dick that he will feel proud if he gets himself to study more.
# '''Self-feeling''' (negative): You will feel worse about yourself if you do not comply. For example, you tell Dick that he will feel ashamed of himself if he gets bad grades.
# '''[[Altercasting]]''' (positive): A person with "good" qualities would comply. For example, you tell Dick that because he is a mature and intelligent person he naturally will want to study more and get good grades.
# '''[[Altercasting]]''' (negative): Only a person with "bad" qualities would not comply. For example, you tell Dick that he should study because only someone very childish does not study.
# '''Altruism''': I need your compliance very badly, so do it for me. For example, you tell Dick that you really want very badly for him to get into a good college and that you wish he would study more as a personal favor to you.
# '''Esteem''' (positive): People you value will think better of you if you comply. For example, you tell Dick that the whole family will be very proud of him if he gets good grades.
# '''Esteem''' (negative): People you value will think the worse of you if you do not comply. For example, you tell Dick that the whole family will be very disappointed in him if he gets poor grades.

In 1967, Marwell and Schmitt conducted [[Experiment|experimental research]], using the sixteen compliance gaining tactics and identified five basic compliance-gaining strategies: Rewarding activity, Punishing activity, Expertise, Activation of impersonal commitments, and Activation of personal commitments.

===Power===
Another element of compliance-gaining was produced in the early 1960s, as French and Raven were researching the concepts of power, legitimacy, and politeness. They identified five influential aspects associated with power, which help illustrate elements of the study of compliance. The fives [[Power (sociology)|bases of power]] are as follows:

# '''Reward Power''': A person with reward power has control over some valued resource (e.g., promotions and raises).
# '''Coercive Power''': A person with coercive power has the ability to inflict punishments (e.g., fire you).
# '''Expert Power''': Expert power is based on what a person knows (e.g., you may do what a doctor tells you to do because they know more about medicine than you do).
# '''Legitimate Power''': Legitimate power is based on formal rank or position (e.g., you obey someone's commands because they are the vice president in the company for which you work).
# '''Referent Power''': People have referent power when the person they are trying to influence wants to be like them (e.g., a mentor often has this type of power).

(French &amp; Raven, 1960)

==Techniques==
The study of compliance gaining has been central in the development of many commonly used or heard of techniques. The following techniques are a few of what has evolved as a product of the study of compliance gaining strategies. Note, many of these techniques have been empirically documented increasing compliance.

=== Foot-in-the-door (FITD) ===
{{Main article|Foot-in-the-door technique}}
With research starting in 1966 by Freedman &amp; Fraser, foot-in-the door is one of the earliest and most researched compliance gaining techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carpenter|first1=C|title=Making Compliance Seem More Important: The "Just-One-More"  Technique of Gaining Compliance|journal=Communication Research Reports|date=2014|volume=31|issue=2|pages=163–170|doi=10.1080/08824096.2014.907144}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique gains compliance by making a smaller easy  request then a larger more difficult request at a later time. The smaller request is usually one that would be widely accepted without scrutiny. The larger request is usually the actual the task or goal wanted to be completed.

==== Effectivity ====
Freedman and Fraser thought that after satisfying the smaller initial request, if the person was not forced to do then they must be "the type of person who fulfills such requests".&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dolinski|first1=D|title=The Nature of the First Small Request as a Decisive Factor in the  Effectiveness of the Foot-in-the-Door Technique|journal=Applied Psychology|date=2011|pages=437–453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The smaller task/request should relate to the larger request and not be trivial. For the foot-in-the-door technique to be successful it must generate the self-aware "I am the kind of person who fulfills this type of request" other wise known as the [[self-perception theory]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; Other studies found that if the initial request is easy but unusual or bizarre, it would also generate the foot-in-the-door effectiveness.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; This idea was developed further into the Disrupt-Then-Reframe technique.

There are other reasons besides the self-perception theory that makes the foot-in-the-door technique successful.

'''Consistency''' – Cialdini and Guadagno, Asher, and Demaine believe that what makes people want to fulfill larger request is the need to be consistent.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

'''The Norm to Help Others''' – Harris believed that after the first request, the norm to help others becomes clear. It only becomes evident after the person reviews his or her reason why they completed the original request.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

'''Satisfying the First Request''' – Crano and Sivacek thought what made the technique so effective was personal satisfaction. "The person learns that the fulfillment of request brings the reward of a positive experience. One may assume that the likelihood that satisfaction of this type appears willi increase if the person has to react to something unusual that awakens his or her mindfulness, and will decrease in situations in which the person reacts automatically and habitually".&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

=== Door-in-the-face (DITF) ===
{{Main article|Door-in-the-face technique}}
Door-in-the-face was first introduced in 1975 by Cialdini and colleagues. The opposite of foot-in-the-door, in the door-in-the-face technique, the requestor asks a large objectionable request which is denied by the target instead of gaining compliance by asking a smaller easy request. The requestor seeking compliance ask a smaller more reasonable request.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feeley|first1=T|last2=Anker|first2=A|last3=Aloe|first3=A|title=The Door-in-the-Face Persuasive Message Strategy: A  Meta-Analysis of the First 35 Years|journal=Communication Monographs|date=2012|volume=79|issue=3|pages=316–343|doi=10.1080/03637751.2012.697631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several theories that explain why door-in-the-face is an effective gaining compliance technique.

'''Self-presentation theory''' – "that individuals will comply with a second request due to fears one will be perceived negatively by rejecting successive prosocial request for compliance".&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;

'''Reciprocal concessions''' – this theory describes the effects of door-in-the-face as a "process of mutual concessions." "The second request represents a concession on the part of the sender (from his or her initial request), and compliance to the second request represents a concession on the part of the receiver (from his or her inclination to not comply with the first request)".&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;

'''Guilt''' – One reason that makes door-in-the-face such an effective technique is people feel guilty for refusing to comply with a request twice.&lt;ref&gt;(Carpenter, p 163)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social Responsibility''' – this theory describes the social repercussions and pressures that occur if an individual declines a request.

All together the theories propose that a target who declines the first request feel a "personal or social responsibility" to comply with the second request. In an effort to avoid feeling guilty or reduce the sense of obligation the target would have.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;

== Recent techniques ==

=== Disrupt-then-reframe (DTR) ===
DTR was first introduced by Barbara Price Davis and Eric S. Knowles in 1999. This technique states that a person will be more likely to comply with a request if the initial request or pitch is confusing. The pitch is immediately followed by a reframing or a reason to comply with the request.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carpenter|first1=C|last2=Boster|first2=F|title=A Meta-Analysis of the Effectiveness of the Disrupt-Then- Reframe Compliance Gaining Technique|journal=Communication Reports|date=2009|volume=22|issue=2|pages=55–62|doi=10.1080/08934210903092590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this technique is: A waiter states that "the steak dinner is on special for 800 pennies; it's a really good deal". Disrupting the couple by saying "800 pennies" instead of "8 dollars", the waiter is able to increase the likelihood that they will buy the steak dinner.

DTR was found to be a very effective way to gain compliance in non-profit instances such as raising money for charities or asking people to take a survey.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt; DTR was found to be less successful as a sales technique; this may be because the message is more scrutinized, making it harder to confuse the target.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;

=== Persistence ===
Persistence used as a compliance gaining technique, gets the target to comply by repeating the message. In 1979, Cacioppo and Petty found that repeating the message more than five times lead to decrease in compliance.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boster|first1=F.J.|last2=Shaw|first2=A.S|last3=Hughes|first3=M|last4=Kotowski|first4=M.R.|last5=Strom|first5=R.E.|last6=Deatrick|first6=L.M|title=Dump-and-chase: The effectiveness of persistence as a sequential request compliance-gaining strategy|journal=Communication Studies|date=2009|volume=60|issue=3|pages=219–234|doi=10.1080/10510970902955976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Success is enhanced if the repetition comes from more than one person and is enhanced further if the message has the same idea or meaning but is not exact.

An example of this technique would be: "My wife kept reminding me to take out the trash until I finally did it."

=== Dump and chase (DAC) ===
Persistence has a high probability of annoying the target and creating a negative interaction which could be viewed as "nagging".&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; A way to avoid this would be rejecting the targets objection to your request by asking "why not?", then forming another message to overcome the second objection to gain compliance. This technique is called dump and chase.

Mechanics of this technique are urgency and guilt. When the repeated message is presented to the target it may be perceived as urgent, thus making it seem more important, and more willing to comply. By creating a sense of obligation in the request, the target may develop guilt if not willing to comply.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;

=== Just-One-More (JOM) ===
Just-One-More was developed as a way to make a donation seem more important. The use of this technique involves using the language of "Just-One-More" to gain compliance.&lt;ref&gt;(Carpenter, p. 164)&lt;/ref&gt; The technique is found to most useful in instances regarding volunteering and donations. It is seen as "the last person to help will be more rewarding than being one of the first or those in the middle, due to the expectation that the requestor will appreciate the last person more than any of those who complied previously".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carpenter|first1=C|title=Making Compliance Seem More Important: The "Just-One-More"  Technique of Gaining Compliance.|journal=Communication Research Reports|date=2014|volume=31|issue=2|pages=163–170|doi=10.1080/08824096.2014.907144}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For Example: "Do you want to buy this car? I need just one more sale to reach my quota this month."

If the target finds that the requestor is lying or being deceptive about being the last one, it will create a negative outlook on the person and the organization that he or she represents.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Even though losing some of the effectiveness the requestor could state that they are "close to their goal" or "almost there".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

The '''Cuvier–Geoffroy debate''' of 1830 was a scientific debate between the two French naturalists [[Georges Cuvier]] and [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]].&lt;ref&gt;Racine, Valerie, "Essay: The Cuvier-Geoffroy Debate". Embryo Project Encyclopedia (2013-10-07). http://embryo.asu.edu/pages/essay-cuvier-geoffroy-debate {{ISSN|1940-5030}} http://embryo.asu.edu/handle/10776/6276&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; For around two months the debate occurred in front of the French Academy of Sciences. The debate centered primarily on animal structure; Cuvier asserted that animal structure was determined by an organism's functional needs while Geoffroy suggested an alternative theory that all animal structures were modified forms of one unified plan. In terms of scientific significance, the discussion between the two naturalists showed stark differences in scientific methods as well as general philosophy. Cuvier is generally considered the winner of the debate, as he always came better prepared to the debate with overwhelming amounts of evidence and more logical arguments, as well as having more political and academic influence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Despite this, Geoffroy's philosophy is seen as early support of [[evolution]] theory and parts of the theory of the "unity of composition" are generally more accepted over Cuvier's fixed species philosophy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Early lives ==
Both naturalists had a love for classification and description but grew up with different influences. Geoffroy came to Paris to study medicine, law and philosophy in early 1789, but shifted to the study of zoology not long after. When a priest mentor of Geoffroy's became caught up in the political turmoil of the revolution of 1789, it was through Geoffroy's testimony that the priest was released from prison. Making friends in the church led to his eventual appointment as a zoology professor in the [[Jardin du Roi|Royal Garden]] (later became the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|Museum of Natural History]]), when a post was vacated due to more political problems.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Finding Order in Nature|last=Farber|first=Paul Lawrence|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2000|isbn=0-8018-6389-9|location=Baltimore, Maryland|pages=37–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was only twenty-one years old at the time, this position gave Geoffroy access to resources and natural collections in which he built his future theories on nature. He was even able to accompany [[Napoleon]] on an expedition to Egypt in 1798 where he studied mummies and made hypotheses on change over time in humans and other organisms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Geoffroy agreed with Buffon that any classification system was arbitrary and thus somewhat empty, but he nonetheless attempted to find the general laws that applied to all organisms in nature.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Before their well-known rivalry developed, the two scientists began as close colleagues and friends. Cuvier met a member of the Academy of Sciences, [[Henri-Alexandre Tessier]], in Normandy in 1794 while he was a young man tutoring the children of the wealthy. Tessier was impressed by Cuvier's talent and skill, and soon after wrote glowing letters to established scientists like Geoffroy and another, Jussier. Geoffroy was charmed by Cuvier's detailed descriptions of animals and his precise sketches and decided to invite him to "come to Paris. Come play among us the role of another legislator of natural history."&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; When Cuvier joined him at the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|Museum]], other colleagues warned Geoffroy against mentoring him, suggesting that this brilliant young scientist would eventually surpass him.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Despite this premonition, both scientists worked side by side and wrote five papers together on the classification of mammals, the two-horned African rhinoceros, species of elephants, descriptions of the tarsier, and the biology of the orangutan. It was not long before Cuvier began to make a name for himself individually too, as he was highly skilled at reaching out to patrons, networking and acquiring funding for his research. By 1976{{what|date=January 2017}},&lt;!--year apparently incorrect--&gt; Cuvier was working on his papers on extinction, merely two years after joining the Museum, while Geoffroy had barely begun to publish. One of the most significant events that solidified the split between the two scientists was Cuvier's appointment to the [[French Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] on December 17, 1795 as one of the six original members of anatomy and zoology. Cuvier was only twenty-six years old (seventeen years Geoffroy's junior) and the youngest member at the time, while Geoffroy was not given admittance to the Academy for another twelve years.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Differing viewpoints ==
Prior to the debate, biological scientists were generally split into two major factions: whether animal structure was determined by functional needs of an animal or the "conditions of existence"&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Form and Function: A Contribution to the History of Animal Morphology|last=Russel|first=Edward Stewart|publisher=J. Murray|year=1916|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Cuvier), or a basic unified form that was modified across all animal forms (Geoffroy).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By determining the answer to this question, scientists could also shed light on the mechanisms of the evolution of species,&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cuvier-Geoffroy Debate: French Biology in the Decades before Darwin|last=Appel|first=Toby|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1987|isbn=0-19-504138-0|location=New York, New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as potentially finding a useful system to classify species to better understand the order of nature.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Cuvier was an influential scientist with significant political power and many prominent positions: permanent secretary at the French Academie of Science, a professorship at the Museum of Natural History and the College of France, as well as a Council member at the University of France. Cuvier stuck to "positive facts" of science and refused to flirt with hypotheses and unsupported ideas. This attitude sprang from worries that this kind of thinking would lead to unrest and disorder in France as the [[French Revolution]] had torn through only a few decades before.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Cuvier encouraged young scientists to stick with facts and often won them over easily due to his strong reputation as a good ally to have in science. His political ties and academic connections gave his ideas a broader audience and generally more historical recognition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Geoffroy was heavily influenced by Buffon and [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarck]]. It was in his memoir ''[[Philosophie anatomique]]'', published in 1818, that he first put his ideas on animal form and structure into print.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.amphilsoc.org/mole/view?docId=ead/Mss.B.G287p-ead.xml;query=;brand=default Étienne Geoffroy Saint Hilaire Collection 1811-1844]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Here he attempted to answer his own question, "Can the organization of vertebrated animals be referred to as one uniform type?"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;!-- is this a literal quote?--&gt; Cuvier on the other hand was known as Lamarck's greatest critic, as Cuvier felt Lamarck was too speculative without enough facts to back up his theories.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Cuvier grew up reading the works of [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] and was mostly self-taught through dissection and measurements of organisms.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Geoffroy thought of facts as building blocks to science while new ideas would lead to real discovery, occasionally dipping more into philosophical hypotheses instead of testable or demonstrated research.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Geoffroy kept his unpopular ideas under wraps when advantageous to his career but found it increasingly difficult to stay passive as he got older and more well known.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; He may even have welcomed the debate between himself and Cuvier as a chance to liven up the discussions in the Academy and generate new ideas.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

== The debate (1830) ==
While the two biologists had disagreed on animal structure subtly through their publications, talks with other scientists at Academy meetings, and in private, a paper on mollusks written by two relatively unknown scientists drew Geoffroy and Cuvier at arms. The paper, written by Meyranx and Laurencet, was assigned to Geoffroy and [[Pierre André Latreille]] to review and report to the Academy. Meyranx and Laurencet's conclusions grabbed Geoffroy's attention by suggesting a link between vertebrate and mollusk internal anatomy. With thousands of drawings of mollusks and multiple essays, the authors argued that the organ arrangement of a mollusk resembled vertebrate organ arrangement, if the vertebrate bent backwards so that the neck was connected to the backside.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Geoffroy found support for his unity of composition which would unite the vertebrates and mollusks -two of Cuvier's published embranchments of animals&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;- on one common plan.

=== Geoffroy's initial report ===
On February 15, 1830, Geoffroy presented his report to the Academy. In an epilogue that was eventually removed from the final report at Cuvier's insistence, Geoffroy made a clear attack at Cuvier by quoting from a work of Cuvier's from 1817, "Memoir on the Cephalopods and on Their Anatomy", though the author and actual manuscript name were not mentioned. Geoffroy ridiculed the old-fashioned way of describing nature by focusing on differences instead of similarities, presenting his unity of composition theory as a better alternative. Cuvier disagreed vehemently with the report and paper's findings, promising to further explain his argument in future writings.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Cuvier's first response ===
At the next meeting of the Academy on February 22, Cuvier came fully prepared with detailed, labeled, colorful drawings, in particular one of an octopus and another of a duck bent backwards, and a new memoir called "Considerations on the Mollusks and in Particular on the Cephalopods".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He attacked Geoffroy's argument carefully and strategically. First, he argued for clear definitions in science and no ambiguity in language. Cuvier then proposed that composition was defined as the arrangement of parts. By this definition, to imagine that all organisms consisted of the same organs arranged in the same manner was illogical and false. Cuvier called Geoffroy's unity of composition more of a vague analogy for the composition of animals than true science. He emphasized how analogies did not belong in real science. Next Cuvier gave his own report on Meyranx and Laurencet's paper, showing example after example of how vertebrate and mollusk organ arrangement differed, whether by physical location or orientation in the body. By overwhelming the audience with his plethora of knowledge on cephalopod anatomy, he undercut Geoffroy's credibility and made a convincing argument of his own. After this point the debate became less about the mollusk data and more an argument between two differing scientific philosophies.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Further discussion ===
On March 1, 1830, Geoffroy returned with his rebuttal, "On the Theory of Analogues, to Establish Its Novelty as a Doctrine, and Its Practical Utility as an Instrument". In response to Cuvier's comments about unity of composition being poorly defined, Geoffroy claimed that he was seeking more "philosophical resemblances" other than actual, observable similarities between animals. This vague explanation of unity of composition and the claim that others did not understand what unity of composition really meant did not satisfy Cuvier or his other critics. Geoffroy went on to defend his analogical theory, stressing the methodology of it all to align it to the scientific method. His theory looked at the connections between animals, and therefore was still applicable to making discoveries in science. To illustrate his points, Geoffroy used the example of the hyoid bone in vertebrates. He compared multiple animals with differing numbers of pieces making up the hyoid bone. In the cat with 9 hyoid pieces and humans with 5, Geoffroy made hypotheses for where the extra pieces had gone in humans,&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; suggesting shifts to the ligaments and other bones of the jaw. Cuvier in response compared the hyoid bones across multiple species, where he saw different numbers of parts, different arrangements of the parts and in some, no hyoid at all. To Cuvier these differences suggested different functional needs and did not support unity of composition as Geoffroy said. To counter Cuvier's very analytical approach, Geoffroy said his rival was simply getting too bogged down in the details and forgetting the main issue of differences in philosophy. Cuvier continued to supply examples of differences amongst animal form, insisting Geoffroy explain why nature would be constrained to using the same parts similarly across all species.

=== End of the debate ===
By April 1830, the Academy was getting bored of the debate. At this point it had become far too personal and less about the ideas discussed but rather an continuous opportunity to bash each other publicly and academically. Geoffroy finally declined to provide further comment on April 5, 1830.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; His reasons for ending the debate are not entirely known, though it is generally believed that Cuvier won the debate with his commanding presence and overwhelming amounts of evidence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Geoffroy may have ended the debate to save himself from more public annihilation via Cuvier,{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} but nonetheless promised to further publish the rest of his arguments later.

== Results of the debate ==
After Geoffroy's initial inflammatory report, some other scientists in the Academy felt pressed to choose a side. In an effort to protect his reputation, the co-author on the report, Latrielle, wrote to Cuvier to deny his participation in the report presented to the Academy, as well as to disassociate himself from Geoffroy's unity of composition theory.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; This was likely a strategical move{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} as Cuvier had just the year before helped Latrielle, a rather old man of sixty-seven, replace Lamarck as a professor in the Museum. Both authors of the original cephalopod paper wrote to Cuvier as well to apologize for the trouble their paper had caused. However, the damage on Meyranx and Laurencet's careers may already have been done, as no future works by the authors have been recorded, nor is their cephalopod paper to be found.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

After the debate officially ended, both naturalists continued to throw in snide mentions to each other's works in Academy discussion, though neither Geoffroy of Cuvier openly engaged each other again. The press and scientific journals followed their volatile disagreements up until Cuvier's death by cholera a mere two years after the debate. While the two naturalists were unable to reconcile their ideas in life, Geoffroy spoke at Cuvier's funeral quite fondly of his former friend, feeling pleased "to have been the first to recognize and reveal to the learned world the scope of genius who did not yet know it himself",&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; as well as saying anyone who studied the science of nature/natural history owed it to Cuvier for laying the foundation with his genius and massive knowledge of the natural world. While neither Geoffroy or Cuvier's ideas were fully adopted and the other{{clarify|date=April 2016}} ignored in future science theory, both unity of composition and functional morphology can be seen as influences to further works on the natural world. Geoffroy's ideas of unity of composition and development of more complex organisms from a common, less complex plan often recognize Geoffroy as one of the first to accept evolution theory.{{clarify|date=April 2016}}&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:AboriginalOchrePitCentralAustralia.JPG|thumb|A range of pigments were mined by [[Indigenous Australians]] at this Ochre Pit in central [[Australia]].]]
'''Earth pigments''' are naturally occurring [[mineral]]s containing metal oxides, principally [[iron oxide]]s and [[manganese oxide]]s, that have been used since prehistoric times as [[pigment]]s. The primary types are [[ochre]], [[sienna]] and [[umber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.thoughtco.com/ochre-the-oldest-known-natural-pigment-172032|title= Ochre - The Oldest Known Natural Pigment in the World|last= Hirst|first= Kris|website= thoughtco.com|publisher= ThoughtCo.|date= 15 April 2017|access-date= 31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth pigments are known for their fast drying time in [[oil painting]], relative inexpensiveness, and [[lightfastness]]. Cave paintings done in sienna still survive today.

==Production==
After mining, the mineral used for making a pigment is ground to a very fine powder (if not already in the form of clay), washed to remove water-soluble components, dried, and ground again to powder. For some pigments, notably sienna and umber, the color can be deepened by heating ([[calcination]]) in a process known as "burning", although it does not involve [[oxidation]] but instead [[dehydration]].

'''Eerik Kumari''' (7 March 1912 in [[Kirbla]], [[Lihula Parish]] – 8 January 1984; born as '''Erik Mathias Sits''') was a doctor of [[biology]], the founder of [[ornithology]] and nature [[Habitat conservation|conservation]] in [[Estonia]], the learned director of the Institute of Zoology and Botany at the [[Estonian Academy of Sciences]] during 1952-1977. He was the president of the [[Estonian Naturalists' Society]] in 1954–1964.

The [[Eerik Kumari Award]] was established in 1989 in his name to honor those who have excelled in bioscience in Estonia.

The '''Galilean moons''' are the four largest [[moons of Jupiter]]—[[Io (moon)|Io]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], and [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]]. They were first seen by [[Galileo Galilei]] in January 1610, and recognized by him as satellites of Jupiter in March 1610.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, Stillman (1978). Galileo At Work. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-16226-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They were the first objects found to orbit another planet. Their names derive from the lovers of [[Zeus]]. They are among [[List of moons by diameter|the largest objects]] in the [[Solar System]] with the exception of the [[Sun]] and the eight [[planet]]s, with a radius larger than any of the [[dwarf planet]]s. Ganymede is the largest moon in the Solar System, and is even bigger than the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], though only around half as massive. The three inner moons—Io, Europa, and Ganymede—are in a 4:2:1 [[orbital resonance]] with each other. Because of their much smaller size, and therefore weaker [[self-gravitation]], all of Jupiter's remaining moons have irregular forms rather than a spherical shape.

The Galilean moons were observed in either 1609 or 1610 when Galileo made improvements to his [[telescope]], which enabled him to observe celestial bodies more distinctly than ever.&lt;ref name=Galileo89/&gt; Galileo's observations showed the importance of the telescope as a tool for astronomers by proving that there were objects in space that cannot be seen by the naked eye. The discovery of celestial bodies orbiting something other than Earth dealt a serious blow to the then-accepted [[Geocentric model|Ptolemaic world system]], a geocentric theory in which everything orbits around Earth.

Galileo initially named his discovery the '''Cosmica Sidera''' ("[[Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo]]'s stars"), but the names that eventually prevailed were chosen by [[Simon Marius]]. Marius discovered the moons independently at the same time as Galileo, and gave them their present names, which were suggested by [[Johannes Kepler]], in his ''Mundus Jovialis'', published in 1614.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Discovery ===
[[Image:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Galileo Galilei]], the discoverer of the four moons]]

This allowed Galilei to observe in either December 1609 or January 1610 what came to be known as the Galilean moons.&lt;ref name=Galileo89&gt;Galilei, Galileo, ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]''. Translated and prefaced by Albert Van Helden. Chicago &amp; London: University of Chicago Press 1989, 14–16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Starry Messenger|last=Galilei|first=Galileo|date=1610|location=Venice|url=http://www.bard.edu/admission/forms/pdfs/galileo.pdf|quote=On the seventh day of January in this present date 1610....|isbn=0-374-37191-1|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207150253/http://www.bard.edu/admission/forms/pdfs/galileo.pdf|archivedate=2012-02-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 7, 1610, Galileo wrote a letter containing the first mention of Jupiter's moons. At the time, he saw only three of them, and he believed them to be fixed stars near Jupiter. He continued to observe these [[Celestial spheres|celestial orbs]] from January 8 to March 2, 1610. In these observations, he discovered a fourth body, and also observed that the four were not fixed stars, but rather were orbiting Jupiter.&lt;ref name=Galileo89/&gt;

Galileo's discovery proved the importance of the telescope as a tool for astronomers by showing that there were objects in space to be discovered that until then had remained unseen by the naked eye. More importantly, the discovery of celestial bodies orbiting something other than Earth dealt a blow to the then-accepted [[Geocentric model|Ptolemaic world system]], which held that Earth was at the center of the universe and all other celestial bodies revolved around it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/observations/jupiter_satellites.html|title=Satellites of Jupiter|accessdate=9 August 2007|work=The Galileo Project|publisher=[[Rice University]]|date=1995|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65CgxLekL?url=http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/observations/jupiter_satellites.html|archivedate=4 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galileo's ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'' (''Starry Messenger''), which announced celestial observations through his telescope, does not explicitly mention [[Copernican heliocentrism]], a theory that placed the [[Sun]] at the center of the universe. Nevertheless, Galileo accepted the Copernican theory.&lt;ref name=Galileo89/&gt;

A Chinese historian of astronomy, [[Xi Zezong]], has claimed that a "small reddish star" observed near Jupiter in 362 BCE by Chinese astronomer [[Gan De]] may have been [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], predating Galileo's discovery by around two millennia.&lt;ref&gt;Zezong, Xi, "The Discovery of Jupiter's Satellite Made by Gan De 2000 years Before Galileo", ''Chinese Physics'' 2 (3) (1982): 664–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dedication to the Medicis ===
[[File:Sidereus Nuncius Medicean Stars.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Medician stars in the ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'' (the 'starry messenger'), 1610. The moons are drawn in changing positions.]]
In 1605, Galileo had been employed as a mathematics tutor for [[Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo de' Medici]]. In 1609, Cosimo became Grand Duke Cosimo II of [[Tuscany]]. Galileo, seeking patronage from his now-wealthy former student and his powerful family, used the discovery of Jupiter's moons to gain it.&lt;ref name=Galileo89/&gt; On February 13, 1610, Galileo wrote to the Grand Duke's secretary:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"God graced me with being able, through such a singular sign, to reveal to my Lord my devotion and the desire I have that his glorious name live as equal among the stars, and since it is up to me, the first discoverer, to name these new planets, I wish, in imitation of the great sages who placed the most excellent heroes of that age among the stars, to inscribe these with the name of the Most Serene Grand Duke."&lt;ref name=Galileo89/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Galileo asked whether he should name the moons the "Cosmian Stars", after Cosimo alone, or the "Medician Stars", which would honor all four brothers in the Medici clan. The secretary replied that the latter name would be best.&lt;ref name=Galileo89/&gt;

On March 12, 1610, Galileo wrote his dedicatory letter to the Duke of Tuscany, and the next day sent a copy to the Grand Duke, hoping to obtain the Grand Duke's support as quickly as possible. On March 19, he sent the telescope he had used to first view Jupiter's moons to the Grand Duke, along with an official copy of ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'' (''The Starry Messenger'') that, following the secretary's advice, named the four moons the Medician Stars.&lt;ref name=Galileo89/&gt; In his dedicatory introduction, Galileo wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Scarcely have the immortal graces of your soul begun to shine forth on earth than bright stars offer themselves in the heavens which, like tongues, will speak of and celebrate your most excellent virtues for all time. Behold, therefore, four stars reserved for your illustrious name ... which ... make their journeys and orbits with a marvelous speed around the star of Jupiter ... like children of the same family ... Indeed, it appears the Maker of the Stars himself, by clear arguments, admonished me to call these new planets by the illustrious name of Your Highness before all others.&lt;ref name=Galileo89/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Name ===
[[File:Apparatus to demonstrate the motion of Jupiter's satellites in Putnam Gallery, 2009-11-24.jpg|thumb|A ''Jovilabe'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://catalogue.museogalileo.it/object/Jovilabe.html | title=Jovilabe | publisher=[[Museo Galileo]] | accessdate=15 April 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150416155028/http://catalogue.museogalileo.it/object/Jovilabe.html | archivedate=16 April 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; an apparatus from the mid-18th century for demonstrating the orbits of Jupiter's satellites]]
Galileo initially called his discovery the '''Cosmica Sidera''' ("Cosimo's stars"), in honour of [[Cosimo II de' Medici]] (1590–1621).&lt;ref&gt;''[[wikt:Cosimo|Cosimo]]'' is the Italian form of the Greek name ''[[wikt:Cosmas|Cosmas]]'' itself deriving from ''[[wikt:κόσμος#Ancient Greek|cosmos]]'' (whence the [[Grammatical gender|neuter]] plural adjective ''cosmica''). ''Sidera'' is the plural form of the Latin noun ''[[wikt:sidus#Latin|sidus]]'' "star, constellation".&lt;/ref&gt; At Cosimo's suggestion, Galileo changed the name to '''Medicea Sidera''' ("the '''Medician stars'''"), honouring all four Medici brothers (Cosimo, Francesco, [[Carlo de' Medici (cardinal)|Carlo]], and Lorenzo). The discovery was announced in the ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'' ("Starry Messenger"), published in [[Venice]] in March 1610, less than two months after the first observations.

Other names put forward include:
* I. ''Principharus'' (for the "prince" of Tuscany), II. ''Victripharus'' (after [[Vittoria della Rovere]]), III. ''Cosmipharus'' (after [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo de' Medici]]) and IV. ''Fernipharus'' (after Duke [[Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando de' Medici]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Annuaire de l'Observatoire royal de Bruxelles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eF4LAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA263|year=1879|publisher=L'Académie royale des sciences, des lettres et des beaux-arts de Belgique|page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; – by [[Giovanni Battista Hodierna]], a disciple of Galileo and author of the first [[Ephemeris|ephemerides]] (''Medicaeorum Ephemerides'', 1656);
* ''Circulatores Jovis'', or ''Jovis Comites'' – by [[Johannes Hevelius]];
* ''Gardes'', or ''Satellites'' (from the Latin ''satelles, satellitis'', meaning "escorts") – by [[Jacques Ozanam]].

The names that eventually prevailed were chosen by [[Simon Marius]], who discovered the moons independently at the same time as Galileo: he named them at the suggestion of [[Johannes Kepler]] after lovers of the god Zeus (the Greek equivalent of Jupiter): ''[[Io (moon)|Io]]'', ''[[Europa (moon)|Europa]]'', ''[[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]'' and ''[[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]]'', in his ''Mundus Jovialis'', published in 1614.&lt;ref name="marazzini"/&gt;

Galileo steadfastly refused to use Marius' names and invented as a result the numbering scheme that is still used nowadays, in parallel with proper moon names. The numbers run from Jupiter outward, thus I, II, III and IV for Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto respectively.&lt;ref name="marazzini"/&gt; Galileo used this system in his notebooks but never actually published it. The numbered names (Jupiter ''x'') were used until the mid-20th century when other inner moons were discovered, and Marius' names became widely used.&lt;ref name="marazzini"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marazzini|first= C.|date=2005|title=The names of the satellites of Jupiter: from Galileo to Simon Marius|journal=Lettere Italiana|volume=57|issue= 3|pages=391–407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Determination of longitude ===
{{see also|History of longitude#Galileo.27s_proposal_.E2.80.94_Jovian_moons|l1=History of longitude}}
Galileo was able to develop a method of determining [[longitude]] based on the timing of the orbits of the Galilean moons.&lt;ref&gt;Howse, Derek.  ''Greenwich Time and the Discovery of the Longitude''.  Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1980, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The times of the eclipses of the moons could be precisely calculated in advance, and compared with local observations on land or on ship to determine the local time and hence longitude. The main problem with the technique was that it was difficult to observe the Galilean moons through a telescope on a moving ship; a problem that Galileo tried to solve with the invention of the [[celatone]]. The method was used by [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini|Cassini]] and [[Jean Picard|Picard]] to re-map [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Howse | first=Derek | title=Greenwich Time and the Longitude | publisher=Philip Wilson | year=1997 | pages=26, 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members ==
Some models predict that there may have been several generations of Galilean satellites in Jupiter's early history. Each generation of moons to have formed would have spiraled into Jupiter and been destroyed, due to tidal interactions with Jupiter's [[proto-satellite disk]], with new moons forming from the remaining debris. By the time the present generation formed, the gas in the proto-satellite disk had thinned out to the point that it no longer greatly interfered with the moons' orbits.&lt;ref name="arxiv0812"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newsci"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126984.300-cannibalistic-jupiter-ate-its-early-moons.html|title=Cannibalistic Jupiter ate its early moons|last=Chown|first=Marcus|date=7 March 2009|work=[[New Scientist]]|accessdate=18 March 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323013754/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126984.300-cannibalistic-jupiter-ate-its-early-moons.html|archivedate=23 March 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Io (Jupiter I) is the innermost of the four Galilean moons of Jupiter and, with a diameter of 3642&amp;nbsp;kilometers, the [[List of moons by diameter|fourth-largest moon]] in the Solar System.

Europa (Jupiter II), the second of the four Galilean moons, is the second closest to Jupiter and the smallest at 3121.6 kilometers in diameter, which is slightly smaller than the [[Moon]]. The name comes from a mythical [[Phoenicia]]n noblewoman, [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]], who was courted by [[Zeus]] and became the queen of [[Crete]], though the name did not become widely used until the mid-20th century.&lt;ref name="marazzini"/&gt;

The prominent markings that criss-cross the moon seem to be mainly [[albedo feature]]s, which emphasize low topography.

Also, volcanic water eruptions splitting the surface of Europa, and even geysers have been considered as a cause.

[[File:Valhalla crater on Callisto.jpg|thumb|left|Callisto's Valhalla impact crater as seen by Voyager]]
Callisto (Jupiter IV) is the fourth and last Galilean moon, and is the second largest of the four, and at 4820.6 kilometers in diameter, it is [[List of moons by diameter|the third largest moon]] in the Solar System, and barely smaller than Mercury, though only a third of the latter's mass. It is named after the Greek mythological nymph [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]], a lover of Zeus who was a daughter of the Arkadian King Lykaon and a hunting companion of the goddess Artemis. The moon does not form part of the [[orbital resonance]] that affects three inner Galilean satellites and thus does not experience appreciable [[tidal heating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/icar.2002.6939 |title=Numerical Simulations of the Orbits of the Galilean Satellites |journal=Icarus |volume=159 |issue=2 |pages=500–4 |year=2002 |last1=Musotto |first1=S |last2=Varadi |first2=Ferenc |last3=Moore |first3=William |last4=Schubert |first4=Gerald |bibcode=2002Icar..159..500M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Callisto is composed of approximately equal amounts of [[rock (geology)|rock]] and [[Volatiles|ices]], which makes it the least dense of the Galilean moons.

Fluctuations in the orbits of the moons indicate that their mean density decreases with distance from Jupiter. Callisto, the outermost and least dense of the four, has a density intermediate between ice and rock whereas Io, the innermost and densest moon, has a density intermediate between rock and iron. Callisto has an ancient, heavily cratered and unaltered ice surface and the way it rotates indicates that its density is equally distributed, suggesting that it has no rocky or metallic core but consists of a homogeneous mix of rock and ice. This may well have been the original structure of all the moons. The rotation of the three inner moons, in contrast, indicates differentiation of their interiors with denser matter at the core and lighter matter above. They also reveal significant alteration of the surface. Ganymede reveals past tectonic movement of the ice surface which required partial melting of subsurface layers. Europa reveals more dynamic and recent movement of this nature, suggesting a thinner ice crust. Finally, Io, the innermost moon, has a sulfur surface, active volcanism and no sign of ice. All this evidence suggests that the nearer a moon is to Jupiter the hotter its interior. The current model is that the moons experience tidal heating as a result of the gravitational field of Jupiter in inverse proportion to the square of their distance from the giant planet. In all but Callisto this will have melted the interior ice, allowing rock and iron to sink to the interior and water to cover the surface. In Ganymede a thick and solid ice crust then formed. In warmer Europa a thinner more easily broken crust formed. In Io the heating is so extreme that all the rock has melted and water has long ago boiled out into space.

==Origin and evolution==
[[File:Relative Masses of Jovian Satellites.png|thumb|right|300px|The relative masses of the Jovian moons. Those smaller than Europa are not visible at this scale, and combined would only be visible at 100× magnification.]]

Jupiter's regular satellites are believed to have formed from a circumplanetary disk, a ring of accreting gas and solid debris analogous to a [[protoplanetary disk]].&lt;ref name=Canup2009&gt;{{cite book |last=Canup |first=Robert M. |last2=Ward |first2=William R. |title=Europa |publisher=University of Arizona Press |date=2009 |chapter=Origin of Europa and the Galilean Satellites |chapterurl={{Google books|Jpcz2UoXejgC|page=59|plainurl=yes}} |pages=59–83 |isbn=978-0-8165-2844-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Alibert2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alibert|first=Y. |last2=Mousis|first2=O. |last3=Benz|first3=W. |title=Modeling the Jovian subnebula I. Thermodynamic conditions and migration of proto-satellites|date=2005|journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics|volume=439|issue=3|pages=1205–13|bibcode=2005A&amp;A...439.1205A|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20052841|arxiv = astro-ph/0505367 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be the remnants of a score of Galilean-mass satellites that formed early in Jupiter's history.&lt;ref name="newsci"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Canup2009/&gt;

Simulations suggest that, while the disk had a relatively high mass at any given moment, over time a substantial fraction (several tenths of a percent) of the mass of Jupiter captured from the Solar nebula was processed through it. However, the disk mass of only 2% that of Jupiter is required to explain the existing satellites.&lt;ref name=Canup2009/&gt; Thus there may have been several generations of Galilean-mass satellites in Jupiter's early history. Each generation of moons would have spiraled into Jupiter, due to drag from the disk, with new moons then forming from the new debris captured from the Solar nebula.&lt;ref name=Canup2009/&gt; By the time the present (possibly fifth) generation formed, the disk had thinned out to the point that it no longer greatly interfered with the moons' orbits.&lt;ref name="newsci"/&gt; The current Galilean moons were still affected, falling into and being partially protected by an [[orbital resonance]] which still exists for Io, Europa, and Ganymede. Ganymede's larger mass means that it would have migrated inward at a faster rate than Europa or Io.&lt;ref name=Canup2009/&gt;

==Visibility==
[[File:Thomas Bresson - Jupiter(2) (by).jpg|thumb|250px|Jupiter and its four Galilean moons as seen with an amateur telescope]]
[[File:Jupiter.mit.Io.Ganymed.Europa.Calisto.Vollmond.10.4.2017.jpg|thumb|Jupiter with the Galilean moons &amp;ndash; Io, Ganymede, Europa, and Callisto (near maximum [[elongation (astronomy)|elongation]]), respectively &amp;ndash; and the [[full moon|full]] [[Moon]] as seen around [[conjunction (astronomy)|conjunction]] on 10 April 2017]]

All four Galilean moons are bright enough to be viewed from Earth without a [[optical telescope|telescope]], if only they could appear farther away from Jupiter. (They are, however, easily distinguished with even low-powered [[binoculars]].) They have [[apparent magnitude]]s between 4.6 and 5.6 when Jupiter is in [[opposition (planets)|opposition]] with the Sun,&lt;ref name=jplfact&gt;{{cite web |last=Yeomans |first=Donald K. |date=2006-07-13 |title=Planetary Satellite Physical Parameters |publisher=JPL Solar System Dynamics |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?sat_phys_par |accessdate=2008-08-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5msK7adC4?url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?sat_phys_par |archivedate=2010-01-18 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are about one unit of magnitude dimmer when Jupiter is in [[conjunction (astronomy)|conjunction]]. The main difficulty in observing the moons from Earth is their proximity to Jupiter, since they are obscured by its brightness.&lt;ref&gt;Jupiter is about 750 times brighter than Ganymede and about 2000 times brighter than Callisto.&lt;br&gt;Ganymede: (5th root of 100)^(4.4 Ganymede [[apparent magnitude|APmag]] − (−2.8 Jup APmag)) = 758&lt;br&gt;Callisto: (5th root of 100)^(5.5 Callisto APmag − (−2.8 Jup APmag)) = 2089&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum [[angular distance|angular separations]] of the moons are between 2 and 10 [[minute and second of arc|arcminutes]] from Jupiter,&lt;ref&gt;Jupiter near [[apsis|perihelion]] 2010-Sep-19: 656.7 (Callisto angular separation arcsec) − 24.9 (jup angular [[radius]] arcsec) = 631 arcsec = 10 arcmin&lt;/ref&gt; which is close to the limit of human [[visual acuity]]. Ganymede and Callisto, at their maximum separation, are the likeliest targets for potential naked-eye observation.

Girl Develop It was started in 2010 by Vanessa Hurst and Sara Chipps&lt;ref name="Shattuck 2010"&gt;{{cite web |last= Shattuck |first= Justin |title= Herding Code 90: Sara Chipps on Girl Develop IT and Girls Developing Software |website= Herding Code |date= August 12, 2010 |url= http://herdingcode.com/herding-code-90-sara-chipps-on-girl-develop-it-and-girls-developing-software/ |accessdate= February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with their flagship location in [[New York City]].  GDI started with just one class that sold out in one day. Today more than 55,000 members have been helped.

'''Heron Island''' is a [[coral]] [[cay]] located near the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] in the southern [[Great Barrier Reef]], {{Convert|80|km|mi|abbr=off}} north-east of [[Gladstone, Queensland]], Australia, and {{Convert|460|km||abbr=on}} north-north-west of the state capital [[Brisbane]]. The island is situated on the [[leeward]] (western) side of Heron Reef, a fringing platform reef of significant [[biodiversity]], supporting around 900 of the 1,500 fish species and 72% of the coral species found on the Great Barrier Reef.&lt;ref name = hirs&gt;University of Queensland Centre for Marine Studies: [http://www.cms.uq.edu.au/hirs Island Research Station]. Retrieved 2006-JUL-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The island is about {{convert|800|m|ft|abbr=off}} long and {{convert|300|m}} at its widest, giving an area of approximately {{convert|16|ha|acre|abbr=off}}. The highest point, near the western tip, is {{convert|3.6|m|}} [[Metres above sea level|above sea level]]. A [[dune]] ridge along the southern shore rises some {{convert|3|m|spell=in}} above sea level, lower dunes on the north-eastern side are only about {{Convert|1|m||spell=in}} above the sea.&lt;ref name="fosbergetal1961"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=F.

==History==
[[File:Heron Island, Australia - Harbour and HIRS from helicopter.JPG|thumb|left|Harbour and Research Station from helicopter]]
Heron Island was discovered on 12 January 1843 by a [[Royal Navy]] expedition comprising the [[corvette]] {{HMS|Fly|1831|6}} and the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] ''Bramble''. The expedition, commanded by Captain [[Francis Price Blackwood|Francis Blackwood]], was engaged in surveying the eastern edge of the Great Barrier Reef to map out detailed plans for safe passages within the reef.&lt;ref name=NH&gt;[http://www.navyhistory.org.au/category/navy-day-by-day/1770-1849/] Naval Historical Society of Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

The island was named by [[Lieutenant#Lieutenant|Lieutenant]] [[Charles Bampfield Yule]], the commander of ''Bramble''.&lt;ref name=NH/&gt;

The island did not become inhabited until the early 20th century when a [[turtle]] [[Canning|cannery]] was established. The aim was to profit from the seasonal influx of green turtles, but the venture soon found it difficult to keep the business afloat. Other attempts at establishing [[Fishery|fisheries]] were abandoned.

In 1932 Captain Christian Poulsen, engaged in bringing fishing parties to the reef, realised the potential of the island as a tourist attraction. In 1936 he bought the lease of the island for £290. On 11 September 1943, the entire island was declared a [[National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=N. Coleman |year=1988 |title=Discover Heron Island |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heron Island Resort===
Heron Island Resort, operated by [[Delaware North|The Aldesta Group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delawarenorth.com.au|title=Food, Venue &amp; Hotel Management Company - Delaware North|work=delawarenorth.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; is located in the north-west corner of the island. The resort is a popular getaway for [[scuba diving]] and [[snorkelling]] and accommodates up to 200 guests and 100 staff members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heronisland.com/|title=Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef|publisher=Voyages Resort|accessdate=2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012 Heron Island Resort was featured in the BBC's nature TV series, [[Great Barrier Reef (2015 TV series)|''Great Barrier Reef'']].

===Heron Island Research Station===
The [[University of Queensland]] [[Heron Island Research Station]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uq.edu.au/heron-island-research-station/content/front-page&lt;/ref&gt; is situated in the island's south-west quarter. Established in the 1950s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = RESEARCH STATION ON HERON ISLAND|url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article79254916|newspaper = The Central Queensland Herald|date = 1955-09-29|access-date = 2015-12-22|pages = 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Great Barrier Reef Committee with the University of Queensland becoming a partner in its operations in 1970,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = History - Heron Island Research Station - The University of Queensland, Australia|url = https://www.uq.edu.au/heron-island-research-station/history|website = www.uq.edu.au|accessdate = 2015-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the facility is one of the world's principal [[coral reef]] research stations, with a wide variety of research undertaken on coral reef ecology.
Heron Island Research Station suffered a large fire on Friday, 30 March 2007. No one was injured.&lt;ref&gt;UQ News: [http://www.uq.edu.au/news/?article=11753 Update on Heron Island Research Station fire]. Version of 2007-MAR-30. Retrieved 2008-APR-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008 the new student accommodation, comprising 80 beds, was officially opened and used for the first time by Tropical Marine Network students [http://www.tmnonline.net/]. The teaching laboratories and new research building with 9 research labs, library, [[darkroom]], computer room and aquaria deck were officially reopened in February 2009.[http://cms.uq.edu.au/index.html?page=54940]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cms.uq.edu.au/index.html?page=54940|title=Heron Island Research Station |publisher=Centre for Marine Studies, UQ|accessdate=2008-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a state of the art climate change experimental facility was opened at the Research Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Conditioning Reefs for the Future|url = https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2010/12/conditioning-reefs-future|website = UQ News|accessdate = 2015-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Park===
The eastern half of the island is protected and forms part of the [[Capricornia Cays National Park]], with a permanent ranger's station onsite.

===Harbour===
There is a small man-made channel and wooden jetty on the western shore of the island, where the daily [[catamaran]] launch from Gladstone docks and supplies to the island are delivered. The rusted wreck of [[HMAS Protector (1884)|HMCS ''Protector'']] lies at the entrance to the channel, and was towed to there in 1945 to form a dive and snorkelling site.

===Utilities===
The island has no [[fresh water]] supply. A small [[desalination]] plant on the island uses [[reverse osmosis]] technology to supply water for human consumption. Similarly, two diesel generators (and some [[solar panel]]s) supply electricity to the island.

==Ecology==
Heron Island has notably rich [[soil]] for a tropical coral cay, particularly in the dense southern forest. This is due to the presence of tens of thousands of [[wedge-tailed shearwater]]s (''Ardenna pacifica'') during breeding season. These birds disturb the [[humus]] as they dig their nesting burrows, and thus prevent the formation of Jemo soil, a [[phosphate|phosphatic]] [[hardpan]] topped off by raw humus. The hardpan is formed by [[Leaching (pedology)|leaching]] of surface- or tree-nesting seabirds' [[guano]] in the absence of burrowing animals.&lt;ref name = "fosbergetal1961"/&gt;

===Flora===
[[File:Starr 990611-0869 Pisonia grandis.jpg|thumb|left|Flowers of ''[[Pisonia grandis]]'']]
[[File:Euphorbia cyathophora.jpg|thumb|right|[[Euphorbia heterophylla|Wild poinsettia]] (''[[Euphorbia cyathophora]]'') has become extensively naturalised on Heron Island.]]
Rich forests of ''[[Pisonia grandis]]'' dominate the centre and south of Heron Island. Towards the eastern and north-western ends, the forest is readily accessible, but its heart is a dense tangle, interrupted only by a few trails.&lt;ref name = "fosbergetal1961"/&gt;

Some trees in the heart of the forest grow to 10–11 m, but most are just 6–8 m high. The [[understory]] is largely absent here, formed only by scattered ''[[Celtis paniculata]]'', ''[[Ficus opposita]]'' and ''[[Pipturus argenteus]]'' with a height of 2–4 m; some ''Celtis'' also grow higher and emerge through the ''Pisonia'' [[canopy (forest)|canopy]]. Patches of [[shrub]]s – mainly ''[[Abutilon albescens]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wetlandinfo.des.qld.gov.au/wetlands/facts-maps/wildlife/?AreaID=tile-100k-heron-island&amp;Kingdom=plants|title=Plants of Heron Island 100K map tile|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Queensland Government|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- supposedly endemic to Indonesia --&gt;, with ''[[Melanthera biflora]]'' (probably var. ''canescens''), and the introduced wild poinsettia (''[[Euphorbia cyathophora]]'') – are found here and there. [[Herbaceous plant]]s are scarce here, mainly consisting of the grass ''[[Stenotaphrum micranthum]]''. The more open forest is composed of much the same plants, but the ''Pisonia'' does not predominate as much. A few ''[[Pandanus tectorius]]'' [[screwpine]]s are also found here, and the understory is far more prominent.&lt;ref name = "fosbergetal1961"/&gt;

North of the ''Pisonia'' forest, a band of open shrubland with some trees extends from the resort to the island's eastern tip. Octopus bush (''[[Heliotropium foertherianum]]'') and sea cabbage (''[[Scaevola taccada]]'') form the major bush cover, while ''Abutilon'' and ''Melanthera'' are the characteristic ground plants. The trees here are mainly ''Pandanus'', but also ''Celtis'', the [[Casuarinaceae|she-oak]] [[Casuarina equisetifolia|''Casuarina equisetifolia'' ssp. ''incana'']], ''Ficus'', bay cedar (''[[Suriana|Suriana maritima]]''). Herbs—mainly the [[Parasitism|parasitic]] [[vine]] ''[[Cassytha filiformis]]'' as well as [[Euphorbia tannensis|''Euphorbia tannensis'' ssp. ''eremophila'']] and grasses (mainly [[Pacific island thintail]], ''[[Lepturus repens]]'' var. ''subulatus'') are abundant.&lt;ref name = "fosbergetal1961"/&gt;

The eastern end is marked by a similar [[habitat]], with mainly ''Casuarina, Scaevola'' and ''Heliotropium''. This type of vegetation, with some ''Pandanus'' in between, extends along the southern and northern dune ridges. On the dune slopes, ''[[Boerhavia repens]]'', [[Commicarpus chinensis|''Commicarpus chinensis'' var. ''chinensis'']] (or ''[[Commicarpus australis]]''?), the [[searocket]] ''[[Cakile edentula]]'', yet another ''[[Euphorbia]]'' (probably ''[[Euphorbia sparrmanii]]''), and [[kuroiwa grass]] (''[[Thuarea involuta]]'') are common.&lt;ref name = "fosbergetal1961"/&gt;

[[File:Cordia subcordata, seeds, flower, leaves.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Cordia subcordata]]'' dominates the north-western forest but is rare elsewhere on the island.]]
East of the resort in the north-western part of Heron Island there is another type of forest, more open than the central wood. The main tree here is the [[Cordia|manjack]] ''[[Cordia subcordata]]'' of which few are found elsewhere on Heron Island; ''Pisonia'' trees are present but not dominant. The ''Abutilon''–''Euphorbia cyathophora''–''Melanthera'' scrub grows thick here. ''Scaevola'' and ''Heliotropium'' as well as patches of the [[Sporobolus|dropseed grass]] ''[[Sporobolus virginicus]]'' occur at this forest's edge.&lt;ref name = "fosbergetal1961"/&gt;

The [[sea turtle]] nesting area is further east, making up the central part of the northern shoreside. The animals' burrowing has prevented a proper forest from forming. Consequently, though the usual tree species are found in isolated individuals, the sand is overgrown with herbs and small shrubs, mainly ''Cakile'', ''Cassytha'', ''Euphorbia eremophila'', ''Lepturus'' and ''Melanthera''.&lt;ref name = "fosbergetal1961"/&gt;

Around the western end there is an abundance of plants introduced by the research and resort activity, some deliberately as [[ornamental plant|ornamentals]], others accidentally. Notable are ''Euphorbia cyathophora''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wetlandinfo.des.qld.gov.au/wetlands/facts-maps/wildlife/?AreaID=tile-100k-heron-island&amp;Kingdom=plants&amp;SpeciesFilter=Introduced|title=Introduced plants of Heron Island 100K map tile|last=|first=|date=|website=2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Helichrysum luteoalbum|Pseudognaphalium luteoalbum]]'', as well as [[papaya]] (''Carica papaya'')&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, [[Coconut|coconut palm]] (''Cocos nucifera'')&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, oleander (''[[Nerium]] oleander'') and temple tree (''[[Plumeria rubra]]'') which have been planted{{Verify source|date=April 2008}}&lt;!-- probably changed a lot since 1961 --&gt;.&lt;ref name = "fosbergetal1961"/&gt;

===Fauna===
[[File:Heron Island, Australia - Black Noddys in a tree.JPG|thumb|right|An octopus bush full of [[black noddy]] nests.]]

Heron Island is part of the Capricornia Cays [[Important Bird Area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birdata.com.au/iba.vm |title=IBA: Capricornia Cays |accessdate=2011-06-12 |work=Birdata |publisher=Birds Australia |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706102341/http://www.birdata.com.au/iba.vm |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The island's forest and surrounding dunes provide habitat for thousands of nesting [[seabird]]s, including the [[wedge-tailed shearwater]] (Ardenna pacifica) and the south-western [[black noddy]] (''Anous minutus minutus''), during the breeding season between October and April.&lt;ref name = "fosbergetal1961"/&gt; Over 70,000 white-capped noddies nest on the island during this period.

All-year resident and breeding on Heron Island are:
* [[Silver gull]] (''Larus novaehollandiae forsteri'')
* [[Pacific reef heron|Eastern reef egret]] (''Egretta s. sacra'')
* [[Buff-banded rail]] (''Gallirallus philippensis mellori'')
* [[Bar-shouldered dove]] (''Geopelia h. humeralis'')
* [[Sacred kingfisher]] (''Todiramphus s. sanctus'')
* [[Black-faced cuckooshrike]] (''Coracina n. novaehollandiae'')
* [[Capricorn silvereye]] (''Zosterops lateralis chlorocephalus'')

[[File:Heron Island, Australia - Eastern Reef Egret.JPG|thumb|left|An [[Pacific reef heron|eastern reef egret]] looking for noddy fledglings to eat. This is the namesake "heron" of Heron Island.]]
Though other [[heron]]s may occasionally visit the island, the only member of the Ardeidae which is a breeding resident is the eastern reef egret.&lt;ref name="AW2006"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Australian Wildlife |year=2006 |title=Birds of Heron Island Twitcher's List |url=http://www.australian-wildlife.com/Heron%20Twitchers%20List.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]&lt;!-- date is tentative - Wayback Machine does not list Heron Island content of australian-wildlife.com as of August 2006, and article on page does not mention fire in research station. Thus, date is most likely between September 2006 and March 2007. Photo of adult but no hatchling turtle suggests pre-2007 date --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; And even though the terms "heron" and "egret" are not scientific, the former is generally used to denote the large ''[[Ardea (genus)|Ardea]]'' whereas the smaller ''[[Egretta]]'' [[species]] are usually called "egrets". Insofar, the only "true" heron that could ever be found on Heron Island is the [[white-necked heron]] (''Ardea pacifica''), which is only seen every now and then as a rare vagrant.

At some time in the mid-20th century, a pair of [[white-bellied sea eagle]]s (''Haliaeetus leucogaster'') nested on Heron Island. However, these birds either died or moved elsewhere, and the species today only occurs as a non-breeding visitor, albeit not too rarely.&lt;ref name="fosbergetal1961"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AW2006"/&gt;

[[File:Baby Chelonia mydas 20060319.jpg|thumb|right|Heron Island is also famous for its [[green sea turtle]] nesting ground.]]
At least one species of [[rat]], probably the widespread [[polynesian rat]] (''Rattus exulans''), is found on the island.&lt;ref name = "fosbergetal1961"/&gt; Though even these small rats are known to harm island birds, this is insignificant on islands so close to a continent; while the rats probably feed on eggs and [[nestling]]s, they do not threaten the breeding bird populations as a whole.

Heron Island is also a major nesting site for [[Green sea turtle|green]] (''Chelonia mydas'') and Indopacific [[loggerhead sea turtle]]s (''Caretta caretta gigas''). Around 98% of all turtles that nest on the island are green turtles, and only 2% of them will be loggerheads. The Indopacific [[hawksbill sea turtle]] (''Eretmochelys imbricata bissa'') has been seen on the reef but apparently does not breed on the island.&lt;ref name = "fosbergetal1961"/&gt; Other [[Ocean|marine]] life includes the inhabitants of the coral reef, and around early October, [[cetacea]]ns (e.g. [[humpback whale]]s, ''Megaptera novaeangliae'') pass Heron Island on their migration to their summer quarters in [[subantarctic]] waters.

A notable and much-studied [[invertebrate]] of Heron Island is ''[[Clypeomorus batillariaeformis|Cerithium moniliferum]]'', a small marine [[snail]]. These animals will form large groups as the [[tide]] recedes. Feeding on beach rock at a specific height over the average low tide level, the snails slowly move about in their clusters, preserving the precious moisture that allows them to breathe overwater.&lt;ref name = "fosbergetal1961"/&gt;

Mosquitos and other biting insects are rare on the island. However, diseases such as avian malaria and avian pox, which are carried by biting mosquitoes have been found in low numbers in the island's silvereyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Nicholas J. Clark|author2=Robert D. Adlard|author3=Sonya M.

== Geology ==
Heron Reef is a lagoonal platform reef. It has developed in a high energy environment with high tidal flows promoting water turnover and unobstructed access to the ocean. The reef dates from the Holocene period but shows evidence of possible development in the Pleistocene period. Core analysis of the reef from 1937, demonstrated a thickness of at least 15m of stacked limestone, with an eastward sloping disconformity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jell|first=John S. and Webb, Gregory E.|date=2012|title=Geology of Heron Island and adjacent reefs, Great Barrier Reef, Australia|url=|journal=Episodes|volume=35|issue=1|pages=110–119|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Known shipwrecks on the reef ==
'''''Jane Lockhart''''' sank between 11 and the 17 of December 1868 on Lady Musgrave Island / Heron Island / Masthead Reef or One Tree Island. The vessel was a two-mast [[schooner]]. Departed from Sydney with general cargo for Broadsound; and ran aground on Lady Musgrave Is; maybe on Heron Is or One Tree Island or Masthead Reef Lost on a reef off Heron Island on the night of 17 December 1868. The crew took to the boat and safely reached the [[pilot station]] at Keppel Island.

Originally stated as on Lady Musgrave reef (most unlikely) later news reports claim wreck on Heron Island with some other reports mention the wreck on either One Tree Island or Mast Head.
The vessel was built in 1861 at [[Ulladulla, New South Wales]] and registered in Sydney with the Official number of 36858 and a Registered number of 9/1861.&lt;ref&gt;Australian shipwrecks Vol. 2 1851–1871 By Loney, J. K. (Jack Kenneth), 1925–1995. Sydney. Reed, 1980 910.4530994 LON&lt;/ref&gt;

From the original reports
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One of the boats dispatched to the wreck of the ''Jane Lockhart'', schooner, has returned with the sails and a portion of the running and standing gear. The vessel, it appears, did not strike on Bunker's Group, as reported by Captain Machen, but upon what is known as Heron Island, about ninety miles to the northward of Bunker's Group. When the boat reached the vessel she was settled in a hollow in one of the reefs, the outer formation of the hollow acting as a breakwater against the seas. One side of the vessel was quite visible, and the new [[copper sheathing]] appeared uninjured. Captain Norris, who went down in charge of the boat, unbent the sails, so that the position of the vessel might as much as possible remain unaltered; he left the yards and masts standing.&lt;ref&gt;The Brisbane Courier Saturday 2 January 1869 {{cite web |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/1314537 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and 6 months later it was reported as
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ''Rose'', schooner, has returned from the wreck of the ''Jane Lockhart'', on Masthead Reef, whither she went on June 15 Captain Dwyer informs us that the Jane Lockhart still lies in a very snug position, and he has no doubt but that himself, and Mr Norris, the purchaser of the wreck, will be able, ultimately, to raise the vessel and bring her safely to Rockhampton

Nearly the whole of the period that they were at the reef, very heavy weather prevailed, staving operations towards the recovery of the cargo, but luckily the strong SE winds lulled for about three days Captain Dwyer availed himself of the occasion, set to work, rigged up a staging between the masts of the ''Lockhart'', schooner, and by means of a rope and a South Sea Island diver, managed to bring up from eighty to ninety large iron pulley wheels, besides a quantity of machinery and sundries, comprising Ale, porter, liqueur brandy, cutlery, ironmongery, etc Unfortunately the ''Roses'' water ran out, much to the chagrin of the crew, who would have raised a great deal more, only having to run into port for supplies&lt;ref&gt;The Brisbane Courier Saturday 17 July 1869 {{cite web |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/1291089|title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The phenomenon of superconductivity was discovered by [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes|Kamerlingh Onnes]] in 1911, in metallic mercury below {{convert|4|K|°C}}. Ever since, researchers have attempted to observe superconductivity at increasing temperatures&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite video |people=Nisbett, Alec (Producer)|year=1988 |title=Superconductor: The race for the prize |medium=Television Episode}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the goal of finding a [[room-temperature superconductor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Mourachkine, A. |year=2004|title=Room-Temperature Superconductivity|journal=(Cambridge International Science Publishing, Cambridge|pages=cond–mat/0606187|arxiv=cond-mat/0606187|isbn=978-1-904602-27-9|bibcode=2006cond.mat..6187M}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1970s, superconductivity was observed in several metallic compounds (in particular Nb-based, such as [[Niobium–titanium|NbTi]], [[Niobium–tin|Nb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn]], and [[Nb3Ge|Nb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ge]]) at temperatures that were much higher than those for elemental metals and which could even exceed {{convert|20|K|C}}. In 1986, J. Georg Bednorz and K. Alex Müller, working at the [[IBM]] research lab near [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]] were exploring a new class of [[ceramic]]s for superconductivity. Bednorz encountered a [[barium]]-doped compound of [[lanthanum]] and copper oxide whose resistance dropped to zero at a temperature around {{convert|35|K|C}}.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; Their results were soon confirmed&lt;ref&gt;Stuart A Wolf &amp; Vladimir Z Kresin, Eds, Novel Superconductivity, Springer (October, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; by many groups, notably [[Chu Ching-wu|Paul Chu]] at the [[University of Houston]] and Shoji Tanaka at the [[University of Tokyo]].&lt;ref name=tanaka01&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tanaka|first=Shoji|title=High temperature superconductivity: History and Outlook|journal=JSAP International|year=2001|url=http://www.jsap.or.jp/jsapi/Pdf/Number04/PastPresentFuture.pdf|accessdate=2 March 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816203010/http://www.jsap.or.jp/jsapi/Pdf/Number04/PastPresentFuture.pdf|archivedate=16 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after, [[P. W. Anderson]], at [[Princeton University]] came up with the first theoretical description of these materials, using the [[resonating valence bond theory]],&lt;ref name=Anderson87&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Philip|title=The Resonating valence bond state in la-2CuO-4 and superconductivity|journal=Science|volume=235|pages=1196–1198|year=1987|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/235/4793/1196.abstract|bibcode=1987Sci...235.1196A|doi=10.1126/science.235.4793.1196|pmid=17818979|issue=4793|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924143610/http://www.sciencemag.org/content/235/4793/1196.abstract|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a full understanding of these materials is still developing today. These superconductors are now known to possess a ''d''-wave{{clarify|date=June 2014}} pair symmetry. The first proposal that high-temperature cuprate superconductivity involves ''d''-wave pairing was made in 1987 by Bickers, [[Douglas James Scalapino|Scalapino]] and Scalettar,&lt;ref name=bickers87&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bickers|first1=N.E.|last2=Scalapino|first2=D.

Until 2015 the superconductor with the highest transition temperature that had been confirmed by multiple independent research groups (a prerequisite to being called a discovery, verified by [[peer review]]) was mercury barium calcium copper oxide (HgBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) at around 133 K.&lt;ref name=Schi&gt;{{cite journal|title=Superconductivity in the Hg-Ba-Ca-Cu-O system|journal=Nature|volume=363|issue=6424|pages=56–58|year=1993|doi=10.1038/363056a0 |last1=Schilling|first1=A.|last2=Cantoni|first2=M.|last3=Guo|first3=J. D.|last4=Ott|first4=H. R.|bibcode=1993Natur.363...56S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After more than twenty years of intensive research, the origin of high-temperature superconductivity is still not clear, but it seems that instead of ''electron-[[phonon]]'' attraction mechanisms, as in conventional superconductivity, one is dealing with genuine ''electronic'' mechanisms (e.g. by antiferromagnetic correlations), and instead of conventional, purely [[atomic orbital|''s''-wave]] pairing, more exotic pairing symmetries are thought to be involved (''d''-wave in the case of the cuprates; primarily extended ''s''-wave, but occasionally ''d''-wave, in the case of the iron-based superconductors). In 2014, evidence showing that fractional particles can happen in quasi two-dimensional magnetic materials, was found by EPFL scientists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dalla Piazza |first1=B. |last2=Mourigal |first2=M. |last3=Christensen |first3=N.

==Crystal structures of high-temperature ceramic superconductors==
The structure of high-''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; copper oxide or cuprate superconductors are often closely related to [[perovskite (structure)|perovskite]] structure, and the structure of these compounds has been described as a distorted, [[oxygen deficient compound|oxygen deficient]] multi-layered perovskite structure. One of the properties of the crystal structure of oxide superconductors is an alternating multi-layer of CuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; planes with superconductivity taking place between these layers. The more layers of CuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the higher ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;. This structure causes a large anisotropy in normal conducting and superconducting properties, since electrical currents are carried by holes induced in the oxygen sites of the CuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sheets. The electrical conduction is highly anisotropic, with a much higher conductivity parallel to the CuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; plane than in the perpendicular direction. Generally, critical temperatures depend on the chemical compositions, cations substitutions and oxygen content. They can be classified as [[superstripes]]; i.e., particular realizations of superlattices at atomic limit made of superconducting atomic layers, wires, dots separated by spacer layers, that gives multiband and multigap superconductivity.

===YBaCuO superconductors===
[[File:ybco.jpg|thumb|YBCO unit cell]]
The first superconductor found with ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt; 77&amp;nbsp;K ([[liquid nitrogen]] boiling point) is yttrium barium copper oxide (YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7−x&lt;/sub&gt;); the proportions of the three different metals in the YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; superconductor are in the mole ratio of 1 to 2 to 3 for yttrium to barium to copper, respectively. Thus, this particular superconductor is often referred to as the 123 superconductor.

The unit cell of YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; consists of three pseudocubic elementary perovskite unit cells. Each perovskite unit cell contains a Y or Ba atom at the center: Ba in the bottom unit cell, Y in the middle one, and Ba in the top unit cell. Thus, Y and Ba are stacked in the sequence [Ba–Y–Ba] along the c-axis. All corner sites of the unit cell are occupied by Cu, which has two different coordinations, Cu(1) and Cu(2), with respect to oxygen. There are four possible crystallographic sites for oxygen: O(1), O(2), O(3) and O(4).&lt;ref&gt;

The tripling of the perovskite unit cell leads to nine oxygen atoms, whereas YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; has seven oxygen atoms and, therefore, is referred to as an oxygen-deficient perovskite structure. The structure has a stacking of different layers: (CuO)(BaO)(CuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(Y)(CuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(BaO)(CuO). One of the key feature of the unit cell of YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7−x&lt;/sub&gt; (YBCO) is the presence of two layers of CuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The role of the Y plane is to serve as a spacer between two CuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; planes. In YBCO, the Cu–O chains are known to play an important role for superconductivity. ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is maximal near 92 K when ''x''&amp;nbsp;≈ 0.15 and the structure is orthorhombic. Superconductivity disappears at ''x''&amp;nbsp;≈ 0.6, where the structural transformation of YBCO occurs from orthorhombic to tetragonal.&lt;ref name="Neeraj"&gt;

===Bi-, Tl- and Hg-based high-''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; superconductors===
The crystal structure of Bi-, Tl- and Hg-based high-''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; superconductors are very similar.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann, Allen M. and Yakhmi, J.V. eds. (1994) ''Thallium-Based High-Temperature Superconductors'', Marcel Dekker&lt;/ref&gt; Like YBCO, the perovskite-type feature and the presence of CuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layers also exist in these superconductors. However, unlike YBCO, Cu–O chains are not present in these superconductors. The YBCO superconductor has an orthorhombic structure, whereas the other high-''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; superconductors have a tetragonal structure.

The '''Bi–Sr–Ca–Cu–O''' system has three superconducting phases forming a homologous series as Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ca&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4+2''n''+''x''&lt;/sub&gt; (''n''=1, 2 and 3). These three phases are Bi-2201, Bi-2212 and Bi-2223, having transition temperatures of 20, 85 and 110&amp;nbsp;K, respectively, where the numbering system represent number of atoms for Bi, Sr, Ca and Cu respectively.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two phases have a tetragonal structure which consists of two sheared crystallographic unit cells. The unit cell of these phases has double Bi–O planes which are stacked in a way that the Bi atom of one plane sits below the oxygen atom of the next consecutive plane. The Ca atom forms a layer within the interior of the CuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layers in both Bi-2212 and Bi-2223; there is no Ca layer in the Bi-2201 phase. The three phases differ with each other in the number of CuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; planes; Bi-2201, Bi-2212 and Bi-2223 phases have one, two and three CuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; planes, respectively. The ''c'' axis lattice constants of these phases increases with the number of CuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; planes (see table below). The coordination of the Cu atom is different in the three phases. The Cu atom forms an octahedral coordination with respect to oxygen atoms in the 2201 phase, whereas in 2212, the Cu atom is surrounded by five oxygen atoms in a pyramidal arrangement. In the 2223 structure, Cu has two coordinations with respect to oxygen: one Cu atom is bonded with four oxygen atoms in square planar configuration and another Cu atom is coordinated with five oxygen atoms in a pyramidal arrangement.&lt;ref name="WR"&gt;

==Preparation of high-''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; superconductors==
The simplest method for preparing high-''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; superconductors is a solid-state thermochemical reaction involving mixing, [[calcination]] and [[sintering]]. The appropriate amounts of precursor powders, usually oxides and carbonates, are mixed thoroughly using a [[Ball mill]]. Solution chemistry processes such as [[coprecipitation]], [[freeze-drying]] and [[sol-gel]] methods are alternative ways for preparing a homogeneous mixture. These powders are [[Calcination|calcined]] in the temperature range from 800&amp;nbsp;°C to 950&amp;nbsp;°C for several hours. The powders are cooled, reground and calcined again. This process is repeated several times to get homogeneous material. The powders are subsequently compacted to pellets and sintered. The sintering environment such as temperature, annealing time, atmosphere and cooling rate play a very important role in getting good high-''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; superconducting materials. The YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7−''x''&lt;/sub&gt; compound is prepared by calcination and sintering of a homogeneous mixture of Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, BaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CuO in the appropriate atomic ratio. Calcination is done at 900–950&amp;nbsp;°C, whereas sintering is done at 950&amp;nbsp;°C in an oxygen atmosphere. The oxygen stoichiometry in this material is very crucial for obtaining a superconducting YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7−''x''&lt;/sub&gt; compound. At the time of sintering, the semiconducting tetragonal YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; compound is formed, which, on slow cooling in oxygen atmosphere, turns into superconducting YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7−''x''&lt;/sub&gt;. The uptake and loss of oxygen are reversible in YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7''−x''&lt;/sub&gt;. A fully oxygenated orthorhombic YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7−''x''&lt;/sub&gt; sample can be transformed into tetragonal YBa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; by heating in a vacuum at temperature above 700&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Neeraj"/&gt;

The preparation of Bi-, Tl- and Hg-based high-''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; superconductors is difficult compared to YBCO. Problems in these superconductors arise because of the existence of three or more phases having a similar layered structure. Thus, syntactic intergrowth and defects such as stacking faults occur during synthesis and it becomes difficult to isolate a single superconducting phase. For Bi–Sr–Ca–Cu–O, it is relatively simple to prepare the Bi-2212 (''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≈ 85&amp;nbsp;K) phase, whereas it is very difficult to prepare a single phase of Bi-2223 (''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≈ 110&amp;nbsp;K). The Bi-2212 phase appears only after few hours of sintering at 860–870&amp;nbsp;°C, but the larger fraction of the Bi-2223 phase is formed after a long reaction time of more than a week at 870&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="WR"/&gt; Although the substitution of Pb in the Bi–Sr–Ca–Cu–O compound has been found to promote the growth of the high-''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; phase,&lt;ref&gt;

"High-temperature" has two common definitions in the context of superconductivity:
# Above the temperature of 30&amp;nbsp;K that had historically been taken as the upper limit allowed by [[BCS theory]] (1957).{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} This is also above the 1973 record of 23&amp;nbsp;K that had lasted until copper-oxide materials were discovered in 1986.
# Having a transition temperature that is a larger fraction of the [[Fermi energy|Fermi temperature]] than for conventional superconductors such as elemental [[mercury (element)|mercury]] or [[lead]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} This definition encompasses a wider variety of [[unconventional superconductor]]s and is used in the context of theoretical models.

The label high-''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; may be reserved by some authors{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} for materials with critical temperature greater than the boiling point of [[liquid nitrogen]] (77&amp;nbsp;K or −196&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]]). However, a number of materials – including the original discovery and recently discovered pnictide superconductors – had critical temperatures below 77&amp;nbsp;K but are commonly referred to in publication as being in the high-''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; class.&lt;ref name=Norman2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norman|first=Michael R.|title=Trend: High-temperature superconductivity in the iron pnictides|journal=Physics|year=2008|volume=1|issue=21|pages=21|doi=10.1103/Physics.1.21|url=http://physics.aps.org/articles/v1/21|accessdate=30 March 2012|bibcode=2008PhyOJ...1...21N|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319194936/http://physics.aps.org/articles/v1/21|archivedate=19 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=devereaux-stanford&gt;{{cite web|title=High-Temperature Superconductivity: The Cuprates |url=http://www.stanford.edu/~tpd/research_hightc.html |website=Devereaux group |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=30 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615231514/http://www.stanford.edu/~tpd/research_hightc.html |archivedate=15 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technological applications could benefit from both the higher critical temperature being above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen and also the higher critical magnetic field (and critical current density) at which superconductivity is destroyed. In magnet applications, the high critical magnetic field may prove more valuable than the high ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; itself. Some cuprates have an upper critical field of about 100 tesla. However, cuprate materials are brittle ceramics which are expensive to manufacture and not easily turned into wires or other useful shapes. Also, high-temperature superconductors do not form large, continuous superconducting domains, but only clusters of microdomains within which superconductivity occurs. They are therefore unsuitable for applications requiring actual superconducted currents, such as magnets for [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|magnetic resonance]] spectrometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v6/n8/full/nphys1687.html|title=How grain boundaries limit supercurrents in high-temperature superconductors|first1=S.|last1=Graser|first2=P.

HTS are [[Type-II superconductor]]s, which allow [[magnetic field]]s to penetrate their interior in [[quantum|quantized]] units of flux, meaning that much higher magnetic fields are required to suppress superconductivity. The layered structure also gives a directional dependence to the magnetic field response.

[[Cuprate superconductor]]s are generally considered to be quasi-two-dimensional materials with their superconducting properties determined by electrons moving within weakly coupled copper-oxide (CuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) layers. Neighbouring layers containing ions such as [[lanthanum]], [[barium]], [[strontium]], or other atoms act to stabilize the structure and dope electrons or holes onto the copper-oxide layers. The undoped "parent" or "mother" compounds are [[Mott insulator]]s with long-range antiferromagnetic order at low enough temperature. Single [[Electronic band structure|band]] models are generally considered to be sufficient to describe the electronic properties.

The cuprate superconductors adopt a perovskite structure. The copper-oxide planes are [[checkerboard]] [[crystal structure|lattice]]s with squares of O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ions with a Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion at the centre of each square. The [[unit cell]] is rotated by 45° from these squares. Chemical formulae of superconducting materials generally contain fractional numbers to describe the doping required for superconductivity. There are several families of cuprate superconductors and they can be categorized by the elements they contain and the number of adjacent copper-oxide layers in each superconducting block. For example, YBCO and BSCCO can alternatively be referred to as Y123 and Bi2201/Bi2212/Bi2223 depending on the number of layers in each superconducting block (''n''). The superconducting transition temperature has been found to peak at an optimal doping value (''p''=0.16) and an optimal number of layers in each superconducting block, typically ''n''=3.

Possible mechanisms for superconductivity in the cuprates are still the subject of considerable debate and further research. Certain aspects common to all materials have been identified.&lt;ref name=Legg2006 /&gt; Similarities between the [[antiferromagnetic]] low-temperature state of the undoped materials and the superconducting state that emerges upon doping, primarily the ''d''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; orbital state of the Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, suggest that electron-electron interactions are more significant than electron-phonon interactions in cuprates – making the superconductivity unconventional. Recent work on the [[Fermi surface]] has shown that nesting occurs at four points in the antiferromagnetic [[Brillouin zone]] where spin waves exist and that the superconducting energy gap is larger at these points. The weak isotope effects observed for most cuprates contrast with conventional superconductors that are well described by BCS theory.

Similarities and differences in the properties of hole-doped and electron doped cuprates:
*Presence of a pseudogap phase up to at least optimal doping.
*Different trends in the Uemura plot&lt;!--{Uemura89}--&gt; relating transition temperature to the superfluid density. The inverse square of the [[London penetration depth]] appears to be proportional to the critical temperature for a large number of underdoped cuprate superconductors, but the constant of proportionality is different for hole- and electron-doped cuprates. The linear trend implies that the physics of these materials is strongly two-dimensional.&lt;!--{Uemura91}--&gt;
*Universal hourglass-shaped feature in the spin excitations of cuprates measured using inelastic neutron diffraction.
*[[Nernst effect]] evident in both the superconducting and pseudogap phases.

The electronic structure of superconducting cuprates is highly anisotropic (see the crystal structure of [[YBCO]] or [[BSCCO]]). Therefore, the [[Fermi surface]] of HTSC is very close to the Fermi surface of the doped CuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; plane (or multi-planes, in case of multi-layer cuprates) and can be presented on the 2D [[Reciprocal lattice|reciprocal space]] (or momentum space) of the CuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lattice. The typical Fermi surface within the first CuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[Brillouin zone]] is sketched in Fig. 1 (left). It can be derived from the [[Electronic band structure|band structure]] calculations or measured by angle resolved [[photoemission spectroscopy]] ([[ARPES]]). Fig. 1 (right) shows the Fermi surface of BSCCO measured by [[ARPES]]. In a wide range of charge carrier concentration (doping level), in which the hole-doped HTSC are superconducting, the Fermi surface is hole-like (''i.e.'' open, as shown in Fig. 1). This results in an inherent in-plane anisotropy of the electronic properties of HTSC.

Some [[organic superconductors]] and [[heavy fermion]] compounds are considered to be high-temperature superconductors because of their high ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; values relative to their Fermi energy, despite the ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; values being lower than for many conventional superconductors.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} This description may relate better to common aspects of the superconducting mechanism than the superconducting properties.

===Metallic hydrogen===
Theoretical work by [[Neil Ashcroft]] in 1968 predicted that solid [[metallic hydrogen]] at extremely high pressure should become superconducting at approximately room-temperature because of its extremely high [[speed of sound]] and expected strong [[coupling (physics)|coupling]] between the conduction electrons and the lattice [[vibrations]].&lt;ref name=Ashc1968&gt;

===Magnetic properties===
All known high-''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; superconductors are Type-II superconductors. In contrast to [[Type-I superconductor]]s, which expel all magnetic fields due to the [[Meissner effect]], Type-II superconductors allow magnetic fields to penetrate their interior in quantized units of flux, creating "holes" or "tubes" of [[electrical conduction#Metals|normal metal]]lic regions in the superconducting bulk called [[Quantum vortex|vortices]]. Consequently, high-''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; superconductors can sustain much higher magnetic fields.

The question of how superconductivity arises in high-temperature superconductors is one of the major unsolved problems of theoretical [[condensed matter physics]]. The mechanism that causes the electrons in these crystals to form pairs is not known.&lt;ref name=Legg2006 /&gt; Despite intensive research and many promising leads, an explanation has so far eluded scientists. One reason for this is that the materials in question are generally very complex, multi-layered crystals (for example, [[Bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide|BSCCO]]), making theoretical modelling difficult.  

Improving the quality and variety of samples also gives rise to considerable research, both with the aim of improved characterisation of the physical properties of existing compounds, and synthesizing new materials, often with the hope of increasing ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;. Technological research focuses on making HTS materials in sufficient quantities to make their use economically viable and optimizing their properties in relation to [[Technological applications of superconductivity|applications]].

==Possible mechanism==
There have been two representative theories for high-temperature or [[unconventional superconductivity]]. Firstly, '''weak coupling theory''' suggests superconductivity emerges from antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations in a doped system.&lt;ref name=Mont1992&gt;
{{cite journal
 |year=1992

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, the pairing wave function of the cuprate HTS should have a ''d''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry. Thus, determining whether the pairing wave function has ''d''-wave symmetry is essential to test the spin fluctuation mechanism. That is, if the HTS order parameter (pairing wave function) does not have ''d''-wave symmetry, then a pairing mechanism related to spin fluctuations can be ruled out. (Similar arguments can be made for iron-based superconductors but the different material properties allow a different pairing symmetry.) Secondly, there was the '''interlayer coupling model''', according to which a layered structure consisting of BCS-type (''s''-wave symmetry) superconductors can enhance the superconductivity by itself.&lt;ref name=Chak1993&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By introducing an additional tunnelling interaction between each layer, this model successfully explained the anisotropic symmetry of the order parameter as well as the emergence of the HTS. Thus, in order to solve this unsettled problem, there have been numerous experiments such as [[photoemission spectroscopy]], [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]], [[specific heat capacity|specific heat]] measurements, etc. Up to date the results were ambiguous, some reports supported the ''d'' symmetry for the HTS whereas others supported the ''s'' symmetry. This muddy situation possibly originated from the indirect nature of the experimental evidence, as well as experimental issues such as sample quality, impurity scattering, twinning, etc.

This summary makes an implicit assumption: superconductive properties can be treated by [[mean field theory]]. It also fails to mention that in addition to the superconductive gap, there is a second gap, the [[pseudogap]]. The cuprate layers are insulating, and the superconductors are doped with interlayer impurities to make them metallic. The superconductive transition temperature can be maximized by varying the [[dopant]] concentration. The simplest example is La(2)CuO(4), which consist of alternating CuO(2) and LaO layers which are insulating when pure. When 8% of the La is replaced by Sr, the latter act as [[dopants]], contributing holes to the CuO(2) layers, and making the sample metallic. The Sr impurities also act as electronic bridges, enabling interlayer coupling. With this realistic picture of the electronic and atomic structure of high temperature superconductors, one can show from thousands of experiments that the basic pairing interaction is still interaction with [[phonons]], just as in the old metallic superconductors with [[Cooper pairs]]. While the undoped materials are antiferromagnetic, even a few % impurity dopants introduce a smaller pseudogap in the CuO2 planes which is also caused by [[phonons]] (technically [[charge density waves]]). This gap decreases with increasing charge carriers, and as it nears the superconductive gap, the latter reaches its maximum. This picture has been extended to answer the most obvious question of high temperature superconductivity, why are the transition temperatures so high? The carriers follow zig-zag percolative paths, largely in metallic domains in the CuO(2) planes, until blocked by charge density wave [[domain walls]], where they use dopant bridges to cross over to a metallic domain of an adjacent CuO(2) plane. This model of [[self-organized]] networks of percolative paths describes all known maximum transition temperatures with no adjustable parameters. The transition temperature maxima are reached when the host lattice has weak bond-bending forces, which produce strong electron-phonon interactions at the interlayer dopants.&lt;ref name=pnas&gt;{{cite journal |last=Phillips |first=J. |date=2010 |title=Percolative theories of strongly disordered ceramic high-temperature superconductors |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=1307–10 |pmid=20080578 |pmc=2824359 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0913002107 |bibcode=2010PNAS..107.1307P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was expected that a half-integer flux, that is, a spontaneous magnetization could only occur for a junction of ''d'' symmetry superconductors. But, even if the junction experiment is the strongest method to determine the symmetry of the HTS order parameter, the results have been ambiguous. J. R. Kirtley and C. C. Tsuei thought that the ambiguous results came from the defects inside the HTS, so that they designed an experiment where both clean limit (no defects) and dirty limit (maximal defects) were considered simultaneously.&lt;ref name=Kirt1995&gt;

But, since YBCO is orthorhombic, it might inherently have an admixture of ''s'' symmetry. So, by tuning their technique further, they found that there was an admixture of ''s'' symmetry in YBCO within about 3%.&lt;ref name=Kirt2006&gt;

===Qualitative explanation of the spin-fluctuation mechanism===
{{main|Resonating valence bond theory}}
Despite all these years, the mechanism of high-''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; superconductivity is still highly controversial, mostly due to the lack of exact theoretical computations on such strongly interacting electron systems. However, most rigorous theoretical calculations, including phenomenological and diagrammatic approaches, converge on magnetic fluctuations as the pairing mechanism for these systems. The qualitative explanation is as follows:

In a superconductor, the flow of electrons cannot be resolved into individual electrons, but instead consists of many pairs of bound electrons, called Cooper pairs. In conventional superconductors, these pairs are formed when an electron moving through the material distorts the surrounding crystal lattice, which in turn attracts another electron and forms a bound pair. This is sometimes called the "water bed" effect. Each Cooper pair requires a certain minimum energy to be displaced, and if the thermal fluctuations in the crystal lattice are smaller than this energy the pair can flow without dissipating energy. This ability of the electrons to flow without resistance leads to superconductivity.

In a high-''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; superconductor, the mechanism is extremely similar to a conventional superconductor, except, in this case, phonons virtually play no role and their role is replaced by spin-density waves. Just as all known conventional superconductors are strong phonon systems, all known high-''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; superconductors are strong spin-density wave systems, within close vicinity of a magnetic transition to, for example, an antiferromagnet. When an electron moves in a high-''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; superconductor, its spin creates a spin-density wave around it. This spin-density wave in turn causes a nearby electron to fall into the spin depression created by the first electron (water-bed effect again). Hence, again, a Cooper pair is formed. When the system temperature is lowered, more spin density waves and Cooper pairs are created, eventually leading to superconductivity. Note that in high-''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; systems, as these systems are magnetic systems due to the Coulomb interaction, there is a strong Coulomb repulsion between electrons. This Coulomb repulsion prevents pairing of the Cooper pairs on the same lattice site. The pairing of the electrons occur at near-neighbor lattice sites as a result. This is the so-called ''d''-wave pairing, where the pairing state has a node (zero) at the origin.

This summary assumes superconductive properties can be treated by [[mean field theory]].  It also fails to mention that in addition to the superconductive gap, there is a second gap, the [[pseudogap]].  The cuprate layers are insulating, and the superconductors are doped with interlayer impurities to make them metallic.  The superconductive transition  temperature can be maximized by varying the [[dopant]] concentration.  The simplest example is La(2)CuO(4), which consist of alternating CuO(2) and LaO layers which are insulating when pure. When 8% of the La is replaced by Sr, the latter act as [[dopants]], contributing holes to the CuO(2) layers, and making the sample metallic. The Sr impurities also act as electronic bridges, enabling interlayer coupling.  With this realistic picture of the electronic and atomic structure of high temperature superconductors, one can show from thousands of experiments that the basic pairing interaction is still interaction with [[phonons]], just as in the old metallic superconductors with [[Cooper pairs]].  While the undoped materials are [[antiferromagnetic]], even a few % impurity [[dopants]] introduce a smaller [[pseudogap]] in the CuO2 planes which is also caused by [[phonons]] (technically [[charge density waves]]).  This gap decreases with increasing charge carriers, and as it nears the superconductive gap, the latter reaches its maximum. This picture has been extended to answer the most obvious question of high temperature superconductivity, why are the transition temperatures so high?  The carriers follow zig-zag percolative paths, largely in metallic domains in the CuO(2) planes, until blocked by [[charge density wave]] [[domain walls]], where they use dopant bridges to cross over to a metallic domain of an adjacent CuO(2) plane.  This model describes all known maximum transition temperatures with no adjustable parameters.  The maxima are reached when the host lattice has weak bond-bending forces.&lt;ref name=pnas /&gt;

An '''ichnotaxon''' (plural '''ichnotaxa''') is defined by the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] as "a [[taxon]] based on the fossilized work of an organism", that is, the non-human equivalent of an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]].

== Definition==
Ichnotaxa are names used to identify and distinguish [[morphology (biology)|morphologically]] distinctive [[trace fossil|ichnofossils]], more commonly known as trace fossils. They are assigned [[genus]] and [[species]] ranks by [[ichnologist]]s, much like organisms in [[Linnaean taxonomy]]. These are known as '''ichnogenera''' and '''ichnospecies''', respectively. "Ichnogenus" and "ichnospecies" are commonly abbreviated as "igen." and "isp.". The binomial names of ichnospecies and their genera are to be written in [[italics]].

Most researchers classify trace fossils only as far as the ichnogenus rank, based upon trace fossils that resemble each other in morphology but have subtle differences. Some authors have constructed detailed hierarchies up to ichnosuperclass, recognizing such fine detail as to identify ichnosuperorder and ichnoinfraclass, but such attempts are controversial.

==Etymology==
''Ichnotaxa'' comes from the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] ίχνος, ''ichnos'' meaning ''track'' and ταξις, ''taxis'' meaning ''ordering''.&lt;ref&gt;Definition of [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ichno 'ichno'] at [[dictionary.com]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming==
Due to the chaotic nature of trace fossil classification, several ichnogenera hold names normally affiliated with animal body fossils or plant fossils. For example, many ichnogenera are named with the suffix ''-phycus'' due to misidentification as algae.&lt;ref name="TreatiseSupp1"&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=9780813730271|title= Miscellanea: Supplement 1, Trace Fossils and Problematica | last1= Häntzschel | first1= Walter | editor1-last = Moore | editor1-first= Raymond C. | year=  1975  | publisher= Geological Society of America | series= Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Hitchcock]] was the first to use the now common ''-ichnus'' suffix in 1858, with ''[[Cochlichnus]]''.&lt;ref name="TreatiseSupp1" /&gt;

==History==
Due to trace fossils' history of being difficult to classify, there have been several attempts to enforce consistency in the naming of ichnotaxa.

In 1961, the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] ruled that most trace fossil taxa named after 1930 would be no longer available.&lt;ref name="Donovan"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Donovan|editor1-first=Stephen K.|title=The Palaeobiology of Trace Fossils|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0-471-94843-8|date=28 March 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''information broker''' or '''data broker''' collects information about individuals from [[public records]] and private sources including [[census]] and [[change of address]] records, [[motor vehicle]] and [[driving]] records, [[User-generated content|user-contributed material]] to [[social networking sites]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.propublica.org/article/yes-companies-are-harvesting-and-selling-your-social-media-profiles|title = Yes, Companies Are Harvesting – and Selling – Your Facebook Profile|last = Beckette|first = Lois|date = 9 November 2012|work = |accessdate = 17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[News story|media]] and court reports, [[voter registration]] lists, consumer purchase histories, [[Most wanted list|most-wanted]] lists and terrorist watch lists, [[payment card|bank card transaction records]], health care authorities, and [[Web browsing history|web browsing histories]].&lt;ref name="worldprivacyforum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldprivacyforum.org/2013/12/testimony-what-information-do-data-brokers-have-on-consumers/|title=Congressional Testimony: What Information Do Data Brokers Have on Consumers?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The data are [[Aggregate data|aggregated]] to create individual profiles, often made up of thousands of individual pieces of information such as a person's age, race, gender, height, weight, marital status, religious affiliation, political affiliation, occupation, household income, net worth, home ownership status, investment habits, product preferences and health-related interests. Brokers then sell the profiles to other organizations that use them mainly to target advertising and marketing towards specific groups, to verify a person's identity including for purposes of fraud detection, and to sell to individuals and organizations so they can research people for various reasons.&lt;ref name="Government of the United States"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/data-brokers-call-transparency-accountability-report-federal-trade-commission-may-2014/140527databrokerreport.pdf|title = DATA BROKERS: A Call for Transparency and Accountability|date = May 2014|accessdate = 13 August 2014|website = Federal Trade Commission|publisher = Government of the United States|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Data brokers also often sell the profiles to government agencies, such as the FBI, thus allowing law enforcement agencies to circumvent laws that protect privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Etzioni|first1=Amitai|title=Reining in Private Agents|journal=Minnesota Law Review|date=2016|volume=101|pages=279–331|ssrn=2869439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Beginning in the late twentieth century, technological developments such as the development of the [[internet]], increasing computer processing power and declining costs of [[Computer data storage|data storage]] made it much easier for companies to collect, analyze, store and transfer large amounts of data about individual people. This gave rise to the information broker or data broker industry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|first1 = |last1 = |first2 = |last2 = |first3 = |last3 = |first4 = |last4 = |title = Big data: seizing opportunities, preserving values|url = http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/big_data_privacy_report_may_1_2014.pdf|date = |publisher =Executive Office of the President |website = |accessdate = Aug 17, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610084800/https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/big_data_privacy_report_may_1_2014.pdf|archivedate=2014-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals generally cannot find out what data a broker holds on them, how a broker got it, or how it is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.privacyrights.org/online-info-broker-faq |title=Online Information Broker FAQ |work= Privacy Rights Clearinghouse |publisher=privacyrights.org |date=October 4, 2010 |accessdate=May 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some data brokers retain all information indefinitely.

Files on individuals are generally sold in lists; examples cited in testimony to the U.S. Congress include lists of rape victims, seniors with dementia, financially vulnerable people, people with HIV, and police officers (by home address).&lt;ref name="worldprivacyforum.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="commerce.senate.gov"/&gt; Less controversial are lists of rich people, doctors, or parents.

There are probably between 3500 and 4000 data broker companies, and about a third may provide opt-outs, with some charging over a thousand dollars for them.&lt;ref name="worldprivacyforum.org"/&gt;

Data brokers collect information concerning myriad topics, ranging from the daily communications of an individual to more specialized data such as product registrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Data Revolution|last=Kitchin|first=Rob|publisher=Sage Publications Ltd. (UK)|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brokers and datasets ==
Data brokers in the United States include [[Acxiom]]{{dn|date=November 2018}}, [[Experian]], [[Alliance Data#Epsilon|Epsilon]], [[CoreLogic]], [[Datalogix]], [[inome]], [[PeekYou]], [[Exactis]], and [[Recorded Future]].&lt;ref name="Government of the United States"/&gt;&lt;ref name="commerce.senate.gov"&gt;http://educationnewyork.com/files/rockefeller_databroker.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Acxiom claims to have files on 10% of the world's population,&lt;ref name="commerce.senate.gov"/&gt; with about 1500 pieces of information per consumer&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/technology/acxiom-the-quiet-giant-of-consumer-database-marketing.html&lt;/ref&gt; (quoted in [[Senate.gov]]).&lt;ref name="commerce.senate.gov"/&gt; In 2017, [[Cambridge Analytica]] claimed that it has psychological profiles of 220 million US citizens based on 5,000 separate data sets&lt;ref name="InkJun2017"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://series.fountainink.in/aadhaar-in-the-hand-of-spies |title=Aadhaar in the hand of spies Big Data, global surveillance state and the identity project |author=Govind Krishnan V. |date=3 June 2017 |accessdate=27 August 2017 |publisher=Fountain Ink Magazine |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826163725/https://series.fountainink.in/aadhaar-in-the-hand-of-spies/ |archivedate=26 August 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (another 2017 claim is 230 million Americans&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/data-war-whistleblower-christopher-wylie-faceook-nix-bannon-trump&lt;/ref&gt;).

==History==
Credit scores were first used in the 1950s, but did not become widely known or specifically regulated until the 1990s.&lt;ref name="worldprivacyforum.org"/&gt;

In 1977 [[Kelly Warnken]] published the first fee-based information directory, which continues to be published and has expanded to cover international concerns.

==Criticism==
A U.S. Senate Committee in 2013 published ''A Review of the Data Broker Industry: Collection, Use, and Sale of Consumer Data for Marketing Purposes''.&lt;ref name="commerce.senate.gov"/&gt; It states that "Today, a wide range of companies known as “data brokers” collect and maintain data on hundreds of millions of consumers, which they analyze, package, and sell generally without consumer permission or input." Their main findings were that:
*Data brokers collect a huge volume of detailed information on hundreds of millions of consumers.
*Data brokers sell products that identify financially vulnerable consumers.
*Data broker products provide information about consumer offline behavior to tailor online outreach by marketers.
*Data brokers operate behind a veil of secrecy.

The information produced by data brokers has been criticized for enabling discrimination in pricing, services and opportunities. For example, a May 2014 White House report found that web searches that included black-seeming first names such as Jermaine were more likely to result in ads being displayed that include the word "arrest," compared with web searches including white-seeming first names such as Geoffrey.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

An Online Information Broker FAQ&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.privacyrights.org/online-info-broker-faq|title=Online Information Broker FAQ|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is published by [[Privacy Rights Clearinghouse]] (PRC), a nonprofit consumer organization in the United States. PRC also maintains a list of information brokers (data brokers, with links to their privacy policies, terms of service, and opt-out privisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.privacyrights.org/online-information-brokers-list|title=- Privacy Rights Clearinghouse|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data brokers have also faced legal charges for security breaches due to poor data security practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2008/03/agency-announces-settlement-separate-actions-against-retailer-tjx|title=Agency Announces Settlement of Separate Actions Against Retailer TJX, and Data Brokers Reed Elsevier and Seisint for Failing to Provide Adequate Security for Consumers Data|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calls for regulation and legislation ==
A 2007 [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] study, after requesting and analyzing information-sharing practices at 86 companies, found many operating under an [[opt-out]] model that it described as inconsistent with consumer expectations, and recommended that the [[California State Legislature|California state legislature]] require companies to disclose their information-sharing policies using clear, unambiguous language, and consider creating a centralized, user-friendly method for consumers to opt out of information-sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|ssrn = 1137990|title = Consumer Information Sharing: Where the Sun Still Don't Shine|last = Hoofnagle, and Jennifer King|first = Chris Jay|date = 17 December 2007|journal = (working paper)|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = |archiveurl = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[Federal Trade Commission|U.S. Federal Trade Commission]] had recommended the U.S. Congress develop legislation enabling consumers to see the information that data brokers hold about them, a recommendation it renewed in subsequent reports in 2012 and 2014. In 2013, the U.S. Government Accountability Office also called for Congress to consider legislation.&lt;ref name="Government of the United States"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FTC"&gt;{{cite web|title=TC Recommends Congress Require the Data Broker Industry to be More Transparent and Give Consumers Greater Control Over Their Personal Information|url=http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2014/05/ftc-recommends-congress-require-data-broker-industry-be-more|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation attempts==
The [[Data Accountability and Trust Act]] contained a number of requirements for auditing and verification of accuracy of data held by information brokers, and additional measures in the case of a security breach. The bill also gave identified individuals the means and opportunity to review and correct the data held that related to them. It passed through the [[United States House of Representatives]] in the [[111th Congress]], but failed to pass the [[United States Senate]]. It was revived by the [[112th Congress]] in 2011 as H.R. 1707.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr1707 Data Accountability and Trust Act (2011; 112th Congress H.R. 1707)]. GovTrack.us. Retrieved on 2013-11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; but died after being referred to committee. The bill was first introduced by Rep. [[Bobby Rush]] [D-IL1] on Apr 30, 2009, H.R. 2221&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr2221 |title=Data Accountability and Trust Act (2009; 111th Congress H.R. 2221) |publisher= govtrack.us |accessdate=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiction==
In [[fiction]], information brokers usually find data for a story's main character(s). Fictional information brokers can be of varying importance and have varying methods. For example, a [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] can be an information broker, though they may be simply transferring whatever information they find to the main character(s). Other brokers may have [[memorize]]d data and tell the main character(s) [[covert]]ly. Also, a fee is not always involved. The information broker may have an alliance with the main character(s) or be one themselves.

Examples of information brokers in contemporary fiction would be [[Edward G. Robinson]]'s character Sol in the film ''[[Soylent Green]]''; the Shadow Broker in the video game series ''[[Mass Effect]]''; Nicholas Wayne, Rachel, Elean Duga, Gustav St. Germain, Carol, and the President of the Daily Days newspaper company in ''[[Baccano!]]''; or Izaya Orihara in the light novel series ''[[Durarara!!]]''. A few of the characters in [[Neil Stephenson]]'s novel [[Snow Crash]] find work selling data as "stringers" for the Central Intelligence Corporation. Information broker characters play a prominent role in stories published by [[DC Comics]]. The character trope is best exemplified by the superhero [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]], but the trope is later used with the characters [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]], [[Wendy and Marvin|Proxy]], [[Chloe Sullivan]], and [[Felicity Smoak]] as well.

The '''Kuala Lumpur Bar''' was established on 1 July 1992 at a general meeting of advocates &amp; solicitors practising in the Federal Territory of [[Kuala Lumpur]] held under section 68(4) of the Legal Profession Act 1976.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.klbar.org.my/index.php/frontend/page/abt&lt;/ref&gt;

Before that date, practitioners in Kuala Lumpur were members of the Selangor Bar, which was later called the Selangor &amp; Federal Territory Bar on Kuala Lumpur becoming a Federal Territory in 1974.

The Kuala Lumpur Bar is led by a Committee comprising the Chairman of the KL Bar and ten other members who are elected annually at the Annual General Meeting. The Committee is also empowered to co-opt two additional members into the Committee. The co-opted members can participate in the deliberations of the Committee but have no vote. The Chairman is an ex-officio member of the Bar Council and a representative to the Bar Council is elected by members of the Kuala Lumpur Bar at their Annual General Meeting. The Honorary Secretary is appointed by the Committee from amongst the members of the Kuala Lumpur Bar but by convention will be from the elected Committee. The Kuala Lumpur Bar Committee (KLBC) currently has twelve sub-committees to undertake a host of projects and activities.

This is a '''list of fossil primates'''—extinct [[primate]]s for which a [[fossil|fossil record]] exists. Primates are generally thought to have evolved from a small, unspecialized [[mammal]], which probably fed on insects and fruits. However, the precise source of the primates remains controversial and even their arboreal origin has recently been questioned.&lt;ref name="rasmussen2002"&gt;{{cite book |author=Rasmussen, D. T. |chapter=The origin of Primates |editor=Hartwig, W. C. |title=The Primate Fossil Record |journal=The Primate Fossil Record |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2002 |pages=5–9|bibcode=2002prfr.book.....H }}&lt;/ref&gt; As it has been suggested, many other mammal orders are arboreal too, but they have not developed the same characteristics as primates. Nowadays, some well known genera, such as ''[[Purgatorius]]'' and ''[[Plesiadapis]]'', thought to be the most ancient primates for a long time, are not usually considered as such by recent authors, who tend to include them in the new order [[Plesiadapiformes]], within superorder [[Euarchontoglires]].&lt;ref name="covert2002"&gt;{{cite book |author=Covert, H. H. |chapter=The earliest fossil Primates and the evolution of Prosimians: Introduction |editor=Hartwig, W. C. |title=The Primate Fossil Record |journal=The Primate Fossil Record |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2002 |pages=13–20|bibcode=2002prfr.book.....H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some, to avoid confusions, employ the unranked term [[Euprimates]], which excludes Plesiadapiformes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=McKenna, M. C.  |author2=Bell, S.

There is an academic debate on the time the first primates appeared. One of the earliest probable primate fossils is the problematic ''[[Altiatlasius koulchii]]'', perhaps an [[Omomyid]], but perhaps a non-Primate [[Plesiadapiform]], which lived in Morocco, during the [[Paleocene]], around 60 [[annum|Ma]].&lt;ref name="rasmussen2002"/&gt; However, other studies, including molecular clock studies, have estimated the origin of the primate branch to have been in the mid-[[Cretaceous]] period, around 85 Ma, that is to say, in the time previous to the extinction of dinosaurs and the successful mammal radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Molecular Clock Calibrations and Metazoan Divergence Dates|author=Lee, M.|journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution|volume=49|issue=3|date=September 1999|pages=385–391|doi=10.1007/PL00006562|pmid=10473780|bibcode=1999JMolE..49..385L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Field Museum]] |title=Scientists Push Back Primate Origins From 65 Million To 85 Million Years Ago|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2002/04/020418073440.htm|publisher=[[Science Daily]]| accessdate=2008-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Using the fossil record to estimate the age of the last common ancestor of extant primates|author=[[Simon Tavaré|Tavaré, S.]], Marshall, C.

A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution |publisher=Mariner Books |location=Boston, New York |year=2005 |pages=160–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no fossils known that can be directly linked to the living African apes, nor any that could be considered representative of the last common ancestor between them and humans.&lt;ref&gt;Willoughby, P. Palaeoanthropology and the place of humans in nature. International Journal of Comparative Psychology, 2005, 18, 60-91. Pamela Willougby at the time of authorship is Prof of Anthropology at the University of Alberta&lt;/ref&gt;

The order Primates, established by [[Linnaeus]] in 1758, includes humans and their immediate ancestors. However, contrarily to the common opinion, most primates do not have especially large brains. Brain size is a derived character, which only appeared with genus ''[[Homo]]'', and was lacking in the first [[Hominidae|hominid]]. In fact, hominid encephalization quotient is only 1.5 [[megaannum|Ma]] more recent than that of some dolphin species. The encephalization quotient of some [[cetacean]]s is therefore higher than that of most primates, including the nearest relatives of humans, such as ''[[Australopithecus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Conway Morris, S. |title=Life's Solution. Inevitable Humans in a Lonely Universe |publisher=University of Cambridge |location=Cambridge |year=2003 |pages=245–247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This list follows partly from [[Walter Hartwig|Walter Carl Hartwig]]'s 2002 book ''[[The Fossil Primate Record]]''&lt;ref name="hartwig2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hartwig, C.|title=The Fossil Primate Record|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John G. Fleagle]]'s 2013 book ''Primate Adaptation and Evolution'' (3rd edition).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Fleagle | first1 = J.G. | year = 2013 | title = Primate Adaptation and Evolution | edition = 3rd | publisher = [[Academic Press]] | isbn = 978-0-123-78633-3 | oclc = 820107187 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=--PNXm0q2O8C&amp;pg=PA416 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parentheses around authors' names (and dates) indicates a change in [[Genus|generic name]] for the fossil, as stated in the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=ICZN |url=http://www.iczn.org/iczn/index.jsp?article=51&amp;nfv=true#3 |title=Article 51.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11149">This is a list of institutions using the term '''[[institute of technology]]''' or '''polytechnic'''. "Institute of technology" is a designation employed for a wide range of learning institutions awarding different types of degrees and operating often at variable levels of the educational system. The English term "polytechnic" appeared in the early 19th century, from the [[French language|French]] [[École Polytechnique]], an engineering school founded in 1794 in [[Paris]]. The French term comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] πολύ (''polú'' or ''polý'') meaning "many" and τεχνικός (''tekhnikós'') meaning "arts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=polytechnic&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=polytechnic - Origin and meaning of polytechnic by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the terms "institute of technology" and "polytechnic" are synonymous, the preferred term varies from country to country.

==University level==

== European Union (CEN) standards ==
The [[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN) had issued numerous standards covering welding processes, which unified and replaced former national standards. Of the former national standards, those issued by [[British Standards|BSI]] and [[DIN]] were widely used outside their countries of origin. After the Vienna Agreement with ISO, CEN has replaced most of them with equivalent ISO standards (EN ISO series).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = About us |url = http://www.cen.eu/cen/AboutUs/Pages/default.aspx |publisher=European Committee for Standardization (CEN) |accessdate = 7 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Luttinger liquid''', or '''Tomonaga–Luttinger liquid''', is a theoretical model describing interacting [[electron]]s (or other [[fermion]]s) in a one-dimensional [[electrical conductor|conductor]] (e.g. [[quantum wire]]s such as [[carbon nanotube]]s). Such a model is necessary as the commonly used [[Fermi liquid]] model breaks down for one dimension.

The Tomonaga–Luttinger liquid was first proposed by [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga|Tomonaga]] in 1950. The model showed that under certain constraints, second-order interactions between electrons could be modelled as bosonic interactions. In 1963, [[Joaquin Mazdak Luttinger|J.M. Luttinger]] reformulated the theory in terms of Bloch sound waves and showed that the constraints proposed by Tomonaga were unnecessary in order to treat the second-order perturbations as bosons. But his solution of the model was incorrect; the correct solution was given by {{Ill|Daniel C. Mattis|de|Daniel Mattis|WD=}} and [[Elliott H. Lieb|Elliot H. Lieb]] 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mattis|first=Daniel C.|last2=Lieb|first2=Elliot H.|date=February 1965|title=Exact solution of a many-fermion system and its associated boson field|journal=Journal of Mathematical Physics|volume=6|pages=98–106|doi=10.1142/9789812812650_0008|bibcode=1994boso.book...98M|isbn=978-981-02-1847-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
Luttinger liquid theory describes low energy excitations in a 1D electron gas as bosons.  Starting with the free electron Hamiltonian:

&lt;math&gt;H = \sum_{k} \epsilon_k c_k^{\dagger} c_k&lt;/math&gt;

is separated into left and right moving electrons and undergoes linearization with the approximation &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_k \approx \pm v_{\rm F}(k-k_{\rm F})&lt;/math&gt; over the range &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;H = \sum_{k = k_{\rm F} -\Lambda}^{ k_{\rm F} +\Lambda} v_{\rm F} k(c_k^{R \dagger } c_k^R - c_k^{L \dagger }c_k^L)&lt;/math&gt;

Expressions for bosons in terms of fermions are used to represent the Hamiltonian as a product of two boson operators in a [[Bogoliubov transformation]].

The completed [[bosonization]] can then be used to predict spin-charge separation.  Electron-electron interactions can be treated to calculate correlation functions.

== Features ==
Among the hallmark features of a Luttinger liquid are the following:

* The response of the [[charge density|charge]] (or [[particle density (particle count)|particle]]) density to some external perturbation are waves ("[[plasmon]]s" - or charge density waves) propagating at a velocity that is determined by the strength of the interaction and the average density. For a non-interacting system, this wave velocity is equal to the [[Fermi velocity]], while it is higher (lower) for repulsive (attractive) interactions among the fermions.
* Likewise, there are spin density waves (whose velocity, to lowest approximation, is equal to the unperturbed Fermi velocity). These propagate independently from the charge density waves. This fact is known as [[spin-charge separation]].
* [[Charge (physics)|Charge]] and [[Spin (physics)|spin]] waves are the elementary excitations of the Luttinger liquid, unlike the [[quasiparticle]]s of the Fermi liquid (which carry both spin and charge). The mathematical description becomes very simple in terms of these waves (solving the one-dimensional [[wave equation]]), and most of the work consists in transforming back to obtain the properties of the particles themselves (or treating impurities and other situations where '[[backscattering]]' is important).  See [[bosonization]] for one technique used.
* Even at zero temperature, the particles' momentum distribution function does not display a sharp jump, in contrast to the Fermi liquid (where this jump indicates the Fermi surface).
* There is no 'quasiparticle peak' in the momentum-dependent spectral function (i.e. no peak whose width becomes much smaller than the excitation energy above the Fermi level, as is the case for the Fermi liquid). Instead, there is a power-law singularity, with a 'non-universal' exponent that depends on the interaction strength.
* Around impurities, there are the usual [[Friedel oscillation]]s in the charge density, at a [[wavevector]] of &lt;math&gt;2 k_\text{F}&lt;/math&gt;. However, in contrast to the Fermi liquid, their decay at large distances is governed by yet another interaction-dependent exponent.
* At small temperatures, the scattering of these Friedel oscillations becomes so efficient that the effective strength of the impurity is renormalized to infinity, 'pinching off' the quantum wire. More precisely, the conductance becomes zero as temperature and transport voltage go to zero (and rises like a power law in voltage and temperature, with an interaction-dependent exponent).
* Likewise, the tunneling rate into a Luttinger liquid is suppressed to zero at low voltages and temperatures, as a [[power law]].

The Luttinger model is thought to describe the universal low-frequency/long-wavelength behaviour of any one-dimensional system of interacting fermions (that has not undergone a phase transition into some other state).

== Physical systems ==
Among the physical systems believed to be described by the Luttinger model are:

* artificial '[[quantum wire]]s' (one-dimensional strips of electrons) defined by applying gate voltages to a [[two-dimensional electron gas]], or by other means ([[lithography]], [[atomic force microscope|AFM]], etc.)
* electrons in [[carbon nanotube]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Direct observation of Tomonaga–Luttinger-liquid state in carbon nanotubes at low temperatures|date = 4 December 2003|journal = Nature|accessdate = |doi = 10.1038/nature02074|pmid = 14654836|bibcode = 2003Natur.426..540I |volume=426 |issue = 6966|pages=540–544 | last1 = Ishii | first1 = H | last2 = Kataura | first2 = H | last3 = Shiozawa | first3 = H | last4 = Yoshioka | first4 = H | last5 = Otsubo | first5 = H | last6 = Takayama | first6 = Y | last7 = Miyahara | first7 = T | last8 = Suzuki | first8 = S | last9 = Achiba | first9 = Y | last10 = Nakatake | first10 = M | last11 = Narimura | first11 = T | last12 = Higashiguchi | first12 = M | last13 = Shimada | first13 = K | last14 = Namatame | first14 = H | last15 = Taniguchi | first15 = M}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* electrons moving along edge states in the [[fractional Quantum Hall Effect]] or integer [[Quantum Hall Effect]] although the latter is often considered a more trivial example. 
* electrons hopping along one-dimensional chains of molecules (e.g. certain organic molecular crystals)
* [[fermionic atom]]s in quasi-one-dimensional atomic traps
* a 1D 'chain' of half-odd-integer spins described by the [[Heisenberg model (quantum)|Heisenberg model]] (the Luttinger liquid model also works for integer spins in a large enough magnetic field)

Attempts to demonstrate Luttinger-liquid-like behaviour in those systems are the subject of ongoing experimental research in [[condensed matter physics]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11943">The possibility that there might be '''more than one dimension of time''' has occasionally been discussed in [[physics]] and [[philosophy]].

== Physics ==

[[Special relativity]] describes [[spacetime]] as a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|manifold]] whose [[metric tensor]] has a negative [[eigenvalue]]. This corresponds to the existence of a "time-like" direction. A metric with multiple negative eigenvalues would correspondingly imply ''several'' timelike directions, i.e. multiple time dimensions, but there is no consensus regarding the relationship of these extra "times" to time as conventionally understood.

If the special theory of relativity can be generalized for the case of ''k''-dimensional time (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) and ''n''-dimensional space (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k'' + 2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,  ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k'' + ''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), then the (''k'' + ''n'')-dimensional interval, being invariant, is given by the expression

:(d''s''&lt;sub&gt;''k'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (''c''d''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + (''c''d''t''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − (d''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − … − (d''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The [[metric signature]] will be

:&lt;math&gt;(\underbrace{+,\cdots,+}_{k},\underbrace{-,\cdots,-}_{n})&lt;/math&gt;  (timelike [[sign convention]])
or
:&lt;math&gt;(\underbrace{-,\cdots,-}_{k},\underbrace{+,\cdots,+}_{n})&lt;/math&gt; (spacelike sign convention).

The transformations between the two inertial frames of reference ''K'' and ''K''′, which are in a standard configuration (i.e., transformations without translations and/or rotations of the space axis in the [[hyperplane]] of [[space]] and/or rotations of the  time axis in the hyperplane of time), are given as follows:&lt;ref name="Milen2012"&gt;

where

These transformations are generalization of the [[Lorentz boost]] in a fixed space direction (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;) in the field of the multidimensional [[time]] and multidimensional space.

Let us denote
&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx_\eta}{dt_\sigma} = V_{\sigma\eta}&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx'_\eta}{dt'_\sigma} = V'_{\sigma\eta},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''σ'' = 1, 2, ..., ''k''; ''η'' = ''k''+1, ''k''+2, ..., ''k''+''n''. The [[velocity-addition formula]] is then given by

:&lt;math&gt;V'_{\sigma(k+1)} = \frac{V_{\sigma(k+1)}\zeta\left(1 - \beta^2\sum_{\theta=1}^k \frac{c^2}{v_\theta V_{\theta(k+1)}}\right)}{1 + \frac  {V_{\sigma(k+1)}}{v_\sigma}\beta^2\left((\zeta-1)\sum_{\theta=1}^k \frac{c^2}{v_\theta V_{\theta(k+1)}} - \zeta\right)},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V'_{\sigma \lambda} = \frac{V_{\sigma \lambda}}{1 + \frac{V_{\sigma(k+1)}}{v_\sigma}\beta^2\left((\zeta-1)\sum_{\theta=1}^k \frac{c^2}{v_\theta V_{\theta(k+1)}} - \zeta\right)},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''σ'' = 1, 2, ..., ''k''; ''λ'' = ''k''+2, ''k''+3, ..., ''k''+''n''.

For simplicity, let us consider only one spatial [[dimension]] ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and the two time dimensions ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. (E. g., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''ct''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''ct''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''.) Let us assume that in point ''O'', having coordinates ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, there has been an event ''E''. Let us further assume that a given interval of time &lt;math&gt;\Delta T = \sqrt{(\Delta t_1)^2 + (\Delta t_2)^2} \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; has passed since the event ''E''. The causal region connected to the event ''E'' includes the [[lateral surface]] of the [[right circular cone]] {(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − (''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0}, the lateral surface of the [[right circular cylinder]] {(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Δ''T''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;} and the inner region bounded by these surfaces, i.e., the causal region includes all points (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), for which the conditions

:{(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − (''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 and |''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;| ≤ ''c''Δ''T''} or

:{(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − (''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 0 and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Δ''T''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}

are fulfilled.&lt;ref name="Milen2012"/&gt;

Theories with more than one dimension of time have sometimes been advanced in physics, whether as a serious description of reality or just as a curious possibility. [[Itzhak Bars]]'s work on "two-time physics",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://physics.usc.edu/~bars/twoTph.htm |title=Two-Time Physics |last1=Bars |first1=Itzhak |accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by the SO(10,2) symmetry of the extended supersymmetry structure of [[M-theory]], is the most recent and systematic development of the concept (see also [[F-theory]]).  Walter Craig and Steven Weinstein proved the existence of a well-posed initial value problem for the [[ultrahyperbolic equation]] (a wave equation in more than one time dimension).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/465/2110/3023 | title = On determinism and well-posedness in multiple time dimensions | publisher = Proc. R. Soc. A  vol. 465 no. 2110 3023-3046 (2008) | last1= Craig | first1 = Walter | last2 = Weinstein | first2 = Steven | accessdate = 5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This showed that initial data on a mixed (spacelike and timelike) hypersurface obeying a particular nonlocal constraint evolves deterministically in the remaining time dimension.

=== Connection to the Planck length and the speed of light ===

Let us regard the motion of a test particle with coordinate

&lt;math&gt; x^{\mu} = \begin{pmatrix} ct \\ r\cdot f\left(\frac{\gamma\tau}{\Lambda}\right) \\ \mathbf{x} \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

which is the canonical (1,3) spacetime vector &lt;math&gt; (ct, \mathbf{x})^{T} &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; x \in \R^3 &lt;/math&gt; extended by an additional timelike coordinate &lt;math&gt; r \cdot f (\gamma\tau /\Lambda)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt; \tau &lt;/math&gt; is the second time parameter, &lt;math&gt; r\in \R&lt;/math&gt; describes the size of the second time dimension and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the characteristic velocity, thus the equivalent of &lt;math&gt; c &lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; describes the shape of the second time dimension and &lt;math&gt; \Lambda\in \R&lt;/math&gt; is a normalization parameter such that &lt;math&gt; \gamma\tau/\Lambda &lt;/math&gt; is dimensionless. Decomposing &lt;math&gt; x^{\mu}=x^{\mu}_t + x^{\mu}_{\tau} &lt;/math&gt; with 

&lt;math&gt; x^{\mu}_t = \begin {pmatrix} ct \\ 0 \\ \eta\mathbf{x} \end{pmatrix};\ x^{\mu}_{\tau} = \begin {pmatrix} 0 \\ r\cdot f\left(\frac{\gamma\tau}{\Lambda}\right) \\ (1-\eta)\mathbf{x} \end{pmatrix}, \eta\in(0,1) &lt;/math&gt;

and using the metric &lt;math&gt; (+,+,-,-,-) &lt;/math&gt;, the [[Lagrangian_mechanics | Lagrangian]] becomes

&lt;math&gt; L(x,\dot{x},x^{\prime},t,\tau)=\frac{r}{\Lambda}\sqrt{\dot{c}^2t^2+c^2-\eta^2\dot{\mathbf{x}}^2+2\dot{c}ct}\sqrt{(\gamma^{\prime 2}\tau^2+\gamma^2+2\gamma
\gamma^{\prime}\tau)\left(\left.\frac{df}{dz}\right|_{z=\frac{\gamma\tau}{\Lambda}}\right)^{2}-(1-\eta)^2\mathbf{x}^{\prime 2}}. &lt;/math&gt;

Applying the [[Euler-Lagrange Equations]]

&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{x}_i}+\frac{d}{d\tau}\frac{\partial L}{\partial x^{\prime\ }_i}-\frac{\partial L}{\partial x_i}=0 &lt;/math&gt;

the existence of the [[Planck length]] and the constancy of the [[speed of light]] can be derived.{{cn|date=November 2017|reason=source originally cited was not reliable}}

As a consequence of this model it has been suggested that the speed of light may not have been constant in the early universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A Time Varying Speed of Light as a Solution to Cosmological Puzzles | publisher = Phys. Rev. D vol. 59 043516 (1999) | last1= Albrecht | first1 = A. | last2=Magueijo | first2= J. |}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Conceptual difficulties with multiple physical time dimensions have been raised in modern [[analytic philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fqxi.org/community/essay/winners/2008.1#Weinstein | last1 = Weinstein | first1 = Steven | title = Many Times | publisher=Foundational Questions Institute |accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a solution to the problem of the subjective passage of time, [[J. W. Dunne]] proposed an infinite hierarchy of time dimensions, inhabited by a similar hierarchy of levels of consciousness. Dunne suggested that, in the context of a "block" spacetime as modelled by [[General Relativity]], a second dimension of time was needed in order to measure the speed of one's progress along one's own timeline. This in turn required a level of the conscious self existing at the second level of time. But the same arguments then applied to this new level, requiring a third level, and so on in an [[infinite regress]]. At the end of the regress was a "superlative general observer" who existed in [[eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sprg.ssl.berkeley.edu/~jmcd/book/revs3/aewt.html |title=John's Book Reviews: An Experiment with Time |last1=McDonald |first1=John Q. |date=15 November 2006 |accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published his theory in relation to [[precognition|precognitive]] dreams in his 1927 book ''[[An Experiment with Time]]'' and went on to explore its relevance to contemporary physics in ''The Serial Universe'' (1934). His infinite regress was criticised as logically flawed and unnecessary, although writers such as [[J. B. Priestley]] acknowledged the possibility of his second time dimension.&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Gunn; ''The Problem of Time'', Unwin, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.B. Priestley, ''Man and Time'', Aldus, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nesta''' (formerly '''NESTA''', '''National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts''') is an innovation foundation based in the UK.

The organisation acts through a combination of practical programmes, investment, policy and research, and the formation of partnerships to promote innovation across a broad range of sectors.

Nesta was originally funded by a £250&amp;nbsp;million endowment from the UK [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]]. The endowment is now kept in trust, and Nesta uses the interest from the trust to meet its charitable objects and to fund and support its projects.

The charity is registered in England and Wales with charity no. 1144091 and in Scotland with no. SC042833

==History==

Old NESTA was set up in 1998 by an independent [[Financial endowment|endowment]] in the United Kingdom established by an Act of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].

On 14 October 2010 the Government announced that it would transfer old NESTA's status from an executive [[non-departmental public body]] to a new charitable body.

On 1 April 2012 the old NESTA transitioned from being an executive to a charitable body, changing its name to Nesta, and dropping the long title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Scott Buckler |title=Nesta becomes an independent charity |url=http://www.govtoday.co.uk/politics/27-growth-reform/10722-nesta-becomes-an-independent-charity |work=Gov Today |date=3 April 2012 |accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
Nesta currently operates in the following areas:

===Economic growth===
Nesta's Policy and Research team publish regular research papers on how innovation can boost economic growth.

In 2012 it published Plan I,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nesta.org.uk/areas_of_work/economic_growth/plan_i Plan I]&lt;/ref&gt; an innovation manifesto for the UK, and the latest Innovation Index&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nesta.org.uk/news/nesta-report-shows-%25C2%25A324bn-collapse-innovation-investment-and-more-deep-rooted-crisis |title=Nesta report shows £24bn collapse in innovation investment and a more deep-rooted crisis  |publisher=Nesta |date=16 June 2012 |accessdate=3 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; figures, which showed that there had been a £24bn drop in innovation funding in the last decade.

Previously it has published ''The Vital 6 Percent'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nesta.org.uk/publications/reports/assets/features/the_vital_6_per_cent |title=Publications |publisher=Nesta |accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mass Localism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nesta.org.uk/publications/reports/assets/features/mass_localism |title=Publications |publisher=Nesta |accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investment===

in 2012 the charity launched a £25&amp;nbsp;million impact investment fund, ''Nesta Impact Investments'', run by its subsidiary Nesta Investment Management. Other investors are [[Big Society Capital]] and the [[Omidyar Network]]. The fund invests in social ventures with innovative products or services that address the following three challenges: an ageing population; the employability of young people; and the sustainability of UK communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Andrew Holt |title=Nesta launches £25m impact investment fund |url=http://www.charitytimes.com/ct/Nesta_launches_25m_impact_investment_fund.php |work=Charity Times |date=23 October 2012 |accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public services===

Nesta runs practical programmes to find innovative ways of delivering cheaper, more efficient public services, and demonstrating how these can be scaled up across the UK.

Previous examples of work include the Innovation in Giving fund, in partnership with the [[Cabinet Office]], which seeks to find and support new platforms for the giving of time, skills and money. They also ran an education programme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nesta.org.uk/areas_of_work/public_services_lab/digital_education |title=Decoding Learning |publisher=Nesta |accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; looking at how children can be taught to become digital makers, and how the education system can benefit from digital technology.

In the past they ran The Big Green Challenge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nesta.org.uk/areas_of_work/public_services_lab/environment/big_green_challenge |title=Big Green Challenge |work=Nesta |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091120135309/http://www.nesta.org.uk/areas_of_work/public_services_lab/environment/big_green_challenge |archivedate=20 November 2009 |accessdate=3 April 2015 |quote=The Big Green Challenge is NESTA's £1million challenge prize designed to stimulate and support community-led responses to climate change. }}&lt;/ref&gt; a £1&amp;nbsp;million prize fund to stimulate community action on climate change.

In 2012 Nesta published a report criticising the use of technology in schools. The report highlighted areas where new technology could be usefully employed. It argued that digital technology was often purchased, costing £450&amp;nbsp;million per year, without demonstrable evidence it was improving education methods.&lt;ref name=itpro12&gt;{{cite news|author=Caroline Donnelly |title=Nesta blasts UK schools for "wasted" technology investments |url=http://www.itpro.co.uk/644188/nesta-blasts-uk-schools-for-wasted-technology-investments |work=IT Pro |date=16 November 2012 |accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creative industries===

Nesta also specialises in original research into the UK's creative industries, and runs practical programmes to help the sector.

In February 2011 Nesta produced Next Gen, in association with [[Ian Livingstone]] and Alex Hope, which helped start the debate about teaching UK schoolchildren to learn how to code. The report specifically called for ways to protect the future of the UK's video games and video effects industries by arguing for, among other things, the introduction of computer science teaching in schools.

It is runs the Digital R&amp;D Fund, in partnership with [[Arts Council]] and the Arts and Humanites Research Council, and also runs the Creative Business Mentoring Network, which pairs mentees from creative companies with experienced business leaders.

===Government Innovation===

Nesta runs several programs to help governments become more innovative. Its flagship initiative in this field, States of Change,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nesta.org.uk/project/states-change|title=States of Change {{!}} Nesta|website=www.nesta.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; aims to bring together governments to share experiences about how to implement new ideas. It has created several toolkits to try and foster the skills that will let public servants innovate.

==Management==
Sir [[John Gieve]] chairs the organisation.
[[Geoff Mulgan]] is CEO.&lt;ref name=itpro12 /&gt;

'''Parallel tempering''', also known as '''replica exchange MCMC sampling''', is a [[simulation]] method aimed at improving the dynamic properties of  [[Monte Carlo method]] simulations of physical systems, and of [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] (MCMC) sampling methods more generally.  The replica exchange method was originally devised by Swendsen and Wang &lt;ref&gt;Swendsen RH and Wang JS (1986) Replica Monte Carlo simulation of spin glasses Physical Review Letters 57 : 2607-2609&lt;/ref&gt; then extended by Geyer&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Geyer, (1991) in ''Computing Science and Statistics'', Proceedings of the 23rd Symposium on the Interface, American Statistical Association, New York, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; and later developed, among others, by [[Hukushima and Nemoto]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|bibcode = 1999CPL...314..141S }}&lt;/ref&gt; this is usually known as replica-exchange molecular dynamics or REMD.

Essentially, one runs ''N'' copies of the system, randomly initialized, at different temperatures. Then, based on the Metropolis criterion  one exchanges configurations at different temperatures. The idea of this method
is to make configurations at high temperatures available to the simulations at low temperatures and vice versa.
This results in a very robust ensemble which is able to sample both low and high energy configurations.
In this way, thermodynamical properties such as the specific heat, which is in general not well computed in the canonical ensemble, can be computed with great precision.

==Background==
Typically a [[Monte Carlo simulation]] using a [[Metropolis-Hastings]] update consists of a single [[stochastic process]] that evaluates the [[energy]] of the system and accepts/rejects updates based on the [[temperature]] ''T''.  At high temperatures updates that change the energy of the system are comparatively more probable.  When the system is highly correlated, updates are rejected and the simulation is said to suffer from critical slowing down.

If we were to run two simulations at temperatures separated by a Δ''T'', we would find that if Δ''T'' is small enough, then the energy [[histogram]]s obtained by collecting the values of the energies over a set of Monte Carlo steps N will create two distributions that will somewhat overlap. The overlap can be defined by the area of the histograms that falls over the same interval of energy values, normalized by the total number of samples. For Δ''T'' = 0 the overlap should approach 1.

Another way to interpret this overlap is to say that system configurations sampled at temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are likely to appear during a simulation at ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Because the [[Markov chain]] should have no memory of its past, we can create a new update for the system composed of the two systems at ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  At a given Monte Carlo step we can update the global system by swapping the configuration of the two systems, or alternatively trading the two temperatures. The update is accepted according to the Metropolis-Hastings criterion with probability

:&lt;math&gt; p = \min \left( 1, \frac{ \exp \left( -\frac{E_j}{kT_i} - \frac{E_i}{kT_j} \right) }{ \exp \left( -\frac{E_i}{kT_i} - \frac{E_j}{kT_j} \right) } \right) = \min \left( 1, e^{(E_i - E_j) \left( \frac{1}{kT_i} - \frac{1}{kT_j} \right)} \right) ,&lt;/math&gt;

and otherwise the update is rejected. The [[detailed balance]] condition has to be satisfied by ensuring that the reverse update has to be equally likely, all else being equal. This can be ensured by appropriately choosing regular Monte Carlo updates or parallel tempering updates with probabilities that are independent of the configurations of the two systems or of the Monte Carlo step.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|journal = Statistics and Computing
|volume = 6 |issue=4|pages = 353–366
|doi=10.1007/BF00143556
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This update can be generalized to more than two systems.

By a careful choice of temperatures and number of systems one can achieve an improvement in the mixing properties of a set of Monte Carlo simulations that exceeds the extra computational cost of running parallel simulations.

Other considerations to be made: increasing the number of different temperatures can have a detrimental effect, as one can think of the 'lateral' movement of a given system across temperatures as a diffusion process.
Set up is important as there must be a practical histogram overlap to achieve a reasonable probability of lateral moves.

The parallel tempering method can be used as a super [[simulated annealing]] that does not need restart, since a system at high temperature can feed new local optimizers to a system at low temperature, allowing tunneling between metastable states and improving convergence to a global optimum.

The project allowed participants to publish the [[genotype]] (the full [[DNA sequence]] of all 46 [[chromosome]]s) of the volunteers, along with extensive information about their [[phenotype]]: medical records, various measurements, [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] images, etc. All data were placed within the [[public domain]] and made available over the [[Internet]] so that researchers could test various hypotheses about the relationships among [[genotype]], [[Nature versus nurture#Interaction of genes and environment|environment]] and [[phenotype]]. Participants could decide what data they are comfortable to publish publicly and could choose to upload additional data or remove existing data at their own convenience.

An important part of the project was the exploration of the resulting risks to the participants, such as possible discrimination by insurers and employers if the genome shows a predisposition for certain diseases.

The PGP is establishing an international network of sites, including the United States (Harvard PGP), Canada (University of Toronto / Hospital for Sick Kids), and other countries that adhere to certain "conforming implementation" criteria such as no promise of anonymity and data return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.personalgenomes.org/international.html|title=Personal Genome Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Harvard Medical School [[Institutional Review Board]] requested that the first set of volunteers include the principal investigator George Church and other diverse stakeholders in the scientific, medical, and social implications of personal genomes, because they were well positioned to give highly [[informed consent]]. As [[DNA sequencing|sequencing technology]] becomes cheaper, and the societal issues mentioned above are worked out, it was hoped that a large number of volunteers from all walks of life would participate. The long-term goal was that every person have access to his or her [[genotype]] to be used for personalized medical decisions.

The first ten volunteers were referred to as the "PGP-10".  These volunteers were:

== PGP Lumosity Project ==
On March 9, 2017, producers of the popular online brain-training program Lumosity announced they would collaborate with Harvard researchers to investigate the relationship between genetics and memory, attention, and reaction speed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wyss.harvard.edu/pgp-lumosity/ "Personal Genome Project-Lumosity Study"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/03/wyss-institute-harvard-medical-school-collaborate-with-lumosity-in-memory-research/ "Brain-training app creators join in the genetics game"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering and the Harvard Medical School Personal Genome Project (PGP) planned to recruit 10,000 members from the PGP, to perform a set of cognitive tests from Lumos Labs’ NeuroCognitive Performance Test, a brief, repeatable, online assessment to evaluate participants’ memory functions, including object recall, object pattern memorization, and response times. The researchers would then correlate extremely high performance scores with naturally occurring variations in the participants’ genomes. To validate their findings, the team would sequence, edit, and visualize DNA, model neuronal development in 3-D brain organoids ex vivo, and finally test emerging hypotheses in experimental models of neurodegeneration.

'''Personnel selection''' is the methodical process used to hire (or, less commonly, [[promotion (rank)|promote]]) individuals. Although the term can apply to all aspects of the process ([[recruitment]], selection, hiring, acculturation, etc.) the most common meaning focuses on the selection of workers. In this respect, selected prospects are separated from rejected applicants with the intention of choosing the person who will be the most successful and make the most valuable contributions to the organization.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky&gt;Muchinsky, P. (2012). ''Psychology Applied to Work'', (10th ed.). Summerfield, N
klu
C: Hypergraphic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Its effect on the group is discerned when the selected accomplish their desired impact to the group, through achievement or tenure. The procedure of selection takes after strategy to gather data around a person so as to figure out whether that individual ought to be utilized. The strategies used must be in compliance with the various laws in respect to work force selection.

==Overview==
The professional standards of [[industrial psychology|industrial-organizational psychologists]] (I-O psychologists) require that any selection system be based on a [[job analysis]] to ensure that the selection criteria are job-related. The requirements for a selection system are characteristics known as KSAOs – knowledge, skills, ability, and other characteristics. US law also recognizes ''[[bona fide occupational qualifications]]'' (BFOQs), which are requirements for a job which would be considered discriminatory if not necessary – such as only employing men as wardens of maximum-security male prisons, enforcing a mandatory retirement age for airline pilots, or a religious college only employing professors of its religion to teach its theology.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt;

Personnel selection systems employ evidence-based practices to determine the most qualified candidates and involve both the newly hired and those individuals who can be promoted from within the organization.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt;

In this respect, selection of personnel has "validity" if an unmistakable relationship can be shown between the system itself and the employment for which the people are ultimately being chosen for. In this way, a vital piece of selection is Job Analysis. An analysis is typically conducted before, and regularly apart of, the improvement in determination systems. Then again, a selection method may be deemed valid after it has already been executed by directing follow up job analysis and demonstrating the relationship between the selection process and the respective job.&lt;ref name="Muchinsky" /&gt;

The procedure of personnel selection includes gathering data about the potential candidates with the end goal of deciding suitability and sustainability for the employment in that particular job. This data is gathered utilizing one or more determination devices or strategies classified as such:&lt;ref name="Muchinsky" /&gt; 
* Interviews
* Personality Tests
* Biographical Data
* Cognitive Ability Tests
* Physical Ability Tests
* Work Samples
Development and implementation of such screening methods is sometimes done by human resources departments; larger organizations hire consultants or firms that specialize in developing personnel selection systems. I-O psychologists must evaluate evidence regarding the extent to which selection tools predict job performance, evidence that bears on the validity of selection tools. These procedures are usually validated (shown to be job relevant), using one or more of the following types of [[validity (statistics)|validity]]: [[content validity]], [[construct validity]], and/or [[criterion validity|criterion-related validity]].&lt;ref name="Muchinsky" /&gt;

==History and development==
[[Imperial examination|Chinese civil servant exams]], established in AD 605, may be the first documented "modern" selection tests, and have influenced subsequent examination systems.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
As a scientific and scholarly field, personnel selection owes much to [[psychometric]] theory and the art of integrating selection systems falls to [[human resources|human resource professionals]].

In the [[United States of America]], members of the [http://www.siop.org Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP)] conduct much of the research on selection. Primary research topics include:

* the practicality, reliability, validity, and utility of various forms of selection measures
* methods for demonstrating return on investment for selection systems
* assessing fairness and making selection systems as fair as possible
* legal issues&amp;mdash;such as [[disparate treatment]] and [[disparate impact]]&amp;mdash;and overall compliance with laws
* the generalizability of validity across different work contexts
* alternative methods of demonstrating validity, such as synthetic validity&lt;ref&gt;Steel, P. (2006).

== Validity and reliability ==
=== Validity of interviews ===
The validity of interviews describes how useful interviews are in predicting job performance. In one of the most comprehensive meta-analytic summary to date by Weisner and Cronshaw (1988). The authors investigated interview validity as a function of interview format (individual vs board) and degree of structure( structure vs unstructured). Results of this study showed that structured interviews yielded much higher mean corrected validities than unstructured interviews (0.63 vs 0.20), and  structured board interviews using consensus ratings had the highest corrected validity (0.64).

In&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Comprehensive Review and Meta- analysis of the Validity of Interviews|last = McDaniel, Whetzel, Schmidt &amp; Maurer's|first = |date = 1994|journal = Journal of Applied Psychology Vol.79. No. 4, 599 – 616.|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; McDaniel, Whetzel, Schmidt &amp; Maurer's  Comprehensive Review and Meta- analysis of the Validity of Interviews (1994) paper, the authors go a step further and  include an examination of the validity of three different types of interview content(situational, job-related, and psychological).Their goal was to explore the possibility that validity is a function of the type of content collected.

They define the three kinds of content as follows – situational content was described as interview questions that get information on how the interviewee would behave in specific situations presented by the interviewer. For example, a question that asks whether the interviewee would choose to report a coworker for behaving in an unethical way or just let them go. Job related questions, on the other hand, assess the interviewee's past behavior and job-related information. While psychological interviews include questions intended to assess the interviewee's personality traits such as their work ethic, dependability, honesty etc.

The authors conducted a meta-analysis of all previous studies on the validity of interviews across the three types of  content mentioned above. Their results show that for job-performance criteria, situational interviews yield higher mean validity(0.50) than do job-related interviews(0.39) which yield a higher mean validity than do psychology interviews(0.29). This means that when the interview is used to predict job performance, it is best to conduct situational interviews rather than job-related or psychological interviews. On the other hand, when interviews are used to predict an applicant's training performance, the mean validity of job-related interviews(0.36) is somewhat lower than the mean validity of psychological interviews(0.40).

Going beyond the content of the interview, the authors' analysis of interview validity was extended to include an assessment of how the interview was conducted. Here, two questions emerged – Are structured interviews more valid than unstructured interviews ? and are board interviews( with more than one interviewer) more valid than individual interviews.

Their answer  to the first question – Are structured interviews more valid unstructured interviews was that structured interviews, regardless of content, is more valid(0.44) than unstructured interviews(0.33) in predicting job performance criteria. However, when training performance is the criteria, the validity of structured and unstructured interviews are similar (0.34 and 0.36).

As for the validity of board interviews versus individual interviews, the researchers conducted another meta-analyses comparing the validity of board interviews and individual interviews for job performance criteria. The results show that individual interviews are more valid than board interviews( 0.43 vs 0.32). This is true regardless of whether the individual interview is structured or unstructured.

When exploring the variance in interview validity between job performance, training performance, and tenure criteria, the researchers found that the interviews are similar in predictive accuracy for job-performance and training performance( 0.37 vs 0.36). But less predictive for tenure (0.20).

=== Validity of cognitive ability and personality tests ===
Based on meta-analysis results, cognitive ability tests appear to be among the most valid of all psychological tests and are valid for most occupations. However, these tests tend to do better at predicting training criteria than long term job performance. Cognitive ability tests in general provide the benefit of being generalizable. Hence they can be used across organizations and jobs and have been shown to produce large economic gains for companies that use them (Gatewood &amp; Feild, 1998; Heneman et al., 2000).

But despite the high validity of cognitive testing, it is less frequently used as selection tools. One main reason is that cognitive ability testing has been demonstrated to produce adverse impact. In general, groups including Hispanics and African-Americans score lower than the general population while other groups including Asian – Americans score higher (Heneman et al., 2000; Lubenski, 1995). The legal issues with cognitive ability testing were amplified by the supreme court's ruling in the famous 1971 Griggs v. Duke Power case. In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that when a selection test produces adverse impact against protected group members the company must be able to defend it by showing that use of the test is a "business necessity" for the operation of the business. The courts have held narrow interpretations of business necessity that require companies to show that no other acceptable selection alternative exists (Sovereign, 1999). As a result, many companies abandoned cognitive ability testing ( Steven L. Thomas &amp;Wesley A. Scroggins, 2006).

While the utility of cognitive ability testing in selection has been broadly accepted, the utility of personality testing, until relatively recently, has not. Historically, research documenting the low predictive validity and the potential for invasion of privacy based on item content has made its application as selection instruments questionable (Hogan, Hogan, &amp; Roberts, 1996).

But due to the legal challenges associated with cognitive ability, interest in personality instruments has recently been revived (Schmidt, Ones, &amp; Hunter, 1992). Some have suggested that pairing personality testing with cognitive ability testing may be one means to enhance validity while reducing adverse impact (Ryan, Ployhart, &amp; Friedel, 1998). Because it is very likely that some aspects of personality enhance individual ability to apply intellectual capacity while other personality traits limit its application (Kaufman &amp; Lichtenberger, 1999). Hence, adding a personality to an ability test should enhance validity while reducing the adverse impact of a selection system.

Recent research studies prove this assumption to be false, by showing that the addition of a predictor producing smaller group differences (i.e., personality test) to a predictor producing higher group differences (i.e., cognitive ability test) does not reduce the potential for adverse impact to the degree that is often expected (Bobko, Roth, &amp; Potosky, 1999; Schmitt, Rogers, Chan, Sheppard, &amp; Jennings, 1997).

Although the use of personality tests with measures of cognitive ability may not have the desired effects on reducing adverse impact, it appears that the addition of personality measures to measures of cognitive ability as a composite predictor results in significant incremental validity (Bobko et al., 1999; Schmitt et al.,1997). These studies found that the validity of predictor composites was highest when alternative predictors were used in combination with cognitive ability. Though this combination of predictors resulted in the highest predictive validity, the inclusion of cognitive ability with these alternative predictors increased the potential for adverse impact (Steven L. Thomas &amp; Wesley A. Scroggins, 2006).

In summary, cognitive ability testing by itself has been shown to have high levels of validity, but comes with issues relating to adverse impact. Personality tests, on the other hand, have historically been proven to have low validity due to the lack of a common understanding on what constitutes personality, and the non-standardized measures available. But a growing number of research  studies show that the best way for organizations to achieve close to optimal validity and job performance prediction, is to create a predictor composite that includes a measure of cognitive ability and an additional measure such as a personality test.

==Predictor validity and selection ratio==
Two major factors determine the quality of newly hired employees, [[predictive validity|predictor validity]] and [[selection ratio]].&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt; The predictor cutoff is a test score differentiating those passing a selection measure from those who did not. People above this score are hired or are further considered while those below it are not.

The selection ratio (SR), on the other hand is the number of job openings [[statistical sample|''n'']] divided by the number of job applicants ''N''. This value will range between 0 and 1, reflecting the selectivity of the organization's hiring practices. When the SR is equal to 1 or greater, the use of any selection device has little meaning, but this is not often the case as there are usually more applicants than job openings. Finally, the [[base rate]] is defined by the percentage of employees thought to be performing their jobs satisfactorily following measurement.

==Selection decisions==
Tests designed to determine an individual's aptitude for a particular position, company or industry may be referred to as personnel assessment tools. Such tests can aid those charged with hiring personnel in both selecting individuals for hire and in placing new hires in the appropriate positions. They vary in the measurements they use and level of standardization they employ, though all are subject to error.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Labor Employment and Training Administration. (1999) "Chapter 1: Personnel Assessment." pp. 1-7 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/psych304-3.1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Predictors for selection always have less than perfect validity and scatter plots, as well as other forecasting methods such as judgmental bootstrapping, and index models can help us to refine a prediction model as well as identify any mistakes.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Armstrong|first=J. Scott|last2=others|date=2012|title=Predicting job performance: The moneyball factor|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/J_Armstrong2/publication/254416540_Predicting_Job_Performance_The_Moneyball_Factor/links/0046352826eef7b0cc000000.pdf|journal=Foresight: The International Journal of Applied Forecasting|volume=25|pages=31–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criterion cutoff is the point separating successful and unsuccessful performers according to a standard set by the hiring organization. [[Type I and type II errors|True positives]] are applied those thought to succeed on the job as a result of having passed the selection test and who have, in fact, performed satisfactorily. True negatives describe those who were correctly rejected based on the measure because they would not be successful employees.

False negatives occur when people are rejected as a result of selection test failure, but would have performed well on the job anyway.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt; Finally, false positives are applied to individuals who are selected for having passed the selection measure, but do not make successful employees. These selection errors can be minimized by increasing the validity of the predictor test.

Standards for determination of the cutoff score vary widely, but should be set to be consistent with the expectations of the relevant job.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt; Adjusting the cutoff in either direction will automatically increase the error in the other. Thus, it is important to determine which type of error is more harmful on a case-by-case basis.

Banding is another method for setting cutoff values.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campion, M. A., Outtz, J. L., Zedeck, S., Schmidt, F. L., Kehoe, J. F., Murphy, K. R., &amp; Guion, R. M. (2001). [http://www.krannert.purdue.edu/faculty/campionm/Controversy_Score_Banding.pdf The controversy over score banding in personnel selection: Answers to 10 key questions]. ''Personnel Psychology'', '''54(1)''', 149–185.&lt;/ref&gt; Some differences in test scores are ignored as applicants whose scores fall with in the same band (or, range) are selected not on the basis of individual scores, but of another factor spas to reduce adverse impact. The width of the band itself is a function of test reliability, the two being negatively correlated. Banding allows employers to ignore test scores altogether by using random selection, and many have criticized the technique for this reason.

==Predicting job performance==
A meta-analysis of selection methods in personnel psychology found that [[g factor (psychometrics)|general mental ability]] was the best overall predictor of [[job performance]] and training performance.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, F. L. &amp; Hunter, J. E. (1998). [http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1998-10661-006&amp;CFID=5257837&amp;CFTOKEN=93267042 The validity and utility of selection methods in personnel psychology: Practical and theoretical implications of 85 years of research findings]. ''Psychological Bulletin'', '''124(2)''', 262-274.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding interview procedures, there are data which put into question these tools for selecting employees.&lt;ref&gt;McDaniel, M. A., Whetzel, D. L., Schmidt, F. L., &amp; Maurer, S. D. (1994).[http://www.people.vcu.edu/~mamcdani/Publications/McDaniel_Whetzel_Schmidt_Maurer%20(1994).pdf The validity of employment interview: A comprehensive review and meta-analysis]. ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', '''79(4)''', 599-616.&lt;/ref&gt; While the aim of a job interview is ostensibly to choose a candidate who will perform well in the job role, other methods of selection provide greater predictive power and often entail lower costs. Unstructured interviews are commonly used, but structured interviews tend to yield better outcomes and are considered a better practice.&lt;ref&gt;Huffcut, A. I. (2010). [http://www.xavier.edu/appliedhrmresearch/2010-Winter/Article_8_Huffcutt_Seven%20Principles.pdf From science to practice: Seven principles for conducting employment interviews]. ''Applied H.R.M. Research'', '''12''', 121-136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interview structure is defined as "the reduction in procedural variance across applicants, which can translate into the degree of discretion that an interviewer is allowed in conducting the interview."&lt;ref&gt;Huffcut, A. I., &amp; Hunter, W. Jr. (1994). [http://maamodt.asp.radford.edu/PSYC%20651/Huffcutt%20&amp;%20Arthur%20(1994)%20Interview.pdf Hunter &amp; Hunter revisited: Interview validity for entry-level jobs]. '' Journal of Applied Psychology'', '''79''', 184-190.&lt;/ref&gt; Structure in an interview can be compared to a typical paper and pencil test: we would not think it was fair if every test taker were given different questions and a different number of questions on an exam, or if their answers were each graded differently. Yet this is exactly what occurs in an unstructured interview; thus, a structured interview attempts to standardize this popular selection tool.

Multiple studies and meta-analyses have also been conducted to look at the relationship between [[organizational citizenship behavior| organizational citizenship behavior (OCB)]] and organizational performance and success.&lt;ref name=Muchinsky/&gt;&lt;ref name=Podsakoff&gt;Podsakoff, N. P., Whiting, S. W., Podsakoff, P. M., &amp; Mishra, P. (2011). [http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=pdh&amp;AN=apl-96-2-310&amp;site=ehost-live Effects of organizational citizenship behaviors on selection decisions in employment interviews]. ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', '''96(2)''', 310-326.&lt;/ref&gt; Job candidates exhibiting higher levels of helping, voice, and loyalty behaviors were generally rated as more confident, received higher salaries, and received higher salary recommendations than job candidates exhibiting these behaviors to a lesser degree.&lt;ref name=Podsakoff/&gt; This was found to be true even candidate responses regarding task performance were taken into account. Finally, content analyses of open-ended question responses indicated selection decisions were highly sensitive to candidates with low expression of voice and helping behaviors.

'''''Principles of Compiler Design''''', by [[Alfred Aho]] and [[Jeffrey Ullman]], is a classic textbook on [[compiler]]s for [[computer]] [[programming language]]s.

It is often called the "dragon book"&lt;ref name="Macz2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mad Macz|title=Internet Underground: The Way of the Hacker|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q5OHEW8_gysC&amp;pg=PA219|accessdate=21 October 2011|date=January 2002|publisher=PageFree Publishing, Inc.|isbn=978-1-930252-53-0|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and its cover depicts a [[knight]] and a [[European dragon|dragon]] in battle; the dragon is green, and labeled "Complexity of Compiler Construction", while the knight wields a lance and a shield labeled "[[LALR parser generator]]" and "Syntax Directed Translation" respectively, and rides a horse labeled "Data Flow Analysis". The book may be called the "green dragon book" to distinguish it from its successor, Aho, Sethi &amp; Ullman's ''[[Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools]]'', which is the "red dragon book".&lt;ref name="Macz2002" /&gt;  The second edition of ''Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools'' added a fourth author, [[Monica S. Lam]], and the dragon became purple; hence becoming the "purple dragon book." The book also contains the entire code for making a compiler.

The back cover offers the original inspiration of the cover design: The dragon is replaced by windmills, and the knight is [[Don Quixote]].

The book was published by [[Addison-Wesley]], {{ISBN|0-201-00022-9}}. The acknowledgments mention that the book was entirely typeset at [[Bell Labs]] using [[troff]] on the [[Unix]] [[operating system]], little of which had, at that time, been seen outside the Laboratories.

{{Fundamental info units}}

In [[quantum computing]], a '''qubit'''&amp;nbsp;({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|juː|b|ɪ|t}})&amp;nbsp;or '''quantum bit'''&amp;nbsp;(sometimes '''qbit''') is the basic unit of [[quantum information]]—the quantum version of the classical binary [[bit]] physically realized with a two-state device.  A qubit is a [[Two-state quantum system|two-state (or two-level) quantum-mechanical system]], one of the simplest quantum systems displaying the weirdness of quantum mechanics.  Examples include: the [[spin (physics)|spin]] of the electron in which the two levels can be taken as spin up and spin down; or the [[Photon polarization|polarization]] of a single [[photon]] in which the two states can be taken to be the vertical polarization and the horizontal polarization. In a classical system, a bit would have to be in one state or the other. However, quantum mechanics allows the qubit to be in a coherent [[Quantum superposition|superposition]]&amp;nbsp;of both states/levels at the same time, a property that is fundamental to quantum mechanics and thus quantum computing.

==Etymology==
The coining of the term ''qubit'' is attributed to [[Benjamin Schumacher]].&lt;ref name="schumacher1995"&gt;
{{cite journal
 |author=B. Schumacher | authorlink=Benjamin Schumacher
 |year=1995
 |title=Quantum coding
 |journal=[[Physical Review A]]
 |volume=51 |pages=2738–2747
 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.51.2738
|bibcode = 1995PhRvA..51.2738S
 |issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the acknowledgments of his 1995 paper, Schumacher states that the term ''qubit'' was created in jest during a conversation with [[William Wootters]].  The paper describes a way of compressing states emitted by a quantum source of information so that they require fewer physical resources to store.  This procedure is now known as [[Schumacher compression]].

==Bit versus qubit==
A [[binary digit]], characterized as 0 and 1, is used to represent information in classical computers. A binary digit can represent up to one bit of [[Shannon information]], where a [[bit]] is the basic unit of [[information theory|information]].  
However, in this article, the word bit is synonymous with binary digit.

In classical computer technologies, a ''processed'' bit is implemented by one of two levels of low [[Direct Current|DC]] [[voltage]], and whilst switching from one of these two levels to the other, a so-called [[forbidden zone]] must be passed as fast as possible, as electrical voltage cannot change from one level to another ''instantaneously''.

There are two possible outcomes for the measurement of a qubit&amp;mdash;usually taken to have the value "0" and "1", like a bit or binary digit. However, whereas the state of a bit can only be either 0 or 1, the general state of a qubit according to quantum mechanics can be a [[Quantum superposition|coherent superposition]]&amp;nbsp;of both.&lt;ref name="nielsen2010"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nielsen |first1=Michael A. | last2=Chuang | first2=Isaac L. |date=2010 |title=[[Quantum Computation and Quantum Information (book)|Quantum Computation and Quantum Information]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |page=13 |isbn=978-1-107-00217-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, whereas a measurement of a classical bit would not disturb its state, a measurement of a qubit would destroy its coherence and irrevocably disturb the superposition state.  It is possible to fully encode one bit in one qubit. However, a qubit can hold more information, e.g. up to two bits using [[superdense coding]].

For a system of ''n'' components, a complete description of its state in classical physics requires only ''n'' bits, whereas in quantum physics it requires 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;−1 complex numbers.&lt;ref name="shor1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shor|first1=Peter|title=Polynomial-Time Algorithms for Prime Factorization and Discrete Logarithms on a Quantum Computer∗|date=1996|arxiv=quant-ph/9508027|bibcode=1995quant.ph..8027S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standard Representation==
In quantum mechanics, the general [[quantum state]] of a qubit can be represented by a linear superposition of its two orthonormal [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] states (or basis [[vector space|vector]]s). These vectors are usually denoted as
&lt;math&gt;| 0 \rangle = \bigl[\begin{smallmatrix}
1\\
0
\end{smallmatrix}\bigr]&lt;/math&gt;
and 
&lt;math&gt;| 1 \rangle = \bigl[\begin{smallmatrix}
0\\
1
\end{smallmatrix}\bigr]&lt;/math&gt;.  They are written in the conventional [[List of things named after Paul Dirac|Dirac]]—or [[bra–ket notation|"bra–ket"]]—notation; the &lt;math&gt;| 0 \rangle &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;| 1 \rangle &lt;/math&gt; are pronounced "ket 0" and "ket 1", respectively.  These two orthonormal basis states, &lt;math&gt;\{|0\rangle,|1\rangle\}&lt;/math&gt;, together called the computational basis, are said to span the two-dimensional [[Hilbert space|linear vector (Hilbert) space]] of the qubit.

Qubit basis states can also be combined to form product basis states. For example, two qubits could be represented in a four-dimensional linear vector space spanned by the following product basis states:
&lt;math&gt;| 00 \rangle = \biggl[\begin{smallmatrix}
1\\
0\\
0\\
0
\end{smallmatrix}\biggr]&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;| 01 \rangle = \biggl[\begin{smallmatrix}
0\\
1\\
0\\
0
\end{smallmatrix}\biggr]&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;| 10 \rangle = \biggl[\begin{smallmatrix}
0\\
0\\
1\\
0
\end{smallmatrix}\biggr]&lt;/math&gt;, and 
&lt;math&gt;| 11 \rangle = \biggl[\begin{smallmatrix}
0\\
0\\
0\\
1
\end{smallmatrix}\biggr]&lt;/math&gt;.

In general, ''n'' qubits are represented by a superposition state vector in 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;-dimensional Hilbert space.

==Qubit states==

{{Unsolved|physics|Is it possible to have three-dimensional, [[Stabilizer code|self-correcting]], quantum memory?}}

A pure qubit state is a coherent [[quantum superposition|superposition]] of the basis states. This means that a single qubit can be described by a [[linear combination]] of &lt;math&gt;|0 \rangle &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|1 \rangle &lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;| \psi \rangle = \alpha |0 \rangle + \beta |1 \rangle  &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;var&gt;α&lt;/var&gt; and &lt;var&gt;β&lt;/var&gt; are [[probability amplitude]]s and can in general both be [[complex number]]s.
When we measure this qubit in the standard basis, according to the [[Born rule]], the probability of outcome &lt;math&gt;|0 \rangle &lt;/math&gt; with value "0" is &lt;math&gt;| \alpha |^2&lt;/math&gt;  and the probability of outcome  &lt;math&gt;|1 \rangle &lt;/math&gt;  with value "1" is &lt;math&gt;| \beta |^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Because the absolute squares of the amplitudes equate to probabilities, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; must be constrained by the equation

: &lt;math&gt;| \alpha |^2 + | \beta |^2 = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that a qubit in this superposition state does not have a value in between "0" and "1"; rather, when measured, the qubit has a probability &lt;math&gt;| \alpha |^2&lt;/math&gt; of the value “0” and a probability &lt;math&gt;| \beta |^2&lt;/math&gt; of the value "1".  In other words, superposition means that there is no way, even in principle, to tell which of the two possible states forming the superposition state actually pertains.  Furthermore, the probability amplitudes, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, encode more than just the probabilities of the outcomes of a measurement; the ''relative phase'' of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is responsible for [[wave interference|quantum interference]], ''e.g.'', as seen in the [[Double-slit experiment|two-slit experiment]].

===Bloch sphere representation===

[[File:Bloch sphere.svg|thumb|[[Bloch sphere]] representation of a qubit. The probability amplitudes for the superposition state, &lt;math&gt;| \psi \rangle = \alpha |0 \rangle + \beta |1 \rangle,\,&lt;/math&gt; are given by &lt;math&gt; \alpha = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \beta = e^{i \phi}  \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) &lt;/math&gt;.]]

It might, at first sight, seem that there should be four [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] in &lt;math&gt;| \psi \rangle = \alpha |0 \rangle + \beta |1 \rangle\,&lt;/math&gt;, as &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are [[complex number]]s with two degrees of freedom each. However, one degree of freedom is removed by the normalization constraint {{math|{{!}}''α''{{!}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + {{!}}''β''{{!}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 1}}.  This means, with a suitable change of coordinates, one can eliminate one of the degrees of freedom.  One possible choice is that of [[3-sphere#Hopf coordinates|Hopf coordinates]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\alpha &amp;= e^{i \psi} \cos\frac{\theta}{2}, \\
\beta &amp;= e^{i (\psi + \phi)} \sin\frac{\theta}{2}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Additionally, for a single qubit the overall [[phase factor|phase]] of the state {{math|''e&lt;sup&gt;i ψ&lt;/sup&gt;''}} has no physically observable consequences, so we can arbitrarily choose {{math|''α''}} to be real (or {{math|''β''}} in the case that {{math|''α''}} is zero), leaving just two degrees of freedom:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\alpha &amp;= \cos\frac{\theta}{2}, \\
\beta &amp;= e^{i \phi} \sin\frac{\theta}{2},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt; e^{i \phi} &lt;/math&gt; is the physically significant ''relative phase''.

The possible quantum states for a single qubit can be visualised using a [[Bloch sphere]] (see diagram). Represented on such a [[2-sphere]], a classical bit could only be at the "North Pole" or the "South Pole", in the locations where &lt;math&gt;|0 \rangle &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|1 \rangle &lt;/math&gt; are respectively. This particular choice of the polar axis is arbitrary, however.  The rest of the surface of the Bloch sphere is inaccessible to a classical bit, but a pure qubit state can be represented by any point on the surface. For example, the pure qubit state &lt;math&gt;((|0 \rangle +i|1 \rangle)/{\sqrt{2}}) &lt;/math&gt; would lie on the equator of the sphere at the positive y axis.  In the [[classical limit]], a qubit, which can have quantum states anywhere on the Bloch sphere, reduces to the classical bit, which can be found only at either poles.

The surface of the Bloch sphere is a [[two-dimensional space]], which represents the [[state space (physics)|state space]] of the pure qubit states. This state space has two local degrees of freedom, which can be represented by the two angles &lt;math&gt;\phi &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta &lt;/math&gt;.

===Mixed state ===
A pure state is one fully specified by a single ket, &lt;math&gt;| \psi \rangle = \alpha |0 \rangle + \beta |1 \rangle,\,&lt;/math&gt; a coherent superposition as described above.  The important point is that coherence is essential for a qubit to be in a superposition state.  With interactions and [[decoherence]], it is possible to put the qubit in a [[Mixed state (physics)|mixed state]], a statistical combination or incoherent mixture of different pure states. Mixed states can be represented by points ''inside'' the Bloch sphere (or in the Bloch ball). A mixed qubit state has three degrees of freedom: the angles &lt;math&gt;\phi &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta &lt;/math&gt;, as well as the length &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; of the vector that represents the mixed state.

===Operations on pure qubit states===
There are various kinds of physical operations that can be performed on pure qubit states.
* [[Quantum logic gate]]s, building blocks for a [[quantum circuit]] in a [[quantum computing|quantum computer]], operate on one, two, or three qubits: mathematically, the qubits undergo a (reversible) [[unitary transformation]] under the quantum gate. For a single qubit, unitary transformations correspond to rotations of the qubit (unit) vector on the Bloch sphere to specific superpositions.  For two qubits, the [[Controlled NOT gate]] can be used to entangle or disentangle them.
* [[Quantum measurement|Standard basis measurement]] is an irreversible operation in which information is gained about the state of a single qubit (and coherence is lost). The result of the measurement will be either &lt;math&gt;| 0 \rangle &lt;/math&gt; (with probability &lt;math&gt;|\alpha|^2&lt;/math&gt;) or &lt;math&gt;| 1 \rangle &lt;/math&gt; (with probability &lt;math&gt;|\beta|^2&lt;/math&gt;). Measurement of the state of the qubit alters the magnitudes of &lt;var&gt;α&lt;/var&gt; and &lt;var&gt;β&lt;/var&gt;.  For instance, if the result of the measurement is &lt;math&gt;| 1 \rangle &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;var&gt;α&lt;/var&gt; is changed to 0 and &lt;var&gt;β&lt;/var&gt; is changed to the phase factor &lt;math&gt; e^{i \phi} &lt;/math&gt; no longer experimentally accessible.  Thus when a qubit is measured, the superposition state collapses to a basis state (up to a phase) and the relative phase is rendered inaccessible (i.e., coherence is lost).  Note that a measurement of a qubit state that is entangled with another quantum system transforms the qubit state, a pure state, into a [[Mixed state (physics)|mixed state]] (an incoherent mixture of pure states) as the relative phase of the qubit state is rendered inaccessible.

==Quantum Entanglement==
An important distinguishing feature between qubits and classical bits is that multiple qubits can exhibit [[quantum entanglement]]. Quantum entanglement is a [[quantum nonlocality|nonlocal]] property of two or more qubits that allows a set of qubits to express higher correlation than is possible in classical systems.

The simplest system to display quantum entanglement is the system of two qubits.  Consider, for example, two entangled qubits in the &lt;math&gt;|\Phi^+\rangle&lt;/math&gt; [[Bell state]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|00\rangle + |11\rangle).&lt;/math&gt;

In this state, called an ''equal superposition'', there are equal probabilities of measuring either product state &lt;math&gt;|00\rangle&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;|11\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, as &lt;math&gt;|1/\sqrt{2}|^2 = 1/2&lt;/math&gt;.  In other words, there is no way to tell if the first qubit has value “0” or “1” and likewise for the second qubit.

Imagine that these two entangled qubits are separated, with one each given to Alice and Bob.  Alice makes a measurement of her qubit, obtaining&amp;mdash;with equal probabilities&amp;mdash;either &lt;math&gt;|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., she can not tell if her qubit has value “0” or “1”.  Because of the qubits' entanglement, Bob must now get exactly the same measurement as Alice.  For example, if she measures a &lt;math&gt;|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, Bob must measure the same, as &lt;math&gt;|00\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the only state where Alice's qubit is a &lt;math&gt;|0\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.  In short, for these two entangled qubits, whatever Alice measures, so would Bob, with ''perfect'' correlation, in any basis, however far apart they may be and even though both can not tell if their qubit has value “0” or “1” — a most surprising circumstance that can ''not'' be explained by classical physics.

===Controlled gate to construct the Bell state===

[[Quantum logic gate|Controlled gates]] act on 2 or more qubits, where one or more qubits act as a control for some specified operation. In particular, the [[controlled NOT gate]] (or CNOT or cX) acts on 2 qubits, and performs the NOT operation on the second qubit only when the first qubit is &lt;math&gt;|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, and otherwise leaves it unchanged. With respect to the unentangled product basis &lt;math&gt;\{|00\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;|01\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;|10\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;|11\rangle\}&lt;/math&gt;, it maps the basis states as follows:
:&lt;math&gt; | 0 0 \rangle \mapsto | 0 0 \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; | 0 1 \rangle \mapsto | 0 1 \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; | 1 0 \rangle \mapsto | 1 1 \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; | 1 1 \rangle \mapsto | 1 0 \rangle &lt;/math&gt;.

A common application of the C&lt;sub&gt;NOT&lt;/sub&gt; gate is to maximally entangle two qubits into the &lt;math&gt;|\Phi^+\rangle&lt;/math&gt; [[Bell state]].  To construct &lt;math&gt;|\Phi^+\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, the inputs A (control) and B (target) to the C&lt;sub&gt;NOT&lt;/sub&gt; gate are:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle)_A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|0\rangle_B&lt;/math&gt;

After applying C&lt;sub&gt;NOT&lt;/sub&gt;, the output is the &lt;math&gt;|\Phi^+\rangle&lt;/math&gt; Bell State: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle + |11\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Applications===

The &lt;math&gt;|\Phi^+\rangle&lt;/math&gt; [[Bell state]] forms part of the setup of the [[superdense coding]], [[quantum teleportation]], and entangled [[quantum cryptography]] algorithms.

Quantum entanglement also allows multiple states (such as the [[Bell state]] mentioned above) to be acted on simultaneously, unlike classical bits that can only have one value at a time.  Entanglement is a necessary ingredient of any quantum computation that cannot be done efficiently on a classical computer.  Many of the successes of quantum computation and communication, such as [[quantum teleportation]] and [[superdense coding]], make use of entanglement, suggesting that entanglement is a [[Computational resource|resource]] that is unique to quantum computation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horodecki|first=Ryszard et al.|date=2009|title=Quantum entanglement|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/RevModPhys.81.865|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|volume=81|issue=2|pages=865–942|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.81.865|arxiv=quant-ph/0702225|bibcode=2009RvMP...81..865H}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A major hurdle facing quantum computing, as of 2018, in its quest to surpass classical digital computing, is noise in quantum gates that limits the size of quantum circuits that can be executed reliably.&lt;ref name="preskill2018"&gt;{{cite arxiv |last1=Preskill |first1=John |date=2018|title=Quantum Computing in the NISQ era and beyond |eprint=1801.00862 |class=quant-ph }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantum register==
A number of qubits taken together is a [[quantum register|qubit register]]. [[Quantum computer]]s perform calculations by manipulating qubits within a register. A '''qubyte''' (quantum byte) is a collection of eight qubits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Variations of the qubit===
Similar to the qubit, the [[qutrit]] is the unit of quantum information that can be realized in suitable 3-level quantum systems.  This is analogous to the unit of classical information [[trit (computing)|trit]] of [[ternary computer]]s.  Note, however, that not all 3-level quantum systems are qutrits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/342903/quantum-systems-three-level-vs-qutrit|title=Quantum systems: three-level vs qutrit|website=Physics Stack Exchange|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "'''qu-''d''-it'''" ('''''qu'''antum'' '''d'''''-g'''it''''') denotes the unit of quantum information that can be realized in suitable ''d''-level quantum systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nisbet-Jones|first=Peter B.

==Physical implementations==

Any [[two-state quantum system|two-level quantum-mechanical system]] can be used as a qubit. Multilevel systems can be used as well, if they possess two states that can be effectively decoupled from the rest (e.g., ground state and first excited state of a nonlinear oscillator). There are various proposals. Several physical implementations that approximate two-level systems to various degrees were successfully realized. Similarly to a classical bit where the state of a transistor in a processor, the magnetization of a surface in a [[hard disk]] and the presence of current in a cable can all be used to represent bits in the same computer, an eventual quantum computer is likely to use various combinations of qubits in its design.

The following is an incomplete list of physical implementations of qubits, and the choices of basis are by convention only.

'''Ronald Newbold Bracewell''' [[Order of Australia|AO]] (22 July 1921 &amp;ndash; 12 August 2007) was the [[Lewis M. Terman]] Professor of Electrical Engineering of the Space, Telecommunications, and Radioscience Laboratory at [[Stanford University]].

== Education ==

Bracewell was born in [[Sydney]], Australia, in 1921, and educated at [[Sydney Boys High School]]. He graduated from the [[University of Sydney]] in 1941 with the [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]] degree in mathematics and physics, later receiving the degrees of [[Bachelor of Engineering|B.E.]] (1943), and [[Master of Engineering|M.E.]] (1948) with [[first class honours]], and while working in the Engineering Department became the President of the [[Oxometrical society|Oxometrical Society]].  During [[World War II]] he designed and developed microwave radar equipment in the Radiophysics Laboratory of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Sydney under the direction of [[Joseph Lade Pawsey|Joseph L. Pawsey]] and [[Edward George Bowen|Edward G. Bowen]] and from 1946 to 1949 was a research student at [[Sidney Sussex College]], [[Cambridge]], engaged in [[ionosphere|ionospheric]] research in the [[Cavendish Laboratory]], where in 1949 he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in physics under [[J. A. Ratcliffe]].

== Career ==

From October 1949 to September 1954, Dr. Bracewell was a senior research officer at the Radiophysics Laboratory of the [[CSIRO]], Sydney, concerned with very-long-wave propagation and [[radio astronomy]]. He then lectured in radio astronomy at the Astronomy Department of the [[University of California, Berkeley]], from September 1954 to June 1955 at the invitation of [[Otto Struve]], and at Stanford University during the summer of 1955, and joined the Electrical Engineering faculty at Stanford in December 1955.

In 1974 he was appointed the first Lewis M. Terman Professor and Fellow in Electrical Engineering (1974–1979).  Though he retired in 1979, he continued to be active until his death.

== Contributions and honours ==

Professor Bracewell was a Fellow of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] (1950), Fellow and life member of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers]] (1961), Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (1989), and was a Fellow with other significant societies and organisations.

For experimental contributions to the study of the ionosphere by means of very low frequency waves, Dr. Bracewell received the  Duddell Premium of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, London in 1952. In 1992 he was elected to foreign associate membership of the [[Institute of Medicine]] of the U.S. [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (1992), the first Australian to achieve that distinction, for fundamental contributions to medical imaging. He was one of Sydney University's three honourees when alumni awards were instituted in 1992, with a citation for brain scanning, and was the 1994 recipient of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers' Heinrich Hertz medal for pioneering work in antenna [[aperture synthesis]] and image reconstruction as applied to radio astronomy and to computer-assisted tomography. In 1998 Dr. Bracewell was named Officer of the [[Order of Australia]] (AO) for service to science in the fields of radio astronomy and image reconstruction.

At CSIRO Radiophysics Laboratory, work that in 1942–1945 was classified appeared in a dozen reports. Activities included design, construction, and demonstration of voice-modulation equipment for a 10&amp;nbsp;cm magnetron (July 1943), a microwave triode oscillator at 25&amp;nbsp;cm using cylindrical cavity resonators, equipment designed for microwave radar in field use (wavemeter, echo box, thermistor power meter, etc.) and microwave measurement technique. Experience with numerical computation of fields in cavities led, after the war, to a Master of Engineering degree (1948) and the definitive publication on step discontinuities in radial transmission lines (1954).

While at the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge (1946–1950) Bracewell worked on observation and theory of upper atmospheric ionisation, contributing to experimental technique (1948), explaining solar effects (1949), and distinguishing two layers below the E-layer (1952), work recognised by the Duddell Premium.

At Stanford Professor Bracewell constructed a microwave spectroheliograph (1961), a large and complex radio telescope which produced daily temperature maps of the sun reliably for eleven years, the duration of a solar cycle.  The first [[radio telescope]] to give output automatically in printed form, and therefore capable of worldwide dissemination by teleprinter, its daily solar weather maps received acknowledgement from [[NASA]] for support of the first manned landing on the moon.

Many fundamental papers on restoration (1954–1962), [[interferometry]] (1958–1974) and reconstruction (1956–1961) appeared along with instrumental and observational papers.  By 1961 the radio-interferometer calibration techniques developed for the [[spectroheliograph]] first allowed an antenna system, with 52-inch fan beam, to equal the angular resolution of the human eye in one observation.  With this beam the components of [[Cygnus A]], spaced 100-inch, were put directly in evidence without the need for repeated observations with variable spacing [[aperture synthesis]] interferometry.

The nucleus of the extragalactic source [[Centaurus A]] was resolved into two separate components whose right ascensions were accurately determined with a 2.3-minute fan beam at 9.1&amp;nbsp;cm.  Knowing that Centaurus A was composite, Bracewell used the 6.7-minute beam of the [[Parkes Observatory]] 64 m [[radiotelescope]] at 10&amp;nbsp;cm to determine the separate declinations of the components and in so doing was the first to observe strong polarisation in an extragalactic source (1962), a discovery of fundamental significance for the structure and role of astrophysical magnetic fields. Subsequent observations made at Parkes by other observers with a 14-minute and wider beams at [[21 cm line|21 cm]] and longer wavelengths, though not resolving the components, were compatible with the &lt;math&gt;\lambda^2&lt;/math&gt; dependence expected from Faraday rotation if magnetic fields were the polarising agent.

A second major radiotelescope (1971) employing advanced concepts to achieve an angular resolution of 18 seconds of arc was designed and built at Stanford and applied to both solar and galactic studies. The calibration techniques for this leading-edge resolution passed into general use in radio interferometry via the medium of alumni.

Upon the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation|cosmic background radiation]]:
* a remarkable observational limit of 1.7 millikelvins, with considerable theoretical significance for cosmology, was set on the anisotropy in collaboration with Ph.D. student [[E. K. Conklin]] (1967), and was not improved on for many years
* the correct theory of a relativistic observer in a blackbody enclosure (1968) was given in the first of several papers by various authors obtaining the same result
* the absolute motion of the [[Sun]] at 308&amp;nbsp;km/s through the cosmic background radiation was measured by Conklin in 1969, some years before independent confirmation.

With the advent of the space age, Bracewell became interested in [[celestial mechanics]], made observations of the radio emission from [[Sputnik 1]], and supplied the press with accurate charts predicting the path of Soviet satellites, which were perfectly visible, if you knew when and where to look. Following the puzzling performance of [[Explorer I]] in orbit, he published the first explanation (1958-9) of the observed spin instability of satellites, in terms of the Poinsot motion of a non-rigid body with internal friction. He recorded the signals from Sputniks I, II and III and discussed them in terms of the satellite spin, antenna polarisation, and propagation effects of the ionised medium, especially Faraday effect.

Later (1978, 1979) he invented a spinning, [[Nuller|nulling]], two-element infrared interferometer suitable for space-shuttle launching into an orbit near [[Jupiter]], with milliarcsecond resolution, that could lead to the discovery of [[Extrasolar planet|planets around stars other than the sun]].  This concept was elaborated in 1995 by Angel and Woolf, whose space-station version with four-element double nulling became the [[Terrestrial Planet Finder]] (TPF), NASA's candidate for imaging planetary configurations of other stars.&lt;ref&gt;''Scientific American'', April 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Imaging in astronomy led to participation in development of computer assisted x-ray tomography, where commercial scanners reconstruct tomographic images using the algorithm developed by Bracewell for radioastronomical reconstruction from fan-beam scans. This corpus of work has been recognized by the Institute of Medicine, an award by the [[University of Sydney]], and the Heinrich Hertz medal. Service on the founding editorial board of the ''Journal for Computer-Assisted Tomography'', to which he also contributed publications, and on the scientific advisory boards of medical instrumentation companies maintained Bracewell's interest in medical imaging, which became an important part of his regular graduate lectures on imaging, and forms an important part of his 1995 text on imaging.

Experience with the optics, mechanics and control of radiotelescopes led to involvement with solar thermophotovoltaic energy at the time of the energy crisis, including the fabrication of low-cost solid and perforated paraboloidal reflectors by hydraulic inflation.

Bracewell is also known for being the first to propose the use of autonomous [[interstellar probe|interstellar]] [[space probes]] for communication between alien civilisations as an alternative to [[radio]] transmission dialogs. This hypothetical concept has been dubbed the [[Bracewell probe]] after its inventor.

=== Fourier analysis ===

As a consequence of relating images to [[Fourier analysis]], in 1983 he discovered a [[Discrete Hartley transform|new factorisation of the discrete Fourier transform]] matrix leading to a fast algorithm for spectral analysis. This method, which has advantages over the fast Fourier algorithm, especially for images, is treated in ''[[Hartley transform|The Hartley Transform]]'' (1986), in U.S. Patent 4,646,256 (1987, now in the public domain), and in over 200 technical papers by various authors that were stimulated by the discovery. Analogue methods of creating a Hartley transform plane first with light and later with microwaves were demonstrated in the laboratory and permitted the determination of electromagnetic phase by the use of square-law detectors.  A new elementary signal representation, the [[Chirplet transform]], was discovered (1991) that complements the Gabor elementary signal representations used in dynamic spectral analysis (with the property of meeting the bandwidth-duration minimum associated with the [[uncertainty principle]]). This advance opened a new field of adaptive dynamic spectra with wide application in information analysis.

Professor Bracewell was interested in conveying an appreciation of the role of science in society to the public, in mitigating the effects of scientific illiteracy on public decision making through contact with alumni groups, and in liberal undergraduate education within the framework of the Astronomy Course Program and the Western Culture program in Values, Technology, Science and Society, in both of which he taught for some years.  He gave the 1996 Bunyan Lecture on ''The Destiny of Man''.

He was also interested in the trees of Stanford's campus and published a book about them. He also taught an undergraduate seminar titled I Dig Trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trees.stanford.edu/ |title=Trees of Stanford |publisher=Trees.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/march30/trees-033005.html |title=More than 350 tree species on campus cataloged by professor in new book |publisher=News-service.stanford.edu |date=30 March 2005 |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bracewell was also a designer and builder of [[sundial]]s. He and his son Mark Bracewell built one on the South side of the Terman Engineering Building; after that building was demolished, a new home for the sundial, at the same orientation, was found on the [[Jen-Hsun Huang Engineering Center]]. He built another sundial at the home of his son, and another on the deck of professor [[John G. Linvill]]'s house.  The Bracewell Radio Sundial at the [[Very Large Array#Tourism|Very Large Array]] was built in his honor.

'''''Science Made Stupid: How to Discomprehend the World Around Us''''' is a 1985 book written and illustrated by [[Tom Weller]].  The winner of the 1986 [[Hugo Award for Best Non-Fiction Book]], it is a [[parody]] of a [[junior high]] or [[high school]]-level science [[textbook]].  Though now out of print, [http://www.chrispennello.com/tweller/ high-resolution scans] are available online, as well as [http://www.besse.at/sms/smsintro.html an abridged transcription], both of which have been endorsed by Weller [http://www.tweller.com/].  Highlights of the book include a satirical account of the [[creationism]] vs. [[evolution]] debate and Weller's drawings of fictional prehistoric animals (e.g., the duck-billed [[mastodon]].)

Weller released a companion volume, ''[[Culture Made Stupid]]'' (also spelled ''Cvltvre Made Stvpid''), which satirizes [[literature]] and the [[humanities]].

The '''Shuttle Carrier Aircraft''' ('''SCA''') are two extensively modified [[Boeing 747]] airliners that [[NASA]] used to transport [[Space Shuttle orbiter]]s. One is a 747-100 model, while the other is a short range 747-100SR.

The SCAs were used to ferry Space Shuttles from landing sites back to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at the [[Kennedy Space Center]]. The orbiters were placed on top of the SCAs by [[Mate-Demate Device]]s, large [[Gantry crane|gantry]]-like structures that hoisted the orbiters off the ground for post-flight servicing then mated them with the SCAs for ferry flights.

In approach and landing test flights conducted in 1977, the [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|test shuttle ''Enterprise'']] was released from an SCA during flight and glided to a landing under its own control.&lt;ref name="ff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/ABSTRACTS/GPN-2000-000218.html|title=Shuttle Enterprise Free Flight|accessdate=November 28, 2007|publisher=NASA|year=1977|author=NASA - Dryden Flight Research Center|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307094536/http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/ABSTRACTS/GPN-2000-000218.html|archivedate=March 7, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and development==
The [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy]] was considered for the shuttle-carrier role by NASA, but rejected in favor of the 747. This was due to the 747's low-wing design in comparison to the C-5's high-wing design, and also because the [[U.S. Air Force]] would have retained ownership of the C-5, while NASA could own the 747s outright.

[[File:Shuttle Enterprise at Ellington Airfield 1978 4.jpg|thumb|left|Shuttle Carrier Aircraft N905NA, in [[American Airlines]] livery, with ''Enterprise'' in 1978]]

The first aircraft, a Boeing 747-123 registered N905NA, was originally manufactured for [[American Airlines]] and still carried visible American [[cheatline]]s while testing [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']] in the 1970s. It was acquired in 1974 and initially used for trailing wake vortex research as part of a broader study by [[Dryden Flight Research Center|NASA Dryden]], as well as Shuttle tests involving an [[F-104 Starfighter|F-104]] flying in close formation and simulating a release from the 747. 

The aircraft was extensively modified for NASA by Boeing in 1976.&lt;ref name="Jenkins_2000_p36"&gt;Jenkins 2000, pp. 36-38.&lt;/ref&gt; While first-class seats were kept for NASA passengers, its main cabin and insulation were stripped,{{r|brack20120917}} mounting struts were added, and the fuselage was strengthened. Vertical stabilizers were added to the tail to aid stability when the Orbiter was being carried.  The [[Avionics]] and engines were also upgraded, and an escape tunnel system similar to that used on Boeing's first 747 test flights was added. The flight crew escape tunnel system was later removed following the completion of the Approach and Landing Tests (ALT) due to concerns over possible engine ingestion of an escaping crew member.

[[File:Shuttle mate demate facility.jpg|thumb|''Atlantis'' being mated to SCA N911NA at Dryden Flight Research Center]]

Flying with the additional drag and weight of the Orbiter imposed significant fuel and altitude penalties. The range was reduced to 1,000 nautical miles (1,850&amp;nbsp;km), compared to an unladen range of 5500 nautical miles (10,100&amp;nbsp;km), requiring an SCA to stop several times to refuel on a transcontinental flight.&lt;ref name="Jenkins_2000_p38"&gt;Jenkins 2000, pp. 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt; Without the Orbiter, the SCA needed to carry [[ballast]] to balance out its center of gravity.&lt;ref name="brack20120917"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2012/09/17/inside-the-space-shuttle-carrier-aircraft/ | title=Inside the Space Shuttle Carrier Aircraft | publisher=National Geographic | date=2012-09-17 | accessdate=September 17, 2012 | author=Brack, Jon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SCA had an altitude ceiling of 15,000 feet and a maximum cruise speed of Mach 0.6 with the orbiter attached.&lt;ref name="Jenkins_2000_p38"/&gt; A crew of 170 took a week to prepare the shuttle and SCA for flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Felix Gilette | url = http://www.slate.com/id/2124238/fr/rss/ | title = How Does the Space Shuttle Fly Home? | date = 9 August 2005 | accessdate=2007-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies were conducted to equip the SCA with [[aerial refueling]] equipment, a modification already made to the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[Boeing E-4|E-4]] (modified 747-200s) and 747 tanker transports for the [[IIAF]]. However, during formation flying with a tanker aircraft to test refueling approaches, minor cracks were spotted on the tailfin of N905NA. While these were not likely to have been caused by the test flights, it was felt that there was no sense taking unnecessary risks.  Since there was no urgent need to provide an aerial refueling capacity, the tests were suspended.
[[File:STS Challenger on 747 SCA.jpg|thumb|Carrier 905 with the newly-built [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] over Dryden, 1982]] 
By 1983, SCA N905NA no longer carried the distinct American Airlines tricolor [[cheatline]]. NASA replaced it with its own livery, consisting of a white fuselage and a single blue cheatline.&lt;ref&gt;Comparison of photos taken in [http://www.airliners.net/search/photo.search?aircraft_genericsearch=%3Dboeing%5C+747*&amp;airlinesearch=NASA&amp;countrysearch=&amp;specialsearch=&amp;daterange=1982&amp;keywords=&amp;range=&amp;sort_order=datestamp+desc&amp;page_limit=15&amp;thumbnails=&amp;searchSubmit=Searching%2C+please+wait... 1982] and [http://www.airliners.net/search/photo.search?aircraft_genericsearch=%3Dboeing%5C+747*&amp;airlinesearch=NASA&amp;countrysearch=&amp;specialsearch=&amp;daterange=1983&amp;keywords=&amp;range=&amp;sort_order=datestamp+desc&amp;page_limit=15&amp;thumbnails=&amp;searchSubmit=Searching%2C+please+wait... 1983] at [[Airliners.net]]&lt;/ref&gt; That year, this aircraft was also used to fly [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']] on a tour in Europe, with refuelling stops in [[Goose Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Goose Bay]], [[Canada]]; [[Keflavik, Iceland]]; [[England]]; and [[West Germany]]. It then went to the [[Paris Air Show]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slate.com/id/2124238/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, in the wake of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' accident]], NASA procured a surplus 747SR-46 from [[Japan Airlines]].  Registered [http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=911NA N911NA], it entered service with NASA in 1990 after undergoing modifications similar to N905NA. It was first used in 1991 to ferry the new shuttle [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']] from the manufacturers in [[Palmdale, California]] to [[Kennedy Space Center]].

[[File:Shuttle mounting point.JPG|thumb|Humorous note on Orbiter Mount reminding technicians how to connect the orbiter to the transport]]

Based at the [[Dryden Flight Research Center]] within [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in [[California]]{{r|brack20120917}} the two aircraft were functionally identical, although N911NA has five upper-deck windows on each side, while N905NA has only two.  The rear mounting points on both aircraft were labeled with humorous instructions to "attach orbiter here" or "place orbiter here", clarified by the precautionary note "black side down".&lt;ref&gt;[http://edwards.airshowjournal.com/2003/ 2003 Edwards Air Force Base Air Show], see Shuttle Carrier images.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://s23.photobucket.com/albums/b363/ASFalcon13/Shuttle%20Carrier%20Aircraft%20N911NA/ Shuttle Carrier Aircraft N911NA album on Photobucket]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shuttle Carriers were capable of operating from [[Space Shuttle abort modes|alternative shuttle landing sites]] such as those in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Spain]], and [[France]].  Due to the reduced range of the Shuttle Carrier while mated to an orbiter, additional preparations such as removal of the payload from the orbiter may have been necessary to reduce its weight.&lt;ref name="FS-2006-01-004-KSC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/pdf/167472main_TALsites-06.pdf|title=Space Shuttle Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL) Sites|date=December 2006|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|accessdate=2009-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ferry flights==
{{Further|List of Shuttle Carrier Aircraft flights}}
Ferry flights generally transported the orbiters from [[Edwards Air Force Base]], the shuttle's secondary landing site, to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] (SLF) at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] where the orbiter was processed. This was common in the early days of the space shuttle program when weather conditions at the SLF prevented the shuttle from landing there.  Some flights started at the [[Dryden Flight Research Center]] following delivery of the orbiter from [[Rockwell International]] to NASA from the nearby facilities in Palmdale, California.&lt;ref name=chron&gt;{{cite web|title=STS Chronology|url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/sts-cron.html|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the space shuttle program the SCA was used to deliver the retired orbiters from the Kennedy Space Center to their museums. ''Discovery'' was delivered to the [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center|Udvar-Hazy Center]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Air and Space Museum]] in [[Chantilly, Virginia]], near Washington, D.C. on April 19, 2012.  On April 17, 2012, ''Discovery'' was flown atop a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft escorted by a NASA T-38 Talon chase aircraft in a final farewell flight.  The 747 and ''Discovery'' flew over Washington, D.C. and the metropolitan area around 10&amp;nbsp;am and arrived at Dulles around 11&amp;nbsp;am. The flyover and landing were widely covered on national news media.

The last ferry flight took [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']] from Kennedy Space Center to [[Los Angeles]] between 19 and 21 September 2012 via [[Ellington Field]] and Edwards Air Force Base. After leaving Edwards the SCA with ''Endeavour'' performed low level flyovers above various landmarks across California, from [[Sacramento]] to the [[San Francisco]] Bay Area, and finally to Los Angeles. ''Endeavour'' was delivered to [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles International Airport (LAX)]]. From there the orbiter was transported through the streets of Los Angeles and [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] to its final destination in the California Science Center in [[Exposition Park (Los Angeles)|Exposition Park]].

Shuttle Carrier N911NA retired on February 8, 2012 after its final mission to the Dryden Flight Research Facility at Edwards Air Force Base in Palmdale, California, and was used as a source of parts for NASA's [[Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy]] (SOFIA) aircraft, another modified Boeing 747.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/Features/sca_911_final_flight.html NASA's Shuttle Carrier Aircraft 911's Final Flight]&lt;/ref&gt; N911NA is now preserved and on display at the [[United States Air Force Plant 42#Museums|Joe Davies Heritage Airpark]] in Palmdale, California as part of a long-term loan to the city from NASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/news/features/SCA_911.html|title=Final Journey: SCA 911 on Display at Davies Airpark|last=Gibbs|first=Yvonne|date=September 12, 2014|work=[[NASA]]|access-date=June 15, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/news/FactSheets/FS-013-DFRC.html|title=NASA Armstrong Fact Sheet: Shuttle Carrier Aircraft|last=Gibbs|first=Yvonne|date=September 24, 2014|work=NASA|access-date=June 15, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shuttle Carrier {{Anchor|N905NA}}N905NA was used to ferry the retired Space Shuttles to their respective museums. After delivering ''Endeavour'' to the Los Angeles International Airport in September 2012, the aircraft was flown to the Dryden Flight Research Facility, where NASA intended it to join N911NA as a source of spare parts for NASA's SOFIA aircraft,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/images/content/636738main_ED12-0096-02.jpg]  A graphic history of 35 years of space shuttle ferry flights now adorns the upper forward fuselage of NASA Shuttle Carrier Aircraft 905. (NASA / Tony Landis)&lt;/ref&gt; but when NASA engineers surveyed N905NA they determined that it had few parts usable for SOFIA. In 2013, a decision was made to preserve N905NA and display it at [[Space Center Houston]] with the mockup shuttle ''[[Space Shuttle Independence|Independence]]'' mounted on its back.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/space-flight-news/houstons-shuttle-gets-new-name-familiar-ride/ Houston’s Shuttle Gets New Name, Familiar Ride]&lt;/ref&gt; N905NA was flown to [[Ellington Field]] where it was carefully dismantled, ferried to the [[Johnson Space Center]] in seven major pieces (a process called The Big Move), reassembled, and finally mated with the replica shuttle in August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;SpaceDaily, [http://www.space-travel.com/reports/Shuttle_replica_lifted_and_put_on_top_of_747_carrier_999.html "Shuttle replica lifted and put on top of 747 carrier"], ''Brooks Hays'' (UPI), 2014-08-14&lt;/ref&gt; The display, called Independence Plaza, opened to the public for the first time on January 23, 2016.

'''''The Everglades: River of Grass''''' is a non-fiction book written by [[Marjory Stoneman Douglas]] in 1947. Published the same year as the formal opening of [[Everglades National Park]], the book was a call to attention about the degrading quality of life in the [[Everglades]] and remains an influential book on nature conservation as well as a reference for information on South Florida. It was used as recently as 2007 by ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Beth (March 0, 2007). "Slipping Slowly Into South Florida's Grassy Water." ''The New York Times'': Escapes; AMERICAN JOURNEYS Everglades National Park; Pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:River of Grass (3), NPSPhoto, Brian Call (9101713912).jpg|thumb|"River of Grass" in the Everglades]]
Douglas was a freelance writer who submitted stories to magazines throughout the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. Her friend Hervey Allen was an editor at Rinehart, responsible for the ''[[Rivers of America Series]]''. Allen asked her to write a story about the [[Miami River (Florida)|Miami River]], but Douglas did not find it very interesting, calling it only "an inch long".&lt;ref&gt;Mason, Kathy. "Marjory Stoneman Douglas." The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives, Volume 5: 1997-1999. Charles Scribner's Sons, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; She began learning more about the Miami River though, and in her research, she instead suggested to her editor to write a story about the Everglades. Douglas spent five years researching the Everglades, consulting with [[Garald Parker]] of the [[US Geological Survey]], who was studying the Everglades hydrology systems, and eventually wrote nearly 40 papers on the ecosystems in the Everglades.&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;Davis, Jack (January 2003). "'Conservation is now a dead word': Marjory Stoneman Douglas and the transformation of American environmentalism." ''Environmental History'' '''8''' (1) p. 53-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''The Quarterly Review of Biology'' reviewed the book and commented on Douglas' "convincing evidence" in her assertion that the Everglades are a river instead of a swamp, and declared that "it is hoped that this excellent account of the area and its history may provide the needed stimulus for the establishment of an intelligent conservation program for the entire Everglades."
&lt;ref&gt;Giles, Norman (1948). "The Everglades: River of Grass. Rivers of America." ''The Quarterly Review of Biology''; p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Journal of American Folklore'' praised the book highly, particularly in comparison to other books in the ''Rivers of America'' series, and likened Douglas' enthusiastic writing style to that of a previous writer on rural Florida, [[William Bartram]]: "We have a well written, readable book containing a wealth of scholarly and scientific data which can be enjoyed by both the general and the academically inclined reader."&lt;ref&gt;Goggin, John (1948). "The Everglades. River of Grass." ''The Journal of American Folklore''; p. 229-231&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Mississippi Valley Review'' also expressed interest in Douglas' idea that the Everglades is not a mere swamp.&lt;ref&gt;Dovell, J. E. (1948) "Rivers of America Series. The Everglades: River of Grass." ''The Mississippi Valley Historical Review''; p. 110-111&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==
The book has gone through numerous editions, selling over 500,000 copies since its original publication. The last three editions, published by a Florida publisher, Pineapple Press, have updated afterwords: in 1998 by Randy Lee Loftis and Marjory Stoneman Douglas; the 50th anniversary edition in 1997 by Cyril Zaneski; and the 60th anniversary edition in 2007 by [[Michael Grunwald]], author of ''The Swamp''.

The '''three-component theory of stratification''', more widely known as '''Weberian stratification''' or the '''three class system''', was developed by German [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Max Weber]] with [[social class|class]], [[Social status|status]] and [[Political party|power]] as distinct ideal types. Weber developed a multidimensional approach to [[social stratification]] that reflects the interplay among wealth, prestige and power.
:Weber argued that power can take a variety of forms. A person's power can be shown in the social order through their status, in the economic order through their class, and in the political order through their party. Thus, class, status and party are each aspects of the distribution of power within a community.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst 2007:202.&lt;/ref&gt;
Class, status and power have not only a great deal of effect within their individual areas but also a great deal of influence over the other areas.

* '''[[Wealth]]''': includes property such as buildings, lands, farms, houses, factories and as well as other assets – ''Economic Situation''
* '''Prestige''': the respect with which a person or status position is regarded by others – ''Status Situation''
* '''[[Power (politics)|Power]]''': the ability of people or groups to achieve their goals despite opposition from others – ''Parties''

According to Weber, there are two basic dimensions of power: the ''possession'' of power and the ''exercising'' of power. 

This essay was written shortly before [[World War I]] and was published posthumously in 1922 as part of Weber's ''Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft''.&lt;ref&gt;Weber 1922/1980:531-540.&lt;/ref&gt; It was translated into English in the 1940s as "Class, Status, Party"&lt;ref&gt;Weber 1946:180-195;  reproduced with modifications in Weber 1978:926-939.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been re-translated as "The distribution of power within the community: Classes, ''Stände'', Parties".&lt;ref&gt;Weber 2010.  See also Waters and Waters 2015.[https://www.academia.edu/29605297/Classes_Staende_Parties_by_Max_Weber_translated_by_Tony_and_Dagmar_Waters.doc]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possession of power==

According to Weber, the ability to possess power derives from the individual's ability to control various "social resources".  "The mode of distribution gives to the propertied a monopoly on the possibility of transferring property from the sphere of use as 'wealth' to the sphere of 'capital,' that is, it gives them the entrepreneurial function and all chances to share directly or indirectly in returns on capital" (Lemert 2004:116).  These resources can be anything and everything:  they might include land, capital, social respect, physical strength, and intellectual knowledge.

==Exercising of power==

The ability to exercise power takes a number of different forms, but all involve the idea that it means the ability to get your own way with others, regardless of their ability to resist you.  "For example, if we think about an individual's chances of realizing their own will against someone else, it is reasonable to believe that the person's social prestige, class position, and membership in a political group will have an effect on these chances" (Hurst 2007:202).  In terms of understanding the relationship between power and social stratification, Weber theorized the various ways in which societies are organized in hierarchical systems of domination and subordination using the several major concepts.

===Class and power===

"Class, at its core, is an economic concept; it is the position of individuals in the market that determines their class position. And it is how one is situated in the marketplace that directly affects one's life chances" (Hurst 2007:203). This was theorized by Weber on the basis of "unequal access to material resources". For example, if someone possesses something that you want or need then this makes him potentially more powerful than you. He is in a dominant position and you are in a subordinate position because he controls access to a desired social resource. A classic illustration here is the relationship between an employer and employee.

===Social power (status or ''Stände'')===

"The existence of status groups most often shows itself in the form of 

# [[endogamy]] or the restricted pattern of social intercourse,
# sharing of food and other benefits within groups,
# status conventions or traditions, and
# monopolistic acquisition of certain economic opportunities or the avoidance of certain kinds of acquisitions. (Hurst 2007:204)

If you respect someone or view him as your social superior, then he will potentially be able to exercise power over you (since you will respond positively to his instructions / commands). In this respect, social status is a social resource simply because he may have it while you may not. "Not all power, however entails social honor: The Typical American Boss, as well as the typical big speculator, deliberately relinquishes social honor. Quite generally, 'mere economic' power, and especially 'naked' money power, is by no means a recognized basis or social honor" (Lemert 2004:116).

Note: The German word ''Stand'', plural ''Stände'' (English, "status" or "status group") is sometimes left untranslated in Weber,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Weber 2010:142-148.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to keep in view the origins of this concept in medieval guilds, professions, ethnic identities, and feudal classifications.&lt;ref&gt;Waters and Waters 2015:37-40.[https://www.academia.edu/29605297/Classes_Staende_Parties_by_Max_Weber_translated_by_Tony_and_Dagmar_Waters.doc]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political power (party)===

Parties are associations that aim at securing "power within an organization [or the state] for its leaders in order to attain ideal or material advantages for its active members" (Hurst 2007:206). This form of power can be related to the way in which the State is organized in modern social systems (involving the ability to make laws, for example). If you can influence this process of law creation then you will be in a potentially powerful position. Thus, by your ability to influence a decision-making process you possess power, even though you may not directly exercise that power personally. Political parties are the organizational means to possess power through the mechanism of the State and they include not just formally organized parties, but any group that is organized to influence the way in which power is exercised legitimately through the machinery of the State.  "Since parties aim at such goals as getting their programs developed or accepted and getting positions of influence within organizations, it is clear that they operate only within a rational order within which these goals are possible to attain and only when there is a struggle for power" (Hurst 2007:206).

===Social action===
Social action is in direct relation to "political or party power" in combination with the class situation. The influence of laws is based on the social action of members of the classes. "The direction of interests may vary according to whether or not social action of a larger or smaller portion of those commonly affected by the class situation, or even an association among them, e.g., a trade union, has grown out of the class situation, from which the individual may expect promising results for himself" (Lemert 2004:117). "The degree in which "social action" and possibly associations emerge from the mass behavior of the members of a class is linked to general cultural conditions, especially to those of an intellectual sort. It is also likened to the extent of the contrasts that have already evolved" (Lemert 2004:118). "Class-conscious action is most likely if, first, [Weber says] 'the connection between the causes and consequences of the "class situation"' are transparent, or clear. If individuals can plainly see that there is a connection between the structure of the economic system and what happens to them in terms of life chances, class action is more likely" (Hurst 2007:204). The greater the numbers within these class positions, will increase the chance that they will rise up in action.

===Mobility===
"It is noncontroversial that the class situation in which each individual finds himself represents a limitation on his scope, tends to keep him within the class. It acts as an obstacle to any rise into a higher class, and as a pair of [[water wings]] with respect to the classes below…Class type, relations with class fellows, power over outward resources adapted to the class situation, and so on" (Schumpeter 1951:163-164). In [[capitalist]] society movement between classes is a possibility. Hence the use of the term "The [[American Dream]]" to show the ability of people to ascend to a higher class through hard work and ingenuity. "Class composition is forever changing, to the point where there may be a completely new set of families" (Schumpeter 1951:165).

Weber saw four classes:  the propertied class, the non-propertied class, the [[Petite bourgeoisie|petit bourgeoisie]] and the manual labourer class.
