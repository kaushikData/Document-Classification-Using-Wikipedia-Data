The '''argument from poor design''', also known as the '''[[Dysteleology|dysteleological]] argument''', is an argument against the [[Existence of God|existence of]] a [[Creator deity|creator]] [[God]], based on the reasoning that an [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]] and  [[Omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] God would not create [[organism]]s with the perceived suboptimal designs that can be seen in nature.

The argument is structured as a basic [[modus tollens]]: if "creation" contains many defects, then design is not a plausible theory for the origin of our existence.  It is most commonly used in a weaker way, however:  not with the aim of disproving the existence of God, but rather as a [[reductio ad absurdum]] of the well-known [[Teleological argument|argument from design]], which argues that living things are too well-designed to have originated by chance, so must have been deliberately created by an intelligent God.

Although the phrase "argument from poor design" has seen little use, this type of argument has been advanced many times using words and phrases such as "poor design", "suboptimal design", "unintelligent design" or "[[Dysteleology|dysteology/dysteological]]". The last of these is a term applied by the nineteenth-century biologist [[Ernst Haeckel]] to the implications of organs so rudimentary as to be useless to the life of an organism.&lt;ref name="haeckel"&gt;{{cite book |first=Ernst |last=Haeckel |authorlink=Ernst Haeckel |year=1892 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdYKAAAAIAAJ |title=The History of Creation |location=Appleton, New York |page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Haeckel, in his book ''The History of Creation'', devoted most of a chapter to the argument, ending with the proposition (perhaps with tongue slightly in cheek) of "a theory of the ''unsuitability of parts'' in organisms, as a counter-hypothesis to the old popular doctrine of the ''suitability of parts''".&lt;ref name="haeckel"/&gt;  The term "incompetent design", a play on "[[intelligent design]]", has been coined by [[Donald Wise]] of the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] to describe aspects of nature that are currently flawed in design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wise |first=Donald |date=2005-07-22 |title="Intelligent" Design versus Evolution |journal=Science |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] |volume=309 |issue=5734 |pages=556–557 |doi=10.1126/science.309.5734.556c |pmid=16040688}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional theological responses generally posit that God's creation was perfect but that humanity's misuse of its [[free will]] to rebel against God&lt;!--[?:], and the consequent damage from hostile spiritual forces,--&gt; has resulted in the corruption of good design.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Hahne, [https://books.google.com/books?id=K-Ls4CUEWFAC&amp;lpg=PA211&amp;dq=Creation%20fallen%20due%20to%20sin&amp;pg=PA211#v=onepage&amp;q=Creation%20fallen%20due%20to%20sin&amp;f=false ''The Corruption and Redemption of Creation: Nature in Romans 8, Volume 34'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory A. Boyd, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hj791_BeAF0C&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;dq=Creation%20fallen%20boyd&amp;pg=PA206#v=onepage&amp;q=Creation%20fallen%20boyd&amp;f=false ''God at War: The Bible &amp; Spiritual Conflict'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ed. Charles Taliaferro, Chad Meister, ''The Cambridge Companion to Christian Philosophical Theology'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=KJQyhzY4PucC&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=augustine%20privation%20of%20good%20fallen%20creation&amp;pg=PA160#v=onepage&amp;q=augustine%20privation%20of%20good%20fallen%20creation&amp;f=false page 160]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:Fitness-landscape-cartoon.png|thumb|right|Natural selection is expected to push fitness to a peak, but that peak often is not the highest.]]

The argument runs that:

# An [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]], [[Omniscience|omniscient]], [[Omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] creator God [[Creation myth|would create]] [[organism]]s that have optimal [[design]].
# Organisms have features that are suboptimal.
# Therefore, God either did not create these organisms or is not omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent.

It is sometimes used as a [[reductio ad absurdum]] of the well-known [[Teleological argument|argument from design]], which runs as follows:

# Living things are too well-designed to have originated by chance.
# Therefore, life must have been created by an intelligent creator.
# This creator is God.

"Poor design" is consistent with the predictions of the [[scientific theory]] of [[evolution]] by means of [[natural selection]]. This predicts that features that were evolved for certain uses, are then reused or co-opted for different uses, or abandoned altogether; and that suboptimal state is due to the inability of the [[heredity|hereditary]] mechanism to eliminate the particular vestiges of the evolutionary process.

In [[fitness landscape]] terms, natural selection will always push "up the hill", but a species cannot normally get from a lower peak to a higher peak without first going through a valley.

The argument from poor design is one of the arguments that was used by [[Charles Darwin]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]]. ''[[The Origin of Species]]'', 6th ed., Ch. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; modern proponents have included [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Richard Dawkins]]. They argue that such features can be explained as a consequence of the gradual, cumulative nature of the evolutionary process. [[Theistic evolutionists]] generally reject the argument from design, but do still maintain belief in the existence of God.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===In humans===

====Fatal flaws====
{{more citations needed|date=May 2017}}
[[File:Ectopic.png|250px|thumb|right|[[Regnier de Graaf|Artist's]] representation of an [[ectopic pregnancy]]. Critics cite such common biological occurrences as contradictory to the '[[watchmaker analogy]]'.]]
Several defects in human anatomy can result in death, especially without modern medical care:
* In the human female, a [[zygote|fertilized egg]] can implant into the [[fallopian tube]], [[cervix]] or [[ovary]] rather than the [[uterus]] causing an [[ectopic pregnancy]]. The existence of a cavity between the ovary and the fallopian tube could indicate a flawed design in the female reproductive system. Prior to modern surgery, ectopic pregnancy invariably caused the deaths of both mother and baby. Even in modern times, in almost all cases the pregnancy must be aborted to save the life of the mother.
* In the human female, the [[vagina|birth canal]] passes through the [[human pelvis|pelvis]]. The prenatal skull will deform to a surprising extent. However, if the [[baby]]'s head is significantly larger than the pelvic opening, the baby cannot be born naturally. Prior to the development of modern surgery ([[caesarean section]]), such a complication would lead to the death of the mother, the baby, or both. Other birthing complications such as [[breech birth]] are worsened by this position of the birth canal.
* In the human male, [[testes]] develop initially within the [[abdomen]]. Later during gestation, they migrate through the abdominal wall into the [[scrotum]]. This causes two weak points in the abdominal wall where [[hernia]]s can later form. Prior to modern surgical techniques, complications from hernias, such as intestinal blockage and [[gangrene]], usually resulted in death.&lt;ref name="Jury"&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Colby |author2=Loren Petrich |year=1993 |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/jury-rigged.html |title=Evidence for Jury-Rigged Design in Nature |publisher=[[Talk.Origins]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/615A4Dvf5?url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/jury-rigged.html |archivedate=2011-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The existence of the [[pharynx]], a passage used for both [[ingestion]] and [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]], with the consequent drastic increase in the risk of [[choking]]. 
* The breathing reflex is stimulated not directly by the absence of [[oxygen]] but indirectly by the presence of carbon dioxide.  A result is that, at high altitudes, oxygen deprivation can occur in unadapted individuals who do not consciously increase their breathing rate.
* The human [[Appendix (anatomy)|appendix]] is a [[vestigial organ]] with no known purpose (suggested purposes are either unproven or incidental/non-essential){{citation needed|date=March 2018}} and no deleterious effects come from its removal.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} However [[appendicitis]], an infection of this organ, is a certain death without medical intervention.

====Other flaws====
* Barely used nerves and muscles, such as the [[plantaris muscle]] of the foot,&lt;ref name="selim"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Selim |first=Jocelyn |date=June 2004 |title=Useless Body Parts |journal=Discover |volume=25 |issue=6 |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2004/jun/useless-body-parts |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817155923/http://discovermagazine.com/2004/jun/useless-body-parts |archivedate=2011-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that are missing in part of the human population and are routinely harvested as spare parts if needed during operations. Another example is the muscles that move the ears, which some people can learn to control to a degree, but serve no purpose in any case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ernst |last=Haeckel |authorlink=Ernst Haeckel |year=1892 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdYKAAAAIAAJ |title=The History of Creation |location=Appleton, New York |page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The common malformation of the human spinal column, leading to [[scoliosis]], [[sciatica]] and congenital misalignment of the vertebrae. The [[spinal cord]] cannot ever properly heal if it is damaged, because neurons have become so specialized that they are no longer able to regrow once they reach their mature state. The spinal cord, if broken, will never repair itself and will result in permanent [[paralysis]].&lt;ref&gt;"Nervous System Guide by the National Science Teachers Association."

* Almost all animals and plants synthesize their own [[vitamin C]], but humans cannot because the gene for this enzyme is defective ([[L-gulonolactone oxidase|Pseudogene ΨGULO]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nishikimi M, Yagi K |title=Molecular basis for the deficiency in humans of gulonolactone oxidase, a key enzyme for ascorbic acid biosynthesis |journal=Am. J. Clin. Nutr. |volume=54 |issue=6 Suppl |pages=1203S–1208S |date=December 1991 |pmid=1962571}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of vitamin C results in [[scurvy]] and eventually death. The gene is also non-functional in other [[primate]]s and in [[guinea pig]]s, but is functional in most other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ohta Y, Nishikimi M |title=Random nucleotide substitutions in primate nonfunctional gene for L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase, the missing enzyme in L-ascorbic acid biosynthesis |journal=Biochim.

* The prevalence of [[congenital disease]]s and genetic disorders such as [[Huntington's disease]].
* Crowded [[teeth]] and poor [[Paranasal sinus|sinus]] drainage, as human faces are significantly flatter than those of other [[primates]] and humans share the same tooth set. This results in a number of problems, most notably with [[wisdom teeth]], which can damage neighboring teeth or cause serious infections of the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;"Wisdom Teeth."

* The structure of [[human eye|humans' eye]]s (as well as those of all vertebrates). The [[retina]] is 'inside out'. The nerves and blood vessels lie on the ''surface'' of the retina instead of behind it as is the case in many [[invertebrate]] species. This arrangement forces a number of complex adaptations and gives mammals a [[blind spot (vision)|blind spot]].&lt;ref&gt;Nave, R. "The Retina." of the Human Eye. N.p., n.d.

===Other life===

* In the [[Africa]]n [[locust]], [[nerve]] cells start in the abdomen but connect to the wing. This leads to unnecessary use of materials.&lt;ref name="Jury" /&gt;
* Intricate reproductive devices in [[orchid]]s, apparently constructed from components commonly having different functions in other flowers.
* The use by [[panda]]s of their enlarged [[sesamoid bone#Other animals|radial sesamoid bones]] in a manner similar to how other creatures use [[thumb]]s.&lt;ref name="Jury" /&gt;
* The existence of unnecessary wings in flightless birds, e.g. ostriches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ernst |last=Haeckel |authorlink=Ernst Haeckel |year=1892 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdYKAAAAIAAJ |title=The History of Creation |location=Appleton, New York |page=326}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The route of the [[recurrent laryngeal nerve]] is such that it travels from the brain to the larynx by looping around the [[aortic arch]]. This same configuration holds true for many animals; in the case of the [[giraffe]], this results in about twenty feet of extra nerve.
* The [[Tetrachromacy|loss of tetrachromatic vision]] by mammals as compared to other tetrapods.
* The enzyme [[RuBisCO]] has been described as a "notoriously inefficient" enzyme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Spreitzer RJ, Salvucci ME |title=Rubisco: structure, regulatory interactions, and possibilities for a better enzyme |journal=Annu Rev Plant Biol |volume=53 |issue= |pages=449–75 |year=2002 |pmid=12221984 |doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.53.100301.135233}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibited]] by oxygen, has a very slow turnover and is not saturated at current levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The enzyme is inhibited as it is unable to distinguish between carbon dioxide and molecular oxygen, with oxygen acting as a [[competitive inhibition|competitive enzyme inhibitor]]. However, RuBisCO remains the key enzyme in [[carbon fixation]], and plants overcome its poor activity by having massive amounts of it inside their cells, making it the most abundant protein on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ellis RJ |title=Biochemistry: Tackling unintelligent design |journal=Nature |volume=463 |issue=7278 |pages=164–5 |date=January 2010 |pmid=20075906 |doi=10.1038/463164a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The enzyme [[nitrogenase]] actually preferentially binds with [[acetylene]] over di-nitrogen, despite its being the key enzyme used in nitrogen fixation in many [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]].
* Sturdy but heavy bones, suited for non-flight, occurring in animals like bats. Or, on the converse: unstable, light, hollow bones, suited for flight, occurring in birds like penguins and ostriches, which cannot fly.
* Various [[vestigial]] body parts, like the femur and pelvis in whales (evolution says the ancestor of whales lived on land).
* [[Turritopsis dohrnii]] and [[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]] genus have [[biological immortality]], but most animals do not.
* Many species have strong instincts to behave in response to a certain stimulus. Natural selection can leave animals behaving in detrimental ways when they encounter a [[supernormal stimulus]] - like a [[moth]] flying into a flame.
* Plants are green and not black, as [[chlorophyll]] absorbs green light poorly, even though black plants would absorb more light energy.
* [[Whale]]s and [[dolphin]]s breathe air, but live in the water, meaning they must swim to the surface frequently to breathe.
* [[Albatross]]es cannot take off or land properly.

== Criticism ==

===Unproven assumptions===
Several generic philosophical criticisms can be directed towards the first premise of the argument – that a [[Creator deity]] would have designed things 'optimally'.  The argument hinges on an assumption that the human concept of 'optimal design' is the same as that of a theistic god. This is, in effect, the argument for the incomprehensibility of the [[Abrahamic God]] [[Yahweh]] in the [[Book of Job]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me. Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if thou hast understanding. Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? Or who hath stretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? Or who laid the corner stone thereof, when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?&lt;ref&gt;King James Bible.  Job 38:1&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The [[Book of Job]] goes on to list a number of aspects of the world that seem wonderful or miraculous beyond human understanding. The claim is that, if humans have no understanding of how the wonders of the world were created, they cannot fully understand the things that appear flawed.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Optimal design engineering and trade-offs===
Others argue that the observed suboptimality in one system or another is intentional, as a [[trade-off]] to improve overall optimal design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fazale|first=Rana|title=Responding to a Skeptic|url=http://www.reasons.org/theology/bible-difficulties/RespondingtoaSkeptic|accessdate=2018-07-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927013720/http://www.reasons.org/theology/bible-difficulties/RespondingtoaSkeptic|archivedate=2011-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specific examples===
[[Intelligent design]] proponent [[William Dembski]] questions the first premise of the argument, maintaining a distinction between "intelligent design" and optimal design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dembski |first=William |authorlink=William Dembski |title=Intelligent design: the bridge between science &amp; theology |publisher=InterVarsity Press |year=1999 |isbn=0-8308-2314-X |page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article written by [[John Woodmorappe]] on the [[Creation Ministries International]] website says that the [[Sesamoid bone|panda's "thumb"]] works well for what the panda uses it for – to strip leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creation.com/panda-thumbs-its-nose-at-the-dysteleological-arguments-of-the-atheist-stephen-jay-gould|title=Panda thumbs its nose at the dysteleological arguments of the atheist Stephen Jay Gould - creation.com|author=|date=|website=creation.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130704051258/http://creation.com/panda-thumbs-its-nose-at-the-dysteleological-arguments-of-the-atheist-stephen-jay-gould|archivedate=2013-07-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[veriform appendix|appendix]] has been previously credited with very little function, research has shown that it serves an important role in the fetus and young adults. Endocrine cells appear in the appendix of the human fetus at around the 11th week of development, which produce various biogenic amines and peptide hormones, compounds that assist with various biological control (homeostatic) mechanisms.  In young adults, the appendix has some immune functions.&lt;ref name=SA&gt;{{cite web |first=Loren G. |last=Martin |date=October 21, 1999 |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=what-is-the-function-of-t |title=What is the function of the human appendix? |publisher=[[Scientific American]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009062840/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=what-is-the-function-of-t |archivedate=October 9, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creationist [[Jonathan Sarfati]] and ophthalmologist Peter Gurney have both published articles on the Creation Ministries International website which disagree that the human eye is poorly designed, arguing that alternative arrangements would have further complications and that the human eye actually works very well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creation.com/is-our-inverted-retina-really-bad-design|title=Is our 'inverted' retina really 'bad design'? - creation.com|author=|date=|website=creation.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130627193627/http://creation.com/is-our-inverted-retina-really-bad-design|archivedate=2013-06-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creation.com/mueller-cells-backwardly-wired-retina-v-dawkins|title=Mueller cells backwardly wired retina v Dawkins - creation.com|author=|date=|website=creation.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130626233057/http://creation.com/mueller-cells-backwardly-wired-retina-v-dawkins|archivedate=2013-06-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses to criticism==

In addition, the [[plantaris]] muscle does atrophy. Its motor function is so minimal that its long tendon can readily be harvested for reconstruction elsewhere with little functional deficit.

In response to the claim that uses have been found for "junk" DNA, proponents note that the fact that some non-coding DNA has a purpose does not establish that all non-coding DNA has a purpose, and that the human genome does include [[pseudogenes]] that are nonfunctional "junk", with others noting that some sections of DNA can be randomized, cut, or added to with no apparent effect on the organism in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mark |last=Isaak |year=2004 |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB130.html |title=Claim CB130 |publisher=Talk.Origins |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911070043/http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB130.html |archivedate=2006-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original study that suggested that the ''Makorin1-p1'' served some purpose&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hirotsune | first1 = S | last2 = Yoshida | first2 = N | last3 = Chen | first3 = A | last4 = Garrett | first4 = L | last5 = Sugiyama | first5 = F | last6 = Takahashi | first6 = S | last7 = Yagami | first7 = K | last8 = Wynshaw-Boris | first8 = A | last9 = Yoshiki | first9 = A. | year = 2003 | title = An expressed pseudogene regulates the messenger-RNA stability of its homologous coding gene | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v423/n6935/abs/nature01535.html | journal = Nature | volume = 423 | issue = 6935 | pages = 91–6 | doi = 10.1038/nature01535 | pmid = 12721631 | display-authors = etal | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080425042454/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v423/n6935/abs/nature01535.html | archivedate = 2008-04-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gray | first1 = TA | last2 = Wilson | first2 = A | last3 = Fortin | first3 = PJ | last4 = Nicholls | first4 = RD | year = 2006 | title = The putatively functional Mkrn1-p1 pseudogene is neither expressed nor imprinted, nor does it regulate its source gene in trans | url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0602216103v1 | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 103 | issue =  | pages = 12039–12044 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0602216103 | pmid = 16882727 | pmc = 1567693 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071001043736/http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0602216103v1 | archivedate = 2007-10-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the original study is still frequently cited in newer studies and articles on pseudogenes previously thought to be nonfunctional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oe=utf-8&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;lr&amp;cites=16337157008352528383|title=Google Scholar|author=|date=|website=scholar.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As an argument regarding God==
The argument from poor design is sometimes interpreted, by the argumenter or the listener, as an [[argument against the existence of God]], or against characteristics commonly attributed to a [[creator deity]], such as [[omnipotence]], [[omniscience]], or personality. In a weaker form, it is used as an argument for the incompetence of God. The existence of "poor design" (as well as the perceived prodigious "wastefulness" of the evolutionary process) would seem to imply a "poor" designer, or a "blind" designer, or no designer at all. In Gould's words, "If God had designed a beautiful machine to reflect his wisdom and power, surely he would not have used a collection of parts generally fashioned for other purposes. Orchids are not made by an ideal engineer; they are jury-rigged...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_panda%27s-thumb.html |title=The Panda's Peculiar Thumb |work=NATURAL HISTORY |date=November 1978 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928063454/http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_panda's-thumb.html |archivedate=2006-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The apparently suboptimal design of organisms has also been used by [[theistic evolutionists]] to argue in favour of a creator deity who uses [[natural selection]] as a mechanism of his creation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Collins|Collins, Francis S.]] ''The Language of God'' (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster), 2006. p 191. {{ISBN|978-1-4165-4274-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguers from poor design regard counter-arguments as a [[false dilemma]], imposing that either a creator deity designed life on earth well, or flaws in design indicate the life is not designed. This allows proponents of [[intelligent design]] to [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry pick]] which aspects of life constitute design, leading to the [[unfalsifiability]] of the theory. Christian proponents of intelligent design as evidence of the existence of the [[Abrahamic God]] [[Yahweh]] can claim that good design indicates the creative intelligence of their God, while poor design indicates corruption of the world as a result of [[Alvin Plantinga's free will defense|free will]] that caused the [[Fall (religion)|Fall]] ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 3:16 has [[Yahweh]] saying to [[Eve]] "I will increase your trouble in pregnancy").

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24792">An '''astronomical interferometer''' is an array of separate [[telescope]]s, mirror segments, or [[radio telescope]] [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]s that work together as a single telescope to provide higher resolution images of astronomical objects such as [[star]]s, [[nebula]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]] by means of [[interferometry]].  The advantage of this technique is that it can theoretically produce images with the [[angular resolution]] of a huge telescope with an [[aperture]] equal to the separation between the component telescopes.  The main drawback is that it does not collect as much light as the complete instrument's mirror. Thus it is mainly useful for fine resolution of more luminous astronomical objects, such as close [[binary star]]s.  Another drawback is that the maximum angular size of a detectable emission source is limited by the minimum gap between detectors in the collector array.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.am.ub.edu/~robert/Documents/umin.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014131518/http://www.am.ub.edu/~robert/Documents/umin.pdf |archivedate=2016-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interferometry is most widely used in [[radio astronomy]], in which signals from separate [[radio telescope]]s are combined.  A mathematical [[signal processing]] technique called [[aperture synthesis]] is used to combine the separate signals to create high-resolution images.  In [[Very Long Baseline Interferometry]] (VLBI) radio telescopes separated by thousands of kilometers are combined to form a radio interferometer with a resolution which would be given by a hypothetical single dish with an aperture thousands of kilometers in diameter.  At the shorter [[wavelength]]s used in [[infrared astronomy]] and [[optical astronomy]] it is more difficult to combine the light from separate telescopes, because the light must be kept [[coherence (physics)|coherent]] within a fraction of a wavelength over long optical paths, requiring very precise optics.  Practical infrared and optical astronomical interferometers have only recently been developed, and are at the cutting edge of astronomical research.  At optical wavelengths, aperture synthesis allows the [[astronomical seeing|atmospheric seeing]] resolution limit to be overcome, allowing the angular resolution to reach the [[Diffraction-limited system|diffraction limit]] of the optics.

[[File:Disc around the young star HD 163296.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[ESO]]’s [[Very Large Telescope|VLT]] interferometer took the first detailed image of a disc around a young star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ESO’s VLT Takes First Detailed Image of Disc around Young Star|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann1058/|accessdate=17 November 2011|newspaper=ESO Announcements}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Astronomical interferometers can produce higher resolution astronomical images than any other type of telescope. At radio wavelengths, image resolutions of a few micro-[[arcsecond]]s have been obtained, and image resolutions of a fractional milliarcsecond have been achieved at visible and infrared wavelengths.

One simple layout of an astronomical interferometer is a parabolic arrangement of mirror pieces, giving a partially complete [[reflecting telescope]] but with a "sparse" or "dilute" aperture. In fact the parabolic arrangement of the mirrors is not important, as long as the optical path lengths from the astronomical object to the beam combiner (focus) are the same as would be given by the complete mirror case. Instead, most existing arrays use a planar geometry, and [[Antoine Émile Henry Labeyrie|Labeyrie]]'s hypertelescope will use a spherical geometry.

==History==
[[File:Hooker interferometer.jpg|left|thumb|280px|A 20-foot Michelson interferometer mounted on the frame of the 100-inch [[Hooker Telescope]], 1920.]]

One of the first uses of optical interferometry was applied by the [[Michelson stellar interferometer]] on the [[Mount Wilson Observatory]]'s reflector telescope to measure the diameters of stars. The red giant star [[Betelgeuse]] was the first to have its diameter determined in this way on December 13, 1920.&lt;ref name="MICHELSON"&gt;{{cite journal

For the next three decades astronomical interferometry research was dominated by research at radio wavelengths, leading to the development of large instruments such as the [[Very Large Array]] and the [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]].

Optical/infrared interferometry was extended to measurements using separated telescopes by Johnson, Betz and Townes (1974) in the infrared and by [[Antoine Émile Henry Labeyrie|Labeyrie]] (1975) in the visible.&lt;ref name="JOHNSON"&gt;{{cite journal

Similar techniques have now been applied at other astronomical telescope arrays, including the [[Keck Interferometer]] and the [[Palomar Testbed Interferometer]].

==Modern astronomical interferometry==
{{further|Astronomical optical interferometry}}

Astronomical interferometry is principally conducted using Michelson (and sometimes other type) interferometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Ground-based_optical_interferometry |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007165618/http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Ground-based_optical_interferometry |archivedate=2016-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal operational interferometric observatories which use this type of instrumentation include [[VLTI#Interferometry and the VLTI|VLTI]], [[Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer|NPOI]], and [[CHARA array|CHARA]].

[[File:NPOI.Usic.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Navy Optical Interferometer|Navy Precision Optical Interferometer (NPOI)]], a 437&amp;nbsp;ma baselined optical/near-infrared, 6-beam Michelson Interferometer at 2163&amp;nbsp;m elevation on Anderson Mesa in Northern Arizona, USA. Four additional 1.8-meter telescopes are being installed starting from  2013.]]
[[File:VLTI.jpg|thumb|Light collected by three [[ESO]] VLT auxiliary telescopes, and combined using the technique of interferometry.]]
[[File:Very Large Telescope Interferometer.jpg|thumb|left|This image shows one of a series of sophisticated optical and mechanical systems called star separators for the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Hardware to Take Interferometry to the Next Level|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann13015/|accessdate=3 April 2013|newspaper=ESO}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Current projects will use interferometers to search for [[extrasolar planets]], either by astrometric measurements of the reciprocal motion of the star (as used by the [[Palomar Testbed Interferometer]] and the [[Very Large Telescope|VLT]]I), through the use of nulling (as will be used by the [[Keck Interferometer]] and [[Darwin (ESA)|Darwin]]) or through direct imaging (as proposed for [[Antoine Émile Henry Labeyrie|Labeyrie]]'s Hypertelescope).

Engineers at the European Southern Observatory [[ESO]] designed the Very Large Telescope VLT so that it can also be used as an interferometer. Along with the four {{convert|8.2|m|in|adj=on}} unit telescopes, four mobile 1.8-metre auxiliary telescopes (ATs) were included in the overall VLT concept to form the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). The ATs can move between 30 different stations, and at present, the telescopes can form groups of two or three for interferometry.

When using interferometry, a complex system of mirrors brings the light from the different telescopes to the astronomical instruments where it is combined and processed. This is technically demanding as the light paths must be kept equal to within 1/1000&amp;nbsp;mm over distances of a few hundred metres. For the Unit Telescopes, this gives an equivalent mirror diameter of up to {{convert|130|m|ft}}, and when combining the auxiliary telescopes, equivalent mirror diameters of up to {{convert|200|m|ft}} can be achieved. This is up to 25 times better than the resolution of a single VLT unit telescope.

The VLTI gives astronomers the ability to study celestial objects in unprecedented detail. It is possible to see details on the surfaces of stars and even to study the environment close to a black hole. With a spatial resolution of 4&amp;nbsp;milliarcseconds, the VLTI has allowed astronomers to obtain one of the sharpest images ever of a star. This is equivalent to resolving the head of a screw at a distance of {{convert|300|km|abbr=on}}.

Notable 1990s results included the [[Mark III Stellar Interferometer|Mark III]] measurement of diameters of 100 stars and many accurate stellar positions, [[Cambridge Optical Aperture Synthesis Telescope (COAST)|COAST]] and [[Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer|NPOI]] producing many very high resolution images, and [[Infrared Stellar Interferometer]] measurements of stars in the mid-infrared for the first time. Additional results include direct measurements of the sizes of and distances to [[Cepheid]] variable stars, and [[young stellar objects]].

[[File:ALMA Antennas on Chajnantor.jpg|thumb|left|Two of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter array ([[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]]) 12-metre antennas gaze at the sky at the observatory’s Array Operations Site (AOS), high on the Chajnantor plateau at an altitude of 5000 metres in the Chilean Andes.]]

High on the Chajnantor plateau in the Chilean Andes, the European Southern Observatory (ESO), together with its international partners, is building ALMA, which will gather radiation from some of the coldest objects in the Universe. ALMA will be a single telescope of a new design, composed initially of 66 high-precision antennas and operating at wavelengths of 0.3 to 9.6&amp;nbsp;mm. Its main 12-meter array will have fifty antennas, 12 metres in diameter, acting together as a single telescope – an interferometer. An additional compact array of four 12-metre and twelve 7-meter antennas will complement this. The antennas can be spread across the desert plateau over distances from 150 metres to 16 kilometres, which will give ALMA a powerful variable "zoom". It will be able to probe the Universe at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths with unprecedented sensitivity and resolution, with a resolution up to ten times greater than the Hubble Space Telescope, and complementing images made with the VLT interferometer.

[[Optical interferometry|Optical interferometers]] are mostly seen by astronomers as very specialized instruments, capable of a very limited range of observations. It is often said that an interferometer achieves the effect of a telescope the size of the distance between the apertures; this is only true in the limited sense of [[angular resolution]]. The amount of light gathered—and hence the dimmest object that can be seen—depends on the real aperture size, so an interferometer would offer little improvement as the image is dim (the [[thinned-array curse]]). The combined effects of limited aperture area and atmospheric turbulence generally limits interferometers to observations of comparatively bright stars and [[active galaxy|active galactic nuclei]]. However, they have proven useful for making very high precision measurements of simple stellar parameters such as size and position ([[astrometry]]), for imaging the nearest [[giant star]]s and probing the cores of nearby [[active galaxies]].

For details of individual instruments, see the [[list of astronomical interferometers at visible and infrared wavelengths]].

By moving the holes in the aperture mask and taking repeated measurements, images can be created using [[aperture synthesis]] which would have the same quality as ''would have been given'' by the right-hand telescope ''without'' the aperture mask.

At radio wavelengths, interferometers such as the [[Very Large Array]] and [[MERLIN]] have been in operation for many years. The distances between telescopes are typically {{convert|10|-|100|km|mi|abbr=on}}, although arrays with much longer baselines utilize the techniques of [[Very Long Baseline Interferometry]]. In the (sub)-millimetre, existing arrays include the [[Submillimeter Array]] and the [[Institut de Radio Astronomie Millimétrique|IRAM]] Plateau de Bure facility. The [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] has been fully operational since March 2013.

[[Max Tegmark]] and [[Matias Zaldarriaga]] have proposed the [[Fast Fourier Transform Telescope]] which would rely on extensive computer power rather than standard lenses and mirrors. If [[Moore's law]] continues, such designs may become practical and cheap in a few years.

A '''biblical manuscript''' is any handwritten copy of a portion of the text of the [[Bible]]. The word ''Bible'' comes from the Greek ''biblia'' (books); ''[[manuscript]]'' comes from Latin ''manu'' (hand) and ''scriptum'' (written). Biblical manuscripts vary in size from tiny scrolls containing individual verses of the Jewish scriptures (see [[Tefillin]]) to huge [[Polyglot (book)|polyglot]] [[codices]] (multi-lingual books) containing both the Hebrew Bible ([[Tanakh]]) and the [[New Testament]], as well as [[Biblical canon|extracanonical]] works.

The study of biblical manuscripts is important because handwritten copies of books can contain errors. The science of [[textual criticism]] attempts to reconstruct the original text of books, especially those published prior to the [[movable type|invention of the printing press]].

==Hebrew Bible (or Tanakh) manuscripts==
[[File:Aleppo Codex (Deut).jpg|thumb|upright|A page from the [[Aleppo Codex]], Deuteronomy]]

{{main article|List of Hebrew Bible manuscripts}}

The [[Aleppo Codex]] (c. 920 CE) and [[Leningrad Codex]] (c. 1008 CE) were the oldest Hebrew language manuscripts of the [[Tanakh]]. In 1947 CE the finding of the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] at [[Qumran]] pushed the manuscript history of the Tanakh back a millennium from the two earliest complete codices. Before this discovery, the earliest extant manuscripts of the [[Old Testament]] were in Greek in manuscripts such as [[Codex Vaticanus]] and [[Codex Sinaiticus]]. Out of the roughly 800 manuscripts found at Qumran, 220 are from the Tanakh. Every book of the Tanakh is represented except for the [[Book of Esther]]; however, most are fragmentary. Notably, there are two [[scroll]]s of the [[Book of Isaiah]], one complete ([[1QIs-a|1QIs&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;]]), and one around 75% complete ([[1QIs-b|1QIs&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;]]). These manuscripts generally date between 150 BCE to 70 CE.{{sfn|Bruce|1964}}

==New Testament manuscripts==

[[File:Codex Alexandrinus f41v - Luke.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Folio 41v from [[Codex Alexandrinus]] contains the [[Gospel of Luke]] with decorative tailpiece.]]
The [[New Testament]] has been preserved in more manuscripts than any other ancient work of literature, with over 5,800 complete or fragmented [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts catalogued, 10,000 [[Latin]] manuscripts and 9,300 manuscripts in various other ancient languages including [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]]. The dates of these manuscripts range from c. 125 (the {{Papyrus link|52}} papyrus, oldest copy of John fragments) to the introduction of printing in Germany in the 15th century.

Often, especially in monasteries, a manuscript cache was little more than a former manuscript recycling centre, where imperfect and incomplete copies of manuscripts were stored while the monastery or scriptorium decided what to do with them.{{sfn|Ehrman|2005}} There were several options. The first was to simply "wash" the manuscript and reuse it. Such reused manuscripts were called [[palimpsest]]s and were very common in the ancient world until the [[Middle Ages]]. One notable palimpsest is the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]]. If not done within a short period of time after the papyri was made, washing it was less likely since the papyri might deteriorate and thus be unusable. When washing was no longer an option, the second choice was burning. Since the manuscripts contained the words of Christ, they were thought to have had a level of sanctity;{{sfn|Ehrman|2005}} burning them was considered more reverent than simply throwing them into a garbage pit, which occasionally happened (as in the case of [[Oxyrhynchus 840]]). The third option was to leave them in what has become known as a manuscript gravesite. When scholars come across manuscript caches, such as at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in the [[Sinai]] (the source of the [[Codex Sinaiticus]]), or Saint Sabbas Monastery outside [[Bethlehem]], they are finding not libraries but storehouses of rejected texts{{sfn|Ehrman|2005}} sometimes kept in boxes or back shelves in libraries due to space constraints. The texts were unacceptable because of their scribal errors and contain corrections inside the lines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.codexsinaiticus.org/en/ |title=Codex Sinaiticus |accessdate=2008-12-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231104440/http://www.codexsinaiticus.org/en/ |archivedate=2008-12-31 |website=Codex Sinaiticus Website }}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly evidence that monastery scribes compared them to a master text. In addition, texts thought to be complete and correct but had deteriorated for heavy usage or had missing [[wikt:folio|folios]] would also be placed in the [[Treasure trove|caches]]. Once in a cache, insects and humidity would often contribute to the continued deterioration of the documents.{{sfn|Ehrman|2005}}

Complete and correctly-copied texts would usually be immediately placed in use and so wore out fairly quickly, which required frequent recopying. Manuscript copying was very costly when it required a scribe's attention for extended periods so a [[manuscript]] might be made only when it was commissioned. The size of the [[parchment]], [[writing system|script]] used, any illustrations (thus raising the effective cost) and whether it was one book or a collection of several would be determined by the one commissioning the work. Stocking extra copies would likely have been considered wasteful and unnecessary since the form and the presentation of a manuscript were typically customized to the aesthetic tastes of the buyer.

Due to the prevalence of manuscript caches, scholars today are more likely to find incomplete and sometimes conflicting segments of manuscripts rather than complete and largely consistent works.{{sfn|Ehrman|2005}}

===Transmission===
The task of copying manuscripts was generally done by [[scribe]]s who were trained professionals in the arts of writing and bookmaking. Some manuscripts were also proofread, and scholars closely examining a text can sometimes find the original and corrections found in certain manuscripts. In the 6th century, a special room devoted to the practice of manuscript writing and [[illuminated manuscript|illumination]] called the [[scriptorium]] came into use, typically inside medieval European monasteries. Sometimes a group of scribes would make copies at the same time as one individual read from the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlham.edu/~seidti/iam/mss_trans.html|title=Seid|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manuscript construction===

An important issue with manuscripts is preservation. The earliest New Testament manuscripts were written on [[papyrus]], made from a reed that grew abundantly in the [[Nile Delta]]. This tradition continued as late as the 8th century.{{sfn|Metzger|Ehrman|2005|p=3f}} Papyrus eventually becomes brittle and deteriorates with age. The dry climate of Egypt allowed some papyrus manuscripts to be partially preserved, but, with the exception of {{Papyrus link|77}}, no New Testament papyrus manuscript is complete; many consist only of a single fragmented page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skypoint.com/members/waltzmn/intro.html#MSTypes|title=Waltz|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the fourth century, [[parchment]] (also called [[vellum]]) began to be a common medium for New Testament manuscripts.{{sfn|Metzger|Ehrman|2005|pp=3-10}} It wasn't until the twelfth century that [[paper]] (made from cotton or plant fibers), which was invented in first-century [[China]], began to gain popularity in biblical manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Aland 1995, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 476 non-Christian manuscripts dated to the second century, 97% of the manuscripts are in the form of [[scroll]]s; however, eight Christian manuscripts are [[codex|codices]]. In fact, most New Testament manuscripts are codices. The adaptation of the codex form in non-Christian text did not become dominant until the fourth and fifth centuries, showing a preference for that form amongst early Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlham.edu/~seidti/iam/codex.html|title=Seid|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The considerable length of some New Testament books (such as the [[Pauline epistles]]), and the New Testament itself, was not suited to the limited space available on a single scroll; in contrast a codex could be expanded to hundreds of pages.  On its own, however, length alone is an insufficient reason - after all, the Jewish scriptures would continue to be transmitted on scrolls for centuries to come.{{sfn|Kruger|2012|p=249}} Scholars have argued that the codex was adopted as a product of the formation of the New Testament canon, allowing for a specific collections of documents like the Gospels and the Pauline Epistles.{{sfn|Kruger|2012|p=250}} "Canon and codex go hand in hand in the sense that the adoption of a fixed canon could be more easily controlled and promulgated when the codex was the means of gathering together originally separate compositions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Elliott |first1=J.K. |title=Manuscripts, the Codex, and the Canon |journal=Journal for the Study of the New Testament |date=1996 |issue=63 |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Script and other features===
[[Image:BookOfDurrowBeginMarkGospel.jpg|thumb|upright|The beginning of the [[Gospel of Mark]] from the [[Book of Durrow]].]]
The handwriting found in New Testament manuscripts varies. One way of classifying handwriting is by formality: book-hand vs. cursive. More formal, literary Greek works were often written in a distinctive style of even, capital letters called book-hand. Less formal writing consisted of cursive letters which could be written quickly. Another way of dividing handwriting is between [[uncial script]] (or majuscule) and [[Roman cursive#New Roman cursive|minuscule]]. The uncial letters were a consistent height between the [[baseline (typography)|baseline]] and the cap height, while the minuscule letters had [[Ascender (typography)|ascenders]] and [[descender]]s that moved past the baseline and cap height. Generally speaking, the majuscules are earlier than the minuscules, with a dividing line roughly in the 11th century.{{sfn|Metzger|Ehrman|2005|pp=17-18, 20}}

The earliest manuscripts had negligible punctuation and breathing marks. The manuscripts also lacked word spacing, so words, sentences, and paragraphs would be a continuous string of letters ([[scriptio continua]]), often with line breaks in the middle of words. Bookmaking was an expensive endeavor, and one way to reduce the number of pages used was to save space. Another method employed was to abbreviate frequent words, such as the ''[[nomina sacra]]''. Yet another method involved the [[palimpsest]], a manuscript which recycled an older manuscript. Scholars using careful examination can sometimes determine what was originally written on the material of a document before it was erased to make way for a new text (for example ''[[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus]]'' and the ''[[Syriac Sinaiticus]]'').

The original New Testament books did not have titles, section headings, or [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|verse and chapter divisions]]. These were developed over the years as "helps for readers". The [[Eusebian Canons]] were an early system of division written in the margin of many manuscripts. The Eusebian Canons are a series of tables that grouped parallel stories among the gospels. Starting in the fifth century, subject headings ([[:wikt:κεφαλαία|κεφαλαία]]) were used.

Manuscripts became more ornate over the centuries, which developed into a rich [[illuminated manuscript]] tradition, including the famous Irish [[Gospel Book]]s, the ''[[Book of Kells]]'' and the ''[[Book of Durrow]]''.

===Cataloging===
[[File:SinopeGospelsFolio29rChristHealingBlind.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A page from the [[Sinope Gospels]]. The miniature at the bottom shows [[Jesus]] healing the blind.]]
[[Desiderius Erasmus]] compiled the first printed edition of the Greek New Testament in 1516, basing his work on several manuscripts because he did not have a single complete work and because each manuscript had small errors. In the 18th century, [[Johann Jakob Wettstein]] was one of the first biblical scholars to start cataloging biblical manuscripts. He divided the manuscripts based on the writing used ([[uncial]], minuscule) or format ([[Lectionary|lectionaries]]) and based on content ([[Gospel]]s, [[Pauline epistles|Pauline letters]], [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] + [[General epistles]], and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]). He assigned the uncials letters and minuscules and lectionaries numbers for each grouping of content, which resulted in manuscripts being assigned the same letter or number.&lt;ref&gt;Aland 1995, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

For manuscripts that contained the whole New Testament, such as [[Codex Alexandrinus]] (A) and [[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus]] (C), the letters corresponded across content groupings. For significant early manuscripts such as [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209]] (B), which did not contain Revelation, the letter B was also assigned to a later 10th-century manuscript of Revelation, thus creating confusion. [[Constantin von Tischendorf]] found one of the earliest, nearly complete copies of the Bible, [[Codex Sinaiticus]], over a century after Wettstein's cataloging system was introduced. Because he felt the manuscript was so important, Von Tischendorf assigned it the Hebrew letter [[aleph]] (א). Eventually enough uncials were found that all the letters in the [[Latin alphabet]] had been used, and scholars moved on to first the [[Greek alphabet]], and eventually started reusing characters by adding a [[superscript]]. Confusion also existed in the minuscules, where up to seven different manuscripts could have the same number or a single manuscript of the complete New Testament could have 4 different numbers to describe the different content groupings.&lt;ref&gt;Aland 1995, pp. 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{anchor | Von Soden}}Von Soden====

[[Hermann, Freiherr von Soden]] published a complex cataloging system for manuscripts in 1902-10.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann von Soden, ''Die Schriften des Neuen Testaments, in ihrer ältesten erreichbaren Textgestalt hergestellt auf Grund ihrer Textgeschichte'' 4 vols., Berlin: Glaue, 1902-1910.&lt;/ref&gt; He grouped the manuscripts based on content, assigning them a Greek prefix: δ for the complete New Testament, ε for the Gospels, and α for the remaining parts. This grouping was flawed because some manuscripts grouped in δ did not contain Revelation, and many manuscripts grouped in α contained either the general epistles or the Pauline epistles, but not both. After the Greek prefix, Von Soden assigned a numeral that roughly corresponded to a date (for example δ1-δ49 were from before the 10th century, δ150-δ249 for the 11th century). This system proved to be problematic when manuscripts were re-dated, or when more manuscripts were discovered than the number of spaces allocated to a certain century.&lt;ref&gt;Aland 1995, pp. 40-41&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{anchor | Gregory-Aland}}Gregory–Aland====

[[Caspar René Gregory]] published another cataloging system in 1908 in ''Die griechischen Handschriften des Neuen Testaments'', which is the system still in use today. Gregory divided the manuscripts into four groupings: papyri, uncials, minuscules, and [[Lectionary|lectionaries]]. This division is partially arbitrary. The first grouping is based on the physical material ([[papyrus]]) used in the manuscripts. The second two divisions are based on script: uncial and minuscule. The last grouping is based on content: lectionary. Most of the papyrus manuscripts and the lectionaries before the year 1000 are written in uncial script. There is some consistency in that the majority of the papyri are very early because parchment began to replace papyrus in the 4th century (although the latest papyri dates to the 8th century). Similarly, the majority of the uncials date to before the 11th century, and the majority of the minuscules to after.&lt;ref&gt;Aland 1995, pp. 73-77&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory assigned the papyri a prefix of '''P''', often written in [[blackletter]] script ({{Papyrus|n}}), with a superscript numeral. The uncials were given a prefix of the number 0, and the established letters for the major manuscripts were retained for redundancy (''e.g.'' [[Codex Claromontanus]] is assigned both '''06''' and '''D'''). The minuscules were given plain numbers, and the lectionaries were prefixed with '''''l''''' often written in script ('''ℓ'''). [[Kurt Aland]] continued Gregory's cataloging work through the 1950s and beyond. Because of this, the numbering system is often referred to as "Gregory-Aland numbers". The most recent manuscripts added to each grouping are {{Papyrus link|131}}, [[Uncial 323|0323]], [[Minuscule 2928|2928]], and ''ℓ'' 2463.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ntvmr.uni-muenster.de/liste New Testament Virtual Manuscript Room] at the [[University of Münster]] website&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the cataloging heritage and because some manuscripts which were initially numbered separately were discovered to be from the same codex, there is some redundancy in the list (''i.e.'' the [[Magdalen papyrus]] has both the numbers of {{Papyrus|64}} and {{Papyrus|67}}).&lt;ref&gt;Aland 1995, pp. 73f&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of New Testament textual criticism deals with Greek manuscripts because scholars believe the original books of the New Testament were written in Greek. The text of the New Testament is also found both translated in manuscripts of many different languages (called ''versions'') and quoted in manuscripts of the writings of the [[Church Fathers]]. In the [[critical apparatus]] of the [[Novum Testamentum Graece]], a series of abbreviations and prefixes designate different language versions (it for Old Latin, lowercase letters for individual Old Latin manuscripts, vg for [[Vulgate]], lat for Latin, sy&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; for [[Sinaitic Palimpsest]], sy&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; for [[Curetonian Gospels]], sy&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; for the [[Peshitta]], co for Coptic, ac for Akhmimic, bo for Bohairic, sa for Sahidic, arm for Armenian, geo for Georgian, got for Gothic, aeth for Ethiopic, and slav for Old Church Slavonic).&lt;ref&gt;NA&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; 1996, pp. 64*-76*&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Escribano.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration of a European [[scribe]] at work]]
The New Testament books appear to have been completed within the 1st century. The original manuscripts of the New Testament books are not known to have survived. The [[autograph]]s are believed to have been lost or destroyed a long time ago. What survives are copies of the original. Generally speaking, these copies were made centuries after the originals from other copies rather than from the autograph. [[Paleography]], a science of dating manuscripts by typological analysis of their scripts, is the most precise and objective means known for determining the age of a manuscript. Script groups belong typologically to their generation; and changes can be noted with great accuracy over relatively short periods of time. Dating of manuscript material by a [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dating test]] requires that a small part of the material be destroyed in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://original.britannica.com/eb/article-73398/biblical-literature#597996.hook|title=Britannica Online: Types of manuscript errors|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both radiocarbon and paleographical dating only give a range of possible dates, and it is still debated just how narrow this range might be. Dates established by radiocarbon dating can present a range of 10 to over 100 years. Similarly, dates established by paleography can present a range of 25 to over 125 years.&lt;ref&gt;F. V. Greifenhagen, ''Egypt on the Pentateuch's Ideological Map''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Earliest extant manuscripts====
The earliest manuscript of a New Testament text is a business-card-sized fragment from the [[Gospel of John]], [[Rylands Library Papyrus P52]], which may be as early as the first half of the 2nd century. The first complete copies of single New Testament books appear around 200, and the earliest complete copy of the New Testament, the [[Codex Sinaiticus]] dates to the 4th century.{{sfn|Ehrman|2004|pp=479-480}} The following table lists the earliest extant manuscript witnesses for the books of the [[New Testament]].

===Textual criticism===
{{main article|Textual Criticism}}
{{further|Textual variants in the New Testament|List of Bible verses not included in modern translations}}
[[Palaeography]] is the study of ancient writing, and [[textual criticism]] is the study of manuscripts in order to reconstruct a probable original text.

None of the original documents of the New Testament is known to scholars to be extant; and the existing manuscripts differ from one another. The textual critic seeks to ascertain from the divergent copies which form of the text should be regarded as most conforming to the original.{{sfn|Metzger|1992}} The [[New Testament]] has been preserved in three major manuscript traditions: the 4th-century-CE [[Alexandrian text-type]], the [[Western text-type]], and the [[Byzantine text-type]], which includes over 80% of all manuscripts, the majority comparatively very late in the tradition.

Since the mid-19th century, eclecticism, in which there is no ''a priori'' bias to a single manuscript, has been the dominant method of editing the Greek text of the New Testament. This is reflected in the [[Novum Testamentum Graece]], which since 2014 corresponds to both the United Bible Society, 5th edition and Nestle-Aland, 28th edition. In [[textual criticism]], eclecticism is the practice of examining a wide number of text witnesses and selecting the variant that seems best. The result of the process is a text with readings drawn from many witnesses. In a purely eclectic approach, no single witness is theoretically favored. Instead, the critic forms opinions about individual witnesses, relying on both external and internal evidence. Even so, the oldest manuscripts, being of the [[Alexandrian text-type]], are the most favored in these two publications; and the critical text has an Alexandrian disposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Barbara |last=Aland |first2=Joël |last2=Delobel |year=1994 |title=New Testament textual criticism, exegesis and church history: a discussion of methods |location=Kampen |publisher=Kok Pharos |p=138 |isbn=9-03-900105-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most English translations of the New Testament made in the 20th Century were based on these copies.

Textual scholar [[Bart D. Ehrman]] writes: "It is true, of course, that the New Testament is abundantly attested in the manuscripts produced through the ages, but most of these manuscripts are many centuries removed from the originals, and none of them perfectly accurate. They all contain mistakes - altogether many thousands of mistakes. It is not an easy task to reconstruct the original words of the New Testament...."{{sfn|Ehrman|2004|p=449}} In reference to the textual evidence for the New Testament, [[Bruce M. Metzger]] wrote,

{{quote|In evaluating the significance of these statistics...one should consider, by way of contrast, the number of manuscripts which preserve the text of the ancient classics. Homer's ''[[Iliad]]''...is preserved by 457 papyri, 2 uncial manuscripts, and 188 minuscule manuscripts. Among the tragedians the witnesses to [[Euripides]] are the most abundant; his extant works are preserved in 54 papyri and 276 parchment manuscripts, almost all of the later dating from the Byzantine period...the time between the composition of the books of the New Testament and the earliest extant copies is relatively brief. Instead of the lapse of a millennium or more, as is the case of not a few classical authors, several papyrus manuscripts of portions of the New Testament are extant which were copies within a century or so after the composition of the original documents.{{sfn|Metzger|1992|pp=33-35}}{{efn|1=As a footnote to his comments, [[Bruce Metzger|Metzger]] also said, "Lest, however, the wrong impression be conveyed from the statistics given above regarding the total number of Greek manuscripts of the New Testament, it should be pointed out that most of the [[New Testament papyrus|papyri]] are relatively fragmentary and that only about fifty manuscripts (of which the [[Codex Sinaiticus]] is the only [[Uncial script|Uncial manuscript]]) contain the entire New Testament."{{sfn|Metzger|1992|p=34}} }} }}

Biblical scholar [[Gary Habermas]] adds, 

{{quote|What is usually meant is that the New Testament has far more manuscript evidence from a far earlier period than other classical works. There are just under 6000 NT manuscripts, with copies of most of the NT dating from just 100 years or so after its writing. Classical sources almost always have fewer than 20 copies each and usually date from 700-1400 years after the composition of the work. In this regard, the classics are not as well attested. While this doesn't guarantee truthfulness, it means that it is much easier to reconstruct the New Testament text. Regarding genre, the Gospels are usually taken today to be examples of Roman biographies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Reliability and Inspiration of the Bible  |website=Dr. Habermas Answers Important Questions |url=http://www.garyhabermas.com/qa/qa_index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Every year, several New Testament manuscripts handwritten in the original Greek format are discovered. The latest substantial find was in 2008, when 47 new manuscripts were discovered in [[Albania]]; at least 17 of them unknown to Western scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michelle A |last=Vu |url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/nt.scholar.on.discovery.of.giant.trove.of.bible.manuscripts/18204.htm |title=NT scholar on discovery of giant trove of Bible manuscripts |work=[[Christianity Today]] |date=21 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been an estimate of 400,000 variations among all these manuscripts (from the 2nd to 15th century).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Daniel |last=Wallace |date=13 April 2009 |title=The Number of Textual Variants: An Evangelical Miscalculation |url=https://bible.org/article/number-textual-variants-evangelical-miscalculation}}&lt;/ref&gt; If you spread those 400,000 variations over 5,600 manuscripts, that comes out to only about 71 variations per manuscript, (400,000 divided by 5,600). And some of these manuscripts are the equivalent of several hundred pages of text, hand-written (see [[Codex Vaticanus]], [[Codex Alexandrinus]], et al.).  The number of variants is additionally less significant than may appear since it is a comparison across linguistic boundaries.  More important estimates focus on comparing texts within languages. Those variations are considerably fewer. The vast majority of these are accidental errors made by [[scribe]]s, and are easily identified as such: [[Haplography|an omitted word]], [[Homoioteleuton|a duplicate line]], a misspelling, a rearrangement of words. Some variations involve apparently intentional changes, which often make more difficult a determination of whether they were corrections from better exemplars, [[harmonization]]s between readings, or ideologically motivated.{{sfn|Ehrman|2004}} Variants are listed in critical editions of the text, the most important of which is the [[Novum Testamentum Graece]], which is the basis for most modern translations. For over 250 years, Christian scholars have argued that no textual variant affects key Christian doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wallace |first=Daniel |date=3 June 2004 |url=https://bible.org/article/majority-text-and-original-text-are-they-identical |title=The Majority Text and the Original Text: Are They Identical? |access-date=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;c.f.

==Definition==
===Syntax===
[[Backus-Naur form|Backus&amp;ndash;Naur form]]:
&lt;source lang="bnf"&gt; &lt;term&gt; ::= 00 | 01 | 1 &lt;term&gt; &lt;term&gt;  &lt;/source&gt;
===Semantics===
The [[denotational semantics]] of BCL may be specified as follows:
* &lt;code&gt;[ 00 ] == ''K''&lt;/code&gt; 
* &lt;code&gt;[ 01 ] == ''S''&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;[ 1 &lt;term1&gt; &lt;term2&gt; ] == ( [&lt;term1&gt;] [&lt;term2&gt;] ) &lt;/code&gt;  
where "&lt;code&gt;[...]&lt;/code&gt;" abbreviates "the meaning of &lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt;".  Here &lt;code&gt;''K''&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;''S''&lt;/code&gt; are the [[SKI combinator calculus|''KS''-basis combinators]], and &lt;code&gt;( )&lt;/code&gt; is the ''application'' operation, of [[combinatory logic]].  (The prefix &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to a left parenthesis, right parentheses being unnecessary for disambiguation.)

Thus there are four equivalent formulations of BCL, depending on the manner of encoding the triplet (K,&amp;nbsp;S,&amp;nbsp;left parenthesis).  These are &lt;code&gt;(00,&amp;nbsp;01,&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;/code&gt; (as in the present version), &lt;code&gt;(01,&amp;nbsp;00,&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;(10,&amp;nbsp;11,&amp;nbsp;0)&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;(11,&amp;nbsp;10,&amp;nbsp;0)&lt;/code&gt;.

The [[operational semantics]] of BCL, apart from eta-reduction (which is not required for [[Turing-complete|Turing completeness]]), may be very compactly specified by the following [[rewriting]] rules for subterms of a given term, [[parsing]] from the left:
* &lt;code&gt; &amp;nbsp;1100xy&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr; x   &lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt; 11101xyz&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;11xz1yz   &lt;/code&gt;
where &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; are arbitrary subterms. (Note, for example, that because parsing is from the left, &lt;code&gt;10000&lt;/code&gt; is not a subterm of &lt;code&gt;11010000&lt;/code&gt;.)

The techniques of bioremediation of environmental areas as [[soil]], [[water]] and [[sediments]] contaminated by radionuclides are diverse and currently being set up as an ecological and economic alternative to traditional procedures. Physico-chemical conventional strategies are based on the extraction of waste by excavating and drilling, with a subsequent long-range transport for their final confinement. These works and transport have often unacceptable estimated [[cost of operation|costs of operation]] that could exceed a [[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]] [[United States dollar|dollars]] in the [[US]] and 50 [[million]] [[Pound sterling|pounds]] in the [[UK]].&lt;ref name="prakash"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3917470/pdf/mbt20006-0349.pdf|title=Bioremediation: a genuine technology to remediate radionuclides from the environment|last1=Prakash|first1=D|last2=Gabani|first2=P|last3=Chandel|first3=A.K|last4=Ronen|first4=Z|last5=Singh|first5=O.V|journal=Microbial Biotechnology|year= 2013|volume=6|issue=4|doi=10.1111/1751-7915.12059|pages=349–360|pmc=3917470|format=PDF|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|place=New York|pmid=23617701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The species involved in these processes have the ability to influence the properties of radionuclides such as [[solubility]], [[bioavailability]] and [[Motion (physics)|mobility]] to accelerate its stabilization. Its action is largely influenced by [[electron donors]] and [[electron acceptors|acceptors]], [[nutrient medium]], complexation of radioactive particles with the material and [[environmental factors]]. These are measures that can be performed on the source of contamination (''[[in situ]]'') or in controlled and limited facilities in order to follow the [[biological process]] more accurately and combine it with other systems (''[[ex situ]]'').&lt;ref name="newsome"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0009254113004907/1-s2.0-S0009254113004907-main.pdf?_tid=1e19ef28-1ed2-11e6-a426-00000aab0f02&amp;acdnat=1463780027_d2587d314497c03d719dde123928563f|title=The biogeochemistry and bioremediation of uranium and other priority radionuclides|first1=L|last1=Newsome|last2=Morris|first2=K|last3=Lloyd|first3=J.R|year=2014|doi=10.1016/j.chemgeo.2013.10.034|journal=Chemical Geology|publisher=Elsevier|volume=363|pages=164–184|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="in situ"&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275329686_In_situ_and_ex_situ_bioremediation_of_radionuclide-contaminated_soils_at_nuclear_and_NORM_sites|chapter=9.

===Typology of radionuclides and polluting waste===
{{main|Radioactive waste}}
The presence of radioactive waste in the environment may cause long-term effects due to the [[Specific activity|activity]] and [[Biological half-life|half-life]] of the radionuclides, leading their impact to grow with time.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt; These particles exist in various [[oxidation states]] and are found as [[oxides]], [[coprecipitation|coprecipitates]], or as [[organic chemical|organic]] or [[inorganic chemical|inorganic]] complexes, according to their origin and ways of liberation. Most commonly they are found in oxidized form, which makes them more soluble in water and thus more mobile.&lt;ref name="in situ"/&gt; Unlike organic contaminants, however, they cannot be destroyed and must be converted into a stable form or extracted from the environment.&lt;ref name="brookhaven"&gt;{{cite conference|url=https://www.bnl.gov/isd/documents/32628.pdf|title=Microbial Transformations of Radionuclides and Environmental Restoration Through Bioremediation|date=2006|conference=Symposium on "Emerging Trends in Separation Science and Technology"|publisher=[[Brookhaven National Laboratory]]|first=A.J|last=Francis|format=PDF|place=Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sources of radioactivity are not exclusive of human activity. The [[natural radioactivity]] does not come from human sources: it covers up to ¾ of the total radioactivity in the world and has its origins in the interaction of terrestrial elements with high energy [[cosmic rays]] ([[cosmogenic nuclide|cosmogenic radionuclides]]) or in the existing materials on [[Earth]] since its formation ([[primordial nuclide|primordial radionuclides]]). In this regard, there are differences in the levels of radioactivity throughout the [[Earth's crust]]. [[India]] and mountains like the [[Alps]] are among the areas with the highest level of natural radioactivity due to their composition of [[rocks]] and [[sand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.csn.es/radiacion-natural-y-artificial2|title=Radiación natural y artificial|format=Web|author=Consejo de Seguridad Nuclear|editor=[[Ministry of Industry (Spain)|Ministerio de Industria, Turismo y Comercio de España]]|access-date=24 February 2016|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most frequent radionuclides in soils are naturally [[radium-226]] (&lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;Ra), [[radon-222]] (&lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn), [[thorium-232]] (&lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th), [[uranium-238]] (&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U) and [[potassium-40]] (&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K). Potassium-40 (up to 88% of total activity), [[carbon-14]] (&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C), [[radium-226]], [[uranium-238]] and [[rubidium-87]] (&lt;sup&gt;87&lt;/sup&gt;Rb) are found in [[ocean]] waters. Moreover, in [[groundwater]] abound radius radioisotopes such as radium-226 and [[radium-228]] (&lt;sup&gt;228&lt;/sup&gt;Ra).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Naturally occurring radionuclides in the marine environment: an overview of current knowledge with emphasis on the North Sea area|publisher=Norse Decom AS|year=2003|isbn=82-92538-01-1|first1=P|last1=Varskog|first2=E|last2=Stralberg|first3=A.T.S|last3=Varskog|first4=A|last4=Raaum|format=PDF|page=7|place=Kjeller|url=http://dom.cat/rzw}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="idaho"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.isu.edu/radinf/natural.htm|title=Radioactivity in Nature|editor=[[Idaho State University]]|format=Web|access-date=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also habitual in [[building materials]] radionuclides of uranium, thorium and potassium (the latter common to [[wood]]).&lt;ref name="idaho"/&gt;

At the same time, [[anthropogenic nuclide|anthropogenic radionuclides]] (caused by humans) are due to [[thermonuclear reaction]]s resulting from [[Effects of nuclear explosions|explosions]] and [[nuclear weapons]] tests, discharges from [[nuclear facility|nuclear facilities]], accidents deriving from the reprocessing of commercial [[fuel]], waste storage from these processes and to a lesser extent, [[nuclear medicine]].&lt;ref name="hu"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0265931X08001392|title=Sources of anthropogenic radionuclides in the environment: a review|first1=Q|last1=Hu|first2=J|last2=Weng|first3=J|last3=Wang|format=Web|journal=Journal of Environmental Radioactivity|volume=101|issue=6|year=2010|pages=426–437|doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2008.08.004|publisher=Elsevier|place=Arlington}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some polluted sites by these radionuclides are the [[US DOE]] facilities (like [[Hanford Site]]), the [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone|Chernobyl]] and [[Japanese reaction to Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] [[exclusion zone]]s and the affected area of [[Chelyabinsk Oblast]] due to the [[Kyshtym disaster]].

In ocean waters, the presence of [[tritium]] (&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H), [[cesium-137]] (&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs), [[strontium-90]] (&lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr), [[plutonium-239]] (&lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu) and [[plutonium-240]] (&lt;sup&gt;240&lt;/sup&gt;Pu) has significantly increased due to anthropogenic causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bBQSBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=artificial+tritium+in+oceans&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fykWeDRpwf&amp;sig=oBQ-vDbyYd2SNad8nstwgQaJTt0&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjR0teB3JPLAhULfRoKHVT1BPQQ6AEIOjAE#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Chemical Oceanography|volume=8|chapter=44.4.1.

*'''Very short lived waste (VSLW)''': Waste with very short half-lives (often used for research and medical purposes) that can be stored over a limited period of up to a few years and subsequently cleared from regulatory control.
*'''Very low level waste (VLLW)''': Waste like soil and [[rubble]] (with low levels of activity concentration) that may also contain other hazardous waste.
*'''Low level waste (LLW)''': Waste that is above clearance levels and requires robust isolation and containment for periods of up to a few hundred years and is suitable for disposal in engineered near surface facilities. LLW include short lived radionuclides at higher levels of activity concentration and also long lived radionuclides, but only at relatively low levels of activity concentration.
*'''Intermediate level waste (ILW)''': Waste with long lived radionuclides that requires a greater degree of containment and isolation at greater depths.
*'''High level waste (HLW)''': Waste with large amounts of long lived radionuclides that need to be stored in deep, stable [[geological formations]] usually several hundred metres or more below the surface.

=== Ecological and human health consequences ===
[[File:Deformity of Hand due to X-ray burns.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Deformity of hand due to an [[X-ray]] burn.]]
Radioactive contamination is a potential danger for living organisms and results in external hazards, concerning radiation sources outside the body, and internal dangers, as a result of the incorporation of radionuclides inside the body (often by [[inhalation]] of particles or [[ingestion]] of [[contaminated food]]).&lt;ref name="chemistry"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WE7DeP21BhcC&amp;pg=PP16&amp;dq=biological+effects+of+radioactive+pollution&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwikwtWx4JjLAhVC0hoKHWz8DZEQ6AEIGTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=biological%20effects%20of%20radioactive%20pollution&amp;f=false|title=Environmental Chemistry|chapter=Effects of radioactive pollution|isbn=9788182830127|editor1-first=B.K|editor1-last=Sharma|publisher=Krishna Prakashan Media|place=Meerut|year=2007|first1=B.K|last1=Sharma|first2=A|last2=Sharma|first3=M|last3=Sharma|format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In humans, single doses from 0.25 [[Sievert|Sv]] produce first anomalies in the amount of [[leukocytes]]. This effect is accentuated if the [[absorbed dose]] is between 0.5 and 2 Sv, in whose first damage, [[nausea]] and [[hair loss]] are suffered. The strip ranging between 2 and 5 Sv is considered the most serious and include [[bleeding]], [[ulcers]] and risk of [[death]]; values exceeding 5 Sv involve immediate death.&lt;ref name="chemistry"/&gt; If radiation, likewise, is received in small doses over long periods of time, the consequences can be equally severe. It is difficult to quantify the health effects for doses below 10 [[mSv]], but it has been shown that there is a direct relationship between prolonged exposure and [[cancer]] risk (although there is not a very clear dose-response relationship to establish clear limits of exposure).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cancer risks attributable to low doses of ionizing radiation: Assessing what we really know|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/100/24/13761.full.pdf|last1=Brenner|first1=D.J|last2=Doll|first2=R|first3=D.T|last3=Goodhead|first4=E.J|last4=Hall|first5=C.E|last5=Land|journal=PNAS|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|volume=100|issue=24|pages=13761–13766|format=PDF|doi=10.1073/pnas.2235592100|issn=1091-6490|year=2003|pmid=14610281|pmc=283495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bacterial bioremediation ==
The biochemical transformation of radionuclides into stable isotopes by [[bacteria|bacterial species]] significantly differs from the metabolism of [[organic compounds]] coming from carbon sources. They are highly energetic radioactive forms which can be converted indirectly by the process of microbial [[energy transfer]].&lt;ref name="nabir"/&gt;

Radioisotopes can be transformed directly through changes in [[valence (chemistry)|valence state]] by acting as [[electron acceptor|acceptors]] or by acting as [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] to [[enzymes]]. They can also be transformed indirectly by [[reducing agent|reducing]] and [[oxidizing agents]] produced by microorganisms that cause changes in [[pH]] or [[redox potential]]. Other processes include [[precipitation]] and complexation of [[surfactants,]] or [[chelating agents]] that bind to radioactive elements. Human intervention, on the other hand, can improve these processes through [[genetic engineering]] and [[omics]], or by injection of microorganisms or [[nutrients]] into the treatment area.&lt;ref name="nabir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brookhaven"/&gt;

===Bioreduction===
{{main|Biotransformation}}
According to the radioactive element and the specific site conditions, bacteria can enzymatically immobilize radionuclides directly or indirectly. Their [[redox potential]] is exploited by some microbial species to carry out reductions that alter the [[solubility]] and hence, mobility, [[bioavailability]] and [[radiotoxicity]]. This waste treatment technique called bioreduction or enzymatic biotransformation is very attractive because it can be done in mild conditions for the environment, does not produce hazardous secondary waste and has potential as a solution for waste of various kinds.&lt;ref name="in situ"/&gt;

[[File:Enzymatic reduction of radionuclides (en).png|thumb|460px|right|Depiction of direct enzymatic reduction. Microorganisms use organic compounds as [[Lactic acid|lactate]], [[acetate]] or [[formate]] as [[electron donors]] to reduce and leave radionuclides in insoluble form.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="intech"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.intechopen.com/books/applied-bioremediation-active-and-passive-approaches/bioremediation-of-radiotoxic-elements-under-natural-environmental-conditions|chapter=Chapter 8: Bioremediation of Radiotoxic Elements under Natural Environmental Conditions|last1=Mtimunye|first1=P.J|last2=Chirwa|first2=E.M.N|doi=10.5772/56909|isbn=978-953-51-1200-6|format=Web|title=Applied Bioremediation - Active and Passive Approaches|year=2013|publisher=Intech|editor1-first=B.P|editor1-last=Yogesh|editor2-first=P|editor2-last=Rao}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Direct enzymatic reduction is the change of radionuclides of a higher oxidation state to a lower one made by [[facultative anaerobe|facultative]] and [[obligate anaerobe]]s. The radioisotope interact with binding sites of metabolically active cells and is used as [[terminal electron acceptor]] in the [[electron transport chain]] where compounds such as [[ethyl lactate]] act as [[electron donors]] under [[anaerobic respiration]].&lt;ref name="in situ"/&gt;

The [[periplasm]] plays a very important role in these bioreductions. In the reduction of [[uranium]] (VI) to insoluble uranium (IV), made by ''[[Shewanella putrefaciens]]'', ''[[Desulfovibrio vulgaris]]'', ''[[Desulfovibrio desulfuricans]]'' and ''[[Geobacter sulfurreducens]]'', the activity of periplasmic [[cytochromes]] is required. The reduction of [[technetium]] (VII) to technetium (IV) made by ''S. putrefaciens'', ''G. sulfurreducens'', ''D. desulfuricans'', ''[[Geobacter metallireducens]]'' and ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', on the other hand, requires the presence of the complex [[formate hydrogenlyase]], also placed in this cell compartment.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;

Other radioactive [[actinides]] such as [[thorium]], [[plutonium]], [[neptunium]] and [[americium]] are enzymatically reduced by ''[[Rhodoferax ferrireducens]]'', ''S. putrefaciens'' and several species of ''[[Geobacter]]'', and directly form an insoluble [[mineral]] phase.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;

The phenomenon of indirect enzymatic reduction is carried out by [[sulfate-reducing bacteria|sulfate-reducing]] and [[dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria]] on [[excretion]] reactions of [[metabolites]] and breakdown products. There is a coupling of the [[oxidation]] of [[organic acids]] —produced by the excretion of these [[Heterotroph|heterotrophic bacteria]]— with the reduction of [[iron]] or other [[metals]] and radionuclides, which forms insoluble compounds that can precipitate as [[oxide minerals|oxide]] and [[oxide minerals|hydroxide minerals]]. In the case of sulfate-reducing bacteria hydrogen sulfide is produced, promoting increased solubility of polluting radionuclides and their [[bioleaching]] (as liquid waste that can then be recovered).&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="in situ"/&gt;

There are several species of reducing microorganisms that produce indirect [[sequestering agents]] and specific [[chelation|chelators]], such as [[siderophores]]. These sequestering agents are crucial in the complexation of radionuclides and increasing their solubility and bioavailability. ''[[Microbacterium flavescens]]'', for example, grows in the presence of radioisotopes such as plutonium, thorium, uranium or americium and produces organic acids and siderophores that allow the dissolution and mobilization of radionuclides through the soil. It seems that siderophores on bacterial surface could also facilitate the entry of these elements within the cell as well. ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' also secretes chelating agents out that meet uranium and thorium when grown in a medium with these elements. In general, it has also been found that [[enterobactin]] siderophores are extremely effective in solubilizing actinide oxides of plutonium.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="in situ"/&gt;

==== Citrate complexes ====
[[Citrate]] is a chelator which binds to certain [[transition metals]] and radioactive actinides. Stable complexes such as [[denticity|bidentate]], [[denticity|tridentate]] (ligands with more than one atom bound) and polynuclear complexes (with several radioactive atoms) can be formed with citrate and radionuclides, which receive a microbial action. Anaerobically, ''[[Desulfovibrio desulfuricans]]'' and species of the genera ''[[Shewanella]]'' and ''[[Clostridium]]'' are able to reduce bidentate complexes of [[uranyl-citrate]] (VI) to uranyl-citrate (IV) and make them precipitate, despite not being able to degrade metabolically complexed citrate at the end of the process.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt; In denitrifying and aerobic conditions, however, it has been determined that it is not possible to reduce or degrade these uranium complexes. Bioreduction do not get a head when they are citrate complex mixed metal complexes or when they are tridentate, monomeric or polynuclear complexes, since they become [[recalcitrant]] and persistent in the environment.&lt;ref name="in situ"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=6.

=== Biosorption, bioaccumulation and biomineralization ===
[[File:Biosorption, biomineralization and bioaccumulation of radionuclides (en).png|500px|right|thumb| Biosorption, bioaccumulation and biomineralization strategies with a specific role for each cell compartment.&lt;ref name="newsome"/&gt;]]
{{main|Biosorption|Bioaccumulation|Biomineralization}}
The set of strategies that comprise biosorption, bioaccumulation and biomineralization are closely related to each other, because one way or another have a direct contact between the cell and radionuclide. These mechanisms are evaluated accurately using advanced analysis technologies such as [[electron microscopy]], [[X-ray diffraction]] and [[XANES]], [[EXAFS]] and [[X-ray spectroscopy|X-ray spectroscopies]].&lt;ref name="nabir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="phosphate"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ae/2014/786929/|title=Phosphate-Mediated Remediation of Metals and Radionuclides|format=Web|year=2014|journal=Advances in Ecology|publisher=Hindawi Publishing|doi=10.1155/2014/786929|first1=R.J|last1=Martinez|first2=M.J|last2=Beazley|first3=P.A|last3=Sobecky|volume=2014|pages=1–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biosorption and bioaccumulation are two metabolic actions that are based on the ability to concentrate radionuclides over a thousand times the concentration of the environment. They consist of complexation of radioactive waste with [[phosphates]], organic compounds and [[sulfites]] so that they become insoluble and less exposed to radiotoxicity. They are particularly useful in [[biosolids]] for [[agricultural]] purposes and [[soil amendments]], although most properties of these biosolids are unknown.&lt;ref name="developments"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11157-005-2170-y|title=Developments in bioremediation of soils and sediments polluted with metals and radionuclides: 2. Field research on bioremediation of metals and radionuclides|last1=Hazen|first1=T.C|last2=Tabak H.H|year=2005|journal=Reviews in Environmental Science and Bio/Technology|publisher=Springer|format=PDF|volume=4|issue=3|pages=157–183|doi=10.1007/s11157-005-2170-y|issn=1572-9826}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biosorption method is based on passive sequestration of positively charged radioisotopes by [[lipopolysaccharides]] (LPS) on the [[cell membrane]] (negatively charged), either live or dead bacteria. Its efficiency is directly related to the increase in temperature and can last for hours, being a much faster method than direct bioreduction. It occurs through the formation of [[biofilm|slimes]] and capsules, and with a preference for binding to the [[phosphate]] and [[phosphoryl]] groups (although it also occurs with [[carboxyl]], [[amine]] or [[sulfhydryl]] groups). ''[[Firmicutes]]'' and other bacteria like ''[[Citrobacter freudii]]'' have significant biosorption capabilities; ''[[Citrobacter]]'' does it through [[electrostatic interaction]] of uranium with phosphates of their LPS.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newsome"/&gt;

Quantitative analyzes determine that, in the case of uranium, biosorption may vary within a range between 45 and 615 [[milligrams]] per gram of cell [[dry weight]]. However, it is a technique that requires a high amount of biomass to affect bioremediation; it presents problems of [[binding site|saturation]] and other cations that compete for binding to the bacterial surface.&lt;ref name="newsome"/&gt;

Bioaccumulation refers to uptake of radionuclides into the cell, where they are retained by complexations with negatively charged intracellular components, precipitation or [[Granule (cell biology)|granules]] formations. Unlike biosorption, this is an [[Active transport|active process]]: it depends on an energy-dependent transport system.&lt;ref name="intech"/&gt; Some metals or radionuclides can be absorbed by bacteria accidentally because of its resemblance to [[dietary elements]] for [[metabolic pathways]]. Several radioisotopes of [[strontium]], for example, are recognized as analogs of [[calcium]] and incorporated within ''[[Micrococcus luteus]]''.&lt;ref name="in situ"/&gt; [[Uranium]], however, has no known function and is believed that its entry into the cell interior may be due to its toxicity (it is able to increase [[membrane permeability]]).&lt;ref name="newsome"/&gt;
[[File:Chernikovite 1.jpg|thumb|210px|left|[[Chernikovite]] and [[meta-autunite]], radioactive minerals result of possible biomineralization.]]
Furthermore, biomineralization —also known as bioprecipitation— is the [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of radionuclides through the generation of microbial ligands, resulting in the formation of stable [[Biogenic substance|biogenic minerals]]. These minerals have a very important role in the retention of radioactive contaminants. A very localized and produced enzymatically ligand concentration is involved and provides a [[nucleation site]] for the onset of biomineral precipitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=2.3 Biomineralization/Bioprecipitation|page=178|title=Radionuclides in the Environment: Influence of chemical speciation and plant uptake on radionuclide migration|first1=C|last1=Walther|first2=D.K|last2=Guptha|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=9783319221717|place=Switzerland|format=Web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w7_YCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA178&amp;lpg=PA178&amp;dq=2.3+Biomineralization/Bioprecipitation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=62v7XQuYZe&amp;sig=b5_UzK7BlkglRJ9woyMHnGCTiEs&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjcupqP2-_MAhWJDBoKHcbfAkkQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=2.3%20Biomineralization%2FBioprecipitation&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly relevant in precipitations of [[phosphatase]] activity-derivate biominerals, which cleavage molecules such as [[glycerol phosphate]] on [[periplasm]]. In ''[[Citrobacter]]'' and ''[[Serratia]]'' genera, this cleavage liberates inorganic phosphates (HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) that precipitates with uranyl ion (UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and cause deposition of [[Crystallite|polycrystalline minerals]] around the cell wall.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=24.

Investigations of terrestrial and marine bacterial isolates belonging to the genera ''[[Aeromonas]]'', ''[[Bacillus]]'', ''[[Myxococcus]]'', ''[[Pantoea]]'', ''[[Pseudomonas]]'', ''[[Rahnella]]'' and ''[[Vibrio]]'' have also demonstrated the removal of uranium radioisotopes as phosphate biominerals in both [[oxygen|oxic]] and [[oxygen|anoxic]] growth conditions.&lt;ref name="phosphate"/&gt;

Aside from bioreduction, biosorption, bioaccumulation and biomineralization, which are bacterial strategies for natural attenuation of radioactive contamination, there are also human methods that increase the efficiency or speed of microbial processes. This accelerated natural attenuation involves an intervention in the contaminated area to improve conversion rates of radioactive waste, which tend to be slow. There are two variants: biostimulation and bioaugmentation.&lt;ref name="nabir goals"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.lbl.gov/NABIRarchive/researchprogram/strategicplan/goals.html|title=II.

Biostimulation is the addition of nutrients with [[trace elements]], [[electron donors]] or [[electron acceptors]] to stimulate activity and growth of natural [[indigenous microbial]] communities.&lt;ref name="in situ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nabir goals"/&gt; It can range from simple [[fertilization]] or infiltration (called passive biostimulation) to more aggressive injections to the ground, and is widely used at [[United States Department of Energy|US DOE]] sites.&lt;ref name="developments"/&gt; [[Nitrate]] is used as nutrient to biostimulate the reduction of [[uranium]], because it serves as very energetically favorable [[electron acceptor]] for [[Dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria|metal-reducing bacteria]]. However, many of these microorganisms (''[[Geobacter]]'', ''[[Shewanella]]'' or ''[[Desulfovibrio]]'') exhibit [[R gene|resistance genes]] to [[heavy metals]] that limit their ability to bioremediate radionuclides. In these particular cases, a carbon source such as [[ethanol]] is added to the medium to promote the reduction of nitrate at first, and then of [[uranium]]. Ethanol is also used in soil injection systems with [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|recirculations]]: it raises the [[pH]] and promotes the growth of [[denitrifying bacteria|denitrifying]] and radionuclide-reducing bacteria, that produce [[biofilms]] and achieve almost 90% decrease in the concentration of radioactive uranium.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;

A number of [[geophysics|geophysical]] techniques have been used to monitor the effects of in situ biostimulation trials including measurement of: [[spectral ionization potential]], [[self potential]]s, [[current density]], [[complex resistivity]] and also [[reactive transport modelling]] (RTM), which measures [[hydrogeology|hydrogeological]] and [[geochemistry|geochemical]] parameters to estimate chemical reactions of the microbial community.&lt;ref name="newsome"/&gt;

Bioaugmentaton, on the other hand, is the deliberated addition to the environment of microorganisms with desired traits to accelerate bacterial metabolic conversion of radioactive waste. They are often added when necessary species for bioremediation do not exist in the treatment place.&lt;ref name="in situ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nabir goals"/&gt; This technique has shown in field trials over the years that it does not offer better results than biostimulation; neither it is clear that introduced species can be distributed effectively through the complex geological structures of most [[subsurface]] environments or that can compete long term with the indigenous microbiota.&lt;ref name="nabir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="developments"/&gt;

=== Genetic engineering and omics ===
[[File:Deinococcus radiodurans.jpg|thumb|130px|right|''[[Deinococcus radiodurans]]'' has much interest in [[genetic engineering]] for bioremediation of radioactive waste.]]
{{main|Genetic engineering|Omics}}
Omics, especially genomics and proteomics, allow identifying and evaluating [[genes]], [[proteins]] and [[enzymes]] involved in radionuclide bioremediation, apart from the structural and functional interactions that exist between them and other metabolites. [[Genome sequencing]] of various microorganisms has uncovered, for example, that ''[[Geobacter sulfurreducens]]'' possess more than 100  [[coding region]]s for [[Cytochrome c|c-type cytochromes]] involved in bioremediation radionuclide, or that ''NiCoT'' gene is significantly overexpressed in ''[[Rhodopseudomonas palustris]]'' and ''[[Novosphingobium aromaticivorans]]'' when grown in medium with radioactive [[cobalt]].&lt;ref name="nabir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;

From this information, different genetic engineering and [[recombinant DNA]] techniques are being developed to generate specific bacteria for bioremediation. Some [[DNA construct|constructs]] expressed in microbial species are [[phytochelatins]], [[histidine|polyhistidines]] and other [[polypeptides]] by [[Fusion protein|fusion-binding domains]] to outer-membrane-anchored proteins.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt; Some of these genetically modified strains are derived from ''[[Deinococcus radiodurans]]'', one of the most radiation-resistant organisms. ''D. radiodurans'' is capable to resist [[oxidative stress]] and [[DNA damage]] from radiation, and reduces [[technetium]], [[uranium]] and [[chromium]] naturally as well. Besides, through insertion of genes from other species it has been achieved that it can also precipitates [[uranyl phosphates]] and degrades [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] by using [[toluene]] as an energy source to grow and stabilize other priority radionuclides.&lt;ref name="nabir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newsome"/&gt;

[[Directed evolution]] of bacterial proteins related to bioremediation of radionuclides is also a field research. [[YieF]] enzyme, for example, naturally catalyzes the reduction of [[chromium]] with a very wide range of [[Substrate (biology)|substrates]]. Following [[protein engineering]], however, it has also been able to participate in [[uranyl ion]] reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=A.C|last1=Matin|title=Development of combinatorial bacteria for metal and radionuclide bioremediation|editor=Stanford University|publisher= DOE's Office of Scientific and Technical Information|year=2006|url=http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/883649|format=PDF|place=Stanford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plant bioremediation ==
{{main|Phytoremediation}}
[[File:Phytoremediation Process - svg.svg|thumb|right|380px|Phytoremediation processes. Radionuclides can not be phytodegraded but converted to more stable or less toxic forms.]]
The use of plants to remove contaminants from the environment or to render them less harmful is called phytoremediation. In the case of radionuclides, it is a viable technology when decontamination times are long and waste are scattered at low concentrations.&lt;ref name="shaw"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Phytoremediation of soils contaminated with radionuclides|pages=43–69|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569486006100030|title=Radioactivity in the Terrestrial Environment|editor1-first=G|editor1-last=Shaw|first1=N|last1=Willey|first2=C|last2=Collins|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080474892|volume=10|doi=10.1016/S1569-4860(06)10003-0|format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trends"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1022527207359|title=Trends in phytoremediation of radionuclides|year=2003|doi=10.1023/A:1022527207359|issn=1573-5036|first1=S|last1=Dushenkov|journal=Plant and Soil|volume=249|issue=1|pages=167–175|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|format=Web|place=Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some plant species are able to transform the state of radioisotopes (without suffering toxicity) concentrating them in different parts of their structure, making them rush through the roots, making them volatile or stabilizing them on the ground. As in bacteria, plant [[genetic engineering]] procedures and biostimulation —called [[phytostimulation]]— have improved and accelerate these processes, particularly with regard to [[fast-growing plants]].&lt;ref name="trends"/&gt; The use of ''[[Agrobacterium rhizogenes]]'', for example, is quite widespread and significantly increases radionuclide uptake by the [[Root|roots]].&lt;ref name="celso"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.intechopen.com/books/genetic-transformation/transgenic-plants-for-enhanced-phytoremediation-physiological-studies|chapter=Chapter 16.

===Phytoextraction===
{{main|Phytoextraction}}
In phytoextraction (also phytoaccumulation, phytosequesteration or phytoabsorption)&lt;ref name="kumar"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=4. Phytoremediation techniques|pages=9–14|editor1-first=D|editor1-last=Kumar|editor2-first=C|editor2-last=Walther|place=Hannover|year=2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iz4qBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=Kumar,+D;+Walther,+C.+«4.+Phytoremediation+techniques».+A:+Radionuclide+Contamination+and+Remediation+Through+Plants&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TqPstHR3aj&amp;sig=8gS3LIvI1gWC0l4fCOKEEoIW_qM&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHgMK9svLMAhVCahoKHRCYBywQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Kumar%2C%20D%3B%20Walther%2C%20C.%20«4.%20Phytoremediation%20techniques».%20A%3A%20Radionuclide%20Contamination%20and%20Remediation%20Through%20Plants&amp;f=false|title=Radionuclide Contamination and Remediation Through Plants|isbn=9783319076652|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; plants carry radioactive waste from the [[root system]] to the [[vascular tissue]] and become concentrated in the [[biomass]] of shoots. It is a technique that removes radionuclides without destroying the soil structure, with minimal impact on [[soil fertility]] and valid for large areas with a low level of radioactivity. Its efficiency is evaluated through [[bioaccumulation coefficient]] (BC) or total removal of radionuclides per [[square metre|m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]], and is proven to attract [[cesium-137]], [[strontium-90]], [[technetium-99]], [[cerium-144]], [[plutonium-240]], [[americium-241]], [[neptunium-237]] and various radioisotopes of [[thorium]] and [[radium]].&lt;ref name="trends"/&gt; By contrast, it requires large biomass production in short periods of time.&lt;ref name="celso"/&gt;

Species like [[common heather]] or [[amaranths]] are able to concentrate cesium-137, the most abundant radionuclide in the [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]]. In this region of [[Ukraine]], [[mustard greens]] could remove up to 22% of average levels of cesium activity in a single growing season. In the same way, [[bok choy]] and mustard greens can concentrate 100 times more [[uranium]] than other species.&lt;ref name="trends"/&gt;

===Rhizofiltration===
[[File:Reedbeds - geograph.org.uk - 380204.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Connected pond system at [[River Dearne]] ([[England]]).]]
{{main|Rhizofiltration}}
Rhizofiltration is the adsorption and precipitation of radionuclides in plant roots or absorption thereof if soluble in effluents. It has great efficiency in the treatment of [[cesium-137]] and [[strontium-90]], particularly by [[algae]] and [[aquatic plants]], such as ''[[Cladophora]]'' and ''[[Elodea]]'' genera, respectively. It is the most efficient strategy for bioremediation technologies in [[wetlands]],&lt;ref name="kumar"/&gt; but must have a continuous and rigorous control of [[pH]] to make it an optimal process.&lt;ref name="celso"/&gt;

From this process, some strategies have been designed based on sequences of [[ponds]] with a slow [[Fluid dynamics|flow]] of water to clean polluted water with radionuclides. The results of these facilities, for flows of 1000 liters of effluent are about 95% retention of radiation in the first pond (by plants and [[sludge]]), and over 99% in three-base systems.&lt;ref name="trends"/&gt;

The most promising plants for rhizofiltration are [[sunflowers]]. They are able to remove up to 95% of [[uranium]] of contaminated water in 24 hours, and experiments in [[Chernobyl]] have demonstrated that they can concentrate on 55&amp;nbsp;kg of plant [[dry weight]] all the cesium and strontium radioactivity from an area of 75 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (stabilized material suitable for transfer to a nuclear waste repository).&lt;ref name="trends"/&gt;

===Phytovolatilization===
{{main|Phytovolatilization}}
Phytovolatilization involves the capture and subsequent [[transpiration]] of radionuclides into the [[atmosphere]]. It does not remove contaminants but releases them in volatile form (less harmful). Despite not having too many applications for radioactive waste, it is very useful for the treatment of [[tritium]], because it exploits plants' ability to transpire enormous amounts of water.&lt;ref name="trends"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kumar"/&gt;

The treatment applied to tritium (shielded by air produces almost no external radiation exposure, but its incorporation in water presents a health hazard when absorbed into the body) uses polluted effluents to [[irrigation|irrigate]] [[phreatophyte]]s. It becomes a system with a low operation cost and low maintenance, with savings of about 30% in comparison to conventional methods of [[pumping (oil well)|pumping]] and covering with [[asphalt]].&lt;ref name="trends"/&gt;

===Phytostabilization===
{{main|Phytostabilization}}
Phytostabilization is an specially valid strategy for radioactive contamination based on the immobilization of radionuclides in the soil by the action of the roots. This can occur by adsorption, absorption and precipitation within root zone, and ensures that radioactive waste can not be dispersed because [[soil erosion]] or [[Leaching (chemistry)|leaching]]. It is useful in controlling tailings from strip and open pit uranium mines, and guarantees to retrieve the [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref name="trends"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kumar"/&gt; However, it has significant drawbacks such as large doses of [[fertilizer]] needed to reforest the area, apart from radioactive source (which implies long-term maintenance) remaining at the same place.&lt;ref name="celso"/&gt;

== Fungal bioremediation ==
[[File:Chernobyl nuclear plant2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Radiotrophic fungi]] growth has been described in reactor 4 at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station]].]]
{{main|Mycoremediation}}
Several fungi species have radioactive resistance values equal to or greater than more radioresistant bacteria; they perform mycoremediation processes. It was reported that some fungi had the ability of growing into, feeding, generating [[spores]] and decomposing pieces of [[graphite]] from destroyed [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus|reactor No. 4]] at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station]], which is contaminated with high concentrations of [[cesium]], [[plutonium]] and [[cobalt]] radionuclides. They were called [[radiotrophic fungi]].&lt;ref name="casadevall"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2677413/pdf/nihms82938.pdf|first1=E|last1=Dadachova|first2=A|last2=Casadevall|title=Ionizing Radiation: how fungi cope, adapt, and exploit with the help of melanin|journal=Current Opinion in Microbiology|year=2008|volume=11|issue=6|pages=525–531|doi=10.1016/j.mib.2008.09.013|publisher=Elsevier|format=PDF|pmc=2677413|pmid=18848901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, it has been shown that some species of ''[[Penicillium]]'', ''[[Cladosporium]]'', ''[[Paecilomyces]]'' and ''[[Xerocomus]]'' are able to use [[ionizing radiation]] as energy through the electronic properties of [[melanins]].&lt;ref name="casadevall"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814601001716|title=A review of edible mushroom radioactivity|first1=P|last1=Kalac|journal=Food Chemistry|year=2001|volume=75|issue=1|pages=29–35|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/S0308-8146(01)00171-6|format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their feeding they bioaccumulate radioisotopes, creating problems on [[concrete]] walls of [[deep geological repository|deep geological repositories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=236–266|chapter=Fungal dissolution and transformation of minerals: significance for nutrient and metal mobility|first1=M|last1=Fomina|first2=E.P|last2=Burford|first3=G|last3=M.

== Ways of research ==
Current research on bioremediation techniques is fairly advanced and molecular mechanisms that govern them are well known. There are, however, many doubts about the effectiveness and possible adversities of these processes in combination with the addition of [[agrochemicals]]. In soils, the role of [[mycorrhizae]] on radioactive waste is poorly described and sequestration patterns of radionuclides are not known with certainty.&lt;ref name="pergamon"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Soil contamination with radionuclides and potential remediation|first1=Y.G|last1=Zhu|first2=G|last2=Shaw|journal=Chemosphere|publisher=Elsevier|volume=41|year=2000|issue=1-2|doi=10.1016/S0045-6535(99)00398-7|pmid=10819188|pages=121–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longevity effects of some bacterial processes, such as maintenance of uranium in insoluble form because of bioreductions or biomineralizations, are unknown. There are not clear details about the [[electronic transfer]] from some radionuclides with these bacterial species either.&lt;ref name="newsome"/&gt;

Another important aspect is the change of ''[[ex situ]]'' or laboratory scale processes to their real application ''[[in situ]]'', in which soil heterogeneity and environmental conditions generate reproduction deficiencies of optimal biochemical status of the used species, a fact that decreases the efficiency. This implies finding what are the best conditions in which to carry out an efficient bioremediation with anions, metals, organic compounds or other chelating radionuclides that can compete with the uptake of interest radioactive waste.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt; Nevertheless, in many cases research is focused on the extraction of soil and water and its ''ex situ'' biological treatment to avoid these problems.&lt;ref name="in situ"/&gt;

Finally, the potential of [[GMOs]] is limited by [[Regulation of the release of genetically modified organisms|regulatory agencies]] in terms of [[Social responsibility|responsibility]] and [[bioethics|bioethical]] issues. Their release require support on the action zone and comparability with indigenous species. Multidisciplinary research is focused on defining more precisely necessary [[genes]] and [[proteins]] to establish new [[free-cell]] systems, which may avoid possible side effects on the environment by the intrusion of [[transgenic]] or [[invasive species]].&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;

[[File:Countries by Birth Rate in 2017.svg|thumb|450px|Countries by crude birth rate (CBR) in 2017.]]
The '''birth rate''' (technically, births/population rate) is the total number of live births per 1,000 in a population in a year or period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/world/birth_rate.html |title=World Birth rate – Demographics |publisher=Indexmundi.com |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of births in a population is calculated in several ways: live births from a universal registration system for births, deaths, and marriages; population counts from a [[census]], and estimation through specialized [[Demographics|demographic]] techniques. The birth rate (along with [[mortality rate|mortality]] and [[human migration|migration]] rate) are used to calculate [[population growth]].

The ''crude birth rate'' is the number of live births per year per 1,000 mid-year population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0,,contentMDK:20451597~pagePK:64133150~piPK:64133175~theSitePK:239419,00.html|title=Data - Population and Demographic Indicators|website=econ.worldbank.org|access-date=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See "[[Fertility rates]]"; Economic Geography Glossary at University of Washington&lt;/ref&gt; Another term used interchangeably with ''birth rate'' is ''natality''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/birthrate |title=birthrate – definition of birthrate by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[crude death rate]] is subtracted from the crude birth rate, the result is the [[rate of natural increase]] (RNI).&lt;ref name="worldbank1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.CBRT.IN |title=Birth rate, crude (per 1,000 people) &amp;#124; Data &amp;#124; Table |publisher=Data.worldbank.org |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is equal to the rate of population change (excluding migration).&lt;ref name="worldbank1"/&gt;

The total (crude) birth rate (which includes all births)—typically indicated as births per 1,000 population—is distinguished from an age-specific rate (the number of births per 1,000 persons in an age group).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/birth-rate |title=birthrate: Definition from |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known use of the term "birth rate" in English occurred in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/birthrate |title=Birthrate – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The birth rate is an issue of concern and policy for national governments. Some (including those of [[Italy]] and [[Malaysia]]) seek to increase the birth rate with financial incentives or provision of support services to new mothers. Conversely, other countries have policies to reduce the birth rate (for example, China's [[one-child policy]] which was in effect from 1978 to 2015). Policies to increase the crude birth rate are known as pro-natalist policies, and policies to reduce the crude birth rate are known as anti-natalist policies. Measures such as improved information on [[birth control]] and its availability have achieved similar results in countries such as [[Family planning in Iran|Iran]].

There has also been discussion on whether bringing women into the forefront of development initiatives will lead to a decline in birth rates. In some countries, government policies have focused on reducing birth rates by improving women's rights, sexual and [[reproductive health]]. Typically, high birth rates are associated with health problems, low [[life expectancy]], low living standards, low [[social status]] for women and low educational levels. [[Demographic transition]] theory postulates that as a country undergoes [[economic development]] and social change its population growth declines, with birth rates serving as an indicator.

At the 1974 [[World Population Conference]] in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]], [[Women's rights#Modern movements|women's issues]] gained considerable attention. Family programs were discussed, and 137 countries drafted a World Population Plan of Action. As part of the discussion, many countries accepted modern [[birth control]] methods such as the [[birth control pill]] and the [[condom]] while opposing [[abortion]]. Population and the need to incorporate women into the discourse were discussed; it was agreed that improvements in women's status and initiatives in defense of reproductive health and freedom, the environment, and sustainable socioeconomic development were needed.

Birth rates ranging from 10–20 births per 1,000 are considered low, while rates from 40–50 births per 1,000 are considered high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childtrends.org/?indicators=fertility-and-birth-rates|title=Fertility and Birth Rates|date=2015-03-24|website=Child Trends|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are problems associated with both extremes. High birth rates may stress government welfare and family programs. Additional problems faced by a country with a high birth rate include educating a growing number of children, creating jobs for these children when they enter the workforce, and dealing with the environmental impact of a large population. Low birth rates may stress the government to provide adequate senior welfare systems and stress families who must support the elders themselves. There will be fewer children (and a working-age population) to support an aging population.

== Coercive population control ==
In the 20th century, several authoritarian governments have sought either to increase or to decrease the birth rates, often through forceful intervention. One of the most notorious [[natalist]] policies is that which occurred in [[communist Romania]] in the period of 1967-1990 during communist leader [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], who adopted a very aggressive natalist policy which included outlawing abortion and contraception, routine pregnancy tests for women, [[Tax on childlessness|taxes on childlessness]], and legal discrimination against childless people. This period has later been depicted in movies and documentaries (such as ''[[4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days]]'', ''[[Children of the Decree]]''). These policies temporarily increased birth rates for a few years, but this was followed by a later decline due to an increased use of [[illegal abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/content/16/6/590 |title=Europe the continent with the lowest fertility &amp;#124; Human Reproduction Update &amp;#124; Oxford Academic |website=Humupd.oxfordjournals.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mihai Horga1 |author2=Caitlin Gerdts |author3=Malcolm Potts |url=http://jfprhc.bmj.com/content/39/1/2.full |title=The remarkable story of Romanian women's struggle to manage their fertility &amp;#124; Journal of Family Planning and Reproductive Healthcare |website=Jfprhc.bmj.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ceaușescu's policy resulted in over 9,000 women who died due to illegal abortions,&lt;ref name="Kligman short"&gt;Kligman, Gail.

The irony of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu|Ceaușescu's]] aggressive natalist policy was a generation that may not have been born would eventually lead the [[Romanian Revolution]] which would overthrow and have him [[Trial of Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu#Execution|executed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Freakonomics|last=Levitt &amp; Dubner|first=Steven &amp; Stephen|publisher=Penguin Group|year=2005|isbn=9780141019017|location=80 Strand, London WC2R ORL England|page=107|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In stark opposition with Ceaușescu's natalist policy was China's [[one child policy]], in effect from 1978 to 2015, which included abuses such as [[forced abortion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-18435126 |title=China forced abortion photo sparks outrage - BBC News |website=Bbc.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy has also been deemed responsible for the common practice of [[sex selective abortion]] which led to an imbalanced [[sex ratio]] in the country. Given strict family-size limitations and a preference for sons, girls have become unwanted in China because they are considered as depriving the parents of the possibility of having a son. With the progress of prenatal sex-determination technologies and induced abortion, the one-child policy gradually turned into a one-son policy.&lt;ref name="Bulte, Heerink, &amp; Zhang, 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bulte, E., Heerink, N., &amp; Zhang, X.|title=China’s one-child policy and ‘the mystery of missing women’: ethnic minorities and male-biased sex ratios.|journal=Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics|year=2011|volume=73|issue=1|pages=0305–9049|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0084.2010.00601.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, the steady decline in birth rates over the past decades can be greatly attributed to the significant gains in women's freedoms, such as tackling the phenomenon of [[forced marriage]] and [[child marriage]], education for women and increased socioeconomic opportunities. Women of all economic, social, religious and educational persuasions are choosing to have fewer children as they are gaining more control over their own [[reproductive rights]]. Apart from more children living into their adult years, women are often more ambitious to take up work, education and living their own lives rather than just a life of reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=People Quake|last=Pearse|first=Fred|publisher=Eden Project Books|year=2010|isbn=9781905811342|location=61-63 Uxbridge Road, London W5 5SA|pages=P131|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birth rates in third world countries have fallen due to the introduction of [[family planning]] clinics.

In Bangladesh, one of the poorest countries in the world, women are on average having two children less often than they did before 1999, according to Australian demographer Jack Caldwell. Bangladeshi women eagerly took up contraceptives, like condoms and the pill, on offer from a foreign population agency in a study by the World Bank carried out in 1994. The study proved that family planning could be carried out and accepted practically anywhere. Caldwell also believes that agricultural improvements led to the need for less labour. Children not needed to plough the fields would be of surplus and require some education, so in turn, smaller families, and with smaller families, women are able to work and have greater ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=People Quake|last=Pearse|first=Fred|publisher=Eden Project Books|year=2010|isbn=9781905811342|location=61-63 Uxbridge Road, London W5 5SA|pages=P133-136|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Myanmar]], a country which until 2011 was controlled by an austere military junta, intent on controlling every aspect of its population's lives. The military generals wanted the country's population doubled. In their view, The women's job was to produce babies to power the country's labour force, so family planning was vehemently opposed. The women of Burma opposed this policy, and Peter McDonald of the Australian National University argues that this gave rise to a [[black market]] trade in contraception, all smuggled from neighbouring Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=People Quake|last=Pearse|first=Fred|publisher=Eden Project Books|year=2010|isbn=9781905811342|location=61-63 Uxbridge Road, London W5 5SA|pages=P136|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, five years after the war ended, Iran saw the fastest recorded drop in fertility in world history. Revolution gave way to consumerism and westernization. With TVs and cars came condoms and the pill. A generation of women expected to produce soldiers in the fight against Iraq was met by the next generation of women who had a choice to enjoy some new found luxuries. In the years during the Iran/Iraq war, the women of Iran averaged about 8 children each, a ratio the hard line Islamic President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad wanted to revive. As of 2010, the birth rate of Iran is 1.7 babies per woman. Some may say this is a triumph of western values, which give women more freedoms, over an Islamic ruled state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=People Quake|last=Pearse|first=Fred|publisher=Eden Project Books|year=2010|isbn=9781905811342|location=61-63 Uxbridge Road, London W5 5SA|pages=P137-139|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic clerics are having less influence over women in other Muslim countries also. In the past 30 years Turkey`s fertility rate of children per woman has dropped from 4.07 to 2.08. Tunisia has dropped from 4.82 to 2.14 and Morocco from 5.4 to 2.52 children per woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/australia-population/|title=worldmeters|last=Staff|first=|date=22 October 2016|website=www.worldmeters.info|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin America, of predominately Catholic faith, has seen the same trends in falling fertility rates. Brazilian women are having half the children they were 25 years ago with a rate of 2.2 children per woman. The Vatican is having less influence over women in other hard-line Catholic countries also. Mexico, El Salvador, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Colombia, Venezuela and Peru have all seen significant drops in fertility in the same period, all going from over six to less than three children per woman. Forty percent of married Brazilian women are choosing to get sterilised after having children, but this may be a compromise as it is only one confession of sin to the church. Some may say this is a triumph of Western values, which give women more freedoms, over a Catholic state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=People Quake|last=Pearse|first=Fred|publisher=Eden Project Books|year=2010|isbn=9781905811342|location=61-62 Uxbridge Road, London W5 5SA|pages=P140|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
Historically, [[Australia]] has had a relatively low fertility rate, reaching a high of 3.14 births per woman in 1960.&lt;ref name="Staff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/australia-population/|title=Australian Population|last=Staff|first=|date=2016-10-23|website=www.worldometers.info|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a decline which continued until the mid-2000, when a one off cash incentive was introduced to reverse the decline. In 2004, the then [[Howard government]] introduced a non-means tested 'Maternity Payment' to parents of every newborn as a substitute to maternity leave. The payment known as the 'Baby Bonus' was A$3000 per child. This rose to A$5000 which was paid in 13 instalments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mccrindle.com.au/the-mccrindle-blog/the-baby-bonus-generation|title=The Baby Bonus Generation|last=Staff|first=|date=2013-05-15|website=www.mccrindle.com.au|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a time when Australia's unemployment was at a 28-year low of 5.2%, the then Treasurer [[Peter Costello]] stated there was opportunity to go lower. With a good economic outlook for Australia, Costello held the view that now was a good time to expand the population, with his famous quote that every family should have three children "one for mum, one for dad and one for the country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2004/s1261874.htm|title=ABC TV Transcript|last=Costello|first=Peter|date=2004-12-09|website=www.abc.net.au|publisher=Australian Broadcast Commission|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia's fertility rate reached a peak of 1.95 children per woman in 2010, a 30-year high,&lt;ref name="Staff"/&gt; although still [[Sub-replacement fertility|below replacement rate]].

Phil Ruthven of the business information firm IBISWorld believes the spike in fertility was more about timing and less about monetary incentives. Generation X was now aged 25 to 45 years old. With numerous women putting pregnancies off for a few years for the sake of a career, many felt the years closing in and their biological clocks ticking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2007/s1963979.htm|title=ABC Radio Transcript|last=Ruthven|first=Phil|date=2007-06-27|website=www.abc.net.au|publisher=Australian Broadcast Commission|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 March 2014, the baby bonus was replaced with Family Tax Benefit A. By then the baby bonus had left its legacy on Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mccrindle.com.au/the-mccrindle-blog/the-baby-bonus-generation|title=The McCrindle Blog|last=Staff|first=|date=2013-05-15|website=www.mccrindle.com.au|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cns|date=November 2018|text=Canada's birthrate is 1.60 births per woman as of 2015, more closely resembling a European country than Australia or the USA.}}

=== France ===
[[France]] has been successful in increasing fertility rates from the low levels seen in the late 1980s, after a continuous fall in the birth rate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=이(Yi)|first=문숙(Moun Souk)|date=Winter 2016|title=프랑스의 저출산 문제 해소 요인 (Resolved Factors to Low Fertility in France)|url=|journal=한국콘텐츠학회논문지(Journal of the Korea contents association)|volume=16 |issue=1|pages=558|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the total fertility rate was as low as 1.66, but perhaps due to the active family policy of the government in the mid 1990s, it has increased, and maintained an average of 2.0 average from 2008 until 2015.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

France has embarked on a strong incentive policy based on two key measures to restore the birth rate: family benefits (''les allocations familiales'') and a family-coefficient of income tax (''le quotient familial'').&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=이(Yi)|first=문숙(Moun Souk)|date=Winter 2016|title=프랑스의 저출산 문제 해소 요인 (Resolved Factors to Low Fertility in France)|url=|journal=한국콘텐츠학회논문지(Journal of the Korea contents association)|volume=16 |issue=1|pages=561|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the end of World War II, early family policy in France has been based on a family tradition that requires children to support multi-child family, so that a third child enables a multi-child family to benefit from family allowances and income tax exemptions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is intended to allow families with three children to enjoy the same living standards as households without children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In particular, the French income taxation system is structured so that families with children receive tax breaks greater than single adults without children.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=이(Yi)|first=문숙(Moun Souk)|date=Winter 2016|title=프랑스의 저출산 문제 해소 요인 (Resolved Factors to Low Fertility in France)|url=|journal=한국콘텐츠학회논문지(Journal of the Korea contents association)|volume=16 |issue=1|pages=562|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This income tax imposition system is known as the family coefficient of income tax.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A characteristic of the family factor is that households with a large number of children, even if they are at the same standard of living, can receive more tax exemption benefits.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Since the 1970s, the focus has been on supporting families who are vulnerable such as single parent families and the children of a poor family in order to ensure equality of opportunity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=이(Yi)|first=문숙(Moun Souk)|date=Winter 2016|title=프랑스의 저출산 문제 해소 요인 (Resolved Factors to Low Fertility in France)|url=|journal=한국콘텐츠학회논문지(Journal of the Korea contents association)|volume=16 |issue=1|pages=563|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, as many women began to participate in the labor market, the government introduced policies of financial support for childcare leave as well as childcare facilities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1994, the government expanded the parent education allowance (''l'allocation parentale d'éducation'') for women with two children to ensure freedom of choice and reduce formal unemployment in order to promote family well-being and women's labor participation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

There are also:
* an infant child care allowance, family allowance and family allowance for multichild family, and a multi-element family pension scheme.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=이(Yi)|first=문숙(Moun Souk)|date=Winter 2016|title=프랑스의 저출산 문제 해소 요인 (Resolved Factors to Low Fertility in France)|url=|journal=한국콘텐츠학회논문지(Journal of the Korea contents association)|volume=16 |issue=1|pages=564|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*a medical insurance system that covers all medical expenses, hospitalization costs, and medical expenses incurred after six months of pregnancy as 100% of the national health insurance in the national social security system, and the statutory leave system during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

An increasing number of Japanese people are staying unmarried: between 1980 and 2010, the percentage of the population who had never married increased from 22% to almost 30%, even as the population continued to age, and by 2035 one in four people will not marry during their childbearing years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yoshida|first1=Reiji|title=Japan’s population dilemma, in a single-occupancy nutshell|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/12/31/national/social-issues/japans-population-dilemma-single-occupancy-nutshell/|accessdate=14 January 2016|work=The Japan Times|date=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese sociologist [[Masahiro Yamada]] coined the term "[[parasite single]]s" for unmarried adults in their late 20s and 30s who continue to live with their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wiseman |first=Paul |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2004-06-02-japan-women-usat_x.htm |title=USATODAY.com - No sex please we're Japanese |website=Usatoday30.usatoday.com |date=2004-06-02 |accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011 Taiwan's government announced that its birth rate declined in the previous year, despite the fact that the government implemented approaches to encourage fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sui |first=Cindy |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-14525525 |title=BBC News – Taiwanese birth rate plummets despite measures |publisher=BBC |date=15 August 2011 |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, the UK's [[Office for National Statistics]] (ONS) announced a 2.4 percent increase in live births in the UK in 2010.&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Press Association |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jul/13/more-midwives-birth-rate-40-year-high |title=Call for more midwives as birth rate reaches 40-year high &amp;#124; Society &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=17 October 2011 |date=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the highest birth rate in the UK in 40 years.&lt;ref name="guardian1"/&gt; However, the UK record year for births and birth rate remains 1920 (when the ONS reported over 957,000 births to a population of "around 40 million").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16853368|title=Go Figure: When was the real baby boom?|publisher=BBC news magazine|author=Michael Blastland|date=2 February 2012|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
According to U.S. federal-government data released in March 2011, births fell four percent from 2007 to 2009 (the largest drop in the U.S. for any two-year period since the 1970s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/31/news/la-heb-us-birth-rate-falls-20110331 |title=Us Birth Rate &amp;#124; U.S. birth rate: Drop in birth rate is the biggest in 30 years – Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=31 March 2011 |accessdate=17 October 2011 |first=Shari |last=Roan}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Births have declined for three consecutive years, and are now seven percent below the 2007 peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bill McBride |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/americas-birth-rate-declined-for-the-third-year-running-2011-8#ixzz1V1D2X8rk |title=America's Birth Rate Declined For The Third Year Running |publisher=Businessinsider.com |date=12 August 2011 |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This drop has continued through 2010, according to data released by the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bill McBride |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/americas-birth-rate-declined-for-the-third-year-running-2011-8 |title=America's Birth Rate Declined For The Third Year Running |publisher=Businessinsider.com |date=12 August 2011 |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts have suggested that this decline is a reflection of unfavorable economic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://yourlife.usatoday.com/parenting-family/story/2011/08/CDC-Childbearing-today-much-like-Depression-era/49928146/1?csp=34news |title=Economic turmoil taking its toll on childbearing |work=USA Today |date=11 August 2011 |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The connection between birth rate and economic conditions stems from the fact that US birth rates have fallen to levels comparable to those during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wzzm13.com/news/article/175311/14/Lower-birth-rate-blamed-on-the-economy |title=Lower birth rate blamed on the economy |publisher=wzzm13.com |date=12 August 2011 |accessdate=17 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130209221819/http://www.wzzm13.com/news/article/175311/14/Lower-birth-rate-blamed-on-the-economy |archivedate=9 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A state-level look at fertility, based on a report published by the Pew Research Center in October 2011, points out the strong correlation between lower birth rates and economic distress. In 2008, North Dakota had the nation's lowest unemployment rate (3.1 percent) and was the only state to show an increase (0.7 percent) in its birth rate. All other states either remained the same or declined.

The research center's study also found evidence of a correlation between economic difficulties and fertility decline by race and ethnicity. Hispanics (particularly affected by the recession) have experienced the largest fertility decline, particularly compared to Caucasians (who have less economic hardship and a smaller decline in fertility). In 2008–2009 the birth rate declined 5.9 percent for Hispanic women, 2.4 percent for African American women and 1.6 percent for white women. The relatively large birth rate declines among Hispanics mirror their relatively large economic declines, in terms of jobs and wealth. According to the statistics using the data from National Centre for Health Statistics and U.S. Census Bureau, from 2007 to 2008, the employment rate among Hispanics declined by 1.6 percentage points, compared with declines of 0.7 points for whites. The unemployment rate shows a similar pattern—unemployment among Hispanics increased 2.0 percentage points from 2007 to 2008, while for whites the increase was 0.9 percentage points. A recent report from the Pew Hispanic Center revealed that Hispanics have also been the biggest losers in terms of wealth since the beginning of the recession, with Hispanic households losing 66% of their median wealth from 2005 to 2009. In comparison, black households lost 53% of their median wealth and white households lost only 16%. In facts, Hispanics, who have been hit the hardest in terms of employment and wealth, have also experienced the largest fertility declines since the onset of the recession because the birth rate declines of Hispanic women is the highest while comparing to the White women. Since, the unemployment rate has been increasing, the birth rate decline has been decreasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Livingston|first1=Gretchen|title=In a Down Economy, Fewer Births|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2011/10/12/in-a-down-economy-fewer-births/|website=Pew Research Center|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other factors (such as women's labor-force participation, contraceptive technology and public policy) make it difficult to determine how much economic change affect fertility. Research suggests that much of the fertility decline during an economic downturn is a postponement of childbearing, not a decision to have fewer (or no) children; people plan to "catch up" to their plans of bearing children when economic conditions improve. Younger women are more likely than older women to postpone pregnancy due to economic factors, since they have more years of fertility remaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2011/10/12/in-a-down-economy-fewer-births/?src=prc-headline |title=In a Down Economy, Fewer Births &amp;#124; Pew Research Center |website=Pewsocialtrends.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, the [[U.S. National Institutes of Health]] announced that the adolescent birth rate continues to decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov/news/health/jul2011/nichd-07.htm |title=Federal report shows drop in adolescent birth rate, July 7, 2011 News Release – National Institutes of Health (NIH) |publisher=Nih.gov |date=7 July 2011 |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, teenage birth rates in the U.S. were at the lowest level in U.S. history.&lt;ref name="Cdc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/teenpregnancy/about/index.htm |title=About Teen Pregnancy |publisher=Cdc.gov |accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teen birth rates in the U.S. have decreased from 1991 through 2012 (except for an increase from 2005–2007).&lt;ref name="Cdc.gov"/&gt; The other aberration from this otherwise-steady decline in teen birth rates is the six percent decrease in birth rates for 15- to 19-year-olds between 2008 and 2009.&lt;ref name="Cdc.gov"/&gt;&lt;!--This does not make sense.--&gt; Despite the decrease, U.S. teen birth rates remain higher than those in other developed nations.&lt;ref name="Cdc.gov"/&gt; Racial differences affect teen birth and pregnancy rates: American Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic black teen pregnancy rates are more than double the non-Hispanic white teenage birth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/features/dsTeenPregnancy/#source |title=CDC Data &amp; Statistics &amp;#124; Feature: Teen Birth Rates Declined Again in 2009 |publisher=Cdc.gov |date=1 July 2011 |accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

States strict in enforcing child support have up to 20 percent fewer unmarried births than states that are lax about getting unmarried dads to pay, the researchers found. Moreover, according to the results, if all 50 states in the United States had done at least as well in their enforcement efforts as the state ranked fifth from the top, that would have led to a 20 percent reduction in out-of-wedlock births.&lt;ref name="archive1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uwnews.org/article.asp?articleid=10608 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505175913/http://uwnews.org/article.asp?articleid=10608 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-05-05 |title=uwnews.org &amp;#124; Tough child support laws may deter single men from becoming fathers, study finds &amp;#124; University of Washington News and Information |date= |accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States population growth is at an historical low level as the United States current birth rates are the lowest ever recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baby bust: U.S. births at record low|url=http://money.cnn.com/2013/09/06/news/economy/birth-rate-low/|publisher=CNN|date=September 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The low birth rates in the contemporary United States can possibly be ascribed to the recession, which led women to postpone having children and fewer immigrants coming to the US. The current US birth rates are not high enough to maintain the size of the U.S. population, according to [[The Economist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=

==Factors affecting birth rate==
{{Main|Fertility factor (demography)}}
[[File:2018 UN Human Development Report.svg|thumb|[[Human Development Index]] map. Darker is higher. Countries with a higher HDI usually have a lower birth rate, known as the [[Income and fertility|fertility-income paradox]].]]
There are many factors that interact in complex ways, influencing the births rate of a population.
[[Developed countries]] have a lower birth rate than [[underdeveloped countries]] (see [[Income and fertility]]). A parent's number of children strongly correlates with the number of children that each person in the next generation will eventually have.&lt;ref name="Murphy2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=Michael|title=Cross-National Patterns of Intergenerational Continuities in Childbearing in Developed Countries|journal=Biodemography and Social Biology|volume=59|issue=2|year=2013|pages=101–126|issn=1948-5565|doi=10.1080/19485565.2013.833779}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors generally associated with increased fertility include [[religiosity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1353/sof.0.0000| title = Religiosity and Fertility in the United States: The Role of Fertility Intentions| journal = Social Forces| volume = 86| issue = 3| page = 1163| year = 2008| last1 = Hayford | first1 = S.

Many of these factors however are not universal, and differ by region and social class. For instance, at a global level, religion is correlated with increased fertility, but in the West less so: Scandinavian countries and France are among the least religious in the EU, but have the highest TFR, while the opposite is true about Portugal, Greece, Cyprus, Poland and Spain.
(see [[Religion in the European Union]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tsdde220&amp;plugin=0 |title=Eurostat - Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface (TGM) table |website=Ec.europa.eu |date=2016-08-11 |accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reproductive health]] can also affect the birth rate, as untreated infections can lead to fertility problems, as can be seen in the "infertility belt" - a region that stretches across central Africa from the United Republic of Tanzania in the east to Gabon in the west, and which has a lower fertility than other African regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/88/12/10-011210/en/|title=WHO - Mother or nothing: the agony of infertility|website=www.who.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=2900173 | volume=26 | title=Infertility in Central Africa: infection is the cause | year=1988 | journal=Int J Gynaecol Obstet | pages=423–8 | last1 = Collet | first1 = M | last2 = Reniers | first2 = J | last3 = Frost | first3 = E | last4 = Gass | first4 = R | last5 = Yvert | first5 = F | last6 = Leclerc | first6 = A | last7 = Roth-Meyer | first7 = C | last8 = Ivanoff | first8 = B | last9 = Meheus | first9 = A | doi=10.1016/0020-7292(88)90340-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Child custody laws, affecting fathers' parental rights over their children from birth until child custody ends at age 18, may have an effect on the birth rate. [[U.S. state]]s strict in enforcing [[child support]] have up to 20 percent fewer unmarried births than states that are lax about getting unmarried fathers to pay, the researchers found. Moreover, according to the results, if all 50 states in the United States had done at least as well in their enforcement efforts as the state ranked fifth from the top, that would have led to a 20 percent reduction in out-of-wedlock births.&lt;ref name="archive1"/&gt;

== Transformation ==
In electrical and electronic engineering, transformation from time domain to another domain such as frequency domain is used to focus more on details of the waveform. Many of the details can be analyzed much easier when this transformation is done to waveform, when it goes to another domain. Different methods are present to do transformation from time domain to frequency domain; one of them is the '''Blackman–Tukey transformation''' method that also uses [[Fast Fourier transform]]. To meet the filter specification according to requirements, several methods are used, including windowing effect.

==Statistical estimation==
Statically estimation is to determine the expected value(s) of statistical expected values of statistical quantities. Statistical estimation also tries to find the [[expected values]]. The expected values are those values that we expect among the random values, derived from samples of population in probability (group of subset). Because we have problem here, and in time series analysis, discrete data obtained as a function of time is usually available rather than samples of population or group of subsets taken simultaneously. The difficulty is commonly avoided by the process which is named [[ergodic]] process, that changes with time and probability gets involved with it, and it's not always [[Frequencies|periodic]] at all portions of time.

== Blackman–Tukey transformation methods ==
This method has some procedures such as:
# Calculation of the [[autocorrelation]] function of the data
# Applying a suitable [[window function]], and finally
# Computing a FFT of the data for obtaining the power density spectrum.

Autocorrelation function makes the wave smoothed rather than the averaging several waveforms. This function is set to window, the corresponding waveform toward its extremes.
Computation gets faster if more data is correlated and if memory capacity of the system increases then overlap save sectioning technique would be applied. If the autocorrelation function in Blackman–Tukey is computed using FFT then it will name fast correlation method for spectral estimation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="655">'''Callaïs''' is the name of a green stone used for making beads by western European [[archaeological culture|cultures]] of the later [[Neolithic]] and Early [[Bronze Age]]. It was described by [[Pliny the Elder]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/37*.html#56 (NH&amp;nbsp;XXXVII.lvi.151)] as being paler than [[lapis lazuli]].

Its source was probably [[Brittany]], near Locmariaquer where numerous [[turquoise]] items have been found, although this has not been confirmed.

A '''cement bond log''' documents the evaluation of the integrity of [[cement]] work performed on an [[oil well]].&lt;ref name="OilfieldGlossary1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=cement%20bond%20log|title=cement bond log|accessdate=2008-12-18|publisher=Schlumberger Limited|work=Oilfield Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the process of drilling and completing a well, cement is injected through the [[wellbore]] and rises up the [[Annulus (well)|annulus]] between the steel [[Casing (borehole)|casing]] and the [[Geological formation|formation]].&lt;ref name="OilfieldGlossary2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=casing|title=casing|accessdate=2008-12-18|publisher=Schlumberger Limited|work=Oilfield Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sonic tool is typically run on [[wireline (cabling)|wireline]] by a service company that detects the bond of the cement to the casing and formation via a principle based on [[resonance]]. Casing that is not bound has a higher resonant vibration than that which is bound, causing the imparted energy from the sonic signal to be transferred to the formation.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} In this sense, the [[amplitude]] of the [[waveform]] received is the basic measurement that is evaluated.

The data is collected by the tool and recorded on a log which is used by the oil producing company as an indicator of [[zonal isolation]] in the well. There are production reasons and legal reasons (governed by a petroleum regulatory body in each individual state) that dictate the well must have specific areas of isolation.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2214">'''Contact''' is an annual interdisciplinary conference that brings together [http://www.contact-conference.com/archive/org.html renowned social and space scientists, science fiction writers and artists] to exchange ideas, stimulate new perspectives, and encourage serious, creative speculation about humanity's future. The intent of Contact is to promote the integration of [[human factor]]s into space research and policy, to explore the intersection of science and art, and to develop ethical approaches to [[extraterrestrial intelligence|cross-cultural contact]]. Since its beginnings, the Contact conference has fostered interdisciplinary inquiries into art, literature, exploration and scientific investigation.

Contact was conceived by anthropologist Jim Funaro in 1979, and the first formal conference was held in 1983 in [[Santa Cruz, California]]. Twenty-six annual events have followed and several held at [[NASA Ames Research Center]]. In many previous years, the COTI HI project involved teams of high school students in the creation of scientifically accurate extraterrestrial beings, and in simulated encounters between two such races. 

Many spin-off organizations have formed, on line, and as far away as Japan. One such organization is the [[Contact consortium]], which is focused on the medium of contact in multi-user [[virtual world]]s on the [[Internet]].  

Contact has been closely allied with the [[SETI Institute]], and its early participants created the hypothetical planet Epona.

The 27th  Contact conference was held on March 31 - April 2, 2012 at the [[SETI Institute]] and the Domain Hotel, in [[Sunnyvale, California]]. Beginning with the 28th conference, held in Mountain View, the organization adopted a biennial schedule. The 29th conference was held on April 1st-3rd, 2016, at the Domain Hotel, California.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8396">'''Courtship disorder''' is a theoretical construct in [[sexology]] in which a certain set of [[paraphilias]] are seen as specific instances of anomalous [[courtship]] instincts in men.&lt;ref name="aggrawal"&gt;{{cite book |first=Anil |last=Aggrawal |title=Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |location=Boca Raton |year=2009 |isbn=1-4200-4308-0 |url=http://crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781420043082}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific paraphilias are [[biastophilia]] (paraphilic [[rape]]), [[exhibitionism]], [[frotteurism]], [[telephone scatologia]], and [[voyeurism]]. According to the ''courtship disorder hypothesis'', there is a species-typical courtship process in human males consisting of four phases, and anomalies in different phases result in one of these paraphilic sexual interests. That is, instead of being independent paraphilias, this theory sees these sexual interests as individual symptoms of a single underlying disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Freund, K. |author2=Kolářský, A. |date=1965|title=Grundzüge eines einfachen bezugsystems für die analyse sexueller deviationen ['Basic features of a reference system for considering anomalous erotic preferences']|work=Psychiatrie, Neurologie, and Medizinische Psychologie|volume= 17|pages= 221–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Courtship disorder hypothesis ==
According to the ''courtship disorder hypothesis'', there is a species-typical courtship process in humans consisting of four phases.&lt;ref&gt;Freund, K. (1976). "Diagnosis and treatment of forensically significant anomalous erotic preferences." ''Canadian Journal of Criminology and Corrections'', 18, 181–189.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freund, K., &amp; Blanchard, R. (1986). "The concept of courtship disorder." ''Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy'', 12, 79–92.&lt;/ref&gt; These phases are: "(1) looking for and appraising potential sexual partners; (2) pretactile interaction with those partners, such as by smiling at and talking to them; (3) tactile interaction with them, such as by embracing or petting; (4) and then sexual intercourse."&lt;ref name=Cantor2009&gt;Cantor, J. M., Blanchard, R., &amp; Barbaree, H. E. (2009). Sexual disorders. In P. H. Blaney &amp; T. Millon (Eds.), ''Oxford Textbook of Psychopathology'' (2nd ed.) (pp. 527–548). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The associations between these phases and these paraphilias were first outlined by [[Kurt Freund]],&lt;ref name=Freund1988&gt;Freund, K. (1988). "Courtship disorder: Is the hypothesis valid?" ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'', 528, 172–182.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Freund1983&gt;Freund, K., Scher, H., &amp; Hucker, S. (1983). The courtship disorders. ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'', 12, 369–379.&lt;/ref&gt; the originator of the theory: A disturbance of the search phase of courtship manifests as [[voyeurism]], a disturbance of the pretactile interaction phase manifests as [[exhibitionism]] or [[telephone scatologia]], a disturbance of the tactile interaction phase manifests as toucheurism or [[frotteurism]], and the absence of the courtship behavior phases manifests as paraphilic [[rape]] (i.e., [[biastophilia]]). According to Freund, these paraphilias "can be conceptualized as a preference for a pattern of behavior or [[erotic fantasy]] in which one of these four phases of sexual interaction is intensified and distorted to such an extent that it appears to be a caricature of the normal, while the remaining phases are either omitted entirely or are retained only in a vestigial way."&lt;ref name=Freund1990&gt;Freund, K. (1990). "Courtship disorder." In W. L. Marshall, D. R. Laws, &amp; H. E. Barbaree (Eds.), ''Handbook of Sexual Assault: Issues, Theories, and Treatment of the Offender'' (pp. 195–207). NY: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freund noted that ''[[troilism]]'' (a paraphilia for observing one’s sexual/romantic partner sexually interacting with a third party, usually unbeknownst to the third party)&lt;ref&gt;Hirschfeld, M. (1938). ''Sexual Anomalies and Perversions: Physical and Psychological Development, Diagnosis and Treatment'' (new and revised ed.). London: Encyclopaedic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; might also be a courtship disorder,&lt;ref name=Freund1990/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freund, K., &amp; Watson, R. (1990). "Mapping the boundaries of courtship disorder." ''The Journal of Sex Research'', 27, 589–606.&lt;/ref&gt; troilism being a variant of voyeurism.

Appropriate behaviors depend on the social and cultural context, including time and place. Some behaviors that are unacceptable under most circumstances, such as [[public nudity]] or sexual contact between dancers, may be accepted or even encouraged during celebrations like [[Carnival]] or [[New Orleans Mardi Gras#Nudity and Mardi Gras|Mardi Gras]]. Where such cultural festivals alter normative courtship behaviors, the signs of courtship disorder may be masked or altered.&lt;ref&gt;Maharajh, H. D., &amp; Konings, M. (2007). [https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20083029681 Dancing frotteurism and courtship disorder in Trinidad and Tobago.] ''Journal of Chinese Clinical Medicine'', 7(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evidence and acceptance of the theory ==
Paraphilias within the Courtship Disorder spectrum co-occur with each other more frequently than with paraphilias outside the courtship disorder spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;Abel, G. G., &amp; Osborn, C. (1992). "The paraphilias: The extent and nature of sexually deviant and criminal behavior." ''Psychiatric Clinics of North America'', 15, 675–689.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abel, G. G., Becker, J. V., Cunningham-Rathner, J., Mittelman, M., &amp; Rouleau, J.-L. (1988). "Multiple paraphilic diagnoses among sex offenders." ''Bulletin of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law'', 16, 153–168.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Templeman, T. L., &amp; Stinnet, R. D. (1991). "Patterns of sexual arousal and history in a "normal' sample of young men." ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'', 20, 137–150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fedora, O., Reddon, J. R., Morrison, J. W., Fedora, S. K., Pascoe, H., Yeudall, L. T. (1992). Sadism and other paraphilias in normal controls and nonaggressive sex offenders. ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'', 21, 1–15.&lt;/ref&gt; The courtship disorder model offers an underlying common cause for these paraphilias in men to explain this co-occurrence.&lt;ref name=Freund1988/&gt;&lt;ref name=Freund1983/&gt;

Courtship disorder is widely cited by [[sexology|sexologists]] and forensic scientists as one of the predominant models of the paraphilias.&lt;ref&gt;Maea, M., &amp; Coccaro, E. F. (1998). ''Neurobiology and clinical views on aggression and impulsivity'' (Clinical &amp; neurobiological advances in psychiatry series). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McConaghy, N. (1993). ''Sexual Behavior: Problems and Management''. New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, E., Dwyer, S. M., &amp; Pallone, N. J. (Eds.) (1996). ''Sex Offender Treatment: Biological Dysfunction, Intrapsychic Conflict, and Interpersonal Violence''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krueger, R. B., Kaplan, M. (2001). "The paraphilic and hypersexual disorders: An overview." ''Journal of Psychiatric Practice'', 7, 391–403.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiederman, M. W. (2003). Paraphilia and Fetishism. ''The Family Journal'', 11, 315–321.&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy and Page wrote that "The 'Courtship Disorder Theory' of Freund is one of the only theories specific to exhibitionism."&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, W. D., &amp; Page, I J. (2008). "Exhibitionism: Psychopathology and theory." In D. R. Laws and W. T. O'Donohue (Eds.), ''Sexual deviance: Theory, assessment, and treatment'' (2nd ed.). New York: Guilford&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lavin (2008), "Freund's theory, more than the others, makes it clear that the ordering of activities ... has clinical significance."&lt;ref&gt;Lavin, M. (2008). "Voyeurism: Psychopathology and theory." In D. R. Laws and W. T. O'Donohue (Eds.), ''Sexual Deviance: Theory, Assessment, and Treatment'' (2nd ed.). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theoretically based taxonomy of the paraphilias was proposed by [[John Money]], who described the range of paraphilic interests as [[lovemap|love maps]].&lt;ref&gt;Money, John (1986). ''Love Maps: Clinical Concepts of Sexual/Erotic Health and Pathology, Paraphilia, and Gender Transposition in Childhood, Adolescence, and Maturity''. New York: Prometheus Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''cultural turn''' is a movement beginning in the early 1970s among scholars in the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]] to make [[culture]] the focus of contemporary debates; it also describes a shift in emphasis toward ''meaning'' and away from a [[positivist]] [[epistemology]]. The cultural turn is described in 2005 by [[Lynette Spillman]] and [[Mark D. Jacobs]] as "one of the most influential trends in the humanities and social sciences in the last generation".&lt;ref name="Cultural sociology at the crossroads of the discipline"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacobs|first1=Mark|last2=Spillman|first2=Lynette|title=Cultural sociology at the crossroads of the discipline|journal=Poetics|date=2005|volume=33|issue=1|pages=1–14|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304422X05000045 |deadurl=no |accessdate=25 March 2017|doi=10.1016/j.poetic.2005.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent [[historiographer]] argues that the cultural turn involved a "wide array of new theoretical impulses coming from fields formerly peripheral to the social sciences",&lt;ref name="steinmetz1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinmetz|first=G|title=State/Culture: State-Formation after the Cultural Turn|year=1999|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, NY|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially [[post-structuralism]], cultural studies, literary criticism, and various forms of linguistic analysis, which emphasized "the causal and socially constitutive role of cultural processes and systems of signification".&lt;ref name="steinmetz1"/&gt;

==Background==
The cultural turn in the late 20th century is interpreted as referring to either a substantive shift in society or an analytical shift in academia. The former argues that culture plays a more significant role in advanced societies, which fits with the notion of [[post-modernity]] as an historical era in which people "emphasizes the importance of art and culture for education, moral growth, and social criticism and change".&lt;ref name="sociologyencyclopedia2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steven|first1=Best|title=Culture Turn|journal=Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology |date=2007 |doi=10.1111/b.9781405124331.2007.x |url=http://www.sociologyencyclopedia.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405124331_yr2013_chunk_g97814051243319_ss1-202|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is movement within academia to place the concept of culture, and the related notions of ''meaning'', ''cognition'', ''affect'', and ''symbols'' at the center of methodological and theoretical focus. Some argue that the analytical shift is endogenous to the substantive shift.&lt;ref name="sociologyencyclopedia2007"/&gt;

Culture can be defined as "the social process whereby people communicate meanings, make sense of their world, construct their identities, and define their beliefs and values".&lt;ref name="sociologyencyclopedia2007"/&gt; Or, for [[Georg Simmel]], [[culture]] refers to "the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history". Thus culture can be interpreted on a spectrum from purely individualistic [[solipsism]] to objective forms of social organization and interaction.

==History==

===Analytical shift===
One of the earliest works in which the term "cultural turn" showed up was [[Jeffrey C. Alexander]]'s chapter "The New Theoretical Movement" in [[Neil Smelser]]'s ''Handbook of Sociology'' (1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Jeffrey|title=Handbook of Sociology|year=1988|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Beverly Hills, CA|pages=77–101|editor=Smelser, N. J.|chapter=The New Theoretical Movement}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander, rightly pointed out that the origins of the cultural turn should be traced in the debate of idealism and materialism i.e. Marx and Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Eyerman|first=Ron|title=Jeffrey Alexander and the Cultural Turn in Social Theory|year=2004|publisher=Thesis Eleven&amp;#124;No. 79|pages=25–30|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the labeling of the movement, in the 1970s, "foundational works underlying and facilitating the turn to cultural forms of analysis" emerged: [[Hayden White]]'s ''[[Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe]]'' (1973), [[Clifford Geertz]]'s ''The Interpretation of Cultures: Selected Essays'' (1973), [[Michel Foucault]]'s ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (1977), and [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s ''Outline of a Theory of Practice'' (1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bonnell, V. E.  |author2=Hunt, L.|title=Beyond the Cultural Turn|year=1999|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the earlier twentieth century experienced a linguistic turn, mostly brought about by the thought of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], the cultural turn of the late twentieth century absorbed those criticisms and built on them.

The cultural turn has helped [[cultural studies]] to gain more respect as an academic discipline. With the shift away from [[high culture|high arts]] the discipline has increased its perceived importance and influence on other disciplines.

British historian Heather Jones argues that the [[World War I#Historiography|historiography of the First World War]] has been reinvigorated by the cultural turn in recent years.  Scholars have raised entirely new questions regarding military occupation, radicalizion of politics, race, and the male body.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Jones,  "As the centenary approaches: the regeneration of First World War historiography." ''Historical Journal'' (2013) 56#3 pp: 857-878&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substantive shift===
The cultural turn as an historical era that breaks substantively with the past is only tangentially related to cultural turn as analytical shift. Proponents of the former argue that:

{{quote|“The very sphere of culture itself has expanded, becoming coterminous with market society in such a way that the cultural is no longer limited to its earlier, traditional or experimental forms, but it is consumed throughout daily life itself, in shopping, in professional activities, in the various often televisual forms of leisure, in production for the market and in the consumption of those market products, indeed in the most secret folds and corners of the quotidian. Social space is now completely saturated with the image of culture.”|[[Fredric Jameson]]| 1998, p. 111&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jameson|first=Fredric|title=The Cultural Turn: Selected Writings on the Postmodern, 1983-1998|year=1998|publisher=Verso|location=Brooklyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Advertising]], [[amateur photography]], [[yellow journalism]] and an assortment of other forms of media arose after the politically charged 1960s. Moreover, this media was [[multicultural]], and attempted to target all races, ethnicities and age groups, as opposed to more exclusive media prior to the 1960s. This "[[new media]]" of a [[postmodern]] America brought about an expansion and differentiation of culture, which has only been rapidly expanded by the [[Internet]] and [[social media]].

==In rural studies==
In recent years, there has been something of a resurgence in [[rural studies]], which has become somewhat more mainstream than previously in the academic space of social science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woods|first=M|title=Rural geography|date=2005|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing numbers of people have taken on important dualistic questions of society/space, nature/culture structure/agency and self/other from the perspective of rural studies. However, it is the 'cultural turn' in wider social science which has lent both respectability and excitement to the nexus with rurality, particularly with new foci on landscape, otherness and the spatiality of nature. With a conceptual fascination with difference, and a methodological fascination with [[ethnography]], cultural studies have provided a significant [[palimpsest]]ual overlay onto existing landscapes of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cloke|first=P|title=Country backwater to virtual village? Rural studies and 'the cultural turn'|journal=Journal of Rural Studies|date=October 1998|volume=13|issue=4|pages=367–375|doi=10.1016/s0743-0167(97)00053-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Election law''' is a discipline falling at the juncture of [[constitutional law]] and [[political science]]. It researches "the politics of law and the law of politics". The conceptual knowledge behind election law focuses on who votes, when that person can vote, and the construction behind the tabulated totals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aceproject.org/ace-en/topics/lf/lfa/lfa03/lfa03c|title=Electoral Laws —|website=aceproject.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues ==
Some of the questions that are addressed by election law are:

* Which people are [[Suffrage|entitled to vote]] in an [[election]] (e.g. age, residency or literacy requirements, or [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]]), and the procedures by which such persons must [[voter registration|register to vote]] or present identification in order to vote
* Which people are entitled to hold office (for example, age, residency, birth or citizenship requirements), and the procedures [[candidate]]s must follow to appear on the ballot (such as the formatting and filing of [[nominating petition]]s) and rules governing [[write-in candidate]]s
* The rules about what subjects may be submitted to a direct popular vote through a [[referendum]] or plebiscite, and the rules that governmental agencies or citizen groups must follow to place questions on the ballot for public consideration
* The framework by which [[political parties]] may organize their internal government, and how they select candidates to run for political office (e.g. [[primary election]]s)
* The financing of elections (e.g. contribution limits, rules for [[public financing of elections]], the public disclosure of contributors, and rules governing [[interest group]]s other than a candidate's campaign organization)
* The requirements for creating districts which elect representatives to a legislative assembly (examples include [[congressional district]]s, [[electoral district (Canada)|ridings]] or wards within a municipality)
* What restrictions are placed on campaign advocacy (such as rules on anonymous or [[false advertising]])
* How votes are cast at an election (including whether to use a paper [[ballot]], or some other form of recording votes such as a mechanical [[voting machine]] or [[electronic voting]] device, and how information is presented to voters on the ballot or device)
* How votes are counted at an election, recounts, and election challenges
* Whether, and how, voters or candidates may file legal actions in a [[court|court of law]] or administrative agency to enforce their rights or contest the outcome of an election
* Definition of [[electoral fraud]] and other [[crime]]s against the electoral system
* The sources of election law (for example, constitutions, national statutes, state statutes, or judicial decisions) and the interplay between these sources of law

== Regimes in comparative law ==

=== France ===

The French electoral code addresses most of the elections. However, other texts frame this material for special elections. Thus the Constitution but fixed some general basic provisions concerning the presidential election, the legislative and senatorial elections.

For litigation election, the court depends on the concerned election. The Constitutional Council is responsible for the most important elections: presidential elections and senatorial elections or referendums. In contrast, to the municipal or district elections the administrative tribunal has jurisdiction, then the appeal is to the State Council. Finally, for the regional and European elections, the Council of State which has jurisdiction at first and last resort.

In decisions on electoral matters, the law takes into account the results: if an essential principle is violated, the election is canceled but if fraud is "classic" (ballot stuffing, failure to register as voters, vote the dead ...) but the election was won (after counting of ballots invalidated) with a large or very large lead, the judge then cancels rarely the result.&lt;ref&gt;On the other side, opposite judgement comes when the participation of the lists has resulted in an imbalance, also because the deviation of the votes between the two clusters is less than one thousand ballotts: {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title= La partecipazione (viziata) delle liste produce uno squilibrio nel voto|journal=Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online|date=2001| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89309068}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italy ===
The Italian Constitution fixes some general basic provisions concerning the legislative elections.
Electoral disputes in Italy are complex because they are divided between several court orders. For example, with regard to the dispute concerning registration of candidates for ballots or litigation election, the administrative court has jurisdiction. For eligibility and disfranchisement, the judge is the ordinary tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;"A principle of separation of powers ( ... ) is the rationale of the law ( ... ) which ousts the administrative courts from ineligibility dispute": {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Il giudicato civile in materia elettorale preclude l'azione popolare davanti al Tar|journal= Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online |date=2000| url=  https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89298285}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a fraud is proven by the judge, it does not cancel necessarily the elections,&lt;ref&gt;The faults, as null and void, cannot justify a reversal "by forfeit" of the electoral outcome: {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Elezioni Molise: gestione incerta fino all'annullamento definitivo|journal= Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online |date=2000| url=  https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89298439}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; unless they think that the result of election without the fraud would not have been identical. The survival of the acts already performed by the elected organs would seem solved by abundant case law that protects innocent trust of third parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = L'incandidabilità di un eletto travolge il consiglio regionale abruzzese (e ripropone gli interrogativi molisani)|journal= Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online |date=2002| url=  https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89310220}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{UK}} ===
In the [[United Kingdom]], election law is legislated for by The [[Houses of Parliament]]. The statutory governance of UK Election law comes from acts of parliament such as the [[Fixed Term Parliaments Act 2011]]. The Electoral Commission's mandate and establishment was set out in the [[Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000]] (PPERA), and ranges from the regulation of political donations and expenditure by political and third parties through to promoting greater participation in the electoral process.

The [[Electoral Administration Act 2006]] made a number of improvements to electoral registration, improving the security arrangements for absent voting, allowing observers to attend elections and a major change in reducing the minimum age for candidates at UK parliamentary elections. It also introduced the performance standards regime for electoral services.

'''Emanuel Winternitz''' (1898–1983) was the first curator of the Department of Musical Instruments at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City. In 1973 he was named curator emeritus but continued to teach and work at the museum until his death in 1983.

==Career==
Born in Austria, Winternitz served in WWI and practiced law in Vienna in the 1920s and 1930s.

With other Viennese Jewish intellectuals, he emigrated to the United States in 1938, after the Anschluss. Winternitz came to the Met as a lecturer in 1941, became a full-time employee and "Keeper" of the instruments the following year, and was named Curator in 1949 when Musical Instruments was made a curatorial department. At the [[Metropolitan Museum of Arts]] [[Metropolitan Museum of Art#Musical instruments|Department of Musical Instruments]], Winternitz was responsible for saving the musical instruments collection from a plan to turn them over to a Music Library proposed by [[Juilliard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kopp|first=Leslie Hansen |last2= |first2= |date= 2004|title=MUSIC FORGOTTEN AND REMEMBERED: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF EMANUEL WINTERNITZ |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/50227623/music-forgotten-remembered-life-times-emanuel-winternitz |journal= Music in Art: International Journal for Music Iconography|volume=29 |issue=1/2 |pages=6 |doi= |access-date= 29 November 2016|quote= Emanuel Winternitz (1898-1983), the distinguished curator of musical instruments at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for more than forty years, was the father of the field of musical iconography...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://metmuseum.atavist.com/musicalinstrumentshistory#chapter-117894|title=A Harmonious Ensemble Musical Instruments at the Metropolitan Museum, 1884–2014, Emanuel Winternitz and the Renaissance of the Collection |last=Lindsey |first=Rebecca M. |date= |website=metmuseum.atavist.com |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |access-date= 29 November 2016|quote=...Winternitz's hard work to save the musical instruments for the Museum seemed on the point of fruition when the war was over.

'''Executive education''' (ExEd or Exec. Ed) refers to academic programs at graduate-level [[business school]]s worldwide for executives, business leaders and functional managers. These programs are generally non-credit and non-degree-granting, but sometimes lead to [[Academic certificate|certificate]]s and some offer [[Continuing education unit|continuing education units]] accepted by professional bodies and institutes. Estimates by ''[[Business Week]]'' magazine suggest that executive education in the United States is approximately an $800 million annual business&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/content/oct2001/bs20011015_3309.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914060629/http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/content/oct2001/bs20011015_3309.htm |archive-date=2011-09-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with approximately 80 percent provided by university-based business schools. Key players in university-based executive education span elite{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} universities, as well as many regional and mid-sized universities and business schools around the world.

Customized programs, which are tailored for and offered to executives of a single company, represent the fastest growing segment of the market.&lt;ref&gt;Leadership by Design, Albert A. Vicere, Robert M. Fulmer, (1998) {{ISBN|0875848311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customized programs help organizations increase management capability by combining the science of business and performance management into specialized programs that enable executives to develop new knowledge, skills and attitudes. Knowledge translates into the capability an organization applies to the products and services it brings to the marketplace. Research shows that a firm with a clearly articulated and understood business and capability strategy will have a higher market-to-book value than a firm that does not.&lt;ref&gt;Maritan C. and Schnatterly K. (2004) [http://www.csom.umn.edu/assets/42582.pdf Intangible Assets as Drivers of Value: Technology, Capabilities and Management Systems].&lt;/ref&gt;

Open enrollment programs also are available as part of university-based executive education offerings, which occur throughout the year on selected dates, and are available to participants from different companies and organizations.

Shorter executive education programs tend to focus on specific roles or industries, or on improving specific [[leadership skills]], such as persuasion, negotiation, [[teambuilding]] or communication.

Some executive education providers offer more comprehensive management training options, such as the modular "Advanced Management Program" (AMP) offered independently by several business schools.

University-based executive education programs, and customized programs in particular, include serious engagement among executives, senior business faculty and researchers who are on the leading edge of business thought and management theory development. It has been noted that “executive education is the toughest classroom there is”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acu.edu.au/staff/our_university/publications/acu_update/2012/issue_1/new_directorate_at_acu|title=New Directorate at ACU|first=|last=Unknown|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (besides other academic fields such as the hard sciences or engineering) because time-pressed and demanding executives challenge each other in the classroom as much or more as their professors. The programs are credited{{By whom|date=March 2012}} with offering unique networking and personal career development opportunities for participants, as well as opportunities for universities to build stronger [[alumni network]]s that also benefit younger, traditional MBA program graduates through networking, internships and job opportunities.

Not all observers of university-based executive education are positive. There is some debate about the nature of business school education as a form of professional development. Some believe that university-based executive education has caused some business schools to "lose track of their professional mission." This argument is made by [[Rakesh Khurana]] among others.&lt;ref name=r2&gt;Khurana, R. (2007) [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8463.html From higher aims to hired hands: The social transformation of American business schools and the unfulfilled promise of management as a profession]. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The genesis of executive education can be traced to [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]] and his 1911 treatise [[Principles of Scientific Management]]. This book described how the application of the scientific method to the management of workers could improve productivity. Taylor's ideas, also known as "Taylorism"&lt;ref name=t&gt;[http://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/Anthro/Anth101/taylorism_and_fordism.htm Taylorism and Fordism]. Vanderbilt.edu. Retrieved on 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt; would become the standard for businesses worldwide.&lt;ref name=r2/&gt;

On the heels of Taylorism came The [[Alfred P. Sloan]] School of Management, which in 1914 began offering Course XV, Engineering Administration, at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. At that time, the concept of providing business training in the academic environment was gaining popularity, thus MIT created a program “specially designed to train men to be competent managers of businesses that have much to do with engineering problems.” Harvard also began offering short five-week selections of standard MBA material in the late 1920s.&lt;ref name=t/&gt;

In 1930 Course XV at [http://mitsloan.mit.edu/newsroom/history.php MIT] became an independent department and was named the Department of Business and Engineering Administration. In 1931 an innovative program for executive development was initiated with the backing of several industrialists. This one-year program — offering graduate study in the fundamentals of management and decision-making — was aimed at young managers who were nominated by their employers and was highly competitive. In 1938 the program received full funding by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and was formally named the MIT Sloan Fellowship Program for Executive Development at MIT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitsloan.mit.edu/newsroom/history.php History of MIT Sloan – MIT Sloan Newsroom]. Mitsloan.mit.edu. Retrieved on 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive Education in the United States developed critical mass after World War II. The Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944 — commonly known as the [[GI Bill of Rights]] — allowed veterans to take advantage of education benefits.  Many studied business in college, a privilege previously only enjoyed by the wealthy.&lt;ref name=gibill&gt;[http://www.gibill.va.gov/gi_bill_info/history.htm GI Bill History – U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs]. Gibill.va.gov. Retrieved on 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent executive education programs, including the 13-week Advanced Management Program at Harvard University and the four-week Institute for Management at Northwestern University’s School of Commerce (now the Kellogg School of Management), developed in response to the need to rapidly train line executives for general management in the post World War II era.

By the late 1970s nearly 20 business schools in the United States were offering some form of executive education. The science of business also was developing at a rapid pace as faculty, such as [[Michael Porter]] (Harvard ) and [[C. K. Prahalad]] (University of Michigan), published academic papers that changed the way people thought and acted within companies.

Prahalad&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/authors/prahalad C.K. Prahalad – Harvard Business Review]. Hbr.org. Retrieved on 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt; is most notably remembered for developing the concepts of “core competencies” and “strategic intent”. These and other respected academic business thinkers — Don Hambrick, Ram Charan, David Ulrich, Michael Hammer, Gary Hamel and many others — are the true pioneers of executive education and the ongoing effort to facilitate wealth creation and other new concepts aimed at making stronger businesses while improving the welfare of the world.

Throughout the 1970s university-based executive education continued to evolve as an industry. Several on-campus residential facilities were constructed at several universities, demonstrating the value of a standalone facility dedicated to executive education programs. This spurred the development of such facilities at schools nationwide and the subsequent expansion of short open enrollment programs. The industry’s exclusive professional association, The International University Consortium for Executive Education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniconexed.org|title=Global Consortium for University-Based Executive Education - Unicon|website=UNICON}}&lt;/ref&gt; also came into existence during this period. UNICON began sponsoring a tradeshow in the 1970s for companies interested in learning about university-based executive education and an annual conference for members. UNICON has since grown into a consortium of nearly 100 universities with executive education programs around the globe. It sponsors three annual conferences that allow members to share best practices, conducts research into topics of concern and provides benchmarking data for members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uniconexed.org Welcome to UNICON, the International University Consortium for Executive Education]. Uniconexed.org (2007-01-31). Retrieved on 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive education further developed in the 1980s and 1990s as the increasing pace and scope of global business demanded higher levels of education among employees. The [[dot-com bubble|dot-com]] boom further changed the scope of the business landscape by favoring employees and organizations that were quick to adapt to change. As longstanding business concepts became obsolete, continual training was necessary – but earning a degree was not.

In a 1999 survey of 63 programs, the [[University of Michigan Business School]] topped the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/929014|title=University of Michigan Business School|website=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the next survey in 2001, the number of programs had doubled to 121, with a doubling of revenues to $800M.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2001-10-14/a-mid-career-boost|title=A Mid-Career Boost|date=15 October 2001|publisher=|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the survey, Executive education growth was dramatically impacted by travel restrictions and economic impact of the [[September 11 attacks]].

==Current situation==

The participation of many of the most prestigious universities around the world has enhanced the value of university-based executive education. Ongoing business challenges and opportunities – a dynamic economy, developing technologies, new business models and [[globalization]] – has made the emphasis on learning new concepts throughout ones career a necessity.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Despite the growing popularity of university-based executive education around the world, the global economic recession has slowed the industry’s growth during the past few years. According to a 2011 study conducted by the [[Manchester Business School]] in partnership with [[Dubai International Academic City]] and [[Dubai Knowledge Village]], the global economic downturn has had a negative impact on learning and development spending within the Middle East. More than half the respondents noted that spending on executive education had been “significantly” affected, while other organizations agreed that spending had been “somewhat” affected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zawya.com/story.cfm/sidZAWYA20110228112046?q=TECOM%20Research Significant Number of GCC Companies Yet to Engage in Executive Education, Reveals Manchester Business School-TECOM Research], 28 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A return to higher participation appears to be coming as the economy shows more signs of improvement.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} A substantial portion of the organizations surveyed by Manchester Business School said they anticipate executive education spending to moderately increase during the next three years.

The situation is similar in other parts of the world according to a late 2010 state of the industry survey conducted by UNICON,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://uniconexed.org/in-the-news/c-change-strategies-03-05-2011.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-03-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411000713/http://uniconexed.org/in-the-news/c-change-strategies-03-05-2011.html |archive-date=2011-04-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which found that many prestigious universities with executive education programs around the world expect notably higher enrollment during 2011. Sixty-five percent of UNICON survey participants predicted increased participation in their open enrollment programs this year. Additionally, 78 percent of schools projected an increase in customized executive education programs during 2011. Nearly half of the schools surveyed indicated an increase in their number of programming days, now offering up to 39 weeks in open enrollment programs and an average of 49 weeks in custom programs. Slightly more than half also reported increasing the number of days that educational programs for executives are offered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uniconexed.org/in-the-news/c-change-strategies-03-05-2011.html Executive Education in the News – March 4, 2011 – Executive Education Momentum Sign of Economic Recovery, Cindy Bielke, C-change Strategies].

==Rankings==

Executive education rankings are carried out annually by the [[Financial Times]] and by [[Bloomberg BusinessWeek]].

Ranking may be based on aims achieved, % of women, average rank, country, course design, fac. diversity, facilities, faculty, follow-up, food, growth, intl. location, intl. participants, revenues, participants, partner schools, preparation, skills, teaching, and other criteria.

The '''H'''paII tiny fragment '''E'''nrichment by '''L'''igation-mediated [[Polymerase chain reaction|'''P'''CR]] Assay (HELP Assay)&lt;ref name="pmid16809668" /&gt; is one of several techniques used for determining whether DNA has been [[DNA_methylation#Assays_to_Detect_DNA_Methylation|methylated]]. The technique can be adapted to examine DNA methylation within and around individual [[genes]], or it can be expanded to examine methylation in an entire [[genome]].

The technique relies upon the properties of two [[restriction enzymes]]: ''Hpa''II and ''Msp''I. The HELP assay&lt;ref name=pmid16809668&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Khulan B, Thompson RF, Ye K, etal |title=Comparative isoschizomer profiling of cytosine methylation: The HELP assay |journal=Genome Research |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=1046–55 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16809668 |pmc=1524864 |doi=10.1101/gr.5273806}}&lt;/ref&gt; compares representations generated by ''Hpa''II and by ''Msp''I digestion of the genome followed by ligation-mediated PCR. ''Hpa''II only digests 5'-C'''CG'''G-3' sites when the cytosine in the central CG dinucleotide is unmethylated, the ''Hpa''II representation is enriched for the hypomethylated fraction of the genome. The ''Msp''I representation is a control for copy number changes and [[PCR]] amplification difficulties.

It was recently shown that cytosine methylation patterns tend to be concordant over short (~1 kb) regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Eckhardt F, Lewin J, Cortese R, etal |title=DNA methylation profiling of human chromosomes 6, 20 and 22 |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=38 |issue=12 |pages=1378–85 |date=December 2006 |pmid=17072317 |doi=10.1038/ng1909 |pmc=3082778}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patterns represented by the ''Hpa''II sites therefore tend to be representative of other CG dinucleotides locally.

The analysis of HELP data involves quality analysis and normalization. An analytical pipeline written in the [[R programming language]] was recently published to allow HELP data processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Thompson RF, Reimers M, Khulan B, etal |title=An analytical pipeline for genomic representations used for cytosine methylation studies |journal=Bioinformatics |volume=24 |issue=9 |pages=1161–7 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18353789 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btn096|pmc=5061929 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inductive programming''' ('''IP''') is a special area of [[automatic programming]], covering research from [[artificial intelligence]] and [[Computer programming|programming]], which addresses [[machine learning|learning]] of typically [[declarative programming|declarative]] ([[logic programming|logic]] or [[functional programming|functional]]) and often [[recursion|recursive]] programs from incomplete specifications, such as input/output examples or constraints.

Depending on the programming language used, there are several kinds of inductive programming. '''Inductive functional programming''', which uses functional programming languages such as [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] or [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], and most especially [[inductive logic programming]], which uses logic programming languages such as [[Prolog]] and other logical representations  such as [[description logics]], have been more prominent, but other (programming) language paradigms have also been used, such as [[constraint programming]] or [[probabilistic programming language|probabilistic programming]].

== Definition ==

Inductive programming incorporates all approaches which are concerned with learning programs or algorithms from incomplete ([[formal specification|formal]]) specifications. Possible inputs in an IP system are a set of training inputs and corresponding outputs or an output evaluation function, describing the desired behavior of the intended program, [[Tracing (software)|traces]] or action sequences which describe the process of calculating specific outputs, [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraints]] for the program to be induced concerning its time efficiency or its complexity, various kinds of background knowledge such as standard [[data type]]s, predefined functions to be used, program schemes or templates describing the data flow of the intended program, heuristics for guiding the search for a solution or other biases.

Output of an IP system is a program in some arbitrary programming language containing conditionals and loop or recursive control structures, or any other kind of [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]] [[Knowledge representation and reasoning|representation]] language.

In many applications the output program must be correct with respect to the examples and partial specification,  and this leads to the consideration of inductive programming as a special area inside automatic programming or [[program synthesis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=A.W.|last1=Biermann|title=Automatic programming|editor1-first=S.C.|editor1-last=Shapiro|journal=Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence|pages=18–35|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=C.|last1=Rich|first2=R.C.|last2=Waters|title=Approaches to automatic programming|editor1-first=M.C.|editor1-last=Yovits|journal=Advances in Computers|volume=37|year=1993|url=http://www.merl.com/publications/docs/TR92-04.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually opposed to 'deductive' program synthesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=M.L.|editor1-last=Lowry|editor2-first=R.D.|editor2-last=McCarthy|title=Automatic software design|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Z.|last1=Manna|first2=R.|last2=Waldinger|title=Fundamentals of deductive program synthesis|journal=IEEE Trans Softw Eng|volume=18 | issue = 8|pages=674–704|year=1992|doi=10.1109/32.153379|citeseerx=10.1.1.51.817}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=P.|last1=Flener|title=Achievements and prospects of program synthesis|editor1-first=A.|editor1-last=Kakas|editor2-first=F.|editor2-last=Sadri|journal=Computational Logic: Logic Programming and Beyond; Essays in Honour of Robert A.

In other cases, inductive programming is seen as a more general area where any declarative programming or representation language can be used and we may even have some degree of error in the examples, as in general [[machine learning]], the more specific area of [[structure mining]] or the area of [[symbolic artificial intelligence]]. A distinctive feature is the number of examples or partial specification needed. Typically, inductive programming techniques can learn from just a few examples.

The diversity of inductive programming usually comes from the applications and the languages that are used: apart from logic programming and functional programming, other programming paradigms and representation languages have been used or suggested in inductive programming, such as [[functional logic programming]], [[constraint programming]], [[probabilistic programming language|probabilistic programming]], [[abductive logic programming]], [[modal logic]], [[action language]]s, agent languages and many types of [[imperative languages]].

== History ==

Research on the inductive synthesis of recursive functional programs started in the early 1970s and was brought onto firm theoretical foundations with the seminal THESIS system of Summers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=P.D.|last1=Summers|title=A methodology for LISP program construction from examples|journal=J ACM|volume=24 | issue = 1|pages=161–175|year=1977|doi=10.1145/321992.322002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and work of Biermann.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=A.W.|last1=Biermann|title=The inference of regular LISP programs from examples|journal=IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern|volume=8 | issue = 8|pages=585–600|year=1978|doi=10.1109/tsmc.1978.4310035}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These approaches were split into two phases: first, input-output examples are transformed into non-recursive programs (traces) using a small set of basic operators; second, regularities in the traces are searched for and used to fold them into a recursive program.  The main results until the mid 1980s are surveyed by Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=D.R.|last1=Smith|title=The synthesis of LISP programs from examples: a survey|editor1-first=A.W.|editor1-last=Biermann|editor2-first=G.|editor2-last=Guiho|journal=Automatic Program Construction Techniques|pages=307–324|year=1984|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239059541}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to limited progress with respect to the range of programs that could be synthesized, research activities decreased significantly in the next decade.

The advent of logic programming brought a new elan but also a new direction in the early 1980s, especially due to the MIS system of Shapiro&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=E.Y.|last1=Shapiro|title=Algorithmic program debugging|publisher=The MIT Press|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually spawning the new field of inductive logic programming (ILP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Muggleton | first1 = S. | title = Inductive logic programming | doi = 10.1007/BF03037089 | journal = New Generation Computing | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 295–318 | year = 1991 | pmid =  | pmc = | citeseerx = 10.1.1.329.5312 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The early works of Plotkin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Gordon D.|last1=Plotkin|title=A Note on Inductive Generalization|editor1-first=B.|editor1-last=Meltzer|editor2-first=D.|editor2-last=Michie|journal=Machine Intelligence|volume=5|pages=153–163|year=1970|url=http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/gdp/publications/MI5_note_ind_gen.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Gordon D.|last1=Plotkin|title=A Further Note on Inductive Generalization|editor1-first=B.|editor1-last=Meltzer|editor2-first=D.|editor2-last=Michie|journal=Machine Intelligence|volume=6|pages=101–124|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his "''relative least general generalization (rlgg)''", had an enormous impact in inductive logic programming. Most of ILP work addresses a wider class of problems, as the focus is not only on recursive logic programs but on machine learning of symbolic hypotheses from logical representations. However, there were some encouraging results on learning recursive Prolog programs such as quicksort from examples together with suitable background knowledge, for example with GOLEM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=S.H.|last1=Muggleton|first2=C.|last2=Feng|title=Efficient induction of logic programs|journal=Proceedings of the Workshop on Algorithmic Learning Theory|volume=6|pages=368–381|year=1990|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6a66/9636e0ada62a0fb444e95435e24fdbdf4dbd.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; But again, after initial success, the community got disappointed by limited progress about the induction of recursive programs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; with ILP less and less focusing on recursive programs and leaning more and more towards a machine learning setting with applications in [[relational data mining]] and knowledge discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Sašo|last1=Džeroski|contribution=Inductive Logic Programming and Knowledge Discovery in Databases|pages=117–152|editor1-first=U.M.|editor1-last=Fayyad|editor2-first=G.|editor2-last=Piatetsky-Shapiro|editor3-first=P.|editor3-last=Smith|editor4-first=R.|editor4-last=Uthurusamy|title=Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining|publisher=MIT Press|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Here again, functional programs are learned from sets of positive examples together with an output evaluation (fitness) function which specifies the desired input/output behavior of the program to be learned.

The early work in [[grammar induction]] (also known as grammatical inference) is related to inductive programming, as rewriting systems or logic programs can be used to represent production rules. In fact, early works in inductive inference considered grammar induction and Lisp program inference as basically the same problem.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The results in terms of learnability were related to classical concepts, such as identification-in-the-limit, as introduced in the seminal work of Gold.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the language learning problem was addressed by the inductive programming community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Stephen|last1=Muggleton|title=Inductive Logic Programming: Issues, Results and the Challenge of Learning Language in Logic|journal=Artificial Intelligence|volume=114|pages=283–296|year=1999|doi=10.1016/s0004-3702(99)00067-3}}; here: Sect.2.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In the recent years, the classical approaches have been resumed and advanced with great success. Therefore, the synthesis problem has been reformulated on the background of constructor-based term rewriting systems taking into account modern techniques of functional programming, as well as moderate use of search-based strategies and usage of background knowledge as well as automatic invention of subprograms. Many new and successful applications have recently appeared beyond program synthesis, most especially in the area of data manipulation, programming by example and cognitive modelling (see below).

Other ideas have also been explored with the common characteristic of using declarative languages for the representation of hypotheses. For instance, the use of higher-order features, schemes or structured distances have been advocated for a better handling of recursive data types and structures;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; abstraction has also been explored as a more powerful approach to [[cumulative learning]] and function invention.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

One powerful paradigm that has been recently used for the representation of hypotheses in inductive programming (generally in the form of [[generative model]]s) is [[probabilistic programming language|probabilistic programming]] (and related paradigms, such as stochastic logic programs and Bayesian logic programming).&lt;ref&gt;

The [http://www.cogsys.wiai.uni-bamberg.de/aaip05/objectives.html first workshop on Approaches and Applications of Inductive Programming (AAIP) ] held in conjunction with [[ICML]] 2005 identified all applications where "learning of programs or recursive rules are called for, [...] first in the domain of software engineering where structural learning, software assistants and software agents can help to relieve programmers from routine tasks, give programming support for end users, or support of novice programmers and programming tutor systems. Further areas of application are language learning, learning recursive control rules for AI-planning, learning recursive concepts in web-mining or for data-format transformations".

Since then, these and many other areas have shown to be successful application niches for inductive programming, such as [[End-user development|end-user programming]],&lt;ref&gt;

'''Institute for Personal Robots in Education''' ('''IPRE''') was initiated by a [[United States dollar|$]]1 million grant from [[Microsoft Research]] to [[Bryn Mawr College]] and the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] and announced in July 2006. IPRE is designing introductory [[computer science]] curricula centered on a [[Personal Robot]]. Their vision is that each student will purchase a small, inexpensive robot at the bookstore which they will use throughout their classes in exploring computer science. The hope is that the robot will cost about as much as a textbook. IPRE will develop the hardware, software, and curricular materials for these courses.

The software being developed for introductory computer science courses is called Myro, short for My Robot, and is based in part on Pyro from [[Python Robotics]]. Myro is an interface to communicate with robots. It is designed to be used through a number of computer languages, include [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], and [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]].

The robot currently being used is the [[Scribbler (robot)|Scribbler]] from [[Parallax, Inc. (company)]] augmented with a small computer board, called the Fluke. The Fluke contains [[Bluetooth]] and a camera. This allows any robot that has a serial interface to be controlled through the low-cost Fluke.

The '''instrumental temperature record''' provides the [[temperature]] of Earth's [[climate|climate system]] from the historical network of [[in situ]] measurements of surface air temperatures and ocean surface temperatures. Data are collected at thousands of meteorological stations, buoys and ships around the globe. The longest-running temperature record is the [[Central England temperature]] data series, which starts in 1659. The longest-running quasi-global record starts in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brohan, P., J.J. Kennedy, I. Harris, S.F.B. Tett, P.D.

== Total warming and trends ==

The global average and combined land and ocean surface temperature, show a warming of 0.85 [0.65 to 1.06] °C, in the period 1880 to 2012, based on multiple independently produced datasets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=IPCC AR5|title=Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis, IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (WGI AR5)|url=[http://www.climatechange2013.org/ WGI AR5]  [http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_ALL_FINAL.pdf Full Report PDF, p.5]|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives a trend of 0.064 ± 0.015&amp;nbsp;°C per decade over that period. The trend is faster for land than ocean, faster for Arctic regions, and faster since the 1970s than the longer period.

=== Warming in the instrumental temperature record ===

Most of the observed warming occurred in two periods: around 1900 to around 1940 and around 1970 onwards;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter02_FINAL.pdf IPCC AR5 Chapter 2 page 193]&lt;/ref&gt; the cooling/plateau from 1940 to 1970 has been mostly attributed to [[Sulfate#Environmental effects|sulphate aerosol]].&lt;ref&gt;

Attribution of the temperature change to natural or anthropogenic (i.e., [[Anthropogenic climate change|human-induced]]) factors is an important question: see [[global warming]] and [[attribution of recent climate change]].

Land air temperatures are rising faster than sea surface temperatures. Over 1979 to 2012 the trend for land was about 0.254 ± 0.050&amp;nbsp;°C per decade per CruTemp4 or 0.273 ± 0.047 per GHCN while the trend for sea surface temperatures is about 0.072 ± 0.024&amp;nbsp;°C per decade per HadISST to 0.124 ± 0.030&amp;nbsp;°C per decade per HadSST3.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter02_FINAL.pdf IPCC AR5 WG1 Chapter 2 page 187 and page 192]&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1979 to 2012, the linear warming trend for combined land and sea temperatures has been 0.155&amp;nbsp;°C [0.122 to 0.188&amp;nbsp;°C] per decade according to AR5.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter02_FINAL.pdf IPCC AR5 WG1 Chapter 2 p193]&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report found that the instrumental temperature record for the past century included urban heat island effects but that these were primarily local, having a negligible influence on global temperature trends (less than 0.006&amp;nbsp;°C per decade over land and zero over the oceans).&lt;ref name="trenberth summary of observations"&gt;

While record-breaking years can attract considerable public interest, individual years are less significant than the overall trend.

==Influences on global temperature==

{{Main article|Global warming|Attribution of recent climate change}}

[[Greenhouse gas]]es trap outgoing radiation warming the atmosphere which in turn warms the land.

[[El Niño]] generally tends to increase global temperatures. [[La Niña]], on the other hand, usually causes years which are cooler than the short-term average.&lt;ref name="NOAA"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/2014/13 | title = NOAA National Climatic Data Center, State of the Climate: Global Analysis for Annual 2014 | accessdate = 2015-01-21 | publisher = [[NOAA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Niño is the warm phase of the [[El Niño Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) and La Niña the cold phase.

[[Aerosols]] diffuse incoming radiation generally cooling the planet. Volcanoes are the largest source but there are also anthropogenic sources. There are several other effects such as clouds. Some aerosols like carbon black have warming effects.

[[Land use]] change like deforestation can increase greenhouse gases through burning [[biomass]]. [[Albedo]] can also be changed.

[[Solar irradiance|Incoming solar radiation]] varies very slightly, with the main variation controlled by the approximately 11-year [[Solar cycle|solar magnetic activity cycle]].

==Absolute temperatures v. anomalies==

Records of global average surface temperature are usually presented as [[:wikt:anomaly|anomalies]] rather than as absolute temperatures. A temperature anomaly is measured against a reference value or long-term average.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if the reference value is 15&amp;nbsp;°C, and the measured temperature is 17&amp;nbsp;°C, then the temperature anomaly is +2&amp;nbsp;°C (i.e., 17&amp;nbsp;°C −15&amp;nbsp;°C).

Temperature anomalies are useful for deriving average surface temperatures because they tend to be highly correlated over large distances (of the order of 1000&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, anomalies are representative of temperature changes over large areas and distances. By comparison, absolute temperatures vary markedly over even short distances.

The Earth's average surface absolute temperature for the 1961–1990 period has been derived by spatial interpolation of average observed near-surface air temperatures from over the land, oceans and sea ice regions, with a best estimate of 14&amp;nbsp;°C (57.2&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name="jonesreview"&gt;
{{cite journal |vauthors=Jones PD, New M, Parker DE, Martin S, Rigor IG |date=1999 |title=Surface air temperature and its changes over the past 150 years |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1029/1999RG900002/abstract |journal=Reviews of Geophysics |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=173–199 |doi=10.1029/1999RG900002 |bibcode=1999RvGeo..37..173J }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The estimate is uncertain, but probably lies within 0.5&amp;nbsp;°C of the true value.&lt;ref name="jonesreview" /&gt; Given the difference in uncertainties between this absolute value and any annual anomaly, it's not valid to add them together to imply a precise absolute value for a specific year.&lt;ref&gt;http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/abs_temp.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global record from 1850 ==

The period for which reasonably reliable instrumental records of near-surface temperature exist with quasi-global coverage is generally considered to begin around 1850. Earlier records exist, but with sparser coverage and less standardized instrumentation.

The temperature data for the record come from measurements from land stations and ships. On land, temperature sensors are kept in a [[Stevenson screen]] or a [[MMTS (meteorology)|maximum minimum temperature system]] (MMTS). The sea record consists of surface ships taking sea temperature measurements from engine inlets or buckets. The land and marine records can be compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/fig2-6.htm | title=Climate Change 2001: Working Group I: The Scientific Basis – Figure 2.6 | publisher=[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] | author=[[John T.

Most meteorological observations are taken for use in weather forecasts. Centers such as [[European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts|ECMWF]] show [http://www.ecmwf.int/products/forecasts/d/overview/monitoring/coverage/dcover!ssmi!00!pop!od!oper!w_coverage!latest!obs/ instantaneous map of their coverage]; or the Hadley Centre show the coverage for the [http://www.meto.gov.uk/research/hadleycentre/CR_data/Annual/HadCRUTanm_2000.gif average of the year 2000]. Coverage for earlier in the 20th and 19th centuries would be significantly less. While temperature changes vary both in size and direction from one location to another, the numbers from different locations are combined to produce an estimate of a global average change.

&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1997–98 El Niño event|El Niño in 1998]] was particularly strong, possibly one of the strongest of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="scott variability p1"/&gt;

Temperature trends from 1901 are positive over most of the world's surface except for Atlantic Ocean south of Greenland, the [[southeastern United States]], and parts of [[Bolivia]]. Warming is strongest over inland areas in Asia and North America as well as south-eastern Brazil and some areas in the South Atlantic and Indian oceans.

Since 1979 temperature increase is considerably stronger over land while cooling has been observed over some oceanic regions in the Pacific Ocean and Southern Hemisphere; the spatial pattern of ocean temperature trend in those regions is possibly related to the [[Pacific Decadal Oscillation]] and [[Antarctic oscillation|Southern Annular Mode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter3.pdf|format=PDF|title=IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, Chapter 3|accessdate=2009-03-14|date=2007-02-05|pages=250–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seasonal temperature trends are positive over most of the globe but weak cooling is observed over the mid latitudes of the southern ocean but also over eastern Canada in spring because of strengthening of the [[North Atlantic Oscillation]]. Warming is stronger over northern Europe, China and North America in winter, Europe and Asia interior in spring, Europe and north Africa in summer and northern North America, Greenland and eastern Asia in autumn.
Enhanced warming over north Eurasia is partly linked to the [[Arctic oscillation|Northern Annular Mode]],&lt;ref name="Polyakov 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Polyakov |first=I.V. |first2=R.V. |last2=Bekryaev |first3=U.S. |last3=Bhatt |first4=R.L. |last4=Colony |first5=A.P. |last5=Maskshtas |first6=D. |last6=Walsh |first7=R.V. |last7=Bekryaev |first8=G.V. |last8=Alekseev |year=2003 |title=Variability and trends of air temperature in the Maritime Arctic |journal=J.

The most recent climate model simulations give a range of results for changes in global-average temperature. Some models show more warming in the troposphere than at the surface, while a slightly smaller number of simulations show the opposite behaviour. There is no fundamental inconsistency among these model results and observations at the global scale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/tmlw0602.pdf Temperature Trends in the Lower Atmosphere – Understanding and Reconciling Differences]&lt;/ref&gt;

The satellite records used to show much smaller warming trends for the troposphere which were considered to disagree with model prediction; however, following revisions to the satellite records, the trends are now similar.

The IPCC fifth assessment report concluded "assessment of the large body of studies comparing various long-term radiosonde and MSU products since AR4 is hampered by data set version changes, and inherent data uncertainties. These factors substantially limit the ability to draw robust and consistent inferences from such studies about the true long-term trends or the value of different data products".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter02_FINAL.pdf IPCC 5AR WG1 Chapter 2 page 196]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
IAML was founded after [[World War II]] to "promote international cooperation and standardization in such matters as [[cataloging]], standards of service, personnel training and the exchange of materials between [[libraries]]."&lt;ref name=Lonn&gt;Anders Lönn, "International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres," The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2nd edition, 2002, vol. 12, p. 491. {{ISBN|0-333-60800-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding of IAML was a three-year process from 1949 to 1951. It was part of the [[United Nations]]' mission to promote world peace. The founding conferences were held in [[Basel]] and [[Florence]] in 1949, in [[Lüneburg]] in 1950, and in [[Paris]] in 1951, the last one conducted by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Music Librarianship in the United Kingdom |editor-first=Richard |editor-last=Turbet |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zoCfMEscyzwC&amp;pg=PA364&amp;dq=International+Association+of+Music+Libraries,+Archives+and+Documentation+Centres&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OCdRUtG6EYjNswa384GYBw&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=International%20Association%20of%20Music%20Libraries%2C%20Archives%20and%20Documentation%20Centres&amp;f=false |date=2003 |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]] |isbn=9780754605720}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Accademia Nazionale [[Luigi Cherubini]] celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1949, an event that brought around 60 music librarians, musicologists, and museum professionals from twelve countries to [[Florence]].&lt;ref name=Geering /&gt; This was the first meeting of music librarians from around the world; plans for a separate organization had been discussed since the founding of the [[International Musicological Society]] in 1927, but the [[Second World War]] prevented anything from taking shape.&lt;ref name="Pleßke"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pleßke|first=Hans-Martin|title=Geschichte und Funktion der Internationalen Vereinigung der Musikbibliotheken (IVMB)|journal=Zentralblatt für Bibliothekswesen|date=1972|volume=86|issue=6|pages=352–359}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war had caused heavy losses at many [[libraries]], and international cooperation was of utmost importance. 

The goals of the Florence conference included updating the status and locations of the musical sources described in {{Interlanguage link multi|Robert Eitner's|de}} ''Biographisch-Bibliographisches Quellen-Lexikon der Musiker und Musikgelehrten der christlichen Zeitrechnung bis zur Mitte des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts'' ([[Leipzig]], 1900–1904), establishing a central office in each country responsible for [[Microform|microfilming]] musical sources from before 1800, and addressing issues related to [[Music librarianship#Cataloging and Classification|music cataloging]].&lt;ref name=Geering /&gt; The first goal was realized in 1952 with the founding of the [[Répertoire International des Sources Musicales]].

In 1952, IAML had 224 members in 20 countries.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Membership grew to about 1,100 members in 39 countries in 1969&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The International Association of Music Libraries |journal=[[Notes (journal)|Notes]] |first=Thor E. |last=Wood |pages=697–699 |volume=25 |issue=4 |date= June 1959 |jstor=896620}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1,850 members in 40 countries in 1991,&lt;ref name=ALA /&gt; with national branches in 26 countries as of 2017.

IAML has professional sections, subject sections, study group, and project groups that focus on particular aspects of music librarianship and documentation. Two professional organizations, [[the International Association of Music Information Centres]] and the [[International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives]] began as IAML groups but later formed their own organizations.&lt;ref name=Lonn /&gt;

==Structure==
The IAML board of directors is made up of the [[president]], past president, [[Secretary (club)|secretary general]], [[treasurer]], and [[vice presidents]].&lt;ref name=Meinhold&gt;{{cite book|last=Meinhold|first=Alexandra|title=World Guide to Library, Archive, and Information Science Associations|date=2010|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|location=Berlin|isbn=9783110226379|pages=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board governs IAML together with a Council (which includes representatives from national branches and professional sections) and the General Assembly.

IAML is affiliated with the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA), the [[International Music Council]], and the IMS.&lt;ref name=Meinhold /&gt;

==Activities==
IAML holds annual conferences and has implemented four main programmes, together known as the "R projects" of [[musicology]]: ''Répertoire international des sources musicales'' (RISM), ''[[Répertoire International de Littérature Musicale|Répertoire international de littérature musicale]]'' (RILM), ''Répertoire international d'iconographie musicale'' (RIdIM) and ''[[Répertoire international de la presse musicale]]'' (RIPM). IAML publishes a journal, ''Fontes Artis Musicae'', with articles on music librarianship and bibliography as well as reports on IAML conferences and on the progress of the "R projects".&lt;ref name=ALA /&gt;

===Annual Conferences===
IAML holds annual meetings in different locations around the world. Occasionally, meetings are held jointly with other professional organizations. After the founding meetings held from 1949-1951, annual meetings commenced in 1954.&lt;ref name=Geering&gt;{{cite journal|last=Geering|first=Mireille|title=Geschichte und Gegenwart der AIBM|journal=Forum Musikbibliothek|date=1991|volume=3|pages=197–212.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17816">'''Landscape urbanism''' is a theory of urban planning arguing that the best way to organize cities is through the design of the city's landscape, rather than the design of its buildings. The phrase 'landscape urbanism' first appeared in the mid 1990s. Since this time, the phrase 'landscape urbanism' has taken on many different uses, but is most often cited as a [[postmodernist]] or [[post-postmodernist]] response to the "failings" of [[New Urbanism]] and the shift away from the comprehensive visions, and demands, for [[modern architecture]] and [[urban planning]].

The phrase 'landscape urbanism' first appeared in the work of Peter Connolly, a Masters of Urban Design student from RMIT Melbourne. In 1994, Connolly used the phrase in the title for his Masters of Urban Design proposal at RMIT Melbourne. Here, he suggested that 'a language of "landscape urbanism" barely exists and needs articulating', and that 'existing urbanisms ... are limited in the exploration of the landscape'. He also used the term 'landscape as urbanism' in his 1994 essay, '101 Ideas About Big Parks'.&lt;ref&gt;Kerb: Journal of Landscape Architecture, no 1, Melbourne: RMIT University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 Tom Turner wrote that &lt;blockquote&gt;The city of the future will be an infinite series of landscapes: psychological and physical, urban and rural, flowing apart and together. They will be mapped and planned for special purposes, with the results recorded in geographical information systems (GIS), which have the power to construct and retrieve innumerable plans, images and other records. [[Christopher Alexander]] was right: a city is not a tree. It is a landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Tom, ''City as landscape'', London E&amp;FN Spon, 1996 p.v&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;From the late 1990s, the phrase 'landscape urbanism' was used by landscape architects in the United States to refer to the re-organisation of declining post-industrial cities, such as Detroit. From the 2000s, it was used in Europe by architects to mean a highly flexible way of integrating large-scale infrastructure, housing and open space. By the late 2000s, the phrase became associated with highly commercialized, multi-phase urban parks, such as [[Olympic Park|Olympic park]] design.

== History ==

The first major event to do with 'landscape urbanism' was the Landscape Urbanism conference sponsored by the Graham Foundation in Chicago in April 1997. Speakers included Charles Waldheim, [[Mohsen Mostafavi]], [[James Corner]] of James Corner/Field Operations, Alex Wall, and Adriaan Geuze of the firm [[West 8]], among others. The formative period of Landscape Urbanism can be traced back to RMIT University and [[University of Pennsylvania]] in the late 1980s, at a time when Peter Connolly, [[Richard Weller]], James Corner, Mohsen Mostafavi, and others were exploring the artificial boundaries of Landscape Architecture, Urban Design and Architecture, searching for better ways to deal with complex urban projects. However, their texts cite and synthesize the ideas of influential modernist methods, programmes and manifestoes that appeared in the early twentieth century. Charles Waldheim, Anu Mathur, Alan Berger, Chris Reed, amongst others, were students at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] during this formative period for Landscape Urbanism. After the Chicago conference, European design schools and North American design institutions formed academic programs and began to formalize a field of Landscape Urbanism studies, including the [[University of Toronto]], [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], Oslo School of Architecture [https://web.archive.org/web/20110607080654/http://www.aho.no/en/AHO/Institutes/Urbanism-and-landscape/], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] [http://web.mit.edu/landscapeurbanism/], Catholic University in Leuven, Belgium [http://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H02Q2AE.htm], the [[University of Illinois]] at Chicago and London's [[Architectural Association]].

The development of an actual operative response to the broad and often vague concepts surrounding landscape urbanism was largely developed at the Architectural Association in London.  Prior to this period of design exploration, landscape urbanism had never been clearly developed as an actual design practice.  Today, much of the design culture that has come to be associated with landscape urbanism was initiated and developed in the AA Landscape Urbanism program during its early formative period and its influence persists in many educational institutions.  A number of practices that have chosen to adopt the design and conceptual approach towards urbanism have also adopted many of these design strategies. 

== Themes ==

James Corner is the author of an essay entitled "Terra Fluxus." He has identified four general ideas that are important for use in Landscape Urbanism. They are as follows:

1 Process over time - Understanding the fluid or changing nature of any environment and the processes that affect change over time. A respect for natural processes (Ecology) - the idea that our lives intertwine with the environment around us, and we should therefore respect this when creating an urban environment.  Landscape Urbanism is concerned with a working surface over time – a type of urbanism that anticipates change, open endedness and negotiation.

2 Horizontality - The use of horizontal alignment in landscaping, rather than relying on vertical structuring.

3 Working Methods /Techniques - Those who practice the idea of landscape urbanism should be able to adapt their techniques to the environment that they are in.

4 The imaginary - That in many ways the failing of twentieth century planning can be attributed to the absolute impoverishment of the imagination to extend new relationships and sets of possibilities
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corner|first1=James|title=Terra Fluxus|journal=Landscape Urbanism Reader|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ten characteristics ==
[[Tom Turner]] summarized the ten characteristics of landscape urbanism in the book ''Landscape design history and theory: landscape architecture and garden design origins''&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Landscape design history &amp; theory: landscape architecture and garden design origins|last=Turner|first=Tom|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

1-Broad scale context: Landscape urbanism does not belong to a specific scale. It can be considered in small or large-scale projects.

2-Landscape is a context which contains architecture and civil engineering.

3-Landscape is seen as a third machinery arm that makes a connection between its components. [[Mohsen Mostafavi]], the author of ''Landscape Urbanism : A Manual for the Machinic Landscape''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Landscape Urbanism: A Manual for the Machinic Landscape|last=Mostafavi|first=Mohsen|last2=Najle|publisher=Ciro|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the same phrase.

4-LU projects can provide the opportunity of increasing the social interactions. Also, Emily Talen, one of the writers of ''Landscape Urbanism and its Discontentes''&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Landscape Urbanism and its Discontents|last=Andres|first=Duany|last2=Talen|first2=Emily|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; talks about social aspects of a LU project ''"by forming three theoretical alliances: one with [[post-structuralism]], one with [[Theoretical ecology|ecology]], and one --peculiarly-- with Marxism."''

5-Function is the most significant concern in LU machine, which gives the appearance of a project less importance.

6-LU discovers the potentials and opportunities in landscapes.

7-The infrastructure are highlighted in LU projects.

8-LU projects will develop the interrelationship between natural and engineered systems.

9-LU will break the boundary between the landscape and the city and will organize them as one.

10-The answer to the projects which are complex or have ecological concentrations, is landscape urbanism

== Projects ==
The following are Landscape Urbanism projects that are available that can provide more information about the theory in practice:

*''[[Schouwburgplein (Rotterdam)|Schouwburgplein, Rotterdam]]'', [[West 8]]/Adriaan Geuze
*Also see projects by ''Stoss''/Chris Reed [http://www.stoss.net/]

== Criticism ==
Landscape urbanism has been criticized as an idea that is only loosely defined from a set of flashy projects. These are expensive schemes with a commercial and esthetic purpose that satisfy a local or regional ambition to invest in ecology or sustainability without posing a more globally applicable approach. A true merger of landscape architecture with the field of Urban Ecology lacks. From this criticism Frederick Steiner introduced landscape ecological urbanism as an approach that can include the field of urban ecology and Wybe Kuitert has shown how such integrative planning and management of the city should rely on analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steiner | first1 = F. R. | year = 2011 | title = Landscape Ecological Urbanism: Origins and Trajectories, ''Landscape and Urban Planning'' 100: 333-337 and Wybe Kuitert (2013)  Urban landscape systems understood by geo-history map overlay | url = | journal = Journal of Landscape Architecture | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 54–63 | doi = 10.1080/18626033.2013.798929 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Discerning the potential quality of wild nature in the city is a first step to see how new urban ecology might be developed. Potential vegetation maps for a city are the tool to this end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuitert | first1 =  | year = 2013 | title = The Nature of Urban Seoul: Potential Vegetation Derived from the Soil Map | url = | journal = International Journal of Urban Sciences | volume = 17 | issue = 1| pages = 95–108 | doi = 10.1080/12265934.2013.766505 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One opponent to Landscape Urbanism is [[New Urbanism]], led by [[Andres Duany]],&lt;ref name="New Urbanism"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bettercities.net/article/street-fight-landscape-urbanism-versus-new-urbanism-14855 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508062902/http://bettercities.net/article/street-fight-landscape-urbanism-versus-new-urbanism-14855 |archivedate=2012-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which promotes walkable communities and smart growth with its Transit Oriented Development (TOD) and Traditional Neighborhood Design (TND). In response to landscape urbanism’s focus on expansive green space in urban development, Duany stated that “density and urbanism are not the same.” Further, “unless there is tremendous density, human beings will not walk.” &lt;ref name="New Urbanism"/&gt; The result is patches of green sprawl that lose connectivity to the greater network.

Emo Urbanism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Soleri|first=Paolo|title=Lean Linear City|year=2012|publisher=Cosanti Press|isbn=978-1-883340-07-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; is another philosophy critical of Landscape Urbanism. The movement contends that Landscape Urbanism views ecology as an aesthetic element of style and not urban ecology. The artificial ecology replaces the entropic state&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehighline.org/galleries/images/high-line-1999-2006 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503233057/http://www.thehighline.org/galleries/images/high-line-1999-2006 |archivedate=2013-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to re-create a landscape that fits a particular brand or aesthetic. The loss is a dynamic, adaptive, and certainly essential urban system. Emo urbanism differs by making evolving "nature" a key component of the design process. The realization of this process is called “Urbanature" and "Big Nature." As an evolving urban ecology, [[Charles Morris Anderson]] has described this connection as the “thinness.” It is the simultaneous perception and implicit understanding of the past, present, and future. Emo Urbanist projects include the built work of Charles Anderson at the Olympic Sculpture Park&lt;ref&gt;http://www.werk.us/portfolio/olympic-sculpture-park/{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asla.org/awards/2007/07winners/267_wmct.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbuildingsdirectory.com/project.cfm?id%3D801 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217034444/http://www.worldbuildingsdirectory.com/project.cfm?id=801 |archivedate=2014-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Seattle, WA; The Anchorage Museum Common&lt;ref&gt;http://www.werk.us/portfolio/anchorage-museum/&lt;/ref&gt; in Anchorage, AK; the yet to be constructed Project Phoenix&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://project-phoenix.org/ourmission |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517035417/http://project-phoenix.org/ourmission |archivedate=2013-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Haiti and Hellinikon's Metropolitan Park&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.werk.us/portfolio/hellinikon-metropolitan-park/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304102409/http://www.werk.us/portfolio/hellinikon-metropolitan-park/ |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Athens, Greece.

Ian Thompson has published a critical review of landscape urbanism in which he identifies its ten tenets and asks six critical questions. His conclusions are: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;... there are ideas with the Landscape Urbanism discourse which have great merit, among which I would include the breaking down of professional distinctions, the integration of ecological thinking, the foregrounding of infrastructure, the interest in the positive use of waste materials and the emphasis upon functionality rather than mere appearance. There is also a quantity of dubious philosophy, unhelpful imagery and obscurantist language that Landscape Urbanism ought to dump. ... Larding the case for Landscape Urbanim with Deleuzian and Derridean references was a mistake, since it was done principally to impress an academic elite, and it has even left large sections of its intended audience bemused'.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Thompson (2012) Ten Tenets and Six Questions for Landscape

Any [[worm]] that lives in a [[ocean|marine]] [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] is considered a '''marine worm'''.  Marine worms are found in several different [[phylum (biology)|phyla]], including the [[Platyhelminthes]], [[Nematoda]], [[Annelida]] (segmented worms), [[Chaetognatha]], [[Hemichordata]], and [[Phoronida]]. For a list of marine animals that have been called "sea worms", see [[Sea worm (disambiguation)|sea worm]].

Many of these worms have specialized tentacles used for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide and also may be used for reproduction.

Some marine worms are [[tube worm (body plan)|tube worm]]s, of which the [[giant tube worm]] lives in waters near underwater [[volcanoes]], and can withstand temperatures up to 90 degrees [[Celsius]] or about 194 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Some worms can live in the trench. These worms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/10/1028_021028_TVtubeworm.html|title=Giant Tubeworms Probed for Clues to Survival|website=news.nationalgeographic.com|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; were first discovered in the Pacific Ocean off the [[Galápagos Islands]].

In recent years, marine worms (especially those found in the ocean) have been observed ingesting microplastic particles found in the oceans. This trend is concerning many scientists, as marine worms act as an important food source for many fish and wading birds. Marine Worms play as [[Keystone Species]] in an ecosystem, and the introduction of plastic in the oceans will not only diminish the growth rates of the marine worms, but also affect the food chain of that ecosystem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15669">The '''Ridge College of Intelligence Studies and Applied Sciences at Mercyhurst University (RIAP)''', located on the campus of [[Mercyhurst University]] in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], offers undergraduate and graduate studies programs in intelligence analysis. The program also offers graduate certificates in Applied Intelligence, Counterintelligence and Law Enforcement Intelligence. The Intelligence Studies program "promotes the study of Intelligence in higher academic settings, while seeking to identify, promote, and employ best practices in the study and application of intelligence studies throughout its various disciplines (national security, law enforcement, business intelligence and academia)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mciis.org/about.php Mercyhurst College Institute for Intelligence Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Institute for Intelligence Studies (IIS) was founded in February 2004, thanks to a grant from the [[U.S. Department of Education]]'s Fund for the Improvement of Post-Secondary Education (FIPSE). For a dozen years before the opening of the institute, then Mercyhurst College offered an undergraduate degree in intelligence studies as part of its ground-breaking Research/Intelligence Analyst Program (RIAP, or R/iap). Nestled within Mercyhurst College's Department of History, RIAP was the first non-governmental initiative of its kind in the U.S. The program began in 1992 with only 14 students, but the competence of graduates eventually attracted the attention of the U.S. Intelligence Community.&lt;ref name=WQLN/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heibel&gt;Heibel, Robert J., ''Catalyst and Enabler'', "Liberal Studies At Georgetown", Vol. 3 No. 2 pp 13-15 [http://liberalstudies.georgetown.edu/MagazineFiles/LSPmag-V3-2-2005.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The intense public debate in the U.S. following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, focused on U.S. intelligence analysts and their need for training, which directed attention to Mercyhurst's already-growing program. RIAP's success at the undergraduate level led to the offering of a graduate program by 2004.&lt;ref name=WQLN/&gt; The Federal Bureau of Investigation instituted a sabbatical program in 2005, through which senior analysts began to attend IIS-MU for advanced training.&lt;ref&gt;Statement of Robert S. Mueller, III, Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Before the Senate Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, April 5, 2006 [https://www.fbi.gov/congress/congress06/mueller040506.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Statement of Robert S. Mueller, III, Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on Science, State, Justice, Commerce, and Related Agencies, March 28, 2006 [https://www.fbi.gov/congress/congress06/mueller032806.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, no other school in the United States offered a degree designed specifically for intelligence analysts.&lt;ref name=WQLN&gt;Breckenridge, James, radio interview about IIS-MU on "We Question and Learn", a public interest show on FM 91.3 WQLN in Erie, Pennsylvania on 2 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Administration ==
[[Robert J. Heibel]], a retired FBI agent, founded the undergraduate program in 1992 and is now Executive Director of IIS-MU.&lt;ref name=WQLN/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heibel/&gt;

Duncan E. McGill, Ph.D., a retired US Army Lieutenant Colonel and former associate dean of the National Intelligence University, is the dean of the Ridge College.&lt;ref name=catalog&gt;[https://www.mercyhurst.edu/ridge-college-intelligence-studies-and-applied-sciences/intelligence-studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Undergraduate Program in Intelligence Studies ==
The Bachelor of Arts in Intelligence Studies is a four-year interdisciplinary baccalaureate program which prepares a graduate to become an entry-level analyst for the government or the [[private sector]]. The undergraduate program, which continues to be referred to as RIAP, consists of nine core intelligence-related courses, plus 13 interdisciplinary courses.&lt;ref name=catalog/&gt;

As of 2014, there are approximately 300 students enrolled in the undergraduate program. This includes students from across the United States as well as international students. The students primarily come from the Ohio-Pennsylvania-NY area.&lt;ref name="intel.mercyhurst.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://intel.mercyhurst.edu/content/staff_history |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610054244/http://intel.mercyhurst.edu/content/staff_history |archivedate=2010-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Certificate in Intelligence Studies ==
IIS-MU has developed a distance-learning graduate-level certificate program for use by contracting organizations in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. As of 2009, there are approximately 77 certificate students in the program.&lt;ref name="intel.mercyhurst.edu"/&gt;

== Graduate Program in Applied Intelligence ==
The Masters of Science in Applied Intelligence is a thirty-four or thirty-six-credit two-year program designed to prepare graduates to pursue analyst careers in law enforcement, [[national security]] and [[competitive intelligence]]. As of 2009, there are approximately 53 graduate students in the Applied Intelligence program.&lt;ref name="intel.mercyhurst.edu"/&gt;

The graduate program's Strategic Intelligence class participated in a joint research project with the [[National Intelligence Council]] in 2006-2007 entitled ''The Global Disease Threat and Its Implications for the United States''. The project involved the development of a [http://nie.wikispaces.com/The+INSIGHT+Project Mercyhurst wiki] consisting of over 1,000 pages of analysis on the threat of global disease to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Mercyhurst College Wiki on Global Disease, National Intelligence Council {{cite web |url=http://www.dni.gov/nic/research_globaldisease.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927221952/http://www.dni.gov/nic/research_globaldisease.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''NIC Sponsors Wiki on Global Disease'', Government Computer News (GCN), 31 May 2007 {{cite web |url=http://www.gcn.com/online/vol1_no1/44391-1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604172650/http://www.gcn.com/online/vol1_no1/44391-1.html |archivedate=2007-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, Assistant Professor Stephen Marrin presented two papers at international conferences. The first paper, entitled "Reconceptualizing the Relationship Between CIA's Analysis and Decisionmaking: The Case of Pre-9/11 Terrorism Intelligence" was presented at a conference in Dublin, Ireland on [https://web.archive.org/web/20081021053204/http://www.ucdclinton.ie/events_conferences_2009_ciaandusforeignpolicy.htm The CIA &amp; US Foreign Policy: Reform, Representations and New Approaches to Intelligence]. The second, entitled "The Intelligence-Policy Interface and Iraq in Britain and the United States" was given at a workshop on Intelligence, Policy and Comparative Politics in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://intel.mercyhurst.edu/professor_marrin_presents_two_papers "Professor Marrin presents two papers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610051529/http://intel.mercyhurst.edu/professor_marrin_presents_two_papers |date=2010-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students in a class led by Assistant Professor Kristan Wheaton earned certificates of appreciation from coalition forces and the Iraqis for a 1,000-page WIKI-based analysis product they completed for intelligence authorities in Baghdad. The project, which examined Middle Eastern governments in the region and their reaction to events unfolding in Iraq, was provided to authorities in Iraq by another intelligence studies faculty member, U.S. Army Maj. Daniel Mulligan, who returned to Mercyhurst in early February after a year's tour of duty in Iraq. Mulligan presented the certificates on Monday, February 16, 2009 at the intelligence studies building on campus.&lt;ref&gt;"Intel project earns kudos" {{cite web |url=http://intel.mercyhurst.edu/intel_project_earns_kudos |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610052557/http://intel.mercyhurst.edu/intel_project_earns_kudos |archivedate=2010-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six IIS-MU students won the first-ever ODNI-sponsored [http://www.dniopensource.org/Default.aspx 2008 Open Source Challenge] which gave the students one week to thoroughly research, document and convincingly answer the question: "Is Al Qaeda a cohesive organization with strong and centralized control, intent and direction?"  The team's answer surpassed those of more than 20 other competitors, some veterans of the U.S. intelligence community. Another team shared the first prize with Mercyhurst after it answered the second question option in the contest. That team, from iJET Intelligent Risk Systems, had two members who graduated from IIS-MU's graduate program.&lt;ref&gt;"Mercyhurst Intelligence team presents findings during ODNI Conference in Washington D.C." {{cite web |url=http://intel.mercyhurst.edu/content/09192008 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610093800/http://intel.mercyhurst.edu/content/09192008 |archivedate=2010-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Motion-capture acting''', also called '''performance-capture acting''', sometimes abbreviated as '''MoCap''' or '''Pcap''', is a type of [[acting]] in which an actor wears markers or sensors on a skintight bodysuit&lt;ref&gt; NY Castings, Joe Gatt, [http://www.nycastings.com/dmxreadyv2/blogmanager/v3_blogmanager.asp?post=motioncaptureactors Motion Capture Actors: Body Movement Tells the Story] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703113656/http://www.nycastings.com/dmxreadyv2/blogmanager/v3_blogmanager.asp?post=motioncaptureactors |date=2014-07-03 }}, Accessed June 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; or directly on the skin.&lt;ref name=twsWired&gt; Hugh Hart, January 24, 2012, Wired magazine, [https://www.wired.com/2012/01/andy-serkis-oscars/ When will a motion capture actor win an Oscar?], Accessed June 21, 2014, "...the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ historic reluctance to honor motion-capture performances ....."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twsCalgaryHerald&gt; January 25, 2012, Calgary Herald, [http://blogs.calgaryherald.com/2012/01/25/no-oscar-nod-for-andy-serkis-master-of-stop-motion-acting/ No Oscar nod for Andy Serkis: master of motion-capture acting], Accessed June 21, 2014, "..Serkis has carved out a niche for himself as master of motion-capture roles..."&lt;/ref&gt; Several cameras from different angles record the actor's movements simultaneously, recording the three-dimensional position of the sensors and not recording the rest of the actor. Sampling is done many times each second, aided by advances in computer technology. The resulting database of 3-D points permits a filmmaker or video game creator to create a digital character and to place this character in an entirely new setting, such as on top of a fictional volcano or flying through the air. This type of acting is seen as a growth area, with predictions that there will be more work in future for actors.&lt;ref name="twsBackstage"&gt;Andrew Harris Salomon, Feb. 22, 2013, Backstage Magazine, [http://www.backstage.com/news/spotlight/growth-performance-capture-helping-gaming-actors-weather-slump/ Growth In Performance Capture Helping Gaming Actors Weather Slump], Accessed June 21, 2014, "..motion-capture technology ... indicate that this niche continues to be a growth area for actors...."&lt;/ref&gt; Some theatrical agents represent motion-capture actors.&lt;ref name="twsBackstage" /&gt;

Motion-capture acting can be difficult work. For example, one actor was "placed in a tiny booth, had dots placed all over his face that captured his movements, and had to sit perfectly still".&lt;ref name=twsBackstage/&gt; One report suggested that actors wishing to break into this line of work should go to acting class and become experts in skills such as gunplay, sword fighting, dance, general body movement, running and jumping, gymnastics, and hand-to-hand fighting.&lt;ref name=twsBackstage/&gt; It is a new type of acting work. Numerous sources identify actor [[Andy Serkis]] as the "king of motion-capture acting" based on his work in creating digital characters in movies such as ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' and ''[[Planet of the Apes]]''.&lt;ref name=twsToday&gt; Gael Fashingbauer Cooper, TODAY, May 26, 2014, [http://www.today.com/entertainment/7-summer-movies-you-shouldnt-miss-2D79591396 7 summer movies you shouldn't miss], Accessed June 21, 2014, "....Andy Serkis, the king of motion-capture acting..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twsLATimes&gt;Gina McIntyre, June 04, 2014, Los Angeles Times, [http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/star-wars-josh-trank-set-to-direct-standalone-film/#/0 ‘Star Wars’: Josh Trank set to direct standalone film], Accessed June 21, 2014, "..Irish actor Domhnall Gleeson, performance capture expert Andy Serkis ..."&lt;/ref&gt; According to one report, the first use of performance capture acting for a video game was for the 2007 game ''[[Heavenly Sword]]'' which starred Serkis and others.&lt;ref name="CBC News"&gt; [http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/performance-capture-injects-emotion-into-virtual-worlds-1.1104828 Performance capture injects emotion into virtual worlds: Using actors' movements, expressions to animate digital characters in games, film allows audiences to relate], March 7, 2011, Blaine Kyllo, "...Heavenly Sword (2007), which starred Serkis and Anna Torv (Fringe ), was the first video game in which performance capture was used..."&lt;/ref&gt; Serkis said:

{{Quote|Performance-capture technology is really the only way that we could bring these characters to life. It's the way that Gollum was brought to life, and King Kong, and the Na'vi in Avatar and so on and it's really another way of capturing an actor's performance. That's all it is, digital make-up.|[[Andy Serkis]], 2011&lt;ref name=twsGuardian&gt; Ben Child, 12 August 2011, The Guardian, [https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/aug/12/andy-serkis-motion-capture-acting Andy Serkis: why won't Oscars go ape over motion-capture acting? Star of Rise of the Planet of the Apes says performance capture is misunderstood and its actors deserve more respect], Accessed June 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There have been battles within the film industry about earning recognition for motion-capture actors. The Alliance of Motion Picture &amp; Television Producers does not consider motion-capture acting as the same type of work as acting, which means that motion-capture actors are often paid less.&lt;ref name=twsVariety/&gt; The [[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG) has lobbied the industry for better employment terms and conditions for motion-capture actors, and argued that motion-capture work should be included in standard labor contracts.&lt;ref name=twsVariety&gt; Dave McNary, December 17, 2011, Variety magazine, [https://variety.com/2011/digital/news/motion-capture-tests-acting-boundaries-1118047652/ Motion-capture tests acting boundaries], Accessed June 21, 2014, "..The Screen Actors Guild ... are the characters in these films ... performing as genuine actors or something else?..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Dave McNary, December 17, 2011, Variety magazine, [https://variety.com/2011/digital/news/motion-capture-tests-acting-boundaries-1118047652/ Motion-capture tests acting boundaries], Accessed June 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The industry in 2012 did not give awards for motion-capture acting.&lt;ref name=twsHollywood&gt; KELSEA STAHLER, DEC 07, 2012, Hollywood.com, [http://www.hollywood.com/news/movies/45718147/andy-serkis-at-the-hobbit-premiere-gollum-motion-capture-acting-is-just-acting?page=all Andy Serkis at ‘The Hobbit’ Premiere: Gollum Motion Capture Acting Is ‘Just Acting’], Accessed June 21, 2014, "..Some film experts have had trouble categorizing the master motion capture actor, The Hobbit star Andy Serkis, ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4411">A '''narrative hook''' (or just '''hook''') is a [[literary technique]] in the opening of a story that "hooks" the reader's attention so that he or she will keep on reading. The "opening" may consist of several paragraphs for a short story, or several pages for a novel, but ideally it is the [[opening sentence]] in the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Examples ==
One of the most common forms is dramatic action, which engages the reader into wondering what the consequences of the action will be.{{Example needed}}  This particular form has been recommended from the earliest days, stemming from [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Aristotle]].{{Example needed}}

The use of action as the hook, and the advice to so use it, is so widespread as to sometimes lead to the use of the term to mean an action opening, but other things can be used for narrative hooks, such mysterious settings, or engaging characters, or even a thematic statement, as with [[Jane Austen]]'s opening line, "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife." (''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'')

When a story does not lend itself to a good hook when it is laid out linearly, the writer may tell the story out of order to engage the reader's interest.  The story may begin with a dramatic moment and, once the reader is curious, [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] to the history necessary to understand it.  Or it may be told as a [[story-within-a-story]], with the narrator in the [[frame story]] telling the story to answer the curiosity of his listeners, or by warning them that the story began in an ordinary seeming way, but they must follow it to understand latter actions. A famous early example of this technique was used in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', also known as the ''Arabian Nights'', in which the frame story consists of [[Sheherazade]] telling stories to King [[List of One Thousand and One Nights characters#Shahryar|Shahriyar]]; she must keep him 'hooked' to each of the stories, in order to prevent him from executing her the next morning.

=== ''In medias res'' ===
''[[In medias res]]'' is where the relating of a story begins at the midpoint, rather than at the beginning.&lt;ref name="Clifford2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clifford|first=Tim|title=The Middle School Writing Toolkit: Differentiated Instruction Across the Content Areas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ofntq_pjaocC&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=29 July 2013|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Maupin House Publishing, Inc.|isbn=978-0-929895-75-8|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of story telling might be used as a narrative hook. Narrative hooks often play an important role in [[Thriller (genre)|suspense thrillers]] and [[mystery fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Treat, America | year = 1982 | title = Mystery Writer's Handbook | publisher = Writer's Digest Books | page = 111 | isbn= 0898790808}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of both these occurrences is ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', in which a tale, "[[The Three Apples]]," begins with the discovery of a young woman's dead body, thus keeping the reader interested in "[[whodunit]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=86–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=240–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer''''' ('''''NICER''''') is a [[NASA]] [[Explorers program]] Mission of Opportunity dedicated to the study of the extraordinary gravitational, electromagnetic, and nuclear physics environments embodied by [[neutron star]]s, exploring the exotic states of matter where density and pressure are higher than in [[atomic nuclei]]. ''NICER'' will enable rotation-resolved [[spectroscopy]] of the thermal and non-thermal emissions of neutron stars in the soft (0.2–12 [[keV]]) X-ray band with unprecedented sensitivity, probing interior structure, the origins of dynamic phenomena, and the mechanisms that underlie the most powerful cosmic particle accelerators known.&lt;ref name="nicerPdf1"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/nicer/papers/NICER-SPIE-July2012-v4.pdf |title=The Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER): an Explorer mission of opportunity for soft x-ray timing spectroscopy |journal=Proceedings of the SPIE: Space Telescopes and Instrumentation 2012, Ultraviolet to Gamma Ray |first1=Keith C. |last1=Gendreau |first2=Zaven |last2=Arzoumanian |first3=Takashi |last3=Okajima |volume=8443 |date=September 2012 |doi=10.1117/12.926396 |bibcode=2012SPIE.8443E..13G}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''NICER'' will achieve these goals by deploying, following launch, an [[X-ray]] timing and spectroscopy instrument as an attached payload aboard the [[International Space Station]] (ISS).  ''NICER'' was selected by NASA to proceed to formulation phase in April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2013/apr/HQ_13-088_Astro_Explorer_Mission_.html |title=NASA Selects Explorer Investigations for Formulation |publisher=NASA |first=J.

==Launch==
By May 2015, ''NICER'' was on track for a 2016 launch, having passed its [[critical design review]] and resolved an issue with the power being supplied by the ISS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/nasa-s-multi-purpose-nicer-sextant-mission-on-track-for-2016-launch |title=NASA's Multi-Purpose NICER/SEXTANT Mission on Track for 2016 Launch |publisher=NASA |first=Lori |last=Keesey |date=12 May 2015 |accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[CRS-7]] loss in June 2015, which delayed future missions by several months, ''NICER'' was finally launched on 3 June 2017,&lt;ref name="sfnow20170603" /&gt; with the [[SpaceX CRS-11]] ISS resupply mission aboard a [[Falcon 9 Full Thrust|Falcon 9 v1.2]] rocket.&lt;ref name="nasa-nicer-manifest"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/nicer/news/nicer_whatsnew.html |title=NICER Manifested on SpaceX-11 ISS Resupply Flight |series=NICER News |publisher=NASA |date=1 December 2015 |accessdate=14 June 2017 |quote=Previously scheduled for a December 2016 launch on SpaceX-12, NICER will now fly to the International Space Station with two other payloads on SpaceX Commercial Resupply Services (CRS)-11, in the Dragon vehicle's unpressurized Trunk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science instrument==
''NICER''{{'s}} primary science instrument, called the X-ray Timing Instrument (XTI), is an array of 56 X-ray photon detectors. These detectors record the energies of the collected photons as well as with their time of arrival. A [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receiver enables accurate timing and positioning measurements.

During each ISS orbit, ''NICER'' will observe two to four targets. Gimbaling and a [[star tracker]] allow ''NICER'' to track specific targets while collecting science data. In order to achieve its science objectives, ''NICER'' will take over 15 million seconds of exposures over an 18-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/nicer-factsheet-final.pdf |title=NICER: Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer |series=NASAFacts |publisher=NASA |accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==X-ray navigation and communication experiments==
An enhancement to the ''NICER'' mission, the ''[[Station Explorer for X-ray Timing and Navigation Technology]]'' (''SEXTANT''), will act as a technology demonstrator for [[X-ray pulsar-based navigation]] (XNAV) techniques that may one day be used for deep-space navigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20150001327.pdf |title=SEXTANT - Station Explorer for X-ray Timing and Navigation Technology |conference=AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Control Conference. 5–9 January 2015.

As part of ''NICER'' testing, a rapid-modulation X-ray device was developed called Modulated X-ray Source (MXS), which is being used to create an X-ray communication system (XCOM) demonstration. If approved and installed on the ISS, XCOM will transmit data encoded into X-ray bursts to the ''NICER'' platform, which may lead to the development of technologies that allow for gigabit bandwidth communication throughout the Solar System.&lt;ref name="nasa20161104"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/nasa-s-navcube-could-support-an-x-ray-communications-demonstration-in-space-a-nasa-first |title=NASA’s NavCube Could Support an X-ray Communications Demonstration in Space — A NASA First |publisher=NASA |first=Lori |last=Keesey |date=4 November 2016 |accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[electrical engineering]], '''noise margin''' is the amount by which a [[signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] exceeds the minimum amount for proper operation.  It is commonly used in at least two contexts:
*In [[communications system engineering]], noise margin is the ratio by which the signal exceeds the minimum acceptable amount.  It is normally measured in [[decibel]]s.
*In a [[digital circuit]], the noise margin is the amount by which the signal exceeds the threshold for a proper '0' or '1'.  For example, a digital circuit might be designed to swing between 0.0 and 1.2 [[volt]]s, with anything below 0.2 volts considered a '0', and anything above 1.0 volts considered a '1'.  Then the noise margin for a '0' would be the amount that a signal is below 0.2 volts, and the noise margin for a '1' would be the amount by which a signal exceeds 1.0 volt.  In this case noise margins are measured as an absolute voltage, not a ratio. Noise margins for CMOS chips are usually much greater than those for TTL because the V&lt;sub&gt;OH min&lt;/sub&gt; is closer to the power supply voltage and V&lt;sub&gt;OL max&lt;/sub&gt; is closer to zero.
**Real digital inverters do not instantaneously switch from a logic high (1) to a logic low (0), there is some capacitance. While an inverter is transitioning from a logic high to low, there is an undefined region where the voltage is cannot be considered high or low. This is considered a noise margin. There are two noise margins to consider: Noise margin high (N&lt;sub&gt;MH&lt;/sub&gt;) and noise margin low (N&lt;sub&gt;ML&lt;/sub&gt;). N&lt;sub&gt;MH&lt;/sub&gt; is the amount of voltage between an inverter transitioning from a logic high (1) to a logic low (0) and vice versa for N&lt;sub&gt;ML&lt;/sub&gt;. The equations are as follows: N&lt;sub&gt;MH&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ V&lt;sub&gt;OH&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;IH&lt;/sub&gt;  and N&lt;sub&gt;ML&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ V&lt;sub&gt;IL&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;OL&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/6.012/www/SP07-L11.pdf|title=MIT PowerPoint|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, in a CMOS inverter V&lt;sub&gt;OH&lt;/sub&gt; is considered to be will equal V&lt;sub&gt;DD&lt;/sub&gt; and  V&lt;sub&gt;OL&lt;/sub&gt; will equal Ground, as mentioned above. 
***V&lt;sub&gt;IH&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ highest input voltage where slope = -1. The slope is tangent to the line on the V&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; vs V&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; inverter graph. The slope of -1 is found where the line is concaving upwards while the inverter is transitioning from a logic 0 to a logic 1. V&lt;sub&gt;IL&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ lowest input voltage where slope = -1 The slope is, again, tangent to the line and found where the line is concaving downwards while the inverter is transitioning from a logic 1 to a logic 0. To refresh, when a inverter takes a high voltage, for example, V&lt;sub&gt;DD&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.2 V, it reverts the input and gives out a logic low (0) and vice versa.

In simple words, Noise margin (in circuits) is the amount of noise that a circuit can withstand.
Noise margins are generally defined so that positive values ensure proper operation, and negative margins result in compromised operation, or perhaps outright failure.

[[File:EH POG-2.jpg|thumb|right|170px|POG octave effect]]
'''Pitch shifting''' is a [[sound recording]] technique in which the original [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] of a sound is raised or lowered. [[Effects unit]]s that raise or lower pitch by a pre-designated [[interval (music)|musical interval]] ([[transposition (music)|transposition]]) are called "pitch shifters" or "pitch benders".

==Pitch/time shifting==
The simplest methods are used to increase pitch and reduce durations, or ''vice versa'', reduce pitch and increase duration. This can be done by replaying a sound waveform at a different speed than it was recorded. It could be accomplished on an early [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape recorder]] by changing the diameter of the [[capstan (tape recorder)|capstan]] drive shaft, or using a different motor. As technologies improved later designs of motor speeds could be controlled by electronic [[servo drive|servo]] system circuits. This arrangement using “[[vari-speed]]” [[capstan (tape recorder)|capstan]] motors allowed the speed change to be achieved more simply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artsites.ucsc.edu/EMS/music/equipment/analog_recorders/analog_recorders.html|title=Analog Tape Recorders|publisher=UCSC Electronic music studios 1996|accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for vinyl records, the same thing can be done;
placing a finger on the turnable to give friction will retard it, while giving it a 'spin' can advance it.

==Pitch shifter and harmonizer==
{{redirect|Harmonizer|3=Harmonizers (disambiguation)}}
A '''pitch shifter''' is a sound [[effects unit]] that raises or lowers the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of an [[audio signal]] by a preset [[interval (music)|interval]]. For example, a pitch shifter set to increase the pitch by a fourth will raise each note three [[diatonic]] intervals above the notes actually played. Simple pitch shifters raise or lower the pitch by one or two [[octave]]s, while more sophisticated devices offer a range of interval alterations. Pitch shifters are included in most [[audio processor]]s today.

A '''harmonizer''' is a type of pitch shifter that combines the "shifted" pitch with the original pitch to create a two or more note harmony.

In digital recording, pitch shifting is accomplished through digital [[signal processing]]. Older digital processors could often only shift pitch in [[post-production]], whereas many modern devices using computer processing technology can change pitch values virtually in real time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/aug02/articles/tcvoiceone.asp|title=Voice Modelling Processor|publisher=Sound on Sound 2002|accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pitch correction]] is a form of pitch shifting and is found in software such as [[Auto-Tune]] to correct intonation inaccuracies in a recording or performance. Pitch shifting may raise or lower all sounds in a recording by the same amount, whereas in practice, pitch correction may make different changes from note to note.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://emusician.com/tutorials/making-tracks-pitch-doctor/|title=Making Tracks: Pitch Doctor|publisher=Penton Media - date undisclosed|accessdate=17 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805084757/http://emusician.com/tutorials/making-tracks-pitch-doctor/|archivedate=5 August 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable uses==
Numerous cartoons have used pitch shifters to produce distinctive animal voices. [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]] recordings with David Seville (aka [[Ross Bagdasarian, Sr.|Ross Bagdasarian]]) were created by recording vocal tracks at slow speeds, then playing them back at normal speeds. [[Voice artist]] [[Mel Blanc]] used pitch shifting techniques to create the voices of [[Tweety]] and [[Daffy Duck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://toolooney.goldenagecartoons.com/daffy.htm|title=What makes Daffy Duck?|publisher=Top looney golden age cartoons - date undisclosed|accessdate=17 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608212719/http://toolooney.goldenagecartoons.com/daffy.htm|archivedate=8 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One notable early practitioner of pitch shifting in music is [[Chuck Berry]], who used the technique to make his voice sound younger. Many of the [[Beatles]]' records from 1966 and 1967 were made by recording instrumental tracks a half-step higher and the vocals correspondingly low. Examples include "[[Rain (The Beatles song)|Rain]]", "[[I'm Only Sleeping]]", and "[[When I'm Sixty-Four]]".

Electronic musician [[Burial (musician)|Burial]] is known for including pitch-shifted samples of vocal melodies in his songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jenkins |first=Pete |title=Dubstep Basics: An Introduction To Dubstep Production |work=Sound On Sound |date=July 2010 |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jul10/articles/dubstep.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Goregrind]] and occasionally [[death metal]] use vocals that are often pitch-shifted to sound unnaturally low and guttural.

The famous bass intro to the song "[[Seven Nation Army]]" by [[The White Stripes]], is the result of guitarist [[Jack White]] playing a 6 string guitar through a pitch shifting effects pedal set to an octave below. The band was a duo, who lacked a bassist and had never previously used one in any of their music, choosing instead to mimic the sound of a bass guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=Daniel |title=20 Things You Might Not Know About ‘Seven Nation Army’|work=[[NME]] |date=13 May 2013 |url=http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/20-things-you-might-not-know-about-seven-nation-army-769531|accessdate = 19 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the single "[[Diane Young]]" by [[Vampire Weekend]], the lead singer [[Ezra Koenig]] makes use of a pitch shifter in the chorus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15185">The '''Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements''' are a set of conditions sufficient for a computer architecture to support system [[Full virtualization|virtualization]] efficiently. They were introduced by [[Gerald J. Popek]] and [[Robert P. Goldberg]] in their 1974 article "Formal Requirements for Virtualizable Third Generation Architectures".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Popek | first1 = G. J. | authorlink1 = Gerald J. Popek| last2 = Goldberg | first2 = R. P.| doi = 10.1145/361011.361073| title = Formal requirements for virtualizable third generation architectures| journal = [[Communications of the ACM]]| volume = 17| issue = 7| pages = 412–421| date=July 1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the requirements are derived under simplifying assumptions, they still represent a convenient way of determining whether a computer architecture supports efficient virtualization and provide guidelines for the design of virtualized computer architectures.

== VMM definition ==
System [[virtual machines]] are capable of virtualizing a full set of hardware resources, including a processor (or processors), memory and storage resources and peripheral devices. 
A [[virtual machine monitor]] (VMM, also called [[hypervisor]]) is the piece of software that provides the abstraction of a virtual machine. There are three properties of interest when analyzing the environment created by a VMM:&lt;ref&gt;Rogier Dittner, David Rule, ''The best damn server virtualization book period'', Syngress, 2007, {{ISBN|1-59749-217-5}}, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

; Equivalence / Fidelity : A program running under the VMM should exhibit a behavior essentially identical to that demonstrated when running on an equivalent machine directly.
; Resource control / Safety : The VMM must be in complete control of the virtualized resources.
; Efficiency / Performance: A statistically dominant fraction of machine instructions must be executed without VMM intervention.

In the terminology of Popek and Goldberg, a VMM must present all three properties. In the terminology used in the reference book of Smith and Nair (2005), VMMs are typically assumed to satisfy the equivalence and resource control properties, and those additionally meeting the performance property are called ''efficient VMMs''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Nair, p. 387&lt;/ref&gt;

Popek and Goldberg describe the characteristics that the [[instruction set architecture]] (ISA) of the physical machine must possess in order to run VMMs which possess the above properties.
Their analysis derives such characteristics using a model of "third generation architectures" (e.g., IBM 360, Honeywell 6000, DEC PDP-10) that is nevertheless general enough to be extended to modern machines. This model includes a processor that operates in either system or user mode, and has access to linear, uniformly addressable memory. It is assumed that a subset of the instruction set is available only when in system mode and that memory is addressed relative to a relocation register. I/O and interrupts are not modelled.

== Virtualization theorems ==
To derive their virtualization theorems, which give sufficient (but not necessary) conditions for virtualization, Popek and Goldberg introduce a classification of instructions of an ISA into 3 different groups:

; Privileged instructions : Those that [[Trap (computing)|trap]] if the processor is in [[user mode]] and do not trap if it is in system mode ([[supervisor mode]]). 
; Control sensitive instructions : Those that attempt to change the configuration of resources in the system.
; Behavior sensitive instructions : Those whose behavior or result depends on the configuration of resources (the content of the relocation register or the processor's mode).

The main result of Popek and Goldberg's analysis can then be expressed as follows.

'''Theorem 1'''. For any conventional [[third-generation computer]], an ''effective'' VMM may be constructed if the set of sensitive instructions for that computer is a subset of the set of privileged instructions.

Intuitively, the theorem states that to build a VMM it is sufficient that all instructions that could affect the correct functioning of the VMM (sensitive instructions) always trap and pass control to the VMM. This guarantees the resource control property. Non-privileged instructions must instead be executed natively (i.e., efficiently). The holding of the equivalence property also follows.

This theorem also provides a simple technique for implementing a VMM, called ''trap-and-emulate virtualization'', more recently called ''classic virtualization'': because all sensitive instructions behave nicely, all the VMM has to do is trap and emulate every one of them.&lt;ref name=asplos23&gt;Adams and Agesen, 2006, pp. 2-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smith391/&gt;

A related problem is that of deriving sufficient conditions for recursive virtualization, that is, the conditions under which a VMM that can run on a copy of itself can be built. Popek and Goldberg present the following (sufficient) conditions.

'''Theorem 2'''. A conventional [[third-generation computer]] is recursively virtualizable if:

# it is virtualizable and
# a VMM without any timing dependencies can be constructed for it.

Some architectures, like the non-hardware-assisted [[x86]], do not meet these conditions, so they cannot be virtualized in the classic way. But architectures can still be fully virtualized (in the x86 case meaning at the CPU and MMU level) by using different techniques like binary translation, which replaces the sensitive instructions that do not generate traps,&lt;ref name=asplos23/&gt; which are sometimes called critical instructions. This additional processing however makes the VMM less efficient in theory,&lt;ref name=smith391&gt;Smith and Nair, p. 391&lt;/ref&gt; but hardware traps have non-negligible performance cost as well.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} A well-tuned caching binary translation system may achieve comparable performance, and it does in the case of x86 binary translation relative to first generation x86 hardware assist, which merely made sensitive instructions trappable.&lt;ref&gt;Adams and Agesen, p. 1 and 5&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively this gives a theorem with different sufficiency conditions.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

'''Theorem 3'''. A ''hybrid'' VMM may be constructed for any third generation machine in which the set of user sensitive instructions are a subset of the set of privileged instructions:

== Handling critical instructions ==
{{Unreferenced section|date= February 2015}}

The conditions for ISA virtualization expressed in Theorem 1 may be relaxed at the expense of the efficiency property.  VMMs for non-virtualizable ISAs (in the Popek and Goldberg's sense) have routinely been built.

The virtualization of such architectures requires correct handling of ''critical instructions'', i.e., sensitive but unprivileged instructions. One approach, known as ''patching'', adopts techniques commonly used in [[dynamic recompilation]]: critical instructions are discovered at run-time and replaced with a trap into the VMM. Various mechanisms, such as the caching of emulation code or [[hardware-assisted virtualization|hardware assists]], have been proposed to make the patching process more efficient. A different approach is that of [[paravirtualization]], which requires guest operating systems to be modified (''ported'') before running in the virtual environment.

== Instruction sets of common architectures ==
This section presents some relevant architectures and how they relate to the virtualization requirements.

=== PDP-10 ===
The [[PDP-10]] architecture has a few instructions which are sensitive (alter or query the processor's mode) but not privileged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | author=S. W. Galley | title=PDP-10 Virtual machines | booktitle=Proc. ACM SIGARCH-SIGOPS Workshop on Virtual Computer Systems | year=1969 | pages=30–34 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  These instructions save or restore the condition codes containing USER or IOT bits:

* JSR: jump to subroutine
* JSP: jump and save program counter
* PUSHJ: push down and jump
* JRST: jump and restore

=== System/370 ===
All sensitive instructions in the [[System/370]] are privileged: it satisfies the virtualization requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Nair, p. 395&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Motorola MC68000 ===
The [[Motorola 68000|Motorola MC68000]] has a single unprivileged sensitive instruction:

* MOVE from SR

This instruction is sensitive because it allows access to the entire status register, which includes not only the [[Status register|condition codes]] but also the user/supervisor bit, interrupt level, and trace control.  In most later family members, starting with the [[Motorola 68010|MC68010]], the MOVE from SR instruction was made privileged, and a new MOVE from CCR instruction was provided to allow access to the condition code register only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = M68000 8-/16-32-Bit Microprocessor User's Manual, Ninth Edition | publisher = Motorola, Inc. | location = Phoenix, AZ, USA | year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Motorola M68000 Family Programmer's Reference Manual | publisher = Motorola, Inc. | location = Phoenix, AZ, USA | year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IA-32 (x86) ===&lt;!-----------[[Intel 80386]] links here--------------&gt;
{{Main|X86 virtualization}}

The [[IA-32]] instruction set of the [[Intel P5 (microarchitecture)|Pentium]] processor contains 18 sensitive, unprivileged instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | author=John Scott Robin and Cynthia E. Irvine | title=Analysis of the Intel Pentium's Ability to Support a Secure Virtual Machine Monitor | booktitle=Proc. 9th USENIX Security Symposium | year=2000 | url=http://www.usenix.org/events/sec2000/robin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be categorized in two groups:

* Sensitive register instructions: read or change sensitive registers or memory locations such as a clock register or interrupt registers:
** SGDT, SIDT, SLDT
** SMSW
** PUSHF, POPF
*Protection system instructions: reference the storage protection system, memory or address relocation system:
** LAR, LSL, VERR, VERW
** POP
** PUSH
** CALL FAR, JMP FAR, INT n, RETF
** STR
** MOV (segment registers)

The introduction of the [[AMD-V]] and [[Intel VT-x]] instruction sets in 2005 allows x86 processors to meet the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements.

=== IA-64 ===
The effort needed to support virtualization on the [[IA-64]] architecture is described in a 2000 article by Magenheimer and Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Daniel J. Magenheimer and Thomas W. Christian|year=2000|title=vBlades: Optimized Paravirtualization for the Itanium Processor Family|url=http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/vm04/tech/magenheimer.html|booktitle=Proc. 3rd Virtual Machine Research &amp; Technology Symposium|publisher=USENIX|pages=73&amp;ndash;82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SPARC ===
A "hyperprivileged" mode for the [[UltraSPARC]] architecture was specified in ''UltraSPARC Architecture 2005''.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = UltraSPARC Architecture 2005: One Architecture....

=== PowerPC ===
All sensitive instructions in the [[PowerPC]] instruction set are privileged.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pagetable.com/?p=15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~410-s07/lectures/L38_Virtualization.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performance in practice ==
The efficiency requirement in Popek and Goldberg's definition of a VMM concerns only the execution of non-privileged instructions, which must execute natively. This is what distinguishes a VMM from the more general class of hardware [[Emulator|emulation]] software. Unfortunately, even on an architecture that meets Popek and Goldberg's requirements, the performance of a virtual machine can differ significantly from the actual hardware. Early experiments performed on the System/370 (which meets the formal requirements of Theorem 1) showed that performance of a virtual machine could be as low as 21% of the native machine in some benchmarks. The cost of trapping and emulating privileged instructions in the VMM can be significant. This led the IBM engineers to introduce a number of [[hardware-assisted virtualization|hardware assists]], which roughly doubled the performance of the System/370 virtual machines.&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Nair, p. 415-416 and 426&lt;/ref&gt; Assists were added in several stages. In the end, there were over 100 assists on the late models System/370.&lt;ref&gt;Gum, p. 535&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main driving factors for the development of hardware assists for the System/370 was virtual memory itself. When the guest was an operating system that itself implemented virtual memory, even non-privileged instructions could experience longer execution times - a penalty imposed by the requirement to access translation tables not used in native execution (see [[shadow page tables]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gum, p. 533&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Post-tech''', (or post-technology, post-digital-technology) is type of technology that is more concerned about being human than about technology. It advocates a design that is not merely focused on efficiency and exploiting users by increasing their time spent with digital devices and technology itself but to support the user's focus and intent, well-being, and independence (from technology).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title =ON/OFF: Risks and Rewards of the Anytime-Anywhere Internet|url = https://www.amazon.de/OFF-Risks-Rewards-Anytime-Anywhere-Internet/dp/3728137995|publisher = vdf Hochschulvlg|date =3 January 2017|isbn = 3728137995|language = English|first = Sarah|last = Genner}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this interstitial spaces could also be created, similar to what Michel Foucault describes as [[Heterotopia (space)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ZEITmagazin International, No 2, Fall-Winter 2015 (printed), German version online available|url=http://www.zeit.de/zeit-magazin/2015/29/smartphone-seymour-projects-menthal-leben-offline|author=Jürgen von Rutenberg|publisher=ZEITmagazin International|accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4904">A '''Post canonical system''', as created by [[Emil Post]], is a string-manipulation system that starts with finitely-many strings and repeatedly transforms them by applying a finite set j of specified rules of a certain form, thus generating a [[formal language]]. Today they are mainly of historical relevance because every Post canonical system can be reduced to a [[string rewriting system]] (semi-Thue system), which is a simpler formulation. Both formalisms are [[Turing complete]].

== Definition ==

A '''Post canonical system''' is a triplet ('''A''','''I''','''R'''), where

* '''A''' is a finite alphabet, and finite (possibly empty) strings on '''A''' are called ''words''.
* '''I''' is a finite set of ''initial words''.
* '''R''' is a finite set of string-transforming rules (called ''production rules''), each rule being of the following form:

:&lt;math&gt;
\overset{
\begin{matrix}
       g_{10} &amp; \$_{11} &amp; g_{11} &amp; \$_{12} &amp; g_{12} &amp;  \dots &amp; \$_{1m_1} &amp; g_{1m_1} \\
       g_{20} &amp; \$_{21} &amp; g_{21} &amp; \$_{22} &amp; g_{22} &amp;  \dots &amp; \$_{2m_2} &amp; g_{2m_2} \\
       \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots   &amp; \vdots  \\
       g_{k0} &amp; \$_{k1} &amp; g_{k1} &amp; \$_{k2} &amp; g_{k2} &amp;  \dots &amp; \$_{km_k} &amp; g_{km_k} \\
\end{matrix}
}
{
\underset{
\begin{matrix}
                   h_0 &amp; \$'_1 &amp; h_1 &amp; \$'_2 &amp; h_2 &amp; \dots &amp; \$'_n &amp; h_n \\
\end{matrix}
}
{
                                      \downarrow
}
}
&lt;/math&gt;

where each {{mvar|g}} and {{mvar|h}} is a specified &lt;u&gt;fixed&lt;/u&gt; word, and each ''$'' and ''$' '' is a &lt;u&gt;variable&lt;/u&gt; standing for an arbitrary word.  The strings before and after the arrow in a production rule are called the rule's ''antecedents'' and ''consequent'', respectively. It is required that each ''$' '' in the consequent be one of the ''$''s in the antecedents of that rule, and that each antecedent and consequent contain at least one variable.

In many contexts, each production rule has only one antecedent, thus taking the simpler form

: &lt;math&gt;g_0 \ \$_1 \ g_1 \ \$_2 \ g_2 \ \dots \ \$_m \ g_m \ \rightarrow \ h_0 \ \$'_1 \ h_1 \ \$'_2 \ h_2 \ \dots \ \$'_n \ h_n &lt;/math&gt;

The [[formal language]] generated by a Post canonical system is the set whose elements are the initial words together with all words obtainable from them by repeated application of the production rules. Such sets are [[recursively enumerable]] languages and every recursively enumerable language is the restriction of some such set to a sub-alphabet of '''A'''.

=== Example (well-formed bracket expressions) ===

 Alphabet: {[, ]}
 Initial word: []
 Production rules: 
 (1)       ''$'' &amp;rarr; [''$'']
 (2)       ''$'' &amp;rarr; ''$$''
 (3)       ''$''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''$''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; ''$''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;[]''$''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
 
 Derivation of a few words in the language of well-formed bracket expressions:
 
        []             initial word
        [][]           by (2)
        [[][]]         by (1)
        [[][]][[][]]   by (2)
        [[][]][][[][]] by (3)
        ...

==Normal-form theorem==
A Post canonical system is said to be in ''normal form'' if it has only one initial word and every production rule is of the simple form

: &lt;math&gt; g\$ \ \rightarrow \ \$h &lt;/math&gt;

Post 1943 proved the remarkable '''Normal-form Theorem''', which applies to the most-general type of Post canonical system:  
:Given any Post canonical system on an alphabet '''A''', a Post canonical system in ''normal form'' can be constructed from it, possibly enlarging the alphabet, such that the set of words involving only letters of '''A''' that are generated by the normal-form system is exactly the set of words generated by the original system.

[[Tag system]]s, which comprise a universal computational model, are notable examples of Post normal-form system, being also ''monogenic''.  (A canonical system is said to be ''monogenic'' if, given any string, at most one new string can be produced from it in one step &amp;mdash; i.e., the system is deterministic.)

==String rewriting systems, Type-0 formal grammars==
A [[string rewriting system]] is a special type of Post canonical system with a single initial word, and the productions are each of the form

: &lt;math&gt; P_1 g P_2  \ \rightarrow \ P_1  h P_2 &lt;/math&gt;

That is, each production rule is a simple substitution rule, often written in the form ''g'' &amp;rarr; ''h''.  It has been proved that any Post canonical system is reducible to such a ''substitution system'', which, as a [[formal grammar]], is also called a ''phrase-structure grammar'', or a ''type-0 grammar'' in the [[Chomsky hierarchy]].

{{Performing arts}}
'''Public speaking''' (also called '''oratory''' or '''oration''') is the process or act of performing a good [[Speech communication|speech]] to a live [[audience]]. This type of speech is deliberately structured with three general purposes: to inform, to persuade and to entertain. Public speaking is commonly understood as formal, face-to-face speaking of a single person to a group of listeners.&lt;ref&gt;''General Purposes of Speaking''. 2012books.lardbucket.org. Retrieved 2016-11-04.{{ISBN needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public speaking can be governed by different rules and structures. For example, speeches about concepts do not necessarily have to be structured in any special way. However, there is a method behind giving it effectively. For this type of speech it would be good to describe that concept with examples that can relate to the audiences life. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Speaker The Tradition and practice of public speaking|last=Valenzano III|first=Joseph M.|last2=Braden|first2=Stephen W.|publisher=Fountainhead press|year=2012|isbn=978-1-59871-522-4|location=United States of America|pages=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
There are five basic elements of public speaking that are described in [[Lasswell's model of communication]]: the communicator, message, medium, audience and effect. In short, the speaker should be answering the question "''who'' says ''what'' in which ''channel'' to ''whom'' with what ''effect''?"

Public speaking can serve the purpose of transmitting information, telling a story, motivating people to act or some combination of those. Public speaking can also take the form of a [[discourse community]], in which the audience and speaker use discourse to achieve a common goal.

Public speaking for business and commercial events is often done by professionals. These speakers can be contracted independently, through representation by a [[speakers bureau]], or by other means. Public speaking plays a large role in the professional world; in fact, it is believed that 70 percent of all jobs involve some form of public speaking.&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, Lisa.

However, the most significant records are found among the ancient Greeks.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first known piece&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, James J.  [https://www.britannica.com/biography/Demosthenes-Greek-statesman-and-orator "Demosthenes – greatest Greek orator".] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; on oratory, written over 2,000 years ago, came from ancient Greece. This work elaborated on principles drawn from the practices and experiences of ancient Greek orators. [[Aristotle]] was one of the first recorded teachers of oratory to use definitive rules and models. His emphasis on oratory led to oration becoming an essential part of a [[liberal arts]] education during the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. The [[classical antiquity]] works written by the ancient Greeks capture the ways they taught and developed the art of public speaking thousands of years ago.

In classical [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], [[rhetoric]] was the main component of [[Composition studies|composition]] and speech delivery, both of which were critical skills for citizens to use in public and private life. In ancient Greece, citizens spoke on their own behalf rather than having professionals, like modern lawyers, speak for them. Any [[citizen]] who wished to succeed in court, in politics or in social life had to learn techniques of public speaking. Rhetorical tools were first taught by a group of rhetoric teachers called [[Sophists]] who are notable for teaching paying students how to speak effectively using the methods they developed.

Separately from the Sophists, [[Socrates]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] all developed their own theories of public speaking and taught these principles to students who wanted to learn skills in rhetoric. Plato and Aristotle taught these principles in schools that they founded, [[Platonic Academy|The Academy]] and [[Aristotles Lyceum|The Lyceum]], respectively. Although Greece eventually lost political sovereignty, the Greek culture of training in public speaking was adopted almost identically by the Romans.

In the political rise of the [[Roman Republic]], Roman orators copied and modified the ancient Greek techniques of public speaking. Instruction in rhetoric developed into a full curriculum, including instruction in grammar (study of the poets), preliminary exercises ([[progymnasmata]]), and preparation of public speeches (declamation) in both [[Forensic linguistics|forensic]] and [[Deliberative rhetoric|deliberative]] genres.

The Latin style of rhetoric was heavily influenced by [[Cicero]] and involved a strong emphasis on a broad education in all areas of [[Humanities|humanistic study]] in the liberal arts, including philosophy. Other areas of study included the use of wit and humor, the [[Pathos|appeal to the listener's emotions]], and the use of [[digression]]s. Oratory in the [[Roman empire]], though less central to political life than in the days of the Republic, remained significant in law and became a big form of entertainment. Famous orators became like celebrities in ancient Rome—very wealthy and prominent members of society.

The Latin style was the primary form of oration until the beginning of the 20th century. After [[World War II]], however, the Latin style of oration began to gradually grow out of style as the trend of ornate speaking became seen as impractical. This cultural change likely had to do with the rise of the [[scientific method]] and the emphasis on a "plain" style of speaking and writing. Even formal oratory is much less ornate today than it was in the Classical Era.

Despite the shift in style, the best-known examples of strong public speaking are still studied ''years'' after their delivery. Among these examples are [[Pericles' Funeral Oration]] in 427 BCE addressing those that died during the [[Peloponnesian War]]; Abraham Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]] in 1863; Sojourner Truth's identification of racial issues in "[[Ain't I a Woman?]]”; and Mahatma Gandhi's message of nonviolent resistance in India, which in turn inspired Martin Luther King, Jr.'s "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech at the Washington Monument in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;German, Kathleen M. (2010). ''Principles of Public Speaking''. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon. p. 6. {{ISBN|978-0-205-65396-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tools ==
In addition to simple oratory skills, tools and technologies have been created which allow for more methods of communication for speakers and public orators. [[Lectern]]s hold papers while speakers talk. A speaker can project his or her voice with the aid of a [[public address system]] or a [[microphone]] and [[loudspeaker]] when speaking in front of a large audience. Public speakers may also use [[audience response systems]], allowing listeners to interact with the speech as it happens.

Telecommunication and [[videoconferencing]] are also a form of public speaking. David M. Fetterman of [[Stanford University]] wrote in his 1997 article ''Videoconferencing over the Internet'': "Videoconferencing technology allows geographically disparate parties to hear and see each other usually through satellite or telephone [[communication]] systems." This technology is helpful for large conference meetings and face-to-face communication between parties without demanding the inconvenience of travel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3635">The '''SAT Subject Test in Physics''', '''Physics SAT II''', or simply the '''Physics SAT''', is a one-hour [[multiple choice]] [[Standardized test|test]] on [[physics]] administered by [[The College Board]] in the United States. A high school student generally chooses to take the test to fulfill [[college]] entrance requirements for the schools at which the student is planning to apply. Until 1994, the [[SAT Subject Tests]] were known as '''Achievement Tests'''; until January 2005, they were known as '''SAT IIs'''; they are still well known by this name.

The material tested on the Physics SAT is supposed to be equivalent to that taught in a junior- or senior-level high school physics class. It requires critical thinking and test-taking strategies, at which high school freshmen or sophomores may be inexperienced. The Physics SAT tests more than what normal state requirements are; therefore, many students prepare for the Physics SAT using a [[prep book|preparatory book]] or by taking an [[AP course]] in [[Physics]].

==Format==

The SAT Subject Test in Physics has 75 questions and consists of two parts: Part A and Part B.

'''Part A:''' 
*  First 12 or 13 questions
*  4 groups of two to four questions each
*  The questions within any one group all relate to a single situation.
*  Five possible answer choices are given before the question.
*  An answer choice can be used once, more than once, or not at all in each group.

'''Part B:'''
*  Last 62 or 63 questions
*  Each question has five possible answer choice with one correct answer.
*  Some questions may be in groups of two or three.

==Scoring==

The test has 75 multiple choice questions that are to be answered in one hour. All questions have five answer choices. Students receive 1 point for every correct answer, lose ¼ of a point for each incorrect answer, and receive 0 points for questions left blank. This score is then converted to a scaled score of 200–800. The mean score for the 2006–07 test administrations was 643 with a [[standard deviation]] of 107. Sample percentile ranks for the 2008&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://professionals.collegeboard.com/profdownload/sat_subject_tests_percentile_ranks_2008.pdf SAT Subject Tests Percentile Ranks]&lt;/ref&gt; administrations are available from the College Board.

==Preparation==
The College Board's recommended preparation is a one-year college preparatory course in physics, a one-year course in [[algebra]] and [[trigonometry]], and experience in the laboratory.

==Resources==
Students taking the SAT Subject Test in Physics are prohibited from using any resources during the test, including textbooks, notes, or formula sheets. Although there are mathematics questions including trigonometry, the use of a calculator is not allowed. All scratch work must be done directly in the test booklet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3501">In [[recursion theory]] a subset of the natural numbers is called a '''simple set''' if it is co-infinite and [[recursively enumerable]], but every infinite subset of its complement fails to be enumerated recursively.  Simple sets are examples of recursively enumerable sets that are not [[computable set|recursive]].

== Relation to Post's problem ==
Simple sets were devised by [[Emil Leon Post]] in the search for a non-Turing-complete recursively enumerable set.  Whether such sets exist is known as [[Post's problem]].  Post had to prove two things in order to obtain his result, one is that the simple set, say ''A'', does not Turing-reduce to the empty set, and that the ''K'', the [[halting problem]], does not Turing-reduce to ''A''.  He succeeded in the first part (which is obvious by definition), but for the other part, he managed only to prove a [[many-one reduction]].

It was affirmed by Friedberg and Muchnik in the 1950s using a novel technique called the [[priority method]].  They give a construction for a set that is simple (and thus non-recursive), but fails to compute the halting problem.&lt;ref name=Nies35&gt;Nies (2009) p.35&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal definitions and some properties ==
*A set &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is called '''immune''' if &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is infinite, but for every index &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;W_e \text{ infinite} \implies W_e \not\subseteq I&lt;/math&gt;.  Or equivalently: there is no infinite subset of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; that is recursively enumerable.
*A set &lt;math&gt;S \subseteq \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is called ''' simple ''' if it is recursively enumerable and its complement is immune.
*A set &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is called '''effectively immune''' if &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is infinite, but there exists a recursive function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; such that for every index &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, we have that &lt;math&gt; W_e \subseteq I \implies \#(W_e) &lt; f(e)&lt;/math&gt;. 
*A set &lt;math&gt;S \subseteq \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is called '''effectively simple''' if it is recursively enumerable and its complement is effectively immune.  Every effectively simple set, is simple and Turing-complete.
*A set &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is called '''hyperimmune''' if &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is infinite, but &lt;math&gt;p_I&lt;/math&gt; is not computably dominated, where &lt;math&gt;p_I&lt;/math&gt; is the list of members of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; in order.&lt;ref name=Nies27&gt;Nies (2009) p.27&lt;/ref&gt;
*A set &lt;math&gt;S \subseteq \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is called '''hypersimple''' if it is simple and its complement is hyperimmune.&lt;ref name=Nies37&gt;Nies (2009) p.37&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18228">'''Social geography''' is the branch of [[human geography]] that is most closely related to [[social theory]] in general and [[sociology]] in particular, dealing with the relation of [[social phenomenon|social phenomena]] and its spatial components. Though the term itself has a tradition of more than 100 years,&lt;ref name="term"&gt;Dunbar, Gary S. (1977): Some Early Occurrences of the Term "Social Geography". ''Scottish Geographical Journal'' 93 (1): 15-20.&lt;/ref&gt; there is no consensus on its explicit content.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan J. Smith|Smith, Susan J.]] et al. (2010): Introduction: Situating Social Geographies. In: Smith, Susan J. et al. (eds.): The Sage Handbook of Social Geographies. London (Sage): 1-39 [5-7].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, noted that "[w]ith some notable exceptions, (...) social geography can be considered a field created and cultivated by a number of individual scholars rather than an academic tradition built up within particular schools".&lt;ref&gt;[[Anne Buttimer|Buttimer, Anne]] (1968): Social geography. In: Sills, David (ed.): International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. New York (MacMillan): 134-145 [134].&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, despite some calls&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Jackson (geographer)|Peter Jackson]] (1983): Social geography: Convergence and Compromise. ''Progress in Human Geography'' 7 (1): 116-121.&lt;/ref&gt; for convergence centred on the [[structure and agency]] debate,&lt;ref&gt;[[Derek Gregory|Gregory, Derek]] (1981): Human Agency and Human Geography. ''Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers'' 6 (1): 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; its methodological, theoretical and topical diversity has spread even more, leading to numerours definitions of social geography&lt;ref&gt;[[John D. Eyles|Eyles, John]] (1986): Introduction: Diffusion and Convergence? In: Eyles, John (ed.): Social Geography in International perspective. Barnes &amp; Noble: 1-12 [4-5].&lt;/ref&gt; and, therefore, contemporary scholars of the discipline identifying a great variety of different ''social geographies''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Susan J. et al. (2010): 3.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as [[Benno Werlen]] remarked,&lt;ref&gt;[[Benno Werlen|Werlen, Benno]] (2008): Sozialgeographie: Eine Einführung (3. ed.). Bern et al. (Haupt). [11] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; these different perceptions are nothing else than different answers to the same two (sets of) questions, which refer to the spatial constitution of society on the one hand, and to the spatial expression of social processes on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Peter (1987): The Idea of 'Race' and the Geography of Racism. In: Jackson, Peter (ed.): Race and Racism: Essays in Social geography. London (Allen &amp; Unwin): 3-18 [14].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The outline of these questions is basically of dialectical purpose, and, in its original context, wasn't used as a subject's definition. (Cf. Jackson, Peter (2003): Introduction: The Social in Question. In: Anderson, Kay et al. (eds.) (2003): Handbook of Cultural Geography. London et al. (Sage): 37-42.) Also note that Werlen's original two questions that social geography has to answer slightly differ from these two, and that Buttimer (1968: 135) provides another two of such questions.&lt;/ref&gt;

The different conceptions of social geography have also been overlapping with other sub-fields of geography and, to a lesser extent, sociology. When the term emerged within the Anglo-American tradition during the 1960s, it was basically applied as a synonym for the search for patterns in the distribution of [[social group]]s, thus being closely connected to [[urban geography]] and [[urban sociology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ron J. Johnston|Johnston, Ron]] (1987): Theory and Methodology in Social Geography. In: Pacione, Michael (ed.): Social Geography: Progress and Prospect. London (Croom Helm): 1-30 [3-4].&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, the focus of debate within American human geography lay on [[Political economy|political economic]] processes (though there also was a considerable number of accounts&lt;ref&gt;[[David Ley|Ley, David]] (1977): Social Geography and the Taken-for-granted-World. ''Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers'' 2 (4): 498-512.&lt;/ref&gt; for a [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] perspective on social geography),&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Peter (1981): Phenomenology and Social Geography. ''Area'' 13 (4): 299-305.&lt;/ref&gt; while in the 1990s, geographical thought was heavily influenced by the "[[cultural turn]]". Both times, as [[Neil Smith (geographer)|Neil Smith]] noted, these approaches "claimed authority over the 'social'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Neil Smith (geographer)|Smith, Neil]] (2000): Socializing Culture, Radicalizing the Social. ''Social &amp; Cultural Geography'' 1 (1): 25-28 [25].&lt;/ref&gt; In the American tradition, the concept of [[cultural geography]] has a much more distinguished history than social geography, and encompasses research areas that would be conceptualized as "social" elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Del Casino Jr., Vincent J. and [[Sallie A. Marston]] (2006): Social Geography in the United States: Everywhere and Nowhere. ''Social &amp; Cultural Geography'' 7 (6): 995-1006 [995-996].&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, within some continental European traditions, social geography was and still is considered an approach to human geography rather than a sub-discipline,&lt;ref&gt;for the German-language geography, see [[Dietrich Bartels|Bartels, Dietrich]] and Thomas K.

== History ==

=== Before the Second World War ===
The term "social geography" (or rather "géographie sociale") originates from France, where it was used both by geographer [[Élisée Reclus]] and by sociologists of the [[Pierre Guillaume Frédéric le Play|Le Play]] School, perhaps independently from each other. In fact, the first proven occurrence of the term derives from a review of Reclus' ''Nouvelle géographie universelle'' from 1884, written by [[Paul de Rousiers]], a member of the Le Play School. Reclus himself used the expression in several letters, the first one dating from 1895, and in his last work ''L'Homme et la terre'' from 1905. The first person to employ the term as part of a publication's title was [[Edmond Demolins]], another member of the Le Play School, whose article ''Géographie sociale de la France'' was published in 1896 and 1897. After the death of Reclus as well as the main proponents of Le Play's ideas, and with [[Émile Durkheim]] turning away from his early concept of [[social morphology]],&lt;ref name="term" /&gt; [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]], who noted that geography "is a science of places and not a science of men",&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Vidal de la Blache|Vidal de la Blache, Paul]] (1913): Des caractères distinctifs de la géographie. ''[[Annales de Géographie]]'' 22: 289-299 [297]. {{fr icon}} Cited by: [[Paul Claval|Claval, Paul]] (1986): Social Geography in France. In: Eyles, John (ed.): Social Geography in International perspective. Totowa (Barnes &amp; Noble): 13-29 [13-14].&lt;/ref&gt; remained the most influential figure of French geography. One of his students, [[Camille Vallaux]], wrote the two-volume book ''Géographie sociale'', published in 1908 and 1911.&lt;ref name="term" /&gt; [[Jean Brunhes]], one of Vidal's most influential disciples, included a level of (spatial) interactions among groups into his fourfold structure of human geography.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Brunhes|Brunhes, Jean]] (1924): Human Geography. London (G.G. Harrap &amp; Co.). [36-46] (Originally published in French in 1910) Cited by: Buttimer, Anne (1968): 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Until the Second World War, no more theoretical framework for social geography was developed, though, leading to a concentration on rather descriptive rural and [[regional geography]].&lt;ref&gt;Buttimer, Anne (1968): 137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hérin, Robert (1984): Social Geography in France - Heritages and Perspectives. ''GeoJournal'' 9 (3): 231-240 [231].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;As Paul Claval (1986) puts it: "At mid-century, French geography was more open to social problems than other schools, but there is nothing like a recognised social geographical field." (p. 15)&lt;/ref&gt; However, Vidal's works were influential for the historical [[Annales School]],&lt;ref&gt;Werlen, Benno (2008): 57.&lt;/ref&gt; who also shared the rural bias with the contemporary geographers,&lt;ref&gt;Claval, Paul (1986): 14.&lt;/ref&gt; and Durkheim's concept of social morphology was later developed and set in connection with social geography by sociologists [[Marcel Mauss]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcel Mauss|Mauss, Marcel]] (1927): Divisions et proportions des divisions de la sociologie. ''L'Année Sociologique'', Nouvelle Série 2: 98-173 [112]. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maurice Halbwachs]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomale, Eckhard (1972): 136-138.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first person in the Anglo-American tradition to use the term "social geography" was George Wilson Hoke, whose paper ''The Study of Social Geography''&lt;ref&gt;Hoke, G. W. (1907): The Study of Social Geography. ''The Geographical Journal'' 29 (1): 64-67.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1907, yet there is no indication it had any academic impact. Le Play's work, however, was taken up in Britain by [[Patrick Geddes]] and [[Andrew John Herbertson]].&lt;ref name="term" /&gt; Percy M. Roxby, a former student of Herbertson, in 1930 identified social geography as one of human geography's four main branches.&lt;ref&gt;Roxby, P. M. (1930): The Scope and Aims of Human Geography. ''Scottish Geographical Journal'' 46 (5): 276-290 [283].&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the American academic geography of that time was dominated by the Berkeley School of Cultural Geography led by [[Carl O. Sauer]], while the spatial distribution of social groups was already studied by the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School of Sociology]].&lt;ref&gt;Del Casino Jr., Vincent J. and Sallie A. Marston (2006): 997, 999-1000.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harlan H. Barrows]], a geographer at the University of Chicago, nevertheless regarded social geography as one of the three major divisions of geography.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harlan H. Barrows|Barrows, H. H.]] (1923): Geography as Human Ecology. ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'' 13 (1): 1-14 [7].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another pre-war concept that combined elements of sociology and geography was the one established by Dutch sociologist [[Sebald Rudolf Steinmetz]] and his Amsterdam School of [[Sociography]]. However, it lacked a definitive subject, being a combination of geography and [[ethnography]] created as the more concrete counterpart to the rather theoretical sociology. In contrast, the Utrecht School of Social geography, which emerged in the early 1930s, sought to study the relationship between social groups and their [[living space]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Thomale, Eckhard (1972): 108-110, 177-178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ernste, Huib and Lothar Smith (2009): Dutch Human Geography. In: Kitchin, Rob and Nigel Thrift (eds.): [[International Encyclopedia of Human Geography]]. Oxford (Elsevier): 255-265 [256].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-War Period ===

==== Continental Europe ====
In the German-language geography, this focus on the connection between social groups and the [[landscape]] was further developed by [[Hans Bobek]] and [[Wolfgang Hartke]] after the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;Hajdu, Joseph J. (1968): Toward a Definition of Post-War German Social Geography. ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'' 58 (2): 397-410.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Though the term "Sozialgeographie" had been used before, the first call for a systematic consideration of social groups within German-language geography came from Richard Busch-Zantner (1937): Zur Ordnung der anthropogenen Faktoren. ''Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen'' 83: 138-141 [139]. {{de icon}} (Cited by: Werlen, Benno (2008): 75-76.). However, he died in the Second World War.&lt;/ref&gt; For Bobek, groups of ''Lebensformen'' (patterns of life)—influenced by social factors—that formed the landscape, were at the center of his social geographical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Bobek, Hans (1948): Stellung und Bedeutung der Sozialgeographie. ''[[Erdkunde]]'' 2: 118-125 [122]. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar approach, Hartke considered the landscape a source for indices or traces of certain social groups' behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Hartke|Hartke, Wolfgang]] (1959): Gedanken über die Bestimmung von Räumen gleichen sozialgeographischen Verhaltens. ''Erdkunde'' 13 (4): 426-436 [427]. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known example of this perspective was the concept of ''Sozialbrache'' (social-fallow),&lt;ref&gt;Hartke, Wolfgang (1956): Die Sozialbrache als Phänomen der geographischen Differenzierung der Landschaft. ''Erdkunde'' 10 (4): 257-269. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. the abandoning of tillage as an indicator for occupational shifts away from agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Thomale, Eckhard (1984): Social Geographical Research in Germany - a Balance Sheet for the Years 1950-1980. ''GeoJournal'' 9 (3): 223-230 [228].&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the French ''Géographie Sociale'' had been a great influence especially on Hartke's ideas,&lt;ref&gt;Hajdu (1968): 400&lt;/ref&gt; no such distinct school of thought formed within the French human geography.&lt;ref&gt;Hérin (1984): 231.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claval (1986): 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, [[Albert Demangeon]] paved the way for a number of more systematic conceptualizations of the field with his (posthumously published) notion&lt;ref&gt;Demangeon, A. (1942): Problèmes de géographie humaine. Paris (Armand Colin). [28]&lt;/ref&gt; that social groups ought to be within the center of human geographical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Werlen (2008): 60.&lt;/ref&gt; That task was carried out by [[Pierre George]] and [[Maximilien Sorre]], among others. Then a Marxist,&lt;ref&gt;Hérin (1984): 232.&lt;/ref&gt; George's stance was dominated by a socio-economic rationale,&lt;ref&gt;Buttimer (1968): 137.&lt;/ref&gt; but without the [[Structural marxism|structuralist interpretations]] found in the works of some the French sociologists of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Claval (1986): 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was another French Marxist, the sociologist [[Henri Lefebvre]], who introduced the concept of the (social) production of space.&lt;ref&gt;Claval, Paul (1984): The Concept of Social Space and the Nature of Social Geography. ''New Zealand Geographer'' 40 (2): 105-109 [105-106].&lt;/ref&gt; He had written on that and related topics since the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Peet|Peet, Richard]] (1998): Modern Geographical Thought. Oxford, Malden (Blackwell). [100-102]&lt;/ref&gt; but fully expounded it in ''La Production de L'Espace''&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Lefebvre|Lefebvre, Henri]] (1974): La Production de L'Espace. Paris (Anthropos).&lt;/ref&gt; as late as 1974. Sorre developed a schema of society related to the ecological idea of [[habitat]], which was applied to an urban context by the sociologist [[Paul-Henry Chombart de Lauwe]].&lt;ref&gt;Buttimer, Anne (1969): Social Space in Interdisciplinary Perspective. ''Geographical Review'' 59 (3): 417-426.&lt;/ref&gt; For the Dutch geographer [[Christiaan van Paassen]], the world consisted of socio-spatial entities of different scales formed by what he referred to as a "syn-ecological complex",&lt;ref&gt;[[Christiaan van Paassen|van Passen, Christiaan]] (1965): Preliminary to social-geographical theory. Utrecht. [3-5]&lt;/ref&gt; an idea influenced by [[existentialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoekveld, Gerard (2003): Christiaan van Paassen (1917-1996). In: Armstrong, Patrick H. and Geoffrey J. Martin (eds.): Geographers: Biobibliographical Studies (22). New York: 157-168 [158].&lt;/ref&gt;

A more analytical ecological approach on human geography was the one developed by [[Edgar Kant]] in his native Estonia in the 1930s and later at [[Lund University]], which he called "anthropo-ecology". His awareness of the temporal dimension of social life would lead to the formation of [[time geography]] through the works of [[Torsten Hägerstrand]] and [[Sven Godlund]].&lt;ref&gt;Buttimer, Anne (2005): Edgar Kant (1902–1978): A Baltic Pioneer. ''Geografiska Annaler, Series B: Human Geography'' 87 (3): 175-192 [179-180].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1856">A '''squib''' is a brief satirical or witty piece of writing or speech, like a [[parody|lampoon]], or a short, sometimes humorous piece in a newspaper or magazine, used as a filler. It can be  intended to ignite thinking and discourse by others on topics of theoretical importance—e.g., see [[MIT Press]]'s journal, ''[[Linguistic Inquiry]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=4&amp;tid=6|title=The MIT Press|website=MIT Press|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is often less substantial than this and just humorous (see [[The Daily Squib]]).

One of the most famous squibs in English literature is ''The Candidate'' by [[Thomas Gray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Toynbee, Paget|editorlink=Paget Toynbee|chapter=The Candidate|title=The correspondence of Gray, Walpole, West and Ashton (1734–1771)|volume=vol. 2|year=1915|pages=226–228|publisher=Oxford University Press|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QF0EAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Squib}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]], squibs may outline anomalous data but not suggest a solution. This usage in the field was popularized by [[John R. Ross|John R. “Haj” Ross]] in the 1960s. A squib may also develop a minor theoretical argument. A particularly interesting variety of squibs are the so-called snippets, which are "the ideal footnote: a side remark that taken on its own is not worth lengthy development but that needs to be said".&lt;ref name="ledonline.it"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ledonline.it/snippets/|title=Led on Line - Snippets|website=www.ledonline.it|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The online journal Snippets is dedicated to this type of squib.&lt;ref name="ledonline.it"/&gt;

The number of stone inscriptions which have been found in [[Sri Lanka]] to date is over 4000. But these inscriptions are of different types. Considering their locations and their appearances, for the ease of studying, they are classified as follows:

# Cave Inscriptions
# Rock Inscriptions                                            [[File:Galpotha inscription.JPG|thumb|Galpotha inscription]]
# Slab Inscriptions
# Pillar Inscriptions

From the name itself it's easy to understand what type of these inscriptions are.&lt;br /&gt;
Cave inscriptions can be found in [[Mihintala Raja Maha Vihara|Mihintala]], Wessagiriya, [[Sithulpawwa Rajamaha Viharaya|Sithulpawwa]], and [[Ritigala]].&lt;br /&gt;
Some examples for the rock inscriptions are the Galwala inscription, the bilingual inscription found in [[Gadaladeniya]] and the Alawala inscription.&lt;br /&gt;
[[Polonnaruwa]] galpotha inscription, the Mihintale slab inscription and the Thonigala inscription are examples for the slab inscriptions.&lt;br /&gt;
Badulla inscription and the Katugahagalge inscription are classified under pillar inscriptions.

Cave inscriptions are found to be the oldest type of inscriptions. They are inscribed below the drip ledge (katarama) of caves. These are seen almost in every cave belonging to the early period. At the beginning the inscriptions had two or three short lines containing the information about donations made to bhikkus. But after the 2nd century A.C according to the [[Mihintale]] inscription, Jethavanaramaya sanskrit inscription and Badulla pillar inscription the inscriptions have got lengthy descriptions. The inscription on Abhayagiri terrace has 16 long lines. The inscription on the terrace of Dakunu Vihara is spread out on 17 slabs. Some inscriptions were produced in multiple copies. Thirteen copies of the Vevalkatiya inscription of Udaya IV were placed in various part of the Rajarata. After the 10th century A.C these have become more descriptive because they contained appreciations made for some kings.&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the uses of these inscriptions are,
* to fill the gaps in some historic facts[[File:A pillar inscription.jpg|thumb|A pillar inscription]]
* to get evidence for the historic facts
* to know information which have not been written in books
* to know about the ancient methods of controlling the temples
* to know the ancient methods of administrating the countries
* to know the old social traditions and customs
* to get information about the economy of ancient sri lanka
* to get a knowledge about the evolution of the language and the letters
* to get other cultural records
* to know different symbols used for different purposes
* to know sinhala grammar
* to know the names o the kings,rural kings and princes
* to know the designations of the royal officers
* to get an idea about the trade and industries in ancient country
* to get information about the religious activities and other religious beliefs

== Evolution ==

At the beginning the inscriptions had two or three short lines containing the information about donations made to bhikkhus. But after the 2nd century A.C according to the [[Mihintale]] inscription, Jethavanaramaya sanskrit inscription and Badulla pillar inscription the inscriptions have got lengthy descriptions. Inscription on Abhayagiri terrace has 16 long lines. The inscription on the terrace of Dakunu Vihara is spread out on 17 slabs. Some inscriptions were produced in multiple copies. Thirteen copies of the Vevalkatiya inscription of Udaya IV were placed in various part of the Rajarata. After the 10th century A.C these have become more descriptive because they contained appreciations made for some kings.
When considering the letters and the symbols used in the inscriptions, inscriptions written in different languages have been found. It is clear that people have used brahmi letters, [[Pali]] and [[Sanskrit]] to write these inscriptions. Here from these inscriptions information can be gathered in order to get a knowledge about the evolution of the sinhala letters and the development of the language, grammar rules, and structure.

== Donations ==

"දෙවනපිය මහ රක්ඛභ බරියය බකි(නිය) උපසික වරුණ(දත)ය(ලෙ)(ෙ)ණ"-The cave of Waruna Datta Upasika the sister of the queen of [[King Devanampiyatissa]]&lt;br /&gt;
"බඩගරික පරුමක කිස පුත පරුමක අශඩ ශුතඟ ලෙණෙ"-The cave of Ashanda gutta

These caves say the names of the people who made and donated the caves to the bhikkhus for their use. Because of these people could know the donar and his/her title, genealogy, profession, and status. When studying these inscriptions, it is clear that donation was not limited to kings and royalty, but also people of different classes. These form of inscriptions written in pre- and post-brahmi letters have been found in places such as Rajagirikanda and Aanaikkuttikanda.

== Economy ==

A single inscription can yield information on many different subjects. These inscriptions provide information about the economy of ancient Sri Lanka. Information like the old trade methods, the occupations and the economic stability of people, ownership of lands, types of taxes which cannot be extracted from the literary resources can be found from them. For example, Godawaya pillar inscription says about the taxes levied in the Godapawatha Harbour, [[Badulla Pillar Inscription]] says about the administration of an old market and Perimiyankulam inscription provides information about old trade grades and industries.

== Society ==

Stone inscriptions give facts about the spread of Buddhism, spread of the civilization and spread of the stone inscriptions. Moreover they help us to understand how far the kings had power over the country. Inscriptions reveal information that is not written in literary sources. For example, Kaduruwewa inscription says about five generations of ministers.
When taking about the religious background, inscriptions provide information about bhikkhus, various religious beliefs and customs, administration of the temples, the lands owned by the temples and privileges. Mihintale pillar inscription, Abayagiriya sanskrit inscription and Kaludiya pokuna inscription tell about the administration of the temples and [[Sithulpawwa Rajamaha Viharaya|Sithulpawwa]] inscription says how the income gained by the judiciary was given to the temples.

One of the most important uses of these inscriptions is that the information contained in these are contemporary to a particular incident. Therefore the information written in the literary sources can be proven by the inscriptions.

[[File:Strathcona Science Park.JPG|thumbnail|Park welcome sign]]

'''Strathcona Science Provincial Park ''' is a [[provincial park]] in [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], located between [[Edmonton]] and [[Sherwood Park]], south of the [[Yellowhead Highway]] and west of [[Anthony Henday Drive]].

The park is situated in the [[North Saskatchewan River]] valley, on both banks of the river, at an elevation of {{cvt|625|m}} and has a surface of {{cvt|2.9|km2|sqmi}}. It was established on December&amp;nbsp;12, 1979 and is maintained by [[Alberta Tourism, Parks and Recreation]].

This site was for thousands of years the site of an annual aboriginal camp, as it was located close enough to the river for transportation and trade and the bluffs of the river valley provided excellent bison-hunting opportunities.  The park was established to preserve the site from encroaching industrial development.  It was the site of archeological excavations in 1978 to 1980.&lt;ref&gt;https://openlibrary.org/b/OL2751267M/Strathcona_site_(FjPi-29)_excavations_1978_1979_and_1980&lt;/ref&gt;

The park contains several abandoned [[Interpretation centre|interpretive buildings]] opened by the Alberta government in 1980 but now shuttered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/alberta/once-celebrated-science-park-becomes-shuttered-casualty-in-alberta/article26866498/ "Once celebrated science park becomes shuttered casualty in Alberta"], ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', Oct. 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Remnants of the park's history as a public science center include tiled triangular [[obelisk]]s, a [[boardwalk]] through the archaeological area, and a few interpretive plaques.  The area is safe but overgrown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author=River Valley Alliance| url=http://rivervalleypark.blogspot.com/2011/06/getting-out-in-river-valley.html| title= Getting Out in the River Valley |accessdate=2011-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Goyette |first= Linda  |author2=Carolina Jakeway Roemmich  |title= Edmonton in Our Own Words |publisher= [[University of Alberta Press]] |page= 10 |year= 2004 |isbn= 0-88864-428-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4703">'''Symbolic boundaries''' are a theory of how people form social groups proposed by [[cultural sociology|cultural sociologists]].
Symbolic boundaries are “conceptual distinctions made by social actors…that separate people into groups and generate feelings of similarity and group membership.”&lt;ref name=LamontMolnar2002&gt;[[Michele Lamont|Lamont, Michele]] and Virag Molnar. 2002. "The Study of Boundaries in the Social Sciences" Annual Review of Sociology. 28:167-95&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolic boundaries are a necessary but insufficient condition for social change. Only when symbolic boundaries are widely agreed upon can they take on a constraining character and become social boundaries.&lt;ref name=LamontMolnar2002/&gt;

==Durkheim==

[[Émile Durkheim]] saw the symbolic boundary between sacred and profane as the most profound of all social facts, and the one from which lesser symbolic boundaries were derived.&lt;ref&gt;Emile Durkheim, ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'' (1971[1915]) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ritual]]s - secular or religious - were for Durkheim the means by which groups maintained their symbolic/moral boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Allen, ''Explorations in Classical Sociological Theory'' (2009) p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Mary Douglas]] has subsequently emphasised the role of symbolic boundaries in organising experience, private and public, even in a secular society;&lt;ref&gt;Mary Douglas, ''Natural Symbols'' (2002) p. 50-1&lt;/ref&gt; while other neo-Durkheimians highlight the role of [[Deviance (sociology)|deviancy]] as one of revealing and making plain the symbolic boundaries that uphold moral order, and of providing an opportunity for  their communal reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Annalee R. Ward, '' Mouse Morality'' (2002) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; As Durkheim himself put it, "Crime brings together upright consciences and concentrates them...to talk of the event and wax indignant in common",&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Peter Worsley ed., ''The New Modern Sociology Readings'' (1991) p. 480&lt;/ref&gt; thereby reaffirming the collective barriers that have been breached.

==Transgressing boundaries==

[[Prejudice]] is often the result of crossing the symbolic boundaries that preserve a group's sense of itself - boundaries that as with a nation's frontiers may in fact be real as well as symbolic.&lt;ref&gt;C. Cunningham, ''Prejudice'' (2000) p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; (The ancient ceremony of [[beating the bounds]] highlights that overlapping of real and symbolic bounds).&lt;ref&gt;[[François Laroque]], ''Shakespeare's Festive World'' (1991) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salman Rushdie]] has emphasised the role of the migrant as a [[Postmodernity|postmodern]] representative, transgressing symbolic boundaries, and (potentially at least) demonised by their upholders in the host nation as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Salman Rushdie, ''Imaginary Homelands'' (1991) p. 278-9 and p. 402&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marjorie Garber]] has explored the role of the [[Transvestism|transvestite]] in crossing the symbolic boundaries of gender - something which she considered tended to challenge those of race as well.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (1994) p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolic/social boundaries==

Symbolic boundaries are distinct from “social boundaries" that are "objectified forms of social differences manifested in unequal access to an unequal distribution of resources… and social opportunities.”&lt;ref name=LamontMolnar2002/&gt;

==Play==

[[Play (activity)|Playing]] may be seen as a way of testing social boundaries - the unspoken [[Frame analysis|frames]] set about social activities.&lt;ref&gt;Gerry Bloustien, ''Girl Making'' (2003) p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Humour too provides a way of illuminating, testing and perhaps also shifting symbolic boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;P. Morey/A. Yaqin, ''Framing Muslims'' (2011) p. 199-204&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural examples==

* [[Michael Jackson]], in Garber's opinion, erases and detraumatises not only the boundaries between male and female, youth and age, but also between black and white internalising cultural category crises.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Phillips, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Essence of Christianity''''' ({{lang-de|Das Wesen des Christentums}}; historical orthography: ''Das Weſen des Chriſtenthums'') is a book by [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] first published in 1841. It explains Feuerbach's [[philosophy]] and [[critique of religion]].

== Influence ==

The book is often considered a classic of [[humanism]] and the author's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''. [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] were strongly influenced by the book, although they criticised Feuerbach for his inconsistent espousal of [[materialism]]. Feuerbach's theory of [[Social alienation|alienation]] would later be used by Marx in his [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]]. [[Max Stirner]] directed his ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' against it. Rather than simply a polemic, Stirner's work uses Feuerbach's idea of God as a human abstraction as the basis of his critique of Feuerbach.

== In the consciousness of the infinite ==

Feuerbach's theme was a derivation of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel's]] speculative theology in which the Creation remains a part of the Creator, while the Creator remains greater than the Creation. When the student Feuerbach presented his own theory to professor Hegel, Hegel refused to reply positively to it.

In Part I of his book, Feuerbach developed what he calls the "true or anthropological essence of religion." Treating of God in his various aspects "as a being of the understanding," "as a moral being or law," "as love" and so on.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Feuerbach, Ludwig Andreas |volume=10 |pages=302–303 |first=Henry |last=Sturt |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feuerbach talks of how man is equally a conscious being, more so than God because man has placed upon God the ability of understanding. Man contemplates many things and in doing so he becomes acquainted with himself. Feuerbach shows that in every aspect God corresponds to some feature or need of human nature. "If man is to find contentment in God," he claims, "he must find himself in God."&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Thus God is nothing else than man: he is, so to speak, the outward projection of man's inward nature.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; This projection is dubbed as a chimera by Feuerbach, that God and the idea of a higher being is dependent upon the aspect of benevolence. Feuerbach states that, "a God who is not benevolent, not just, not wise, is no God", and continues to say that qualities are not suddenly denoted as divine because of their godly association. The qualities themselves are divine therefore making God divine, indicating that man is capable of understanding and applying meanings of divinity to religion and not that religion makes a man divine.

The force of this attraction to religion though, giving divinity to a figure like God, is explained by Feuerbach as God is a being that acts throughout man in all forms. God, "is the principle of [man's] salvation, of [man's] good dispositions and actions, consequently [man's] own good principle and nature". It appeals to man to give qualities to the idol of their religion because without these qualities a figure such as God would become merely an object, its importance would become obsolete, there would no longer be a feeling of an existence for God. Therefore, Feuerbach says, when man removes all qualities from God, "God is no longer anything more to him than a negative being". Additionally, because man is imaginative, God is given traits and there holds the appeal. God is a part of man through the invention of a God. Equally though, man is repulsed by God because, "God alone is the being who acts of himself".

In part 2 he discusses the "false or theological essence of religion," ''i.e.'' the view which regards God as having a separate existence over against man. Hence arise various mistaken beliefs, such as the belief in revelation which he believes not only injures the moral sense, but also "poisons, nay destroys, the divinest feeling in man, the sense of truth," and the belief in sacraments such as the Lord's Supper, which is to him a piece of religious materialism of which "the necessary consequences are superstition and immorality."&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

A caustic criticism of Feuerbach was delivered in 1844 by [[Max Stirner]]. In his book ''Der Einzige und sein Eigentum'' (''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'') he attacked Feuerbach as inconsistent in his [[atheism]]. (see External Links)

[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|thumb|[[Gottfried Leibniz]] coined the term "theodicy" in an attempt to justify God's existence in light of the apparent imperfections of the world.]]

'''Theodicy''' ({{IPAc-en|θ|iː|ˈ|ɒ|d|ɪ|s|i}}), in its most common form, is an attempt to answer the question of why a good [[God]] permits the manifestation of [[evil]], thus resolving the issue of the [[problem of evil]]. Some theodicies also address the [[evidential problem of evil]] by attempting "to make the existence of an [[omniscience|all-knowing]], [[omnipotence|all-powerful]] and [[omnibenevolence|all-good or omnibenevolent]] God consistent with the existence of evil or suffering in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Philip A. Pecorino, ''An Introduction to Philosophy: An Online Textbook'' (2000), Chapter 3: ‘Philosophy of Religion’, Section 11: Problem of Evil, online at http://www.qcc.cuny.edu/SocialSciences/ppecorino/INTRO_TEXT/Chapter%203%20Religion/Problem_of_Evil.htm. Retrieved September 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike a defense, which tries to demonstrate that [[existence of God|God's existence]] is logically possible in the light of evil, a theodicy attempts to provide a framework wherein God's existence is also plausible.&lt;ref&gt;A defence is “an effort to show that there is no formal contradiction between the existence of God... and the existence of evil.” Michael Rea and Louis B. Pojman, eds., ''Philosophy of Religion: An Anthology'' (Cengage Learning, 2015, 7th ed.), 229.&lt;/ref&gt; The German mathematician and philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] coined the term "theodicy" in 1710 in his work ''[[Théodicée]]'', though various responses to the problem of evil had been previously proposed. The British philosopher [[John Hick]] traced the history of moral theodicy in his 1966 work, ''Evil and the God of Love'', identifying three major traditions:
# the Plotinian theodicy, named after [[Plotinus]]
# the [[Augustinian theodicy]], which Hick based on the writings of [[Augustine of Hippo]]
# the [[Irenaean theodicy]], which Hick developed, based on the thinking of St. [[Irenaeus]]

The problem was also analyzed by pre-modern theologians and philosophers in the Islamic world. German philosopher [[Max Weber]] (1864–1920) saw theodicy as a social problem, based on the human need to explain puzzling aspects of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Swedberg, Ola Agevall, ''The Max Weber Dictionary: Key Words and Central Concepts'' (Stanford University Press, 2005), 274.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist [[Peter L. Berger]] (1929–2017) argued that religion arose out of a need for social order, and an “implicit theodicy of all social order” developed to sustain it.&lt;ref&gt;Peter L. Berger, ''The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion'' (Doubleday, 1st ed, 1967), 55.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the [[Holocaust]], a number of [[Jewish theology|Jewish theologians]] developed a new response to the problem of evil, sometimes called anti-theodicy, which maintains that God cannot be meaningfully justified. As an alternative to theodicy, a defense has been proposed by the American philosopher [[Alvin Plantinga]], which is focused on showing the logical possibility of God's existence. Plantinga's [[Alvin Plantinga's free will defense|version of the free-will defence]] argued that the coexistence of God and evil is not logically impossible, and that free will further explains the existence of evil without threatening the existence of God.{{Citation needed lead|date=October 2016}}

Similar to a theodicy, a [[#Cosmodicy and anthropodicy|cosmodicy]] attempts to justify the fundamental goodness of the universe, and an anthropodicy attempts to justify the goodness of humanity.

==Definition and etymology==
As defined by Alvin Plantinga, theodicy is the "answer to the question of why God permits evil".&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga, Alvin (1974). ''God, Freedom, and Evil'', William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Theodicy is defined as a theological construct that attempts to vindicate God in response to the [[evidential problem of evil]] that mitigates against the existence of an [[omnipotent]] and [[omnibenevolent]] deity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/theodicy and {{cite book|title=The Bible on Suffering|year=2002|publisher=Paulist Press|location=New York|isbn=0809140489|editor=Anthony J. Tambasco|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition of theodicy is the vindication of divine goodness and providence in view of the existence of evil. The word ''theodicy'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words Θεός ''Τheos'' and δίκη ''dikē''. ''Theos'' is translated "God" and ''dikē'' can be translated as either "trial" or "judgement".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=di/kh "δίκη"]. ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, theodicy literally means "justifying God".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica Online'', s. v. [http://0-www.britannica.com.librarycatalog.vts.edu/EBchecked/topic/590596/theodicy "theodicy"], accessed October 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', [[Nick Trakakis]] proposed an additional three requirements which must be contained within a theodicy:
* Common sense views of the world
* Widely held historical and scientific opinion
* Plausible moral principles&lt;ref name=IEP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/evil-evi/#H4 |title=The Evidential Problem of Evil |publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=March 31, 2005 |accessdate=January 16, 2012 |author=Trakakis, Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a response to the problem of evil, a theodicy is distinct from a defence. A defence attempts to demonstrate that the occurrence of evil does not contradict God's existence, but it does not propose that rational beings are able to understand why God permits evil. A theodicy seeks to show that it is reasonable to believe in God despite evidence of evil in the world and offers a framework which can account for why evil exists.&lt;ref&gt;Bunnin &amp; Tsui-James 2002, p. 481&lt;/ref&gt; A theodicy is often based on a prior [[natural theology]], which attempts to prove the existence of God, and seeks to demonstrate that God's existence remains probable after the problem of evil is posed by giving a justification for God's permitting evil to happen.&lt;ref&gt;Geivett 1995, pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt; Defenses propose solutions to the [[logical problem of evil]], while theodicies attempt to answer the evidential (inductive) problem.&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt;

{{quote|"It is important to note that there are at least two concepts of evil: a broad concept and a narrow concept. The broad concept picks out any bad state of affairs... [and] has been divided into two categories: natural evil and moral evil. Natural evils are bad states of affairs which do not result from the intentions or negligence of moral agents. Hurricanes and toothaches are examples of natural evils. By contrast, moral evils do result from the intentions or negligence of moral agents. Murder and lying are examples of moral evils. Evil in the broad sense, which includes all natural and moral evils, tends to be the sort of evil referenced in theological contexts... [T]he narrow concept of evil picks out only the most morally despicable... [it] involves moral condemnation, [and] is appropriately ascribed only to moral agents and their actions."&lt;ref name="Todd Calder"&gt;Calder, Todd, "The Concept of Evil", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2016 Edition), Edward N.

Philosopher [Susan Nieman] says "a [[Crimes against humanity|''crime against humanity'']] is something for which we have procedures, ... [and it] can be ... fit into the rest of our experience. To call an action ''evil'' is to suggest that it cannot [be fitted in]..."&lt;ref name="Susan Nieman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nieman|first1=Susan|title=Evil in Modern Thought: An Alternative History of Philosophy|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-691-16850-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3LpKCAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Evil%20in%20Modern%20Thought%20by%20Susan%20Nieman&amp;pg=PR4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}}  

Marxism, "selectively elaborating Hegel," defines evil in terms of its effect.&lt;ref name="N.T.Wright"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=N. T.|title=Evil and the Justice of God|year=2006|publisher=Intervarsity Press|location=Downer's Grove, Illinois|isbn=978-0-8308-3415-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}}  Philosopher John Kekes says the effect of evil must include actual harm "that 'interferes with the functioning of a person as a full-fledged agent.' (Kekes 1998, 217)."&lt;ref name="Todd Calder"/&gt;  Christian philosophers and theologians such as  [[Richard Swinburne]] and [[N. T. Wright]] also define evil in terms of effect saying an "...act is objectively good (or bad) if it is good (or bad) in its consequences".&lt;ref name="Richard Swinburne"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swinburne|first1=Richard|title=Providence and the Problem of Evil|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=0-19-823799-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}}&lt;ref name="N.T.Wright"/&gt;  Hinduism defines evil in terms of its effect saying "the evils that afflict people (and indeed animals) in the present life are the effects of wrongs committed in a previous life".&lt;ref name="N.T.Wright"/&gt;{{rp|34}}  Some contemporary philosophers argue a focus on the effects of evil is inadequate as a definition since evil can observe without actively causing the harm, and it is still evil.&lt;ref name="Todd Calder"/&gt;  

[[Pseudo-Dionysus]] defines evil by those aspects that show an absence of good.&lt;ref name="N.T.Wright"/&gt;{{rp|37}}  Writers in this tradition saw things as belonging to 'forms' and evil as an absence of being a good example of their form: as a deficit of goodness where goodness ought to have been present. In this same line of thinking, [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] also defined evil as an absence of good, as did theologian and monk [[Thomas Aquinas]] who said: "... a man is called ''bad'' insofar as he lacks a virtue, and an eye is called ''bad'' insofar as it lacks the power of sight."&lt;ref name="Richard Swinburne"/&gt;{{rp|37}} ''Bad'' as an absence of ''good'' resurfaces in [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Karl Barth|Barth]].  Very similar are the [[Neoplatonists]], such as [[Plotinus]] and contemporary philosopher Denis O'Brien, who say evil is a privation.&lt;ref name="O'Brien"&gt;O'Brien, D., 1996, “Plotinus on matter and evil,” in The Cambridge Companion to Plotinus, L.P. Gerson (ed.), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 171–195.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Plotinus"&gt;Plotinus, The Enneads, S. Mackenna (trans.), London: Faber, 4th edition, revised by B.S. Page, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Immanuel Kant]] was the first to offer a purely secular theory of evil, giving an evaluative definition of evil based on its cause as having a will that is not fully good.  Kant has been an important influence on philosophers like [[Hanna Arendt]], [[Claudia Card]], and Richard Bernstein.&lt;ref name="Immanuel Kant"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kant|first1=Immanuel|title=Kant: Religion Within the Boundaries of Mere Reason: And Other Writings|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0-521-59049-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; "...Hanna Arendt... uses the term [radical evil] to denote a new form of wrongdoing which cannot be captured by other moral concepts."&lt;ref name="Todd Calder"/&gt;  The Muslim also provides an evaluative definition of evil saying it is the result of the world not being fully Muslim.&lt;ref name="N.T.Wright"/&gt;{{rp|34}}  Claudia Card says evil is excessive wrong-doing; others like [[Hillel Steiner]] say evil is qualitatively not quantitatively distinct from mere wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="Todd Calder"/&gt; 

[[John Locke|Locke]], [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Liebniz]] define good and evil in terms of pleasure and pain.&lt;ref name="John Locke"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Locke|first1=John|title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|date=1836|publisher=B.Griffin and Co.|location=Glasgow}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hobbes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hobbes|first1=Thomas|title=Leviathan|date=2018|publisher=Lerner Publishing Group|location=Minneapolis, Minnesota|isbn=978 151 248609 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Liebniz|first1=Gottfried Wilhelm|title=Theodicy|date=2009|publisher=Cosimo books|isbn=978-1-61640-295-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as Richard Swinburne find that definition inadequate, saying, "the good of individual humans...consists...in their having free will...the ability to develop ...character..., to show courage and loyalty, to love, to be of use, to contemplate beauty and discover truth... All that [good]...cannot be achieved without ... suffering along the way."&lt;ref name="Richard Swinburne"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

{{quote|"Most theorists writing about evil believe that evil action requires a certain sort of motivation... the desire to cause harm, or to do wrong,...pleasure (Steiner 2002), the desire to annihilate all being (Eagleton 2010), or the destruction of others for its own sake (Cole 2006). When evil is restricted to actions that follow from these sorts of motivations, theorists sometimes say that their subject is pure, radical, diabolical, or monstrous evil. This suggests that their discussion is restricted to a type, or form, of evil and not to evil per se."&lt;ref name= "Todd Calder"/&gt;}}

Some theorists define evil by what emotions are connected to it. "For example, Laurence Thomas believes that evildoers take delight in causing harm or feel hatred toward their victims (Thomas 1993, 76–77)."&lt;ref name="Todd Calder"/&gt;   Buddhism defines evil as behavior resulting from a failure to emotionally detach from the world.&lt;ref name="Nyanaponika Thera"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thera|first1=Nyanaponika|title=The Roots of Good and Evil: Buddhist Texts translated from the Pali|date=2008|isbn=978-955-24-0316-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian theologians generally define evil in terms of both human responsibility and the nature of God: "If we take the essentialist view of Christian ethics... evil is anything contrary to God's good nature...(character or attributes)."&lt;ref name="Joseph B. Onyango Okello"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Okello|first1=Joseph B. Onyango|title=Evil and Pain: A Critique of the Materialistic Account of Evil|date=2017|publisher=Wipf and Stock|location=Eugene, Oregon|isbn=978-1-5326-0134-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Judaic view, while acknowledging the difference between the human and divine perspective of evil, is rooted in the nature of creation itself and the limitation inherent in matter's capacity to be perfected; the action of freewill includes the potential for perfection from individual effort and leaves the responsibility for evil in human hands.&lt;ref name="Oliver Leaman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leaman|first1=Oliver|title=Evil and Suffering in Jewish Philosophy|date=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-521-41724-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|70}} 

"[It is] deeply central to the whole tradition of Christian (and other western) religion that God is loving toward his creation and that involves him behaving in morally good ways toward it."&lt;ref name="Richard Swinburne"/&gt;{{rp|3}} Within Christianity "God is supposed to be in some way personal... a being who is essentially eternal, omnipotent, omniscient, Creator and sustainer of the universe, and perfectly good. An omnipotent being is one who can do anything logically possible... such a being could not make me exist and not exist at the same time but he could eliminate the stars...  An omniscient being is one who knows everything logically possible for him to know... he will not necessarily know everything that will happen [i.e. humans with freewill] unless it is predetermined that it will happen..." &lt;ref name="Richard Swinburne"/&gt;{{rp|3-15}} God's perfect goodness is moral goodness.&lt;ref name="Richard Swinburne"/&gt;{{rp|15}} "Western religion has always held that there is a deep problem about why there is pain and suffering--which there would not be if God were not supposed to be morally good... a personal being who was not morally good would not be the great being God is supposed to be... [Since theodicy is concerned with] the existence (or not) of the sort of God with which Western religion is concerned, this understanding of the definition of God must stand."&lt;ref name="Richard Swinburne"/&gt;{{rp|16}}

==Reasons for theodicy==
German philosopher [[Max Weber]] interpreted theodicy as a social problem,&lt;ref&gt;Swedberg 2005, pp. 273–74&lt;/ref&gt; and viewed theodicy as a "problem of meaning". Weber argued that, as human society became increasingly [[rationality|rational]], the need to explain why good people suffered and evil people prospered became more important because religion casts the world as a "meaningful cosmos". Weber framed the problem of evil as the dilemma that the good can suffer and the evil can prosper, which became more important as religion became more sophisticated.&lt;ref&gt;Scott 2009, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; He identified two purposes of theodicy: to explain why good people suffer (a theodicy of suffering), and why people prosper (a theodicy of good fortune). A theodicy of good fortune seeks to justify the good fortune of people in society; Weber believed that those who are successful are not satisfied unless they can justify why they deserve to be successful.&lt;ref&gt;Swedberg 2005, p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; For theodicies of suffering, Weber argued that three different kinds of theodicy emerged—[[predestination]], [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]], and [[karma]]—all of which attempt to satisfy the human need for meaning, and he believed that the quest for meaning, when considered in light of suffering, becomes the problem of suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Scott 2009, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Peter L. Berger]] characterised religion as the human attempt to build order out of a chaotic world. He believed that humans could not accept that anything in the world was meaningless and saw theodicy as an assertion that the cosmos has meaning and order, despite evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;Scott 2009, pp. 5–7&lt;/ref&gt; Berger presented an argument similar to that of Weber, but suggested that the need for theodicy arose primarily out of the situation of human society. He believed that theodicies existed to allow individuals to transcend themselves, denying the individual in favour of the social order.&lt;ref&gt;Woodhead 2001, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher Richard Swinburne says "most theists need a theodicy, [they need] an account of reasons why God might allow evil to occur. Without a theodicy evil counts against the existence of God."&lt;ref name="Richard Swinburne"/&gt;{{rp|2}}

==History==
The term ''theodicy'' was coined by German philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] in his 1710 work, written in [[French language|French]], ''[[Essais de Théodicée sur la bonté de Dieu, la liberté de l'homme et l'origine du mal]]'' (''Theodicy: Essays on the Goodness of God, the Freedom of Man and the Origin of Evil'').&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz 1734&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz's ''Théodicée'' was a response to [[skepticism|skeptical]] Protestant philosopher [[Pierre Bayle]], who wrote in his work ''[[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique]]'' that, after rejecting three attempts to solve it, he saw no rational solution to the problem of evil. Bayle argued that, because the [[Bible]] asserts the coexistence of God and evil, this state of affairs must simply be accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bayle/ | title=Pierre Bayle | publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=7 February 2003 | accessdate=January 22, 2012 | author=Lennon, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French philosopher [[Voltaire]] criticised Leibniz's concept of theodicy in his ''[[Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne]]'' (''Poem on the Lisbon disaster''), suggesting that the massive destruction of innocent lives caused by the [[Lisbon earthquake]] demonstrated that God was not providing the "best of all possible worlds".&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire, [[Candide]] and ''Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne''&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire also includes the earthquake/theodicy theme in his novel ''Candide''.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1992), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (1914), Constantine Kempf argued that, following Leibniz's work, philosophers called their works on the problem of evil "theodicies", and philosophy about God was brought under the discipline of theodicy. He argued that theodicy began to include all of [[natural theology]], meaning that theodicy came to consist of the human knowledge of God through the systematic use of reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14569a.htm | title=Theodicy | publisher=The Catholic Encyclopedia | year=2012 | accessdate=September 4, 2012 | author=Kempf, Constantine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, British philosopher [[John Hick]] published ''Evil and the God of Love'', in which he surveyed various Christian responses to the problem of evil, before developing his own.&lt;ref&gt;Cheetham 2003, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; In his work, Hick identified and distinguished between three types of theodicy: Plotinian, which was named after Plotinus, [[Augustinian theodicy|Augustinian]], which had dominated [[Western Christianity]] for many centuries, and [[Irenaean theodicy|Irenaean]], which was developed by the Eastern [[Church Father]] [[Irenaeus]], a version of which Hick subscribed to himself.&lt;ref&gt;Hall 2003, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

In his dialogue "Is God a Taoist?",&lt;ref&gt;Smullyan 1977, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1977 in his book ''[[The Tao is Silent]]'', [[Raymond Smullyan]] claims to prove that it is logically impossible to have sentient beings without allowing "evil", even for God, just as it is impossible for him to create a triangle in the Euclidean plane having an angular sum other than 180°. So the capability of feeling implies free will, which in turn may produce "evil", understood here as hurting other sentient beings. The problem of evil happening to good or innocent people is not addressed directly here, but both reincarnation and karma are hinted at.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Ancient religions===
“Writings and discourses on theodicy by Jews, Greeks, Christians, and Eastern religions have graced our planet for thousands of years.”&lt;ref&gt;Birnbaum, David (1989). ''God and Evil''. Hoboken: Ktav Pub. House. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]] (2000 BC to 1700 BC) as “in Ancient Mesopotamian and Israelite literature,” theodicy was an important issue.&lt;ref&gt;Assman, Jan (2001). ''The Search for God in Ancient Egypt'' trans. David Lorton. Cornell University Press. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr Philip Irving Mitchell of the [[Dallas Baptist University]] notes that some philosophers have cast the pursuit of theodicy as a modern one, as earlier scholars used the problem of evil to support the existence of one particular god over another, explain wisdom, or explain a conversion, rather than to justify God's goodness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www3.dbu.edu/mitchell/theodicy.htm | title=Theodicy: An Overview | publisher=Dallas Baptist University | accessdate=July 17, 2012 | author=Mitchell, Dr Philip Irving}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Sarah Iles Johnston]] argues that ancient civilizations, such as the ancient [[Ancient Mesopotamia|Mesopotamians]], [[ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] held [[polytheistic]] beliefs that may have enabled them to deal with the concept of theodicy differently. These religions taught the existence of many [[deity|gods]] and [[goddess]]es who controlled various aspects of daily life. These early religions may have avoided the question of theodicy by endowing their deities with the same flaws and jealousies that plagued [[human]]ity. No one god or goddess was fundamentally good or evil; this explained that bad things could happen to good people if they angered a deity because the gods could exercise the same free will that humankind possesses. Such religions taught that some gods were more inclined to be helpful and benevolent, while others were more likely to be spiteful and aggressive. In this sense, the evil gods could be blamed for misfortune, while the good gods could be petitioned with prayer and sacrifices to make things right. There was still a sense of justice in that individuals who were right with the gods could avoid punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston 2004, pp. 531–47&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[Epicurean trilemma]]" however was already raised ~300BC by [[Epicurus]]. It is the first credited to describe the problem of reconciling an omnipotent deity with their benevolence and the existence of evil.

====Biblical theodicy====
{{Main article|Theodicy and the Bible}}
The biblical account of the justification of evil and suffering in the presence of God has both similarities and contrasts in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. For the Hebrew Bible, the [[Book of Job]] is often quoted as the authoritative source of discussion.&lt;ref&gt;''The Old Testament''. Modern Library Edition, Introduction, authored by George Steiner.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The author of Job seeks to expand the understanding of divine justice ...beyond mere retribution, to include a system of divine sovereignty [showing] the King has the right to test His subject's loyalty...  The book of Job corrects the rigid and overly simplistic doctrine of retribution in attributing suffering to sin and punishment. It closes with a focus on the bond between creator and creation, on placing one's trust in that, and on hope rooted in belief that God is in ultimate control."&lt;ref name="Grace Ko"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ko|first1=Grace|title=Theodicy in Habakkuk|date=2014|publisher=Paternoster|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Chapter 3:Job}}

It is generally accepted that God's responsive speeches in Job do not directly answer Job's complaints; God does not explain Himself or reveal the reason for Job's suffering to him; instead Yahweh's speeches focus on increasing Job's overall understanding of his relationship with God. This exemplifies Biblical theodicy.&lt;ref&gt;Pathways in Theodicy: An Introduction to the Problem of Evil By Mark S. M. Scott&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21,28}}  There is general agreement among Bible scholars that the Bible "does not admit of a singular perspective on evil. ...Instead we encounter a variety of perspectives...  Consequently [the Bible focuses on] moral and spiritual remedies, not rational or logical [justifications].  ...It is simply that the Bible operates within a cosmic, moral and spiritual landscape rather than within a rationalist, abstract, ontological landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Pathways in Theodicy: An Introduction to the Problem of Evil, By Mark S. M. Scott&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=Mark S. M.|title=Pathways in Theodicy: An Introduction to the Problem of Evil|date=2015|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=978-1-4514-6470-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27}}   

This is in evidence in Yahweh's first and second speech in Job. Yahweh's first speech concerns human ignorance and God's authority. Job had seen himself at the center of events, lamenting that God has singled him out to oppress; God responds that Job is not the center, Yahweh is; His kingdom is complex, He governs on a large scale, and has the right to exercise divine authority; since God is the rightful owner of everything in the universe, Job cannot justly accuse Him of wrongful deprivation.&lt;ref name="Grace Ko"/&gt;{{rp|Chapter 3:Job}}  Yahweh's second speech is against human self-righteousness. Job has vehemently accused God of thwarting justice as "the omnipotent tyrant, the cosmic thug". Some scholars interpret Yahweh's response as an admission of failure on His part, but He goes on to say He has the power and in His own timing will bring justice in the end.&lt;ref name="Grace Ko"/&gt;{{rp|Chapter 3:Job}}

"Isaiah is generally recognized as one of the most progressive books of the prophetic corpus."&lt;ref name="Tod Linafelt"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Linafelt|editor1-first=Tod|title=Strange Fire: Reading the Bible After the Holocaust|date=2000|publisher=New York University Press|isbn=0-8147-5165-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|208}}  Hebrew Bible scholar [[Marvin A. Sweeney]] says "...a unified reading of [Isaiah] places the question of theodicy at the forefront... [with] three major dimensions of the question...: Yahweh's identification with the conqueror, Yahweh's decree of judgment against Israel without possibility of repentance, and the failure of Yahweh's program to be realized by the end of the book."&lt;ref name="Tod Linafelt"/&gt;{{rp|209}}  Christian theologians read some passages in Isaiah differently.   "In either case, suffering is understood as having transcendent meaning... human agency can give particular instances of suffering a mystical significance that transforms it into something productive."&lt;ref name="Sarah K. Pinnock"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pinnock|first1=Sarah K.|title=Beyond Theodicy: Jewish and Christian Continental Thinkers Respond to the Holocaust|date=2002|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=New York|isbn=0-7914-5523-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theodicy in the book of Ezekiel (and also in Jeremiah 31:29-30) confronts the concept of personal moral responsibility. "The main point is stated at the beginning and at the end--"the soul that sins shall die"--and is explicated by a case history of a family traced through three generations." It is not about heredity but is about understanding divine justice in a world under divine governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blenkinsopp|first1=Joseph|title=Ezekiel|date=1990|publisher=John Knox Press|location=Louisville|isbn=0-8042-3118-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}}  

"Theodicy in the Minor Prophets differs little from that in Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel."&lt;ref name="Paul L. Redditt"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Redditt|first1=Paul L|title=Thematic Threads in the Book of the Twelve|date=2003|publisher=Walter De Gruyter|location=New York|isbn=3-11-017594-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the first chapter of Habakuk raises questions about Yahweh's justice, laments God's inaction in punishing injustice, and looks for God's action in response--then objects to what God chooses.&lt;ref name="Grace Ko"/&gt;{{rp|Chapter 1}} Instead of engaging in debate, God gives Habakuk a vision of the future which includes five oracles that form a theodicy: (1) God has a plan and has appointed a time for judgment.  It may be slow in coming as humans see things, but it will come. (2) The woe oracles confront the prevalence of evil in the world and the justice those acts have earned (3) The vision of the manifestation of God is a recognition of God's power to address these issues  (4) God as a warrior will fight for his people  (5) The song of triumph says the faithful will prevail by holding to trust and hope.&lt;ref name="Grace Ko"/&gt;{{rp|Intro, Chapter 3}}  Joel and the other minor prophets demonstrate that theodicy and eschatology are connected in the Bible.&lt;ref name="Paul L. Redditt"/&gt;{{rp|201}}

Psalm 73 presents the internal struggle created by personal suffering and the prosperity of the wicked.  The writer gains perspective when he "enters the sanctuary of God (16-17)" seeing that God's justice will eventually prevail.  He reaffirms his relationship with Yahweh, is ashamed of his resentment, and chooses trust. &lt;ref name="Grace Ko"/&gt;{{rp|Chapter 3:Psalm 73}}  Psalm 77 contains real outspokenness to God as well as determination to hold onto faith and trust.&lt;ref name="Grace Ko"/&gt;{{rp|Chapter 3:Psalm 77}} 

For the Christian, the Scriptures assure him or her that the allowance of evil is for a good purpose based on relationship with God.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Frame and Joseph E. Torres, Apologetics: A Justification of Christian Belief (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&amp;R Publishing, 2015), 184.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Some of the good ... cannot be achieved without delay and suffering, and the evil of this world is indeed necessary for the achievement of those good purposes. ... God has the right to allow such evils to occur, so long as the 'goods' are facilitated and the 'evils' are limited and compensated in the way that various other Christian doctrines (of human freewill, life after death, the end of the world, etc.) affirm. ...the 'good states' which (according to Christian doctrine) God seeks are so good that they outweigh the accompanying evils."&lt;ref name="Richard Swinburne"/&gt;{{rp|Intro.,51}} 

This is somewhat illustrated in the [[Book of Exodus]] when Pharaoh is described as being raised up that God's name be known in all the earth Exodus 9:16. This is mirrored in Romans' ninth chapter, where Paul appeals to God's sovereignty as sufficient explanation, with God's goodness experientially known to the Christian.&lt;ref&gt;Apologetics, Frame 178–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Augustinian theodicy===
{{Main article|Augustinian theodicy}}
The [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] reading of [[Augustinian theodicy]], as promoted primarily by [[John Hick]], is based on the writings of [[Augustine of Hippo]], a [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosopher]] and theologian who lived from AD 354 to 430.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/augustine/#OntEud | title=Saint Augustine |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=24 March 2000; substantive revision 12 November 2010 | accessdate=9 October 2011 | author=Mendelson, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic (pre-reformation) formulation of the same issue is substantially different and is outlined below. In Hick's approach, this form of theodicy argues that evil does not exist except as a [[privation]]—or corruption—of goodness, and therefore God did not create evil.&lt;ref&gt;Menn 2002, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Augustinian scholars have argued that God created the world perfectly, with no evil or human suffering. Evil entered the world through the disobedience of [[Adam and Eve]] and the theodicy casts the existence of evil as a just punishment for this [[original sin]].&lt;ref&gt;Corey 2000, pp. 177–78&lt;/ref&gt; The theodicy argues that humans have an evil nature in as much as it is deprived of its original goodness, form, order, and measure due to the inherited original sin of [[Adam]] and [[Eve]], but still ultimately remains good due to existence coming from God, for if a nature was completely evil (deprived of the good), it would cease to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Green 2011, p. 779&lt;/ref&gt; It maintains that God remains blameless and good.&lt;ref&gt;Geivett 1995, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman Catholic theology|Roman Catholic]] reading of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], the issue of [[just war]] as developed in his book [[City of God (book)|''The City of God'']] substantially established his position concerning the positive justification of killing, suffering and pain as inflicted upon an enemy when encountered in war for a just cause.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/septemberweb-only/9-17-55.0.html A Time For War?] Christianity Today (2001-01-09). Retrieved on 2013-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine asserted that peacefulness in the face of a grave wrong that could only be stopped by violence would be a sin. Defense of one's self or others could be a necessity, especially when authorized by a legitimate authority. While not elaborating the conditions necessary for war to be just, [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] nonetheless originated the very phrase, itself, in his work ''[[The City of God (book)|The City of God]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crusades-encyclopedia.com/augustineofhippo.html Augustine of Hippo] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120728203512/http://www.crusades-encyclopedia.com/augustineofhippo.html |date=2012-07-28 }}.

===Irenaean theodicy===
{{Main article|Irenaean theodicy}}

[[Irenaeus]] (died c. 202), born in the early second century, expressed ideas which explained the existence of evil as necessary for human development. Irenaeus argued that human creation comprised two parts: humans were made first in the image, then in the likeness, of God. The image of God consists of having the potential to achieve moral perfection, whereas the likeness of God is the achievement of that perfection. To achieve moral perfection, Irenaeus suggested that humans must have free will. To achieve such free will, humans must experience suffering and God must be at an [[epistemology|epistemic distance]] (a distance of knowledge) from humanity. Therefore, evil exists to allow humans to develop as moral agents.&lt;ref name="Encountering evil"&gt;
Davis 2001, pp. 40-42&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century, [[John Hick]] collated the ideas of Irenaeus into a distinct theodicy. He argued that the world exists as a "vale of soul-making" (a phrase that he drew from [[John Keats]]), and that suffering and evil must therefore occur. He argued that human goodness develops through the experience of evil and suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Stump 1999, pp. 222–27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origenian theodicy===
In direct response to John Hick's description of theodicy, Mark Scott has indicated that neither [[Augustine of Hippo]] nor [[Irenaeus|Irenaeus of Lyons]] provide an appropriate context for the discussion of Hick's theistic version of theodicy. As a theologian among the [[Church Fathers]] who articulated a theory of ''[[apokatastasis]]'' (or [[universal reconciliation]]), [[Origen|Origen of Alexandria]] provides a more direct theological comparison for the discussion of Hick's presentation of universal salvation and theodicy. Neither Irenaeus nor Augustine endorsed a theology of universal salvation in any form comparable to that of John Hick.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Mark (2012). ''Origen and the Problem of Evil'', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relatively minor theodicies===
[[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]] summarizes what he calls “relatively minor” theodicies.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Martin, ''Atheism: A Philosophical Justification'' (Temple University Press, 1992), 436–54.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The Finite God Theodicy maintains that God is all-good ([[omnibenevolent]]) but not all-powerful ([[omnipotent]]).
:* The [[Best of all possible worlds|Best of all Possible Worlds]] Theodicy, a traditional theology, argues that the creation is the best of all possible worlds.
:* The [[Original Sin]] Theodicy holds that evil came into the world because of humanity's original sin.
:* The Ultimate Harmony Theodicy justifies evil as leading to “good long-range consequences”.
:* The Degree of Desirability of a Conscious State Theodicy has been reckoned a “complex theodicy.”&lt;ref&gt;Ramblings of a Thomist, Blog of March 27, 2008 http://thomisticramblings.blogspot.com/2008/03/minor-theodicies-and.html. Accessed September 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It argues that a person’s state is deemed evil only when it is undesirable to the person. However, because God is unable to make a person’s state desirable to the person, the theodic problem does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Martin, ''Atheism: A Philosophical Justification'' (Temple University Press, 1992), 444–45. Martin finds this theodicy in George Schlesinger, ''Religion and Scientific Method'' (Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2012) and judges it unsatisfactory.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The [[Reincarnation]] Theodicy believes that people suffer evil because of their wrong-doing in a previous life.
:* The Contrast Theodicy holds that evil is needed to enable people to appreciate or understand good.
:* The Warning Theodicy rationalizes evil as God’s warning to people to mend their ways.

=== Islamic world ===

[[Mu'tazila]] theologians approached the problem of theodicy within a framework of [[moral realism]], according to which the moral value of acts is accessible to unaided reason, so that humans can make moral judgments about divine acts.&lt;ref name=shihadeh&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Ayman Shihadeh|title=Suffering|editor=Josef W. Meri|encyclopedia=Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|page=772|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LaV-IGZ8VKIC&amp;pg=PA772}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that the divine act of creation is good despite existence of suffering, because it allows humans a compensation of greater reward in the afterlife.&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt; They posited that individuals have free will to commit evil and absolved God of responsibility for such acts.&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt; God's justice thus consists of punishing wrongdoers.&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt; Following the demise of Mu'tazila as a school, their theodicy was adopted in the [[Zaydi]] and [[Twelver]] branches of [[Shia Islam]].&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt;

Most Sunni theologians analyzed theodicy from an anti-realist [[Meta-ethics|metaethical]] standpoint.&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt; [[Ash'ari]] theologians argued that ordinary moral judgments stem from emotion and social convention, which are inadequate to either condemn or justify divine actions.&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt; Ash'arites hold that God creates everything, including human actions, but distinguish creation (''khalq'') from acquisition (''kasb'') of actions.&lt;ref name=roy&gt;{{cite book|title=What is Islamic Philosophy?|author=Roy Jackson|publisher=Routledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5XPMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; They allow individuals the latter ability, though they do not posit existence of free will in a fuller sense of the term. In the words of [[Al-Shahrastani]] (1086–1153):&lt;ref name=roy/&gt;

{{quote|God creates, in man, the power, ability, choice, and will to perform an act, and man, endowed with this derived power, chooses freely one of the alternatives and intends or wills to do the action, and, corresponding to this intention, God creates and completes the action.}}

[[Ash'ari]] theology, which dominated Sunni Islam from the tenth to the nineteenth century, also insists on ultimate divine transcendence and teaches that human knowledge regarding it is limited to what has been revealed through the prophets, so that on the question of God's creation of evil, revelation has to accepted ''bila kayfa'' (without [asking] how).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Tamara Sonn|title=Tawḥīd|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|editor=John L. Esposito|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2009|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195305135.001.0001/acref-9780195305135-e-0788?rskey=y8ZWqZ|subscription=yes|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=roy/&gt;

[[Ibn Sina]], the most influential Muslim philosopher, analyzed theodicy from a purely ontological, [[neoplatonic]] standpoint, aiming to prove that God, as the absolutely good First Cause, created a good world.&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt; Ibn Sina argued that evil refers either to a cause of an entity (such as burning in a fire), being a quality of another entity, or to its imperfection (such as blindness), in which case it does not exist as an entity. According to Ibn Sina, such qualities are necessary attributes of the best possible order of things, so that the good they serve is greater than the harm they cause.&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt;

Philosophical Sufi theologians such as [[Ibn Arabi]] were influenced by the neoplatonic theodicy of [[Ibn Sina]].&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt; [[Al-Ghazali]] anticipated the optimistic theodicy of Leibniz in his dictum "There is nothing in possibility more wonderful than what is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Religious Diversity, Evil, and a Variety of Theodicies |author=Michael L.

The [[Hanbali]] scholar [[Ibn Taymiyya]], whose writings became influential in [[Wahhabism]], argued that, while God creates human acts, humans are responsible for their deeds as the agents of their acts.&lt;ref name=hoover&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Jon|last=Hoover|title=Ḥanbalī Theology|editor=Sabine Schmidtke|encyclopedia=The Oxford Handbook of Islamic Theology|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2014|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199696703.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199696703-e-014|subscription=yes|page=642}}&lt;/ref&gt; He held that divine creation is good from a casual standpoint, as God creates all things for wise purposes.&lt;ref name=hoover/&gt; Thus apparent evil is in actuality good in view of its purpose, and pure evil does not exist.&lt;ref name=hoover/&gt; This analysis was developed further with practical illustrations by [[Ibn al-Qayyim]].&lt;ref name=hoover/&gt;

===Jewish anti-theodicy===
{{Main article|Holocaust theology}}
In 1998, Jewish theologian [[Zachary Braiterman]] coined the term anti-theodicy in his book ''(God) After Auschwitz'' to describe Jews, both in a biblical and post-Holocaust context, whose response to the problem of evil is protest and refusal to investigate the relationship between God and suffering. An anti-theodicy acts in opposition to a theodicy and places full blame for all experience of evil onto God, but must rise from an individual's belief in and love of God. Anti-theodicy has been likened to [[Job (religious figure)|Job's]] protests in the [[Book of Job]].&lt;ref&gt;Marty &amp; Taliaferro 2010, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Braiterman wrote that an anti-theodicy rejects the idea that there is a meaningful relationship between God and evil or that God could be justified for the experience of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs &amp; Wolfson 2002, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Holocaust]] prompted a reconsideration of theodicy in some [[Jewish theology|Jewish]] circles.&lt;ref&gt;Pinnock 2002, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; French Jewish philosopher [[Emmanuel Levinas]], who had himself been a [[prisoner of war]] in Nazi Germany, declared theodicy to be "blasphemous", arguing that it is the "source of all immorality", and demanded that the project of theodicy be ended. Levinas asked whether the idea of [[moral absolutism|absolutism]] survived after the Holocaust, which he proposed it did. He argued that humans are not called to justify God in the face of evil, but to attempt to live godly lives; rather than considering whether God was present during the Holocaust, the duty of humans is to build a world where goodness will prevail.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson &amp; Roth 2005, pp. 189–90&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of theology David R. Blumenthal, in his book ''Facing the Abusing God'', supports the "theology of protest", which he saw as presented in the play, ''[[The Trial of God]]''. He supports the view that survivors of the Holocaust cannot forgive God and so must protest about it. Blumenthal believes that a similar theology is presented in the [[book of Job]], in which Job does not question God's existence or power, but his morality and justice.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal 1993, pp. 250–51&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent voices in the Jewish tradition commenting on the justification of God in the presence of the Holocaust have been the Nobel prize winning author Elie Wiesel and Richard L. Rubinstein in his book ''The Cunning of History''.&lt;ref&gt;Rubinstein, Richard L. ''The Cunning of History''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the seventh Rebbe of [[Chabad|Chabad Lubavitch]], sought to elucidate how faith (or trust, ''emunah'') in God defines the full, transcendental preconditions of anti-theodicy. Endorsing the attitude of "holy protest" found in the stories of Job and Jeremiah, but also in those of Abraham ([[Vayeira|Genesis 18]]) and Moses ([[Ki Tissa|Exodus 33]]), Rabbi Schneerson argued that a phenomenology of protest, when carried through to its logical limits, reveals a profound conviction in cosmic justice such, as we first find in Abraham's question: "Will the Judge of the whole earth not do justice?" (Genesis 18:25). Recalling Kant's 1791 essay on the failure of all theoretical attempts in theodicy,&lt;ref&gt;''Über das Misslingen aller philosophischen Versuche in der Theodizee'' http://cas.uchicago.edu/workshops/germanphilosophy/files/2013/02/Kant-On-the-Miscarriage-of-all-Philosophical-Trials-at-Theodicy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; a viable practical theodicy is identified with [[Chabad messianism|messianism]]. This faithful anti-theodicy is worked out in a long letter of 26 April 1965 to Elie Wiesel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chighel.com/opening-statement-7a/ The original letter in Yiddish is found in R. Menachem Mendel Schneerson, ''Likutei Siḥot'', Vol. 33 (New York: Kehot, 1962–2001), pp. 255–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian alternatives to theodicy===
A number of Christian writers oppose theodicies. Todd Billings deems constructing theodicies to be a “destructive practice”.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Billings, "Theodicy as a 'Lived Question': Moving Beyond a Theoretical Approach to Theodicy", http://www.luthersem.edu/ctrf/JCTR/Vol05/billings.htm Accessed September 25, 2013. About the author: http://www.westernsem.edu/about/faculty-staff/.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same vein, [[Nick Trakakis]] observes that “theodical discourse can only add to the world’s evils, not remove or illuminate them.”&lt;ref&gt;Nick Trakakis, “Theodicy: The Solution to the Problem of Evil, or Part of the Problem?”, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/72023480656648g2/ Springerlink.com], accessed December 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; As an alternative to theodicy, some theologians have advocated “reflection on tragedy” as a more befitting reply to evil.&lt;ref&gt;Donald W. Musser and [[Joseph L. Price]], eds., ''A New Handbook of Christian Theology'' (Abingdon Press, 1992), s.v. “Tragedy.”&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Wendy Farley believes that “a desire for justice” and “anger and pity at suffering” should replace “theodicy’s cool justifications of evil”.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Farley, ''Tragic Vision and Divine Compassion: a Contemporary Theodicy'' (Westminster John Knox Press, 1990) 12, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah K. Pinnock opposes abstract theodicies that would legitimize evil and suffering. However, she endorses theodicy discussions in which people ponder God, evil, and suffering from a practical faith perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Katherine Pinnock, ''Beyond Theodicy'' (SUNY Press, 2002), 135, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Barth]] viewed the evil of human suffering as ultimately in the “control of [[divine providence]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Barth, ''Church Dogmatics'' (T &amp; T Clark, 1957), IV-1, 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Given this view, Barth deemed it impossible for humans to devise a theodicy that establishes "the idea of the goodness of God".&lt;ref&gt;Barth, ''Church Dogmatics'', III-1, 368.&lt;/ref&gt; For Barth, only the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] could establish the goodness of God. In the crucifixion, God bears and suffers what humanity suffers.&lt;ref&gt;Barth, ''Church Dogmatics'', II-2, 165.&lt;/ref&gt; This suffering by God Himself makes human theodicies anticlimactic.&lt;ref&gt;Barth, ''Church Dogmatics'', IV-1, 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Barth found a “twofold justification” in the crucifixion:&lt;ref&gt;Barth, ''Church Dogmatics'', II-2, 223.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Justification (theology)|justification of sinful humanity]] and “the justification in which God justifies Himself”.&lt;ref&gt;Barth, ''Church Dogmatics'', IV-1, 564.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Science]] offers a rational, though widely unacceptable, solution to the problem by denying that evil ultimately exists.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Dupre, "The Problem of Evil", 50 Philosophy Ideas You Really Need to Know, London, Quercus, 2007, p. 166: "Denying that there is ultimately any such thing as evil, as advocated by Christian Scientists, solves the problem at a stroke, but such a remedy is too hard for most to swallow."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whale, J. S. The Christian answer to the problem of evil. 1948&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Baker Eddy]] and [[Mark Twain]] had some contrasting views on theodicy and suffering, which are well-described by [[Stephen Gottschalk]].&lt;ref&gt;"Rolling Away the Stone: Mary Baker Eddy's Challenge to Materialism" (Indiana University Press, 2006) 83, 123, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Redemptive suffering]] based in Pope John Paul II's [[theology of the body]] embraces suffering as having value in and of itself.&lt;ref name="Adrian J. Reimers"&gt;{{cite article|last=Reimers|first=Adrian J.|title=Human Suffering and Jon Paul II's Theology of the Body|url=https://www3.nd.edu/~areimers/Suffering-JPII-expanded.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicprimer.org/papal/theology_of_the_body.pdf|title=Catholicprimer.org|website=www.catholicprimer.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eleonore Stump]] in "Wandering in Darkness" uses psychology, narrative and exegesis to demonstrate that redemptive suffering, as found in Thomistic theodicy, can constitute a consistent and cogent defence for the problem of suffering.&lt;ref name="Eleonore Stump"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stump|first=Eleonore|title=Wandering in Darkness: Narrative and the Problem of Suffering| publisher=Oxford University Press| location=N.Y. New York|year=2010|isbn=978-0-19-927742-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Free will defense===
{{see also|Theodicy and the Bible#Bible and free will theodicy}}
As an alternative to a theodicy, a defense may be offered as a response to the problem of evil. A defense attempts to show that God's existence is not made logically impossible by the existence of evil; it does not need to be true or plausible, merely logically possible.{{According to whom|date=October 2016}} American philosopher [[Alvin Plantinga]] offers [[Alvin Plantinga's free will defense|a free will defense]] which argues that human [[free will]] sufficiently explains the existence of evil while maintaining that God's existence remains logically possible.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath 1995, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that, if God's existence and the existence of evil are to be logically inconsistent, a premise must be provided which, if true, would make them inconsistent; as none has been provided, the existence of God and evil must be consistent. Free will furthers this argument by providing a premise which, in conjunction with the existence of evil, entails that God's existence remains consistent.&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga &amp; Sennett 1998, pp. 22–24&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents have argued this defense is discredited by the existence of non-human related evil such as droughts, tsunamis and malaria.&lt;ref name="Ehrman2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bart D. Ehrman|title=God's Problem: How the Bible Fails to Answer Our Most Important Question – Why We Suffer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uOCx_wcDkbYC|date=13 October 2009|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-174440-2|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmodicy and anthropodicy&lt;!--'Anthropodicy' redirects here--&gt;===
A cosmodicy attempts to justify the fundamental goodness of the [[universe]] in the face of [[evil]], and an anthropodicy attempts to justify the fundamental goodness of [[human nature]] in the face of the evils produced by humans.&lt;ref&gt;Carsten Meiner, Kristin Veel, eds., ''The Cultural Life of Catastrophes and Crises'' (Walter de Gruyter, 2012), 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering the relationship between theodicy and cosmodicy, Johannes van der Ven argued that the choice between theodicy and cosmodicy is a false dilemma.&lt;ref&gt;van der Ven 1989, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; Philip E. Devenish proposed what he described as "a nuanced view in which theodicy and cosmodicy are rendered complementary, rather than alternative concepts".&lt;ref&gt;Devenish 1992, pp. 5–23&lt;/ref&gt; Theologian J. Matthew Ashley described the relationship between theodicy, cosmodicy and anthropodicy:
{{quote|In classical terms, this is to broach the problem of theodicy: how to think about God in the face of the presence of suffering in God's creation. After God's dethronement as the subject of history, the question rebounds to the new subject of history: the human being. As a consequence, theodicy becomes anthropodicy – justifications of our faith in humanity as the subject of history, in the face of the suffering that is so inextricably woven into the history that humanity makes.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley 2010, pp. 870–902&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== Essential kenosis ====

Essential kenosis is a form of process theology, (also known as "open theism") that allows one to affirm that God is almighty, while simultaneously affirming that God cannot prevent genuine evil. Because out of love God necessarily gives freedom, agency, self-organization, natural processes, and law-like regularities to creation, God cannot override, withdraw, or fail to provide such capacities. Consequently, God is not culpable for failing to prevent genuine evil. Thomas Jay Oord's work explains this view most fully.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Uncontrolling Love of God: An Open and Relational Account of Providence|url = https://www.amazon.com/Uncontrolling-Love-God-Relational-Providence/dp/0830840842/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1447257309&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=uncontrolling+love+of+god|publisher = IVP Academic|date = 2015-12-06|isbn = 9780830840847|language = English|first = Thomas Jay|last = Oord}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Nature of Love: A Theology|url = https://www.amazon.com/Nature-Love-Dr-Thomas-Oord-ebook/dp/B003UD7QQ0/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1447257773&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=nature+of+love+oord|publisher = Chalice Press|date = 2010-04-10|language = English|first = Dr Thomas|last = Oord}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gijsbert van den Brink effectively refutes any view which says God has restricted His power because of his love saying it creates a "metaphysical dualism", and it would not alleviate God's responsibility for evil because God could have prevented evil by not restricting himself. Van den Brink goes on to elaborate an explanation of power and love within the Trinitarian view which equates power and love, and what he calls "the power of love" as representative of God's involvement in the struggle against evil.&lt;ref name="Gijsbert van den Brink"&gt;{{cite book| last="van den Brink"| first=Gijsbert| title=Almighty God: A Study on the Doctrine of Divine Omnipotence| publisher=Kok Pharos publishing House| location=Kampen, the Netherlands|year=1993|pages=263–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transduction in the [[nervous system]] typically refers to stimulus-alerting events wherein a physical stimulus is converted into an [[action potential]], which is transmitted along axons towards the central nervous system for integration.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41266312|title=Molecular cell biology|date=2000|publisher=W.H. Freeman|others=Lodish, Harvey F.|isbn=0716731363|edition= 4th|location=New York|oclc=41266312}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a step in the larger process of [[sensory processing]].

A receptor cell converts the energy in a stimulus into an electrical signal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Receptors are broadly split into two main categories: exteroceptors, which receive external sensory stimuli, and interoceptors, which receive internal sensory stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/exteroceptor|title=Definition of EXTEROCEPTOR|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/interoceptor|title=Definition of INTEROCEPTOR|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transduction and the senses==

===The visual system===
{{Main|Visual phototransduction}}
In the [[visual system]], sensory cells called [[Rod cell|rod]] and [[cone cell]]s in the [[retina]] convert the physical energy of [[light]] signals into [[electrical impulse]]s that travel to the [[brain]]. The light causes a conformational change in a protein called [[rhodopsin]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This conformational change sets in motion a series of molecular events that result in a reduction of the electrochemical gradient of the photoreceptor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The decrease in the electrochemical gradient causes a reduction in the electrical signals going to the brain. Thus, in this example, more light hitting the photoreceptor results in the transduction of a signal into fewer electrical impulses, effectively communicating that stimulus to the brain. A change in neurotransmitter release is mediated through a second messenger system. Note that the change in neurotransmitter release is by rods. Because of the change, a change in light intensity causes the response of the rods to be much slower than expected (for a process associated with the nervous system).&lt;ref name="Silverthorn, Dee Unglaub 2004"&gt;Silverthorn, Dee Unglaub. Human Physiology: An Integrated Approach, 3rd Edition, Inc, San Francisco, CA, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The auditory system===
{{Main|Neuronal encoding of sound}}
In the [[auditory system]], sound vibrations (mechanical energy) are transduced into electrical energy by hair cells in the inner ear. Sound vibrations from an object cause vibrations in air molecules, which in turn, vibrate the [[ear drum]]. The movement of the eardrum causes the bones of the middle ear (the [[ossicles]]) to vibrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koike|first=Takuji|last2=Wada|first2=Hiroshi|last3=Kobayashi|first3=Toshimitsu|title=Modeling of the human middle ear using the finite-element method|url=https://doi.org/10.1121/1.1451073|journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|volume=111|issue=3|pages=1306–1317|doi=10.1121/1.1451073}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/123956006|title=Anatomy and physiology of hearing for audiologists|last=W.|first=Clark, William|date=2008|publisher=Thomson Delmar|others=Ohlemiller, Kevin K.|isbn=9781401814441|location=Clifton Park, NY|oclc=123956006}}&lt;/ref&gt; These vibrations then pass into the [[cochlea]], the organ of hearing. Within the cochlea, the hair cells on the sensory epithelium of the [[organ of Corti]] bend and cause movement of the basilar membrane. The membrane undulates in different sized waves according to the frequency of the sound. Hair cells are then able to convert this movement (mechanical energy) into electrical signals (graded receptor potentials) which travel along auditory nerves to hearing centres in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Eatock, R. (2010). Auditory receptors and transduction. In E. Goldstein (Ed.), Encyclopedia of perception. (pp. 184-187). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc. doi: 10.4135/9781412972000.n63&lt;/ref&gt;

===The olfactory system===
{{Main|Olfactory transduction}}
In the [[olfactory system]], odorant molecules in the mucus bind to G-protein receptors on olfactory cells. The G-protein activates a downstream signalling cascade that causes increased level of cyclic-AMP (cAMP), which trigger neurotransmitter release.&lt;ref name="R&amp;R"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Ronnett, Gabriele V., &amp; Moon, Cheil.

===The gustatory system===
{{Main|Gustatory system}}
In the [[gustatory system]], perception of five primary [[Basic tastes|taste qualities]] (sweet, salty, sour, bitter and umami [savoriness] ) depends on taste transduction pathways, through taste receptor cells, G proteins, ion channels, and effector enzymes.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy A Gilbertson; Sami Damak; Robert F Margolskee, "The molecular physiology of taste transduction", Current Opinion in Neurobiology (August 2000), 10 (4), pg. 519-527&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=September 2018}}
'''Vulnerability''' refers to the inability (of a system or a unit) to withstand the effects of a hostile environment. A '''window of vulnerability''' ('''WOV''') is a time frame within which defensive measures are diminished, compromised or lacking.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The understanding of social and environmental vulnerability, as a methodological approach, involves the analysis of the risks and assets of disadvantaged groups, such as the elderly. The approach of vulnerability in itself brings great expectations of social policy and gerontological planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year=2011 | volume=17(69) | title=Social Vulnerability approach to investigate the social and environmental disadvantages. Its application in the study of elderly people | journal=Pap. poblac | page=151-185 | author1 = Sanchez-Gonzalez, D. | author2 = Egea-Jimenez, C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year=2015 |volume=60 | title=Physical-social environments and aging population from environmental gerontology and geography. Socio-spatial implications in Latin America" | journal=Revista de geografía Norte Grande | page=97-114 | author1 = Sanchez-Gonzalez, D | doi=10.4067/S0718-34022015000100006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common applications==
In relation to [[hazard]]s and [[disaster]]s, vulnerability is a concept that links the relationship that people have with their [[natural environment|environment]] to social forces and institutions and the cultural values that sustain and contest them. “The concept of vulnerability expresses the multi-dimensionality of disasters by focusing attention on the totality of relationships in a given social situation which constitute a condition that, in combination with environmental forces, produces a disaster”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Mapping Vulnerability: Disasters, Development and People | publisher=Earth scan | author=Bankoff, Greg| year=2004 | location=London|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also the extent to which changes could harm a system, or to which the community can be affected by the impact of a hazard or exposed to the possibility of being attacked or harmed, either physically or emotionally: "we were in a vulnerable position".

==Research==
Within the body of literature related to vulnerability, major research streams include questions of [[methodology]], such as: measuring and assessing vulnerability, including finding appropriate indicators for various aspects of vulnerability, up- and down scaling methods, and participatory methods.&lt;ref&gt;Villagran, Juan Carlos. "Vulnerability: A conceptual and methodological review." SOURCE. No. 2/2006. Bonn, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=May 2009}} Vulnerability research covers a complex, [[multidisciplinary]] field including [[Economic development|development]] and [[poverty]] studies, [[public health]], [[climate]] studies, [[security]] studies, [[engineering]], geography, political [[ecology]], and disaster [[risk management]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rumpf|first=Clemens M.|last2=Lewis|first2=Hugh G.|last3=Atkinson|first3=Peter M.|date=2017-03-27|title=Population vulnerability models for asteroid impact risk assessment|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/maps.12861|journal=Meteoritics &amp; Planetary Science|language=en|volume=52|issue=6|pages=1082–1102|doi=10.1111/maps.12861|issn=1086-9379}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Types==
===Social===
{{Main article|Social vulnerability}}
In its sense, social vulnerability is one dimension of vulnerability to multiple [[stressor]]s (agent responsible for stress) and [[Acute stress reaction|shock]]s, including [[abuse]], [[social exclusion]] and [[natural hazards]]. Social vulnerability refers to the inability of people, organizations, and societies to withstand adverse impacts from multiple stressors to which they are exposed. These impacts are due in part to characteristics inherent in social interactions, institutions, and systems of cultural values.&lt;ref&gt;Luis Flores Ballesteros. "What determines a disaster?" 54 Pesos May. 2008:54 Pesos 11 Sep 2008. http://54pesos.org/2008/09/11/what-determines-a-disaster/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320211421/http://54pesos.org/2008/09/11/what-determines-a-disaster/ |date=2012-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Daniel R. Curtis, 'Pre-industrial societies and strategies for the exploitation of resources.

In this respect, there is a need to place an increased emphasis on assets and entitlements for understanding ‘catastrophe’ as opposed to solely the strength or severity of shocks.&lt;ref&gt;https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/57a08d11e5274a31e000160c/24Prowse.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive===
{{Main article|Cognitive vulnerability}}
A cognitive vulnerability, in [[cognitive psychology]], is an erroneous belief, [[cognitive bias]], or pattern of thought that is believed to predispose the individual to psychological problems.&lt;ref name = "black"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author-last=Riskind|author-first=John H.|author2-last=Black|author2-first=David|title=Cognitive Vulnerability|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Cognitive Behavior Therapy|editor=Freeman, Arthur |editor2=Felgoise, Stephanie H.|year=2005|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=9781429411738|pages=122–26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yizTVUCYy4EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Encyclopedia+of+Cognitive+Behavior+Therapy#v=onepage&amp;q=Cognitive%20Vulnerability&amp;f=false |display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is in place before the symptoms of psychological disorders start to appear, such as high neuroticism,&lt;ref name="NeuroticismMA"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jeronimus B.F.|author2=Kotov, R.|author3=Riese, H.|author4=Ormel, J.| year = 2016 | title = Neuroticism's prospective association with mental disorders halves after adjustment for baseline symptoms and psychiatric history, but the adjusted association hardly decays with time: a meta-analysis on 59 longitudinal/prospective studies with 443 313 participants | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 46 | issue = 14 | pages = 2883–2906 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0033291716001653 | doi=10.1017/S0033291716001653 | pmid=27523506}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after the individual encounters a stressful experience, the cognitive vulnerability shapes a [[maladaptation|maladaptive]] response that may lead to a psychological disorder.&lt;ref name = "black"/&gt; In [[psychopathology]], cognitive vulnerability is constructed from schema models, hopelessness models, and attachment theory.&lt;ref name = "rick"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ingram|first=Rick|title=Origins of Cognitive Vulnerability to Depression|journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research|volume=27|issue=1|date=February 2003|pages=77–88|issn=	0147-5916|url=http://www.people.ku.edu/~reingram/PDFs/origins.pdf|doi=10.1023/a:1022590730752}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Attentional bias]] is one mechanism leading to faulty cognitive bias that leads to cognitive vulnerability.

===Military===
{{see also|Paul Nitze}}
In military terminology, vulnerability is a subset of [[survivability]], the others being susceptibility and recoverability. Vulnerability is defined in various ways depending on the nation and service arm concerned, but in general it refers to the near-instantaneous effects of a weapon attack. In aviation it is defined as the inability of an aircraft to withstand the damage caused by the man-made hostile environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Fundamentals of Aircraft Combat Survivability Analysis and Design, 2nd Edition | publisher=AIAA Education Series | author=Ball, Robert | year=2003 | pages=603 | isbn=1-56347-582-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some definitions, recoverability (damage control, firefighting, restoration of capability) is included in vulnerability. Some military services develop their own concept of vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ausairpower.net/Warship-Hits.html|title=Warship Vulnerability|first=Kopp,|last=Carlo|date=5 July 2005|website=ausairpower.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invulnerability&lt;!--'Invulnerability' redirects here--&gt;==
'''Invulnerability'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is a common feature found in science fiction and fantasy, in particular in [[superhero fiction]], as depicted commonly in novels, [[comic book]]s and [[video game]]s. In such stories, it is a quality that makes a character impervious to pain, damage or loss of health. 

In video games, it can be found in the form of "[[power-up]]s" or [[cheats#In video games|cheats]]; when activated via cheats, it is often referred to as "[[glossary of video game terms#God mode|god mode]]". Generally, it does not protect the player from certain instant-death hazards, most notably "bottomless" pits from which, even if the player were to survive the fall, they would be unable to escape. As a rule, invulnerability granted by power-ups is temporary, and wears off after a set amount of time, while invulnerability cheats, once activated, remain in effect until deactivated, or the end of the level is reached. Depending on the game in question, invulnerability to damage may or may not protect the player from non-damage effects, such as being immobilized or sent flying.{{fact|date=September 2018}}
	
In [[comic book]]s, some superheroes are considered invulnerable, though this usually only applies up to a certain level (e.g. [[Superman]] is invulnerable to physical attacks from normal people but not to the extremely powerful attacks of [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] or those at his level or higher). In the [[manga]], webcomic and [[anime]] series ''[[One-Punch Man]]'', for example, the main protagonist [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Saitama|Saitama]] is completely immune to all kinds of attacks, whether it be blunt attacks, environmental-based attacks (like heat or cold), slashing attacks or pressure-point based attacks, and unharmed by physical laws.{{fact|date=September 2018}}

In mythology, talismans, charms, and amulets were created by magic users for the purpose of making the wearer immune to injury from both mystic and mundane weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/livesnecromance04godwgoog|title=Lives of the Necromancers|author=William Godwin|year=1876|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World energy resources''' are the estimated maximum capacity for energy production given all available resources on [[Earth]]. They can be divided by type into [[fossil fuel]], [[nuclear fuel]] and [[renewable resource]]s.

== Fossil fuel ==
{{Main article|Fossil fuel}}

Remaining reserves of fossil fuel are estimated as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2008/STAGING/local_assets/2010_downloads/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2010.pdf  Proven energy reserves, BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

{|class="wikitable"
!width="100"|'''   Fuel   '''
!width="150"|'''Proven energy reserves in [[Zetta-|Z]][[Joule|J]] (end of 2009)'''
|-
|   Coal  || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;19.8
|-
|   Gas   || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;36.4
|-
|   Oil   || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;8.9
|}

These are the proven energy reserves; real reserves may be up to a factor 4 larger. Significant uncertainty exists for these numbers. Estimating the remaining fossil fuels on the planet depends on a detailed understanding of Earth's crust. While modern drilling technology makes it possible to drill wells in up to 3&amp;nbsp;km of water to verify the exact composition of the geology, one half of the [[ocean]] is deeper than 3&amp;nbsp;km, leaving about a third of the planet beyond the reach of detailed analysis.

In addition to uncertainty in real reserves, there is significant uncertainty in technological and economical factors that impact what percentage of reserves can be recovered gainfully. In general the easiest to reach deposits are the first extracted. Factors affecting the cost of exploiting the remaining reserves include the accessibility of fossil deposits, the level of sulfur and other pollutants in the oil and the coal, transportation costs, and societal instability in producing regions.

===Coal===
{{Main article|Coal#World_coal_reserves|l1=World coal reserves}}
Coal is the most abundant and burned fossil fuel. This was the fuel that launched the industrial revolution and has continued to grow in use; China, which already has many of the world's most polluted cities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,501031124-543833,00.html The Middle Landfill]&lt;/ref&gt; was in 2007 building about two coal-fired power plants every week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6769743.stm  China building more power plants]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/041707/opi_opinion1.shtml COAL: Scrubbing its future]&lt;/ref&gt; Coal is the fastest growing fossil fuel and its large reserves would make it a popular candidate to meet the energy demand of the global community, short of global warming concerns and other pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/11/business/worldbusiness/11chinacoal.html Pollution From Chinese Coal Casts a Global Shadow] accessed 14 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[International Energy Agency]] the proven reserves of coal are around 909 billion tonnes, which could sustain the current production rate for 155 years,&lt;ref&gt;IEA (2006), p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; although at a 5% growth per annum this would be reduced to 45 years, or until 2051. With the [[Fischer–Tropsch process]] it is possible to make liquid fuels such as diesel and jet fuel from coal. In the United States, 49% of electricity generation comes from burning coal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epa/epat1p1.html EIA sources of electricity]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural gas===
{{Main article|Natural gas}}
Natural gas is a widely available fossil fuel with estimated 850 000&amp;nbsp;km³ in recoverable reserves and at least that much more using enhanced methods to release shale gas.  Improvements in technology and wide exploration led to a major increase in recoverable natural gas reserves as shale fracking methods were developed.  At present usage rates, natural gas could supply most of the world's energy needs for between 100 and 250 years, depending on increase in consumption over time.

===Oil===
{{See also|Oil reserves|Peak oil}}
It is estimated that there may be 57&amp;nbsp;ZJ of oil reserves on Earth (although estimates vary from a low of 8&amp;nbsp;ZJ,&lt;ref name=EIA&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[Statistical Review of World Energy 2009]], [[BP]] | url = http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2008/STAGING/local_assets/2009_downloads/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2009.xls#'Primary%20Energy%20-%20Consumption'!A1 | title = Consumption by fuel, 1965 - 2008 | format = XLS | date = July 31, 2006 | accessdate = 2009-10-24 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090708203819/http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2008/STAGING/local_assets/2009_downloads/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2009.xls#'Primary%20Energy%20-%20Consumption'!A1 | archivedate = July 8, 2009 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of currently proven and recoverable reserves, to a maximum of 110&amp;nbsp;ZJ&lt;ref name="Oil Gas Industry Stats"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.oiljobsource.com/oil-gas-industry-statistics.html|title=Oil Gas Industry Stats| publisher= oiljobsource.com| accessdate=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;) consisting of available, but not necessarily recoverable reserves, and including optimistic estimates for unconventional sources such as [[tar sands|oil sands]] and [[oil shale]]. Current consensus among the 18 recognized estimates of supply profiles is that the peak of extraction will occur in 2020 at the rate of 93-million barrels per day (mbd). Current oil consumption is at the rate of 0.18&amp;nbsp;ZJ per year (31.1 billion barrels) or 85 mbd.

There is growing concern that [[peak oil|peak oil production]] may be reached in the near future, resulting in severe [[Oil price increases since 2003|oil price increases]].&lt;ref name="wsj111907golddavis"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also theories that peak of the global oil production may occur in as little as 2–3 years. The ASPO predicts peak year to be in 2010. Some other theories present the view that it has already taken place in 2005. World crude oil production (including lease condensates) according to [[US EIA]] data decreased from a peak of 73.720 mbd in 2005 to 73.437 in 2006, 72.981 in 2007, and 73.697 in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/ipsr/t41d.xls International Petroleum Monthly] Retrieved 10 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; According to peak oil theory, increasing production will lead to a more rapid collapse of production in the future, while decreasing production will lead to a slower decrease, as the [[Normal distribution|bell-shaped curve]] will be spread out over more years.

In a stated goal of increasing oil prices to $75/barrel, which had fallen from a high of $147 to a low of $40, [[OPEC]] announced decreasing production by 2.2 mbd beginning 1 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7786456.stm Opec agrees record oil output cut] retrieved 21 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainability===
Political considerations over the security of supplies, environmental concerns related to [[global warming]] and [[sustainability]] are expected to move the world's energy consumption away from fossil fuels. The concept of [[peak oil]] shows that about half of the available petroleum resources have been produced, and predicts a decrease of production.

A government moves away from fossil fuels would most likely create economic pressure through [[emissions trading|carbon emissions]] and [[green tax]]ation. Some countries are taking action as a result of the [[Kyoto Protocol]], and further steps in this direction are proposed. For example, the [[European Commission]] has proposed that the [[energy policy of the European Union]] should set a binding target of increasing the level of renewable energy in the EU's overall mix from less than 7% in 2007 to 20% by 2020.&lt;ref name="roadmap21"&gt;{{cite web | title = Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council: Renewable Energy Roadmap: Renewable Energies in the 21st century; building a sustainable future - COM(2006) 848 | url = http://ec.europa.eu/energy/energy_policy/doc/03_renewable_energy_roadmap_en.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = Commission of the European Communities | date = 10 January 2007 | accessdate = 2007-01-27 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070128104118/http://ec.europa.eu/energy/energy_policy/doc/03_renewable_energy_roadmap_en.pdf | archivedate = 28 January 2007 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The antithesis of sustainability is a disregard for limits, commonly referred to as the Easter Island Effect, which is the concept of being unable to develop sustainability, resulting in the depletion of natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://strategy.sauder.ubc.ca/nemetz/jibe.pdf Basic Concepts of Sustainable Development for Business Students]&lt;/ref&gt; Some estimate that, assuming current consumption rates, current oil reserves could be completely depleted by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Proved1 Reserves of Oil and Natural Gas, Most Recent Estimates|url=http://www.eia.gov/international/reserves.html|publisher=Energy Information Administration|accessdate=14 November 2016|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217151346/http://www.eia.gov/international/reserves.html|archivedate=17 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear energy===
{{See also|Nuclear fuel}}
The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] estimates the remaining uranium resources to be equal to 2500&amp;nbsp;ZJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Global Ur Resources to Meet Projected Demand: Latest Edition of "Red Book" Predicts Consistent Supply Up to 2025| url= http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2006/uranium_resources.html | date = 2 June 2006 | publisher = International Atomic Energy Agency | accessdate= 2007-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assumes the use of [[breeder reactor]]s, which are able to create more [[fissile]] material than they consume. [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] estimated currently proved economically recoverable uranium deposits for once-through fuel cycles reactors to be only 2 ZJ. The ultimately recoverable uranium is estimated to be 17 ZJ for once-through reactors and 1000 ZJ with reprocessing and fast breeder reactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Nakicenovic, Nebojsa| title= IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios |url= http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc/emission/071.htm| publisher = Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change | accessdate=2007-02-20|display-authors=etal}} [[Special Report on Emissions Scenarios]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Resources and technology do not constrain the capacity of nuclear power to contribute to meeting the energy demand for the 21st century. However, political and environmental concerns about [[nuclear safety]] and [[radioactive waste]] started to limit the growth of this energy supply at the end of last century, particularly due to a number of [[List of civilian nuclear accidents|nuclear accidents]]. Concerns about [[nuclear proliferation]] (especially with [[plutonium]] produced by breeder reactors) mean that the development of nuclear power by countries such as [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iran]] and [[Syria]] is being actively discouraged by the international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7364269.stm |title=Syria 'had covert nuclear scheme' |newspaper=BBC News |date=2008-04-25 |accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although at the beginning of the 21st century uranium is the primary nuclear fuel worldwide, others such as thorium and hydrogen had been under investigation since the middle of the 20th century.

Thorium reserves significantly exceed those of uranium, and of course hydrogen is abundant. It is also considered by many to be easier to obtain than [[uranium]]. While [[uranium mines]] are enclosed underground and thus very dangerous for the miners, [[thorium]] is taken from open pits, and is estimated to be roughly three times as abundant as uranium in the Earth's crust.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2015/01/16/thorium-future-nuclear-energy/#.VPfjkXbFo1w&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1960s, numerous facilities throughout the world have burned [[Thorium]].

===Nuclear fusion===
Alternatives for energy production through fusion of hydrogen has been under investigation since the 1950s.  No materials can withstand the temperatures required to ignite the fuel, so it must be confined by methods which use no materials.  Magnetic and inertial confinement are the main alternatives ([[Cadarache]], [[Inertial confinement fusion]]) both of which are hot research topics in the early years of the 21st century.

[[Fusion power]] is the process driving the sun and other stars. It generates large quantities of heat by fusing the nuclei of hydrogen or helium isotopes, which may be derived from seawater. The heat can theoretically be harnessed to generate electricity. The temperatures and pressures needed to sustain fusion make it a very difficult process to control. Fusion is theoretically able to supply vast quantities of energy, with relatively little pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efda.org/fusion_energy/safety_and_the_environment.htm Fusion Energy: Safety] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720021002/http://www.efda.org/fusion_energy/safety_and_the_environment.htm |date=2011-07-20 }} European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA).  2006.  Retrieved on 2007-04-03&lt;/ref&gt; Although both the United States and the European Union, along with other countries, are supporting fusion research (such as investing in the [[ITER]] facility), according to one report, inadequate research has stalled progress in fusion research for the past 20&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fire.pppl.gov/us_fusion50yr_dean.pdf Fifty years of U.S. fusion research - An overview of programs st]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renewable resources==
{{Main article|Renewable resource}}
Renewable resources are available each year, unlike non-renewable resources, which are eventually depleted. A simple comparison is a coal mine and a forest. While the forest could be depleted, if it is managed it represents a continuous supply of energy, vs. the coal mine, which once has been exhausted is gone. Most of earth's available energy resources are renewable resources. Renewable resources account for more than 93 percent of total U.S. energy reserves. Annual renewable resources were multiplied times thirty years for comparison with non-renewable resources. In other words, if all non-renewable resources were uniformly exhausted in 30 years, they would only account for 7 percent of available resources each year, if all available renewable resources were developed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/pub_summaries/renew_es.html Renewable Resources in the U.S. Electricity Supply]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar energy===
{{Main article|Solar energy}}
Renewable energy sources are even larger than the traditional fossil fuels and in theory can easily supply the world's energy needs. 89&amp;nbsp;PW&lt;ref name="Tester 2005"&gt;{{cite book | last = Tester | first = Jefferson W. | authorlink = | title = Sustainable Energy: Choosing Among Options | publisher = The MIT Press | date = 2005 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-262-20153-4 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Page numbers are needed on all book sources, pls fill in for Tester --&gt; of solar power falls on the planet's surface. While it is not possible to capture all, or even most, of this energy, capturing less than 0.02% would be enough to meet the current energy needs. Barriers to further solar generation include the high price of making [[solar cells]] and reliance on weather patterns to generate electricity. Also, current solar generation does not produce electricity at night, which is a particular problem in high northern and southern latitude countries; energy demand is highest in winter, while availability of solar energy is lowest. This could be overcome by buying power from countries closer to the equator during winter months, and may also be addressed with technological developments such as the development of inexpensive energy storage. Globally, solar generation is the fastest growing source of energy, seeing an annual average growth of 35% over the past few years. [[Japan]], [[Europe]], [[China]], [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Solar power in India|India]] are the major growing investors in solar energy. Solar power's share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of 2014 was 1%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/REN12-GSR2015_Onlinebook_low1.pdf pg31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wind power===
{{Main article|Wind power}}
The available wind energy estimates range from 300&amp;nbsp;TW to 870&amp;nbsp;TW.&lt;ref name="Tester 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gcep.stanford.edu/research/exergycharts.html Exergy Flow Charts]&lt;/ref&gt; Using the lower estimate, just 5% of the available wind energy would supply the current worldwide energy needs. Most of this wind energy is available over the open ocean. The [[ocean]]s cover 71% of the planet and wind tends to blow more strongly over open water because there are fewer obstructions.

===Wave and tidal power===
{{Main article|Wave power|Tidal power}}
At the end of 2005, 0.3&amp;nbsp;GW of electricity was produced by [[tidal power]].&lt;ref name="Renewables2006"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/download/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century | title = Renewables, Global Status Report 2006 | date = 2006 | accessdate = 2007-04-03 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110718181410/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/download/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the [[tidal forces]] created by the Moon (68%) and the Sun (32%), and the Earth's relative rotation with respect to Moon and Sun, there are fluctuating tides. These tidal fluctuations result in [[dissipation]] at an average rate of about 3.7 TW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0967-0637(98)00070-3 | volume=45 | title=Abyssal recipes II: energetics of tidal and wind mixing | year=1998 | journal=Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers | pages=1977–2010 | last1 = Munk | first1 = Walter| bibcode=1998DSRI...45.1977M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another physical limitation is the energy available in the tidal fluctuations of the oceans, which is about 0.6 EJ ([[exa]][[joule]]).&lt;ref&gt;Marchuk, G.I. and Kagan, B.A. (1989) "Dynamics of Ocean Tides", Kluwer Academic Publishers, {{ISBN|978-90-277-2552-3}}. See page 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Note this is only a tiny fraction of the total [[rotational energy|rotational energy of the Earth]]. Without forcing, this energy would be dissipated (at a dissipation rate of 3.7 TW) in about four [[Half|semi]]-[[Day|diurnal]] tide periods. So, dissipation plays a significant role in the tidal dynamics of the oceans. Therefore, this limits the available tidal energy to around 0.8 TW (20% of the dissipation rate) in order not to disturb the tidal dynamics too much. {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Waves are derived from wind, which is in turn derived from solar energy, and at each conversion there is a drop of about two orders of magnitude in available energy. The total power of waves that wash against the earth's shores adds up to 3 TW.&lt;ref&gt;Tester, et al., p. 593&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geothermal===
{{Main article|Geothermal power}}
Estimates of exploitable worldwide [[geothermal power|geothermal energy]] resources vary considerably, depending on assumed investments in technology and exploration and guesses about geological formations. According to a 1999 study, it was thought that this might amount to between 65 and 138&amp;nbsp;GW of electrical generation capacity 'using enhanced technology'.&lt;ref&gt;

A 2006 report by [[MIT]] that took into account the use of [[Enhanced Geothermal System]]s (EGS) concluded that it would be affordable to generate 100&amp;nbsp;GWe (gigawatts of electricity) or more by 2050, just in the [[United States]], for a maximum investment of 1 billion US dollars in research and development over 15 years.&lt;ref name="INEL"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[MIT]] | title = The Future of Geothermal Energy | url = http://geothermal.inel.gov/publications/future_of_geothermal_energy.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate=2007-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MIT report calculated the world's total EGS resources to be over 13&amp;nbsp;YJ, of which over 200&amp;nbsp;ZJ would be extractable, with the potential to increase this to over 2&amp;nbsp;YJ with technology improvements - sufficient to provide all the world's energy needs for several [[Millennium|millennia]].&lt;ref name="INEL" /&gt; The total heat content of the Earth is 13,000,000 YJ.&lt;ref name="GEO" /&gt;

===Biomass===
{{Main article|biomass|biofuel}}
Production of biomass and biofuels are growing industries as interest in sustainable fuel sources is growing. Utilizing waste products avoids a [[food vs fuel]] trade-off, and burning [[Methane|methane gas]] reduces greenhouse gas emissions, because even though it releases carbon dioxide, carbon dioxide is 23 times less of a greenhouse gas than is methane. Biofuels represent a sustainable partial replacement for fossil fuels, but their net impact on [[greenhouse gas]] emissions depends on the agricultural practices used to grow the plants used as feedstock to create the fuels. While it is widely believed that biofuels can be carbon-neutral, there is evidence that biofuels produced by current farming methods are substantial net carbon emitters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Rosenthal | first=Elisabeth | title=Biofuels Deemed a Greenhouse Threat | newspaper=[[New York Times]] | date=2008-02-08 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/08/science/earth/08wbiofuels.html}} Registration required.
