The '''Arctic Winter Games Arena''' is a 2,500-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Iqaluit]], [[Nunavut]], Canada. It opened to the public in October 2001.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nnsl.com/frames/newspapers/2010-10/oct18_10awg.html&lt;/ref&gt; This arena was initially constructed to house the hockey and speed skating events of the 2002 [[Arctic Winter Games]], but it is now used as a youth centre and to host large community events.

The venue hosted [[CBC Television]]'s [[Hockey Day in Canada]] in 2003,&lt;ref name="Hockey night in Canada"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nunatsiaq.com/archives/nunavut030221/news/features/30221_02.html|title=Hockey Day in Iqaluit|last=Murphy|first=Kirsten|date=2003-02-21|work=Nunatsiaq News|accessdate=2009-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[White Stripes]] concert in 2007.&lt;ref name="white stripes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/230218|title=Iqaluit welcomes Stripes with open arms|authorlink=Ben Rayner|last=Rayner|first=Ben|date=2007-07-28|work=Toronto Star|accessdate=2009-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arena was also site to four professional wrestling events, featuring WWE superstars [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]] and [[Gail Kim]], as well as [[Tracy Brooks]], [[Robert Roode]] and [[Rhino (wrestler)|Rhino]] in 2008.

The surface of the arena had become unusable (for ice) after a portion the floor sank in 2006,&lt;ref name="floor fails"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nnsl.com/northern-news-services/stories/papers/feb9_09ah.html |title=Iqaluit looks ahead |last=Zarate |first=Gabriel |work=Northern News Services |accessdate=2009-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714190449/http://nnsl.com/northern-news-services/stories/papers/feb9_09ah.html |archivedate=2011-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, on August 18, 2009, $2.2&amp;nbsp;million was allocated by the [[Government of Canada]] to repair the surface.&lt;ref name="2mil renovation"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/682491|title=$50M for Arctic development|last=Campion-Smith|first=Bruce|date=2009-08-18|work=[[Toronto Star]]|accessdate=2009-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biribol''' is a sport, which resembles an aquatic variation of [[volleyball]]. It has originated in Brazil, in the city of [[Birigüi]], in the 1960s by Prof. Dario Miguel Pedro. It showed up as a group game and as an alternative to the practice and the learning of swimming. It is the newest sports modality in Brazil and the only group sport genuinely Brazilian, born and instituted inside the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = História do Biribol |url = http://www.educarede.org.br/educa/index.cfm?pg=galeria_de_arte.detalhe_texto&amp;id_galeria=32&amp;id_arte=1635&amp;id_comunidade=1 |author = Montoro, Patricia |date = 2005-06-14 |publisher = EducaRede |accessdate = 2008-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Field==
[[File:Biribol field.jpg|right|thumb|500px|Biribol field]]
Its game is played inside a pool which size is 8m length, 4m width and 1.30m depth (the depth must be this for the entire pool) with a net in the middle of the pool with 2.62m high for the male and with 2.40m high for the female practice.
The game space is constituted by 7m high measured from the surface of the water. There is also an attack area, delimited by a line which cross the pool by 1.25m from where the net is in each side. There are lines that delimit the service area, by the end of the pool, 1m from its length limit and other 0.8m from its width limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Instalações e Equipamentos |url = http://www.biribol.com/interna.asp?id=19 |work = Liga Nacional de Biribol |accessdate = 2008-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==

===Game ball===
The ball is specially crafted ball similar to that of [[water polo]] but with a smaller diameter. The ball weights approximately 100 grams more than the volleyball one and employs a "super grip" surface technology. The official game is played with four players on each side, but there is also the doubles modality, with two players on each side. Biribol is a highly recommended sport for working all muscle groups with practically no injury risks due to its no contact, low impact on joints nature. Biribol is also suited for all ages and genders, and is recommended for people with minor chronic injuries that feel discomfort or pain while playing other sports.

===Game play===
Matches are decided in best-of-three or best-of-five sets of 21 points, when the matches go up to the last set this set is disputed up to the 20th point instead, and a team needs at least two points of advantage in any circumstance to win a set. So if a 21-points set is drawn at 20x20, the match is extended to 22 points, and so on. 
[[Image:Biriball.jpg|left|thumb|300px|A practice of Biribol in [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]]]] 
The ball can be touched with any part of the player's body, with open or closed hands. The pool's inside borders are neutral, meaning the ball is normally in play after touching them, points are scored when the ball hits the water in the opponents' side or the opponent team commits a fault. As in volleyball, each team can contact the ball no more than three times before the ball crosses the net, while consecutive contacts must be made by different players - except for contacts while blocking, which are not counted. Players also cannot touch the net or they commit a fault and a point is awarded to the opponent team. Unique to the sport is that there is no penetration under ''and'' over the net - it is even allowed to block a set being executed in the opponents' side -, the possibility of blocking serves and how there is no lifting (carrying) faults during spikes.

With its fast moving, highly accurate ball and 'closed quarters' action, Biribol is also an extremely competitive sport and enjoys a popularity similar to or greater than [[water volleyball]] in southern Brazil. There is currently a Brazilian National League &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Brazilian National Biriball League |url = http://www.biribol.com/ |work = Liga Nacional de Biribol |accessdate = 2009-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; with teams from [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], [[Minas Gerais]], [[Mato Grosso do Sul]], [[Goias]] and [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]]. There are many stages held in different cities of the country, and the Brazilian champion is known in the end of the year, after computing all points of the season. The sport has been reckoned officially in the state of [[São Paulo]], and grows rapidly in the country.

'''Cardines Field''' is a [[baseball]] stadium located at 20 America’s Cup Avenue in [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. It is believed to be one of the oldest [[Baseball park|ballparks]] in the [[United States]] and has been called "a small urban gem of a ballpark".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery Staats quoted in ''Field of Dreams''&lt;/ref&gt; The field serves as a buffer between the residential and commercial sections of an older part of Newport. The oddly shaped outfield fence and dimensions are created by the close proximity of residential housing, while the spectator side of the park is contained by [[Route 238 (Rhode Island)|America's Cup Avenue]] and West Marlborough Street.&lt;ref&gt;Wikimapia&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally called '''Basin Field''', references to the field can be found as early as 1893.  At that time, the property was used by local [[Rail transport|railroads]] as a drainage and supply basin for steam engines.  Complaints from neighbors about the [[stagnant water]] and [[mosquito]]es prompted the drainage of the basin area, permitting baseball to be played.  A local historical debate continues as to whether baseball was played prior to 1900, making Cardines one of the oldest existing ballparks in the country, or if play didn't begin until 1908, the earliest documented proof of [[stadium]] construction.

The Basin Field ballpark was later renamed for Bernardo Cardines, a Newport baseball player who was Newport's first citizen to die in [[World War I]].  Today, the ballpark continues to be the home of the historic [[George Donnelly Sunset League|Sunset League]], as well as the [[Newport Gulls]] of the [[New England Collegiate Baseball League]].

==History==
Built for unofficial [[sandlot baseball]] games by railroad workers from the adjacent [[Old Colony Railroad|Old Colony Division of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Line]], the field hosted many barnstorming all-stars, including [[Negro League]] teams like the [[Baltimore Elite Giants]], [[Boston Royal Giants]] and the [[New York Black Yankees]]. [[Satchel Paige]] once played at Cardines.  The original backstop dates back to as early as 1908, when the city organized its first six-team league at the park.&lt;ref name=fod&gt;Field of Dreams&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Cardinesteamusa.jpg|thumb|left|Team USA visits the Newport Gulls in 2004]] --&gt;

Cardines Field is a smaller cousin of other notable ballparks of that era, such as [[Ebbets Field]], [[Fenway Park]] and [[Wrigley Field]], with a stone facade and wooden bleachers with unique outfield angles.  The exterior's elliptical arches reflect the facade of the original [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]].&lt;ref name=fod /&gt;

In 1936, the city of Newport took over ownership. Stone and concrete bleachers were built along the third-base line by the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) in 1936-1937.  The plaque at the entrance that reads "1937" refers to this date.&lt;ref name=fod /&gt; The current grandstand was built by the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] following the devastating hurricane of 1938.  The distinctive curving grandstand section behind home plate was built in 1939.&lt;ref name=fod /&gt; Over the coming decades, the park continued to grow through construction projects to increase capacity, eventually creating the patchwork, overlapping stadium seen today.

During [[World War II]], many former professional ball players were stationed at [[Naval Station Newport]]. Many of these players, including [[Yogi Berra]], [[Phil Rizzuto]], and [[Bob Feller]]&lt;ref name=fod /&gt; participated in Newport's [[George Donnelly Sunset League]], an amateur league formed in 1919. Wednesday night all-star games drew thousands and required construction of temporary bleachers in the outfield. The Sunset League was named because games began at 5:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. and ended at dusk, prior to the addition of lights at the park. It is the oldest continuous amateur baseball league in the country.  With black players such as [[Larry Doby]] and [[Luke Easter (baseball player)|Luke Easter]], the Sunset League was integrated several years before [[Jackie Robinson]] joined the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947.&lt;ref name=fod /&gt; The league continues today as key chapter of Cardines' history.

==Current tenants==

The [[George Donnelly Sunset League|Sunset League]] still plays a full schedule throughout the summer, though the park's lighting system now permits games to go well beyond dusk.  The field is home to baseball games for [[Rogers High School (Newport, Rhode Island)|Rogers High School]], Newport's [[Babe Ruth League]], the historic Sunset League, Newport's [[American Legion]] team, [[Salve Regina University]], [[Naval Academy Preparatory School]] and the [[Newport Gulls]] of the [[New England Collegiate Baseball League]].   In the January 18, 2004 edition of [[Baseball America]], Cardines Field was chosen as one of the top five locations in America to play college summer baseball, in response to the jump in reputation the Gulls brought to the park.

[[Image:Cardinesfield.jpg|thumb|Cardines undergoing pregame preparation on a Gulls game night.]]
While most teams playing at Cardines average attendance in the dozens or, at most, a few hundred per game, the [[Newport Gulls]], since moving to Newport in [[2001 NECBL season|2001]], have helped to bring the field back to its former glory days of the mid-20th century, attracting hundreds of fans every night. During the [[2004 NECBL season|2004 regular and playoff seasons]] alone, the Gulls attracted over 50,000 fans through just 26 home games, often with sellout crowds.  Following the [[2010 NECBL season|2010 season]], the Gulls set a team and NECBL record for regular season home attendance, totaling 45,683 after 21 games.&lt;ref name=2013media&gt;{{cite book | last =Lima | first =Nicholas | title =Newport Gulls 2013 Media Guide | publisher =Newport Gulls | location =[[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport, RI]] | page =64 | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renovations==
Renovation work began in 2000 with funds from a matching $500,000 grant from the state [[RI DEM|Department of Environmental Management]] and the formation of the Friends of Cardines Field Foundation.  In recent years, the grandstands, concession operation, and bathrooms have been renovated as part of the project, along with the addition of a state-of-the-art field lighting system.  The winter of 2005 - 2006 saw the entire outfield and infield replaced among other improvements, including the addition of a fully functional drainage system and new outfield fence, all at the cost of an additional half million dollars.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927195721/http://www.eastbayri.com/story/318548899310862.php]

The Newport Gulls also have necessitated the expansion of concession equipment, in addition to the renovation of a team office, storage rooms, souvenir stand, ticket booth, scoreboard, and public address system, much of which has been covered by the ongoing restoration project led by the city's Parks and Recreation Department, the Gulls former ownership, and [[Roger Williams University]] Professor Jeffery Staats.  The most recent improvements have been to upgrade the stadium's broadcasting abilities, with the addition of high speed Internet and phone lines, camera positions, and a control room below the pressbox for use by the Tigers TV Crew, the volunteer production crew who work with the Gulls to produce games.

The park today has changed drastically in upkeep and appearance from that of the recent past.  As early as a decade ago, some in the city of Newport had proposed for a then dilapidated Cardines Field to be demolished in order to expand parking in the cramped downtown area, a mere block in each direction from the waterfront to the West, commercial and tourist center to the South, and world-famous historical district to the East.

Future projects at Cardines include: concluding outfield fence replacement via a state grant, widening and lengthening of the hockey-style side-by-side dugouts, the additions of a locker room and an umpire's room, and further restoration of bleachers, framework, trim, and other facets.  The removal of a large, rundown private warehouse which makes up the right field fouline has been discussed for some time, though no official plans have been announced.

'''Hesketh Park''' is a [[cricket]] ground in [[Dartford]] in [[Kent]]. The ground is the home of [[Dartford Cricket Club]], one of the oldest cricket clubs in the United Kingdom. The ground was established at the beginning of the 20th century and has been used as a [[first-class cricket]] venue by [[Kent County Cricket Club]].

The ground is located around {{convert|1|mi|km}} south-east of Dartford town centre and is one f the few open spaces which remain on what was once the [[Dartford Brent]]. The [[A296 road]] runs along the western side of the ground with the [[A225 road]] to the south and the [[Dartford Crossing|A282 Dartford Crossing approach road]] running {{convert|250|m|mi}} east of the ground.&lt;ref name=osx162&gt;Explorer Map 162 – Greenwich &amp; Gravesend, [[Ordnance Survey]], 2015-09-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment==
Cricket has been played at Dartford since at least the early 18th century and Dartford Cricket Club is one of the oldest established cricket clubs in England.&lt;ref name=dcchistory&gt;[http://www.dartfordcc.co.uk/our-history/club-history Our history: Cricket in Dartford], [[Dartford Cricket Club]]. Retrieved 2017-11-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Cricket was first played on [[Dartford Brent]], an area of common land to the east of the town on which the modern Hesketh Park ground is situated. The earliest known match between two county sides took place on the Brent in 1709 with a [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent team]] playing [[Surrey county cricket teams|one from Surrey]]. After the end of the 18th century matches moved to [[Bowman's Lodge]] on [[Dartford Heath]] before Hesketh Park was established at the start of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=dccbrent&gt;[http://www.dartfordcc.co.uk/our-history/dartford-brent Our history: Dartford Brent], [[Dartford Cricket Club]]. Retrieved 2017-11-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

An area of municipal park land was established at Hesketh Park in 1904 as a result of a donation by local businessman [[Everand Hesketh]]. The site was expanded in 1905 when Hesketh purchased land adjacent to the park to build a sports ground which includes the cricket ground. The first match on the ground was held in 1905, with Hesketh bowling the first over.&lt;ref name=dccpark&gt;[http://www.dartfordcc.co.uk/our-history/hesketh-park Our history: Hesketh Park], [[Dartford Cricket Club]].

==Cricket history==
[[Kent County Cricket Club]] used Hesketh Park for First XI fixtures between 1956 and 1990. The first [[first-class cricket]] match on the ground took place in May 1956 and saw Kent play [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]]. A total of 33 first-class matches were held on the ground, with Kent playing a [[County Championship]] fixture at Dartford in most seasons from 1956 until 1990.&lt;ref name=17annual210&gt;Grounds Records in ''Kent County Cricket Club Annual 2017'', pp.210–211.

The final first-class match on the ground was held in August 1990 with [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]] as the opposition.&lt;ref name=dccpark /&gt;&lt;ref name=cafc&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/449_f.html First-class Matches played on Hesketh Park, Dartford], CricketArchive.

'''''In the Bleachers''''' is a [[Comics|comic]] that comments on, and [[lampoons]], sports. It was created in 1985 by American cartoonist/filmmaker [[Steve Moore (cartoonist)|Steve Moore]] and is syndicated internationally by [[Universal Press Syndicate]].&lt;ref name=Lambiek/&gt;

The [[Panel (comics)|single-panel cartoon]] appears in about 200 newspapers worldwide, including the [[Washington Post]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Moore |first=Steve |title=Comics The Washington Post |url=http://wpcomics.washingtonpost.com/client/wpc/bl/2017/06/07/ |work=Universal Uclick |date=2017-06-07|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore got the idea for "In the Bleachers" while working as sports editor at the [[The Maui News|Maui News]]. The comic was launched in 1985.&lt;ref name=Lambiek&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/m/moore_steve.htm|title=Steve Moore|publisher=[[Lambiek]]|accessdate=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;, shortly after Moore was hired as an editor at the [[Los Angeles Times]]. "In the Bleachers" has been published in 6 book collections, including "The Best of In the Bleachers"  by [[Hachette Book Group USA|Warner Books]].

In 2006, [[Sony Pictures Animation]] released the movie ''[[Open Season (2006 film)|Open Season]]'' based on "In the Bleachers" hunting-related cartoons. Moore was Executive Producer, along with partner and producer John Carls. The movie grossed nearly $200 million worldwide. There were also sequels called ''[[Open Season 2]]'', ''[[Open Season 3]]'' and ''[[Open Season: Scared Silly]]''.

On November 4, 2002, 15-second [[animated short]]s by Ed Wexler and Gary Katona of [[Disney Television Animation|Walt Disney Television Animation]] began airing on [[ESPN]]. [[Voice acting|Voices]] included [[April Winchell]], [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] and [[Jeff Bennett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/disney-animation-in-the-bleachers-with-espn/|title=Disney Animation In The Bleachers With ESPN|last=Ball|first=Ryan|work=[[Animation Magazine]]|date=2002-10-31|accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lambiek/&gt;

In a July 2018 interview, Moore said that because of [[Essential Tremor]], he would no longer write the comic strip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailycartoonist.com/index.php/2018/07/09/exclusive-interview-steve-moore-to-step-away-from-in-the-bleachers/|title=Exclusive Interview: Steve Moore to Step Away from ‘In the Bleachers’|publisher=The Daily Cartoonist|date=2018-07-09|accessdate=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current writer is Ben Zaehringer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gocomics.com/inthebleachers|title=In the Bleachers|publisher=[[gocomics]]|accessdate=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sportsperson of the Year''' awards are a group of awards awarded to the most popular [[Luxembourg]]ish sportsperson of the preceding year. There are two main categories: one for men ({{lang-fr|Trophée du Meilleur Sportif}}), and one for women (''Trophée de la Meilleure Sportive''). Other awards are given for the best team (''Challenge de la Meilleure Equipe''), best young sportsperson (''Prix du Jeune Espoir''), most honorable sportsperson (''Prix d'Honneur''), and for fair play (''Prix du Fair play''). The current holders of the main awards are [[Gilles Müller]] and [[Christine Majerus]], while the team award is held by the Women National Table Tennis Team.

==List of winners==

===1954–1965===
From 1954 until 1965, there was a single title of "Sportsperson of the Year", awarded to either a male or female sportsperson.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2224">The '''metabolic window''' (also called the anabolic window) is a term used in [[strength training]] to describe the 30-minute (give or take, dependent on the individual) period after exercise during which nutrition can shift the body from a [[Catabolism|catabolic]] state to an [[Anabolism|anabolic]] one. Specifically, it is during this period that the intake of [[protein]] and [[carbohydrates]] can aid in the increase of [[muscle mass]].&lt;ref name=Ivy49&gt;Ivy, John &amp; Portman, Robert. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=04GJNEwE6zMC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=%22metabolic+window%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=njZIq94s1m&amp;sig=3z831UWMuBUHjbZZL8vrVei2lOs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA49,M1 Nutrient Timing: The Future of Sports Nutrition]''. Basic Health Publications, Inc., 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theorists believe the metabolic window begins to close within minutes of the end of a workout. The same nutrients taken two hours later result in significantly reduced [[protein synthesis]] and muscle [[glycogen]] storage.&lt;ref name=Ivy49/&gt; Further research is needed into the effects of food and exercise timing, but methodology has to be considered in these experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17461390801919102 | title=Protein for adaptations to exercise training | publisher=European Journal of Sport Science | work=Volume 8, Issue 2 | year=2008 | accessdate=April 8, 2012 | author=Tipton, Kevin D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently there is not sufficient scientific evidence to support the metabolic window theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aragon|first=Alan Albert|last2=Schoenfeld|first2=Brad Jon|date=2013-01-29|title=Nutrient timing revisited: is there a post-exercise anabolic window?|journal=Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition|volume=10|pages=5|doi=10.1186/1550-2783-10-5|issn=1550-2783|pmc=3577439|pmid=23360586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nadderud stadion''' is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] at [[Nadderud]] near [[Bekkestua]], in [[Bærum]], Norway.

==Association football==
It is currently used mostly for track and field meets and [[association football|football]] matches, and is the home ground of the Norwegian [[Toppserien]] (women's) and [[Tippeligaen]] (men's) team [[Stabæk Fotball]]. Former tenants are [[Bærum SK]]. Matches for the [[Norway national under-21 football team|U-21 national team]] has also been played here.

The record attendance is about 10,000, from a 1970 cup match where Stabæk played [[Strømsgodset IF|Strømsgodset]]. Ahead of the 1996 season, a new main grandstand with seating for 2,900 people was opened, costing 15 million [[Norwegian krone]] (NOK). It increased the seating at the stadium with 1,400 seats from the old grandstand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nadderud stadion in "new look" |last=Nesbø |first=Knut |authorlink=Knut Nesbø |date=14 February 1996 |work=[[Aftenposten]] |page=15 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The municipality installed [[floodlights (sport)|flood lights]] ahead of the 2005 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stabæk vant – får drømmearenaen|last=Hole |first=Arne |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=30 October 2004 |page=18 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stabæk moved to [[Telenor Arena]] for the 2009 Premier League season, but is returning for the 2012 season. In a 2012 survey carried out by the [[Norwegian Players' Association]] among away-team captains, Nadderud was ranked twelfth amongst league stadiums, with a score of 2.73 on a scale from one to five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/nrk_trondelag/1.8836297 |title=Lerkendal nest beste fotballbane |publisher=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=28 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CYl4tTGG?url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/nrk_trondelag/1.8836297 |language=Norwegian |archivedate=30 November 2012 |accessdate=30 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2009 the stadium is the home pitch of Stabæk's women's team [[Stabæk Fotball Kvinner]] (SFK), who play in the elite [[Toppserien]] league.

Before the start of the 2012 season, Stabæk Fotball has moved back to Nadderud and the team's NPL matches will be played at the stadium. This follows a decline in fortune of the top tier team, who were not able to pay for their rent for Telenor Arena past the end of 2011.

==Athletics==
The stadium hosted the [[European Cup in Athletics]], First League for Men, in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gbrathletics.com/ic/epb.htm|title=European Cup B Final and First League|work=GBR Athletics|publisher=Athletics Weekly|accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestically it has hosted the Norwegian Championships in 1966 (arranged by ([[IL Tyrving]]) and 1985 (arranged by ([[Fossum IF]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.friidrett.no/stevner/statistikk/nm/Documents/amnm.htm |title=Main Championships Men |publisher=[[Norwegian Athletics Association]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=25 November 2011 |archivedate=25 November 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63SxANU6u?url=http://www.friidrett.no/stevner/statistikk/nm/Documents/amnm.htm |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It annually hosts the country's largest track and field meet, Tyrvinglekene.

==Bandy==
The Norwegian [[bandy]] final was held here on 22 February 1970 when [[Strømsgodset IF]] under a heavy snowfall beat [[Stabæk Bandy|Stabæk IF]] 3–1.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2508">'''Offside''' is a minor [[penalty (American football)|foul]] in [[gridiron football]] caused when a defender crosses the [[line of scrimmage]] ahead of the snap of the ball. The penalty associated with the infraction is the advancing of the ball five yards and a replay of the down.

==History==

===Definition===
In [[gridiron football]], '''offside''' is a [[penalty (American football)|foul]] in which a player is on the wrong side of the [[line of scrimmage]] when the ball is snapped. This foul occurs simultaneously with the snap. Unlike offensive players, defensive players are not compelled to come to a set position before the snap. If a defender jumps across the line but gets back to his side before the snap, there is no foul. In the case of an offside foul, play is not stopped, and the foul is announced at the conclusion of the play. Media covering the games calls it a "free play" for the offense, as the non-offending team may decline the penalty and take the yardage gained on the play (and when the play works against them, like a turnover to the opposing team, the non-offending team can accept the penalty and retake possession of the ball)—unlike in the case of a [[false start]] foul against the offense, whereupon the play is immediately stopped by the officials.

This foul is almost always committed by the defense (any offensive player that moves into the neutral zone after setting would be charged with a false start). However, it is possible for the offense to commit this foul. If an offensive player lines up in the neutral zone, an offside foul will be called against the offense.

===Penalty===

Prior to 1925, a call of offside against a defensive unit brought with it an automatic [[first down]] in addition to a five-yard advancement of the ball for the offense.&lt;ref name=same&gt;Associated Press, [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4638019/forward_pass_to_remain_just_same/ "Forward Pass to Remain Just Same,"] ''Corvallis [OR] Gazette-Times,'' vol. 16, no. 206 (Dec. 30, 1924), pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a December 1924 meeting of the [[Football Coaches' Association of America]] spurred a change of rules for the 1925 season eliminating the provision for an automatic first down, while leaving the five yard penalty intact.&lt;ref name=same /&gt;

The penalty for violation remains 5 yards at most levels of professional and amateur play.

The '''Philippine Sports Institute''' ('''PSI''') is a [[sports training]] organization in the Philippines. It is under the [[Philippine Sports Commission]].

==History==
The Philippine Sports Institute (PSI) was first launched in May 1996 as the Philippine Institute of Sports (PhilSports). Then President [[Fidel Ramos]] instructed then [[Philippine Sports Commission]] (PSC) Chairman Philip Ella Juico to form the sports institute which was inaugurated on November that year. With the help of  former PSC Chairman Perry Mequi, Philsports organized various programs.&lt;ref name="ending20"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Henson|first1=Joaquin|title=Ending a 20-year wait|url=http://www.philstar.com/sports/2016/09/07/1621301/ending-20-year-wait|accessdate=25 January 2017|work=Sporting Chance|publisher=The Philippine Star|date=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was disestablished in 1998 by Juico's successor. Under the Republic Act 6847 of 1990, the PSC is mandated to run a sports institute alongside of maintaining a Philippine Sports Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name="duterteopens"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bonilla|first1=Ramon Rafael|title=Duterte opens reestablished sports institute|url=http://www.businessmirror.com.ph/duterte-opens-reestablished-sports-institute/|accessdate=4 January 2017|work=BusinessMirror|date=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sports institute was briefly revived in 2005 by PSC Chairman William Ramirez under the administration of then President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] but was made defunct by Ramirez's successor.&lt;ref name="duterteopens"/&gt; When Ramirez was appointed once again to the post by President [[Rodrigo Duterte]], the organization was revived once again.

The PSI was reestablished two weeks before September 16, 2016&lt;!---Could be late-August or early September---&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Giongco|first1=Nick|title=PSC makes a move to end poor performance|url=http://2016.mb.com.ph/2016/09/16/psc-makes-a-move-to-end-poor-performance/|accessdate=4 January 2017|publisher=Manila Bulletin|date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sports institute was patterned after the Canberra based [[Australian Institute of Sport]]. Marc Velasco was appointed as the first national training director of the PSI since its revival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Navarro|first=June|title=PSC enlists collegiate leagues' assistance|url=http://sports.inquirer.net/228913/psc-enlists-collegiate-leagues-assistance|accessdate=4 January 2017|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 16, 2017, the PSI was formally launched at the [[PhilSports Arena]].&lt;ref name=relaunched&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bonilla|first1=Ramon Rafael|title=Philippine Sports Institute relaunched|url=http://www.businessmirror.com.ph/philippine-sports-institute-relaunched/|accessdate=16 January 2017|publisher=BusinessMirror|date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] was supposed to lead the ceremony,&lt;ref name="duterteopens"/&gt; but did not make it due to prior commitments. Instead, Cabinet Secretary [[Leoncio Evasco]] was sent as the President's representative in the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/psc-relaunches-ph-sports-institute/307275/|title=PSC relaunches PH Sports Institute|publisher=[[Manila Times]]|last=David|first=Jean Russel V.|date=January 16, 2017|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; PSC Chairman William Ramirez led the relaunch with Philippine Olympic Committee President [[Peping Cojuangco]] also in attendance.&lt;ref name=relaunched/&gt;

==Programs==
With support from the [[United States Sports Academy]], the PSI will provide Filipino officials international courses on sports management, coaching, and physical education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Terrado|first1=Reuben|title=Philippine Sports Institute to offer international sports education courses|url=https://www.spin.ph/psc-poc/news/psc-psi-united-states-sports-academy-partnership-william-ramirez|accessdate=14 May 2018|work=Sports Interactive Network Philippines|date=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stark's Park''' is a [[association football|football]] [[stadium]] in [[Kirkcaldy]], [[Scotland]]. It is the home ground of [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]], who have played there since 1891. {{As of|2016}}, the ground has an all-seated capacity of {{SPFL-stadiums|raith}}.&lt;ref name="capacity"/&gt;

==History==

The ground was opened in 1891 (this is actually when Raith started using it, it has been around longer) and seats {{SPFL-stadiums|raith}}.&lt;ref name="capacity"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spfl.co.uk/clubs/raith/ |title=Raith Rovers Football Club|publisher=Scottish Professional Football League |accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in [[Kirkcaldy]], [[Fife]]. The park can clearly be seen from the railway line on the route between [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Edinburgh]] and [[Aberdeen railway station|Aberdeen]].

The unusual L-shaped main stand that houses the players dressing facilities and the supporters lounge was designed by the renowned ''Grandstand'' architect [[Archibald Leitch]] and was built with part funding from the sale of [[Alex James (footballer)|Alex James]] to [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] in 1925. Other funding came from a loan scheme that was not finally paid off until 1946. The terracing was open to the elements except for a covered enclosure affectionately known as the "coo shed" which stood opposite the main stand and ran approximately two-thirds of the length of the pitch. The ash and railway sleeper terracing which surrounded all sides of the ground except the stand enclosure was replaced with new concrete works in the north and south enclosures behind the goals. This work being carried out in the 1950s when a shed was erected at either end to give partial covering to the supporters. Typical of several football grounds of the time the club sold advertising space on the pitched asbestos roofs of the covered areas to companies such as R'bt Hutchison &amp; Co (Youma Bread), The Evening Dispatch, Nelsons Cigarettes and Barnett &amp; Morton Ltd, the local ironmonger who had erected the sheds. Shortly after the above terrace was upgraded, four large floodlighting pylons similar to those at [[Tynecastle Stadium|Tynecastle Park]] were erected to allow evening midweek fixtures to be played all year round. Most of the cost of the above work was covered (as had become the norm) by the sale of assets, the most notable of those being [[Jackie Stewart (footballer born 1921)|Jackie Stewart]] to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], [[Jim Baxter]] to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] and [[Jimmy MacEwan]] to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], the latter deal also leading to Villa travelling north to play in the first match under the new lights.

[[Image:Alec James signing fee.jpg|thumb|left|Alex James' share of the transfer fee which helped fund the main stand.]] The ground then remained unchanged for almost thirty years until the departure of a modern-day Alex James in the form of striker [[Andy Harrow]] who in 1981 was sold to [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]]. The sale of this latest asset allowed the board to demolish the antiquated railway enclosure and build a 1,000 seat stand on the south side and terraced concrete steps at the north side. This was how the ground was to remain until more redevelopment in the early 1990s. Anticipating a swift return after relegation from the Premier league in 1992 the board spent £250,000 on upgrading the north and south ends of the ground when the 1950s concrete was taken up and new terracing and crush barriers erected, although the sheds remained. Though the board's confidence in achieving promotion was well founded the money spent was to prove a poor investment as after the last home game of season 1995–96 the bulldozers returned and demolished both ends of the ground and the railway enclosure.

[[Barr Construction]] were appointed to redevelop the stadium. Two 3,370 seat stands with inbuilt floodlight towers behind each goal and a 1000-seat stand to join onto the 1980s railway (new) stand were erected. This work brought the ground capacity up to a creditable 10,700 all seater. During all of the above changes the main pavilion remained totally unchanged with its asbestos roof, concrete steps and wooden seats and benches. A new metal roof and plastic seating were finally installed in 1999 which slightly reduced the spectator capacity to 8,473. As of the 2017/2018 season the railway stand is to be converted into a standing support section adding to the total capacity which will become 11198.

In the 2018 [[Season_(sports)#Off-season|close season]], a synthetic pitch was laid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifetoday.co.uk/sport/football/raith-rovers/gallery-new-pitch-progress-at-stark-s-park-1-4744473|title=Gallery: New pitch progress at Stark’s Park|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/fife/627814/raith-rovers-given-green-light-for-synthetic-surface-at-starks-park/|title=Raith Rovers given green light for synthetic surface at Stark's Park - The Courier|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="136892">A '''[[Child sexual abuse in the United Kingdom|sexual abuse]] scandal''' involving the abuse of young players at [[Association football|football]] clubs in the [[United Kingdom]] began in mid-November 2016. The revelations began when former professional [[association football|football]]ers waived their rights to [[anonymity]] and talked publicly about being abused by former [[coach (sport)#association football)|coaches]] and [[Scout (association football)|scouts]] in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. This led to a surge of further allegations, as well as allegations that some clubs had covered them up.

Echoing similar revelations in the 1990s, the initial 2016 allegations centred on abuse of young players at [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] due to the clubs' associations with Barry Bennell (previously convicted of sexual abuse offences in the UK and US) who, on 29 November 2016, was charged with new offences. Allegations were also made against George Ormond, a former [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] youth coach and scout (who also had previous convictions), former [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] scout Eddie Heath, and former [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough]] coach Bob Higgins. In early December 2016, allegations about former youth coaches and scouts in Northern Ireland and Scotland also started to emerge.

Within a month of the initial reporting, the [[The Football Association|Football Association]], the [[Scottish Football Association]], several football clubs and over 20 UK police forces had established various inquiries and investigations and over 350 alleged victims had come forward. By July 2018, 300 suspects were reported to have been identified by 849 alleged victims, with 2,807 incidents involving 340 different clubs. These have led to 13 individuals being charged with historical sexual abuse, of which nine have been tried: seven - Bennell, Ormond, William Toner, Michael Coleman, Jim McCafferty, Robert Smith and James Torbett - have been convicted and jailed; Higgins has been found guilty of one charge and faces a retrial on 48 further charges; Paul McCann was cleared. Gerald King is currently on trial, two await trial, and one has since died. Other allegations involve individuals who had died prior to the revelations.

In July 2018, the FA's independent inquiry was said to have found no evidence of an institutional cover-up or of a paedophile ring operating within football, but intended publication of its report in September 2018 was delayed, potentially by up to a year, pending the retrial of Higgins and possible further charges against Bennell.

==Implicated individuals==
The sexual abuse allegations related to several publicly identified individuals, listed below in the order of which they were named as the scandal developed from late 2016, through 2017 and into 2018 (some individuals, including Bennell, Ormond, Langford and Torbett, had previously been named and convicted for earlier offences of sexual abuse).

===Barry Bennell===

On 16 November 2016, former Crewe defender [[Andy Woodward]] alleged in an interview with [[Daniel Taylor (journalist)|Daniel Taylor]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper that he had been the victim of [[child sexual abuse]] by former football coach Barry Bennell at the club in the 1980s&lt;ref name="Guardian-16Nov2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Daniel|title=Andy Woodward: ‘It was the softer, weaker boys he targeted’|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/16/andy-woodward|accessdate=19 November 2016|work=The Guardian|date=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian-17Nov2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Daniel|last2=James|first2=Stuart|title=Associate of Barry Bennell also preyed on boys, two former footballers reveal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/17/barry-bennell-two-former-players-reveal|accessdate=19 November 2016|work=The Guardian|date=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-17/11/2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=Former footballer Andy Woodward tells of sexual abuse|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-38007412|accessdate=19 November 2016|work=BBC News|date=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Woodward later claimed "People should know I suffered more than one abuser").&lt;ref name="BBCWoodward-22Dec2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=Andy Woodward says police interview delay over abuse claims is 'shocking'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38399324|accessdate=22 December 2016|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 21 November, it was reported that six other people had contacted the police.&lt;ref name="Taylor-21Nov2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Daniel|title=Six come forward after Andy Woodward’s allegations of abuse at Crewe|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/21/crewe-alexandra-andy-woodward|accessdate=21 November 2016|work=The Guardian|date=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doubt regarding Crewe's claims of ignorance began to emerge on 25 November. First, Hamilton Smith, a director at Crewe Alexandra from 1986 to 1990, told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that the club heard an allegation that Bennell had sexually abused a junior footballer. However, Bennell was allowed to stay at the club – despite the then chairman, Norman Rowlinson, recommending that the club "get him out" and raising concerns with Manchester City – so long as Bennell was not left alone with boys and was stopped from arranging overnight stays;&lt;ref name="Board-25Nov2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Daniel|title=Crewe were warned about Barry Bennell but he stayed on, says former board member|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/25/crewe-barry-bennell-former-board-member|accessdate=25 November 2016|work=The Guardian|date=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was later (February 2018) reported that Rowlinson had sought police advice about Bennell and had been advised to "move him on".&lt;ref name="Taylor-27Feb2018"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Daniel|title=Crewe ignored police advice in late 1980s to ‘move on’ Barry Bennell|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/27/crewe-ignored-police-advice-to-move-on-barry-bennell|accessdate=1 March 2018|work=Guardian|date=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith said fellow directors did not want to rely on [[hearsay]] evidence and local gossip. In 2001 Smith met Tony Pickerin, the [[The Football Association|Football Association]]'s head of education and child protection (formerly head of the FA's national school at [[Lilleshall Hall#Sports centre|Lilleshall]]), and requested an FA investigation into the care of children at Gresty Road. He said he later received a three-line letter from Pickerin saying the FA had “investigated the issues and is satisfied that there is no case to answer.”&lt;ref name="Board-25Nov2016" /&gt;

Secondly, on 7 December 2016, the BBC reported that the mother of a former Crewe youth team player wrote an anonymous letter to Dario Gradi in 1989–90, asking him to investigate "inappropriate" behaviour whereby a member of staff "took lots of boys into his room overnight" during a weekend away in Blackpool.&lt;ref name="Ray-07Dec2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ray|first1=Louis Lee|title=Football abuse claims: Ex-QPR player speaks out|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38225215|accessdate=7 December 2016|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bennell history====
Once a youth player at Chelsea,&lt;ref name="Mendick-30Nov2016-Bennell"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mendick|first1=Robert|title=Chelsea chief scout accused of child sex abuse once trained Barry Bennell, it emerges|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/30/chelsea-chief-scout-accused-child-sex-abuse-trained-barry-bennell/|accessdate=23 December 2016|work=The Telegraph|date=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bennell had worked for at least four English professional clubs: Manchester City, Crewe (from around 1984 until he was sacked in 1992 for reasons that have never been made public), [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] and [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]],&lt;ref name="Herbert-25Nov2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Herbert|first1=Ian|title=Barry Bennell: Convicted paedophile worked with at least four professional clubs|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/barry-bennell-sexual-abuse-scandal-manchester-city-leeds-stoke-crewe-a7437541.html|accessdate=25 November 2016|work=The Independent|date=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1992 to 1994 was head coach of the Staffordshire side [[Stone Dominoes F.C.|Stone Dominoes]].&lt;ref name="TaylorObs-26Nov2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Daniel|title=When I started talking to Barry Bennell’s victims, I had no idea how deep abuse ran in football|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/26/barry-bennell-victims-football-paedophile-interviews|accessdate=27 November 2016|work=The Observer|date=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a 1994 Dominoes tour to the United States, a 13-year-old club player claimed that Bennell had sexually abused him. Bennell was arrested in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], and eventually charged on six counts of sexual battery and [[Lascivious behavior|lewd and lascivious behavior]]. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to four years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name="Herbert-25Nov2016" /&gt;

In the meantime, in 1996, a UK [[Channel 4]] ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]'' programme highlighted child abuse allegations involving Bennell (also other coaches: Keith Ketley in Ipswich, Bob Higgins in Hampshire). The documentary featured Ian Ackley, a former player at Derbyshire youth side White Knowl, who was one of four boys who had come forward to British police after Bennell's US arrest.&lt;ref name="Cooper-Jan1997"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cooper|first1=Glenda|title=Boy soccer players being put at risk|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/boy-soccer-players-being-put-at-risk-1284592.html|accessdate=25 November 2016|work=The Independent|date=23 January 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dickinson-25Nov2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dickinson|first1=Matt|title=‘Coach’s abuse was like a taboo, a dirty secret’|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/sport/it-was-like-a-taboo-a-dirty-secret-xhvhpcm96|accessdate=25 November 2016|work=The Times|date=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, although Bennell did not serve the full term of imprisonment in America, he was arrested again on his return to England.&lt;ref name="Herbert-25Nov2016" /&gt;

In February 1998, Bennell appeared at [[Mold, Flintshire|Mold]] Crown Court in north Wales and pleaded not guilty to charges of [[indecent assault]], [[buggery]] and attempted buggery dating back to the 1970s and 1980s through to 1992, against children aged between nine and 15, with offences alleged to have taken place in Derbyshire, in the Crewe area and at [[Butlins#Pwllheli|Butlin's]] in [[Pwllheli]], north Wales. Bennell was remanded in custody to appear at [[Chester]] Crown Court in June 1998.&lt;ref name="Warrington-25Nov2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=Former soccer coach denies child sex charges|url=http://www.warringtonguardian.co.uk/news/5315416.FORMER_SOCCER_COACH_DENIES_SEX_CHARGES/?ref=arc|accessdate=25 November 2016|work=Warrington Guardian|date=26 February 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Chester, Bennell was found guilty of 23 offences against six boys (including Ian Ackley),&lt;ref name="Ackley-24Nov2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=Abuse victim: FA and football clubs should have protected me from monster|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2016-11-24/abuse-victim-fa-and-football-clubs-should-have-protected-me-from-monster/|accessdate=25 November 2016|work=ITV News|publisher=ITV|date=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received a nine-year jail sentence (a further 22 offences were left on file because the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] decided it was better not to put young boys through the trauma of a trial).&lt;ref name="TaylorObs-26Nov2016" /&gt; In May 2015, Bennell (then calling himself 'Richard Jones' and living in [[Milton Keynes]]) received a further sentence of two years after pleading guilty to sexually abusing David Lean&lt;ref name="Ashenden-29Nov2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelso-29Nov2016" /&gt; at a camp in [[Macclesfield]] in 1980.&lt;ref name="Independent-24Nov2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dario Gradi issues statement to say he knew nothing about Barry Bennell's abuse of young footballers before arrest|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/dario-gradi-statement-barry-bennell-sexual-abuse-crewe-alexandra-andy-woodward-steve-walters-david-a7436821.html|accessdate=25 November 2016|work=The Independent|date=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hilton-11May2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hilton|first1=Rhiannon|title=Former Crewe Alex coach sentenced for child sex abuse|url=http://www.crewechronicle.co.uk/news/former-crewe-alex-coach-sentenced-9235124|accessdate=25 November 2016|work=Crewe Chronicle|date=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sentinel-12May 2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Crewe Alexandra football scout jailed for indecent assault on 12-year-old child|url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/crewe-alexandra-football-scout-jailed-indecent/story-26485463-detail/story.html|accessdate=25 November 2016|work=The Sentinel|date=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the inquest in 2012 into the death of [[Gary Speed]], it was alleged that Speed and former Manchester United player [[Alan Davies (footballer)|Alan Davies]] had been "favourites" of Bennell, though there was no suggestion they had been abused by Bennell.&lt;ref name="Ward-13May 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ward|first1=Victoria|title=Gary Speed was 'coached by paedophile' as a child|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/news/9262754/Gary-Speed-was-coached-by-paedophile-as-a-child.html|accessdate=25 November 2016|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both players later took their own lives, as did Mark Hazeldine, coached by Bennell at Manchester City in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="Taylor-16Feb2018"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Daniel|title=Did this special football talent kill himself because of Barry Bennell?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/16/barry-bennell-manchester-city-mark-hazeldine-killed-himself|accessdate=16 February 2018|work=Guardian|date=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LT-15Feb2018"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gary Speed and three others linked to Bennell committed suicide, jurors told|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/15997114.Gary_Speed_and_three_others_linked_to_Bennell_committed_suicide__jurors_told/|accessdate=16 February 2018|work=Lancashire Telegraph|date=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ted Langford===
On 30 January 2017, former [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] trainee [[Tony Brien]] told the BBC that he had been abused from the age of 12 by club scout Ted Langford in the 1980s while at local youth team Dunlop Tigers (Langford had been named in allegations which surfaced in December 2016).&lt;ref name="Winter-8Dec2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Winter|first1=Henry|title=Leicester and Villa part of abuse inquiry|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/leicester-and-villa-part-of-abuse-inquiry-zm7d52223|accessdate=7 February 2017|work=The Times|date=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brien said he had been assaulted on the pretext that the scout needed the player's sperm to establish whether he had a "footballer's gene".

Langford was sacked by Aston Villa in 1988.

After the Hamilton Smith interview suggesting the FA failed to thoroughly investigate Crewe's system, on 27 November, the FA announced it was to set up an internal review, led by independent counsel Kate Gallafent QC, into what Crewe and Manchester City knew about Barry Bennell and allegations of child sexual abuse in football, and investigate what information it was aware of at the time of the alleged offences.&lt;ref name="Guardian-27Nov2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=FA sets up review into child sex abuse in football after Barry Bennell claims|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/27/fa-review-child-sex-abuse-football-barry-bennell-claims|accessdate=27 November 2016|work=The Guardian|date=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FA was criticised by Conservative MP [[Damian Collins]], chair of the House of Commons' [[Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee|Culture, Media and Sport Committee]], for being too slow in reacting and not instigating a wider review.&lt;ref name="BBC-28Nov2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=Football Association child sex abuse review 'not enough'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38128570|accessdate=28 November 2016|work=BBC|date=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former sport minister [[Gerry Sutcliffe]] talked of previous concern about how the FA dealt with governance of the sport and with youth development (in the 1990s, the FA was said to have reacted "dismissively" to worries about sexual abuse in the game, and too slow to implement criminal record checks;&lt;ref name="Reed-08Dec2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reed|first1=Jim|last2=Ray|first2=Louis Lee|title=Football abuse: FA reacted 'dismissively' to protection calls|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38242317|accessdate=8 December 2016|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2003, the FA had scrapped a project meant to ensure children were being protected from sexual abuse;&lt;ref name="Reed-30Nov2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reed|first1=Jim|title=FA 'pulled all funding' from child protection project|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38145061|accessdate=3 December 2016|work=BBC|date=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and FA officials had been uncooperative with the review project, with ten of 14 FA staff not replying to interview requests and a report by the researchers of others being "prevented/bullied" from talking).&lt;ref name="Taylor-1Apr2017" /&gt; Sutcliffe said an independent body, such as the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]], should look at the issue rather than the FA investigating itself: "What I've seen in football over the years is that they're very narrow, very insular, and may not do a proper job even though with the right intentions."&lt;ref name="BBC-Soton-03Dec2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=Southampton 'abuser' still working in football|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38191644|accessdate=3 December 2016|work=BBC News|agency=BBC|date=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 December 2016, the FA announced that, due to "the increased scope of the review since it was announced"&lt;ref name="FA-TOR-06Dec2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Terms of reference for review into alleged non-recent child sexual abuse in football|url=http://www.thefa.com/news/2016/dec/05/fa-statement-terms-of-reference-061216#U2v6Wmb00hyAKYda.99|website=Football Association|publisher=FA|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gallafent's other professional commitments, the review would be conducted by Clive Sheldon QC.&lt;ref name="BBC-06Dec2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=Harry Redknapp criticises FA over coach claims|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38218377|accessdate=6 December 2016|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, it was announced that former Chelsea assistant manager Dario Gradi would be among the first to be targeted by the FA's enquiry over the "smoothing over" allegation,&lt;ref name="FAGradi-06Dec2016"/&gt; and five days later the FA announced Gradi had been suspended.&lt;ref name="FAGradi-11Dec2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-FA-Gradi-11Dec2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rawlinson-12Dec2016" /&gt; Almost three months later, in February 2017, it was reported that Gradi planned to appeal against his FA suspension from football, feeling he had been left "in limbo".&lt;ref name="Conway-27Feb2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Conway|first1=Richard|title=Dario Gradi: Crewe director of football to appeal against FA suspension|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39103246|accessdate=27 February 2017|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 January 2017, it was reported that the FA had suspended former Crewe youth coach Paul McCann.&lt;ref name="McCannsuspension-5Jan2017"/&gt;

The FA collaborated with other UK sports bodies to support the NSPCC's Child Protection in Sport Unit (CPSU), founded in 2001 following various 1990s revelations of abuse, most notably in swimming. Brunel University's Daniel Rhind said the FA is today seen as a leading sports governing body for child protection with the system put in place since the CPSU was formed regarded as a “gold standard” model other countries can follow.&lt;ref name="Conn re Brackenridge-29Dec2016" /&gt; In December 2016, the FA said that 99% of its 7,814 grassroots clubs, covering 62,238 teams, had responded to a deadline to renew their safeguarding policies and commitment.&lt;ref name="Conn re Brackenridge-29Dec2016" /&gt; On 6 January 2017, the FA said 99.7% of clubs' coaches had valid criminal records checks but more than 2,500 coaches were without an in-date CRC, and so these clubs were facing potential suspension and removal of their FA affiliation.&lt;ref name="Dennis-6Jan2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dennis|first1=Ian|title=Football sex abuse: Junior clubs must get coaches cleared or face suspension|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38537776|accessdate=19 January 2017|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 January 2017, it was reported that the FA's review, led by Clive Sheldon, had made its first call for evidence, writing to all football clubs in England and Wales, amateur and professional, asking for information about allegations of child sexual abuse between 1970 and 2005.

All 46 county FAs had responded to the inquiry.

In October 2017, FA chairman [[Greg Clarke]] was criticised by Andy Woodward for 'humiliating' remarks Clarke made to a Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee hearing,&lt;ref name="Rumsby-25Oct2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rumbsy|first1=Ben|title=Greg Clarke under fire again as abuse survivor Andy Woodward accuses FA chairman of 'humiliating' him|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/10/25/greg-clarke-fire-abuse-survivor-andy-woodward-accuses-fa-chairman/|accessdate=30 October 2017|work=Telegraph|date=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-26Oct2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=Woodward 'devastated &amp; deeply upset'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41768651|accessdate=30 October 2017|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Professional Footballers' Association]]'s chief executive [[Gordon Taylor (footballer)|Gordon Taylor]] said the PFA might sue Clarke over suggestions Taylor had not supported Woodward with further counselling.&lt;ref name="Kelner-26Oct2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kelner|first1=Martha|title=PFA’s Gordon Taylor considering legal action against FA chairman Greg Clarke|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/oct/26/fa-chairman-greg-clarke-admits-organisation-has-lost-trust-of-the-public|accessdate=30 October 2017|work=Guardian|date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, it was reported that the FA's independent inquiry had found no evidence of an institutional cover-up or of a paedophile ring operating within football.

The FA's enquiry also linked to club enquiries. In May 2017, FA letters were sent to almost 20 clubs linked to the scandal to establish if they are holding their own reviews and, if not, why not.

'''War Memorial Stadium''' is a [[stadium]] located in [[Wailuku, Hawaii]] that opened in 1969 and holds 23,000 people.  It is primarily used for [[American football]], and from 1998 through 2005 was the venue for the [[Hula Bowl]], a [[college football]] all-star game. When the stadium originally opened in 1969 it held fewer than 7,000 people. It was expanded due to the efforts of the then-mayor of Maui, [[Linda Lingle]], to host the Hula Bowl.

The War Memorial Stadium is also home to the [[Maui Interscholastic League]] (MIL) High School Football association.  The stadium is also equipped with a state of the art 440 yard track, long jump, triple jump, high jump, and pole vaulting pits. In 1972, the stadium was the site of the first State High School Track and Field Championships held outside of [[Honolulu]], chosen in part because of the new state of the art rubberized [[asphalt]] surface.

Adjacent to the War Memorial Stadium is a 1,500 plus seat [[Maehara Stadium]], that is home to the [[Maui Interscholastic League]] Baseball and American Legion Games.

The War Memorial Stadium Complex houses training facilities for H.P. Baldwin High School, Soccer, and Softball Fields, Soichi Sakamoto Pool, and a 2,000 plus seat gymnasium. The complex was dedicated in 1965 to honor the Veterans of Maui County (comprising the Islands of Maui, Moloka'i and Lana'i) who gave their lives in service of their country.

The Stadium complex is located on the windward side of the island between the towns of [[Kahului]] and the county seat [[Wailuku]], on the Valley Isle of [[Maui]] and is adjacent to H.P. [[Henry Perrine Baldwin High School|Baldwin High School]].

'''White-collar boxing''' is a form of [[boxing]] in which men and women in [[White-collar worker|white-collar professions]] train to fight at special events. Most have had no prior boxing experience.

==Early history==
White-collar boxing has its beginnings at [[Gleason's Gym]] in [[New York City]].  Gym owner Bruce Silverglade began organizing informal fights between the white-collar workers of his clientele in the late 1980s, which later developed into regular monthly events.  After developing into a regular monthly event, the sport came to prominence in the mid-1990s under the organization of boxing promoter Alan Lacey.&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/3908985 |title=White men can box |last=McAuley |first=Tom |work=The Economist |date=12 May 2000 |accessdate=24 Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2004 over 65% of Gleason's Gym membership was from a [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] background, compared to 10% in the early 1990s.  The increase of membership from this demographic has been credited with maintaining the profitability of boxing gyms in the US and UK.&lt;ref name=bw&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2004-11-28/out-of-the-office-into-the-ring |title=Out of the Office, Into the Ring |last1=Hindo |first1=Brian |last2=Cohn |first2=Laura |work=Business Week |date=28 Nov 2004 |accessdate=24 Jun 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Event management consultant Alan Lacey, who co-promoted the [[Gary Stretch]] vs. [[Chris Eubank]] [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] middleweight championship bout in 1991, belatedly discovered boxing training at the age of 45. Captivated and motivated by the discipline over the following years, he started training under former European champion Jimmy McDonnell and alongside two-time Olympian and world title challenger Adrian Dodson, who having spent most of his youth at Gleason’s Gym in New York suggested Lacey to fulfill his ambition to box, even at the age of 48, and arranged for him to visit Gleason's and box there. On the flight back to London, Lacey decided white-collar boxing could flourish in London. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}
 
In July 2000, the inaugural white-collar boxing event, "Capital Punishment", in collaboration with Gleason's owner Bruce Silverglade, saw a team of Wall Street bankers fly to London to compete at Broadgate Arena in London, generating interest and media coverage. Lacey boxed twice on the night and subsequently devoted his time and energy to developing the sport exclusively since. Over 100 sold-out events have followed "Capital Punishment", including "Celebrity Boxing" on the BBC in 2003 featuring, among others, [[Les Dennis]] and [[Ricky Gervais]], and raising more than [[Pound sterling|UK₤]]1.5 million for various charities. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==In the Asia–Pacific region==
{{expand section|with=history of the sport in the region|date=June 2014}}

The many bouts in the Asia–Pacific region are usually contested under WWCBA ''(see below)'' sanctioning.

==Governing bodies==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}

In 2001, Lacey and Bruce Silverglade co-founded the '''International White Collar Boxing Association''' (IWCBA),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/3908985 'White men can box' economist.com]&lt;/ref&gt; the first and to this day main advisory and sanctioning [[Sport governing body|governing body]] in the field, designed to regulate the bouts with a focus on safety. The IWCBA uses the same weight divisions of professional boxing and awards a belt to the champions of each weight category. Matchmaking of non-title bouts is based on level of experience as much as actual weight. It also rigorously requires the presence of an experienced doctor, an [[anesthetist]], and a paramedic unit at ringside as well as thorough medical checks. Over 1,500 bouts have been sanctioned by the IWCBA over the years, with zero injuries aside from bloody noses.  IWBCA-sanctioned bouts are predominant in the UK and US.

In 2007, the '''World White Collar Boxing Association''' (WWCBA) was founded to London, UK, to regulate and promote the sport throughout the world, but is principally active in the Asia–Pacific region. The WWCBA provides a common platform in the form of rules and guidelines allowing boxers to become ranked nationally, regionally and globally and to contest for championship titles. In 2008 the WWCBA sanctioned 9 events throughout the world. The WWCBA works with other boxing authorities such as the amateur [[International Boxing Association (amateur)|International Boxing Association]] (AIBA) to ensure strong standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwcba.org/about.html About the WWCBA wwcba.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bouts==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}

Bouts are usually three 2-minute rounds ("3×2" format), unlike the longer three 3-minute rounds (3×3) in the Amateur Code for men and 4×2 format for women. The IWCBA bouts have traditionally been "no decision" draws (ties) in absence of a knock-out, while WWCBA ranking system requires a win-loss decision for all bouts.

The first large gala events included the [[Boodles Boxing Ball]] series attended by Prince Harry as well as the "Hedge Fund Fight Nite" raising over $200,000 for charity both is initially organized/staged by The Real Fight Club.

In 2005 a purely non-profit black-tie gala at the London Hilton organized by The David Adams Leukaemia Appeal Fund &amp; Mr King with more than 950 black-tie dinner guests raised over £100,000 for The Royal Marsden Hospital Cancer Campaign on the night.  It was the largest event of its kind until 2013, see below.

In April 2009 a gala at Suntec Singapore Exhibition and Convention Centre staged by Vanda Promotions had more than 900 black-tie guests.

On Saturday, 18 July 2009, the Channel Island of Jersey held its first white-collar-boxing event. Nine fights were watched by over 600 paying, black-tied guests at the Hotel de France, raising around £15,000 for local charities.

Ultra White Collar Boxing (UWCB) are the largest company organising events in the UK. They held the largest event in November 2014 with 3000 spectators, they hold events in over 100 towns and cities across the UK and have raised over £16,000,000 to date for Cancer Research UK. They also held the largest event in the UK with over 3,500 guest at an event in Coventry in 2015. UWCB organise over 250 events a year with an average of 15,000 people taking part each year. 

On 13 October 2012, [http://www.neilsonboxing.co.uk Neilson Boxing], a Swindon-based white-collar-boxing promoter, put on the largest show of its kind to date.  A venue verified attendance of 1398 watched ten contests at the Oasis Leisure Centre in Swindon with the main event seeing Dave 'Bam Bam' Gregory retain his NP Heavyweight title against Rich 'The Tank' Loveday over three rounds. This was surpassed in March 2014 when a crowd of nearly 2,000 fight fans saw 'Sugar' Shawn Grant defeat ex-pro Phill Day to gain the Vacant Cruiserweight Title.

On 20 April 2013, Vanda Promotions (part of Vanda Sports Group) held its twenty-fourth event in Singapore making the series the longest consecutive white-collar boxing in the history of the sport. A verified attendance of 1,943 attended the black-tie event at the Raffles Convention Centre which brought total attendance over the five-year history of the events to 15,491. The event also saw Vanda move past the $2 million mark for funds raised for children's charities in Asia and for the continued funding of the Vanda Wing at Children's Surgical Centre in Cambodia. Vanda was also the recipient of the "Promoter of the year award" for the fourth consecutive year from the World White Collar Boxing Association (WWCBA).

==Equipment==
Sixteen-[[ounce]] gloves are standard in the white-collar-boxing ring in order to protect competitors from heavy blows and hand injuries.  Some gyms permit 14&amp;nbsp;oz gloves as well for lighter weight classes and for female competitors.  Moreover, headgear, groin protectors, and mouthguards are obligatory requirements inside the ring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://truewhitecollarboxing.com/general/white-collar-boxing-rules/ Example of white collar boxing rules at truewhitecollarboxing.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
