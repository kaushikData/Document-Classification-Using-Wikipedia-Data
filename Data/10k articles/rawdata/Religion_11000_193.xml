In [[Ancient Roman]] [[sacrifice|sacrificial]] tradition, an '''acerra''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''{{lang|grc|λιβανωτρίς}}'') was the [[incense]] box used in sacrifices. The incense was taken out of the acerra and let fall upon the burning [[altar]]; hence, we have the expression ''de acerra libare''. ([[turibulum]])

The acerra was also, according to [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]], a small altar, placed before the dead, on which perfumes were burnt. There was a law in the [[Twelve Tables]], which restricted the use of acerrae at [[funeral]]s.

'''Anne Rice'''&lt;ref name=Bowman&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowman|first=John S.|title=The Cambridge Dictionary of American Biography|date=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-521-40258-1|page=607}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born October 4, 1941) is an American author of [[gothic fiction]], [[Christian literature]], and [[erotic literature]].
She is perhaps best known for her series of novels, ''[[The Vampire Chronicles]]'', revolving around the central character of [[Lestat de Lioncourt|Lestat]]. Books from ''The Vampire Chronicles'' were the subject of two film adaptations, ''[[Interview with the Vampire (film)|Interview with the Vampire]]'' in 1994, and ''[[Queen of the Damned (film)|Queen of the Damned]]'' in 2002.

Born in New Orleans, Rice spent much of her early life there before moving to Texas, and later to [[San Francisco]]. She was raised in an observant [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] family, but became an [[agnostic]] as a young adult. She began her professional writing career with the publication of ''[[Interview with the Vampire]]'' in 1976, while living in California, and began writing sequels to the novel in the 1980s. In the mid-2000s, following a publicized return to Catholicism, Rice published the novels ''[[Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt]]'' and ''[[Christ the Lord: The Road to Cana]]'', fictionalized accounts of certain incidents in the life of [[Jesus]]. Several years later she distanced herself from organized Christianity, citing disagreement with the Church's stances on social issues but pledging that faith in God remained "central to [her] life." However, she now considers herself a [[secular humanist]].&lt;ref name="Secular Humanist"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rice|first=Anne|title=Anne Rice|url=https://www.facebook.com/annericefanpage/posts/10151623323420452|publisher=Facebook.com|accessdate=April 26, 2014|date=April 14, 2013|quote=What do the words, "secular humanism," mean to you? Can you explain? (I am a secular humanist myself and I am thankful to be living in what I believe to be a secular humanist country, but I welcome your thoughts on this.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rice's books have sold nearly 100 million copies, placing her among the most popular authors in recent American history.&lt;ref name=Fantastic&gt;{{cite web|title=Anne Rice|url=http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/r/anne-rice/|publisher=FantasticFiction|accessdate=June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="On Conversion"&gt;{{cite web|title=PreachingToday.com &amp; Christianity Today|url=http://www.preachingtoday.com/illustrations/2008/march/10032408.html|publisher=PreachingToday.com &amp; Christianity Today|accessdate=June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While reaction to her early works was initially mixed, she became more popular with critics and readers in the 1980s. Her writing style and the literary content of her works have been deeply analyzed by literary commentators. She was married to poet and painter [[Stan Rice]] for 41 years, from 1961 until his death from brain cancer in 2002 at age 60.&lt;ref name=Phone&gt;{{cite web|last=Rice|first=Anne|title=Phone Message Transcript: December 9, 2002|url=http://www.annerice.com/ph20021209.htm|publisher=Anne Rice|work=AnneRice.com|accessdate=June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stan Obit"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stan Rice Obituary|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?n=stan-rice&amp;pid=646671&amp;fhid=2618|publisher=Legacy.com|accessdate=June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and Stan had two children, Michele, who died of [[leukemia]] at age five, and [[Christopher Rice|Christopher]], who is also an author.

In addition to her vampire novels, Rice has authored books such as ''[[The Feast of All Saints (novel)|The Feast of All Saints]]'' (adapted for television in 2001) and ''[[Servant of the Bones]]'', which formed the basis of a 2011 [[comic book]] miniseries. Several books from ''The Vampire Chronicles'' have been adapted as comics by various publishers. Rice has also authored erotic fiction under the pen names Anne Rampling and A.&amp;nbsp;N.&amp;nbsp;Roquelaure, including ''[[Exit to Eden]]'', which was later adapted into a [[Exit to Eden (film)|1994 film]].

==Early life==

===New Orleans and Texas===
Born on October 4, 1941 in [[New Orleans]], Rice is the second of four daughters of parents of [[Irish American|Irish]] [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] descent, Howard O'Brien and Katherine "Kay" Allen O'Brien.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/donotmigrate/3562792/Anne-Rice-interview-with-the-vampire-writer.html|title=Anne Rice: interview with the vampire writer|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=November 2, 2008|accessdate=September 11, 2010|first=Stuart|last=Husband|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, a Naval veteran of World War II and lifelong resident of New Orleans, worked as a Personnel Executive for the [[U.S. Postal Service]],&lt;ref name="Father Obit" /&gt; and authored one novel, ''The Impulsive Imp'', which was published posthumously.&lt;ref name="Imp review"&gt;{{cite web|title=THE IMPULSIVE IMP by Howard O'Brien|url=http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/indie/howard-obrien/the-impulsive-imp/#review|publisher=Kirkus Reviews|accessdate=June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chamber Imp"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rice|first=Anne|title=The Impulsive Imp|url=http://www.annerice.com/Chamber-Imp.html|publisher=Anne Rice|work=AnneRice.com|accessdate=June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her older sister, [[Alice Borchardt]], later became a noted author of [[fantasy]] and [[horror fiction]].

Rice spent most of her childhood and teenage years in New Orleans, a city that forms the backdrop against which many of her works are set. Her early years were marked by coping with the family's poverty and her mother's alcoholism. She and her family lived in the rented home of her maternal grandmother, Alice Allen, known as "Mamma Allen," at 2301 St. Charles Avenue in the [[Irish Channel, New Orleans|Irish Channel]], which Rice says was widely considered a "Catholic Ghetto".&lt;ref name=Busted&gt;{{cite web|last=McGarvey|first=Bill|title=Busted: Anne Rice|url=http://www.bustedhalo.com/features/busted-anne-rice/2|publisher=Busted Halo|accessdate=June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frommer's"&gt;{{cite web|title=Special-Interest Sightseeing: Anne Rice's New Orleans|url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/neworleans/0020020185.html|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen, who began working as a domestic shortly after separating from her alcoholic husband, was an important early influence in Rice's life, keeping the family and household together as Rice's mother sank deeper into alcoholism. Allen died in 1949, but the O'Briens remained in her home until 1956, when they moved to 2524 St. Charles Avenue, a former rectory, convent, and school owned by the parish, to be closer to both the church and support for Katherine's addiction.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsland 1991, pp. 34-35&lt;/ref&gt; As a young child, Rice studied at St. Alphonsus School, a Catholic institution previously attended by her father.&lt;ref name="Busted" /&gt;

About her unusual given name, Rice said:

{{blockquote|Well, my birth name is Howard Allen because apparently my mother thought it was a good idea to name me Howard. My father's name was Howard, she wanted to name me after Howard, and she thought it was a very interesting thing to do. She was a bit of a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]], a bit of mad woman, a bit of a genius, and a great deal of a great teacher. And she had the idea that naming a woman Howard was going to give that woman an unusual advantage in the world.&lt;ref name=Answered&gt;{{cite web|last=Rice |first=Anne |title=You Asked, Anne Answered |url=http://www.annerice.com/ques_per.htm#howard |publisher=Kith and Kin, LLC. |work=AnneRice.com |accessdate=June 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981205061038/http://www.annerice.com/ques_per.htm |archivedate=December 5, 1998 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, according to the authorized biography ''Prism of the Night'', by [[Katherine Ramsland]], Rice's father was the source of his daughter's birth name: "Thinking back to the days when his own name had been associated with girls, and perhaps in an effort to give it away, Howard named the little girl Howard Allen Frances O'Brien."&lt;ref&gt;Ramsland 1991. p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Rice became "Anne" on her first day of school, when a nun asked her what her name was. She told the nun "Anne," which she considered a pretty name. Her mother, who was with her, let it go without correcting her, knowing how self-conscious her daughter was of her real name. From that day on, everyone she knew addressed her as "Anne",&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|OhzKP9SxSLQ|Interview "Called Out Of Darkness: Part 1: An Anne Rice Memoir" ''annerice.com channel,'' September 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chamber Bio"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rice|first=Anne|title=Biography|url=http://www.annerice.com/Chamber-Biography.html|work=AnneRice.com|publisher=Anne Rice|accessdate=June 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her name was legally changed in 1947.&lt;ref name="Bowman" /&gt; Rice was confirmed in the Catholic Church when she was twelve years old and took the full name Howard Allen Frances Alphonsus Liguori O'Brien, adding the names of a saint and of an aunt, who was a nun. "I was honored to have my aunt's name," she said, "but it was my burden and joy as a child to have strange names."&lt;ref&gt;Ramsland 1991, pp. 28, 44&lt;/ref&gt;

When Rice was fifteen years old, her mother died as a result of alcoholism.&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferraro&gt;{{cite news|last=Ferraro|first=Susan|title=Novels You Can Sink Your Teeth Into|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/14/magazine/novels-you-can-sink-your-teeth-into.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|work=The New York Times Magazine|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=July 3, 2012|date=October 14, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bio Channel"&gt;{{cite web|title=Anne Rice Biography |url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/anne-rice.html |work=Biography |publisher=AETN UK |accessdate=June 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510182154/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/anne-rice.html |archivedate=May 10, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterward, she and her sisters were placed by their father in St. Joseph's Academy. Rice described St. Joseph's as "something out of [[Jane Eyre]] ... a dilapidated, awful, medieval type of place. I really hated it and wanted to leave. I felt betrayed by my father."&lt;ref&gt;Ramsland 1991, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1957, Rice's father married Dorothy Van Bever.&lt;ref name="Father Obit"&gt;{{cite web|title=O Obituaries Orleans Parish Louisiana|url=http://files.usgwarchives.net/la/orleans/obits/1/o-01.txt|work=USGenWeb Archives|publisher=USGenWeb|accessdate=June 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the subject of the couple's first meeting, Rice recalled, "My father wrote her a formal letter inviting her to lunch which I hand-delivered to her house ...

===San Francisco and Berkeley===
Graduating from Richardson High in 1959, Rice completed her freshman year at [[Texas Woman's University]] in [[Denton, Texas|Denton]] and transferred to [[University of North Texas|North Texas State College]] for her sophomore year, but dropped out when she ran out of money and was unable to find employment.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsland 1991, pp. 66-67&lt;/ref&gt; She soon decided to move to [[San Francisco]], and received permission from her friend, Dennis Percy, to stay with his family there until she found work as an insurance claims processor. She persuaded her former roommate from Texas Woman's University, Ginny Mathis, to join her, and they found an apartment in the [[Haight-Ashbury]] district. Mathis acquired a job at the same insurance company as Rice. Soon after, they began taking night courses at [[University of San Francisco]], an all-male [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] school that allowed women to take night courses. For Easter vacation Anne returned home to Texas, rekindling her relationship with Stan Rice. After her return to San Francisco, Stan Rice came for a week-long visit during summer break. He returned to Texas, Rice moved back in with the Percys, and Mathis left San Francisco in August to enroll in a nursing program in Oklahoma. Some time later, Anne received a special delivery letter from Stan Rice asking her to marry him. They married on October 14, 1961, in [[Denton, Texas]], soon after she turned twenty years old, and when he was just weeks from his nineteenth birthday.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsland 1991, pp.67-77&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rices moved back to San Francisco in 1962, experiencing the birth of the [[Hippie]] movement firsthand as they lived in the soon-to-be fabled Haight-Ashbury district, [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], and later the [[The Castro, San Francisco|Castro District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0723351/bio|title=Anne Rice|website=IMDb|access-date=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I'm a totally conservative person," she later told ''[[The New York Times]]'', "In the middle of [[Haight-Ashbury]] in the 1960s, I was typing away while everybody was dropping acid and smoking grass.

However, she soon became disenchanted with the emphasis on literary criticism and the language requirements. In Rice's words, "I wanted to be a writer, not a literature student."&lt;ref name="smalltalk" /&gt;

Rice returned to San Francisco State in 1970 to finish her studies in Creative Writing, and in 1972 graduated with an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] Stan Rice became an instructor at San Francisco State shortly after receiving his own M.A. in Creative Writing from the institution, and later chaired the Creative Writing department before retiring in 1988.&lt;ref name=smalltalk&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/d15d15e4-ede9-11df-8616-00144feab49a.html#axzz1Q9PwBRye "Small talk: Anne Rice]" Anna Metcalfe, ''[[Financial Times]]'' (London), November 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramsland 1991, pp. 112-113&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, while Rice was still in the graduate program, her daughter was diagnosed with acute [[granulocytic leukemia]]. Rice later described having a [[prophetic dream]], months before Michele became ill, that her daughter was dying from "something wrong with her blood."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20100681,00.html "Anne Rice's Imagination May Roam Among Vampires and Erotica, but Her Heart Is Right at Home"] by Joyce Wadler, Johnny Greene, ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', December 5, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 5, 1972, Michele died at [[Lucile Packard Children's Hospital|Stanford Children's Hospital]] in Palo Alto.

Rider Haggard]]{{sfn|Cardin|2015|page=358}} are writers who have influenced her work.

===''Interview with the Vampire''===
In 1973, while still grieving the loss of her daughter, Rice took a previously written short story and [[Fix-up|turned it into]] her first novel, the bestselling ''[[Interview with the Vampire]]''. She based her vampires on [[Gloria Holden]]'s character in ''[[Dracula's Daughter]]'': "It established to me what vampires were—these elegant, tragic, sensitive people. I was really just going with that feeling when writing ''Interview With the Vampire''. I didn't do a lot of research."&lt;ref name="Daily Beast"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stern|first=Marlow|title=Anne Rice on Sparkly Vampires, 'Twilight,' 'True Blood,' and Werewolves|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/11/23/anne-rice-on-sparkly-vampires-twilight-true-blood-and-werewolves.html|work=Book Beast|publisher=The Newsweek/Daily Beast Company LLC|date=November 23, 2011|accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing the novel and following many rejections from publishers, Rice developed [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD). She became obsessed with germs, thinking that she contaminated everything she touched, engaged in frequent and obsessive hand washing and obsessively checked locks on windows and doors. Of this period, Rice says, "What you see when you're in that state is every single flaw in our hygiene and you can't control it and you go crazy."&lt;ref&gt;Ramsland 1991, pp. 157-158&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1974, after a year of therapy for her OCD, Rice attended the [[Squaw Valley Writer's Conference]] at [[Squaw Valley, Placer County, California|Squaw Valley]], conducted by writer [[Ray Nelson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mackay|first=Kathleen|title=The Anne Rice Reader|date=February 11, 1997|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=978-0345402677|url=https://www.amazon.com/Anne-Rice-Reader-Katherine-Ramsland/dp/0345402677/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1398538684&amp;sr=8-2|editor=Ramsland, Katherine|editor-link=Katherine Ramsland|accessdate=April 26, 2014|archiveurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GiIB-SHonYC&amp;pg=PT34&amp;dq=Squaw+Valley+writers+Workshop+1974&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q=Squaw%20Valley%20writers%20Workshop%201974&amp;f=false|archivedate=April 26, 2014|format = Paperback|chapter=A Literary Friendship: Life Is Not A Footrace|quote='I remember what you were wearing,' Anne said recently, recalling our first meeting in August 1974. It was the first night of the weeklong writers' conference at Squaw Valley, California, and we were at a party welcoming us to the writers' community.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at the conference, Rice met her future literary agent, Phyllis Seidel. In October 1974, Seidel sold the publishing rights to ''Interview with the Vampire'' to [[Alfred A. Knopf]] for a $12,000 advance of the hardcover rights, at a time when most new authors were receiving $2,000 advances.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsland 1991, pp. 159-160&lt;/ref&gt; ''Interview with the Vampire'' was published in May 1976. In 1977, the Rices traveled to both Europe and Egypt for the first time.&lt;ref name="Bio Channel" /&gt;

===Other works===
Following the publication of ''Interview with the Vampire'', while living in California, Rice wrote two historical novels, ''[[The Feast of All Saints (novel)|The Feast of All Saints]]'' and ''[[Cry to Heaven]]'', along with [[The Sleeping Beauty Trilogy|four erotic novels]] (''[[The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty]]'', ''[[Beauty's Punishment]]'', and ''[[Beauty's Release]]'') under the pseudonym A. N. Roquelaure, and two more under the pseudonym Anne Rampling (''[[Exit to Eden]]'' and ''[[Belinda (Anne Rice novel)|Belinda]]''). Rice then returned to the vampire genre with ''[[The Vampire Lestat]]'' and ''[[The Queen of the Damned]]'', her bestselling sequels to ''Interview with the Vampire''.

Shortly after her June 1988 return to New Orleans, Rice penned ''[[The Witching Hour (novel)|The Witching Hour]]'' as an expression of her joy at coming home. Rice also continued her popular ''[[Vampire Chronicles]]'' series, which later grew to encompass ten novels, and followed up on ''The Witching Hour'' with ''[[Lasher]]'' and ''[[Taltos (Rice novel)|Taltos]]'', completing the ''[[Lives of the Mayfair Witches]]'' trilogy. She also published ''[[Violin (novel)|Violin]]'', a tale of a ghostly haunting, in 1997.&lt;ref name="Ramsland312-317"&gt;Ramsland 1991, pp. 312-317&lt;/ref&gt;

Rice calls ''Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt'', published in 2005, the beginning of a series chronicling the life of [[Jesus]]. The second volume, ''[[Christ the Lord: The Road to Cana]]'', was published in March 2008. The third book in the series, ''Christ the Lord: Kingdom of Heaven'', has been postponed.

After moving to [[Rancho Mirage, California]], in December 2005, Rice wrote ''Christ the Lord: The Road to Cana'', ''[[Angel Time]]'', and ''[[Of Love and Evil]]'' (the latter two being the first two books in her ''Songs of the Seraphim'' series), in addition to her memoir, ''Called Out of Darkness: A Spiritual Confession''.

On March 9, 2014, Rice announced on her son Christopher's radio show, "The Dinner Party with Christopher Rice and Eric Shaw Quinn", that she had completed another book in the ''Vampire Chronicles'', titled, ''[[Prince Lestat]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/84069/prince-lestat-book/ Prince Lestat (Book)]&lt;/ref&gt; a "true sequel" to ''Queen of the Damned''.

==Reception and analysis==
Following its debut in 1976, ''[[Interview with the Vampire]]'' received many negative reviews from critics, causing Rice to retreat temporarily from the supernatural genre.&lt;ref name="Ferraro" /&gt; When ''[[The Vampire Lestat]]'' debuted in 1985, reaction&amp;mdash;both from critics and from readers&amp;mdash;was more positive, and the first [[hardcover]] edition of the book sold 75,000 copies.&lt;ref name="Ferraro" /&gt; Upon its publication in 1988, ''[[The Queen of the Damned]]'' was given an initial hardcover printing of 405,000 copies.&lt;ref name="Ferraro" /&gt; The novel was a main selection of the [[Literary Guild|Literary Guild of America]] for 1988,&lt;ref name=Hunter&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Jeffrey W.|title=Contemporary Literary Criticism|volume=128|date=2000|publisher=Gale Cengage|isbn=0787632031}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reached the #1 spot on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]], staying on the list for more than four months.&lt;ref name="Ferraro" /&gt;

Rice's novels are popular among many members of the [[LGBT]] community, some of whom have perceived her vampire characters as [[Allegory|allegorical]] symbols of isolation and social alienation.&lt;ref name="Ferraro" /&gt; Similarly, a reviewer writing for ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' observed that the vampires of her novels represent "the walking alienated, those of us who, by choice or not, dwell on the fringe."&lt;ref name="Day 2002, p. 43"&gt;Day 2002, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; On the subject, Rice herself commented, "From the beginning, I've had gay fans, and gay readers who felt that my works involved a sustained gay allegory ... I didn't set out to do that, but that was what they perceived. So even when Christopher was a little baby, I had gay readers and gay friends and knew gay people, and lived in the Castro district of San Francisco, which was a gay neighborhood."&lt;ref name=NPR /&gt;

Rice's writings have also been identified as having had a major impact on later developments within the genre of [[Vampire literature|vampire fiction]].&lt;ref name="Day 2002, p. 43"/&gt; "Rice turns vampire conventions inside out," writes Susan Ferraro of ''The New York Times''. "Because Rice identifies with the vampire instead of the victim (reversing the usual focus), the horror for the reader springs from the realization of the monster within the self. Moreover, Rice's vampires are loquacious philosophers who spend much of eternity debating the nature of good and evil."&lt;ref name="Ferraro"/&gt;

In addition, Rice's writing style has been heavily analyzed.&lt;ref name="Hunter" /&gt; Ferraro, in a statement typical of many reviewers, describes her prose as "florid, both lurid and lyrical, and full of sensuous detail". However, others have criticized Rice's writing style as both verbose and overly philosophical.&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt; Author William Patrick Day comments that her writing is often "long, convoluted, and imprecise".&lt;ref&gt;Day 2002, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

===Back to New Orleans and Catholicism===
In June 1988, following the success of ''The Vampire Lestat'' and with ''The Queen of the Damned'' about to be published, the Rices purchased a second home in New Orleans, the Brevard-Rice House, built in 1857 for Albert Hamilton Brevard. Stan took a leave of absence from his teaching, and together they moved to New Orleans. Within months, they decided to make it their permanent home.&lt;ref name="Ramsland312-317"/&gt;

Rice returned to the Catholic Church in 1998 after decades of [[atheism]]. On December 14, 1998, she fell into a coma, later determined to be caused by [[diabetic ketoacidosis]] (DKA), and nearly died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/DrJohnson/story?id=127735|work=ABC|title=Anne Rice Says Diabetes Nearly Killed Her|author=Staff|date=June 26, 2004|accessdate=January 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was later diagnosed with [[Diabetes mellitus type 1]], and is now insulin-dependent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.annerice.com/msg020199.htm Anne Rice telephone message to fans about diabetic coma] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926220443/http://www.annerice.com/msg020199.htm |date=September 26, 2011 }} ''annerice.com,'' February 1, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Anne.

In 2004, Rice nearly died again from an intestinal blockage or [[bowel obstruction]], a common complication of [[gastric bypass surgery]]. In 2005, ''[[Newsweek]]'' reported, "[Rice] came close to death last year, when she had surgery for an intestinal blockage, and also back in 1998, when she went into a sudden diabetic coma; that same year she returned to the Roman Catholic Church, which she'd left at 18."&lt;ref&gt;Gates, David. [http://www.newsweek.com/id/50735 "The Gospel According to Anne"] ''Newsweek'', October 31, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Her return did not come with a full embrace of the Church's stances on social issues; Rice remained a vocal supporter of equality for gay men and lesbians (including [[Same-sex marriage|marriage rights]]), as well as [[abortion]] rights and [[birth control]],&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Anne-Marie. [http://articles.latimes.com/2005/dec/26/entertainment/et-rice26 "Twists of faith; Anne Rice's vision of Christianity is reflected in her new book"] ''Los Angeles Times'', December 26, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; writing extensively on such issues. In October 2005, while promoting her book, ''[[Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt]]'', she announced in ''Newsweek'' that she would now use her life and talent of writing to glorify her belief in God, but did not renounce her earlier works.

In the Author's Note from ''Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt'', Rice states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I had experienced an old-fashioned, strict Roman Catholic childhood in the 1940s and 1950s ... we attended daily Mass and Communion in an enormous and magnificently decorated church.... Stained-glass windows, the Latin Mass, the detailed answers to complex questions on good and evil—these things were imprinted on my soul forever....

I left this church at age 18.... I wanted to know what was happening, why so many seemingly good people didn't believe in any organized religion yet cared passionately about their behavior and value of their lives.... I broke with the church.... I wrote many novels that without my being aware that they reflected my quest for meaning in a world without God.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Anne (2008).

In her memoir ''Called Out of Darkness: A Spiritual Confession'', Rice also states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the moment of surrender, I let go of all the theological or social questions which had kept me from [God] for countless years. I simply let them go. There was the sense, profound and wordless, that if He knew everything I did not have to know everything, and that, in seeking to know everything, I'd been, all of my life, missing the entire point. No social paradox, no historic disaster, no hideous record of injustice or misery should keep me from Him. No question of Scriptural integrity, no torment over the fate of this or that atheist or gay friend, no worry for those condemned and ostracized by my church or any other church should stand between me and Him. The reason? It was magnificently simple: He knew how or why everything happened; He knew the disposition of every single soul. He wasn't going to let anything happen by accident! Nobody was going to go to Hell by mistake.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Anne (2005). ''Called Out of Darkness: A Spiritual Confession''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. p. 183. {{ISBN|978-0-307-26827-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Leaving New Orleans===
On January 18, 2004, Rice announced on her website that she had made plans to leave New Orleans.&lt;ref name=LeaveNewOrleans&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.annerice.com/feature.htm |title=Anne Rice announces she is leaving New Orleans, ''annerice.com,'' January 18, 2004 |accessdate=2004-04-13 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040413012039/http://www.annerice.com/feature.htm |archivedate=April 13, 2004 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; She cited living alone since the death of her husband and her son moving to California as the reasons for her move.

After leaving New Orleans, Rice settled first in [[La Jolla]], California.

On July 18, 2010, Rice auctioned off her large collection of antique dolls&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=Z4QXDxp1SGo|title=Anne Rice Doll Collection}}, ''annerice.com YouTube channel,'' November 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; at Thierault's in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collectdolls.about.com/od/dollcollectingresources/a/annriceinterview.htm|title="Celebrated Author Anne Rice Discusses Her Beloved Doll Collection And Its Sale," ''About.com''|author=Denise Van Patten|work=About}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in mid-2010 and continuing through early 2011, Rice also began auctioning off her household possessions, collectibles featured in her many books, jewelry, and wardrobe on [[eBay]].&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Kellogg|first=Carolyn|title=Going fast: Anne Rice's Ebay auction|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2011/03/anne-rices-ebay-auction.html|work=Los Angeles Times Blog|publisher=Tribune Company|accessdate=July 3, 2012|date=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also sold a large portion of her library collection to Powell's Books.&lt;ref name=PortlandBusiness&gt;{{cite news|last=Giegerich|first=Andy|title=Powell's Books buys Anne Rice collection|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/news/2010/10/26/powells-books-buys-anne-rice-collection.html|accessdate=July 1, 2012|newspaper=Portland Business Journal|date=October 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distancing from Christianity===
On July 28, 2010, Rice publicly announced her disdain for the current state of Christianity on her Facebook page, stating, "Today I quit being a Christian.... I remain committed to Christ as always but not to being 'Christian' or to being part of Christianity. It's simply impossible for me to 'belong' to this quarrelsome, hostile, disputatious, and deservedly infamous group. For ten years, I've tried. I've failed. I'm an outsider. My conscience will allow nothing else."&lt;ref name="PN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishednow.net/2010/anne-rice-no-longer-christian/ |title=''Anne Rice no longer Christian'' on publishednow.net |accessdate=2010-08-02 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802142634/http://www.publishednow.net/2010/anne-rice-no-longer-christian/ |archivedate=August 2, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HuffPost1&gt;{{cite news|last=Kunhardt|first=Jessie|title=Anne Rice: 'I Quit Being A Christian'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/29/anne-rice-i-quit-being-a_n_663915.html|work=The Huffington Post|publisher=TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.|accessdate=July 1, 2012|date=July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, she clarified her statement: "My faith in Christ is central to my life. My conversion from a pessimistic atheist lost in a world I didn't understand, to an optimistic believer in a universe created and sustained by a loving God is crucial to me. But following Christ does not mean following His followers. Christ is infinitely more important than Christianity and always will be, no matter what Christianity is, has been, or might become."&lt;ref&gt;[http://marquee.blogs.cnn.com/2010/07/30/anne-rice-leaves-christianity/?iref=NS1 "Anne Rice leaves Christianity" on CNN's Marquee Blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following her announcement, Rice's critique of Christianity was commented upon by numerous journalists and pundits.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite web|title=Writer Anne Rice: 'Today I Quit Being A Christian'|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128930526|work=NPR.org|publisher=NPR|accessdate=July 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Grossman&gt;{{cite news|last=Grossman|first=Cathy Lynn|title=Novelist Anne Rice ditches Christianity for Christ|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/Religion/post/2010/07/anne-rice-catholic-/1#.T--rvvWT4x4|work=USA TODAY|publisher=Gannett Co. Inc.|accessdate=July 1, 2012|date=July 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with the ''Los Angeles Times'', Rice elaborated on her view regarding being a member of a Christian church: "I feel much more morally comfortable walking away from organized religion. I respect that there are all kinds of denominations and all kinds of churches, but it's the entire controversy, the entire conversation that I need to walk away from right now."&lt;ref name="ML"&gt;Mitchell Landsberg, [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-beliefs-anne-rice-20100807,0,5152082.story "Anne Rice discusses her decision to quit Christianity."] Los Angeles Times. August 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the question, "how do you follow Christ without a church?" Rice replied: "I think the basic ritual is simply prayer. It's talking to God, putting things in the hands of God, trusting that you're living in God's world and praying for God's guidance. And being absolutely faithful to the core principles of Jesus' teachings."&lt;ref name="ML"/&gt; In 2011, Rice participated in the "I Am Second" project, with a short documentary about her spiritual journey. On April 14, 2013, Rice stated in a [[Facebook]] post that she was a [[secular humanist]].&lt;ref name="Secular Humanist"/&gt;  On July 28, 2014, Rice stated in a [[Facebook]] post that Christ is still central to her life, but not in the way he is presented by organized religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128930526|title=Writer Anne Rice: 'Today I Quit Being A Christian'|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-08-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7074806/alice-cooper-interviews-anne-rice|title=Alice Cooper Interviews Anne Rice on Religion, Vampires, Tom Cruise &amp; Pot|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==

===Film===
In 1994, [[Neil Jordan]] directed a [[Interview with the Vampire (film)|motion picture adaptation of ''Interview with the Vampire'']], based on Rice's own screenplay. The movie starred [[Tom Cruise]] as [[Lestat de Lioncourt|Lestat]], [[Brad Pitt]] as the guilt-ridden [[Louis de Pointe du Lac|Louis]], and a young [[Kirsten Dunst]] in her breakout role as the deceitful child vampire [[Claudia (The Vampire Chronicles)|Claudia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110148/?ref_=nv_sr_2|accessdate=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second film adaptation, ''[[Queen of the Damned (film)|Queen of the Damned]],'' was released in February 2002, starring [[Stuart Townsend]] as the vampire Lestat and singer [[Aaliyah]] as [[List of The Vampire Chronicles characters#Akasha|Akasha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Queen of the Damned (2002)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238546/?ref_=nv_sr_8|accessdate=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie combined plot points from both the novel ''The Queen of the Damned'', as well as from ''The Vampire Lestat''. Produced on a budget of $35 million, the film recouped only $30 million at the U.S. box office. On her [[Facebook]] page, Rice distanced herself from the film, and has stated that she feels the filmmakers "mutilated" her work in adapting the novel.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Anne: [https://www.facebook.com/home.php#/pages/Anne-Rice/66435815451?ref=nf Wall - Just Fans], Facebook.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1994 film ''[[Exit to Eden (film)|Exit to Eden]],'' based loosely on the book Rice published as Anne Rampling, starred [[Rosie O'Donnell]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]]. The work was transformed from a [[BDSM]]-themed love story into a police comedy, and was widely considered a box-office failure, receiving near-universal negative reviews.&lt;ref name="Exit Rotten"&gt;{{cite web|title=Exit to Eden (1994)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/exit_to_eden/|work=Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Flixster, Inc.|accessdate=June 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A film adaptation of ''[[Christ the Lord (film)|Christ the Lord]]'' was reported to be in the early stages of development in February 2012. It was reported that [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] had signed on to produce, and that [[Cyrus Nowrasteh]] had already completed the script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Herr |first=Claudia |url= http://www.wordandfilm.com/2012/01/christ-the-lord-coming-to-theaters-with-anne-rice-blessing/|title=Christ the Lord Coming to Theaters, with Anne Rice's Blessing |date=January 19, 2012 |work=Wordandfilm.com |publisher= Word &amp; Film|accessdate=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 8, 2014, during an interview with her long-time editor, Victoria Wilson, at the Chicago Humanities Festival, Rice revealed that filming had finished on the movie and was going into post-production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZMmnoRQB8g|work=[[YouTube]]|title=Anne Rice: Vampire Chronicler}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, titled ''[[The Young Messiah (film)|The Young Messiah]]'', was released in 2016.

In August 2014, [[Universal Pictures]] had acquired the rights to Rice's ''Vampire Chronicles''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/anne-rices-vampire-chronicles-takes-flight-at-universal-1201278069/|title=Anne Rice's 'Vampire Chronicles' Takes Flight at Universal|work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in November 2016, when [[Universal Pictures]] did not renew the contract, the film and television rights reverted to Rice, who began developing ''[[The Vampire Chronicles]]'' into a television series with her son, [[Christopher Rice|Christopher]].&lt;ref name="Rice"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/annericefanpage/posts/10154794260300452 |title=Anne Rice statement on her Official Facebook Fan Page |last=Rice |first=Anne |date=27 November 2016 |access-date=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/11/anne-rice-vampire-chronicles-tv-show|title=Anne Rice Is Bringing Her Vampire Chronicles to Television|publisher=Vanity Fair|date=27 November 2016|access-date=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
In 1997, Rice wrote the story for a television pilot entitled ''Rag and Bone'', featuring elements of both horror and [[crime fiction]]. Screenwriter James D. Parriott penned the screenplay, and the pilot ultimately aired on [[CBS]], starring [[Dean Cain]] and [[Robert Patrick]].&lt;ref name=Radiotimes&gt;{{cite web|last=Parkinson|first=David|title=Rag and Bone|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/film/jjx29/rag-and-bone|work=radiotimes.com|publisher=Immediate Media Company Limited|accessdate=June 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Feast of All Saints (novel)|The Feast of All Saints]]'' was made into a [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] original miniseries in 2001, directed by [[Peter Medak]] and starring [[James Earl Jones]] and [[Gloria Reuben]].&lt;ref name="MSN.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Feast of All Saints: Overview|url=http://movies.msn.com/movies/movie/the-feast-of-all-saints/|work=MSN.com|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=June 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2001/tv/reviews/anne-rice-s-the-feast-of-all-saints-1200552927/|title=Review: ‘Anne Rice’s The Feast of All Saints’|last=Fries|first=Laura|date=2001-11-08|work=Variety|access-date=2017-08-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2002, [[NBC]] had plans to adapt Rice's ''Lives of the Mayfair Witches'' trilogy into a miniseries, but the project never entered production.&lt;ref name=Mania&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Christopher Allan |title=NBC planning huge Anne Rice MAYFAIR series |url=http://www.mania.com/nbc-planning-huge-anne-rice-mayfair-series_article_34486.html |publisher=Mania |accessdate=June 23, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130230626/http://www.mania.com/nbc-planning-huge-anne-rice-mayfair-series_article_34486.html |archivedate=November 30, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 26, 2016, Rice announced in a personal statement on her Facebook page that the film and television rights to the entire ''Vampire Chronicles'' franchise had reverted to her and that she and her son, novelist Christopher Rice, would be "developing a pilot script and a detailed outline for an open-ended series faithfully presenting Lestat’s story as it is told in the books, complete with many situations that readers expect to see." &lt;ref name="Rice"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/11/26/anne-rice-plotting-vampire-chronicles-tv-series-adaptation&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 28, 2017, Rice released on her Facebook page the press released stating that the Vampire Chronicles have been optioned by [[Paramount Television]] and [[Anonymous Content]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moore|first=Debi|title=Anne Rice’s The Vampire Chronicles Optioned by Paramount Television and Anonymous Content|url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/226098/anne-rices-vampire-chronicles-optioned-paramount-television-anonymous-content/|publisher=Dread Central|accessdate=April 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre===
On April 25, 2006, the musical ''[[Lestat (musical)|Lestat]]'', based on Rice's ''Vampire Chronicles'' books, opened at the [[Palace Theatre, New York|Palace Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] after having its world premiere in [[San Francisco, California]], in December 2005. With music by [[Elton John]] and lyrics by [[Bernie Taupin]], it was the inaugural production of the newly established Warner Brothers Theatre Ventures. Despite Rice's own overwhelming approval and praise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.annerice.com/Lestat-TheMusical.html|title=''Lestat on Broadway on annerice.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt; the show received disappointing attendance and largely negative reviews from critics.&lt;ref name=LestatBBC&gt;{{cite news|last=Brook|first=Tom|title=Disappointing start for Elton musical|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4946032.stm|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=July 1, 2012|date=April 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LestatBBC2&gt;{{cite news|title=Critics lay into Elton's musical|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4941488.stm|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=July 1, 2012|date=April 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lestat'' closed a month later on May 28, 2006, after just 33 previews and 39 regular performances.

===Fan fiction===
{{See also|Legal issues with fan fiction}}
Rice initially expressed an adamant stance against [[fan fiction]] based on her works, and particularly in opposition to such fiction based on ''The Vampire Chronicles'', releasing a statement on April 7, 2000, that disallowed all such efforts, citing [[copyright]] issues.&lt;ref name=fanfic&gt;{{cite web|last=Rice |first=Anne |title=Important Message from Anne on "Fan Fiction" |url=http://www.annerice.com/ |publisher=Kith and Kin, LLC. |accessdate=June 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602212951/http://annerice.com/ |archivedate=June 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She subsequently requested that [[FanFiction.Net]] remove stories featuring her characters.&lt;ref name="Pauli"&gt;{{cite news|first=Michelle|last=Pauli|title=Working the web: Fan fiction|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=December 5, 2002|accessdate=July 22, 2011|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/generalfiction/story/0,,853553,00.html|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' reported that Rice developed a milder stance on the issue. "I got upset about 20 years ago because I thought it would block me," she said. "However, it's been very easy to avoid reading any, so live and let live. If I were a young writer, I'd want to own my own ideas. But maybe fan fiction is a transitional phase: whatever gets you there, gets you there."&lt;ref name="Metro"&gt;{{cite web|title=How fan fiction is conquering the internet and shooting up book charts|publisher=''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]''|date=November 11, 2012|accessdate=April 14, 2013|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/lifestyle/917580-how-fan-fiction-is-conquering-the-internet-and-shooting-up-book-charts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Antionah''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|t|i|ˈ|ɒ|n|ə}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «ăn-tē-än´a»&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Nephite]] ruler that lived on the American continent in the 1st century BC.  He is mentioned briefly in the 12th chapter of the [[Book of Alma]].  He was a ruler in the wicked city of [[Ammonihah]], and was skeptical of [[Alma the Younger|Alma]] and [[Amulek]]'s teachings regarding the [[resurrection]].  Though there were some who believed the teachings of these two prophets, the city of Ammonihah eventually rejected them, and according to the Book of Mormon narrative, was destroyed by the [[Lamanites]] as divine punishment.

As a spiritual healer practicing into the 1920s, Aua provided perspective on [[Inuit mythology]] at a time when it was being subsumed by the introduction of  Christianity. Aua told the story of his cousin's mother [[Uvavnuk]], whose song "The Great Earth" is still popular.

Aua was married to Orulo and they had four children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/stories/article/65674taissumani_nov._11/ Knud Rasmussen and the Iglulik Inuit, Part 5]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=al6YAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT7&amp;lpg=PT7&amp;dq=Aua+shaman&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_znbBIFXuy&amp;sig=xa53QzAi6xMuqfZo9x1jujXDVZs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhoo7-sIzMAhVGbSYKHVlJC5EQ6AEIRzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Aua%20shaman&amp;f=false Shamanism As a Spiritual Practice for Daily Life]&lt;/ref&gt;

His encounters with the Danish explorer were fictionalised in the 2006 film ''[[The Journals of Knud Rasmussen]]'', by the Inuit team who had produced ''[[Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner]]''.

== Early period ==

=== Russian Empire ===

In the beginning of the earliest phase, the religion had strong connections with Azerbaijan during the [[History of Azerbaijan#Russian rule|Russian rule in Azerbaijan]] in the [[Russian Empire]]. Among the most notable facts is a woman of Azerbaijani background who would play a central role in the religion of the [[Báb]], viewed by Bahá´ís as the direct predecessor of the Bahá'í Faith – she would be later named [[Tahirih]], though her story would be in the context of Persia.&lt;ref name="hist" /&gt; She was among the [[Letters of the Living]] of the Báb.

In 1847, the Russian ambassador to [[Tehran]], Prince [[Dimitri Ivanovich Dolgorukov]], and other diplomats became aware of the claims of the Báb and seeing the fleeing of Bábís across the border requested that the Báb, then imprisoned at [[Maku, Iran|Maku]], be moved elsewhere; he also condemned the massacres of Iranian religionists.{{who|date=November 2016}}&lt;ref name="russia" /&gt;{{failed verification|date=November 2016}}&lt;ref name="statement" /&gt; Dolgorukov wrote some memoirs later in life but much of it has been shown to be a forgery. But his dispatches show that he was afraid of the movement spreading into the [[Caucasus]].&lt;ref name="momenjournal"&gt;{{citation |last = Momen | year = 2004 | first = Moojan | title = Conspiracies and Forgeries: the attack upon the Baha'i community in Iran | journal = Persian Heritage | volume = 9 | issue = 35 | pages = 27–29|url=http://bahai-library.com/pdf/m/momen_conspiracies_forgeries.pdf|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last = Balyuzi |first = H.M. |authorlink = Hasan M.

In 1852, after a failed assassination attempt against the Shah of Persia for which the entire Bábí community was blamed, many Bábís, including Bahá'u'lláh, who had no role in the attempt and later severely condemned it, were arrested in a sweep.&lt;ref name="balyuzi77"&gt;{{citation |last = Balyuzi|first = H.M. |authorlink = Hasan M.

Bahá'u'lláh's family asked Mírzá Majid to go to Dolgorukov and ask him to intercede on behalf of Bahá'u'lláh, and Dolgorukov agreed however this assistance was short lived and again the memoirs are known to have many impossible dates in them. In addition, Bahá'u'lláh refused exile in Russia.&lt;ref name="Warburg"&gt;{{cite book | last =Warburg | first =Margit | editor-last = Hanegraaff | editor-first =W.J. | editor2-last =Kumar | editor2-first = P.P. | title =Citizens of the World; A History and Sociology of the Baha'is from a Globalization Perspective | publisher =Koninklijke Brill NV | series =Numen Book Series Studies in the History of Religions | volume =106| year = 2006 | location = | pages = 34–35, 147 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=tAvXAAAAMAAJ| isbn =978-90-04-14373-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[God Passes By]], [[Shoghi Effendi]] alludes to the protection the Russian ambassador gave Bahá'u'lláh on different occasions, first after the attempted assassination of [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]] and again after the decision to exile Bahá’u’lláh from Iran, expressing his "desire to take Bahá’u’lláh under the protection of his government, and offered to extend every facility for His removal to Russia."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1944 |page=71 |title=God Passes By |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-020-9 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-6.html#pg71 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Effendi 1944 106"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1944 |page=106 |title=God Passes By |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-020-9 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-6.html#pg106 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1866, while in Adrianople, Bahá'u'lláh started writing a series of letters to world rulers, proclaiming his station as the promised one of all religions.&lt;ref name="iranica_bahaullah"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Iranica |year= 1989|article=Baha'-allah | first = Juan | last = Cole}}&lt;/ref&gt; His letters also asked them to renounce their material possessions, work together to settle disputes, and endeavour towards the betterment of the world and its peoples. Czar [[Alexander II of Russia]] was among them.&lt;ref name="iranica_bahaullah" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;“O Czar of Russia! Incline thine ear unto the voice of God, the King, the Holy, and turn thou unto Paradise, the Spot wherein abideth He Who, among the Concourse on high, beareth the most excellent titles, and Who, in the kingdom of creation, is called by the name of God, the Effulgent, the All-Glorious. Beware that nothing deter thee from setting thy face towards thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Most Merciful.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bahai-studies.ca/journal/files/jbs/8.4%20Buck.pdf A Symbolic Profile of the Bahá’í Faith*] by Christopher Buck, ''Journal of Bahá’í Studies'' Vol. 8, number 4 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his [[Summons of the Lord of Hosts#Súriy-i-Haykal (Tablet of the Temple)|Súriy-i-Haykal]], Bahá’u’lláh included the Lawh-i-Malik-i-Rús, praising Czar [[Alexander II of Russia]] in these terms: "when this Wronged One was sore-afflicted in prison, the minister of the highly esteemed government (of Russia)—may God, glorified and exalted be He, assist him!—exerted his utmost endeavor to compass My deliverance. Several times permission for My release was granted. Some of the ‘ulamás of the city, however, would prevent it. Finally, My freedom was gained through the solicitude and the endeavor of His Excellency the Minister. …His Imperial Majesty, the Most Great Emperor—may God, exalted and glorified be He, assist him!—extended to Me for the sake of God his protection—a protection which has excited the envy and enmity of the foolish ones of the earth."&lt;ref name="Effendi 1944 106"/&gt;

The text of the letter from Bahá'u'lláh to the Shah carried by [[Badí‘]] was sent to Russian scholars by Russian diplomats and a catalog of works made its way to [[E.G. Browne]] awakening his interests.&lt;ref name="hass" /&gt; A few scholars in St. Petersburg reviewed Babí activities including the arrest and banishment of a Bábí to [[Smolensk]].

While the Bahá'í Faith spread across the [[Russian Empire]] in the late 1800s and early 1900s,&lt;ref name="russia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="statement" /&gt; and attracted the attention of scholars and artists,&lt;ref name="hass" /&gt; the Bahá'í community in Ashgabat built the first [[Bahá'í House of Worship]], elected one of the first Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly|local administrative institutions]] and was a center of scholarship.

Early 1900s Russian Orthodox missionaries shared warnings against the religion, asserting that it violated 'the feelings of loyalty towards the Russian White Czar'&lt;ref name="Kolarz"&gt;{{cite book| last =Kolarz | first = Walter | authorlink =Walter Kolarz | title =Religion in the Soviet Union |publisher =St. Martin's Press | series =Armenian Research Center collection | year = 1962 | pages = 470–473 {{Subscription required|via=[[Questia]]}}|url =https://www.questia.com/read/419296/religion-in-the-soviet-union| isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the law of the land made it illegal for Russians to convert from Christianity to another religion.&lt;ref name="hass" /&gt;

There are several references to translations being undertaken of works into Russian in 1927&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Publishing Committee Report |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1927 |pages=9–10| url = | issue = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as correspondence with Bahá'ís in Moscow and Ashgabat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Foreign Assembly Letters |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=August 1927 | page =6| url = | issue = 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of Bábís formed in [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]] and spread before 1850&lt;ref name="azer2"&gt;{{Citation|last=Balci |first=Bayram |last2=Jafarov |first2=Azer |title=The Baha’is of the Caucasus: From Russian Tolerance to Soviet Repression {2/3} |newspaper=Caucaz.com |pages= |date=2007-02-21 |url=http://www.caucaz.com/home_eng/breve_contenu.php?id=300 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524000119/http://www.caucaz.com/home_eng/breve_contenu.php?id=300 |archivedate=May 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; largely of Persian expatriates who were fleeing persecution in Persia.&lt;ref name="hass" /&gt; This group was attacked by the Russian army, under the command of General [[Vasili Bebutov]].&lt;ref name="azer2" /&gt;

From 1850 on, small communities established themselves in elsewhere in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name="azer2" /&gt; Soon the community of Baku counted the largest number of believers in the region and in 1860 obtained official recognition from the authorities. The community recognized the newly announced position of Bahá'u'lláh. Soon there was more public awareness and some favor from leaders of the broader community and at the same time the Bahá'í community of Baku broadened its communication with other Bahá'í communities in [[Russia]], [[Bahá'í Faith in Turkey|Turkey]] and [[Bahá'í Faith in Turkmenistan|Ashkhabad]] and did much work printing materials in [[Turkish language|Turkish]].&lt;ref name="Walbridge"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Walbridge|first = John | title = Chapter Four - The Baha’i Faith in Turkey | journal = Occasional Papers in Shaykhi, Babi and Baha'i Studies | volume = 06 |issue = 01 | date = March 2002 | url = http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/bhpapers/vol6/waless/chap4.htm | doi = | id =| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most publicly recognized member of the community approaching 1900 was [[Musa Nagiyev]], one of Azerbaijan's richest citizens of the times&lt;ref name="azer2" /&gt; though there were many public figures before and after who seem to have admired the religion or even been members of it.&lt;ref name="hist" /&gt;

Similarly there were developments in to the north of Russian control.

{{main|Bahá'í Faith in Turkmenistan|Bahá'í Faith in Uzbekistan}}

The Bahá'í Faith in Turkmenistan begins before [[Russia]]n advances into the region when the area was under the influence of [[Persia]].&lt;ref name="momen" /&gt; By 1887 a community of Bahá'í refugees from [[religious violence]] in Persia had made something of a village in [[Ashgabat]].&lt;ref name="momen" /&gt; Several years later — by 1894 — Russia made [[Turkmenistan]] part of the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref name="russia" /&gt;

Initially Russian diplomats observed the community as distinct from the Moslem one but being “closely knit community of honest, law-abiding people, somewhat reminiscent of the early Christian churches in the first century after Christ.”&lt;ref name="hass" /&gt;

During that narrow period of time between 1887 and 1894, a court case was held following the assassination of a Bahá'í that for a time would vindicate the Bahá'ís. The Bahá'ís were represented by [[Mirza Abu'l-Fadl|Mirza Abu'l-Fadl Gulpaygani]] along with [[Shaykh Muhammad-'Alí]], each an [[Apostles of Bahá'u'lláh|Apostle of Bahá'u'lláh]],&lt;ref name="hass" /&gt; individuals who played a vital role in the development in the early stages of the religion comparable to the apostles of Jesus. Gulpaygani lived in Ashgabat off and on from 1889 to 1894. A short time after moving there, the assassination of one of the Bahá'ís there, [[Haji Muhammad Rida Isfahani]] occurred and Gulpaygani helped the Bahá'í community to respond to this event and later he was the spokesman for the Bahá'ís at the trial of the assassins was initiated by Czar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] through a military commission from St. Petersburg.&lt;ref name="CoL"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = City of Love, by Bruce Whitemore|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1975 |pages=6–12| url = | issue = 52.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event established the independence of the Bahá'í Faith from [[Islam]] both for the Russian government and for the people of Ashgabat.&lt;ref name="momen" /&gt; Under the protection and freedom given by the Russian authorities, the number of Bahá'ís in the community rose to 4,000 (1,000 children) by 1918 and for the first time anywhere in the world a true Bahá'í community was established, with its own hospitals, schools, workshops, newspapers,&lt;ref name="azer2" /&gt; and a cemetery.&lt;ref name="momen" /&gt; This first [[Bahá'í House of Worship]] was constructed inside the city of Ashgabat. The design of the building was started in 1902, and the construction was completed in 1908 and was supervised by [[Vakílu'd-Dawlih]],&lt;ref name="iranica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Iranica |year= 1989|article=Bahai temples | first = V. | last = Rafati |author2=Sahba, F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's general population was between 44 and 50 thousand at this time.&lt;ref name="ashg"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Momen | first = Moojan| authorlink = Moojan Momen|author2=ed.

Within the lifetime of Bahá'u'lláh, the religion was established in [[Samarkand]], Uzbekistan, then under [[History of Uzbekistan (1876–1991)#Russian conquest|Russian control]].&lt;ref name="hass" /&gt; While in Samarkand in 1892 Gulpaygani wrote a book, ''Fassl-ul-Khitab'' (Conclusive Proof), in response to the questions of Mirza Haydar-Ali of Tabriz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = ibn-Kalanter | first = Ish'te'a'l | title = Mirza Abdul-Fazl | journal = Star of the West | volume = 14 | issue = 19| pages = 318–9 | publisher = | location = | date = March 2, 1914 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rw4YAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=RA9-PA318&amp;ots=FXCOyKPeYI&amp;pg=RA9-PA318#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2010-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in Samarkand, too, that he debated a Protestant preacher. In 1910 the Samarkand Bahá'í community elected its first assembly in addition to having a school, and built a center which held four meetings a week.

In [[Tashkand]], a community of Bahá'ís had expanded to about 1900 members, supporting a library, Persian and Russian language schools, and large meetings were being advertised with the permission of government authorities.&lt;ref name="hass" /&gt; Bahá'í literature published in Tashkand included several works of [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the next head of the religion.

After the death of Gulpaygani, his papers, including several unfinished works, were taken to Ashqabat, where his nephew lived; many of these papers were, however, lost after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].&lt;ref name="momen" /&gt;

=== Russian intellectuals ===
[[File:Isabella Grinevskaya.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Isabella Grinevskaya]].]]
About nine Russian intellectuals or artists investigated the religion to varying degrees.&lt;ref name="hass" /&gt; Among the more well known and closest to the religion are [[Alexander Tumansky]], [[Isabella Grinevskaya]], and [[Leo Tolstoy]]. [[Lidia Zamenhof]] also was active towards the end of the period and into the Soviet era. Among the lesser known but more substantive in gathering original materials and from an earlier dates from the 1860s would be Jean-Albert Bernard Dorn and Nicolai Vladimirovich Khanykov both from St. Petersburg. Together their work was collected and published in Russian by Viktor Rosen and another book beginning to include works written by Bahá'u'lláh was done by [[Alexander Kasimovich Kazembek]].&lt;ref name="Warburg"/&gt;

An early translation of the [[Kitab-i-Aqdas]] into Russian was done by orientalist Alexander Tumansky published in about 1899.&lt;ref name="hass" /&gt; He befriended the Bahá'ís in Ashgabat during the trial where Gulpaygani wrote a treatise for him on the ''Risáliy-i Iskandaríyyh'' as a summary of the life of the founder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Mírzá Gulpáygání | first =Abu'l-Faḍl | authorlink =Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl| others=Juan Ricardo Cole (trans.)|title =Letters and Essays, 1886-1913 | publisher =Kalimat Press | year =1985 | pages =xii | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=fumT1mWfzDsC&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;pg=PR12#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | isbn = 9780933770362}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Tumansky was a professor of Arabic language at [[Tiflis]].&lt;ref name="hass" /&gt;

Isabella Grinevskaya was the pen name of a very early Russian Bahá'í born in [[Grodno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |title=A.S.Fridberg , 6 Nov. 1838 - 21 March 1902 |work= |publisher= |url=http://holocaust.cheeb.com/photo6.html |doi= |accessdate=2009-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215123824/http://holocaust.cheeb.com/photo6.html |archivedate=15 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grodno was sometimes part of Poland and Belarus but during her entire lifetime was part of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Short Description/History | work = Eastern BorderLands of the II Polish Republic | publisher = Paul Havers | date = 2008-11-18 | url =http://www.kresy.co.uk/grodno.html | doi = | accessdate = 2009-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is well known because of a play she wrote called ''Báb''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Grinevskaya | first = Isabella | title = Bab | work = | publisher = | year = 1916|edition=reprint| url = http://imwerden.de/pdf/grinevskaya_bab.pdf |format = pdf | doi = | accessdate = 2009-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was performed in St. Petersburg in 1904 and again in 1916/7, translated into French and [[Tatar language|Tatar]],&lt;ref name="hass" /&gt; and later wrote a play ''Bahá'u'lláh'' though it was never staged.

Leo Tolstoy corresponded on the Bábí and Bahá'í Faiths from 1894 until shortly before his death in 1910.&lt;ref name="Collins and Jasion"&gt;[http://www.bahai-studies.ca/journal/files/jbs/3.3%20Collins&amp;Jasion.pdf Lev Tolstoi and the Bábí and Bahá’í Faiths A Bibliography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505095519/http://www.bahai-studies.ca/journal/files/jbs/3.3%20Collins%26Jasion.pdf |date=2012-05-05 }} by William P. Collins and Jan T. Jasion, Journal of Bahá’í Studies Vol. 3, number 3 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; His correspondents, who also sent him translations of Bahá'í writings, include Bahá’ís such as {{Interlanguage link multi|Hippolyte Dreyfus|fr|3=Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney}}, Isabella Grinevskaya, Dr. Yúnis Khán-i-Afrúkhtih, and ‘Ali-Akbar Nakhjavání (father of [[Ali Nakhjavani|Alí-Yulláh Nakhjavání]].) In the fall of 1902 Mirza 'Azizu'llah visited Tolstoy with a personal message from `Abdu'l-Bahá and discussed the history and teachings of the religion during a period of house arrest that followed his excommunication from the Orthodox church.&lt;ref name="hass" /&gt; Elsewhere `Abdu'l-Bahá suggests that Tolstoy was a well-wisher of humanity but that he was still caught up in politics and opinion. Luigi Stendardo’s thesis “Tolstoj et la Foi Bahá’íe” (later revised and published in English as "Leo Tolstoy and the Bahá’í Faith") provides an excellent analysis of Tolstoy’s changing views on the religion. Tolstoy ended life feeling that he could possibly subscribe to the religion but at the same time had major reservations with regard to the Bahá’í doctrine of the [[Manifestation of God]], which insists that God is knowable only through his Manifestations, that these Manifestations are in essence different from and above other humans and that they are infallible. In sum Tolsoy, despite his inability to accept some Bahá’í doctrines, was able to declare that “the teachings of the Bábís which come to us out of Islam have through Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings been gradually developed and now present us with the highest and purest form of religious teaching”.&lt;ref name="Collins and Jasion" /&gt;

Lidia Zamenhof, the youngest daughter of [[L. L. Zamenhof|Ludwig Zamenhof]], was born in 1904 in [[Warsaw]], then in the [[Russian Empire]]. She was an active promoter of Esperanto and around 1925 she became a member of the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter|encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Zamenhof, Lidia |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn=1-85168-184-1 |page=368}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through her efforts and a Russian translation of "Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era" the first Ukrainian joined the religion in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = First Ukrainian Bahá'í |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=May 1946 | page =8| url = | issue = 183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Period of the [[Soviet Union]] ===

Since its inception the religion has had involvement in [[socio-economic development]] beginning by giving greater freedom to women,&lt;ref name="iranhistory"&gt;{{cite web | last = Momen | first = Moojan | title = History of the Baha'i Faith in Iran | work = draft "A Short Encyclopedia of the Baha'i Faith" | publisher = Bahai-library.com | url =http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_iran#9.%20Social%20and%20economic%20development| format = | doi = | accessdate = 2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kingdon | first = Geeta Gandhi | title = Education of women and socio-economic development | journal = Baha'i Studies Review | volume = 7 | issue = 1 |year = 1997 |url =http://bahai-library.com/kingdon_education_women_development }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics.&lt;ref name="iranhistory" /&gt; The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the [[Universal House of Justice]] dated 20 October 1983 was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Baha'i Faith 1957–1988: A Survey of Contemporary Developments | first = Moojan | last = Momen |author2=Smith, Peter | year = 1989 | url =http://bahai-library.com/momen_smith_developments_1957-1988 |volume = 19 | journal = Religion | pages=63–91 |doi= 10.1016/0048-721X(89)90077-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the [[Bahá'í teachings]], in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socioeconomic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. However, only in the brief period before the 1930s in the [[Soviet Union]] were Bahá'ís able to provide services based on their teachings. After that Soviet member states adopted the [[Religion in the Soviet Union#Policy toward religions in practice|Soviet policy of oppression of religion]], so the Bahá'ís, strictly adhering to their principle of obedience to legal government, abandoned its administration and properties.&lt;ref name="obey" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Effendi | first = Shoghi | authorlink = Shoghi Effendi | title = The World Order of Bahá'u'lláh |publisher = US Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1991 first pocket-size edition | date = 1936-03-11 | location = Haifa, Palestine | pages = 64–67 | url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/wob-34.html#pg64| isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1924 Bahá'ís in Turkistan had schools and a special committee for the advancement of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Foreign Bahá'í News |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July–August 1925 | page =7| url = | issue = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; All such developments were dissolved in the face of advances of policies on religion in the Soviet era.

In 1922 early Bahá'í [[Wellesley Tudor Pole]] began a long association with a project aimed at relieving the oppression the [[Bolsheviks]] imposed on religionists in Russia.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web | last = Fenge | first = Gerry | title = Wellesley Tudor Pole.com | work = A few highlights from a full life (timeline) | publisher = Wellesley Tudor Pole.com | url =http://wellesleytudorpole.com/page2.htm | accessdate = 2008-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[`Alí-Akbar Furútan]], born 1905, moved with his family to Ashgabat in what was then Russian Turkestan and, through his years of school and university, he took an active part in the work of the Bahá'í communities of Ashgabat, Baku, Moscow, and other parts of Russia. He attended secondary school in Ashgabat and later graduated from [[Moscow University]] with a degree in psychology and child education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title =

Rules against the religion began in 1922 of a general nature.&lt;ref name="CoL" /&gt; Then in 1926 Bahá'ís in Moscow were detained, printed materials confiscated and some homes seized. Communist anit-Bahá'í pamphlets had been produced and encyclopedic articles were published in 1930 and 1933 partially reacting to the success of the religion reaching those who rejected by Islam and Communism.&lt;ref name="Kolarz" /&gt;

Queen consort [[Marie of Romania]] had received a brooch from her royal relatives in Russia in previous decades. Circa 1926 she joined the religion and gave this brooch to [[Martha Root]] who in turn sent it as a gift to the first Bahá'í House of Worship of the West where it was sold to raise money for the contraction to a Willard Hatch. In 1931 he took it with him when he went on [[Bahá'í pilgrimage]] where with approval of [[Shoghi Effendi]] it was placed in the archives of the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Queen Marie of Rumania Renowned First Royal Believer, by O. Z. Whitehead |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=March 1973 | pages = 2–6| url = | issue = 504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938 "monstrous accusations"&lt;ref name="Kolarz" /&gt; accusing Bahá'ís of being 'closely linked with the leaders of [[Trotskyite]]-[[Basmachi movement|Bukharinist]] and [[Dashnak]]-[[Musavat]] bands'.&lt;ref name="Kolarz" /&gt; Following this numerous arrests and oppression of the religion, Bahá'ís across the Soviet Union were being sent to prisons and camps or sent abroad.&lt;ref name="momen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kolarz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CoL" /&gt; Bahá'í communities in 38 cities across Soviet territories&lt;ref name="hass" /&gt; ceased to exist. In Tashkent Bahá'ís were interrogated and imprisoned. Aqa Habibullah Baqiroff of Tashkent was sentenced to ten years imprisonment "in the neighbourhood of the North Sea and the polar forests."&lt;ref name="hass" /&gt; Many were sent to [[Pavlodar]] in northern Kazakhstan.&lt;ref name="momen" /&gt; (See [[Bahá'í Faith in Kazakhstan]].)

By 1946 in all Turkestan only Ashgabat, Samarkand and Tashkand communities continued.&lt;ref name="hass" /&gt; Bahá'ís had managed to re-enter various countries of the [[Eastern Bloc]] through the 1950s,&lt;ref name="russia" /&gt; following a plan of the head of the religion at the time, [[Shoghi Effendi]]. But by 1956 there is a vague mention of an operating community of Bahá'ís in Uzbekistan.&lt;ref name="BN303"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = The Guardian's Message to the forty-eighth annual Baha'i Convention |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=May 1956 | number = 303 |pages=1–2 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 a delegation of Russian journalists to America were forbidden to visit the North American Bahá'í House of Worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Baha'i in the News |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=December 1955 | page =10| url = | issue = 295}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1957 letter of the head of the religion challenged Bahá'ís to find a way to have one Bahá'í in each Soviet Republic on the European continent: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, White Russia, Moldavia and Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title =A Thrice Blessed World Crusade|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1957 | page =2| url = | issue = 316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 in "Religion in the Soviet Union", [[Walter Kolarz]] notes: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Islam…is attacked by the communists because it is 'reactionary', encourages nationalist narrowmindness and obstructs the education and emancipation of women. Baha'iism(sic) has incurred communist displeasure for exactly the opposite reasons. It is dangerous to Communism because of its broadmindness, its tolerance, its international outlook, the attention it pays to women's education and its insistence on equality of the sexes. All this contradicts the communist thesis about the backwardness of all religions."&lt;ref name="Kolarz" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A pair of small communities are listed in 1963 - [[Tashkand]] and an isolated Bahá'í in [[Fergana]].&lt;ref name="Hands"&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/handscause_statistics_1953-63&amp;chapter=1#22 The Bahá'í Faith: 1844-1963: Information Statistical and Comparative, Including the Achievements of the Ten Year International Bahá'í Teaching &amp; Consolidation Plan 1953-1963], Compiled by [[Hands of the Cause]] Residing in the Holy Land, page 95.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Universal House of Justice]], the head of the religion since 1963, then recognized small Bahá'í presence across the USSR of about 200 Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="statement" /&gt;

== Re-development ==

As [[Perestroyka]] approached, the Bahá'ís began to organize and get in contact with each other.

Before the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]] Bahá'ís in several cities were able to gather and organize. The Bahá'í community of Ashgabat was the first to re-form its Local Spiritual Assembly approximately in 1987 and had doubled its numbers from 1989 to 1991 and had successfully registered with the city government of Ashgabat. From 1988 the Bahá'ís in [[Moscow]] and then in Baku became active&lt;ref name="hist" /&gt; (see also [[Bahá'í Faith in Ukraine]].) Bahá'ís in Azerbaijan sought recognition from the State Department of Religion of Azerbaijan. By the end of 1990, after 50 almost years, the election for the Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Baku was held followed by other communities before 1992.

In this brief time [[`Alí-Akbar Furútan]] was able to return in 1990 as the guest of honor at the election of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="BN261" /&gt; Continuing the popularity of the Indian Bahá'í House of Worship, individuals from multiple cities of Russia and former Soviet republics, as well as groups of researchers, reporters, and their families went in winter 1989 and spring 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title = India|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=May 1990 |page =15| url = | issue = 704| issn = 0195-9212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as the nations established themselves they began drawing up laws regulating religions to the point all the Bahá'í communities were de-established. In 1995 in Turkmenistan, 500 adult religious adherent citizens were required in each locality in order for a religious community to be registered.&lt;ref name="momen" /&gt; Thus by 1997 the Bahá'ís were unregistered by the government along with several other religious communities,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| author-link = Amnesty International| title = TURKMENISTAN - Harassment and imprisonment of religious believers| work =| publisher = Amnesty International| date = 2000-03-01| url = http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3b83b7047.html| accessdate = 2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more than just being unable to form administrative institutions, own properties like temples, and publish literature, perform scholarly work and community service projects -their membership in a religion is simply unrecognized, the religion is considered banned,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Corley| first = Felix| author-link = Felix Corley| title = TURKMENISTAN: Religious freedom survey, April 2004| newspaper = F18News| date = 2004-04-07| url =http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=296| postscript = &lt;!-- None --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; and homes are raided for Bahá'í literature.&lt;ref name="raided"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Corley| first = Felix| author-link = Felix Corley| title = TURKMENISTAN: Religious communities theoretically permitted, but attacked in practice?| newspaper = F18News| date = 2004-04-01| url = http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=293| postscript = &lt;!-- None --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, under these harsh conditions, the Bahá'í community in Turkmenistan has still been unable to reach the required number of adult believers to be recognized by the government as a religion.&lt;ref name="notreg"&gt;{{Cite web| author = U.S. State Department| title = Turkmenistan -International Religious Freedom Report 2007| publisher = The Office of Electronic Information, Bureau of Public Affair| date = 2007-09-14| url =https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90236.htm| accessdate = 2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 the Parliament of Azerbaijan adopted the law of religious liberty and Bahá'ís gained an opportunity to officially register communities and the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Azerbaijan was elected, effectively disbanded since 1938.&lt;ref name="notes" /&gt; In 1993 the Governing Board of the Ministry of Justice of the Azerbaijan Republic gave official permission for the functioning of the Bahá'í Community of Baku.

The Bahá'ís of Baku are seeking the return of property confiscated during the Soviet era—especially a house that served as the Bahá'í Center.&lt;ref name="regulation"&gt;{{cite web| author = U.S. State Department| title =International Religious Freedom Report 2006- Azerbaijan| publisher = The Office of Electronic Information, Bureau of Public Affair| date = 2006-09-15| url = https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71368.htm| accessdate = 2008-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Corley | first = Felix | title = AZERBAIJAN: Baha'is and Baptists want confiscated property back | newspaper = F18News | date = 2005-11-23 | url =http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of Russia proper the situation was similar. From 1990 to 1997 Bahá'ís had operated in some freedom, growing to 20 groups of Bahá'ís registered with the federal government, but the [[Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations]] passed in 1997 is generally seen as unfriendly to minority religions though it hasn't frozen further registrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Dunlop | first =John B. | authorlink =John B.

== Modern community ==

Because of the quick pace of the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]] simultaneously with the religious freedoms initially achieved, local, regional and national assemblies formed and evolved in parallel. The first [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] of Moscow was elected in 1990 followed by a summer [[Bahá'í school]] attended by some 60 Bahá'ís from across the region and followed by a public concert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title =Soviet Union |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1990 |page =15| url = | issue = 711| issn = 0195-9212}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Spiritual Assembly (NSA) of the USSR was elected in 1991 which in 1992 became the NSA of Russia, Georgia &amp; Armenia, and then in 1995 became NSA of the [[Russian Federation]], while over the same period various Soviet republics formed their own NSAs from 1992 through 1994.&lt;ref name="notes" /&gt;

In the late summer of 1992, members of the Marion Jack Teaching Project who were working mostly within Russia at the time, came to Mongolia to participate in a concerted effort to share the religion with a wider range of Mongolians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Bahá'í leads Ealing Studios in 21st Century | work = UK Bahá'í Review | publisher = National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United Kingdom | url =http://www.bahai.org.uk/uk_review/prev_iss/7/p13.htm| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310075244/http://www.bahai.org.uk/uk_review/prev_iss/7/p13.htm|archivedate = May 2008| accessdate = 2010-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ulaanbaatar]] was the gathering place for more than 1,800 Bahá'ís from Mongolia and Russia in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bahai.org/story/690|title=World’s coldest capital hosts Baha’i conference|publisher=news.bahai.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Liudmila St. Onge (Luda) was interested in the religion while in America she mentioned she was on her way to Russia. She was encouraged to seek out the Baha'is in Moscow and in Russia officially joined the religion. Luda’s trip to Russia lasted much longer than anticipated, as she decided to introduce her new business of scrapbooking to Russia. This has proven very successful. She returned to New Hampshire in July 2010, and informed the local Baha'is that she had joined the religion and was eager return.&lt;ref&gt;[http://184.73.195.130/Luda Why Baha'i: Liudmila St. Onge (Luda)] November 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Persian accusations associated with community in Russia ===
{{main|Political accusations against the Baha'i Faith}}

Both Soviet and Iranian governments produced trumped up charges against the religion as an excuse to pursue a violent oppression of the religion. In the case of the Soviets in 1938 "monstrous accusations"&lt;ref name="Kolarz" /&gt; accusing Bahá'ís of being 'closely linked with the leaders of [[Trotskyite]]-[[Basmachi movement|Bukharinist]] and [[Dashnak]]-[[Musavat]] bands'.&lt;ref name="Kolarz" /&gt; Following this numerous arrests and oppression of the religion, Bahá'ís across the Soviet Union were being sent to prisons and camps or sent abroad.&lt;ref name="momen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kolarz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CoL" /&gt; Bahá'í communities in 38 cities across Soviet territories ceased to exist.

In the case of modern Iran it used the history of conflict between Iran and Russia as a circumstance to find Bahá'ís blameworthy. During the 19th century [[Russia]] had been expanding south and east into Central Asia toward India where Britain held power at the time. A rivalry started between Britain and Russia over territorial and political control in Central Asia followed. The middle zone of land was where both Russia and Britain worked to gain influence.&lt;ref name="amanat23"&gt;{{citation |last=Amanat |first=Abbas |year=1989 |title=Resurrection and renewal: The making of the Bábí movement in Iran, 1844-1850 |location=Ithaca, NY|publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=0-8014-2098-9|pages=23–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Struggles in the region lead to Persian antagonism to both foreign powers.&lt;ref name="ashraf"&gt;{{cite web | first = Ahmad | last = Ashraf | url =http://www.iranian.com/May96/Opinion/Conspiracy.html | title = Conspiracy theories and the Persian Mind | accessdate = 2008-07-13 | year = 1997 |publisher = Iranian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim clerics and other anti-Bahá'í groups connected the Bahá'í Faith, and its predecessor the Bábí movement, to the external governments of Britain and Russia to project the mistrust of these two latter groups onto the Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="ashraf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chehabi_186"&gt;{{citation |chapter = Anatomy of Prejudice | title = The Baha'is of Iran: Socio-historical studies | last = Chehabi | first = H.E. | editor-last = Brookshaw |editor-first = Dominic P. |editor2-last = Fazel | editor2-first = Seena B. | year = 2008 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY |isbn = 0-203-00280-6|pages = 186–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to government and clergy-led [[Persecution of Bahá'ís|persecution of the Bahá'ís]], [[Iran]]ian government officials and others have claimed that [[Political accusations against the Baha'i Faith|Bahá'ís have had ties to foreign powers]], and were agents of Russian imperialism and more.&lt;ref name="un294"&gt;{{citation | title = Human Rights, the UN and the Bahá'ís in Iran | first = Nazila | last = Ghanea | publisher = Martinus Nijhoff | isbn = 90-411-1953-1| year = 2003 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GeHNoviEXw0C|page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt; These accusations against the Bahá'ís have been disputed, and described as misconceptions,&lt;ref name="cooper"&gt;{{citation | title = Death Plus 10 years | last = Cooper | first = Roger | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-00-255045-8|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; with no basis in historical fact.&lt;ref name="lifting"&gt;{{citation | publisher = Hodder &amp; Stoughton Ltd | isbn = 0-340-62814-6 | title = Lifting the Veil | last = Simpson | first = John | last2 = Shubart |first2 = Tira | year = 1995 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=e3d46zLOgM8C|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tavakoli200"&gt;{{citation | chapter = Anti-Baha'ism and Islamism in Iran | title = The Baha'is of Iran: Socio-historical studies | last = Tavakoli-Targhi | first = Mohamad | editor-last = Brookshaw | editor-first = Dominic P.|editor2-last = Fazel | editor2-first = Seena B. | year = 2008 | publisher = Routledge |location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-203-00280-6|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, taught that Bahá'ís are to be loyal to one's government, not be involved in politics, and to obey the laws of the country they reside in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= government, Bahá'í attitude towards |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation of much of the propaganda relating the Bahá'í Faith to Russian influence is a memoir attributed to [[Dimitri Ivanovich Dolgorukov]] who was the Russian ambassador to Persia from 1846 to 1854.&lt;ref name="momenjournal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chehabi_186" /&gt; The memoir states that Dolgorukov created the Bábí and Bahá'í religions so as to weaken Iran and Shi'a Islam.&lt;ref name="chehabi_186" /&gt; The memoir was first published in 1943 in [[Persian language|Persian]] in [[Mashhad]], and shortly thereafter published again in Tehran with some of the most glaring errors corrected. The book still, however, contains so many historical errors that it is inconceivable that it is genuine.&lt;ref name="momenjournal" /&gt;

And for all the assistance that may have come from Russian diplomats they neither intervened, nor voiced opposition, when thousands of Bahá'ís were killed later&lt;ref name="hass" /&gt; even when other Europeans did.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the story of Dutchman Johan Colligan who in 1879 entered into partnership with two Bahá'ís, known as the [[Núrayn-i-Nayyirayn|King and Beloved of Martyrs]] and attempted to intervene to protect them. {{Cite book| last = de Vries| first = Jelle| title = The Babi Question You Mentioned--: The Origins of the Baha'i Community of the Netherlands, 1844-1962| publisher = Peeters Publishers| year = 2002| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=n_lb9-jz6z4C| isbn = 978-90-429-1109-3|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Bahá'u'lláh refused exile in Russia.&lt;ref name="Warburg"/&gt;

The '''Bishop of Kilmore''' is an [[Episcopal polity|episcopal]] title which takes its name after the parish of [[Kilmore, County Cavan]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. In the [[Roman Catholic Church]] it remains a separate title, but in the [[Church of Ireland]] it has been united with other bishoprics.

==History==
The [[Episcopal see|see]] of Kilmore was originally known as Breifne ([[Latin]]: ''Tirbrunensis'', ''Tybruinensis'' or ''Triburnia''; [[Irish language|Irish]]: ''Tír mBriúin'', meaning "the land of the descendants of [[Brión mac Echach Muigmedóin|Brian]]", one of the [[List of kings of Connacht|kings of Connaught]]) and took its name after the [[Kingdom of Breifne]].&lt;ref name=handbook362&gt;{{Harvnb|Fryde|Greenway|Porter|Roy|1986}}, ''Handbook of British Chronology'', p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rckilmoredio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kilmorediocese.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=35 |title=Diocese: Statistics and Brief History |work=Diocese of Kilmore |publisher= |accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ireland900.png|200px|thumb|left|The overkingdoms of Ireland circa 900, including the [[Kingdom of Breifne]] which has approximately the same boundaries with the diocese of Kilmore.]]

The see became one of the dioceses approved by Cardinal [[Giovanni Paparoni]] at the [[synod of Kells]] in 1152,&lt;ref name=handbook362/&gt; and has approximately the same boundaries as those of the ancient [[Kingdom of Breifne]].&lt;ref name=rckilmoredio/&gt; In the [[Irish annals]], the bishops were recorded of ''Breifne'', ''Breifni'', ''Breifny'', ''Tir-Briuin'', or ''Ui-Briuin-Breifne''.

In the second half of the 12th century, it is likely the sees of Breifne and [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]] were ruled together under one bishop.&lt;ref name=handbook357&gt;{{Harvnb|Fryde|Greenway|Porter|Roy|1986}}, ''Handbook of British Chronology'', p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1172, Tuathal Ua Connachtaig took the [[oath]] of [[fealty]] to King [[Henry II of England]] as bishop of Kells.&lt;ref name=handbook363&gt;{{Harvnb|Fryde|Greenway|Porter|Roy|1986}}, ''Handbook of British Chronology'', p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after 1211 the see of Kells was incorporated into the [[diocese of Meath]].&lt;ref name=handbook357/&gt;

In 1454, [[Pope Nicholas V]] gave permission for the then bishop, Aindrias Mac Brádaigh ([[Anglicisation|Anglicised]]: Andrew McBrady), to have the ancient church at [[Kilmore, County Cavan|Kilmore]], founded in the 6th century by [[Saint Felim]] (or Feithlimidh), to be the [[cathedral church]] of the diocese.&lt;ref name=rckilmoredio/&gt; This building passed into the hands of the [[Church of Ireland]] at the [[Reformation in Ireland|Reformation]], and, following the construction of a [[St Fethlimidh's Cathedral, Kilmore|new cathedral]], is now used as a [[parochial hall]].&lt;ref name=kilmorecathedral&gt;[http://www.travelmania-ireland.com/place.php?id=21 St. Feithlimidh's Cathedral, Kilmore] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023323/http://www.travelmania-ireland.com/place.php?id=21 |date=4 March 2016 }}. ''Travelmania''. Retrieved on 29 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the upheavals of the Reformation, there were parallel [[apostolic succession]]s: one of the Church of Ireland and the other of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

In the Church of Ireland, the title was intermittently held with [[Bishop of Ardagh|Ardagh]] until they were finally united in 1839. In 1841, the [[Bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh|sees of Kilmore and Ardagh]] were amalgamated with [[Bishop of Elphin|Elphin]] to form the united [[Bishop of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh|bishopric of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh]]. The current incumbent is The Right Reverend Samuel Ferran Glenfield M.A. M.Th. (Oxon.) M.Litt. He was elected, consecrated, and installed in 2013.

In the Roman Catholic, the title continues as a separate bishopric. The current [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Bishop]] of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Kilmore]] is the Most Reverend '''[[Philip Leo O'Reilly]]''', who succeeded as the [[diocesan bishop]] on 16 October and installed at the [[Cavan Cathedral|Cathedral Church of Saints Patrick and Felim, Cavan]] on 15 November 1998. He had been appointed [[coadjutor bishop]] of Kilmore by the [[Holy See]] on 20 November 1996 and received [[Consecration|episcopal ordination]] on 2 February 1997.

==Notes==
&lt;div style="font-size: 95%"&gt;
* {{note label|Note1|A|A}} These two are possibly the same individual.
* {{note label|Note1|B|B}} Cormac Mág Shamhradháin and Tomás Mac Brádaigh were rival bishops, and probably supported by rival [[Sept (social)#Irish septs|septs]] within the diocese. They were present at [[Ecclesiastical province|provincial]] councils held by Ottaviano Spinelli de Palatio, [[Archbishop of Armagh (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Armagh]], in 1492 and 1495, and were both then recognized as bishops of Kilmore. But Diarmaid Ó Raghillaigh was appointed to the see in 1512 before Cormac's death, though Cormac was still maintaining his rights at that date.

The '''Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University''' ('''''Prajapita Brahma Kumaris Ishwariya Vishwa Vidyalaya''''' or '''BKWSU''') is a [[new religious movement]] that originated in [[Hyderabad, Sindh]], during the 1930s.&lt;ref name="New Religious Movements 2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Peter|title=Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements|pages=71–72|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|ISBN=0-203-59897-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brahma Kumaris ({{lang-sa|ब्रह्माकुमारी}}, "People of Brahma") movement was founded by [[Dada Lekhraj]] Kripalani, who later took the name Brahma Baba.&lt;ref name="World 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Melton|first1=J.

== Early history ==
[[File:Lekhraj_Kripalani.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The Founder]]
The Brahma Kumaris, originally called ''Om Mandali'', started in [[Hyderabad, Sindh]] in north-west [[India]].&lt;ref name="Matt Tomlinson, Wendy Smith, Lenore Manderson 2012_1" /&gt; It received this name because members would chant "Om" together, before having discourse on spiritual matters in the traditional [[satsang]] style. The original discourses were closely connected to the [[Bhagavad Gita]].&lt;ref name="Matt Tomlinson, Wendy Smith, Lenore Manderson 2012_1" /&gt;

The founder, [[Dada Lekhraj|Dada Lekhraj Khubchand Kripilani]] (who became known in the group as "Om Baba") was a wealthy jeweller who was respected in the community for his piety.&lt;ref name="Matt Tomlinson, Wendy Smith, Lenore Manderson 2012_1" /&gt; He reported what he said were a series of visions and other transcendental experiences that commenced around 1935 and became the basis for the discourses. He said he believed there was a greater power working through him and that many of those who attended these gatherings were themselves having spiritual experiences.&lt;ref name="Matt Tomlinson, Wendy Smith, Lenore Manderson 2012_1"/&gt; The majority of those who came were women and children from the Bhaibund caste&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

After about three years of meetings it became clear that ''Om Mandali'' was giving very special importance to the role of women, and was not adhering to the caste system. The group had named a 22-year-old woman, Radhe Pokardas Rajwani (then known as "Om Radhe") as its president, and her management committee was made up of eight other women.&lt;ref name="Om Radhe6"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group also advocated that young women had the right to elect not to marry and that married women had the right to choose a celibate life. In tradition-bound patriarchal India, these personal life decisions were the exclusive right of men.&lt;ref name="Liz_Hodgkinson_Peace2"/&gt; A committee headed by a number of important male members of the Bhaibund community began to form in opposition and became known as the 'Anti-Om Mandali Committee'. On 21 June 1938 this group picketed Om Mandali's premises preventing members from entering. This caused considerable upheaval in the community.  Women attending were verbally abused, there was an attempt to burn the premises down and the police made several arrests. Many women and girls were later victims of domestic violence in their homes.&lt;ref name="Liz_Hodgkinson_Peace3"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The picketing resulted in criminal proceedings being taken against both groups, and on 16 August 1938 the local District Magistrate ordered that Om Mandali be prevented from meeting. This ban was reversed on 21 November 1938 after an appeal to the Court of the Judicial Commissioner of Sind.&lt;ref name="Om Radhe1"&gt;{{cite book

On 31 March 1939 the government appointed a tribunal to inquire into the activities of ''Om Mandali''. When the Tribunal made its findings, Om Radhe responded by compiling a book titled ''Is this Justice?'' criticising the tribunal, which did not have a constitutional basis and made its findings without taking evidence from ''Om Mandali''.&lt;ref name="Om Radhe4"&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Train to Mt Abu May 1950.tif|thumb|right|A photo of the Brahma Kumaris during their relocation from Karachi to Mount Abu Rajasthan in May 1950]]
In May 1950 Om Mandali moved to [[Mount Abu]] in [[Rajasthan]] India. From the beginning, the organization's focus had been on education, not worship, and for this reason it renamed itself as Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University.
In 1952, after a 14-year period of retreat, a more structured form of teaching began to be offered to the public by way of a seven lesson course.&lt;ref name="John_Walliss_reflexive"&gt;{{cite book

After an unpromising beginning when it almost ran out of funds,&lt;ref name="Reader" /&gt; from the mid 1950s the Brahma Kumaris began an international expansion programme.&lt;ref name="Howell_Nelson_1998"&gt;Howell (1998) {{page needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s it first spread to [[London]] and then to the West.&lt;ref name="Reader"&gt;''A Reader in New Religious Movements: Readings in the Study of New Religious Movements''.

In 1980 the Brahma Kumaris became affiliated to the United Nations Department of Public Relations as a Non-Governmental Organisation. In 1983 the Brahma Kumaris achieved consultative status with the Economic and Social Council at the United Nations.

The leadership and membership of the BK movement remains primarily female, for example, in the UK only one-third of the 42 centres are run by males &lt;ref name="Julia_Howell_Gender_Role"&gt;Howell (1998) {{page needed|date=October 2013}} &lt;!-- overlong quote for article "Today the leadership of the BK movement in India remains heavily female. Sisters, or kumaris (daughters), are still "put in front", that is favoured for the position of "center-in-charge" (head of a local center). As of December 1995 all Indian centres were run by "sisters." However, "brothers" also reside in many of the centres run by "sisters". Brothers are expected to work to earn an outside income, which provides a substantial share of the support of the centres, and do the domestic work other than cooking. This frees the sisters to engage full-time in service to the organisation as teachers, leaders of meditation sessions and spiritual directors. Indian migrants made up half the number of Brahmins in the UK." --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and 80% of the membership are women.&lt;ref name="Why_women"&gt;'Why are Women More Religious Than Men?'

The community service programmes of the 1980s and 1990s stimulated creative renderings of BK meditation as a tool for psychological healing and eclectic spiritual exploration. The casual participants whom the BKs have attracted in this way probably made up the vast majority of the 450,000 people on the University's records at the turn of the 20th to 21st century".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self===

The Brahma Kumaris see [[human]]s as being made up of two parts; an external or visible body (including extensions such as status and possessions) and a subtle energy of the [[Soul (spirit)#Brahma Kumaris|soul]] whose [[character structure]] is revealed through a person's external activity - but always this is created by the inner soul -whether actions are done with love, peacefully, with happiness or humility is an aspect of one's soul.&lt;ref name="Ramsay_Custodians of Purity1"&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group teaches that the soul is an infinitesimal point of spiritual light residing in the forehead of the body it occupies,&lt;ref name="Ramsay_Custodians of Purity1" /&gt; and that all souls originally existed with God in a "Soul World", a world of infinite light, peace and silence.

The Brahma Kumaris teach that souls enter bodies to take birth in order to experience life and give expression to their personality. Unlike other Eastern traditions, the Brahma Kumaris do not believe that the human soul can transmigrate into other species.&lt;ref name="Ramsay_Custodians of Purity1" /&gt;

===Supreme Soul===
[[File:Das Bild der Höchsten Seele als Lichtpunkt TR.jpg|thumb|Brahma Kumaris believe God to be an incorporeal point of light.]]
The Brahma Kumaris use the term "Supreme Soul" to refer to God. They see God as incorporeal and eternal, and regard him as a point of living light like human souls, but without a physical body, as he does not enter the cycle of birth, death and rebirth. God is seen as the perfect and constant embodiment of all virtues, powers and values and that He is the unconditionally loving Father of all souls, irrespective of their religion, gender, or culture.&lt;ref name="Ramsay_Custodians of Purity4"&gt;{{cite journal

The Brahma Kumaris believe God's purpose to be the spiritual re-awakening of humanity and the removal of all sorrow, evil and negativity. They do not regard him as the creator of matter, as they consider matter to be eternal.&lt;ref name="Ramsay_Custodians of Purity7"&gt;{{cite journal

===Karma===

The Brahma Kumaris believe that every action performed by a soul will create a return accordingly, and that the destiny of the soul’s next body depends on how it acts and behaves in this life. Through meditation, by transforming thinking patterns and eventually actions, the Brahma Kumaris believe that people can purify their "karmic account" and lead a better life in the present and next birth. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Cycle of time===

In contrast to linear theories of human history that hypothesize an ancient point of origin for the universe and a final destruction, the BKs do not posit a start, end or age for the universe, believing such concepts to be an erroneous application of the human life cycle to the universe. BKs believe the universe to follow an eternal, naturally occurring 5,000 year [[wheel of time|cycle]], composed of four ages (''[[yugas]]''): the Golden Age (''[[Sat Yuga]]''), the Silver Age (''[[Treta Yuga]]''), the Copper Age (''[[Dvapara Yuga|Dwapar Yuga]]''), the Iron Age (''[[Kali Yuga]]'') and each represents 1250 years of the cycle.&lt;ref name="New_Believers"&gt;{{cite book

 | quote = Time is cyclical with each 5,000-year cycle consisting of a perfect Golden Age, a slightly degraded Silver age, a decadent Copper Age, and an Iron Age which is characterised by violence, greed, and lust. Each of these lasts for exactly 1,250 years. Our current Iron Age will shortly come to an end, after which the cycle will begin again.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The present period{{when|date=September 2014}} of this cycle is sometimes described as a fifth age or "Confluence age" as it is considered to be the confluence (the junction or meeting) between the Iron Age and the Golden age.&lt;ref name="New_Believers"/&gt;

The first half of the cycle (the Golden and Silver ages) is considered to be the age of "soul conscious living". The Brahma Kumaris see this as a time of "heaven on earth" or as a version of the [[Garden of Eden]] when human beings are fully virtuous, complete, self-realised beings who lived in complete harmony with the natural environment. The primary enlightenment was the innate understanding of the self as a soul.

===New Golden Age===
The present time{{when|date=September 2014}} is believed to bring great global transformation as the world is transitioning from its present Iron Age to begin a new Golden age. The Brahma Kumaris believe that modern civilization is unsustainable and that economic and environmental pressures will ultimately boil over into civil and global conflict, coupled with natural calamities. They believe that there will always be a human population on Earth and that cataclysmic events form part of a natural and cathartic cyclic process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Study (''Murli'')===

[[File:Dadi Gulzar Sept 2014.jpg|thumb|Dadi Gulzar, a member of the Brahma Kumaris since its inception in the 1930s]]
Brahma Kumaris' students study the murli. The Hindi word ''murli'' literally translates to "flute". It is an oral study, read to the class early each morning in most BK centres on the world. The murlis are derived from [[mediumship]] and [[spirit possession]].&lt;ref name="possession"&gt;{{cite thesis

"Far from seeking to undermine or protest the world’s hegemonic orders, the Brahma Kumaris practice of spirit-possession seeks to quicken it in preparation for the end of days.

"The problem was that up until that time, my relationship with him had been through the Brahma Kumaris; but now he was President, and he wanted to use... not only Self Management Leadership, but the whole strategic focusing thing, and his party was the centre-right, Catholic party. They're sufficiently fundamentalist for them to have a fit about Brahma Kumaris.... So we went there, but it had to be done within the context of a commercial enterprise. So, we set up a branch of a consulting company there. But the fact of the matter is, most of his senior people have... been to Oxford for the Brahma Kumaris program. Many have been here to Madhuban.... So the Brahma Kumaris have had a huge influence in the reform process there [in Mexico].... We have trained 90 facilitators from the government who are running these programs, 25,000 people, all the top level of government throughout the entire country have been through the course.... a management training program called Self Management Leadership, which has become the backbone of Brahma Kumaris management philosophy".&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brahma Kumaris expansion in size has led to a greater participation in more mainstream community services.

===Sustainable Yogic Agriculture===
Sustainable Yogic Agriculture (SYA) is a program started in Northern India in 2009. The program has been a collaboration between [[Sardarkrushinagar Dantiwada Agricultural University]] in [[Gujarat]] [[India]] and the Brahma Kumaris Rural Development wing. The program has now been publicly backed by the Indian Government. A key member of [[Narendra Modi]]'s Cabinet, Agriculture Minister [[Radha Mohan Singh]] announced the governments support for the program.&lt;ref&gt;by Sheela Bhaat, [http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/yogic-farming-to-empower-seeds-increase-soil-fertility-agriculture-minister/] "The Indian Express", 15 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; With the governments support the program has been redesigned into Akhil Bharatiya Krushak Sashakatikaran Abhijan (ABKSA), and was launched in December 2015.&lt;ref name="thestatesman.com"&gt;by Taboola, [http://www.thestatesman.com/news/odisha/campaign-to-train-farmers/108962.html] "The Statesman" Odisha news, 7 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; ABKSA extends the initial scope of the SYA program to include teaching meditation and self empowerment to the farmers themselves.&lt;ref name="thestatesman.com"/&gt; This is possibly a response to the problem of [[farmer suicides in India]]. ABKSA now comprises three main elements:
:1. A self empowerment program for Indian farmers;
:2. Ongoing research on whether the use of meditation can improve crop yields;
:3. Education on a blend of traditional and organic farming techniques.
One basic premise of the Brahma Kumaris environmental initiative is that thoughts and consciousness can affect the natural environment.&lt;ref name="Systems approach to Agriculture"&gt;{{cite journal

In 2012, experiments were being conducted in partnership with leading agricultural universities in India&lt;ref name="Systems approach to Agriculture"/&gt; to establish if the practice of Brahma Kumaris meditation in conjunction with implementing more traditional organic farming methods could be shown to have a measurable and positive affect on crop development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/Shashwat-yogic-farming/articleshow/7443126.cms?]&lt;/ref&gt; An article published in the Journal of Asian Agri-History reviews two separate studies on SYA.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly as they still believe that such an event will happen [[Scare quotes|"soon"]].  However, they maintain that their primary purpose is to teach meditation and peace of mind, not to push their views about the different challenges the world is facing on nonmembers who may be visiting the group to learn about meditation or values based living.&lt;ref name="Hinduism. 2010"/&gt;

In the ''Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion'', Howell reported that the Brahma Kumaris protected itself from the practice of families "dumping" their daughters with the organisation by requiring a payment from the families of those wishing to dedicate their daughters to the work and services of the organisation. The payment is intended to cover the living expenses incurred during the trial period.&lt;ref name="Howell_Gender"&gt;Howell (1998) {{page needed|date=October 2013}} &lt;!-- quote hidden as it just repeats the article text "The likelihood that surrendered sisters in India will remain Brahmins throughout their lives is increased by the practise of parent giving dowries to the Brahma Kumaris for daughters they concede will not marry. This practice goes back to the early days of the organization but it is not clear how common it was. Whaling and Babb report it as an occasional practice. Recently the pattern has been formalized, with retreats at Mount Abu being offered for girls in their mid-teens who may wish to undertake a fuller commitment to the organization. The girls are offered a short period of taking classes and living near Senior Sisters, at the end of which they may nominate to undertake a year trial as surrendered sisters. A payment equivalent to a dowry is required from the girls' natural families to cover their living expenses over the trial period. This payment is also meant to prevent parent "dumping" daughters on the Brahma Kumaris to avoid the dowries and other costs of ordinary marriages. Return to the world for women who have has such a dowry paid for them is difficult." --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

John Wallis wrote a book examining the status of tradition in the contemporary world, which used the religion as a case study,&lt;ref&gt;Walliss, John (2002). ''The Brahma Kumaris As a Reflexive Tradition: Responding to Late Modernity''.&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on recruitment methods, the issue of celibacy, reinterpretation of religious history. He reported the rewriting of the revelatory messages (Murlis) by the Brahma Kumari.&lt;ref name="Prophecy"&gt;{{cite journal

The 'Special instruments' (senior members are, they allege 'constantly revising Murlis" to the extent that, for example, a passage from a 1969 murli referring to Shiva being unable to 'mount a virgin' was altered in the 1990 revised edition before being removed completely in the 1993 revision...." Dr. Walliss also notes that while the Brahma Kumaris was "originally a reclusive, [[classifications of cults and new religious movements|world-rejecting]] organization, over the last 30 years the Brahma Kumaris have begun a campaign of active [[proselytism|proselytizing]] and international growth. Thus, whilst still retaining its original millenarianism, currently within the West the organization promotes itself as part of the New Age movement and emphasizes ideas around the issues of self-development, empowerment and personal success." Finally, Wallis disputes their belief that Raja Yoga is the precursor to all world religions, including those that historically predate it: "This is part of a lengthy answer to the question of how the University could claim that Raja Yoga is the precursor to and influence of world religions that historically predate it often by a few thousand years. Again, 'Baba' is cited as the source of ultimate authority".

Families of converts become arenas of conflict between spirituality rooted in Hindu tradition and the very Polish 'popular Catholicism', on two indissoluble levels. First, on the level of religious practises and second, on the level of daily live. Sexual relations within marriage are considered to be 'sacred' by Catholics in Poland. The Brahma Kumaris believe that relations between husband and wife should be based on 'a marriage of souls' e.g. they should meditate together, communicate via telepathy etc. --&gt;

When the organisation started, empowering women to assert their right to remain celibate, particularly in marriage, was a prime factor in the controversy that arose in 1930s Sind, as it directly challenged the dominance of men over women in patriarchal [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name="New Religious Movements 2006" /&gt; Overlooking the organisation's predominantly-female leadership and that this practice was adopted by both men and women equally, feminist commentator Prem Chowdry has criticised the practice of celibacy within the organisation as being a form of patriarchal control.&lt;ref name="Prem"&gt;{{cite journal

In the later years, with the coming of the partition and subsequent migration to India, this sect, confronting a greatly changed social milieu, assumed a somewhat different focus and identity. Despite this shifting of emphasis and consequent contradictions, the core doctrine of celibacy has remained and its advocacy of female sexual control continues to find receptive echoes."

'''The Rev. Dr. Brian N. Connor''' (May 23, 1946 - November 8, 2014) was an [[United States|American]] pastor and [[exorcist]] who also taught people about [[spiritual warfare]].

==Bacground==
Connor was born May 23, 1946 in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] to his parents George Connor and Mary Connor.

Connor graduated from the [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] and held a doctor of ministry degree.

==Ministry==
In 1985 the ministry of [[exorcism]] was first introduced to him when he encountered a woman who was a third generation [[satanist]]. From then on he ministered to people with [[spiritual oppression]]. He said of exorcisms that, "when one experiences it face-to-face -- when one sees [[evil]], smells it, feels it, has things thrown in his face, encounters evil prowling around like a lion -- then you know there's a spiritual warfare going on all around us."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpnews.net/BPnews.asp?ID=2581 Baptist Press, ''27-year veteran leaving pastorate to launch 'ministry of deliverance''', Todd Deaton, October 14, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, after twenty-seven years as a pastor at Southern Baptist churches in Maryland and South Carolina he left his ministry to become a full-time exorcist and run his deliverance ministry. Connor believed that [[spiritual oppression]] is a real part of biblical [[metaphysics]], which includes [[angels]], [[demons]] and [[Satan]].

Connor stated that even people who go to church regularly or minister can still be oppressed. "By belonging to [[Jesus Christ]], we are forgiven in terms of salvation," he explained.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Baptist Press, ''27-year veteran leaving pastorate to launch 'ministry of deliverance''', Todd Deaton, October 14, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; "We can still make wrong choices which open doors within us to satanic oppression by dabbling in the [[occult]], attempting to communicate with the dead, using crystals, accepting [[New Age]] beliefs, following [[demons|spirit guides]], participating in rituals."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; "Anytime someone reaches out to an [[evil spirit]], that spirit puts down roots and will torment and oppress that person," Connor stated.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

On November 13, 2001, he appeared on ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' casting [[demon]]s out of an American baptist. He founded and led the [[Good Shepherd Institute]] which helped spiritually oppressed people. He was featured in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' (August 2002) and ''[[FHM]]'' (August 2003) and seen on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]], [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E Channel]], [[Biography Channel]] and [[The Learning Channel]].

==Death==

Connor died on Saturday, November 8, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.obitsforlife.com/obituary/999352/Connor-Reverend-Brian.php&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from his mother, Mary Connor, He is survived by his wife June Christopher Connor of Folly Beach; 2 daughters, Amy Connor Bradley and husband Dr. Raymond J. Bradley of New Bern, NC, Carey Connor McNamara and husband Dr. Robert McNamara of Mt. Pleasant; the girls' mother, Faye Vickery Connor of Mt Pleasant, a step-son, Jonathan "Jay" Argoe Jr. of Folly Beach; brother James "Jim" Connor and wife Janet of Floyd, VA; grandchildren, Caroline, Samuel, and Benjamin Bradley, and Connor McNamara.

A '''brownie''' or '''broonie''' ([[Scots language|Scots]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/broonie_n1|title=Dictionary of the Scots Language :: SND :: Broonie n.1|website=www.dsl.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as a '''brùnaidh''' or '''gruagach''' ([[Scottish Gaelic]]), is a [[household deity|household spirit]] from [[Great Britain|British]] [[folklore]] that is said to come out at night while the owners of the house are asleep and perform various chores and farming tasks. The human owners of the house must leave a bowl of milk or cream or some other [[Sacrifice|offering]] for the brownie, usually by the [[hearth]]. Brownies are described as easily offended and will leave their homes forever if they feel they have been insulted or in any way taken advantage of. Brownies are characteristically mischievous and are often said to punish or pull pranks on lazy servants. If angered, they are sometimes said to turn malicious, like [[boggart]]s.

Brownies originated as domestic [[Tutelary deity|tutelary]] spirits, very similar to the [[Lares]] of ancient Roman tradition. Descriptions of brownies vary regionally, but they are usually described as ugly, brown-skinned, and covered in hair. In the oldest stories, they are usually human-sized or larger. In more recent times, they have come to be seen as small and wizened. They are often capable of turning invisible and they sometimes [[Therianthropy|appear in the shapes of animals]]. They are always either naked or dressed in rags. If a person attempts to present a brownie with clothing or if a person attempts to [[Baptism|baptize]] him, he will leave forever.

Although the name ''brownie'' originated as a dialectal word used only in northern England and Scotland, it has since become the standard term for all such creatures throughout [[Great Britain]]. Regional variants in England and Scotland include '''hobs''', '''silkies''', and '''ùruisgs'''. Variants outside England and Scotland are the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] '''Bwbach''' and the [[Manx language|Manx]] '''Fenodyree'''. Brownies have also appeared outside of folklore, including in [[John Milton]]'s poem ''[[L'Allegro]]''. They became popular in works of [[children's literature]] in the late nineteenth century and continue to appear in works of modern fantasy. The [[Brownies (Scouting)|Brownies]] in the [[Girl Guides]] are named after a short story by [[Juliana Horatia Ewing]] based on brownie folklore.

==Origin==
[[File:Vettii.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Roman [[Lararium]], or household shrine to the [[Lares]], from the [[House of the Vettii]] in [[Pompeii]]. Brownies bear many similarities to the Roman Lares.{{sfn|McNeill|1977|page=123}}{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=47}}{{sfn|Stewart|2007|pages=110–111}}]]

Brownies originated as domestic [[Tutelary deity|tutelary]] spirits, very similar to the [[Lares]]&lt;!--This is not saying that brownies are necessarily derived from the Lares specifically, but rather that they are derived from an entity of a very similar nature.--&gt; of ancient Roman tradition, who were envisioned as the protective spirits of deceased ancestors.{{sfn|McNeill|1977|page=123}}{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=47}}{{sfn|Stewart|2007|pages=110–111}}{{sfn|Silver|2005|page=205}} Brownies and Lares are both regarded as solitary and devoted to serving the members of the house.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|page=111}} Both are said to be hairy and dress in rags{{sfn|Stewart|2007|page=111}} and both are said to demand offerings of food or dairy.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|page=111}} Like Lares, brownies were associated with the dead{{sfn|Briggs|1967|pages=47–48}}{{sfn|Stewart|2007|page=111}} and a brownie is sometimes described as the [[ghost]] of a deceased servant who once worked in the home.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|page=111}} The [[Cauld Lad of Hylton|Cauld Lad of Hilton]], for instance, was reputed to be the ghost of a stable boy who was murdered by one of the Lords of [[Hylton Castle|Hilton Castle]] in a fit of passion.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|pages=39–40}} Those who saw him described him as a naked boy.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=40}} He was said to clean up anything that was untidy and make messes of things that were tidy.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=40}}

The family cult of deceased ancestors in ancient times centred around the hearth,{{sfn|McNeill|1977|page=123}} which later became the place where offerings would be left for the brownie.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=47}} The most significant difference between brownies and Lares is that, while Lares were permanently bound to the house in which they lived,{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=47}}{{sfn|Stewart|2007|page=111}} brownies are seen as more mobile, capable of leaving or moving to another house if they became dissatisfied.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=47}}{{sfn|Stewart|2007|page=111}} One story describes a brownie who left the house after the stingy housewife fired all the servants because the brownie was doing all the work and refused to return until all the servants had been re-hired.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=47}}

==Traditions==
===Activities===
Traditions about brownies are generally similar across different parts of Great Britain.{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=110}} They are said to inhabit homes and farms.{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=110}}{{sfn|Monaghan|2004|page=62}} They only work at night, performing necessary housework and farm tasks while the human residents of the home are asleep.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|page=111}}{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=110}}{{sfn|Monaghan|2004|page=62}} The presence of the brownie is believed to ensure household prosperity{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=110}}{{sfn|Monaghan|2004|page=62}} and the human residents of the home are expected to leave offerings for the brownie, such as a bowl of cream or porridge, or a small cake.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|page=111}}{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=110}}{{sfn|Monaghan|2004|page=62}} These are usually left on the [[hearth]].{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=110}} The brownie will punish household servants who are lazy or slovenly by pinching them while they sleep, breaking or upsetting objects around them, or causing other mischief.{{sfn|Silver|2005|page=205}}{{sfn|Stewart|2007|page=111}}{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=110}} Sometimes they are said to create noise at night or leave messes simply for their own amusement.{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=110}} In some early stories, brownies are described as guarding treasure, a non-domestic task outside of their usual repertoire.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=47}}

Brownies are almost always described as solitary creatures who work alone and avoid being seen.{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=110}}{{sfn|Alexander|2013|page=64}}{{sfn|Briggs|1967|pages=46–47}} There is rarely said to be more than one brownie living in the same house.{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=110}}{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=35}}{{efn|Sometimes, however, [[pixie]]s or other trooping fairies do the work of a brownie,{{sfn|Briggs|1967|pages=46–47}} especially in the [[West Country]].{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=33}}}} Usually, the brownie associated with a house is said to live in a specific place, such as a particular nearby cave, stream, rock, or pond.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=46}} Some individual brownies are occasionally given names.{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=110}} Around 1650, a brownie at Overthwaite in [[Westmorland]] was known as "Tawny Boy"{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=110}} and a brownie from Hilton in [[County Durham]] was known as "Cauld Lad".{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=110}} Brownies are said to be motivated by "personal friendships and fancies" and may sometimes be moved to perform extra work outside of their normal duties, such as, in one story of a brownie from Balquam, fetching a [[midwife]] when the lady of the house went into [[childbirth|labour]].{{sfn|Briggs|1967|pages=35, 46}}

In 1703, [[John Brand (minister)|John Brand]] wrote in his description of [[Shetland]] that:
{{quote|Not above forty or fifty years ago, every family had a brownie, or evil spirit, so called, which served them, to which they gave a sacrifice for his service; as when they churned their milk, they took a part thereof, and sprinkled every corner of the house with it, for Brownie’s use; likewise, when they [[brewing|brewed]], they had a stone which they called "Brownie’s stane", wherein there was a little hole into which they poured some [[wort]] for a sacrifice to Brownie. They also had some stacks of corn, which they called Brownie's Stacks, which, though they were not bound with straw ropes, or in any way fenced as other stacks used to be, yet the greatest storm of wind was not able to blow away straw off them.}}

===Appearance===
Brownies are virtually always male,{{sfn|Monaghan|2004|page=62}} but female brownies, such as [[Maggy Moulach|Meg Mullach]] (or "Hairy Meg"), have occasionally been described as well.{{sfn|Henderson|Cowan|2001|page=16}}{{sfn|Monaghan|2004|page=322}} They are usually envisioned as ugly{{sfn|Alexander|2013|page=64}}{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=46}}{{sfn|Silver|2005|pages=205–206}} and their appearances are sometimes described as frightening or unsettling to members of the houses in which they reside.{{sfn|Alexander|2013|page=64}} They received their name from the fact that they are usually described as brown-skinned and completely covered in hair.{{sfn|Alexander|2013|page=64}} In the earliest traditions, brownies are either the same size as humans or sometimes larger,{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=46}} but, in later accounts, they are described as "small, wizened, and shaggy".{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=46}} They are often characterized as short and rotund,{{sfn|Monaghan|2004|page=62}}{{sfn|Miller|2008|page=151}} a description that may be related to mid-seventeenth-century Scottish descriptions of [[Satan|the Devil]].{{sfn|Miller|2008|page=151}} Two [[Witch trials in early modern Scotland|Scottish witchcraft confessions]], one by Thomas Shanks in 1649 and another by Margaret Comb in 1680, both describe meetings with a "thick little man".{{sfn|Miller|2008|page=151}} The man in these descriptions may have been conceived as a brownie.{{sfn|Miller|2008|page=151}}

In the late nineteenth century, the Irish folklorist [[Thomas Keightley]] described the brownie as "a personage of small stature, wrinkled visage, covered with short curly brown hair, and wearing a brown mantle and hood".&lt;ref name=Keightley&gt;[[Thomas Keightley|Keightley, Thomas]] (1870). "[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/tfm/tfm130.htm The Brownie]". ''The Fairy Mythology''. London: H. G. Bohn.&lt;/ref&gt; Brownies are usually described as either naked or clothed in rags.{{sfn|Monaghan|2004|page=62}}{{sfn|Alexander|2013|page=64}}{{sfn|Silver|2005|page=206}} Brownies of the Scottish Lowlands were said not to have noses, but instead had merely a single hole in the centre of their face.{{sfn|Alexander|2013|page=64}}{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=46}} In [[Aberdeenshire]], brownies are sometimes described as having no fingers or toes.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=46}} Sometimes brownies are stated to appear like children, either naked or dressed in white tunics.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=46}}

Like the [[Púca|Phooka]] in Irish folklore, brownies are sometimes described as [[Therianthropy|taking the forms of animals]].{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=46}} As a rule, they can turn [[Invisibility|invisible]],{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=46}} but they are supposed to rarely need this ability because they are already experts at sneaking and hiding.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=46}} A story from [[Peeblesshire]] tells of two maids who stole a bowl of milk and a [[Bannock (food)|bannock]] that had been left out for the brownie.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=42}} They sat down together to eat them, but the brownie sat between them invisibly and whenever either of them tried to eat the bannock or drink the milk, the brownie would steal it from them.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=42}} The two maids began arguing, each accusing the other of stealing her milk and bannock.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=42}} Finally, the brownie laughed and cried out: "Ha, ha, ha! Brownie has't a'!"{{sfn|Briggs|1967|pages=42–43}}{{sfn|Dorson|2001|page=180}}

===Leaving the house===
If the brownie feels he has been slighted or taken advantage of, he will vanish forever, taking the prosperity of the house with him.{{sfn|Alexander|2013|page=64}}{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=110}}{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=41}} Sometimes the brownie is said to fly into a rage and wreck all his work before leaving.{{sfn|Alexander|2013|page=64}} In extreme cases, brownies are even sometimes said to turn into malicious [[boggart]]s if angered or treated improperly.{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=110}} A brownie is said to take offence if a human observes him working, if a human criticizes him, or if a human laughs at him.{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=110}}{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=41}} Brownies are supposedly especially angered by anything they regard as contempt or condescension.{{sfn|Alexander|2013|page=64}}{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=41}} The brownie at [[Cranshaws]] in [[Berwickshire]] is said to have mown and thrashed the grain for years.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=42}} Then someone commented that the grain had been poorly mown and stacked,{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=42}} so, that night, the brownie carried all the grain to Raven Crag two miles away and hurled it off the cliff, all the while muttering:{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=42}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
It's no' weel mow'd! It's no' weel mow'd!—
Then it's ne'er be mow'd by me again;
I'll scatter it owre the Raven Stane
And they'll hae some wark ere it's mow'd again!{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=42}}
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A brownie can also be driven away if someone attempts to [[Baptism|baptize]] him.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=41}} In some stories, even the manner in which their bowls of cream are given is enough to drive the brownie away.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|pages=41–42}} The brownie of Bodsbeck, near the town of [[Moffat]] in Scotland, left for the nearby farm of Leithenhall after the owner of Bodsbeck called for him after pouring his cream, instead of letting him find the cream himself.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|pages=41–42}}

Sometimes giving the brownie a name was enough to drive him away.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=35}} A brownie who haunted Almor Burn near [[Pitlochry]] in [[Perthshire]] was often heard splashing and paddling in the water.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=35}} He was said to go up to the nearby farm every night with wet feet and, if anything was untidy, he would put it in order, but, if anything was tidy, he would hurl it around and make a mess.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=35}} The people of the area feared him and did not go near the road leading up from the water at night.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=35}} A man returning from the market one night heard him splashing in the water and called out to him, addressing him by the nickname "Puddlefoot".{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=35}} Puddlefoot exclaimed in horror, "I've gotten a name! 'Tis Puddlefoot they call me!"{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=35}} Then he vanished forever and was never heard again.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=35}}

===Gifts of clothing===
[[File:GrimmsGoblins-090-TheElvesAndTheShoemaker.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A recurring folkloric motif holds that, if presented with clothing, a brownie will leave his family forever and never work for them again,{{sfn|Alexander|2013|page=64}}{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|pages=110–111}}{{sfn|Briggs|1967|pages=38–41}} similar to the ''Wichtelmänner'' in the German story of "[[The Elves and the Shoemaker]]".]]

If the family the brownie works for gives him a gift of clothing, he will leave forever and refuse to work for the family.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|page=111}}{{sfn|Alexander|2013|page=64}}{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|pages=110–111}}{{sfn|Briggs|1967|pages=38–41}} The first mention in English of a brownie disappearing after being presented with clothes comes from Book Four, Chapter Ten of [[Reginald Scot]]'s ''[[The Discoverie of Witchcraft]]'', published in 1584.{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|pages=110–111}} Sometimes brownies are reported to recite couplets before disappearing.{{sfn|Alexander|2013|pages=64–65}} One brownie from Scotland is said to have angrily declared:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Red breeks and a ruffled sark!
Ye'll no get me to do your wark!{{sfn|Alexander|2013|page=64}}{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=41}}
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Another brownie from Berwickshire is said to have declared:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Gie Brownie a coat, gie Brownie a sark,
Ye'se get nae mair o' Brownie's wark.{{sfn|Alexander|2013|page=65}}
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Explanations differ regarding why brownies disappear when presented with clothes,{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=111}} but the most common explanation is that the brownie regards the gift of clothing as an insult.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|page=111}}{{sfn|Alexander|2013|page=64}}{{sfn|Briggs|1967|pages=37, 40–41}} One story from [[Lincolnshire]], first recorded in 1891, attempts to rationalize the motif by making a brownie who is accustomed to being presented with [[linen]] shirts become enraged upon being presented with a shirt made of [[sackcloth]].{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=111}}{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=38}} The brownie in the story sings before disappearing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Harden, harden, harden hamp,
I will neither grind nor stamp;
Had you given me linen gear,
I have served you many a year.
Thrift may go, bad luck may stay,
I shall travel far away.{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=111}}{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=38}}
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Cauld Lad of Hilton seems to have wanted clothes and to have been grateful for the gift of them, yet still refused to stay after receiving them.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=40}}{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=111}} At night, people were supposed to have heard him working and somberly singing:{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=40}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Wae's me! Wae's me!
The acorn is not yet
Fallen from the tree,
That's to grow to the wood,
That's to make the cradle,
That's to rock the bairn,
That's to grow a man,
That's to lay to me.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=40}}
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
After the servants presented him with a green mantle and hood, he is supposed to have joyfully sung before disappearing:{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=40}}{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=111}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Here's a cloak, and here's a hood!
The Cauld Lad of Hilton will do no more good!{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=40}}{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=111}}
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is possible that the Cauld Lad may have simply thought himself "too grand for work", a motif attested to in other folk tales,{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=111}} or that the gift of clothing may have been seen as a means of freeing him from a curse.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=40}} A brownie from [[Jedburgh]] is also said to have desired clothing.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=40}} The servants are reported to have heard him one night saying, "Wae's me for a green sark!"{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=40}} The [[laird]] ordered for a green shirt to be made for the brownie.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=40}} It was left out for him and he disappeared forever.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=40}} People assumed he had gone to [[Fairyland]].{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=40}}

===Brownie sway===
In the nineteenth century, the [[pothook]] used to hang pots over the fire was made with a crook in it, which was known in [[Herefordshire]] as the "brownie's seat" or "brownie's sway".{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=43}} If the hook did not have crook on it, people would hang a [[horseshoe]] on it upside-down so the brownie would have a place to sit.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=43}} The brownie at the Portway Inn in [[Staunton on Wye]] reportedly had a habit of stealing the family keys{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=43}} and the only way to retrieve them was for the whole family sit around the hearth and to set a piece of cake on the [[Hob (hearth)|hob]] as an offering to the brownie.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|pages=43–44}} Then they would all sit with their eyes closed, absolutely silent, and the missing keys would be hurled at them from behind.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|pages=43–44}}

==Regional variants==
Although the name ''brownie'' originated in the early sixteenth century as a dialect word used only in the Scottish Lowlands and along the English border,{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=109}} it has become the standard name for a variety of similar creatures appearing in the folklores of various cultures across Britain.{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=109}} Stories about brownies are generally more common in England and the Lowlands of Scotland than in Celtic areas.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=33}} Nonetheless, stories of Celtic brownies are recorded.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|pages=33–39}}

===Bwbach===
The [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name for a brownie is ''Bwbach''.{{sfn|Alexander|2013|page=65}}{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=37}} Like brownies, Bwbachs are said to have violent tempers if angered.{{sfn|Alexander|2013|page=65}} The twelfth-century Welsh historian [[Gerald of Wales]] records how a Bwbach inflicted havoc and mischief upon a certain household that had angered him.{{sfn|Alexander|2013|page=65}} The nineteenth-century folklorist [[Wirt Sikes]] describes the Bwbach as a "good-natured goblin" who performs chores for Welsh maids.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=37}} He states that, right before she goes to bed, the maid must sweep the kitchen and make a fire in the fireplace and set a churn filled with cream by the fire with a fresh bowl of cream next to it.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=37}} The next morning, "if she is in luck", she will find the bowl of cream had been drunk and the cream in the churn has been dashed.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=37}} Sikes goes on to explain that, in addition to being a household spirit, the Bwbach is also the name for a terrifying phantom believed to sweep people away on gusts of air.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|pages=37–38}} The Bwbach is said to do this on the behalf of spirits of the restless dead, who cannot sleep because of the presence of hidden treasure.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=38}} When these spirits fail to succeed in persuading a living mortal to remove the treasure, they have the Bwbach whisk the person away instead.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=38}} Briggs notes that this other aspect of the Bwbach's activities make it much more closely resemble the Irish Phooka.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=38}}

[[John Rhys]], a Welsh scholar of Celtic culture and folklore, records a story from [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] in his 1901 book ''Celtic Folklore'' about a young maid suspected of having fairy blood, who left a bowl of cream at the bottom of the stairs every night for a Bwbach.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=36}} One night, as a prank, she filled the bowl with stale urine.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=36}} The Bwbach attacked her, but she screamed and the Bwbach was forced to flee to the neighboring farm of Hafod y Ynys.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=36}} A girl there fed him well and he did her [[Hand spinning|spinning]] for her,{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=36}} but she wanted to know his name, which he refused to tell.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=36}} Then, one day when she pretended to be out, she heard him singing his name, Gwarwyn-a-throt,{{sfn|Briggs|1967|pages=36–37}} so he left and went to another farm, where he became close friends with the manservant, whose name was Moses.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|pages=36–37}} After Moses was killed in the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]], Gwarwyn-a-throt began behaving like a boggart, wreaking havoc across the whole town.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=37}} An old wise man, however, managed to summon him and banish him to the [[Red Sea]].{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=37}} Elements of this story recur throughout other brownie stories.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=37}}

The [[Manx language|Manx]] name for a brownie is ''[[Fenodyree]]''.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=38}} The Fenodyree is envisioned as a "hairy spirit of great strength", who is capable of [[Threshing|threshing]] an entire barn full of corn in a single night.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=38}} The Fenodyree is regarded as generally unintelligent.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=38}} One Manx folktale tells of how the Fenodyree once tried to round up a flock of sheep and had more trouble with a small, hornless, grey one than any of the others;{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=38}} the "sheep" he had so much difficulty with turned out to be a hare.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=38}} The exact same mistake is also attributed to a brownie from [[Lancashire]]{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=38}} and the story is also told in western [[North America]].{{sfn|Dorson|2001|page=180}} Like other brownies, the Fenodyree is believed to leave forever if he is presented with clothing.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=38}} In one story, a farmer of Ballochrink gave the Fenodyree a gift of clothes in gratitude for all his work.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=38}} The Fenodyree was offended and lifted up each item of clothing, reciting the various illnesses each one would bring him.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=38}} The Fenodyree then left to hide away in [[Rushen|Glen Rushen]] alone.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=38}}

===Hobs and hearth spirits===
Especially in [[Yorkshire]] and Lancashire, brownies are known as "Hobs" due to their association with the hearth.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=45}} Like brownies, Hobs would leave forever if presented with clothing.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=45}} A Hob in [[Runswick Bay]] in [[North Yorkshire]] was said to live in a natural cave known as the "Hob-Hole", where parents would bring their children for the Hob to cure them of [[whooping cough]].{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=45}} The Holman Clavel Inn in [[Somerset]] is also said to be inhabited by a mischievous Hob named Charlie.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=44}} The story was recorded by the folklorist R. L. Tongue in 1964 immediately after he heard it from a woman who lived next door to the inn.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=44}} Everyone in the locality knew about Charlie{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=44}} and he was believed to sit on the beam of [[holly]] wood over the fire, which was known as the "clavvy" or "clavey".{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=44}} Once, when the woman was having dinner with a local farmer, the servants set the table at the inn with "silver and linen",{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=44}} but, as soon as they left the room and came back, Charlie had put all the table settings back where they had come from because he did not like the farmer she was meeting with.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=44}}

Hobs are sometimes also known as "Lobs".{{sfn|Monaghan|2004|page=292}} Lob-Lie-by-the-Fire is the name of a large brownie who was said to perform farm labour.{{sfn|Monaghan|2004|page=292}} In Scotland, a similar hearth spirit was known as the Wag-at-the-Wa.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=43}}{{sfn|Germanà|2014|page=61}} The Wag-at-the-Wa was believed to sit on the pothook{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=43}} and it was believed that swinging the pothook served as an invitation for him to come visit.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=43}} He was believed to pester idle servants, but he was said to enjoy the company of children.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=43}} He is described as a hideous, short-legged old man with a long tail who always dressed in a red coat and blue breeches with an old nightcap atop his head and a bandage around his face, since he was constantly plagued by [[toothache]].{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=43}} He also sometimes wore a grey cloak. He was often reported to laugh alongside the rest of the family if they were laughing,{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=43}} but he was strongly opposed to the family drinking any beverages with more alcohol content than home-brewed [[ale]].{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=43}} He is said to have fled before the [[sign of the cross]].{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=43}}

===Silkie===
A female spirit known as the Silkie, who received her name from the fact that she was always dressed in grey silk, appears in English and Scottish folklore.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=33}}{{sfn|Monaghan|2004|page=420}} Like a ghost, the Silkie is associated with the house rather than the family who lives there,{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=33}} but, like a brownie, she is said to perform chores for the family.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=33}}{{sfn|Monaghan|2004|page=420}}{{sfn|Germanà|2014|page=61}} A famous Silkie was reported to haunt Denton Hall in Northumberland.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=33}} Briggs gives the report of a woman named Marjory Sowerby, who, as a little girl, had spoken with the last remaining Hoyles of Denten Hall, two old ladies, about the Silkie and its kindness to them.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=33}} They told her that the Silkie would clean the hearth and kindle fires for them.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=33}} They also mentioned "something about bunches of flowers left on the staircase".{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=33}} Sowerby left the area in around 1902 and, when she returned over half a century later after [[World War II]], the Hoyles were both long dead and the house was owned by a man who did not believe in fairies.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=33}} The stories about the Silkie were no longer told and instead the house was reputed to be haunted by a vicious [[poltergeist]], who made banging noise and other strange noises and pulled pranks on the man.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=33}} The man eventually moved out.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=33}} Briggs calls this an example of a brownie turning into a boggart.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=33}}

Silkies were also sometimes believed to appear suddenly on roads at night to lonely travellers and frighten them.{{sfn|Germanà|2014|page=61}} Another Silkie is said to haunt the grounds of Fardel Hall in [[Devonshire]].{{sfn|Dacre|2011|page=105}} This one is said to manifest in the form of a "beautiful young woman with long, golden hair, wearing a long silken gown" and supposedly guards a hoard of treasure buried on the grounds.{{sfn|Dacre|2011|page=105}} Few people have seen the spirit, but many claim to have heard the rustling of her silk dress.{{sfn|Dacre|2011|page=105}} She is believed to quietly strangle anyone who comes near finding the treasure.{{sfn|Dacre|2011|page=105}}

===Ùruisg===
The folklorist [[John Gregorson Campbell]] distinguishes between the English brownie, which lived in houses, and the Scottish ''ùruisg'' or ''urisk'', which lived outside in streams and waterfalls and was less likely to offer domestic help.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{citation | first=John Gregorson | last=Campbell | title=Superstitions Of The Highlands And Islands Of Scotland | year=1900 | publisher=James MacLehose and Sons |location= Glasgow, Scotland |page=194 | url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924029909896}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although brownies and ùruisgs are very similar in character, they have different origins.{{sfn|McNeill|1977|page=128}} Ùruisgs are sometimes described as half-man and half-goat.{{sfn|West|2007|page=294}}{{sfn|McNeill|1977|page=126}} They are said to have "long hair, long teeth, and long claws".{{sfn|McNeill|1977|page=126}} According to [[M. L. West]], they may be Celtic survivals of goat-like nature spirits from [[Proto-Indo-European mythology]], analogous to the Roman [[faun]]s and Greek [[satyr]]s.{{sfn|West|2007|pages=292–294}} Passersby often reported seeing an ùruisg sitting atop a rock at dusk, watching them go by.{{sfn|McNeill|1977|page=126}} During the summer, the ùruisg was supposed to remain in the solitude of the wilderness,{{sfn|McNeill|1977|page=126}} but, during the winter, he would come down and visit the local farms at night or take up residence in a local mill.{{sfn|McNeill|1977|page=126}}

Wild ùruisgs were troublemakers and vandals who perpetrated acts of butchery, arson, and ravaging,{{sfn|McNeill|1977|page=127}} but, once domesticated, they were fiercely loyal.{{sfn|McNeill|1977|page=127}} Wealthy and prominent families were said to have ùruisgs as household servants.{{sfn|McNeill|1977|page=127}} One chieftain of the [[Clan MacFarlane|MacFarlane clan]] was said to have been nursed and raised by the wife of an ùruisg.{{sfn|McNeill|1977|page=127}} The [[Clan Graham|Graham clan]] of [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]] told stories of an ùruisg that had once worked for one of their ancestors as a drudge.{{sfn|McNeill|1977|page=127}} The [[Clan Maclachlan|Maclachlan clan]] in [[Strathlachlan]] had an ùruisg servant named "Harry", possibly shortened from "the hairy one".{{sfn|McNeill|1977|page=127}} The [[Clan MacNeil|MacNeils]] of [[Taynish National Nature Reserve|Taynish]] and the Frazers of Abertarff also claimed to have ùruisg servants.{{sfn|McNeill|1977|page=127}} Ùruisgs were also known as ''ciuthachs'' or ''kewachs''.{{sfn|McNeill|1977|page=128}} A story on the island of [[Eigg]] told of a ciuthach that lived in a cave.{{sfn|McNeill|1977|page=128}} In some parts of Scotland, similar domestic spirits were called Shellycoats, a name whose origin is uncertain.&lt;ref name=Keightley/&gt;

A figure named "[[Billy Blind]]" or "Billy Blin", who bears close resemblances to both the brownie and the Irish [[banshee]], appears in ballads of the [[Anglo-Scottish border]].&lt;ref name=briggs76&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Katharine Mary Briggs|Briggs, Katharine]] |title=An Encyclopedia of Fairies, Hobgoblins, Brownies, Bogies, and Other Supernatural Creatures|page= 23 |isbn=978-0-14-004753-0|publisher=Penguin|location=Middlesex, United Kingdom |year=1977|origyear=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Briggs|1967|pages=32–33}}{{sfn|Dorson|2001|pages=120–121}} Unlike brownies, who usually provide practical domestic aid, Billy Blind usually only provides advice.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|pages=32–33}} He appears in the ballad of "[[Young Beichan|Young Bekie]]", in which he warns Burd Isbel, the woman Bekie is pledged to marry, that Bekie is about to marry another woman.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=32}} He also appears in the ballad of "[[Willie's Lady]]" in which he also provides advice, but offers no practical aid.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|pages=32–33}}

Briggs notes stories of other household spirits from British folklore who are reputed to haunt specific locations.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=45}} The "cellar ghost" is a spirit who guards wine in cellars from would-be thieves;{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=45}} Lazy Lawrence is said to be protect orchards;{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=45}} [[Awd Goggie]] scares children away from eating unripe [[Gooseberry|gooseberries]];{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=45}} and [[Melsh Dick|Melch Dick]] guards nut thickets.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=45}} The [[Kilmoulis]] is a brownie-like creature from the Scottish Lowlands that is often said to inhabit mills.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=46}} He is said to have no mouth, but an enormous nose that covers most of his face.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=46}} He is fond of pranks and only the miller himself is able to control him.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=46}}

==Analysis==
===Classification===
Brownies have traditionally been regarded as distinct and different from [[Fairy|fairies]].{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=109}} In 1777, a [[vicar]] of [[Beetham]] wrote in his notes on local folklore, "A Browny is not a fairey, but a tawny color'd Being which will do a great deal of work for a Family, if used well."{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=109}} The writer [[Walter Scott]] agreed in his ''[[The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border|Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border]]'', in which he states, "The Brownie formed a class of beings distinct in habit and disposition from the freakish and mischievous elves."{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=109}} Modern scholars, however, categorize brownies as household spirits, which is usually treated as a subcategorization of fairy.{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|pages=109–110}} Brownies and other household spirits differ significantly from other fairies in folklore, however.{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=110}} Brownies are usually said to dwell alongside humans in houses, barns, and on farms;{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=110}} whereas other fairies are usually said to reside in places of remote wilderness.{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=110}} Brownies are usually regarded as harmless, unless they are angered;{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=110}} other types of folkloric fairies, however, are typically seen as dark and dangerous.{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=110}} Finally, brownies are unusual for their solitary nature, since most other types of fairies are often thought to live in large groups.{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=110}}

Briggs notes that brownies are frequently associated with the dead{{sfn|Briggs|1967|pages=46–47}} and states that, like the banshee in Irish folklore, "a good case" could be made for brownies to be classified as ghosts.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=47}} Nonetheless, she rejects this idea, commenting that the Brownie has "an adaptability, individuality and a homely tang which forbids one to think of him as merely a lingering and reminiscent image."{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=47}}

In seventeenth-century Scotland, brownies were sometimes regarded as a kind of demon.{{sfn|Miller|2008|page=148}} [[James VI and I|King James VI and I]] describes the brownie as a demon in his 1597 treatise ''[[Daemonologie]]'':{{sfn|Alexander|2013|page=64}}{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=109}}{{sfn|Miller|2008|page=148}}
{{quote|... among the first kinde of spirites that I speak of, appeared in the time of ''[[Papist]]rie'' and blindness, and haunted divers houses, without doing any evill, but as it were necessarie turnes up and down the house: and this pirit they called ''Brownie'' in our language, who appeared like a rough-man: yea, some were so blinded, as to believe that their house was all the [[wikt:sonsy|sonsier]], as they called it, that such spirites resorted there.&lt;ref&gt;[[James VI and I|King James VI and I]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=yze4DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=brownie+King+James+I+Daemonologie&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Mm4w5YxiEk&amp;sig=twmMbQ-A7KTeVf0jk_ECjD1PWbM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjk25CkhMbcAhVDw4MKHdr7CbMQ6AEwDnoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=brownie%20King%20James%20I%20Daemonologie&amp;f=false Daemonology]'' &lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Functionalist analysis===
The folklorist L. F. Newman states that the image of the brownie fits well into a [[Structural functionalism|Functionalist]] analysis of the "old, generous rural economy" of [[Pre-industrial society|pre-Industrial]] Britain,{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=111}} describing him as the epitome of what a good household servant of the era was supposed to be.{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=111}} Belief in brownies could be exploited by both masters and servants.{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|pages=111–112}} The servants could blame the brownie for messes, breakages, and strange noises heard at night.{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=112}} Meanwhile, the masters of the house who employed them could use stories of the brownie to convince their servants to behave by telling them that the brownie would punish servants who were idle and reward those who performed their duties vigilantly.{{sfn|Simpson|Roud|2000|page=112}} According to Susan Stewart, brownies also resolved the problem that human storytellers faced of the unending repetition and futility of labour.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|page=111}} As immortal spirits, brownies could not be worn out nor revitalized by working, so their work became seen as simply part of "a perpetual cycle that is akin to the activities of Nature herself."{{sfn|Stewart|2007|page=111}}

==Outside of folklore==
===Early literary appearances===
[[File:Covenanters in a Glen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|In [[James Hogg]]'s 1818 novel ''The Brownie of Bodsbeck'', the eponymous "brownie" turns out to be [[John Brown (Covenanter)|John Brown]], the leader of the [[Covenanters]], a persecuted Scottish [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] movement.{{sfn|Germanà|2014|page=62}} An illegal meeting of Covenanters is shown in this painting, ''Covenanters in a Glen'' by [[Alexander Carse]].]]

An entity referred to as a "drudging goblin" or the "Lubbar Fend" is described in lines 105 to 114 of [[John Milton]]'s 1645 [[pastoral]] poem ''[[L'Allegro]]''.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|page=111}}{{sfn|Germanà|2014|page=61}} The "goblin" churns butter, brews drinks, makes dough rise, sweeps the floor, washes the dishes, and lays by the fire.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|page=111}} According to Briggs, like most other early brownies, Milton's Lubbar Fend was probably envisioned as human-sized or larger.{{sfn|Briggs|1967|page=46}} In many early literary appearances, the brownie turns out to be an ordinary person.{{sfn|Ashley|1999|page=316}} The Scottish novelist [[James Hogg]] incorporated brownie folklore into his novel ''The Brownie of Bodsbeck'' (1818).{{sfn|Margerum|2005|page=92}}{{sfn|Germanà|2014|page=62}} The novel is set in 1685, when the [[Covenanter]]s, a Scottish [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] movement, were being persecuted.{{sfn|Germanà|2014|page=62}} Food goes missing from the farm of Walter of Chaplehope, leading villagers to suspect it is the "brownie of Bodsbeck".{{sfn|Germanà|2014|page=62}}{{sfn|Margerum|2005|page=92}} In the end, it turns out that the "brownie" was actually [[John Brown (Covenanter)|John Brown]], the leader of the Covenanters.{{sfn|Germanà|2014|page=62}}

Hogg later wrote about brownies in his short story "The Brownie of Black Haggs" (1828).{{sfn|Ashley|1999|page=316}}{{sfn|Germanà|2014|pages=62–63}} In this story, the evil Lady Wheelhope orders that any of her male servants who openly practices any form of religion must be given over to the military and shot.{{sfn|Germanà|2014|page=62}} Female servants who practiced religion are discretely poisoned.{{sfn|Germanà|2014|page=62}} A single mysterious servant named Merodach stands up to her.{{sfn|Germanà|2014|page=62}} Merodach is described as having "the form of a boy, but the features of one a hundred years old" and his eyes "bear a strong resemblance to the eyes of a well-known species of monkey."{{sfn|Germanà|2014|page=62}} Characters in the novel believe Merodach to be a brownie, although others claim that he is a "mongrel, between a Jew and an ape... a wizard... a [[kelpie]], or a fairy".{{sfn|Germanà|2014|page=63}} Like folkloric brownies, Merodach's religion is overtly pagan and he detests the sight of the Bible.{{sfn|Germanà|2014|page=63}} He also refuses to accept any form of payment.{{sfn|Germanà|2014|page=63}} Lady Wheelhope hates him and attempts to kill him,{{sfn|Germanà|2014|page=63}} but all her efforts mysteriously backfire, instead resulting in the deaths of those she loves.{{sfn|Germanà|2014|page=63}} The novel never reveals whether Merodach is actually of supernatural origin or if he is merely a peculiar-looking servant.{{sfn|Germanà|2014|pages=62–63}} [[Charlotte Brontë|Charlotte]] and [[Emily Brontë]] were both familiar with Hogg's stories{{sfn|Germanà|2014|page=63}} and his portrayal of Merodach may have greatly influenced Emily's portrayal of her character [[Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights)|Heathcliff]] in ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' (1847).{{sfn|Germanà|2014|page=63}} Brownies are also briefly referenced in Charlotte's novel ''[[Villette (novel)|Villette]]'' (1853).{{sfn|Germanà|2014|pages=63–64}}

The late nineteenth century saw the growth and profusion of children's literature, which often incorporated fantasy.&lt;ref name="briggs72"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Briggs|first=Katharine M.|year=1972|title=Folklore in Nineteenth-Century English Literature|journal=Folklore|volume=83|issue=3|pages=194–209|jstor=1259545|doi=10.1080/0015587x.1972.9716469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brownies in particular were often thought of as especially appealing to children.{{sfn|Ashley|1999|page=316}} [[Juliana Horatia Ewing]] incorporated brownie folklore remembered from her childhood into her short story "The Brownies", first published in 1865 in ''[[The Monthly Packet]]''{{sfn|Ashley|1999|page=316}} and later incorporated into her 1871 collection of short stories ''The Brownies and Other Tales''.&lt;ref name="briggs72"/&gt;{{sfn|Margerum|2005|page=92}} In the story, a selfish boy seeks a brownie to do his chores for him because he is too lazy to do them himself.{{sfn|Margerum|2005|page=92}} A wise old owl tells him that brownies do not really exist and the only real brownies are good little children who do chores without being asked.{{sfn|Margerum|2005|page=92}}{{sfn|Germanà|2014|page=64}} The boy goes home and convinces his younger brother in join him in becoming the new household "brownies".{{sfn|Margerum|2005|page=92}} Ewing's short story inspired the idea of calling helpful children "brownies".{{sfn|Ashley|1999|page=316}}{{sfn|Margerum|2005|page=92}}{{sfn|Germanà|2014|page=64}}

The [[Canadian Americans|Canadian American]] children's writer [[Palmer Cox]] helped promote brownies in [[North America]] through his illustrated poems about them published in ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine]]''.{{sfn|Ashley|1999|page=316}}{{sfn|Margerum|2005|pages=92–93}} Cox portrayed brownies as "tiny elf-like figures who often took on tasks en masse".{{sfn|Nelson|Chasar|2012|page=143}} These poems and illustrations were later collected and published in his book ''The Brownies: Their Book'' in 1887, which became the first of several such collections.{{sfn|Ashley|1999|page=316}}{{sfn|Nelson|Chasar|2012|page=143}} In the 1890s, so-called "brownie-mania" swept across the [[United States]].{{sfn|Margerum|2005|pages=92–93}} Cox effectively [[Brand licensing|licensed out]] his brownie characters rather than selling them, something which he was among the first to do.{{sfn|Margerum|2005|pages=92–93}}{{sfn|Nelson|Chasar|2012|pages=143–144}} He and his many business collaborators were able to market brownie-themed [[tie-in]] merchandise, including boots, [[cigar]]s, stoves, dolls, and silverware.{{sfn|Margerum|2005|pages=92–93}}{{sfn|Nelson|Chasar|2012|pages=143–144}}

The popularity of Cox's poems, illustrations, and tie-in products cemented brownies as an element of North American children's literature and culture.{{sfn|Ashley|1999|page=316}}{{sfn|Margerum|2005|pages=92–93}}{{sfn|Nelson|Chasar|2012|page=143}} Meanwhile, Cox could not copyright the name "brownie" because it was a creature from folklore, so unauthorized "brownie" products began to flood the market as well.{{sfn|Margerum|2005|page=93}} The widespread "brownie" merchandise inspired [[George Eastman]] to name his low-cost camera "[[Brownie (camera)|Brownie]]".{{sfn|Margerum|2005|page=93}} In 1919, [[Juliette Gordon Low]] adopted "[[Brownies (Scouting)|Brownies]]" as the name for the lowest age group in her organization of "[[Girl Guides]]" on account of Ewing's short story.{{sfn|Ashley|1999|page=316}}{{sfn|Monaghan|2004|pages=61–62}}

The '''Chaitanya Bhagavata''' ({{lang-bn|চৈতন্য ভাগবত}}) is a [[hagiography]] of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] (b.1486), the Supreme Personality of Godhead [[Krishna]] incarnation in Kaliyuga, written by [[Vrindavana Dasa Thakura]] (1507-1589 CE). It was the first full-length work regarding Chaitanya Mahaprabhu written in [[Bengali language]] and documents his early life and role as the founder of the [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]] tradition. The text details Chaitanya's theological position as a combined [[Avatar]] of both [[Radha]] and Krishna within the belief of his close associates and followers. The writing of Chaitanya Bhagavata was commissioned by [[Nityananda]], who was the [[guru]] of Vrindavana Dasa Thakura and close friend of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.

==Name==
{{Vaishnavism}}
Initially, the Chaitanya Bhagavata was named ''Chaitanya Mangala''. [[Krishnadasa Kaviraja]] also mentioned this work by this name. According to the ''Premavilasa'' of [[Narottama Dasa]], when it was discovered that the poet [[Lochana Dasa]] had also written a work with this title, the leading members of the Vaishnava community in [[Vrindavan]] met and decided that Vrindavana Dasa's book would be known as the Chaitanya Bhagavata with Lochana Dasa's book remaining as the [[Chaitanya Mangala]].&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Sukumar (2007). ''Bangala Sahityer Itihas'' (in Bengali), Vol.I, Kolkata: Ananda Publishers, {{ISBN|81-7066-966-9}}, p.261&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divisions==
The Chaitanya Bhagavata is divided into three parts: the ''Adi-khanda'', ''Madhya-khanda'' and ''Antya-khanda'':
 
;Adi-khanda
The Adi-khanda consists of fifteen ''adhyaya''s (chapters). It deals with the socio-religious situation of [[Bengal]] before the advent of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, his birth, education, and  marriage to Lakshmi-priya; his defeating opposing scholars, his visit to [[East Bengal]], the passing of Lakshmi-priya, his marriage to [[Vishnupriya]] and his trip to [[Gaya, India|Gaya]] and subsequent [[diksha|initiation]] from [[Ishvara Puri]].

;Madhya-khanda
The Madhya-khanda consists of twenty-seven ''adhyaya''s (chapters). It narrates Chaitanya's growing external displays of [[bhakti|devotion]], the disciples which join his devotional creed, the conversion of the debauchees Jagai and Madhai, and Chaitanya's civil disobedience movement against the Muslim Chand Kazi who tries to stop the congregational chanting of the names of [[Krishna]].

;Antya-khanda
The Antya-khanda consists of ten ''adhyaya''s (chapters). It portrays Chaitanya's acceptance of [[sannyasa]] (the renounced order), his mother Saci-Mata's lamentation, his travels to [[Puri, Orissa|Puri]], his meeting with the logician [[Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya]] and his relationships and interactions with different devotees.

In two of the manuscripts of the ''Chaitanya Bhagavat'', three additional chapters are found at the end of the ''Antya-khanda'', which are not accepted as the part of the original text by most of the modern scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Sukumar (2007). ''Bangala Sahityer Itihas'' (in Bengali), Vol.I, Kolkata: Ananda Publishers, {{ISBN|81-7066-966-9}}, p.269&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
The Chaitanya Bhagavata (similarly to the [[Chaitanya Charitamrita]]) asserts that Chaitanya was not simply a saint or even a "regular" [[Avatar]], but was instead the direct incarnation of Krishna as [[Bhagavan]], or the Supreme [[God]] himself. The text gives Chaitanya's mission as one for the benefit of mankind, through beginning the ''[[yuga]]-[[dharma]]'' ([[hari]]nam-[[sankirtana]]) for the present age of [[Kali Yuga]]. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is quoted within as saying "My holy name will be sung (preached) in every town and village of earth".&lt;ref&gt;pṛthivī-parjanta jata āche deŝa-grāma sarvatra sañcāra hoibek mora nāma, C.Bh. Antya 4.126&lt;/ref&gt; The author, Vrindavana Dasa, has been considered by [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]]s to be the [[Vyasa]] of Chaitanya's pastimes because of revealing his true nature and mission.

The Bhagavata has been praised for its simplicity in that is does not cross into the ontological nuances that are found in [[Krishna Dasa Kaviraja]]'s [[Chaitanya Charitamrita]]. The Charitamrita of Krishna Dasa gives a more sophisticated and theological view of the life of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and provides more information on his years in Puri as an ascetic. Together, the texts of the Chaitanya Bhagavata and the Chaitanya Charitamrta provide a complete picture of the life and teachings of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu although there are many more of his biographies and other writings&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veda.harekrsna.cz/encyclopedia/tattvas2.htm#1 Vedic Encyclopedia, Library]&lt;/ref&gt; about him.

Scholars are of the opinion that [[Vrindavana Dasa]] wrote the Chaitanya Bhagavata somewhere in the mid-1540s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2231">'''Emu and the Jabiru''' is an [[Australian Aboriginal mythology|Australian Aboriginal myth]]. The myth tells a story of greed between two brothers-in-law, who through their fighting transformed into the first [[emu]] and [[jabiru]].

==Narrative==
The story begins with Gandji and his children fishing for [[stingray]]. In clear water, they [[spearfishing|spear]] many stingray, and cook them over a fire to separate their meat from the fat, and wrap these in bark. They return from their expedition and offer some of their catch to Gandji's brother-in-law Wurrpan and his children.

Wurrpan discovers that Gandji has kept the highest quality meat for his own family, and the two begin to argue. Gandji says that Wurrpan should catch his own stingray, and throws hot coals into his face. Gandji picks up a rock used for nut grinding and throws it, striking Wurrpan in the chest.

In fear of what Wurrpan will do in retaliation, Gandji begins jumping around, and then flying about, higher and higher, until he turns into a [[Black-necked stork|jabiru]] without a beak. Wurrpan fetches a spear to throw at the flying Gandji. The spear strikes Gandji in the back of the head and travels through to his face, protruding and forming a beak. Gandji falls from the sky.

Wurrpan and his family turn to flee, turning to [[emu]]s so that they can run faster. Their feathers are grey, owing to the ash that Gandji threw in Wurrpan's face.

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar|history}}
The '''Essenes''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|s|iː|n|z|,_|ɛ|ˈ|s|iː|n|z}}; [[Modern Hebrew]]: {{Hebrew|אִסִּיִים}}, ''Isiyim''; [[Koine Greek|Greek]]: Ἐσσηνοί, Ἐσσαῖοι, or Ὀσσαῖοι, ''Essenoi, Essaioi, Ossaioi'') were a sect of  [[Second Temple Judaism]] which flourished from the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century CE.

The Jewish historian [[Josephus]] records that Essenes existed in large numbers, and thousands lived throughout [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman Judaea]], but they were fewer in number than the [[Pharisees]] and the [[Sadducees]], the other two major sects at the time. The Essenes lived in various cities but congregated in communal life dedicated to voluntary [[poverty]], [[Mikveh|daily immersion]], and [[asceticism]] (their priestly class practiced celibacy). Most scholars claim they seceded from the [[Zadok]]ite priests.&lt;ref&gt;F.F. Bruce, Second Thoughts on the Dead Sea Scrolls. Paternoster Press, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Essenes have gained fame in modern times as a result of the discovery of an extensive group of religious documents known as the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], which are commonly believed to be the Essenes' library. These documents preserve multiple copies of parts of the [[Hebrew Bible]] untouched from possibly as early as 300&amp;nbsp;BCE until their discovery in 1946. Most scholars dispute the notion that the Essenes wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls.&lt;ref&gt;Hillel Newman, Ph.D Bar Ilan University: ''Proximity to Power and Jewish Sectarian Groups of the Ancient Period'' Brill {{ISBN|90-04-14699-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rachel Elior]] questions even the existence of the Essenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Ofri |last=Ilani |date=13 March 2009 |title=Scholar: The Essenes, Dead Sea Scroll 'authors,' never existed |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1070797.html |work=[[Haaretz]] |accessdate=17 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=time20090316&gt;{{Cite news|first=Tim |last=McGirk |date=16 March 2009 |title=Scholar Claims Dead Sea Scrolls 'Authors' Never Existed |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1885421,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=17 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="elior-responds"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jwest.wordpress.com/2009/03/15/rachel-elior-responds-to-her-critics/ |title=Rachel Elior Responds to Her Critics |publisher=Jim West |date=15 March 2009 |accessdate=17 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321091436/http://jwest.wordpress.com/2009/03/15/rachel-elior-responds-to-her-critics/ |archivedate=21 March 2009 |df=dmy }}{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first reference to the sect is by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] writer [[Pliny the Elder]] (died {{c.|lk=no|79 CE}}) in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''.&lt;ref name=Pliny1&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historia Naturalis|work=V, 17 or 29; in other editions V, (15).73 |author=Pliny the Elder |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/5*.html |quote="''Ab occidente litora Esseni fugiunt usque qua nocent, gens sola et in toto orbe praeter ceteras mira, sine ulla femina, omni venere abdicata, sine pecunia, socia palmarum. in diem ex aequo convenarum turba renascitur, large frequentantibus quos vita fessos ad mores eorum fortuna fluctibus agit. ita per saeculorum milia—incredibile dictu—gens aeterna est, in qua nemo nascitur. tam fecunda illis aliorum vitae paenitentia est! infra hos Engada oppidum fuit, secundum ab Hierosolymis fertilitate palmetorumque nemoribus, nunc alterum bustum. inde Masada castellum in rupe, et ipsum haut procul Asphaltite. et hactenus Iudaea est.''"}} cf. [https://archive.org/stream/plinysnaturalhis00plinrich#page/n281/mode/2up English translation].&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny relates in a few lines that the Essenes possess no money, had existed for thousands of generations, and that their priestly class (“contemplatives”) do not marry. Unlike [[Philo]], who did not mention any particular geographical location of the Essenes other than the whole land of [[Israel]], Pliny places them somewhere above [[Ein Gedi]], next to the [[Dead Sea]].

Josephus later gave a detailed account of the Essenes in ''[[The Jewish War]]'' ({{c.|lk=no|75 CE}}), with a shorter description in ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' ({{c.|lk=no|94 CE}}) and ''[[The Life of Flavius Josephus]]'' ({{c.|lk=no|97 CE}}). Claiming firsthand knowledge, he lists the ''Essenoi'' as one of the three sects of Jewish [[philosophy]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]] ({{c.|lk=no|75}}). ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]''. 2.119.&lt;/ref&gt; alongside the [[Pharisees]] and the [[Sadducee]]s. He relates the same information concerning [[piety]], [[celibacy]], the absence of personal property and of money, the belief in communality, and commitment to a strict observance of [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]. He further adds that the Essenes [[ritual]]ly immersed in water every morning, ate together after prayer, devoted themselves to [[charity (practice)|charity]] and benevolence, forbade the expression of anger, studied the books of the elders, preserved secrets, and were very mindful of the names of the [[Angels in Judaism|angels]] kept in their sacred writings.

Pliny, also a [[geographer]], located them in the [[desert]] near the northwestern shore of the [[Dead Sea]], where the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] were discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=D. |last=Barthélemy |first2= J.T. |last2=Milik |authorlink2=Józef Milik |first3= Roland |last3= de Vaux |authorlink3=Roland de Vaux |first4= G.M. |last4=Crowfoot |first5=Harold |last5=Plenderleith |authorlink5=Harold Plenderleith |first6= G.L. |last6=Harding |chapter=Introductory: The Discovery |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=iVa8BQGO0PIC&amp;pg=PA5 |title=Qumran Cave 1 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford]] |year=1997 |origyear=1955 |page=5 |isbn=0-19-826301-5 |accessdate=31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
Josephus uses the name ''Essenes'' in his two main accounts&lt;ref&gt;Josephus. ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]''. 2.119, 158, 160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Josephus. ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]''. 13.171-2.&lt;/ref''Antiquities of the Jews''. 13.311.&lt;/ref&gt; but some manuscripts read here ''Essaion'' (“holding the Essenes in honour”;&lt;ref&gt;Josephus ({{c.|lk=no|94}}). ''Antiquities of the Jews''. 15.372.&lt;/ref&gt; “a certain Essene named Manaemus”;&lt;ref&gt;Josephus. ''Antiquities of the Jews''. 15.373.&lt;/ref&gt; “to hold all Essenes in honor”;&lt;ref&gt;Josephus. ''Antiquities of the Jews''. 15.378.&lt;/ref&gt; “the Essenes”).&lt;ref&gt;Josephus. ''Antiquities of the Jews''. 18.11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Josephus. ''Antiquities of the Jews''. 18.18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Josephus. ''[[The Life of Flavius Josephus]]''. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In several places, however, Josephus has ''Essaios'', which is usually assumed to mean ''Essene''  (“Judas of the ''Essaios'' race”;&lt;ref&gt;Josephus. ''The Wars of the Jews''. I.78.&lt;/ref&gt; “Simon of the ''Essaios'' race”;&lt;ref&gt;Josephus. ''The Wars of the Jews''. 2.113.&lt;/ref&gt; “John the ''Essaios''”;&lt;ref&gt;Josephus. ''The Wars of the Jews''. 2.567; 3.11.&lt;/ref&gt; “those who are called by us ''Essaioi''”;&lt;ref&gt;Josephus. ''Antiquities of the Jews''. 15.371.&lt;/ref&gt; “Simon a man of the ''Essaios'' race”).&lt;ref&gt;Josephus. ''Antiquities of the Jews''. 17.346.&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus identified the Essenes as one of the three major Jewish sects of that period.&lt;ref&gt;''And when I was about sixteen years old, I had a mind to make trial of the several sects that were among us. These sects are three: - The first is that of the Pharisees, the second that Sadducees, and the third that of the Essenes, as we have frequently told you'' - [http://www.deusdiapente.net/science/Bible%20Research/LifeOfJosephus.pdf The Life of Josephus Flavius, 2].&lt;/ref&gt;

Philo's usage is ''Essaioi'', although he admits this Greek form of the original name, that according to his [[etymology]] signifies “holiness”, to be inexact.&lt;ref name=Philo1&gt;[[Philo]]. ''[http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/text/philo/book33.html Quod Omnis Probus Liber]''. XII.75-87.&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny's Latin text has ''Esseni''.&lt;ref name=Pliny1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pliny&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]]. ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''. 5.73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gabriele Boccaccini implies that a convincing etymology for the name Essene has not been found, but that the term applies to a larger group within [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] that also included the [[Qumran]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Gabriele |last=Boccaccini |title=Beyond the Essene hypothesis: the parting of the ways between Qumran and Enochic Judaism |publisher=[[William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company]] |location=[[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] |year=1998 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AnAiz6fB2X8C&amp;pg=PA47 47] |isbn=0-8028-4360-3 |oclc=37837643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was proposed before the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] were discovered that the name came into several [[Greek language|Greek]] spellings from a Hebrew self-designation later found in some Dead Sea Scrolls, '''osey hatorah'', “observers of torah”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Stephen |last=Goranson |chapter=Others and Intra-Jewish Polemic as Reflected in Qumran Texts |editors=Peter W. Flint and James C. VanderKam |year=1999 |title=The Dead Sea Scrolls after Fifty Years: A Comprehensive Assessment |volume=2 |pages=534–551 |location=[[Leiden]] |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |isbn=90-04-11061-5 |oclc=230716707}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although dozens of etymology suggestions have been published, this is the only etymology published before 1947 that was confirmed by [[Qumran]] text self-designation references, and it is gaining acceptance among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;For example, James C. VanderKam, “Identity and History of the Community”. In The Dead Sea Scrolls after Fifty Years: A Comprehensive Assessment, ed. Peter W. Flint and James C. VanderKam, 2:487–533. Leiden: Brill, 1999. The earliest known proposer of this etymology was P. Melanchthon, in [[Johann Carion]], ''Chronica'', 1532, folio 68 verso. Among the other proposers before 1947, e.g., 1839 Isaak Jost, “Die Essaer,” Israelitische Annalen 19, 145–7.&lt;/ref&gt; It is recognized as the etymology of the form ''Ossaioi'' (and note that Philo also offered an O spelling) and ''Essaioi'' and ''Esseni'' spelling variations have been discussed by VanderKam, Goranson, and others. In medieval Hebrew (e.g. [[Josippon|Sefer Yosippon]]) ''Hassidim'' (“the pious ones”) replaces “Essenes”. While this Hebrew name is not the etymology of ''Essaioi''/''Esseni'', the Aramaic equivalent ''Hesi'im'' known from Eastern [[Aramaic]] texts has been suggested.&lt;ref name=lightfoot1875/&gt; Others suggest that Essene is a transliteration of the Hebrew word ''chitzonim'' (chitzon=outside), which the [[Mishna]] (e.g. Megila 4:8) uses to describe various sectarian groups. Another theory is that the name was borrowed from a cult of devotees to [[Artemis]] in [[Asia Minor]], whose demeanor and dress somewhat resembled those of the group in Judaea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cojs.org/cojswiki/Essenes,_Lawrence_H._Schiffman,_Reclaiming_the_Dead_Sea_Scrolls,_Jewish_Publication_Society,_Philadelphia,_1994. Essenes, Lawrence H. Schiffman, [[Reclaiming the Dead Sea Scrolls]], Jewish Publication Society, Philadelphia, 1994.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115172233/http://cojs.org/cojswiki/Essenes,_Lawrence_H._Schiffman,_Reclaiming_the_Dead_Sea_Scrolls,_Jewish_Publication_Society,_Philadelphia,_1994. |date=15 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Josephus|Flavius Josephus]] in Chapter 8 of “[[The Jewish War]]” states:

{{quote|2.(119)For there are three philosophical sects among the Jews. The followers of the first of which are the Pharisees; of the second, the [[Sadducees]]; and the third sect, which pretends to a severer [[discipline]], are called Essenes. These last are Jews by birth, and seem to have a greater affection for each other than other sects have."&lt;ref&gt;Whiston and Maier, 1999, "The Jewish War" - Chapter 8, p.736&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Location==
[[File:QumranLivingQuarters.jpg|thumb|Remains of part of the main building at Qumran.]]
According to Josephus, the Essenes had settled “not in one city” but “in large numbers in every town”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]] ({{c.|lk=no|75}}). ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]''. 2.124.&lt;/ref&gt; Philo speaks of "more than four thousand" ''Essaioi'' living in “Palestine and [[Syria]]”,&lt;ref name=quodxii75&gt;[[Philo]] ({{c.|lk=no|20–54}}). ''[http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/text/philo/book33.html Quod Omnis Probus Liber]''. XII.75.&lt;/ref&gt; more precisely, “in many cities of Judaea and in many villages and grouped in great societies of many members”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philo]]. ''[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/book37.html Hypothetica]''. 11.1. in [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]]. ''[[Praeparatio Evangelica]]''. VIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pliny locates them “on the west side of the Dead Sea, away from the coast... [above] the town of [[En Gedi|Engeda]]”.&lt;ref name=Pliny/&gt;

Some modern scholars and [[archaeologist]]s have argued that Essenes inhabited the settlement at [[Qumran]], a [[plateau]] in the [[Judean Desert]] along the Dead Sea, citing Pliny the Elder in support, and giving credence that the Dead Sea Scrolls are the product of the Essenes. This theory, though not yet conclusively proven, has come to dominate the scholarly discussion and public perception of the Essenes.&lt;ref name=Ellegard&gt;[[Alvar Ellegård|Ellegård, Alvar]]; ''Jesus—One Hundred Years Before Christ: A Study in Creative Mythology'', (London 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the Dead Sea Scrolls that have been discovered is a small fragment known as the “[[4Q246|Son of God text]]” or [[4Q246]].

==Rules, customs, theology, and beliefs==
The accounts by Josephus and [[Philo]] show that the Essenes led a strictly [[communal]] life—often compared to later [[Christian monasticism]].&lt;ref&gt;The suggestion apparently goes back to [[Flinders Petrie]]'s ''Personal religion in Egypt before Christianity'' (1909), 62ff; see William Herbert Mackean, ''Christian Monasticism in Egypt to the Close of the Fourth Century'' (1920), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Essene groups appear to have been celibate, but Josephus speaks also of another “''order'' of Essenes” that observed the practice of being engaged for three years and then becoming married.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]] ({{c.|lk=no|75}}). ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]''. book II, chap.8, para.13.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Josephus, they had customs and observances such as collective ownership,&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]] ({{c.|lk=no|75}}). ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]''. 2.122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]] ({{c.|lk=no|94}}). ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]''. 18.20.&lt;/ref&gt; electing a leader to attend to the interests of the group, and obedience to the orders from their leader.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]] ({{c.|lk=no|75}}). ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]''. 2.123, 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, they were forbidden from [[Oath|swearing oaths]]&lt;ref name="josephus-war-2.135"&gt;[[Josephus]] ({{c.|lk=no|75}}). ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]''. 2.135.&lt;/ref&gt; and from [[animal sacrifice|sacrificing animals]].&lt;ref&gt;Philo, §75: ου ζωα καταθυοντες [= not sacrificing animals]&lt;/ref&gt; They controlled their tempers and served as channels of peace,&lt;ref name="josephus-war-2.135"/&gt; carrying [[weapon]]s only for protection against robbers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]] ({{c.|lk=no|75}}). ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]''. 2.125.&lt;/ref&gt; The Essenes chose not to possess [[slavery|slaves]] but served each other&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]] ({{c.|lk=no|94}}). ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]''. 18.21.&lt;/ref&gt; and, as a result of communal ownership, did not engage in [[trade|trading]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]] ({{c.|lk=no|75}}). ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]''. 2.127.&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus and Philo provide lengthy accounts of their communal meetings, meals and religious celebrations.

After a three-year probationary period,&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]] ({{c.|lk=no|75}}). ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]''. 2.137–138. Josephus' mention of the three-year duration of the Essene probation may be compared with the phased character of the entrance procedure in the Qumran Rule of the Community [1QS; at least two years plus an indeterminate initial catechetical phase, 1QS VI]. The provisional surrender of property required at the beginning of the last year of the novitiate derives from actual social experience of the difficulties of sharing property in a fully communitarian setting, cf. Brian J. Capper, 'The Interpretation of Acts 5.4', Journal for the Study of the New Testament 19 (1983) pp. 117-131; idem, '"In der Hand des Ananias." Erwägungen zu 1QS VI,20 und der urchristlichen Gütergemeinschaft', ''Revue de Qumran'' 12(1986) 223-236; Eyal Regev, “Comparing Sectarian Practice and Organization: The Qumran Sect in Light of the Regulations of the [[Shakers]], [[Hutterites]], [[Mennonites]] and [[Amish]]”, ''Numen'' 51 (2004), pp. 146-181.&lt;/ref&gt; newly joining members would take an oath that included the commitment to practice piety towards God (το θειον) and righteousness towards humanity, to maintain a pure lifestyle, to abstain from criminal and immoral activities, to transmit their rules uncorrupted and to preserve the books of the Essenes and the names of the angels.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]] ({{c.|lk=no|75}}). ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]''. 2.139–142.&lt;/ref&gt; Their theology included belief in the immortality of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] and that they would receive their souls back after death.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]] ({{c.|lk=no|75}}). ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]''. 2.153–158.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of their activities included purification by water rituals, which was supported by rainwater catchment and storage. According to the Community Rules, repentance was a prerequisite to baptism: “They shall not enter the water... for they will not be cleansed unless they have turned from their evil.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Essenes and Christianity|last=Howlett|first=Duncan|publisher=Harper Collins|year=1957|isbn=|location=New York|pages=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritual purification was a common practice among the peoples of Judea during this period and was thus not specific to the Essenes. (Ritual baths are found near many Synagogues of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kittle|first=Gerhardt |title=Theological Dictionary of the New Testament, Volume 7|pages=814, note 99}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Purity and cleanliness was considered so important to the Essenes that they would refrain from defecation on the Sabbath.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Shabbat Elevator and other Sabbath Subterfuges: An Unorthodox Essay on Circumventing Custom and Jewish Character|author=Dundes, A.|date=2002|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=9781461645603|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_a4hAQAAQBAJ|page=109|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Joseph Lightfoot]] the Church Father [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] (writing in the 4th century CE) seems to make a distinction between two main groups within the Essenes:&lt;ref name=lightfoot1875&gt;{{Cite book|first=Joseph Barber |last=Lightfoot |authorlink=Joseph Barber Lightfoot |chapter=On Some Points Connected with the Essenes |title=St. Paul's epistles to the Colossians and to Philemon: a revised text with introductions, notes, and dissertations |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]] |location=London |oclc=6150927 }}&lt;/ref&gt; “Of those that came before his [Elxai, an Ossaean prophet] time and during it, the Ossaeans and the Nazarean.”&lt;ref name="panarion1-19"&gt;[[Epiphanius of Salamis]] ({{c.|lk=no|378}}). ''[[Panarion]]''. 1:19.&lt;/ref&gt; Epiphanius describes each group as following:

{{Quote|The Nazarean—they were Jews by nationality—originally from Gileaditis, Bashanitis and the Transjordan... They acknowledged Moses and believed that he had received laws—not this law, however, but some other. And so, they were Jews who kept all the Jewish observances, but they would not offer sacrifice or eat meat. They considered it unlawful to eat meat or make sacrifices with it. They claim that these Books are fictions, and that none of these customs were instituted by the fathers. This was the difference between the Nazarean and the others...&lt;ref&gt;[[Epiphanius of Salamis]] ({{c.|lk=no|378}}). ''[[Panarion]]''. 1:18.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{Quote|After this [[Nazarean]] sect in turn comes another closely connected with them, called the Ossaeans. These are Jews like the former... originally came from Nabataea, Ituraea, Moabitis, and Arielis, the lands beyond the basin of what sacred scripture called the Salt Sea... Though it is different from the other six of these seven sects, it causes schism only by forbidding the books of Moses like the Nazarean.&lt;ref name="panarion1-19"/&gt;}}

If it is correct to identify the community at Qumran with the Essenes (and claim that the community at Qumran are the authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls), then according to the Dead Sea Scrolls the Essenes' community school was called “Yahad” (meaning “community”) in order to differentiate themselves from the rest of the Jews who are repeatedly labeled “The Breakers of the Covenant”.

== Scholarly discussion ==

[[Josephus]] and [[Philo]] discuss the Essenes in detail. Most scholars believe that the community at Qumran that allegedly produced the Dead Sea Scrolls was an offshoot of the Essenes. However, this theory has been disputed by some; for example, [[Norman Golb]] argues that the primary research on the Qumran documents and ruins (by Father [[Roland de Vaux]], from the ''[[École Biblique|École Biblique et Archéologique de Jérusalem]]'') lacked scientific method, and drew wrong conclusions that comfortably entered the academic canon. For Golb, the number of documents is too extensive and includes many different writing styles and calligraphies; the ruins seem to have been a fortress, used as a military base for a very long period of time—including the 1st century—so they therefore could not have been inhabited by the Essenes; and the large graveyard excavated in 1870, just {{convert|50|m}} east of the Qumran ruins, was made of over 1200 tombs that included many women and children; Pliny clearly wrote that the Essenes who lived near the Dead Sea "had not one woman, had renounced all pleasure... and no one was born in their race". Golb's book presents observations about de Vaux's premature conclusions and their uncontroverted acceptance by the general academic community. He states that the documents probably stemmed from various libraries in Jerusalem, kept safe in the desert from the Roman invasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Norman |last= Golb |authorlink=Norman Golb |title= Who wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls?: the search for the secret of Qumran |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |location=New York City |year=1996 |isbn=0-684-80692-4 |oclc=35047608}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars refute these arguments—particularly since Josephus describes some Essenes as allowing marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Josephus|first= Flavius|title= Jewish War, Book II|location= Chapter 8, Paragraph 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue is the relationship between the ''Essaioi'' and Philo's ''[[Therapeutae]]'' and ''Therapeutrides''. He regarded the ''Therapeutae'' as a contemplative branch of the ''Essaioi'' who, he said, pursued an active life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philo]]. ''[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/book34.html De Vita Contemplativa]''. I.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

One theory on the formation of the Essenes suggests that the movement was founded by a Jewish high priest, dubbed by the Essenes the [[Teacher of Righteousness]], whose office had been usurped by [[Jonathan Maccabaeus|Jonathan]] (of priestly but not of [[Zadok]]ite lineage), labeled the “man of lies” or “false priest”.&lt;ref name=time20090316/&gt;&lt;ref name="elior-responds"/&gt; Others follow this line and a few argue that the Teacher of Righteousness was not only the leader of the Essenes at Qumran, but was also identical to the original Messianic figure about 150 years before the time of the Gospels.&lt;ref name=Ellegard/&gt; Fred Gladstone Bratton notes that
{{quote|The Teacher of Righteousness of the Scrolls would seem to be a prototype of [[Jesus]], for both spoke of the [[New Covenant]]; they preached a similar gospel; each was regarded as a Savior or Redeemer; and each was condemned and put to death by reactionary factions... We do not know whether Jesus was an Essene, but some scholars feel that he was at least influenced by them.&lt;ref&gt;Bratton, Fred Gladstone. 1967. ''A History of the Bible''. Boston: Beacon Press, 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[Lawrence Schiffman]] has argued that the Qumran community may be called [[Sadducees|Sadducean]], and not Essene, since their legal positions retain a link with Sadducean tradition.&lt;ref&gt;James VanderKam and Peter Flint, ''The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls'', p.251.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Connections to Christianity ==
 {{expand section|date=July 2018}}
The [[Saint Thomas Christians]] (“Nasrani”) of southwestern [[India]] may have connections with the Essenes, according to the [[Manimekalai]], one of the great [[The Five Great Epics of Tamil Literature|Tamil epic poems]], which refers to a people called “Issani”.&lt;ref name="Shattan"&gt;Manimekalai, by Merchant Prince Shattan, Gatha 27&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6157">[[Image:US Navy 030727-N-8148A-100 Lt. Richard House, Assistant Command Chaplain, (left) and Lt. Chris Chandler offer Holy Communion during the first underway Roman Catholic Mass aboard USS Ronald Reagan (CVN 76).jpg|thumb|250px|An ordinary minister (priest, foreground) and extraordinary minister (layman, background) distribute Holy Communion.]]
An '''extraordinary minister of Holy Communion''' in the [[Catholic Church]] is, under the [[Code of Canon Law]], "an acolyte, or another of Christ's faithful deputed", in certain circumstances, to distribute [[Holy Communion]]. The term "extraordinary" distinguishes such a person from the ordinary (ordained) minister of Holy Communion, namely a [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]], [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] or [[deacon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P37.HTM Canon 910, Code of Canon Law].&lt;/ref&gt;

Canon law permits that "[w]here the needs of the Church require and ministers are not available, lay people, even though they are not lectors or acolytes, can supply certain of their functions, that is, exercise the ministry of the word, preside over liturgical prayers, confer baptism and distribute Holy Communion, in accordance with the provisions of the law."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_PU.HTM Canon 230 §3, Code of Canon Law].&lt;/ref&gt; The term "lay people" does not distinguish between men and women.

==Function==
The extraordinary minister's function is to distribute Holy Communion, either within [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or by taking it to a sick person, when an ordained minister (bishop, priest or deacon) is absent or impeded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20040423_redemptionis-sacramentum_en.html ''Redemptionis sacramentum''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203210044/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20040423_redemptionis-sacramentum_en.html |date=February 3, 2008 }}, 133&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to avoid confusion about this function, an extraordinary minister of Holy Communion is not to be called a "special minister of Holy Communion", nor an "extraordinary Minister of the Eucharist", nor a "special minister of the Eucharist".&lt;ref&gt;''Redemptionis sacramentum'', 156&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten years before publication of the present Code of Canon Law, some of these expressions were used in the instruction of the Sacred Congregation of the Sacraments ''[http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CDWIMCAR.htm Immensae caritatis]'' of 29 January 1973. They are now reprobated.

The only minister of the Eucharist is the priest.&lt;ref&gt;''Redemptionis sacramentum'', 154&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appointment==

An instituted [[acolyte]] is an extraordinary minister of Holy Communion by virtue of his institution.&lt;ref name=RS155/&gt; Such acolytes are in practice seminarians or former seminarians, or those in deacon formation, although canon law allows the ministry to be conferred on any lay men ("viri laici") who have the age and qualifications that the episcopal conference is to lay down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/cod-iuris-canonici/latin/documents/cic_liberII_lt.html#TITULUS_II Code of Canon Law, canon 230 §1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_PU.HTM English translation of canon 230 §1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19720815_ministeria-quaedam_lt.html ''Ministeria quaedam'', VIII] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103110807/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19720815_ministeria-quaedam_lt.html |date=November 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The local bishop, pastor, or priest celebrant may delegate other lay Catholics for the function of extraordinary minister of Holy Communion either for a single occasion or for a specified period of time, if there are reasons of real necessity. The commissioning need not take a [[liturgy|liturgical]] form, but an appropriate blessing, which should in no way resemble ordination, may be imparted. In special cases of an unforeseen nature, the priest celebrating Mass may grant permission for a single occasion.&lt;ref name=RS155&gt;''Redemptionis sacramentum'', 155&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extraordinary, not ordinary==

"If there is usually present a sufficient number of sacred ministers for the distribution of Holy Communion, extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion may not be appointed. Indeed, in such circumstances, those who may have already been appointed to this ministry should not exercise it. The practice of those priests is reprobated who, even though present at the celebration, abstain from distributing Communion and hand this function over to laypersons."&lt;ref&gt;''Redemptionis sacramentum'', 157&lt;/ref&gt;

The extraordinary minister of Holy Communion may administer Communion only when the priest and deacon are lacking, when the priest is prevented by weakness or advanced age or some other genuine reason, or when the number of faithful coming to Communion is so great that the very celebration of Mass would be unduly prolonged. ... A brief prolongation, considering the circumstances and culture of the place, is not at all a sufficient reason."&lt;ref&gt;''Redemptionis sacramentum'', 158&lt;/ref&gt;

For a time, extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion in the United States were allowed to purify the Communion vessels (such as [[ciborium (container)|ciboria]] and [[chalice (cup)|chalice]]s), an action that the present [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]] expressly reserves for priest, deacon and instituted acolyte.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/liturgy/current/chapter4.shtml#sect4 General Instruction of the Roman Missal], 279&lt;/ref&gt; The special [[indult]] authorizing that practice for three years, beginning in 2002, was not renewed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/liturgy/cleansingofvessels.pdf Purification of Sacred Vessels by Extraordinary Ministers of Holy Communion]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding myths:==
===Aeneas=== 
[[File:Aeneas' Flight from Troy by Federico Barocci.jpg|thumb|''Aeneas flees burning Troy,'' [[Federico Barocci]], 1598. [[Galleria Borghese]],  Rome.]]
The national epic of mythical Rome, the ''[[Aeneid]]'' of [[Virgil]], tells the story of how Trojan prince [[Aeneas]] came to Italy. The ''Aeneid'' was written under [[Augustus]], who claimed ancestry through [[Julius Caesar]] from the hero and his mother [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]. According to the ''Aeneid'', the survivors from the fallen city of [[Troy]] banded together under Aeneas and underwent a series of adventures around the [[Mediterranean Sea]], including a stop at newly founded [[Carthage]] under the rule of [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Queen Dido]], eventually reaching the Italian coast. The Trojans were thought to have landed in an area between modern [[Anzio]] and [[Fiumicino]], southwest of Rome, probably at [[Laurentum]] or, in other versions, at [[Lavinium]], a place named for [[Lavinia]], the daughter of King [[Latinus]] whom Aeneas married. This started a series of armed conflicts with [[Turnus]] over the marriage of Lavinia.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica: Turnus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/610379/Turnus |title=Turnus |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=2013-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the arrival of Aeneas, Turnus was betrothed to Lavinia, who then married Aeneas, starting the war.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica: Turnus" /&gt; Aeneas won the war and killed Turnus.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica: Turnus" /&gt; The Trojans won the right to stay and to assimilate with the local peoples. The young son of Aeneas [[Ascanius]], also known as Iulus, went on to found [[Alba Longa]] and the [[Latin kings of Alba Longa|line of Alban kings]] who filled the chronological gap between the Trojan saga and the traditional founding of Rome in the 8th century BC.

Toward the end of this line, King [[Procas]] was the father of [[Numitor]] and [[Amulius]]. At Procas' death, Numitor became king of Alba Longa, but Amulius captured him and sent him to prison; he also forced Numitor's daughter [[Rhea Silvia]] to become a virgin priestess among the [[Vestals]].

===Romulus and Remus===
{{Main|Romulus and Remus}}
{{Main|Romulus}}
The myth of Aeneas was of Greek origin and had to be reconciled with the Italian myth of Romulus and Remus, who would have been born around 771 BC if taken as historical figures. They were purported to be sons of Rhea Silvia and either [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], the god of war, or the demi-god hero [[Hercules]]. They were abandoned at birth, in the manner of many [[Greek hero|mythological heroes]], because of a prophecy that they would overthrow their great-uncle [[Amulius]], who had overthrown Silvia's father [[Numitor]]. The twins were abandoned on the river [[Tiber]] by servants who took pity on the infants, despite their orders. The twins were nurtured by a [[She-wolf (Roman mythology)|she-wolf]] until a shepherd named [[Faustulus]] found the boys and took them as his sons. Faustulus and his wife [[Acca Larentia]] raised the children. When Remus and Romulus became adults, they killed Amulius and restored Numitor. They decided to establish a city; however, they quarreled, and Romulus killed his brother. Thus, Rome began with a [[fratricide]], a story that was later taken to represent the city's history of internecine political strife and bloodshed.

===Other myths===
Another story told how Romos, a son of Odysseus and Circe, was the one who founded Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Epic in Republican Rome, 1995, p. 50-51. https://books.google.se/books?isbn=0195357566&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin P. Nilsson]] speculates that this older story was becoming a bit embarrassing as Rome became more powerful and tensions with the Greeks grew. Being descendants of the Greeks was no longer preferable, so the Romans settled on the Trojan foundation myth instead. Nilsson further speculates that the name of Romos was changed by the Romans to the native name Romulus, but the name Romos (later changed to the native Remus) was never forgotten by the people, and so these two names came to stand side by side as founders of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Nilsson, Olympen, 1964, p. 264.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Date==
The ancient Romans were certain of the day Rome was founded: April 21, the day of the festival sacred to [[Pales]], goddess of shepherds, on which date they celebrated the ''Par ilia'' (or ''Palilia''). However they did not know, or they were uncertain of, the exact year the city had been founded; this is one reason they preferred to date their years by the presiding [[Roman consul|consuls]] rather than using the formula A.U.C. or [[Ab Urbe Condita]]. Several dates had been proposed by ancient authorities, and [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] records these: The Greek historian [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]], one of the first to write a history to include the Romans, stated that Rome was founded in the 38th year prior to the first [[Olympiad]], or 814/3 BC; [[Quintus Fabius Pictor]], the first Roman to write the history of his people, in Greek, stated Rome was founded in the first year of the eighth Olympiad, or 748/7 BC; [[Lucius Cincius Alimentus]] claimed Rome was founded in the fourth year of the twelfth Olympiad, or 729/8 BC; and [[Cato the Elder]] calculated that Rome was founded 432 years after the [[Trojan War]], which Dionysius states was equivalent to the first year of the seventh Olympiad, or 752/1 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus, ''Roman Antiquities'', 1.74&lt;/ref&gt; Dionysius himself provided calculations showing that Rome was founded in 751 BC, starting with the [[Battle of the Allia]], which he dated to the first year of the ninety-eighth Olympiad, 388/7 BC, then added 120 years to reach the date of the first consuls, [[Lucius Junius Brutus|Junius Brutus]] and [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus|Tarquinius Collatinus]], 508/7 BC, then added the combined total of the reigns of the [[Kings of Rome]] (244 years) to arrive at his own date, 751 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus, 1.75&lt;/ref&gt; Even the official [[Fasti|Fasti Capitolini]] offers its own date, 752 BC.

The most familiar date given for the foundation of Rome, 753 BC, was derived by the Roman antiquarian [[Titus Pomponius Atticus]], and adopted by [[Marcus Terentius Varro]], having become part of what has come to be known as the Varronian chronology.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Forsythe, ''A Critical History of Early Rome'' (Berkeley: University of California, 2005), p.&amp;nbsp;94&lt;/ref&gt; An anecdote in [[Plutarch]] where the astrologer [[Lucius Taruntius Firmanus|Lucius Tarrutius]] of Firmum provides an argument based on a non-existent eclipse and other erroneous astronomical details that Rome was founded in 753 BC suggests that this had become the most commonly accepted date.&lt;ref name=Grafton-Swerdlow&gt;Anthony Grafton and Noel Swerdlow, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/639075 "Technical Chronology and Astrological History in Varro, Censorinus, and Others"], ''Classical Quarterly'', N.S. '''35''' (1985), p.&amp;nbsp;454-65&lt;/ref&gt; Through its use by the third-century writer [[Censorinus]], whose ''De Die Natali'' was the ultimate influence of [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]]'s work to establish a scientific basis of ancient chronology, it became familiar.&lt;ref name=Grafton-Swerdlow/&gt;

Recent discoveries by [[Andrea Carandini]] on Rome's [[Palatine Hill]] have also yielded evidence of a series of fortification walls on the north slope that can be dated to the middle of the 8th century BC. According to the legend, Romulus plowed a furrow (''sulcus'') around the hill in order to mark the boundary of his new city.

==The name of Rome==
{{Further|History of Rome}}

There is no consensus on the etymology of the city's name. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712–1778) suggested [[Greek language|Greek]] "{{lang|grc|ῥώμη}}" (''{{transl|grc|rhōmē}}''), meaning "strength, vigor".&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], ''[[Social Contract (Rousseau)|The Social Contract]]'', Book IV, Chapter IV, written in 1762, where he writes in a footnote that the word for Rome is Greek in origin and means force. "There are writers who say that the name 'Rome' is derived from 'Romulus'. It is in fact Greek and means force."&lt;/ref&gt;  A modern theory of etymology holds that the name of the city is of [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] origin (and perhaps the city itself, though this cannot be proven), derived from ''rumon'', "river".&lt;ref name="baldi"&gt;{{cite book |first=Philip |last=Baldi |title=The Foundations of Latin|pages=106–7|publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeology ==
There is archaeological evidence of human occupation of the Rome area from about 14,000 years ago, but the dense layer of much younger debris obscures [[Palaeolithic]] and [[Neolithic]] sites.&lt;ref&gt;Heiken, G., Funiciello, R. and De Rita, D. (2005), The Seven Hills of Rome: A Geological Tour of the Eternal City. Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Several excavations support the view that Rome grew from pastoral settlements on the Palatine Hill built above the area of the future Roman Forum. Between the end of the [[Bronze Age]] and the beginning of the [[Iron age]], each hill between the sea and the Capitol was topped by a village (on the Capitol Hill, a village is attested since the end of the 14th century BC).&lt;ref name=coa9&gt;Coarelli (1984) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, the location that became the city of Rome was inhabited by Latin settlers from various regions, farmers and pastoralists, as evidenced by differences in pottery and burial techniques.&lt;ref name="baldi"/&gt; The historical [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]] were originally an [[Italic people|Italic tribe]] who inhabited the [[Alban Hills]].{{when|date=March 2014}} They later moved down into the valleys, which provided better land for agriculture. The area around the [[Tiber]] was particularly advantageous and offered notable strategic resources: the river was a natural border on one side, and the hills could provide a safe defensive position on the other side. This position would also have enabled the Latins to control the river and the commercial and military traffic on it from the natural observation point at [[Isola Tiberina]]. Moreover, road traffic could be controlled, since Rome was at the intersection of the principal roads to the sea coming from [[Sabinum]] (in the northeast) and [[Etruria]] (to the northwest).

There is a wide consensus that the city developed gradually through the aggregation ("synoecism") of several villages around the largest one on the Palatine. This aggregation, signalling the transition from a proto-urban to an urban settlement, was made possible by the increase in agricultural productivity above the subsistence level, which allowed the establishment of secondary and tertiary activities{{Clarify|date=April 2017}}: in turn, these boosted the development of trade with the Greek colonies of southern Italy (mainly [[Ischia]] and [[Cumae]]). All these events, which according to the archeological excavations occurred around the mid 8th century BC, can be considered as the origin of the city.&lt;ref name=coa9/&gt;

Recent studies suggest that the [[Quirinal hill]] was very important in ancient times, although the first hill to be inhabited seems to have been the [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]] (thus confirming the legend), which is also at the centre of ancient Rome. Its three peaks, the minor hills ''Cermalus'' or ''Germalus'', ''Palatium'', and ''Velia'', were united with the three peaks of the Esquiline (''Cispius'', ''Fagutal'', and ''Oppius''), and then villages on the [[Caelian Hill]] and [[Suburra]].

Recent discoveries revealed that the ''Germalus'' on the northern part of the Palatine was the site of a village (dated to the 9th century BC) with circular or [[elliptic]]al dwellings. It was protected by a clay wall (perhaps reinforced with wood), and it is likely that this is where Rome was really founded.{{Clarify|date=April 2017}}

The territory of this federation was surrounded by a sacred border called the ''[[pomerium]]'', which enclosed the so-called Servian{{Clarify|date=April 2017}}{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} expansion of Rome.

Festivals for the ''[[Septimontium]]'' (literally "of the seven hills") on December 11 were previously considered to be related to the foundation of Rome. However, April 21 is the only date for Rome's foundation upon which all the legends agree, and it has recently been argued that Septimontium celebrated the first federations among Roman hills. A similar federation was, in fact, celebrated by the Latins at [[Cave, Italy|Cave]] or at [[Monte Cavo]] (in ''[[Castelli Romani|Castelli]]'').

==Later commemoration==
During the [[Italian Renaissance]], a group of [[Italian humanism|humanists]] affiliated with the [[Roman Academies#The Renaissance|Roman Academy]] formed a [[sodality]] to pursue [[antiquarian]] interests, celebrating the "birthday of Rome" annually on April 20. In 1468, the Academy was suppressed by [[Pope Paul II]] for fomenting "republicanism, [[paganism]], and conspiracy", but the sodality was reinstated about ten years later under [[Sixtus IV]] as the ''Societas Literatorum S. Victoris in Esquiliis'' ("Literary Society of [[St. Victor (disambiguation)|Saint Victor]] on the [[Esquiline]]"). The reformed group placed itself under the new patronage of saints Victor, [[Fortunatus the Apostle|Fortunatus]], and [[Saint Genesius (disambiguation)|Genesius]], "whose [[feast day]] was conveniently proven to coincide with the [[Palilia]]". Their "Palilia" was organized by [[Pomponio Leto]] and featured speeches, a communal meal, and a poetry competition.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Fritsen, "Ludovico Lazzarelli's ''Fasti Christianae religionis'': Recipient and Context of an Ovidian Poem," in ''Myricae: Essays on Neo-Latin Literature in Memory of Jozef Ijsewijn'' (Leuven University Press, 2000), pp. 121–122.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8145">'''Fritz Neugass''' (March 28, 1899, [[Mannheim]]–June 1979, [[New York City]]) was a German art critic and photographer.

==Early life==
Fritz Neugass was of Jewish origin. His father Julius Neugass (1869-1939) was an [[Otorhinolaryngology|ear, nose and throat specialist]] in [[Mannheim]]. Neugass took part in [[World War I]] in 1917, but was released in 1918 after being seriously injured. Influenced by the [[Wandervogel]] youth movement, he temporarily turned to [[Protestantism]]. 

==Art historian==
From 1919 he studied art history and archeology in [[Munich]], [[Berlin]] and [[Bonn]] and completed his doctorate in 1924, writing a thesis on [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Choir (architecture)|choir stalls]], supervised by art historian [[Carl Neumann Degler|Carl Neumann]] (1860-1934) in [[Heidelberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000584035 Neugass, F. (1927). Mittelalterliches chorgestühl in Deutschland. Strassburg: J. H. E. Heitz.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925 he was a volunteer at the [[German Archaeological Institute|Deutschen Archäologischen Institut]] (German Archaeological Institute) in [[Rome]] and then in [[Florence]] and participated in excavations on [[Sicily]]. 

==Photographer and journalist==
In 1926 he settled in Paris and became a photographer and correspondent for numerous German and international newspapers. He reported for the ''[[Berliner Tageblatt]]'', the ''[[Vossische Zeitung]]'', [[Cicerone (publisher)|Cicerone]], ''[[KUNST Magazin|Kunst]]'', and especially Weltkunst. He became known for his reviews for world art and reports on the current [[Paris]] art scene. In addition to exhibition reports and essayistic works he wrote knowledgeable monographs on artists including [[Giorgio de Chirico|de Chirico]], [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], [[Camille Pissarro|Pissarro]], and [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]]. In autumn 1933 he was romantically involved with {{ill|Luise Straus-Ernst|de}}, first wife of [[Max Ernst]] (m. 1918–1927), who had fled to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Weissweiler, Eva | title=Notre Dame de Dada : Luise Straus-Ernst, das dramatische Leben der ersten Frau von Max Ernst | publication-date=2016 | publisher=Köln Kiepenheuer &amp; Witsch | edition=1. Auflage | isbn=978-3-462-04894-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1933-39, he set out as a photographer and correspondent traveling widely and reported for English, American, French and Swiss newspapers mainly on travel and politics in Mediterranean countries.

Shortly after the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] Neugass was interned in the camp [[Fort Carré]] in [[Antibes]]. In November 1939 he was transferred to [[Les Milles]] near [[Aix-en-Provence]]. There he met amongst others Max Ernst, [[Walter Hasenclever]] and [[Lion Feuchtwanger]]. In 1939, under the pseudonym "François Neuville" he wrote the novel ''Das Geheimnis um die Venus'' (‘The Mystery about Venus’), originally planned as a movie starring the actor [[Raimu]], which appeared in two separate Swiss newspapers. In the spring of that year he joined the French army.

As a journalist, he was accused by the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] in 1941 of distributing enemy propaganda and sentenced. In order to forestall the impending expulsion to Germany, he emigrated in late 1941 via [[Casablanca]] and [[Cuba]] to the [[United States]]. 

==Life in the United States==
From 1942 to 1947 Neugass worked in various bookstores and for the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]]. In 1944 he married librarian Lotte Labus, who had earned her own Ph.D in Berlin, and was granted American citizenship in 1947 and freelanced for several magazines, including articles illustrated with his own photographs ’Window Shopping With Your Camera’ for ''[[Popular Photography]].''&lt;ref&gt;Popular Photography, Dec 1949, Vol. 25, No. 6. pps 40-43&lt;/ref&gt; and 'Portraiture with Match and Candle' for ''The American Annual of Photography''&lt;ref&gt;The American Annual of Photography, Volume 67, p.52ff Tennant and Ward, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s he wrote for various European newspapers [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'']], ''[[Handelsblatt]]'', ''[[Aufbau]]'', and [[ARTnews|''Art News'']] and was the American correspondent to the Swiss [[Camera (magazine)|''Camera'']] magazine&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=49hTAAAAMAAJ Tom Maloney U.S. Camera Annual 1952, Page 58]&lt;/ref&gt; in which, in writing on 'The photographers of the United Nations' he expressed the opinion that “The aim of the United Nations is identical with that which lies closest to the hearts of photographers: to bring the nations closer together through mutual understanding,”&lt;ref&gt;Fritz NEUGASS, “The photographers of the United Nations.” Camera, 1954, issue 9, page 405&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibitions ==
Neugass became a member of the [[American Society of Media Photographers|American Society of Magazine Photographers]] and was exhibited in the Village Camera Club. He traveled to [[Mexico]] to make [[Ethnology|ethnological]] photographic documentation of rural life&lt;ref&gt;[http://luna.albany.edu/luna/servlet/view/search/what/Fritz+Neugass+Papers?q=neugass&amp;sort=archive_collection%2Cdate%2Ctitle%2Csubject&amp;os=0&amp;pgs=50 See University of Albany image search]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1953 which was shown in an exhibit at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in 1954. His photography was featured by [[Edward Steichen]] in two exhibitions at the [[Museum of Modern Art]]; ''Abstraction in Photography'', May 1–July 4, 1951 which featured his photographs of New York skyscrapers reflected in puddles, windows and on car duco, and [[The Family of Man|''The Family of Man'']] January 24–May 8, 1955, his contribution to the latter being made on [[Coney Island]] of swimsuit-clad couples embracing on the beach. The photograph later illustrated a 1979 book on body language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Givens, David B | author2=Center for Nonverbal Studies | title=The nonverbal dictionary of gestures, signs &amp; body language cues : from Adam's-apple-jump to zygomatic smile | publication-date=1998 | publisher=Center for Nonverbal Studies Press | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/22295917 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Legacy==
Neugass' late work as a journalist included critical evaluations of the buying policy of the museums and strategies of the art market. Due to failing health, in January 1979, Neugass turned down their offer to be American editor for the German magazine ''Kunst''. He passed away in June. A memorial exhibit of Neugass' work was held on the 15th of October 1979 at [[Goethe-Institut, New York|Goethe House]] in New York City.

His estate is kept in the [[University at Albany, SUNY|University at Albany]], New York and was compiled by Lotte Neugass (née Labus) prior to their deposit there in the M.E. Grenander Department of Special Collections. There are approximately 4500 original photographs by Neugass in the collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://meg.library.albany.edu:8443/archive/view?docId=ger007.xml Fritz Neugass Papers 1913-1979, M.E.

'''Gary DeMar''' is an American writer, lecturer and former president of [[American Vision]], an [[United States|American]] [[Christian]] nonprofit organization. The think-tank has a vision of "an America that recognizes the sovereignty of [[God]] over all of life and where [[Christians]] are engaged in every facet of [[society]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanvision.org/aboutus.asp |title=About Us |publisher=American Vision |accessdate=May 10, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422024905/http://www.americanvision.org/aboutus.asp |archivedate=April 22, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Family life and education==
DeMar resides in [[Marietta, Georgia]] with his wife Carol. They have two grown sons. DeMar is a member of Midway Presbyterian Church, affiliated with the [[Presbyterian Church in America]]. DeMar graduated from [[Western Michigan University]] in 1973 and earned a M.Div. from [[Reformed Theological Seminary]] in 1979. He earned his Ph.D. in Christian Intellectual History from [[Whitefield Theological Seminary]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.americanvision.org/about/staff-profiles/|title = Staff Profiles|publisher = American Vision|accessdate = March 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
DeMar began working at American Vision in 1981 as a [[research analyst]]. In 1986 he became the president of the organization. DeMar is the author of 25 books. Beginning on June 3, 2006, DeMar began hosting "The Gary DeMar Show," a radio program airing live from Atlanta, every Saturday at noon ET."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://americanvision.org/category/video-audio/|title = The Gary DeMar Show|publisher = American Vision}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gary DeMar Show" now is available as a podcast every weekday for 10 minutes and as a video-cast on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.americanvision.org/about/ |title = About American Vision |publisher = American Vision|accessdate = February 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeMar stepped aside as president of American Vision in 2015, and is now Senior Fellow.

Along with his work at American Vision, Gary DeMar is a contributor to the political websites Godfather Politics and Political Outcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://politicaloutcast.com/ |title=Political Outcast|first= |last= |work=politicaloutcast.com |year=2013 |accessdate=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://godfatherpolitics.com/ |title=Godfather Politics |first= |last= |work=godfatherpolitics.com |year=2013 |accessdate=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Ruler of the Nations''==
In the foreword to DeMar's book ''Ruler of the Nations'', [[John W. Whitehead]] notes that the book "presents a clear and well-substantiated description of the three types of government established by God-the [[family]], the [[Christian clergy|church]], and the civil government-each given its own specific and ''limited'' jurisdiction".&lt;ref name="RulerNationsForeword"&gt;{{cite book | first=Gary | last=DeMar | title=Ruler of the Nations| publisher=Dominion Press | location=Ft. Worth, Texas | year=1987 | editor=[[Gary North (economist)|Gary North]] | isbn=0-930462-19-X | chapter=Foreword | nopp=true| page=xix}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Editor's Introduction, [[Gary North (economist)|Gary North]] points out DeMar's description of "an intellectual war going on, a war between two rival views of God, man, law and society." North says that the "book has made the meaning of [[theocracy]] clear".&lt;ref name="RulerNationsIntroduction"&gt;{{cite book | first=Gary | last=DeMar | title=Ruler of the Nations| publisher=Dominion Press | location=Ft. Worth, Texas | year=1987 | editor=[[Gary North (economist)|Gary North]] | isbn=0-930462-19-X | chapter=Introduction| pages=x, xv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the chapter titled Reconstructing Civil Government, DeMar states,
&lt;blockquote&gt;All government requires a reference point. If God is to be pleased by men, the [[Bible]] must become the foundation of all their governments, including civil government. This means that ''Biblical law must be made the foundation of all righteous judgment in every government'': personal (self government), ecclesiastical, familial, and civil.&lt;ref name="RulerNationsReconstructing"&gt;{{cite book | first=Gary | last=DeMar | title=Ruler of the Nations| publisher=Dominion Press | location=Ft.

==Religious and political views==
DeMar states in an article on the American Vision web site, "Darwinism has secularized everything in America, including our understanding of the Constitution".&lt;ref name="constitution"&gt;{{cite news|first=Gary |last=DeMar |title=The Constitution is No More |date=November 3, 2005 |publisher=American Vision |url=http://americanvision.org/1194/constitution-no-more/ |archivedate=March 22, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xNWDYxrj?url=http://americanvision.org/1194/constitution-no-more/ |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

American Vision promotes the idea "that the world is not ending tomorrow and that Christ’s Kingdom will be victorious on the earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vallorani|first=Brandon|title=The Mustard Seed Plot|url=http://americanvision.org/702/mustard-seed-plot/|work=American Vision Blog|accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; AV connects the writings of the founders of America with the organization's vision of contemporary America: "In the New England Confederation of 1643, the Pilgrims stated: '[W]e all came to these parts of America, with one and the same end and aim, namely, to advance the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ.'”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vallorani|first=Brandon|title=Advancing the Kingdom – in God’s Strength or Our Own?|url=http://americanvision.org/673/advancing-kingdom-gods-strength-or-own/|work=American Vision Blog|accessdate=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeMar is a proponent of [[partial preterism]].

The Southern Poverty Law Center has described American Vision as an extremist group and an organization advocating "a complete theocracy governed by Old Testament law." It describes DeMar as "an outspoken anti-gay activist who regularly hosts and speaks at Christian-right events."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/gary-demar|title=Gary Demar|access-date=2016-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hinduism by country}}
Recent archaeological and other evidence suggests Hinduism has had some cultural, economic, political and religious influence in the [[Philippines]]. Among these is the 9th century [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] found in 1989, deciphered in 1992 to be [[Kawi alphabet|Kavi]] script ([[Pallava alphabet]]) with [[Sanskrit]] words;&lt;ref name=ap&gt;Postma, Antoon. (1992), The Laguna Copper-Plate Inscription: Text and Commentary, Philippine Studies, 40(2):183–203&lt;/ref&gt; the golden Agusan statue discovered in another part of Philippines in 1917 has also been linked to Hinduism.&lt;ref name=ob/&gt;

==Hinduism today==

{{refimprove section|date=November 2014}}
There is some growth in the religion as of late, although most temples cater to the same communities. Actual adherents of [[Hinduism]] are mostly limited to communities that include indigenous and native peoples, expatriate communities, as well as new converts. There are various [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|ISKCON]] groups and popular Hindu personalities and groups such as [[Sathya Sai Baba]], and [[Paramahansa Yogananda]] ([[Self-Realization Fellowship|SRF]]) that can be found. Hindu based practices like [[Yoga]] and [[meditation]] are also popular. The Personal Representative on Earth of [[Adi Da|the Supreme Divine Person]], Swāmī Mahāprabhu, has been residing in Quezon City since September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;"Swāmī Mahāprabhu" is an Iranian Australian disciple of [[Adi Da|Franklin Jones]].&lt;/ref&gt; There are also notable archery ranges named after characters in the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]] called "Kodanda Archery Range" (named after Lord Rama's bow Kodanda) and "Gandiva Archery" (named after Arjuna's bow [[Gandiva]]).
One source estimated the size of the Indian community in the Philippines in 2008 at 150,000 persons.Most of whom are hindus and christians.

At present, however, it is limited primarily to the immigrant [[Indian Filipino|Indian community]], though traditional religious beliefs in most parts of the country have strong Hindu and Buddhist influences.
Over the last three decades, a large number of civil servants and highly educated Indians working in large banks, [[Asian Development Bank]] and the [[Business process outsourcing|BPO]] sector have migrated to Philippines, especially Manila. Most of the Indian Filipinos and Indian expatriates are Hindu, Sikh or Muslims, but have assimilated into Filipino culture and some are Catholic . The community regularly conducts philanthropic activities through bodies such as the Mahaveer foundation, The SEVA foundation and the
Sathya Sai organization. Most Hindus congregate for socio-cultural and religious activities at the Hindu Temple (Mahatma Gandhi Street, Paco, Manila), the Indian Sikh Temple (United Nations Avenue, Paco, Manila), and the Radha Soami Satsang Beas center (Alabang, Muntinlupa City, Metro Manila). The late "priest" (scripture reader in Sindhi and Gurumukhi) of the Hindu Temple, Giani Joginder Singh Sethi, was active in interfaith affairs, accepted visits by school students, and organised the first major translation of Guru Nanak's Jap Ji into Filipino (Tagalog), translated by Usha Ramchandani and edited by Samuel Salter (published 2001).

There are two Hindu temples in Manila city-[[Hari Ram Temple (Paco)]] and [[Saya Aur Devi Mandir Temple (Paco)]].

[[File:Hinduism Expansion in Asia.svg|thumb|300px|Expansion of Hinduism in Southeast Asia.]]
[[File:Laguna Copperplate Inscription.gif|right|300px|thumb|The [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] (above) found in 1989 suggests Indian cultural influence in the Philippines by late 9th century AD, likely through [[Hinduism in Indonesia]], prior to the arrival of European colonial empires in the 16th century.]]
The archipelagos of [[Southeast Asia]] were under the influence of Hindu [[Kalinga people|Odisha]] and Indonesian traders through the ports of [[Hinduism in Southeast Asia|Malay-Indonesian]] islands. Indian religions, possibly an amalgamated version of Hindu-Buddhist arrived in Philippines archipelago in the 1st millennium, through the Indonesian kingdom of [[Srivijaya]] followed by [[Majapahit]]. Archeological evidence suggesting exchange of ancient spiritual ideas from India to the Philippines includes the 1.79 kilogram, 21 carat gold Hindu goddess Agusan (sometimes referred to as Golden [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]]), found in [[Mindanao]] in 1917 after a storm and flood exposed its location.&lt;ref name=govppn&gt;[http://agusandelsur.gov.ph/index/using-joomla/extensions/components/content-component/article-categories/78-demo/slides/80-golden-tara Golden Tara] Government of the Philippines&lt;/ref&gt; The statue now sits in the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in Chicago, and is dated from the period 13th to early 14th centuries.

{{Quote|A study of this image was made by Dr. F. D. K. Bosch, of [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], in 1920, who came to the conclusion that it was made by local workmen in Mindanao, copying a Ngandjuk image of the early Madjapahit period – except that the local artist overlooked the distinguishing attributes held in the hand. It probably had some connection with the Javanese miners who are known to have been mining gold in the Agusan-Surigao area in the middle or late 14th century. The image is apparently that of a [[Shaivism|Sivaite goddess]], and fits in well with the name "[[Butuan]]" (signifying [[Lingam| "phallus"]]).|[[H. Otley Beyer]]|1947&lt;ref name=ob&gt;H. Otley Beyer, "Outline Review of Philippine Archaeology by Islands and Provinces," Philippine Journal of Science, Vol.77,Nos.34 (July–August 1947),pp. 205–374&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Juan Francisco]] suggests that the golden Agusan statue may be a representation of goddess [[Shakti|Sakti]] of the Siva-Buddha ([[Bhairava]]) tradition found in Java, in which the religious aspect of [[Shiva]] is integrated with those found in Buddhism of [[Java]] and [[Sumatra]]. The [[Rajahnate of Butuan]], in present-day Agusan del Norte and Butuan City, used Hinduism as its main religion along with indigenous Lumad nature-worships. A Hindu Tamil King of the [[Rajahnate of Cebu]] was also recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Francisco (1963), ''A Note on the Golden Image of Agusan'', Philippine Studies vol. 11, no. 3 (1963): 390—400&lt;/ref&gt;

Another gold artifact, from the [[Tabon Caves]] in the island of [[Palawan]], is an image of [[Garuda]], the bird who is the mount of [[Vishnu]]. The discovery of sophisticated Hindu imagery and gold artifacts in Tabon Caves has been linked to those found from [[Oc Eo]], in the [[Mekong Delta]] in Southern [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name=atnb/&gt; These archaeological evidence suggests an active trade of many specialized goods and gold between India and Philippines and coastal regions of [[Vietnam]] and China. Golden jewelry found so far include rings, some surmounted by images of [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] – the sacred bull, linked chains, inscribed gold sheets, gold plaques decorated with repoussé images of Hindu deities.&lt;ref name=atnb&gt;Anna T. N. Bennett (2009), [http://archeosciences.revues.org/2072 Gold in early Southeast Asia], ''ArcheoSciences'', Volume 33, pp 99–107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dang V.T. and Vu, Q.H., 1977. The excavation at Giong Ca Vo site. ''Journal of Southeast Asian Archaeology'' 17: 30–37&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, a laborer working in a sand mine at the mouth of [[Lumbang]] River near [[Laguna de Bay]] found a copper plate in [[Wawa, Pilar|Barangay Wawa]], [[Lumban]].&lt;ref name=govppn/&gt; This discovery, is now known as the Laguna Copperplate Inscription by scholars. It is the earliest known written document found in the Philippines, dated to be from the 9th century AD, and was deciphered in 1992 by Dutch anthropologist [[Antoon Postma]].&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; The copperplate inscription suggests economic and cultural links between the Tagalog people of Philippines with the Javanese [[Medang Kingdom]], the Srivijaya empire, and the Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms of India. Hinduism in the country declined when [[Islam]] was introduced by traders from [[Arabia]] which was then followed by Christianity from Spain.&lt;ref name=govppn/&gt; This is an active area of research as little is known about the scale and depth of Philippine history from the 1st millennium and before.

==Folklore, arts and literature==
Many fables and stories in Filipino Culture are linked to Indian arts, such as the story of [[The Turtle and the Monkey|the monkey and the turtle]], the race between deer and snail (slow and steady wins the race), and the hawk and the hen. Similarly, the major epics and folk literature of Philippines show common themes, plots, climax and ideas expressed in the [[Mahabharata]] and the [[Ramayana]].&lt;ref&gt;Maria Halili (2010), Philippine History, {{ISBN|978-9712356360}}, Rex Books, 2nd Edition, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Indologist]]s [[Juan R. Francisco]] and [[Josephine Acosta Pasricha]], Hindu influences and folklore arrived in Philippines by about 9th to 10th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Mellie Leandicho Lopez (2008), ''A Handbook of Philippine Folklore'', University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-9715425148}}, pp xxiv – xxv&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Maranao people|Maranao]] version is the ''Maharadia Lawana'' (King Rāvaṇa of Hindu Epic Ramayana).&lt;ref&gt;Manuel, E. Arsenio (1963), ''A Survey of Philippine Folk Epics'', Asian Folklore Studies, 22, pp 1–76&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ==
With the advent of [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish colonialism]] in the 16th century, the Philippines became a closed colony and cultural contacts with other Southeast Asian countries were limited, if not closed. In 1481, the [[Spanish Inquisition]] commenced with the permission of [[Pope Sixtus IV]] and all non-Catholics within the Spanish empire were to be expelled or to be "put to the question" (tortured until they renounced their previous faith). With the re-founding of [[Manila]] in 1571, the Philippines became subject to the [[King of Spain]], and the Archbishop of New Galicia ([[Mexico]]) became the Grand Inquisitor of the Faithful in Mexico and the Philippines. In 1595, the newly appointed [[Archbishop of Manila]] became the Inquisitor-General of the [[Spanish East Indies]] (i.e.,the Philippines, [[Guam]], and [[Micronesia]]), and until 1898 was active against Protestants, Buddhists, Hindus and Muslims. As was the case in Latin America and Africa, forced conversions were not uncommon and any refusal to submit to Church authority was seen as both rebellion against the Pope and sedition against the Spanish Crown, which was punishable by death.

Linguistic influence left lasting marks on every [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine language]]. Below are some borrowed terms, which were often Buddhist and Hindu concepts, with the original [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]; some of the words in many Philippine languages are loaned from Sanskrit and [[Tamil language|Tamil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/opinion/view/20091011-229561/The-Indian-in-the-Filipino |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621051322/http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/opinion/view/20091011-229561/The-Indian-in-the-Filipino |archivedate=21 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various attempts have been made to reconstruct when Sabbatical years actually fell using clues in the Biblical text and events clearly dated in fixed historically understood calendars. This is important because the system of [[Jubilee (biblical)|Jubilee]] and Sabbatical ([[Shmita]]) years provides a useful check in deciding between competing reconstructions of the histories of the [[First Temple]] period and earlier and the history of the [[Second Temple]] period and later. There are explicit mentions of a Sabbatical year found in [[Josephus]], [[1 Maccabees]], and in various legal contracts from the time of [[Simon bar Kokhba]]. In contrast, no direct statements that a certain year was a Sabbatical year have survived from First Temple times and earlier.

Year of entry into the land: 1 Kings 6:1 and Joshua 5:6.

===The Sabbatical year 868/867 BCE===
Another public reading of the Law, suggesting a Sabbatical year, took place in the third year of [[Jehoshaphat]] (2 Chronicles 17:7-9). According to the widely accepted Biblical chronology of [[Edwin R. Thiele|Edwin Thiele]], Jehoshaphat began a coregency with his father [[Asa of Judah|Asa]] in 872/871 BCE, and his sole reign began in 870/869.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin R. Thiele, ''The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings'' (3rd. ed.; Grand Rapids: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983) 85,  217.&lt;/ref&gt; The passage about the reading of the law in Jehoshaphat's third year does not specify whether this is measured from the beginning of the coregency or the beginning of the sole reign, but since the two synchronisms to Jehoshaphat's reign for the kings of Israel (1 Kings 22:51, 2 Kings 3:1) are measured from the start of the sole reign, it would be reasonable to determine Jehoshaphat's third year in the same way. In Thiele's system, this would be 867/866. However, Thiele's years for the first few kings of Judah has come under criticism as being one year too late, because of problems that appear in the reign of Ahaziah and Athaliah that Thiele never solved. Therefore, in 2003, an article by [[Rodger C. Young|Rodger Young]] showed that the texts that Thiele could not reconcile were in harmony when it was assumed that Solomon died before Tishri 1 in the (Nisan-based) year in which the kingdom divided, rather than in the half-year after Tishri 1 as assumed, without explanation, by Thiele.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger C. Young, “When Did Solomon Die?”  ''Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society'' 46 (2003) 589–603.[https://www.academia.edu/2158881/When_Did_Solomon_Die]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 [[Leslie McFall]], who is recognized in Finegan's ''Handbook of Biblical Chronology'' as the foremost living interpreter of Thiele's work,&lt;ref&gt;Finegan, ''Handbook'' 246.&lt;/ref&gt; agreed with Young’s correction that moved dates for Jehoshaphat and the preceding kings of Judah up one year,&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Mcfall, “Do the Sixty-nine Weeks of Daniel Date the Messianic Mission of Nehemiah Or Jesus?” ''Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society'' 52 (2009) 690, n. 43; McFall, “The Chronology of Saul and David,” ''Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society'' 53 (2010) 533 (chart).&lt;/ref&gt; as have some other recent works by evangelicals and [[Creationism|creationists]] studying this the field.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew E. Steinmann, ''From Abraham to Paul: A Biblical Chronology'' (St. Louis: Concordia, 2011) 138, 141 (Table 31).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bryant G. Wood, “The Rise and Fall of the 13th-Century Exodus-Conquest Theory,” ''Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society'' 48 (2005): 477, 488.[http://www.biblearchaeology.org/post/2008/04/17/The-Rise-and-Fall-of-the-13th-Century-Exodus-Conquest-Theory.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Petrovich, “The Ophel Pithos Inscription: Its Dating, Language, Translation, and Script,” ''Palestine Exploration Quarterly'' 147 (2015) 142. Young’s revised table of Judean kings is available [https://www.academia.edu/2158836/Tables_of_Reign_Lengths_from_the_Hebrew_Court_Recorders here (Table 2, p. 246).]&lt;/ref&gt; With this resolution to Thiele’s problem, the year in which Jehoshaphat had the Law read to the people was 868/867. This is 294 years, or 42 Sabbatical cycles, before Ezekiel's Jubilee. The 42 Sabbatical cycles would make six Jubilee cycles, so it was also a Jubilee year. It is of some passing interest that in 1869, long before the breakthroughs of [[Valerius Coucke]] and Thiele that solved the basic problems of how the biblical authors were measuring the years, Ferdinand Hitzig stated that the occasion for Jehoshaphat’s proclamation was because it was a Jubilee year.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand Hitzig, ''Geschichte des Volkes Israel'' (Leipzig: S. Hirzel, 1869) 1.9 and 198–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Sabbatical year 700/699 BCE===
If 574/573 marked a Jubilee, and if the Sabbatical cycles were in phase with the Jubilees, then 700/699 BCE, the year often mentioned as a possible Sabbatical year because of the land lying fallow during that year (Isaiah 37:30, 2 Kings 19:29), was also a Sabbatical, 126 years or 18 Sabbatical cycles before Ezekiel's Jubilee. Assuming a 49-year cycle, the nearest Jubilee would have been in 721 BC, inconsistent with attempts to place a Jubilee after the Sabbatical year at this time. If a 50-year Jubilee cycle is assumed, the nearest Jubilee would be 724/723, and then assuming that a Sabbatical cycle began in the year following a Jubilee, neither 701/700 nor 700/699 would be a Sabbatical year.

Could the passages in Isaiah 37 and 2 Kings 19 be referring to two voluntary fallow years? This might be possible if the Jubilee year was a 50th year separate from the seventh Sabbatical/Shmita year. Young presents a linguistic argument against this interpretation, as follows: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Others have imagined that Isa 37:30 and its parallel in 2 Kgs 19:29 refer to a Sabbatical year followed by a Jubilee year, since the prophecy speaks of two years in succession in which there would be no harvest. But the first year could not be a Sabbatical year, because in it the people were allowed to eat “what grows of itself,” for which the Hebrew word is '''&lt;big&gt; ספיח &lt;/big&gt;'''. In Lev 25:5 the reaping of the '''&lt;big&gt;ספיח&lt;/big&gt;''' is forbidden during a Sabbatical year. Whatever the exact meaning is for this word, its use in Isaiah’s prophecy and its prohibition in Lev 25:5 means that the first year of the Isaiah and Second Kings passages could not have been a Sabbatical year. This rules out the possibility that the passage is dealing with a Sabbatical year followed by a year of Jubilee. The proper understanding of the passage is that the harvest of the first year had been destroyed by the Assyrians, and the defeat of the Assyrian army came too late in the year to allow sowing that year. The destruction of the Assyrian host came the night after the giving of the prophecy (2 Kgs 19:35), so the reason that sowing and reaping were forbidden for the next year must have been because that year, the second year of the prophecy, was going to be a Sabbatical year.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger C. Young, “The Talmud’s Two Jubilees and Their Relevance to the Date of the Exodus,” ''Westminster Theological Journal'' 68 (2006) p. 76, n. 11.[http://www.rcyoung.org/articles/jubilee.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The Sabbatical year 623/622 BCE===
It has already been mentioned that the Babylonian Talmud (''Megillah'' 14b) and the ''Seder Olam'' (ch. 24) mentioned a Jubilee in Josiah's 18th year, 623/622 BCE. With the proper assumption of a 49-year cycle for the Jubilee, the Jubilee would be identical to the seventh Sabbatical year, so that the Jubilee and Sabbatical cycles would never be out of synchronization. 623/622 BCE would therefore also have been a Sabbatical year. In Sabbatical years, the Mosaic code specified that the Law was to be read to all the people (Deuteronomy 31:10-11). Although this commandment, like so many others, was probably neglected throughout most of Israel's history, it was observed in Josiah's 18th year (2 Kings 23:1,2). 

===The Sabbatical year 588/587 BCE===
Various scholars have conjectured that [[Zedekiah]]'s release of slaves, described in Jeremiah 34:8-10, would likely have been done at the start of a Sabbatical year.&lt;ref&gt;William Whiston, "Dissertation V, Upon the Chronology of Josephus," ''Josephus: Complete Works'' (trans. Wm. Whiston; Grand Rapids: Kregel, 1964), 703. Originally published in 1737.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cyrus Gordon, "Sabbatical Cycle or Seasonal Pattern?" ''Orientalia'' 22 (1953): 81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nahum Sarna, "Zedekiah's Emancipation of Slaves and the Sabbatical Year," ''Orient and Occident: Essays presented to Cyrus H. Gordon on the Occasion of his Sixty-fifth Birthday'' (ed. Harry Hoffner, Jr.; Neukirchen: Butzon &amp; Bercker Kevelaer, 1973), 143-149.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the original Mosaic legislation stated that an indentured servant's term of service was to end six years after the service started (Deuteronomy 15:12), later practice was to associate the Sabbatical year, called a year of release (''shemitah'') in Deuteronomy 15:9, with the release of slaves. Based on a chronological study of Ezekiel 30:20-21, [[Nahum Sarna]] dated Zedekiah's emancipation proclamation to the year beginning in Tishri of 588 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Sarna, "Zedekiah's Emancipation," 144-145.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Zedekiah's release of slaves could have occurred at any time, the occurrence of a Sabbatical year at just this time provides some insight into the background that probably influenced Zedekiah's thinking, even though the release was later rescinded.

The year 588/587 BCE was also the year that Jerusalem fell to the Babylonians, consistent with the Babylonian records for the reign of Amel-Marduk and the Scriptural data regarding Jehoiachin and Zedekiah. This is in keeping with the statement in Seder Olam chapter 30, properly translated as discussed above, that put the burning of the First Temple, as well as the Second, in the "latter part" of a Sabbatical year. The statement of the Seder Olam in this regard is repeated in the [[Tosefta]] (''Taanit'' 3:9), the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (''Ta'anit'' 4:5), and three times in the Babylonian Talmud (''Arakin'' 11b, ''Arakin 12a'', ''Ta'anit'' 29a). An example of the caution that must be exercised when consulting English translations is shown by the Soncino translation in ''Arakin'' 11b, that the Temple was destroyed "at the end of the seventh [Sabbatical] year",&lt;ref&gt;''The Babylonian Talmud'' (London: Soncino Press, 1938).&lt;/ref&gt; compared to [[Jacob Neusner]]'s translation of the corresponding passage in the Jerusalem Talmud, that it was "the year after the Sabbatical year."&lt;ref&gt;''Taanit'' 4:5 in ''The Talmud of the Land of Israel'', tr. Jacob Neusner (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Sabbatical year 574/573 BCE===
A convenient starting place for the study of Sabbatical years in the time of the First Temple is the Jubilee that the Babylonian Talmud (tractate ''Arakin'' 12a), and also the Seder Olam (chapter 11), say was the 17th and which began at the time that [[Ezekiel]] saw the vision the occupies the last nine chapters of his book. Although many of the chronological statements of the two Talmuds, as well as in the Seder Olam that preceded them, have been shown to be unhistorical, this particular statement has considerable evidence to support its historicity. One of these evidences is the consistency of this reference with the other Jubilee mentioned in the Talmud and the ''Seder Olam'' (ch. 24), which is placed in the 18th year of [[Josiah]] (''Megillah'' 14b). Ezekiel's vision occurred in the 25th year of the captivity of [[Jehoiachin]] (Ezekiel 40:1). Babylonian records state that [[Amel-Marduk]] (the Biblical Evil-Merodach) began to reign in October 562 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Parker and Waldo H. Dubberstein, ''Babylonian Chronology 626 B.C. – A.D. 75'' (Providence: Brown University, 1956) 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and 2 Kings 25:27 says that it was in the twelfth month of this accession year (Adar, 561 BCE) and in Jehoiachin's 37th year of captivity that Jehoiachin was released from prison. By Judean reckoning, Jehoiachin's 37th year would then be 562/561 BCE. His 25th year, the year in which Ezekiel saw his vision, is therefore determined as 574/573 BCE, i.e. the year that began in Tishri of 574. Josiah's 18th year, at which time the Talmud says there was another Jubilee, began in 623 BCE, as can be determined from Babylonian records dating the Battle of [[Carchemish]], which occurred shortly after Josiah was slain in his 31st year (2 Kings 22:3, 23:29). This is 49 years before Ezekiel's Jubilee, providing evidence that the Jubilee cycle was 49 years, not 50 years as is accepted by many interpreters, but which has been challenged by recent work such as the study of [[Jean-François Lefebvre]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean-François Lefebvre, ''Le Jubilé Biblique: Lv 25 — Exégèse et Théologie'' (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 2003) 154-166.&lt;/ref&gt; Zuckermann also held that the Jubilee cycle was 49 years,&lt;ref&gt;Zuckermann, ''Treatise'' 20.&lt;/ref&gt; as did Robert North in his notable study of the Jubilees.&lt;ref&gt;Robert North, ''Sociology of the Biblical Jubilee'' (Rome: Pontifical Biblical Institute, 1954) 2, 109–134.&lt;/ref&gt; A fuller discussion of the reasons that the Jubilee cycle was 49 years can be found in the [[Jubilee (Biblical)|Jubilee]] article, where it is pointed out that the known chronological methods of the Talmuds and the Seder Olam were incapable of correctly calculating the time between Josiah's 18th year and the 25th year of the captivity of Jehoiachin, indicating that these remembrances of Jubilees were historical, not contrived.

That Ezekiel saw his vision at the beginning of a Jubilee year is also shown by his statement that it was "in the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, on [[Rosh Hashanah]], on the tenth day of the month…;" (Ezekiel 40:1). It was only in a Jubilee year that Rosh Hashanah (New Year's Day) came on the tenth of Tishri (Leviticus 25:9), the [[Yom Kippur|Day of Atonement]]. The Seder Olam, in relating that Ezekiel's vision was at the beginning of a Jubilee, does not cite the part of Ezekiel 40:1 that says it was Rosh Hashanah and the tenth of the month, indicating that the fact that a Jubilee was commencing was based on historical remembrance, not on just the textual argument regarding Rosh Hashanah being on the tenth of the month. Ezekiel also says it was 14 years after the city fell; 14 years before 574/573 BCE was 588/587 BCE, in agreement with "the 25th year of our captivity."

==Sabbatical years in the Second Temple period==
The first modern treatise devoted to the Sabbatical (and Jubilee) cycles was that of [[Benedict Zuckermann]].&lt;ref&gt;Benedict Zuckermann, ''Treatise on the Sabbatical Cycle and the Jubilee'', trans. A Löwy; (New York: Hermon, 1974); originally published as "Ueber Sabbatjahrcyclus und Jobelperiode," in ''Jahresbericht des jüdisch-theologischen Seminars "Fraenckelscher Stiftung"'' (Breslau, 1857).&lt;/ref&gt; Zuckermann insisted that for Sabbatical years after the [[Babylonian exile]] "it is necessary to assume the commencement of a new starting-point, since the laws of Sabbatical years and Jubilees fell into disuse during the Babylonian captivity, when a foreign nation held possession of the land of Canaan . . . We therefore cannot agree with chronologists who assume an unbroken continuity of septennial Sabbaths and Jubilees."&lt;ref&gt;Zuckermann, ''Treatise''., 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Seder Olam Rabbah|Seder Olam]] (ch. 30) is explicit that this was the case, i.e. that the returned exiles had a renewed start of tithes, Sabbatical years, and Jubilee years. The first instance of a Sabbatical year treated by Zuckermann was [[Herod the Great]]'s siege of Jerusalem, as described by [[Josephus]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Ant]]''.14.16.2/470-76, 15.1.2/7.&lt;/ref&gt; Zuckermann assigned this to 38/37 BCE, i.e. he considered that a Sabbatical year started in [[Tishri]] of 38 BCE. Next, he considered [[John Hyrcanus]]'s siege of Ptolemy in the fortress of Dagon, which is described both in Josephus (''[[Jewish Antiquities|Ant]]''. 13.8.1/235; ''[[The Wars of the Jews|Wars of the Jews]]'' 1.2.4/59-60) and 1 Maccabees (16:14-16), and during which a Sabbatical year started; from the chronological information provided in these texts, Zuckermann concluded that 136/135 BCE was a Sabbatical year. The next event to be treated was [[Antiochus V|Antiochus Eupator]]'s siege of the fortress [[Beth-zur]] (''Ant''. 12.9.5/378, 1 Maccabees 6:53), dated by Zuckermann to 163/162 BCE. However, he also remarked on the difficulties presented to this figure by the text in 1 Maccabees, which would seem to date the siege one year later, and so he decided to leave it out of consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Zuckermann, ''Treatise'' 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt; The final text considered by Zuckermann was a passage in the Seder Olam that relates the destruction of the Second Temple to a Sabbatical year, an event that is known from secular history to have happened in the summer of 70 CE. Zuckermann interpreted the Seder Olam text as stating that this happened in a year after a Sabbatical year, thus placing a Sabbatical in 68/69 CE.

All these dates as calculated by Zuckermann are separated by an integral multiple of seven years, except for the date associated with the siege of [[Beth-zur]]. Furthermore, his chronology is consistent with that accepted by the ''[[geonim]]'' (medieval Jewish scholars) and the calendar of Sabbatical years used in present-day [[Israel]].{{cn|date=September 2017}} All of this would seem to be strong evidence in favor of Zuckermann's scheme. Nevertheless, some problems have been recognized, beyond just the question of the siege of Beth-zur, which was one year too late for Zuckermann's calendar. A consistent problem has been the ambiguity alleged in some of the passages, notably of Josephus, where it has been questioned, for example, when Josephus started the regnal years of [[Herod the Great]]. In a study the chronology of all Herod’s reign, [[Andrew Steinmann]] presents arguments in favor of dating Herod’s capture of Jerusalem in 10 Tishre of 37 BCE, i.e. just after the Sabbatical year of 38/37, based on references to the activities of [[Mark Antony]] and [[Sossius]], Herod’s helpers, in [[Cassius Dio]] (49.23.1–2) and also on other considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew E. Steinmann, “When Did Herod the Great Reign?” ''Novum Testamentum'' 51 (2009) 8–11.[https://www.academia.edu/9786536/When_Did_Herod_the_Great_Reign].&lt;/ref&gt; This date is in agreement with [[Ben Zion Wacholder]]’s chronology. Therefore, many modern scholars have adopted a Sabbatical year calendar for the Second Temple period that is one year later, although there are many prominent scholars who still maintain a cycle consistent with Zuckermann's conclusion of a 38/37 BCE Sabbatical year.

Among those who have advocated an adjustment to Zuckermann's chronology, the most extensive studies in its favor have been those of Ben Zion Wacholder.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Zion Wacholder, "The Calendar of Sabbatical Cycles During the Second Temple and the Early Rabbinic Period," ''[[Hebrew Union College Annual|HUCA]]'' 44 (1973) 53-196; "Chronomessianism: The Timing of Messianic Movements and the Calendar of Sabbatical Cycles," ''HUCA'' 46 (1975) 201-218; "The Calendar of Sabbath Years during the Second Temple Era: A Response," ''HUCA'' 54 (1983) 123-133.&lt;/ref&gt; Wacholder had access to legal documents from the time of the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] that were not available to Zuckermann. The arguments of Wacholder and others to support the calendar one year later than that of Zuckermann are rather technical and will not be presented here, except for two items to which Zuckermann, Wacholder, and other scholars have given great weight: 1) the date of Herod’s capture of Jerusalem from Antigonus, and 2) the testimony of the Seder Olam relating the [[destruction of the Second Temple]] to a Sabbatical year. Wacholder gives the dates of post-exilic Sabbatical years in the following table:&lt;ref&gt;Ben Zion Wacholder, ''Essays on Jewish Chronology and Chronography'' (New York: Ktav, 1976) 6–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seder Olam and the Sabbaticals associated with the destructions of the Temples==
The principal author of the Seder Olam, [[Rabbi Jose]], was a pupil of the famous [[Rabbi Akiva]]. Jose was a young man when the Romans destroyed Jerusalem and burned the Temple. On such an important issue as the year in which the Temple was destroyed, it would be logical that Jose's ideas were taken from his mentor and his mentor's contemporaries.

Chapter 30 of the Seder Olam gives the year that both Temples were destroyed as ''ve-motsae sheviit'' &lt;big&gt;(ומוצאי שבעית&lt;/big&gt;). [[Heinrich Guggenheimer]]'s recent translation&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Guggenheimer, ''Seder Olam - The Rabbinic View of Biblical Chronology'' (Lanham MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2005) 264.&lt;/ref&gt; renders this phrase as "at the end of a Sabbatical year," thus unambiguously supporting the Wacholder calendar that starts a Sabbatical year in the fall of 69 CE. The problem, however, is that many translations of the Seder Olam render the phrase as "in the year after a Sabbatical year" or its equivalent. This was the sense adopted by Zuckermann when citing the Seder Olam as supportive of his calendar of Sabbatical years. The same Hebrew phrase is used in the [[Babylonian Talmud]] when citing this passage from the Seder Olam, and some modern translations of the Talmud into English translate the phrase in the sense given by Guggenheimer, while others translate it in the sense of "the year after." The Seder Olam uses the same phrase regarding a Sabbatical year for the destruction of both Temples, so that its testimony in this regard is important for dating the ''shemitot'' in both pre-exilic and post-exilic times. Therefore, it would seem necessary to closely examine the phrase in the original Hebrew when making chronological decisions. Unfortunately, this was not done, either by Zuckermann,&lt;ref&gt;Zuckermann, ''Treatise'', 48.&lt;/ref&gt;  Wacholder,&lt;ref&gt;Ben Zion Wacholder, ''Essays in Jewish Chronology and Chronography'' (New York: Ktav, 1976) 19-22.&lt;/ref&gt;  or Finegan,&lt;ref&gt;Jack Finegan, ''Handbook of Biblical Chronology'' (rev. ed.; Peabody MA: Hendrickson, 1998) 122.&lt;/ref&gt; when citing the Seder Olam's testimony as decisive for their particular calendars of Sabbatical years. Most interpreters have simply relied on an existing translation, and that translation may have been unduly influenced by an attempt to make the translation consistent with the chronology of the geonim that placed the end of the Second Temple in a post-Sabbatical year.

At least one study has addressed this problem, arguing from both a linguistic standpoint and from a study of related texts in the Seder Olam that the phrase ''ve-motsae sheviit'' should be translated as something close to "and in the latter part of a Sabbatical year," consistent with Guggenheimer's translation and Wacholder's calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger C. Young, "''Seder Olam'' and the Sabbaticals Associated With the Two Destructions of Jerusalem: Part I," ''Jewish Bible Quarterly'' 34 (2006) 173-179; [http://jbq.jewishbible.org/assets/Uploads/343/343_Sedero1.pdf] Part II, ''JBQ'' 34 252-259.[http://jbq.jewishbible.org/assets/Uploads/344/344_sedero21.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; This recent study argues that a comparative study of the word ''motsae'' (literally, "goings-out") does not support any sense of "after" ("after a Sabbatical year"). Further, the reference of the Seder Olam to a Sabbatical year associated with [[Jeconiah|Jehoiachin]] is in keeping with a Sabbatical year when the First Temple was burned a few years later, but the Seder Olam would be in conflict with itself if the phrase in chapter 30 was interpreted as saying that the burning was in a post-Sabbatical year.

==Jubilee and Sabbatical years as a long-term calendar for Israel==
The Jubilee and Sabbatical year provided a long-term means for dating events, a fact that must have become obvious soon after the legislation was put into effect. It is of some interest, then, that the Babylonian Talmud (tractate ''Sanhedrin'' 40a,b) records that in the time of the judges, legal events such as contracts or criminal cases were dated according to the Jubilee cycle, the Sabbatical cycle within the Jubilee cycle, and the year within the Sabbatical cycle. The Samaritan community apparently used this method of dating as late as the 14th century CE, when an editor of one of the writings of the Samaritans wrote that he finished his work in the sixty-first Jubilee cycle since the entry into Canaan, in the fourth year of the fifth Sabbatical of that cycle.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Judaica'' (Jerusalem: Keter, 1972), 14, col. 751.&lt;/ref&gt; These cases of usage of the Jubilee/Sabbatical cycles make no provision for the possibility of the Sabbatical cycles being out of phase with the Jubilee cycles, which is additional evidence that the Jubilee was contemporaneous with the seventh Sabbatical year.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5653">'''Kalinga II''' (Odia: '''ଦ୍ବିତୀୟ କଳିଙ୍ଗ''') was a powerful monarch and possibly an emperor from around the speculated era towards the end of 7th Century B.C.E. He was the son of [[Chullakalinga]], the youngest son of Kalinga I who had married a virtuous princess from [[Sagala]] ([[Madra]]) . Kalinga II ascended the throne of the ancient state of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] after the death of his paternal uncle Mahakalinga.  Kalinga II finds mention in early Buddhist [[Jataka tales|Jataka]] records of Chullakalinga Jataka (named after his father) and Kalingabodhi Jataka.  He had spent most of his young life in the forests of [[Himavat]] where his father lived in exile. Trained with qualities of a king by his father and maternal grandfather, he was asked by Chullakalinga to go back to take the charge of his ancestral kingdom.

== Coronation as the King of Kalinga &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/j4/j4043.htm|title=The Jataka, Vol. IV, tr. by W.H.D. Rouse, [1901]|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sacred-texts.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.what-buddha-said.net/library/DPPN/ka/kaalingabodhi_jat_479.htm|title=Kālingabodhi Jātaka (No.479)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.what-buddha-said.net|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
On the request from his father, Kalinga II arrived at Kalinga with the three tokens  (a ring with a seal, coverlet and sword) from his father to be shown as symbols of his identity to the courtier Kalinga Bharadvaja who helped his father escape arrest by Mahakalinga. The new king was taught ceremonial and ritualistic rights by Kalinga Bharadvaja and ascended the throne inheriting many precious gifts on the fifteenth day of his coronation.

== Encounter with the Divine Powers of the Bodhi Tree &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jataka Tales - Scholar s Choice Edition (Paperback) by H T 1837-1924 Francis, E J 1869- Thomas|last=|first=|publisher=Scholar s Choice, United States|year=2015|isbn=9781295997596|location=United States|pages=346–348}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
The Jatakas narrate that after becoming the king, Kalinga II wished to visit his parents in the forest and rode on his royal elephant towards the forest. He encountered the Bodhi Tree circuit obstructing his way where [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] had meditated and had got rid of all the worldly desires of the flesh. Out of impatience and unawareness, Kalinga II tries to make his elephant break through the tree repeatedly. Due to pain endured by repeated hitting of the holy [[Bodhi Tree]], the elephant died while the tree stood at its place without moving. Kalinga Bharadvaja made the king aware of the tree's magical and spiritual power eventually and hence the king gave up imparting force. For seven days Kalinga II worshiped the Bodhi tree circuit with fragrance filled ingredients only after which he was able to pass through the place.

== War with King Aruna of Assaka and Defeat &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/j3/j3002.htm|title=The Jataka, Vol. III, tr. by H.T. Francis and R.A. Neil, [1897] No. 301. CULLAKĀLIṄGA-JĀTAKA.|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sacred-texts.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orissalinks.com/odia/classical3.pdf|title=Classical Odia|last=|first=|date=|website=www.orissalinks.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
Chullakalinga Jataka narrates about the war affairs between Assaka and Kalinga kingdoms in the final decades of the 7th Century B.C.E. Also corroborated by Kalingabodhi Jataka, the nature of Kalinga II is depicted as warring and beholding the high dignity for his royal status. Pertaining to this Kalinga II declared that he would marry off his four beautiful daughters to any warrior royalty who can defeat him and his army in the battle. To challenge other kingdoms on this declaration, he sent out his daughters on a well decorated chariot with escorts to surrounding kingdoms on which none dared to stop due to his power until it entered Assaka kingdom. There the king Aruna who was equally powerful and also jealous of Kalinga's glory stopped the chariot and took the four princess as captive. With the helpful advises from his minister Nandisena, he was able to defeat the overpowering forces of Kalinga in a long stretched battle though the initial efforts had taken Kalinga II close to victory. This war is believed to be fought at the frontier areas of Assaka and Kalinga according to the Jatakas where the two forces met up at the cross roads of the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] but  initially only stalked at each other without crossing the boundary between the two empires. Kalinga II had to give up his daughters hand in marriage to Aruna along with a large amount of dowry after the defeat.

== Conclusion ==
Kalinga II was a powerful king and did maintain military superiority over other kingdoms. Though defeated in the battle with Assaka, the ability to march up his forces to its frontiers in the Deccan region shows the territorial extent of his empire could very well be large and not confined to the regions of Odisha and Northern Andhra (the heart land of ancient Kalinga kingdom). Kalinga II was also lenient towards Buddhist ideals as it is found in the narration relating to his encounter with the divine powers of the Bodhi tree.

'''Kenduri''' or '''selametan''' or '''kenduren''' ([[Javanese people|Jawa]] call for kenduri) is a [[Javanese people|Javanese]] ritual. Kenduri is a [[banquet]] for remembering something, requesting blessing, and other religious ceremonies. 

Kenduri is usually a gathering of a community and is led by the oldest person or someone who has a religion knowledge. The gathering is usually solely for the male population. For women, this banquet give them a chance to socialise while they prepare a meal for the Kenduri.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23801">'''Mormon fundamentalist leaders''' are those who lead (or have led) a [[Mormon fundamentalism|Mormon fundamentalist]] group.
{{LDSpolygamy}}
==Early Mormon leaders==
These leaders were the first three Presidents of the Church of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. The first three LDS Church presidents are:
*[[Joseph Smith]] (1829–44)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Joseph Smith Jr., 1st President of the Church | work = History of the Church | publisher = The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints | date = 2004 | url = http://www.lds.org/churchhistory/presidents/controllers/potcController.jsp?leader=1&amp;topic=facts | accessdate = 1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Brigham Young]] (1847–77)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Brigham Young, 2nd President of the Church | work = History of the Church | publisher = The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints | date = 2004 | url = http://www.lds.org/churchhistory/presidents/controllers/potcController.jsp?leader=2&amp;topic=facts | accessdate = 1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[John Taylor (Mormon)|John Taylor]] (1877–87)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = John Taylor, 3rd President of the Church | work = History of the Church | publisher = The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints | date = 2004 | url = http://www.lds.org/churchhistory/presidents/controllers/potcController.jsp?leader=3&amp;topic=facts | accessdate = 1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Mormon fundamentalists also regard the next three LDS Church presidents as leaders:
*[[Wilford Woodruff]] (1887–1898)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Wilford Woodruff, 4th President of the Church | work = History of the Church | publisher = The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints | date = 2004 | url = http://www.lds.org/churchhistory/presidents/controllers/potcController.jsp?leader=4&amp;topic=facts | accessdate = 1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Lorenzo Snow]] (1898–1901)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Lorenzo Snow, 5th President of the Church | work = History of the Church | publisher = The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints | date = 2004 | url = http://www.lds.org/churchhistory/presidents/controllers/potcController.jsp?leader=5&amp;topic=facts | accessdate = 1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Joseph F. Smith]] (1901–1918)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Joseph F. Smith, 6th President of the Church | work = History of the Church | publisher = The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints | date = 2004 | url = http://www.lds.org/churchhistory/presidents/controllers/potcController.jsp?leader=6&amp;topic=facts | accessdate = 1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major Mormon fundamentalist groups==
When [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] began excommunicating members who practiced polygamy after the [[Second Manifesto]], Mormon fundamentalists began breaking away from the LDS Church.

'''Mount Jizu''' ({{zh|t=雞足山|s=鸡足山|p=Jīzú Shān|l=Chicken-foot Mountain}}) is situated [[Dali Prefecture]], [[Yunnan Province]], [[China]].  The mountain is located to the northeast of [[Erhai]] and forms the tripoint of three counties: [[Heqing County|Heqing]], [[Binchuan County|Binchuan]], and [[Dali City]]. Mount Jizu is a famed holy mountain in Buddhism. Its main peak, Tianzhu Peak, rises some 3,240 metres above sea level. The mountain is vegetated with dense forests and bamboo groves. With three mountain ranges to the front and one range to the rear, it appears like a [[rooster|cock]]'s foot, hence its common name Mount Cock's Foot or Mt. Cock's Claw. Yet another name for this mountain is [[Nine Strata Cliffs]].

Haicheng Ling ''et al.'' (2005: p.&amp;nbsp;40) relate the experience of [[Xu Xiake]] (1586-1641):
&lt;blockquote&gt;"On the top of Tianzhu Peak, people can admire sun-rise in the east, sea of auspicious clouds in the south, the Cangshan Mountain and the Erhai Lake in the west, and the Yulong Snow Mountain in the north. Xu Xiake (1586-1641), a famous traveller and writer of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), marvelled that on the top of a single peak, people could see the "Four Scenes" - sun, lake, cloud and snow. "&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au"&gt;Haicheng Ling, Jun Liu, Tao Xie (2005). ''Buddhism in China''. Publisher: 五洲传播出版社. {{ISBN|978-7-5085-0840-5}}. Source: [https://books.google.com/books?id=1nZhePsh2U0C&amp;pg=PT47&amp;lpg=PT47&amp;dq=Mount+Jizu&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=q7o5w9Fnxb&amp;sig=9ufwjM1C9z31-zwbG8qAjj7Goro&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nsjGSp6CO8eIkQX1m_09&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Mount%20Jizu&amp;f=false] (accessed: Saturday October 3, 2009), p.40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The mountain is now not only a center of Zen, Pureland, and Tibetan Buddhism, but also a popular weekend getaway for Chinese tourists. A cablecar whisking visitors to the summit was installed above Tangyuan Street (汤圆街) in 2011.

==Nomenclature, orthography and etymology==
'Mount Jakang Chen' ({{bo|t=རི་བྱ་རྐང་ཅན|w=ri bya rkang can}}) (alternate names: Riwo Jakang, Mount Jizu, Jizu Shan, Jizushan Mountain)

Tan Chung (1998: p.&amp;nbsp;136) states that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Among the legends of Yunnan, there is one recorded in the ''Gazetteer of Yunnan Province'' compiled during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). A "Cock's Foot Hill" (''Jizushan'') at Binchuan County in the province was obviously christened after the Sanskrit Kukkatapadagiri - the name of the hill only 50 kilometres away from the bodhi tree under which Gautama Buddha attained enlightenment." {{citation needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Temples==
During the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, small nunneries were built, to be later expanded in the [[Tang dynasty]]. Most of the temple construction was during the [[Ming dynasty]] and [[Qing dynasty]]. Temples of note are the: [[Xitang Temple]], Shizhong Temple, Huayan Temple  and [[Jinding Temple]] (Golden Top) which had been relocated from Kunming. Later, many temples fell into ruins, and now, only [[Zhushengsi Temple]], the gate tower of [[Jinding Temple]] and [[Lengyan Pagoda]] are maintained.

As Haicheng Ling ''et al.'' (2005: p.&amp;nbsp;40) hold:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The first temple on Mount Jizu was built during the Tang dynasty (AD 618-907). Later, more temples were added in the Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties, covering a long period from 960 to 1911. In the reign of the Kangxi Emperor (1662-1722) of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), there were 42 big or small temples, 65 nunneries and more than 170 abodes for peace, with more than 5,000 monks and nuns. Existing temples on Mount Jizu are the Zunsheng Tower Temple, the Xitan Temple, the Zhusheng Temple, the Jiguang Temple, the Shizhong Temple and the Dajue Temple."&lt;ref name="books.google.com.au"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Zunsheng Tower Temple, [[Xitan Temple]], the [[Zhusheng Temple (Yunnan)|Zhusheng Temple]], the [[Jiguang Temple]], the [[Shizhong Temple]] and the [[Dajue Temple]].

==Buddhism==
Legend and folklore holds it that Mount Jizu was a bodhimandala of [[Mahakasyapa]], one of the foremost disciples of [[Shakyamuni]].

===Tantric Buddhism===
Monica Esposito (1993: vol2., p.&amp;nbsp;389-440; 1997: p.&amp;nbsp;67-123) mentions the 'Longmen' (lóngmén) Tantric branch of Mount Jizu a regional example of the tradition that yielded the [[Longmen Grottoes]].

The [[Upa-yoga]] tantra scriptures first appeared in 'Mount Jakang Chen' ({{bo|t=རི་བྱ་རྐང་ཅན|w=ri bya rkang can}}; alternate names: Riwo Jakang, Mount Jizu) and the charnel ground of 'Cool Grove'  ({{bo|t=བསིལ་བའི་ཚལ|w=bsil ba'i tshal}}).&lt;ref&gt;Tsogyal, Yeshe (composed); Nyang Ral Nyima Oser (revealed); Erik Pema Kunsang (translated); Marcia Binder Schmidt (edited) (1999). ''The Lotus-Born: The Life Story of Padmasambhava'' (Paperback). With forward by HH Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche. Shambhala: South Asia Editions, p.292&lt;/ref&gt; Cool Grove is also known as 'Śītavana' (Sanskrit).&lt;ref&gt;Rigpa Shedra (July 2009). 'Shitavana'. Source: [http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Shitavana] (accessed: October 3, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Yinxiang Temple 迎祥寺 (present day Zhusheng Temple [[:zh:祝圣寺]]) on Jizu mountains became the field of activity of the famous monk [[Xu Yun]] (? - 1959). The story was recently popularized in the TV-series 百年虚云 (PRC, 2009, cf. [[:zh:中国大陆电视剧列表 (2009年)]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5339">'''Organized religion''' (or '''organised religion'''—see [[American and British English spelling differences#-ise, -ize (-isation, -ization)|spelling differences]]), also known as '''institutional religion''', is [[religion]] in which [[belief system]]s and [[ritual]]s are systematically arranged and [[Formal organization|formally established]]. Organized religion is typically characterized by an official [[doctrine]] (or [[dogma]]), a [[hierarchical organization|hierarchical]] or [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] [[leadership]] structure, and a [[Religious law|codification]] of [[Religious behaviour|rules and practices]].  

==Definition==
Organized religion, or institutional religion, is [[religion]] in which [[belief system]]s and [[ritual]]s are systematically arranged and [[Formal organization|formally established]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Molnar, Darin R., PhD|title= Three Worldviews|date= 9 December 2010|url= http://www.middlewaymanagement.com/three-worldviews/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organized religion is typically characterized by an official [[doctrine]] (or [[dogma]]), a [[hierarchical organization|hierarchical]] or [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] [[leadership]] structure, and a [[Religious law|codification]] of [[Religious behaviour|rules and practices]].

Organized religion is distinguished from the broader idea of [[religion]] especially in [[anthropology]], [[sociology]] and [[philosophy]]. American philosopher [[William James]] states that &lt;blockquote&gt;Religion... shall mean for us the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude... in relation to whatever they may consider the divine. Since the relation may be either moral, physical, or ritual, it is evident that out of religion in the sense in which we take it, theologies, philosophies, and ecclesiastical organizations may secondarily grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= James, William|title= The Varieties of Religious Experience|chapter= Lecture II: Circumscription of the Topic|page= 31|publisher= Arc Manor LLC|year= 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; James further comments that the essential elements of "institutional religion" are "[[worship]] and [[sacrifice]], procedures for working on the dispositions of the deity [i.e.] [[theology]], and [[ceremony]] and [[Clergy|ecclesiastical organization]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= James, Williams|title= The Varieties of Religious Experience|chapter= Lecture II: Circumscription of the Topic|page= 30|publisher= Arc Manor LLC|year= 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organized religion seems to have gained prevalence since the [[Neolithic|Neolithic era]] with the rise of wide-scale [[civilization]] and [[History of agriculture|agriculture]].{{cn|date=August 2018}} Organized religions may include a [[state religion|state's official religion]], or [[state church]]. However, most political states have any number of organized religions practiced within their jurisdiction. Due to their structured, standardized, and easily proliferated form, organized religions comprise many of the world's [[major religious groups]].{{cn|date=June 2017}} The [[Abrahamic religion]]s are all largely considered organized (including [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]] and the [[Bahá'í Faith]]), as well as some schools of thought within [[Indian religion]]s (for example, some schools of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]).{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Religions that are not considered organized religions, or only loosely so, include many [[indigenous religion|indigenous]] and [[folk religion]]s, such as [[traditional African religion]]s, [[Native American religion]]s and [[prehistoric religion]]s, as well as personal religions including some strands of [[Hinduism]].{{cn|date=June 2017}}

==Modern views==
In the modern era, the definition of the term 'religion' is becoming increasingly opaque, making the task of defining 'organised religion' difficult. Anthropologists, theologians and scholars have thus attempt to embed the idea of an 'organisation' into the definition of religion itself. Some examples of this are found in the definition provided by Clifford Geertz, who defines religion as a "Cultural system."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=V86CXwAACAAJ&amp;dq=geertz+religion+as+a+cultural+system&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjn7Y_ukYXdAhUVdt4KHb6_AHQQ6AEIKTAA|title=Religion as a Cultural System|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|date=1966|publisher=Tavistock|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Max Weber's prominent definition of a religion includes the idea of a 'Church,' not necessarily in the Christian formulation, but insisting on the notion of an organised hierarchy constituting a palpable religious body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=abS61el-VEMC&amp;dq=Weber+definition+of+religion&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQvKSJkoXdAhUXfd4KHecABDsQ6AEILDAA|title=The Sociology of Religion|last=Weber|first=Max|date=1993|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=9780807042052|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it becomes apparent that 'organised religion' has also been considered as part of the definition of religion itself, which in the modern era has caused a degree of controversy with the prominence of aforementioned personalized faith systems.

'''Our Lady of Zeitoun''', also known simply as '''El-Zeitoun''', '''Zeitun''' or rarely '''Our Lady of Light''', was a mass [[Marian apparition]] that occurred in the [[Zeitoun, Cairo|Zeitoun]] district of [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], over a period of 2–3 years beginning on April 2, 1968.

==Apparition==
The first apparition at [[Zeitoun, Cairo|Zeitoun]] was recorded on the evening of April 2, 1968, when a [[Muslim]] bus mechanic named Farouk Mohammed Atwa, who worked across the street from St. Mary's Coptic Church in Zeitoun, thought he saw a woman attempting suicide by jumping from the structure. Two other men also noticed a white figure on the top of the church&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Carroll ''The cult of the Virgin Mary: psychological origins'', p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; A crowd gathered on the site and the police attempted to disperse it. According to the police, the sighting was just a reflection of the light from the street lamps.&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt; However, the crowds reportedly viewed the sighting as a clear apparition of the [[Virgin Mary]], and so, the attempts by the police to disperse the crowd were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt; The event itself ended after a few minutes.

One week later on April 9 the phenomenon reoccurred, again lasting for only a few minutes. After that time apparitions became more frequent, sometimes two-three times a week, for several years, ending in 1971.&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt; According to Coptic tradition, the site is one of the locations where the [[Holy family]] stayed during their flight into Egypt.

The head of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, [[Pope of Alexandria]], [[Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria|Kyrillos VI]] appointed a committee of high-ranking [[priest]]s and [[bishop]]s to investigate the matter, headed by Bishop Gregorios, bishop of postgraduate studies, Coptic culture and scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeitun-eg.org/zeitoun1.htm "The Apparitions Of The Blessed Holy Virgin Mary"]&lt;/ref&gt; On May 4 Kyrillos VI issued an official statement confirming the apparitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[Nun]]s of the [[Society of the Sacred Heart]] also witnessed the apparitions and sent a detailed report to the [[Roman Curia|Vatican]], resulting in the arrival of an envoy on April 28 who also saw the apparitions and sent a report to [[Pope Paul VI]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}. As the apparition appeared over a Coptic church, the Vatican left the investigation to the Coptic authorities. On May 5, 1968, Coptic Orthodox Pope Kyrillos VI approved the apparition.
 
The apparitions were also witnessed by President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thechristianreview.com/when-mary-returned-to-egypt-the-apparitions-at-zeitoun/ LaFave, Peter. "When Mary Returned to Egypt", ''The Christian Review'', 21 January 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; and captured by newspaper photographers and [[Egypt]]ian television. Investigations performed by the police could find no explanation for the phenomenon. No device was found within a radius of fifteen miles capable of projecting the image, while the sheer number of photographs from independent sources suggests that no photographic manipulation was involved. Having been unable to produce an alternative explanation for the luminous sightings, the Egyptian government accepted the apparitions as true.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeitun-eg.org/pg0016.htm  Johnston, Francis. ''When Millions Saw Mary''. Augustine Publishing Co., 1980] {{ISBN|0-85172-631-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Skeptical interpretation of the events==

Estimates of the number of observers of the event vary greatly. Thousands were said to have flocked to the Church after the first announced occurrences of the phenomenon. Some claim the apparitions were seen by millions. Other sources estimate the figure at around 250,000 in total. Cynthia Nelson was a professor of anthropology at AUC ([[American University in Cairo]]) and the founding director of the Institute of Gender and Women's Studies. She visited the church site on several occasions including April 15, 1968, another week later near the end of April and on June 1, 1968. Despite the accounts of ongoing, if irregular, visitations by the Marian apparition, Cynthia Nelson documents seeing nothing other than a few 'intermittent flashes of light'.&lt;ref&gt;''The Virgin of Zeitoun''. Worldview Magazine, Volume 16 No. 9 September 1973 [http://worldview.cceia.org/archive/worldview/1973/09/2208.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors suggest that the sightings must be considered in context. The appearances came at a period of crisis in Egyptian history and, echoed "a widespread feeling that the defeat of Egypt in the [[1967 Arab-Israeli war]] was the result of having abandoned faith in favor of human-made ideas and belief systems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | title=Unfulfilled Promises. | author=N Guenena and N Wassef | year=1999 | page=7 | url=http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/unfulfilled_promises.pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206190746/http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/unfulfilled_promises.pdf | archive-date=6 Dec 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologists Robert Bartholomew and [[Erich Goode]] offer the Zeitoun apparitions as a prominent case of [[mass hysteria]]: “It appears that the Marian observers were predisposed by religious background and social expectation to interpreting the light displays as related to the Virgin Mary.”&lt;ref&gt;Mass delusions, Highlights from the Past Millennium, Zeitoun, Egypt, 1968-1971 [http://www.skeptically.org/skepticism/id11.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Golden Jubilee==

On 12 May 2018, the Coptic Church celebrated the golden Jubilee of the event.,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youm7.com/story/2018/5/10/الكنيسة-تبدأ-اليوم-الاحتفال-باليوبيل-الذهبى-لظهور-العذراء-بكنيسة-الزيتون/3785989&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Tawadros II held the four Holy Mass.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youm7.com/story/2018/5/12/البابا-تواضروس-يترأس-صلوات-عشية-الاحتفال-بظهور-العذراء-فى-الزيتون/3789967&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of priests and Christians from all over Egypt attended the celebration, Sub-celebrations have been held from May 10 to May 13.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dostor.org/2166695&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.copts-united.com/Article.php?I=3358&amp;A=379068&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://dbonfrdgauzmg.cloudfront.net/news/details/1290150&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[theology]] and [[philosophy]], '''probabilism''' (from [[Latin]] ''probare'', to test, approve) is an ancient Greek doctrine (''πιθανισμός'') of [[academic skepticism]].&lt;ref name="runes2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Runes |first=Dagobert D. |authorlink=Dagobert D. Runes |year=2006 |title=The Dictionary of Philosophy |series=Kessinger Publishing's rare reprints |isbn=978-1-4286-1310-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5g0FOsGwUwC&amp;lpg=PA251&amp;pg=PA251 |page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; It holds that in the absence of certainty, [[probability]] is the best criterion. It can also refer to a 17th-century religious thesis about ethics, or a modern physical-philosophical thesis.

==Philosophy==
In [[ancient Greek philosophy]], probabilism referred to the doctrine which gives assistance in ordinary matters to one who is skeptical in respect of the possibility of real knowledge: it supposes that though knowledge is impossible, a man may rely on strong beliefs in practical affairs. This view was held by the [[Philosophical skepticism|skeptics]] of the [[New Academy]] (see [[Academic skepticism]] and [[Carneades]]).

Academic skeptics accept probabilism, while [[Pyrrhonian skepticism|Pyrrhonian skeptics]] do not.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In modern usage, a probabilist is someone who believes that central epistemological issues are best approached using probabilities.{{Clarify|date=May 2011}}  This thesis is neutral with respect to whether knowledge entails certainty or whether skepticism about knowledge is true.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Probabilist doctrines continue to be debated in the context of [[artificial general intelligence]], as a counterpoint to the use of [[non-monotonic logic]], as the proper form for [[knowledge representation]] remains unclear.

==Theology==
{{main|Catholic Probabilism}}

In [[Christian ethics|moral theology]], especially [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], it refers especially to the view in [[casuistry]] that in difficult matters of [[conscience]] one may safely follow a doctrine that is [[probability (moral theology)|probable]], for example is approved by a recognized [[Doctor of the Church]], even if the opposite opinion is more probable.

This view was advanced by the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[theologian]] [[Bartolomé de Medina]] (1527–1581) and defended by many [[Jesuits]] such as [[Luis de Molina|Luis Molina]] (1528–1581). It was heavily criticised by [[Blaise Pascal]] in his [[Lettres provinciales|''Provincial Letters'']] and by [[St. Alphonsus Ligourí]] in his ''Theologia Moralis'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ligourí|first1=Alphonsus, St.|title=Theologia Moralis|date=1852|location=Paris|pages=No. 12, 69.}}&lt;/ref&gt; as leading to moral laxity. Opposed to probabilism is [[probabiliorism]] (Latin ''probabilior'', "more likely"), which holds that when there is a preponderance of evidence on one side of a controversy one is obliged to follow that side, and [[tutiorism]] (Latin ''tutior'', "safer"), which holds that in case of doubt one must take the morally safer side. A more radical view, "minus probabilissimus", holds that an action is permissible if a single opinion allowing that action is available, even if the overwhelming weight of opinion proscribes it.

The doctrine became particularly popular at the start of the 17th century, as it could be used to support almost any position or council any advice.  By mid-century, such thinking, termed [[Laxism]], was recognized as scandalous.&lt;ref&gt;J. Franklin, ''The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-8018-7109-3}}, "The Scandal of Laxism" p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pushkaram''' is an Indian festival dedicated to worshiping of rivers. It is also known as ''Pushkaralu'' (in [[Telugu language|Telugu]]), ''Pushkara'' (in [[Kannada language|Kannada]]) or ''Pushkar''.

It is celebrated at shrines along the banks of 12 major sacred rivers in India, in the form of [[ancestor worship]], spiritual discourses, devotional music and cultural programmes. The celebration happens annually, once in 12 years along each river. Each river is associated with a zodiac sign, and the river for each year's festival is based on which sign Jupiter is in at the time. Due to regional variations, some of the zodiac signs are associated with multiple rivers.&lt;ref name="Roshen2014"&gt;{{cite book |author=Roshen Dalal |title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zrk0AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT921 |date=18 April 2014 |publisher=Penguin Books Limited |isbn=978-81-8475-277-9 |pages=921–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tradition ==

According to a legend mentioned in astrology treatises such as ''[[Jataka Parijata]]'' (1426), a Brahmin was granted a boon from [[Shiva]] after severe [[tapas (Sanskrit)|penance]]. The boon was that he would be able to live in water and purify the holy rivers. The Brahmin came to be known as ''Pushkara'' ("the one who nourishes"). On a request from [[Bṛhaspati]] (Jupiter), he decided to enter one of the 12 sacred rivers when Bṛhaspati traveled from one zodiac sign to another.&lt;ref name="Shrikala_2014"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=qNhiCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25 |title=Kamandalu: The Seven Sacred Rivers of Hinduism |year=2014 |author=Shrikala Warrier |publisher=Mayur |isbn=9780953567973 |pages=25–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The rivers ==

Each river is associated with a zodiac sign, and the river for each year's festival is based on which [[Hindu astrology#Rāśi – zodiacal signs|zodiac sign]] the planet [[Jupiter]] ([[Bṛhaspati]]) is in at that time.&lt;ref name="LDS1996"&gt;{{cite book |author=L.D.S. Pillai |title=Panchang and Horoscope |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vV1s4T8y8J8C&amp;pg=PA14 |date=1 December 1996 |publisher=Asian Educational Services |isbn=978-81-206-0258-8 |page=14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are periods when Jupiter is in [[apparent retrograde motion|retrograde motion]], resulting in entry into the same Zodiac sign twice in a year. On such occasions, the second entry of Jupiter is reckoned for celebrating the first part of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Pillai |first=L.D.S. |title=Panchang and Horoscope |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vV1s4T8y8J8C&amp;pg=PA14|date=1 December 1996 |publisher=Asian Educational Services |isbn=978-81-206-0258-8 |page=14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Pushkaram'' tradition is not mentioned in the early Hindu texts; it is part of the medieval Hindu astrological lore. Therefore, the names of 12 rivers may vary depending on the regional traditions. For example, in [[Maharashtra]], [[Bhima River|Bhima]] is associated with Scorpio sign, while in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Thamirabarani River|Tamraparni]] is associated with it. The sacred rivers include:&lt;ref name="Roshen2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shrikala_2014"/&gt;{{rp|32}}

== Celebrations ==

Pushkaram celebrations include reverence of ancestors, spiritual discourses, devotional music and cultural programmes. The devotees engage in activities such as ''snana'' (bath in the river), ''[[dāna]]'' (charity), ''japa'' (recitation of mantras), ''[[archana (Hinduism)|archana]]'' and ''[[dhyana in Hinduism|dhyana]]'' (meditation).&lt;ref name="Shrikala_2014"/&gt;

Theoretically, the festival lasts as long as Jupiter remains in the corresponding zodiac sign (generally, for one year). However, it draws major crowds only during the first 12 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/yw/2003/07/26/stories/2003072601020300.htm |title=Holy Dip |author=Ranee Kumar |newspaper=The Hindu |date=2003-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first 12 days when the Jupiter enters the zodiac sign and the last 12 days when it exits the zodiac sign are considered as most auspicious. A dip in the sacred river is believed to erase all sins.&lt;ref name="Shrikala_2014"/&gt; The first twelve days are known as ''Adi Pushkaram'', and the last twelve days are called ''Anthya Pushkaram''. It is believed that during the above period of twenty-four days, "Pushkar", imbued with the power to make any river holy, will travel with Jupiter as Jupiter moves from one Zodiac house to another. Planets that fall in the "Pushkara navamsa" or "Puskara bhaga" of a birthchart are considered to be very beneficial and auspicious in jyotish astrology. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In Telugu-speaking states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, Pushkaralu are celebrated for Godavari, Krishna, Tungabhadra, Pranahita and Bhima (near Bhima-Krishna Sangam) rivers. The major towns and cities to easily reach out by train and extensive bus services for pushkaralu in Telugu states are Godavari: Rajahmundry (Airport also), Bhadrachalam, Mancherial, Basara; Krishna: Vijayawada/Amaravati (Airport also), Nagarjuna Sagar, Srisailam, Beechupalli, Repalle; Tungabhadra: Mantralayam, Kurnool, Alampur; Pranahita: Kaleswaram-Sironcha (of Chattisgarh), Korisini, and Vemanpally; Bhima: Khalhalli. All these places can be reached by direct bus services from Hyderabad and all local district headquarters. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Pranahita-Pushkaram-from-today/articleshow/7049961.cms |title=Pranahita Pushkaram from today |date=2015-12-06 |newspaper=The Times of India }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Tamil Nadu, Pushkaram is celebrated in Tamraparni River when Jupiter is in Scorpio. In the four places where River Tamraparni flows from south to north, Banathirtham, Papanasam, Thirupudaimaruthur and Sinthupoondurai, the festival is celebrated in accordance with tradition. The Tamraparni temple at Suthamalli is also a place of religious celebration during the Pushkaram year.

The predominant '''religion in Kenya''' is [[Christianity]], which is adhered to by an estimated 84.8% of the total population. [[Islam]] is the second largest religion in [[Kenya]], practiced by about 9.7% of the total population. Other faiths practiced in [[Kenya]] are [[Baha'i]], [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[African Traditional Religion|traditional religions]].

==Christianity==
[[File:SANGUIS-Brvgensis MGR Zacchaeus Okoth.jpg|thumb|Mgr. [[Zacchaeus Okoth]]]]
Roman Catholicism was first brought to [[Kenya]] in the fifteenth century by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], and was spread rapidly during the 20th century by missionaries. Today, the main Christian denominations in Kenya are [[Protestant]] confessions, which make up about 47.4% of the country's religious composition.&lt;ref name="KNBS"&gt;Wycliffe Ambetsa Oparanya (31 August 2010) {{cite web |url=http://www.knbs.or.ke/docs/PresentationbyMinisterforPlanningrevised.pdf |title=2009 Population &amp; Housing Census Results |accessdate=2014-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810185221/http://www.knbs.or.ke/docs/PresentationbyMinisterforPlanningrevised.pdf |archivedate=10 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}.

The [[Roman Catholicism in Kenya|Roman Catholic Church]] represents 23.3% of the population.&lt;ref name="KNBS"/&gt;

The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] has over 650,000 members in Kenya (2010),&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.pewforum.org/2011/12/19/table-christian-population-in-numbers-by-country/ Table: Christian Population in Numbers by Country].''

Retrieved: 7 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; making it the largest Orthodox Church in Africa (after the Oriental Orthodox [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]]). In 2016 two new dioceses were created within the Orthodox Archdiocese of Kenya, namely the Diocese of Nyeri and Mount Kenya, as well as the Diocese of Kisumu and West Kenya, both falling under the Archdiocese of Nairobi, which is since 2001 presided by Archbishop [[Makarios (Tillyrides)]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.pravoslavie.ru/english/93387.htm ENTHRONEMENT OF BISHOPS IN KENYA - MAY 2016].''

Other statistically significant non-Catholic and non-Protestant movements include the [[New Apostolic Church]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[United Pentecostal Church International]], and [[Branhamism]]. The non-Protestant and non-Catholic groups make up about 11.8% of the population.

==Islam==
{{Main|Islam in Kenya}}
[[Islam]] is the religion of approximately 11.1% of the Kenyan population.&lt;ref name="KNBS"/&gt; Islamic organisations dispute the figures suggested. Some sources suggest the number of Muslims in Kenya between 35% and 45%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al-wayi.org/archive/60-292/558-musulmanskoye-bolshinstvo-v-afrike.html Al-wayi.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Most Muslims in Kenya are [[Sunni]], mostly of the [[Shafii]] rite. Approximately 7% percent identify themselves as [[Shia]] and about 4% identify themselves as [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi]] Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Religious_Affiliation/Muslim/the-worlds-muslims-full-report.pdf | title=The World's Muslims: Unity and Diversity | accessdate=April 2, 2014 | date=August 9, 2012 | publisher=Pew Forum on Religious &amp; Public life}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims are concentrated mainly in the [[Coast Province|Coastal]] and [[North Eastern Province (Kenya)|North Eastern Regions]]. [[Nairobi]] has several mosques and a notable Muslim population. There are large and historically significant populations of [[Swahili people|Swahili]] Muslims on the coast (most notably in [[Mombasa]], [[Lamu]] and [[Malindi]]), in the Western Province, and smaller numbers of [[Somali people|Somali]], [[Arab]] and [[South Asian]] Muslims.

Religious [[Shari'ah]] courts, called [[Kadhi courts]], are given jurisdiction over certain civil matters such as divorce and inheritance under the constitution of Kenya. Muslims have complained that they are targeted and discriminated against by the government, particularly since the [[1998 United States embassy bombings]] in Nairobi and elsewhere. The religions subsiding in Kenya do not display the distinctions between the 42 cultures. They mainly display the traditions of the larger "umbrella" cultures.

==Traditional African religions==
African religions are typically based on natural phenomena and reverence to ancestors. The dead are presumed to merely transform into another state of being and capable of bringing good fortune or calamity to the living. Most religious rites are therefore centred on appeasing the dead through sacrifices and proper burial rites. The dead's wishes must also be followed to the letter. 
 
Followers of traditional Kikuyu religion believe Ngai resides on [[Mt. Kenya]] and say their prayers facing the mountain. Followers of traditional Mijikenda religion have their holy shrines in the forests where they offer sacrifices and pray.

The [[Maasai people|Maasai]], [[Turkana people|Turkana]], [[Samburu people|Samburu]] and [[Pokot people|Pokot]] tribes also have significant numbers of persons adhering exclusively to traditional African religions.

==Hinduism==
{{Main|Hinduism in Kenya}}
[[File:EASS Temple Nairobi.jpg|thumb|[[Hindu temple]] in [[Nairobi]].]]

There are Hindus living in Kenya. The numbers are estimated to be around 0.14% of the population. They are mainly located in the capital of Kenya, Nairobi, and other urban areas such as Mombasa, Eldoret, Thika and Kisumu.

==No religion==

According to the ''[[Tattvartha Sutra|Tattvārtha-sūtra]]'',&amp;nbsp;all beings - save for infernal beings, one-sensed beings, or gods - possess one of three genders: female, male, or hermaphroditic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tattvārtha Sūtra: That Which Is|last=Acharya|first=Umāsvāti|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0300165296|location=New Haven, CT|pages=61|translator-last=Tatia|translator-first=Nathmal}}&lt;/ref&gt; These genders are produced by a specific "body-making karma" that is attached to the soul of an individual being. In the process of achieving spiritual liberation, this karma is shed in order to free the soul from the cycle of rebirths known as ''[[saṃsāra]].'' As such, all beings that have the potential to achieve spiritual liberation can do so, regardless of gender. This point, however, has been hotly debated amongst [[Śvētāmbara|Śvetāmbara]]&amp;nbsp;and [[Digambara]] Jains, so much so that a major sectarian difference between the two rests on the issues of female [[mendicant]]s and female salvation.

Jain literary traditions also reveal an ambiguous perception of non-males. Women are sometimes portrayed as virtuous mothers and learned teachers, while at other times, they, and other-gendered&amp;nbsp;beings, are seen as temptresses and evildoers.

Thus, despite the fact that Jainism offers an "almost unique insistence upon women [and others] as legitimate soteriological agents,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Escaping the World: Women Renouncers among Jains|last=Sethi|first=Manisha|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-1138662391|location=London, UK|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is a preponderance of characterizations, sources, and references that negatively influence the perception of women and other-gendered beings within the tradition.

== Debates on women ==
One of the most fundamental distinctions between Śvetāmbara&amp;nbsp;and Digambara Jains is their respective views on women as mendicants, or nuns, that originated over their debates regarding nudity. The general consensus between the two sects is that the [[Jinas]], and especially the last [[Tirthankara|Tīrthaṅkara]]&amp;nbsp;[[Mahavira|Mahāvīra]], practiced naked asceticism. Digambara Jains claims that it is necessary for all mendicants to conduct their renunciation without clothing. For them, this represents the idealized practice of ''[[aparigraha]],'' in which a mendicant renounces all property and possessions, including clothing. Śvetāmbara Jains, however, claim that nudity as the exemplary mode of asceticism is impossible in this period of the cosmic age, and as such, it is "deemed inappropriate."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collected Papers on Jaina Studies|last=Jaini|first=Padmanabh|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers|year=2000|isbn=978-8120816916|location=Delhi, India|pages=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Śvetāmbaras, the white robes commonly associated with them are interpreted as mere tools that enhance religious life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Jains|last=Dundas|first=Paul|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=978-0415266062|location=London, UK|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate on nudity would translate into a concern about the renunciant and soteriological potential of women. For Digambaras, women cannot become ascetics as they could not be naked, which was seen as "an essential component of the path to liberation."{{Sfn|Dundas|2002|p=56}} Women were also seen as essentially immoral - and therefore unsuited to become a mendicant - because their bodies "generate and destroy life-forms within their sexual organs... thus repeatedly infringing nonviolence."{{Sfn|Dundas|2002|p=57}} Women, then, were exempt from spiritual liberation because their bodies consistently broke the cardinal rule of ''[[Ahimsa|ahiṃsā]].'' The Śvetāmbaras accepted the premise that naked nuns would be inappropriate; however, because they viewed clothing as auxiliary to religious pursuits, the issue of female mendicants was resolved as they would be clothed. Additionally, Śvetāmbara Jains argued that women were not exempt from spiritual liberation, given that there is nothing within Jain scriptures that precludes such.

The debates haunt the discussion of gender, and particularly women, in Jainism, as the mendicant tradition is seen as one of the most significant features of Jain religious practice. Yet, it is important to note that simply because the "liberal" Śvetāmbaras do not preclude spiritual liberation for women, women are still viewed in various ways - both positively and negatively - as shown by the Jain literary tradition.{{Sfn|Sethi|2012|p=8}}

== Perception of women in Jainism ==
As Manisha Sethi observes, "[T]here is no single archetype but a heterogeneity of ideals that appear sometimes to buttress women's claim to independent spiritual life, and at other times, to erode this pursuit."{{Sfn|Sethi|2012|p=51}} Her point brings to bear the fact that the broader Jain literary tradition has stories that both inspire and demonize Jain nuns and laywomen. For example, there are goddess beings such as the ''[[Yakshini|yakṣī]]'' [[Padmavati (Jainism)|Padmāvatī]], who can intercede on behalf of "the non-salvational needs of their Jaina devotees, needs which cannot be met by the aloof, unresponsive, and totally-transcendent&amp;nbsp;Tīrthaṅkaras."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cort|first=John|date=December 1987|title=Medieval Jaina Goddess Traditions|jstor=3270086|journal=Numen|volume=34|pages=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;There are also stories about early Jain women whose chastity and righteousness eventually lead to their liberation, such as Rājīmatī, wife of the 22nd Tīrthaṅkara&amp;nbsp;[[Neminatha|Neminātha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jainpedia.org/themes/people/women-in-the-jain-tradition/rajimati.html|title=Rājīmatī|last=Kelting|first=M. Whitney|date=6 September 2014|website=Jainpedia: the Jain Universe online|archive-url=https://archive.today/20170530183403/http://www.jainpedia.org/themes/people/women-in-the-jain-tradition/rajimati.html|archive-date=30 May 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=30 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet at the same time, women - be they laywomen or nuns - are viewed as sexual agents with potentially nefarious goals. Indeed, while Jain monks are meant to control their sexual desires via their ascetic practices, the ''[[Sûtrakritânga Sûtra|Sūtṛakrtāṅga-sūtra]]&amp;nbsp;''details how "a woman will tempt [a monk] to a comfortable couch or bed" by seductive means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jaina Sutras: Part I &amp; II|last=Jacobi|first=Hermann|publisher=Forgotten Books|year=2008|isbn=978-1605067278|location=London, UK|pages=436}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are seen as cat-like predators who prevent Jain monks from achieving their lofty spiritual goals.{{Sfn|Sethi|2012|p=62}} Unlike their lay counterparts, references to Jain nuns within the texts about monastic conduct are notably absent. This lack of representation, argues Sethi, is an act of erasure: denying women equal opportunity in renunciate activities and leaves the Jain spiritual worldview solely within the domain of male practitioners.{{Sfn|Sethi|2012|p=64}} However, nuns are not exempt from being characterized as dangerous sexual agents, as a Jain nun needs to both protect her own chastity from "potential molesters and rapists ''as well as her own self''."{{Sfn|Sethi|2012|p=66}}

While representations of women as goddesses or chaste liberators within the literary tradition offers an alternative, and positive, vision of women within Jainism, at the same time, the negative depictions nonetheless "create[s] virulently misogynist cultural roles for women."{{Sfn|Sethi|2012|p=85}}

==  Mallī/Mallinātha ==
Among the numerous figures within Jain texts, an important discussion is to be had regarding the 19th Tīrthaṅkara&amp;nbsp;[[Māllīnātha|Mallinātha]], who represents a unique case study in the debates and figurations of Jain women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jainpedia.org/nc/themes/people/jina/malli.html|title=Malli|last=Balbir|first=Nalini|date=4 August 2013|website=Jainpedia: the Jain Universe online|archive-url=https://archive.today/20170530190238/http://www.jainpedia.org/nc/themes/people/jina/malli.html|archive-date=30 May 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=30 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Śvetāmbara&amp;nbsp;Jains, Mallinātha&amp;nbsp;represents the capacity of women to achieve spiritual liberation, given that Mallinātha is depicted as a woman known as Mallī Devi. Mallī was a king in her previous life known as Mahā-bala, who, along with his six friends, decided to become a mendicant after hearing an ascetic preach.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They all agreed to fast together, but Mahā-bala secretly desired to outperform his friends in their fasts. After they completed the life-ending fast known as ''[[Sallekhana|sallekhanā]],'' Mahā-bala's friends were reborn as gods and then kings; however, Mahā-bala was reborn as a woman because of his deceitful passion, which is considered to be a characteristic of women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thus, despite the fact that Mallī rises to the occasion of Tīrthaṅkara, her gender is still a karmic defect or failure unlike the case of male Tīrthaṅkaras. Digambara Jains review the view that Mallinātha was a woman, as this would mean that he would have developed breasts and menstruated; both of these signs are deemed as paradoxical and too worldly for an enlightened Jina, who is meant to have shed all his karmas. The exact gender of Mallinātha is more complicated than this, as all but one Śvetāmbara image - "The 'Meditating Female,'" which is a 10th – 11th century image from Uttar Pradesh, actually represents Mallī as an "asexual being with the absence of the diacritical marks of her sex."{{Sfn|Sethi|2012|p=82}} In terms of Mallinātha's presence in the lives of Jain nuns and laywomen, Sethi observes that very few view Mallinātha as a role model for women, and in the Śvetāmbaras' case, "her presence in the Tīrthaṅkara pantheon [was] 'an exception and a wonderment'... likely to be never repeated again."{{Sfn|Sethi|2012|p=57}}

== Roles of women in Jainism ==
According to the ''[[Kalpa Sūtra|Kalpa-sūtra]],'' after the death of the Tīrthaṅkara Mahāvīra, the community that he organized "contained a body of female ascetics two and half times as large as the number of male ascetics."{{Sfn|Dundas|2002|p=55}} Further, the respected Candanbālā, a Jain female renouncer during the time of Mahāvīra, is said to have led a [[sangha]] of 36,000 female ascetics.{{Sfn|Sethi|2012|p=54}} These annotations highlight the fact that, while there was lively discussion and debate regarding female mendicants, women have been a part of the Jain monastic tradition for a long time. This has continued even unto modern times, where Sethi observes that the number of female ascetics within Jainism is far greater than that of male ascetics.{{Sfn|Sethi|2012|p=4}} Arguably, given that Jainism offers the possibility of liberation to women, women are seen as "legitimate aspirants and agents of salvation," where in other traditions - such as Hinduism - they may not.{{Sfn|Sethi|2012|p=129}} Despite the propensity of female ascetics in Jainism, this does not ignore the fact that they may still find themselves within a hierarchical system wherein male ascetics are viewed more positively. This is to say, the Jain monastic hierarchy "is structured through the gendered ideology of domesticity, with the patriarchal authority, consolidated in the figure of the [[Acharya|ācārya]]/gacchādhipati, presiding over" the various mendicant orders.{{Sfn|Sethi|2012|p=48}} Thus, the highest rank of female monastics fails to have the same prestige or recognition as the highest rank of male monastics, the ācārya. Female ācāryas are a theoretical possibility, and two mendicant groups in the 1970s are known to be the exceptional cases where women have been given this status rank.{{Sfn|Sethi|2012|p=48}}

== Gender and the third sex ==
One of the consequences of debating whether or not women could be mendicants was an inquiry made by the Jains regarding who was a part of their larger community. To wit, the Jains accepted the pan-Indian idea of a third sex, who existed on the fringes of larger Indian society; however, given that the Jains were investigating whether or not women could become mendicants or attain spiritual liberation, they were simultaneously concerned about what it meant to be a man, woman, or neither/both.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=With Respect to Sex: Negotiating Hijra Identity in South India|last=Reddy|first=Gayatri|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0226707563|location=Chicago, IL|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jains rejected the Brahamanical&amp;nbsp;view of gender as indicated by "the presence or absence of certain primary and secondary characteristics"{{Sfn|Reddy|2005|p=19}} and instead, "revalorized" the term ''veda'', which referred to both biological sex and sexual feelings.{{Sfn|Zwilling|Sweet|p=113}} What became important to the Jains was less the features or markers of gender, but rather, sexual behavior itself as seen by one's role in intercourse.{{Sfn|Reddy|2005|p=20}} This sexual behavior can be focused toward men, women, or both, and it is exactly this bisexual quality of the third sex that was accepted by Śvetāmbara and Digambara Jains. However, the bisexuality of a third-sex sexuality became accepted not as a third-sex identity itself, but rather, a sexuality, that can be possessed by male, female, or third-sex gendered people. Thus, by the 5th century, the Jains distinguished what they viewed as biological sex and psychological gender and sexuality, which allowed the possibility of "a biological male (''dravyapuruṣa'') [that] need not necessarily be a male psychologically (''bhāvapuruṣa''), that is, endowed with male sexuality, but he may in fact experience female or third-sex sexuality, and the same will be true, mutatis mutandis, for the two other sexes as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zwilling|first=Leonard|last2=Sweet|first2=Michael|date=January 1996|title='Like a City Ablaze': The Third Sex and the Creation of Sexuality in Jain Religious Literature|jstor=4629615|journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality|volume=6|pages=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third-sex, known as ''napuṃsaka''s, were an important consideration because there was a social stigma attached to them. As Zwilling and Sweet explain, the fear was that the broader populace would assume things wrongly of Jain mendicants if the ''napuṃsaka''s were ordained as monks or even if mendicants accepted alms from them. Thus, another reason why it was important to determine who was a part of the third-sex was to enforce monastic conduct and public opinion. However, over time, this ban grew lax, especially if third-sex people were especially well-connected to local people or they were seen as being especially able to control their sexuality.{{Sfn|Zwilling|Sweet|p=378-379}}

'''The Sikh Gurdwara of San Francisco''' is a [[Sikh]] [[gurdwara]] in the Peninsula, just south of San Francisco in [[San Mateo, California]].&lt;ref name="sfsg"&gt;[http://www.sfgurdwara.org/ San Francisco Sikh Gurdwara], Gurdwara website, access date 04-14-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The Sikh Gurdwara of San Francisco was established in April 2012.&lt;ref name="sfsg"/&gt;

There is a monthly program held in San Mateo, just south of San Francisco. The Gurdwara is easy to get to and is centrally located at the corner of Highway 92 and Alameda de Las Pulgas - about equal distance from Highway 280 and Highway 101:

1700 Alameda De las Pulgas
&lt;br&gt;San Mateo, CA 94403

The Sikh Gurdwara of San Francisco location is a temporary location that is being used. Funds are being raised to find a permanent site which will be based somewhere in San Mateo County. This is the first Sikh Gurdwara that is easily reached without crossing the bridge from the San Francisco Peninsula to the East Bay or driving to the South Bay.

Sikhs and non-Sikhs are welcome to attend the Gurdwara.

'''Sitting Bull''' ({{lang-lkt|'''Tȟatȟáŋka Íyotake'''}} {{IPA-sio|tˣaˈtˣə̃ka ˈi.jɔtakɛ|}} in [[Lakota language#Orthography|Standard Lakota orthography]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idNLD|New Lakota Dictionary, 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt; also nicknamed ''Húŋkešni'' {{IPA-sio|ˈhʊ̃kɛʃni|}} or "Slow")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sitting Bull: His Life and Legacy|author=LaPointe, Ernie|publisher=Gibbs Smith|year=2009|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Hunkpapa]] [[Lakota people|Lakota]] leader who led his people during years of resistance to United States government policies. He was killed by [[Indian agency police]] on the [[Standing Rock Indian Reservation]] during an attempt to arrest him, at a time when authorities feared that he would join the [[Ghost Dance]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kehoe|first=Alice|title=The Ghost Dance|year=2006|publisher=Waveland Press, Inc.|location=Long Grove, IL|isbn=1577664531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[Battle of the Little Bighorn]], Sitting Bull had a vision in which he saw many soldiers, "as thick as grasshoppers," falling upside down into the Lakota camp, which his people took as a foreshadowing of a major victory in which a large number of soldiers would be killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reilly |first=Edward J. |date=2011 |title=Legends of American Indian Resistance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6DSHm09UebwC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=sitting+bull+vision&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjem8yhnorLAhWFOCYKHXKlChoQ6AEIRzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=sitting%20bull%20vision&amp;f=false |publisher=Greenwood |page=124 |isbn=978-0313352096}}&lt;/ref&gt; About three weeks later, the confederated Lakota tribes with the Northern Cheyenne defeated the [[7th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|7th Cavalry]] under Lt. Col. [[George Armstrong Custer]] on June 25, 1876, annihilating Custer's battalion and seeming to bear out Sitting Bull's prophetic vision.  Sitting Bull's leadership inspired his people to a major victory. In response, the US government sent thousands more soldiers to the area, forcing many of the Lakotas to surrender over the next year. But Sitting Bull refused to surrender, and in May 1877 he led his band north to [[Wood Mountain, Saskatchewan|Wood Mountain]], [[North-Western Territory]] (now [[Saskatchewan]]). He remained there until 1881, at which time he and most of his band returned to US territory and surrendered to U.S. forces.

After working as a performer with ''[[Buffalo Bill's Wild West]]'' show, Sitting Bull returned to the [[Standing Rock Agency]] in [[South Dakota]]. Because of fears that he would use his influence to support the [[Ghost Dance]] movement, [[Bureau of Indian Affairs|Indian Service]] agent [[James McLaughlin (Indian agent)|James McLaughlin]] at [[Fort Yates]] ordered his arrest. During an ensuing struggle between Sitting Bull's followers and the agency police, Sitting Bull was shot in the side and head by Standing Rock policemen Lieutenant Bull Head (''Tatankapah'', {{lang-lkt|Tȟatȟáŋka Pȟá}}) and Red Tomahawk (''Marcelus Chankpidutah'', {{lang-lkt|Čhaŋȟpí Dúta}}) after the police were fired upon by Sitting Bull's supporters. His body was taken to nearby [[Fort Yates]] for burial. In 1953, his [[Lakota people|Lakota]] family [[exhume]]d what were believed to be his remains, reburying them near [[Mobridge, South Dakota]], near his birthplace.

==Early life==
Sitting Bull was born on land later included in the [[Dakota Territory]].&lt;ref name= pbs &gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/people/s_z/sittingbull.htm|title=PBS: The West: Sitting Bull}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Utley |first=Robert |title=Sitting Bull: The Life and Times of an American Patriot|year=2008 |publisher=Holt Paperbacks|isbn=978-0805088304 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Sitting Bull's great-grandson asserted from family oral tradition that Sitting Bull was born along the [[Yellowstone River]], south of present-day [[Miles City, Montana]].&lt;ref name=birth&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/specialsections/heritage/200711-sittingbull.html?c=y&amp;page=3|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130419111153/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/specialsections/heritage/200711-sittingbull.html?c=y&amp;page=3|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-04-19|author=Blumberg, Jess|title=Sitting Bull's Legacy|publisher=''Smithsonian''|date=2007-10-31|accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named Jumping Badger at birth, and nicknamed Hunkesi, or "Slow," said to describe his careful and unhurried nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h3771.html United States History: Sitting Bull.]&lt;/ref&gt;  When the boy was fourteen years old he accompanied a group of [[Lakota people|Lakota]] warriors (which included his father and his uncle Four Horns) in a raiding party to take horses from a camp of [[Crow Nation|Crow]] warriors. Jumping Badger displayed bravery by riding forward and [[counting coup]] on one of the surprised Crow, which was witnessed by the other mounted Lakota.  Upon returning to camp his father gave a celebratory feast at which he conferred his own name upon his son.  The name, Tȟatȟáŋka Íyotake,  which in the [[Lakota language]] means "Buffalo Bull Who Sits Down", would later be abbreviated to "Sitting Bull".&lt;ref name= naming&gt;{{cite book|author=LaPointe, Ernie|title=Sitting Bull: His Life and Legacy|publisher= Gibbs Smith|year=2009|pages=26, 28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thereafter, Sitting Bull's father was known as Jumping Bull.  At this ceremony before the entire band, Sitting Bull's father presented his son with an eagle feather to wear in his hair, a warrior's horse, and a hardened buffalo hide shield to mark his son's passage into manhood as a Lakota warrior.&lt;ref name= naming/&gt;

During the [[Dakota War of 1862]], in which Sitting Bull's people were not involved,&lt;ref name= pbs /&gt; several bands of eastern [[Dakota people]] killed an estimated 300 to 800 settlers and soldiers in south-central [[Minnesota]] in response to poor treatment by the government and in an effort to drive the whites away. Despite being embroiled in the [[American Civil War]], the [[United States Army]] retaliated in 1863 and 1864, even against bands which had not been involved in the hostilities.&lt;ref name="NPS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/thro/historyculture/the-us-army-and-the-sioux.htm |title=The US Army and the Sioux |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864, two brigades of about 2200 soldiers under Brigadier General [[Alfred Sully]] [[Battle of Killdeer Mountain|attacked a village]]. The defenders were led by Sitting Bull, [[Gall (Native American leader)|Gall]] and [[Inkpaduta]].&lt;ref name="NPS"/&gt; The Lakota and Dakota were driven out, but skirmishing continued into August.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In September, Sitting Bull and about one hundred [[Hunkpapa Lakota]] encountered a small party near what is now [[Marmarth, North Dakota]]. They had been left behind by a [[wagon train]] commanded by Captain [[James L. Fisk]] to effect some repairs to an overturned wagon. When he led an attack, Sitting Bull was shot in the left hip by a soldier.&lt;ref name="NPS"/&gt; The bullet exited out through the small of his back, and the wound was not serious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sitting Bull, Champion of the Sioux: A Biography |last=Vestal |first=Stanley |year=1989 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |isbn=0-8061-2219-6 |page=63 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QvrzJJcUNsUC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=Sitting+Bull+1864#v=onepage&amp;q=Sitting%20Bull%201864&amp;f=false |accessdate=February 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Red Cloud's War==
From 1866 to 1868, [[Red Cloud]] as a leader of the [[Oglala Lakota]] fought against US forces, attacking their forts in an effort to keep control of the [[Powder River Country]] of Montana. In support of him, Sitting Bull led numerous war parties against [[Fort Berthold]], [[Fort Stevenson]], and [[Fort Buford]] and their environs from 1865 through 1868.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idUtley1993|Utley 1993]], pp. 66–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Sitting Bull also made [[guerrilla]] attacks on emigrant parties and smaller forts throughout the upper Missouri River region.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

By early 1868, the U.S. government desired a peaceful settlement to [[Red Cloud's War]]. It agreed to Red Cloud's demands that the US abandon forts [[Fort Phil Kearny|Phil Kearny]] and [[Fort C. F. Smith (Fort Smith, Montana)|C.F. Smith]]. Gall of the Hunkpapa (among other representatives of the Hunkpapa, [[Sihasapa|Blackfeet]], and [[Yankton Dakota]]) signed a form of the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]] on July 2, 1868 at [[Fort Rice]] (near [[Bismarck, North Dakota|Bismarck]], North Dakota).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idUtley1993|Utley 1993]], p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Sitting Bull did not agree to the treaty. He told the Jesuit missionary, Pierre Jean De Smet, who sought him out on behalf of the government:  "I wish all to know that I do not propose to sell any part of my country."&lt;ref&gt;Matteoni, Norman E.(2015) ''Prairie Man'', The Struggle between Sitting Bull and Indian Agent James McLaughlin, TwoDot. p. 41. {{ISBN|9781442244757}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his hit-and-run attacks on forts in the upper Missouri area throughout the late 1860s and early 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idUtley1993|Utley 1993]], p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The events of 1866–1868 mark a historically debated period of Sitting Bull's life. According to historian [[Stanley Vestal]], who conducted interviews with surviving Hunkpapa in 1930, Sitting Bull was made "Supreme Chief of the whole Sioux Nation" at this time. Later historians and [[ethnologist]]s have refuted this concept of authority, as the Lakota society was highly decentralized. Lakota bands and their elders made individual decisions, including whether to wage war.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idUtley1993|Utley 1993]], pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Great Sioux War of 1876==
{{details|Great Sioux War of 1876}}
[[File:Sitting Bull by Goff, 1881.png|thumb|Early [[Cabinet card]] of Sitting Bull, 1881.]]
Sitting Bull's band of Hunkpapa continued to attack migrating parties and forts in the late 1860s. When in 1871 the [[Northern Pacific Railway]] conducted a [[surveying|survey]] for a route across the northern plains directly through Hunkpapa lands, it encountered stiff Lakota resistance.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idUtley1973|Utley, ''Frontier Regulars'' 1973]], p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; The same railway people returned the following year accompanied by federal troops. Sitting Bull and the Hunkpapa attacked the survey party, which was forced to turn back.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idBailey1979|Bailey 1979]], pp. 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1873, the military accompaniment for the surveyors was increased again, but Sitting Bull's forces resisted the survey "most vigorously."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idUtley1973|Utley ''Frontier Regulars'' 1973]], p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Panic of 1873]] forced the Northern Pacific Railway's backers (such as [[Jay Cooke]]) into bankruptcy. This halted construction of the railroad through Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota territory.

After the 1848 finding of gold in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] and dramatic gains in new wealth from it, other men became interested in the potential for [[gold mining]] in the [[Black Hills]]. In 1874, Lt. Col. [[George Armstrong Custer]] led a military expedition from [[Fort Abraham Lincoln]] near [[Bismarck, North Dakota|Bismarck]], to explore the Black Hills for gold and to determine a suitable location for a military fort in the Hills.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idUtley1973|Utley ''Frontier Regulars'' 1973]], p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; Custer's announcement of gold in the Black Hills triggered the [[Black Hills Gold Rush]]. Tensions increased between the Lakota and whites seeking to move into the Black Hills.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idBailey1979|Bailey 1979]], pp. 106–07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Sitting Bull did not attack Custer's expedition in 1874, the US government was increasingly pressured by citizens to open the Black Hills to mining and settlement. Failing in an attempt to negotiate a purchase or lease of the Hills, the government in Washington had to find a way around the promise to protect the Sioux in their land, as specified in the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie.&lt;ref&gt;Matteoni, ''Prairie Man'', pp. 67–69.&lt;/ref&gt; It was alarmed at reports of Sioux depredations (encouraged by Sitting Bull). In November 1875, President Grant ordered all Sioux bands outside the [[Great Sioux Reservation]] to move onto the reservation, knowing full well that not all would comply. As of February 1, 1876, the [[Interior Department]] certified as "hostile" those bands who continued to live off the reservation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idUtley1973|Utley ''Frontier Regulars'' 1973]], p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; This certification allowed the military to pursue Sitting Bull and other Lakota bands as "hostiles".

Based on tribal oral histories, historian Margot Liberty theorizes many Lakota bands allied with the [[Cheyenne]] during the Plains Wars because they thought the other nation was under attack by the US. Given this connection, she suggests the major war should have been called "The Great Cheyenne War". Since 1860, the Northern Cheyenne had led several battles among the Plains Indians.

===Battle of the Little Bighorn===

{{details|Battle of the Little Bighorn}}
[[Image:little bighorn memorial overview with clouds.jpg|thumb|The area in which the Battle of the Little Bighorn took place.]]
During the period 1868–1876, Sitting Bull developed into the most important of Native American political leaders. After the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)]] and the creation of the Great Sioux Reservation, many traditional Sioux warriors, such as Red Cloud of the Oglala and [[Spotted Tail]] of the [[Brulé]], moved to reside permanently on the reservations. They were largely dependent for subsistence on the US Indian agencies. Many other chiefs, including members of Sitting Bull's Hunkpapa band such as Gall, at times lived temporarily at the agencies. They needed the supplies at a time when white encroachment and the depletion of buffalo herds reduced their resources and challenged Native American independence.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In 1875, the Northern Cheyenne, Hunkpapa, Oglala, Sans Arc, and Minneconjou camped together for a [[Sun Dance]], with both the Cheyenne [[medicine man]] White Bull or Ice and Sitting Bull in association. This ceremonial alliance preceded their fighting together in 1876.&lt;ref name="cheyenne"/&gt; Sitting Bull had a major revelation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the climactic moment, "Sitting Bull intoned, 'The Great Spirit has given our enemies to us. We are to destroy them. We do not know who they are. They may be soldiers.' Ice too observed, 'No one then knew who the enemy were&amp;nbsp;– of what tribe.'...They were soon to find out."(Utley 1992: 122–24)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sitting Bull's refusal to adopt any dependence on the US government meant that at times he and his small band of warriors lived isolated on the [[Great Plains|Plains]]. When Native Americans were threatened by the United States, numerous members from various Sioux bands and other tribes, such as the North Cheyenne, came to Sitting Bull's camp. His reputation for "strong medicine" developed as he continued to evade the European Americans.
[[Image:Sittingbullharpersweekly.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Sketch of Sitting Bull; ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', December 8, 1877 issue.]]
After the January 1st ultimatum of 1876, when the US Army began to track down as hostiles those Sioux and others living off the reservation, Native Americans gathered at Sitting Bull's camp. He took an active role in encouraging this "unity camp". He sent scouts to the reservations to recruit warriors, and told the Hunkpapa to share supplies with those Native Americans who joined them. An example of his generosity was Sitting Bull's taking care of [[Wooden Leg]]'s Northern Cheyenne tribe. They had been impoverished by Captain Reynold's March 17, 1876 attack and fled to Sitting Bull's camp for safety.&lt;ref name="cheyenne"/&gt;

Over the course of the first half of 1876, Sitting Bull's camp continually expanded, as natives joined him for safety in numbers. His leadership had attracted warriors and families, creating an extensive village estimated at more than 10,000 people. Lt. Col. Custer came across this large camp on June 25, 1876. Sitting Bull did not take a direct military role in the ensuing battle; instead he acted as a spiritual leader. A week prior to the attack, he had performed the Sun Dance, in which he fasted and sacrificed over 100 pieces of flesh from his arms.&lt;ref name= pbs /&gt;

Custer's 7th Cavalry advance party attacked Cheyenne and Lakota tribes at their camp on the Little Big Horn River (known as the Greasy Grass River to the Lakota) on June 25, 1876. The U.S. Army did not realize how large the camp was. More than 2,000 Native American warriors had left their reservations to follow Sitting Bull. Inspired by a vision of Sitting Bull's, in which he saw U.S. soldiers being killed as they entered the tribe's camp, the Cheyenne and Lakota fought back. Custer's badly outnumbered troops lost ground quickly and were forced to retreat. The tribes led a [[counter-attack]] against the soldiers on a nearby ridge, ultimately annihilating them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/How-the-Battle-of-Little-Bighorn-Was-Won.html|title=How the Battle of Little Bighorn Was Won |work=Smithsonian Magazine|author=Powers, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Native Americans' victory celebrations were short-lived. Public shock and outrage at Custer's death and defeat, and the government's knowledge about the remaining Sioux, led them to assign thousands more soldiers to the area. Over the next year, the new American military forces pursued the Lakota, forcing many of the Native Americans to surrender. Sitting Bull refused to surrender and in May 1877 led his band across the border into the [[North-Western Territory]], Canada. He remained in exile for four years near [[Wood Mountain Regional Park|Wood Mountain]], refusing a pardon and the chance to return.&lt;ref&gt;[http://woodmountain.ca/ Wood Mountain, Saskatchewan] official site.&lt;/ref&gt; When crossing the border into Canadian territory, Sitting Bull was met by the [[North-West Mounted Police|Mounties]] of the region. During this meeting, [[James Morrow Walsh]], commander of the North-West Mounted Police, explained to Sitting Bull that the Lakota were now on British soil and must obey British law. Walsh emphasized that he enforced the law equally and that every person in the territory had a right to justice. Walsh became an advocate for Sitting Bull and the two became good friends for the remainder of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Bobby Bridger, ''Buffalo Bill and Sitting Bull: Inventing the Wild West,'' (University of Texas Press, 2002), pp. 270–88&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Canada, Sitting Bull also met with  [[Crowfoot]], who was a leader of the [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfeet]], long-time powerful enemies of the Lakota and Cheyenne. Sitting Bull wished to make peace with the Blackfeet Nation and Crowfoot. As an advocate for peace himself, Crowfoot eagerly accepted the tobacco peace offering. Sitting Bull was so impressed by Crowfoot that he named one of his sons after him.&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey, H. A. (1972). ''Crowfoot, Chief of the Blackfeet,'' (1st ed.). Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, P. 91&lt;/ref&gt;
Sitting Bull and his people stayed in Canada for 4 years. Due to the smaller size of the buffalo herds in Canada, Sitting Bull and his men found it difficult to find enough food to feed his people, who were starving and exhausted. Sitting Bull's presence in the country led to increased tensions between the Canadian and the United States governments.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald A. Reis, ''Legends of the Wild West: Sitting Bull,'' (Infobase Publishing, 2010), pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt; Before Sitting Bull left Canada, he may have visited Walsh for a final time and left a ceremonial headdress as a memento.&lt;ref&gt;''Kensington, Museums Secrets: The Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto,'' (History TV, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunger and desperation eventually forced Sitting Bull, and 186 of his family and followers, to return to the United States and surrender on July 19, 1881. Sitting Bull had his young son [[Crow Foot]] surrender his [[Winchester Rifle|Winchester]] [[lever-action]] [[carbine]] to Major David H. Brotherton, commanding officer of [[Fort Buford]], Sitting Bull said to Major David H. Brotherton, "I wish it to be remembered that I was the last man of my tribe to surrender my rifle." To the Oglala Lakotas, Dakotas and Nakota, "to surrender my rifle" in this context meant "We have killed enough white men with your own rifles so I give this rifle back to you, for Tunkasila Wakantanka (Grandfather Great Mystery) will use a different way to help us overcome the white man." In the parlor of the Commanding Officer's Quarters in a ceremony the next day, he told the four soldiers, 20 warriors and other guests in the small room that he wished to regard the soldiers and the white race as friends but he wanted to know who would teach his son the new ways of the world. Two weeks later, after waiting in vain for other members of his tribe to follow him from Canada, the Army transferred Sitting Bull and his band to [[Fort Yates]], the military post located adjacent to the [[Standing Rock Agency]]. This reservation straddles the present-day boundary between North and South Dakota.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Sitting Bull and his band of 186 people were kept separate from the other [[Hunkpapa]] gathered at the agency. Army officials were concerned that he would stir up trouble among the recently surrendered northern bands. On August 26, 1881, he was visited by census taker William T. Selwyn, who counted twelve people in the Hunkpapa leader's immediate family. Forty-one families, totaling 195 people, were recorded in Sitting Bull's band.&lt;ref&gt;Ephriam D. Dickson III, [http://www.sdshspress.com/index.php?&amp;id=220&amp;action=912 ''The Sitting Bull Surrender Census: The Lakotas at Standing Rock Agency, 1881''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716025207/http://www.sdshspress.com/index.php?&amp;id=220&amp;action=912 |date=2011-07-16 }}, Pierre: South Dakota State Historical Society Press, 2010, pp. 23–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The military decided to transfer Sitting Bull and his band to [[Fort Randall]], to be held as prisoners of war. Loaded onto a [[steamboat]], the band of 172 people was sent down the [[Missouri River]] to Fort Randall (near present-day [[Pickstown, South Dakota]]) on the southern border of the state. There they spent the next 20 months. They were allowed to return north to the Standing Rock Agency in May 1883.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In 1883, rumors were reported that Sitting Bull had been baptized into the Catholic Church. [[James McLaughlin (Indian agent)|James McLaughlin]], Indian agent at Standing Rock Agency, dismissed these reports, saying that "The reported baptism of Sitting-Bull is erroneous. There is no immediate prospect of such ceremony so far as I am aware."&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker, ''A Complete Life of General Custer,'' Volume 2, p. 535.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1883/04/13/102936772.pdf |title=Sitting Bull becomes a Catholic |publisher=New York Times |date=1883-04-13 |accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'' Chicago Daily Tribune'', May 26, 1883, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meets Annie Oakley==

In 1884 show promoter [[Alvaren Allen]] asked Agent James McLaughlin to allow Sitting Bull to tour parts of Canada and the northern United States.   The show was called the "Sitting Bull Connection."  It was during this tour that Sitting Bull met [[Annie Oakley]] in Minnesota.&lt;ref name= SB-Oakley &gt;{{cite book|author1=Ernie Lapointe, Great-Grandson of Sitting Bull|title=Sitting Bull: His Life and Legacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w2VMQ5gQInkC&amp;pg=PT87|date=1 September 2009|publisher=Gibbs Smith|isbn=978-1-4236-1266-7|pages=87–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was so impressed with Oakley's skills with firearms that he offered $65 (equal to ${{Inflation|US|65|1884|fmt=c}} today) for a photographer to take a photo of the two together.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/biography/oakley-sitting-bull/ Biography: Sitting Bull] ''[[American Experience]]'' ([[PBS]])&lt;/ref&gt;  The admiration and respect was mutual.  Oakley stated that Sitting Bull made a "great pet" of her.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;  In observing Oakley, Sitting Bull's respect for the young [[sharpshooter]] grew.  Oakley was quite modest in her attire, deeply respectful of others, and had a remarkable stage persona despite being a woman who stood only five feet in height. Sitting Bull felt that she was "gifted" by supernatural means in order to shoot so accurately with both hands. As a result of his esteem, he symbolically "adopted" her as a daughter in 1884. He named her "Little Sure Shot" – a name that Oakley used throughout her career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dorchesterlibrary.org/library/aoakley.html "Annie Oakley"], Dorchester Library&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wild West Show==

In 1885, Sitting Bull was allowed to leave the reservation to go [[Wild Westing]] with [[Buffalo Bill|Buffalo Bill Cody's]] ''[[Buffalo Bill's Wild West]]''. He earned about $50 a week (equal to ${{Inflation|US|50|1885|fmt=c}} today) for riding once around the arena, where he was a popular attraction. Although it is rumored that he cursed his audiences in his native tongue during the show, the historian Utley contends that he did not.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idUtley1993|Utley 1993]], p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians have reported that Sitting Bull gave speeches about his desire for education for the young, and reconciling relations between the Sioux and whites.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idStandingBear|Standing Bear 1975]], p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Edward Lazarus wrote that Sitting Bull reportedly cursed his audience in Lakota in 1884, during an opening address celebrating the completion of the [[Northern Pacific Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idLazarus|Lazarus 1991]], p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sitting Bull stayed with the show for four months before returning home. During that time, audiences considered him a celebrity and romanticized him as a [[warrior]]. He earned a small fortune by charging for his autograph and picture, although he often gave his money away to the homeless and beggars.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idUtley1993|Utley 1993]], p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ghost Dance Movement ==

Sitting Bull returned to the Standing Rock Agency after working in ''Buffalo Bill's Wild West'' show.  Tension between Sitting Bull and Agent McLaughlin increased and each became more wary of the other over several issues including division and sale of parts of the Great Sioux Reservation.&lt;ref&gt;Matteoni, ''Prairie Man'', ch. 16 and 17.&lt;/ref&gt;
During that period, in 1889 Indian Rights Activist [[Caroline Weldon]] from Brooklyn, New York, a member of the National Indian Defense Association "NIDA", reached out to Sitting Bull, acting to be his voice, secretary, interpreter and advocate. She joined him, together with her young son Christy at his compound on the Grand River, sharing with him and his family home and hearth.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Pollack, Eileen. Woman Walking Ahead: In Search of Catherine Weldon and Sitting Bull. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
A Paiute Indian, named [[Wovoka]], spread a religious movement from Nevada eastward to the Plains in 1889 that preached a resurrection of the Native.  This was a time of severe conditions of harsh winters and long droughts impacting the Sioux Reservation.  It was known as the "Ghost Dance Movement", because it called on the Indians to dance and chant for the rising up of deceased relatives and return of the buffalo.  When the movement reached Standing Rock, Sitting Bull allowed the dancers to gather at his camp.  Although he did not appear to participate in the dancing, he was viewed as a key instigator.  Alarm spread to nearby white settlements as the Sioux added a new feature to the dance – shirts that were said to stop bullets.&lt;ref&gt;Matteoni, ''Prairie Man'', ch. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1890, [[James McLaughlin (Indian agent)|James McLaughlin]], the U.S. Indian Agent at [[Fort Yates]] on Standing Rock Agency, feared that the Lakota leader was about to flee the reservation with the [[Ghost dance|Ghost Dancers]], so he ordered the police to arrest him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Roger L. |last=Nichols |authorlink= |author2=University of Oklahoma  |title=American Indians in U.S. History |page=160 |url= |publisher=Norman Press |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 14, 1890, McLaughlin drafted a letter to Lt. Henry Bullhead (noted as Bull Head in lead), an Indian agency policeman, that included instructions and a plan to capture Sitting Bull. The plan called for the arrest to take place at dawn on December 15, and advised the use of a light spring wagon to facilitate removal before his followers could rally. Bullhead decided against using the wagon. He intended to have the police officers force Sitting Bull to mount a horse immediately after the arrest.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert M. |last=Utley |authorlink= |title=The Last Days of the Sioux Nation, 2nd Edition |pages=155, 157 |url= |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, Heather Cox.

The Struggle between Sitting Bull and Indian Agent James McLaughlin. Guilford CT: 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 5:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on December 15, 39 police officers and four volunteers approached Sitting Bull's house. They surrounded the house, knocked and entered. Lt. Bull Head told Sitting Bull that he was under arrest and led him outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert M. |last=Utley |authorlink= |title=The Last Days of the Sioux Nation, 2nd Edition |page=158 |url= |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sitting Bull and his wife noisily stalled for time, the camp awakened and men converged at the house. As Lt. Bullhead ordered Sitting Bull to mount a horse, he said the Indian Affairs agent needed to see the chief, and then he could return to his house. When Sitting Bull refused to comply, the police used force on him. The Sioux in the village were enraged. Catch-the-Bear, a Lakota, shouldered his rifle and shot Lt. Bullhead, who reacted by firing his revolver into the chest of Sitting Bull.&lt;ref name="utleylast"&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert M. |last=Utley |authorlink= |title=The Last Days of the Sioux Nation, 2nd Edition |page=160 |url= |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another police officer, Red Tomahawk, shot Sitting Bull in the head, and he dropped to the ground. He died between 12 and 1 p.m.&lt;ref name="utleylast"/&gt;

A close-quarters fight erupted, and within minutes several men were dead. The Lakota killed six policemen immediately and two more died shortly after the fight, including Lt. Bullhead. The police killed Sitting Bull and seven of his supporters at the site, along with two horses.&lt;ref&gt;Dippie, Brian W. ''The Vanishing American: White Attitudes and U.S. Indian Policy.'' Middleton, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sitting Bull's grave.jpg|thumb|Sitting Bull's grave at Fort Yates, ca. 1906]]
Sitting Bull's body was taken to [[Fort Yates]], where it was placed in a coffin (made by the Army carpenter)&lt;ref&gt;Snider, G.L., ''A Maker of Shavings, the Life of Edward Forte, Formerly 1st Sergeant, Troop "D", 7th Cavalry,'' 1936&lt;/ref&gt; and buried. A monument was installed to mark his burial site after his remains were reportedly taken to South Dakota.

In 1953 Lakota family members exhumed what they believed to be Sitting Bull's remains, transporting them for reinterment near [[Mobridge, South Dakota]], his birthplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Bones of Sitting Bull Go South From One Dakota to the Other. |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0D15F63E55107B93CBA9178FD85F478585F9 |quote=A group of South Dakotans today lifted the bones of Sitting Bull, famed Sioux Indian medicine man, from the North Dakota burial ground in which they had been buried sixty-three years and reburied them across the state line in South Dakota near the Chief's boyhood home. |publisher=[[Associated Press]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=April 9, 1953 |accessdate=2008-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Dan |last= Barry |authorlink= |title=Restoring Dignity to Sitting Bull, Wherever He Is |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/us/28thisland.html |quote=Then, in 1953, some Chamber of Commerce types from the small South Dakota city of Mobridge executed a startling plan.

Sitting Bull is a major character in [[Sharon Pollock]]'s play "Walsh" (1973), in which he is depicted as a wise and tragic figure during the Lakota nation's time at Fort Walsh in Saskatchewan.  The play is sympathetic to the character of Sitting Bull and hostile to the legend of George Armstrong Custer, re-presenting the General from the perspective of Native Americans as a butcher of women and children.

'''Somapura Mahavihara''' ({{lang-bn|সোমপুর মহাবিহার}} ''Shompur Môhabihar'') in Paharpur, [[Badalgachhi Upazila]], [[Naogaon District]], [[Bangladesh]] is among the best known [[Buddhist]] [[vihara]]s in the [[Indian Subcontinent]] and is one of the most important archaeological sites in the country. It was designated as a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] in 1985. It dates from a similar time period to the nearby [[Halud Vihara]] and to the [[Sitakot Vihara]] in [[Nawabganj Upazila, Dinajpur|Nawabganj Upazila]] of Dinajpur District.&lt;ref name=Banglapedia2&gt;{{cite book

== History ==

A number of monasteries grew up during the Pāla period in [[ancient India]] in the eastern regions of the [[Indian subcontinent]], comprising [[Bengal]] and [[Magadha]]. According to Tibetan sources, five great Mahaviharas stood out: [[Vikramashila]], the premier university of the era; [[Nalanda]], past its prime but still illustrious; Somapura Mahavihara; [[Odantapuri|Odantapurā]]; and [[Jaggadala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=English |first=Elizabeth |date=2002 |title=Vajrayogini: Her Visualization, Rituals, and Forms |publisher=[[Wisdom Publications]] |page=15 |isbn=0-86171-329-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monasteries formed a network; "all of them were under state supervision" and there existed "a system of co-ordination among them ... it seems from the evidence that the different seats of Buddhist learning that functioned in eastern India under the Pāla were regarded together as forming a network, an interlinked group of institutions," and it was common for great scholars to move easily from position to position among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dutt |first=Sukumar |date=1988 |orig-year=First published 1962 |title=Buddhist Monks and Monasteries of India: Their History and Their Contribution to Indian Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lxRHYFd0fB4C&amp;pg=PA352 |location=Delhi |publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] |pages=352–353 |isbn=978-81-208-0498-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xuanzang of China was a noted scholar who resided at the Somapura Mahavihara (the largest monastery in ancient India), and [[Atisa]] traveled from Bengal to Tibet to preach Buddhism. The earliest form of the Bengali language began to the emerge during the eighth century.

The excavation at Paharpur, and the finding of seals bearing the inscription ''Shri-Somapure-Shri-Dharmapaladeva-Mahavihariyarya-bhiksu-sangghasya'', has identified the Somapura Mahavihara as built by the second Pala king [[Dharmapala of Bengal|Dharmapala]] (''circa'' 781–821) of [[Pala Empire|Pāla Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="BangSoma"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chowdhury |first=AM |year=2012 |chapter=Somapura Mahavihara |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Somapura_Mahavihara |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] sources, including Tibetan translations of ''Dharmakayavidhi'' and ''Madhyamaka Ratnapradipa'', [[Taranatha]]'s history and ''Pag-Sam-Jon-Zang'', mention that Dharmapala's successor [[Devapala (Pala dynasty)|Devapala]] (''circa'' 810–850) built it after his conquest of [[Varendra]].&lt;ref name="BangSoma"/&gt; The Paharpur pillar inscription bears the mention of 5th regnal year of Devapala's successor [[Mahendrapala]] (''circa'' 850–854) along with the name of Bhiksu Ajayagarbha.&lt;ref name="BangSoma"/&gt; Taranatha's ''Pag Sam Jon Zang'' records that the monastery was repaired during the reign of [[Mahipala]] (''circa'' 995–1043 AD).&lt;ref name="BangSoma"/&gt;

The Nalanda inscription of Vipulashrimitra records that the monastery was destroyed by fire, which also killed Vipulashrimitra's ancestor Karunashrimitra, during a conquest by the [[Vanga Kingdom|Vanga]] army in the 11th century.

Over time Atisha's spiritual preceptor, Ratnakara Shanti, served as a [[Sthaviravada|sthavira]] of the vihara, Mahapanditacharya Bodhibhadra served as a resident monk, and other scholars spent part of their lives at the monastery, including Kalamahapada, Viryendra and Karunashrimitra.&lt;ref name="BangSoma"/&gt; Many Tibetan monks visited the Somapura between the 9th and 12th centuries.&lt;ref name="BangSoma"/&gt;

During the rule of the [[Sena dynasty]], known as ''Karnatadeshatagata Brahmaksatriya'', in the second half of the 12th century the vihara started to decline for the last time.&lt;ref name="BangSoma"/&gt; One scholar writes, "The ruins of the temple and monasteries at Pāhāpur do not bear any evident marks of large-scale destruction. The downfall of the establishment, by desertion or destruction, must have been sometime in the midst of the widespread unrest and displacement of population consequent on the Muslim invasion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dutt |first=Sukumar |date=1988 |orig-year=First published 1962 |title=Buddhist Monks and Monasteries of India: Their History and Their Contribution to Indian Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lxRHYFd0fB4C&amp;pg=PA376 |location=Delhi |publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] |page=376 |isbn=978-81-208-0498-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A copperplate dated to 159 Gupta Era (479 AD) discovered in 1927 in the northeast corner of the monastery, mentions donation of a Brahmin couple to Jain Acharya Guhanandi of [[Pancha-stupa Nikaya]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Asher |first=Frederick M. |title=The Art of Eastern India: 300 – 800 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d-gGxzx6wxIC&amp;pg=PA15 |date=1980 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |page=15 |isbn=978-1-4529-1225-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Vata Gohli, identifiable as the neighbouring village of Goalapara&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dutt |first=Sukumar |date=1988 |orig-year=First published 1962 |title=Buddhist Monks and Monasteries of India: Their History and Their Contribution to Indian Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lxRHYFd0fB4C&amp;pg=PA371 |location=Delhi |publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] |page=371 |isbn=978-81-208-0498-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
[[File:Somapura.JPG|thumb|300px|Site map]]

The quadrangular structure consists of 177 cells and a traditional Buddhist stupa in the centre. The rooms were used by the monks for accommodation and meditation. In addition to the large number of stupas and shrines of various sizes and shapes, terracotta plaques, stone sculptures, inscriptions, coins, ceramics etc. have been discovered.

The site houses the architectural remains of a vast Buddhist monastery, Somapura Mahavihara, covering {{convert|27|acre|ha}}. It was an important intellectual centre for [[Dharmic Traditions]] such as [[Buddhists]] (Buddha Dharma), [[Jainism|Jains]] (Jaina Dharma) and [[Hindus]] (Sanatana Dharma) alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Singh |first=Sheo Kumar |date=1982 |title=History and Philosophy of Buddhism |publisher=Associated Book Agency |location=Delhi |pages=44 |oclc=59043590}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 21 acre (85,000 m²) complex has 177 cells, [[vihara]]s, numerous stupas, temples and a number of other ancillary buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alam |first1=A.

In acreage, Somapura was the largest of the mahaviharas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dutt |first=Sukumar |date=1988 |orig-year=First published 1962 |title=Buddhist Monks and Monasteries of India: Their History and Their Contribution to Indian Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lxRHYFd0fB4C&amp;pg=PA375 |location=Delhi |publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] |pages=375 |isbn=978-81-208-0498-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its architecture was unusual. As one scholar described, the complex was dominated by a temple, which was not typical, and further, the temple had "none of the characteristic features of Indian temple architecture, but is strongly reminiscent of Buddhist temples of Burma, Java and Cambodia, reproducing the cruciform basement, terraced structure with inset chambers and gradually dwindling pyramid form ... during the age of the Palas some sort of intercourse between eastern India and south-east Asia existed ... but how this temple type, represented in India by this solitary example, became the standard of Buddhist temple architecture is not known."&lt;ref name="India 1962. pg 373"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dutt |first=Sukumar |date=1988 |orig-year=First published 1962 |title=Buddhist Monks and Monasteries of India: Their History and Their Contribution to Indian Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lxRHYFd0fB4C&amp;pg=PA373 |location=Delhi |publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] |pages=373 |isbn=978-81-208-0498-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another commented, "there can be no doubt that this style of architecture has most profoundly influenced that of Burma, Java and Cambodia. The nearest approximation to the plan and the superstructure of the Paharpur temple is afforded by the temples known as [[Prambanan#Roro Jonggrang complex|Chandi Loro Jongrang]] and [[Sewu|Chandi Sevu]] of [[Prambanan|Prambanam]] in Central Java."&lt;ref name="India 1962. pg 373"/&gt;

=== Central temple ===

The purpose of this central structure at the midst of the courtyard remains unsolved since its discovery. Hence, most of the debates generated hitherto on the architecture of Sompur Mahavihara are cantered on the identification its missing superstructure. The reason may be manifold, but the most important one is the non-availability of substantial amount of first-hand resource including a comprehensive architectural documentation at the disposal of the researchers. There are different arguments regarding the terminating top of the central structure of Sompur Mahavihara.{{such as?}}

Consequently, most of works done so far are mainly based on the findings of the archaeological excavation and studying the artefacts from the archaeological perspective. The first study on this monument with documentation was by archaeologist K.N. Dikhist in his ''Paharpur, Memoirs of Archaeological Survey in India'' (1938). Dikhsit was concerned with documentation of the archaeological findings and concentrated on their interpretation and analysis. He attempted to suggest a probable architectural treatment of the missing parts of the structure through studying the archaeological remains. Till today, this study is considered as the most authentic record of the Sompur Mahavihara.

Prudence R. Myer published the first of such studies in 1969 as a journal paper, in which he proposed the missing superstructure as a stupa and illustrated the possible three-dimensional articulations.&lt;ref name=AA1&gt;{{cite journal |last=Myer |first=Prudence R. |date=1961 |title=Stupas and Stupa-Shrines |journal=Artibus Asiae |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=25–34 |doi=10.2307/3249181 |jstor=3249181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myer embarked on his proposal through a diachronic study of the stupa and stupa shrines in India. He took Sompur Mahavihara as an example to elaborate his study and did a conjectural restoration of the central structure in support of his analysis.

The second work was published around thirty years after Myer's proposition. A team of architects&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Team members were Md Ali Naqi, Ziaul Islam, Md. Shoeb Bhuiyan and Catherine Daisy Gomes&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Khulna University]] led by Mohammed Ali Naqi has proposed another theoretical reconstruction of the central structure as well as some parts of the peripheral block (mainly the entrance hall) in 1999. This work was also presented in the "International Seminar on Elaboration of an Archaeological Research Strategy for Paharpur World Heritage Site and Its Environment" jointly organised by UNESCO and Department of Archaeology of Bangladesh in 2004. Muhammad Ali Naqi proposed a temple-like spire at the top by considering the central mound as a 'Stupa-Shrine' with a 'Shikhara' type stupa in his reconstruction.&lt;ref name=KUS&gt;{{citation |last1=Naqi |first1=Md.

Somapura was designated a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 1985. Since then, a series of [[UNESCO]] missions has regularly visited the site and helped with the project. Moreover, the UN body prepared a master plan, involving US$5.6&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/322 Ruins of the Buddhist Vihara at Paharpur], [[UNESCO]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unescodhaka"&gt;[http://www.unescodhaka.org/culture/ UNESCO Dhaka] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927104939/http://www.unescodhaka.org/culture/ |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106222/Somapura-Mahavira Article on Somapura Mahavihara], from [[Encyclopædia Britannica]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[terracotta]] artworks in the site have suffered from serious damage as a result of "lack of proper maintenance, shortage of manpower, fund constraint and heavy rainfall And the major problem is the corruption of [[Bangladesh]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bilu |first=Hasibur Rahman |date=25 April 2009 |title=World Heritage Site Left in Ruins |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=85541 |work=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, poor water drainage accompanied by high levels of salinity in the soils has contributed to decay the terracotta sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bilu |first=Hasibur Rahman |date=15 December 2007 |title=Salinity and Neglect Ruin Paharpur Terracotta |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/story.php?nid=15583 |work=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other threats include uncontrolled vegetation, vandalism, climate conditions, and public trespassing and encroachment.

[[Image:Oldspirithouses.jpg|thumb|Old spirit houses are often left by sacred trees or at [[wat]]s (Thailand)]]

A '''spirit house''' is a shrine to the [[Genius loci|protective spirit of a place]] that is found in the Southeast Asian countries of [[Burma]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and the [[Philippines]]. The spirit house is normally in the form of small roofed structure, and is mounted on a pillar or on a [[dais]]. They can range in size from small platforms to houses large enough for people to enter. Spirit houses are intended to provide a shelter for [[Genius loci|spirit]]s that could cause problems for the people if not appeased. The shrines often include images or carved statues of people and animals. [[Votive offering]]s are left at the house to [[Wiktionary:propitiate#Pronunciation|propitiate]] the spirits. More elaborate installations include an [[altar]] for this purpose.

In [[Indochina]],  most houses and businesses have a spirit house placed in an [[Wiktionary:auspicious#Adjective|auspicious]] spot, most often in a corner of the property. The location may be chosen after consultation with a [[Brahmin]] priest.   spirit houses are known as နတ်စင် နတ်ကွန်း in Burmerse; ศาลพระภูมิ (''san phra phum'', "house of the guardian spirit") in Thai; and ''rean tevoda'' ("place for the tevoda-spirit") or ''pteah phum'' in Khmer.
[[File:Balaua, the largest spirit house for anito among the Itneg people (1922, Philippines).jpg|thumb|Balaua, the largest spirit house for ''[[anito]]'' among the [[Itneg people]] (1922, Philippines)]]
In [[maritime Southeast Asia]], spirit houses are connected to the various traditional [[animist]]ic rituals involving spirits. In the Philippines, spirit houses are dedicated to ceremonies or offerings involving the ''[[anito]]'' spirits. They are known ''magdantang'' in Visayan; ''ulango'' or ''simbahan'' in Tagalog; ''tangpap'', ''pangkew'', or ''alalot'' (for various small roofed altars), and ''balaua'' or ''kalangan'' (for larger structures) in Itneg; ''maligai'' in Subanen; ''tenin'' in Teduray; and ''buis'' (for those built near roads and villages) and ''parabunnian'' (for those built near rice fields) in Bagobo.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Henry Scott  | authorlink = William Henry Scott (historian)   | url = https://archive.org/details/BarangaySixteenthCenturyPhilippineCultureAndSociety | title = Barangay: Sixteenth Century Philippine Culture and Society  | publisher = Ateneo de Manila University Press  | date = 1994  | location = Quezon City  | isbn = 9715501354 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kroeber"&gt;{{cite journal|author=A.

==Spirit house offerings==
In Thailand, it is a long-standing tradition to leave offerings of food and drink at the spirit house. Rice, bananas, coconuts, and desserts are common offerings. Most ubiquitous is red, strawberry-flavoured [[Fanta]]. The idea seems to be that friendly spirits will congregate to enjoy free food and drink and their presence will serve to keep more malign spirits at bay. The popularity of red Fanta offerings has existed for decades. Opinions as to "why Fanta?" vary. Most point to the significance of the colour red, reminiscent of animal sacrifice, or perhaps related to the practice of anchoring red incense sticks in a glass of water which promptly tints the water red. Sweetness is explained by the observation that sweet spirits naturally have sweet tooths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Winn |first1=Patrick |title=In Thailand, blood sacrifice is out.

{{Taoism}}
'''[[Taoism]]''' is a [[religion]] with many '''schools''' or '''denominations''', of which none occupies a position of [[orthodoxy]].&lt;ref&gt;Qing Xitai, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Taoist branches usually build their identity around a set of scriptures, that are manuals of ritual practices.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Reiter. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Scriptures are considered "breathwork", that is "configurations of energy" (''[[qi]]''), embodiments of "celestial patterns" (''tianwen''),&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Reiter. 2005. p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; or "revelations of structures" (''li'').&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Reiter. 2005. p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Taoist schools emerged during the late [[Han dynasty|Eastern Han dynasty]] (25-220 CE).&lt;ref&gt;Qing Xitai, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; They blossomed especially in the region of [[Shu Han|Shu]], modern-day [[Sichuan]].&lt;ref&gt;Qing Xitai, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 12th and 13th century onwards several smaller branches merged in larger ones, but in turn side-schools developed around the large traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Qing Xitai, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times the existing schools tend to be classified under few overarching headings, in most cases two: [[Quanzhen Taoism]] and [[Zhengyi Taoism]].

'''Tukar''' ([[Serer language|Serer]] : '''A Tukaar''',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gravrand|1990|p=474}}&lt;/ref&gt; other variations : ''Toukar'' or ''Toucar'') a large village in [[Senegal]]. Attached to the [[rural community]] of [[Ngayokhem]], it is located in the area of the pre-colonial [[Kingdom of Sine]], west of Senegal. The population is overrun by the [[Serer people|Serers]]. As of 2006 to 2007, the population was estimated at 3000.&lt;ref name="JMAS"&gt;{{harvp|Galvan|2007|pp=62-63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ndokh, which was a colony of Tukar, is now a separate village.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Galvan|Marcus|2003|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Galvan|2004|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{further|Lamane Jegan Joof}}
According to Serer tradition Tukar was founded by Lamane Jegan Joof (French spelling in Senegal: Lamane Djigan Diouf).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Galvan|Marcus|2003|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various versions of the tradition, but the basic story has a hero-migrant, Jegan Joof migrating from [[Lambaye Arrondissement|Lambaye]] looking for land to exploit. When he arrived at Tukar, it was nothing more than an inhospitable forest. In accordance with the complex [[land law]] system of the [[Serer people]], he was the one who cleared the fields and founded Tukar. His paternal descendants (the [[Joof family]]) reigned there for several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Galvan|2004|pp=108–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wis"&gt;{{harvp|Galvan|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Galvan|Marcus|2003|pp=151, 157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gravrand|1983|pp=166-169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, Biram Diouf (English spelling in the Gambia: Biram Joof{{#tag:ref|[[Joof]] is the English spelling in [[the Gambia]], a former British colony. [[Diouf]] is the French spelling in [[Senegal]], a former French colony. They are the same Serer ethnic group and pronounced the same way in the [[Serer language]]. Difference in spelling is due to colonization, with Britain taking Gambia and France taking Senegal. The demacation of these two countries was a result of colonisation. Their surname is spelled ''Juuf'' or ''Juf'' in [[Serer language]], see [[Joof family]].|group=Note}}), a descendant of Lamane Jegan Joof, was short of money and decided to [[Pledge (law)|pawn]] his family's [[Estate (land)|estate]] (a form of [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] known in the [[Serer language]] as ''taile'') to Waly Sene, the [[Jaraff]] of Tukar (representative of the local king). The Joof family of Tukar almost lost their ancestral land. It took 50 years for a great-grandson of Biram Diouf called Djignak Diouf to eventually repay the descendants of Waly Sene and reclaimed his family's estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Galvan|2004|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name Tukar consists of two Serer words: ''tuuk'' ("shut up") and ''kar-kar'' ("just kidding"). According to Serer oral tradition, an adventurer by the name of [[Fassamane Thiaw]] (or ''Chaw'') paid a visit to Lamane Jegan Joof during the [[harvest|harvest season]]. Lamane Jegan Joof was to have a very good harvest of [[millet]] that year and Fassamane Thiaw is reported to have exclaimed, "Ooh, you're going have quite bit of millet!" The [[Lamane]] was so surprised he immediately replied: "Tuuk!" - which means "shut up!" in Serer language. He then ordered Fassamane Thiaw to say "kar-kar" ("just kidding"). This is said to be the origin of the name Tukar.&lt;ref name="Galvan_2004_110"&gt;{{harvp|Galvan|2004|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historians, Lamane Jegan Joof had certainly been very shocked by the remark of Fassamane Thiaw about his promising harvest, but, above all, the bad spirits could be listening and decide to take revenge as a result of jealousy and introduce plague or locusts. This ancient superstition still prevails in [[Senegambia]]. The Serers and other ethnic groups of Senegambia forbid drawing attention to success or good fortune, because they fear that the bad spirits may become jealous and take revenge. If one mistakenly offers a compliment or comment on someone's good harvest, one is expected to quickly add ''kar-kar'' (just kidding), to ward off bad luck.&lt;ref name="wis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Galvan_2004_110"/&gt;

==Status==
The foundation of Tukar by Jegan Joof is occasionally taught to young children at the local school of Kane Faye. In the [[Serer religion|Serer religious]] calendar, the ''Raan festival'' is held in Tukar once a year on the second Thursday after the [[new moon]] in April.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Galvan|2004|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pangool]] of Tukar of is [[Lunguñ Joof]] (or ''Lunguñ Juuf'' in [[Serer language|Serer]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gravrand|1990|pp=169, 474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community life==
Founded in 1986, the Association of Peasants of Tukar (APT) (French: l'Association des Paysans de Tukar) is a rural association that promotes community cohesion and self-sufficiency.&lt;ref name="JMAS"/&gt; However in the mid-2000s, it had some difficulties and a new organization ''Bug Saax Of'' ([[Serer language|Serer]] for "those who love their town") was born.

'''Wenshu Guangfa Tianzun''' ({{zh|s=文殊广法天尊|p=Wénshū Guǎngfǎ Tiānzūn}}) is a character featured within the classic Chinese novel ''[[Investiture of the Gods]]'' (more commonly known as ''Fengshen Yanyi''). The figure apparently derives from the [[bodhisattva]] [[Manjusri]].

Guangfa Tianzun is the superiorman over Mount Five Dragons, Cloud Top Cave and the renowned teacher of [[Jinzha]], the first son of [[Li Jing (deity)|Li Jing]]. In rank, Guangfa Tianzun is seemingly an elite superiorman—even greater than that of [[Nezha]]'s teacher [[Taiyi Zhenren]].

After a fine duel had ensued between [[Muzha (deity)|Muzha]] and Nezha and Li Jing attempted his first suicide, Guangfa Tianzun would appear. Once Guangfa Tianzun had ordered Li Jing to enter his cave for safety, he would personally settle things with the "spoiled brat" Nezha. Once Nezha's temper raged and he thrust his spear continuously at Guangfa Tianzun, Guangfa Tianzun would side step and throw his legendary Seven Treasure Golden Lotus over Nezha's head. Nezha would lose consciousness quickly following this and would find himself tied to a large gold post while cuffed by golden rings. Soon enough, Guangfa Tianzun would order Jinzha, his student, to flog Nezha. Following the arrival of Nezha's teacher, Taiyi Zhenren, it would be revealed that the whole event between Li Jing and Nezha had been set by Taiyi Zhenren as a chance to teach Nezha some discipline. After Nezha greeted Guangfa Tianzun and his master - who was sitting to Guangfa Tianzun's right - Nezha would have a great level of inner resent.

Following the leave of Nezha and Li Jing upon Guangfa Tianzun's order, Guangfa Tianzun would not be seen again for quite some time.

'''Yiddishkeit''' ({{lang-yi|ייִדישקייט}} — '''''yidishkeyt''''' using the [[YIVO]] transliteration rules, '''''yidishkayt''''' in quasi-phonetic transcription)&lt;ref&gt;Competing ways of [[Phonetic transcription|transcription]] exist for the [[suffix]]: -keit, based on the orthography of Standard Modern [[German language|German]]; -keyt using the YIVO transliteration, and -kayt, a quasi-[[phonetic]] transcription used by a majority of [[linguist]]s and [[philologist]]s, particularly in the U.S., and favored by Uriel Weinreich in his ''College Yiddish''.&lt;/ref&gt; literally means "Jewishness", i.&amp;nbsp;e. "''a Jewish way of life''", in the Yiddish language. It can refer to [[Judaism]] or forms of [[Orthodox Judaism]] when used by religious or Orthodox Jews. In a more general sense it has come to mean the "Jewishness" or "Jewish essence" of [[Ashkenazi Jews]] in general and the traditional Yiddish-speaking Jews of Eastern and Central Europe in particular. 

From a more secular perspective it is associated with the [[popular culture]] or [[folk culture|folk]] practices of Yiddish-speaking Jews, such as popular religious traditions, Eastern European [[Jewish cuisine]], [[Jewish humor#Eastern European Jewish humor|Yiddish humour]], [[shtetl]] life, and [[klezmer]] music, among other things. 

Before the [[Haskalah]] and the [[Jewish emancipation]] in Europe, central to Yiddishkeit were [[Torah study]] and [[Talmud]]ical studies for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of [[Halakha|Jewish Law]] for men and women. Among [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] Jews of Eastern European descent, who compose the majority of Jews who still speak Yiddish in their everyday lives, the word has retained this meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yiddishkayt.org/ yiddishkayt.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

But with [[secularization]], Yiddishkeit has come to encompass not just traditional Jewish religious practice, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and retained their sense of "Jewishness". Yiddishkeit has been identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association, in culture and education. Another quality often associated with Yiddishkeit is an emotional attachment and identification with the Jewish people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ou.org/about/judaism/yz.htm#yiddishkeit ou.org:Yiddishkeit]&lt;/ref&gt; In these latter exceptions of the term, the most common Latinate spelling is ''yiddishkayt''.

{{Zoroastrianism}}
[[Homosexuality]] in [[Zoroastrianism]] is, as in many other religions, a controversial topic.

==Homosexuality in scripture==
The most sacred scripture of Zoroastrianism is called the [[Avesta]]. The oldest portion of the Avesta are the writings of [[Zarathustra]] himself and called the [[Gathas]].&lt;ref name=livius&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lendering|first1=Jona|title=Avesta|url=http://www.livius.org/au-az/avesta/avesta.html|website=livius.org|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionalist Zoroastrians argue that the Vendidad, one of the books of the Avesta, is an inherent part of Zoroastrian oral tradition even if it was compiled far later than other parts of the Avesta.&lt;ref name=ZoroTenents&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ervad Behramshah Hormusji Bharda|title=The Importance of Vendidad in the Zarathushti Religion|url=http://tenets.zoroastrianism.com/vndimp33.html|website=tenets.zoroastrianism.com|accessdate=3 January 2015|date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frashogard&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ervad Marzban Hathiram|title=Significance and Philosophy of the Vendidad|url=http://www.frashogard.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/the-vendidad-part-3.pdf|website=frashogard.com|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HI&gt;{{cite web|title=Ranghaya, Sixteenth Vendidad Nation &amp; Western Aryan Lands|url=http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/ranghaya/index.htm|website=heritageinstitute.com|publisher=Heritage Institute|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|The man that lies with mankind as man lies with womankind, or as woman lies with mankind, is a man that is a Daeva [demon]; this man is a worshipper of the Daevas, a male paramour of the Daevas&lt;ref name="Mercury Biography"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Lesley-Ann|title=Freddie Mercury: The Definitive Biography: The Definitive Biography|publisher=Hachette UK, 2011|isbn=9781444733709|page=28|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VJOPWGEUEZ4C&amp;pg=PT28|accessdate=3 January 2015|quote=In the sacred Zoroastrian text[,] the ''Vendidad'', it is stated: 'The man that lies with mankind as man lies with womankind, or as woman lies with mankind, is a man that is a Daeva (demon): this man is a worshipper of the Daevas, a male paramour of the Daevas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Sacred Books of the East"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Darmesteter|first1=James|title=Sacred Books of the East|date=1898|location=Vd 8:32|edition=American|url=http://www.avesta.org/vendidad/vd8sbe.htm|accessdate=3 January 2015|quote=Ahura Mazda answered: 'The man that lies with mankind as man lies with womankind, or as woman lies with mankind, is the man that is a Daeva; this one is the man that is a worshipper of the Daevas, that is a male paramour of the Daevas, that is a female paramour of the Daevas, that is a wife to the Daeva; this is the man that is as bad as a Daeva, that is in his whole being a Daeva; this is the man that is a Daeva before he dies, and becomes one of the unseen Daevas after death: so is he, whether he has lain with mankind as mankind, or as womankind. The guilty may be killed by any one, without an order from the Dastur (see § 74 n.), and by this execution an ordinary capital crime may be redeemed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This passage has been interpreted to mean that homosexuality is a form of demon worship, and thus sinful. Ancient commentary on this passage suggests that those engaging in [[sodomy]] could be killed without permission from the [[dastūr]], the high priest.&lt;ref name = "Sacred Books of the East" /&gt;

Zoroastrianism has been said to have a "hatred of male anal intercourse" that is reflected in at least one mythological tale. When [[Ahriman]], the "Spirit of Aridity and Death" and "Lord of Lies", sought to destroy the world, he engaged in self-sodomy. That caused an "explosion of evil power" and resulted in the birth of a host of evil minions.&lt;ref&gt;Long, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the Vendidad, the Pahlavi scriptures, later religious Persian books considered sacred by many Zoroastrians, also strongly forbid [[sodomy]].&lt;ref name=EI&gt;{{cite web|title=HOMOSEXUALITY i. IN ZOROASTRIANISM|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/homosexuality-i|website=iranicaonline.org|publisher=Encyclopaedia Iranica|accessdate=3 January 2015|date=15 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
