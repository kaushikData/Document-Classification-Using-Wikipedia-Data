'''Abel Seyler''' (23 August 1730, [[Liestal]] – 25 April 1800, [[Rellingen]]) was a Swiss-born theatre director and former [[merchant banking|merchant banker]], who was regarded as one of the great theatre principals of 18th century Europe. He was "the leading patron of German theatre" in his lifetime,&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Wilhelm Kosch, "Seyler, Abel", in ''[[Dictionary of German Biography]]'', eds. Walther Killy and Rudolf Vierhaus, Vol. 9, Walter de Gruyter, 2005, {{ISBN|3110966298}}, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; and is credited with introducing [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] to a German language audience, and with promoting the concept of a national theatre in the tradition of [[Ludvig Holberg]], the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' playwrights, and [[Opera in German|German opera]]. Already in his lifetime, he was described as "one of German art's most meritorious men."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Reichard | editor1-first=Heinrich Aug. Ottok. |year=1794 |title=Theater-Calender auf das Jahr 1794 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L8ZIAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA241 |location=Gotha |publisher= |page=241 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The son of a [[Canton of Basel|Basel]] [[Swiss Reformed Church|Reformed]] priest, Seyler moved to [[London]] and then to [[Hamburg]] as a young adult, and established himself as a merchant banker in the 1750s. During the [[Seven Years' War]] and its immediate aftermath his bank [[Seyler &amp; Tillemann]] engaged in an ever-increasing and complex speculation with [[financial instruments]] and went spectacularly bankrupt with enormous debts in the wake of the [[Amsterdam banking crisis of 1763]]. A flamboyant ''[[bon vivant]]'' who was regarded with suspicion in Hamburg, Seyler symbolized a new and more aggressive form of capitalism.

Seyler's admiration for the tragic actress [[Friederike Sophie Seyler|Sophie Hensel (Seyler)]], who later became his second wife, led him to devote himself entirely to theatre from 1767 onwards. He used his remaining funds to become the main shareholder, benefactor and effective leader of the [[Idealism|idealistic]] [[Hamburg National Theatre]], employing [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] as the world's first [[dramaturg]]. In 1769, he founded the travelling [[Seyler Theatre Company]], which became one of the most famous theatre companies of Europe during the period 1769–79 and regarded as "the best theatre company in Germany at that time."&lt;ref name="Keil"&gt;"Herzogin Anna Amalie von Weimar und ihr Theater," in Robert Keil (ed.), ''Goethe's Tagebuch aus den Jahren 1776–1782'', Veit, 1875, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; He initially held the Hanoverian privilege as theatre director and his company later stayed for three years at the court of [[Duchess Anna Amalia of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Duchess Anna Amalia]] in [[Weimar]] and for a year at the ducal court in [[Gotha]]. From 1779 to 1781 he was the founding artistic director of the [[Mannheim National Theatre]]. He commissioned works such as ''[[Sturm und Drang (play)|Sturm und Drang]]'' by [[Friedrich Maximilian Klinger|Klinger]] (which gave its name to the era), ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos (Benda)|Ariadne auf Naxos]]'' by [[Georg Anton Benda|Benda]] and ''[[Alceste (Schweitzer)|Alceste]]'' by [[Anton Schweitzer|Schweitzer]], considered "the first serious German opera."&lt;ref&gt;Francien Markx, ''E. T. A. Hoffmann, Cosmopolitanism, and the Struggle for German Opera'', p. 32, [[Brill Publishers|BRILL]], 2015, {{ISBN|9004309578}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seyler mostly focused on the artistic, economic and administrative management of his theatrical company; his own lack of a background as an actor, and his former profession as a banker, made him stand out among the theatre principals of his era.

==Background and childhood==
[[File:LiesthalBLI.jpg|thumb|upright|His birthplace [[Liestal]] in Switzerland (1780)]]
{{Main|Seyler family}}

Abel Seyler was born in 1730 in [[Liestal]] outside [[Basel]] in [[Switzerland]]. He was the son of the [[Swiss Reformed Church|Reformed]] clergyman, Dr.theol. Abel Seyler (Seiler) (the elder) (1684–1767), who was parish priest of Frenkendorf-Munzach in Liestal from 1714 to 1763, and Anna Katharina Burckhardt (1694–1773). He grew up in a learned and pious Reformed family and was descended on both his parents' sides from some of the most prominent patrician families of Basel. His mother belonged to the noted [[Burckhardt family]].&lt;ref&gt;Johann Jakob Brodbeck, ''Geschichte der Stadt Liestal'', A. Brodbeck, 1865&lt;/ref&gt; He was a paternal grandson of the theologian [[Friedrich Seyler]] and Elisabeth [[Socin]], a member of an Italian-origined noble family, and he was named for his great-grandfather, the Basel judge and envoy to the French court [[Abel Socin]] (1632–1695). On his mother's side he was also descended from the [[Merian family|Merian]] and [[Faesch]] families. He was also a [[matrilineality|matrilineal]] descendant of Justina Froben, daughter of the humanist [[Johann Froben]]. He had a sister, Elisabeth Seiler (1715–1798), married to parish priest Daniel Merian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stroux.org/regBLf/SerNf.pdf Auszug Stamm Seiler in / aus Liestal], 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He was distantly related to Cardinal [[Joseph Fesch]], [[Napoleon]]'s uncle; they were both descended from the Basel silk merchant, politician and diplomat [[Johann Rudolf Faesch]] (died 1659), who was Burgomaster of Basel and led the city's pro-French faction.

==Seyler as a merchant banker==
{{Main|Seyler &amp; Tillemann}}

[[File:Heinrich Carl Schimmelmann 1773.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Heinrich Carl von Schimmelmann]], Seyler's business associate who became a Danish statesman]]
As a young man, Seyler left Basel first for [[London]] and then for [[Hamburg]], where he was active as a [[merchant banking|merchant banker]] until 1766. With his business partners Johann Martin Tillemann and Edwin Müller, he founded the related companies [[Seyler &amp; Tillemann]] and Müller &amp; Seyler, which engaged in an ever-increasing and complex speculation with [[financial instrument]]s during the [[Seven Years' War]] in the 1750s and early 1760s. Seyler &amp; Tillemann had close ties to the bank of the brothers [[Leendert Pieter de Neufville|De Neufville]] in Amsterdam, and has been considered one of the most speculative and immoral banks of the era. In 1761 Seyler &amp; Tillemann, acting as agents for their close business associate [[Heinrich Carl von Schimmelmann]], leased the mint factory in Rethwisch from the impoverished [[Frederick Charles, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Plön]], a member of a cadet branch of the Danish royal family, to produce [[Debasement|debased]] coins in the final years of the Seven Years' War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schneider |first=Konrad |year=1983 |title= Zum Geldhandel in Hamburg während des Siebenjährigen Krieges |url= http://agora.sub.uni-hamburg.de/subhh/cntmng;jsessionid=6D96B820AFF85D36A0229C58668B925C.jvm1?type=pdf&amp;did=c1:6408 |journal= Zeitschrift des Vereins für Hamburgische Geschichte |publisher= |volume=69 |issue= |pages= 61–82 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seyler &amp; Tillemann went bankrupt in the wake of the [[Amsterdam banking crisis of 1763]] with 3–4 million [[Mark Banco]] in debts, an enormous sum.

[[Mary Lindemann]] notes, citing the memoirs of John Parish:
:When the Amsterdam house of [[Leendert Pieter de Neufville|De Neufville]] collapsed, so, too, tumbled Seyler &amp; Tillemann. The common cause of the bankruptcies, from the giant De Neufville to less-famed partnerships like Seyler &amp; Tillemann, lay, it was argued, in "an exaggerated trade in bills of exchange, in bill-jobbing, and—particularly—in the criminal "windy trade" that [such like] Seyler &amp; Tillemann had engaged in." The "wind trade" of these years—and the bankruptcies that resulted—shook the major commercial centers to the core, "and many a capitalist who sought to profit from the high discount rate and who changed his money into paper, was plucked bare."

Civil litigation relating to the bankruptcy was initiated in 1763, and the case reached the [[Reichskammergericht|Imperial Cameral Tribunal]] two years later. Much criticism was directed at Seyler and Tillemann's business ethics and extravagant lifestyle. Lindemann argues:

:[An] important case against several business partners reached the Imperial Cameral Tribunal (Reichskammergericht) in 1765. It offers an excellent perspective on "deceitful schemes" and especially on the bill-jobbing of two companies: Müller &amp; Seyler and Seyler &amp; Tillemann. Although the voices presented here are those of their creditors, the documents nonetheless reveal how contemporaries viewed the business practices of "malicious bankrupts" and how these practices assumed particularly baleful shapes in their minds. The creditors’ lawyers laid out the background to the case in considerable detail. Müller and Seyler were new men; Edwin Müller had come from Hanover several years before and Abel Seyler had been born in one of the Swiss cantons. Both had, however, "learned their business" and married in Hamburg.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Seyler had in fact married in Hanover, although he either already lived in Hamburg or settled there shortly afterwards&lt;/ref&gt; "If one could trust their books," their actual starting capital amounted to no more than thirty-eight thousand Mk. Bco., "of which, however, well over half had been frittered away through the acquisition of furniture for two households, [for the purchase of] clothes, jewels, silver plate, and other needs for themselves, their wives, and their children, [and also for] carriages, horses, and so on." Their business was undercapitalized from the beginning. In the 1750s, this seemed a minor problem because credit was easy to obtain. When the cash flow failed, they tried to acquire money quickly through bill-jobbing. Because their ready funds could not cover their expenses and debts, theirs became "the most audacious [form of] ''Windhandel''." As their business increased—as they took on ever more commissions in goods for import and export, invested in a sugar refinery, and lent money to several people—they simultaneously pursued their bill-jobbing and expanded it markedly. In 1757, they acquired a new partner, named Tillemann, who, however, contributed "not one Creutzer" to their capital, but that did not stop them from vigorously extending their business. Although their enterprises seemed to prosper in the late 1750s, they did so only "at the expense of others."&lt;ref name="Lindemann"&gt;[[Mary Lindemann]], "The Anxious Merchant, the Bold Speculator, and the Malicious Bankrupt: Doing Business in Eighteenth-Century Hamburg," in Margaret C. Jacob and Catherine Secretan (eds.), ''The Self-Perception of Early Modern Capitalists'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Seyler was described as "a handsome ''[[bon vivant]]''."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Prölss, ''Kurzgefasste Geschichte der deutschen Schauspielkunst: von den Anfängen bis 1850 nach den Ergebnissen der heutigen Forschung'', p. 194, F. A. Berger, 1900&lt;/ref&gt; Despite suffering "a sensational bankruptcy for an enormous sum [...] neither of them [Seyler and Tillemann] had lost his good humour or his taste for light living."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Mantzius, ''A History of Theatrical Art in Ancient and Modern Times: The great actors of the eighteenth century'', P. Smith, 1970, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Although they were wealthy bankers, Seyler and Tillemann were "in no way representatives of the Hamburg bourgeoisie, but were rather seen with suspicion for different reasons" by the local Hamburg elite.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Rüppel, ''"Nur zwei Jahre Theater, und alles ist zerrüttet": Bremer Theatergeschichte von den Anfängen bis zum Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts'', p. 127, C. Winter, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Seyler and his friends were self-made men, immigrants to Hamburg and showed little regard for the values and conventions of the conservative Hamburg bourgeoisie; they symbolized a new form of capitalism.&lt;ref name="Lindemann" /&gt;

==Seyler as a theatre principal==
===Hamburg National Theatre (1767–1769)===
{{Main|Hamburg National Theatre}}
[[File:Sophie Friederike Hensel.jpg|thumb|upright|His second wife [[Friederike Sophie Seyler]], Germany's most famous actress of the late 18th century, painted by [[Anton Graff]]]]
After the bankruptcy of his bank, Seyler devoted himself to theatre and became the main shareholder, benefactor and effective leader of the [[Hamburg National Theatre]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Felicia Hardison Londré]], ''The History of World Theater: From the English Restoration to the Present'', [[Continuum International Publishing Group]], 1999, p. 146, {{ISBN|0826411673}}&lt;/ref&gt; an idealistic attempt to establish a [[List of national theatres|national theatre]] based on the ideas of [[Ludvig Holberg]]. The theatre was owned by "a consortium of twelve businessmen of the city, with a triumvirate of Seyler, Bubbers and Johann Martin Tillemann, Seyler's business partner. But in practice, it was a one man affair, as Seyler dominated all."&lt;ref&gt;George Freedley, John A. Reeves, ''A history of the theatre'', p. 243, Crown Publishers, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; It leased the [[Comödienhaus]] building and was largely a successor institution of [[Konrad Ernst Ackermann]]'s theatre company. The National Theatre employed [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] as the world's first [[dramaturg]], and attracted eminent actors such as [[Konrad Ekhof]] and [[Friedrich Ludwig Schröder]]; Germany's most famous actress of the late 18th century [[Friederike Sophie Seyler|Friederike Sophie Hensel (Seyler)]], who later became Seyler's second wife, was the theatre's lead actress. She was regarded as "a very fine actress, as Lessing admitted, but she was a troublesome and tempestuous character," always at the centre of intrigue.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Sadie]] (ed.), ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', vol. 17, p. 209, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Mantzius]] noted:
:Seyler's admiration for the fine actress was easily transferred to the theatre in general, the theatre, that is, which formed a frame round his favourite. Thus a coalition of commerce, letters, and art was formed in which each party had his own personal interests, but which outwardly was working towards the sublime goal of abolishing the business-like leadership that was detrimental to true art.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Mantzius]], ''A History of Theatrical Art in Ancient and Modern Times: The great actors of the eighteenth century'', p. 112, P. Smith, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

Nominally the theatre was led by [[Johann Friedrich Löwen]], but he had little influence, as Seyler took all managerial decisions while Ekhof in practice assumed the artistic leadership. The new Seyler regime suited Ekhof well, and he became a lifelong friend and collaborator of Seyler.

The Hamburg National Theatre was immortalized by Lessing's influential book ''[[Hamburg Dramaturgy]]'', a collection of essays that reflected on the Hamburg National Theatre's efforts, and which defined the field of [[dramaturgy]] and gave it its name. The idea of a journal with Lessing as a dramatic critic was conceived by Löwen, and Seyler, "the power behind the throne," at first reluctantly agreed, but was eventually won over by the journal's success.&lt;ref&gt;George Freedley, John A. Reeves, ''A history of the theatre'', Crown Publishers, 1968, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/833404656|title=Gotthold Ephraim Lessing : his life, works, and thought|last=Nisbet|first=H.

===Seyler Theatre Company (1769–1779)===
[[File:Anton Graff 004.jpg|thumb|upright|Seyler's long-time collaborator, the actor [[Konrad Ekhof]], regarded as Germany's finest actor of the 18th century]]
{{Main|Seyler Theatre Company}}
In 1769 Seyler founded the National Theatre's effective successor, the [[Seyler Theatre Company]], together with Konrad Ekhof, Sophie Hensel and some other actors. The Seyler Company became one of the most famous theatre companies of Europe during the period 1769–79 and was regarded as "the best theatre company in Germany at that time."&lt;ref name="Keil" /&gt; While the National Theatre had avoided musical theatre, Seyler appointed [[Anton Schweitzer]] as music director, charged with adding [[opera]] to the spoken repertory, and the Seyler Company came to play a major role both in the development of a German opera tradition and in the promotion and popularisation of the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' dramas.

For most of its existence, the Seyler Company comprised around 60 members, and included an orchestra, a ballet, house dramatists and set designers. Over the next ten years the company travelled extensively, and stayed for longer periods at several courts of Europe. Theatre companies of the era, especially travelling ones, thought of themselves as extended "families."

====Hanover years (1769–1771)====
[[George III of the United Kingdom|George III of Hanover and the United Kingdom]] contracted Seyler in 1769 with performing at Hanover and other cities of the [[Electorate of Hanover]], appointing him as "Director of the Royal and Electoral German Court Actors," a privilege he held until relinquishing it in 1772. During the Hanover years the company performed in Hanover itself and in [[Lüneburg]], [[Celle]], [[Osnabrück]], [[Hildesheim]] und [[Wetzlar]]. Initially the new company struggled and Seyler failed to replicate the old success of the Hamburg National Theatre. The lack of public interest in Hanover led to financial problems and when Ekhof in May 1770 also became seriously ill and unable to perform for some time, the situation worsened dramatically. Seyler's brother-in-law, the court pharmacist [[Johann Gerhard Reinhard Andreae|J.G.R. Andreae]] from Hanover, who also raised Seyler's children from his first marriage, saved the Seyler Company by the assumption of all debts before the impending ruin; Andreae however demanded that Ekhof replaced his brother-in-law as head of the company.

====At the court of Duchess Anna Amalia (1771–1774)====
[[File:Weimar Anna Amalia Bibliothek@Anna Amalie von Sachsen-Weimar (1).JPG|thumb|upright|[[Duchess Anna Amalia of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Duchess Anna Amalia]], noted patron of the arts, who invited Seyler and his company to her court in 1771]]
In 1771 the Seyler Company was invited to the ducal court in [[Weimar]] by [[Duchess Anna Amalia of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Duchess Anna Amalia]], the composer and noted patron of the arts, and Seyler again became the company's principal. They were warmly welcomed by Anna Amalia and her court, and were generously paid; the company performed three times a week for select guests at the Weimar ducal court. In 1771 Anna Amalia was a 32-year old widow who reigned as regent on behalf of her young son. The Seyler Company's arrival in Weimar coincided with the infancy of the cultural era known as the [[Weimar Classicism]], when the Duchess invited many of the most eminent men in Germany to her court in Weimar, including [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]].

Adam Shoaff notes,
:While in Weimar, the Seyler troupe established a reputation as one of the most formidable companies in Germany, thanks to its composer, [[Anton Schweitzer]] (1735–87); their leading soprano, [[Franziska Romana Koch|Franziska Koch]]; [...] and two other talented singers, Josepha and Friedrich Hellmuth. Its production of Schweitzer’s ''[[Alceste (Schweitzer)|Alceste]]'' (1773), with a libretto by [[Christoph Martin Wieland]] (1733–1813), marked a significant moment in German opera history: ''Alceste'' was the first full-length serious opera in German.&lt;ref&gt;Shoaff, Adam (2016), "Opera in Leipzig: From Strungk to Seyler," in ''The Aesthetic Foundations of German Opera in Leipzig, 1766–1775'', pp. 15–33, PhD dissertation in Musicology, University of Cincinnati&lt;/ref&gt;

====At the Gotha court (1774–1775)====
After the palace fire in Weimar in May 1774, Anna Amalia was forced to dismiss the Seyler Company, and they left with a quarter year's wages and a letter of recommendation to [[Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg|Duke Ernest II]] in [[Gotha]]. Seyler thus missed [[Goethe]]'s arrival at the Weimar court a year later. The Seyler Company remained for one year at the ducal court in Gotha, where Seyler and other of the troupe's members also involved themselves in the broader cultural and social life, and in freemasonry. In Gotha Seyler met the Bohemian composer [[Georg Anton Benda]] and commissioned him to write several successful operas, including ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos (Benda)|Ariadne auf Naxos]]'', ''Medea'' and ''Pygmalion''. At its debut in 1775, ''Ariadne auf Naxos'' received enthusiastic reviews in Germany and afterwards, in the whole of Europe, with music critics calling attention to its originality, sweetness, and ingenious execution. It is widely considered Benda's best work, and inspired [[Mozart]].

In 1775 Seyler received the [[Electorate of Saxony|Electoral Saxon]] privilege as theatre director and performed in [[Leipzig]] and [[Dresden]], and in 1776 he opened a newly built summer theatre in Dresden. In 1776 Seyler also employed Goethe's close friend [[Friedrich Maximilian Klinger]] as a playwright and secretary, and he remained with the company for two years. Klinger had followed Goethe to Weimar earlier in the same year, and at the time he joined the Seyler Company he had just broken with Goethe under unclear circumstances. He brought with him the manuscript of his recently finished play ''[[Sturm und Drang (play)|Sturm und Drang]]'', which was first performed by the Seyler Company on 1 April 1777 in Leipzig; the play gave its name to the artistic movement ''[[Sturm und Drang]]''.

====On the road again (1777–1779)====
In 1777 Seyler relinguished the Electoral Saxon privilege and his company took to the road again. Over the next two years the Seyler Company was primarily based in [[Frankfurt]] and [[Mainz]] and travelled extensively to [[Cologne]], [[Hanau]], [[Mannheim]], [[Heidelberg]] and [[Bonn]].

===Mannheim National Theatre (1779–1781)===
[[File:Wolfgang-Heribert-von-Dalberg.jpg|thumb|upright|The courtier [[Wolfgang Heribert von Dalberg]], Seyler's collaborator during the Mannheim years]]
When [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria|Charles Theodore]], the Prince-Elector of the [[Electoral Palatinate]], additionally became the Duke of Bavaria in 1777, he moved his court from the Palatine capital of [[Mannheim]] to [[Munich]] and brought the theatre company of [[Theobald Marchand]] with him. In 1778 he instructed the courtier [[Wolfgang Heribert von Dalberg]]—the brother of Prince-Elector and Grand Duke [[Karl Theodor von Dalberg]]—to establish a new theatre in Mannheim. At first Dalberg contracted Abel Seyler's theatre company with performing in Mannheim on an occasional basis from 1778 to 1779. In the autumn of 1779 Seyler moved permanently to Mannheim with the remaining members of his theatre company. Several actors who had been affiliated with the Gotha Court Theatre under Konrad Ekhof's direction in the past few years—essentially an offshoot of the Seyler Theatre Company—also joined him; Ekhof himself had died the previous year. The [[Mannheim National Theatre]] opened in October 1779 with Seyler as its first artistic director&lt;ref group="note"&gt;His formal title was ''Direktor'', but he was also referred to as ''Regisseur''&lt;/ref&gt; and Dalberg as its general administrator.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''Intendant''&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the actors who worked under Seyler's direction at Mannheim were [[August Wilhelm Iffland]], [[Johann David Beil]] and [[Heinrich Beck (actor)|Heinrich Beck]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6vsQAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA296 Jahrbuch der deutschen Shakespeare-Gesellschaft]'', vol. 9 (1874), pp. 296–297&lt;/ref&gt;

At Mannheim Seyler directed several [[Shakespeare]] productions, and left a lasting legacy. His "repertoire in the early Mannheim years still shows the influence of his Hamburg period as well as the legacy of the Weimar/Gotha years."&lt;ref&gt;Lesley Sharpe, ''A National Repertoire: Schiller, Iffland and the German Stage'', p. 50ff, Peter Lang, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In cooperation with Dalberg he developed the theatre's characteristic style, based on a belief in the need to achieve a balance between a more natural style of playing and a certain nobility and idealisation.&lt;ref&gt;''Schiller: A Birmingham Symposium'', p. 37, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

He was forced to leave his position as director of the Mannheim theatre in 1781, "after his wife's jealousy had provoked an unfortunate incident;"&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Sadie]] (ed.), ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', vol. 17, p. 209, Macmillan, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; the usually level-headed Seyler had become embroiled in a quarrel with his wife's "scheming"&lt;ref&gt;Alfried Wieczorek, Hansjörg Probst, Wieland Koenig, ''Lebenslust und Frömmigkeit'', p. 407, Verlag Friedrich Pustet, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; student [[Elisabeth Toscani]] over her unauthorised presence during theatre rehearsals and disrespectful remarks, and Dalberg retired Seyler with a pension to "restore the peace."&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Koffka, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=kZ-UdtbWaK4C&amp;pg=PA538 Der Seyler-Toscani'sche Streit (1781)]," in ''Iffland und Dalberg: Geschichte der classischen Theaterzeit Mannheims'', p. 538ff, Weber 1865&lt;/ref&gt;

The first performance of [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s ''[[The Robbers]]''—itself inspired by the play ''[[Julius of Tarent]]'' by Seyler's son-in-law [[Johann Anton Leisewitz]]—took place at the Mannheim National Theatre the year after Seyler left as director.

===Final years (1781–1800)===
[[File:Hüon und Amande by Sophie Seyler.png|thumb|upright|His wife Sophie Seyler's opera ''[[Oberon (Seyler)|Huon and Amanda]]'' (or ''Oberon''), a primary influence on the plot and characters of ''[[The Magic Flute]]'']]

From 1781 to 1783 Seyler was artistic director of the Schleswig Court Theatre, which also performed in [[Flensburg]], [[Husum]] and [[Kiel]]. In 1783 he established his own troupe based in [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] near Hamburg. From 1783 to 1784 he was again in charge of the Comödienhaus in Hamburg; he continued to live in Hamburg until 1787 and was at times a [[Prompter (theatre)|prompter]] at the theatre, where his wife performed. From 1787 to 1792 he was again artistic director of the Schleswig Court Theatre.

His wife Sophie Seyler died in 1789. Earlier in that year she had published the opera ''[[Oberon (Seyler)|Huon and Amanda]]'' (or ''Oberon''), based on [[Oberon (poem)|a poem]] by their friend and collaborator [[Christoph Martin Wieland]]. A lightly adapted version of Seyler's opera&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Branscombe]], ''W. A. Mozart: Die Zauberflöte'', Cambridge University Press, 1991, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; set to music by [[Paul Wranitzky]] became the first opera performed by [[Emanuel Schikaneder]]'s troupe at [[Theater auf der Wieden|their new theatre]], and established a tradition within Schikaneder's company of fairy-tale operas that was to culminate two years later in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s and Schikaneder's opera ''[[The Magic Flute]]''; Sophie Seyler's ''Oberon'' is regarded as one of the primary influences on the plot and characters of ''The Magic Flute''.&lt;ref&gt;Buch, David (2008) ''Magic flutes &amp; enchanted forests: the supernatural in eighteenth-century musical theater'' (p. 293). University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-07810-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1792 Abel Seyler retired with a pension from [[Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel]], the royal governor of the twin duchies of Schleswig-Holstein. From 1798 he lived as a guest on the estate of the actor, his long-time friend and fellow prominent freemason [[Friedrich Ludwig Schröder]] in [[Rellingen]] in the [[Duchy of Holstein]], where he died on 25 April 1800 at the age of 69. He is interred in Rellingen.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Ludwig Wilhelm Meyer, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rN1TAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA215 Friedrich Ludwig Schröder: Beitrag zur Kunde des Menschen und des Künstlers]'', vol. 2, p. 215, Hoffmann und Campe, 1819&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
Seyler is widely regarded as one of the great theatre principals of 18th century Europe and has been described as "the leading patron of German theatre" in his lifetime.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; He is credited with introducing [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] to a German language audience, and with promoting the concept of a national theatre in the tradition of [[Ludvig Holberg]], the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' playwrights, and the development of a [[Opera in German|German opera]] tradition. Already in his lifetime, he was described as "one of German art's most meritorious men."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; He was lauded by contemporaries such as [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] and [[Christoph Martin Wieland]], who described him as a "man of perception and insight."&lt;ref&gt;''Der Teutsche Merkur'', 1773, I, p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; After his death his daughter Sophie Leisewitz, the wife of the poet [[Johann Anton Leisewitz]], wrote: "It was my happy fortune, out of childish duty, to worship the man whom thousands can only admire."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Schlenther: "[http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Seyler,_Abel Abel Seyler]." In: ''[[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]]'' (ADB). Vol. 34, Duncker &amp; Humblot, Leipzig 1892, pp.&amp;nbsp;778–782.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seyler mostly focused on the artistic, economic and administrative management of his theatrical company; his own lack of a background as an actor, and his former profession as a merchant banker, made him stand out among the theatre principals of his era, in a profession that was just starting to gain respectability. [[John Warrack]] noted that:
:The success of Abel Seyler's company in the post-war years was rooted in his business acumen, coupled with a flair for attracting talent, but he would not have flourished without the greater respect beginning to be accorded the travelling theatre companies in the new climate of interest in drama and hence in dramatic music.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Warrack]], ''German Opera: From the Beginnings to Wagner'' (p. 93), [[Cambridge University Press]], 2001, {{ISBN|0521235324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His theatrical legacy eventually overshadowed the dubious reputation he had earned as a banker in his younger years.

==Freemasonry==
Like many of his collaborators, Seyler was a [[freemason]]. He joined freemasonry in London in 1753,&lt;ref&gt;''Weiblichkeitsentwürfe und Frauen im Werk Lessings: Aufklärung und Gegenaufklärung bis 1800 : 35. und 36. Kamenzer Lessing-Tage 1996 und 1997'', Lessing-Museum, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; became a member of the Absalom lodge in Hamburg in May 1755,&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Steffens, ''Freimaurer in Deutschland: Bilanz eines Vierteljahrtausends'', p. 582, C. Wolff, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; and was involved with freemasonry until his death.

Abel Seyler and [[Konrad Ekhof]], along with other members of the Seyler Company, founded the first masonic lodge in [[Gotha]]. The founding took place on 25 June 1774 in the Gasthof Zum Mohren, on the occasion of the [[Nativity of St John the Baptist]], and Ekhof became the first [[Masonic Lodge Officers|Worshipful Master]] and Seyler the [[Masonic Lodge Officers|First Warden]]. The lodge was originally named ''Cosmopolit'', but was renamed ''Zum Rautenkranz'' in honour of the ducal family shortly after. Its members included several members of the Seyler Company, such as Seyler, Ekhof and the composer [[Georg Anton Benda]]; the reigning [[Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg|Duke Ernest II of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]] and the Duke's brother, [[Prince August of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]] joined shortly after its establishment, as did many members of the nobility and local elite of Gotha. The lodge became a centre of the spiritual and cultural life of Gotha, and a stronghold of [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] and [[philanthropy]]. Many members of Seyler's lodge, notably the Duke and his brother, also became members of the [[Illuminati]], and the Duke later offered that society's founder [[Adam Weishaupt]] asylum in Gotha.

==Personal life==
[[File:Ludwig Erdwin Seyler (1758-1836).jpg|thumb|upright|His son, the banker [[Ludwig Erdwin Seyler|L.E. Seyler]]; in contrast to his father he became a highly respected banker]]

Abel Seyler was married in his first marriage from 1754 to Sophie Elisabeth Andreae (1730–1764), the daughter of the wealthy Hanoverian court pharmacist Leopold Andreae (1686–1730) and Katharina Elisabeth Rosenhagen (died 1752). Her parents were already deceased and her only close relative was her older brother and only sibling, the court pharmacist [[Johann Gerhard Reinhard Andreae|J.G.R. Andreae]], who became a noted [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] natural scientist. The wedding took place in Hanover and Abel and Sophie Elisabeth had two sons and a daughter: [[Abel Seyler the Younger|Abel Seyler (the Younger)]], who became court pharmacist in [[Celle]] and who was a member of the [[Illuminati]]; [[Ludwig Erdwin Seyler|L.E. Seyler]], a prominent Hamburg banker and politician; and Sophie Seyler, who married the ''Sturm und Drang'' poet [[Johann Anton Leisewitz]], the author of ''[[Julius of Tarent]]''.

After the death of his first wife in 1764, their children were raised in Hanover by their maternal uncle. By several accounts J.G.R. Andreae was a highly erudite, generous and kind man who became a loving father figure to his sister's children; he had no children of his own. The children since had limited or no contact with their father, and all lived more conventional lives than him. They inherited the Andreae pharmacy from their uncle on his death in 1793.

In 1772 Abel Seyler married the actress [[Friederike Sophie Seyler]] (formerly married Hensel). They had no children.

The principal founder of biochemistry and molecular biology, [[Felix Hoppe-Seyler]], was an adopted son of his grandson. Seyler was a godfather of [[Jacob Herzfeld]] (born 1763),&lt;ref&gt;Paul Schlenther: [http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Seyler,_Abel Abel Seyler]. In: ''[[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]]'' (ADB). Band 34, Duncker &amp; Humblot, Leipzig 1892, pp. 778–782.&lt;/ref&gt; known as the first Jewish stage actor in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleID=2632 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103191329/http://www.jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleID=2632 |archivedate=2014-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when the latter converted to Christianity in 1796.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14593">'''Affective disposition theory''' ('''ADT'''), in its simplest form, states that [[Mass media|media]] and [[entertainment]] users make [[moral judgment]]s about characters in a [[narrative]] which in turn affects their enjoyment of the narrative.  This theory was first posited by Zillmann and Cantor (1972), and many offshoots have followed in various areas of entertainment (Raney, 2006a).  Entertainment users make constant judgments of a character's actions, and these judgments enable the user to determine which character they believe is the "[[Hero|good guy"]] or the "[[villain]]". However, in an article written in 2004, Raney examined the fundamental ADT assumption that viewers of [[drama]] always form their dispositions toward characters through moral judgment of motives and conduct. Raney argued that [[Audience|viewers]]/[[consumer]]s of entertainment media could form positive dispositions toward characters before any moral scrutinizing occurs. He proposed that viewers sometimes develop story schemas that provide them "with the cognitive pegs upon which to hang their initial interpretations and expectations of characters" (Raney, 2004a, p.&amp;nbsp;354). The basic idea of the affective disposition theory is used as a way to explain how emotions become part of the entertainment experience.

== Theory history and application ==
[[Disposition]] theory has multiple applications in many areas of entertainment.  Its most basic premise is that entertainment users attach an emotion to various characters within a narrative, but this has been expanded to [[comedy]], drama, [[tragedy]], violence, and sport (Raney, 2006a).  Although some theorist argue that the similar theories used to explore different forms of entertainment media encompass the same general processes, some evidence exists that disposition formation may differ across content. Sapolsky's research (1980) found that viewer race rather than the previously mentioned "morality" was an accurate predictor in team favorability in an all-White versus all-Black basketball game. With regard to [[antihero]] narratives, researchers such as Sapolsky have suggested that the actual formation process of dispositions may differ from the traditional affective disposition theory formula. The traditional Disposition Theory is closely related to [[misattribution theory of humor]].  Disposition Theory takes the position that entertainment users are just an audience, they are not active.  By employing this perspective, the audience does not experience real emotion towards the events in the narrative, but rather experience [[suspense]] instead.  Traditional Disposition Theory is most often applied in the context of humor, but is also applicable to drama and sports.

Raney (2006a) offered six principles that are shared amongst all applications of disposition theory:

#"Disposition-based theories are concerned with the [[enjoyment]] or appreciation of media content." (pg. 144)
#"Disposition-based theories are concerned with [[emotional response]]s to media content." (pg. 145)
#"Disposition-based theories contend that media enjoyment starts with and is driven by the viewer's feelings about the character." (pg. 145)
#"Disposition-based theories contend that affiliations towards characters are formed and maintained on a continuum from extreme positive through indifference to extreme negative affect." (pg. 146)
#"Because disposition-based theories rely upon the evaluation of [[Group conflict|conflict]] outcomes between characters, [[justice]] consideration are a necessary component of the theories." (pg. 147)
#"Disposition-based theories further acknowledge and rely upon the differences between individuals in terms of emotional responsiveness, personal experiences, basal morality, and countless other psychological and social-psychological factors." (pg. 147)
As stated earlier, disposition theories can be applied in many contexts, but most share similar characteristics, as identified by Raney (2006).  In summation, these six principles are strongly centered around the ideas of enjoyment of entertainment and emotional responses.  These theories can be used to formulate narratives and create drama and emotional arousal during a story.  Using these six principles, one can surmise that creating a strong and opposing disposition for the characters in the story will lead to greater enjoyment for the viewer.  By making a villain's actions terribly amoral, and the hero's actions extremely moral, one can create emotional arousal in a viewer.

== Model of forming dispositions ==
Zillmann (1996) offered a model of disposition formation.  The model begins with a character's behavior and ends with approval of the story.  There are seven main steps in disposition formation:

#[[Perception]] and Assessment – In this step, the viewer simply observes the act of the character.
# Moral Judgment – The viewer judges the action of the character as either appropriate and moral or inappropriate and amoral.  Here, the model splits paths.  If the viewer believes the act to be [[amoralism|amoral]], disposition formation takes a strikingly different route than if the viewer believes the act to be moral and appropriate.  From here, the moral route will be referred to as moral and the amoral route will be referred to as amoral.
#Affective Disposition – Here, if the viewer decides the character is following the moral route, they begin to form positive affect toward that character.  The opposite is true if the viewer decides the character is following the amoral route.
#[[Anticipation (emotion)|Anticipation]] and [[Apprehension (fear)|Apprehension]] – Here, the viewer hopes for a positive outcome and fears a negative outcome for the moral character while fearing a positive outcome and hoping for a negative outcome for the amoral character.
#Perception and Assessment – The outcome is viewed and an emotion is attached.
#Response to Outcome/Emotion – The viewer decides how they feel about the story and characters.
#Moral Judgment – The viewer decides if they approve of the outcome of the story or disapprove of it.

This model further illuminates the disposition process.  As stated earlier, if a story incites a strong disposition toward any character, viewer enjoyment is likely to be higher due to the emotional arousal created by the narrative.  Through this model, one can pinpoint where and how a disposition is created.  This model also displays the steps the viewer goes through to create a disposition.

== Application ==
The creator of any narrative can use Disposition Theory to heighten emotional arousal, and therefore enjoyment, in any narrative.  By applying the steps of the disposition model a writer can heighten the experience of a narrative.  Creating a strong disposition towards the characters will lead the viewer to hope for a positive outcome for the hero and a negative outcome for the villain, all the while fearing a negative outcome for the hero and fearing a positive outcome for the villain.  By delaying this outcome, the writer can create suspense in the viewer.  By creating suspense, the writer can heighten emotional arousal and, therefore, heighten enjoyment of the narrative.  In summation, by creating a strong disposition towards characters, a writer can heighten the audience's enjoyment of the narrative.

== Applied to sports spectatorship ==
The concepts of the traditional affective disposition theory have been applied to sports [[media consumption]] by considering the fact that enjoyment could be conceived as the emotional response to consuming media surrounding players or teams. The exploration of enjoyment of sport spectatorship is very complex and must take into account fan socialization and disposition formation. Research on fan socialization investigates how people are originally socialized as sports fans, and also examines the reasons why people form allegiances towards specific teams. Raney (2006b) states that these allegiances and types of socializations are at the core of the entertainment motivation for viewing [[sports media]].

The specific version of the disposition theory that is used in sport media viewing (Disposition Theory of Sport Spectatorship) applies the basic ideas of the disposition theory to sports content. The basic premise that is used to cross over into the world of sport is that enjoyment of entertainment is primarily a reflection of both the consumers' feelings toward the players or teams and the outcomes (Zillmann, 1985, 1991, 2000; Zillmann &amp; Cantor, 1977; Raney, 2004a, 2004b; Raney, 2006b; Peterson &amp; Raney, 2008). Raney (2006b) also found that the expectation of experiencing enjoyment is the greatest reason that sports media viewers report for why they consume sports media.

According to academic researchers and theorist (Bryant &amp; Raney, 2000; Zillman, Bryant &amp; Sapolsky, 1989; Zillman &amp; Paulus, 1993), the Disposition Theory of Sports Spectatorship states that a viewer’s affiliation or allegiance to a particular team or player must be discussed along a continuum. This continuum ranges from extremely positive through indifference to extremely negative. Raney (2006b) posits that the enjoyment of viewing a sporting event comes as a by-product of a combination of the outcome of the game, and the viewers strength and valence of dispositions held toward the competitors. Exposure to the competitors over time allows individuals to develop these dispositions of varying valence and degree toward teams and athletes. In more simplistic terms, the enjoyment of the spectator or viewer has been found to increase the more the winning team is favored by the spectator/viewer and the more the losing team is disliked by the spectator/viewer. Henceforth, the maximum enjoyment of the spectator comes when the intensely liked team or player defeats the intensely disliked team or player.

Additionally, research indicates that sports fanship in general is important to enjoyment of sports media. Specifically, Gantz &amp; Wenner (1991, 1995) found that the selective exposure to media and motivations for viewing sports media literatures indicate that fanship in relation to the particular sport also impacts perceptions about the contest. Therefore, the argument can be made that this level of dispositional affiliation toward the sport might also impact perceived suspense and enjoyment.

Raney and Depalma (2006) also noted that the nature of the sport being view, either scripted or unscripted, cause viewers to approach the sporting event with differing expectations of enjoyment. The uncertainty of outcomes for contests that are unscripted when combined with multiple other factors such as rivalry strength and importance of the game to the overall ranking of the team affect the suspense and enjoyment of viewing.

'''Alexander Carpenter''', Latinized as '''''Fabricius''''' (''fl.'' 1429), was the author of the ''Destructorium viciorum'', a religious work popular in the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Robert Owst: ''The Destructorium viciorum of Alexander Carpenter'', Church Historical Society, [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]], London, 1952, 40 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Carpenter, Alexander |volume=9|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Watson (ed.): ''The New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature, Volume 1, 600-1660''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1974, p. 803.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some published editions of the work bear the author's name as "''Alexander Anglus''" ("Alexander the Englishman"), but he is further identified in a 1496 edition which states that the work was compiled "''a cuiusdam fabri lignarii filio''" -- "by a certain son of a worker of wood," ''i.e.'', a carpenter's son.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ludwig Hain]]: ''Repertorium Bibliographicum in Usum Scholarum'' ["Bibliographic Directory for Scholarly Use"], J. G. Cottae Stuttgartiae et Jul. Renouard Lutetiae Parisiorum, 1826, Vol. I, Pt. I, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; This identifier also states that the work was begun in 1429, which rules out authorship by [[Alexander of Hales]] (''ca.'' 1185-1245) which had by some scholars been considered a possibility. Alexander Carpenter authored other works, termed [[Homiliarium|''Homiliae eruditae'']] ("Learned Sermons"), but they are not at present known.

Carpenter is thought by some to have been a follower of the English theologian [[John Wycliffe]] (''ca.'' 1328-1384), but that is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Bale]], ''Scriptorum illustrium maioris Britanniae, quam nunc Angliam et Scotiam vocant, catalogus'' ["Catalogue of the Famous Writers of Great Britain, now called England and Scotland"], Basel: 1557-1559, vol.

'''Andrew Clark''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|commas=on|FBA|size=100%}} (born 1957) is a professor of [[philosophy]] and [[Chair (official)|Chair]] in [[Logic]] and [[Metaphysics]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philosophy.ed.ac.uk/people/view.php?name=andy-clark-frse&lt;/ref&gt; Before this, he was director of the [[Cognitive Science]] Program at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana]] and previously taught at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], Missouri and the [[University of Sussex]] in England. Clark is one of the founding members of the CONTACT collaborative research project whose aim is to investigate the role environment plays in shaping the nature of conscious experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linus.media.unisi.it/cirg/contact/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061013182832/http://linus.media.unisi.it/cirg/contact/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 October 2006 |title=CONTACT - Consciousness in Interaction |first= |last= |work=linus.media.unisi.it |year=2006 |accessdate=3 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clark's papers and books deal with the [[philosophy of mind]] and he is considered a leading scientist in [[mind extension]]. He has also written extensively on [[connectionism]], [[robotics]] and the role and nature of [[mental representation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philosophy.ed.ac.uk/people/clark/publications.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== General themes in Clark's work ==

Clark's work explores a number of disparate but interrelated themes.  Many of these themes run against established wisdom in cognitive processing and representation. According to traditional computational accounts, the function of the mind is understood as the process of creating, storing and updating internal representations of the world, on the basis of which other processes and actions may take place. Representations are updated to correspond with an environment in accordance with the function, goal-state, or desire of the system in question at any given time. Thus, for example, learning a new route through a maze-like building would be mirrored in a change in the representation of that building. Action, on this view, is the outcome of a process which determines the best way to achieve the goal-state or desire, based on current representations. Such a determinative process may be the purview of a [[Cartesian dualism|Cartesian]] "central executive" or a distributed process like homuncular decomposition.

In contrast to traditional models of cognition, which often posit the one-way flow of sensory information from the periphery towards more remote areas of the brain, Clark has suggested a two-way "cascade of cortical processing" underlying perception, action, and learning. The concept of [[Generalized filtering#Relationship to Bayesian filtering and predictive coding|predictive processing]] lies at the heart of this view, wherein top-down predictions attempt to correctly guess or "explain away" bottom-up sensory information in an iterative, hierarchical manner. Discrepancies between the expected signal and actual signal, in essence the "prediction error," travel upward to help refine the accuracy of future predictions. Interactions between forward flow of error (conveyed by "error units") and backward flow of prediction are dynamic, with attention playing a key role in weighting the relative influence of either at each level of the cascade (dopamine is mentioned as "one possible mechanism for encoding precision" with regard to error units). Action (or action-oriented predictive processing) also plays an important role in Clark's account as another means by which the brain can reduce prediction error by directly influencing the environment. To this, he adds that "personal, affective, and hedonic" factors would be implicated along with the minimization of prediction error, creating a more nuanced model for the relationship between action and perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Whatever next? Predictive brains, situated agents, and the future of cognitive science|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0140525X12000477|journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date = 2013-06-01|issn = 1469-1825|pages = 181–204|volume = 36|issue = 3|doi = 10.1017/S0140525X12000477|pmid = 23663408|first = Andy|last = Clark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Clark, the [[computational model]], which forms the philosophical foundation of [[artificial intelligence]], engenders several intractable problems. One of the more salient is an information [[bottleneck (software)|bottleneck]]: if, in order to determine appropriate actions, it is the job of the mind to construct detailed inner representations of the external world, then, as the world is constantly changing, the demands on the mental system will almost certainly preclude any action taking place. For Clark, we need relatively little information about the world before we may act effectively upon it. We tend to be susceptible to "grand illusion", where our impressions of a richly detailed world obscures a reality of minimal environmental information and quick action. We needn't try to reconstruct the detail of this world, as it is able to serve as its own best model from which to extract information "just in time".

Clark's writings also focus on the concept of [[transhumanism]], most prevalent in his work, ''Natural-Born Cyborgs'' which explores the progressing incorporation of human biology and technological implants. Through a series of contemporary technological studies and an evaluation of the cyborg figure in pop-culture, Clark maps out a perception of the cyborg as a reality. This is not necessarily to show what humanity is to become from biologically implanted technology, but rather to explore where humanity is now with said technology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In his own words, humans are "creatures whose minds are special precisely because they are tailor-made for multiple mergers and coalitions." &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Natural-Born Cyborgs: Minds, Technologies, and the Future of Human Intelligence|last=Clark|first=Andy|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=978-0195177510|location=198 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10016|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He elaborates this as he describes his body as an "electronic virgin" untouched by technology, but gradually over time technology will become intertwined with his biology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Whether that incorporation will be as mundane as the use of eyeglasses or something more advanced such as a new auditory prosthesis, he believes the merger of technology and biology is inevitable and present.

== ''The Extended Mind'' ==

Clark is perhaps most well known for his defence of the [[extended mind]] hypothesis. 
According to Clark, the dynamic loops through which mind and world interact are not merely instrumental; the cycle of activity that runs from brain through body and world and back again is what constitutes cognition. The mind, on this account, is not restricted to the biological organism but extends into that organism's environment. An example is carrying out a mathematical task. One person may complete the task solely in their head, while another completes the task with the assistance of paper and pencil. By Clark's [https://books.google.com/books?id=jpZtWfQ6yCgC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=%22Cognitive+Systems+and+the+Extended+Mind%22+%22parity+principle%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=80OsUoTAB-SZ0QWC5YHACA&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Cognitive%20Systems%20and%20the%20Extended%20Mind%22%20%22parity%20principle%22&amp;f=false parity principle], there is no reason to count these means as different so long as the results are the same. The process of cognition in the second case involves paper and pencil, so the conception of mind appropriate to the person involved must include these items.

Clark concedes that, in practice, the criterion of "equal efficiency"{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} required by the parity principle is seldom met. He nonetheless proposes that the boundary of "skin and skull" is arbitrary and cognitively meaningless. If, in the example above, the paper and pencil used by the second person becomes a virtual paper-and-pencil visible on a monitor and controlled by a silicon chip implanted in the head, the similarity between the two situations becomes clearer.

Clark foresees the development of [[Neuroprosthetics#Cognitive prostheses|cognitive prosthetics]], or "electronic brain enhancements" ("EBEs"), as only{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} the next logical step in the human mind's natural integration with technology. Clark's research interests also include [[wetwiring]] and other human-electronic integration experiments, as well as technological advances in immediate human communication and their utilization in society.

To further illustrate [[extended cognition]], Clark uses two anecdotal examples: Inga and Otto, the latter being a patient of [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's disease]]. Both desire to visit a museum and must remember the address. For Inga, this is a matter of simple memory recall and accessing her belief in where she remembers the given location of the museum. Due to his condition, Otto relies on the use of written records in a notebook in order to recall his memory, as the disease makes it difficult for him to have a finite belief on the museum's location without it. This notebook in a way becomes his livelihood, functioning as a memory bank to accommodate his condition. As Clark puts it, "his notebook plays the role usually played by a biological memory" effectively becoming a part of his extended mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark|first=Andy|last2=Chalmers|first2=David|title=The Extended Mind|jstor=3328150|journal=Analysis|volume= 58|pages=7|doi=10.1093/analys/58.1.7|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of describing the thought processes of Inga and Otto is to show multiple variations of extended cognition and how it functions differently among individuals depending on their mental biology. Clark claims the key aspect that unites the cognitive process of the two individuals is that each has the initial belief on where the museum is located. Although the way the verification of belief differs in practice between the two, they are still able to come up with a solution on the museum's location despite one using a source of external storage. In a later work, Clark addresses any potential criticism on the process of Otto's system of belief by stating that Otto's impulse to consult his notebook is a similar process to that of Inga consulting her recalled memory. Clark also elaborates on the importance of environment when using extended cognition. He believes that the way one formalizes "beliefs" is, "constituted partly by features of the environment" if they are playing the desired role of "driving cognitive processes.” &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark|first=Andy|title=Intrinsic Content, Active Memory and the Extended Mind|jstor= 3329327|journal=Analysis|volume= 65|pages=1|doi=10.1093/analys/65.1.1|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This summarizes his belief that the mind, in fact, can extend to the surrounding environment.

Although the comparisons between Otto and Inga may seem distant when judging the power of extended cognition, Clark attempts to gap a more similar comparison between the two by claiming that if Otto were to lose his notebook it would be the same as Inga losing a thought from her consciousness. He also suggests the concept of Otto's notebook being an extension of himself, having it take on a more material role suggesting that it may be equal to the way one treats a physical appendage to their body. The notebook in a way becomes a "fragile biological limb or organ" one that Otto may feel to protect from harm's way.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Supporters of extended cognition have used Clark's comparison between Inga and Otto as a champion analogy to support the theory of the internal mind extending into the environment. In an article on the argument of extended cognition, Erik Myin makes note of this group, "a close causal coupling between persons and environments," such as Otto and his notebook, "can license the conclusion that the mind spreads into the environment." His also writes that some followers use Clark's argument of, "external elements" playing a role that could be seen as, "cognitive if played by something internal to a person."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Myin |first=Erik |date=29 October 2010 |title= Unbounding the Mind|jstor= 40931691|journal=Science|volume=330 |issue=6004 |pages=589 |doi=10.1126/science.1197367 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A good reference to this would be how Otto's notebook is used for cognitive verification.

''The Extended Mind'' has been met with criticism from scholars challenging extended cognition. The claim is that Clark's theories lack a differentiation of biological memory and external storage of thought. This is mainly addressed to the cognitive comparison between Otto and Inga, and how their thought processes are viewed as equal an engagement of extended thought given Otto's condition. When he uses his notepad, it is necessary reliance, as these records will help him to remember his thoughts. However, there is an argument questioning if this follows Clark's description of extended cognition as it requires a running cycle of cognitive connectivity that returns to the body.

In a critique of Clark's ''Supersizing the Mind'', [[Lawrence Shapiro]] and Shannon Spaulding, of [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|The University of Wisconsin-Madison]], touch upon this criticism from scholars who challenge extended cognition. They describe the argument against Clark being that "...cognitive routines involving biological memory and those involving external stores of information are importantly different."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/24037-supersizing-the-mind-embodiment-action-and-cognitive-extension/|title=Supersizing the Mind: Embodiment, Action, and Cognitive Extension, Reviewed by Lawrence Shapiro, University of Wisconsin-Madison and Shannon Spaulding, University of Wisconsin-Madison|last=Shapiro|first=Lawrence|last2=Spaulding|first2=Shannon|date=3 June 2009|website=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews|publisher=University of Notre Dame|access-date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially they are claiming that the way someone stores memory externally is separate from their biological cognition. For example, if Inga were to use a notepad, it would function as an extension of her compression as her thought process would follow Clark's description of dynamic loops that return to the mind in a cycle. However, when Otto uses the notepad has a way to retain his memory, whatever thoughts he records will not follow back and will become disconnected from his biological mind. In this respect, parts of Otto's mind would essentially "exist outside his brain,"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; meaning that the comparison between Inga and Otto may not be reliant as they appear to function differently in Clark's own theory.

This criticism of Otto and Inga is addressed by Clark himself in ''Supersizing the Mind'':&lt;blockquote&gt;“[the] claim was not that the processes in Otto and Inga are identical, or even similar, in terms of their detailed implementation. It is simply that, with respect to the role that the long-term encodings play in guiding current response, both modes of storage can be seen as supporting dispositional beliefs. It is the way the information is poised to guide reasoning … and behavior that counts. (p. 96)” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Supersizing the Mind: Embodiment, Action, and Cognitive Extension|last=Clark|first=Andy|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780195333213|location=|pages=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;He argues that extended cognition was never meant to be a universal "fine-grained similarity"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; between all minds. He believes that such a "fine-grained similarity" is not necessary when analyzing extended consciousness, suggesting it differs depending on an individual's behavior and their given environment.

'''Antiphilosophy''' has been used as a denigrating word&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Bosteels, "Radical Antiphilosophy," [[Filozofski vestnik]] (2008)1, 55-87&lt;/ref&gt; but recently it has acquired more positive connotations as an opposition to more traditional philosophy.&lt;ref name=maddy93&gt;Penelope Maddy, "Wittgenstein's Anti-Philosophy of Mathematics", Johannes Czermak and Klaus Paul, eds., ''Wittgenstein's Philosophy of Mathematics'', 1993, http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~pjmaddy/bio/wittgenstein%27s%20anti-philosophy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Riis82&gt;Jan Riis Flor, "Den senere Wittgenstein", Poul Lübcke, ed., ''Vor tids filosofi: Videnskab og sprog'', Politikens forlag, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;
The views of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], specifically his [[metaphilosophy]], could be said to be antiphilosophy.&lt;ref name=maddy93/&gt;&lt;ref name=horwich13&gt;http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/was-wittgenstein-right/, Paul Horwich, "Was Wittgenstein Right?", The New York Times, 2013-03-03&lt;/ref&gt;

Antiphilosophy is anti-theoretical, critical of [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] justifications, and
sees philosophical problems as misconceptions that are to be [[therapeutic approach|therapeutically]] dissolved.&lt;ref name=horwich13/&gt;

==Antiphilosophy and Wittgenstein's metaphilosophy==
In &lt;ref name=horwich13/&gt; [[Paul Horwich]] points to Wittgenstein's rejection of philosophy as traditionally and currently practiced and his "insistence that it can't give us the kind of knowledge generally regarded as its raison d'être".

Horwich goes on to argue that:
{{quote|Wittgenstein claims that there are no realms of phenomena whose study is the special business of a philosopher, and about which he or she should devise profound a priori theories and sophisticated supporting arguments. There are no startling discoveries to be made of facts, not open to the methods of science, yet accessible "from the armchair" through some blend of intuition, pure reason and conceptual analysis. Indeed the whole idea of a subject that could yield such results is based on confusion and wishful thinking.}}

Horwich concludes that, according to Wittgenstein,
philosophy "must avoid theory-construction and instead be merely 'therapeutic,' confined to exposing the irrational assumptions on which theory-oriented investigations are based and the irrational conclusions to which they lead".

Moreover, these antiphilosophical views are central to Wittgenstein, Horwich argues.&lt;!--He does. I think in the NYT article, but at least in the book. The NYT article should be checked to make sure though.--&gt;

==Examples of antiphilosophical positions==

===Ethics===
The antiphilosopher could argue that, with regard to ethics, there is only practical, ordinary reasoning. Therefore, it is wrong to a priori superimpose overarching ideas of what is good for philosophical reasons. For example, it is wrong to blanketly assume that only happiness matters, as in [[utilitarianism]]. This is not to say though that some utilitarian-like argument can’t be valid when it comes to what is right in some particular case.

===Continuum hypothesis===
Consider the [[continuum hypothesis]], stating that there is no set with size strictly between the size of the natural numbers and the size of the real numbers. One idea is that the set universe ought to be rich, with many sets, which leads to the continuum hypothesis being false.&lt;ref&gt;[[Continuum hypothesis#Arguments for and against CH]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Maddy, June 1988, "Believing the Axioms, I", ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'' 53 (2): 481–511, http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~pjmaddy/bio/Believing%20the%20Axioms%20(with%20corrections).pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This richness argument, the antiphilosopher might argue, is purely philosophical, and groundless, and therefore should be dismissed; maintaining that the continuum hypothesis should be settled by mathematical arguments. In particular it could be the case that the question isn't mathematically meaningful or useful, that the hypothesis is neither true, nor false. It is then wrong to stipulate, a priori and for philosophical reasons, that the continuum hypothesis is true or false.{{efn-lr|Cf.&lt;ref name=maddy93/&gt; and Wittgenstein's view on "pure mathematics".}}

'''Arnold Gehlen''' (29 January 1904 in [[Leipzig]], [[German Empire]] &amp;ndash; 30 January 1976 in [[Hamburg]], [[West Germany]]) was an influential [[conservativism|conservative]] German philosopher, sociologist, and anthropologist.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Peter L., and Hansfried Kellner (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
His major influences while studying philosophy were [[Hans Driesch]], [[Nicolai Hartmann]] and especially [[Max Scheler]].

In 1933 Gehlen signed the ''[[w:de:Bekenntnis der deutschen Professoren zu Adolf Hitler|Loyalty Oath of German Professors to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist State]]''.

He joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1933 and had a shining career as a member of the '[[Leipzig school (sociology)|Leipzig School]]' under [[Hans Freyer]]. He replaced [[Paul Tillich]], who emigrated to the U.S., at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]]. In 1938 he accepted a teaching position at the [[University of Königsberg]] (today's [[Kaliningrad]]) and then taught at the [[University of Vienna]] in 1940 until he was drafted into the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' in 1943. After his '[[denazification]]' he taught at the administrative college in [[Speyer]]. He went on to teach at the [[RWTH Aachen|Aachen University of Technology]] between 1962 and 1969. Gehlen became a sharp critic of the [[protest]] movements that developed in the late 1960s. 
Gehlen's philosophy has influenced many contemporary [[neoconservatism (disambiguation)|neoconservative]] German thinkers. Many terms from his work, like ''[[Reizüberflutung]]'' ("[[Sensory overload]]"), [[institution|deinstitutionalization]] or post-[[history]], have gained popular currency in Germany.

'''Behat Bibi''' also known as '''Behat Ded''' was a disciple of '''[[Sheikh Noor-ud-din Wali|Sheikh Noor-Ud-Din (Nund Reshi)]]''', the patron Saint of '''[[Kashmir]]'''. She along with her sister '''[[Dehat Bibi]]''' are sometimes referred as Tsat'a Kori, literally girl disciples or girl students of Nund Reshi.
Behat Bibi and Dehat Bibi were daughters of a Kashmiri Pundit who was a village Patwari by profession and had converted to Islam under the influence of the great Sufi saint. 
&lt;br /&gt;
The exalted state of their spirituality, the depth and breadth their knowledge is testified by the fact that the two girls became the only known '''female Khalifas''' of Nund Reshi. They are both buried at a village named Zalsu, a few miles from the village of '''Tsar''' ('''Chrar Sharif''') in the valley of Kashmir. The two sisters were present at a meeting that took place between Sheikh Noor-Ud-Din and the great proselytizer '''Saiyed Muhammad Hamadani'''.  The presence of two female disciples in such an important meeting confirms the fact that they were regarded highly by the great Reshi. 
&lt;br/&gt;
It is said that when Hamadani saw the physically weak Reshi, he remarked that he (Nund Reshi) should not keep his horse (his body) in such a weak condition. To this the great Reshi replied that to control once “'''nafas'''” (physical needs) was very important because otherwise just like a well-fed horse it could become unmanageable.  Dehat Bibi is said to have remarked, “Those who have already reached their destination or goal do not need a ride or a whip.” To this Saiyed Hamadani is supposed to have asked her, who did she think had reached that goal? Dehat Bibi is said to have replied, “Those who have liberated themselves from the clutches of self.” 
When asked if she was a girl or a boy, Dehat Bibi’s answer was simple yet filled with such profound depth that it left everyone speechless; “If I am non-existent ('''''neest''''' in [[Persian language|Persian]]) then I am neither a girl nor a boy; but if I am existent ('''''hast''''' in Persian) then I am nothing.”
Among Behat Bibi’s many sayings are the following:
# Salvation from hope and fear lies in annihilating the self.
# One who destroys one’s ego is relieved of the sorrows of one’s existence.

'''Contrastivism''', or the '''contrast theory of meaning''', is an [[epistemology|epistemological]] theory proposed by [[Jonathan Schaffer]] that suggests that knowledge attributions have a ternary structure of the form 'S knows that p rather than q'. This is in contrast to the traditional view whereby knowledge attributions have a binary structure of the form 'S knows that p'. Contrastivism was suggested as an alternative to [[contextualism]]. Both are semantic theories that try to explain skepticism using semantic methods.

[[Walter Sinnott-Armstrong]] proposed in a paper titled "A Contrastivist Manifesto"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/02691720802546120 | volume=22 | title=A Contrastivist Manifesto | journal=Social Epistemology | pages=257–270}}&lt;/ref&gt; a variant of contrastivism that, he argues, differs from contextualism, invariantism, and Schaffer's contrastivism.

[[Ernest Gellner]] in ''[[Ernest Gellner#Words and Things|Words and Things]]'' "terms derive their meaning from the fact that there are or could be things which fall under them and that there are others which do not." (Emphasis in original.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gellner|first=Ernest|title=Words and Things|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The contrast clause ==
The '...rather than q' part of the knowledge attribution is known as the 'contrast clause'. This is what separates it from traditional binary formulations. Rather than taking the same road as [[contextualism]] and saying that the meaning of 'knows' can change with attributor context the contrastivist claims that it is the unspoken contrast clause that changes. This can be used to avoid skeptical problems.

{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
{{Buddhism| terse=1}}
'''Dampa Sangye''' ({{bo|w=dam pa sangs rgyas}} "Excellent [[Buddhahood]]", d.1117, also called "Father Excellent Buddhahood", {{bo|w=pha dam pa sangs rgyas}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tbrc.org/kb/tbrc-detail.xq;jsessionid=7F2701A988FD9D124D2483D420FD56DD?RID=P1243&amp;wylie=n tbrc.org: pha dam pa sangs rgyas]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[mahasiddha]] of the [[India]]n [[Tantra]] movement who transmitted many teachings based on both [[Sutrayana]] and Tantrayana to Buddhist practitioners in Tibet in the late 11th century. He travelled to [[Tibet]] more than five times. On his third trip from India to Tibet he met [[Machig Labdrön]]. Dampa Sangye appears in many of the [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]]s of [[Chöd]] and so in Tibet he is known as the Father of Chod, however perhaps his best known teaching is "the Pacification" ({{bo|t=ཞི་བྱེད།|w=zhi byed|s=Zhijé}}). This teaching became an element of the [[Mahamudra]] [[Chöd]] lineages founded by [[Machig Labdrön]].

His Tibetan name translates into [[Sanskrit]] as ''Buddha Paramapitā'' "Buddha Excellent Father". He often was identified by the descriptive name ''Nakpopa'', "Black One".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huntington|first1=John C. |last2=Bangdel|first2=Dina|authorlink2=Dina Bangdel|title=The Circle of Bliss: Buddhist Meditational Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l3KmWbcq5foC&amp;pg=PA153|year=2003|publisher=Serindia Publications, Inc.|isbn=978-1-932476-01-9|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Some texts report that [[Padmasambhava]] was reborn as Dampa Sangye during the life of Machig Labdrön.&lt;ref&gt;[Women of Wisdom, Extract :MACHIG LAPDRON] "In the ''Life of Yeshe Tsogyel,''1 Padmasambhava predicted that Yeshe Tsogyel would be reborn as Machig Lapdron; her consort, [[Atsara Sale]], would become [[Topabhadra]], Machig’s husband; her assistant and consort to Padma Sambhava, Tashi Khyidren, would be reborn as Machig’s only daughter, and so on. All of the important figures in Tsogyeshayeni e legall’s life were to be reborn in the life of Machig Lapdron, including Padmasambhava himself, who would become [[Phadampa Sangye]]." by [[Tsultrim Allione]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another text says:{{quote|Padampa Sangye (known in India as Paramabuddha) was from southern India, and traveled widely in India, Tibet and China, until his death around 1117 AD. It is widely believed that Padampa Sangye was a mindstream 'emanation' ([[tulku]]) of  the 8th century monk [[Kamalaśīla]], one of the early teachers of the [[Dharma]] in Tibet. He spent much time teaching in the Tingri valley, located between Tibet and [[Nepal]], where he founded a monastery.,.&lt;ref&gt;[Reviews]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;["Deshalb ließ er sich in Tingri nieder und gründete dort ein Kloster."]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Drum khar Nagpopa'': Khampa yogi who meditated in [[dark retreat]] for 18 years was -according to [[Keith Dowman]]- considered to have been the twelfth of Dudjom/Jiktrel Yeshe Dorje's seventeen previous incarnations.&lt;ref&gt;[Lineage Dudjom Rimpoche] Websites of Keith Dowman&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Dilgo Khyentse]] (1910–1991), considered an emanation of Dampa Sangye, the story goes that the great pandit [[Śāntarakṣita]], who was instrumental in transplanting Buddhism from India to Tibet, promised that one of his students would come one day to complete his work. Kamalaśīla (Tib., Padampa Sangye) fulfilled this prophecy. Khyentse Rinpoche in a 1987 gathering of students at [[Shechen Monastery]], his seat in Nepal, offered a commentary on the Hundred Verses of Padampa Sangye.&lt;ref&gt;[Never Born, Never Ceasing - A teaching on the nature of mind by the late Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[esoteric]] oral tradition of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], a version of Dampa Sangye's life-story has him traveling to China and teaching there for 12 years, where he was known as [[Bodhidharma]] the founder of [[Zen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edou|first=Jérôme|title=Machig Labdrön and the Foundations of Chöd|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|year=1996|isbn=978-1-55939-039-2|page=32, p.181 n.20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dampa Sangye is associated with the [[Tingri (town)|Tingri]] area of [[Tibet]], where he lived for many years.

Bardok Chusang Rinpoche is recognized as the incarnation Dampa Sangye. He is a married [[yogi]], living in [[Kathmandu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lineage of Tinley Gyamtso Lama, the Bardok Chusang Rinpoche}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a [[morality tale]], [[allegory]] and teaching story inherent within the transmission of [[Chöd]] to Tibet that has been culturally remembered as a [[Cham dance]]. In this sacred dance, [[Moheyan]] is generally depicted as of ample girth goaded by children.&lt;ref&gt;An iconographic [[thangka]] depiction of Moheyan is held in the SAMA collection and may be seen here {{cite web |url=http://kaladarshan.arts.ohio-state.edu/exhib/sama/arh/pgs/T1016M.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720154139/http://kaladarshan.arts.ohio-state.edu/exhib/sama/arh/pgs/T1016M.html |archivedate=2008-07-20 |df= }} (accessed: January 14, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Chöd is a product of both the Indian and Chinese transmissions of Buddhism into the Himalaya. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} For a discussion of the [[Dunhuang]] fulcrum of the entwined relationship of Chinese and Indian Buddhism refer van Schaik and Dalton (2004).&lt;ref&gt;[[Sam van Schaik|van Schaik, Sam]] and Dalton, Jacob (2004).

For simplicity, the Indian tantric transmission may be characterized as "[[gradualism|gradualist]]", {{bo|t=རིམ་གྱིས་འཇུག་པ་|s=rim gyi jukpa}}&lt;ref name="earlytibet.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=van Schaik|first1=Sam|authorlink1=Sam van Schaik|title=The Great Perfection and the Chinese Monk: Nyingmapa Defenses of Hashang Mahāyānawebsite=Early Tibet}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{zh|t=漸悟|p=jiànwù}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Buswell|first1=Robert|authorlink1=Robert Buswell Jr.|last2=Lopez|first2=Donald S.|authorlink2=Donald S. Lopez Jr.|title=The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism|year=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-15786-3}}, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;) and the [[Chan Buddhism]] transmission may be characterized as "[[subitism|direct]]", {{bo|t=ཅིག་ཅར་གྱི་གྱི་འཇུག་པ་|s=chikchar gyi jukpa}}&lt;ref name="earlytibet.com"/&gt; ({{zh|t=頓悟|p=dùnwù}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Buswell|first1=Robert|authorlink1=Robert Buswell Jr.|last2=Lopez|first2=Donald S.|authorlink2=Donald S. Lopez Jr.|title=The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism|year=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-15786-3}}, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;). It needs to be emphasized that this neat [[dichotomy]] in characterization of these two approaches to the Dharma is only valid for the historical context of the great debate between [[Kamalaśīla]] and Moheyan arranged by [[Trisong Detsen]] and even then it is still open to dialectic. This debate has been named the "[[Kamalaśīla#Debate of Samye|Council of Samye]]" by [[Giuseppe Tucci]] and also as the "[[Samye|Bsam yas]] Debate" or "Council of Lhasa" in English. According to the general Tibetan tradition, the two years of the debate transpired at [[Samye]] (Tibetan ''Bsam yas''), a significant distance from [[Lhasa]].

According to the lore of the orthodox, prevailing Tibetan cultural tradition, [[Kamalaśīla]], a ''[[pandita (Buddhism)|mahapandita]]'' and scholar educated at [[Nalanda]], advocated the "gradual" process to enlightenment; whereas Moheyan, as a [[trance]] and [[meditation]] master advocated the "direct" awakening of original mind through the ''[[nirodha]]'' of discursive thought, the cessation of the mind of [[ideation (idea generation)|ideation]]. The historicity of this debate has been drawn into question by Gomez (1983)&lt;ref&gt;Gomez, Luis O. (1983). "The Direct and Gradual Approaches of Zen Master Mahāyāna: Fragments of the Teachings of Moheyan" in: Gimello, Robert M. and Peter N. Gregory (eds), ''Studies in Chan and Hua-yen''. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press: 393–434.&lt;/ref&gt; and Ruegg (1992)&lt;ref&gt;Ruegg, D. Seyfort (1992). ''Buddha-nature, Mind and the Problem of Gradualism in a Comparative Perspective: On the Transmission and Reception of Buddhism in India and Tibet''.

One hagiography asserts that directly after this debate with Moheyan, as Kamalaśīla was making his way down from the Himalaya to the Indian lowlands, he was incited to enact ''[[phowa]]''  through compassionate duress, transferring his [[mindstream]] to animate a corpse polluted with [[Infectious disease|contagion]]; and thereby, safely moving the hazard it presented.  As the mindstream of Kamalaśīla was otherwise engaged, mahāsidda Dampa Sangye came across the vacant ''kuten'' or "physical basis" of Kamalaśīla. Dampa Sangye was not karmically blessed with an aesthetic corporeal form, and upon finding the very handsome and healthy empty body of Kamalaśīla, which he perceived as a newly dead fresh corpse, Dampa Sangye transferred his mindstream into Kamalaśīla's body and left with his new beautiful  body. When Kamalaśīla returned to where he had left his body he only found the dark ugly body of Dampa Sangye, which he had no choice but to inhabit. Kamalaśīla's  mindstream in Dampa Sangye's body continued the ascent to the Himalaya and thereby transmitted Chöd.&lt;ref name="Thrangu, Khenchen 2007"&gt;Thrangu, Khenchen &amp; Klonk, Christoph (translator) &amp; Hollmann, Gaby (editor and annotator)(2006).

{{The Works of Aristotle}}

'''''De Interpretatione''''' or '''''On Interpretation''''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: Περὶ Ἑρμηνείας, ''Peri Hermeneias'') is the second text from [[Aristotle]]'s [[Organon]] and is among the earliest surviving philosophical works in the [[Western philosophy|Western tradition]] to deal with the relationship between language and logic in a comprehensive, explicit, and formal way. The work is usually known by its [[Latin]] title.

The work begins by analyzing simple ''categoric'' propositions, and draws a series of basic conclusions on the routine issues of classifying and defining basic linguistic forms, such as ''simple terms'' and ''propositions'', nouns and verbs, [[negation]], the ''quantity'' of simple propositions (primitive roots of the [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]] in modern symbolic logic), investigations on the ''excluded middle'' (what to Aristotle is not applicable to future tense propositions—the [[problem of future contingents]]), and on ''[[Modal logic|modal proposition]]s''.

The first five chapters deal with the terms that form propositions. Chapters 6 and 7 deal with the relationship between affirmative, negative, universal and particular propositions. These relationships are the basis of the well-known [[Square of opposition]]. The distinction between universal and particular propositions is the basis of modern [[quantification theory]]. The last three chapters deal with [[linguistic modality|modalities]]. Chapter 9 is famous for the discussion of the [[Problem of future contingents|sea-battle]].  (If it is true that there will be a sea-battle tomorrow, then it is true ''today'' that there will be a sea-battle. Thus a sea-battle is apparently unavoidable, and thus necessary. Another ''interpretation'' would be: that we cannot know that which has not yet come to pass. In other words: if there is a sea battle tomorrow then it is true today that tomorrow there will be a sea battle. So, only if we can know whether or not there will be a sea battle tomorrow then can we know if there will be a sea battle).

== Contents ==

''Chapter 1''. Aristotle defines words as symbols of 'affections of the soul' or mental experiences. Spoken and written symbols differ between languages, but the mental experiences are the same for all (so that the English word 'cat' and the French word 'chat' are different symbols, but the mental experience they stand for—the concept of a cat—is the same for English speakers and French speakers). Nouns and verbs on their own do not involve truth or falsity.

''Chapter 2''. A noun signifies the subject by convention, but without reference to time.

''Chapter 3''. A verb carries with it the notion of time.  'He was healthy' and 'he will be healthy' are tenses of a verb. An untensed verb indicates the present, the tenses of a verb indicate times outside the present.

''Chapter 4''. The sentence is an expression whose parts have meaning. The word 'cat' signifies something, but is not a sentence. Only when words are added to it do we have affirmation and negation.

''Chapter 5''. Every simple proposition contains a verb. A simple proposition indicates a single fact, and the conjunction of its parts gives a unity. A complex proposition is several propositions compounded together.

''Chapter 6''. An affirmation is an assertion of something, a denial an assertion denying something of something.  (For example, 'a man is an animal' asserts 'animal' of 'man'. 'A stone is not an animal' denies 'animal' of stone').

''Chapter 7''. Terms. Some terms are [[universality (philosophy)|universal]]. A universal term is capable of being asserted of several subjects (for example 'moon'—even though the Earth has one moon, it may have had more, and the noun 'moon' could have been said of them in exactly the same sense). Other terms are individual. An individual or singular term ('Plato') is not predicated (in the same) sense of more than one individual.

A [[universal affirmative]] proposition, such as, 'Every man is mortal' and a [[universal negative]] proposition having the same subject and predicate, such as, 'No man is mortal,' are called ''contrary''. A universal affirmative proposition ("Every man is mortal") and the non-universal denial of that proposition in a way ("Some men are not mortal") are called ''contradictories''. Of contradictories, one must be true, the other false. Contraries cannot both be true, although they can both be false, and hence their contradictories are both true. For example, both 'Every man is honest' and 'No man is honest' are false. But their contradictories, 'Some men are not honest' and 'Some men are honest,' are both true.

''Chapter 8''. An affirmation is single, if it expresses a single fact. For example, 'every man is mortal'. However, if a word has two meanings, for example if the word 'garment' meant 'man and horse', then 'the garment is white' would not be a single affirmation, for it would mean 'the man and horse are white', which is equivalent to the two simple propositions 'a man is white and a horse is white'.

''Chapter 9''. Of contradictory propositions about the past and present, one must be true, the other false. But when the subject is individual, and the proposition is future, this is not the case. For if so, nothing takes place by chance. For either the future proposition such as, 'A sea battle will take place,' corresponds with future reality, or its negation does, in which case the sea battle will take place with necessity, or not take place with necessity. But in reality, such an event might just as easily not happen as happen; the meaning of the word 'by chance' with regard to future events is that reality is so constituted that it may issue in either of two opposite possibilities. This is known as the [[problem of future contingents]].

''Chapter 10''. Aristotle enumerates the affirmations and denials that can be assigned when 'indefinite' terms such as 'unjust' are included.  He makes a distinction that was to become important later, between the use of the verb 'is' as a mere copula or 'third element', as in the sentence 'a man is wise', and as a predicate signifying existence, as in 'a man is [i.e. exists]'.

''Chapter 11''. Some propositions appear to be simple, but are really composite. In a single proposition, the nouns referring to the subjects combine to form a unity. Thus, 'two-footed domesticated animal' applies to a 'man', and the three predicates combine to form a unity. But in the term 'a white walking man' the three predicates do not combine to form a unity of this sort.

''Chapter 12''. This chapter considers the mutual relation of modal propositions: affirmations and denials which assert or deny possibility or contingency, impossibility or necessity.
 
''Chapter 13''. The relation between such propositions. Logical consequences follow from this arrangement. For example, from the proposition 'it is possible' it follows that it is contingent, that it is not impossible, or from the proposition 'it cannot be the case' there follows 'it is necessarily not the case'.

''Chapter 14''. Is there an affirmative proposition corresponding to every denial? For example, is the proposition 'every man is unjust' an affirmation (since it seems to affirm being unjust of every man) or is it merely a negative (since it denies justice)?

==  Square of opposition (logical square) and modal logic  ==

The logical square, also called square of opposition or square of [[Apuleius]] has its origin in the four marked sentences to be employed in syllogistic reasoning: Every man is white, the universal affirmative and its negation Not every man is white (or Some men are not white), the particular negative on the one hand, Some men are white, the particular affirmative and its negation No man is white, the universal negative on the other. [[Robert Blanché]] published with Vrin his book ''Structures intellectuelles'' in 1966 and since then many scholars think that the logical square or [[square of opposition]] representing four values should be replaced by the [[logical hexagon]] which by representing six values is a more potent figure because it has the power to explain more things about logic and natural language. The study of the four propositions constituting the square is found in Chapter 7 and its appendix Chapter 8. Most important also is the immediately following Chapter 9 dealing with the problem of future contingents. This chapter and the subsequent ones are at the origin of [[modal logic]].

==Translations==
Aristotle's original Greek text, Περὶ Ἑρμηνείας (''Peri Hermeneias'') was translated into the Latin ''"De Interpretatione"'' by [[Marius Victorinus]], at Rome, in the 4th century.

Another translation was completed by [[Boethius]] in the 6th century, c. 510/512.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1303">The '''delegate model of representation''' is a model of a [[representative democracy]]. In this model, [[Electoral district|constituents]] elect their representatives as [[delegates]] for their [[constituency]]. These delegates act only as a mouthpiece for the wishes of their constituency/ state, and have no [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomy]] from the constituency only the autonomy to vote for the actual representatives of the state. This model does not provide representatives the luxury of acting in their own conscience. Essentially, the representative acts as the voice of those who are (literally) not present.

This model was contested by [[Edmund Burke]] (1729-1797), an Irish philosopher, who also created the [[trustee model of representation]].

'''Douglas Kellner''' (born 1943) is an academic who works at the intersection of "third generation" [[critical theory]] in the tradition of the Frankfurt Institute for Social Research, or [[Frankfurt School]] and in [[cultural studies]] in the tradition of the Birmingham [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]], also known as the "Birmingham School". He has argued that these two conflicting philosophies are in fact compatible.&lt;ref name="KELLNER1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kellner|first1=Douglas|title=The Frankfurt School and British Cultural Studies: The Missed Articulation|url=https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/Illumina%20Folder/kell16.htm|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently the George Kneller Chair in the Philosophy of Education in the [[UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies|Graduate School of Education and Information Studies]] at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].

Kellner was an early theorist of the field of critical media literacy and has been a leading theorist of media culture generally.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} In his recent work, he has increasingly argued that media culture has become dominated by the forms of spectacle and mega-spectacle. He also has contributed important studies of alter-globalization processes, and has always been concerned with counter-hegemonic movements and alternative cultural expressions in the name of a more radically democratic society.&lt;ref&gt;Kellner, Douglas. ''Media Culture: Cultural Studies, Identity and Politics Between the Modern and the Postmodern''. 1995 London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, he is known for his work exploring the politically oppositional potentials of new media and attempted to delineate what they term "multiple technoliteracies" as a movement away from the present attempt to standardize a corporatist form of computer literacy.

He has collaborated with a number of other authors, including K. Daniel Cho, Tyson E. Lewis, Clayton Pierce, and Rhonda Hammer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kellner|first1=Douglas|title=Welcome|url=https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Steven Best]], Kellner collaborated on an award-winning trilogy of books examining postmodern turns in philosophy, the arts, and science and technology. He served as the literary executor of the documentary film maker [[Emile de Antonio]] and is now overseeing the publication of six volumes of the collected papers of the critical theorist [[Herbert Marcuse]].
 
==Education and career==
During the 1960s, Kellner was a philosophy student at Columbia University in New York and partook in student protests against the [[Vietnam War]].  During this time he came to believe in the political nature of knowledge as well as the relationship between history and the production of ideas.  A historical understanding of philosophy's relationship to one's lived experiences became increasingly clear to Kellner through his research into German [[critical theory]] at the [[University of Tübingen]] in Germany.  While studying there, he read the works of [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]], [[Karl Korsch]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], and [[Ernst Bloch]], all of whom were instrumental in  a new form of Marxist criticism concerned primarily with questions of culture and subjectivity rather than with analysing production.

Kellner then went from Germany to France, where he attended lectures and read books of [[Michel Foucault]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]], and others who would be associated with [[postmodern]] theory. Hence, Kellner's philosophical explorations did not end with the Frankfurt School.  With his co-author [[Steven Best]], Kellner has gone on to write a series of books critically interrogating what has come to be known as postmodern theory.  Although adopting many insights from postmodernists such as [[Michel Foucault]], as well as many feminist and [[critical race theorists]], Kellner retains the centrality of critical theory as a macro-theoretical lens capable of building [[conceptual bridge]]s between various political movements and capable of critically evaluating and mediating competing philosophical perspectives.
  
Throughout his philosophical adventures, Kellner has drawn from the Frankfurt School a concern for the industrialization and commercialization of culture under capitalist relations of production. This situation has become most acute in the United States with its highly commercial media culture.  Combining insights and methodological tools from the Frankfurt School and from British cultural studies, Kellner has written on media culture as a complex political, philosophical, and economic phenomenon.  In his view,  media emerges as a "contested terrain" in which political struggles are played out in narrative and visual forms.  Thus films, television, internet, etc. articulate dominant, conservative, reactionary social values but also offer progressive resistance against these values.  As an example of Kellner's method of media analysis, he has  read the image of the pop sensation [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] as a complex representation of women that challenges gender, sexual, and fashion stereotypes while at the same time reasserting those very codes by offering a "new" notion of the self that is reliant upon [[hyper-consumerism]].  Kellner's work in the area of media culture has been influential for educators concerned with fostering "[[critical media literacy]]" capable of decoding the complexities of the visual culture that surrounds us.

Another equally important line of inquiry defining Kellner's work is his interest in "[[techno-capitalism]]" or capitalism defined by ever sophisticated advances in technology.  Thus Kellner has been at the forefront of theorizing new technologies and their social, political, and economic impacts.  His interest in technologies began in the mid-seventies while a professor at the [[University of Texas at Austin]].  Here Kellner studied the political economy of television producing the renowned and original works ''Television and the Crisis of Democracy'' and ''The Persian Gulf Television War'' as well as launching his own very successful alternative culture [[public-access television]] [[cable TV]] show entitled ''[[Alternative Views]]''.  As with his theories of media images, Kellner offers a dialectical approach to new technologies, highlighting their progressive and democratic potentials while also critiquing the undeniable reality of corporate interests that drive the technologies market.  Again this work has become increasingly important for educators concerned with the role of technology in the classroom. Indeed, Kellner has focused studies in education on explicating media literacy and the multiple literacies needed to critically engage culture in the contemporary era. On this basis, he has called for a democratic reconstruction of education for the new digitized, mediated, global and multicultural era.

==Recent controversies==
In January 2006, Kellner was caught up in the [[Bruin Alumni Association]]'s controversial "Dirty Thirty"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uclaprofs.com/articles/dirtythirty.html Dirty Thirty]&lt;/ref&gt; project which listed UCLA's most politically extreme professors. The list was compiled by a former UCLA graduate student, Andrew Jones, who had previously been fired by his mentor [[David Horowitz]] for pressuring "students to file false reports about leftists" and for stealing Horowitz's mailing list of potential contributors to fund research for attacks on leftwing professors.&lt;ref&gt;"Campus Activist Goes Right at ‘Em", The Los Angeles Times, 22 January 2006: B1 and B16&lt;/ref&gt;

The Association offered students up to $100 for tapes of lectures that show how "radicals" on the faculty are "actively proselytizing their extreme views in the classroom." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060213/wiener "UCLA's Dirty Thirty"], ''The Nation'', 26 January 2006 [online]&lt;/ref&gt; Kellner, named number three; [[Peter McLaren]], also in the School of Education and Information Studies at [[UCLA]], topped the list at number one.

Kellner responded in print&lt;ref&gt;https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/essays/gitlin.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; with the view that the "attack exemplified rightwing interventions within the cultural wars that have raged on campuses since the 1960s."

==Political writing==
Kellner's writing style has been the subject of criticism in the scholarly field, as many of his books are fiercely political.  A ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' review of ''Grand Theft 2000: Media Spectacle and a Stolen Election'' was positive, though it concluded that the book's end result is "somewhat formless and unfocused."  Although the review praised some aspects, notably Kellner's highlighting of some conservative ideological inconsistencies, it lamented that Kellner's "sporadic, underdeveloped discussion of Republicans projecting their own sins onto Democrats is particularly frustrating."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-10162820_ITM "Grand Theft 2000: Media Spectacle and a Stolen Election: Review"], ''Publishers Weekly'', 29 October 2001 [online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kellner received the 2008 American Educational Studies Association (AESA) Critics’ Choice Award for his book ''Guys and Guns Amok: Domestic Terrorism and School Shootings from the Oklahoma City Bombing to the Virginia Tech Massacre''. The book argues that school shootings and other acts of mass violence embody a crisis of out-of-control gun culture and male rage, heightened by a glorification of hypermasculinity and violence in the media.

'''''Du "Cubisme"''''', also written '''''Du Cubisme''''', or '''''Du « Cubisme »''''' (and in English, '''''On Cubism''''' or '''''Cubism'''''), is a book written in 1912 by [[Albert Gleizes]] and [[Jean Metzinger]]. This was the first major text on [[Cubism]], predating ''[[The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations|Les Peintres Cubistes]]'' by [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] (1913). The book is illustrated with black and white photographs of works by [[Paul Cézanne]] (1), Gleizes (5), Metzinger (5), [[Fernand Léger]] (5), [[Juan Gris]] (1), [[Francis Picabia]] (2), [[Marcel Duchamp]] (2), [[Pablo Picasso]] (1), [[Georges Braque]] (1), [[André Derain]] (1), and [[Marie Laurencin]] (2).

The highly influential treatise was published by [[:fr:Eugène Figuière|Eugène Figuière Éditeurs]], Collection "Tous les Arts", Paris, 1912. Prior to publication the book was announced in the ''Revue d'Europe et d'Amérique'', March 1912; for the occasion of the Salon de Indépendants during the spring of 1912 in the ''Gazette des beaux-arts'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k61200690/f393.image ''Les Salons de 1912'', Gazette des beaux-arts, VII, 4eme Périod, April 1912, p. 360], Gallica, Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''Paris-Journal'', October 26, 1912.

==Background==
The collaboration between Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger that would lead to the publication of ''Du "Cubisme"'' began during the aftermath of the 1910 [[Salon d'Automne]].&lt;ref name="Brooke, On Cubism" /&gt; At this massive Parisian exhibition, renowned for displaying the latest and most radical artistic tendencies, several artists including Gleizes, and in particular Metzinger, stood out from the rest. The utilization of a non-conventional form of geometry had permeated the works of these artists who ''a priori'' had little or no contact between one another.

In a review of the 1910 Salon d'Automne the poet [[:fr:Roger Allard|Roger Allard]] (1885-1961) announced the appearance of a new school of French painters who—in contrast with [[Fauvism|Les Fauves]] and [[Neo-Impressionism|Neo-Impressionists]]—concentrated their attention on form rather than on color. A group formed following the exhibition that would include Gleizes, Metzinger, [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Fernand Léger]], and [[Robert Delaunay]] (a friend and associate of Metzinger since 1906). They convened regularly at the studio of le Fauconnier where he worked on his ambitious allegorical painting entitled ''L'Abondance''. "In this painting" writes Brooke, "the simplification of the representational form gives way to a new complexity in which foreground and background are united and the subject of the painting obscured by a network of interlocking geometrical elements".&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/chronology Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953'']&lt;/ref&gt; But it was Metzinger, a ''[[Montmartre|Montmartrois]]'' in close contact with [[Le Bateau-Lavoir]] and its habitués—including [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Max Jacob]], [[Maurice Princet]], [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]]—who introduced to Gleizes and the others of the group, with his ''[[Nu à la cheminée]] (Nu)'', 1910, an extreme species of 'analytic' Cubism (a term that would emerge years later to describe the 1910-1911 works of Picasso and Braque).

A few months later, during the spring of 1911 at the [[Salon des Indépendants]], the term "Cubisme" (derived by critics' attempts to  derogatorily ridicule the "geometrical follies" that gave a "cubic" appearance to their work) would officially be introduced to the public in relation to these artists exhibiting in the 'Salle 41', which included Gleizes, Metzinger, Le Fauconnier, Léger, and Delaunay (but not Picasso or Braque, both absent from public exhibitions at the time resulting from a contract with the [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler|Kahnweiler]] gallery).&lt;ref name="Brooke, On Cubism" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/51056.html Michael Taylor, 2010, Philadelphia Museum of Art, Jean Metzinger, ''Tea Time (Woman with a Teaspoon)'', 1 Audio Stop 439, Podcast]&lt;/ref&gt;

A seminal text written by Metzinger titled ''Note sur la peinture'', published during the fall of 1910, closely coinciding with Salon d'Automne, cites Picasso, Braque, Delaunay and Le Fauconnier as painters who were realising a 'total emancipation' ['affranchissement fondementale'] of painting.&lt;ref name="Brooke, On Cubism" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean Metzinger, October–November 1910, "Note sur la peinture" Pan: 60&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of moving around an object in order to see it from different view-points later treated in ''Du "Cubisme"'' was a central idea of Metzinger's ''Note sur la Peinture''. Indeed, prior to Cubism painters worked from the limiting factor of a single view-point. Metzinger enunciated for the first time in ''Note sur la peinture'' the stimulating interest in representing objects as remembered from successive and subjective experiences within the context of both space and time. In that article, Metzinger notes that Braque and Picasso "discarded traditional perspective and granted themselves the liberty of moving around objects." This is the concept of "mobile perspective" that would tend towards the representation of the "total image"; a series of ideas that still today define the fundamental characteristics of Cubist art.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;Daniel Robbins, ''Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 9-23&lt;/ref&gt;

Setting the stage for ''Du "Cubisme"'', Metzinger's ''Note sur la peinture'' not only highlighted the works of Picasso and Braque, on the one hand, Le Fauconnier and Delaunay on the other. It was also a tactical selection that highlighted the fact that only Metzinger himself was positioned to write about all four. Metzinger, uniquely, had been closely acquainted with the Montmartre group (gallery cubists) and the burgeoning Salon Cubists simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=o3vSvh8CytIC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=gleizes+baigneuses&amp;hl=en&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=gleizes%20baigneuses&amp;f=false David Cottington, ''Cubism in the Shadow of War: The Avant-Garde and Politics in Paris, 1905-1914'', Yale University Press, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Section d'Or==
{{main article|Section d'Or}}
The Salon de la [[Section d'Or]] was an exhibition organized by the Salon Cubists with the goal of bringing together all the most radical trends in painting and sculpture to date. Scheduled to take place at the Galerie La Boétie in Paris, October 1912, directly after the Salon d'Automne. Gleizes and Metzinger, in preparation for the Salon de la Section d'Or, published ''Du "Cubisme"'', a major defense of Cubism, resulting in the first theoretical essay on the new movement; predating ''[[The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations|Les Peintres Cubistes, Méditations Esthétiques (The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations)]]'' by [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] (1913) and ''Der Weg zum Kubismus'' by Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler (1920).&lt;ref name="Du Cubism, Herbert"&gt;[http://www.learn.columbia.edu/monographs/picmon/pdf/art_hum_reading_46.pdf From ''Du Cubisme'', Paris, 1912, pp. 9-11, 13-14, 17-21, 25-32.

Before [[World War I]] the image of Cubism in France and abroad was founded on an extremely broad definition. "A more heterogeneous view of Cubism is certainly encouraged by the earliest promotional writings by its practitioners and associates", writes art historian Christopher Green:

:Picasso, Braque and Gris made almost no published statements on the subject before 1914. The first major text, ''Du cubisme'', was produced by two 'Salle 41' Cubists, Gleizes and Metzinger, in 1912; this was followed in 1913 by a far from systematic collection of reflections and commentaries by the poet and critic Guillaume Apollinaire, who had been closely involved with Picasso (from 1905) and Braque (from 1907), but who gave as much attention to artists such as Delaunay, Picabia and Duchamp. Along with Léger he identified these three with a new tendency, which he labelled Orphic Cubism or Orphism and which he considered of special significance for the future. Painters such as Gleizes, Metzinger, Delaunay and Duchamp were powerful influences alongside Picasso, Braque, Gris and Léger in the development of art related to Cubism in Russia, Czechoslovakia, Italy, the Netherlands, Britain, Spain and the USA.&lt;ref name="Green, MoMA"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020541#skipToContent Christopher Green, ''Cubism, Origins and application of the term'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Salon d’Automne of 1912 led to a debate on Cubism in the Chambre des Députés: since the exhibition was held in the State’s [[Grand Palais]], the State was seen as subsidizing Cubism. It was against this background of public anger and revolt that Gleizes and Metzinger wrote ''Du "Cubisme"''. It was not solely an initiative to explain the new art, but an attempt to persuade the masses that their intentions were genuine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020542#skipToContent Christopher Green, ''Cubism, Cubist milieux: Kahnweiler’s Cubists and the Salon Cubists'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'Salle 41' Cubists, through Gleizes, were closely associated with the [[Abbaye de Créteil]]; a group of writers and artists that included [[Alexandre Mercereau]], [[Jules Romains]], [[:fr:Georges Chennevière|Georges Chennevière]], [[:fr:Henri-Martin Barzun|Henri-Martin Barzun]], [[Pierre Jean Jouve]], [[Georges Duhamel]], [[:fr:Luc Durtain|Luc Durtain]], [[Charles Vildrac]] and [[:fr:René Arcos|René Arcos]]. Many were interested in notion of 'duration' proposed by the philosopher [[Henri Bergson]], according to which life is experienced subjectively as a continual movement in the direction of time, with the past flowing into the present and the present merging into the future. Other Cubists showed affinities with this concept, and to Bergson’s insistence on the 'elasticity' of our consciousness in both time and space.&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020544#skipToContent Christopher Green, ''Cubism, Meanings and interpretations'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Neo-Symbolist writers Jacques Nayral and [[:fr:Henri-Martin Barzun|Henri-Martin Barzun]] associated with the [[Unanimism|Unanimist movement]] in poetry. In his capacity as Figuière's editorial assistant Nayral had selected for publishing ''Du "Cubisme"'' and ''Les Peintres Cubistes'' as part of a projected series on the arts. These writers and other [[Symbolism (art)|Symbolists]] valued expression and subjective experience over an objective view of the physical world, embracing an antipositivist or antirationalist perspective.&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten"&gt;[http://eres.lndproxy.org/edoc/AH317Antliff-09.pdf Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, ''Cubism and Culture'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Du "Cubisme"'' Gleizes and Metzinger explicitly related the concept of 'multiple perspective' to the Bergsonian sense of time. The faceted treatment of physical objects and space blurred the distinctions (by means of 'passage') between subject and abstraction, between representation and non-objectivity. Effects of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] were used to convey a [[Psychophysics|psychophysical]] sense of fluidity of consciousness. These preoccupations are in tune with [[Jules Romains]]’ theory of [[Unanimism]], which stresses the importance of collective feelings in the breaking down of barriers between people.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;

One major innovation made by Gleizes and Metzinger was the inclusion of the concept of [[simultaneity]] into not just the theoretical framework of Cubism, but into the physical paintings themselves. It was in part a concept born out of a conviction based on their understanding of [[Henri Poincaré]] and Bergson that the separation or distinction between space and time should be comprehensively challenged. New philosophical and scientific ideas were emerging based on [[non-Euclidean geometry]], [[Riemannian geometry]] and the [[Relativism|relativity of knowledge]], contradicting notions of [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute truth]]. These ideas were disseminated and debated in widely available publications, and read by writers and artists associated with the advent of Cubism.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten" /&gt;

Poincaré postulated that the laws believed to govern matter were created solely by the minds that 'understood' them and that no theory could be considered 'true'. "The things themselves are not what science can reach..., but only the relations between things. Outside of these relations there is no knowable reality", Poincaré wrote in his 1902 ''Science and Hypothesis''.

==Passages from ''Du "Cubisme"''==
Metzinger and Gleizes wrote with reference to [[non-Euclidean geometry]] in ''Du "Cubisme"''. It was argued that Cubism itself was not based on any geometrical theory, but that [[non-Euclidean geometry]] corresponded better than classical, or [[Euclidean geometry]], to what the Cubists were doing. The essential was in the understanding of space other than by the classical method of perspective; an understanding that would include and integrate the fourth dimension with [[3-space]].&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linda Henderson, The Fourth Dimension and NonEuclidean geometry in Modern Art, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

The reconstruction of the ''total image'' was left to the creative intuition of the observer. The spectator now played an active role. Taken at face value, each of the constituent parts (the fragments or facets) are just as important as the whole. Yet, the ''total image'', greater than the sum of the parts of which it is composed, now resides in the mind of the beholder. The dynamism of form implicit or explicit in the quantitative and qualitative properties of the work, set in motion by the artist, could be reassembled and understood in a dynamic process no longer solely restricted to the artist and subject matter.&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten" /&gt;

The concept of observing a subject from different points in space and time simultaneously (multiple or mobile perspective) ''"to seize it from several successive appearances, which fused into a single image, reconstitute in time"'' developed by Metzinger (in his 1911 article ''Cubisme et tradition''&lt;ref&gt;Jean Metzinger, ''Cubisme et tradition'', Paris Journal, August 16, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;) and touched upon in ''Du "Cubisme"'', was not derived from [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]], though it was certainly influenced in a similar way, through the work of [[Jules Henri Poincaré]] (particularly Science and Hypothesis). Poincaré's writings, unlike Einstein's, were well known leading up to 1912. Poincaré's widely read book, ''[[La Science et l'Hypothèse]]'', was published in 1902 (by Flammarion).

Gleizes and Metzinger render homage to Cézanne in their 1912 Cubist manifesto ''Du "Cubisme"'':

:To understand Cézanne is to foresee Cubism. Henceforth we are justified in saying that between this school and previous manifestations there is only a difference of intensity, and that in order to assure ourselves of this we have only to study the methods of this realism, which, departing from the superficial reality of Courbet, plunges with Cézanne into profound reality, growing luminous as it forces the unknowable to retreat. (Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes, 1912)&lt;ref name="Du Cubism, Herbert" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, ''Du "Cubisme"'', Edition Figuière, Paris, 1912 (First English edition: Cubism, T. Fisher Unwin, London, 1913)&lt;/ref&gt;

For Metzinger and Gleizes, Cubism was nothing less than an extension of a tradition in painting:

:Some maintain that such a tendency distorts the curve of tradition. Do they derive their arguments from the future or the past? The future does not belong to them, as far as we are aware, and one be singularly ingenuous to seek to measure that which exists by that which exists no longer.

:Unless we are to condemn all modern painting, we must regard cubism as legitimate, for it continues modern methods, and we should see in it the only conception of pictorial art now possible. In other words, at this moment cubism is painting."&lt;ref name="Du Cubism, Herbert" /&gt;

The artist endeavours to enclose the unmeasurable sum of the affinities perceived between the visible manifestation and the tendency of his mind, write Metzinger and Gleizes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let the picture imitate nothing; let it nakedly present its ''raison d'être''. We should indeed be ungrateful were we to deplore the absence of all those things flowers, or landscape, or faces whose mere reflection it might have been. Nevertheless, let us admit that the reminiscence of natural forms cannot be absolutely banished; not yet, at all events. An art cannot be raised to the level of a pure effusion at the first step.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

This is understood by the cubist painters, who indefatigably study pictorial form and the space which it engenders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

This space we have negligently confounded with pure visual space or with Euclidian space. Euclid, in one of his postulates, speaks of the indeformability of figures in movement, so we need not
insist upon this point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

If we wished to relate the space of the [Cubist] painters to geometry, we should have to refer it to the non-Euclidean mathematicians; we should have to study, at some length, certain of Riemann's theorems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

As for visual space, we know that it results from the agreement of the sensations of convergence and "accommodation" in the eye.&lt;ref name="Du Cubism, Herbert" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The convergence of classical perspective to evoke depth is treated in ''Du "Cubisme"'' as an illusion. "Moreover, we know that even the most serious infractions of the rules of perspective by no means detract from the spatiality of a painting. The Chinese painters evoke space, although they exhibit a strong partiality for ''divergence''."

&lt;blockquote&gt;To establish pictorial space, we must have recourse to tactile and motor sensations, indeed to all our faculties. It is our whole personality, contracting or dilating, that transforms the plane of the picture. Since in reaction this plane reflects the viewer's personality back upon his understanding, pictorial space may be defined as a sensible passage between two subjective spaces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The forms which are situated within this space spring from a dynamism which we profess to command. In order that our intelligence may possess it, let us first exercise our sensibility. There are only ''nuances''; form appears endowed with properties identical with those of colour. It can be tempered or augmented by contact with another form; it can be destroyed or emphasized; it is multiplied or it disappears. An ellipse may change its circumference because it is inscribed in a polygon. A form which is more emphatic than the surrounding forms may govern the whole picture, may imprint its own effigy upon everything. Those picture-makers who minutely imitate one or two leaves in order that all the leaves of a tree may seem to be painted, show in a clumsy fashion that they suspect this truth. An illusion, perhaps, but we must take it into account. The eye quickly interests the mind in its errors. These analogies and contrasts are capable of all good and all evil; the masters felt this when they tried to compose with pyramids, crosses, circles, semicircles, etc.&lt;ref name="Du Cubism, Herbert" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Cubists, according to the 1912 manifesto written by Gleizes and Mtezinger, revealed a new manner of regarding light:

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to them, to illuminate is to reveal; to colour is to specify the mode of revelation. They call luminous that which strikes the imagination, and dark that which the imagination has to penetrate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

We do not mechanically connect the sensation of white with the idea of light, any more than we connect the sensation of black with the idea of darkness. We admit that a black jewel, even if of a dead black, may be more luminous than the white or pink satin of its case. Loving light, we refuse to measure it, and we avoid the geometrical ideas of the focus and the ray, which imply the repetition-contrary to the principle of variety which guides us-of bright planes and sombre intervals in a given direction. Loving colour, we refuse to limit it, and subdued or dazzling, fresh or muddy, we accept all the possibilities contained between the two extreme points of the spectrum, between the cold and the warm tone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Here are a thousand tints which issue from the prism, and hasten to range themselves in the lucid region forbidden to those who are blinded by the immediate...&lt;ref name="Du Cubism, Herbert" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are two methods of regarding the division of the canvas, in addition to the inequality of parts being granted as a prime condition. Both methods are based on the relationship between color and form:

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to the first, all the parts are connected by a rhythmic convention which is determined by one of them. This—its position on the canvas matters little—gives the painting a centre from which the gradations of colour proceed, or towards which they tend, according as the maximum or minimum of intensity resides there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

According to the second method, in order that the spectator, himself free to establish unity, may apprehend all the elements in the order assigned to them by creative intuition, the properties of each portion must be left independent, and the plastic continuum must be broken into a thousand surprises of light and shade. [...]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Every inflection of form is accompanied by a modification of colour, and every modification of colour gives birth to a form.&lt;ref name="Du Cubism, Herbert" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gleizes and Metzinger continue:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is nothing real outside ourselves; there is nothing real except the coincidence of a sensation and an individual mental direction. Far be it from us to throw any doubts upon the existence of the objects which strike our senses; but, rationally speaking, we can only have certitude with regard to the images which they produce in the mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

It therefore amazes us when well-meaning critics try to explain the remarkable difference between the forms attributed to nature and those of modern painting by a desire to represent things not as they appear, but as they are. As they are! How are they, what are they? According to them, the object possesses an absolute form, an essential form, and we should suppress chiaroscuro and traditional perspective in order to present it. What simplicity! An object has not one absolute form; it has many. It has as many as there are planes in the region of perception. What these writers say is marvelously applicable to geometrical form. Geometry is a science; painting is an art. The geometer measures; the painter savours. The absolute of the one is necessarily the relative of the other; if logic takes fright at this idea, so much the worse! Will logic ever prevent a wine from being different in the retort of the chemist and in the glass of the drinker?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

We are frankly amused to think that many a novice may perhaps pay for his too literal comprehension of the remarks of one cubist, and his faith in the existence of an Absolute Truth, by painfully juxtaposing the six faces of a cube or the two ears of a model seen in profile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Does it ensue from this that we should follow the example of the impressionists and rely upon the senses alone? By no means. We seek the essential, but we seek it in our personality and not in a sort of eternity, laboriously divided by mathematicians and philosophers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Moreover, as we have said, the only difference between the impressionists and ourselves is a difference of intensity, and we do not wish it to be otherwise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

There are as many images of an object as there are eyes which look at it; there are as many essential images of it as there are minds which comprehend it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

But we cannot enjoy in isolation; we wish to dazzle others with that which we daily snatch from the world of sense, and in return we wish others to show us their trophies. From a reciprocity of concessions arise those mixed images, which we hasten to confront with artistic creations in order to compute what they contain of the objective; that is of the purely conventional.&lt;ref name="Du Cubism, Herbert" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==English edition==
Reviewing the English edition, ''Cubism'', [[T. Fisher Unwin]], 1913, a critic in ''The Burlington magazine for Connoisseurs'' writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For the authors of this book "painting is not—or is no longer—the art of imitating an object by means of lines and colours, but the art of giving our instinct a plastic consciousness". Many will follow them so far who will be unable or unwilling to follow them further on the road to cubism. Yet even to the unwilling their book will prove suggestive. Their theory of painting is founded upon a philosophic idealism. It is impossible to paint things "as they are", because it is impossible to know how and what they "really" are. Decoration must go by the board; decorative work is the antithesis of the picture, which "bears its pretext, the reason for its existence, within it". The authors are not afraid of the conclusions which they find resulting from their premisses. The ultimate aim of painting is to touch the crowd; but it is no business of the painter to explain himself to the crowd. On the contrary, it is the business of the crowd to follow the painter in his transubstantiation of the object, "so that the most accustomed eye has some difficulty in discovering it". Yet the authors disapprove of "fantastic occultism" no less than of the negative truth conveyed by the conventional symbols of the academic painters. Indeed, the object of the whole book is to condemn systems of all kinds, and to defend cubism as the liberator from systems, the means of expression of the one truth, which is the truth in the artist's mind. The short but able and suggestive essay is followed by twenty-five half-tone illustrations, from Cézanne to Picabia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/burlingtonmagazi24londuoft#page/354/mode/2up ''Cubism'', Reviews, The Burlington magazine for Connoisseurs, Volume XXIV — October 1913 to March 1914, p. 335]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Ershov numbers''' are used in [[code optimization]] to minimize the amount of [[register allocation]]s. Ershov numbers can be used in methods to optimally select registers when there is only one expression in a code block. Given an expression E = E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''op'' E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the goal is to generate code so as to either minimize the number of registers used, or, if an insufficient number of registers is available, to minimize the number of nonregister temporaries required.

The Ershov number ''n'' of a node in given [[expression tree]] is defined as follows:

# Every leaf has ''n'' = 1.
# For a node with one child, ''n'' is the same as child's.
# For a node with two children, ''n'' is defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;
n = 
\begin{cases}
max(child_1, child_2) &amp; child_1 \ne child_2 \\
child_1 + 1 &amp; child_1 = child_2
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

The Ershov number of a [[Node (graph theory)|node]] represents the minimum number of registers required to evaluate the subexpression whose root is that node.  The idea is that we evaluate the child with the larger Ershov number first, then the other child, then perform the operation at the root.

== Example ==
Suppose we have an expression tree with a '+' operation at the root, and the left and right [[subtree]]s have Ershov numbers of 3 and 4, respectively.  The Ershov number of this node is 4, so we should be able to generate code for the expression using 4 registers.

#  Generate code to evaluate the right child using registers r1, r2, r3, and r4.  Place the result in r1.
#  Generate code to evaluate the left child using registers r2, r3, and r4.  Place the result in r2.
#  Issue the instruction "ADD r1, r2, r1".

===If there are not enough registers available?===
If the Ershov number of the root of the expression tree is greater than the number of registers then the Ershov numbers can be used to generate code using a minimal number of loads and stores, as follows:

# generate code for the child with the larger Ershov number
# issue an instruction to store the result in a temporary
# generate code for the child with the smaller Ershov number
# issue an instruction to load the temporary into a register
# issue an instruction to perform the operation at the root

'''Ethical non-naturalism''' is the [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] view which claims that:
# Ethical [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s express [[proposition]]s.
# Some such propositions are true.
# Those propositions are made true by objective features of the world, independent of human opinion.
# These moral features of the world are ''not'' [[reductionism|reducible]] to any set of non-moral features.

This makes ethical non-naturalism a non-definist form of [[moral realism]], which is in turn a form of [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]]. Ethical non-naturalism stands in opposition to [[ethical naturalism]], which claims that moral terms and properties are reducible to non-moral terms and properties, as well as to all forms of moral [[anti-realism]], including [[ethical subjectivism]] (which denies that moral propositions refer to objective facts), [[error theory]] (which denies that any moral propositions are true), and [[non-cognitivism]] (which denies that moral sentences express propositions at all).

==Definitions and examples==
According to [[G. E. Moore]], "[[goodness and value theory|Goodness]] is a simple, undefinable, non-natural [[property (philosophy)|property]]." To call goodness "non-natural" does not mean that it is [[supernatural]] or [[God|divine]]. It does mean, however, that goodness cannot be reduced to natural properties such as needs, wants or pleasures. Moore also stated that a reduction of ethical properties to a divine command would be the same as stating their naturalness. This would be an example of what he referred to as "the [[naturalistic fallacy]]."

Moore claimed that goodness is "[[definition|indefinable]]", i.e., it cannot be defined in any other terms. This is the central claim of non-naturalism. Thus, the meaning of sentences containing the word "good" cannot be explained entirely in terms of sentences not containing the word "good." One cannot substitute words referring to [[pleasure]], needs or anything else in place of "good."

Some properties, such as hardness, roundness and dampness, are clearly natural properties. We encounter them in the real world and can [[perception|perceive]] them. On the other hand, other properties, such as being good and being right, are not so obvious. A great novel is considered to be a good thing; goodness may be said to be a property of that novel. Paying one's debts and telling the truth are generally held to be right things to do; rightness may be said to be a property of certain human [[Action theory (philosophy)|action]]s.

However, these two types of property are quite different. Those natural properties, such as hardness and roundness, can be perceived and encountered in the real world. On the other hand, it is not immediately clear how to physically see, touch or measure the goodness of a novel or the rightness of an action.

==A difficult question==
Moore did not consider goodness and rightness to be natural properties, i.e., they cannot be defined in terms of any natural properties. How, then, can we know that anything is good and how can we distinguish good from bad? 

Moral epistemology, the part of epistemology (and/or ethics) that studies how we know moral facts and how moral beliefs are justified, has proposed an answer. British epistemologists, following Moore, suggested that humans have a special [[Aptitude|faculty]], a faculty of moral [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], which tells us what is good and bad, right and wrong. 

[[ethical intuitionism|Ethical intuitionists]] assert that, if we see a good person or a right action, and our faculty of moral intuition is sufficiently developed and unimpaired, we simply intuit that the person is good or that the action is right. Moral intuition is supposed to be a [[mental process]] different from other, more familiar faculties like sense-perception, and that moral judgments are its outputs. When someone judges something to be good, or some action to be right, then the person is using the faculty of moral intuition. The faculty is attuned to those non-natural properties. Perhaps the best ordinary notion that approximates moral intuition would be the idea of a [[conscience]].

==Another argument for non-naturalism==
Moore also introduced what is called the [[open-question argument]], a position he later rejected. 

Suppose a definition of "good" is "pleasure-causing." In other words, if something is good, it causes pleasure; if it causes pleasure, then it is, by definition, good. Moore asserted, however, that we could always ask, "But are pleasure-causing things good?" This would always be an open question. There is no foregone conclusion that, indeed, pleasure-causing things are good. 
In his initial argument, Moore concluded that any similar definition of goodness could be criticized in the same way.

[[File:St-thomas-aquinas.jpg|thumb|236px&lt;!--(approx Sidebar/Infobox)--&gt;|St. Thomas Aquinas, the 13th-century [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]] and theologian who formalised the "Five Ways" intended to demonstrate [[Existence of God|God's existence]].]]
{{Thomism |main}}

The '''''Quinque viæ''''' ([[Latin]] "'''Five Ways'''") (sometimes called "five proofs") are five [[logical argument]]s regarding the [[existence of God]] summarized by the 13th-century [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] philosopher and theologian [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] in his book ''[[Summa Theologica]]''. They are:

#the [[cosmological argument|argument from "motion"]];
#the [[Cosmological argument#Argument from causation|argument from causation]];
#the [[Cosmological argument#Argument from contingency|argument from contingency]];
#the [[argument from degree]];
#the [[teleological argument|argument from final cause or ends]] ("[[teleology|teleological]] argument").

Aquinas expands the first of these –&amp;nbsp;God as the "unmoved mover"&amp;nbsp;– in his ''[[Summa Contra Gentiles]]''.&lt;ref name="SCG I.13"&gt;{{cite web|title=Contra Gentiles I.13|url=http://dhspriory.org/thomas/ContraGentiles1.htm#13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
===Need for demonstration of the existence of God===
Aquinas did not think the finite human mind could know what God is directly, therefore God's existence is not self-evident to us.&lt;ref name="ST I.2.1"&gt;''ST'', I, Q 2, A 1 ([http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/sth1002.html#28299 Latin] and [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article1 English])&lt;/ref&gt;

So instead the proposition ''God exists'' must be "demonstrated" from God's effects, which are more known to us.&lt;ref name="ST I.2.2"&gt;''ST'', I, Q 2, A 2 ([http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/sth1002.html#28307 Latin] and [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article2 English])&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of each argument, Aquinas' concept of God has only minimal content which he fleshes out through the rest of the ''Summa theologiciae''. For example, the general question of whether "God" has a body or is composed of matter is answered in question three, immediately following the Five Ways.&lt;ref name="ST I.4-26"&gt;{{cite web|title=''ST'' I, Q 4-26|url=http://newadvent.org/summa/1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Aquinas did not hold that what could be demonstrated philosophically (i.e. as [[general revelation]]) would necessarily provide any of the vital details revealed in Christ and through the Church (i.e. as [[special revelation]]), quite the reverse. For example, while he would allow that ''in all creatures there is found the trace of the Trinity'' yet ''a trace shows that someone has passed by but not who it is.''&lt;ref name="ST I.45-7"&gt;{{cite web|title=''ST'' I, Q 45-7|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1045.htm#article7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Categorization===
All five ways are generally considered to be [[cosmological argument]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Online Encyclopaedia Britannica[https://www.britannica.com/topic/philosophy-of-religion#ref280013 "Philosophy of religion"], 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquinas omitted various arguments he believed to be insufficient or unsuited, such as the [[Proslogion|ontological argument]] made by [[Anselm of Canterbury|St. Anselm of Canterbury]].

===Source===
A summary version of the Five Ways is given in the ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa theologiciae]]''&lt;ref name="ST I.2.3"&gt;''ST'', I, Q 2, A 3 ([http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/sth1002.html#28315 Latin] and [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article3 English])&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Summa'' uses the form of [[Scholasticism#Scholastic instruction|scholastic disputation]] (i.e. a literary form based on a lecturing method: a question is raised, then the most serious objections are summarized, then a correct answer is provided in that context, then the objections are answered), and the Five Ways follow [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/demonstration-medieval/  Medieval Theories of Demonstration].

A subsequent, more detailed, treatment of the Five Ways can be found in the ''[[Summa contra gentiles]]''.&lt;ref name="SCG I.13"/&gt; Aquinas further elaborated each of the Five Ways in more detail in passing in multiple books.
===Essential and Accidental Causal Chains===
The first two Ways relate to causation. When Aquinas argues that a causal chain cannot be infinitely long, he does not have in mind a chain where each element is a prior event that causes the next event; in other words, he is not arguing for a first event in a sequence. Rather, his argument is that a chain of ''concurrent'' or ''simultaneous'' effects must be rooted ultimately in a cause capable of generating these effects, and hence for a cause that is first in the hierarchical sense, not the temporal sense.&lt;ref name="IEP aq-ph-th SH2b"&gt;{{cite web |title=Aquinas: Philosophical Theology 2.b. |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aq-ph-th/#SH2b |last=Floyd |first=Shawn |ISSN=2161-0002 |website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Aquinas follows the distinction found in Aristotle's  ''[[Physics_(Aristotle)|Physics]]'' 8.5, and developed by Simplicius, Maimonides, and Avicenna that a causal chain may be either [[Accident_(philosophy)|accidental]] (Socrates' father caused Socrates, Socrates' grandfather caused Socrates' father, but Socrates' grandfather only accidentally caused Socrates) or essential (a stick is moving a stone, because a hand is simultaneously moving the stick, and thus [[Transitive_relation|transitively]] the hand is moving the stone.)&lt;ref name="ICR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Infinite Causal Regress and the Secunda Via in the Thought of Thomas Aquinas|url=http://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1065&amp;context=sor_fac_pubs}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Quote|title=The First Cause Argument Misunderstood|author="Agellius" (paraphrasing Fesser)|text=An accidental series of causes is one in which the earlier causes need no longer exist in order for the series to continue. ... An essential series of causes is one in which the first, and every intermediate member of the series, must continue to exist in order for the causal series to continue as such.[https://agellius.wordpress.com/2012/05/02/the-first-cause-argument-misunderstood/]}}

His thinking here relies on what would later be labelled "essentially ordered causal series" by [[Duns Scotus|John Duns Scotus]].&lt;ref name="SEP duns-scotus ProExiGod"&gt;{{cite web |title=John Duns Scotus 2.2. |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/duns-scotus/#ProExiGod |year=2016 |last=Williams |first=Thomas |ISSN=1095-5054 |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In Duns Scotus, it is a causal series in which the immediately observable elements are not capable of generating the effect in question, and a cause capable of doing so is inferred at the far end of the chain. ''Ordinatio'' I.2.43&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.logicmuseum.com/wiki/Authors/Duns_Scotus/Ordinatio/Ordinatio_I/D2/Q2B Duns Scotus – Ordinatio I/D2/Q2B] logicmuseum.com&lt;/ref&gt;) 

This is also why Aquinas rejected that reason can prove the universe must have had a beginning in time; for all he knows and can demonstrate the universe could have been 'created from eternity' by the eternal God.&lt;ref name="SCG II.38"&gt;{{cite web|title=Contra Gentiles II.38|url=http://dhspriory.org/thomas/ContraGentiles2.htm#38}}&lt;/ref&gt; He accepts the biblical 
doctrine of creation as a truth of faith, not reason.&lt;ref name="ICR"/&gt;

For a discussion of a causal chain argument that is based on a created beginning, see [[Kalam cosmological argument]].

==The Five Ways==
===Prima Via: The Argument of the Unmoved Mover===

====Summary====
In the world, we can see that at least some things are changing. Whatever is changing is being changed by something else. If that by which it is changing is itself changed, then it too is being changed by something else. But this chain [[Regressus ad infinitum|cannot be infinitely long]], so there must be something that causes change without itself changing. This everyone understands to be God.&lt;ref name="ST I.2.3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cople 2009 341-342"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Copleston|first1=Frederick|title=Medieval philosophy : [from Augustine to Duns Scotus].|year=1993|publisher=Image Books, Doubleday|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=038546844X|pages=341–342|edition=[Repr.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Explanation====
Aquinas uses the term "motion" in his argument, but by this he understands any kind of "change", more specifically a transit from [[Potentiality and actuality|potentiality to actuality]].&lt;ref name="IEP aris-mot"&gt;{{cite web |title=Aristotle: Motion and its Place in Nature |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-mot/ |last=Sachs |first=Joe |ISSN=2161-0002 |website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since a potential does not yet exist, it cannot cause itself to exist and can therefore only be brought into existence by something already existing.&lt;ref name="SCG I.13"/&gt; 

===Secunda Via: The Argument of the First Cause===
====Summary====
In the world, we can see that things are caused. But it is not possible for something to be the cause of itself because this would entail that it exists prior to itself, which is a contradiction. If that by which it is caused is ''itself'' caused, then it too must have a cause. But this cannot be an infinitely long chain, so, there must be a cause which is not itself caused by anything further. This everyone understands to be God.&lt;ref name="Cople 2009 341-342" /&gt;

====Explanation====
As in the First Way, the causes Aquinas has in mind are not sequential events, but rather simultaneously existing dependency relationships: Aristotle's [[Four causes#Efficient cause|efficient cause]]. For example, plant growth depends on sunlight, which depends on gravity, which depends on mass.&lt;ref name="IEP aq-ph-th SH2b" /&gt; Aquinas is not arguing for a cause that is first in a sequence, but rather first in a hierarchy: a principal cause, rather than a derivative cause.&lt;ref name="Feser CrossOnScotusOnCausalSeries"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cross on Scotus on causal series|last=Feser|first=Edward|year=2015|url=http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2015/06/cross-on-scotus-on-causal-series.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tertia Via: The Argument from Contingency===

====Summary====
In the world we see things that are possible to be and possible not to be. In other words, perishable things. But if everything were contingent and thus capable of going out of existence, then, given infinite time, this possibility would be realized and nothing would exist now. But things clearly do exist now. Therefore, there must be something that is imperishable: a necessary being. This everyone understands to be God.&lt;ref name="ST I.2.3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cople 2009 341-342" /&gt;

====Explanation====
The argument begins with the observation that things around us come into and go out of existence: animals die, buildings are destroyed, etc. But if ''everything'' were like this, then, at some time nothing would exist. Some interpreters read Aquinas to mean that assuming an infinite past, all possibilities would be realized and everything would go out of existence. Since this is clearly not the case, then there must be at least one thing that does not have the possibility of going out of existence.&lt;ref name="Cople 2009 341-342"/&gt; However, this explanation seems to involve the fallacy of composition (quantifier shift). Moreover, it does not seem to be in keeping with Aquinas' principle that, among natural things, the destruction of one thing is always the generation of another.&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on De Anima, Bk. 2, lect. 1, n.16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, one could read Aquinas to be arguing as follows: if there is eternal change, so that things are eternally being generated and corrupted, and since an eternal effect requires an eternal cause (just as a necessary conclusion requires necessary premises), then there must exist an eternal agent which can account for the eternity of generation and corruption.  To hold the alternative, namely that an infinite series of contingent causes would be able to explain eternal generation and corruption would posit a circular argument: Why is there eternal generation and corruption? Because there is an eternal series of causes which are being generated and corrupted. And why is there an infinite series of causes which are being generated and corrupted? Because there is eternal generation and corruption. Since such an explanation is not acceptable, there must be (at least one) eternal and necessary being.

===Quarta Via: The Argument from Degree===

====Summary====
We see things in the world that vary in degrees of goodness, truth, nobility, etc. For example, sick animals and healthy animals, and well-drawn circles as well as poorly drawn ones. But judging something as being "more" or "less" implies some standard against which it is being judged. Therefore, there is something which is goodness itself, and this everyone understands to be God.&lt;ref name="Cople 2009 341-342" /&gt;

====Explanation====
The argument is rooted in Aristotle and Plato but its developed form is found in Anselm's Monologion.&lt;ref name="IEP anselm ArgMon"&gt;{{cite web|title=Saint Anselm 2.2.|author=Williams, Thomas|year=2016|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/anselm/#ArgMon |issn=2161-0002|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Monologium"&gt;{{cite web|title=Monologion|author=Anselm|url=http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/anselm-monologium.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the argument has Platonic influences, Aquinas was not a Platonist and did not believe in the Theory of Forms. Rather, he is arguing that things that only have partial or flawed existence indicate that they are not their own sources of existence, and so must rely on something else as the source of their existence.&lt;ref name="Feser Aquinas p99-109"&gt;{{cite book|author=Feser, Edward|pages=99–109|title=Aquinas : a beginner's guide|year=2009|publisher=Oneworld|location=Oxford|isbn=9781851686902}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument makes use of the theory of [[transcendentals]]: properties of existence. For example, "true" presents an aspect of existence, as any existent thing will be "true" insofar as it is true that it exists. Or "one," insofar as any existent thing will be (at least) "one thing."&lt;ref name="SEP Goris transcendentals"&gt;{{cite web|title=Medieval Theories of the Transcendentals|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2013/entries/transcendentals-medieval/|author1=Goris, Wouter|last2=Aertsen |first2=Jan|year=2013|issn=1095-5054|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quinta Via: Argument from Final Cause or Ends ===

====Summary====
We see various non-intelligent objects in the world behaving in regular ways. This cannot be due to chance since then they would not behave with predictable results. So their behavior must be set. But it cannot be set by themselves since they are non-intelligent and have no notion of how to set behavior. Therefore, their behavior must be set by something else, and by implication something that must be intelligent. This everyone understands to be God.&lt;ref name="Cople 2009 341-342" /&gt;

====Explanation====
This is also known as the [[Teleological Argument]]. However, it is not a "Cosmic Watchmaker" [[argument from design]] (see below). Instead, as the 1920 Dominican translation puts it, ''The fifth way is taken from the governance of the world''[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article3].

The Fifth Way uses Aristotle's [[Four causes#End|final cause]]. Aristotle argued that a complete explanation of an object will involve knowledge of how it came to be (efficient cause), what material it consists of (material cause), how that material is structured (formal cause), and the specific behaviors associated with the type of thing it is (final cause).&lt;ref name="SEP Falcon aristotle-causality FouCau"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aristotle on Causality 2.|author=Falcon, Andrea|year=2015|issn=1095-5054|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/aristotle-causality/#FouCau|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of final causes involves the concept of dispositions or "ends": a specific goal or aim towards which something strives. For example, acorns regularly develop into oak trees but never into sea lions. The oak tree is the "end" towards which the acorn "points," its disposition, even if it fails to achieve maturity. The aims and goals of intelligent beings is easily explained by the fact that they consciously set those goals for themselves. The implication is that if something has a goal or end towards which it strives, it is either because it is intelligent or because something intelligent is guiding it.&lt;ref name="Feser Aquinas p110-120"&gt;{{cite book|author=Feser, Edward|pages=110–120|title=Aquinas : a beginner's guide|year=2009|publisher=Oneworld|location=Oxford|isbn=9781851686902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It must be emphasized that this argument is distinct from the design argument associated with [[William Paley]] and the [[Intelligent Design]] movement. The latter implicitly argue that objects in the world ''do not'' have inherent dispositions or ends, but, like Paley's watch, will not naturally have a purpose unless forced to do some outside agency.&lt;ref name="Feser Aquinas p110-120"/&gt; The latter also focus on complexity and interworking parts as the effect needing explanation, whereas the Fifth Way takes as its starting point ''any'' regularity.&lt;ref name="Feser Aquinas p110-120"/&gt; (E.g., that an eye has a complicated function therefore a design therefore a designer) but an argument from final cause (e.g., that the pattern that things exist with a purpose itself allows us to recursively arrive at God as the ultimate source of purpose without being constrained by any external purpose).

==Proofs or Ways?==
Many scholars and commenters caution in treating the Five Ways as if they were modern logical proofs. This is not to say that examining them in that light is not academically interesting.

Reasons include:
*'''Purpose''': The purpose of the [[Summa theologica]] ''is to help Dominicans not enrolled in the university prepare for their priestly duties of preaching and hearing confessions''[https://arcdigital.media/summa-theologiae-by-thomas-aquinas-fbf190e03e1c] by systematizing Catholic truth utilizing mainly Aristotelean tools.
*'''Precis''': Aquinas subsequently revisited the various arguments of the Five Ways in much greater detail. The simple list in the [[Summa theologica]] is not written to be clear (to a 21st Century reader) and complete, and should be considered a sketch or summary of the idea, suitable for presentation in a lecture or a quick browse.
*'''Via Negativa''': Aquinas held that ''we are unable to apprehend (the Divine substance) by knowing what it is. Yet we are able to have some knowledge of it by knowing what it is not.'' (SCG I.14) Consequently, to understand the Five Ways as Aquinas understood them we must interpret them as [[Negative theology]] that list what God is not (i.e. not a moved mover, not a caused causer, etc.) It invites logical fallacy to use the statements as positive definitions rather than negative exclusions.[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=2VelBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT98&amp;lpg=PT98&amp;dq=probari+demonstrati+in+aquinas&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sFPT8iyOYM&amp;sig=UJ01CAkhX8Xhh6hyhghWPy8c8YA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjkkJbB4fzZAhVCjLwKHZQeDe0Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=probari%20demonstrati%20in%20aquinas&amp;f=false]
*'''Name''': Each Way concludes not with "It is proven" or "therefore God exists" etc., but with a formulation that "this everyone ''understands'' as God" or "to which everyone gives the ''name'' of God" or "this all men ''speak of'' as God" or "this being we ''call'' God" etc. In other words, the Five Ways do not attempt to prove God exists, they attempt to demonstrate what we call God, which is a subtly different thing. Some commentators go as far as saying that ''He did not write them as demonstrations of God’s existence but arguments for something we already accept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=2VelBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT98|author=James, Aaron B.|title=Analogous Uses of Language, Eucharistic Identity, and the 'Baptist' Vision|publisher=[[Lightning Source]]|year=2014|isbn=978-1-84227-8024}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Medieval Science not Epistemology''': ''Demonstration'' in the Medieval Theology of Aquinas comes from Aristotle's [[Posterior Analytics]]: {{Quote|text=A demonstration in Aristotle is a syllogism that produces scientific knowledge. Scientific knowledge is knowledge not simply that something is the case, but why it is the case, what causes bring it about. Perhaps we would do better to call it a scientific understanding of the fact known. This means that one may have cognition that something is true which is quite certain without having scientific knowledge...&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/demonstration-medieval/#1 Aristotle's Posterior Analytics]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
*'''Further Treatments''': In the Question of the [[Summa theologica]]: in Article I, Aquinas finds that the existence of God is not self-evident to humans.  In Article II, he says that the approach of demonstration ''a postiori'' can be used to go trace back to assert the ''a priori'' existence of God. Article III (i.e., the Five Ways) is a summary or application of this approach, but not intended to be complete or exhaustive.  Fuller arguments are taken up in later sections of the Summa theologiae, and other publications. For example, in the [[Summa contra gentiles]] SCG I, 13, 30, he clarifies that his arguments do not assume or presuppose that there was a first moment in time. A commentator even notes that ''Thomas does not think that God could be first in a temporal sense (rather than ontological sense) because God exists outside of time.''[https://www.iep.utm.edu/aquinas/]
*'''Terminology''': In the Summa theologiciae presentation, Aquinas deliberately switched from using the term ''demonstrabile'' (a logical or mathematical proof) to using ''probile'' (an argument or test or proving ground). [https://www.catholic.com/magazine/print-edition/five-ways-or-five-proofs] ''A more accurate translation would be "The existence of God can be argued for in five ways."''  That he deliberately switched terms away from a term used for proof indicates a signal of an intent or nuance.

==Controversy==

===Philosophical===
Criticism of the [[cosmological argument]], and hence the first three Ways, emerged in the 18th century by the philosophers [[David Hume]] and [[Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref name="SEP Reichenbach cosmological-argument"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosmological Argument|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2013/entries/cosmological-argument/|author=Reichenbach, Bruce|year=2013|issn=1095-5054|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant argued that our minds give structure to the raw materials of reality and that the world is therefore divided into the phenomenal world (the world we experience and know), and the [[Noumenon|noumenal]] world (the world as it is "in itself," which we can never know).&lt;ref name="SEP Rohlf kant TraIde"&gt;{{cite web|title=Immanuel Kant 3.|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/kant/#TraIde |author=Rohlf, Michael|year=2016|issn=1095-5054|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the cosmological arguments reason from what we experience, and hence the phenomenal world, to an inferred cause, and hence the noumenal world, since the noumenal world lies beyond our knowledge we can never know what's there.&lt;ref name="Koons lec9"&gt;{{cite web|title=Critique of the Cosmological Argument: Kant|url=http://www.leaderu.com/offices/koons/docs/lec9.html|author=Koons, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant also argued that the concept of a necessary being is incoherent, and that the cosmological argument presupposes its coherence, and hence the arguments fail.&lt;ref name="SEP Reichenbach cosmological-argument 3.5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2013/entries/cosmological-argument/#3.5|issn=1095-5054 |title=Cosmological Argument 3.5.|author=Reichenbach, Bruce|year=2013|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume argued that since we can conceive of causes and effects as separate, there is no necessary connection between them and therefore we cannot necessarily reason from an observed effect to an inferred cause.&lt;ref name="SEP Reichenbach cosmological-argument 3.4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2013/entries/cosmological-argument/#3.4|title=Cosmological Argument 3.4.|author=Reichenbach, Bruce|year=2013|issn=1095-5054|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hume also argued that explaining the causes of individual elements explains everything, and therefore there is no need for a cause of the whole of reality.&lt;ref name="Hume Dialogues"&gt;{{cite web|author=Hume, David|title=Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion|url=http://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/dnr.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051122134556/http://www.anselm.edu/homepage/dbanach/dnr.htm|archivedate=2005-11-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SEP Reichenbach cosmological-argument 3.3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2013/entries/cosmological-argument/#3.3|issn=1095-5054|title=Cosmological Argument 3.3.|author=Reichenbach, Bruce|year=2013|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20th-century philosopher of religion [[Richard Swinburne]] argued in his book, ''Simplicity as Evidence of Truth'', that these arguments are only strong when collected together, and that individually each of them is weak.&lt;ref name="Swinburne Simplicity"&gt;{{cite book|author=Swinburne, Richard|title=Simplicity as Evidence of Truth|publisher=Marquette University Press|location=Milwaukee|year=1997|isbn=0-87462-164-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20th-century Catholic priest and philosopher [[Frederick Copleston]] devoted much of his work to a modern explication and expansion of Aquinas' arguments.

More recently the prominent Thomistic philosopher [[Edward Feser]] has argued in his book ''Aquinas: A Beginner’s Guide'' that Dawkins, Hume, Kant, and most modern philosophers do not have a correct understanding of Aquinas at all; that the arguments are often difficult to translate into modern terms.&lt;ref name="Feser Aquinas 2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Feser, Edward|title=Aquinas: A Beginner’s Guide|publisher=Oneworld|location=Oxford|year=2009|isbn=1-85168-690-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular===
Biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] book ''[[The God Delusion]]'' argues against the Five Ways.

In ''Why there almost certainly is a God: Doubting Dawkins'', philosopher [[Keith Ward]] claims that [[Richard Dawkins]] mis-stated the five ways, and thus responds with a [[straw man]]. For example, for the fifth Way, Dawkins places it in the same position for his criticism as the [[Watchmaker analogy]]- when in fact, according to Ward, they are vastly different arguments. Ward defended the utility of the five ways (for instance, on the fourth argument he states that all possible smells must pre-exist in the mind of God, but that God, being by his nature non-physical, does not himself stink) whilst pointing out that they only constitute a proof of God if one first begins with a proposition that the universe can be rationally understood. Nevertheless, he argues that they are useful in allowing us to understand what God will be like given this initial presupposition.&lt;ref name="Ward WhyGod"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ward, Keith|title=Why there almost certainly is a God: Doubting Dawkins|publisher=Lion Hudson|location=Oxford|year=2008|isbn=978-0-7459-5330-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eastern Orthodox]] theologian [[David Bentley Hart]] says that Dawkins "devoted several pages of ''The God Delusion'' to a discussion of the 'Five Ways' of Thomas Aquinas but never thought to avail himself of the services of some scholar of ancient and medieval thought who might have explained them to him ... As a result, he not only mistook the Five Ways for Thomas's comprehensive statement on why we should believe in God, which they most definitely are not, but ended up completely misrepresenting the logic of every single one of them, and at the most basic levels."&lt;ref name="Hart 2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hart, David|title=The Experience of God: Being, Consciousness, Bliss|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|year=2013|pages=21–22|isbn=0-30016-684-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart said of Dawkins treatment of Aquinas' arguments that:
{{quote|Not knowing the scholastic distinction between primary and secondary causality, for instance, [Dawkins] imagined that Thomas's talk of a "first cause" referred to the initial temporal causal agency in a continuous temporal series of discrete causes.  He thought that Thomas's logic requires the universe to have had a temporal beginning, which Thomas explicitly and repeatedly made clear is not the case.  He anachronistically mistook Thomas's argument from universal natural teleology for an argument from apparent "Intelligent Design" in nature.  He thought Thomas's proof from universal "motion" concerned only physical movement in space, "local motion," rather than the ontological movement from potency to act. He mistook Thomas's argument from degrees of transcendental perfection for an argument from degrees of quantitative magnitude, which by definition have no perfect sum. (Admittedly, those last two are a bit difficult for modern persons, but he might have asked all the same.)"&lt;ref name="Hart 2013"/&gt;}}

'''Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg''' (30 November 1802 – 24 January 1872) was a German [[philosopher]] and [[philologist]].

==Life==
He was born at [[Eutin]], near [[Lübeck]]. He was educated at the universities of [[University of Kiel|Kiel]], [[Leipzig University|Leipzig]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]]. He became more and more attracted to the study of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], and his 1826 doctoral dissertation (''Platonis de ideis et numeris doctrina ex Aristotele illustrata''; ''On Plato's Doctrine of Ideas and Numbers as Illustrated by Aristotle'') was an attempt to reach through Aristotle's criticisms a more accurate knowledge of the Platonic philosophy.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He declined the offer of a classical chair at Kiel, and accepted a post as tutor to the son of an intimate friend of [[Karl vom Stein zum Altenstein]], the [[Prussia]]n minister of education. He held this position for seven years (1826–1833), occupying his leisure time with the preparation of a critical edition of Aristotle's ''[[De anima]]'' (1833; 2nd ed. by Christian Belger, 1877). In 1833 Altenstein appointed Trendelenburg extraordinary professor in Berlin, and four years later he was advanced to an ordinary professorship.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Teaching==
For nearly 40 years, he proved himself markedly successful as a teacher, during the greater part of which time he had to examine in philosophy and [[pedagogics]] all candidates for the scholastic profession in Prussia. His teaching method was highly regarded by [[Søren Kierkegaard]] who called him "one of the most sober philosophical [[philologist]]s I know."&lt;ref&gt;''Søren Kierkegaard's Journals and Papers'', V A 98, 1844&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1861.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter T|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterT.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==

===Defense of teleology===
Trendelenburg's philosophizing is conditioned throughout by his loving study of Plato and Aristotle, whom he regards not as opponents but as building jointly on the broad basis of [[idealism]]. His own standpoint may be called a modern version of [[Aristotelianism]]. While denying the possibility of an absolute method and an absolute philosophy, as contended for by  [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and others, Trendelenburg was emphatically an idealist in the ancient or Platonic sense; his whole work was devoted to the demonstration of the ideal in the real. But he maintained that the procedure of philosophy must be analytic, rising from the particular facts to the universal in which we find them explained. We divine the system of the whole from the part we know, but the process of reconstruction must remain approximative. Our position forbids the possibility of a final system. Instead, therefore, of constantly beginning afresh in speculation, it should be our duty to attach ourselves to what may be considered the permanent results of historic developments.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

The classical expression of these results Trendelenburg finds mainly in the Platonico-Aristotelian system. The philosophical question is stated thus: How are thought and being united in knowledge? How does thought get at being? And how does being enter into thought? Proceeding on the principle that like can only be known by like, Trendelenburg next reaches a doctrine peculiar to himself (though based upon Aristotle) that plays a central part in his speculations. Motion is the fundamental fact common to being and thought; the ''actual motion'' of the external world has its counterpart in the ''constructive motion'' involved in every instance of perception or thought. From motion he proceeds to deduce time, space and the categories of mechanics and natural science. These, being thus derived, are at once subjective and objective in their scope. It is true that matter can never be completely resolved into motion, but the irreducible remainder may be treated, like Aristotle, as an abstraction we asymptotically approach but never reach.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

The facts of existence, however, are not adequately explained by the mechanical categories. The ultimate interpretation of the universe can only be found in the higher category of End or final cause. Here Trendelenburg finds the dividing line, between philosophical systems. On the one side stand those that acknowledge none but efficient causes, which make force prior to thought, and explain the universe, as it were, ''a tergo'' ("from the back"). This may be called, typically, [[Democritus|Democritism]]. On the other side stands the organic or [[teleological]] view of the world, which interprets the parts through the idea of the whole, and sees in the efficient causes only the vehicle of ideal ends. This may be called in a wide sense [[Platonism]]. Systems like [[Spinozism]], which seem to form a third class, neither sacrificing force to thought nor thought to force, yet by their denial of final causes inevitably fall back into the Democritic or essentially materialistic standpoint, leaving us with the great antagonism of the mechanical and the organic systems of philosophy. The latter view, which receives its first support in the facts of life, or organic nature as such, finds its culmination and ultimate verification in the ethical world, which essentially consists in the realization of ends.

Trendelenburg's ''Naturrecht'' [the right of nature] may, therefore, be taken as in a manner the completion of his system, his working out of the ideal as present in the real. The ethical end is taken to be the idea of humanity, not in the abstract as formulated by [[Immanuel Kant]], but in the context of the state and of history. Law is treated throughout as the vehicle of ethical requirements. In Trendelenburg's treatment of the [[State (polity)|state]], as the ethical organism in which the individual (the potential man) may be said first to emerge into actuality, we may trace his nurture on the best ideas of Hellenic antiquity.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

===Fischer–Trendelenburg debate&lt;!--'Fischer–Trendelenburg debate' and 'Fischer-Trendelenburg debate' redirect here--&gt;===
In 1865 he became involved in an acrimonious controversy on the interpretation of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s doctrine of space with [[Kuno Fischer]], whom he attacked in ''Kuno Fischer und sein Kant'' (1869), which drew forth the reply ''Anti-Trendelenburg'' (1870).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} The controversy became known in the history of philosophy as the '''Fischer–Trendelenburg debate'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.

Trendelenburg's position on the debate (the position that "Kant may establish that space and time are ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' and intuitive conditions for experience in the "[[Critique of Pure Reason|Transcendental Aesthetic]]," but this in no way entails that space and time have nothing to do with the objects outside of possible experience") has been variously dubbed as "Neglected Alternative," "Trendelenburg's gap" [''die trendelenburgische Lücke''], "Pistorius's gap [''die pistorische Lücke'']" (named after {{Interlanguage link multi|Hermann Andreas Pistorius|de|3=Hermann Andreas Pistorius|lt=Hermann Andreas Pistorius}}), or "third possibility" [''die dritte Möglichkeit''].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew F. Specht, [http://surface.syr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1183&amp;context=etd "Kant and the Neglected Alternative"], December 2014, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
His son, [[Friedrich Trendelenburg]], was a prominent surgeon; several medical techniques and matters are named for him.

==Works (selection)==
Trendelenburg was also the author of the following:

*''Elementa Logices Aristotelicae'' (1836; 9th ed., 1892; Eng. trans. 1881), a selection of passages from the ''[[Organon]]'' with Latin translation and notes, containing the substance of Aristotle's logical doctrine, supplemented by ''Erlauterungen zu den Elementen der Aristotelischen Logik'' (1842; 3rd ed., 1876).
*''Logische Untersuchungen (Logical Investigations)'', 2 vols. (1840; 3rd ed. 1870), and ''Die logische Frage in Hegels System'' (1843), important factors in the reaction against Hegel.
*''Historische Beitrage zur Philosophie'' (1846–1867), in three volumes, the first of which (''Geschichte der Kategorienlehre'') contains a history of the doctrine of the Categories.
*''Geschichte der Kategorienlehre'' I: Aristotle Kategorienlehre; II: Die Kategorienlehre in der Geschichte der Philosophie (1846, reprint: Hildesheim, Olms, 1979).
*''Des Naturrecht aufdem Grunde der Ethik'' (1860).
*''Lücken im Völkerrecht'' (1870), a treatise on the defects of international law, occasioned by the war of 1870.
*''[[Kleine Schriften]]'' (1871), papers dealing with non-philosophical, chiefly national and educational subjects.

{{Spirituality sidebar |western}}

'''German idealism''' (also known as '''post-Kantian idealism''', '''post-Kantian philosophy''', or simply '''post-Kantianism''')&lt;ref&gt;Terry Pinkard, ''German Philosophy 1760-1860: The Legacy of Idealism'', Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[philosophical movement]] that emerged in [[Germany]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It began as a reaction to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]].'' German idealism was closely linked with both [[Romanticism]] and the revolutionary politics of [[the Enlightenment]].

The most notable thinkers in the movement were [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], and the proponents of [[Jena Romanticism]] ([[Friedrich Hölderlin]], [[Novalis]], and [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser]], ''German Idealism: The Struggle Against Subjectivism, 1781-1801'', Harvard University Press, 2002, p. viii: "the young romantics—Hölderlin, Schlegel, Novalis—[were] crucial figures in the development of German idealism."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]], [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze]], [[Karl Leonhard Reinhold]], [[Salomon Maimon]] and [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] also made major contributions.

== Meaning of idealism ==
{{main article|Idealism}}

The word "[[idealism]]" has multiple meanings. The philosophical meaning of idealism is that the properties we discover in objects depend on the way that those objects appear to us, as perceiving subjects. These properties only belong to the perceived appearance of the objects, and not something they possess "in themselves". The notion of a "[[thing in itself]]" should be understood here as an option of a set of functions for an operating mind, such that we consider something that appears without respect to the ''specific manner'' in which it appears. The term "idea-ism" is closer to this intended meaning than the common notion of idealism. The question of what properties a thing might have [[noumena|"independently of the mind"]] is thus unknowable and a moot point, within the idealist tradition.

==History==
{{main|Timeline of German idealism}}
[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s work purported to bridge the two dominant philosophical schools in the 18th century: 1) [[rationalism]], which held that knowledge could be attained by reason alone ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' (prior to experience), and 2) [[empiricism]], which held that knowledge could be arrived at only through the senses ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' (after experience), as expressed by philosopher [[David Hume]], whom Kant sought to rebut&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding German Idealism|last=Dudley|first=Will|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781844653935|location=|pages=3-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Kant's solution was to propose that while we can know, via sensory experience, particular facts about the world (which he termed [[phenomena]]), we cannot know the ''form'' they must take prior to any experience (which he called [[noumena]]). That is, we cannot know ''what'' objects we will encounter, but we can know ''how'' we will encounter them. Kant called his mode of philosophising "[[critical philosophy]]", in that it was supposedly less concerned with setting out positive doctrine than with critiquing the limits to the theories we ''can'' set out.&lt;ref&gt;The German Idealists did not take "&amp;hellip;Kant’s advice that we should not engage with concepts of which we can have no experience (instances of this are Fichte’s Absolute I, Schelling’s Absolute, and Hegel’s Geist)&amp;hellip;." ("Fichte: Kantian or Spinozian? Three Interpretations of the Absolute I," Alexandre Guilherme, ''South African Journal of Philosophy'', 2010, vol. 29 number 1, p. 14)&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion he presented, as above, he called "[[transcendental idealism]]". This distinguished it from [[idealism#Classical idealism|classical idealism]] and [[idealism#Subjective idealism|subjective idealism]] such as [[George Berkeley]]'s, which held that external objects have actual being or real existence only when they are perceived by an observer. Kant said that there are things-in-themselves, noumena, that is, things that exist other than being merely sensations and ideas in our minds. Kant held in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' that the world of appearances (phenomena) is empirically real and transcendentally ideal.  The mind plays a central role in influencing the way that the world is experienced: we perceive phenomena through [[time]], [[space]] and the [[categories of the understanding]]. It is this notion that was taken to heart by Kant's philosophical successors.

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] considered himself to be a [[Transcendental idealism|transcendental idealist]]. In his major work ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' he discusses his indebtedness to Kant, and the work includes Schopenhauer's extensive analysis of the ''Critique''. The [[Young Hegelians]], a number of philosophers who developed Hegel's work in various directions, were in some cases idealists. On the other hand, [[Karl Marx]], who was numbered among them, had professed himself to be a [[materialist]], in opposition to idealism. Another member of the Young Hegelians, [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], advocated for materialism, and his thought was influential in the development of [[historical materialism]],&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Churchich, ''Marxism and Alienation'', Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1990, p. 57: "Although Marx has rejected Feuerbach's abstract materialism," Lenin says that Feuerbach's views "are consistently materialist," implying that Feuerbach's conception of causality is entirely in line with dialectical materialism."&lt;/ref&gt; where he is often recognized as a bridge between Hegel and Marx.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Van A., "Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach", ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Winter 2008 Edition), [[Edward N. Zalta]] (ed.), http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/ludwig-feuerbach/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant's transcendental idealism consisted of taking a point of view outside and above oneself (transcendentally) and understanding that the mind directly knows only phenomena or ideas. Whatever exists other than mental phenomena, or ideas that appear to the mind, is a thing-in-itself and cannot be directly and immediately known.

Kant had criticized pure reason. He wanted to restrict reasoning, judging, and speaking only to objects of possible experience. The main German Idealists, who had been theology students,&lt;ref&gt;"[Fichte], like both Schelling and Hegel, the other leading Idealist philosophers,...began as a student of theology…." Green, Garrett. "Introduction," ''Attempt at a Critique of All Revelation'', by J.G. Fichte, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1978, p. i, Note.&lt;/ref&gt; reacted against Kant’s stringent limits.&lt;ref&gt;"Fichte (and the other absolute Idealists) have disregarded Kant’s advice that we should not engage with concepts of which we can have no experience (instances of this are Fichte’s Absolute I, Schelling’s Absolute, and Hegel’s Geist)&amp;hellip;." "Fichte: Kantian or Spinozian? Three Interpretations of the Absolute I" by Alexandre Guilherme, [[Durham University]], South  African  Journal of  Philosophy, (2010), Volume 29, Number 1, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; "It was Kant’s criticism of all attempts to prove the existence of God which led to the romantic reaction of Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel."&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper]] (1945), ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', Volume 2, Chapter 11, II, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theorists==

===Jacobi===
{{see also|Leap of faith}}
In 1787, [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] addressed, in his book ''On Faith, or Idealism and Realism'', Kant's concept of "thing-in-itself". Jacobi agreed that the objective thing-in-itself cannot be directly known. However, he stated, it must be taken on belief. A subject must believe that there is a real object in the external world that is related to the representation or mental idea that is directly known. This belief is a result of revelation or immediately known, but logically unproved, truth. The real existence of a thing-in-itself is revealed or disclosed to the observing subject. In this way, the subject directly knows the ideal, subjective representations that appear in the mind, and strongly believes in the real, objective thing-in-itself that exists outside the mind. By presenting the external world as an object of belief, Jacobi legitimized belief. "&amp;hellip;[B]y reducing the external world to a matter of faith, he wanted merely to open a little door for faith in general..."&lt;ref name="Schopenhauer"&gt;Schopenhauer, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. I&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reinhold===
[[Karl Leonhard Reinhold]] published two volumes of ''Letters Concerning the Kantian Philosophy'' in 1790 and 1792. They provided a clear explication of Kant's thoughts, which were previously inaccessible due to Kant's use of complex or technical language.

Reinhold also tried to prove Kant's assertion that humans and other animals can know only images that appear in their minds, never "things-in-themselves" (things that are not mere appearances in a mind). In order to establish his proof, Reinhold stated an [[axiom]] that could not possibly be doubted. From this axiom, all knowledge of [[consciousness]] could be deduced. His axiom was: "Representation is distinguished in consciousness by the subject from the subject and object, and is referred to both."

He thereby started, not from definitions, but, from a principle that referred to mental images or representations in a conscious mind. In this way, he analyzed knowledge into (1) the knowing subject, or observer, (2) the known object, and (3) the image or representation in the subject's mind. In order to understand transcendental idealism, it is necessary to reflect deeply enough to distinguish experience as consisting of these three components: subject, subject's representation of object, and object.

===Schulze===
Kant noted that a mental idea or representation must be a representation of something, and deduced that it is of something external to the mind. He gave the name of ''Ding an sich'', or [[thing-in-itself]] to that which is represented. However, [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze]] wrote, anonymously, that the law of cause and effect only applies to the phenomena within the mind, not between those phenomena and any things-in-themselves outside the mind. That is, a thing-in-itself cannot be the cause of an idea or image of a thing in the mind. In this way, he discredited Kant's philosophy by using Kant's own reasoning to disprove the existence of a thing-in-itself.

===Fichte===
{{Main article|Johann Gottlieb Fichte}}
After Schulze had seriously criticized the notion of a thing-in-itself, Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762–1814) produced a philosophy similar to Kant's, but without a thing-in-itself. Fichte asserted that our representations, ideas, or mental images are merely the productions of our ego, or knowing subject. For him, there is no external thing-in-itself that produces the ideas. On the contrary, the knowing subject, or ego, is the cause of the external thing, object, or non-ego.

Fichte's style was a challenging exaggeration of Kant's already difficult writing. Also, Fichte claimed that his truths were apparent to intellectual, non-perceptual, intuition. That is, the truth can be immediately seen by the use of reason.

Schopenhauer, a student of Fichte's, wrote of him:
{{Quote|...Fichte who, because the thing-in-itself had just been discredited, at once prepared a system without any thing-in-itself. Consequently, he rejected the assumption of anything that was not through and through merely our [[representation (psychology)|representation]], and therefore let the knowing [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] be all in all or at any rate produce everything from its own resources. For this purpose, he at once did away with the essential and most meritorious part of the Kantian doctrine, the distinction between ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' and thus that between the phenomenon and the thing-in-itself. For he declared everything to be ''a priori'', naturally without any proofs for such a monstrous assertion; instead of these, he gave sophisms and even crazy sham demonstrations whose absurdity was concealed under the mask of profundity and of the incomprehensibility ostensibly arising therefrom. Moreover, he appealed boldly and openly to intellectual intuition, that is, really to [[wikt:inspiration|inspiration]].|Schopenhauer|''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Vol. I, §13}}

===Schelling===
{{Main article|Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling}}
Schelling attempted to rescue theism from Kant’s refutation of the proofs for God’s existence. "Now the philosophy of Schelling from the first admitted the possibility of a knowledge of God, although it likewise started from the philosophy of Kant, which denies such knowledge." &lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], ''[[Lectures on the History of Philosophy]]'', Section Three: "Recent German Philosophy," D. "Schelling"&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the experience of objects, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling (1775–1854) claimed that the Fichte's "I" needs the Not-I, because there is no subject without object, and vice versa. So the ideas or mental images in the mind are identical to the extended objects which are external to the mind. According to Schelling's "absolute identity" or "indifferentism", there is no difference between the subjective and the objective, that is, the ideal and the real.

In 1851, [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] criticized Schelling's absolute identity of the subjective and the objective, or of the ideal and the real. "...[E]verything that rare minds like Locke and Kant had separated after an incredible amount of reflection and judgment, was to be again poured into the pap of that absolute identity. For the teaching of those two thinkers [Locke and Kant] may be very appropriately described as the doctrine of the ''absolute diversity of the ideal and the real, or of the subjective and the objective''."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Vol. I, "Fragments for the History of Philosophy," § 13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schleiermacher===
[[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] was a theologian who asserted that the ideal and the real are united in God. He understood the ideal as the subjective mental activities of thought, intellect, and reason. The real was, for him, the objective area of nature and physical being. Schleiermacher declared that the unity of the ideal and the real is manifested in God. The two divisions do not have a productive or causal effect on each other. Rather, they are both equally existent in the absolute transcendental entity which is God.

===Maimon===
[[Salomon Maimon]] influenced German idealism by criticizing Kant's dichotomies, claiming that Kant did not explain how opposites such as sensibility and understanding could relate to each other.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Maimon claimed that the dualism between these faculties was analogous to the old Cartesian dualism between the mind and body, and that all the problems of the older dualism should hold ''mutatis mutandis'' for the new one. Such was the heterogeneity between understanding and sensibility, Maimon further argued, that there could be no criterion to determine how the  concepts of the understanding apply to the intuitions of sensibility.  By thus pointing out these problematic dualisms, Maimon and the neo-Humean critics left a foothold open for skepticism within the framework of Kant’s own philosophy.  For now the question arose how two such heterogeneous realms as the intellectual and the sensible could be known to correspond with one another. The problem was no longer how we know that our representations correspond with things in themselves but how we know that ''a priori'' concepts apply to ''a posteriori'' intuitions.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Companion to German Idealism'', Edited by [[Karl Ameriks]] (2000), Chapter I, [[Frederick C. Beiser]], "The Enlightenment and idealism," , Section V, "The meta-critical campaign," page 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schelling and Hegel, however, tried to solve this problem by claiming that opposites are absolutely identical.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Maimon's concept of an infinite mind as the basis of all opposites was similar to the German idealistic attempt to rescue theism by positing an Absolute Mind or Spirit.

Maimon’s metaphysical concept of "infinite mind" was similar to Fichte’s "Ich" and Hegel’s "Geist." Maimon ignored the results of Kant’s criticism and returned to pre-Kantian transcendent speculation. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;What characterizes Fichte’s, Schelling’s, and Hegel’s speculative idealism in contrast to Kant's [[critical idealism]] is the recurrence of metaphysical ideas from the rationalist tradition. What Kant forbade as a violation of the limits of human knowledge, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel saw as a necessity of the critical philosophy itself. Now Maimon was the crucial figure behind this transformation. By reviving metaphysical ideas from within the problematic of the critical philosophy, he gave them a new legitimacy and opened up the possibility for a critical resurrection of metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser]], ''The Fate of Reason: German Philosophy from Kant to Fichte'', Chapter 10, "Maimon’s Critical Philosophy," page 287, Harvard University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Maimon is said to have Influenced Hegel’s writing on Spinoza. "[T]here seems to be a striking similarity between Maimon’s discussion of Spinoza in the ''Lebensgeschichte'' (Maimon's autobiography) and Hegel’s discussion of Spinoza in the ''Lectures in the History of Philosophy''."&lt;ref&gt;"Salomon Maimon and the Rise of Spinozism in German Idealism," Yitzhaky Melamed, ''Journal of the History of Philosophy'', vol. 42, no. 1 (2004) 67–96&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hegel===
{{Main article|Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Absolute idealism}}
Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) was a [[German people|German]] [[philosopher]] born in [[Stuttgart]], [[Württemberg]], in present-day southwest Germany. Hegel responded to Kant's philosophy by suggesting that the unsolvable contradictions given by Kant in his [[Critique of Pure Reason#The Antinomy of Pure Reason|Antinomies of Pure Reason]] applied not only to the four areas Kant gave (world as infinite vs. finite, material as composite vs. atomic, etc.) but in all objects and conceptions, notions and ideas. To know this he suggested makes a "vital part in a philosophical theory."&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, "The Science of Logic" in ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophical Sciences'' (1817-1830)&lt;/ref&gt; Given that abstract thought is thus limited, he went on to consider how historical formations give rise to different philosophies and ways of thinking. For Hegel, thought fails when it is only given as an abstraction and is not united with considerations of historical reality. In his major work ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' he went on to trace the formation of [[self-consciousness]] through history and the importance of other people in the awakening of self-consciousness (see [[master-slave dialectic]]). Thus Hegel introduces two important ideas to metaphysics and philosophy: the integral importance of history and of the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]] person. His work is theological in that it replaces the traditional concept of [[God]] with that of an [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;"[T]he task that touches the interest of philosophy most nearly at the present moment: to put God back at the peak of philosophy, absolutely prior to all else as the one and only ground of everything." (Hegel, "How the Ordinary Human Understanding Takes Philosophy as displayed in the works of Mr. Krug," ''Kritisches Journal der Philosophie'', I, no. 1, 1802, pages 91-115)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Hegelian philosophy is the last grand attempt to restore a lost and defunct Christianity through philosophy&amp;hellip;. [Die Hegelsche Philosophie ist der letzte großartige Versuch, das verlorene, untergegangene Christentum durch die Philosophie wieder herzustellen]" ([[Ludwig Feuerbach]], ''Principles of the Philosophy of the Future'' [''Grundsätze der Philosophie der Zukunft'' (1843)], § 21)&lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza, who changed the anthropomorphic concept of God into that of an abstract, vague, underlying Substance, was praised by Hegel whose concept of Absolute fulfilled a similar function. Hegel claimed that "You are either a Spinozist or not a philosopher at all".&lt;ref&gt;''Hegel's Lectures on the History of Philosophy'', Section 2, Chapter 1, A2. Spinoza. General Criticism of Spinoza's Philosophy, Second Point of View (cf. paragraph beginning with "The second point to be considered&amp;hellip;")&lt;/ref&gt; Reality results from God’s thinking, according to Hegel. Objects  that appear to a spectator originate in God’s mind.&lt;ref&gt;"&amp;hellip;the deepest fact about the nature of reality is that it is a product of God’s thought.&amp;hellip; Hegel even goes so far as to claim that the fact that objects appear to human beings in a particular way, as phenomena, is a reflection of the essential nature of those objects and of their origin in a divine intelligence rather than in our own." (''The Cambridge Companion to German Idealism'', edited by [[Karl Ameriks]]: Chapter 2, "Absolute idealism and the rejection of Kantian dualism" by [[Paul Guyer]], Section I, "Hegel on the sources of Kantian dualism")&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses==

===Neo-Kantianism===
{{main article|Neo-Kantianism}}
Neo-Kantianism refers broadly to a revived type of philosophy along the lines of that laid down by Immanuel Kant in the 18th century, or more specifically by Schopenhauer's criticism of the Kantian philosophy in his work ''The World as Will and Representation'' (1818), as well as by other post-Kantian philosophers such as Jakob Friedrich Fries and Johann Friedrich Herbart. It has some more specific reference in later German philosophy.

===Hegelianism===
{{main article|Hegelianism|Right Hegelians|Young Hegelians|Karl Marx}}
Hegel was hugely influential throughout the nineteenth century; by its end, according to [[Bertrand Russell]], "the leading academic philosophers, both in America and Britain, were largely Hegelian".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]], ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; His influence has continued in contemporary philosophy but mainly in [[Continental philosophy]].

===Schopenhauer===
{{Main article|Arthur Schopenhauer}}
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] contended that [[Spinoza]] had a great influence on post-Kantian German idealists.&lt;ref&gt;"Spinoza’s influence on German Idealism was remarkable. He was both a challenge and inspiration for the three major figures of this movement (footnote:  A very detailed examination of Spinoza’s influence on German Idealism is given in Jean-Marie Vaysse’s ''Totalité et Subjectivité: Spinoza dans l’Idéalisme Allemand''. ). Hegel, Schelling and Fichte all sought to define their own philosophical positions in relation to his." (Bela Egyed, "Spinoza, Schopenhauer and the Standpoint of Affirmation," ''PhaenEx 2'', no. 1 (spring/summer 2007): 110-131)&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer wrote: "In consequence of Kant's criticism of all speculative [[theology]], almost all the philosophizers in [[Germany]] cast themselves back on to Spinoza, so that the whole series of unsuccessful attempts known by the name of post-Kantian philosophy is simply Spinozism tastelessly got up, veiled in all kinds of unintelligible [[language]], and otherwise twisted and distorted."&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Schopenhauer, Kant's original philosophy, with its refutation of all speculative [[theology]], had been transformed by the German Idealists. Through the use of his technical terms, such as "transcendental," "transcendent," "reason," "intelligibility," and "thing-in-itself" they attempted to speak of what exists beyond experience and, in this way, to revive the notions of God, [[free will]], and immortality of soul. Kant had effectively relegated these ineffable notions to faith and belief.&lt;ref&gt;"In order to have insight into the [[existence of God]], freedom, and immortality, speculative reason must use principles that are intended merely for objects of possible experience. If the principles are applied to God, freedom, and immortality, which cannot be objects of experience, the principles would always treat these three notions as though they were mere phenomena [appearances]. This would render the practicality of pure reason impossible. Therefore, I had to abandon knowledge in order to make room for faith." Kant, ''Critique of Pure Reason'', B xxx.&lt;/ref&gt;

===British idealism===
{{main article|British idealism|Thomas Hill Green|F. H. Bradley|Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|J. M. E. McTaggart|Harold Joachim|John Henry Muirhead|Geoffrey Reginald Gilchrist Mure}}
In England, during the nineteenth century, philosopher [[Thomas Hill Green]] embraced German Idealism in order to salvage Christian [[monotheism]] as a basis for morality. His philosophy attempted to account for an eternal consciousness or [[mind]] that was similar to [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]]'s concept of [[God]] and [[Georg Hegel|Hegel]]'s [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]]. John Rodman, in the introduction to his book on Thomas Hill Green's political theory, wrote: "Green is best seen as an exponent of German idealism as an answer to the dilemma posed by the discrediting of Christianity&amp;hellip;."&lt;ref&gt;John Rodman, ''The Political Theory of T. H. Green'', New York: Appleton Century–Crofts, 1964, "Introduction"&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main article|Transcendentalism|St. Louis Hegelians}}
"German idealism was initially introduced to the broader community of American ''literati'' through a [[Vermont]] intellectual, James Marsh. Studying theology with [[Moses Stuart]] at [[Andover Newton Theological School|Andover Seminary]] in the early 1820s, Marsh sought a [[Christian]] [[theology]] that would 'keep alive the heart in the head.' "&lt;ref&gt;James Marsh, as quoted by James A. Good (2002) in volume 2 of his ''The early American reception of German idealism'', p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Some American theologians and churchmen found value in German Idealism's theological concept of the infinite Absolute Ideal or ''[[Geist]]'' [Spirit]. It provided a religious alternative to the traditional Christian concept of the [[Deity]].&lt;ref&gt;“The Absolute or World Spirit was easily identified with the God of Christianity….”, ([[Morton White]] (Ed.) ''[[The Mentor Philosophers]]: The Age of Analysis: twentieth century philosophers'', Houghton Mifflin, 1955, Chapter 1, “The Decline and Fall of the Absolute”)&lt;/ref&gt; "&amp;hellip;[P]ost&amp;ndash;Kantian idealism can certainly be viewed as a religious school of thought&amp;hellip;."&lt;ref&gt;James Allan Good, ''A search for unity in diversity'', in James Allan Good (editor), ''The Early American Reception of German Idealism'' (Volume 2 of 5), Bristol: Thoemmes Press 2002, {{ISBN|1-85506-992-X}}, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; The Absolute Ideal ''Weltgeist'' [World Spirit] was invoked by American ministers as they "turned to German idealism in the hope of finding comfort against English positivism and empiricism."&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Schneider, ''History of American philosophy'' (2nd edition), New York: Columbia University Press, 1963, p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; German idealism was a substitute for religion after the Civil War when "Americans were drawn to German idealism because of a 'loss of faith in traditional cosmic explanations.' "&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Dowler, ''The New Idealism'', Ph.D. dissertation, University of Maryland, 1974, p. 13, as quoted in James Allan Good, ''A search for unity in diversity'', p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; "By the early 1870s, the infiltration of German idealism was so pronounced that [[Walt Whitman]] declared in his personal notes that 'Only Hegel is fit for America &amp;mdash; is large enough and free enough.' "&lt;ref&gt;Walt Whitman, ''The complete writings'', vol. 9, p. 170, as quoted in James A. Good (2005), ''A search for unity in diversity'', ch. 2, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ortega y Gasset===
According to [[José Ortega y Gasset]],&lt;ref&gt;José Ortega y Gasset, ''Phenomenology and Art'', New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1975, {{ISBN|0-393-08714-X}}, "Preface for Germans," p. 48 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; with Post-Kantian German Idealism, "&amp;hellip;never before has a lack of truthfulness played such a large and important role in philosophy." "They did whatever they felt like doing with concepts. As if by magic they changed anything into any other thing." According to Ortega y Gasset, "&amp;hellip;the basic force behind their work was not strictly and exclusively the desire for truth&amp;hellip;." Ortega y Gasset quoted [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume II, in which Schopenhauer wrote that Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel forgot "the fact that one can feel an authentic and bitter seriousness" for philosophy. Schopenhauer, in Ortega y Gasset's quote, hoped that philosophers like those three men could learn "true and fruitful seriousness, such that the problem of existence would capture the thinker and bestir his innermost being."

===George Santayana===
[[George Santayana]] had strongly-held opinions regarding this attempt to overcome the effects of Kant's transcendental idealism.{{Quote|German Idealism, when we study it as a product of its own age and country, is a most engaging phenomenon; it is full of [[afflatus]], sweep, and deep searchings of the heart; but it is essentially romantic and egoistical, and all in it that is not soliloquy is mere system-making and sophistry. Therefore when it is taught by unromantic people ''ex cathedra'', in stentorian tones, and represented as the rational foundation of science and religion, with neither of which it has any honest sympathy, it becomes positively odious &amp;ndash; one of the worst impostures and blights to which a youthful imagination could be subjected.|[[George Santayana]]|''Winds of Doctrine'', IV, i.}}

===G. E. Moore===
{{main article|Analytic philosophy}}
In the first sentence of his ''[http://www.ditext.com/moore/refute.html The Refutation of Idealism]'', [[G. E. Moore]] wrote: "Modern Idealism, if it asserts any general conclusion about the universe at all, asserts that it is spiritual," by which he means "that the whole universe possesses all the qualities the possession of which is held to make us so superior to things which seem to be inanimate." He does not directly confront this conclusion, and instead focuses on what he considers the distinctively Idealist premise that "esse is percipere" or that to be is to be perceived. He analyzes this idea and considers it to conflate ideas or be contradictory.

===Slavoj Žižek===
[[Slavoj Žižek]] sees German Idealism as the pinnacle of modern philosophy, and as a tradition that contemporary philosophy must recapture: "[T]here is a unique philosophical moment in which philosophy appears 'as such' and which serves as a key—as the only key—to reading the entire preceding and following tradition as philosophy... This moment is the moment of German Idealism..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Slavoj |last=Žižek |title=Less Than Nothing: Hegel and the Shadow of Dialectical Materialism |year=2012 |publisher=Verso |url=http://www.versobooks.com/books/1114-less-than-nothing |isbn=9781844678976}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7–8}}

=== Hannah Arendt ===
[[Hannah Arendt]] stated that Immanuel Kant distinguished between ''Vernunft'' ("reason") and ''Verstand'' ("intellect"): these two categories are equivalents of "the urgent need of" reason, and the "mere quest and desire for knowledge". Differentiating between reason and intellect, or the need to reason and the quest for knowledge, as Kant has done, according to Arendt "coincides with a distinction between two altogether different mental activities, thinking and knowing, and two altogether different concerns, meaning, in the first category, and cognition, in the second".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The life of the mind. One / thinking.|last = Arendt|first = Hannah|publisher = Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|year = 1978|isbn = |location = |pages = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas were also developed by Kantian philosopher, [[Wilhelm Windelband]], in his discussion of the approaches to knowledge named [[Nomothetic and idiographic|"nomothetic" and "idiographic"]].

Kant's insight to start differentiating between approaches to knowledge that attempt to understand meaning (derived from reason), on the one hand, and to derive laws (on which knowledge is based), on the other, started to make room for "speculative thought" (which in this case, is not seen as a negative aspect, but rather an indication that knowledge and the effort to derive laws to explain objective phenomena has been separated from ''thinking''). This new-found room for "speculative thought" (reason, or thinking) touched-off the rise of German idealism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The life of the mind. One / thinking.|last = Arendt|first = Hannah|publisher = Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|year = 1978|isbn = |location = |pages = 15 to 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the new-found "speculative thought", reason or thinking of German idealism "again became a field for a new brand of specialists committed to the notion that philosophy's 'subject proper' is 'the actual knowledge of what truly is'. Liberated by Kant from the old school of dogmatism and its sterile exercises, they erected not only new systems but a new 'science' - the original title of the greatest of their works, Hegel's ''Phenomenology of the mind'', was ''Science of the experience of consciousness'' - eagerly blurring Kant's distinction between reason's concern with the unknowable and the intellect's concern with cognition. Pursuing the Cartesian ideal of certainty as though Kant had never existed, they believed in all earnest that the results of their speculations possessed the same kind of validity as the results of cognitive processes".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Harold Henry Joachim''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|oʊ|ə|k|ɪ|m}}; 28 May 1868 – 30 July 1938) was a [[British idealist]] philosopher. A disciple of [[Francis Herbert Bradley]], whose posthumous papers he edited, Joachim is now identified with the later days of the [[British idealist]] movement. He is generally credited with the definitive formulation of the [[coherence theory of truth]], in his book ''The Nature of Truth'' (1906).&lt;ref name=IEP&gt;[https://www.iep.utm.edu/joachim/ Harold Henry Joachim (1868—1938) (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a scholar of [[Aristotle]] and [[Spinoza]].

==Life==
Harold Henry Joachim was born in London, the son of a wool merchant who had come to England as a boy from [[Hungary]]. He was educated at [[Harrow School]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was a pupil of [[R. L. Nettleship]]. He was elected to a Prize Fellowship at [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]] in 1890, and in 1892 became a philosophy lecturer at the [[University of St Andrews]]. Returning to Oxford in 1894, he was lecturer at Balliol until becoming a Fellow and Tutor at Merton in 1897. In 1907 he married his first cousin, a daughter of the violinist [[Joseph Joachim]]. He became [[Wykeham Professor]] of Logic of the [[University of Oxford]] from 1919, succeeding the realist [[John Cook Wilson]], and occupied the chair until his death.&lt;ref name=Thoemmes&gt;{{Citation | last=Mander| first=W. J.| chapter=Joachim, Harold Henry (1868-1938) | editor-last=Mander | editor-first=W. J. | editor2-last=Sell | editor2-first=Alan P.

Eliot]]. Joachim was a nephew of the great 19th Century violinist [[Joseph Joachim]], and was himself a talented amateur violinist.

==Legacy==
The coherence theory is nowadays viewed as part of a class of theories called ''robust'' or ''inflationary'' accounts of truth. In this class, it is a rival to the [[correspondence theory of truth|correspondence]] and the [[pragmatist theory of truth|pragmatist]] theories. Both [[Bertrand Russell]], arguing for the former, and [[William James]], arguing for the latter, cited Joachim's text as a paradigm of what they thought was wrong about the coherence theory.

'''''A Humanist Manifesto''''', also known as '''''Humanist Manifesto I''''' to distinguish it from later ''[[Humanist Manifesto]]s'' in the series, was written in 1933 primarily by [[Raymond Bragg]] and published with 34 signers. Unlike the later manifestos, this first talks of a new [[religion]] and refers to humanism as a religious movement meant to transcend and replace previous, deity-based systems. Nevertheless, it is careful not to express a [[creed]] or [[dogma]]. The document outlines fifteen affirmations on cosmology, biological and cultural evolution, human nature, [[epistemology]], ethics, religion, self-fulfillment, and the quest for freedom and social justice. This latter, stated in article fourteen, proved to be the most controversial, even among humanists, in its opposition to "acquisitive and profit-motivated society" and its demand for an egalitarian world community based on voluntary mutual cooperation. The document's release was reported by the mainstream media on May 1, simultaneous with its publication in the May/June 1933 issue of the ''[[New Humanist]]''. 

Two manifestos followed: ''[[Humanist Manifesto II]]'' in 1973 and ''[[Humanism and Its Aspirations]]'' in 2003.

'''Hylopathism''', in [[philosophy]], is the belief that some or all matter is sentient or that properties of matter in general give rise to subjective experience. It is opposed to the assertion that consciousness results exclusively from properties of specific types of matter, e.g. brain tissue.

==Etymology and specific definition==
The term is relatively uncommon even in philosophical discussion, and is often erroneously equated with [[panpsychism]] despite notable differences between the two views that are evident in the etymologies of the two words: "panpsychism" derives from the Greek ''pan'', "all", and ''psyche'', "soul" or "mind" (the terms ''consciousness'' and ''experience'' being preferred in philosophy), and implies the sentience of all things; hylopathism derives from ''hylo-'', which is translated either as "matter" or "wood" depending on its context, and whose English equivalent is [[hyle]], and ''pathos'', "emotion" or "suffering" (and, by extension, experience).{{citation needed|reason=this conflicts with Hard_problem_of_consciousness#Consciousness_is_fundamental_or_elusive which calls hylopathism a form of panpsychism|date=January 2011}} Hylopathism is thus not necessarily a belief in the universality of sentience, but rather in the derivation of sentience from matter.

'''Jean Crasset''' (b. at [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]], France, 3 January 1618; d. at Paris, 4 January 1692) was a French [[Jesuit]] theologian, known as an [[ascetical]] writer.

==Life==
He entered the Society of Jesus in 1638, and became professor of humanities and philosophy. He was director for twenty-three years of a famous sodality of men connected with the [[professed house (Paris)|professed house]] of the Jesuits in Paris, and was also a successful preacher.

==Works==
Crasset is the author of many ascetical works, among which are:

*"Methode d'oraison"; 
*"Considérationes chrétiennes pour tous les jours de l'année"; 
*"La chrétienne in solitude"; 
*"Dissertation sur les oracles des Sibylles", which was vigorously attacked; 
*[https://archive.org/details/entretiensdouxet00cras "Entretiens pour la jeunesse" (1685)]

He also published in 1689 a "Historie de l'eglise du japon" which has been translated into several languages but which is considered inferior to that of [[Charlevoix]]. Crasset's history was unoriginal, for it was drawn in great part from the work which {{Interlanguage link multi|François Solier|fr}} had issued in 1627; he  retouched the style and continued the narrative from 1624 to 1658, but with crowded details. The author attributed the origin of the persecution of 1597 to the imprudence of the friars in making their religious ceremonies public.

There is a posthumous work of his entitled "La foy victorieuse de l'infidélite et du libertinage". On 9 September 1656, the [[Bishop of Orléans]] issued an interdict against him for having in one of his sermons charged several ecclesiastics with sustaining the propositions condemned by the Bull of [[Pope Innocent X]], "Cum occasione" (31 May 1653). The interdict was removed in the following February.

'''Jeremi Wasiutyński''' (1907–2005) was a [[Poland|Polish]] astronomer and philosopher.

He made a detailed study of the mechanical and thermal effects of turbulence in rotating stars.

His book ''The Solar Mystery'' offered an in-depth re-evaluation of the influences that drove Copernicus to formulate his heliocentric model.

'''Jesse J. Prinz''' is a Distinguished Professor of [[philosophy]] and Director of the Committee for Interdisciplinary Science Studies at the [[Graduate Center of the City University of New York]]. 

Prinz works primarily in the [[philosophy of psychology]] and ethics and has authored several books and over 100 articles, addressing such topics as [[emotion]], [[moral psychology]], [[aesthetics]] and [[consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/bios/prinz.html Edge:The Third Culture]&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of his work in these areas has been a defense of [[empiricism]] against [[psychological nativism]], and he situates his work as in the naturalistic tradition of philosophy associated with [[David Hume]].  Prinz is also an advocate of [[experimental philosophy]].&lt;!-- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS4DdLikfPk] --&gt;

==Education and career==

Prinz took his Ph.D. at the [[University of Chicago]] under the direction of Murat Aydede, a philosopher of cognitive science now at the [[University of British Columbia]].  He taught previously at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] and at [[Washington University, St. Louis]], with visiting positions at [[University College London]], [[California Institute of Technology]], and [[University of Maryland, College Park]].

==Philosophical work==
===Philosophy of emotions===
Jesse Prinz has offered a "natural kinds" theory of [[emotion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Prinz, J. (2004). Which Emotions are Basic? In D. Evans, &amp; P. Cruse, Emotion, Evolution, and Rationality (pp. 1-19). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to him, an emotional experience is a bodily change that indicates situations in our environment that should concern us.  When we encounter a stimulus that affects our well-being we experience a set of bodily changes that represent things like dangers, losses, and offenses.  These bodily changes are appropriate to the situation and are learned over time through association to specific instances we have encountered in the past.  They are felt, but oftentimes these feelings are not in the foreground of [[phenomenal consciousness]].  When we do pay attention to the feeling it then becomes an actual emotion.&lt;ref&gt;Prinz, J. (2005). Are Emotions Feelings? Journal of Consciousness Studies, 9-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The set of possible feelings are limited by our biology and correspond roughly to our traditional emotional categories.  The traditional emotions (anger, fear, etc.) have functional roles and are always related to objects and situations in the environment.  They are always directed toward something (i.e. intentional), and these emotions have a particular bodily configuration that defines them.  According to Prinz,&lt;ref&gt;Prinz, J. (2003). Emotions Embodied. In R. Solomon, Thinking about Feeling (pp. 1-14). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; there are six basic emotions, which are characterized by unique body patterns. The ‘big six’ emotions are actually subdivided into a biologically basic primitive stock of feelings that each culture classifies in different ways.  For example, fear could be subdivided into worry (future dangers) and panic (present dangers), both of which spring the experiencing organism into action as an appropriate response to environmental stimulus.  Likewise, happiness subdivides into sensory pleasure, satisfaction, and joy which each have specific bodily responses.  Complex emotions such as despair, romantic love, and jealousy are recent (on an evolutionary timescale) additions to the breadth of possible affects that are also associations between our primitive stock of feelings and particular kinds of situations.  Other [[homeostasis|homeostatic emotions]] such as hunger and fatigue are different in that they are states of the organism rather than relationships between it and its environment.

According to this theory, when we encounter certain stimuli we experience a learned bodily change in response.  These bodily-change stimuli, or elicitors, belong to what Prinz calls a mental file that is connected to one of our primitive stock of emotions through learning.  These “elicitation files” can then trigger the relevant response previously associated with it.  Throughout our lives new files can be created and new triggering conditions can be added to existing files.  Similar files can become so closely related that triggers for one can also cause the other.   However, these elicitation files should not be confused with the emotions themselves, but rather they are culturally calibrated triggers for our emotions.  According to Prinz, affects are exhausted by the somatic feelings that are experienced.  Emotions are only the feelings and not the causes or effects of those feelings.  Each feeling is associated with a range of conditions and represents a response to the current situation being experienced.

===Ethics and moral psychology===

Prinz also defends sentimentalism in ethics, and ethical relativism.

==Biography==
Born in New Jersey, Beck studied music at the [[Oberlin Conservatory of Music]] and worked for some time as a pianist and [[piano]] teacher. She married and raised a family of four children, then separated from her husband and worked as a teacher, secretary, and assistant in a university department.&lt;!--everyday zen, vi--&gt; She began Zen practice in her 40s with [[Taizan Maezumi|Hakuyu Taizan Maezumi]] in Los Angeles,&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite book  |title=Zen Master Who?: A Guide to the People and Stories of Zen |first=James Ishmael |last=Ford |publisher=Wisdom Publications |location=Boston |year=2006 |pages=173–175 |isbn=978-0-86171-509-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later with [[Hakuun Yasutani]] and [[Soen Nakagawa]].&lt;ref name="who"/&gt; Beck received [[Dharma transmission]] from Taizan Maezumi Roshi in 1978,&lt;ref name="who"/&gt; but broke with Maezumi over [[Taizan Maezumi#Criticism|his actions]] and opened Zen Center San Diego in 1983,&lt;ref name="who"/&gt; serving as its head teacher until July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honorary Founder|url=http://prairiezen.org/Founder.html|publisher=[[Ordinary Mind Zen School|Prairie Zen Center]]|accessdate=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beck was responsible for a number of important innovations in Zen teaching. Because she was adept at teaching students to work with their psychological states, she attracted a number of students who were interested in the relationship between Zen and modern psychology. Several of her Dharma heirs are practicing psychologists/psychiatrists.&lt;ref name="magid"&gt;{{cite web|title=Barry Magid Interview|url=http://sweepingzen.com/barry-magid-interview-2/|publisher=Sweeping Zen|accessdate=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 Joko, along with three of her Dharma heirs, founded the [[Ordinary Mind Zen School]].

'''Jonathan D. Moreno''' is an American philosopher and historian who specializes in the intersection of [[bioethics]], culture, science, and national security, and has published seminal works on the history, sociology and politics of biology and medicine.

Moreno is the David and Lyn Silfen University Professor and Professor of Medical Ethics and the History and Sociology of Science at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].  As the David and Lyn Silfen University Professor, Moreno is one of fourteen Penn Integrates Knowledge professors.  He is a Senior Fellow at the [[Center for American Progress]] and served on the Obama-Biden Transition Project in 2008 as the Director of the Department of Health and Human Services Agency Review for Bioethics.

Moreno is a senior advisor for the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080916023939/http://www.bioethics.gov/ Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues], and served on the senior staff of the Clinton Administration’s [[National Bioethics Advisory Commission]] and the [[Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments]].  He is an elected member of the Institute of Medicine of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] and is the U.S. member of the [[UNESCO]] International Bioethics Committee.

==Early life==

Jonathan D. Moreno was born and grew up in New York’s Hudson Valley.  His father, [[Jacob Levy Moreno]], was a psychiatrist and the pioneer of [[psychodrama]] and [[sociometry]], the precursor of social network theory.  His father and mother, psychotherapist [[Zerka T. Moreno]], worked closely together. Both of his parents emigrated to the United States from Europe before World War II. Moreno and his older sister, Regina Moreno, spent much of their childhood in [[Beacon, New York]] on the grounds of their parents’ sanitarium and psychodrama training center.

==Education==

Moreno attended [[Hofstra University]] where he earned a B.A. in [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]]  with highest honors in 1973.  From 1973 to 1975 he was a graduate student in the philosophy doctoral program in the CUNY Graduate Center and completed his Ph.D. in philosophy at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] in 1977. Moreno’s doctoral dissertation traced the development of a distinctly American semiotic tradition from [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] to [[Nelson Goodman]].  His dissertation director was Richard S. Rudner, the longtime editor of the ''Journal of the Philosophy of Science''.

==Career==

Following graduation, Moreno held full-time academic appointments in philosophy at [[Swarthmore College]], the [[University of Texas at Austin]], and [[George Washington University]]. During 1984-85 he was an associate at the [[Hastings Center]], the first bioethics think tank.  From 1985-1987 he was philosopher-in-residence at the [[Children’s National Medical Center]] in Washington, DC.

He was the director of the Program in Medical Humanities and a Professor of Pediatrics and Medicine at the [[SUNY Downstate Medical Center|SUNY Health Science Center in Brooklyn]] from 1989 until 1998, when he joined [[University of Virginia]] faculty as the Emily Davie and Joseph S. Kornfeld Professor of Biomedical Ethics and director of the [http://www.medicine.virginia.edu/community-service/centers/biomedical-ethics-and-humanities/home-page Center for Biomedical Ethics].

In 2007, Moreno joined the faculty at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] as part of President [[Amy Gutmann]]’s [http://makinghistory.upenn.edu/pikintro Penn Integrates Knowledge] (PIK) Initiative, where he is the David and Lyn Silfen University Professor and a Professor of [http://www.med.upenn.edu/medicalethics/ Medical Ethics and Health Policy] and of the [http://hss.sas.upenn.edu/ History and Sociology of Science].  He also holds a courtesy appointment in Penn’s [http://www.phil.upenn.edu/ Department of Philosophy], is a member of the [http://www.neuroethics.upenn.edu/ Center for Neuroscience and Society], and is the interim chair of the program in Science, Technology, and Society.

As an elected member of the [[Institute of Medicine]] of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], Moreno has served on and chaired a number of committees on bioethics, embryonic stem cell research, national defense research, and neuroscience. He is also a past president of the [[American Society for Bioethics and Humanities]], was a bioethics advisor for the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]] and is a Fellow of the [[Hastings Center]] and the [[New York Academy of Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehastingscenter.org/About/Default.aspx?id=902 The Hastings Center] Hastings Center Fellows. Accessed November 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; As a Senior Fellow at the [[Center for American Progress]], Moreno is the Editor of [http://www.scienceprogress.org Science Progress], an online journal focusing on progressive science and technology policy.

==Awards and honors==
Moreno has received many awards and honors, among them a 1984-1985 Mellon Post-Doctoral Fellowship in cooperation with the [[Aspen Institute]] for Humanistic Studies.  He also received an honorary doctorate from Hofstra University in 1998 and the Benjamin Rush Medal from the [[College of William and Mary]] School of Law in 2008.&lt;ref name="biography"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bioethics.upenn.edu/people/?last=Moreno&amp;first=Jonathan |title=People: Jonathan Moreno |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]] |year=2008 |first= |last= |accessdate=2008-06-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411132438/http://www.bioethics.upenn.edu/people/?last=Moreno&amp;first=Jonathan |archivedate=2008-04-11 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major works==
Moreno has published more than 20 books, monographs, anthologies and textbooks and more than 300 papers, reviews and book chapters. He is also a member of several editorial boards.

===''Impromptu Man: J.L. Moreno and the Origins of Psychodrama, Encounter Culture, and the Social Network''===
In Moreno's latest work, ''Impromptu Man'' he explores the impact of his father, J.L Moreno's work in psychodrama, group therapy, and humanistic psychology on psychiatric treatment, societal organization, and, most remarkably, on social networks. This work is not only a biography of a largely unsung psychiatrist, but also an expansive overview of his influence on improvisational theater, group therapy, social reform, and networks within military, industry, schools and jails. J.L. Moreno discovered the underlying theory of Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, social network, in 1932 when he drew his first sociogram, which mapped interactions between individuals and showed that, despite degrees of separation, individuals influenced others in their network.

Daniel Goleman, a Harvard-trained psychologist, author of ''Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ'', and two time Pulitzer Prize nominee, stated, "''Impromptu Man'' captures the remarkable impact of a singular genius, J.L. Moreno, whose creations—the best-known being psychodrama—have shaped our culture in myriad ways, many unrecognized. The record will be set straight for all time by this can’t-put-down biography, a tribute by Jonathan D. Moreno to his father’s masterly legacy.”

===''The Body Politic: The Battle Over Science in America''===
In ''The Body Politic'', Moreno elucidates the cultural, political and societal underpinnings of biotechnology by tracing its history from early America to the present culture wars of the “new biology.” The book considers the intersection of society and biotechnology in areas such as embryonic stem cell research, reproductive cloning, and synthetic biology, and demonstrates how biology and society have shaped each other into modern-day [[biopolitics]].  [[Kirkus Reviews]] named "The Body Politic" as a "Best Book of 2011."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kirkus Reviews|title=Best Nonfiction of 2011|url=http://www.kirkusreviews.com/best-of/2011/nonfiction/|accessdate=October 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Progress in Bioethics: Science, Policy and Politics''===
''Progress in Bioethics'' is a compilation of essays that explore the politicization of modern-day [[bioethics]].  Experts consider the fundamental values of [[progressivism]] and [[conservatism]] in bioethics, and situate bioethical issues within the nuances of politics and culture in the United States.

===''Mind Wars: Brain Science and the Military in the 21st Century''===
The first book of its kind, ''Mind Wars'' covers the ethical dilemmas and bizarre history of cutting-edge technology and [[neuroscience]] developed for military applications. As the author discusses the innovative Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]) and the role of the intelligence community and countless university science departments in preparing the military and intelligence services for the twenty-first century, he also charts the future of national security.

Fully updated and revised, this edition features new material on deep brain stimulation, neuro hormones, and enhanced interrogation. With in-depth discussions of [[Psychological Warfare]] “psyops” [[mind control]] experiments, drugs that erase both fear and the need to sleep, microchip brain implants and advanced [[prosthetics]], [[supersoldiers]] and robot armies, Mind Wars may read like science fiction or the latest conspiracy thriller, but its subjects are very real and changing the course of modern warfare.

===''In the Wake of Terror: Medicine and Morality in a Time of Crisis''===
''In the Wake of Terror'' presents essays on the complex moral questions that accompany societal concerns about [[terrorism]] and [[biological warfare]]. The essays, written by experts from the fields of medicine, health care policy, law, political science, history, philosophy, and theology, consider issues of civil liberties, medical experiments, and preparedness for future terrorist attacks.

===''Undue Risk: Secret State Experiments on Humans''===
''Undue Risk'' is the first comprehensive study of the history and ethics of human experiments for national security purposes, from [[World War II]] to the [[First Gulf War]] and its aftermath.  Topics covered include the [[Nazi doctors]]' trial, the Japanese medical experiments, the [[human radiation experiments]], and [[biological warfare]] and [[chemical weapons]] testing.

===''Deciding Together: Bioethics and Moral Consensus''===
In ''Deciding Together'', Moreno discusses the process of moral consensus and its place in societal value systems from social, philosophical, and historical perspectives.  In this work, he also constructs his concept of bioethical naturalism, a naturalistic meta-philosophy that explains moral consensus through psychology and the consensus process .

'''Jules Barthélemy-Saint-Hilaire''' (19 August 1805 &amp;ndash; 24 November 1895) was a French [[philosopher]], journalist, statesman, and possible illegitimate son of [[Napoleon I of France]].

== Biography ==
Jules was born in Paris. [[Marie Belloc Lowndes]], in the second volume of her autobiography ''[[Where Love and Friendship Dwelt]]'' (1943), made claims regarding his paternity. He was reportedly ashamed of and did not talk about it. Lowndes did not say who his mother was.

In his early years he worked for the Ministry of Finance (1825–1828), and was an active journalist. From 1826 to 1830 he opposed the policies of [[Charles X of France]] in ''[[Le Globe]]''. At the [[July Revolution|revolution of 1830]] he signed the protestation of the journalists on 28 July 1830.

After 1830, he contributed to different newspapers, ''Le Constitutionnel'', ''Le National'' and ''[[Le Courrier français (1820–1851)|Le Courrier français]]'' until 1833, when he gave up politics in order to devote himself to the history of ancient philosophy, undertaking a translation of [[Aristotle]], which occupied him the greater part of his life. The reputation he gained from this work won him the chair of ancient philosophy at the [[Collège de France]] (1838) and a seat at the [[Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Science]] (1839).

After the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in France|revolution of 1848]] he was elected as a republican [[Chamber of Deputies of France|deputy]] from the ''[[département]]'' of [[Seine-et-Oise]]. He was named by the Minister of Public Instruction, [[Hippolyte Carnot|Carnot]], head of the commission preparing the draft for the education reforms. However, after Carnot's resignation and replacement by [[Alfred de Falloux]], the commission was dissolved. Nevertheless, Barthélémy-Saint-Hilaire deposed to the National Assembly the report and the propositions written by the Commission, which were ignored. After the [[French legislative election, 1849|May 1849 legislative election]], won by the conservative [[Parti de l'Ordre]], he was however re-elected and named again as a member of the parliamentary commission on education. During three years, he thus played an important role during the debates leading to the adoption of the [[Falloux Laws]] in 1850-1851, which greatly increased the clergy's influence on education, to the dismay of Republicans such as Saint-Hilaire.

He was obliged to withdraw after the [[French coup of 1851|December 1851 ''coup d'état'']] of [[Napoleon III of France|Louis Napoleon]]. In 1855 he went as member of the international commission to [[Egypt]] to report on the possibility of the proposed [[Suez canal]], and by the articles which he wrote he contributed largely to making the project popular in France.

Elected deputy again in 1869, he joined the opposition to the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], and in 1871, as a member of the ''Centre gauche'' parliamentary group, bent all his efforts to the election of [[Adolphe Thiers|Thiers]] as [[President of France|President of the Republic]], acting afterwards as his secretary. Appointed [[senator for life]] in 1875, he took his place among the moderate republicans (aka [[Opportunist Republicans]]), and from 23 September 1880 to 14 November 1881 was [[List of Foreign Ministers of France|minister of foreign affairs]] in the cabinet of [[Jules Ferry]]. The most important event of his administration was the annexation of [[Tunis]] under the form of a French [[protectorate]], which he actively promoted.

In 1882 the village of [[St. Hilaire, Minnesota]], in the United States, was named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;Upham, Warren (2001). ''Minnesota Place Names, A Geographical Encyclopedia'', Third Edition. MHS Press ({{ISBN|0-87351-396-7}}), pp. 436-437.&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Paris in 1895. His principal works, besides the translation of Aristotle and a number of studies connected with the same subject, are ''Des Védas'' (1854), ''Du Bouddhisme'' (1856) and ''Mahomet et le Coran'' (1865).

In the twelfth century, the philosophy of [[Illuminationism|illumination]] was systematized by [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]]. Towards the end of the century philosophy underwent a decline in much of the Muslim world, in part due to [[al-Ghazali]]'s argument that philosophy was incompatible with religion. In [[Andalusia]], [[Averroes]], defended philosophy against this charge; his extensive works include noteworthy commentaries on [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="Corbin 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tabatabai"/&gt; Although philosophy in its traditional [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] form fell out of favor in much of the Arab world, forms of mystical philosophy following on from writers such as [[Ibn Arabi]] and [[Ibn Sabin]], persisted.&lt;ref name="leaman"/&gt;

After [[Averroes]], a vivid philosophical activity persisted in the eastern Muslim world – especially [[Safavid Persia|Persia]] through works of Shiite philosophers such as [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]], [[Mir Damad]], and [[Mulla Sadra]].&lt;ref name="Corbin 2001"/&gt; [[Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i|Tabatabai]] suggests that the "element that was instrumental in the appearance of philosophical and metaphysical thought in Shi’ism and through Shi’ism in other Islamic circles was the treasury of knowledge left behind by the [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imam]]s."&lt;ref name="Tabatabai"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr|2006|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ali]]'s [[Nahj al-Balagha]] is also considered as a primary source of the doctrines professed by Shiite thinkers such as Mir Damad, Mulla Sadra, their pupils and their pupils' pupils: [[Ahmad al-Alawi]], [[Mohsen Fayz Kashani]], [[Abd al-Razzaq Lahiji]], [[Qazi Sa’id Qumi]], etc.&lt;ref name="Corbin 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mian Sharif"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sharif|first1=Mian Mohammad|title=History of Muslim Philosophy, Vol 2|date=1966|authorlink=Muhammad Sharif|publisher=Allgauer Heimatverlag GmbH|location=Germany|pages=938, 920 &amp; 907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lucien Goldmann''' ({{IPA-fr|ɡɔldman|lang}}; July 20, 1913 – October 8, 1970) was a [[France|French]] philosopher and sociologist of [[Jewish]]-Romanian origin. A professor at the [[EHESS]] in Paris, he was a [[Marxist]] theorist.

==Biography==
Goldmann was born in [[Bucharest]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], but grew up in [[Botoşani]].

He studied law at the [[University of Bucharest]] and the [[University of Vienna]] under the [[Austromarxist]] jurist [[Max Adler (Marxist)|Max Adler]].&lt;ref name="Jay"&gt;[[Martin Jay]], ''Marxism and Totality: The Adventures of a Concept from Lukács to Habermas'', University of California Press, 1984, p. 305–6.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, he went to the [[University of Paris]] to study political economy, literature, and philosophy.&lt;ref name="Jay"/&gt;  He moved to [[Switzerland]] in November 1942, where he was placed in a refugee camp until 1943.&lt;ref name="Jay"/&gt; Through [[Jean Piaget]]'s intervention, he was subsequently given a scholarship to the [[University of Zurich]],&lt;ref name="Jay"/&gt; where he completed his PhD in philosophy in 1945 with a thesis entitled ''Mensch, Gemeinschaft und Welt in der Philosophie Immanuel Kants'' (''Man, Community and world in the Philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]]'').

==Philosophy&lt;!--'Genetic structuralism' redirects here--&gt;==
While many Parisian leftists staunchly upheld Marxism's "[[scientificity]]" in the 1950s and 1960s, Lucien Goldmann insisted that Marxism was by then in severe crisis and had to reinvent itself radically if it were to survive. He rejected the traditional Marxist view of the [[proletariat]] and contested the [[Structural Marxism|structural Marxist]] movement. In fact, the popularity of such trends on the [[Left Bank]] was one reason why Goldmann's own name and work were eclipsed — this despite the acclaim of thinkers as diverse as [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], who called him "the finest and most intelligent Marxist of the age."{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

He refused to portray his aspirations for humanity's future as an inexorable unfolding of history's laws, but saw them rather as a [[Pascal's Wager|wager]] akin to [[Blaise Pascal]]'s in the [[existence of God]]. "Risk", Goldmann wrote in his classic study of Pascal's ''[[Pensées]]'' and [[Jean Racine]]'s [[Phèdre]], "is possibility of failure, hope of success, and the synthesis of the three in a faith which is a wager are the essential constituent elements of the human condition". He called his work "dialectical" and "humanist."

He sought to synthesize the [[genetic epistemology]] of Piaget with the Marxism of [[György Lukács]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/n04757670185m126/ "Genetic structuralism and the analysis of social consciousness"]&lt;/ref&gt; he was the founder of the theory of '''genetic structuralism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; which he developed in the 1960s.

Lucien Goldmann was a humanist socialist, disciple of György Lukács, his sociology of literature in an important critic of [[structuralism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O88-GoldmannLucien.html Lucien Goldmann, a Dictionary of Sociology, 1998, Gordon Marshall, Encyclopedia.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Works===

Following his articles on robot ethics and his book Growing Moral Relations,&lt;ref name="palgrave.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/?sf1=id_product&amp;st1=581716|title=Palgrave|work=www.palgrave.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coeckelbergh has been attributed a 'relational turn' in thinking about moral status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281645540_The_Issue_of_Moral_Consideration_in_Robot_Ethics|title = The Issue of Moral Consideration in Robot Ethics|date = 19 September 2015|accessdate = 19 September 2015|website = ResearchGate|publisher = ResearchGate|last = Gerdes|first = Anne}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his articles Coeckelbergh argues for a [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] and [[Relational theory|relational]] approach to the [[Philosophy of artificial intelligence|philosophy of robotics]]. His theory on 'Social Relationalism' in regards to Artificial Intelligence and Morality is discussed by Gunkel and Cripe in their paper entitled 'Apocalypse Not, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Machine'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gunkel|first1=David J.|last2=Cripe|first2=Billy|title=Apocalypse Not, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Machine|journal=Kritikos|date=September 2014|volume=11|page=4.2 Social Relationalism}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has published mainly on robot ethics and ICT in health care, but also on many other topics. He also wrote a book on vulnerability and technology (Human Being @ Risk) in which he proposes an 'anthropology of vulnerability' and engages with discussions about human enhancement and [[transhumanism]]. His first books are about freedom, autonomy, and the role of imagination in [[moral reasoning]]. Later books discuss the problem of disengagement and distancing in the use of [[information and communication technologies]] (ICTs) and society's relation to the environment: in Environmental Skill he argues against modern and romantic ways of relating to the environment and in Money Machines he discusses new financial ICTs. In New Romantic Cyborgs he investigates the relation between technology and [[romanticism]] and reflects on what he calls "the end of the machine". He also wrote opinion articles in [[The Guardian]] and in [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sure, Artificial Intelligence May End Our World, But That Is Not the Main Problem|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/12/armageddon-is-not-the-ai-problem/|website=wired.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reviews===
Work by Coeckelbergh has been responded to by many academics, such as Wendell Wallach of Yale University, USA who regarding the book '[http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9781472445087 Money Machines]' comments: “Mark Coeckelbergh is recognized internationally for illuminating the manner in which information and communication technologies (ICTs) create new forms of “distancing” and in particular “moral distancing”. This important book extends that analysis to underscore the hidden ways ICTs shape money and global finance, alter relationships, and undermine responsibility”. Also, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9655.12683/full Keir James Cecil Martin writes about Money Machines]: "Coeckelbergh’s view of money as a technology of relationality that shortens some geographical and temporal distances, whilst simultaneously widening moral and social gaps (…) has much to offer to anthropological debates on the nature of finance and money."

Marks publications that have been peer-reviewed and received reviews include: Money Machines &lt;ref name="Money Machines"/&gt; 'Environmental Skill',&lt;ref name="Environmental Skill"/&gt; 'Human Being @Risk' &lt;ref name="Human Being @ Risk"/&gt; and 'Growing Moral Relations' &lt;ref name="Growing Moral Relations"/&gt; as well as articles and other peer-reviewed research publications. For example, David Gunkel has written in his review in Ethics and Information Technology that Growing Moral Relations&lt;ref name="palgrave.com"/&gt; is 'a real game changer' and 'a penetrating analysis of moral status'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mark Coeckelbergh: Growing moral relations: critique of moral status ascription|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-012-9308-8|journal = Ethics and Information Technology|date = 2013-02-28|issn = 1388-1957|pages = 239–241|volume = 15|issue = 3|doi = 10.1007/s10676-012-9308-8|first = David J.|last = Gunkel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jac Swart has called the book 'an important contribution to animal ethics'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mark Coeckelbergh: Growing Moral Relations.

She questions Coeckelbergh's interpretation of Heidegger but also praises 'Coeckelbergh's effectiveness in articulating a compelling account of the problem of motivation and how the development of an ethics of skilled engagement with the environment, a focus on habit and virtue, would find us better equipped to deal with the environmental crises we face. It is a welcome and interesting addition to a field in need of voices focused on bringing about meaningful, practical change.'&lt;ref name="ndpr.nd.edu"/&gt; And Louke van Wensveen writes in her review in the journal Environmental Ethics that the book reminds us of 'an overly autistic, obsessively controlling tendency in Western philosophical and everyday cultures. Such a distancing pattern and its ideological scaffolding prevent environmental action.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&amp;fp=enviroethics&amp;id=enviroethics_2015_0037_0003_0379_0380|title = Mark Coeckelbergh: Environmental Skill: Motivation, Knowledge, and the Possibility of a Non-Romantic Environmental Ethics  - Louke van Wensveen - Environmental Ethics (Philosophy Documentation Center)|website = www.pdcnet.org|access-date = 2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August and September 2015 Coeckelbergh's book "Money Machines"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9781472445100&lt;/ref&gt; received media attention: he was interviewed on BBC Radio Leicester,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 28/08/2015, Jonathan Lampon - BBC Radio Leicester|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02z0lqb|website = BBC|accessdate = 2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Leicester Mercury&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = De Montfort University professor warns global financial crash could happen again|url = http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Crashes-warning/story-27724426-detail/story.html|accessdate = 2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he warns for a growing reliance on computer algorithms in global finance, and in the Belgian national newspaper De Standaard, which printed a large article on the book in its weekend edition of 12 September 2015. In the De Standaard interview (in Dutch), Coeckelbergh warns that we might delegate too much to technology, and that we lack control and overview. The ethical and societal influence of new technologies may be invisible but is and remains powerful. But, he argues, if technology is part of the problem, it is also part of the solution: we need to develop new, alternative technologies and technological practices, also in the financial world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ‘De schuldige voor de financiële crisis?

Coeckelbergh has also been quoted in international mainstream media such as CNN&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Phoebe|first1=Parke|title=Is it cruel to kick a robot dog?|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/02/13/tech/spot-robot-dog-google/index.html|agency=CNN|publisher=CNN|date=February 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has a profile at the Guardian &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark Coeckelbergh|url=https://www.theguardian.com/profile/mark-coeckelbergh|website=theguardian.com|publisher=the guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to many comments from readers responding to his article regarding his thoughts about the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=We're all to blame for the oil spill|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/jun/09/deepwater-horizon-oil-spill-responsibility-bp|agency=the guardian|publisher=the guardian|date=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 November 2012 Coeckelbergh was Interviewed by Stephen Edwards for a report appearing in the Economist newspaper Intelligence Unit (EIU) exploring the interaction between humans and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Edwards|first1=Stephen|title=Humans and Machines - the role of people in technology driven organisations (sub heading) Smart systems, Smarter doctors|url=http://www.economistinsights.com/sites/default/files/downloads/EIU_Humans%20&amp;%20machines_FINAL_WEB.pdf|agency=The Economist|date=Nov 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Coeckelbergh received much response on social media by other philosophers such as Evan Selinger &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Selinger|first1=Evan|title=Evan Selinger|url=https://twitter.com/EvanSelinger/status/540510492088098816?t=1&amp;cn=bWVudGlvbg%3D%3D&amp;sig=19cc606194ff171993bd137bb1b28d73773f84c6&amp;al=1&amp;iid=e0bc7c2d4b1a4c0e9692367509cbab4a&amp;autoactions=1417702718&amp;uid=2904865133&amp;nid=4+1264|website=Twitter|publisher=Evan Selinger}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his Wired magazine article with posts appearing on Twitter and Facebook.

Coeckelbergh's paper entitled 'Humans, Animals, and Robots: A Phenomenological Approach to Human-Robot Relations' was referenced in an online article for Dailydot.com entitled 'sex and love in the robot age' where human-robot relations were discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McHugh|first1=Molly|title=Sex and love in the robot age|url=http://kernelmag.dailydot.com/issue-sections/features-issue-sections/11649/sex-robot-future-roxxxxy/|website=dailydot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote an opinion article with Katleen Gabriels in the Dutch newspaper nrc.next which questions a call for banning sex robots and asks attention for (more) pressing societal issues,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Niets mis met  een robotin bed|url = http://www.nrc.nl/next/van/2015/september/26/niets-mis-met-een-robot-in-bed-1537416|accessdate = 2015-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was interviewed about his critical comments on the campaign in the Leicester Mercury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Banning sex robots 'would be going too far', says De Montfort University professor|url = http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Sex-robots-banned-says-fellow-university/story-27903046-detail/story.html|accessdate = 2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017 he has been included in the top of tech pioneers named by the Belgian newspaper [[De Tijd]], in the category leaders and thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://multimedia.tijd.be/techpioniers/|title=De Tijd - Tech Pioniers|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21114">'''Memory erasure''' is the selective artificial removal of [[memories]] or associations from the [[brain|mind]].

There are many reasons that research is being done on the selective removal of memories. Potential patients for this research include patients suffering from psychiatric disorders such as [[post  traumatic stress disorder]], or [[substance use disorder]], among others.&lt;ref name=Young&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.07.036 |title=Selective, Retrieval-Independent Disruption of Methamphetamine-Associated Memory by Actin Depolymerization |year=2013 |last1=Young |first1=Erica J. |last2=Aceti |first2=Massimiliano |last3=Griggs |first3=Erica M. |last4=Fuchs |first4=Rita A. |last5=Zigmond |first5=Zachary |last6=Rumbaugh |first6=Gavin |last7=Miller |first7=Courtney A. |journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=75 |issue=2 |pages=96–104 |pmid=24012327 |pmc=4023488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Memory erasure has been shown to be possible in some experimental conditions; some of the techniques currently being investigated are: [[drug-induced amnesia]], selective memory suppression, destruction of [[neurons]], interruption of memory, [[Memory consolidation|reconsolidation]],&lt;ref name=Chan&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1218472110 |title=Impairing existing declarative memory in humans by disrupting reconsolidation |year=2013 |last1=Chan |first1=Jason C. K. |last2=Lapaglia |first2=Jessica A. |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=110 |issue=23 |pages=9309–13 |pmid=23690586 |pmc=3677482}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the disruption of specific molecular mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Young /&gt;

== Early history ==
Research focused on gaining a better understanding of what memories are has been going on for many years, in this way so has research in memory erasure. The basis for the recent history for memory erasure has been focused on determining how the brain actively keeps memories stored and retrieves them. There have been several instances where researchers found drugs that when applied to certain areas of the brain, usually the [[amygdala]], have relative success in being able to erase some memories. As early as 2009 researchers were able to trace and destroy neurons involved in supporting the specific type of memory that they were trying to erase. This caused the erasure of the target memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1164139 |title=Selective Erasure of a Fear Memory |year=2009 |last1=Han |first1=Jin-Hee |last2=Kushner |first2=Steven A. K|last3=Yiu |first3=Adelaide P. |last4=Hsiang |first4=Hwa-Lin |last5=Buch |first5=Thorsten |last6=Waisman |first6=Ari |last7=Bontempi |first7=Bruno |last8=Neve |first8=Rachael L. |last9=Frankland |first9=Paul W. |last10=Josselyn |first10=Sheena A. |journal=Science |volume=323 |issue=5920 |pages=1492–6 |pmid=19286560}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from the biotechnology approach to studying memory, research in psychiatry on how memories work has also been going on for several years. There has been some studies that show that some behavioral therapy can erase bad memories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1223006 |laysummary=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/memory-medic/201210/behavioral-therapy-erases-bad-memories |laysource=Psychology Today |laydate=October 7, 2012 |title=Disruption of Reconsolidation Erases a Fear Memory Trace in the Human Amygdala |year=2012 |last1=Agren |first1=Thomas |last2=Engman |first2=Jonas |last3=Frick |first3=Andreas |last4=Björkstrand |first4=Johannes |last5=Larsson |first5=Elna-Marie |last6=Furmark |first6=Tomas |last7=Fredrikson |first7=Mats |journal=Science |volume=337 |issue=6101 |pages=1550–2 |pmid=22997340}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although there has been some evidence that psychodynamic therapy and other [[Energy (psychological)|energy]] techniques&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feinstein|first=D|title=Energy Psychology: A Review of the Preliminary Evidence|journal=Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training|year=2008|volume=45|issue=2|pages=199–213|url=http://www.innersource.net/ep/epresearch.html|doi=10.1037/0033-3204.45.2.199|pmid=22122417}}&lt;/ref&gt;  can help with forgetting memories among other psychiatric issues there is no proven therapeutic approach for trying to erase bad memories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1529100612468841 |laysummary=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/news/releases/most-effective-ptsd-therapies-are-not-being-widely-used-researchers-find.html |laysource=Association for Psychological Science |laydate=April 11, 2013 |title=Challenges and Successes in Dissemination of Evidence-Based Treatments for Posttraumatic Stress: Lessons Learned from Prolonged Exposure Therapy for PTSD |year=2013 |last1=Foa |first1=Edna B. |last2=Gillihan |first2=Seth J. |last3=Bryant |first3=Richard A. |journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=65–111|pmc=4338436 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential patients ==
There are several different types of possible patients that have the potential to draw great benefit from the selective memory erasure; these include people suffering from drug addiction, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD patients may include war veterans, people who witnessed horrific events, victims of violent crimes and many other possibly traumatic events. These potential patients have unwanted memories that can be absolutely devastating to their daily lives and cause them to not be able to function properly.&lt;ref name=caplan /&gt;

Along with patients suffering from these severe circumstances the idea of selective memory erasure is a very attractive idea for many. Thus making the practical use of this technology something that could be used by many people.&lt;ref name=caplan /&gt;

=== Different types of memories ===
There are three main types of memories: [[sensory memory]], [[short-term memory]], and [[long-term memory]]. Sensory memory in short is the ability to hold sensory information for a short period of time, for example looking at an object and being able to remember what it looked like moments after. Short-term memory is memory that allows a person to recall a short period of time; this can be a few seconds to a minute. Short-term memory allows people to remember what happened during that short time span without actually practicing the memory. Long-term memory has a much larger capacity than the prior two and actually stores information from both these types of memories to create a long lasting and large memory. Long-term memory is the largest target for research involving selective memory erasure.

Within long-term memory there are also different types of long-term memories. [[Implicit memory]] is one type of long-term memory that is generally described as the ability to remember how to use objects or specific movements of the body (e.g. using a hammer). Another type of long-term memory, [[explicit memory]], refers to memories that can be consciously drawn upon by a person to remember. Explicit memory can be split into further subcategories, one being [[episodic memory]], which is the memory of specific events and the information surrounding it, as well as [[semantic memory]], which is the ability to remember factual information (e.g. what numbers mean).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Long-Term Memory|url=http://www.positscience.com/brain-resources/memory/types-of-memory/long-term-memory|work=PositScience|publisher=Posit Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A type of memory of main concern for memory erasure are [[emotional memory|emotional memories]]. These memories often involve several different aspects of information in them that can come from a variety of the different categories of memories mentioned above. These emotional memories are very powerful memories and can have very strong physiological effects on a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=LeDoux|first=Joseph|title=Emotional mempory|journal=Scholarpedia|volume=2|issue=7|pages=1806|doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.1806|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of an emotional memory can be found in patients suffering from PTSD, for these patients a traumatic event has left a lasting emotional memory that can have powerful effects on a person even without them consciously retrieving the memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/index.shtml|work=National Institute of Mental Health|publisher=National Institutes of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current research ==

=== Drug-induced amnesia ===
[[Drug-induced amnesia]] is the idea of selectively losing or inhibiting the creation of memories using drugs. [[Amnesia]] can be used as a treatment for patients who have experienced psychological trauma or for medical procedures where full [[anesthesia]] is not an option. Drug-induced amnesia is also a side-effect of other drugs like [[alcohol]] and [[rohypnol]].

There are other drugs that also can cause their users to be put in an amnesic state, where they experience some type of amnesia because of their use. Examples of these drugs include [[Triazolam]], [[Midazolam]] and [[Diazepam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jain |first=K K |title=Drug-Induced Memory Disturbance|url=http://www.medlink.com/web_content/MLT000K0.asp |publisher=Neurology Medlink |accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disruption of molecular mechanisms ===
There is a growing amount of information that has shown that memory depends largely on the brain's synaptic plasticity, with a large part of this being dependent on its ability to maintain [[long-term potentiation]] (LTP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.23.1.649 |title=Synaptic Plasticity and Memory: An Evaluation of the Hypothesis |year=2000 |last1=Martin |first1=S. J. |last2=Grimwood |first2=P. D. |last3=Morris |first3=R. G. M. |journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience |volume=23 |pages=649–711 |pmid=10845078 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies on LTP have also started to indicate that there are several molecular mechanisms that may be at the basis of memory storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0959-4388(00)00194-X |title=Molecular mechanisms of memory acquisition, consolidation and retrieval |year=2001 |last1=Abel |first1=Ted |last2=Lattal |first2=K.Matthew |journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=180–7 |pmid=11301237}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thus a more recent approach to erasing memories and the associations the brain makes with objects is disrupting specific molecular mechanisms in the brain that are actively keeping memories active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1042/bse0480263 |title=Epigenetic regulation of genes in learning and memory |year=2010 |last1=Roth |first1=Tania L. |last2=Roth |first2=Eric D. |last3=Sweatt |first3=J. David |journal=Essays in Biochemistry |volume=48 |pages=263–74 |pmid=20822498 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recovering [[methamphetamine]] (METH) addicts have reported that the sight of certain objects such as a lighter, gum or drug paraphernalia can cause massive cravings that can sometimes lead to a break in their mental strength and cause them to [[relapse]].&lt;ref name=Young /&gt; This indicates that long-term memories can be called upon by various different associations that were made with the memory without the conscious effort of the person. With an increasing belief that memories are largely supported by functional and structural plasticity deriving from F-actin polymerization in [[postsynaptic]] [[dendrite|dendritic spines]] at excitatory [[synapses]].&lt;ref name=Young /&gt; Recent research has been done to target this F-actin polymerization by using direct actin [[depolymerization]] or a [[myosin]] II inhibitor to disrupt the polymerized F-actin associated with METH memory associations. The study indicated types of associations can be disrupted days to weeks after [[Memory consolidation|consolidation]].&lt;ref name=Young /&gt; Although the depolymerization techniques had no effect on food reward based associations or shock based associations the results demonstrate the idea that meth associated memories' actin [[cytoskeleton]] is constantly changing making it uniquely sensitive to depolymerization during the maintenance phase.  This is some of the first evidence showing that memories made with different associations are actively maintained using different molecular substrates. These results also show that the actin cytoskeleton may be a promising target for selective disruption of unwanted long-term memories.&lt;ref name=Young /&gt;

=== Selective memory suppression ===
Selective memory suppression is the idea that someone can consciously block an unwanted memory. There are many different therapeutic techniques or training that has been done to test this idea with some success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Trei |first=Lisa |title=Psychologists offer proof of brain's ability to suppress memories |journal=Stanford Report |date=January 8, 2004 |url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2004/january14/memory-114.html |accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these techniques focus on blocking the retrieval of a memory using different suppression techniques to slowly teach the brain to suppress the memory. Although some of these techniques have been useful for some people it has not been shown to be a clear cut solution to forgetting memories. Because these memories are not truly erased but merely suppressed the question of how permanent the solution is and what actually happens to the memories can be troubling for some.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01634.x |title=Suppressing Unwanted Memories |year=2009 |last1=Anderson |first1=Michael C. |last2=Levy |first2=Benjamin J. |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=189–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selective memory suppression is also something that can occur without a person being consciously aware of suppressing the creation and retrieval of unwanted memories. When this occurs without the person knowing it is usually referred to as [[memory inhibition]]; the memory itself is called a [[repressed memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bjork|first=R.A.|title=Retrieval inhibition as an adaptive mechanism in human memory|journal=Varieties of memory and consciousness|year=1989|pages=309–330|url=http://bjorklab.psych.ucla.edu/pubs/RBjork_1989.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225064612/http://bjorklab.psych.ucla.edu/pubs/RBjork_1989.pdf|archivedate=2012-02-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Interruption of memory reconsolidation ====
One of the ways scientists have attempted to erase these memories through suppression is by interrupting the reconsolidation of a memory. [[Reconsolidation|Memory consolidation]] of a memory is when a person recalls a memory, usually a fearful one, it becomes susceptible to alteration, and then gets stored again.&lt;ref name="Tronson"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nrn2090 |title=Molecular mechanisms of memory reconsolidation |year=2007 |last1=Tronson |first1=Natalie C. |last2=Taylor |first2=Jane R. |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=262–75 |pmid=17342174}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led many researchers to believe that this time period is the best time for memories to be altered or erased. Studies have shown that through behavioral training results showed that they were able to erase memories by tampering with memories during the reconsolidation phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bardin |first=Jon |title=Researchers erase fear memories in people through behavior alone |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/sep/20/science/la-sci-sn-researchers-erase-fear-memories-in-people-through-behavior-alone-20120920 |accessdate=27 November 2013 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=September 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Destruction of neurons ===
With evidence showing that different memories excite different neurons or system of neurons in the brain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Byrne |first=John |title=Introduction to Neurons and Neuronal Networks |url=http://neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu/s1/introduction.html |publisher=Neuroscience Online |accessdate=27 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203010009/http://neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu/s1/introduction.html |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  the technique of destroying select neurons in the brain to erase specific memories is also being researched. Studies have started to investigate the possibility of using distinct toxins along with biotechnology that allows the researchers to see which areas of the brain are being used during the reward learning process of making a memory to destroy target neurons. In a paper published in 2009, authors showed that neurons in the [[Amygdala#Anatomical subdivisions|lateral amygdala]] that had a higher level of [[CREB|cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein]] (CREB) were activated primarily over other neurons by fear memory expression. This indicated to them that these neurons were directly involved in the making of the memory trace for that fear memory. They then proceeded to train mice using [[fear conditioning|auditory fear training]] to produce a fear memory. They proceeded to check which of the neurons were overexpressing CREB and then, using a [[inducible diphtheria-toxin strategy]], they destroyed those neurons, resulting in persistent and strong memory erasure of the fear memory.&lt;ref name=Chan /&gt;

Due to the lack of understanding of the brain this technique of destroying neurons may have a much larger effect on the patient than just the removal of the intended memories. Due to this complex nature of the brain treatment that would stun the neurons instead of destroying them could be another approach that could be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Iverson|first=Margot|title=Killing Pain by Killing Neurons|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/health/1999/11/killing-pain-killing-neurons|newspaper=Science|date=22 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethics ==
As with most new technologies the idea of being able to erase memories comes with many ethical questions. One ethical question that arises is the idea that although there are some extremely painful memories that some people (for example PTSD patients) would like to be rid of, not all unpleasant memories are bad.&lt;ref name=caplan&gt;{{cite journal |last=Caplan |first=Arthur|title=Deleting Memories |journal=MIT Technology Review |date=June 18, 2013 |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/view/516056/deleting-memories/ |accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to soften or erase memories could have drastic effects on how society functions. The ability to remember unpleasant effects from one's past has a huge impact on the future actions they may take. Remembering and learning from past mistakes is crucial in the emotional development of a person and helps to ensure they do not repeat previous errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liao |first1=Matthew |first2=Anders |last2=Sandberg |first3=Julian |last3=Savulescu |title=Should We Be Erasing Memories? |journal=Practical Ethics |date=November 3, 2008 |url=http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2008/11/should-we-be-erasing-memories/ |accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ability to erase memory could also have a massive impact on the law. When it comes to determining the outcome of a trial, the ability to modify memory could have a massive impact on the judicial system. Another ethical question that arises is to how the government will use this technology and what restrictions would need to be put in place. Some worry that if soldiers can go into battle knowing that the memories created during that time period can simply be erased they may not uphold military morale and standards.&lt;ref name=caplan /&gt;

== In fiction ==
{{Main|Mindwipe}}

Memory erasure has also been a common topic of interest in [[science fiction]] and other fiction. Several notable comics, TV shows and movies feature mindwipes, including ''[[Telefon (film)|Telefon]]'', ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'', ''[[Men in Black (franchise)|Men in Black]]'', ''[[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind]]'',  ''[[Bourne (film series)|The Bourne Identity]]'', and ''[[Dollhouse (TV series)|Dollhouse]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=May|first=Kate|title=9 classic movies about memory manipulation, and how they inspired real neuroscience|url=http://blog.ted.com/2013/08/15/8-classic-movies-about-memory-manipulation-and-how-they-inspired-real-neuroscience/|work=TED Blog|publisher=Wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novels that feature memory erasure include ''[[The Invincible]]'' by [[Stanisław Lem]] and some of the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' novels (including ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'') by [[J. K. Rowling]], also ''[[The Giver]]'' by [[Lois Lowry]] deals with this subject. Several works by [[Philip K. Dick]] are about mindwipes, including "[[Paycheck (short story)|Paycheck]]" and "[[We Can Remember It for You Wholesale]]" (inspiration for ''Total Recall'').

==History==
According to Mack Lamoureux, the "...MGTOW community's history is murky, but it was most likely birthed in the mid to early 2000's by two men who go by the online aliases of Solaris and Ragnar." &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/7bdwyx/inside-the-global-collective-of-straight-male-separatists |title=Inside the Group of Straight Men Who Are Swearing Off Women: They call themselves Men Going Their Own Way and they dislike feminism so much they are grabbing their balls and going home.|last=Lamoureux |first=Mack |date=24 September 2015 |website=www.vice.com |publisher=Vice |access-date=20 April 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While MGTOW is most associated with [[Reddit]] online forums (the UK ''[[Daily Express|Express]]'' calls MGTOW a "Reddit movement"), there are also MGTOW-themed videos on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/824792/MGTOW-reddit-movement |title=Are modern men becoming CELIBATE?

==Beliefs==
MGTOW has been associated with political viewpoints. Politically, MGTOW has been variously associated with [[libertarianism]],&lt;ref name="KashmiraGander"/&gt; the [[alt-right]],&lt;ref name="KashmiraGander"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AbiWilkinson"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|last=Wilkinson |first=Abi |title=We need to talk about the online radicalisation of young, white men |date=November 15, 2016 |accessdate=February 13, 2017 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/15/alt-right-manosphere-mainstream-politics-breitbart |archiveurl= |archivedate= |journal=[[The Guardian]] |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[philosophical anarchism]].&lt;ref name="CBrianSmith"/&gt; MGTOW use the word ''[[gynocentrism|gynocentric]]'' to describe conditions that they claim favor women to the detriment of men, and are opposed to such circumstances.&lt;ref name="daubney"&gt;{{cite news|last=Daubney |first=Martin |title=George Lawlor's story shows how universities have become hostile towards men |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=November 24, 2015 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/george-lawlors-story-shows-how-universities-have-become-hostile/ |archiveurl= |archivedate= |access-date=January 14, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LauraPerrins"/&gt; MGTOW believe that there is a systemic gynocentric bias against men including [[double standard]]s in [[gender role]]s, bias against men in [[family court]]s, lack of concern for men [[false accusation of rape|falsely accused of rape]] and lack of consequences for their accusers.&lt;ref name="CBrianSmith"/&gt;

===Views on relations with women===
According to the columnist [[Martin Daubney]], members of the MGTOW community believe that legal and romantic entanglements with women fail a [[cost–benefit analysis]] and [[risk–benefit analysis]].&lt;ref name="Daubney2015"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|title=Meet the men giving up on women |url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/Magazine/article1629220.ece |journal=[[The Sunday Times]] |first=Martin |last=Daubney |date=November 15, 2015 |accessdate=December 30, 2015 |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote=As a result of these views, such men are making logical, factual and cost-benefit-based decisions about women, dating and sex—and their brutally stark conclusion is that it's simply not worth the risk, expense or effort. |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeremy Nicholson, writing for ''[[Psychology Today]]'', similarly described MGTOW as "guys who have been frustrated and punished to the point that they see no further incentive to relate [to dating] [...], they focus on making themselves happy".&lt;ref name="Nicholson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nicholson |first=Jeremy |title=Why Are Men Frustrated With Dating? |journal=[[Psychology Today]] |date=April 3, 2012 |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-attraction-doctor/201204/why-are-men-frustrated-dating |archiveurl= |archivedate=April 1, 2016 |access-date=January 8, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' magazine's Mack Lamoureux, there are a number of levels to MGTOW, ranging from the perception that gender equality is a lie, through rejection of relationships, to economic and societal disengagement.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[Kay Hymowitz]] has stated that some self-identified MGTOW express discontent because they see women as [[hypergamy|hypergamous]] and manipulative.&lt;ref name="Hymowitz"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|title=Why Are Men So Angry? |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/02/28/why-are-men-angry-manning-up-author-kay-hymowitz-explains.html |archiveurl= |archivedate= |journal=The Daily Beast |date=February 27, 2011 |accessdate=December 30, 2015 |first=Kay |last=Hymowitz |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Business Insider]]'' reporter Dylan Love wrote a "fully-realized MGTOW (there are levels to it) is someone who shuns all relationships with women, short-term, long-term, romantic, and otherwise. He eventually shuns society as a whole."&lt;ref name="bizinsider"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Love |first=Dylan |date=September 15, 2013 |title=Inside Red Pill, The Weird New Cult For Men Who Don't Understand Women |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-red-pill-reddit-2013-8 |archiveurl= |archivedate= |journal=[[Business Insider]] |access-date=January 4, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some MGTOW have many short-term casual relationships or engage in sex with prostitutes.&lt;ref name="CBrianSmith"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Straight Men Who Want Nothing to Do With Women |url=https://melmagazine.com/the-straight-men-who-want-nothing-to-do-with-women-2653920a42e8 |date=September 28, 2016 |author=C.

A MGTOW that chooses celibacy over sex and relationships is said to be "going monk"&lt;ref name="newsdotcomdotau"&gt;{{cite journal|author=news.com.au |date=October 9, 2016 |title=The MGTOW group really, really don't like women |url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/relationships/dating/the-mgtow-group-really-really-dont-like-women/news-story/d5b8dd7cbeaa2151dccf64b88c94e7c4 |journal=[[News.com.au]] |access-date=February 9, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008111241/http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/relationships/dating/the-mgtow-group-really-really-dont-like-women/news-story/d5b8dd7cbeaa2151dccf64b88c94e7c4 |archivedate=October 8, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some embrace maintaining their [[virginity]].&lt;ref name="KashmiraGander"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Inside the world of men who've sworn never to sleep with women again |last1=Gander |first1=Kashmira |journal=The Independent |date=September 27, 2016 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/reddit-mgtow-men-sex-sleep-women-manosphere-meninist-a7330276.html |archiveurl = | archivedate= |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dailyo"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Palash Krishna Mehrotra |date=September 10, 2016 |title=Why people don't want to make babies anymore (except Indians) |url=http://www.dailyo.in/lifestyle/women-sex-indians-motherhood-feminism-parenting-men-pregnancy/story/1/13319.html |archiveurl= |archivedate= |journal=DailyO |access-date=February 9, 2017 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some MGTOW members advocate having sex with prostitutes or using [[sex doll]]s.

===Red pill===
MGTOW use jargon such as "[[Red pill and blue pill|red pilled]]" to describe members of their movement and "blue pilled" to describe men outside, or opposed to their movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21700659-rebalancing-sexes-has-spawned-21st-century-misogyny-balls-all|title=Balls to all that|journal=The Economist|language=en|access-date=2018-03-05|date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="g1"&gt;{{cite news|title='Por que confraternizar com o inimigo?'

==Relationship to other groups==
===Men's rights movement===
MGTOW differs from the [[men's rights movement]], in that while the men's rights movement aims at changing the status quo, such as by changing the laws, MGTOW call for focus on [[self-ownership]]&lt;ref name="CBrianSmith"/&gt; and withdrawing from interactions with women.

Mack Lamoureux states that while "[a]t first glance, it's easy to lump MGTOW in with typical Men's Rights Activists (MRAs) who also believe that female oppression is a myth and that it's actually males who are oppressed—but that's not the case. The two groups differ significantly ... While MRAs are out to fix the problem through action and activism, members of MGTOW hold self-preservation above all else, and because of this the majority of the community seems to have decided to bow out."&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

===Herbivore men===
According to Roselina Salemi, writing for ''[[La Repubblica]]'', the Japanese concept of [[herbivore men]] is a subset of MGTOW.&lt;ref name="repub"&gt;{{cite news|last=Salemi |first=Roselina |title=Finalmente soli |work=[[La Repubblica]] |date=January 12, 2016 |url=http://d.repubblica.it/lifestyle/2016/01/12/news/sexodus_uomini_donne_giovani_separazione-2923643/?refresh_ce |archiveurl= |archivedate= |language=Italian |access-date=February 8, 2016 |quote="Dentro c'è di tutto: 'erbivori' (nel senso di per nulla carnali) stile giapponese, ..." (Translated: "Among [the MGTOW] there are all sorts of things: 'herbivores' (meaning: no carnal relations) of the Japanese type, ..." |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mack Lamoureux, writing in ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'', sees herbivore men as a consequence of Japanese socioeconomic conditions and MGTOW as an ideological choice.&lt;ref name="Lamoureux"/&gt; In a ''[[DELFI]]'' article MGTOW are described as a protest against [[feminism|feminist]] laws in the West whereas herbivore men are a response to traditional gender roles in Japan, such as those of [[Salaryman|salarymen]].&lt;ref name="delfi"&gt;{{cite news|title=Moterų minčių apie "tikrus vyrus" forumuose prisiskaitęs vaikinas: vyrai, susimąstykite |work=[[DELFI]] |date=October 12, 2015 |url=http://www.delfi.lt/pilietis/voxpopuli/moteru-minciu-apie-tikrus-vyrus-forumuose-prisiskaites-vaikinas-vyrai-susimastykite-ii.d?id=69251076 |archiveurl= |archivedate= |language=Lithuanian |access-date=January 13, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kashmira Gander writing for ''[[The Independent]]'', sees herbivore men serving as role models for MGTOW.&lt;ref name="KashmiraGander"/&gt;

===Disagreements with other groups===
MGTOW see feminists as "[[social justice warriors]]", while the [[LGBT rights movement]] and support for [[safe spaces]] are seen as obstacles to male self-ownership.&lt;ref name="KashmiraGander"/&gt; MGTOW have been described as having a "serious problem with feminism."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

MGTOW have a reciprocal disdain for the [[pickup artist]].&lt;ref name="CBrianSmith"/&gt; The MGTOW movement has been criticized by the pick-up artists (PUA) for being cult-like, antithetical to human nature, and likened to [[separatist feminism]].&lt;ref name="CBrianSmith" /&gt; Matt Forney from [[Roosh V|Return of Kings]], a pick-up artist website, calls MGTOW a "creeping cult of male loserdom".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Reception==
Some writers have generally held a critical perspective of the MGTOW community. An article in ''[[The Economist]]'' about MGTOW states that the "rebalancing of the sexes has spawned 21st-century [[misogyny]]", with slogans like "Save a male and stop a wedding™" being an unregistered trademark of MGTOW.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url= https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21700659-rebalancing-sexes-has-spawned-21st-century-misogyny-balls-all|title=Balls to all that |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=16 June 2016 |journal=The Economist |access-date= 14 April 2018|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leah Morrigan states that the MGTOW founder Sandman's videos "proclai[m] his bitter, indiscriminate hate towards women", who he claims are all "manipulative whores and liars" who Sandman "slut-shames, fat-shames, and age-shames".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/leah-morrigan/modern-dating-frustrations_b_7538254.html |title=The Fear of Being Alone Has Ruined Modern Dating |last=Morrigan |first=Leah |date=6 September 2015 |website=www.huffingtonpost.ca |publisher=Huffington Post |access-date=21 July 2018 |quote=Then there is Men Going Their Own Way, or MGTOW, an online men's community that supports "a statement of self-ownership, where the modern man preserves and protects his own sovereignty above all else". I was delighted to find this site until I read further and found that what began as masculine empowerment quickly turned vile.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When women are discussed on MGTOW forums, it is often "angrily";&lt;ref name="forani"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metronews.ca/news/canada/2017/10/02/a-way-for-men-to-come-together-men-going-their-own-way-just-want-to-be-left-alone.html|title='A way for men to come together': Men Going Their Own Way just want to be left alone|last=Forani|first=Jonathan|date=|website=www.metronews.ca|publisher=Metro|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314060114/http://www.metronews.ca/news/canada/2017/10/02/a-way-for-men-to-come-together-men-going-their-own-way-just-want-to-be-left-alone.html|archivedate=March 14, 2018|deadurl=yes|access-date=14 April 2018|quote=|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] places it "on the borders of the hateful [[incel]] community".&lt;ref name="fringe"/&gt;

Pick-up artists "disparage the community", calling their "'philosophy'...completely wrongheaded."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; W. Bradford Wilcox, a conservative and visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, was criticized by the MGTOW activist who goes by the pseudonym "Turd Flinging Monkey", who was against Wilcox's video about the "benefits of marriage for men", which notes that "married men work harder (about 400 more hours), smarter (they’re less likely to quit without having found another job), and more successfully (they make about $16,000 more per year) than their single peers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thefederalist.com/2016/05/19/the-divorce-revolution-has-bred-an-army-of-woman-haters/ |title=The Divorce Revolution Has Bred An Army Of Woman Haters&amp;nbsp;– The divorce revolution has created a large minority of men who are ambivalent or hostile towards sacrifice, commitment, women, and marriage. |last=Wilcox |first=W. Bradford |date=19 May 2016 |website=thefederalist.com |publisher=The Federalist |access-date=21 April 2018 |quote=}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Researcher Barb MacQuarrie, who described the community as "misinformed", said, "They have no real ability to identify the global forces that are at work in their life, so they hang the blame on feminists", and interact with other "disillusioned, disenfranchised men" using "deplorable" rhetoric. She says that MGTOW advocates show "a complete lack of self-reflection", and their decision to live "separatist lifestyles" away from women is "pathetic". MacQuarrie summed up her views with the comment, "They're only reinforcing each other's really distorted perceptions of what's happening in the world. They are confining themselves knowingly to a life of isolation and a lot of limitations. It's sad."&lt;ref name="forani"/&gt;

'''Michael Scot''' ([[Latin]]: '''Michael Scotus'''; 1175 – {{circa|lk=no|1232}}) was a [[mathematics|mathematician]] and [[scholar]] in the Middle Ages. He translated [[Averroes]] and was the greatest public intellectual of his days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyons|title=The House Of Wisdom|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=978 1 4088 0031 7|pages=158–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as science adviser and court astrologer to [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]].

==Early life and education==

Scot was born somewhere in the border regions of [[Scotland]] or northern England. It has been claimed that he studied first at the cathedral school of [[Durham, England|Durham]] and then at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Paris|Paris]], devoting himself to [[philosophy]], [[mathematics]], and [[astrology]]. It appears that he had also studied [[theology]] and become an ordained priest, as [[Pope Honorius III]] wrote to [[Stephen Langton]] on 16 January 1223/4, urging him to confer an English benefice on Scot, and nominated Scot as [[archbishop of Cashel]] in Ireland.&lt;ref name=StAndrews/&gt; Scot declined this appointment, but he seems to have held benefices in [[Italy]]. From Paris, Scot went to [[Bologna]], and then after a stay at [[Palermo]], to [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. There he learnt [[Arabic language|Arabic]] well enough to study the Arabic versions of [[Aristotle]] and the many commentaries of the Arabs upon these, as well as the original works of [[Avicenna]] and [[Averroes]].&lt;ref name=StAndrews&gt;{{cite web |last1=Scott |first1=T. C. |last2=Marketos |first2=P.|title=Michael Scot |url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Scot.html |publisher=[[University of St Andrews]] |accessdate=23 October 2016 |date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Scot was a typical example of the polyglot wandering scholar of the Middle Ages—a churchman who knew Latin, Greek, Arabic and Hebrew. When he was about 50, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] attracted him to his [[court (royal)|court]] in the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], and at the instigation of the emperor he superintended (along with [[Hermannus Alemannus]]) a fresh translation of Aristotle and the Arabian commentaries from Arabic into [[Latin]]. There exist translations by Scot himself of the ''[[Historia animalium]]'', of ''De anima'' and of ''De caelo'', along with the commentaries of Averroes upon them.

The second version of [[Fibonacci]]'s famous book on mathematics, ''[[Liber Abaci]]'', was dedicated to Scot in 1227, and it has been suggested that Scot played a part in Fibonacci's presentation of the [[Fibonacci sequence]].&lt;ref name=Fibonacci&gt;{{Citation|first1=T.C.|last1=Scott|first2=P.|last2=Marketos| url = http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Publications/fibonacci.pdf  | title = On the Origin of the Fibonacci Sequence |  publisher = [[MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]], University of St Andrews| format = PDF | date = March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study of a passage written by Michael Scot on [[Rainbow#Higher-order rainbows|multiple rainbows]], a phenomenon only understood by modern physics and recent observations, suggests that Michael Scot may even have had contact with the [[Tuareg people]] in the Sahara desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Tony |last=Scott| url = http://www.historiographyofscience.org/index.php/transversal/article/view/28/43 | title = Michael Scot and the Four Rainbows |  publisher = Transversal: International Journal for the Historiography of Science| issue=2| pages=204–255| format = PDF | date = June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter of 1227, recorded by Scot in his ''Liber particularis'', Frederick put questions to him concerning the foundations of the earth, the geography and rulership of the heavens, what is beyond the last heaven, in which heaven God sits, and the precise locations of hell, purgatory and heavenly paradise. He also asks about the soul; and about volcanoes, rivers, and seas. According to the chronicler Fra Salimbene, he attempted to catch Scot out in his calculations of the distance to heaven by scaling from the height of a church tower (by having it secretly lowered). Scot replied by saying that either the moon had gotten further away or the tower had gotten shorter.{{#tag:ref|See Masson (1957) for the text of the questions.|group="nb"}}

Scot was a pioneer in the study of [[physiognomy]].&lt;ref name="Maggi2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Armando Maggi|title=Satan's Rhetoric: A Study of Renaissance Demonology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dF-JHCT9bT0C&amp;pg=PA184|date=1 September 2001|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|isbn=978-0-226-50132-1|pages=184–}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[manuscript]]s dealt with [[astrology]], [[alchemy]] and the [[occult]] sciences generally and account for his popular reputation. These works include:

* ''Super auctorem spherae'', printed at Bologna in 1495 and at Venice in 1631.
* ''De sole et luna'', printed at Strassburg (1622), in the ''Theatrum chimicum'', and containing more alchemy than [[astronomy]], the sun and moon appearing as the images of gold and silver.
* ''De chiromantia'', an [[:wikt:opuscule|opuscule]] concerning [[palmistry|chiromancy]]
* A divination-centered trilogy of books collectively titled the ''[[Liber introductorius]]'' ("The Introductory Book") which includes: the ''Liber quatuor distinctionum'', the ''Liber particularis'', and the ''[[Liber physiognomiae]]''{{#tag:ref|Some sources refer to the first book in the trilogy as the ''Liber introductorius'',&lt;ref&gt;Examples includes: Edwards 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas other sources specify that the first book is the ''Liber quatuor distinctionum'' and that ''Liber introductorius'' is the name of the trilogy as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Examples includes: Meyer 2010; Pick 1998, p. 96; Resnick 2012, p. 15, note 10.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}}

The ''Liber physiognomiae'' (which also exists in an Italian translation) and the ''Super auctorem spherae'' expressly state that the author undertook the works at the request of the [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick]].

"Every [[astrologer]] is worthy of praise and honour," Scot wrote, "since by such a doctrine as astrology he probably knows many secrets of God, and things which few know."

He was offered in 1223 the role of being the [[Archbishop]] of Cashel in Ireland by [[Pope Honorius III]];&lt;ref name=StAndrews/&gt; then that of Canterbury in 1227 by [[Pope Gregory IX]].

==Death==
The date of Scot's death remains uncertain. The efforts of [[Walter Scott]] and others to identify him with the Sir Michael Scot of Balwearie, sent in 1290 on a special embassy to [[Norway]], have not convinced historians, though the two may have had family connections.

A legend popular in the late 13th and early 14th centuries said that Scot foresaw that a small stone would strike him in the head and kill him, so he wore an iron skullcap to avoid his death. However, he removed the cap in church, only to be struck by a stone and die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kay|first1=Richard|title=The Spare Ribs of Dante's Michael Scot|jstor=40166404|journal=Dante Studies, with the Annual Report of the Dante Society|publisher=[[The Johns Hopkins University Press]]|page=1|date=1985|issue=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scot in legend==
The legendary Michael Scot used to feast his friends with dishes brought by spirits from the royal kitchens of France and Spain and other lands.

He is said to have turned to stone a [[coven]] of witches, which have become the [[stone circle]] of [[Long Meg and Her Daughters]].

Scot's reputation as a [[Magician (paranormal)|magician]] had already become fixed in the age immediately following his own. He appears in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' in the fourth bolgia located in the Eighth Circle of Hell, reserved for sorcerers, astrologers, and false prophets who claimed they could see the future when they, in fact, could not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dante Alighieri|Alighieri, Dante]] (c. 1320) ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', canto xx. 115–117&lt;/ref&gt; He is described by Dante as being "spare in the flank" (''ne’ fianchi è cosi poco'').&lt;ref&gt;Kay 1985, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; While some argue that this is the "sole extant description of his physical appearance",&lt;ref&gt;Thorndike 1965, pp. 11–12, cited in Kay 1985, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; others contend that the description is more poetic. Richard Kay argues that because "the shades in the Dantesque afterworld create surrogate aerial bodies for themselves that are a projection of [their] soul[s]", this description is in reference to "some internal character trait to which [Dante] wished to draw our attention."&lt;ref&gt;Kay 1985, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Kay argues that Dante was referenceing a physiognomic description taken from Scot's own ''Liber physiognomiae''{{emdash}}namely, that thin and small ribs signify an individual "who is weak, who does little labor, who is sagacious, [and] bad" (the original Latin, found in chapter 88 of the ''Liber physiognomiae'', reads: ''Cuius costae sunt subtiles et paruae'' […] ''significat hominem debilem, pauci laboris, sagacem'' [''et''] ''malum'').&lt;ref&gt;Kay 1985, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]] represents him in the same character, and [[Pico della Mirandola|Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] arraigns him severely in his work against astrology, while [[Gabriel Naudé]] finds it necessary to defend his good name in his ''Apologie pour tous les grands personages faussement soupçonnez de magie''.

In [[John Leyden]]'s ballad ''Lord Soulis'', Michael Scot is credited with teaching magic to the protagonist, the evil sorcerer [[William II de Soules]], who ends up being boiled alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://literaryballadarchive.com/PDF/Leyden_4_Lord_Soulis_f.pdf |title=Lord Soulis |author=John Leyden |work=British Literary Ballads Archive |accessdate=April 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=br&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britainexpress.com/scotland/castles/hermitage-castle.htm |title=Hermitage Castle |author=David Ross |work=Britain Express |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/usbiography/s/williamdesoulis.html |title=William de Soulis |work=Undiscovered Scotland |accessdate=April 3, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727092549/http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/usbiography/s/williamdesoulis.html |archivedate=27 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walter Scott deploys Michael Scott (sic) in his ''[[The Lay of the Last Minstrel]]''. In Footnotes 12/13, he credits him with conquering an indefatigable demon, after it had succeeded in splitting [[Eildon Hill]] into its three distinctive cones, by challenging it to weave ropes from sea-salt. He records that in the Scottish Borders any work of great labour or antiquity is ascribed either to Auld Michael, or [[Sir William Wallace]], or the Devil.

==Scot in modern fiction==
Scot is portrayed as a black magician given to practical jokes in [[James Hogg]]'s novel ''The Three Perils of Man''.

[[Allan Massie]]'s novels ''The Evening of the World'' and ''Arthur the King'' (as well as a third projected novel) are written in the format of a romance composed by Scot on the theme of empire for the instruction of Frederick II; it implies that Scot and Frederick were lovers.

Scot is the title character in the historic fantasy novel ''The Lord of Middle Air'' by [[Michael Scott Rohan]], who claims descent from the magician.

[[Jane Yolen]]'s ''Tartan Magic'' series features Scot as a villain.

In the children's television fantasy ''[[Shoebox Zoo]]'', Michael Scot has survived to the present day, where he acts as a [[Gandalf]]-like character, serving as the mysterious, if somewhat grouchy, advisor to the protagonist, Marnie. He is played by [[Peter Mullan]].

Michael Scot's soul is summoned from its current incarnation to his mouldering body by a lodge of black magicians in ''The Adept'', by [[Katherine Kurtz]] and [[Deborah Turner Harris]]. During ''The Adept Book Two: The Lodge of the Lynx'' the personality of Scot is reintegrated with his modern incarnation (a young girl named Gillian Talbot) in order to heal the coma created by one part of the spirit being removed from the body for a protracted period.

Michael Scott [sic] was the teacher of the wizard Prospero in [[John Bellairs|John Bellairs']] novel ''[[The Face in the Frost]]''.

In [[John Buchan|John Buchan's]] ''[[The Three Hostages]]'' (1924), Scott [sic] and his work ''Physiognomia'' are mentioned in reference to the arts of spiritual/mind control, a subject of great interest to Dominick Medina, the tale's antagonist.&lt;ref&gt;Buchan, John, ''The Three Hostages'' (House of Stratus; 2001), {{ISBN|1-84232-794-1}}, pp. 142-148, retrieved from [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Three_Hostages.html?id=9y8UMM7jIvQC https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Three_Hostages.html?id=9y8UMM7jIvQC] Sept. 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scot appears as an Archmage in the [[White Wolf Publishing]] Mage/Changeling supplement ''Isle of the Mighty'' (1996).

In the book ''Falketårnet'' (English: "The Falcon Tower") by [[Erik Fosnes Hansen]], he is one of the important characters. In this book he is known as an astrologer who gives another main character, Wolfgang, a horoscope.

In the short story "The Perils of the Double Sign" by [[Robertson Davies]], (which appears in a collection called ''High Spirits'',) the narrator mentions that Michael Scot is one of his favourite authors, and his knowledge of Scot's work on the occult aids him in his encounters with a genie.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5028">[[Image:Apollonius of Tyana.jpg|thumb|[[Apollonius of Tyana]] ( c. 15?–c. 100? CE), one of the most important representatives of Neopythagoreanism]]

'''Neopythagoreanism''' (or '''Neo-Pythagoreanism''') was a school of [[Hellenistic philosophy]] which revived [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean doctrines]].
Neopythagoreanism was influenced by [[Middle Platonism]] and in turn influenced [[Neoplatonism]]. It originated in the 1st century BCE and flourished during the 1st and 2nd centuries CE. The [[1911 Britannica]] describes Neopythagoreanism as "a link in the chain between the old and the new" within Hellenistic philosophy. 
As such, it contributed to the doctrine of [[monotheism]] as it emerged during [[Late Antiquity]] (among other things influencing [[early Christianity]]). Central to Neopythagorean thought was the concept of a [[soul]] and its inherent desire for a ''[[unio mystica]]'' with the divine.&lt;ref&gt;Calvin J. Roetzel, ''The World That Shaped the New Testament'', 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mTlUqGjYpeoC&amp;pg=PA68 p. 68].&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "Neopythagoreanism" is a modern (19th century) term,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/neo-Pythagoreanism Definition of Neo-pythagoreanism by Merriam-Webster]&lt;/ref&gt; coined as a parallel of "Neoplatonism".

==History==
In the 1st century BCE [[Cicero]]'s friend [[Nigidius Figulus]] made an attempt to revive Pythagorean doctrines, but the most important members of the school were [[Apollonius of Tyana]] and [[Moderatus of Gades]] in the 1st century CE. Other important Neopythagoreans include the mathematician [[Nicomachus of Gerasa]] (fl. 150 CE), who wrote about the mystical properties of numbers. In the 2nd century, [[Numenius of Apamea]] sought to fuse additional elements of [[Platonism]] into Neopythagoreanism, prefiguring the rise of [[Neoplatonism]]. ([[Iamblichus]], in particular, was especially influenced by Neopythagoreanism).

Neopythagoreanism was an attempt to re-introduce a [[mystical]] religious element into [[Hellenistic philosophy]] (dominated by the [[Stoicism|Stoics]]) in place of what had come to be regarded as an arid formalism. The founders of the school sought to invest their doctrines with the halo of tradition by ascribing them to [[Pythagoras]] and [[Plato]]. They went back to the later period of Plato's thought, the period when Plato endeavoured to combine his doctrine of [[Theory of Forms|Ideas]] with Pythagorean number theory, and identified the [[Form of the Good|Good]] with the [[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]] (which would give rise to the Neoplatonic concept of ''[[Neo-Platonism#The One|the One]]''), the source of the duality of the Infinite and the Measured with the resultant scale of realities from the One down to the objects of the material world.

They emphasized the fundamental distinction between the [[Mind-body dichotomy|soul and the body]]. [[God]] must be worshipped spiritually by [[prayer]] and the will to be good, not in outward action. The soul must be freed from its material surrounding, the "muddy vesture of decay," by an [[ascetic]] habit of life. Bodily pleasures and all sensuous impulses must be abandoned as detrimental to the spiritual purity of the soul. God is the principle of good, [[Matter]] the groundwork of [[Evil]]. In this system can be distinguished not only the asceticism of Pythagoras and the later [[mysticism]] of Plato, but also the influence of the [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic mysteries]] and of Oriental philosophy. The Ideas of Plato are no longer self-subsistent entities but are the elements which constitute the content of spiritual activity. The non-material universe is regarded as the sphere of mind or spirit.

The [[Porta Maggiore Basilica]] where Neopythagoreans held their meetings in the 1st century, believed to have been constructed by the Statilus family &lt;ref&gt;The Family of Statilius Taurus, Herbert W. Benario, The Classical World, Vol. 64, No. 3 (Nov., 1970), pp. 73-76&lt;/ref&gt; was found near [[Porta Maggiore]] on [[Via Praenestina]] in [[Rome]] (discovered 1915).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/12005864/Secret-pagan-basilica-in-Rome-emerges-from-the-shadows-after-2000-years.html  Secret pagan basilica in Rome emerges from the shadows after 2,000 years, Nick Squires, The Telegraph, 19 Nov 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ba278b9d8106536501a2-57da1f3fe93ccf3a9828e6ce67c3d52c.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/08_spencer.pdf The Neopythagoreans at the Porta Maggiore in Rome, Lisa Spencer, Rosicrucian Digest No. 1 2009. p36-44]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.coopculture.it/en/heritage.cfm?id=184# Underground basilica of Porta Maggiore map]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2493">The '''Pact  of Brunnen''' (''Bund von Brunnen'') is a historical treaty between the cantons of 
[[Canton of Uri|Uri]], [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]], [[Unterwalden]], concluded in  [[Brunnen]] on 9 December 1315.

Representatives of the four territories (Unterwalden was composed of [[Obwalden]] and [[Nidwalden]]) met in Brunnen after the success of the [[Battle of Morgarten]] in the previous month to renew the promise of mutual military assistance. In 1318, [[Leopold I, Duke of Austria]] concluded a truce with the confederates.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles William Previté-Orton]] (ed.), ''The shorter Cambridge medieval history'', vol. 2 "Twelfth Century to the Renaissance", 1975, {{ISBN|978-0-521-09977-6}}, p. 858.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[Aegidius Tschudi]], the pact of Brunnen marks the decision to make what had been a pragmatic alliance a permanent, sworn confederacy, initiating the phase of [[growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy]], with the accession to the pact by [[Lucerne]] in 1332 and [[Zürich]] in 1351, [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]] and [[Zug]] in 1352 and [[Bern]] in 1353.&lt;ref&gt;Christophe Guillaume Koch, Johann Daniel Sander, ''Gemählde der Revolutionen in Europa: seit dem Umsturze des Römischen Kaiserthums im Occident, bis auf unsere Zeiten'', Volume 2, Sander, 1807, p. 47.

&lt;/ref&gt;

While there are a number of earlier treaties of a similar nature, the treaty of Brunnen is particular because it was the first to be worded in [[Middle High German|German language]] rather than Latin. 
The treaty was long regarded as the foundational document of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]], until the [[Federal Charter of 1291]] surpassed it in prominence during the first half of the 20th century.

'''S. N. Balagangadhara''' (aka Balu) is a professor at the [[Ghent University]] in Belgium, and director of the India Platform and the Research Centre Vergelijkende Cutuurwetenschap (Comparative Science of Cultures).

Balagangadhara was a student of [[National College, Bangalore]] and moved to [[Belgium]] in 1977 to study philosophy at [[Ghent University]], where he obtained his doctorate under the supervision of [[Etienne Vermeersch]].&lt;ref name="hindu2007"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anantharaman|first1=Sudha|title=In search of new idioms|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-sundaymagazine/article2275799.ece|accessdate=13 September 2014|work=The Hindu|date=December 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His doctoral thesis (1991) was entitled ''Comparative Science of Cultures and the Universality of Religion: An Essay on Worlds without Views and Views without the World''.

Balagangadhara has been researching the nature of religion. His central area of inquiry has been the study of Western culture against the background of Indian culture.&lt;ref name="hindu2007"/&gt; His research programme is called in Dutch "Vergelijkende Cultuurwetenschap," which translates into "Comparative Science of Cultures". He has held the co-chair of the [[Hinduism]] Unit at the [[American Academy of Religion]] (AAR). He also gives lectures to the general public in Europe and India on issues such as the current (mis)understanding of Indian culture and the search for happiness.

==Research==

From the 1980s onwards, S. N. Balagangadhara has developed the research programme Vergelijkende Cultuurwetenschap (Comparative Science of Cultures) to study cultural differences. On the one hand, he analyses western culture and intellectual thought through its representations of other cultures, with a particular focus on the western representations of India. On the other, Balagangadhara attempts to translate the knowledge embodied by the Indian traditions into the conceptual language of the twenty-first century.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Balagangadhara, S. N. (2005). "How to Speak for the Indian Traditions". Journal of the American Academy of Religion 73 (4): 987–1013. ISSN 0002-7189&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first work, ''[[The Heathen in his Blindness...]]'' (1994), Balagangadhara focused on religion, culture, and cultural difference.&lt;ref name="Balagangadhara"&gt;Balagangadhara, S. N. (1994). ''"The Heathen in his Blindness..." Asia, the West, and the Dynamic of Religion''. Leiden, New York: E. J. Brill&lt;/ref&gt; He is mainly known for the controversial claim that religion is not a cultural universal.  According to the author, Christianity had a profound influence on western culture. Balagangadhara argued that the analytical tools with which the West has understood other cultures like India, are therefore, intrinsically shaped by Semitic and Christian theology. The Semitic doctrine that God gave religion to humankind, Balagangadhara argued, lies at the heart of the ethnographic belief in the universality of religion:

{{quotation| In the name of science and ethnology, the Biblical themes have become our regular stock-in-trade: that God gave religion to humankind has become a cultural universal in the guise that all cultures have a religion; the theme that God gave one religion to humanity has taken the form and belief that all religions have something in common; that God revealed himself to humankind is sanctified in the claim that in all cultures and at all times there is a subjective experience of religion which is fundamentally the same; the idea that God implanted a sense of divinity in Man is now a secular truth in the form of an anthropological, specifically human ability to have a religious experience ... And so the list goes on, and on, and on. Theme after theme from the pages of the Bible has become the ‘but of course!’ of intellectuals—whether Jew, Muslim, Dinka, or Brahmin (1994: 226–27).&lt;ref name="Balagangadhara"/&gt;}}

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Do All Roads to Jerusalem Title Page.jpg|thumb|130px|right|Title Page ''Do All Road Lead to Jerusalem?'']] --&gt;

Balagangadhara proposes therefore a novel analysis of religion, the [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman 'religio']], the construction of 'religions' in India, and the nature of cultural differences. His second major work, ''[[Reconceptualizing India Studies]]'', appeared in 2012 and argues that post-colonial studies and modern India studies are in need of a rejuvenation. After Said's ''[[Orientalism]]'' (1978), [[post-colonialism]], as a discipline, has not contributed much to human knowledge. A strange form of unproductive self-reflection and impenetrable jargon has come to stand for and replace theory building and knowledge production. The book attempts to chalk out a potential direction for the social-scientific study of Indian culture. Stressing the need for an alternative understanding of Western culture, Balagangadhara argues that [[Hinduism]], [[caste system]], and [[secularism]] are not colonial constructs but entities within the Western cultural experience. He argues that the so-called facts about India and her traditions are a result of colonial consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Balagangadhara, S. N. (2012). ''Reconceptualizing India Studies''. New Delhi: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/arts/books/decolonising-the-social-sciences/article4137886.ece A Review of the book ''Reconceptualizing India Studies'' (2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Manohar publishers brought out a condensed and shortened version of ''[[The Heathen in his Blindness...]]'' (1994), entitled ''Do all Roads Lead to Jerusalem? The Making of Indian Religions'' (2014).

==Influences and criticisms==

Balagangadhara published his first work, ''The Heathen in His Blindness'', to a mixed reception. He is widely cited by scholars in the field of [[religious studies]]. [[Richard E. King]]'s ''Orientalism and Religion'' (1999) draws from Balagangadhara's analysis of the concept 'religion'.&lt;ref&gt;Richard King, 1999, ''Orientalism and Religion: Postcolonial Theory, India and "the Mystic East"'' (Routledge, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Sharada Sugirtharajah's ''Imagining Hinduism'' used Balagangadhara's analysis of the field of [[religious studies]] in her discussion of colonial scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Sharada Sugirtharajah, 2009, ''Imagining Hinduism: A Postcolonial Perspective'' (Routledge, 2003). Also see Timothy Fitzgerald (ed.), ''Religion and the Secular'' (Equinox Pub., 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; South Asia specialist [[Peter van der Veer]] similarly refers to Balagangadhara's theory when he raises "the broad, historical question of the ways in which Western modernity has assumed universal importance and, more specifically, how a modern Western category such as religion has come to be applied as a universal concept."&lt;ref&gt;Peter van der Veer and Hartmut Lehmann (eds.), ''Nation and Religion: Perspectives on Europe and Asia'' (Princeton University Press, 1999), 4.&lt;/ref&gt; References to Balagangadhara's theory also appear in general introductions to [[Hinduism]],&lt;ref&gt;See J. E. Llewellyn, ''Defining Hinduism: A Reader'' (Routledge, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; and his work has implications on the disciplines of [[anthropology]],&lt;ref&gt;See Vivek Dhareshwar, "Valorizing the Present: Orientalism, Postcoloniality, Human Sciences," in H. Moore and T. Sanders (eds.), ''Anthropology in Theory: Issues in Epistemology'' (Blackwell Publishing, 2006) 546–552&lt;/ref&gt; [[political philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;See Pratap Bhanu Mehta, "On the Possibility of Religious Pluralism," in Thomas Banchoff (ed.), ''Religious Pluralism, Globalization, and World Politics'' (Oxford University Press, 2008), 65–88; and L. Cady, "Categories, Conflicts, and Conundrums: Ethics and the Religious/Secular Divide," in P. French and J. Short (eds.), ''War and Border Crossings'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2005), 143–164&lt;/ref&gt; [[cultural theory]],&lt;ref&gt;See Joan G. Miller, "Cultural Conceptions of Duty: Implications for Motivation and Morality," in D. Munro, J. Schumaker, and S. Carr (eds.), ''Motivation and culture'' (Routledge, 1997), 178–192.&lt;/ref&gt; [[classics|classical literature]],&lt;ref&gt;See D. C. Feeney, ''Literature and Religion at Rome: Cultures, Contexts, and Beliefs'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[feminist theory]].&lt;ref&gt;See Pui-lan Kwok, ''Postcolonial imagination and feminist theology'' (Westminster John Knox Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent review of his work points out that "Balagangadhara's work establishes how little we understand Western culture. Speaking a Western language does not mean we understand what it is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shah|first1=Prakash|title=Critiquing the Western Account of India Studies within a Comparative Science of Cultures|journal=International Journal of Hindu Studies|date=April 2014|volume=18|issue=1|pages=67–72|doi=10.1007/s11407-014-9153-y|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11407-014-9153-y|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This task of understanding the West, "is necessary in order to clear the ground before the contribution of Indian culture can be assessed. It is made necessary because, over the last few hundred years, systems of knowledge worldwide, certainly in academic contexts, have been dominated by questions that Europe has asked of itself and about the rest of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shah|first1=Prakash|title=Cultural Difference as Epistemic Difference: A Review of Two Books by S. N. Balagangadhara|journal=Manushi|date=April 4, 2014|url=http://www.manushi.in/articles.php?articleId=1764#.U7BDNZSSygz|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review in the ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' claims his arguments to be "circuitous, quarrelsome, and often careless," replete with "[n]on sequiturs, unsupported allegations, ... digressions, [and] writing errors."&lt;ref name="Guthrie 1996"&gt;Guthrie, 1996, 'Theories of Religion" in "American Anthropologist" 98:1, 162–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a review in the ''[[Philosophy East and West]]'' describes the work as "a rambling and repetitious survey of Western intellectual history."&lt;ref name="Larson 1997, pp. 433"&gt;Larson, 1997, 'The Heathen in His Blindness' in "Philosophy East and West" 47:3, pp. 433–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Almond and David Loy remain sympathetic to Balagangadhara's theory but assert that the claims made about Christian influence are exaggerated.&lt;ref name="Almond 1996, pp. 137"&gt;Almond, 1996, 'The Heathen in His Blindness?' in ''Cultural Dynamics'' 8, pp. 137–45 and Loy, 1996, '...While the Scholar in His Wisdom Bows Down to the Truth' in ''Cultural Dynamics'' 8, pp. 147–60.&lt;/ref&gt; Will Sweetman holds that Balagangadhara's theory is based on a narrow understanding of both religion and Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Sweetman, 2003, 'Hinduism and the History of Religion: Protestant Presuppositions in the Critique of the Concept of Hinduism’ in ''MTSR'' 15, pp. 329–53.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian South Asianist, [[Sanjay Subrahmanyam]] characterised Balagangadhara's work as "peculiar" and "confused", and summed up its overall influence to be one that "despite its 'cult' status in some circles, in reality does not advance the discussion".&lt;ref&gt;Sanjay Subrahmanyam, "Monsieur Picart and the Gentiles of India," in Lynn Hunt, Margaret Jacob and Wijnand Mijnhardt, ed., ''Bernard Picart and the First Global Vision of Religion.'' Los Angeles: Getty Research Institute, 2010, 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the edited collection arising from the first Rethinking Religion in India conference, [[Chris Fuller (academic)|Chris Fuller]], Professor of Anthropology at the London School of Economics, states that "Balagangadhara's prolix theorizing mixes politically tendentious assertions that Hinduism is a religion of India whereas Islam is not, with spurious arguments that there neither is nor was 'religion' in India, because the very concept is a Western, Christian import and therefore cannot have any valid cross-cultural meaning.... to suppose that it has misled everyone along a false trail laid by Christian notions of 'religion' is nonsense."&lt;ref name="Pacific Affairs, 85/3, 2012, 664"&gt;Pacific Affairs, 85/3, 2012, 664.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition and awards==

He was the co-chair of the Hinduism Unit at the American Academy of Religion (AAR) from 2004 to 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=[AAR News]| title=Religious Studies News| date=March 2007| volume=22| issue=2| page=5| url=https://www.aarweb.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/RSN/Print%20Back%20Issues/2007-03MAR.pdf| accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 October 2013, [[University of Pardubice]] ([[Czech Republic]]) awarded him with its honorary doctorate, "doctor honoris causa", and the gold medal for: (a) the outstanding development of the comparative science of cultures and religions, (b) the development of the collaborations between European and Indian universities, and (c) his contribution to the development of the Studies of religions at the Faculty of Arts and Philosophy at the University of Pardubice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vorel|first=Petr|title=LAUDATIO: Prof. Dr. S.

On 7 July 2014, Balagangadhara announced he attained [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|Enlightenment]]. He dates the event to June 2014 and suggests that 'Enlightenment' is basically human happiness.&lt;ref&gt;http://ces.iisc.ernet.in/hpg/ragh/ccs/CCSPublications/GR/Gurukkal%20Dec%202014-EPW.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==

In 2013, he collaborated on a documentary on Indian culture with the Educators' Society for the Heritage of India (ESHI) and the [[Hindu Students Council]] (HSC). In the documentary, Balagangadhara speaks about "the two colonialisms" that India has gone through: the British colonisation of India and what he believes to be "the Islamic colonisation" of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/eshifilms |title=ESHIFilms |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary (Colonial Consciousness and Indian Culture) was released in India on 11 January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://samvada.org/2013/news-digest/new-documentary-on-colonial-cconsciousness-and-indian-culture&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014 Balagangadhara was invited by the [[Indian Council of Historical Research]] (ICHR), to deliver the keynote lecture at the seventh Maulana Abdul Kalam Memorial Lecture in New Delhi. The lecture was highly controversial and resulted in a heated academic argument with Indian historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-11-13/news/56060416_1_ichr-member-memorial-lecture-historical-research |title=History turns a battleground at ICHR meet; Belgian Professor’s provocative take on Indian historians |work=Economic Times |date=2014-11-13 |accessdate=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ddhoti |last=Singh |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/the-nepal-connect/ |title=The Nepal Connect |work=The Indian Express |date=2014-11-12 |accessdate=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ichr.ac.in/comm.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

His attempts at institution building in the South Indian state of [[Karnataka]] and the associated research on the [[caste system]] in India has proved to be controversial among [[Kannada]] intellectuals. The controversy is fueled by Balagangadhara's claim that there is no 'caste system' in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bangaloremirror.com/entertainment/lounge/Of-caste-and-west/articleshow/21186737.cms |title=Of caste and west |work=Bangalore Mirror |date=2013-05-31 |accessdate=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, at a Hyderabad English and Foreign Languages University (EFLU) conference, he was intellectually dismissive of Ambedkar and called him an idiot. Balagangadhara further called the teaching faculty at EFLU appointed on the basis of [[reservation in India]], incompetent. Activists from various organisations staged a protest in [[Shivamogga]], Karnataka, and submitted a memorandum to the President through the Deputy Commissioner’s office. The teaching and non-teaching staff of [[Kuvempu University]] staged a separate protest on its campus at Shankaraghatta, condemning Prof. Balagangadhar for his remarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dss-seeks-action-against-prof-balagangadhar/article8007369.ece |title=DSS seeks action against Prof. Balagangadhar |work=The Hindu |date= |accessdate=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151107/nation-current-affairs/article/telangana-professor-trouble-over-remarks |title=Telangana: Professor in trouble over remarks |work=Deccan Chronicle |date= |accessdate=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/action-sought-against-prof-balagangadhar/article8015715.ece |title=Action sought against Prof. Balagangadhar |work=The Hindu |date= |accessdate=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''scientific controversy''' is a substantial disagreement among [[scientist]]s. A scientific controversy may involve issues such as the interpretation of [[data]], which ideas are most supported by [[evidence]], and which ideas are most worth pursuing. For example, the connection between [[race and intelligence]] has been a subject of debate in both popular science and academic research since the inception of IQ testing in the early 20th century.

When compared to [[controversies]], scientific controversies are specific to scientific related arguments, whereas regular controversies entail a much larger range. More specifically, a scientific controversy may involve issues such as the interpretation of [[data]], which ideas are most supported by [[evidence]], and which ideas are most worth pursuing. A scientific controversy is an argument where they cannot agree on a method, theory, or hypothesis. It influences how we interpret the data to make a conclusion that best fits the data and/or evidence. Scientific controversies are healthy and can be helpful in getting scientists to think of the best ways to do things as well as different ways to approach topics. In addition, they can also help science move forward. Scientific controversies usually create media attention which allows for more people to become aware of the situation and topic being disagreed. This can create an increase in research on the topic. Although, if there are conflicts between scientific views and non-scientific views, this can hurt scientific research.&lt;ref name=berkeley&gt;[https://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/_0_0/sciencetoolkit_06 What controversy: Is a controversy misrepresented or blown out of proportion?]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many types of controversies. The main type being fundamental and secondary scientific controversies. Fundamental scientific controversies are controversies that are based on the main idea of hypotheses or theories. Meaning the central idea of a topic and not the ideas that surround it which would be secondary scientific controversies. For example, there is skepticism in the general population if there is global warming but in contrast, the majority of the scientific community agree there is global warming. This is a fundamental scientific controversy because it is the main idea. The real issue, the secondary scientific controversy, is how fast is it occurring and how to model it which is what is being researched and debated. It is important to distinguish between these two so that the real scientific issue does not get missed.&lt;ref name=berkeley/&gt;

Controversies between scientific and non-scientific ideas are not within the realm of science and are not true scientific controversies.&lt;ref name=berkeley/&gt;

The '''Songgyungwan''' was the highest educational institution established during the [[Goryeo|Koryo]] and [[Joseon|Choson Dynasties]]. It opened in 992. The institution consists of the Taesong Temple, Myongnyun Hall and 20 other buildings, including one of the largest wooden buildings to still exist in the [[DPRK]].&lt;ref name=kaesong&gt;{{cite AV media |people= KCNA|year= 2003–2014|title=World Cultural Heritage-Historical Relics in Kaesong |trans-title=|medium= |url=http://www.naenara.com.kp/en/video/?215+550+440 |accessdate= July 12, 2014|archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |time=05:54 |location= |publisher=Korea Computer Center in DPRKorea &amp; Foreign Languages Publishing House |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Songgyungwan is located two kilometers to the northeast of the center of the city of [[Kaesong]]. Since 1987, it houses the [[Koryo Museum]].&lt;ref name=raskb&gt;{{cite journal |last=CHABANOL |first=ELISABETH |last2= |first2= |date=2005 |title=Study of the Archaeological and Historical Sites of Kaesong |url= http://www.raskb.com/transactions/VOL80/VOL80-4.docx|journal= Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Korea Branch|publisher=Royal Asiatic Society Korea Branch |volume=80 |issue= |pages=35–57 |doi= |accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Songgyungwan was originally known as a palace outbuilding called “Taemyon”. The institution was built by [[Munjong of Goryeo|King Munjong, the eleventh king of Koryo]] and was designated as the principal teaching institute in 1089. The facility was given the name '''Songgyungwan''' in 1308. It was later destroyed by fire (in 1592) during the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)|Imchin War]]. The institution's twenty buildings date from its reconstruction (which started in 1602); they comply with the characteristics required of a Confucian educational establishment of the period.&lt;ref name=raskb/&gt;
[[File:Iphakdo, 5th scene of the Painting Album.jpg|framed|left|Scene from a five panel painting showing the Korean crown prince starting his studies at the Songgyungwan academy.]]
It taught [[Confuscianism]] and developed students' ability to handle political and other "practical affairs".&lt;ref name=kaesong/&gt; Songgyungwan prepared young aristocratic men for the civil service and was the center of Confucian studies in the Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stowell |first=Jessica A. |last2= |first2= |date=2003 |title=The influence of Confucian values on interpersonal communication in South Korea, compared to China and Japan. |url=http://www.uri.edu/iaics/content/2003v12n4/06%20Jessica%20A.%20Stowell.pdf |journal=Intercultural Communication Studies |publisher=International Association for Intercultural Communication Studies |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=105–116 |doi= |accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institution had the particular responsibility of educating the Crown Prince; upon being invested with that title, underwent the state ceremony of ''iphak'' (입학) or commencement of learning at the Songgyungwan in accordance with the code of the ''Iphakrye'' (입학례) as stipulated in the ''Kukcho oryeui'' (국조오례의 "Book on the Five Rites of the State").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jeong-hye |first=Park |last2= |first2= |date= 2008|title=COURT PAINTINGS ON THE CROWN PRINCES OF THE JOSEON DYNASTY |url=http://211.252.141.1/files/upload/ebook/6/KAaA_02.pdf#page=128 |journal=The International Journal of Korean Art and Archaeology |publisher=National Museum of Korea |volume=2 |issue= |pages=126–165 |doi= |accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school remained the national seat of learning until the capital was moved to [[Seoul|Hansǒng]] under the [[Joseon Dynasty|Choson Dynasty]], where the current [[Sungkyunkwan University]] became the new national university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chongguk |first=Kim |last2=Chinman |first2=Kim |date= October 1961|title= Some Notes on the Sŏnggyun'gwan |url=http://www.raskb.com/transactions/VOL38/Vol038-2.docx |journal= Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society of Korea|publisher= RASKB|volume= 38|issue=2 |pages=69–91 |doi= |accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeong Mong-ju|Chong Mong-ju]] passed his civil service examinations at the age of twenty-three and became an instructor of [[Neo-Confucianism]] at the Songgyungwan Academy in 1367.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Choi |first=Changko |last2= |first2= |date=2003 |title=Traditional Legal Thoughts in Korea |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/jkorl3&amp;div=9&amp;id=&amp;page= |journal=J.

==Current Status==
The old buildings are not well-suited to the role of a museum, as they lack proper conditions for the conservation and presentation of works of art, and are ill-suited for the reception of visitors.&lt;ref name=raskb/&gt;

'''''Sztafeta''''' (English: ''[[Relay Race]]'') is a 1939 compendium of literary reportage written by [[Melchior Wańkowicz]]. It was published in the year of the German-Soviet [[invasion of Poland]]. Popular demand caused it to be reprinted four times by the ''Biblioteka Polska'' before the outbreak of hostilities. The book was never published in [[Communist Poland]] because it praised the democratic achievements of the prewar [[Second Polish Republic]].&lt;ref name="Proszynski"&gt;[[Aleksandra Ziółkowska-Boehm]], [http://www.proszynski.pl/Sztafeta-p-31110-.html Melchior Wańkowicz, ''Sztafeta''.] Prószyński i Spółka 2012, {{ISBN|978-83-7839-044-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It gives an account of one of the biggest economic projects of the newly-resurgent interwar Poland, its [[Central Industrial Area]]. The work has been described as a "colourful reporter's panorama, telling the story of the recovery of the Second Polish Republic". [[Ryszard Kapuściński]] wrote that ''Sztafeta'' "was the first grand reportage of its kind in Poland's history – written about Polish production effort".&lt;ref name="Proszynski" /&gt; To write the book, Wańkowicz collected a great amount of background information, and he carried out dozens of interviews, starting with President [[Ignacy Mościcki]] and ending with sailors, coal miners and primary school teachers.

The book begins with an analysis of the situation of Poland in 1918, right after [[World War I]]. The country was in ruins, with two million houses destroyed; industry devastated; poverty, hunger and the threat of a cholera epidemic, all left behind by the [[Partitions of Poland]]. It goes on to describe the achievements of the Second Polish Republic, not only about the Central Industrial Area but also about the construction of [[Gdynia]] seaport, and of the political scandals such as the annexation of [[Zaolzie]].

The book was disliked by some members of the military establishment in Poland in 1939. Wańkowicz, they claimed, too frequently criticised the poverty and backwardness of Poland after over a century of foreign occupation.&lt;ref name="pozytywy"&gt;[http://www.pozytywy.com/artykuly/135795-sztafeta-zamyka-serie-dziel-wankowicza Sztafeta zamyka serię dzieł Wańkowicza. PAP, 2012-03-17.] Niekomercyjny serwis informacyjno-publicystyczny ''Pozytywy''. {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wańkowicz, who was one of the first modern Polish reporters to write about the economy, had authored a series of reports about the Central Industrial Area (or the Polish [[Magnitogorsk]], as he called the project). They were published in the Polish press in late 1937 and early 1938, and became so popular that he decided to gather four of them in one volume, ''C.O.P. Ognisko siły'', published in 1938. The book was immediately sold out, as Polish readers loved Wańkowicz's optimism, temperament, national pride and honesty.&lt;ref name="gandalf"&gt;[http://www.gandalf.com.pl/b/sztafeta/ Melchior Wańkowicz, ''Sztafeta''. Dzieła zebrane.] ''Opis.'' Księgarnia Internetowa ''Gandalf''. {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impressed by the popularity of ''C.O.P. Ognisko siły'', Wańkowicz began writing a more extensive work on the Central Industrial Area and the development of the Polish economy as a whole.

''Sztafeta'', with 520 pages, is the result of his efforts. Mariusz Grabowski of a daily,''Polska The Times'', wrote in February 2012 that ''Sztafeta'' reads like a national myth with every page a gem by praising Minister [[Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski]], and the [[Sanacja]] government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polskatimes.pl/artykul/504681,wankowicz-sklada-poklon-stalowej-woli,id,t.html Wańkowicz składa pokłon Stalowej Woli by Mariusz Grabowski, 2012-02-10.] "Narodowa baśń ku pokrzepieniu serc."&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sztafeta'', based on the original 1939 edition, together with a number of photographs and maps by pre-war graphic designer, Mieczysław Berman, was republished in February 2012 by the Warsaw publishing house ''Prószyński i spółka'' (whose founder Mieczysław Prószyński is a grandson of [[Konrad Prószyński]]), as '''volume 16''' of the collected works of Wańkowicz.

== Contents ==

=== Foreword ===
In the foreword, Wańkowicz states that the title of the book refers to an historic relay race, whose objective is to make Poland a developed and industrial nation. The author also thanks people who contributed to the book, including Ministers [[Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski]], Juliusz Ulrich and Antoni Roman. Wańkowicz writes "To show the real face of Poland and show how Polish people work, to show Poles around their own country in which they are foreigners - it means teaching us to respect ourselves (...) I have tried to undertake this task as best as I can" (page 18).

=== Preface===
In the preface he touches on the foreign policy of the [[Second Polish Republic]]. Wańkowicz claims that the foreign policy of a country is connected with its strength and power. "Foreign policy is a test of finances, military forces, administration and internal order, the psychological density of and the social justice within a nation". As Wańkowicz states, from the very beginning, the Second Polish Republic had to find its place among the victorious nations of World War I, according to the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. "History has taught us that we will not prosper under the Treaty, and that we are condemned to handle everything ourselves (...) The Treaty and the spirit of its creators tried to create Poland as one of small Eastern European states. As a result, [[Gdańsk]] was not granted to Poland, [[Zaolzie]] was given to the Czechs, eastern borders were limited, and the [[Little Treaty of Versailles]] was imposed on Poland (...) [Since 1933], Poland has distanced itself from the Treaty of Versailles, as its failing structure does not attract us. Since then, we have been trying to maintain a policy of balance between our two neighbours (...) Even though the [[Locarno Treaties]] gave France the right for an armed intervention in case of the [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland]], even though England, Italy, Belgium and Poland were obliged to actively support France, the French did not make any decision". Furthermore, Wańkowicz claims that the [[May Coup (Poland)|May Coup]] of 1926 may have been connected with Germany's admission into the [[League of Nations]], since [[Józef Piłsudski]] came to the conclusion that under the circumstances, he should take control of both the foreign policy and the army of Poland. (pages 19 – 23).

=== De profundis ===
* '''Start Polski (Poland's beginning)'''
This chapter is in memory of the destruction of Polish lands as a result of World War I and other military conflicts, such as the [[Polish–Soviet War]]. Compared to France, where only the northeastern provinces were devastated, the Great War resulted in widespread destruction of almost the entire territory of the [[Second Polish Republic]]. In 1914 - 1921, almost two million buildings were destroyed, together with 56% of the rolling stock, 64% of railway stations, 390 larger and 2019 smaller bridges. Losses to Polish industry were estimated at 1 billion 800 million [[zloty]]s, four and half million [[hectare]]s of land were left uncultivated, 4 million head of cattle were killed, 3 million people were forced to leave their homes, 130 million cubic meters of timber were taken out of Poland. According to the [[Polish census of 1921]], thousands of people were forced to live in 75,000 cowsheds, pigsties and shacks. "War has brought destruction to all the provinces of Poland, except for those which had belonged to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (...) Starving people read with disbelief in the newspapers that as part of [[World War I reparations]], even transports of German beehives headed towards France (...) We have inherited a divided, destroyed Poland, whose lands had for almost 150 years belonged to three different countries (see [[Partitions of Poland]]). We have been given a Fatherland moulded out of our traditions, language and the love of our hearts. But economically, it was but a mix of the neglected borderlands of the three foreign nations" (page 31).

Wańkowicz recalls an epidemic of [[typhus]] and [[cholera]], which took place in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1921. At that time, Polish government created [[Cordon sanitaire|a 40 to 60 kilometer wide barrier implemented to stop the spread of disease]], along the Polish - Soviet border. One of the biggest [[quarantine]] centers was at [[Baranowicze]], where 10,000 people were treated daily, and 40,000 kilograms of clothes were washed every day. Altogether, 182 Polish doctors and nurses died at the Baranowicze quarantine center, and in 1923, a monument dedicated to them was unveiled there: "Over the dead bodies, we headed towards the reconstruction of Poland" (page 37).

* '''''Start COP-u'' (The COP beginnings)'''
In this chapter, Wańkowicz describes his pre-World War I adventures, when with friends he hiked across the future [[Central Industrial Area]], which before 1914 had been divided between the [[Russian Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]]. Those lands, the heart of Poland, had nothing in common: "Eighty per cent of our rail traffic just serves the triangle of [[Upper Silesia]] - [[Warsaw]] - [[Lwów]]. This triangle is empty inside (...) The distance between [[Vistula]] river bridges can reach up to 70 kilometers. The population of the center of Poland, the area bounded by the [[Pilica (river)|Pilica]], the [[Bug River|Bug]] rivers and the [[Beskids]] mountain range, which amounts 5 million people, is suffocating due to unemployment and small farms. [[Urbanization]] had not taken place in those borderlands of Russia and Austria-Hungary. In the [[Central Industrial Area]], 418,000 people are simply redundant. They may go away, but where to? (...) The Central part of Poland is just rotting. As Marshal [[Józef Piłsudski]] once said, Poland is like a [[bagel]], in which anything good lies on the edges. And along these edges we have hostile neighbours" (pages 41 – 47)

Wańkowicz reminds the reader that other nations had also decided to move their industrial centers away from borders. [[Soviet Union]] located its main factories in the [[Urals]], and [[Nazi Germany]] in the area between the [[Weser]] and the [[Elbe]]. "This land, forgotten by God, we shall lift up through the Central Industrial Area, and the Area itself shall be surrounded by highly developed agriculture" (page 52).

* '''''Smok pod polską Weroną'' (A dragon afoot in Poland's Verona)'''
The Polish symbolic and metaphorical [[Verona]] is the historic town of [[Sandomierz]], which, according to the plans, was to become the capital of the Central Industrial Area, and of the projected [[Sandomierz Voivodeship (1939)]]. Similar to Verona (Italy), Sandomierz was famous for its [[Renaissance architecture]] but little else. "Nothing has changed here since I visited this town as a kid..." (Wańkowicz). However, the town's location was excellent, as distances to other industrial towns in the region were equally close including [[Nisko]], [[Opatów]], [[Kielce]], [[Radom]], [[Lublin]], [[Łańcut]], [[Dębica]] and [[Pińczów]] (pp.&amp;nbsp;55–58).

The chapter describes the current and a potential future of Sandomierz, with new investments, estimated at almost 7 million [[zloty]]s. "Meanwhile I do not see any changes in Sandomierz, and neither would [[Berke]] see them, whose forces in 1260 faced some 8,000 residents of the town; the same population as now (...) Sandomierz is such a careless town. The seat of the voivode and of the local [[Polish Army]] infantry division is in Kielce. The Provincial court, rail and forest management offices are in Radom. School district in Ostrowiec. Post office district management in Lublin, insurance office in Tarnobrzeg, tax office in Opatów, and even the rail station lies on the eastern shore of the Vistula, in a different [[Lwów Voivodeship|province]]. It is touching to watch this careless chaos, to watch the old order of things, knowing that the future will change it all for good (...) Admirers of the Polish Verona may sleep well" (pages 58 – 61).

=== ''Ujarzmianie wody'' (Taming of the waters) ===
* Z kałuży - rzeka
This chapter is dedicated to [[hydropower]], and different means of obtaining energy from water. Wańkowicz recollects the disastrous [[1934 flood in Poland]], which caused damages estimated at 75 million [[zloty]]s. One year after the disaster, construction of the [[Dunajec]] river dam and a power plant began at the village of [[Rożnów, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Rożnów]], near the site of a medieval castle. According to the plans from the 1930s, the government of the [[Second Polish Republic]] envisaged construction of 27 [[reservoir]]s in the [[Vistula]] Basin, and 19 reservoirs in the [[Dniestr]] Basin. Wańkowicz himself visited the Rożnów Dam construction site in the autumn of 1938, and the book contains several photos from that visit.

Further on, the chapter tells about future plans for the Vistula river. Wańkowicz predicts that the Vistula would emerge as the most important trade corridor of Poland. To make it happen, the largest river of Poland would have to be deepened and regulated. As the author writes, the three most important public works projects of Poland are: [[Gdynia]], [[Central Industrial Area]], and the Vistula: "To connect the Vistula with the Central Area, by regulating the whole length of the river. To make it happen, we need 20 million [zlotys] every year for 30 years (...) Meanwhile, a lot will happen in the Central Area. The plans specify regulation of the Vistula from [[Oświęcim]] to [[Sandomierz]] (...) In the fields near [[Koprzywnica]], hundreds of workers toil. They are the unemployed, brought here from [[Częstochowa]]. Those with [[wagon]]s are the so-called ''Dutchmen''; the inhabitants of the village of ''Zabuże'' (near [[Sokal]]). Their ancestors came to Poland to escape [[religious persecution]]. They are talented at [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthwork]], and are seen all over the Central Area" (pages 68 – 94).

=== Stalowa Wola (Steel Will) ===
Wańkowicz begins this chapter by recollecting the [[Polish–Soviet War]] of 1919 - 1920. In late July 1920, he visited the [[Free City of Danzig]], witnessing a British steamboat ''Triton'', filled with weapons and ammunition for the [[Polish Army]]. German-speaking longshoremen at the Port of Danzig refused to unload it, while the Czechoslovaks would not let rail transports pass through their country. At that time, as Wańkowicz wrote, Poland was "a nation, which did not have its own seaport and its own [[arms industry]]" (page 96). [[Gdynia]] was built after the humiliation of 1920, and in the late 1930s, Poland initiated the construction of, as Wańkowicz named it, the ''Polish [[Magnitogorsk]]''.

[[Stalowa Wola]] was built from scratch, 35 kilometers from [[Sandomierz]], 6 kilometers from [[Rozwadów]], and 11 kilometers from [[Nisko]], in the ''perfect center'' of the Central Industrial Area. 600 hectares of land were built for the project, which took place in the village of ''Pławo''. The first pine tree was cut down on March 20, 1937: "Now, there is a row of [[pavilion]]s, with newly built rail connections. We are standing in one of these houses, whose roof covers the area of two [[hectare]]s. Altogether, some nine hectares will be under roofs (...) The plant will receive three kinds of energy: electric, gas and coal". (page 101)

The construction of ''Southern Works'', as [[Huta Stalowa Wola]] was called, gave employment to 2,500 people, additional 1,500 built the town: "We do not have any [[Vickers]], [[Armstrong Whitworth|Armstrongs]], or [[Schneider Electric|Schneiders]]. We work using Polish factories. Here, ''Zgoda, Zieleniewski, Ostrowiec'', and ''Jenike'' shook hands (...) The plant will employ 4,000, new settlement, with sewer system, laundries, baths, casinos and sports facilities is being built. The settlement will be located around the plant, so that workers should reach the factory as quickly and as easily as possible". (pages 103 - 104)

Wańkowicz reminds that since the [[November Uprising]] (1831), no arms plant had been built in any part of the [[Partitions of Poland|divided Poland]]: "We had neither gold to purchase weapons, nor roads for the transport of them (...) We dreamt about a fully independent Poland, and the idea of [[Old-Polish Industrial Region]] was brought back (...) The creators of new Poland will need strong will, the willingness to complete all plans. Therefore, the idea to give the name ''Stalowa Wola'' [Steel Will] to the town which will manufacture steel, was a fortunate one". (pages 106 - 112)

=== ''Siekiera - motyka - piłka - kleszcze'' (Axe, Hoe)===
The chapter begins with the description of [[Rzeszów]], the town which used to be called ''the [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]n [[Jerusalem]]''. As part of [[Austria-Hungary]], it was dirt poor and destitute, like the whole province of Galicia: "Now, a convoy of shiny [[Buick]]s and [[Fiat]]s enters Rzeszów, together with three buses of [[Polish State Railways]]. We are heading towards the enormous complex of the ''Polskie Zakłady Lotnicze'' [Polish Aviation Works] factory of plane engines. The factory occupies the area of 21 hectares, and will employ 2,000 (...) Next we are going to see the [[H. Cegielski – Poznań]] branch plant [now Zelmer Rzeszów], located at the other end of the town. Construction of the ''Cegielski'' factory began on April 20, 1937, in an old Austrian armoury (...) Poland needs [[machine tool]]s for some 30 million [[zloty]]s a year, while national production reaches 7 million zlotys (...) Rzeszów turns into an industrialized town. Its fathers now have to think about new flats for workers, waterworks and sewages, power plant, shops, schools, hospital, bridge and green areas. When I leave Rzeszów, I see the monument of Colonel [[Leopold Lis-Kula]]". (pages 115 - 124)

=== ''Siedzi sobie ruda pod miedzą - geolodzy o niej już wiedzą'' (Ore at the baulk: geologists can tell) ===
This chapter discusses the need to establish Poland's own resources of [[iron ore]]. Wańkowicz states that [[Nazi Germany]] after the [[Anschluss]] seized the [[Erzberg mine]], with 300 million tons of iron ore, out of which several military products are made. In the ancient times, iron ore was excavated in the [[Świętokrzyskie Mountains]], "Now [early 1939], southern corner of Poland is full of posters, urging residents to hand any heavy stones found by them to the government, in exchange of 5 [[zloty]]s (...) A farmer named Boroń, who resides in [[Gogołów, Podkarpackie Voivodeship|Gogołów]] near [[Frysztak]], sent a stone which was rich in iron. The government sent experts, handing Boroń additional 1,000 zlotys reward for his finding. They established the iron ore deposits here, and now are considering further examination of the area (...) And when we look at the roads crowded with people, when we look at the Jews, minding their own businesses, we realize that we are one of the most densely populated nations of Europe. That this population density is not based on industry or commerce, but on poverty. And we see this country in ten years, through the eyes of our young engineers" (pages 132 - 151).

=== ''Opona z kartofla'' (Synthetic rubber) ===
Wańkowicz begins this chapter by recalling his first sight of an [[automobile]], which took place in [[Kraków]], in the early 20th century. [[Natural rubber]] has been in rising demand since early days of the automobile industry, and in plantations across the world, in [[Brazil]], the Congo or [[Liberia]], locals were being slaughtered by Westerners searching for [[rubber trees]]. In 1938, the world used one million tons of natural rubbers, for the estimated 40 million vehicles, 80% of which were owned by Americans. Poland, with a fledgling automobile industry, also needed natural rubber, the purchase of which was difficult and expensive. The only solution was [[synthetic rubber]] (pages 154 - 156).

Wańkowicz recalls first Polish attempts at creating synthetic rubber, and compares them to the Germans, working at [[IG Farben]], as well as Soviet efforts of the early 1930s. Due to the work of such persons, as minister [[Wojciech Świętosławski]], Professor Kazimierz Kling and Wacław Szukiewicz of Warsaw's ''Chemical Research Institute'', Polish synthetic rubber made from potatoes, and called ''KER'' (an [[acronym]] for ''Kauczuk ERytrenowy''), was produced in 1935. In August 1938, ''Chemical Works S.A.'' (currently ''Polifarb Dębica'') was opened in the village of Pustynia near [[Dębica]]. The ready product was used by another factory, which was opened in the late 1930s in the same town - ''Tire Company Stomil Dębica'' (which currently is owned by the [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company]]).

=== ''Siły pod ziemią'' (Minerals under the earth) ===
* [[Ignacy Łukasiewicz|Łukasiewiczowe]] bogactwo
In this chapter Wańkowicz recalls his childhood, spent in the village of Nowotrzeby, located in Polish [[Kresy|Eastern Borderlands]]. Since there was no electricity, light was provided by several [[kerosene lamp]]s. As late as 1938, such lamps were a rarity in several regions of the [[Second Polish Republic]].

Among pioneers of kerosene industry were such names, as Abraham Schreiner, [[Ignacy Łukasiewicz]], and Jan Zeh. Due to their work, first kerosene lamps were lit in the municipal hospital of the city of [[Lwów]], in 1853. It was Łukasiewicz who opened first [[oil well]] ''Małgorzata'' in Polish lands. His well was 180 meters deep, and was located at the village of [[Jaszczew]]. Next came oil refinery at the village of ''Polanka'', which now is a district of [[Krosno]] (pages 174 - 182). In 1881, a [[Canada|Canadian]] resident William H. McGarvey came to Austrian [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]. Among other places, he worked at [[Boryslav|Borysław]], which, as Wańkowicz put it, in the 1890s was ''a Polish [[Klondike Gold Rush|Klondike]]''. McGarvey cooperated with a man named Władysław Długosz (who would in the future work for the ''National Oil Association of Poland''), and due to their efforts, as well as many other entrepreneurs, the production of oil in Galicia, mostly in Borysław, Krosno, Słoboda Rungurska and Schodnica near Lwów, reached 2 million tons in 1909. In that year, some 10,000 people were employed in Galicia's oil industry. After the peak, oil prices went down, which resulted in a number of bankruptcies. Before World War I, Galicia produced app. 3% of world's oil (pages 182 - 192).

Following World War I, the [[Polish–Ukrainian War]] broke out in eastern Galicia. Oil wells of the region were of particular importance, and on Sunday, May 17, 1919, the suburbs of [[Drohobycz]] were captured by a mounted company of 180 men, led by Colonel [[Stanisław Maczek]]. After a battle with the Ukrainians, the cities of Drohobycz and nearby Borysław were seized by the Poles on the next day: "Polish lands were destroyed, powerless and fallow. And here, we had gold in our hands. In those years, we bought everything for that oil, even beans from [[Yugoslavia]]" (page 192).

* ''Gazownię - zbudował sam Pan Bóg'' (Natural gas plant made by God himself)
This chapter is dedicated to [[natural gas]], and the history of its exploration in Polish lands. Wańkowicz writes that when in 1890 gas was found in Potok, (a village between [[Krosno]] and [[Jasło]]), the locals thought of it as a misfortune, and poured water on the source: "As late as 1932, when I came to [[Stryi|Stryj]] on a sunny midday, I noticed with surprise that all street lamps were turned on (...) Local people explained to me that it did not make any sense to turn off the lamps, as they were fueled by natural gas, which was free" (page 198). First Polish pipeline was built in 1912. It was 9 kilometers long, and went from Borysław to the refinery at Drohobycz. In 1921, a natural gas well was opened at Daszawa near Stryj, and in 1928, the [[Polmin]] corporation opened a pipeline from Daszawa to Drohobycz, later reaching Lwów. Several new pipelines were opened in eastern Galicia in the mid-1930s, and in 1937, a 200-kilometer pipeline connected [[Roztoki, Podkarpackie Voivodeship|Roztoki]] with [[Starachowice]]: "Currently, new lines to [[Radom]], [[Pionki]], [[Nisko]] and [[Skarżysko-Kamienna]] are being built" (page 205).

* ''Polski Dawid i angielski Goliat'' (Polish David and English Goliath)
Before World War I, Polish [[coal mining]] was divided between three countries. [[Upper Silesia]] served the [[German Empire]], [[Zagłębie Dąbrowskie]] sold its coal to the [[Ukraine]] (part of [[Russian Empire]]), and the ''[[Kraków]] Coal Basin'' was part of [[Austria-Hungary]]. Altogether, in 1914, 40 million tons of [[coal]] were excavated in the divided Polish lands. After the war, however, Polish coal lost its markets. Production remained high, still at 40 million tons, while demand in the newly created [[Second Polish Republic]] was some 18 million tons. The only solution was to export Polish coal, but by 1925, Poland exported only .5 million tons a year: "The [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|coal strike in England]] came in 1926, at the best possible time for Poland, but we had no means to transport our coal to [[Scandinavia]], which had been main market of British coal. [[Gdynia]] was not ready yet, the [[Free City of Danzig]] was out of question, and the [[Polish Coal Trunk-Line]] was not completed (...) So, a Polish [[David]] was facing a British [[Goliath]]" (pages 208 - 211).

To reach the lucrative Scandinavian markets, Polish merchants travelled north, trying to convince the Scandinavians to purchase Polish coal. Furthermore, after the general strike had ended in the United Kingdom, the British wanted to return to Scandinavia with their coal. In 1931, Great Britain dropped the [[gold standard]], which resulted in lower export prices for their products. In response, the Polish government opened a special offset fund, valued at 5 million [[zloty]]s. Both sides decided to enter negotiations, which took place simultaneously at Warsaw and London. Finally, a treaty was signed in 1934, with further changes in 1937 (pages 211 - 216).

Wańkowicz himself went to [[Giszowiec]], a district of [[Katowice]], to see with his own eyes the process of coal mining. Together with the manager of a local coal mine, engineer Michejda, he went 400 meters underground: "I will never let my wife enter a coal mine, says one of the engineers. You never know what may happen at any moment (...) There are many dangers at a coal mine. Apart from [[rock burst]], there is water and natural gas. Therefore, managers of the mine are in constant struggle with these elements (...) I am leaving industrial [[Upper Silesia]], driving my car towards [[Cieszyn]]. Behind me stays a [[Polyphemus]] of the Polish lands. East of it, a new center of power is being built - the Central Industrial Area (pages 216 - 224).

=== ''Z Polski leśnej i polnej w Polskę zbrojną i przemysłową'' (From rural to industrial Poland) ===
Wańkowicz begins this chapter by recalling the destruction, caused by the senseless de-forestation in the northeastern portion of the Second Polish Republic (currently this area belongs to [[Belarus]]). By the late 1930s, due to the invention of [[cellulose]], Polish forests ceased to be depleted. A brand new cellulose factory was opened in the town of [[Niedomice]], 15 kilometers from [[Tarnów]]. The factory was built from July 1935 to November 1937, on an 80-hectare plot of wet meadow, purchased from the [[Sanguszko family]]: "The Niedomice plant daily uses 50,000 [[cubic meter]]s of water from the [[Dunajec]], while the city of [[Warsaw]] uses 80,000 cubic meters of water (...) It processes [[spruce]] from the [[Carpathians]] and the [[Kresy]], and among its products there is [[silk]]. Furthermore, thanks to the existence of the Niedomice plant, we will no longer have to import [[nitrocellulose]], as it will be replaced by Polish-made [[cellulose]] (...) And when I look at the mighty machines, crushing the immense tree trunks into little splinters, I think of the wasteful economy of the past generations, and I am thankful that there is a provident hand, which begins to rule the Polish national household". (pages 226 - 240)

=== ''Plon niesiemy, plon'' (Harvest we gather) ===
This chapter is dedicated to [[nitrogen]], [[nitrate]]s, and their importance in as fertilizers in agriculture. Wańkowicz visits a large nitrogen plant located in [[Mościce]] (''Zjednoczone Fabryki Związków Azotowych Mościce''), reminding his readers that the Mościce plant is a younger "brother" of the [[Chorzów]] Nitrogen Works (which were opened in 1915 as ''Oberschlesische Stickstoffwerke'', in then-German Konigshutte).

On June 15, 1922, following the [[Silesian Uprisings]], units of the [[Polish Army]] entered the so-called ''Eastern Upper Silesia'', which became the [[Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship]]. Among numerous plants and enterprises that came under Polish control, was the modern ''Oberschlesische Stickstoffwerke'' plant, the brainchild of [[Nikodem Caro]]. Polish experts, headed by [[Ignacy Mościcki]], were surprised to find all 196 German specialists abandon their posts. Furthermore, the Germans took with them all documents and specifications of the plant. All left Poland for the nearby [[Bytom|Beuthen]], awaiting the collapse of the plant under inexperienced Polish leadership. To make matters worse, those German workers that remained in Chorzów carried out acts of [[sabotage]].

In April 1923, [[Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski]], together with Adam Podoski, came to Chorzów. By then, almost all workers had been replaced, and the new, Polish-speaking crew brought the production to the pre-1921 level. Poles concentrated their efforts at manufacturing [[calcium cyanamide]], which in the 1920s and 1930s was commonly used as a fertilizer. In 1923, 39,000 tons of calcium cyanide was produced at Chorzów; by 1929, the production grew to 166,000 tons. Still, it was not enough for the Polish agriculture, so construction of a new plant at Mościce near [[Tarnów]] was initiated by a number of specialists from Chorzów, headed by Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski (pages 240 - 254).

=== ''Sztafeta dziejów'' (Relay race of history) ===
Wańkowicz begins this chapter by reminding the readers that [[Second Polish Republic]] is a very poor country, which is confirmed on each page of the Polish Statistical Yearbook. Poland, however used to be a rich country, which lost is wealth and capital due to the stupidity of the [[szlachta|Polish nobility]], which did not invest the money and did not have any plans concerning national economy, preferring to spend its funds on expensive clothes and oriental specialties. "Let us compare what other nations did after the discovery of America. In Holland mighty plants were opened, which manufactured various goods and exported them all over the world. France invested large sums of money in infrastructure, such as [[Canal du Midi]], army and navy (...) At the same time the nobility in Poland spent its money on never ending balls and parties (...) [[Aleksander Bruckner]] writes that day after day at the [[Lubomirski family]] residence at [[Dubno]], 300 people partied, that rivers of gold flew at [[Annopol]] of the [[Jabłonowski family]], [[Tuchyn|Tuczyn]] of the [[Walewski family]], [[Korets|Korzec]] of the [[Czartoryski family]], [[Slavuta|Sławuta]] of the [[Sanguszko family]]". (pages 267 - 270)

Despite some positive changes, the economy of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] continued to deteriorate in the 18th century. In 1777, Polish banks spent one million zlotys a month purchasing luxurious imported goods from [[Paris]]: "[[Piotr Fergusson Tepper]] once said that annually, Poland imports 36,000 barrels of wine from [[Hungary]], and that it was easier to find Polish currency in Paris than in Warsaw. This whole economy of Polish elites resulted in bankruptcies and poverty. As [[Jędrzej Kitowicz]] writes, there was such a shortage of money in Poland, that in circulation were coins manufactured during the reign of King [[Jan Kazimierz]]. And then [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] times came, marked by the total decline of the Polish economy. The population of Warsaw dropped from 200,000 to 60,000, and foreigners compared it to [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Carthage]]". (page 274)

The situation began to improve after the creation of [[Congress Poland]], due to the efforts of [[Stanisław Staszic]], when iron plants were opened between [[Radom]] and [[Sandomierz]], at [[Suchedniów]] and [[Końskie]] (see also [[Old-Polish Industrial Region]]). Failure of the [[November Uprising]] stopped the development of Congress Poland, but soon afterwards Piotr Steinkeller initiated a program of industrialization and modernization: "A few years passed after the defeat of 1831. Railroads had been constructed, [[Russian Empire]] opened to the Polish goods, and for the first time in years, we managed to halt the decline. But it did not last for long. The [[January Uprising]], which cost our nation 20,000 dead, 50,000 sent to [[Siberia]], once again destroyed our economic future". (page 287)

=== ''Wyprawa po jeńców elektrycznych'' (Expedition for the electrical captives) ===
This chapter is dedicated to [[electricity]] and [[electrification]] of Poland. In 1921, after Poland regained independence, the average citizen of the nation used 7.5 [[watt]]s of [[power (physics)|power]], with the Polish part of [[Upper Silesia]] using 82 watts per person. Given the fact that at the same time, there were nations which used more than 2,000 watts per person, Poland's electrification was nonexistent: "And now we are standing in a power plant at [[Mościce]] (...) Currently, the price of one [[kilowatt hour]] of energy in Warsaw is 60 [[grosz]]y, but when construction of power plants and power lines is completed, the price will go down to 15 groszy. In 1940, the cheap energy will reach Warsaw, before that, cheap energy will reach [[Starachowice]] and [[Rzeszów]]". (pages 304 - 312)

=== ''Na co koza rogi ma'' (Why do goats have horns) ===
Wańkowicz goes on to remind the reader that overpopulation was one of major problems of the Second Polish Republic: "Ten million people do not have enough food and do not have a permanent job. Ten million unemployed only in the countryside without those from urban communities (...) They are a dead material, which has to be fed, which has to work, which has to go beyond simple animalistic needs (...) Eighty per cent of Poland lies outside of the Central Industrial Area. These people dream about the COP, awaiting a better future" (page 314). The author cites letters, which were sent to him from different parts of the country. An [[osadnik]] named Kostrzewski, from the village of Chocieńczyce (near [[Wilejka]]), writes: "I am surprised by the fact that the Soviets make great propaganda about their [[Dneprostroi]], while a book about Polish efforts is being published only now". (page 316).

In the summer 1938 Wańkowicz visited the village of [[Zaleszany, Podkarpackie Voivodeship|Zaleszany]], near [[Sandomierz]]. On a Sunday after the service local residents left church to watch construction of a pipeline: "Among the crowd watching the construction site, nobody knows what these pipes are for and who needs them. These are the people who worked for 80 [[grosz]] a day. They have all their constitutional rights, they elect the government, but they have no idea about the pipes". (page 319) According to Wańkowicz, the most important category of laborers in the eyes of the locals are [[welder]]s. They make up to 600 zlotys a month: "These welders, mostly young guys, are dressed like [[Primadonna]]s. Four of them rent a house, they come from different parts of Poland: [[Boryslav|Borysław]], [[Lwów]], [[Zagłębie Dąbrowskie]], and [[Warszawa]]. [[Sett (paving)|sett]] pavers come to the Central Industrial Area from [[Gdynia]], earth workers from the area of the [[Bug river]], [[Fitter (occupation)|fitters]] are from [[Upper Silesia]] and Warsaw, [[bricklayer]]s come from [[Ivyanets|Iwieniec]], and qualified metal workers are from [[Poznań]] and [[Radom]]. Thus, all hands from across Poland are building her heart".(pages 318 - 319).

Melchior Wańkowicz emphasizes the fact that increasing number of laborers, coming to the Central Industrial Area, means that their children attend local schools, which are not prepared for such an influx of new pupils: "Within a few months, 150 new children flooded a school at [[Ćmielów]]. At Denków [now a district of [[Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski]]], 600 kids study in two shifts in one crowded schoolhouse (...) Within a few months, 1,000 Poles expelled from [[France]] with their children settled in [[Iłża]] County. [[Radom]] itself needs at least seven new schools (...) And what with [[Mielec]], which is expanding quickly, but no news of any new schools? What about [[Nowa Dęba|Rozalin]], what about [[Kraśnik]], where a brand new town is being built near the old one?" (pages 326 - 329)

=== Arterioskleroza ===
This chapter is dedicated to different kinds of communication - railroads, roads, [[telecommunication]], and airplanes. To operate, a modern plant needs three things: electricity, natural gas and coal. In the Second Polish Republic, deposits of coal were located in southwestern corner of the country, some 250 kilometers from Central Industrial Area. It had to be brought to central Poland in a quick and cheap way.  
* Krwiobieg
Wańkowicz interviewed deputy Minister of Communications, Konrad Piasecki, who promised that in the six coming years, Polish government would annually spend on communication 60 million zlotys: "40,000 meters of spruce from the area of [[Wilno]] are annually transported to the plant at [[Niedomice]]. These transports have to travel 112 extra kilometers, as there is no rail line from [[Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski]] to [[Szczucin]] (...) Iron ore has been found near [[Jasło]]. It will be delivered to ''Southern Works'' at [[Stalowa Wola]], travelling 207 kilometers, instead of 123 kilometers, as there is no rail connection between Jasło and [[Dębica]]. These are just a few examples, as everyone knows that construction is impossible in the areas with no roads and no rail transport".(pages 340 - 344)

In the late 1910s, the newly born Second Polish Republic had no common rail system, as it was made of rail systems of three powers that had divided Poland ([[Russian Empire]], [[German Empire]], [[Austria-Hungary]]). Different were tracks, signals, brakes, engines, cars, regulations, tariffs and tools. Rail transport suffered from [[World War One]] destruction, yet it not  only had to support [[Polish Army]] units, but also civilian population. Everything was improvised, and in  the [[Polish-Soviet War|1920]], the nation was invaded. The Soviets were close to capturing 220 engines and 7,560 cars, which were being withdrawn westwards. In six weeks, Polish rail workers managed to turn 400 kilometers of [[Russian gauge]] track into the [[standard gauge]] (from [[Baranowicze]] to [[Dęblin]]), thus saving Polish rolling stock. In the first years of the Second Polish Republic, rail transport was very difficult; it took 22 hours to travel from Warsaw to Wilno, due to a destroyed bridge near [[Grodno]]: "Now, the prophecy of [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]] is becoming reality. The developer of the [[Suez Canal]] stated that Warsaw would emerge as major rail hub of Europe, as here three international lines meet: [[Paris]] - [[Berlin]] - Warsaw - [[Moscow]]; [[Gdynia]] - Warsaw - [[Lwów]] - [[Balkan Peninsula]]; [[Helsinki]] - [[Riga]] - [[Wilno]] - Warsaw - [[Katowice]] - southern Europe". (pages 343 - 349)

* ''Unerwienie'' (The central nervous system)
In 1938, there were 250,000 telephones in Poland. To speed up the process of modernization of Polish telecommunication, a brand new telephone equipment factory was being built at [[Poniatowa]], which was planned to give employment to 4,000 people. By the end of 1937, 720 kilometers of long distance cable connections had been laid, connecting Sandomierz with [[Kielce]], [[Rzeszów]], [[Rozwadów]], [[Tarnobrzeg]] and [[Lublin]]. Completion of cable connection between Warsaw and Sandomierz was planned for late 1939, and in 1940, Warsaw was to receive long-distance cable connection with Lwów. (pages 353 - 358)

* ''Do lamusa z koczobrykami''
This chapter is dedicated to air transport. Wańkowicz writes that the ''National Meteorological Institute'' (''Państwowy Instytut Meteorologiczny'') has 160 co-workers, scattered across Poland. They make weather reports, updated every few hours, reporting them by telegraph or telephone to the central office in Warsaw: "Our [[Baltic Sea]] shore makes only 2.5% of our borderline. But nobody will smother us by our neck, when there are wings in our arms". (pages 359 - 368)
 
The first Polish long-distance international flight took place in 1926, when Captain [[Bolesław Orliński]], together with his mechanic, Leon Kubiak, flew from Warsaw to [[Tokyo]], and back. In February 1927, Tadeusz Karpiński asked for permission to fly over the [[Atlantic]], but did not receive it. The 1932 [[Challenge International de Tourisme 1932|Challenge International de Tourisme]] was won by [[Franciszek Żwirko]] and [[Stanisław Wigura]], both of whom died in a plane crash in the same year. Three weeks after their death, Tadeusz Karpiński flies 14,000 kilometers in a [[Plage i Laśkiewicz|Lublin R-X]] plane from Warsaw to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], through [[Syria]], [[Persia]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]]. In 1934, [[Adamowicz brothers|Joe and Ben Adamowicz]] flew over the Atlantic.

In the 1930s, [[Balloon (aircraft)|ballooning]] was very popular in Poland, with such personalities as pilot Franciszek Hynek and navigator [[Zbigniew Burzyński]], both of whom twice won the [[Gordon Bennett Cup (ballooning)|Gordon Bennett Cup]]. Wańkowicz recalls the 1935 Cup, which took place in Warsaw. Burzyński, together with Colonel Władysław Wysocki, flew far into Soviet territory, and were attacked by the [[Soviet Air Force]] planes. Finally, they landed near the [[Don River (Russia)|Don river]], crossing 1,650 kilometers in 57 hours and 54 minutes. Apart from long-distance balloon flights, Polish pilots tried to break the high altitude world record, but the [[Gwiazda Polski]] balloon burned on October 14, 1938.

"The time is near, when we will be making our own large passenger planes. Our first prototype of such machine, the [[PZL.44 Wicher]], apparently is better, faster and more spacious than the [[Douglas DC-2]]. Not a single month passes without news about our pilots. Now, we should think about the youth. We should make flying common among them! (...) We already have the [[sailplane]] high altitude world record of Kazimierz Antoniak (3,435 meters). We have women's sailplane long distance world record of Wanda Modlibowska (24 hours and 14 minutes), and finally, we have the 1938 [[Lilienthal Gliding Medal]], granted to [[Tadeusz Góra]] for his May 18, 1938 flight from [[Bezmiechowa Górna]] to [[Soleczniki]] (577,8 kilometers). (...) Currently, the [[Airborne and Antigas Defence League]] has 1,7 million members, which makes 5% of Poland's population". (pages 380 - 382)

=== Gdynia - świat ===
* To nie Somosierra morska
Wańkowicz begins this chapter by analyzing what the notion of independence means: "Are the [[Philippines]] or [[Cuba]] more independent than the [[Irish Free State]], because their governments are more free?" The author then goes on to recall the [[Polish–Soviet War]], when in 1920 all land borders of the newly restored Poland were closed down, and the German longshoremen at [[Danzig]] did not want to help with unloading transports of ammunition for the fighting nation: "Where was our independence, when after the Bolshevik war we wanted to sell first 100,000 tons of our cement, and foreign ship-owners, influenced by foreign cement makers, did not want to transport it, and we did not have our ships?"

The [[Second Polish Republic]] had only 74 kilometers of [[Baltic Sea]] shoreline. In the [[Middle Ages]], Poland ruled a much wider shoreline, with such ports, as Gdańsk, [[Kołobrzeg]], [[Kamień Pomorski]], [[Szczecin]] (Wańkowicz spells it ''Szczucin''), [[Wolin]]. Wańkowicz recalls Polish efforts at keeping its sea connections, such as [[Pomerania]]n wars of [[Bolesław III Wrymouth]], and Poland's failure, when in 1598 King [[Sigismund III Vasa]], after receiving 300,000 [[zloty]]s from the [[Sejm]], set on to the [[Kingdom of Sweden]] with a fleet of 60 ships, and an army of 5,000 (see: [[War against Sigismund]]).

"We failed at sea. It served us across centuries, but somebody else transported goods from Poland (...) In 1920, the English ship "Triton" stood on the [[Motława]], filled with ammunition for the bleeding country. It stood there motionless, as Danzig did not allow it to be unloaded. And at the same time, Polish authorities began looking for a spot for the construction of a new port" (pages 384–388).

Finally, [[Gdynia]] was chosen, the very same spot mentioned by [[Hetman]] [[Stanisław Koniecpolski]], who wrote to King [[Władysław IV Vasa]], stating that it was a very convenient location for a sea port: "Now, if [[Stefan Żeromski]] was still alive, we would take him here. We would show him the 12-kilometer long [[wharf]], the giant warehouses with total area of 217,000 sq. m., the [[granary]], the 75 cranes (...) The total tonnage of our [[merchant navy]] grew from 9,000 tons in 1927, to 100,000 tons in 1938 (...) We need Gdynia like all humans need lungs. Right now, 75% of our foreign trade goes through this city. In case of a war, we will need it more than anything else. Our merchant navy, our transport navy needs protection. It is our new task. First we needed a port. Then we needed ships. Now we need to defend them". (pages 388–397)
* Hejże na śledzia!
This chapter describes Wańkowicz's visit to Gdynia, which took place in early May 1938. He witnessed the [[May 3rd Constitution Day]] parade, after which he left for [[Sopot]], which belonged to the [[Free City of Danzig]]. After a dinner, he visits Danzig, noticing its empty port, as all sea transport was headed for Gdynia. After returning to Poland, Wańkowicz goes to [[Władysławowo]], which was then called Wielka Wieś. A new fishing port was officially opened on May 6, 1938. Wańkowicz witnessed the ceremony, led by Bishop Stanisław Okoniewski: "Silent waters spread in front of our eyes. They are enclosed by two [[pier]]s. The western one is 763 meters long, the eastern one is 320 meters long. The port has enough space for 100 fishing vessels". (pages 404–413) 
* Dziura w stołku
This chapter begins with a reflection on the general condition of Poland in the late 1930s: "This nation grows by half a million a year, but we do not have space for such growth. One third of us, 10 million people, live their wretched existence on small farms, with the size not larger than one and a half hectare (...) One third of the nation rots physically and morally. They cannot afford education, food, new equipment. How can we go forward with all this?" (pages 419–421)

Wańkowicz mentions those Poles who travelled and succeeded abroad: [[Krzysztof Arciszewski]] (a vice-governor of [[Dutch Brazil]]), [[Maurycy Beniowski]] (ruler of a community in [[Madagascar]]), French Navy Captain Adam Mierosławski, [[Paweł Strzelecki]] (geologist and explorer), [[Ignacy Domeyko]] (geologist and educator, who spent most of his live in [[Chile]]), Bronisław Rymkiewicz (engineer, who built the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] river port at [[Manaus]]), [[Ernest Malinowski]] (who constructed a railway in the [[Peru]]vian [[Andes]]), [[Benedykt Dybowski]] (naturalist and physician), [[Nikolay Przhevalsky|Mikołaj Przewalski]] (explorer of Central [[Asia]]), and many others. The author goes on to remind the readers that to cope with the problem of overpopulation, Poland needs [[Colonialism|colonies]]: "This nation wants to live and at the same time, it suffocates itself from population explosion (...) When other European nations conquered faraway lands, Poland protected the European - Asian borderline, fighting and bleeding along the boundary of two worlds. Then we [[Partitions of Poland|lost independence]], at a time when other European nations conquered most territory (...) Now, the wave of hungry nations is rising again, against those rich nations, which control world trade and which possess overseas empires. Forty per cent of our import is made of colonial goods, without which we cannot survive. Now, we understand why colonies are so important to Poland". (pages 422–430)

"We understand that it is a difficult task, but it also is a necessity, without which there is no development of Poland. We understand that nobody will give the colonies to us for free, that we are a poor nation, that other nations did not get their colonies for free, either. England fought many colonial wars, sending 20 million people abroad in the last 100 years. And we have people here, they are our treasure, but for now, they are our biggest misfortune. We should remember that everything depends on us, on our minds". (pages 430–432)

=== Nie mów COP - nim nie przeskoczysz ===
Between autumn of 1937, and autumn of 1938, Wańkowicz visited the Central Industrial Area (''COP'') five times. This chapter is dedicated to his last visit before publishing the book. It took place on November 16–19, 1938. Wańkowicz wants to silence those who criticize the very idea of the ''COP'', by pointing out some numbers:
* natural gas consumption rose fifteen times in the period of four months, with 314 kilometers of a new pipeline, connecting 17 plants,
* 14 million [[zloty]]s were spent on road construction in 1938,
* ten new railroad stations were built,
* 22,000 hectares of land were [[Land improvement|improved]],
* 280 kilometers of river banks were [[River engineering|engineered]],
* 10,000 new apartments were built.

During his November 1938 trip, Wańkowicz visited [[Dębica]], where construction of the Stomil Tire Factory was started in April 1938: "Polish production now covers 70% of our demand. The import was reduced from 13 to 4 million (...) Soon, tires made of [[synthetic rubber]] will be manufactured here. The Dębica plant is like a laboratory, where white collar workers make one-third of staff". (pages 438 - 440) Then the author went by train to [[Pustków Osiedle]] near Dębica, where the ''Lignoza'' plastic and ammunition plant was under construction: "The spirit of explosives floats above this plant. So, its 135 buildings are scattered over the area of 600 hectares. And the settlement for the workers is located one kilometer away". (pages 440 - 441) Another location was [[Nowa Dęba]], which Wańkowicz calls Dąb-Majdan: "Here, 2,360 people work. As early as autumn of 1939, first [[Fuse (explosives)|fuses]] will be manufactured at the 1,500 hectare plant. This giant factory is one large ammunition compound in case of war". (pages 442 - 443). Next location is [[Mielec]], where on September 1, 1939, construction of [[PZL Mielec]] was started: "In the autumn of 1939, first 50,000-meter [[airframe]]s will be tested here, in a special [[wind tunnel]]". (pages 444 - 445) Last stop of the trip was [[Stalowa Wola]]: "I walk along those giant furnaces and machines with mixed feelings. Deputy Prime Minister tells me that if both local [[blast furnace]]s were in use for 24 hours a day they would require as much as 12% of [[electric current]], used by the whole Polish nation. It tells a lot about our country (...) Stalowa Wola has been under construction for 20 months, and 98% of buildings are ready. Whole plant will be up and running one year ahead of schedule". (pages 445 - 452)

=== Fanfara Zaolziańska ===
This whole chapter is dedicated to the events of autumn 1938, when following the [[Munich Agreement]], Poland recovered [[Zaolzie]] from [[Czechoslovakia]]. Wańkowicz personally visited this province, meeting with its residents. 
* Czarne lata
The author goes back to the mid-19th century, when Polish national awakening was initiated in the Habsburg-ruled [[Duchy of Teschen]]. Wańkowicz recalls people responsible for it, local Polish activists, such as Jerzy Cienciała, Paweł Stalmach, Reverend Franciszek Michejda, Reverend Józef Londzin. At that time, Czech national movement was non-existent in the Duchy, and main enemy of Polish activists were Germans, who banned education in the Polish language, and until 1895, there was not a single Polish school in the Duchy. First Czech activists came here in the 1890s: "In 1918, after the dissolution of [[Austria-Hungary]], Poles were first to act. On October 31, they established a local Polish government. The Czechs did not object, and on November 5, an agreement was signed, with Zaolzie remaining in Polish hands (...) But soon afterwards, Poland became involved in other conflicts, and by early 1919, Czech envoy [[Karel Kramar]], backed by [[Tomas Masaryk]], changed course, saying that Czechs were victors in the war, while the [[Fourteen Points]] were only a theory". (pages 460 - 463)

The [[Polish–Czechoslovak War]] began when on January 23, 1919, three trains with Czech infantry arrived at [[Ostrava]]. Polish forces were inadequate, as almost all local units of the [[Polish Army]] had been transported to [[Lwów]] on January 8 to fight in the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]]: "The Czechs stated that their infantry was heading for [[Slovakia]], but on the next day they attacked, with 14,000 soldiers and 28 cannons. We had 1,285 soldiers, 4 cannons and 35 cavalrymen (...) After a week of fighting, the Czechs failed to achieve their objectives, while Poles received reinforcements. General [[Franciszek Latinik]] had 4,600 soldiers, which was fewer than the Czechs, but enough to stop the enemy's advance in the Battle of [[Skoczów]] (...) On January 30, 1919, Poles lost 19 dead, 82 wounded and 15 captured by the enemy; the Czechs massacred them with bayonets". (pages 463 - 467)

When in mid-1920 Soviet offensive against Poland began, the government of Czechoslovakia prohibited all transports of weapons, so needed by Poland. On July 28, 1920, the [[Conference of Ambassadors]] accepted the temporary demarcation line as a border between the two nations: "Our delegate, [[Ignacy Paderewski]], while signing the decision of the Council, stated that Polish nation would never be convinced that it was a just decision, while Marshall Piłsudski told the Poles of [[Zaolzie]]: Wait, be patient. We will never renounce you (...) As soon as Czechs took control of this land, they closed down 17 Polish schools with 4,135 students, expelling 100 Polish teachers (...) The Czechs did not exert direct pressure. Instead, they used the slogan: We have jobs only for our people. So, a Pole, sending his kids to Polish school, a Pole involved in Polish associations, lost his job (...) So local Poles decided to organize themselves. At [[Lazy (Orlová)|Łazy]] I saw the main office of a Polish association of food producers. It has its own rail track, large car park, bakery, slaughterhouse, mill, lemonade plant, 120 stores spread across three counties". (pages 465 - 468)
* Oczekiwany dzień
Wańkowicz begins by recalling the [[Munich Agreement]], in which German claims for [[Sudetenland]] were accepted, but there was no mention of either Polish or Hungarian claims to parts of Czechoslovakia. On the same day (Friday, September 30), a Polish aeroplane landed at [[Prague]], with Polish claims. On the next day, the Czechs agreed to hand Zaolzie over to Poland. Wańkowicz writes about it with enthusiasm: "Ours is Zaolzie! Ours is [[Cesky Tesin|Cieszyn]], ours is [[Karvina]], rich in coal! Ours is [[Lazy (Orlová)|Łazy]], with its main office of Polish association! Ours is [[Bohumin|Bogumin]], the rail heart of Central Europe, the junction along the German-dreamed route from [[Berlin]] to [[Baghdad]]! Ours is industrial [[Fryštát|Frysztat]], ours is the metallurgical colossus at [[Trinec|Trzyniec]]! Ours is [[Jablunkov|Jabłonków]], the agricultural capital of Polish Zaolzie! Ours is [[Konská (Třinec)|Końska]], full of Polish activists! Ours is [[Darkov|Darków]], with its spa, ours is old [[Bystřice (Frýdek-Místek District)|Bystryca]]! The [[Olza River|Olza]] has turned into our internal river!" (page 473)

The author witnessed these events, giving a first-hand report. First he went to [[Skoczów]], where headquarters of [[Independent Operational Group Silesia]] was located. He met General [[Władysław Bortnowski]] in his rail car, then went to a local restaurant to talk with [[Gustaw Morcinek]]. Next, he visited a camp in [[Hermanice, Ustroń|Hermanice]], opened for Poles expelled by Czechs from Zaolzie. On Monday, October 3, 1938, Wańkowicz came to [[Cieszyn]], to witness a parade of the [[Polish Army]]. On the same night, a banquet took place at Polonia Hotel in Czech Cieszyn. Next day, Wańkowicz went by car to [[Těrlicko|Cierlicko]], to see the spot where Polish aviators [[Stanisław Wigura]] and [[Franciszek Żwirko]] died in 1932. Next he visited Karwina and Orłowa, heading towards [[Ostrava]], beyond new, extended borders of Poland: "Trees lie down by bridges, ready to barricade roads, red signs along roads mark mined areas. At Ostrava, a large and modern city, we eat dinner at a restaurant full of German speakers. Our driver suddenly comes to us, telling that Czech secret police are following us. So we hastily leave the restaurant". (pages 490 - 495)
* Światło
In 1914 in [[Zaolzie]], 24,000 children attended Polish schools, and only 2,320 pupils went to Czech schools. By 1938, these numbers changed, and the number of children in Polish schools shrank to 9,732. Before Polish Army units took control of this province, the retreating Czechs damaged schools, smashing furniture and stealing equipment. In late October 1938, Polish authorities began opening back schools in Zaolzie. On October 26, middle schools at Jabłonków, Bogumin, Orłowa, and Cieszyn were opened after special ceremonies: "On my way back from Jabłonków, I stopped at Końska, visiting Agricultural High School (...) This school had been discriminated by the Czech authorities, who limited its funds to minimum (...) A few days after annexation of Zaolzie, National Insurance invited 60 girls from Trzyniec, Karwina and Frysztat to a resort hotel in [[Jaworze, Silesian Voivodeship|Jaworze]]. So, I am taking [[Gustaw Morcinek]] with me, and we are going there. At the resort, 60 local girls are waiting. The two groups immediately hit it off. This comes as no surprise. After all they are from the same land, which had been divided only 20 years before. (pages 504 - 508)
* Trud powszedni
Melchior Wańkowicz describes here efforts of Polish administration, which took control of Zaolzie after its capture by the military: "Right after Polish soldiers, a train with Polish rail workers entered the area. Then there were trucks of [[Poczta Polska]], delivery vehicles with produce (...) I went to Karwina after Sunday service. The locals were afraid that their Czech pensions would not be honored by the Polish government. Now they know they were wrong". (pages 510 - 514)

Zaolzie was far more urbanized and industrialized than the [[Second Polish Republic]]. In the fall 1938, Poland captured 18 coal mines, which increased Polish coal production by 20%. As Wańkowicz wrote, main problem for Warsaw was to find new markets for the coal and [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] from Zaolzie. Furthermore, Zaolzie had the enormous [[Třinec Iron and Steel Works]], Albert Hahn Steel Plant at Bogumin, Wire Mill at [[Pudlov|Pudłów]], Jeckel Pipe and Screw Plant at Frysztat: "Altogether, these plants manufacture 50% of Poland's output. Zaolzie coke plants manufacture 40% of Poland's output. All these factories are awaiting new markets. Half of all houses here has electricity, 80% of Zaolzie residents work in services and industry (...) Zaolzie is a great challenge, an obstacle that we have to overcome (...) We already did not know what to do with our coal, and now our production has increased by one-fifth". (pages 516 - 527)
* Posłowie
The final chapter of the book is an afterword, in which the author recalls some events from Polish history, wishing that the Poland of the future would be based on two foundations, freedom and strength.

'''''The Logic of Sense''''' ({{lang-fr|Logique du sens}}) is a 1969 book by the French philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]]. The English edition was translated by Mark Lester with Charles Stivale, and edited by Constantin V. Boundas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-05982-4/the-logic-of-sense Columbia University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
An exploration of meaning and meaninglessness, or "commonsense" and "nonsense", ''The Logic of Sense'' consists of a series of thirty-four [[paradoxes]] and an appendix that contains five previously published essays, including a brief overview of Deleuze's [[ontology]] entitled "Plato and the Simulacrum".

The book introduces Deleuze's philosophy of the event and of becoming and includes textual analyses of works by [[Lewis Carroll]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Pierre Klossowski]], [[Michel Tournier]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Émile Zola]] and [[Sigmund Freud]].

==Reception==

The philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] wrote that ''The Logic of Sense'' "should be read as the boldest and most insolent of metaphysical treatises - on the simple condition that instead of denouncing metaphysics as the neglect of being, we force it to speak of extrabeing".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.generation-online.org/p/fpfoucault5.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher [[Christopher Norris (critic)|Christopher Norris]] believes that, like ''[[Difference and Repetition]]'' (1968), ''The Logic of Sense'' comes as near as possible to offering a full-scale programmatic statement of Deleuze's post-philosophical, anti-systematic, ultra-nominalist or resolutely "non-totalizing" mode of thought.&lt;ref name="Norrisarticle"&gt;{{cite book |author=Christopher Norris |editor=Ted Honderich |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1995 |page=183 |isbn=0-19-866132-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] write in ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (1997) that ''The Logic of Sense'' prefigures the style of works that Deleuze later wrote in collaboration with [[Félix Guattari]], and that, like them, it contains passages in which Deleuze misuses technical scientific terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sokal, Alan |author2=Bricmont, Jean |title=Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science |publisher=Picador |location=New York |year=1999 |page=166 |isbn=0-312-20407-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josuha Ramey describes ''The Logic of Sense'' as Deleuze's "most sustained ethical reflection".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ramey, Joshua |title=The Hermetic Deleuze: Philosophy and Spiritual Ordeal |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham |year=2012 |page=172 |isbn=978-0-8223-5229-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timothy Laurie argues that Deleuze presents "sense" as wrapped up in a problematic, and that a problematic cannot be evaluated according to truth and error, nor is it ever exhausted through one single solution.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie, Timothy 2015: 'Masculinity Studies and the Jargon of Strategy: Hegemony, Tautology, Sense' ''Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities'' 20(1) p. 24 URL: https://www.academia.edu/10912537&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Realms of Being''''' (1942) is the last major work by Spanish-American [[philosopher]] [[George Santayana]]. Along with ''[[Scepticism and Animal Faith]]'' and ''[[The Life of Reason]]'', it is his most notable work; the first two works concentrate primarily on [[epistemology]] and [[ethics]] respectively, whereas ''The Realms of Being'' is mainly a work in the field of [[ontology]].

Santayana builds on his ''Skepticism and Animal Faith'', which he described as a sort of precursor to "a new system of philosophy", that would be developed fully in the present work.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will. ''The Story of Philosophy'' Simon &amp; Schuster, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt; He defines four realms of being; ''The Realm of Essence'', ''The Realm of Matter'', ''The Realm of Truth'', and ''The Realm of Spirit''.

==Realms==
===The Realm of Essence===
The Realm of Essence, in Santayana's view, has a type of primacy over the other realms. To him, essence is anything that is or has a character—this includes thoughts, imaginings, derivations of logic, and material objects. Nothing can be experienced but through these essences, and they "are the only things people ever see, and the last they notice." Essence is ''awareness'', it is different from knowledge or from ''faith'', which he defines later.

===The Realm of Matter===
[[Matter]] is the objective, material stuff of the universe. Staying true to his [[materialism]], Santayana holds matter as the "primordial existential flux" and believes it can be, at least in some sense, known. His conception of matter is similar to [[Spinoza]]'s substance; matter has no purpose, but constitutes the limitations of what can be. Humans can know matter only from a distance, symbolically:

{{quotation|Matter is in fact referred to by Santayana as a “metaphor” only, producing one of the more provocative aspects of his philosophy: science is no less literary than poetry in representing matter in that it must express its truths at a remove, through the lens of human bias.|-Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}

Thus, while Santayana reveres and deeply respects science (and believes it useful for everyday experiences), he does not deify it in the way many other philosophers of the 20th century have, and he limits it to a fallible approximation of truth.

===The Realm of Truth===

The Realm of Truth was thought of well after Santayana had thought of his other three realms; he envisions it as a sort of subdivision of the Realm of Essence. Truth is that part of the Realm of Essences instantiated by matter; indeed, he says: {{cquote|Truth is the furrow which matter must plow upon the face of essence.}}

As the [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] entry on Santayana says:

{{quotation|All events that take place entail concatenations of essences elected by matter for appearance in the course of human life, and their objective relations—factual arrangement, for example, that the terrorist attacks in America in 2001 took place on September 11th rather than the 12th—introduce the possibility of truth for human understanding|}}

Santayana here departs from classical [[pragmatism|pragmatists]], of whom he is often considered one, in that he believes truth has a strong element outside of experience, and must coincide with what actually is.

===The Realm of Spirit===

Spirit is, as used by Santayana, very much akin to consciousness; it is, according to [[John Lachs]], "that part of a life constituted by its series of intuitions". Santayana believes that the mind is more accustomed to essence than it is to fact, and, as such, consciousness may at times manifest things that are not fact. Herein is to be found the Realm of Spirit; it is Santayana's attempt to reconcile the theories of [[Plato]] and the demands of [[reason]].&lt;ref&gt;Flamm, Matthew C. ''The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: George Santayana'' 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Syro-Aramaic Reading of the Koran: A Contribution to the Decoding of the Language of the Koran''''' is an English-language edition (2007) of ''Die syro-aramäische Lesart des Koran: Ein Beitrag zur Entschlüsselung der Koransprache'' (2000)  by [[Christoph Luxenberg]].

The thesis of the book is that the text of the [[Quran]] was substantially derived from [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christian liturgy]], arguing that many "obscure" portions become clear when they are back-translated and interpreted as Syriacisms. While noticeable Syro-Aramaic influence on the language of the Quran is taken as undisputed in this work, Luxenberg's thesis goes beyond mainstream scholarly consensus and was widely received with skepticism in reviews.

==Thesis==
The work advances the thesis that critical sections of the [[Quran]] have been misread by generations of readers and [[Muslim]] and Western scholars, who consider [[Classical Arabic]] the language of the [[Quran]]. Luxenberg's analysis suggests that the prevalent Syro-Aramaic language up to the seventh century formed a stronger [[etymology|etymological basis]] for its meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stille|first1=Alexander|title=Scholars Are Quietly Offering New Theories of the Koran|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/02/arts/scholars-are-quietly-offering-new-theories-of-the-koran.html|work=The New York Times|date=2 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Contrary to the earlier assumption of a dialect of Arabic spoken in Mecca, the present study has shown that, insofar as the Arabic tradition has identified the language of the Koran with that of the [[Quraysh]], the inhabitants of Mecca, this language must instead have been an Aramaic-Arabic hybrid language. It is not just the findings of this study that have led to this insight. Namely, in the framework of this study an examination of a series of hadith (sayings of the Prophet) has identified Aramaisms that had either been misinterpreted or were inexplicable from the point of view of Arabic. This would lead one to assume that Mecca was originally an Aramaic settlement. Confirmation of this would come from the name [[Mecca]] (Macca) itself, which one has not been able to explain etymologically on the basis of Arabic. But if we take the Syro-Aramaic root Km (ma, actually makk) (lower, to be low) as a basis, we get the adjective akm (mäkkä) (masc.), atkm (mäkktä) (fem.), with the meaning of "(the) lower (one).{{sfn|Luxenberg|2007|p=327}}}}

A notable trait of early written Arabic was that it lacked vowel signs and [[diacritic]]s which would later distinguish e.g. [[bet (letter)|ب]], [[taw|ت]], [[nun|ن]], [[yodh|ي]], and thus was prone to mispronunciation. [[Arabic diacritics]] were added around the turn of the eighth century on orders of [[al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf]], governor of Iraq (694–714).{{cn|date=May 2017}}.

Luxenberg claimed that the Quran "contains much ambiguous and even inexplicable language." He asserts that even Muslim scholars find some passages difficult to parse and have written reams of Quranic commentary attempting to explain these passages. However, the assumption behind their endeavours has always been, according to him, that any difficult passage is true, meaningful, and pure Arabic, and that it can be deciphered with the tools of traditional Muslim scholarship. Luxenberg accuses Western academic scholars of the Qur'an of taking a timid and imitative approach, relying too heavily on the work of Muslim scholars.

The book's thesis is that the Quran was not originally written exclusively in Arabic but in a mixture with [[Syriac language|Syriac]], the dominant spoken and written language in the Arabian peninsula through the eighth century.
{{quote|What is meant by Syro-Aramaic (actually Syriac) is the branch of Aramaic in the Near East originally spoken in [[Edessa]] and the surrounding area in Northwest Mesopotamia and predominant as a written language from Christianization to the origin of the Koran. For more than a millennium Aramaic was the [[lingua franca]] in the entire [[Middle East]]ern region before being gradually displaced by Arabic beginning in the 7th century.{{sfn|Luxenberg|2007|p=9}}}}

Luxenberg remarked that scholars must start afresh, ignore the old Islamic commentaries, and use only the latest in linguistic and historical methods. Hence, if a particular Quranic word or phrase seems "meaningless" in Arabic, or can be given meaning only by tortuous conjectures, it makes sense – he argues – to look to Syriac as well as [[Arabic]].

Luxenberg also argues that the Quran is based on earlier texts, namely Syriac [[Lectionary|lectionaries]] used in Christian churches of Syria, and that it was the work of several generations who adapted these texts into the Quran we know today.

==His proposed methodology==
* Check whether a plausible, overlooked explanation can be found in ''[[Tafsir al-Tabari]]'' (completed ca. 883 CE).
* Check if there is a plausible explanation in the [[Ibn Manzur#Lisān al-ʿArab|Ibn Manzur's ''Lisān al-ʿArab'']] (completed ca. 1290 CE), the most extensive Arabic dictionary (this dictionary postdates the Tabari commentary by about 400 years, so might plausibly contain advances in lexical insight).
* Check if the Arabic expression has a [[homonym]]ous root in Syriac or [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] with a different meaning that fits the context.
* Judge whether or not the meaning of the Syriac/Aramaic root word might make better sense of the passage.
* Check to see if there is a Syriac word which would make sense of the passage.
* Experiment with different placements of the diacritics (which indicate vowels, etc.) later added to the earliest text, the [[rasm]]. Perhaps there is a version of the rasm that will give an Arabic word that makes sense of the passage.
* If there is no Arabic word that works, repeat the experiment and look for Syriac words.
* Translate the Arabic phrase into Syriac and check the Syrian literature for a phrase that might have been translated literally into Arabic; the original meaning in Syriac may make more sense than the resulting Arabic phrase (such translated phrases are called morphological [[calque]]s).
* Check to see if there is a corresponding phrase in the old Syrian literature, which may be an analog of an Arabic phrase now lost.
* Check to see if it is a correct Arabic expression written in Arabic script, but in Syriac orthography.&lt;ref name="Saleh"&gt;Walid Saleh, [http://www.safarmer.com/Indo-Eurasian/Walid_Saleh.pdf  The Etymological Fallacy and Quranic Studies: Muhammad, Paradise, and Late Antiquity]  in: ''The Qur’an in Context'', ed. Angelika Neuwirth, Brill (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34–5}}

"Plausibility", "judging" and "making sense" of single word involves looking at occurrences of the same word in more obvious Koranic passages, and looking at Aramaic apocryphal and liturgical texts, which were carried over almost verbatim into the Koran.

== Word analysis ==

=== Quran ===
According to Luxenberg, the word ''qur'an'' ("reading, lectionary") is a rendition of the Aramaic word ''qeryan-a'',  a book of liturgical readings, i.e. the term for a Syriac lectionary, with hymns and Biblical extracts, created for use in Christian services. 
Luxenburg cites the suggestion by [[Theodor Nöldeke]]  "that the term ''Qorān'' is not an inner-Arabic development out of the synonymous infinitive, but a borrowing from that Syriac word with a simultaneous assimilation of the type ''fuʿlān''."&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Nöldeke, ''Geschichte des Qorâns'' (1860), cited in Luxemburg (2007), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Huri ===
The word [[houri]], universally interpreted by scholars as ''white-eyed virgins'' (who will serve the faithful in Paradise; Qur'an 44:54, 52:20, 55:72, 56:22) means, according to Luxenberg, ''white grapes or raisins''. He says that many Christian descriptions of Paradise describe it as abounding in pure white grapes. This sparked much ridicule and insult from the Western press who allege that "suicide bombers would be expecting beautiful women and getting grapes."&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|title=Virgins? What virgins?|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=2002-01-12|url=https://www.theguardian.com/saturday_review/story/0,,631332,00.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Khatam ===
The passage in surat [[al-Ahzab]] that has usually been translated as "seal of the prophets" means, according to Luxenberg, "witness". By this reading, [[Muhammad]] is not the last of the prophets, but a witness to those prophets who came before him.

== Aya analysis ==

The Quranic passage in surat [[an-Nur]], 31 is traditionally translated as saying that women "should draw their veils over their bosoms" ([[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]]'s [[translation]], ''[[The Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation and Commentary]]'').[https://web.archive.org/web/20081208035237/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/quran/024.qmt.html] It has been interpreted as a command for women to cover themselves, and is used in support of [[hijab]]. In Luxenberg's Syro-Aramaic reading, the verse instead commands women to "snap their belts around their waists." Luxenberg argues that this is a much more plausible reading than the Arabic one. The belt was a sign of chastity in the Christian world. Also, Jesus puts on an apron before he washes the disciples' feet at the last supper.&lt;ref name="chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it"&gt;[http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/dettaglio.jsp?id=7025&amp;eng=y The Virgins and the Grapes: the Christian Origins of the Koran] {{Webarchive|url=https://swap.stanford.edu/20090417191145/http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/dettaglio.jsp?id=7025&amp;eng=y |date=2009-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most detailed scholarly review is by Daniel King, a Syriacist at the University of Cardiff, who endorses some of Luxenberg's emendations and readings and cites other scholars who have done the same, but concludes: 
{{quote|Luxenberg's meta-theory of Qur'ānic origins is not proved by the evidence he sets forth in this book. That certain of the Qur'ān's expressions and words (as well as broader ideas and themes) are of Christian origin is well founded, and should in general be sufficient to explain the data presented here without needing recourse to either of the two more radical theories he espouses, namely that the Qur’ān was in origin no more than a Christian lectionary, and that the language which it is written is an 'Aramaic-Arabic hybrid'.  More must be offered to convince anybody as to the mechanisms by which such a strong cultural and linguistic contact could have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Daniel|title=A Christian Qur’ān?

The Quran is "the translation of a Syriac text," is how [[Angelika Neuwirth]] describes Luxenberg's thesis – "The general thesis underlying his entire book thus is that the Quran is a corpus of translations and paraphrases of original Syriac texts recited in church services as elements of a lectionary." She considers it as "an extremely pretentious hypothesis which is unfortunately relying on rather modest foundations." Neuwirth points out that Luxenberg doesn't consider the previous work in Quran studies, but "limits himself to a very mechanistic, positivist linguistic method without caring for theoretical considerations developed in modern linguistics."&lt;ref name="Neuwirth"/&gt;

Blois (2003) is particularly scathing, describing the book as  "not a work of scholarship but of [[Amateur|dilettantism]]" and concluding that Luxenburg's "grasp of Syriac is limited to knowledge of dictionaries and in his Arabic he makes mistakes that are typical for the Arabs of the Middle East."&lt;ref name="Blois"/&gt;

Saleh (2011) describes Luxenberg's method as "so idiosyncratic, so inconsistent, that it is simply impossible to keep his line of argument straight."&lt;ref name="Saleh"/&gt;{{rp|51}} He adds that according to Luxenberg, for the last two hundred years, Western scholars "have totally misread the Qur'ān" and that, ad hominem, no one can understand the Qur'an as "Only he can fret out for us the Syrian skeleton of this text."&lt;ref name="Saleh"/&gt;{{rp|56}} Summing up his assessment of Luxenberg's method, he states:
{{quote|The first fundamental premise of his approach, that the Qur'ān is a Syriac text, is the easiest to refute on linguistic evidence. ''Nothing in the Qur'ān is Syriac, even the Syriac borrowed terms are Arabic, in so far as they now Arabized and used inside an Arabic linguistic medium.'' Luxenberg is pushing the etymological fallacy to its natural conclusion. The Qur'ān not only is borrowing words according to Luxenberg, it is speaking a gibberish language.&lt;ref name="Saleh"/&gt;{{rp|55}}&lt;ref&gt;(Italics in source)&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
Saleh further attests&lt;ref name="Saleh"/&gt;{{rp|47}} that Luxenberg does not follow his own proposed rules.&lt;ref&gt;Saleh additionally states that "The etymology of a word is a poor indication of what it means in a new context." He refers to Paul V. Mankowski's ''Akkadian Loanwords in Biblical Hebrew'' (Winona Lakes: Eisenbrauns, 2000), 1–13 and quotes M O'Conor's article "The Arabic Loanwords in Nabatean Aramaic" ''JNES'' 45 (1986), 215: "[T]he fundamental difficulty of all intra-Semitic language study: there is a common stratum of vocabulary and grammatical structure which makes it impossible to assign many words and formants to a particular language. ''Op cit'', p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Kroes in a review on [[Livius.org]]{{year needed|date=February 2016}} describes him as "unaware of much of the other literature on the subject" and that "quite a few of his theories are doubtful and motivated too much by a Christian apologetic agenda."&lt;ref name="livius"&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Kroes|title=Missionary, dilettante or visionary?|publisher=[[Livius.org]] |url=http://www.livius.org/opinion/Luxenberg.htm }}{{year needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patricia Crone]], professor of Islamic history at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, in a 2008 article at opendemocracy.net refers to Luxenberg's work as "open to so many scholarly objections" and "notably amateurism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''''The Varieties of the Meditative Experience''''' is a 1977 book by American psychologist [[Daniel Goleman]]. It was published under the title '''''The Meditative Mind''''' in 1988.

[[File:Daniel Goleman - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2011.jpg|thumb|upright|The author, [[Daniel Goleman]], in 2011]]

==Synopsis==

===Visuddhimagga===
Goleman begins with an outline of the ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'' of [[Theravada]]n [[Buddhism]].

===Survey===
Goleman continues with a survey of eleven&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/daniel-goleman-2/the-varieties-of-the-meditative-experience/#review|title=''The Varieties of the Meditative Experience''|publisher=''Kirkus Reviews''|accessdate=July 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; types of meditation including [[Hinduism]], [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Sufism]], [[Transcendental Meditation]], [[Patanjali]]'s [[Raja Yoga|Ashtanga Yoga]], Indian [[Tantra]] and [[Kundalini Yoga]], [[Tibetan Buddhism]], [[Zen]], the teachings of [[Gurdjieff]] as expressed by [[P. D. Ouspensky]], and the teachings of [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]].

===Unity===
Goleman then draws some parallels between various methods, saying that they all share the goal of changing the practitioner's state of consciousness. Each method may have a different word for the "awakened state": sahaj [[samadhi]], [[Devekut]], purity of heart, baqa, [[Jivamukti Yoga|jivamukti]], [[cosmic consciousness]], turiyatita, [[siddha]], [[bodhisattva]], mujodo no taigeu, objective consciousness, [[choiceless awareness]], [[Arhat (Buddhism)|arahantship]].&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, pp. 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt; All of them result in ''one, single point'' of concentration. All except Krishnamurti propose an explicit doctrine that the student is expected to assimilate.&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abhidhamma model===
Next the author reviews Theravadan Buddhism's [[Abhidhamma Pitaka|Abhidhamma]] which describes, in 53 categories (and in other schools of Buddhism up to 175 categories),&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; how wholesome states of mind replace and cancel out unwholesome ones.&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Which traits are wholesome was distilled empirically from a survey of a large number of early Buddhists who were asked whether each trait facilitated or detracted from their meditation efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Goleman writes, "Each of the unhealthy factors is opposed by a healthy factor."&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern and Western psychology===
This becomes a basis for contrast between [[Buddhism and psychology|Eastern]] and [[psychology|Western]] psychology. According to Goleman, Westerners study [[psychopathology]],&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; and the English language lacks the words needed to indicate nuances in consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goleman searches through modern Western psychology and finds [[Sigmund Freud]] failed to ever read and study Eastern texts, and that [[behaviorism|behaviorist]] [[John B. Watson]] bemoaned what he saw as the substitution of consciousness for soul.&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, pp. 140, 146, 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Goleman writes, "For the most part, Western psychologists have been reactive against Eastern psychologies".&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; More in tune are parts of [[Gordon Allport]], [[Erik Erikson]], [[Ernest Becker]], and [[Franz Alexander]].&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, p. 147–148.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goleman finds parallels with Eastern psychologies in [[Plotinus]] and in Christian psychology in the writings of [[Anthony the Great]], [[St. John of the Cross]] and [[Meister Eckhart]].&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, pp. 150, 151.&lt;/ref&gt; He finds a sympathetic ear in [[William James]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Abraham Maslow]], [[Andras Angyal]], [[Medard Boss]], [[Martin Buber]], [[Erich Fromm]], and in [[Alan Watts]], Anthony Sutich, [[Charles Tart]] and in contemporary works by [[Ken Wilber]], Jack Engler, Daniel P. Brown, and [[Mark Epstein]].&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, pp. 156–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conclusion===
Goleman quickly covers contemporary research on meditation and also research on [[Relaxation technique|relaxation]].&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, pp. 162–184.&lt;/ref&gt; He ends with a discussion of "how to meditate".&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, pp. 185–189.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' wrote about the 1977 book:
{{quote|To a casual reader, Goleman's study is too full of arcane words and multilingual jargon about states of enlightenment. But to a serious student of meditation, this book, like its predecessor, is an excellent resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=National Library Board Singapore|url=http://readon.sg/det_4352810.aspx|title=''Publishers Weekly and Library Journal''|accessdate=July 15, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130418122726/http://readon.sg/det_4352810.aspx|archivedate=April 18, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Apple [[iTunes]] says the 1988 book is "a comprehensive and easily accessed overview".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=iTunes Preview: The Meditative Mind|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-meditative-mind/id498022632?mt=11|publisher=Apple|accessdate=July 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Reid's Tombstone.JPG|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Thomas Reid's tombstone at the entrance of the Gilbert Scott Building of Glasgow University]]
[[File:Prof's Monument.JPG|thumb|&lt;center&gt;The Professors' Monument in [[Glasgow Necropolis]] where Reid's remains were placed.]]
[[File:Glasgow University tower - geograph.org.uk - 1108298.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;'''Glasgow University Tower'''&lt;br /&gt;
 The tombstone is on the right hand side of the entrance to the tower]]
[[Thomas Reid]] D.D. (1710&amp;ndash;1796), was Professor of Moral Philosophy at the [[University of Glasgow]] and founder of the [[Scottish School of Common Sense|Scottish common sense]] movement in philosophy. Remarkably, his tombstone is to be found in the vestibule of the main building of [[Glasgow University]] and directly under the 85m (278 feet) high tower of the Gilbert Scott Building. Reid’s remains were originally laid in Blackfriars Church burial-ground, in the grounds of [[Glasgow University|Glasgow College]] in the High Street, Glasgow. The  tombstone was removed when the College moved to Gilmorehill in 1870. It was placed in its present position when the building of the Tower above it was begun, thus forming a fitting ‘monument’ to Reid. In comparison, the [[Scott Monument]] in [[Edinburgh]] is only {{convert|200.5|feet}}.

==Inscriptions==
Tombstone inscription may be translated as follows:

{{quote|Sacred to the memory of Thomas Reid, S.T.P., formerly Professor of Philosophy at King’s College, Aberdeen; more recently Professor of Moral Philosophy in the University of Glasgow, from the year 1764 to the year 1796; who renewed everything in the science of the human mind, as once the distinguished Lord Bacon of St. Albans did in natural philosophy; who combined sharpness of mind, all kinds of learning, utmost seriousness of character, and likewise kindness; who died 7th October, 1796, at the age of 86, and whose bones together with the ashes of Elizabeth Reid, his much loved wife, and three daughters carried off by premature death, are buried here in this tomb. The erection of this monument was ordered by his most affectionate, and only surviving daughter, Martha Carmichael.&lt;ref&gt;Translated with the help of the Classic Department of Glasgow University.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The full Latin inscription is as follows:
{{quote|Memoriae sacrum THOMAE REID, S.T.P., quondam in Schola Regia Aberdonensi Philosophiae Professoris; nuper vero, in Universitate Glasguensi, ab anno 1764 usque ad annum 1796, Phi1osophiae Moralis Professoris; qui in Scientia Mentis Humanae, ut olim in Philosophia Naturali illustris ille Baconus Verulamius, omnia instauravit; qui ingenii acumini, doctrinaeque omnigenae, summam morum gravitatem, simul atque comitatem, adjunxit; qui obiit 7th October, 1796, annos natus 86. Cujusque ossa cum cineribus ELIZABETHAE REID, conjugis carissimae, triumque filiarum, morte praematura abreptarum, sepulchro hic condita sunt, hoc Monumentum poni jussit filia piissima, unica superstes, Martha Carmichael."&lt;ref&gt;Reid may have written at least part of this epitaph himself before his death. The reference to the works of [[Francis Bacon]] reflects his own interest and in a late letter to [[Dugald Stewart]], he draws his former pupil's attention to the importance of Bacon. See, for example, Daniel N. Robinson,'Thomas Reid's Critique of Dugald Stewart', ''Journal of the History of Philosophy'', Volume 27, Number 3, July 1989, 
pp. 405-422.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Relocation==
When the Glasgow College buildings in the High Street were demolished, Reid’s remains were placed with those of other professors and their families in the Professors’ Monument in the [[Glasgow Necropolis]] near [[Glasgow Cathedral]]. The Monument is at the south end of the sixth row of monuments from the eastern end of the cemetery, and overlooking Reid’s home in Drygate.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. A. C. Fraser, ''[[Thomas Reid]]'' in the [[Famous Scots Series]] (Edinburgh: [[Oliphant, Anderson and Ferrier]], 1898), p. 128.). Other remains of professors were transferred to Craigton Cemetery in the south-west of the city.&lt;/ref&gt; It has the following inscription: "In memory of Professors of the University of Glasgow and members of their family whose bodies were interred in Blackfriars Churchyard and removed here in 1876."

'''Vietnamese philosophy''' includes both traditional [[Confucian philosophy]], [[Religion in Vietnam|Vietnamese local religious traditions]], and later philosophy introducing [[French philosophy|French]], [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist]], [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] and other influences.

==Confucianism in Vietnam==
Confucianism entered Vietnam and was later reinforced in the four ''[[Bắc thuộc]]'' periods of Chinese domination, beginning with the [[first Chinese domination of Vietnam]] from 111 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Jones Guide to Vietnam  1994 - Page 29 "Confucianism. Confucianism entered Vietnam from China during the Bac Thuoc era (111 BC - AD 938) when the country was under the yoke.."&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the beginning of [[Taoism in Vietnam]] and [[Buddhism in Vietnam]]. Confucianism was reinforced in government by the [[Confucian examination system in Vietnam]], as well as the way family raised and taught children toward filial piety, through absolute obedience.&lt;ref name=vnturmoil&gt;Napier, Nancy K.; Vuong, Quan Hoang. [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0985530588/ What we see, why we worry, why we hope: Vietnam going forward.] Boise, ID: [[Boise State University CCI Press]], October 2013. {{ISBN|978-0985530587}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study of Vietnamese philosophy==
Most research on Vietnamese philosophy is conducted by modern Vietnamese scholars.&lt;ref&gt;''Teaching and research in philosophy: Asia and the Pacific''  Unesco - 1986 Page 363 "On matters relating to national traditions in philosophy, the Vietnamese philosophers will continue to study the history of national philosophy, to write books on the history of Vietnamese philosophy, to do research on the typical characteristics ..."&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional Vietnamese philosophy has been described by one biographer of Ho Chi Minh (Brocheux, 2007) as a "perennial Sino-Vietnamese philosophy" blending different strands of Confucianism with [[Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Brocheux, Ho Chi Minh: A Biography  2007 - Pages 204,205 “Ho was also steeped in the perennial Sino-Vietnamese philosophy that blended Confucianism (in its plural form incorporating Confucius, Mencius, Xunzi, and Wang Yang Ming)7 with Buddhism and Taoism."&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have found the empirical evidence of this "blending" and defined the socio-cultural phenomenon as "cultural additivity".&lt;ref name=Vuongetal2018b&gt;{{cite journal|title='Cultural additivity' and how the values and norms of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism co-exist, interact, and influence Vietnamese society: A Bayesian analysis of long-standing folktales, using R and Stan|date=March 4, 2018|newspaper=CEB WP No.18/015 (Centre Emile Bernheim, Université Libre de Bruxelles)|ssrn=3134541}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another, Catholic, writer (Vu, 1966)&lt;ref&gt;Vu Dinh Trac, "Triet ly truyen thong Viet Nam don duong cho Than Hoc Viet Nam," Dinh Huong 11 (1966)&lt;/ref&gt; has analysed Vietnamese philosophy as constituted of ''tam tài'' ("three body" Heaven, Man, Earth) philosophy, [[yin-yang]] [[metaphysics]], and agricultural philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Peter C. Phan ''Vietnamese-American Catholics '' 2005 Page 27 "Vu Dinh Trac believes that traditional Vietnamese philosophy is constituted by tam tai philosophy, yin-yang metaphysics, and agricultural philosophy. These three strands are illustrated by the various symbols on the upper surface of the Dong ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Tran Van Doan, professor of philosophy at National Taiwan University (1996)&lt;ref&gt;"Tu Viet triet toi Viet than," Dinh Huong 11 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; considers that Vietnamese philosophy is [[humanistic]] but not [[anthropocentric]].&lt;ref&gt;Fumitaka Matsuoka, Eleazar S.

==Notable philosophers==
The confucian poet-philosopher-scholar is typified by [[Lê Quý Đôn]]. Other confucianists include [[Chu Văn An]] (1292–1370) mandarin, [[Lê Quát]] a 14th Century anti-Buddhist Confucian writer, [[Mạc Đĩnh Chi]] (1280–1350), [[Nguyễn Trãi]] (1380–1442) a famous Đại Việt Confucian scholar, [[Nguyen Khuyen|Nguyễn Khuyến]] (1835-1909). Notable modern Vietnamese philosophers include Cao Xuân Huy ([[:vi:Cao Xuân Huy|vi]], 1900-1983), Nguyễn Duy Quý ([[:vi:Nguyễn Duy Quý|vi]], 1932-), Nguyễn Đức Bình ([[:vi:Nguyễn Đức Bình|vi]], 1927-), Nguyễn Đăng Thục ([[:vi:Nguyễn Đăng Thục|vi]], 1909-1999), Phạm Công Thiện ([[:vi:Phạm Công Thiện|vi]], 1941-2011), Trần Văn Giàu ([[:vi:Trần Văn Giàu|vi]], 1911–2010), modern marxist philosopher [[Tran Duc Thao|Trần Đức Thảo]] (noted in Paris in the 1960s) and Vietnamese Catholic philosopher [[Lương Kim Định]].

'''Vladimir Nikolayevich Lossky'''{{efn|Pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˌ|n|ɪ|k|ə|ˈ|l|aɪ|.|ə|v|ɪ|tʃ|_|ˈ|l|ɒ|s|k|i}}.}} ({{lang-ru|Влади́мир Никола́евич Ло́сский}}; 1903–1958) was an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] [[theologian]] in exile from Russia. He emphasized ''[[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]'' as the main principle of Eastern Orthodox Christianity.

==Biography==
Vladimir Nicolaevich Lossky was born on 8 June ([[Old Style and New Style dates|OS]] 26 May) 1903 in [[Göttingen]], [[German Empire|Germany]].{{sfnm |1a1=N. Lossky |1y=1999 |1p=288 |2a1=Williams |2y=1975 |2p=1}} His father, [[Nikolai Lossky]], was professor of philosophy in [[Saint Petersburg]].{{sfn|N.&amp;nbsp;O. Lossky|1952|pp=4, 395}} Lossky was profoundly changed when he witnessed the trial which led to the execution of [[Benjamin of Petrograd|Metropolitan Benjamin]] of St Petersburg by the [[Soviets]]. Metropolitan Benjamin was later canonized by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].{{sfn|N. Lossky|1999|p=288}} In 1919, he enrolled as a student in the faculty of Arts at [[Petrograd University]]; but in 1922 he and his father were [[philosophers' ship|exiled]] from Soviet Russia. From 1922 to 1926 he continued his studies at Prague and in 1927 graduated at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in Paris in [[medieval philosophy]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} He married Madeleine Shapiro on 4 June 1928.{{sfn|Sauvé|2010|p=49}}

Lossky settled in Paris in 1924.{{sfn|Prokurat|Golitzin|Peterson|2010|p=207}} Peterson From 1942 until 1958 he was a member of the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} He served as the first dean of the [[St. Dionysius Institute in Paris]].{{sfn|Williams|1975|p=28}} He taught [[dogmatic theology]] and [[ecclesiastical history]] in this institute until 1953, and from 1953 to 1958 in the diocese of the patriarchate of Moscow, "rue Pétel" in Paris. He was a member of the Brotherhood Saint Photius and the ecumenical [[Fellowship of Saint Alban and Saint Sergius]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} His best-known work is ''Essai sur la theologie mystique de l'Eglise d'orient''{{sfn|Williams|1975|p=i}} (1944) (English translation, ''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'' (1957)).

Lossky died of a [[heart attack]] on 7 February 1958 in Paris.{{sfnm |1a1=Louth |1y=2015 |1p=98 |2a1=Morrel |2y=1959 |2p=35}}

==Theology==
Lossky's main theological concern was [[exegesis]] of [[mystical theology]] in Christian traditions. He argued in ''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'' (1944) that theologians of the Orthodox tradition maintained the mystical dimension of theology in a more integrated way than those of the Catholic and Reformed traditions after the [[East–West Schism]] because the latter misunderstood such Greek terms as [[ousia]], [[Hypostasis (religion)|hypostasis]], [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]], and [[theoria]]. In illustration of his argument he cites the collection known as the [[Philokalia]] and [[John Climacus]]'s [https://web.archive.org/web/20110120191953/http://orthodoxwiki.org/The_Ladder_of_Divine_Ascent Ladder of Divine Ascent], as well as works by [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]], [[Gregory of Nyssa]], [[Basil of Caesarea]], [[Gregory Nazianzen]], and [[Gregory Palamas]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} [[Georges Florovsky]] termed Lossky's ''Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'' a "neopatristic synthesis".{{sfn|N.&amp;nbsp;O. Lossky|1952|p=395}}

The genius of Eastern mystical theology lay, he contended, in its ''[[apophatic theology|apophatic]]'' character, which he defined as the understanding that God is radically unknowable in human, thus philosophical, terms. Consequently, God's special revelation in Scripture must be preserved in all of its integrity by means of the distinction between the ineffable divine essence and the inaccessible nature of the Holy Trinity, on the one hand, and the positive revelation of the Trinitarian energies, on the other. "When we speak of the Trinity in itself," said Lossky, "we are confessing, in our poor and always defective human language, the mode of existence of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, one sole God who cannot but be Trinity, because He is the living God of Revelation, Who, though unknowable, has made Himself known, through the incarnation of the Son, to all who have received the Holy Spirit, Who proceeds from the Father and is sent into the world in the name of the incarnate Son."{{sfn|V. Lossky|1974|p=89}} The Trinitarian processions in revelation thus produce the energies which human beings experience as grace and by which they are sanctified or "deified".
In his ''Mystical Theology'' he argued that the theologians of the undivided Church understood that theosis was above knowledge ([[gnosis]]).{{sfn|N.&amp;nbsp;O. Lossky|1952|pp=395–401}}{{page range too broad|date=October 2018}}

This was further clarified in his work, ''Vision of God'' (or [[theoria]]). In both works Lossky also stresses the differences between Christian thinkers such as Pseudo-Dionysius and such thinkers as [[Plotinus]] and the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]], asserting that Christianity and Neoplatonism, though they share common culture and concepts, have very different understandings of God and [[ontology]].

Vladimir Lossky, like his close friend [[Georges Florovsky]], was opposed to the [[sophiology|sophiological]] theories of [[Sergei Bulgakov]] and [[Vladimir Sergeyevich Solovyov|Vladimir Soloviev]]. In the words of Nicholas Lossky, "One characteristic of his theology that should be underscored, is that he was not, and always refused to be, a direct descendant of the famous Russian 'religious philosophy'."{{sfn|N. Lossky|1999|p=289}} The term ''[[Russian philosophy|Russian religious philosophy]]'' had its origin in the works of the [[slavophile]] movement and its core concept of [[sobornost]], which was later used and developed by [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Soloviev]].

==Eastern theological definitions==
{{tone|section|date=October 2018}}
Lossky also expressed in ''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'' that the Trinity is a doctrine with its technical terms rooted in Hebrew [[hermeneutics]], Greek [[Platonism|Platonic]] and [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] philosophy as well. The [[Trinity|triune]] God being of one [[ousia|essence]] or being, which is reflective of mankind hypostatically, inside out. God and experience coming into the person from the external world and into the soul by the influence of the Holy Spirit. The [[freewill]] of man functioning as a means to choose good or evil and or choose God or reject God (i.e. blaspheme the Holy Spirit). [[Hypostatic union|Hypostasis]] meaning existence of God. Ousia as essence or being, is the aspect of God that is completely incomprehensible to mankind and human perception, since it is beyond created or is uncreated. The essence of God, being in the Father (primordial origin) and then given to the Son (begotten of the Father not made) and the Holy Spirit (which proceeds from the Father) both as the hands of God. [[Ousia]] as essence or being, defined as "all that ''subsists'' by itself and which has not its being in another."{{sfn|V. Lossky|1991|pp=50–51}}

===Triune God in essence is the only uncreated being===
The concept of the [[Trinity|Triune]] God being a single God in [[essence]] or [[Ousia]] (as [[Infinity (philosophy)|uncreated]]). A single God who as Father or infinite origin is an existence, as Son or flesh is an existence and as Spirit is an existence. One God in one Father.

===God the Father===
The Father of the Trinity is uncreated hyper-being (beyond being) in essence or [[ousia]] as such is the ''truly'' [[Infinity|infinite]], [[:wikt:primordial|primordial]] or [[original]], uncreated origin, the reality of which all things and beings originate from, as the Father [[Hypostasis (religion)|Hypostasis]]. The Father hypostasis in using the term God is used primarily as the name for God. As the term ''God'' is interchangeable with the term ''Father''. As Jesus Christ is the Son of God, Son of the Father and the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of the Father.{{sfn|Hopko|1984|loc=ch.&amp;nbsp;"The Holy Trinity", s.v.&amp;nbsp;[https://oca.org/orthodoxy/the-orthodox-faith/doctrine-scripture/the-holy-trinity/one-god-one-father One God, One Father]}}

===God the Son===
The Son of God or [[Jesus Christ]] expressing the [[logos]] or perfection as the highest ideal, in the material world and God in the flesh. Christ as well, representing mankind, which he inherited from the [[Theotokos]]. Christ manifest as ''generated'' and or begotten (not made) in essence uncreated, by and from God the Father{{efn|[[John of Damascus]] wrote: {{quote|Whatsoever the Son has from the Father, the Spirit also has, including His very being. And if the Father does not exist, then neither does the Son and the Spirit; and if the Father does not have something, then neither has the Son or the Spirit. Furthermore, because of the Father, that is, because the Father is, the Son and the Spirit are; and because of the Father, the Son and the Spirit have everything that they have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John of Damascus |author-link=John of Damascus |title=An Exact Exposition of the Orthodox Faith}} Cited in {{harvnb|Meyendorff|1983|p=183}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}}} as another [[reality]], [[Hypostasis (religion)|Hypostasis]] of God.

===God the Holy Spirit===
The Holy Spirit himself being light, life, animation and the source of the [[Essence–energies distinction|uncreated light]] [[Tabor light|photomos]], [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] and/or illumination, who proceeds or is manifest by ''procession'' from God the Father as another [[Hypostasis (religion)|Hypostasis]] of God. The Holy Spirit and the Christ being the hands of God the Father, reaching in from the infinite into the finite{{efn|[[Irenaeus]] wrote: "Now man is a mixed organization of soul and flesh, who was formed after the likeness of God, and moulded by His hands, that is, by the Son and Holy Spirit, to whom also He said, 'Let Us make man.'"{{sfn|Irenaeus|1994|p=463}}}} (see [[Irenaeus]]).

===Created being===
All things that are not God are created beings or are created in their essence. Mankind possesses [[free will]] in his finite nature, mankind exists in an [[indeterminacy (philosophy)|indeterminate]] world.{{sfn|Witte|Alexander|2006}} Things as such in their subsistence, are dependent upon something other than themselves. As such divine beings (such as [[Angels]]) are created beings the origin of their being is ''[[ex nihilo]]''. All things that are not God, are created in essence or being. God as hyper-being, and or in essence uncreated can be, by way of his existences, the infinite while generating himself as a man and also be the spirit, that by procession (from him God, Father), animates life.

===Energies of God===
{{see also|Essence–energies distinction}}
All three hypostasis sharing a common essence or [[ousia]] or being, which is referred to as God. The ousia of God being completely unknowable or incomprehensible to mankind since it is uncreated where as [[nihilism|nothingness]] as well as mankind are created (see [[Nikolai Berdyaev]]). The energies of God the Father having the same hyper-being in that they are without cause and or uncreated (see [[Gregory Palamas]]). God's energies as uncreated and indestructible. God the Father (the Father as the monarchos) in his being is not self generated, nor generated from any other, hence the incomprehensibility of God. The Trinity having existences ([[hypostatic union|hypostasis]]) that are comprehensible, but a being that is not created and beyond all things (including nothingness) therefore God's hyper-being ([[ousia]]) is incomprehensible. Lossky points out that God's existences can be spoken of but not his being. If one then speaks of God's essence or being as anything outside of incomprehensible, one speaks in direct contradiction to the [[theoria]] of Christianity and as such are not true theologians and are instead speaking of God through speculations, rather than experience.

==Mysticism and theology==
For Lossky, Christian mysticism and dogmatic theology were one and the same. According to Lossky mysticism ''is'' Orthodox dogma ''par excellence''. The Christian life of prayer and worship is the foundation for dogmatic theology, and the dogma of the church help Christians in their struggle for sanctification and deification. Without dogma future generations lose the specific [[orthodoxy]] ([[phronema|right mind]]) and [[orthopraxis]] (right practice) of the [[Eastern Orthodox]] path to salvation (see [[soteriology]]).
