The '''3,000 billion [[Iranian toman|toman]] [[embezzlement]] in Iran''' (also 2,800 billion embezzlement; approximately US$943.5 million){{clarify|date=May 2014|reason=is "2,800 billion embezzlement" supposed to read "'2,800 billion embezzlement'" or "'''2,800 billion embezzlement'''"?}} was a fraud involving the use of forged documents to obtain credit from at least seven Iranian state and private banks to purchase state-owned companies.&lt;ref name=Gladstone/&gt; The fraud reportedly extended over a four-year period, but became more serious "in the months before the scandal broke in September" 2011.&lt;ref name=Gladstone/&gt;&lt;ref name=washpost/&gt; According to Iranian newspapers, Iranian businessman [[Mahafarid Amir Khosravi]] (also known as Amir-Mansour Aria and executed in 2014) "masterminded" the scam, and as of late October 2011 at least 67 people have been interrogated and 31 of them have been arrested.&lt;ref name=Gladstone&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/world/middleeast/new-arrests-and-interrogations-in-iran-fraud-case.html?_r=1 Iran Makes New Arrests in Fraud Case]. Rick Gladstone. ''The New York Times'' 25 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mostafa Pour Mohammadi]], the head of a judicial investigations unit, has called the case "the most unprecedented financial corruption case in the history" of Iran.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; The scandal has also been called "politically sensitive", involving [[Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei]], a close aide to President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], opposed by conservatives.&lt;ref name=washpost/&gt;

==Overview==
According to [[Iranian government]] newspapers and TV channels, the fraud was planned within seven state-owned and private banks, including [[Saderat Bank of Iran]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chief suspect arrested in Iran bank scam|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/199896.html|publisher=Press TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the largest and most important fraud in Iran history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iran arrests 19 involved in embezzlement scandal|url=http://english.cntv.cn/20110919/113108.shtml|publisher=english.cntv.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fraud reportedly was first identified at [[Bank Melli Iran|Bank Melli]], Iran's largest commercial bank.&lt;ref name=Gladstone/&gt;

According to the ''[[New York Times]]'' and ''[[Washington Post]]'' newspapers, the embezzlement was a "scheme to use forged documents or letters of credit to acquire assets, "including major state-owned companies" or "privatized government assets",&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; (such as the Khuzestan Steel Company, a major steel producer&lt;ref name=AP&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/13/world/middleeast/13iran.html "Iran Accuses Businessman of Bank Fraud"]. Associated Press. ''The New York Times'' (12 September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;) at "one of Iran's top financial institutions", [[Saderat Bank of Iran|Bank Saderat]].&lt;ref name=washpost/&gt;

According to government media, the economics ministry tipped the intelligence authorities about suspicious loan applications in the banking system and the main culprits are as of May 2014 in police custody.&lt;ref name=biggest/&gt;

Iranian state prosecutor [[Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje'i]] said 19 people have been arrested for being involved in a bank embezzlement scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Main Suspects Arrested in Iran Bank Embezzlement|url=http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=9006270087|publisher=Farsnews|accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Washington Post'' reports 22 suspects "including businessmen and bank officials" have been arrested, and the chiefs of two banks have been dismissed. On 27 September 2011, [[Mahomud-Reza Khavari]] abruptly resigned as the managing director of Bank Melli and flew to Canada after the bank was implicated in the fraud. However, a spokesman for the bank stated that Khavari had gone to Canada for "ordinary business reasons".&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/30/world/middleeast/iran-bankers-return-sought-in-bank-scandal.html?_r=1 "Iran: Banker's Return Sought in Bank Scandal"]. ''The New York Times'' (29 September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigation determined that [[Mahafarid Amir Khosravi]] had masterminded the scheme, with his Aria Investment Development Company being the primary recipient of the loans. Khosravi was convicted of [[embezzlement]], [[money laundering]], and bribery.  He and three of his closest associates received the death penalty in July 2012.&lt;ref name=PressTV&gt;{{cite news|title=Iran hangs main convict in biggest banking fraud|publisher=Press TV|date=24 May 2014|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2014/05/24/363920/iran-hangs-convict-in-biggest-bank-fraud/|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USAToday /&gt; A total of 39 people were convicted of fraud in the case. On 24 May 2014, Khosravi was executed by hanging. Khavari remains a fugitive.&lt;ref name=USAToday&gt;{{cite news|title=Iran billionaire executed over $2.6B bank fraud|date=24 May 2014|work=USA Today|agency=Associated Press|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/05/24/iran-billionaire-executed-over-26b-bank-fraud/9535639/|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response to scandal==

===Supreme Leader===
On 3 October 2011, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told viewers of Iranian state TV "People should know all these (responsible) will be pursued. ... God willing, the traitorous hands will be cut." The leader also stated the media should not use the case to "strike at officials."&lt;ref name=washpost&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/industries/irans-supreme-leader-calls-for-cutting-traitorous-hands-in-huge-bank-scam/2011/10/03/gIQAq6eoHL_story.html Iran's supreme leader calls for ‘cutting traitorous hands' in huge bank scam]. Associated Press,. ''The Washington Post'' (3 October 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parliament===
The speaker of the [[Iranian parliament]], [[Ali Larijani]], said that all three branches of the government were determined to deal with the recent banking scam case.&lt;ref name=biggest&gt;{{cite web|title=Iranian authorities investigate biggest banking fraud|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/199845.html|publisher=Press TV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No escaping justice in bank scam case|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/199898.html|publisher=Press TV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ahmad Tavakkoli]], a member of parliament, said on 18 September 2011 that the embezzlement of 28 trillion [[Iranian rial|rials]] (3,000 billion [[Iranian toman|toman]]) is an intolerable scandal, adding that if administration officials are not able to handle the affairs, they should step down. In addition, he said that a number of members of parliament have introduced a motion, which envisages the establishment of a special committee to pursue the embezzlement case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Embezzlement in Iran is 'intolerable scandal'|url=http://www.oananews.org/view.php?id=200408&amp;ch=|date=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mahmoud Ahmadinejad===
On 16 September 2011, Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] rejected the accusations against some of his administration's officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iranian parliament meets over embezzlement scandal, vows to pursue corruption|url=http://www2.chinadaily.com.cn/xinhua/2011-09-18/content_3817085.html|work=China Daily|accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative critics of Ahmadinejad have accused his close aide [[Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei]] (whom the conservatives strongly oppose) of having connections with Amir-Mansour Aria.&lt;ref name=washpost/&gt;

'''2011–12 Palestinian protests''' were a series of protests in the [[Palestinian National Authority]] and the [[Hamas Government in Gaza|Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip]], staged by various [[Palestinian Arabs|Palestinian]] groups as part of the wider [[Arab Spring]]. The protests were aimed to protest against the Palestinian government, as well as supporting the popular uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt and Syria. The first phase of protests took place during 2011 and the second phase in 2012.

Some suggested the 2012 protests were also inspired by the Arab Spring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/0911/breaking27.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrators were protesting against the economic policies of the [[Palestinian National Authority]] (PNA), and the increasing cost of living.&lt;ref name="Ma'an9-10"&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=518944 Clashes, stone-throwing break out in West Bank price protests]. [[Ma'an News Agency]]. 10 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 September 2012, the PNA raised the price of fuel, as well as the [[value added tax]] rate. Mass demonstrations have taken place throughout the Palestinian Authority territory, including in  [[Ramallah]], [[Nablus]], [[Balata refugee camp|Balata Camp]], [[Bir Zeit]], [[Jalazone|Jalazun Camp]], [[Hebron]], [[Bethlehem]], [[Beit Jala]], [[Dheisheh|Dheisheh Camp]], [[Jenin]], [[Jericho]], [[Tulkarm]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=518957 In photos: Price protests continue across West Bank]. [[Ma'an News Agency]]. 10 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dura, Hebron|Dura]].&lt;ref name="HaaretzAvi"/&gt; 2012 Protests have been characterized by road closures, tire burning, [[self-immolation]]s,&lt;ref name="HaaretzAvi"&gt;Issacharof, Avi.

''[[Haaretz]]''. 4 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ma'anImmolation"/&gt; peaceful demonstrations, stone throwing clashes and workers' strikes.

==First phase==

===Goals===
The goal of the early protests were to unify the two ruling parties, [[Fatah]] and [[Hamas]]. Other reasons included [[unemployment]], [[inflation]], and lack of [[economic growth]].

===February 2011===
The [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]] prevented several demonstrations in support of protesters in Tunisia and Egypt. On 3 February, Palestinian police dispersed an anti-Mubarak demonstration in downtown [[Ramallah]], detaining four people, confiscating a cameraman's footage, and reportedly beating protesters. A smaller pro-Mubarak demonstration was permitted to take place in the same area and was guarded by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4023635,00.html |title=PA bans anti-Mubarak protest |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===October 2011===
On 15 October, an anti-Assad protest expressing solidarity with [[Palestinian refugee]]s in [[Syria]] affected by the unrest there took place in the [[Gaza Strip]], and was attended by 150 people. [[Hamas]] police forces dispersed the demonstration, claiming that it was held without a permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Issacharoff |first=Avi |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/hamas-disperses-anti-assad-protest-in-gaza-1.379129 |title=Hamas disperses anti-Assad protest in Gaza |work=Haaretz Daily Newspaper |accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outcome===
On 1 February 2012 the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]] announced that it would hold [[Palestinian local elections, 2011|municipal elections]] in July. Some sources speculated that this announcement was a reaction to the anti-government protests in Egypt. The elections were however postponed to 22 October 2012, then suspended indefinitely due to an internal division within the Palestinian Authority over candidates for many of the municipalities and councils, and fears that Hamas supporters would back Palestinian Authority opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3903431,00.html |title=Palestinian local elections postponed |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second phase==

===Causes===
A rise in fuel prices, lowered quality of living and the current financial crisis and unpaid monthly salary payments for about 150,000 Palestinian workers have sparked the protests. The PNA is currently going through a financial crisis. In addition, the PNA has warned of potential cuts in electricity for large areas in the West Banks, prompting a rise in social tensions. Much of the demonstrators' anger has been directed towards the government of Prime Minister [[Salam Fayyad]].&lt;ref name="APHadid"&gt;Hadid, Diaa. [https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hY9DzEdbk8JMPRYs0JYIV0T_tKJA?docId=ed69d41033414afaa0202a262ec7c67e Palestinian protests turn violent in West Bank]. [[Associated Press]]. 10 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1994 [[Protocol on Economic Relations]] has also been targeted, an interim agreement that is part of the [[Oslo accords]] whereby Israel controls Palestinian trade and collects taxes on behalf of the PNA.&lt;ref name="SMHPollard"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=518826 Israel Deputy FM: No room for review of Paris Protocol]. [[Ma'an News Agency]]. 10 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Further sources which point out the centrality to the Paris Protocol have also made the claim that these have been the first protests on the Palestinian [[West Bank]] not to be purely "political".&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.dohainstitute.org/release/94454f0f-ed0b-40c1-b9b3-58c5b6f0b525  "The Palestinian Protests of September 2012: The Birth of a Social Protest Movement"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of Israeli restrictions on the Palestinian economy, the PNA relies on foreign aid.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Due to delays in the funding by the [[United States]] and various [[Arab League|Arab]] countries, the accumulating budget deficit has become a financial crisis for the PNA.&lt;ref name="APHadid"/&gt; Professor and former PNA spokesman [[Ghassan Khatib]] further states that the expansion of [[Israeli settlement]]s and the subsequent confiscation of cultivable land and other natural resources has increased the PNA's dependence on foreign funds as well as the "exhaustion" of other venues such as taking bank loans and borrowing from the private sector.&lt;ref name="SMHPollard"/&gt;

===Timeline===

====September 2012====
'''4 September''' - Mass protests involving thousands of Palestinians were held in cities throughout the West Bank in protest of price rises, higher costs of living, Salam Fayyad's handling of the financial crisis and the Paris Protocol. Several demonstrating groups also stressed they were protesting against the Israeli occupation in addition to dire conditions. In Hebron dozens of public transport vehicles drove from the northern to southern ends of the city protesting the cost of fuel, while hundreds of people participated in protests held in the city center. An effigy of Prime Minister Fayyad was set alight.

Smaller demonstrations occurred in [[Ramallah]], [[Bethlehem]] and [[Jenin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=517262 Protests across West Bank against high cost of living]. [[Ma'an News Agency]]. 11 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In the city of [[Dura, Hebron|al-Dura]] in the southern West Bank, 42-year-old Khaled Abu Rabee poured gasoline over himself and entered the municipal hall in an apparent [[self-immolation]] attempt. He was stopped by a security guard.&lt;ref name="Ma'anImmolation"/&gt;

'''5 September''' - In Ramallah a man from [[Gaza City|Gaza]] unsuccessfully attempted to set himself and his 6-year-old daughter who has cancer alight in protest of his inability to pay for her cancer treatment and the costly price of living. He was stopped by police who arrested him.&lt;ref name="Ma'anImmolation"&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=517527 Man tries to set self on fire in Ramallah]. [[Ma'an News Agency]]. 5 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, school children protested the prices of basic goods in [[Beit Jala]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=517544 School children protest high prices in Beit Jala]. [[Ma'an News Agency]]. 11 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to growing protests in the West Bank, Palestinian President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] announced that the "Palestinian Spring," drawing relation to the regional [[Arab Spring]], had begun. He further quoted a Palestinian proverb that "hunger is disloyal," acknowledging that people think of feeding their families as the top priority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=517618 President says Palestinian Spring has begun]. [[Ma'an News Agency]]. 5 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''6 September''' - Demonstrations continued in West Bank cities. In Bethlehem, Beit Jala and Beit Sahour mostly young protesters forced many streets to close for traffic. Hundreds gathered to demonstrate in Nativity Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=517988 Bethlehem streets shut over economic protests]. [[Ma'an News Agency]]. 6 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In Jenin protesters demanded the resignation of Salam Fayyad, while in [[Tulkarm]] demonstrators marched with donkeys in a gesture to the rising price of conventional transport. Taxi drivers began a mass strike to protest rising fuel prices. Fayyad announced on [[Voice of Palestine]] radio that he was "ready to resign" but the replacement of government officials would not alleviate the PNA's financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=517945 Fayyad 'ready to resign']. [[Ma'an News Agency]]. 6 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''7 September''' - [[Palestinian National Initiative]] declared its support for protests against rising costs of living in the West Bank, and called for a "radical change" in economic policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=518062  	 PNI calls for 'radical change' in economic policy]. Ma'an News Agency. 7 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''8 September''' - Dozens of protesters closed down several streets in Tulkarm and Ramallah on Saturday, as protests against rising living costs continue across the West Bank. A main road in Tulkarm was blocked with rocks and burning tires and protesters in Ramallah closed off several streets in the city center. President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] reiterated that Israel and some Arab countries share the blame for the PA’s financial crisis. He said the Palestinian Authority will not seek to stop the popular protests as long as they remain peaceful and do not harm public interests. However, he stressed that the government would not allow any attacks on public property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=518380 Dozens of protesters burn tires in Ramallah, Tulkarem]. Ma'an News Agency. 8 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''9 September''' - Demonstrators in Ramallah called on President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] to resign on Sunday, as protests over the rising cost of living continue in the West Bank. Truck drivers blocked traffic in Ramallah's Manara Square as people marched in the city center against the economic policies of the Palestinian Authority. A leader in the popular protests, Mahir Amir, told ''Ma'an News Agency'' that protesters wanted to send a message to President Abbas to urge him to annul the Paris Protocol with Israel. The protests also demand that the PLO plays an appropriate role in controlling the Palestinian Authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=518656 Ramallah protestors call on Abbas to resign]. Ma'an News Agency. 9 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''10 September''' - Taxi drivers, teachers shopkeepers and other Palestinian workers joined a general strike.&lt;ref name="SMHPollard"&gt;Pollard, Ruth. [http://www.smh.com.au/world/crisis-deepens-as-mass-protests-hit-west-bank-20120909-25mf0.html Crisis deepens as mass protests hit West Bank]. ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]''. 10 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The head of the West Bank's Union of Public Transport, Nasser Younis, stated that over 24,000 drivers were participating, while the taxi union director in Jenin reported that 700 cars and 120 buses had joined. Activity in cities, towns and refugee camps have been largely frozen as a result of the public transportation strike.&lt;ref name="Ma'an9-10"/&gt;

In [[Hebron]] police clashed with protesters who targeted [[Municipality (Palestinian Authority)|the city's municipal]] offices and fire trucks. Afterwards, several thousand demonstrators threw stones at a police station in the city. Police responded with tear gas to disperse the protests. According to [[Ma'an News Agency]], dozens of protesters and police were injured. The governor of the [[Hebron Governorate]] Kamal Hmeid accused a "lawless minority" for the clashes.&lt;ref name="Ma'an9-10"/&gt;

Clashes also occurred in Bethlehem at the Bab al-Zaqaq crossroads after taxi drivers blocked the entry of traffic. Further confrontations broke out near Karkafeh Street when several people hurled stones at trucks blocking the street as part of the protests. In the city's [[Dheisheh]] refugee camp, demonstrators marched toward's President Abbas's local presidential headquarters chanting slogans condemning him, Prime Minister Fayyad, and the [[Protocol on Economic Relations|Paris Protocol]]. In order to prevent clashes, protest organizers formed a human chain to separate themselves from the security forces. Protests demanding the resignation of Fayyad erupted in nearby Beit Jala.

In Ramallah demonstrators burned tires and garbage bins as they blocked off several of the city's main roads.

'''26 September''' - About 500 Palestinians protested in the [[Bureij]] refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, where demonstrations against the [[Hamas]] government are rare. They began following the death of a boy resident as a result of a fire during a power outage, a frequent occurrence in the Gaza Strip due to the short supply of fuel. Protesters called for the downfall of the Hamas administration, which they accused of being incompetent, and also laid blame at the rival government in the West Bank headed by Fayyad and Abbas. Hamas spokesman Taher al-Nono blamed Egypt for the fuel crisis and the international community for allowing the continuation of the [[blockade of the Gaza Strip]].&lt;ref&gt;Al-Mughrabi, Nidal.

====October 2015====
'''2 October''' - Around 200 people demonstrated in the West Bank city of Ramallah to demand the resignation of Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas. Waving flags and shouting "Abu Mazen (Abbas) leave," they marched from the central Al-Manara Square towards the presidential headquarters. They were blocked by police and there were some scuffles before the marchers dispersed. The march had been called to denounce the arrest in the West Bank, controlled by Abbas's Fatah party, of partisans of the Islamist movement Hamas, and arrests in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip of Fatah sympathisers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=54675].

[[File:Abhideyaka Abhishekam (Diamond).jpg|150px|thumb|Lord [[Malayappa swami]] as seen after ''Abhideyaka Abhishekam'' in his diamond ''kavacham'']]
'''Abhideyaka Abhishekam''' is a festival conducted in the [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] in [[India]]. The purpose of the festival is to conduct special ''Abhishekam'' to protect the Utsava deities - Lord [[Malayappa swami]] and his consorts ''Sridevi'' and ''Bhudevi'' from damage that might occur while conducting processions and ''Tirumanjanam'' (holy baths).

==Festival details==
[[File:Abhideyaka Abhishekam.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Lord Malayappa swami and his consorts as seen in their pearl ''kavacham'' during Abhideyaka Abhishekam festival]]
The festival is performed in the [[Hindu calendar]] month of Jyesta. In the [[Gregorian Calendar]], this falls in June/July. Because of the association with the ''Jyesta'' month,  the festival is also called as ''Jyestabhishekam''. 

The festival lasts three days&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/06/10/stories/2006061013820400.htm|title=Temple ritual |publisher=[[The Hindu]]|date=2006-06-10|accessdate=2007-05-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070403004629/http://www.hindu.com/2006/06/10/stories/2006061013820400.htm| archivedate= 3 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on each of these days, after the [[Day in Tirumala#Second bell|second bell]], the lord and his consorts are taken to the ''Kalyanotsava mantapa'' (Hall used for celestial wedding) and ''Snapana Tirumanjanam'' is conducted amidst vedic chants. Snapana Tirumanjanam involves performing a bath to the deities involving holy and consecrated water mixed with spices including [[turmeric]]. The lord and his consorts are attired in different ''kavacham'' (armours) on each of these days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tirumala.org/sevas_perdes.htm#aa|title=Abhideyaka Abhishekam|publisher=[[Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams|TTD]]|accessdate=2007-05-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516003023/http://www.tirumala.org/sevas_perdes.htm#aa|archivedate=16 May 2007|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Svarna kavacham is adorned to the Lord and his consorts throughout the year as well.

==Festival history==
There is no record on the history of the festival and the start dates.

==Pilgrim access==
The festival is considered as ''Arjitha Seva'' (paid service) and hence devotees can pay to view the performance of the ''Abhishekam''. The purchase of a ticket allows access five people to the ''Kalyanotsava mantapa'' and the primary ticket holder is gifted ''Vastram'' (One Upper Cloth and a blouse), One [[laddu]] and one [[Vada (food)|vada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tirumala.org/sevas_per.htm|title=Periodic Sevas|publisher=[[Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams|TTD]]|accessdate=2007-05-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514214720/http://www.tirumala.org/sevas_per.htm|archivedate=14 May 2007|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''balance sheet recession''' is a type of [[economic recession]] that occurs when high levels of private sector debt cause individuals or companies to collectively focus on saving by paying down debt rather than spending or investing, causing [[GDP|economic growth]] to slow or decline. The term is attributed to economist [[Richard Koo]] and is related to the [[debt deflation]] concept described by economist [[Irving Fisher]]. Recent examples include [[Lost Decade (Japan)|Japan's recession]] that began in 1990 and the [[subprime mortgage crisis|U.S. recession]] of 2007-2009.

==Definition==
A balance sheet recession is a particular type of [[recession]] driven by the high levels of private sector debt (i.e., the credit cycle) rather than fluctuations in the business cycle. It is characterized by a change in private sector behavior towards saving (i.e., paying down debt) rather than spending, which slows the economy through a reduction in consumption by households or investment by business. The term [[balance sheet]] derives from an [[accounting equation]] that holds that assets must always equal the sum of liabilities plus equity. If asset prices fall below the value of the debt incurred to purchase them, then the equity must be negative, meaning the consumer or business is insolvent. Until it regains solvency, the entity will focus on debt repayment.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaNxAzLKegU Richard Koo-A Balance Sheet Recession-June 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that a balance sheet recession essentially is the same phenomenon that the German economist [[Wilhelm Röpke]] and [[Austrian School]] economists in the 1930s denoted as a secondary deflation.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, Andreas Hardhaug. "Wilhelm Röpke and Richard C. Koo On Secondary Deflations and Balance Sheet Recessions." Economic Affairs 35.2 (2015): 215-224.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
High levels of indebtedness or the bursting of a real estate or financial asset price bubble can cause a balance sheet recession. This is when large numbers of consumers or corporations pay down debt (i.e., save) rather than spend or invest, which slows the economy. Economist [[Richard Koo|Richard C. Koo]] wrote in 2009 that under ideal conditions, a country's economy should have the household sector as net savers and the corporate sector as net borrowers, with the government budget nearly balanced and net exports near zero.&lt;ref name="Koo 2009"&gt;{{cite book

Policy responses are often designed to drive the economy back towards this ideal state of balance.

Rather than savings by households being invested by businesses, as is the case under typical economic conditions, the savings remains in the banking system and will not be invested by businesses regardless of interest rate. A large [[sectoral balances|private sector financial surplus]] (savings greater than investment), a proverbial "hole" in the economy, can develop.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

[[Paul Krugman]] wrote in July 2014: "The logic of a balance sheet recession is straightforward. Imagine that for whatever reason people have grown careless about both borrowing and lending, so that many families and/or firms have taken on high levels of debt. And suppose that at some point people more or less suddenly realize that these high debt levels are risky. At that point debtors will face strong pressures from their creditors to “deleverage,” slashing their spending in an effort to pay down debt. But when many people slash spending at the same time, the result will be a depressed economy. This can turn into a self-reinforcing spiral, as falling incomes make debt seem even less supportable, leading to deeper cuts; but in any case, the overhang of debt can keep the economy depressed for a long time."&lt;ref name="nybooks.com"/&gt;

[[Martin Wolf]] wrote in July 2012: "Now consider what happens when the asset prices start to fall. Debtors will be unambiguously poorer. Creditors will also feel poorer, since their assets will have deteriorated in quality. Financial intermediaries will become both insolvent and illiquid. There is likely to be a systemic financial crisis. The supply of credit to the private sector will halt. Borrowing will shrink. Investment, particularly in new housing, will collapse. The desired savings of the heavily indebted will rise, as they seek to pay down excessive debt. Creditors, too, will become far more cautious, as they recognise how vulnerable they have become to a wave of bankruptcy among their debtors. The overall effect will be big cutbacks in spending and a deep recession, if not worse. A big financial crisis will accelerate the cuts and turn the recession into a potential depression. That is, of course, what happened in 2008. The effects of the emergence of balance-sheet constraints on spending and borrowing will, in brief, be revealed in the huge financial surpluses in the private sectors of crisis-hit economies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.ft.com/martin-wolf-exchange/2012/07/25/getting-out-of-debt-by-adding-debt/ Financial Times-Martin Wolf-Getting Out of Debt by Adding Debt-July 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical examples==

===Japan 1990–2005===
For example, economist Richard Koo wrote that Japan's "Great Recession" that began in 1990 was a "balance sheet recession." It was triggered by a collapse in land and stock prices, which caused Japanese firms to have [[negative equity]], meaning their assets were worth less than their liabilities. Despite zero interest rates and expansion of the money supply to encourage borrowing, Japanese corporations in aggregate opted to pay down their debts from their own business earnings rather than borrow to invest as firms typically do. Corporate investment, a key demand component of GDP, fell enormously (22% of GDP) between 1990 and its peak decline in 2003. Japanese firms overall became net savers after 1998, as opposed to borrowers. Koo argues that it was massive fiscal stimulus (borrowing and spending by the government) that offset this decline and enabled Japan to maintain its level of GDP. In his view, this avoided a U.S. type [[Great Depression]], in which U.S. GDP fell by 46%. He argued that monetary policy (e.g., central banks lowering key interest rates) was ineffective because there was limited demand for funds while firms paid down their liabilities, even at near-zero interest rates. In a balance sheet recession, GDP declines by the amount of debt repayment and un-borrowed individual savings, leaving government stimulus spending as the primary remedy.&lt;ref name="Koo 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Koo 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gregory White|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/richard-koo-recession-2010-4#-1 |title=Presentation by Richard Koo – The Age of Balance Sheet Recessions |publisher=Businessinsider.com |date=14 April 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koo wrote in 2010 that firms may switch from a [[profit maximization]] objective to debt minimization until they are solvent (i.e., equity is positive). This may take a long time; when the bubble burst in 1990, corporate demand for funds immediately collapsed, and by 1995, the demand was negative, meaning that Japanese companies were making net pay downs of their debt. The demand remained negative for 10 years, until 2005. This happened despite near zero interest rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfainstitute.org/learning/products/publications/cp/Pages/cp.v27.n4.4.aspx Richard Koo-CFA Institute Proceedings-Lessons from Japan:Fighting a Balance Sheet Recession-2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States 2007–2009===
[[File:U.S. Private Sector Financial Surplus.png|300px|thumb|right|U.S. savings and investment; savings greater than investment indicates a large private sector financial surplus, indicative of a balance sheet recession]]

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in 2014 that "the best working hypothesis seems to be that the [[subprime mortgage crisis|financial crisis]] was only one manifestation of a broader problem of excessive debt--that it was a so-called "balance sheet recession."&lt;ref name="nybooks.com"&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/jul/10/geithner-does-he-pass-test/ NYT-Paul Krugman-Does He Pass The Test?-July 10,2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. household debt rose from approximately 65% GDP in Q1 2000 to 95% by Q1 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?graph_id=136424&amp;category_id= FRED Database-Household Debt-Retrieved July 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; This was driven by a housing bubble, which encouraged Americans to take on larger mortgages and use home equity lines of credit to fuel consumption. Mortgage debt rose from $4.9&amp;nbsp;trillion in Q1 2000 to a peak of $10.7&amp;nbsp;trillion by Q2 2008. However, it has fallen since as households deleverage, to $9.3&amp;nbsp;trillion by Q1 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?graph_id=151335&amp;category_id= FRED Database-Home Mortgage Liability Levels-Retrieved July 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

While U.S. savings rose significantly during the 2007–2009 recession, both residential and non-residential investment fell significantly, approximately $560&amp;nbsp;billion between Q1 2008 and Q4 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?graph_id=113924&amp;category_id= FRED Database-Residential and Non-Residential Investment-Retrieved July 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; This moved the [[sectoral balances|private sector financial balance]] (gross private savings minus gross private domestic investment) from an approximately $200&amp;nbsp;billion deficit in Q4 2007 to a surplus of $1.4&amp;nbsp;trillion by Q3 2009. This surplus remained elevated at $720&amp;nbsp;billion in Q1 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?graph_id=142070&amp;category_id= FRED Database-Private Sector Financial Surplus-Retrieved July 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; This illustrates the core issue in a balance sheet recession, that an enormous amount of savings was tied up in the banking system, rather than being invested.

The decline in housing prices also caused U.S. household equity to plummet, from a peak of $13.4&amp;nbsp;trillion in Q1 2006 to $6.1&amp;nbsp;trillion by Q1 2009, a 54% decline. Household equity began to rise after Q4 2011 and was back to $10.8&amp;nbsp;trillion by Q1 2014, approximately 80% of its pre-crisis peak level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/OEHRENWBSHNO FRED Database-Household Owner's Equity-Retrieved July 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Such a decline in equity shifts household behavior towards [[deleveraging]], as indicated by the reduction in mortgage balances since Q2 2008 described above.

A July 2012 survey of balance sheet recession research reported that consumer demand and employment are affected by [[Household debt|household leverage]] levels. Both durable and non-durable goods consumption declined as households moved from low to high leverage with the decline in property values experienced during the [[subprime mortgage crisis]]. In other words, according to the [[accounting equation]], as the value of their primary asset (homes) fell, mortgage debt initially remained fixed, so equity also fell, causing the ratio of debt to equity (a measure of leverage) to rise. This sudden increase in leverage, causing consumers to shift from spending to paying down debt, can account for a significant decline in employment levels, as employers cut back due to concerns of lower consumer demand. Policies that help reduce mortgage debt or household leverage could therefore have stimulative effects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/06/grim-natural-experiments/ NYT – Paul Krugman – Grim Natural Experiments – July 6, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nextnewdeal.net/rortybomb/new-report-literature-summary-new-balance-sheet-recession-research How Mortgage Debt is Holding Back the Economy – Mike Konczal – Roosevelt Institute – July 3, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016030017/http://www.nextnewdeal.net/rortybomb/new-report-literature-summary-new-balance-sheet-recession-research |date=October 16, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Martin Wolf]] wrote in 2012 that the financial crisis in the U.S. was a balance sheet recession:
"The overall story, then, is of an economy driven not by fiscal policy decisions, but by private sector decisions taken for reasons that have nothing to do with the long-run fiscal prospects of the economy. Meanwhile, the government, as a whole, was driven into huge deficit by these private sector decisions. That is exactly what one expects to happen in a huge balance-sheet recession, such as this one."&lt;ref name="blogs.ft.com"&gt;[http://blogs.ft.com/martin-wolf-exchange/2012/07/19/the-balance-sheet-recession-in-the-us/ Financial Times-Martin Wolf-The Balance Sheet Recession in the U.S.- July 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists Atif Mian and Amir Sufi wrote in 2014 that:
*Historically, severe economic downturns are almost always preceded by a sharp increase in household debt.
*U.S. household spending declines were largest in geographic areas with a combination of higher household debt and larger housing price declines.
*When housing prices fall, poorer homeowners (with a larger proportion of their net worth in their home) are hit the hardest financially and reduce their consumption relatively more than wealthier households.
*Declines in residential investment preceded the recession and were followed by reductions in household spending and then non-residential business investment as the recession worsened.&lt;ref name="Mian and Sufi2014"&gt;{{cite book

==Policy response==
Responses to recessions typically include fiscal stimulus through higher government deficits and monetary stimulus, such as lower interest rates and monetary creation. However, the solvency (net worth) of economic actors is a third important element when dealing with a balance sheet recession, as either asset price declines must be reversed or debt levels reduced, or combination of both.

In Krugman's view, balance sheet recessions require private sector debt reduction strategies (e.g., mortgage refinancing) combined with higher government spending to offset declines from the private sector as it pays down its debt, writing in July 2014: "Unlike a financial panic, a balance sheet recession can’t be cured simply by restoring confidence: no matter how confident they may be feeling, debtors can’t spend more if their creditors insist they cut back. So offsetting the economic downdraft from a debt overhang requires concrete action, which can in general take two forms: fiscal stimulus and debt relief. That is, the government can step in to spend because the private sector can’t, and it can also reduce private debts to allow the debtors to spend again. Unfortunately, we did too little of the first and almost none of the second."&lt;ref name="nybooks.com"/&gt;

Krugman discussed the balance sheet recession concept during 2010, agreeing with Koo's situation assessment and view that sustained [[deficit spending]] when faced with a balance sheet recession would be appropriate. However, Krugman argued that monetary policy could also affect savings behavior, as inflation or credible promises of future inflation (generating negative real interest rates) would encourage less savings. In other words, people would tend to spend more rather than save if they believe inflation is on the horizon. In more technical terms, Krugman argues that the private sector savings curve is elastic even during a balance sheet recession (responsive to changes in real interest rates) disagreeing with Koo's view that it is inelastic (non-responsive to changes in real interest rates).&lt;ref&gt;[https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/17/notes-on-koo-wonkish/ NYT – Paul Krugman – Notes on Koo – August 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voxeu.org/article/debt-deleveraging-and-liquidity-trap-new-model VOX – Paul Krugman – Debt, Deleveraging and the Liquidity Trap – November 18, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Berber Spring''' (in [[Berber language|Berber]]: '''Tafsut Imaziɣen''' or simply '''Tafsut''' for "Spring") was a period of political protest and civil activism in 1980 claiming recognition of the [[Berber people|Berber]] identity and language in [[Algeria]] with events mainly taking place in [[Kabylie]] and [[Algiers]].

== Background ==

=== Arabization measures. ===
Since its independence in 1962, Algeria has a single-party system, governed by the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]]. After 132 years of French colonization, one of the goals of the Arab nationalist party FLN is to institute [[Arabization]] measures that will implement Arab as the national language in administration, schools and public services in general. Like most ex-colonies, the independence of [[Algerian War|Algeria]] stressed the need for "recovery" of the language, as a symbol of the "recovery" of a nation. Under French colonization, Arab language was disregarded. In 1938, the French government even implemented a law that declared Arab a foreign language in Algeria. The nationalist party of the independence, the FLN, has therefore a sort of "arabic" conception of Algeria, an Arab and Muslim Algeria, that does not recognize the pluralism of cultures, identities and languages in Algeria. For example, the 1976 National Charter did not take into account any Berber claims for recognition.

This denial of the Berber identity, language and culture is to be put in a context where approximately 10 to 12 million Algerians are Berbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alilat|first1=Djamel|title=Touareg, Kabyles, Rifains... Qui sont les Berbères?|url=https://www.geo.fr/photos/reportages-geo/touareg-kabyles-rifains-qui-sont-les-berberes-183310|website=Geo.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kabylie|Kabylia]] is the region that concentrates the most Berbers, It is located in the North of Algeria. It has approximately 7 million inhabitants.

=== &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goodman|first1=Jane|title=Reinterpreting the berber spring: from rite of reversal to site of convergence|journal=The Journal of North African Studies|date=2004|pages=60–82|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1362938042000325813?needAccess=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berber cultural organizations. ===
During the 1960s and the 1970s, several Berber cultural organizations emerged in Paris, for they could not be set in Algeria. At that time, there were lots of exchanges between Algeria and France and despite being based in Paris, those organizations also targeted Kabylia's inhabitants. The Berber, and more specifically the Kabyle, identity was already a political cause. For example, [[Mouloud Mammeri]] had created the ''Académie Berbère d’Echanges et de Recherches Culturelles'' (ABERC) with other intellectuals, that emphasized the similarities between the minorities in Algeria.

== The events ==

The Berber Spring is traditionally dated as beginning on March 10, 1980, with the banning of a conference due to be held by the Kabyle intellectual [[Mouloud Mammeri]] at Hasnaoua University in [[Tizi-Ouzou]]. This event sparked demonstrations and strikes at schools, universities and businesses that would rock the Kabyle region for more than two months: this period is known as the “Berber spring” or Tafsut Imaziɣen. This event is the first great popular movement to question the authorities, the FLN and the single-party system since Algeria's independence. A critical point was the coordinated arrest of hundreds of Berber activists, students and doctors on April 20, sparking a [[general strike]].

March, 10: Mouloud Mammeri's conference about ancient Kabyle poetry is cancelled in Hasnaoua University in Tizi-Ouzou.

March 11: demonstrations in Kabylia and in Algiers.

April, 7: violent suppression of a demonstration in Algiers shocked public opinion + beginning of the strike in the Tizi-Ouzou university.

April, 10: general strike in Kabylia.

April, 17: forced eviction of the strikers from the Tizi-Ouzou hospital and the SONELEC factory.

April, 19 and 20: Mizrana operation: authorities enter the Tizi-Ouzou university.

April, 20: general spontaneous strike in Tizi-Ouzou.

According to Jane Goodman, the Berber Spring could not have happened if not for the conjunction of 4 dynamics: the Arabisation program that “criminalized” berber identity; a small network of berber scholars in Paris in the 1970s; the student governance in Algerian universities that allowed demonstration organization; and the “human rights discourse” in the media, fuelled by the violent repression.

While the Berber Spring was in the end violently suppressed by the Algerian authorities, it created a lasting legacy for Kabylie and the Berbers across North Africa. Many of today's prominent Kabyle politicians and activists made their name during the Berber Spring events, and organizations such as the [[Rally for Culture and Democracy]] (RCD) and the Berber Cultural Movement (Mouvement Culturel Berbère &amp;ndash; MCB) were later created by activists of the Spring. The Spring was also an important event for Algeria's nascent human rights community, including outside Berber circles.

==Aftermath==

Since the dismantling of the one-party FLN system in 1989—followed by abortive [[democratization]] and [[Algerian Civil War|civil war]]—a few of the demands of the Berber Spring have been met by the state, and the Berber language is now a [[national language]] of Algeria. However, this is still distinct from [[Arabic]], which remains the [[official language]], and many other points of contention remain.

Since January 2011 massive Berber activism re-emerged{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} in North Africa in the wake of the [[Tunisian revolution]] and the overthrow of the Tunisian president [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali|Ben Ali]], in what Berbers sometimes call the [[Arab Spring|Berber-Arab Spring]]. This time, Berber activists were much more active and vocal on the streets of [[Morocco]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/02/19/138343.html|title=Morocco braces for protests as unrest moves west |publisher=Al Arabiya |date=19 February 2011 |accessdate=August 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOZzQD8oRLM|title=Tanger manifestation 5 juin 20 fevrier|publisher=Youtube}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Libya]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/28/libya-amazigh-identity-tribes-gaddafi| title=Libya's Berbers join the revolution in fight to reclaim ancient identity |publisher=The Guardian |date=28 February 2011 |accessdate=August 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to Algeria. In Libya, Berber rebels helped topple Gaddafi, as the offensive that captured Tripoli and greatly helped end the civil war there originated from the Berber [[Nafusa Mountains]].

'''Clara Hamilton Harris''' (September 4, 1834&lt;ref name="thomas"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ham|first=Mrs. Thomas H. |title=A Genealogy Of the Descendants Of Nicholas Harris, M.D.,|year=1904|publisher=C.I.F.

Harris and her fiancé, [[Henry Rathbone|Major Henry Rathbone]], were the guests of [[Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln]] and [[Mary Todd Lincoln|First Lady Mary Lincoln]] when [[John Wilkes Booth]] fatally [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|shot the President]] at [[Ford's Theatre]] in April 1865.

==Family==
Harris was born in [[Albany, New York]],&lt;ref name="thomas1"&gt;Thomas 1904 p.27&lt;/ref&gt; one of four children of [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Ira Harris]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], and his first wife Louisa Harris (née Tubbs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seward|first=Frances Adeline |editor=Johnson, Patricia Carley |title=Sensitivity and Civil War, the Selected Diaries and Papers, 1858–1866, of Frances Adeline (Fanny) Seward|volume=2|year=1963|publisher=University of Rochester|page=719}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris' mother Louisa died in 1845. On August 1, 1848, Ira Harris married Pauline Rathbone (née Penney),&lt;ref name="thomas" /&gt; the widow of Jared L. Rathbone, a successful merchant who later became the mayor of Albany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Essex Institute Historical Collections|year=1891|publisher=Essex Institute Press|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Updike|first=John|title=More Matter: Essays and Criticism|year=2009|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=0-307-48839-X|page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jared and Pauline Rathbone had four children (two of whom, Anna and Charles, died in infancy) including sons, Jared, Jr. and [[Henry Rathbone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Talcott|first=Sebastian V.|title=Genealogical Notes of New York and New England Families|year=2001|publisher=Heritage Books|isbn=0-788-41956-0|page=634}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Harris and Henry Rathbone were raised in the same household and were related by their parents' marriage, they fell in love and later became engaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-08-21/entertainment/9408210103_1_henry-and-clara-henry-rathbone-thomas-mallon|title=Henry And Clara's Cruel Fate|last=Pappas|first=Theodore|date=August 21, 1994|publisher=chicagotribune.com|page=1|accessdate=May 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their engagement was interrupted when the [[American Civil War]] broke out in 1861. Henry Rathbone joined the [[Union Army]] that year and eventually rose to the rank of [[Major]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Steers, Edward |title=The Trial: The Assassination of President Lincoln and the Trial of the Conspirators|year=2010|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0-813-12724-6|page=XLII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lincoln assassination==

On April 14, 1865, Major Rathbone and his fiancee Clara accepted an invitation to see a play at [[Ford's Theatre]] from President [[Abraham Lincoln]] and his wife, First Lady [[Mary Todd Lincoln]]. The couple, who had been friends with the President and his wife for some time, were invited after [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and his wife [[Julia Grant|Julia]], [[Thomas Eckert]] and several other people had declined Mrs. Lincoln's invitation to the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steers|first=Edward |title=Blood on the Moon: The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|year=2005|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0-813-19151-3|pages=104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While watching the play ''[[Our American Cousin]]'' in the Presidential Box at Ford's Theatre that evening, [[John Wilkes Booth]] fatally shot President Lincoln in the back of the head. When Rathbone attempted to apprehend Booth after the shooting, Booth slashed Rathbone with a [[Bowie knife]] from left elbow to shoulder.&lt;ref name=lachman&gt;{{cite book|last=Lachman|first=Charles |title=The Last Lincolns: The Rise &amp; Fall of a Great American Family|year=2008|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company|isbn=1-402-75890-1|page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hatch"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hatch|first=Frederick |title=Protecting President Lincoln: The Security Effort, the Thwarted Plots, and the Disaster at Ford's Theatre|year=2011|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-786-46362-7|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rathbone lost a considerable amount of blood which stained Harris' white dress, face and hands when she attempted to aid him.&lt;ref name=Smith1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Gene|date=February–March 1994|title=The Haunted Major|journal=American Heritage|volume=45|issue=1|page=1|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/haunted-major}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being seriously wounded, Rathbone escorted First Lady Mary Lincoln to the Petersen House where doctors had decided to take the mortally wounded President. Shortly after arriving at the Petersen House, Rathbone passed out due to loss of blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bain|first=Robert T.|title=Lincoln's Last Battleground: A Tragic Night Recalled|year=2005|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=1-467-02991-2|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris arrived at the house soon after and held Rathbone's head in her lap while he drifted in and out of consciousness. A surgeon who had been attending the President finally examined Rathbone and realized his wound was more serious than initially thought. Booth had severed an artery located just above Rathbone's elbow and had cut him nearly to the bone. Rathbone was taken home while Harris decided to stay with Mrs. Lincoln.&lt;ref name=kauffman&gt;Kauffman (2007) p.37&lt;/ref&gt; Harris later stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Poor Mrs. Lincoln, all through that dreadful night would look at me with horror &amp; scream, 'oh! my husband's blood, my dear husband's blood'...It was Henry's blood, not the president's, but explanations were pointless.&lt;ref name=kauffman/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While Rathbone eventually recovered from the attack, President Lincoln died of his wound the following morning. After the assassination, Rathbone blamed himself for not preventing Lincoln's death. He spent the remainder of his life battling delusions and seeking treatments for other physical problems including constant headaches.&lt;ref name=lachman /&gt;&lt;ref name="hatch" /&gt;

==Later years and death==
Harris and Rathbone were married on July 11, 1867. The couple had three children: [[Henry Riggs Rathbone|Henry Riggs]] (born February 12, 1870), who later became a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congressman]] from [[Illinois]], Gerald Lawrence (born August 26, 1871) and Clara Pauline (born September 15, 1872).&lt;ref name="thomas1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Talcott 2001 p.637&lt;/ref&gt;  Rathbone, who had risen to the rank of [[colonel]], resigned from the Army in December 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jampoler|first=Andrew C. A.|title=The Last Lincoln Conspirator: John Surratt's Flight from the Gallows|year=2008|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=1-591-14407-8|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family settled in Washington D.C. where Rathbone's mental health deteriorated.&lt;ref name="hatch" /&gt;  Rathbone's behavior became increasingly erratic and he began drinking heavily, gambling and having affairs. Due to his behavior, Rathbone found it difficult to hold a job for an extended period of time.&lt;ref name=papas2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-08-21/entertainment/9408210103_1_henry-and-clara-henry-rathbone-thomas-mallon/2|title=Henry And Clara's Cruel Fate|last=Pappas|first=Theodore|date=August 21, 1994|publisher=chicagotribune.com|page=2|accessdate=May 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year on the anniversary of Lincoln's assassination, journalists would contact the couple with questions about Lincoln's death furthering Rathbone's feelings of guilt. Harris later wrote to a friend:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I understand his distress...in every hotel we're in, as soon as people get wind of our presence, we feel ourselves become objects of morbid scrutiny.... Whenever we were in the dining room, we began to feel like zoo animals. Henry...imagines that the whispering is more pointed and malicious than it can possibly be.&lt;ref name=papas2/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As time went on, Rathbone's mental instability worsened and he often became jealous of other men who paid attention to Harris and resented the attention Harris paid their children. He also reportedly threatened his wife on several occasions, convinced that Harris was going to divorce him and take the children.&lt;ref name="hatch" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith1 /&gt; Despite his behavior, Rathbone was appointed [[Consul (representative)|U.S. Consul]] to the [[Province of Hanover]] by President [[Chester Alan Arthur]] in 1882. The family relocated to Germany where Rathbone's mental health continued to decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steers|first=Edward |title=The Lincoln Assassination Encyclopedia|year=2010|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0-061-98705-0|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 23, 1883, Henry Rathbone attacked his family in a fit of madness. He fatally shot his wife in the head and then attempted to kill the children, but a groundskeeper prevented him from doing so. Rathbone then stabbed himself five times in the chest in an attempted suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swanson|first=James L. |title=Manhunt: The 12-Day Chase to Catch Lincoln's Killer|year=2009|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0-061-80397-9|page=372}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blaming his crime on an intruder, Rathbone was charged with murder and declared insane by doctors. He was convicted and committed to an asylum for the criminally insane in [[Hildesheim]], [[Germany]], where he died on August 14, 1911. The couple's children were sent to live with their uncle, William Harris, in the United States.&lt;ref name="hatch" /&gt;

Harris was buried in the city cemetery at [[Hanover]]/Engesohde. Her husband was buried next to her upon his death in 1911. In 1952, the 
Rathbones' remains were disinterred and disposed of after cemetery management determined that their graves had not been visited or were no longer of interest to the family.&lt;ref name=smith2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Gene|date=February–March 1994|title=The Haunted Major|journal=American Heritage|volume=45|issue=1|page=2|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/haunted-major?page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* Clara Harris kept the bloodied white dress she wore on the night of assassination. Unable to bring herself to wash or destroy it, she eventually stored it in a closet in the family's summer home near Albany. After experiencing what she claimed was a visit from [[Lincoln's ghost]], Harris had the closet in which the dress was stored covered with bricks. In 1910, Henry Riggs Rathbone, Harris and Rathbone's eldest son, removed the bricks and had the dress destroyed reportedly claiming that it had cursed the family.&lt;ref name=Smith1 /&gt; The dress was later the subject of the 1929 book ''The White Satin Dress'', by [[Mary Raymond Shipman Andrews]].&lt;ref name=smith2 /&gt;
* In 1994, [[Thomas Mallon]] released the novel ''Henry and Clara'', a fictional account of the lives of Harris and her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,303433,00.html|title=Thomas Mallon|last=De Haven|first=Tom|date=August 19, 1994|publisher=ew.com|accessdate=May 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Harris was portrayed by uncredited actresses in two films pertaining to the Lincoln assassination, ''[[The Conspirator]]'' and ''[[National Treasure: Book of Secrets]]''.

'''Color Factory''' is a [[Pop-up exhibition|pop-up]] [[Interactive art|interactive]] [[art exhibition]] with brightly colored room-sized [[Installation art|installations]], each themed around the concept of [[color]]. It ran for eight and a half months in 2017 in [[San Francisco]], and, as of October 2018, is currently running in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennawang/2018/09/29/the-rise-of-the-pop-up-economy|title=The Rise Of The Pop-Up Economy|last=Wang|first=Jenna|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/2018/06/the-color-factory-new-york-city.html|title=The Ultimate Instagram Exhibit Is Headed to New York City|last=Bedolla|first=Daise|work=The Cut|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/the-color-factory-experiential-art-exhibit-in-nyc-features-16-stunning-rooms-devoted-to-the-joy-of-color-10202362|title=The Instagram-Famous Color Factory Has 16 New Rooms With Built-In Cameras For Photo Opps|last=Lord|first=Emma|work=Bustle|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Color Factory has commonly been cited as part of a trend of “Instagram museums”, temporary art exhibitions catered towards younger [[Millennials|millennial]] audiences which are designed to be [[Photograph|photographed]] (especially in [[Selfie|selfies]]) and shared on [[Instagram]] and other [[social media]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gothamist.com/2018/07/19/color_factory_coming_to_instagram.php|title=Introducing Color Factory, The Latest Instagrammable Pop-Up Coming To NYC|work=Gothamist|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719172436/http://gothamist.com/2018/07/19/color_factory_coming_to_instagram.php|archive-date=2018-07-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-color-factory-is-made-for-instagram-but-is-it-art|title=The Color Factory Is Made for Instagram, but Is It Art?|last=Winkelman|first=Natalia|date=2018-08-21|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/arts/color-factory-museum-of-ice-cream-rose-mansion-29rooms-candytopia.html|title=The Existential Void of the Pop-Up ‘Experience’|last=Hess|first=Amanda|date=2018-09-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/03/tech/instagram-pop-up-experiences-rose-mansion/index.html|title=Instagramable pop-ups can teach retailers a thing or two|last=Business|first=Story by Kaya Yurieff, CNN Business Video by Lisa Fischer, CNN|work=CNN|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Vox|title=How "Instagram traps" are changing art museums|date=2018-09-19|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx_r-dP22Ps|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-founder Jordan Ferney has publicly pushed back against descriptions of Color Factory as an Instagram museum, stating that her goal “had always been to make something that was beautiful to experience, not photograph”.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== History ==
Color Factory was founded in August 2017 by event-planner/blogger Jordan Ferney, artist Leah Rosenberg, and designer Erin Jang.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It originally debuted as a one-month, 15-installation, 12,000 ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; exhibition in San Francisco, sponsored by [[Alaskan Airlines]] and Method Soap.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to its popularity (at one point causing its [[Eventbrite]] ticketing page to crash from high demand)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sf.curbed.com/2017/7/31/16069956/color-factory-sf-tickets|title=Peek inside San Francisco’s newest Instagramable hotspot|work=Curbed SF|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;, this San Francisco run was later extended to last for a total of eight and a half months.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In June and July 2018, Color Factory partnered with the [[Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum]] in New York City to exhibit the “[[Manhattan]] Color Walk”, an outdoor art installation which painted the ground with several stripes of colors, each sampled from a different street of Manhattan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Art-Piece-Expresses-Colors-From-All-Across-Manhattan.html|title=Walk Displays Colors from 265 Blocks of NYC|work=NBC New York|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, Color Factory reopened as a temporary 16-installation, 20,000 ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; standalone exhibition in New York City's [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]] neighborhood, sponsored by [[Maybelline]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The '''Cumero Fire''' was a [[wildfire]] burning southeast of [[Sasabe, Arizona]], on the US-Mexico border in the [[Coronado National Forest]] in [[Arizona]] in the United States. The fire was reported on July 5 and burned {{Convert|3925|acre|km2|0}}. As of July 8, the fire was 80 percent contained. The cause of the fire is under investigation.

==Events==

Smoke from the Cumero Fire was first spotted on July 5 southeast of [[Sasabe, Arizona]], along the US-Mexico border. The fire was burning in grass south of Cumero Mountain, with the majority of the fire on US land. Fire crews immediately focused on fire suppression. The fire threatened Garcia Ranch and cell phone communication towers. That evening, temporary flight restrictions were put in place. Coronado National Forest was put under evacuation warnings.&lt;ref name="IW75"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cumero Fire Update July 5 - InciWeb the Incident Information System |url=https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/article/5894/43697/ |website=InciWeb |publisher=US Forest Service |accessdate=12 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On July 6, the fire had reached {{Convert|3825|acre|km2|0}} and was 40 percent contained. Of that acreage,{{Convert|3625|acre|km2|0}} was on US land. The majority of fire activity remained on the mountain, with fire suppression and containment being the focus.&lt;ref name="IW76"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cumero Fire Update July 6  - InciWeb the Incident Information System |url=https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/article/5894/43728/ |website=InciWeb |publisher=US Forest Service |accessdate=12 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, July 7, the fire had expanded into [[Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge]].&lt;ref name="IW77"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cumero Fire Updated July 7 - InciWeb the Incident Information System |url=https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/article/5894/43768/ |website=InciWeb |publisher=US Forest Service |accessdate=12 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of July 8, the Cumero Fire had burned {{Convert|3925|acre|km2|0}} and was 80 percent contained.&lt;ref name="InciWeb"/&gt; 

==Impacts==

The Cumero Fire burned on the international border of the United States and [[Mexico]], impacting ranch lands, recreational areas, transportation, and cell tower equipment in the area. A temporary flight restriction was put in place for the fire impacted area on July 5.&lt;ref name="IW75"/&gt;

'''Cyber crime''', or '''computer crime''', refers to any crime that involves a [[computer]] and a [[computer network|network]].&lt;ref name="moore"&gt;Moore, R. (2005) "Cybercrime: Investigating High-Technology Computer Crime," Cleveland, Mississippi: Anderson Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; The computer may have been used in the commission of a crime, or it may be the target. '''Netcrime''' refers, more precisely, to criminal exploitation of the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;Mann and Sutton 1998: &gt;&gt;Netcrime: More change in the Organization of Thieving. British Journal of Criminology; 38: 201-229. [http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/38/2/201 Oxfordjournals.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Issues surrounding this type of crime have become high-profile, particularly those surrounding [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]], [[copyright infringement]], [[identity theft]], [[child pornography]], and [[child grooming]]. There are also problems of [[privacy]] when [[confidential]] information is lost or intercepted, lawfully or otherwise.

On the global level, both governments and non-state actors continue to grow in importance, with the ability to engage in such activities as [[espionage]], and other cross-border attacks sometimes referred to as [[cyber warfare]]. The international legal system is attempting to hold actors accountable for their actions, with the [[International Criminal Court]] among the few addressing this threat.&lt;ref&gt;Ophardt, Jonathan A. [http://www.law.duke.edu/journals/dltr/articles/2010dltr003.html "Cyber warfare and the crime of aggression: the need for individual accountability on tomorrow's battlefield"] ''Duke Law and Technology Review'', February 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A cyber [[countermeasure]] is defined as an action, process, technology, device, or system that serves to prevent or mitigate the effects of a cyber attack against a victim, computer, server, network or associated device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coleman|first=Kevin|title=Cyber Attacks on Supply Chain Systems|url=http://defensetech.org/2009/04/15/cyber-attacks-on-supply-chain-systems/|publisher=defensetech.org|accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently there has been an increase in the number of international cyber attacks. In 2013 there was a 91% increase in targeted attack campaigns and a 62% increase in security breaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why the US Needs More Cyber Professionals|url=http://infoassurance.norwich.edu/609-2/|website=Norwich University|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[countermeasures]] exist that can be effectively implemented in order to combat cyber-crime and increase security.

==Types of threats==
===Malicious code===

[[Malicious code]] is a broad category that encompasses a number of threats to cyber-security. In essence it is any “hardware, software, or firmware that is intentionally included or inserted in a system for a harmful purpose.”&lt;ref name="Newman, R. 2006 p. 69"&gt;Newman, R. (2006) Cybercrime, Identity Theft, and Fraud: Practicing Safe Internet – Network Security Threats and Vulnerabilities. Proceedings of the 3rd Annual Conference on Information Security Curriculum Development. Kennesaw, GA: ACM. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly referred to as [[malware]] it includes [[computer viruses]], [[Computer worm|worms]], [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horses]], [[keyloggers]], [[Botnet|BOTs]], [[Rootkits]], and any [[Vulnerability (computing)|software security exploits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skandier|first=Quentin Docter, Emmett Dulaney, Toby|title=CompTIA A+ complete study guide|year=2009|publisher=Wiley Pub.|location=Indianapolis, Ind.|isbn=978-0-470-48649-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malicious code also includes [[spyware]], which are deceptive programs, installed without authorization, “that monitor a consumer’s activities without their consent.”&lt;ref name="Loibl, T. 2005 p. 119"&gt;Loibl, T. (2005) Identity Theft, Spyware, and the Law. Proceedings of the 2nd Annual Conference on Information Security Curriculum Development. Kennesaw, GA: ACM. p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Spyware can be used to send users unwanted [[popup ads]], to usurp the control of a user’s Internet browser, or to monitor a user’s online habits. However, spyware is usually installed along with something that the user actually wishes to install. The user consents to the installation, but does not consent to the monitoring tactics of the spyware. The consent for spyware is normally found in the [[end-user license agreement]].&lt;ref name="Loibl, T. 2005 p. 119"/&gt;

===Network attacks===

A network attack is considered to be any action taken to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information residing on a computer and computer networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joint Publication 3-13 Information Operations (Feb. 13 2006)|url=https://fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/jp3_13.pdf|accessdate=29 April 2011|author=Joint Chiefs of Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; An attack can take four forms: fabrication, interception, interruption, and modification. A fabrication is the “creation of some deception in order to deceive some unsuspecting user”; an interception is the “process of intruding into some transmission and redirecting it for some unauthorized use”; an interruption is the “break in a communication channel, which inhibits the transmission of data”; and a modification is “the alteration of the data contained in the transmissions.”&lt;ref name="Newman, R. 2006 p. 69"/&gt; Attacks can be classified as either being active or passive. Active attacks involve modification of the transmission or attempts to gain unauthorized access to a system, while passive attacks involve monitoring transmissions. Either form can be used to obtain information about a user, which can later be used to steal that user’s identity. Common forms of network attacks include [[Denial of Service|Denial of Service (Dos)]] and [[Distributed Denial of Service|Distributed Denial of Service(DDoS)]], [[Man-in-the-middle attack]], [[packet sniffing]], [[SYN flood|TCP SYN Flood]], [[Denial of Service|ICMP Flood]], [[IP spoofing]], and even simple web defacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Odom|first=Wendell|title=CCENT/CCNA ICND1|year=2008|publisher=Cisco Press|location=Indianapolis, Ind.|isbn=978-1-58720-182-0|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Network abuse===

Network abuses are activities which violate a network's [[acceptable use policy]] and are generally considered fraudulent activity that is committed with the aid of a computer. [[E-mail spam|SPAM]] is one of the most common forms of network abuse, where an individual will email list of users usually with unsolicited advertisements or [[phishing]] attacks attempting to use social engineering to acquire sensitive information such any information useful in [[identity theft]], usernames, passwords, and so on by posing as a trustworthy individual. [[Pharming]] is also another form of network abuse where a website’s traffic is redirected to a bogus website, usually by exploiting vulnerabilities in [[Domain Name System|Domain Name System(DNS)]] servers.

===Social engineering===

[[Social engineering (security)|Social engineering]] is the act of [[Psychological manipulation|manipulating]] people into performing actions or divulging confidential information, rather than by breaking in or using technical cracking techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csoonline.com/article/514063/Social_Engineering_The_Basics|title=Social Engineering: The Basics|last=Goodchild|first=Joan |date=January 11, 2010  |publisher=csoonline|accessdate=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method of deception is commonly used by individuals attempting to break into computer systems, by posing as an authoritative or trusted party and capturing access information from the naive target.&lt;ref name=AAA&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spywareloop.com/news/cybercrime-and-countermeasures|title=Cybercrime and Countermeasures in SpyWareLoop.com|author=Vincentas|newspaper=''Spyware Loop''|date=11 July 2013|accessdate=28 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922033306/http://www.spywareloop.com/news/cybercrime-and-countermeasures|archivedate=22 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Email Phishing is a common example of social engineering's application, but it is not limited to this single type of attack.

===Technical===

There are a variety of different technical countermeasures that can be deployed to thwart cybercriminals and harden systems against attack. [[Firewall (computing)|Firewalls]], network or host based, are considered the first line of defense in securing a computer network by setting [[Access Control Lists|Access Control Lists (ACLs)]] determining which what services and traffic can pass through the check point.&lt;ref&gt;Firewall http://www.tech-faq.com/firewall.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antivirus]] can be used to prevent propagation of malicious code. Most computer viruses have similar characteristics which allow for signature based detection. Heuristics such as file analysis and file emulation are also used to identify and remove malicious programs. Virus definitions should be regularly updated in addition to applying operating system [[hotfixes]], [[service packs]], and [[patch (computing)|patches]] to keep computers on a network secure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glenn|first=Walter|title=MCDST self-paced training kit (exam 70-271) : supporting users and troubleshooting a Microsoft Windows XP operating system|year=2006|publisher=Microsoft Press|location=Redmond, Wash.|isbn=978-0-7356-2227-2|edition=2nd|author2=[[Tony Northrup]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cryptography]] techniques can be employed to encrypt information using an algorithm commonly called a cipher to mask information in storage or transit. Tunneling for example will take a payload protocol such as [[Internet Protocol|Internet Protocol (IP)]] and encapsulate it in an encrypted delivery protocol over a [[Virtual Private Network|Virtual Private Network (VPN)]], [[Secure Sockets Layer|Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)]], [[Transport Layer Security|Transport Layer Security (TLS)]],  [[Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol|Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)]], [[Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol|Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)]], or [[Internet Protocol Security|Internet Protocol Security (IPSec)]]to ensure data security during transmission. Encryption can also be employed on the file level using encryption protocols like [[Data Encryption Standard]] (DES), [[Triple DES]], or [[Advanced Encryption Standard|Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)]] to ensure security of information in storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lammle|first=Todd|title=CompTIA Network+|year=2009|publisher=Wiley Publishing, Inc.|isbn=978-0-470-42747-7|pages=427–434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, [[Penetration test|network vulnerability testing]] performed by technicians or automated programs can be used to test on a full-scale or targeted specifically to devices, systems, and passwords used on a network to assess their degree of secureness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Introduction to Network Vulnerability Testing|url=http://www.hitrust.com.hk/whitepaper/1/whitepaper_Understanding_Network_Vulnerability.pdf|publisher=Verisign|accessdate=29 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004235015/http://www.hitrust.com.hk/whitepaper/1/whitepaper_Understanding_Network_Vulnerability.pdf|archivedate=4 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, [[network monitoring]] tools can be used to detect intrusions or suspicious traffic on both large and small networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cottrell|first=Les|title=Network Monitoring Tools|url=http://www.slac.stanford.edu/xorg/nmtf/nmtf-tools.html|work=SLAC|accessdate=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical deterrents such as locks, card access keys, or [[biometric]] devices can be used to prevent criminals from gaining physical access to a machine on a network. Strong password protection both for access to a computer system and the computer's BIOS are also effective countermeasures to against cyber-criminals with physical access to a machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doctor|first=Quentin|title=CompTIA A+|year=2009|publisher=Wiley Publishing Inc,|location=Indianapolis, Indiana|isbn=978-0-470-48649-8|pages=560–563|author2=Emmet Dulaney |author3=Toby Skandier }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another deterrent is to use a bootable [[bastion host]] that executes a web browser in a known clean and secure operating environment.  The host is devoid of any known malware, where data is never stored on the device, and the media cannot be overwritten.  The kernel and programs are guaranteed to be clean at each boot.  Some solutions have been used to create secure hardware browsers to protect users while accessing online banking.

====Counter-Terror Social Network Analysis and Intent Recognition====

The Counter-Terror Social Network Analysis and Intent Recognition (CT-SNAIR) project uses the Terrorist Action Description Language (TADL) to model and simulate [[terrorist]] networks and attacks. It also models links identified in communication patterns compiled from [[multimedia]] data, and terrorists’ activity patterns are compiled from databases of past [[terrorist threat]]s.&lt;ref name="Weinstein, C. 2009 p. 2"&gt;Weinstein, C., et al. (2009) Modeling and Detection Techniques for Counter-Terror Social Network Analysis and Intent Recognition. Proceedings from the Aerospace Conference. Piscataway, NJ: IEEE. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other proposed methods, CT-SNAIR constantly interacts with the user, who uses the system both to investigate and to refine hypotheses.&lt;ref name="Weinstein, C. 2009 p. 2"/&gt;

Multimedia data, such as voice, text, and network session data, is compiled and processed. Through this compilation and processing, names, entities, relationships, and individual events are extracted from the multimedia data. This information is then used to perform a [[social network analysis]] on the criminal network, through which the user can detect and track threats in the network. The social network analysis directly influences and is influenced by the intent recognition process, in which the user can recognize and detect threats. In the CT-SNAIR process, data and transactions from prior attacks, or forensic scenarios, is compiled to form a sequential list of transactions for a given terrorism scenario.

The CT-SNAIR process also includes generating data from [[hypothetical]] scenarios. Since they are imagined and computer-generated, hypothetical scenarios do not have any transaction data representing terrorism scenarios.&lt;ref name="Weinstein, C. 2009 p. 2"/&gt; Different types of transactions combine to represent the types of relationships between individuals.

The final product, or target social network, is a weighted multiplex graph in which the types of edges (links) are defined by the types of transactions within the social network.&lt;ref name="Weinstein, C. 2009 p. 7"&gt;Weinstein, C., et al. (2009) Modeling and Detection Techniques for Counter-Terror Social Network Analysis and Intent Recognition. Proceedings from the Aerospace Conference. Piscataway, NJ: IEEE. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The weights within these graphs are determined by the content-extraction algorithm, in which each type of link is thought of as a separate graph and “is fed into social network algorithms in part or as a whole.”&lt;ref name="Weinstein, C. 2009 p. 7"/&gt; Links between two individuals can be determined by the existence of (or lack of) the two people being mentioned within the same sentence in the compiled multimedia data or in relation to the same group or event.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, C., et al. (2009) Modeling and Detection Techniques for Counter-Terror Social Network Analysis and Intent Recognition. Proceedings from the Aerospace Conference. Piscataway, NJ: IEEE. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final component in the CT-SNAIR process is Intent Recognition (IR). The goal of this component is to indicate to an analyst the threats that a transaction stream might contain.&lt;ref name="Weinstein, C. 2009 p. 10"&gt;Weinstein, C., et al. (2009) Modeling and Detection Techniques for Counter-Terror Social Network Analysis and Intent Recognition. Proceedings from the Aerospace Conference. Piscataway, NJ: IEEE. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Intent Recognition breaks down into three subcategories: detection of “known or hypothetical target scenarios,” prioritization of these target scenarios, and interpretation “of the resulting detection.”&lt;ref name="Weinstein, C. 2009 p. 10"/&gt;

===Economic===

The optimal level of cyber-security depends largely on the incentives facing providers and the incentives facing perpetrators. Providers make their decision based on the economic payoff and cost of increased security whereas perpetrators decisions are based on the economic gain and cost of cyber-crime. Potential [[prisoner’s dilemma]], [[public goods]], and [[Externality|negative externalities]] become sources of cyber-security [[market failure]] when private returns to security are less than the social returns. Therefore, the higher the ratio of public to private benefit the stronger the case for enacting new public policies to realign incentives for actors to fight cyber-crime with increased investment in cyber-security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Corde|first=Joseph|title=Economics, Cyber Security and Cyber Security Policy|url=http://www.cspri.seas.gwu.edu/Presentations%20and%20Recordings/Cordes%20Economics,%20Cyber%20Security%20and%20Cyber%20Security%20Policy.pdf|accessdate=2 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323124111/http://www.cspri.seas.gwu.edu/Presentations%20and%20Recordings/Cordes%20Economics%2C%20Cyber%20Security%20and%20Cyber%20Security%20Policy.pdf|archivedate=23 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal===

In the United States a number of legal statutes define and detail the conditions for prosecution of a cyber-crime and are used not only as a legal counter-measure, but also functions as a behavioral check against the commission of a cyber-crime. Many of the provisions outlined in these acts overlap with each.

====The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act====

The [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]] passed in 1986 is one of the broadest statutes in the US used to combat cyber-crime. It has been amended a number of times, most recently by the [[US Patriot Act]] of 2002 and the Identity theft enforcement and Restitution Act of 2008. Within it is the definition of a “protected computer” used throughout the US legal system to further define computer espionage, computer trespassing, and taking of government, financial, or commerce information, trespassing in a government computer, committing fraud with a protected computer, damaging a protected computer, trafficking in passwords, threatening to damage a protected computer, conspiracy to commit a cyber-crime, and the penalties for violation.&lt;ref&gt;18 U.S.C. § 1030&lt;/ref&gt; The 2002 update on the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]] expands the act to include the protection of “information from any protected computer if the conduct involved an interstate or foreign communication.”&lt;ref name="Loibl, T. 2005 p. 119"/&gt;

====The Digital Millennium Copyright Act====

The [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] passed in 1998 is a United States copyright law that criminalizes the production and dissemination of technology, devices, or services intended circumvent [[Digital Rights Management]] (DRM), and circumvention of access control.&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. §§ 512, 1201–1205, 1301–1332;&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Electronic Communications Privacy Act====

The [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act]] of 1986 extends the government restrictions on wiretaps from telephones. This law is generally thought in the perspective of what law enforcement may do to intercept communications, but it also pertains to how an organization may draft their acceptable use policies and monitor communications.&lt;ref&gt;18 U.S.C. § 2510-2511&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Stored Communications Act====

The [[Stored Communications Act]] passed in 1986 is focused on protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic communications that are currently in some form of electronic storage. This law was drafted with the purpose of protecting the privacy of e-mails and other electronic communications.&lt;ref&gt;18 U.S.C. § 2701 - 2712&lt;/ref&gt;

====Identity Theft and Aggravated Identity Theft====

The Identity Theft and Aggravated Identity Theft statute is a subsection of the Identification and Authentication Fraud statute. It defines the conditions under which an individual has violated identity theft laws.&lt;ref&gt;18 U.S.C. § 1028&lt;/ref&gt;

====Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act====

[[Identity theft]] was declared unlawful by the federal Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998 (ITADA). Criminals knowingly transferring or using, without lawful authority, “a means of identification of another person with the intent to commit, or to aid abet, any unlawful activity that constitutes a violation of federal law, or that constitutes a felony under any applicable State or local law.”&lt;ref&gt;Luong, K. (2006) The other side of identity theft: Not just a financial concern. Proceedings of the 3rd Annual Conference on Information Security Curriculum Development. Kennesaw, GA: ACM. p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Penalties of the ITADA include up to 15 years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000 and directly reflect the amount of damage caused by the criminal’s actions and their amount of planning and intent.&lt;ref name="Loibl, T. 2005 p. 119"/&gt;

====Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act====

The [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]] (GLBA) requires that financial institutions and credit agencies increase the security of systems that contain their customers’ personal information. It mandates that all financial institutions “design, implement, and maintain safeguards to protect customer information.”&lt;ref&gt;Novak, C. (2007) Investigative response: After the breach. Computers &amp; Security. 
v. 26, n. 2, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Internet Spyware Prevention Act====

The [[Internet Spyware Prevention Act]] (I-SPY) prohibits the implementation and use of [[spyware]] and [[adware]]. I-SPY also includes a sentence for “intentionally accessing a computer with the intent to install unwanted software.”&lt;ref&gt;Loibl, T. (2005) Identity Theft, Spyware, and the Law. Proceedings of the 2nd Annual Conference on Information Security Curriculum Development. Kennesaw, GA: ACM. p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Access Device Fraud Statutes====

18 U.S.C. § 1029 outlines 10 different offenses under which an offender could violate concerning device fraud. These offenses include:
*Knowingly trafficking in a counterfeit access device
*Trafficking the counterfeit access device with the intention to committing fraud
*Possessing more than 15 devices with the purpose to defraud
*Production/possession/trafficking in equipment to create access devices if the intent is to defraud
*Receiving payment from an individual in excess of $1,000 in a one-year period who was found using illegal access devices
*Solicitation of another individual with offers to sell illegal access devices
*Distributing or possessing an altered telecommunication device for the purpose of obtaining unauthorized telecommunication services
*Production, possession, or trafficking in a scanning receiver
*Using or possessing a telecommunication device that has been knowingly altered to provide unauthorized access to a telecommunication service
*Using a credit card which was illegally obtained and used to purchase goods and services
&lt;ref&gt;18 U.S.C. § 1029&lt;/ref&gt;

====CAN-SPAM Act====
The [[CAN-SPAM Act]] of 2003 establishes the United States' first national standards for the sending of commercial e-mail and requires the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) to enforce its provisions.&lt;ref&gt;15 U.S.C. 7701, et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;18 U.S.C. § 1037&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wire Fraud Statute====

The [[Wire fraud]] statute outlined in 18 U.S.C. § 1343 applies to crimes committed over different types of electronic medium such as telephone and network communications.&lt;ref&gt;18 U.S.C. § 1343&lt;/ref&gt;

====Communications Interference Statutes====

The communications interference statute listed in 18 U.S.C. § 1362 defines a number of acts under which and individual can be charged with a telecommunications related crime including:
*Maliciously destroying a property such as cable, system, or other means of communication that is operated or controlled by the United States
*Maliciously destroying a property such as cable, system, or other means of communication that is operated or controlled by the United States Military
*Willfully interfering in the working or use of a communications line
*Willfully obstructing or delaying communication transmission over a communications line
*Conspiracy to commit any of the above listed acts

&lt;ref&gt;18 U.S.C. § 1362&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavioral===

Behavioral countermeasures can also be an effective tool in combating cyber-crime.  Public awareness campaigns can educate the public on the various threats of cyber-crime and the many methods used to combat it. It is also here that businesses can also make us of IT policies to help educate and train workers on the importance and practices used to ensure electronic security such as strong password use, the importance of regular patching of security exploits, signs of phishing attacks and malicious code, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLachlan|first=Phara|title=The Importance of Policy Management|url=http://www.itsmwatch.com/itil/article.php/3832606/The-Importance-of-Policy-Management.htm|publisher=ITSM Watch|accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

California, Virginia, and Ohio have implemented services for victims of identity theft, though not well publicized. California has a registry for victims with a confirmed identity theft. Once registered, people can request law enforcement officers call a number staffed 24 hours, year round, to "verify they are telling the truth about their innocence.”&lt;ref name="Luong, K. 2006 p. 153"&gt;Luong, K. (2006) The other side of identity theft: Not just a financial concern. Proceedings of the 3rd Annual Conference on Information Security Curriculum Development. Kennesaw, GA: ACM. p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; In Virginia and Ohio, victims of identity theft are issued a special passport to prove their innocence. However, these passports run the same risk as every other form of identification in that they can eventually be duplicated.&lt;ref name="Luong, K. 2006 p. 153"/&gt;

Financial agencies such as [[bank]]s and [[credit bureaus]] are starting to require verification of data that identity thieves cannot easily obtain. This data includes users’ past addresses and income tax information.&lt;ref name="Luong, K. 2006 p. 153"/&gt; In the near future, it will also include the data located through use of [[biometrics]]. Biometrics is the use “of automated methods for uniquely recognizing humans based upon … intrinsic physical or behavioral traits.”&lt;ref name="Luong, K. 2006 p. 153"/&gt; These methods include [[iris scan]]s, [[voice identification]], and [[fingerprint authentication]]. The First Financial Credit Union has already implemented biometrics in the form of fingerprint authentication in their automated teller machines to combat identity theft. With a similar purpose, Great Britain has announced plans to incorporate computer chips with biometric data into their passports.&lt;ref name="Luong, K. 2006 p. 153"/&gt; However, the greatest problem with the implementation of biometrics is the possibility of privacy invasion.

==Career==
Wherley began his military career in 1969 when he received his commission as a [[second lieutenant]] through the [[Reserve Officer Training Corps]] (ROTC) program at [[Fordham University]]. He earned his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from Fordham, and in 1977 gained a [[Master of Business Administration]] from the [[University of Maryland, College Park]].&lt;ref name=NG1/&gt;

After he was released from active duty Wherley served in a number of staff assignments with the National Guard in Maryland, and for a short time deployed as the deputy operations group commander for fighters at [[Prince Sultan Air Base]] in [[Saudi Arabia]]. As a pilot and instructor, he clocked up more than 5,000 hours of flying time over a multitude of missions.&lt;ref name=NG1/&gt;

Wherley gained his first command in 1985 with the [[121st Fighter Squadron]], and went on to command [[201st Airlift Squadron|Detachment 1]] (later to be re-designated 201st Airlift Squadron).&lt;ref name=NG1/&gt;

At the time of the [[9/11 attacks]] in 2001, Wherley was commander of [[113th Wing]], the Guard unit responsible for protecting Washington D.C.. That morning, Wherley ordered his pilots, who did not launch until after the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] attack, to operate [[weapons free]], meaning that they were permitted to shoot at will.&lt;ref name="National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States 2004 364"&gt;{{cite book|author=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|title=The 9/11 Commission Report|year=2004|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|isbn=0-393-32671-3|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wherley was appointed Commanding General of the [[District of Columbia National Guard]] in 2003. He retired from that position and from the Air Force in 2008.&lt;ref name=NG1/&gt;

==Death==

A '''debutante ball''' ([[American English]]: '''cotillion ball''') is a [[formal wear|formal]] [[Ball (dance party)|ball]] that includes presenting [[debutante]]s during the [[Season (society)|season]], meaning usually during the spring or summer.

Debutant balls may require prior instruction of social [[etiquette]], and appropriate [[morals]].

In the [[United Kingdom]], the tradition with debutantes ceremoniously presented at the [[British royal court]] was discontinued by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1958.

In contemporary [[United States]], most cotillion balls are for [[middle school]]ers as a chance to teach manners and etiquette, and also are a time to socialize with friends at after-parties. The after-parties at cotillion usually feature food, drinks, and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NATIONAL LEAGUE OF JUNIOR COTILLIONS|url=http://nljc.com/companyhistory.htm|accessdate=4 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823082212/http://nljc.com/companyhistory.htm|archivedate=23 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gollatz Cotillion &amp; Social Programs|url=http://www.gollatz.com/dinning-etiquette.shtml|accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JDW Cotillions &amp; Social Education Programs|url=http://www.cotillion.com/jdw/informational-video.html|accessdate=4 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211004749/http://cotillion.com/jdw/informational-video.html|archivedate=11 February 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sea of Okhotsk map.png|thumb|Location of [[Kuril Islands]] in the [[Pacific Ocean|Western Pacific]].]]

The '''evacuation of [[Karafuto]] (Sakhalin) and the [[Kuriles]]''' refers to the events that took place during the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater of World War II]] as the Japanese population left these areas, to August 1945 in the northwest of the main islands of [[Japan]].

The evacuation started under the threat of [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|Soviet invasion]]. As Japanese civilians evacuated [[Korea]] and [[Manchuria]], they cleared out of the Karafuto and Kurile Islands according to the terms of the [[Potsdam Declaration]] that the terms of the [[1943 Cairo Declaration|Cairo Declaration]] would be carried out, and Japanese sovereignty would be limited to the ''[[Japanese archipelago|Home Islands]]'' of Honshū, Hokkaidō, Kyushu, Shikoku and such minor islands as the Allies determined.

==Timeline==

===Karafuto===
{{refimprove-section|date=October 2015}}
{{Main|Invasion of South Sakhalin}}
The operation began with the crossing of the Horonai (Poronai) Japanese frontier river post and bombardment of the [[Handenzawa]] Japanese land frontier post in [[Shikuka]] district, as well as the advance to the north of [[Koton, Sakhalin Oblast|Koton]] (now [[Pobedino]]), a powerful fortified district (FD). Severe fighting with heavy losses on both sides continued for over a week, with Soviet troops breaking the Japanese defenses on August 18. The Soviets also landed their naval forces deep behind enemy frontlines to aid their ground forces.

According to some of the 6,000 refugees already evacuated from the area, Soviet forces carried out fierce naval bombardment and artillery strikes against civilians awaiting evacuation as well as Japanese installations in [[Maoka]], [[Shikuka]] on August 10.&lt;ref name="ealey-2006"/&gt; Nearly 1,000 civilians were killed by machine-gun fire in this attack.&lt;ref name="ealey-2006"/&gt; [[switchboard operator|Telephone operator]]s in the city decided not to evacuate, instead maintaining contact with the [[Wakkanai, Hokkaidō|Wakkanai]] and [[Mainland Japan]] until the moment that Soviet forces destroyed the telephone and postal installations in the city.&lt;ref name="ealey-2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://japanfocus.org/-mark-ealey/1988/article.html |title=An August Storm: the Soviet-Japan Endgame in the Pacific War |first=Mark |last=Ealey |date=February 26, 2006 |publisher=The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus |accessdate=November 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On August 20, after Japan's surrender, fearing that they would be raped by the invading Soviet troops, nine of the twelve female operators poisoned themselves. Three were saved by male colleagues' intervention. The survivors at the post office were treated well by the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt; Murakawa, Miyuki [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/01/12/national/mourners-mark-wwii-sakhalin-post-office-suicides/ ''[[The Japan Times]]'' Jan 12, 2015 Mourners mark WWII Sakhalin post office suicides] Retrieved July 29, 2015 &lt;/ref&gt;

On August 16, the coastguard ''[[Uragan-class guard ship|Zarnitsa]]'', four minesweepers, two transports, six gunboats and nineteen torpedo boats landed in Port [[Toro (Japan)|Toro]] (now [[Shakhtersk]]) with the 365th Separate Marine Battalion and one battalion of the 113th Infantry Brigade. The troops instantly engaged the Japanese in fierce battle and by morning of the next day had captured four populated areas and the port city of [[Esutoru]] (now [[Uglegorsk, Sakhalin Oblast|Uglegorsk]]), [[Anbetsu]] (now Vozvrashcheniye) and [[Yerinai]]).

During the [[Soviet assault on Maoka]], on August 20, a combined marine battalion and the 113th Infantry Brigade landed in Port [[Maoka]] (now [[Kholmsk]]). They were preceded by a group of scouts, landed secretly by a submarine, in the Maoka area to successfully complete their task. However, Japanese resistance was desperate, and the landing party had to fight particularly fiercely. Japanese fire set one of the coastguard vessels on fire, to which the Soviet response was intense naval bombardment of the city, causing more civilian deaths.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

The rest of the Japanese Maoka defenders retreated by Tei (now [[Polyakovo]]) and [[Futomato]] (now Chaplanovo) in [[Ikenohata]] county, between the mountains in the direction of [[Toyohara]] in order to make a last stand in the capital of the province or in [[Kawakami Sumiyama]] county for sustained guerrilla resistance.

On August 25, another 1,600 men landed in [[Korsakov (town)|Otomari]] (now [[Korsakov (town)|Korsakov]]). The Japanese garrison of 3,400 men laid down their arms with almost no resistance and surrendered. Some vessels of the last convoy, including civilian evacuees, had been sunk by Soviet submarines in the [[Aniva Gulf]].

===Kuriles===
{{Main|Invasion of the Kuril Islands}}
The rout of Japanese forces in [[Manchuria]] and [[Sakhalin]] created favorable conditions for invasion of the [[Kurile Islands]]. The key Japanese position was on [[Shumushu]] and [[Paramushiro]] Islands. On August 18, two coast guard ships, the mine layer ''[[Okhotsk]]'', four minesweepers, 17 transports and 16 special landing vessels with nearly 9,000 sailors, soldiers, and officers on board, approached Shumushu and Paramushiro to start the landing operation. The Japanese offered fierce resistance. Bloody battles took place in Shumushu and Paramushiro with varying success till August 23 when the Japanese garrison surrendered.

By the end of August, all the northern Kuriles were under the control of Soviet forces, including [[Uruppu]] Island. The [[Northern Pacific Flotilla]] occupied the rest of the islands to the south of Uruppu. Up to 60,000 Japanese officers and men were taken prisoner in the Kuriles. The landing operation in the Kuriles was the last of World War II.

In the [[Kuriles]] a similar pattern was repeated when Japanese civilians desperately retired from [[Shumushu]] and [[Paramushiro]] before the Soviet invasion (the Russians only sank one war vessel transporting some Japanese troops), but did not occur at the time in some islands such as [[Uruppu]] and [[South Kuriles]]. In these cases, Russian troops arrived in aggressive form to expel local citizens and confiscate local property.

==Fate of Western residents and Allied prisoners in the area==
Similar treatment faced the [[Germany|German]], [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] and [[Poland|Polish]] citizens who resided in these provinces, the [[White Movement|White Russians]] in the area (living from ancient [[Russia]]n administration under the [[Treaty of Shimoda|Shimoda agreement]]), were arrested, accused of high treason and collaboration with an enemy power. Some were sent to [[gulag]]s in Eastern Siberia, others were executed. Similar things happened to White Russians living in Manchukuo, Kwantung or North Chosen (Korea).

Some versions (including the work of American researchers) allege that Japanese forces during wartime sent certain [[Western world|Western]] [[POW]]s ([[United States|Americans]], [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Netherlands|Dutch]], and the like) to detention camps in [[Karafuto]] and the [[Kuriles]] from other areas in [[Southeast Asia]] as well as to detention centers in [[Hokkaidō]] ([[Otaru]] POW center) and North [[Honshū]], [[Manchukuo]] or Chōsen (the Japanese name for what later became [[North Korea]]).

The final fate of the supposed [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[POW]]s when [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces arrived in these areas previously under Japanese administration, if unknown, is very similar to [[United States|Americans]] captured or interned in [[Vladivostok]] (during the [[Doolittle Raid]] or [[B-29]] strikes against [[Manchukuo]] industry) or [[Kamchatka]] (when Americans carried out some air strikes against North [[Kuriles]] Islands). Some reports also exist mentioning the possibly of identifying Americans interned in East [[Siberia]]n gulags in the same period, and possibly into the [[Cold War]] period. Such a topic still awaits in-depth research by historians and experts of the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/frd/tfrussia/tfrhtml/tfrsplit/tfr010.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9709">In [[philosophy]], '''events''' are objects in [[time]] or instantiations of [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] in objects.

==Kim’s property-exemplification==

[[Jaegwon Kim]] theorized that events are structured.&lt;br&gt;
They are composed of three things:
# Object(s) [x],
# a property [P] and
# time or a [[Time standard|temporal interval]] [t].
Events are defined using the [[operational definition|operation]] [x, P, t].&lt;br&gt;
A unique event is defined by two principles:&lt;br&gt;
:a) the existence condition and
:b) the identity condition.
The existence condition states “[x, P, t] exists if and only if object x exemplifies the n-adic P at time t”. This means a unique event exists if the above is met. The identity condition states “[x, P, t] is [y, Q, t`] if and only if x=y, P=Q and t=t`].

Kim uses these to define events under five conditions:
# One, they are unrepeatable, unchangeable [[particular]]s that include changes and the states and conditions of that event.
# Two, they have a [[semi-temporal]] location.
# Three, only their constructive property creates distinct events.
# Four, holding a constructive property as a generic event creates a type-token relationship between events, and events are not limited to their three requirements (i.e. [x, P, t]). Critics of this theory such as [[Myles Brand]] have suggested that the theory be modified so that an event had a [[spacetime|spatiotemporal]] region; consider the event of a flash of lightning. The idea is that an event must include both the span of time of the flash of lightning and the area in which it occurred.

&lt;!-- ****************************** --&gt;
&lt;!-- the fifth condition is missing!--&gt;
&lt;!-- ****************************** --&gt;

Other problems exist within Kim’s theory, as he never specified what properties were (e.g. [[universals]], [[Trope (philosophy)|tropes]], natural classes, etc.). In addition, it is not specified if properties are few or abundant. The following is Kim’s response to the above.

{{Quotation|. . . [T]he basic generic events may be best picked out relative to a scientific theory, whether the theory is a common-sense theory of the behavior of middle-sized objects or a highly sophisticated physical theory. They are among the important properties, relative to the theory, in terms of which lawful regularities can be discovered, described, and explained. The basic parameters in terms of which the laws of the theory are formulated would, on this view, give us our basic generic events, and the usual logical, mathematical, and perhaps other types of operations on them would yield complex, defined generic events. We commonly recognize such properties as motion, colors, temperatures, weights, pushing, and breaking, as generic events and states, but we must view this against the background of our common-sense explanatory and predictive scheme of the world around us. I think it highly likely that we cannot pick out generic events completely ''a priori''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jaegwon Kim]] (1993) ''Supervenience and Mind'', page 37, [[Cambridge University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is also a major debate about the essentiality of a constitutive object. There are two major questions involved in this: If one event occurs, could it have occurred in the same manner if it were another person, and could it occur in the same manner if it would have occurred at a different time? Kim holds that neither are true and that different conditions (i.e. a different person or time) would lead to a separate event. However, some consider it natural to assume the opposite.

==Davidson==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
[[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] and [[John Lemmon]] proposed a theory of events that had two major conditions, respectively: a causal criterion and a spatiotemporal criterion.

The causal criterion defines an event as two events being the same if and only if they have the same [[Causality|cause and effect]].

The spatiotemporal criterion defines an event as two events being the same if and only if they occur in the same [[space]] at the same [[time]]. Davidson however provided this scenario; if a metal ball becomes warmer during a certain minute, and during the same minute rotates through 35 degrees, must we say that these are the same event? However, one can argue that the warming of the ball and the rotation are possibly temporally separated and are therefore separate events.

==Lewis==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
[[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]] theorized that events are merely spatiotemporal regions and properties (i.e. [[element (mathematics)|membership of a class]]). He defines an event as “e is an event only if it is a class of spatiotemporal regions, both thisworldly (assuming it occurs in the actual world) and otherworldly.” The only problem with this definition is it only tells us what an event could be, but does not define a unique event. This theory entails [[modal realism]], which assumes [[possible worlds]] exist; worlds are defined as sets containing all objects that exist as a part of that set. However, this theory is controversial. Some philosophers have attempted to remove possible worlds, and reduce them to other [[Subjunctive possibility|entities]]. They hold that the world we exist in is the only world that actually exists, and that possible worlds are only possibilities.

Lewis’ theory is composed of four key points. Firstly, the non-duplication principle; it states that x and y are separate events if and only if there is one member of x that is not a member of y (or vice versa). Secondly, there exist regions that are subsets of possible worlds and thirdly, events are not structured by an essential time.

==Badiou==

In [[Alain Badiou#Introduction to ''Being and Event''|''Being and Event'']], [[Alain Badiou]] writes that the event (''événement'') is a multiple which basically does not make sense according to the rules of the "situation," in other words existence.  Hence, the event "is not," and therefore, in order for there to be an event, there must be an "intervention" which changes the rules of the situation in order to allow that particular event to be ("to be" meaning to be a multiple which belongs to the multiple of the situation&amp;nbsp;— these terms are drawn from or defined in reference to [[set theory]]).  In his view, there is no "one," and everything that {{not a typo|is is}} a "multiple."  "One" happens when the situation "counts," or accounts for, acknowledges, or defines something: it "counts it as one."  For the event to be counted as one by the situation, or counted in the one of the situation, an intervention needs to decide its belonging to the situation.  This is because his definition of the event violates the prohibition against self-belonging (in other words, it is a set-theoretical definition which violates set theory's rules of consistency), thus does not count as extant on its own.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alain Badiou]] (1988) ''L'Être et l'Événement''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deleuze==
[[Gilles Deleuze]] lectured on the concept of ''event'' on March 10, 1987. A sense of the lecture is described by James Williams.&lt;ref&gt;Charles J. Stivale (editor) (2011) ''Gilles Deleuze: Key Concepts'', 2nd edition, chapter 6: Event, pp 80–90&lt;/ref&gt; Williams also wrote, "From the point of view of the difference between two possible worlds, the event is all important".&lt;ref&gt;James Williams (2003) ''Gilles Deleuze’s [[Difference and Repetition]]: A Critical Introduction and Guide'', page 78, [[Edinburgh University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated, "Every event is revolutionary due to an integration of signs, acts and structures through the whole event. Events are distinguished by the intensity of this revolution, rather than the types of freedom or chance."&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2003 p xi&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 Deleuze published a magazine article "Signes et événements"&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Deleuze (1988) "Signes et événements", ''Magazine Littéraire'', #257, pages 16 to 25&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Nietszche and Philosophy'', he addresses the question "Which one is beautiful?" In the preface to the English translation he wrote:
:The one that ... does not refer to an individual, to a person, but rather to an event, that is, to the forces in their various relationships to a proposition or phenomenon, and the genetic relationship that determines these forces (power).&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hart (1993) ''Gilles Deleuze: An apprenticeship in philosophy'', page 31, [[University of Minnesota Press]] {{ISBN|0-8166-2160-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kirkeby==
The Danish philosopher [[Ole Fogh Kirkeby]] deserves mentioning, as he has written a comprehensive trilogy about the event, or in Danish "begivenheden". In the first work of the trilogy "Eventum tantum – begivenhedens ethos"&lt;ref&gt;Ole Fogh Kirkeby (2005) ''Eventum tantum : Begivenhedens ethos.'' København: Samfundslitteratur&lt;/ref&gt; (Eventum tantum - the ethos of the event) he distinguishes between three levels of the event, inspired from [[Nicola Cusanus]]: Eventum tantum as non aliud, the alma-event and the proto-event.

Everton Conger was born in [[Huron County, Ohio]], in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;Some sources state that Everton Conger was born in what is now West Virginia&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the son of Rev. Enoch Conger, a Presbyterian minister. In 1856, he moved to [[Fremont, Ohio]], where he established a dental practice.

Conger enlisted in the [[Union army]] during the Civil War, initially as a private in the three-months [[8th Ohio Infantry]]. He returned to Fremont with the expiration of his term of enlistment and married Emma "Kate" Boren on October 16, 1861, with whom he had five children. He later became a [[captain (United States)|captain]] in the [[3rd West Virginia Cavalry]] and eventually rose to the rank of [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] of the 1st District of Columbia Cavalry.  He suffered three severe wounds during combat and was assigned to detached duty in [[Washington, D.C.]], joining General [[Lafayette Baker]]'s intelligence service as a detective.

Following the [[Lincoln assassination|assassination of President Lincoln]] on April 14, 1865, Conger was ordered to accompany a detachment of 25 Union soldiers from the 16th New York Cavalry Regiment, led by Lieutenant [[Edward P. Doherty]]. The soldiers pursued Booth through Southern Maryland and across the [[Potomac River|Potomac]] and [[Rappahannock River|Rappahannock]] rivers to Richard Garrett's farm, just south of [[Port Royal, Virginia|Port Royal]], [[Caroline County, Virginia|Caroline County]], [[Virginia]]. Booth and his accomplice, [[David E. Herold]], had been led to the farm by William Storke "Willie" Jett, formerly a private in the [[9th Virginia Cavalry]], whom they had met before crossing the Rappahannock.&lt;ref name=NPS&gt;{{cite web | title = John Wilkes Booth's Escape Route  | work = Ford's Theatre, National Historic Site  | publisher = [[National Park Service]] | date = December 22, 2004 | url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/foth/escapjwb.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conger tracked down Jett and interrogated him, learning of Booth's location at the Garrett farm, and led the soldiers there. Arriving early in the morning of April 26, 1865, the soldiers found Booth and Herold hiding in a tobacco barn. Although Herold surrendered, Booth refused.&lt;ref name=NPS/&gt;

Conger set fire to the barn and Sergeant [[Boston Corbett]] mortally wounded Booth by shooting him in the neck. Booth was dragged from the barn and died on the porch of the Garrett farmhouse.&lt;ref name=NPS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Lieut.

Conger removed Booth's personal effects, including a diary.  Conger was given $15,000 as a reward for the successful operation. The city of Fremont gave him a pair of inscribed silver-handled pistols in recognition for his role in tracking down Booth.

Conger moved to [[Illinois]], built a home, and practiced law in [[Carmi, Illinois|Carmi]].  Later he was appointed a [[United States District Court]] judge in the [[Montana Territory]].  He eventually moved to [[Hawaii]] to live with his daughter, dying there in 1918.  He was buried in Montana.

The '''financial crisis of 2007–2008''', also known as the '''global financial crisis''' and the '''2008 financial crisis''', is considered by many economists to have been the worst [[financial crisis]] since the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS193520+27-Feb-2009+BW20090227 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212214538/https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS193520%2B27-Feb-2009%2BBW20090227 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 12, 2010 |title=Two top economists agree 2009 worst financial crisis since great depression; risks increase if right steps are not taken |date=February 27, 2009 |newspaper=Reuters |access-date=November 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Great Depression(s) of 1929–1933 and 2007–2009?

It began in 2007 with a crisis in the [[subprime mortgage]] market in the United States, and developed into a full-blown international [[banking crisis]] with the collapse of the investment bank [[Lehman Brothers]] on September 15, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Uncontrolled Risk|last=Williams|first=Mark|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|date=April 12, 2010|isbn=978-0-07-163829-6|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive risk-taking by banks such as Lehman Brothers helped to magnify the financial impact globally.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Uncontrolled Risk|last=Williams|first=Mark|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|date=April 12, 2010|isbn=978-0-07-163829-6|location=|pages=213|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massive [[bailout|bail-outs]] of financial institutions and other palliative monetary and fiscal policies were employed to prevent a possible collapse of the [[world financial system]]. The crisis was nonetheless followed by a global [[economic downturn]], the [[Great Recession]]. The [[European debt crisis]], a crisis in the banking system of the European countries using the [[euro]], followed later.

In 2010, the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] was enacted in the US following the crisis to "promote the financial stability of the United States".&lt;ref&gt;{{USPL|111|203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Basel III]] capital and liquidity standards were adopted by countries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monitoring adoption of Basel standards|url=http://www.bis.org/bcbs/implementation/bprl1.htm|publisher=Bank for International Settlements|accessdate=February 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
===Subprime mortgage bubble===
The precipitating factor for the Financial Crisis of 2007–2008 was a high default rate in the United States [[Subprime lending|subprime]] home mortgage sector – the bursting of the "subprime bubble". While the causes of the bubble are disputed, some or all of the following factors must have contributed.
* Low interest rates encouraged mortgage lending. 
* Securitization. Many mortgages were bundled together and formed into new financial instruments called [[mortgage-backed securities]], in a process known as [[securitization]]. These bundles could be sold as (ostensibly) low-risk securities partly because they were often backed by [[credit default swaps]] insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Credit Default Swaps and the Credit Crisis |doi=10.1257/jep.24.1.73 |first=René M. |last=Stulz|journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume =24 |issue=1 |date=Winter 2010 |pp= 73–92 |url=https://fisher.osu.edu/supplements/10/10402/credit-default-swaps-and-the-credit-crisis.pdf|access-date=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because mortgage lenders could pass these mortgages (and the associated risks) on in this way, they could and did adopt loose underwriting criteria (due in part to outdated and lax regulation).
* Lax regulation allowed predatory lending in the private sector,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The 2008 Housing Crisis|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2017/04/13/430424/2008-housing-crisis|website=americanprogress.org|access-date=April 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Victimizing the Borrowers: Predatory Lending's Role in the Subprime Mortgage Crisis|url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/victimizing-the-borrowers-predatory-lendings-role-in-the-subprime-mortgage-crisis|website=knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu|access-date=February 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially after the federal government overrode anti-predatory state laws in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Lest We Forget: Why We Had A Financial Crisi|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2011/11/22/5086/#10181f68f92f|website=forbes.com |access-date=November 22, 2011|last=Denning}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Community Reinvestment Act]] (CRA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/communitydev/cra_about.htm|title=The Fed - Community Reinvestment Act|website=federalreserve.gov|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 1977 US federal law designed to help low- and moderate-income Americans get mortgage loans encouraged banks to grant mortgages to higher risk families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Clinton-Era Roots of the Financial Crisis|url=http://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323477604579000571334113350}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Here's How The Community Reinvestment Act Led To The Housing Bubble's Lax Lending|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-cra-debate-a-users-guide-2009-6|website=businessinsider.com |access-date=December 22, 2016|last=Carney}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncsha.org/blog/unc-center-study-debunks-role-cra-housing-crisis|title=UNC Center Study Debunks Role of CRA in Housing Crisis - NCSHA|website=www.ncsha.org|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mortgage guarantees. Many of the subprime (high risk) loans were bundled and sold, finally accruing to quasi-government agencies ([[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/bp120.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The implicit guarantee by the US federal government created a [[moral hazard]] and contributed to a glut of risky lending.
The accumulation and subsequent high default rate of these subprime mortgages led to the financial crisis and the consequent damage to the world economy.

===Banking crisis===
High mortgage approval rates led to a large pool of homebuyers, which drove up housing prices. This appreciation in value led large numbers of homeowners (subprime or not) to borrow against their homes as an apparent windfall. This "bubble" would be burst by a rising single-family residential mortgages delinquency rate beginning in August 2006 and peaking in the first quarter, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (US)|title=Delinquency Rate on Single-Family Residential Mortgages, Booked in Domestic Offices, All Commercial Banks [DRSFRMACBS]|via=FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis|url=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRSFRMACBS|accessdate=December 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high delinquency rates led to a rapid devaluation of financial instruments (mortgage-backed securities including bundled loan portfolios, derivatives and credit default swaps). As the value of these assets plummeted, the market (buyers) for these securities evaporated and banks who were heavily invested in these assets began to experience a liquidity crisis.  [[Freddie Mac]] and [[Fannie Mae]] were taken over by the federal government on September 7, 2008. [[Lehman Brothers]] filed for bankruptcy on September 15, 2008. [[Merrill Lynch]], [[AIG]], [[HBOS]], [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], [[Bradford &amp; Bingley]], [[Fortis (finance)|Fortis]], [[Hypo Real Estate]], and [[Alliance &amp; Leicester]] were all expected to follow—with a US federal bailout announced the following day beginning with $85 billion to AIG. In spite of trillions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikecollins/2015/07/14/the-big-bank-bailout/|date=July 14, 2015|title=The Big Bank Bailout|first=Mike|last=Collins|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; paid out by the US federal government, it became much more difficult to borrow money. The resulting decrease in buyers caused housing prices to plummet.

===Consequences===
While the collapse of large financial institutions was prevented by the [[bailout]] of banks by national governments, [[stock market]]s still dropped worldwide. In many areas, the housing market also suffered, resulting in [[eviction]]s, [[foreclosure]]s, and prolonged unemployment. The crisis played a significant role in the failure of key businesses, declines in consumer wealth estimated in trillions of US dollars, and a downturn in economic activity leading to the [[Great Recession]] of 2008–2012 and contributing to the [[European sovereign-debt crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/papers/2009/0615_economic_crisis_baily_elliott/0615_economic_crisis_baily_elliott.pdf|title=Brookings-Financial Crisis|format=PDF|accessdate=May 1, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602131359/http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/papers/2009/0615_economic_crisis_baily_elliott/0615_economic_crisis_baily_elliott.pdf|archivedate=June 2, 2010

===Background causes===
Many causes for the financial crisis have been suggested, with varying weight assigned by experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20090414a.htm|title=Bernanke-Four Questions|publisher=Federalreserve.gov|date=April 14, 2009|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The US Senate's [[Wall Street and the Financial Crisis: Anatomy of a Financial Collapse|Levin–Coburn Report]] concluded that the crisis was the result of "high risk, complex financial products; undisclosed conflicts of interest; the failure of regulators, the credit rating agencies, and the market itself to rein in the excesses of Wall Street."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hsgac.senate.gov/public/_files/Financial_Crisis/FinancialCrisisReport.pdf|title=Senate Financial Crisis Report, 2011|format=PDF|accessdate=April 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]] concluded that the financial crisis was avoidable and was caused by "widespread failures in [[financial regulation]] and supervision", "dramatic failures of [[corporate governance]] and [[risk management]] at many systemically important [[financial institutions]]", "a combination of excessive borrowing, risky investments, and lack of transparency" by financial institutions, ill preparation and  inconsistent action by government that "added to the uncertainty and panic", a "systemic breakdown in accountability and ethics", "collapsing mortgage-lending standards and the mortgage securitization pipeline", deregulation of [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]], especially [[credit default swap]]s, and "the failures of credit rating agencies" to correctly price risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf Final Report of the National Commission on the Causes of the Financial and Economic Crisis in the United States]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
{{Main|Causes of the Great Recession}}
The immediate cause or trigger of the crisis was the bursting of the US housing bubble, which peaked in 2006/2007.&lt;ref name="USCensus-new-housing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Census home ownership" /&gt;  Already-rising default rates on "[[subprime]]" and [[adjustable-rate mortgage]]s (ARM) began to increase quickly thereafter.

Easy availability of credit in the US, fueled by large inflows of foreign funds after the [[1998 Russian financial crisis|Russian debt crisis]] and [[1997 Asian financial crisis|Asian financial crisis]] of the 1997–1998 period, led to a housing construction boom and facilitated debt-financed consumer spending. As banks began to give out more loans to potential home owners, housing prices began to rise. Lax lending standards and rising real estate prices also contributed to the real estate bubble. Loans of various types (e.g., mortgage, credit card, and auto) were easy to obtain and consumers assumed an unprecedented debt load.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/24/business/economy/24text-bush.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;oref=slogin|title=President Bush's Address to Nation|work=The New York Times|date=September 24, 2008|accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20090414a.htm|title=Bernanke-Four Questions About the Financial Crisis|publisher=Federalreserve.gov|date=April 14, 2009|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/02/opinion/02krugman.html?pagewanted=print|last=Krugman|first=Paul|title=Revenge of the Glut|date=March 2, 2009|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the housing and credit booms, the number of financial agreements called [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] (MBS) and [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDO), which derived their value from mortgage payments and housing prices, greatly increased.&lt;ref name=ssrn /&gt; Such [[financial innovation]] enabled institutions and investors around the world to invest in the US housing market. As housing prices declined, major global financial institutions that had borrowed and invested heavily in subprime MBS reported significant losses.&lt;ref name="IMF Loss Estimates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/01/pdf/exesum.pdf|title=IMF Loss Estimates|format=PDF|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Falling prices also resulted in homes worth less than the mortgage loan, providing the lender with a financial incentive to enter [[foreclosure]].{{Clarify|reason=if the outcome of foreclosure for the lender would be a financial loss compared with the paper value of the mortgage, why would this be a financial incentive to foreclose?|date=September 2016}} The ongoing foreclosure epidemic that began in late 2006 in the US and only reduced to historical levels in early 2014&lt;ref name="RealtyTrac Foreclosure Rates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realtytrac.com/news/foreclosure-trends/q1-2016-u-s-foreclosure-market-report/|title=RealtyTrac Foreclosure Rates|accessdate=June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; drained significant wealth from consumers, losing up to $4.2 [[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]]&lt;ref name="Estimate of Household Wealth lost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mybudget360.com/the-balance-sheet-recession-42-trillion-lost-in-residential-real-estate-value-yet-mortgage-debt-down-by-140-billion/|title=Estimate of Household Wealth lost|accessdate=June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in wealth from [[home equity]]. Defaults and losses on other loan types also increased significantly as the crisis expanded from the housing market to other parts of the economy. Total losses are estimated in the trillions of US dollars globally.&lt;ref name="IMF Loss Estimates" /&gt;

While the housing and credit bubbles were building, a series of factors caused the financial system to both expand and become increasingly fragile, a process called [[financialization]]. US government policy from the 1970s onward has emphasized [[deregulation]] to encourage business, which resulted in less oversight of activities and less disclosure of information about new activities undertaken by banks and other evolving financial institutions. Thus, policymakers did not immediately recognize the increasingly important role played by financial institutions such as investment banks and [[hedge funds]], also known as the [[shadow banking system]]. Some experts believe these institutions had become as important as commercial (depository) banks in providing credit to the US economy, but they were not subject to the same regulations.&lt;ref name="newyorkfed.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2008/tfg080609.html|title=Geithner-Speech Reducing Systemic Risk in a Dynamic Financial System|publisher=Newyorkfed.org|date=June 9, 2008|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These institutions, as well as certain regulated banks, had also assumed significant debt burdens while providing the loans described above and did not have a financial cushion sufficient to absorb large loan defaults or MBS losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9c158a92-1a3c-11de-9f91-0000779fd2ac.html|title=Greenspan-We Need a Better Cushion Against Risk|work=Financial Times|date=March 26, 2009|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These losses affected the ability of financial institutions to lend, slowing economic activity. Concerns regarding the stability of key financial institutions drove central banks to provide funds to encourage lending and restore faith in the [[commercial paper]] markets, which are integral to funding business operations. Governments also [[bailout|bailed out]] key financial institutions and implemented economic stimulus programs, assuming significant additional financial commitments.

The US [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]] reported its findings in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://c0182732.cdn1.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/fcic_final_report_conclusions.pdf |title=FCIC Final Report Conclusions.pdf|accessdate=March 4, 2011 |deadurl=unfit|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304020317/http://c0182732.cdn1.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/fcic_final_report_conclusions.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It concluded that:

* widespread failures in financial regulation, including the Federal Reserve's failure to stem the tide of [[Toxic asset|toxic mortgages]];
* dramatic breakdowns in corporate governance including too many financial firms acting recklessly and taking on too much risk;

===Subprime lending===
{{Main|Subprime mortgage crisis}}

The 2000s were the decade of subprime borrowers; no longer was this a segment left to fringe lenders. The relaxing of credit lending standards by investment banks and commercial banks drove this about-face. Subprime did not become magically less risky; Wall Street just accepted this higher risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Uncontrolled Risk|last=Williams|first=Mark|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|date=April 12, 2010|isbn=978-0-07-163829-6|location=|pages=125|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a period of tough competition between mortgage lenders for revenue and market share, and when the supply of creditworthy borrowers was limited, mortgage lenders relaxed underwriting standards and originated riskier mortgages to less creditworthy borrowers.&lt;ref name="ssrn"&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1924831 ''Competition and Crisis in Mortgage Securitization'']&lt;/ref&gt; In the view of some analysts, the relatively conservative [[government-sponsored enterprise]]s (GSEs) policed mortgage originators and maintained relatively high underwriting standards prior to 2003. However, as market power shifted from securitizers to originators and as intense competition from private securitizers undermined GSE power, mortgage standards declined and risky loans proliferated.&lt;ref name="ssrn" /&gt; The worst loans were originated in 2004–2007, the years of the most intense competition between securitizers and the lowest market share for the GSEs.

[[File:U.S. Home Ownership and Subprime Origination Share.png|thumb|upright=1.6|US subprime lending expanded dramatically 2004–2006]]

As well as easy credit conditions, there is evidence that competitive pressures contributed to an increase in the amount of subprime lending during the years preceding the crisis. Major US investment banks and GSEs such as [[Fannie Mae]] played an important role in the expansion of lending, with GSEs eventually relaxing their standards to try to catch up with the private banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Labaton|first=Stephen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/business/03sec.html|title=NY Times-The Reckoning-Agency 04 Rule Lets Banks Pile on Debt|work=The New York Times|date=October 2, 2008|accessdate=April 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duhigg|first=Charles|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/05/business/05fannie.html|title=NYT-The Reckoning-Pressured to Take More Risk, Fannie Reached Tipping Point|work=The New York Times|date=October 4, 2008|accessdate=April 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contrarian view is that Fannie Mae and [[Freddie Mac]] led the way to relaxed underwriting standards, starting in 1995, by advocating the use of easy-to-qualify automated underwriting and appraisal systems, by designing the no-down-payment products issued by lenders, by the promotion of thousands of small mortgage brokers, and by their close relationship to subprime loan aggregators such as [[Bank of America Home Loans|Countrywide]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Fried, Who Really Drove the Economy into the Ditch? (New York, NY: Algora Publishing, 2012), 16–42, 67–119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graham Fisher"&gt;{{cite web|title=Housing in the New Millennium: A Home without Equity Is Just a Rental with debt|publisher=Ssrn.com|author=Graham Fisher|date=June 29, 2001|ssrn=1162456|accessdate=November 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on how "subprime" mortgages are defined, they remained below 10% of all mortgage originations until 2004, when they rose to nearly 20% and remained there through the 2005–2006 peak of the United States housing bubble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jchs.harvard.edu/publications/markets/son2008/son2008.pdf|title=Harvard Report-State of the Nation's Housing 2008 Report|format=PDF|accessdate=May 1, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630164105/http://www.jchs.harvard.edu/publications/markets/son2008/son2008.pdf|archivedate=June 30, 2010|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority report of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, written by the six Democratic appointees, the minority report, written by three of the four Republican appointees, studies by Federal Reserve economists, and the work of several independent scholars generally contend that government affordable housing policy was not the primary cause of the financial crisis.&lt;ref name="ssrn" /&gt; Although they concede that governmental policies had some role in causing the crisis, they contend that GSE loans performed better than loans securitized by private investment banks, and performed better than some loans originated by institutions that held loans in their own portfolios.&lt;ref name="ssrn" /&gt;

In his dissent to the majority report of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, [[American Enterprise Institute]] [[fellow]] [[Peter J. Wallison]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wallison|first=Peter J.|url=http://www.aei.org/article/economics/financial-services/what-got-us-here/|title=''What Got Us Here?'', December&amp;nbsp;2008|publisher=Aei.org|date=December 9, 2008|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated his belief that the roots of the financial crisis can be traced directly and primarily to affordable housing policies initiated by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in the 1990s and to massive risky loan purchases by government-sponsored entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Later, based upon information in the SEC's December 2011 securities fraud case against six former executives of Fannie and Freddie, Peter Wallison and Edward Pinto estimated that, in 2008, Fannie and Freddie held 13 million substandard loans totaling over $2 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Peter J.

In the early and mid-2000s, the Bush administration called numerous times&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bush White House Archive|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/09/20080919-15.html|publisher=whitehouse.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; for investigation into the safety and soundness of the GSEs and their swelling portfolio of subprime mortgages. On September 10, 2003, the House Financial Services Committee held a hearing at the urging of the administration to assess safety and soundness issues and to review a recent report by the [[Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight]] (OFHEO) that had uncovered accounting discrepancies within the two entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OFHEO Report on Systemic Risk|url=http://www.fhfa.gov/webfiles/1145/sysrisk.pdf|publisher=fhfa.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611013004/http://www.fhfa.gov/webfiles/1145/sysrisk.pdf|archivedate=June 11, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hearings never resulted in new legislation or formal investigation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as many of the committee members refused to accept the report and instead rebuked OFHEO for their attempt at regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=House Hearing on OFHEO Report|url=http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/bank/hba97754.000/hba97754_0f.htm|publisher=house.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe this was an early warning to the systemic risk that the growing market in subprime mortgages posed to the US financial system that went unheeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Attempts at Regulating Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac|url=http://www.international-economy.com/TIE_Su04_Wallison.pdf|publisher=international-economy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2000 [[United States Department of the Treasury]] study of lending trends for 305 cities from 1993 to 1998 showed that $467&amp;nbsp;billion of mortgage lending was made by [[Community Reinvestment Act]] (CRA)-covered lenders into low and mid level income (LMI) borrowers and neighborhoods, representing 10% of all US mortgage lending during the period. The majority of these were prime loans. Sub-prime loans made by CRA-covered institutions constituted a 3% market share of LMI loans in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/report3079.htm|title=''The Community Reinvestment Act After Financial Modernization'', April&amp;nbsp;2000|publisher=Ustreas.gov|date=April 15, 2000|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the run-up to the crisis, fully 25% of all sub-prime lending occurred at CRA-covered institutions and another 25% of sub-prime loans had some connection with CRA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=did_liberals_cause_the_subprime_crisis|author1=Robert Gordon|title='Did Liberals Cause the Sub-Prime Crisis?'|work=American Prospect|date=April 7, 2008|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most sub-prime loans were not made to the LMI borrowers targeted by the CRA,{{cn|date=November 2018}} especially in the years 2005–2006 leading up to the crisis,{{cn|date=November 2018}}  nor did it find any evidence that lending under the CRA rules increased delinquency rates or that the CRA indirectly influenced independent mortgage lenders to ramp up sub-prime lending.{{cn|date=November 2018}} 

To other analysts the delay between CRA rule changes (in 1995) and the explosion of subprime lending is not surprising, and does not exonerate the CRA. They contend that there were two, connected causes to the crisis: the relaxation of underwriting standards in 1995 and the ultra-low interest rates initiated by the Federal Reserve after the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001. Both causes had to be in place before the crisis could take place.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Fried, Who Really Drove the Economy Into the Ditch? (New York, NY: Algora Publishing, 2012), 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also point out that publicly announced CRA loan commitments were massive, totaling $4.5 trillion in the years between 1994 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Fried, Who Really Drove the Economy Into the Ditch? (New York, NY: Algora Publishing, 2012), 148.&lt;/ref&gt; They also argue that the Federal Reserve's classification of CRA loans as "prime" is based on the faulty and self-serving assumption that high-interest-rate loans (3 percentage points over average) equal "subprime" loans.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Fried, Who Really Drove the Economy Into the Ditch? (New York, NY: Algora Publishing, 2012), 140–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have pointed out that there were not enough of these loans made to cause a crisis of this magnitude. In an article in ''Portfolio Magazine'', [[Michael Lewis]] spoke with one trader who noted that "There weren't enough Americans with [bad] credit taking out [bad loans] to satisfy investors' appetite for the end product." Essentially, investment banks and hedge funds used financial innovation to enable large wagers to be made, far beyond the actual value of the underlying mortgage loans, using [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] called credit default swaps, collateralized debt obligations and [[synthetic CDO]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://upstart.bizjournals.com/news-markets/national-news/portfolio/2008/11/11/The-End-of-Wall-Streets-Boom.html|title=Portfolio-Michael Lewis-"The End"-December&amp;nbsp;2008|publisher=Portfolio.com|date=September 11, 2008|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2011, the FDIC had paid out $9 billion to cover losses on bad loans at 165 failed financial institutions.&lt;ref name=post&gt;{{cite news|title=FDIC's Tab For Failed U.S. Banks Nears $9 Billion|work=Wall Stree Journal|date=March 16, 2011|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704396504576204752754667840 |first=Robin|last=Sidel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Congressional Budget Office estimated, in June 2011, that the bailout to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac exceeds $300 billion (calculated by adding the fair value deficits of the entities to the direct bailout funds at the time).&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Fried, Who Really Drove the Economy into the Ditch? (New York, NY: Algora Publishing, 2012), 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] argued in January 2010 that the simultaneous growth of the residential and commercial real estate pricing bubbles  and the global nature of the crisis undermines the case made by those who argue that Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, CRA, or predatory lending were primary causes of the crisis. In other words, bubbles in both markets developed even though only the residential market was affected by these potential causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/cre-ative-destruction/|title=CRE-ative destruction|publisher=Krugman.blogs.nytimes.com|date=January 7, 2010|accessdate=November 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Countering Krugman, Peter J. Wallison wrote: "It is not true that every bubble—even a large bubble—has the potential to cause a financial crisis when it deflates." Wallison notes that other developed countries had "large bubbles during the 1997–2007 period" but "the losses associated with mortgage delinquencies and defaults when these bubbles deflated were far lower than the losses suffered in the United States when the 1997–2007 [bubble] deflated." According to Wallison, the reason the US ''residential housing'' bubble (as opposed to other types of bubbles) led to financial crisis was that it was supported by a huge number of substandard loans—generally with low or no downpayments.&lt;ref name="Wallison 1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter J. Wallison|title=Dissent from the Majority Report of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission|publisher=American Enterprise Institute|date=January 2011|url=http://www.aei.org|accessdate=November 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krugman's contention (that the growth of a commercial real estate bubble indicates that US housing policy was not the cause of the crisis) is challenged by additional analysis. After researching the default of commercial loans during the financial crisis, Xudong An and Anthony B. Sanders reported (in December 2010): "We find limited evidence that substantial deterioration in CMBS [commercial mortgage-backed securities] loan underwriting occurred prior to the crisis."&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, Anthony B. and An, Xudong, Default of CMBS Loans During the Crisis (November 29, 2010). 46th Annual AREUEA Conference Paper. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1717062&lt;/ref&gt; Other analysts support the contention that the crisis in commercial real estate and related lending took place ''after'' the crisis in residential real estate. Business journalist Kimberly Amadeo reported: "The first signs of decline in residential real estate occurred in 2006. Three years later, commercial real estate started feeling the effects.&lt;ref&gt;Amadeo, Kimberly, "Commercial Real Estate Lending" in News &amp; Issues – US Economy(About.com, November 2013), http://useconomy.about.com/od/grossdomesticproduct/tp/Commercial-Real-Estate-Loan-Defaults.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Denice A. Gierach, a real estate attorney and CPA, wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... most of the commercial real estate loans were good loans destroyed by a really bad economy. In other words, the borrowers did not cause the loans to go bad, it was the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Gierach, Denice A., "Waiting for the other shoe to drop in commercial real estate," (Chicago, IL, The Business Ledger, March 4, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Growth of the housing bubble===

Between 1998 and 2006, the price of the typical American house increased by 124%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CSI: credit crunch|work=[[The Economist]]|url=http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9972489|accessdate=May 19, 2008|date=October 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the two decades ending in 2001, the national median home price ranged from 2.9 to 3.1 times median household income. This ratio rose to 4.0 in 2004, and 4.6 in 2006.&lt;ref name="businessweek1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/oct2008/pi20081017_950382.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index+-+temp_top+story|title=The Financial Crisis Blame Game – BusinessWeek|work=BusinessWeek|author1=Ben Steverman|author2=David Bogoslaw|date=October 18, 2008&lt;!--, 12:01&amp;nbsp;am EST --&gt;|accessdate=October 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[housing bubble]] resulted in many homeowners refinancing their homes at lower interest rates, or financing consumer spending by taking out [[second mortgage]]s secured by the price appreciation.

In a [[Peabody Award]] winning program, [[National Public Radio|NPR]] correspondents argued that a "Giant Pool of Money" (represented by $70&amp;nbsp;trillion in worldwide fixed income investments) sought higher yields than those offered by US Treasury bonds early in the decade. This pool of money had roughly doubled in size from 2000 to 2007, yet the supply of relatively safe, income generating investments had not grown as fast. Investment banks on Wall Street answered this demand with products such as the [[mortgage-backed security]] and the [[collateralized debt obligation]] that were assigned safe [[Credit rating|ratings]] by the [[credit rating agencies and the subprime crisis|credit rating agencies]].&lt;ref name="This American Life"&gt;{{cite web|author=This American Life|url=http://www.pri.org/business/giant-pool-of-money.html|title=NPR-The Giant Pool of Money|publisher=Pri.org|accessdate=May 1, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415153017/http://www.pri.org/business/giant-pool-of-money.html|archivedate=April 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In effect, Wall Street connected this pool of money to the mortgage market in the US, with enormous fees accruing to those throughout the mortgage [[supply chain]], from the mortgage broker selling the loans to small banks that funded the brokers and the large investment banks behind them. By approximately 2003, the supply of mortgages originated at traditional lending standards had been exhausted, and continued strong demand began to drive down lending standards.&lt;ref name="This American Life" /&gt;

The collateralized debt obligation in particular enabled financial institutions to obtain investor funds to finance subprime and other lending, extending or increasing the housing bubble and generating large fees. This essentially places cash payments from multiple mortgages or other debt obligations into a single pool from which specific securities draw in a specific sequence of priority. Those securities first in line received investment-grade ratings from rating agencies.

===Easy credit conditions===
Lower interest rates encouraged borrowing.

[[File:U.S. Trade Deficit Dollars and % GDP.png|thumb|right|upright=1.6|US current account deficit.]]
Additional downward pressure on interest rates was created by the high and rising US [[current account]] deficit, which peaked along with the housing bubble in 2006. Federal Reserve chairman [[Ben Bernanke]] explained how trade deficits required the US to borrow money from abroad, in the process bidding up bond prices and lowering interest rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20050414/default.htm|title=Bernanke-The Global Saving Glut and U.S. Current Account Deficit|publisher=Federalreserve.gov|accessdate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernanke explained that between 1996 and 2004, the US current account deficit increased by $650&amp;nbsp;billion, from 1.5% to 5.8% of GDP. Financing these deficits required the country to borrow large sums from abroad, much of it from countries running trade surpluses. These were mainly the emerging economies in Asia and oil-exporting nations. The [[balance of payments]] [[identity (mathematics)|identity]] requires that a country (such as the US) running a [[current account]] deficit also have a [[capital account]] (investment) surplus of the same amount. Hence large and growing amounts of foreign funds (capital) flowed into the US to finance its imports.

All of this created demand for various types of financial assets, raising the prices of those assets while lowering interest rates. Foreign investors had these funds to lend either because they had very high personal savings rates (as high as 40% in China) or because of high oil prices. Ben Bernanke has referred to this as a "[[saving glut]]".&lt;ref name=Bernanke&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20070911a.htm|title=Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, At the Bundesbank Lecture, Berlin, Germany September 11, 2007: Global Imbalances: Recent Developments and Prospects|publisher=Federalreserve.gov|accessdate=May 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A flood of funds ([[Financial capital|capital]] or [[liquidity]]) reached the US financial markets. Foreign governments supplied funds by purchasing [[Treasury bond]]s and thus avoided much of the direct effect of the crisis. US households, on the other hand, used funds borrowed from foreigners to finance consumption or to bid up the prices of housing and financial assets. Financial institutions invested foreign funds in [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]].

The Fed then raised the Fed funds rate significantly between July 2004 and July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/data.htm|title=Fed Historical Data-Fed Funds Rate|publisher=Federalreserve.gov|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contributed to an increase in 1-year and 5-year [[adjustable-rate mortgage]] (ARM) rates, making ARM interest rate resets more expensive for homeowners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Mastrobattista|url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OTUyM2MxMThkOWI2MzBmNTM2OGRiYTYwOTA1NzQ1NDE=|title=Mastrobattista|publisher=National Review|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may have also contributed to the deflating of the housing bubble, as asset prices generally move inversely to interest rates, and it became riskier to speculate in housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Max|first=Sarah|url=http://money.cnn.com/2004/07/13/real_estate/buying_selling/risingrates/|title=CNN-The Bubble Question|publisher=CNN|date=July 27, 2004|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_29/b3892064_mz011.htm |title=Business Week-Is a Housing Bubble About to Burst? |work=BusinessWeek |date=July 19, 2004 |accessdate=May 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304164956/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_29/b3892064_mz011.htm |archivedate=March 4, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; US housing and financial assets dramatically declined in value after the housing bubble burst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12972083|title=Economist-When a Flow Becomes a Flood|work=The Economist|date=January 22, 2009|accessdate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Roger C.

===Weak and fraudulent underwriting practices===
Subprime lending standards declined in the USA: in early 2000, a subprime borrower had a FICO score of 660 or less. By 2005, many lenders dropped the required FICO score to 620, making it much easier to qualify for prime loans and making subprime lending a riskier business. Proof of income and assets were de-emphasized. Loans moved from full documentation to low documentation to no documentation. One subprime mortgage product that gained wide acceptance was the no income, no job, no asset verification required (NINJA) mortgage. Informally, these loans were aptly referred to as "liar loans" because they encouraged borrowers to be less than honest in the loan application process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Uncontrolled Risk|last=Williams|first=Mark|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|date=April 12, 2010|isbn=978-0-07-163829-6|location=|pages=124|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Testimony given to the [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]] by Richard M. Bowen III on events during his tenure as the Business Chief Underwriter for Correspondent Lending in the Consumer Lending Group for [[Citigroup]] (where he was responsible for over 220 professional underwriters) suggests that by the final years of the US housing bubble (2006–2007), the collapse of [[mortgage underwriting]] standards was endemic. His testimony stated that by 2006, 60% of mortgages purchased by [[Citigroup|Citi]] from some 1,600 mortgage companies were "defective" (were not underwritten to policy, or did not contain all policy-required documents)—this, despite the fact that each of these 1,600 originators was contractually responsible (certified via representations and warrantees) that its mortgage originations met [[Citigroup|Citi's]] standards. Moreover, during 2007, "defective mortgages (from mortgage originators contractually bound to perform underwriting to [[Citigroup|Citi's]] standards) increased ... to over 80% of production".&lt;ref name="FCICBowenCitiTestimony"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hearing on Subprime Lending And Securitization And Government Sponsored Enterprises, April 7, 2010|url=http://www.fcic.gov/hearings/pdfs/2010-0407-Bowen.pdf|accessdate=October 29, 2010|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In separate testimony to Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, officers of Clayton Holdings—the largest residential loan due diligence and securitization surveillance company in the United States and Europe—testified that Clayton's review of over 900,000 mortgages issued from January 2006 to June 2007 revealed that scarcely 54% of the loans met their originators' underwriting standards. The analysis (conducted on behalf of 23 investment and commercial banks, including 7 "[[too big to fail]]" banks) additionally showed that 28% of the sampled loans did not meet the minimal standards of any issuer. Clayton's analysis further showed that 39% of these loans (i.e. those not meeting ''any'' issuer's minimal underwriting standards) were subsequently securitized and sold to investors.&lt;ref name="NewYorkTimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Raters Ignored Proof of Unsafe Loans, Panel Is Told|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/27/business/27ratings.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=October 28, 2010|work=The New York Times|first=Gretchen|last=Morgenson|date=September 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ClaytonTrendingReport"&gt;{{cite web|title=All Clayton Trending Reports 1st quarter 2006 – 2nd quarter 2007|url=http://www.fcic.gov/hearings/pdfs/2010-0923-Clayton-All-Trending-Report.pdf|accessdate=October 28, 2010|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is strong evidence that the GSEs—due to their large size and market power—were far more effective at policing underwriting by originators and forcing underwriters to repurchase defective loans. By contrast, private securitizers have been far less aggressive and less effective in recovering losses from originators on behalf of investors.&lt;ref name="ssrn" /&gt;

===Predatory lending===
Predatory lending refers to the practice of unscrupulous lenders, enticing borrowers to enter into "unsafe" or "unsound" secured loans for inappropriate purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://banking.senate.gov/docs/reports/predlend/occ.htm|title=Letter from the Comptroller of the Currency Regarding Predatory Lending|publisher=Banking.senate.gov|accessdate=November 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A classic [[bait-and-switch]] method was used by [[Countrywide Financial]], advertising low interest rates for home refinancing. Such loans were covered by very detailed contracts, and swapped for more expensive loan products on the day of closing. Whereas the advertisement might state that 1% or 1.5% interest would be charged, the consumer would be put into an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) in which the interest charged would be greater than the mortgage payments, creating [[negative amortization]] which the credit consumer might not notice until long after the loan transaction had been consummated.

Countrywide, sued by [[California Attorney General]] Jerry Brown for "unfair business practices" and "false advertising", was making high cost mortgages "to homeowners with weak credit, adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) that allowed homeowners to make interest-only payments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thinkdebtrelief.com/debt-relief-blog/money-news/bofa-modifies-64000-home-loans-as-part-of-predatory-lending-settlement/|title=BofA Modifies 64,000 Home Loans as Part of Predatory Lending Settlement &amp;#124; Debt Relief Blog|publisher=Thinkdebtrelief.com|date=May 25, 2009|accessdate=November 11, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024100929/http://thinkdebtrelief.com/debt-relief-blog/money-news/bofa-modifies-64000-home-loans-as-part-of-predatory-lending-settlement/|archivedate=October 24, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When housing prices decreased, homeowners in ARMs then had little incentive to pay their monthly payments, since their home equity had disappeared. This caused Countrywide's financial condition to deteriorate, ultimately resulting in a decision by the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]] to seize the lender.  One Countrywide employee—who would later plead guilty to two counts of [[wire fraud]] and spent 18 months in prison—stated that, "If you had a pulse, we gave you a loan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/29827248/ns/dateline_nbc-the_hansen_files_with_chris_hansen/t/if-you-had-pulse-we-gave-you-loan/#.WO5gY9IrLIU|title='If you had a pulse, we gave you a loan'|date=March 22, 2009|website=NBCNews.com|accessdate=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deregulation===
{{Further|Government policies and the subprime mortgage crisis}}
A 2012 OECD study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Systemically Important Banks and Capital Regulation Challenges|doi=10.1787/5kg0ps8cq8q6-en|journal=OECD Economics Department Working Papers}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that bank regulation based on the Basel accords encourage unconventional business practices and contributed to or even reinforced the financial crisis. In other cases, laws were changed or enforcement weakened in parts of the financial system. Key examples include:
* [[Jimmy Carter]]'s [[Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act]] of 1980 (DIDMCA) phased out a number of restrictions on banks' financial practices, broadened their lending powers, allowed [[credit union]]s and [[savings and loan]]s to offer [[checkable deposit]]s, and raised the [[deposit insurance]] limit from $40,000 to $100,000 (thereby potentially lessening depositor scrutiny of lenders' risk management policies).&lt;ref name="FDIC"&gt;Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, ''History of the Eighties – Lessons for the Future,'' Vol. 1. December 1997.http://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/history/3_85.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* In October 1982, US President Ronald Reagan signed into law the [[Garn–St. Germain Depository Institutions Act]], which provided for [[adjustable-rate mortgage]] loans, began the process of banking deregulation, and contributed to the [[savings and loan crisis]] of the late 1980s/early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leibold|first=Arthur | editor1-last = Barth | editor1-first = James R. | editor2-last = Trimbath | editor2-first = Susanne | editor3-last = Yago | editor3-first = Glenn|chapter=Some Hope for the Future After a Failed National Policy for Thrifts|title=The Savings and Loan Crisis: Lessons from a Regulatory Failure|publisher=[[Milken Institute]]|isbn=1-4020-7871-4|pages=58–59}} (further references: {{cite book|last1=Strunk|last2=Case|title=Where Deregulation Went Wrong: A Look at the Causes Behind the Savings and Loan Failures in the 1980s|publisher=U.S. League of Savings Institutions|pages=14–16|isbn=978-0-929097-32-9|year=1988}})&lt;/ref&gt;
* In November 1999, US President Bill Clinton signed into law the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]], which repealed provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act that prohibit a [[bank holding company]] from owning other financial companies.  The repeal effectively removed the separation that previously existed between Wall Street investment banks and depository banks, providing a government stamp of approval for a universal risk-taking banking model. Investment banks such as Lehman would now be thrust into direct competition with commercial banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Uncontrolled Risk|last=Williams|first=Mark|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|date=April 12, 2010|isbn=978-0-07-163829-6|location=|pages=44|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most analysts say that this repeal directly contributed to the severity of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010]].&lt;ref&gt;Corinne Crawford, "The repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act and the current financial crisis." ''Journal of Business &amp; Economics Research'' 9#1 (2011): 127+ [https://www.cluteinstitute.com/ojs/index.php/JBER/article/view/949 online]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is perspective that repeal made little difference because the institutions that were greatly affected did not fall under the jurisdiction of the act itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/05/21/reinstating-an-old-rule-is-not-a-cure-for-crisis/?ref=business|title=Reinstating an Old Rule Is Not a Cure for Crisis|author=Andrew Ross Sorkin|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In December 2000, President Clinton signed the Commodities Futures Modernization Act of 2000 into law. Written by Congress with lobbying assistance from the financial industry, it banned the further regulation of the derivatives market. 
* In 2004, the US [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] relaxed the [[net capital rule]], which enabled investment banks to substantially increase the level of debt they were taking on, fueling the growth in mortgage-backed securities supporting subprime mortgages. The SEC has conceded that self-regulation of investment banks contributed to the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/27/business/27sec.html?em|title=SEC Concedes Oversight Flaws|work=The New York Times|first=Stephen|last=Labaton|date=September 27, 2008|accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/business/03sec.html?em|title=The Reckoning|work=The New York Times|first=Stephen|last=Labaton|date=October 3, 2008|accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Financial institutions in the [[shadow banking system]] are not subject to the same regulation as depository banks, allowing them to assume additional debt obligations relative to their financial cushion or capital base.&lt;ref name="Krugman 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Krugman|first=Paul|year=2009|title=The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008|publisher=W.W.

* Regulators and accounting standard-setters allowed depository banks such as [[Citigroup]] to move significant amounts of assets and liabilities off-balance sheet into complex legal entities called [[structured investment vehicles]], masking the weakness of the capital base of the firm or degree of [[financial leverage|leverage]] or risk taken.

===Increased debt burden or overleveraging===
[[File:Leverage ratios for major investment banks.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Leverage ratios of investment banks increased significantly between 2003 and 2007.]]
Prior to the crisis, financial institutions became highly leveraged, increasing their appetite for risky investments and reducing their resilience in case of losses. Much of this leverage was achieved using complex financial instruments such as off-balance sheet securitization and derivatives, which made it difficult for creditors and regulators to monitor and try to reduce financial institution risk levels.&lt;ref name="papers.ssrn"&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1323190 "Secret Liens and the Financial Crisis of 2008"] American Bankruptcy Law Journal, Vol. 83, p. 253, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; These instruments also made it virtually impossible to reorganize financial institutions in bankruptcy, and contributed to the need for government bailouts.&lt;ref name="papers.ssrn" /&gt;

From 2004 to 2007, the top five US investment banks each significantly increased their financial leverage (see diagram), which increased their vulnerability to a financial shock. Changes in capital requirements, intended to keep US banks competitive with their European counterparts, allowed lower ''risk weightings'' for AAA securities. The shift from first-loss [[tranches]] to AAA tranches was seen by regulators as a risk reduction that compensated the higher leverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Unintended Consequences|author=Edward Conard|year=2012|publisher=Penguin|pages=145–155|isbn=978-1-4708-2357-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These five institutions reported over $4.1&amp;nbsp;trillion in debt for fiscal year 2007, about 30% of US nominal GDP for 2007.

These seven entities were highly leveraged and had $9&amp;nbsp;trillion in debt or guarantee obligations; yet they were not subject to the same regulation as depository banks.&lt;ref name="Krugman 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/02/opinion/02krugman.html NYT-Paul Krugman-Financial Reform 101 – April 2010].&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavior that may be optimal for an individual (e.g., saving more during adverse economic conditions) can be detrimental if too many individuals pursue the same behavior, as ultimately one person's consumption is another person's income. Too many consumers attempting to save (or pay down debt) simultaneously is called the [[paradox of thrift]] and can cause or deepen a recession. Economist [[Hyman Minsky]] also described a "paradox of deleveraging" as financial institutions that have too much leverage (debt relative to equity) cannot all de-leverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets.&lt;ref name="Yellen on Minsky" /&gt;

In April 2009, US Federal Reserve vice-chair [[Janet Yellen]] discussed these paradoxes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Once this massive credit crunch hit, it didn't take long before we were in a recession. The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this dynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms—and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state—nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole.&lt;ref name="Yellen on Minsky" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Financial innovation and complexity===
[[File:CDO - FCIC and IMF Diagram.png|thumb|upright=1.35|right|IMF Diagram of CDO and RMBS]]
The term [[financial innovation]] refers to the ongoing development of financial products designed to achieve particular client objectives, such as offsetting a particular risk exposure (such as the default of a borrower) or to assist with obtaining financing. Examples pertinent to this crisis included: the [[adjustable-rate mortgage]]; the bundling of subprime mortgages into [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] (MBS) or [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDO) for sale to investors, a type of [[securitization]]; and a form of credit insurance called credit default swaps (CDS). The usage of these products expanded dramatically in the years leading up to the crisis. These products vary in complexity and the ease with which they can be valued on the books of financial institutions.

CDO issuance grew from an estimated $20 billion in Q1 2004 to its peak of over $180 billion by Q1 2007, then declined back under $20 billion by Q1 2008. Further, the credit quality of CDO's declined from 2000 to 2007, as the level of subprime and other non-prime mortgage debt increased from 5% to 36% of CDO assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/m-rcbg/students/dunlop/2009-CDOmeltdown.pdf|title=2010 CDO Thesis|format=PDF|accessdate=April 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As described in the section on subprime lending, the CDS and portfolio of CDS called [[synthetic CDO]] enabled a theoretically infinite amount to be wagered on the finite value of housing loans outstanding, provided that buyers and sellers of the derivatives could be found. For example, buying a CDS to insure a CDO ended up giving the seller the same risk as if they owned the CDO, when those CDO's became worthless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Michael|year=2010|title=The Big Short|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=978-0-393-07223-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Complexity and the mortgage market - an example.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Diagram of CMLTI 2006 – NC2]]
This boom in innovative financial products went hand in hand with more complexity. It multiplied the number of actors connected to a single mortgage (including mortgage brokers, specialized originators, the securitizers and their due diligence firms, managing agents and trading desks, and finally investors, insurances and providers of repo funding). With increasing distance from the underlying asset these actors relied more and more on indirect information (including FICO scores on creditworthiness, appraisals and due diligence checks by third party organizations, and most importantly the computer models of rating agencies and risk management desks). Instead of spreading risk this provided the ground for fraudulent acts, misjudgments and finally market collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fcic.law.stanford.edu/resource/staff-data-projects/story-of-a-security|title=Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission – story of a security|accessdate=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Wolf]] further wrote in June 2009 that certain financial innovations enabled firms to circumvent regulations, such as off-balance sheet financing that affects the leverage or capital cushion reported by major banks, stating: "... an enormous part of what banks did in the early part of this decade—the off-balance-sheet vehicles, the derivatives and the 'shadow banking system' itself—was to find a way round regulation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/095722f6-6028-11de-a09b-00144feabdc0.html|title=FT Martin Wolf – Reform of Regulation and Incentives|work=Financial Times|date=June 23, 2009|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incorrect pricing of risk===
[[File:AIG Protester on Pine Street.jpg|thumb|A protester on [[Wall Street]] in the wake of the [[AIG bonus payments controversy]] is interviewed by news media.]]

Mortgage risks were underestimated by almost all institutions in the chain from originator to investor by underweighting the possibility of falling housing prices based on historical trends of the past 50 years. Limitations of default and prepayment models, the heart of pricing models, led to overvaluation of mortgage and asset-backed products and their derivatives by originators, securitizers, broker-dealers, rating-agencies, insurance underwriters and the vast majority of investors (with the exception of certain hedge funds).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Reckless Optimism|last=Samuelson|first=Robert J.|journal=Claremont Review of Books|volume=XII|issue=1|year=2011|page=13|url=http://www.claremont.org/publications/crb/id.1916/article_detail.asp|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224113222/http://www.claremont.org/publications/crb/id.1916/article_detail.asp|archivedate=December 24, 2013|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kourlas&gt;{{cite web|last=Kourlas|first=James|title=Lessons Not Learned From the Housing Crisis|url=http://www.atlassociety.org/brc/lessons-housing-crisis|date=April 12, 2012|publisher=The Atlas Society|accessdate=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While financial derivatives and structured products helped partition and shift risk between financial participants, it was the underestimation of falling housing prices and the resultant losses that led to aggregate risk.&lt;ref name=kourlas/&gt;

The pricing of risk refers to the [[Risk premium|incremental compensation]] required by investors for taking on additional risk, which may be measured by interest rates or fees. Several scholars have argued that a lack of transparency about banks' risk exposures prevented markets from correctly pricing risk before the crisis, enabled the mortgage market to grow larger than it otherwise would have, and made the financial crisis far more disruptive than it would have been if risk levels had been disclosed in a straightforward, readily understandable format.&lt;ref name="ssrn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="papers.ssrn" /&gt;

For a variety of reasons, market participants did not accurately measure the risk inherent with financial innovation such as MBS and CDOs or understand its effect on the overall stability of the financial system.&lt;ref name="Declaration of G20" /&gt; For example, the pricing model for CDOs clearly did not reflect the level of risk they introduced into the system. Banks estimated that $450 billion of CDO were sold between "late 2005 to the middle of 2007"; among the $102 billion of those that had been liquidated, JPMorgan estimated that the average recovery rate for "high quality" CDOs was approximately 32&amp;nbsp;cents on the dollar, while the recovery rate for [[mezzanine capital|mezzanine]] CDO was approximately five cents for every dollar.&lt;ref name="TPMBLOG1"&gt;{{cite web|date=March 2, 2009|url=http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/talk/blogs/paulw/2009/03/the-power-of-belief.php|title=paulw's Blog &amp;#124; Talking Points Memo &amp;#124; The power of belief|publisher=Tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com|accessdate=November 11, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406005046/http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/talk/blogs/paulw/2009/03/the-power-of-belief.php|archivedate=April 6, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example relates to [[AIG]], which insured obligations of various financial institutions through the usage of credit default swaps. The basic CDS transaction involved AIG receiving a premium in exchange for a promise to pay money to party A in the event party B defaulted. However, AIG did not have the financial strength to support its many CDS commitments as the crisis progressed and was taken over by the government in September 2008. US taxpayers provided over $180&amp;nbsp;billion in government support to AIG during 2008 and early 2009, through which the money flowed to various counterparties to CDS transactions, including many large global financial institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;sid=aKKRHZsxRvWs&amp;refer=home|title=Bloomberg-Credit Swap Disclosure Obscures True Financial Risk|publisher=Bloomberg|date=November 6, 2008|accessdate=February 27, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68F8QZzuT?url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aKKRHZsxRvWs&amp;refer=home|archivedate=June 7, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrnes|first=Nanette|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/mar2009/db20090316_859460.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index+-+temp_top+story|title=Business Week-Who's Who on AIG List of Counterparties|work=BusinessWeek|date=March 17, 2009|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]] (FCIC) made the major government study of the crisis. It concluded in January 2011:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Commission concludes AIG failed and was rescued by the government primarily because its enormous sales of credit default swaps were made without putting up the initial collateral, setting aside capital reserves, or hedging its exposure—a profound failure in corporate governance, particularly its risk management practices.  AIG's failure was possible because of the sweeping deregulation of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, including credit default swaps, which effectively eliminated federal and state regulation of these products, including capital and margin requirements that would have lessened the likelihood of AIG's failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Phil Angelides|title=Financial Crisis Inquiry Report|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QIKfTVrhNfMC&amp;pg=PA352|year=2011|publisher=DIANE Publishing|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerry M.

The limitations of a widely used financial model also were not properly understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Regnier|first=Pat|url=http://moneyfeatures.blogs.money.cnn.com/2009/02/27/the-financial-crisis-why-did-it-happen/|title=New theories attempt to explain the financial crisis – Personal Finance blog – Money Magazine's More Money|publisher=Moneyfeatures.blogs.money.cnn.com|date=February 27, 2009|accessdate=November 11, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304024927/http://moneyfeatures.blogs.money.cnn.com/2009/02/27/the-financial-crisis-why-did-it-happen/|archivedate=March 4, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Felix1"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Salmon|first=Felix | publication-date = February 23, 2009|title=Recipe for Disaster: The Formula That Killed Wall Street|magazine=[[Wired.com]]|issue=17.03|url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/magazine/17-03/wp_quant|accessdate=March 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This formula assumed that the price of CDS was correlated with and could predict the correct price of mortgage-backed securities.

Moreover, a conflict of interest between [[Investment management|professional investment managers]] and their [[Institutional investor|institutional clients]], combined with a global glut in investment capital, led to bad investments by asset managers in over-priced credit assets. Professional investment managers generally are compensated based on the volume of client [[assets under management]]. There is, therefore, an incentive for asset managers to expand their assets under management in order to maximize their compensation. As the glut in global investment capital caused the yields on credit assets to decline, asset managers were faced with the choice of either investing in assets where returns did not reflect true credit risk or returning funds to clients. Many asset managers continued to invest client funds in over-priced (under-yielding) investments, to the detriment of their clients, so they could maintain their assets under management. They supported this choice with a "plausible deniability" of the risks associated with subprime-based credit assets because the loss experience with early "vintages" of subprime loans was so low.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calomiris|first=Charles|title=The Subprime Turmoil: What's Old, What's New, and What's Next|journal=Journal of Structured Finance|volume=15|issue=1|pages=6–52|publisher=Institutional Investor Journals|date=Spring 2009|url=http://www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/sympos/2008/Calomiris.03.12.09.pdf|doi=10.3905/JSF.2009.15.1.006|accessdate=August 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boom and collapse of the shadow banking system===
[[File:Securitization Market Activity.png|thumb|upright=1.6|right|Securitization markets were impaired during the crisis]]
There is strong evidence that the riskiest, worst performing mortgages were funded through the "shadow banking system" and that competition from the shadow banking system may have pressured more traditional institutions to lower their own underwriting standards and originate riskier loans.&lt;ref name="ssrn" /&gt;

In a June 2008 speech, President and CEO of the New York Federal Reserve Bank [[Timothy Geithner]]—who in 2009 became Secretary of the United States Treasury—placed significant blame for the freezing of credit markets on a "run" on the entities in the "parallel" banking system, also called the [[shadow banking system]]. These entities became critical to the credit markets underpinning the financial system, but were not subject to the same regulatory controls. Further, these entities were vulnerable because of [[asset liability mismatch|maturity mismatch]], meaning that they borrowed short-term in liquid markets to purchase long-term, illiquid and risky assets. This meant that disruptions in credit markets would make them subject to rapid deleveraging, selling their long-term assets at depressed prices. He described the significance of these entities:

{{quote|In early 2007, asset-backed commercial paper conduits, in structured investment vehicles, in auction-rate preferred securities, tender option bonds and variable rate demand notes, had a combined asset size of roughly $2.2&amp;nbsp;trillion. Assets financed overnight in triparty repo grew to $2.5&amp;nbsp;trillion. Assets held in hedge funds grew to roughly $1.8&amp;nbsp;trillion. The combined balance sheets of the five largest investment banks totaled $4&amp;nbsp;trillion. In comparison, the total assets of the top five bank holding companies in the United States at that point were just over $6&amp;nbsp;trillion, and total assets of the entire banking system were about $10&amp;nbsp;trillion. The combined effect of these factors was a financial system vulnerable to self-reinforcing asset price and credit cycles.&lt;ref name="newyorkfed.org" /&gt;}}

[[Paul Krugman]], laureate of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize in Economics]], described the run on the shadow banking system as the "core of what happened" to cause the crisis. He referred to this lack of controls as "malign neglect" and argued that regulation should have been imposed on all banking-like activity.&lt;ref name="Krugman 2009" /&gt;

The securitization markets supported by the shadow banking system started to close down in the spring of 2007 and nearly shut-down in the fall of 2008. More than a third of the private credit markets thus became unavailable as a source of funds.&lt;ref name="Search Site"&gt;{{cite web|author=Search Site|url=http://www.city-journal.org/2009/19_1_credit.html|title=Nicole Gelinas-Can the Fed's Uncrunch Credit?|publisher=City-journal.org|accessdate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Brookings Institution]], the traditional banking system does not have the capital to close this gap as of June 2009: "It would take a number of years of strong profits to generate sufficient capital to support that additional lending volume." The authors also indicate that some forms of securitization are "likely to vanish forever, having been an artifact of excessively loose credit conditions."&lt;ref name="brookings.edu"&gt;{{cite web|author= — |url=http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2009/0615_economic_crisis_baily_elliott.aspx|title=Brookings Institution – U.S. Financial and Economic Crisis June 2009 PDF Page 14|publisher=Brookings.edu|date=June 15, 2009|accessdate=January 2, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603093153/http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2009/0615_economic_crisis_baily_elliott.aspx|archivedate=June 3, 2010|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commodities boom===
{{Main|2000s commodities boom}}

Rapid increases in a number of commodity prices followed the collapse in the housing bubble. The price of oil nearly tripled from $50 to $147 from early 2007 to 2008, before plunging as the financial crisis began to take hold in late 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://futures.tradingcharts.com/chart/CO/M|title=Light Crude Oil Chart|publisher=Futures.tradingcharts.com|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts debate the causes, with some attributing it to speculative flow of money from housing and other investments into commodities, some to monetary policy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Conway|first=Edmund|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/2790539/George-Soros-rocketing-oil-price-is-a-bubble.html|title=Soros – Rocketing Oil Price is a Bubble|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=May 26, 2008|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some to the increasing feeling of raw materials scarcity in a fast-growing world, leading to long positions taken on those markets, such as Chinese increasing presence in Africa. An increase in oil prices tends to divert a larger share of consumer spending into gasoline, which creates downward pressure on economic growth in oil importing countries, as wealth flows to oil-producing states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/story/2999|title=The Oil Price Bubble|publisher=Mises.org|date=June 2, 2008|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pattern of spiking instability in the price of oil over the decade leading up to the price high of 2008 has been recently identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energybulletin.net/node/50923|title=Tom Therramus, (editor, Gail the Actuary) – Was Volatility in the Price of Oil a Cause of the 2008 Financial Crisis?|publisher=Energybulletin.net|date=December 8, 2009|accessdate=January 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The destabilizing effects of this price variance has been proposed as a contributory factor in the financial crisis.

[[File:Copper Price History USD.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Global copper prices]]

Copper prices increased at the same time as oil prices. Copper traded at about $2,500 per ton from 1990 until 1999, when it fell to about $1,600. The price slump lasted until 2004, when a price surge pushed copper to $7,040 per ton in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dow-futures.net/historical-copper-prices-history/ |title=Historical Copper Prices, Copper Prices History |publisher=Dow-futures.net |date=January 22, 2007 |accessdate=May 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512134725/http://dow-futures.net/historical-copper-prices-history |archivedate=May 12, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nickel prices boomed in the late 1990s, then declined from around $51,000 /£36,700 per metric ton in May 2007 to about $11,550/£8,300 per metric ton in January 2009. Prices were only just starting to recover as of January 2010, but most of Australia's nickel mines had gone bankrupt by then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7841417.stm|title=Business &amp;#124; Miner BHP to lay off 6,000 staff|publisher=BBC News|date=January 21, 2009|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the price for high grade [[nickel sulphate]] ore recovered in 2010, so did the Australian nickel mining industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proactiveinvestors.com.au/companies/news/5032/mincors-result-reflects-a-return-to-better-days-for-sulphide-nickel-5032.html |title=(AU) – Mincor's result reflects a return to better days for sulphide nickel |publisher=Proactive Investors |date=February 18, 2010 |accessdate=May 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706111508/http://www.proactiveinvestors.com.au/companies/news/5032/mincors-result-reflects-a-return-to-better-days-for-sulphide-nickel-5032.html |archivedate=July 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coincidentally with these price fluctuations, long-only commodity index funds became popular—by one estimate investment increased from $90&amp;nbsp;billion in 2006 to $200&amp;nbsp;billion at the end of 2007, while commodity prices increased 71% – which raised concern as to whether these index funds caused the commodity bubble.&lt;ref name=IrwinSanders2010 /&gt; The empirical research has been mixed.&lt;ref name=IrwinSanders2010&gt;Irwin SH, Sanders DR.

OECD Working Paper. {{DOI|10.1787/5kmd40wl1t5f-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systemic crisis===
Another analysis is that the financial crisis was merely a symptom of another, deeper crisis, which is a systemic crisis of capitalism itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McMurty|first=John|year=1999|title=The Cancer Stage of Capitalism|isbn=0-7453-1347-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ravi Batra]]'s theory is that growing inequality of [[financial capitalism]] produces speculative bubbles that burst and result in depression and major [[The Downfall of Capitalism and Communism|political changes]]. He has also suggested that a "demand gap" related to differing wage and productivity growth explains deficit and debt dynamics important to stock market developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Batra|first=Ravi|url=http://www.truthout.org/weapons-mass-exploitation/1304696645|title=Weapons of Mass Exploitation?|publisher=Truthout.org|date=May 8, 2011|accessdate=June 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Bellamy Foster]], a political economy analyst and editor of the ''[[Monthly Review]]'', believes that the decrease in GDP growth rates since the early 1970s is due to increasing [[market saturation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monthlyreview.org/080401foster.php|title=The Financialization of Capital and the Crisis|publisher=Monthly Review|accessdate=November 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conventional Marxist explanation of capitalist crises was pointed to by economists [[Andrew Kliman]], Michael Roberts, and Guglielmo Carchedi, in contradistinction to the Monthly Review school represented by Foster. These Marxist economists do not point to low wages or underconsumption as the cause of the crisis, but instead point to capitalism's long-term tendency of the [[rate of profit]] to fall as the underlying cause of crises generally. From this point of view, the problem was the inability of capital to grow or accumulate at sufficient rates through productive investment alone. Low rates of profit in productive sectors led to speculative investment in riskier assets, where there was potential for greater return on investment. The speculative frenzy of the late 90s and 2000s was, in this view, a consequence of a rising organic composition of capital, expressed through the fall in the rate of profit. According to Michael Roberts, the fall in the rate of profit "eventually triggered the credit crunch of 2007 when credit could no longer support profits".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Michael|url=https://thenextrecession.wordpress.com/2011/07/03/carchedi-foster-and-the-causes-of-crisis/|title=Carchedi, Foster, and the causes of crisis|accessdate=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[John C. Bogle]] wrote that a series of challenges face capitalism that have contributed to past financial crises and have not been sufficiently addressed:

{{quote|Corporate America went astray largely because the power of managers went virtually unchecked by our gatekeepers for far too long ... . They failed to 'keep an eye on these geniuses' to whom they had entrusted the responsibility of the management of America's great corporations.}}

Echoing the central thesis of [[James Burnham]]'s 1941 seminal book, ''[[James Burnham#The Managerial Revolution|The Managerial Revolution]]'', Bogle cites particular issues, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bogle|first=John|year=2005|title=The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-11971-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* that "Manager's capitalism" has replaced "owner's capitalism", meaning management runs the firm for its benefit rather than for the shareholders, a variation on the [[principal–agent problem]];
* the burgeoning executive compensation;
* the management of earnings, mainly a focus on share price rather than the creation of genuine value; and
* the failure of gatekeepers, including auditors, boards of directors, Wall Street analysts, and career politicians.

An analysis conducted by [[Mark Roeder]], a former executive at the Swiss-based [[UBS]] Bank, suggested that large-scale momentum, or [[The Big Mo]] "played a pivotal role" in the 2008–09 global financial crisis. Roeder suggested that "recent technological advances, such as computer-driven trading programs, together with the increasingly interconnected nature of markets, has magnified the momentum effect. This has made the financial sector inherently unstable."&lt;ref&gt;The Big Mo: Why Momentum Now Rules Our World, by Mark Roeder. Virgin Books. 2011. {{ISBN|0-7535-3937-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Reich]] attributes the current economic downturn to the stagnation of wages in the United States, particularly those of the hourly workers who comprise 80% of the workforce. He says this stagnation forced the population to borrow to meet the cost of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robertreich.blogspot.com/2008/07/heart-of-economic-mess.html|last=Reich|first=Robert|date=July 25, 2008|title=The Heart of the Economic Mess|accessdate=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists [[Ailsa McKay]] and [[Margunn Bjørnholt]] argue that the financial crisis and the response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream economics and within the economics profession, and call for a reshaping of both the economy, economic theory and the economics profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bjørnholt|first1=Margunn|author1-link=Margunn Bjørnholt|last2=McKay|first2=Ailsa|author2-link=Ailsa McKay|editor1-last=Bjørnholt|editor1-first =Margunn|editor1-link=Margunn Bjørnholt|editor2-last=McKay|editor2-first =Ailsa|editor2-link=Ailsa McKay|title=Counting on Marilyn Waring: New Advances in Feminist Economics|url=http://www.margunnbjornholt.no/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Advances-in-Feminist-Economics-in-Times-of-Economic-Crisis.pdf|year=2014|format=PDF|publisher=[[Demeter Press]]|pages=7–20|chapter=Advances in Feminist Economics in Times of Economic Crisis|isbn=978-1-927335-27-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of economic forecasting===
The financial crisis was not widely predicted by [[mainstream economics|mainstream economists]]. 

A cover story in ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' magazine claims that economists mostly failed to predict the worst international economic crisis since the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coy|first=Peter|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_17/b4128026997269.htm?chan=top+news_economics+subindex+page_economics|title=Businessweek Magazine|work=BusinessWeek|date=April 16, 2009|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]]'s online business journal examines why economists failed to predict a major global financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm;jsessionid=a830ee2a1f18c5f62020347bf11442669617?articleid=2234 |title=Why Economists Failed to Predict the Financial Crisis |publisher=Knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu |accessdate=November 11, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100913044548/http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm%3Bjsessionid%3Da830ee2a1f18c5f62020347bf11442669617?articleid=2234 |archivedate=September 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular articles published in the mass media have led the general public to believe that the majority of economists have failed in their obligation to predict the financial crisis. For example, an article in the New York Times informs that economist [[Nouriel Roubini]] warned of such crisis as early as September 2006, and the article goes on to state that the profession of economics is bad at predicting recessions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/17/magazine/17pessimist-t.html?pagewanted=all "Dr. Doom"], By Stephen Mihm, August 15, 2008, New York Times Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', Roubini was ridiculed for predicting a collapse of the housing market and worldwide recession, while ''The New York Times'' labelled him "Dr. Doom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jan/24/nouriel-roubini-credit-crunch|first=Emma|last=Brockes|title=He Told Us So|work=The Guardian|date=January 24, 2009|accessdate=May 1, 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within mainstream [[financial economics]], most believe that financial crises are simply unpredictable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://modeledbehavior.com/2009/09/11/john-cochrane-responds-to-paul-krugman-full-text/|title=John Cochrane's Response to Paul Krugman: Full Text " Modeled Behavior|publisher=Modeledbehavior.com|date=September 11, 2009|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; following Eugene Fama's [[efficient-market hypothesis]] and the related [[random walk hypothesis|random-walk hypothesis]], which state respectively that markets contain all information about possible future movements, and that the movements of financial prices are random and unpredictable. Recent research casts doubt on the accuracy of "early warning" systems of potential crises, which must also predict their timing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/papers/2009/wp09-17bk.pdf ''Cross-Country Causes and Consequences of the 2008 Crisis: Early Warning''], Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Austrian school|Austrian economic school]] regarded the crisis as a vindication and classic example of a predictable credit-fueled bubble caused by laxity in monetary supply.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/journals/qjae/pdf/qjae13_1_1.pdf Austrian Business Cycle Theory and the Global Financial Crisis:: Confessions of a Mainstream Economist] by Jerry Tempelman&lt;/ref&gt;

The former Governor of the [[Reserve Bank of India]], [[Raghuram Rajan]], had predicted the crisis in 2005 when he became chief economist at the [[International Monetary Fund]]. In 2005, at a celebration honoring [[Alan Greenspan]], who was about to retire as chairman of the [[US Federal Reserve]], Rajan delivered a controversial paper that was critical of the financial sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Raghuram |last=Rajan |title=Has Financial Development Made the World Riskier? |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 11728 |date=November 2005 |doi=10.3386/w11728 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In that paper, Rajan "argued that disaster might loom."&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;Justin Lahart.

Retrieved on August 18, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Rajan argued that financial sector managers were encouraged to "take risks that generate severe adverse consequences with small probability but, in return, offer generous compensation the rest of the time. These risks are known as tail risks. But perhaps the most important concern is whether banks will be able to provide liquidity to financial markets so that if the tail risk does materialize, financial positions can be unwound and losses allocated so that the consequences to the real economy are minimized."

Stock trader and financial risk engineer [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]], author of the 2007 book ''[[The Black Swan (Taleb book)|The Black Swan]]'', spent years warning against the breakdown of the banking system in particular and the economy in general owing to their use of and reliance on bad risk models and reliance on forecasting, and framed the problem as part of "robustness and fragility".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/pablo-triana/why-nassim-taleb-is-the-t_b_263194.html|title=Pablo Triana: Why Nassim Taleb is the True Predictor of this Crisis|work=Huffington Post|date=August 19, 2009|accessdate=January 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/imbeciles.htm|title=The Black Swan: Quotes &amp; Warnings that the Imbeciles Chose to Ignore|publisher=fooledbyrandomness.com|date=April 2007|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also took action against the establishment view by making a big financial bet on banking stocks and making a fortune from the crisis ("They didn't listen, so I took their money").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/magazine/04risk-t.html|work=The New York Times|first=Joe|last=Nocera|title=Risk Mismanagement|date=January 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to David Brooks from the New York Times, "Taleb not only has an explanation for what's happening, he saw it coming."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/opinion/28brooks.html|work=The New York Times|first=David|last=Brooks|title=The Behavioral Revolution|date=October 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wrong banking model?===
A report by the [[International Labour Organization]] concluded that [[cooperative banking|cooperative financial institutions]] were less likely to fail than their competitors during the crisis. The cooperative banking sector had 20% market share of the European banking sector, but accounted for only 7 per cent of all the write-downs and losses between the third quarter of 2007 and first quarter of 2011&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/---emp_ent/---coop/documents/publication/wcms_207768.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Impact on financial markets==
===US stock market===
{{Main|United States bear market of 2007–2009}}
The US stock market peaked in October 2007, when the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] index exceeded 14,000 points. It then entered a pronounced decline, which accelerated markedly in October 2008. By March 2009, the Dow Jones average had reached a trough of around 6,600. Four years later,
it hit an all-time high. It is probable, but debated, that the Federal Reserve's aggressive policy of [[quantitative easing]] spurred the partial recovery in the stock market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ciovaccocapital.com/wordpress/index.php/fed-policy/quantitative-easing-and-asset-price-inflation/|title=Quantitative Easing and Asset Price Inflation|publisher=Ciovacco Capital Management|date=October 29, 2010|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtpredictor.us/1061/impact-of-quantitative-easing-on-the-stock-market/ |title=Impact of Quantitative Easing on the Stock Market |publisher=Mtpredictor.us |date=February 6, 2011 |accessdate=May 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426062032/http://www.mtpredictor.us/1061/impact-of-quantitative-easing-on-the-stock-market/ |archivedate=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brighthub.com/money/investing/articles/111875.aspx|title=The Effects of Manipulating Money Supply on Equities|first=Steve|last=McFarlane|publisher=Brighthub.com|date=May 20, 2011|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Market strategist Phil Dow believes distinctions exist "between the current market malaise" and the Great Depression. He says the Dow Jones average's fall of more than 50% over a period of 17 months is similar to a 54.7% fall in the Great Depression, followed by a total drop of 89% over the following 16 months. "It's very troubling if you have a mirror image," said Dow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kawamoto|first=Dawn|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-10185559-92.html|title=Dow Jones decline rate mimics Great Depression &amp;#124; Business Tech – CNET News|publisher=News.cnet.com|date=March 2, 2009|accessdate=January 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Floyd Norris]], the chief financial correspondent of ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote in a blog entry in March 2009 that the decline has not been a mirror image of the Great Depression, explaining that although the decline amounts were nearly the same at the time, the rates of decline had started much faster in 2007, and that the past year had only ranked eighth among the worst recorded years of percentage drops in the Dow.

The first notable event signaling a possible financial crisis occurred in the United Kingdom on August 9, 2007, when [[BNP Paribas]], citing "a complete evaporation of liquidity", blocked withdrawals from three hedge funds. The significance of this event was not immediately recognized but soon led to a panic as investors and savers attempted to liquidate assets deposited in highly leveraged financial institutions.&lt;ref name=G8512&gt;{{cite news|title=Three myths that sustain the economic crisis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2012/aug/05/economic-crisis-myths-sustain|accessdate=August 6, 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=August 5, 2012|author=Larry Elliott, economics editor of ''The Guardian''|format=blog by expert|quote=Five years ago the banks stopped lending to each other.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Monetary Fund estimated that large US and European banks lost more than $1&amp;nbsp;trillion on toxic assets and from bad loans from January 2007 to September 2009. These losses are expected to top $2.8&amp;nbsp;trillion from 2007 to 2010. US bank losses were forecast to hit $1&amp;nbsp;trillion and European bank losses will reach $1.6&amp;nbsp;trillion. The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) estimated in 2009 that US banks were about 60% through their losses, but British and eurozone banks only 40%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idCNL554155620091105?rpc=44|title=Bloomberg-U.S. European Bank Writedowns &amp; Losses-November&amp;nbsp;5, 2009|agency=Reuters|date=November 5, 2009|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calls by Liberal Democrat Treasury Spokesman [[Vincent Cable|Vince Cable]] to [[nationalised|nationalise]] the institution were initially ignored; in February 2008, however, the [[British government]] (having failed to find a private sector buyer) relented, and the bank was taken into public hands.

==IndyMac==
The first visible institution to run into trouble in the United States was the Southern California–based [[IndyMac]], a spin-off of [[Countrywide Financial]].

In 1997, Countrywide spun off IndyMac as an independent company run by Mike Perry, who remained its CEO until the downfall of the bank in July 2008.&lt;ref name="Paletta"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121581435073947103 |title=Crisis Deepens as Big Bank Fails: IndyMac Seized In Largest Bust In Two Decades|first=Damian|last=Paletta|author2=Enrich, David|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=July 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary causes of its failure were largely associated with its business strategy of originating and securitizing [[Alt-A]] loans on a large scale. This strategy resulted in rapid growth and a high concentration of risky assets. From its inception as a savings association in 2000, IndyMac grew to the seventh largest savings and loan and ninth largest originator of mortgage loans in the United States. During 2006, IndyMac originated over $90 billion of mortgages.

IndyMac's aggressive growth strategy, use of Alt-A and other nontraditional loan products, insufficient underwriting, credit concentrations in residential real estate in the [[California]] and [[Florida]] markets—states, alongside Nevada and Arizona, where the [[United States housing bubble|housing bubble]] was most pronounced—and heavy reliance on costly funds borrowed from a [[Federal Home Loan Bank]] (FHLB) and from brokered deposits, led to its demise when the mortgage market declined in 2007.

IndyMac often made loans without verification of the borrower's income or assets, and to borrowers with poor credit histories. Appraisals obtained by IndyMac on underlying collateral were often questionable as well. As an Alt-A lender, IndyMac's business model was to offer loan products to fit the borrower's needs, using an extensive array of risky option-[[Adjustable-rate mortgage|adjustable-rate-mortgages]] (option ARMs), subprime loans, 80/20 loans, and other nontraditional products. Ultimately, loans were made to many borrowers who simply could not afford to make their payments. The thrift remained profitable only as long as it was able to sell those loans in the [[secondary mortgage market]].  IndyMac resisted efforts to regulate its involvement in those loans or tighten their issuing criteria: see the comment by Ruthann Melbourne, Chief Risk Officer, to the regulating agencies.&lt;ref name="ustreas.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ustreas.gov/inspector-general/audit-reports/2009/oig09032.pdf|title=Audit Report - SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS: Material Loss Review of IndyMac Bank, FSB|accessdate=March 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419101451/http://www.ustreas.gov/inspector-general/audit-reports/2009/oig09032.pdf|archivedate=April 19, 2009}} Audit Report Office of Inspector General&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fdic.gov/news/news/press/2009/pr09001.html|title=FDIC: Press Releases - PR-1-2009 1/2/2009|website=www.fdic.gov|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.ots.treas.gov/comments/20478116-56b7-4810-938b-60b7688f9652.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216201626/http://files.ots.treas.gov/comments/20478116-56b7-4810-938b-60b7688f9652.pdf |archivedate=February 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

May 12, 2008, in a small note in the "Capital" section of its what would become its last [[10-Q]] released before receivership, IndyMac revealed—but did not admit—that it was no longer a well-capitalized institution and that it was headed for insolvency.

IndyMac reported that during April 2008, [[Moody's]] and [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] downgraded the ratings on a significant number of [[Mortgage-backed security]] (MBS) bonds—including $160 million issued by IndyMac that the bank retained in its MBS portfolio. IndyMac concluded that these downgrades would have harmed the Company's risk-based capital ratio as of June 30, 2008. Had these lowered ratings been in effect at March 31, 2008, IndyMac concluded that the bank's capital ratio would have been 9.27% total risk-based. IndyMac warned that if its regulators found its capital position to have fallen below "well capitalized" (minimum 10% risk-based capital ratio) to "adequately capitalized" (8–10% risk-based capital ratio) the bank might no longer be able to use brokered deposits as a source of funds.

Senator [[Charles Schumer]] (D-NY) later pointed out that brokered deposits made up more than 37 percent of IndyMac's total deposits, and ask the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) whether it had considered ordering IndyMac to reduce its reliance on these deposits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080701/indymac_schumer.html?.v=2 "IndyMac Reassures Customers After Schumer Letter"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080711151417/http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080701/indymac_schumer.html?.v=2 |date=July 11, 2008 }}, AP&lt;/ref&gt; With $18.9 billion in total deposits reported on March 31,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secinfo.com/dVut2.t668.htm#svit|title=SEC Info - Indymac Bancorp Inc - '10-Q' for 3/31/08|website=www.secinfo.com|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator Schumer would have been referring to a little over $7 billion in brokered deposits. While the breakout of maturities of these deposits is not known exactly, a simple averaging would have put the threat of brokered deposits loss to IndyMac at $500 million a month, had the regulator disallowed IndyMac from acquiring new brokered deposits on June 30.

IndyMac was taking new measures to preserve capital, such as deferring interest payments on some preferred securities. Dividends on common shares had already been suspended for the first quarter of 2008, after being cut in half the previous quarter. The company still had not secured a significant capital infusion nor found a ready buyer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theimbreport.com/ "To-date, we have not been successful with these efforts...."] Company Blog&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestreet.com/story/10416473/1/indymac-seeks-to-preserve-capital.html "Indymac Seeks to Preserve Capital"], ''The Street''&lt;/ref&gt;

IndyMac reported that the bank's risk-based capital was only $47 million above the minimum required for this 10% mark. But it did not reveal some of that $47 million capital it claimed it had, as of March 31, 2008, was fabricated.

When home prices declined in the latter half of 2007 and the secondary mortgage market collapsed, IndyMac was forced to hold $10.7 billion of loans it could not sell in the secondary market. Its reduced liquidity was further exacerbated in late June 2008 when account holders withdrew $1.55 billion or about 7.5% of IndyMac's deposits.&lt;ref name="secinfo.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secinfo.com/dVut2.t668.htm#t7ow|title=SEC Info - Indymac Bancorp Inc - '10-Q' for 3/31/08|website=www.secinfo.com|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[bank run|"run"]] on the thrift followed the public release of a letter from Senator Charles Schumer to the FDIC and OTS. The letter outlined the Senator's concerns with IndyMac. While the run was a contributing factor in the timing of IndyMac's demise, the underlying cause of the failure was the unsafe and unsound way they operated the thrift.&lt;ref name="ustreas.gov" /&gt;

On June 26, 2008, Senator [[Charles Schumer]] (D-NY), a member of the [[Senate Banking Committee]], chairman of Congress' [[Joint Economic Committee]] and the third-ranking Democrat in the Senate,&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2008/07/13/news/companies/schumer_indymac/index.htm "Schumer says he's not to blame for IndyMac"], CNN, July 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; released several letters he had sent to regulators, which warned  that, "The possible collapse of big mortgage lender IndyMac Bancorp Inc. poses significant financial risks to its borrowers and depositors, and regulators may not be ready to intervene to protect them." Some worried depositors began to withdraw money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080626/indymac_schumer.html?.v%3D2|title=Schumer: concern over IndyMac stability|last=|first=|date=June 26, 2008|work=|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|via=|accessdate=July 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 7, 2008, IndyMac announced on the company blog that it:
* Had failed to raise [[Capital (economics)|capital]] since its May 12, 2008 quarterly earnings report;
* Had been notified by bank and thrift regulators that IndyMac Bank was no longer deemed "well-capitalized";
IndyMac announced the closure of both its retail lending and wholesale divisions, halted new loan submissions, and cut 3,800 jobs.&lt;ref name="nyt1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Veiga|first1=Alex|title=IndyMac stops new mortgage loans, to cut workforce by half – The Mercury News|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2008/07/07/indymac-stops-new-mortgage-loans-to-cut-workforce-by-half/|accessdate=November 26, 2016|work=Mercury News|agency=Associated Press|date=July 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 11, 2008, citing liquidity concerns, the FDIC put IndyMac Bank into [[conservatorship]]. A [[bridge bank (United States)|bridge bank]], IndyMac Federal Bank, FSB, was established to assume control of IndyMac Bank's assets, its secured liabilities, and its insured deposit accounts. The FDIC announced plans to open IndyMac Federal Bank, FSB on July 14, 2008.

With $32 billion in assets, IndyMac Bank was one of the largest bank failures in American history.

IndyMac Bancorp filed for [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7 bankruptcy]] on July 31, 2008.&lt;ref name="LaCapra" /&gt;

Initially the companies affected were those directly involved in home construction and mortgage lending such as Northern Rock and [[Countrywide Financial]], as they could no longer obtain financing through the credit markets. Over 100 mortgage lenders went bankrupt during 2007 and 2008. Concerns that investment bank [[Bear Stearns]] would collapse in March 2008 resulted in its fire-sale to [[JP Morgan Chase]]. The financial institution crisis hit its peak in September and October 2008. Several major institutions either failed, were acquired under duress, or were subject to government takeover. These included [[Lehman Brothers]], [[Merrill Lynch]], Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, [[Washington Mutual]], [[Wachovia]], [[Citigroup]], and [[AIG]].&lt;ref name="foreignaffairs1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Roger C.

===Credit markets and the shadow banking system===
[[File:TED spread 2008.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|TED spread and components during 2008]]
In September 2008, the crisis hit its most critical stage. There was the equivalent of a [[bank run]] on the [[money market fund]]s, which frequently invest in [[commercial paper]] issued by corporations to fund their operations and payrolls. Withdrawal from money markets were $144.5&amp;nbsp;billion during one week, versus $7.1&amp;nbsp;billion the week prior. This interrupted the ability of corporations to rollover (replace) their [[money market|short-term debt]]. The US government responded by extending insurance for money market accounts analogous to bank [[deposit insurance]] via a temporary guarantee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gullapalli|first=Diya|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122186683086958875 |work=The Wall Street Journal|title=Bailout of Money Funds Seems to Stanch Outflow|date=September 20, 2008|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with Federal Reserve programs to purchase commercial paper. The [[TED spread]], an indicator of perceived credit risk in the general economy, spiked up in July 2007, remained volatile for a year, then spiked even higher in September 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/cbuilder?ticker1=.TEDSP%3AIND "3 year chart"] [[TED spread]] Bloomberg.com "Investment Tools"  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528145833/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/cbuilder?ticker1=.TEDSP%3AIND |date=May 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reaching a record 4.65% on October 10, 2008.

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] and US Treasury Secretary [[Timothy Geithner]] explain the credit crisis via the implosion of the [[shadow banking system]], which had grown to nearly equal the importance of the traditional commercial banking sector as described above. Without the ability to obtain investor funds in exchange for most types of [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] or [[asset-backed commercial paper]], investment banks and other entities in the [[shadow banking]] system could not provide funds to mortgage firms and other corporations.&lt;ref name="newyorkfed.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Krugman 2009" /&gt;

This meant that nearly one-third of the US lending mechanism was frozen and continued to be frozen into June 2009.&lt;ref name="Search Site" /&gt; According to the [[Brookings Institution]], at that time the traditional banking system did not have the capital to close this gap: "It would take a number of years of strong profits to generate sufficient capital to support that additional lending volume." The authors also indicate that some forms of [[securitization]] were "likely to vanish forever, having been an artifact of excessively loose credit conditions." While traditional banks raised their lending standards, it was the collapse of the shadow banking system that was the primary cause of the reduction in funds available for borrowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2009/0615_economic_crisis_baily_elliott.aspx|title=U.S. Financial and Economic Crisis June&amp;nbsp;2009 PDF Page 14|publisher=Brookings Institution|date=June 15, 2009|accessdate=May 1, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603093153/http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2009/0615_economic_crisis_baily_elliott.aspx|archivedate=June 3, 2010|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wealth effects===

There is a direct relationship between declines in wealth and declines in consumption and business investment, which along with government spending, represent the economic engine. Between June 2007 and November 2008, Americans lost an estimated average of more than a quarter of their collective net worth.&lt;ref&gt;Tami Luhby, [http://money.cnn.com/2009/06/11/news/economy/Americans_wealth_drops/?postversion=2009061113 Americans' wealth drops $1.3 trillion: Fed report shows a decline of home values and the stock market cut the nation's wealth to $50.4 trillion]", ''CNN Money'', June 11, 2009. Accessed July 25, 2007. Luhby reports that in Q2 2007, collective American wealth totaled $64.4 trillion, and by Q1 2009 this value had fallen to $50.4 trillion.&lt;/ref&gt; By early November 2008, a broad US stock index, the S&amp;P 500, was down 45% from its 2007 high. Housing prices had dropped 20% from their 2006 peak, with futures markets signaling a 30–35% potential drop. Total home equity in the United States, which was valued at $13&amp;nbsp;trillion at its peak in 2006, had dropped to $8.8&amp;nbsp;trillion by mid-2008 and was still falling in late 2008. Total retirement assets, Americans' second-largest household asset, dropped by 22%, from $10.3&amp;nbsp;trillion in 2006 to $8&amp;nbsp;trillion in mid-2008. During the same period, savings and investment assets (apart from retirement savings) lost $1.2&amp;nbsp;trillion and pension assets lost $1.3&amp;nbsp;trillion. Taken together, these losses total a staggering $8.3&amp;nbsp;trillion.&lt;ref name="foreignaffairs1" /&gt; Since peaking in the second quarter of 2007, household wealth is down&amp;nbsp;$14&amp;nbsp;trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2009/06/11/news/economy/Americans_wealth_drops/?postversion=2009061113|title=Americans' wealth drops $1.3 trillion - Jun. 11, 2009|first=By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney.com senior|last=writer|website=money.cnn.com|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, US homeowners had extracted significant equity in their homes in the years leading up to the crisis, which they could no longer do once housing prices collapsed. Readily obtainable cash used by consumers from home equity extraction doubled from $627&amp;nbsp;billion in 2001 to $1,428&amp;nbsp;billion in 2005 as the housing bubble built, a total of nearly $5&amp;nbsp;trillion over the period.&lt;ref name="Greenspan Kennedy Report – Table 2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Equity extraction – Charts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters.com" /&gt; US home mortgage debt relative to GDP increased from an average of 46% during the 1990s to 73% during 2008, reaching $10.5&amp;nbsp;trillion.&lt;ref name="money.cnn.com" /&gt;

To offset this decline in consumption and lending capacity, the US government and US Federal Reserve committed $13.9&amp;nbsp;trillion, of which $6.8&amp;nbsp;trillion was invested or spent as of June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/examinations/supervisory/insights/sisum09/si_sum09.pdf|title=Government Support for Financial Assets and Liabilities Announced in 2008 and Soon Thereafter ($ in billions).

In some cases the Fed was considered the "buyer of last resort."

In November 2008, economist [[Dean Baker]] observed:

{{blockquote|There is a really good reason for tighter credit. Tens of millions of homeowners who had substantial equity in their homes two years ago have little or nothing today. Businesses are facing the worst downturn since the Great Depression. This matters for credit decisions. A homeowner with equity in her home is very unlikely to default on a car loan or credit card debt. They will draw on this equity rather than lose their car and/or have a default placed on their credit record. On the other hand, a homeowner who has no equity is a serious default risk. In the case of businesses, their creditworthiness depends on their future profits. Profit prospects look much worse in November 2008 than they did in November 2007... While many banks are obviously at the brink, consumers and businesses would be facing a much harder time getting credit right now even if the financial system were rock solid. The problem with the economy is the loss of close to $6&amp;nbsp;trillion in housing wealth and an even larger amount of stock wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prospect.org/article/its-not-credit-crisis-damn-it|title=It's Not the Credit Crisis, Damn It!|last=Baker|first=Dean|date=|website=|publisher=|publication-date=November 29, 2008|accessdate=March 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the heart of the portfolios of many of these institutions were investments whose assets had been derived from bundled home mortgages. Exposure to these mortgage-backed securities, or to the [[credit derivatives]] used to insure them against failure, caused the collapse or takeover of several key firms such as [[Lehman Brothers]], [[American International Group|AIG]], [[Merrill Lynch]], and [[HBOS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Uchitelle|first=Louis|authorlink=Louis Uchitelle |publication-date=September 18, 2008|title=Pain Spreads as Credit Vise Grows Tighter|newspaper=The New York Times|page=A1|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/19/business/economy/19econ.html|accessdate=March 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lehman Merrill"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/business/15lehman.html|title=Lehman Files for Bankruptcy; Merrill Is Sold|first=Andrew Ross|last=Sorkin|date=September 14, 2008|publisher=|accessdate=July 11, 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/business/worldbusiness/18lloyds.html|title=Lloyds Bank Is Discussing Purchase of British Lender|first=Julia|last=Werdigier|date=September 17, 2008|publisher=|accessdate=July 11, 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both MBS and CDO were purchased by corporate and institutional investors globally. Derivatives such as [[credit default swap]]s also increased the linkage between large financial institutions. Moreover, the [[leverage (finance)|de-leveraging]] of financial institutions, as assets were sold to pay back obligations that could not be refinanced in frozen credit markets, further accelerated the solvency crisis and caused a decrease in international trade.

World political leaders, national ministers of finance and central bank directors coordinated their efforts to reduce fears, but the crisis continued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e91b24b6-8557-11dd-a1ac-0000779fd18c.html "Central banks act to calm markets"], ''[[The Financial Times]]'', September 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of October 2008 a [[currency crisis]] developed, with investors transferring vast capital resources into stronger currencies such as the yen, the dollar and the [[Swiss franc]], leading many emergent economies to seek aid from the [[International Monetary Fund]].&lt;ref name="landler1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/24/business/worldbusiness/24emerge.html|title=West Is in Talks on Credit to Aid Poorer Nations|work=The New York Times|date=October 23, 2008|accessdate=October 24, 2008|first=Mark|last=Landler}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fackler1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/24/business/worldbusiness/24won.html|title=Trouble Without Borders|work=The New York Times|date=October 23, 2008|accessdate=October 24, 2008|first=Martin|last=Fackler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The US economy has been spending too much and borrowing too much for years and the rest of the world depended on the US consumer as a source of global demand."

Some [[developing countries]] that had seen strong economic growth saw significant slowdowns. For example, growth forecasts in Cambodia show a fall from more than 10% in 2007 to close to zero in 2009, and Kenya may achieve only 3–4% growth in 2009, down from 7% in 2007. According to the research by the [[Overseas Development Institute]], reductions in growth can be attributed to falls in trade, commodity prices, investment and [[remittances]] sent from migrant workers (which reached a record $251&amp;nbsp;billion in 2007, but have fallen in many countries since).&lt;ref name="odi.org.uk"&gt;Dirk Willem te Velde(2009) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2822&amp;title=global-financial-crisis-developing-countries-crisis-resilient-growth|ODI Briefing Paper 54 – The global financial crisis and developing countries: taking stock, taking action].

The World Bank reported in February 2009 that the Arab World was far less severely affected by the credit crunch. With generally good balance of payments positions coming into the crisis or with alternative sources of financing for their large current account deficits, such as remittances, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) or foreign aid, Arab countries were able to avoid going to the market in the latter part of 2008. This group is in the best position to absorb the economic shocks. They entered the crisis in exceptionally strong positions. This gives them a significant cushion against the global downturn. The greatest effect of the global economic crisis will come in the form of lower oil prices, which remains the single most important determinant of economic performance. Steadily declining oil prices would force them to draw down reserves and cut down on investments. Significantly lower oil prices could cause a reversal of economic performance as has been the case in past oil shocks. Initial impact will be seen on public finances and employment for foreign workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dina Elnaggar.|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/MENAEXT/0,,contentMDK:22069140~pagePK:146736~piPK:146830~theSitePK:256299,00.html|title=Update on the Impact of the Global Financial Crisis on Arab Countries|publisher=World Bank|date=February 1, 2009|accessdate=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===US economic effects===
====Real gross domestic product====
The output of goods and services produced by labor and property located in the United States decreased at an annual rate of approximately 6% in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009, versus activity in the year-ago periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/gdpnewsrelease.htm|title=BEA Press Releases|publisher=Bea.gov|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US unemployment rate increased to 10.1% by October 2009, the highest rate since 1983 and roughly twice the pre-crisis rate.

With the decline of gross domestic product came the decline in innovation.  With fewer resources to risk in creative destruction, the number of patent applications flat-lined.  Compared to the previous 5 years of exponential increases in patent application, this stagnation correlates to the similar drop in GDP during the same time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/us_stat.pdf|title=U.S. Patent Statistics|publisher=uspto.gov|accessdate=April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Distribution of wealth in the US====

Typical American families did not fare as well, nor did those "wealthy-but-not wealthiest" families just beneath the pyramid's top. On the other hand, half of the poorest families did not have wealth declines at all during the crisis. The Federal Reserve surveyed 4,000 households between 2007 and 2009, and found that the total wealth of 63 percent of all Americans declined in that period. 77 percent of the richest families had a decrease in total wealth, while only 50 percent of those on the bottom of the pyramid suffered a decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moneywatch.bnet.com/economic-news/blog/financial-decoder/fed-survey-were-45-poorer/3560/|title=Fed Survey: We're 45% Poorer &amp;#124; Jill Schlesinger – CBS MoneyWatch.com|publisher=Moneywatch.bnet.com|date=March 25, 2011|accessdate=April 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Griftopia: Bubble Machines, Vampire Squids, and the Long Con That Is Breaking America|last=Taibbi|first=Matt|authorlink=Matt Taibbi|year=2010|publisher=Spiegel &amp; Grau|isbn=978-0-385-52995-2|page=12|url=https://www.amazon.com/Griftopia-Machines-Vampire-Breaking-America/dp/0385529953#reader_0385529953|accessdate=October 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolff|first1=Edward N|year=2010|title=Recent Trends in Household Wealth in the United States: Rising Debt and the Middle-Class Squeeze – An Update to 2007|journal=Levy Economics Institute Working Papers Series|issue=159|publisher=Social Science Research Network|ssrn=1585409|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study commissioned by the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] found that white home-owning households recovered from the financial crisis faster than black home-owning households, and projected that the financial crisis will likely widen the [[racial wealth gap]] in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Burd-Sharps and Rebecca Rasch.

==Government responses==
===Emergency and short-term responses===
{{Main|Subprime mortgage crisis#Responses}}

The US Federal Reserve and central banks around the world took steps to expand money supplies to avoid the risk of a [[deflationary spiral]], in which lower wages and higher unemployment led to a self-reinforcing decline in global consumption. In addition, governments enacted large fiscal stimulus packages, by borrowing and spending to offset the reduction in private sector demand caused by the crisis. The US Federal Reserve's new and expanded liquidity facilities were intended to enable the central bank to fulfill its traditional lender-of-last-resort role during the crisis while mitigating stigma, broadening the set of institutions with access to liquidity, and increasing the flexibility with which institutions could tap such liquidity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr563.pdf ''Federal Reserve Liquidity Provision during the Financial Crisis of 2007–2009''], Federal Reserve Bank of New York, July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

This credit freeze brought the [[global financial system]] to the brink of collapse. The response of the Federal Reserve, the [[European Central Bank]], the [[Bank of England]] and other central banks was immediate and dramatic. During the last quarter of 2008, these central banks purchased US$2.5&amp;nbsp;trillion of government debt and troubled private assets from banks. This was the largest liquidity injection into the credit market, and the largest monetary policy action, in world history.

However, banks instead were spending the money in more profitable areas by investing internationally in emerging markets. Banks were also investing in foreign currencies, which Stiglitz and others point out may lead to [[currency war]]s while China redirects its currency holdings away from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wheatley|first=Jonathan|title=Brazil in 'currency war' alert|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/33ff9624-ca48-11df-a860-00144feab49a.html|accessdate=November 5, 2010|newspaper=Financial Times|date=November 5, 2010|author2=Peter Garnham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments have also [[bailout|bailed out]] a variety of firms as discussed above, incurring large financial obligations.

===Regulatory proposals and long-term responses===
{{Further|Obama financial regulatory reform plan of 2009|Regulatory responses to the subprime crisis|Subprime mortgage crisis solutions debate}}
United States President [[Barack Obama]] and key advisers introduced a series of regulatory proposals in June 2009. The proposals address consumer protection, [[executive pay]], bank financial cushions or capital requirements, expanded regulation of the [[shadow banking system]] and [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]], and enhanced authority for the Federal Reserve to safely wind-down systemically important institutions, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-of-the-President-on-Regulatory-Reform/|title=Remarks of the President on Regulatory Reform &amp;#124; The White House|publisher=Whitehouse.gov|date=June 17, 2009|accessdate=November 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=View all comments that have been posted about this article.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/14/AR2009061402443_pf.html|title=Geithner &amp; Summers – A New Financial Foundation|work=Washington Post|date=June 14, 2009|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialstability.gov/roadtostability/regulatoryreform.html|title=Treasury Department Report – Financial Regulatory Reform|publisher=Financialstability.gov|date=March 22, 2010|accessdate=May 1, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421184209/http://www.financialstability.gov/roadtostability/regulatoryreform.html|archivedate=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010, Obama proposed additional regulations limiting the ability of banks to engage in [[proprietary trading]].

The US Senate passed a reform bill in May 2010, following the House, which passed a bill in December 2009. These bills must now be reconciled. The ''[[New York Times]]'' provided a comparative summary of the features of the two bills, which address to varying extent the principles enumerated by the Obama administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=New|first=The|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/05/20/business/20100520-regulation-graphic.html|title=New York Times-Major Parts of the Financial Regulation Overhaul-May&amp;nbsp;2010|work=The New York Times|date=May 20, 2010|accessdate=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the Volcker Rule against proprietary trading is not part of the legislation, though in the Senate bill regulators have the discretion but not the obligation to prohibit these trades.

European regulators introduced [[Basel III]] regulations for banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bis.org/press/p100912.pdf|title=Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision announces higher global minimum capital standards|date=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It increased capital ratios, limits on leverage, narrow definition of capital (to exclude subordinated debt), limit counter-party risk, and new liquidity requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/0726_basel_elliott.aspx|title=Basel III, the Banks, and the Economy|publisher=Brookings Institution|date=July 26, 2010|last=Elliott|first=Douglas J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics argue that Basel III doesn't address the problem of faulty risk-weightings. Major banks suffered losses from AAA-rated created by [[financial engineering]] (which creates apparently risk-free assets out of high risk collateral) that required less capital according to Basel II. Lending to AA-rated sovereigns has a risk-weight of zero, thus increasing lending to governments and leading to the next crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2010/09/basel_iii|title=Third time's the charm?|date=September 13, 2010|newspaper=The Economist|accessdate=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johan Norberg]] argues that regulations (Basel III among others) have indeed led to excessive lending to risky governments (see [[European sovereign-debt crisis]]) and the [[European Central Bank|ECB]] pursues even more lending as the solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://reason.com/archives/2012/04/17/financial-crisis-ii|title=Financial Crisis II: European governments fail to learn from history|last=Norberg|first=Johan|date=May 2012|newspaper=Reason}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stabilization==
The US recession that began in December 2007 ended in June 2009, according to the US [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] (NBER)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424052970203983104575367471896032724.html?mod=googlenews_barrons|title=It's Dippy to Fret About a Double-Dip Recession|author=Mark Hulbert|date=July 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the financial crisis appears to have ended about the same time.

The ''[[New York Times]]'' identifies March 2009 as the "nadir of the crisis" and noted in 2011 that "Most stock markets around the world are at least 75 percent higher than they were then. Financial stocks, which led the markets down, have also led them up." Nevertheless, the lack of fundamental changes in banking and financial markets worries many market participants, including the [[International Monetary Fund]].&lt;ref name=Over&gt;{{cite news|last=Norris|first=Floyd|title=Crisis Is Over, but Where's the Fix?|work=New York Times|date=March 10, 2011|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/11/business/economy/11norris.html?|accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==
The financial crisis generated many articles and books outside of the scholarly and financial press, including articles and books by author [[William Greider]], economist [[Michael Hudson (economist)|Michael Hudson]], author and former bond salesman [[Michael Lewis]], [[Kevin Phillips (political commentator)|Kevin Phillips]], and investment broker [[Peter Schiff]].

In May 2010, a documentary, ''Overdose: A Film about the Next Financial Crisis'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/events/100517screening.html|title=Overdose: A Film about the Next Financial Crisis|publisher=Cato.org|date=May 17, 2010|accessdate=January 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; premiered about how the financial crisis came about and how the solutions that have been applied by many governments are setting the stage for the next crisis. The film is based on the book ''Financial Fiasco'' by Johan Norberg and features [[Alan Greenspan]], with funding from the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] think tank [[The Cato Institute]]. Greenspan is responsible for de-regulating the derivatives market while chairman of the Federal Reserve.

In October 2010, a documentary film about the crisis, ''[[Inside Job (2010 film)|Inside Job]]'' directed by [[Charles Ferguson (filmmaker)|Charles Ferguson]], was released by [[Sony Pictures Classics]]. In 2011, it was awarded the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]] at the [[83rd Academy Awards]].

''Time'' magazine named "25 People to Blame for the Financial Crisis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/completelist/0,29569,1877351,00.html|work=Time|title=25 People to Blame for the Financial Crisis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Lewis]] published a best-selling non-fiction book about the crisis, entitled ''[[The Big Short]]''. In 2015, it was adapted into a [[The Big Short (film)|film of the same name]], which won the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]]. One point raised is to what extent those outside of the markets themselves (i.e., not working for a mainstream investment bank) could forecast the events and be generally less myopic. Subsequent to the crisis itself some observers furthermore noted a change in social relations as some group culpability emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Drummond|first1=Norman|title=The Power of Three: Discovering what really matters in life|date=2010|publisher=Hachette (Hodder &amp; Stoughton)|location=London|isbn=978-0-340-97991-4|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flooz.com''' was a [[Dot-com company|dot-com]] venture, now defunct, based in [[New York City]] that went online in February 1999. It was promoted by comic actress [[Whoopi Goldberg]] in a series of television advertisements.&lt;ref name="BI"&gt;{{cite web |title=These dot-com startups look just like some of today's hottest tech companies — here's what happened to them |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/dot-com-era-startups-that-look-like-todays-startups-2015-10 |author=Kosoff, Maya |date=October 16, 2015 |publisher=[[Business Insider]] |accessdate=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Started by [[iVillage]] co-founder [[Robert Levitan]], the company attempted to establish a [[currency]] unique to [[Internet]] merchants, somewhat similar in concept to airline [[frequent flier program]]s or grocery store stamp books. The name "flooz" was based upon the Arabic word for money, فلوس, ''fuloos''. Users accumulated flooz credits either as a promotional bonus given away by some internet businesses or purchased directly from flooz.com which then could be redeemed for merchandise at a variety of participating online stores. Adoption of flooz by both merchants and customers proved limited, and it never established itself as a widely recognized [[medium of exchange]], which hindered both its usefulness and appeal. 

==Use by crime syndicate==
In 2001, Flooz.com was notified by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] that a Russian organized crime syndicate was using Flooz and stolen credit card numbers as part of a [[money-laundering]] scheme, in which stolen credit cards were used to purchase currency and then redeemed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=E-Commerce Report; Seller of Online Currency May Have Been Victim of Fraud |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/27/business/e-commerce-report-seller-of-online-currency-may-have-been-victim-of-fraud.html |date=August 27, 2001 |author=Tedeschi, Bob |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=February 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levitan has stated that fraudulent purchases accounted for 19% of consumer credit card transactions by mid-2001.&lt;ref name="5_dot_coms_that_didnt_survive"&gt;{{cite web |title=Five Dot-Coms That Didn’t Survive The Bubble |publisher=TechnoBuffalo |author=Aune, Sean P. |date=January 25, 2010 |url=http://www.technobuffalo.com/2010/01/25/five-dot-coms-that-didnt-survive-the-bubble/ |accessdate=February 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closure==
The company announced its closure on August 26, 2001, perceived as an early indicator of the growing [[dot-com bubble|dot-com bubble bust]].&lt;ref name="5_dot_coms_that_didnt_survive"/&gt; Upon the company's closing, all unused flooz credits became worthless and nonrefundable. Over its short history, flooz.com reportedly exhausted from $35 million to $50 million in venture capital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnet.com/4520-11136_1-6278387-1.html Top 10 dot-com flops] CNET.com&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3983">The '''Galway International Oyster Festival''' is a [[food festival]] held annually in [[Galway]] on the west coast of Ireland on the last weekend of September, the first month of the [[oyster]] season. Inaugurated in 1954, it was the brainchild of the [[Great Southern Hotels|Great Southern Hotel]] (now Hotel Meyrick) manager, Brian Collins. In 2000 was described by the [[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]] as "one of the 12 greatest shows on earth"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= Jim | last= Keeble | title= The Greatest Shows on Earth| work= | publisher= [[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]] | date= 2000-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was listed in the 1987 AA Travel Guide one of Europe's Seven Best Festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Galway Oyster &amp; Seafood Festival – Irish Food Festival – Seafood Festival – History of The Galway International Oyster &amp; Seafood Festival | url = http://galwayoysterfestival.com/index.php/history-of-the-galway-international-oyster-seafood-festival/ | publisher = Galway International Oyster &amp; Seafood Festival website | accessdate = 2015-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Galway International Oyster Festival was created to celebrate the Galway Native Oyster as it is a unique feature of Galway City &amp; County. Hotel Manager, Brian Collins had been searching for something unique to attract more visitors to Galway in what was then, a quieter month of the year. Collins discussed the idea with the folk at Guinness and Patrick M. Burke's Bar in Clarenbridge and the first Galway Oyster Festival was created in 1954 with a whole 34 attendees.&lt;ref&gt;Thanks for the Memories, 1954-1994, Forty Years of The Galway International Oyster Festival&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival was originally held in Clarenbridge village during the day and the Great Southern Hotel in Galway City at night until the mid-1980s when it grew so large, all of the festivities were held in the city centre of Galway. There was a red &amp; white striped marquee at Spanish Arch and then at Nimmo's Pier by the Claddagh. In order to reduce ticket prices, the festival changed location to The Radisson Hotel Galway in 2009 but due to popular demand, the marquee was brought back in 2011, located in the Docks and the festival was renamed as the Galway International Oyster &amp; Seafood Festival.  In 2014, the 60th anniversary of the event, its producers, [http://www.milestoneinventive.com Milestone Inventive], brought it back to its original Galway City home at the aptly named Fishmarket at the Spanish Arch.

The main events are two Oyster Opening Championships, the ''Irish Oyster Opening Championship'' and the ''World Oyster Opening Championship''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ireland.com/en-au/what-is-available/food-and-drink/food-festivals/articles/oyster-festivals/|title=Oyster festivals in Ireland|work=Ireland.com|access-date=2017-10-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/metro/community/2017/05/17/prying-open-the-competition-contestants-vie-for-title-of-best-oyster-shucker-in-first-such-champions/|title=Contestants vie for title of best oyster shucker in first such championship in Malaysia - Metro News {{!}} The Star Online|website=www.thestar.com.my|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other events include a Masquerade Gala '[[Mardi Gras|Mardi-Gras]]', a seafood trail, a [[silent disco]] and a family day featuring everything from cookery demonstrations, to jazz, to circus skills workshops.

[[Group Captain]] '''George Lovell "Uncle" Denholm''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|DFC}} (20 December 1908 – 15 June 1997) was a fighter pilot and [[flying ace]] of the [[Royal Air Force]] during the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Battle of Britain – Roll of Honour|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/BattleofBritainRollofHonour.cfm|publisher=RAF|accessdate=25 Aug 2013|author=|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He flew [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]] during the [[Battle of Britain]], and is counted amongst the ranks of '[[The Few]]'.&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Obituary: Gp Capt George Denholm|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-gp-capt-george-denholm-1258201.html|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=25 Aug 2013|author=[[Tam Dalyell]]|date=27 June 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Denholm was born at Tidings Hill in [[Bo'ness]], [[West Lothian]], the son of a coal exporters and pit-prop/timber importer. He attended [[Cargilfield Preparatory School]] and [[Fettes College]], and later studied law at [[St John's College, Cambridge]].

At Cambridge, he joined the University Cadet Corps. In 1933, Denholm took an interest in planes and joined [[No. 603 Squadron RAF|No. 603 (City of Edinburgh) Squadron]] of the [[Royal Auxiliary Air Force]]. He took flight training on [[Airco DH.9A]] biplanes at [[RAF Macmerry]] and [[RAF East Fortune]] in East Lothian. In August 1939, Denholm was drafted as a flight commander to 603 Squadron at [[RAF Drem]].&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;

==RAF career==
===RAF Drem===
By the start of the Second World War, Denholm had converted to fly the new Mk.I [[Spitfire]]. It was whilst on combat patrol in his Spitfire on 16 October 1939 that he shared in the shooting down of a [[Heinkel He 111]] (which was attempting to bomb the [[Forth Railway Bridge]]) near [[Port Seton]] in [[East Lothian]]. It was the first German bomber to be shot down over Great Britain in the Second World War.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt; On 12 March 1940 he damaged a [[Dornier Do 17]] off the coast near Aberdeen.

Due to Denholm being 32 at the time and much older than other pilots in the squadron he was nicknamed "Uncle George".

===Battle of Britain===
With the [[Battle of Britain]] in full swing in the summer of 1940, Denholm's squadron was transferred to [[RAF Hornchurch]] in southern England. Flying regular bomber interception sorties, Denholm claimed a probable He 111 on 26 June and shared [[Junkers Ju 88]] on 3 July, plus a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] destroyed and another probable on 28 August. On 30 August, whilst in combat with [[Bf 110]]s over [[Snargate]] in Kent he was shot down but managed to bail out.

Two days later (1 September 1940), Denholm was back in action, and claimed a Bf 109 damaged. On 15 September claimed two Do 17's and a single Bf 109 damaged. However, it was during this sortie that he himself was shot down. His Spitfire crashed at Warren Farm, [[Fairlight, East Sussex]], but he came down safely at [[Guestling]].

Another damaged Bf 109 was claimed by Denholm on 18 September and on 27 September he  shared a Bf 109 destroyed (plus a probable Bf 109 and a shared probable Bf 109). On 20 October 1940 he damaged another Bf 109.&lt;ref name="monument"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Airmen's Stories – S/Ldr. G L Denholm|url=http://www.bbm.org.uk/Denholm.htm|publisher=Battle of Britain London Monument|accessdate=25 Aug 2013|author=|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 October 1940, acting Squadron Leader Denholm was awarded the DFC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Denholm|url=http://en.ww2awards.com/person/43455|publisher=World War 2 Awards|accessdate=25 Aug 2013|author=|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His citation in the London Gazette&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=London Gazette |url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/34976/pages/6134/page.pdf|format=PDF |newspaper=[[The London Gazette]] |publisher=[[His Majesty's Stationery Office]] |issue=34976|date=22 October 1940 |page=6134|accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; read:
{{quote|Since the commencement of hostilities, Squadron Leader Denholm has led his squadron, flight or section in innumerable operational patrols against the enemy. His magnificent leadership has contributed largely to the success of the squadron, which has destroyed fifty-four enemy aircraft in about six weeks; four of these aircraft were destroyed by Squadron Leader Denholm himself.}}

On 11 November he shot down and destroyed an Bf 109 and towards the end of November on the 29th he also shot down an Bf 110.

In April 1941, he relinquished command of No. 603 Squadron and was posted as Fighter Controller to the Operations Room at [[RAF Turnhouse]] in Edinburgh. On 10 May 1941, Denholm was on duty when [[Rudolf Hess]]'s Bf 110 was intercepted over Scotland and the Reich [[Deputy Führer]] was arrested.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;

===Later commands===
In mid-December 1941 Denhom was posted as commander of [[No. 1460 Flight RAF]] at [[RAF Acklington]] with [[Turbinlite]] searchlights fitted to British [[Douglas Havoc]] [[night fighter]]s. He latter remarked that the experiment was a great success.

In March 1942 he was posted as commander of [[No. 605 Squadron RAF]] at [[RAF Ford]]. The squadron was equipped with [[de Havilland Mosquito]] fighter-bombers and were tasked in the run up to D-Day in June 1944 with strafing enemy positions in the [[Pas-de-Calais]] area and throughout northern France. Low flying was a perilous activity and the squadron suffered many losses.

Denholm subsequently became the Station Commander at [[RAF North Weald]], where Norwegian and Danish squadrons operated. He developed a close friendship with the Norwegian Commanding Officer, [[Helge Mehre]], and Denholm accompanied him at the end of the war to receive the German surrender in Norway at [[Gardermoen, Norway|Gardermoen]] outside [[Oslo]].

Denholm's last 'kill' came on 11 March 1943 when he shot down an unidentified enemy aircraft over [[Gilze-Rijen]] in the Netherlands. In January 1945 he was awarded a [[Mention in Despatches]] and stayed with the RAF until discharged in 1947 as a group captain.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;

===Richard Hillary===
Denholm had been [[Richard Hillary]]'s senior commander at No. 603 Squadron, and Hillary had written about how highly regarded "Uncle George" was in his 1943 memoir ''[[The Last Enemy (autobiography)|The Last Enemy]]''. Hillary had been severely burnt after bailing out of a plane but managed to get back into active service. However, on 18 January 1943 he was killed along with his navigator when their [[Bristol Blenheim]] crashed during a night training exercise. Following the cremation of Hillary's body at [[Golders Green]], it was Denholm who scattered his ashes over the [[English Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Airmen's Stories – F/O R H Hillary |url=http://www.bbm.org.uk/Hillary.htm |publisher=Battle of Britain Monument |accessdate=30 January 2014 |author= |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019142824/http://www.bbm.org.uk/Hillary.htm |archivedate=19 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Air combat record==
Denholm ended the war an [[Flying ace|ace]], claiming 6 confirmed destroyed (4 destroyed and 4 shared), 3 probables, 1 shared probable and 5 damaged.

'''Ghosting''' is a form of [[identity theft]] in which someone steals the identity, and sometimes even the role within society, of a specific dead person (the "ghost") who is not widely known to be deceased. Usually, the person who steals this identity (the "ghoster") is roughly the same age that the ghost would have been if still alive, so that any documents citing the birthdate of the ghost will not be conspicuously incorrect if appropriated by the thief now claiming to be that person.

The use of counterfeit identification falsely documenting a completely fictional identity is not ghosting, as false identification cannot be used to obtain [[social services]] or interact with [[government agencies]] or law enforcement officials. The purpose of ghosting is to enable the ghoster to claim for their own use an existing identity that is already listed in government records—an identity that is dormant because its original possessor is dead.

Ghosting is based on the premise (now less justified than in previous times) that separate government agencies do not share a total exchange of information. Therefore, a ghoster can obtain a [[passport]] or [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits in the name of a dead person because the agencies in charge of those services do not routinely cross-check an applicant's history to determine if a [[death certificate]] has been issued in that person's name.

==General description==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2008}}
Typically, identity theft is done for criminal financial gain, with the thief preying upon the [[credit rating]] of a living person who is an active member of society. The identity thief retains their own name and place in society while making unlawful use of someone else's more advantageous financial status. The so-called "identity thief" is really more interested in exploiting someone else's financial credit rather than acquiring that person's identity.  In this sense, it is the creditors, not the person's family and friends, who are the primary victims of this crime.

The motives for ghosting are more complex. The ghoster is sincerely interested in acquiring another person's identity for their own ongoing use and therefore usually selects a person who is dead in order to avoid the risks that would occur if two living people used the same [[Social Security number]]. Generally, a ghoster is unwilling to sustain their existing identity and takes a new identity to get a fresh start in life. Unlike a typical identity thief, who squeezes quick profits from one stolen identity then moves on to the next victim, a ghoster may actively seek to acquire and ''maintain'' a respectable credit rating in their new identity.

Ghosting is largely a phenomenon of the 20th century. Before the arrival of the Social Security system, a person who possessed no identity documents (no birth records, no high school diploma) could live openly without incurring suspicion. Counterfeit identification could not be easily exposed as fake. Only with the arrival of [[income tax]] and social benefits in the 1920s did it become essential for every adult to possess an identity that was registered in government archives—if not their own lawful identity, then one appropriated from a person no longer using it. In the 21st century, advances in technology have made ghosting increasingly difficult to achieve, while governments have increased the penalties for those who get caught.

[[Dashiell Hammett]]'s novel ''[[The Maltese Falcon (novel)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1930) recounts the story, apparently based on a true case, of a businessman named Flitcraft who spontaneously abandons his career and his marriage, abruptly moving to another city and inventing another identity. If this incident did indeed occur in the 1920s or earlier, Flitcraft would have encountered little difficulty in establishing a new life without formal documents such as a birth certificate and Social Security number. If this had occurred ten years later, Flitcraft would have needed a ghost identity to begin his new life.

In the days before computerized [[databases]], ghosting was easy to achieve—especially in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], where [[birth certificates]] and [[death certificates]] are public documents. The [[General Register Office]] in [[London]] contains indexed registers of all births, deaths, marriages and adoptions in [[England]] and [[Wales]]. The typical ghoster might consult the Deaths index (black volumes, archived by year) for the period 15 years after their own birth, seeking records of the death of a man approximately 15 years old (that is, whose birthdate would be near the birthdate of the ghoster). Finding a suitable candidate, the ghoster would then consult the Births index (red volumes, in a different section of the Records Office) for the deceased person's date of birth. Armed with this knowledge, they could then pay a small fee to obtain a copy of the deceased's birth certificate. Using this document as the foundation for the stolen identity, the ghoster would gradually acquire evidence enabling them to pass as the other person, still alive. Some of this evidence would be faked, with other evidence, such as school records, having been legitimately issued to the deceased before their death. Other archives outside of Britain, such as the genealogy records of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], have unwittingly served this same purpose of enabling ghosters to find new identities.

It is easier for a female to appropriate a dead person's identity than it is for a male. For instance, a female ghoster can steal the identity of a dead female who had married and taken her husband's name.  Detection is more difficult in this case because the death certificate and the birth certificate will show two different surnames. Also, gaps in the ghost identity's employment history (for the years between the ghost's death and the date when the ghoster claims that identity) will arouse less suspicion if the impostor is a female, who might conceivably have spent the transition years as a homemaker with no wages.

In the 1970s, a [[counterculture]] publishing firm in [[California]] named [[Eden Press]] published a pamphlet, ''The Paper Trip'', giving detailed instructions for acquiring a dead person's identity. Among other pointers, the pamphlet advised readers to search newspaper archives for old articles about an entire family getting killed in an accident while on vacation outside of their home state. This scenario offers several advantages to a ghoster:

* Because the incident involved multiple deaths, there are multiple candidates (of different ages, and both sexes) for an identity that the ghoster can steal.
* Because the entire family died in the same incident, the dead person whose identity is chosen for ghosting is not likely to have any immediate relatives who are still alive and aware of their death.
* Because the family died outside their home state, their birth records and death records are archived in two different states and are unlikely to be cross-referenced. Also, if the deceased family's remains were not returned to their home community for burial, the staffers in the local records office are unlikely to be aware that the family is deceased and will not be suspicious when someone claiming to be a member of this family requests a copy of the birth certificate.
* Because the deaths occurred years ago, new requests for an old birth certificate are unlikely to stir anyone's memory of that individual's death.

Whereas typical identity thieves will steal the credit rating of anyone, regardless of age, race or sex, a ghoster intends to ''live'' in the stolen identity and therefore usually seeks to acquire the identity of a dead person whose physical description strongly resembles the living ghoster's appearance: similar birthdate, height, sex, race or ethnic background. Rare exceptions are [[transsexual]] ghosters (see below), who seek to acquire the identity of a dead person of the opposite sex but otherwise resemble the ghoster as much as possible.

==Drawbacks==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2008}}
Ghosting is no longer as easy as it once was. This is largely due to the increasing computerization of vital records and the increasing power of [[search engines]]. Until the 1990s, each state in the [[United States]] maintained its birth records and death records in separate registries with no cross-referencing. Modern search engines enable government clerks to establish quickly if a death certificate has ever been issued to the person named on a given birth certificate.

Many ghosters have criminal records under their original identities and seek new identities in order to gain a fresh start (or to start a new criminal career without the prior arrest record).  Before the days of enhanced [[computer imaging]], it was a difficult and time-consuming process for law-enforcement officials to search [[fingerprint]]s archives. If a ghoster were arrested and fingerprinted under their new identity (with no prior arrests under that name), there was a good chance that authorities would fail to discover any records of a prior arrest for the same set of fingerprints linked to a different name and birthdate. This is no longer true.  Modern imaging technology now enables search engines to scan a database of millions of [[fingerprint]]s quickly, finding a positive match which police can transmit electronically to other police forces anywhere in the world. New identity documents can no longer conceal prior arrests.

In the United States, it was formerly the case that citizens were not issued a Social Security number until their first paid employment. Thus, in the year 1975, a man ghoster aged 25 would acquire the birth certificate of a boy who was born circa 1950 (the same age as the ghoster) but who had died at age 15 or younger. An individual who died before adulthood would not be likely to possess a Social Security number; therefore, a ghoster claiming to be this person and applying for a first-time Social Security number at age 25 would not arouse suspicion if he could explain why he waited until age 25 to begin working for wages. But a ghoster who attempted this scheme in the year 2000 (or later) would arouse great suspicion because parents are now required to acquire a Social Security number for their offspring before the next annual income tax return is filed, and government computers can instantly retrieve any individual's entire history of employment and income-tax records. A ghoster who applies to a Social Security office for a replacement of a Social Security card issued to someone who died ten years earlier (who claims to be that individual, still living) will immediately be asked why he has not reported any wages for the past ten years and will be challenged to explain how he has supported himself for ten years without wages.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} There will also be a gap in the tax records, requiring the ghoster to explain why he hasn't filed tax returns for the intervening years.

Another factor that discourages ghosting is the fact that the stakes are now much higher. In prior times, a criminal with a long record of felony convictions had strong incentive to commit the minor crime of ghosting in order to acquire a new identity with no prior arrests. This is no longer true. The unlawful acquisition of false identification, whether counterfeit or falsely appropriated from a dead person, will now be prosecuted far more aggressively than he might have been in the past.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Ghosting has never been foolproof. One reason is the overconfidence of ghosters who, after acquiring a new identity, refuse to abandon the habits and associations of their previous identity. [[Christopher John Boyce]] was a spy for the USSR, traitor to the USA, and an  armed bank  robber who was nicknamed "The Falcon" for his interest in competitive [[falconry]]. There are barely a hundred falconers in the entire United States, and Boyce was known personally to all of them. After escaping from federal prison and acquiring a new identity via ghosting, Boyce resumed his old habit of attending falconry competitions, now wearing a new name but still associating with falconers who had known him by his original name. Boyce was swiftly rearrested.

==Types of ghosters==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2008}}
Most ghosters are running away from something: a criminal record, a marriage, or bad debts. Unlike more typical identity thieves, it is often the case that a ghoster is a former criminal who genuinely desires to reform and who seeks an unblemished identity (even if acquired illegally) as a necessary part of the process. Several members of the [[Revolutionary Youth Movement]] of the 1960s eventually disavowed their radical pasts and wished to erase ties to their earlier actions. In several cases, former radicals were able to evade arrest for more than 20 years because, through ghosting, they acquired new identities in which they proceeded to live entirely law-abiding lives. During the [[Vietnam war]], many young men in the United States avoided the draft by fleeing to [[Canada]] or other nations, where they acquired ghost identities enabling them to live as natives of those countries.

During the days of [[racial segregation in the United States]] and [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]], light-skinned [[mulattos]] who were legally defined as Negroes had strong incentive to pass as Caucasians. Some of these individuals may have stolen the identities of deceased white persons,{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} acquiring birth certificates that listed them as "white." (In South Africa, there was a third legal category of [[colored]] people, which would make the transition less noticeable.)

==Famous examples==

The American film actor [[Wallace Ford]] was a successful ghoster. Born in England under the name Samuel Jones, he was estranged from his family at an early age and placed in a school in Canada. At the age of 15, Jones became a [[hobo]] and stowed away aboard freight trains with a fellow hobo named Wallace Ford. The two boys eventually were in a train accident; Jones survived, but Ford was killed. Jones then appropriated the other man's name and some aspects of his biography, becoming a successful actor under the name Wallace Ford, eventually starring on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] and in [[Hollywood]] films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Feramisc | first = Thomas M.  |author2=Peggy Moran Koster | title = The Mummy Unwrapped: Scenes Left on Universal's Cutting Room Floor | publisher = McFarland | date = 2003 | pages = 138–139 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_o-WNUbs7nQC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=%22wallace+ford%22+samuel+jones&amp;sig=h5jLMV5Ca3IWVufA_zCPV_OYiII#PPA138,M1 | isbn = 0-7864-1368-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As "Wallace Ford," Jones used the real Ford's birthdate and other statistics on all of his own tax returns and official documents, even applying for a passport as Wallace Ford for his 1937 return to England. Only shortly before his death in 1966 did the actor reveal the complete truth about his identity.

Jones (Ford) was fortunate to have an ideal candidate for his ghost identity: a dead person of his own race, sex and approximate age whose death was ''never officially recorded''. (No one came forward to identify the real Wallace Ford's remains.) Typically, ghosters seeking a dead person's identity must choose someone whose death has been recorded in public archives, creating a risk that, after donning this new identity, the ghoster will eventually be confronted with a copy of his "own" death certificate.

Ghosters have appeared in fiction. One example is [[Seymour Skinner]], the grade-school principal in ''[[The Simpsons]]''. Several years after his first appearance on this series, Skinner revealed that he was an impostor who had stolen the real Seymour Skinner's life and identity after the real Skinner was captured in Vietnam and sold to a shoe-producing company in China. [[Don Draper]], the main character in [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]'s ''[[Mad Men]]'', is another example of a ghoster, obtaining his identity from a deceased superior officer during the [[Korean War]]. In the film ''[[The Day of the Jackal (film)|The Day of the Jackal]]'' the would-be assassin assumes the identity of a deceased person to hide his movements from the authorities.

In [[Naruto]], the character Obito used the identity of Uchiha Madara until it was revealed that the real Madara is dead by Kabuto.

In [[Father is Strange]], a Korean drama, Byun Han-soo is revealed to actually be Lee Yoon Seok. The real Byun Han-soo died in an explosion in the US. His body was mistaken for his friend Lee Yoon Seok as they had switched coats- which had each other's passports in. Mr Lee didn't correct the mistake as he wanted him, his girlfriend and his soon-to-be-born son to escape the title of ex-convict that was tied to his real name.

'''The Grand Opera House''', often called '''The Grand''' and originally known as the '''Academy of Music''', is a [[historic]] [[opera house]] located in [[Macon, Georgia]], United States.  Listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1970, it is now the [[performing arts]] center of [[Mercer University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.mercer.edu/News/Articles/2009/090922Grand.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Academy of Music was constructed in 1884 with the largest [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] in the southeastern United States and seating for 2,418, almost one-fifth of Macon's population at the time.&lt;ref name="thegrandmacon.com"&gt;http://www.thegrandmacon.com/history/&lt;/ref&gt;  The building was renovated in 1905; the present seven-story facade was added and the building reopened as the Grand Opera House.&lt;ref name="thegrandmacon.com"/&gt;

The Grand has had numerous historic uses; live [[horse]]s and [[chariot]]s appeared in a 1908 production of ''[[Ben-Hur (play)|Ben-Hur]]'' and during World War I, actor [[Charlie Chaplin]] led the [[John Philip Sousa]] band for a fundraising effort. The theater has also hosted, among others, [[Sarah Bernhardt]], [[Will Rogers]], [[George Burns]] and [[Gracie Allen]], [[Lionel Barrymore]], [[Ethel Barrymore]], [[Bob Hope]], the [[Allman Brothers Band]], and [[Ray Charles]].

[[Magician (illusion)|Magician]] [[Harry Houdini]] was also a featured player at the Grand, leaving a well-known legacy: the stage sports a number of trap doors, one of which remains operational and is used occasionally today in performances such as annual production of ''[[The Nutcracker]]'' [[ballet]]. Local lore claims that the trap doors were installed specifically for Houdini.

In 1936, as the popularity of [[vaudeville]] waned, the Grand changed to a [[movie theater]], hosting Macon's only [[Hollywood]] [[premiere]], 1945's ''[[God is My Co-Pilot (film)|God is My Co-Pilot]]''.

== Revival ==

By the 1960s, the Grand had ceased showing movies and plans were made to replace it with a [[parking lot]].&lt;ref name="thegrandmacon.com"/&gt;  Those plans were blocked in 1967 by the Macon Arts Council, a group formed to save and restore the Grand; the group held a fundraising [[wiktionary:gala|gala]] featuring the [[Atlanta Symphony Orchestra]] and had the property placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1970.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;  Among the founders of the group was Macon architect [[Ellamae Ellis League]] who also supervised a restoration of The Grand so it could reopen as a live theater in 1969.&lt;ref name=nrhpdoc/&gt;{{rp|2–3}}  (The second balcony, or [[peanut gallery]], remained closed to the public and was dedicated to lighting equipment at this time, reducing the maximum seating to its current number of 1,030).  Fund-raising efforts continued through the next several decades, with ongoing physical plant upgrades, with another renovation taking place in 1985.

In 1995, [[Mercer University]] signed a [[lease]] with [[Bibb County, Georgia|Bibb County]] to manage the Grand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thegrandmacon.com/governors/&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, Mercer has invested in upgrading the facility to modern standards as well as making it a fixture for community events.&lt;ref name="thegrandmacon.com"/&gt;  Today, the Grand hosts many [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] touring companies, [[concert]]s (such as those of the Macon Symphony Orchestra, [[community theatre]] productions (including the aforementioned ''Nutcracker'' holiday show), and other performances and events.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4967">The '''Green Apple Festival''', now in its fourth year, is America’s largest [[Earth Day]] Celebration.  Its mission is to involve audiences of all ages in celebrating Earth Day, raising local and environmental awareness, educating individuals on environmental issues, hosting cultural events suitable for a wide and varied audience, and providing tangible benefits to local communities and environments.

[http://www.greenapplefestival.com Green Apple Festival] was founded by Peter Shapiro and [[Zenbu Media]]. It is produced in partnership with [http://www.earthday.net Earth Day Network] (EDN), the non-profit organization created by the original founders of Earth Day in 1970. The Executive Director is Kathryn Stoddard.

Since the mid-nineties, the growth of Earth Day in the US and around the world has been explosive. More than one billion people in 175 countries now take part in Earth Day activities, according to the Earth Day Network. Businesses too have increasingly become involved and now view Earth Day as a day each year to focus on "going green", exploring climate solutions, and promoting environmental achievements.

With growing public demand for meaningful ways to participate in Earth Day in the US, [http://www.greenapplefestival.com Green Apple Festival] has expanded each year since 2006. It began with one city, New York, in 2006; in 2007, it was held in New York, Chicago and San Francisco. By 2008, Green Apple Festival had grown to eight cities: New York, Washington DC, Miami, Chicago, Denver, Dallas, Los Angeles and San Francisco. In 2009, plans are to grow to 10 cities with events on April 19, 2009. In each city, the festival presents large-scale free events in landmark parks, and includes live music, entertainment, guest speakers and environmental activities.

"By featuring a diverse group of musicians and uniting these under one cause, we are able to coordinate an exciting, and unprecedented event. We hope the national footprint of the Festival will help inform as many people as possible on these important issues. And, we hope to keep expanding in future years. I think everyone would agree that Earth Day should be recognized in a big way every year." – Peter Shapiro, Founder.

== 2008 ==
Once the worlds's largest Earth Day celebration, [http://www.greenapplefestival.com Green Apple Festival] has been inactive since 2009. Green Apple Festival took place in New York City, Washington DC, Miami, Chicago, Denver, Dallas, Los Angeles and San Francisco.

On April 20, 2008, eight simultaneous events were held to observe Earth Day, with over 200,000 people attending in landmark venues: [[Central Park]] in New York, the [[National Mall]] in Washington DC, [[Bicentennial Park (Miami)|Bicentennial Park]] in Miami, [[Fair Park]] in Dallas, [[Lincoln Park Zoo]] in Chicago, [[City Park, Denver|City Park]] in Denver, [[Golden Gate Park]] in San Francisco, and [[Santa Monica Pier]] in Los Angeles.

In addition, Green Apple Festival also presented 220 music shows in indoor music venues in the eight cities on April 18 and 19.  Each of the 110 venues where the shows took place and 475 performances themselves were made "green" through the use of environmentally sustainable paper, lighting and cleaning products.

== Past Events ==

=== 2007 ===
In 2007, The Green Apple Music &amp; Arts Festival ran from April 20–22 in New York City, Chicago and San Francisco with over 200,000 in attendance and millions more reached through the media. Large-scale free public events were held in [[Central Park]] and on Vanderbilt Avenue outside Grand Central Terminal in New York, the [[Lincoln Park Zoo]] in Chicago and at [[Golden Gate Park]] in San Francisco. Green Apple partnered with Earth Day Network, the worldwide coordinating body for Earth Day events, campaigns and activities.

=== 2006 ===
The first annual Green Apple Music &amp; Arts festival was held at over 35 venues in the New York City area and ran from April 20–23. On Thursday, April 20, The Sixth Annual Jammy Awards show ([[Jammys]])at [[Madison Square Garden]] kicked off the festivities. Jammys performances included: [[Blues Traveler]], [[Guster]], [[Peter Frampton]], Martin Sexton, Béla Fleck and The Flecktones, and many more. The festival concluded at The [[Ziegfeld Theatre (1969)|Ziegfeld Theatre]] with the world premiere of the film Wetlands Preserved directed by Relix senior editor and Jambands.com founder [[Dean Budnick]] and executive produced by Peter Shapiro. The documentary examines the social, political and musical history of the celebrated New York City rock club The Wetlands.

The '''Historic Formula One Championship''', previously known as the '''Thoroughbred Grand Prix Championship''', was a championship for [[Formula One]] cars from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s which is sanctioned by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]], motor sport's world governing body. The championship was recognised by the FIA in 1994 as the only official FIA Historic Formula One Championship and its first season was in 1995. For 2013, the series was taken over by Masters Racing to become the [[FIA Masters Historic Formula One Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themastersseries.com/news/item/14-masters-historic-racing-to-run-two-fia-historic-championships-from-2013 |title=Masters to run FIA Historic Championships |publisher=Masters Historic Racing |accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations==
{{Tone|section|date=August 2011}}

===Class system===
The championship is split into four classes according to the vehicle's age and technical specification.&lt;ref name="sportingregs"&gt;{{Citation|title = Sporting Regulations for FIA Historic Formula One Championship 2007|url = http://www.historicformulaone.com/sportingregs2006.doc|accessdate = 10 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HFO Competition features classic Grand Prix racing cars from the 20-year period between 1966 and 1985. During that period, there were design innovations and regulatory changes which resulted in significant performance differences and there is a vast speed differential between the elder cars such as Jackie Stewart’s Tyrrell 001 and the latter machines like the Steffan Johannsen Tyrrell 012 and Brabham BT49.
 
To level the playing field, the championship is split into four classes according to age and design characteristics of the car. Drivers score points within their particular car’s class and all have the chance to claim the overall FIA Trophy at the end of the season.
 
Points
Effectively, there are four competitions going on within every race and each provides points for the driver based on his or her placing in the car’s class and the number of competing cars in that class.
* Three or More starters in the class
1st —  9 points			
2nd — 6 points			
3rd —  4 points			
4th — 3 points			
5th —  2 points
6th —  1 point
 
* Two or three starters in the class    	
1st —  6 points      		 
2nd — 4 points
 
* One starter in the class 	
1st – 4 points
 
Fastest lap – An additional point will be awarded to the drivers who achieve the fastest lap in each class during the race.

'''Championship awards''' – The Champion is the driver who scores the greatest points total, regardless of the class in which he or she competes and it is possible for a driver to switch classes during the season. 
 
In addition to overall champion, awards also go to drivers with the highest total of points in each class excluding the overall champion, as follows:

'''Historic Formula One Historic Cup'''  
The competitor scoring the highest number of points in Class ‘A’

'''Historic Formula One Classic Cup'''  
The competitor scoring the highest number of points in Class ‘B’
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Historic Formula One Cup'''  
The competitor scoring the highest number of points in Class ‘C’
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Historic Formula One Sporting Cup'''  
The competitor scoring the highest number of points in Class ‘D’
&lt;br /&gt;
These are all FIA awards which are presented at an official '''FIA Historic Awards''' event.

HFO also presents its own awards at a slightly less formal and usually much more boisterous event as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
'''The Chairman’s Trophy''' - Introduced in 2009 Tony Smith, this is awarded to the competitor who, in the chairman‘s opinion, best "exhibits" the “Spirit of the Championship”.

'''The Geoff Richardson Trophy''' - Provided by an engine builder, the trophy is awarded to the best newcomer.

'''The Nicholson McLaren Trophy''' - Provided by another engine builder. This 'trophy' is awarded to the 'best' team.

'''The Ensign Trophy''' - Provided by the former CEO of HFO, Mike Wheatley, who is something of an Ensign fan, having 'raced' an example in HFO very successfully.

Although never a winner, the marque was at its peak during the class B period and this trophy goes to the winner of Class B.

'''The Colin Chapman Trophy''' – Provided by Clive Chapman and Classic Team Lotus. It is hard to imagine any historic category without a Colin Chapman Trophy but, as in HFO’s case, it is equally hard to determine which period it might be applied to since Chapman was responsible for so many 'innovations'.

After considering that Class C covers the period when ground effects, carbon fibre chassis and the controversial twin chassis Lotus Type 88 all emerged from Chapman's expertise, it was agreed that this trophy would go to the winner of Class C.

Meanwhile, the Bidens took a limousine to [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]] where they boarded a train for [[Dover, Delaware]]. Before the luncheon and in keeping with tradition, President Trump signed his first presidential orders in the [[President's Room]] at the Capitol,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/2017/live-updates/politics/live-coverage-of-trumps-inauguration/trump-signs-documents-to-formalize-his-new-role/ |title=Trump signs documents to formalize his new role |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=January 23, 2017 |date=January 20, 2017 |author=Hedgpeth, Dana |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120205105/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/2017/live-updates/politics/live-coverage-of-trumps-inauguration/trump-signs-documents-to-formalize-his-new-role/ |archivedate=January 20, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then signed the guest book for the luncheon.

As former President and Mrs. Obama began their journey to a vacation in California, the Trumps and Pences joined several congressional guests for the inaugural luncheon in [[National Statuary Hall]] at the U.S. Capitol. Guests included top Washington lawmakers as well as former presidents and vice presidents.

A luncheon at the U.S. Capitol has been part of the inaugural program since 1953 (before that time, the luncheon was usually held at the White House and hosted by the outgoing President and First Lady). The menu for the 2017 inaugural luncheon, which in the past has often featured dishes representative of the home states of the new President and Vice President, included more traditional dishes from around the country.&lt;ref name="menu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/17/politics/trump-inaugural-lunch-menu/ |title=Here's Donald Trump's inaugural lunch menu |publisher=CNN |accessdate=January 23, 2017 |date=January 17, 2017 |author=Mueller, Eleanor |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170121114047/http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/17/politics/trump-inaugural-lunch-menu/ |archivedate=January 21, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first course consisted of [[Maine lobster]] and Gulf shrimp with saffron sauce and peanut crumble, accompanied by a [[J.

Organized and hosted by the [[Global Risk Forum]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grforum.org GRF Davos]&lt;/ref&gt; The '''International Disaster and Risk Conference''' IDRC is a global gathering of experts for [[Disaster Risk Reduction|risk reduction]], [[disaster management]], and [[climate change adaptation]]. IDRCs are held as a biennial conference in [[Davos]], Switzerland and complemented every other year with regional conferences hosted in different regions of the world and  endorse the [[UNISDR]] [[Global Platform]] meetings (GP in 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2015).

The IDRC conferences promote the integral risk management approach – across subject areas, professions, and sectors – encompassing scientific understanding with business, policy responses, the media and citizen participation. The IDRCs encourage stronger ties with adequate public-private partnership models and devising approaches for moving towards a more truly integrative way of thinking about disaster and risks.

Additional conferences and workshops dealing with specific disaster and risk topics may be organized in Davos or elsewhere. The conferences and workshops aim to provide solutions for effective and efficient global disaster and risk management and climate change adaptation. These issues need the involvement of all stakeholders of the public and the private sector.

Originally organized by the [[Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL]], since 2007 IDRCs are organised by the [[Global Risk Forum]] [[GRF Davos]]. Patronage of IDRC include the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation SDC, UN organisations such as [[UNESCO]], [[UN ISDR]], [[UNDP]], [[UNEP]] and [[ILO]] as well as the private sector like [[SWISS RE]].

IDRC conferences and workshops contribute to harmonizing risk reduction and disaster management with climate change adaptation measures. The IDRC Conferences provide an ideal platform for assessment and dissemination activities, as well as for networking activities.

The next IDRC conference will be held from 28 August to 1 September 2014 in Davos, Switzerland.

==Outcomes of the IDRCs==

===IDRC 2010===
The International Disaster and Risk Conference IDRC Davos 2010 with its motto “Risk, Disasters, Crisis and Global Change – From Threats to Sustainable Opportunities” was a milestone toward the integration of the ever more complex and interwoven portfolio of risk, security and disaster related topics, themes and trends as addressed by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon in his message to IDRC Davos 2010.

At IDRC Davos 2010 some 850 conference participants from 100 countries all over the world have gathered in a unique setting and atmosphere. High-ranking delegations from The Gambia, Uganda, Republic of the Congo, from the I.R.Iran, from India, P.R. China, and Indonesia participated.

Thirteen plenary sessions, around 50 special and parallel sessions, side events, poster sessions, exhibitions, workshops, training courses and cultural events provided the frame for this worthwhile undertaking. It is remarkable to realize how far the formerly fragmented, global risk and disaster community has grown into one distinctive body of excellence.

To increase the interaction and exchange knowledge and ideas, GRF transformed the concentrated collection of ideas and knowledge presented at IDRC Davos 2010 into an interactive portfolio of presentations, video recorded plenary sessions and video statements.

===IDRC 2014===
Over 700 participants from more than 80 countries attended the conference, including participants, from the United Nations and international organizations; from NGOs, the private sector, science and the media.

With 9 keynote presentations, 15 special panels, 85 sessions, 5 workshops, 78 posters, 23 panellists and 311 presenters; 5 book presentations; 4 lunch cinemas, the IDRC Davos continues to be a tradition of bringing together different actors and stakeholders to take stock of the progress made in integrative risk management and to suggest ways forward to improve risk management.

The outcomes of the IDRC Davos 2014 shall serve as the science &amp; technology input for the post-2015 framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (HFA2) and provide recommendations towards the UN World Conference WCDRR in Sendai, Japan. An outcomes report will be published in due time.

'''Jetseta Marrie Gage''' (August 25, 1994 – March 24, 2005) was an American child whose kidnapping, rape and murder prompted major changes in sentencing laws for those who commit child [[sex crime]]s in [[Iowa]]. Roger Bentley, a convicted [[sex offender]] and friend of Gage's family, was arrested in connection with 10-year-old Jetseta's death. He was convicted of first-degree murder and first-degree kidnapping on January 31, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mike|last=McWilliams|title=Bentley guilty|work=[[Iowa City Press-Citizen]]|date=2006-02-01|page=1A}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 24, he was sentenced to two consecutive mandatory sentences of life in prison without parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bentley gets two consecutive life sentences |url=http://www.kcci.com/news/7379084/detail.html |work=[[KCCI]] |date=2006-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905195827/http://www.kcci.com/news/7379084/detail.html |archivedate=2006-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The crime==
Prosecutors alleged that Bentley took Gage from her home to a run-down trailer in rural [[Johnson County, Iowa]], where he raped and killed her. An  [[AMBER Alert]] was issued shortly after it was noticed that the young girl was missing. The [[AMBER Alert]] program had errors that night. A proper description with name and picture did not appear until hours after she had vanished. Bentley was arrested a day later. Investigators found her body inside a bathroom cabinet inside the trailer.

Bentley's trial was moved to [[Scott County, Iowa|Scott County]] on the defense's [[change of venue]] motion because of extensive [[publicity|pre-trial publicity]]; local media dubbed the case "Justice for Jetseta." During his trial, prosecutors linked [[DNA]] evidence found on Gage's body to Bentley, while the defense (which did not call any witnesses) claimed there were no eyewitnesses to the crime or direct evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mike|last=McWilliams|title=Defense says Bentley dabbled in black magic|work=Iowa City Press-Citizen|date=2006-01-28|page=1A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mike|last=McWilliams|title=Judge: Evidence of guilt exists|work=Iowa City Press-Citizen|date=2006-01-31|page=3A}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took just over two hours for the jury to arrive at its guilty verdict.

Bentley’s brother, 34-year-old James Bentley, was indicted in November 2004 on felony sexual abuse charges after authorities alleged he sexually abused Gage between 2002 and 2004. The Bentley brothers were not strangers to the family. Gage's mother had dated both men and allowed the brothers contact with her children. James Bentley was found guilty of second-degree sexual abuse at the [[Clarke County, Iowa|Clarke County]] courthouse in [[Osceola, Iowa]], on August 1, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Erin |last=Jordan |title=Tears of relief, joy flow as Bentley found guilty |url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080802/NEWS01/808020336/1001/NEWS |work=[[The Des Moines Register]] |date=2008-08-02 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 1, 2007, a federal judge in Cedar Rapids found James Bentley guilty of six counts of [[child pornography]] and [[Sexual slavery|sexual exploitation]] charges in a separate trial. Bentley was accused of taking explicit photos of Gage and another infant girl in late 2003 and transporting those photos with him to [[Arkansas]] shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dorothy de Souza|last=Guedes|title=Bentley guilty on all counts|url=http://www.gazetteonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070301/NEWS/70301013&amp;SearchID=73282340915832|work=[[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)|The Gazette]]|date=2007-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to life in prison without parole on June 12, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Federal Judge Sentences Bentley To 100 Years |url=http://www.kcci.com/news/13488589/detail.html |work=[[KCCI]] |date=2007-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201346/http://www.kcci.com/news/13488589/detail.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers and broadcasters affiliated with the [[Associated Press]] named the Jetseta Gage murder as Iowa's top news story of 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AP picks top stories of 2005|work=The Gazette|date=2005-12-30|page=3B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
In 2005, the [[Iowa General Assembly]] passed a bill extending prison sentences and strengthening supervision of sex offenders – through methods such as electronic monitoring – upon their release from prison.

Also, numerous local governments throughout the state moved swiftly to enact stricter residency restrictions for sex offenders. Like a number of other states, Iowa already had a moratorium barring those on the [[Sex offender registries in the United States|sex offender registry]] from living within {{convert|2000|ft|m}} of a [[school]] or state-registered [[day care]] center, and local officials proposed expanding the buffer zone to such child-oriented places as libraries, parks and swimming pools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Associated Press|title=Possible High Court case seen in Iowa|url=http://www.qctimes.com/articles/2005/11/12/news/nation_world/doc4375959f173fb710859883.txt|work=[[Quad-City Times]]|date=2005-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some cities and county governments passed such ordinances, other governments – such as the city of [[Davenport, Iowa|Davenport]] and [[Scott County, Iowa|Scott County]] – were cool to the proposal and ultimately did not enact the tighter restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tom|last=Saul|title=City cool to sex offender law expansion|url=http://www.qctimes.com/articles/2005/12/06/news/local/doc439531a83cb4c957980386.txt|work=Quad-City Times|date=2005-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=County won't expand sex offender law|work=[[North Scott Press]]|date=2005-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics contended that the stricter residency proposals had several flaws, most notably:

* Those on the [[Sex offender registries in the United States|sex offender registry]] for less-severe cases – such as a 19-year-old boy charged after having consensual sex with his 15-year-old girlfriend – would face the same residency restrictions as a violent predator.
* It would not prevent offenders from going to a school (e.g., to attend a sporting event) or other locations covered by the proposed residency restrictions; rather, it would merely preclude them from declaring residency near those places.

In January 2006, 45 members of the [[Iowa General Assembly|Iowa Senate]] – 23 [[Iowa Democratic Party|Democrat]]s and 22 [[Republican Party of Iowa|Republican]]s – co-sponsored a bill increasing the penalties for those convicted of certain sex crimes, including lascivious acts with a child and sexual exploitation of a minor. Under the proposal, a first-time offender would face a mandatory minimum 25-year prison sentence upon conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Todd|last=Dorman|title=Sex offenders might face 25-years-to-life sentences|url=http://www.qctimes.com/articles/2006/02/28/news/local/doc4403dd1116d2a779293662.txt|work=Quad-City Times|date=2006-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Iowans, including the Gage family, have called for a restoration of the [[capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]], particularly for crimes in which children are raped and killed. Iowa abolished capital punishment in 1965, and is one of 12 states that currently do not have a death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dustin|last=Lemmon|title=Life in prison not enough for Jetseta's family|url=http://www.qctimes.com/articles/2006/02/01/news/local/doc43e05907ed090293194647.txt|work=Quad-City Times|date=2006-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Erin|last=Jordan|author2=Traci Finch|title=Bentley convicted|work=[[The Des Moines Register]]|date=2006-02-01|page=1B}}&lt;/ref&gt; A GOP-sponsored bill failed to pass in 2005, and no action has been taken since.

Watercolor over pencil&lt;br&gt;National Archives of Canada, Ottawa (Accession No. 1989-472-1)]]

In [[New France]] and in modern [[Missouri]], a '''King's Ball''' is a celebration held on [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] (''La fête des rois''), or some later time before [[Lent]].

The tradition was brought to the [[New World]] by [[Catholic]] [[émigrés]]. The parties lasted throughout the night and into the next day, when a late morning breakfast was served. Music, dancing and fine food were always important elements of the event. But the centerpiece of the annual celebration was the selection of the royal personage.

As in other European Epiphany celebrations, a ''[[Galette des Rois]]'' was baked, with a bean hidden in it. The man who found the bean in his slice was crowned King of the festivities; he selected his Queen, and they reigned over the year's festivities. More recently, a small [[Christ]] child trinket has been substituted for the bean.

{{quote|In the old French towns of Upper Louisiana, at the feast of Epiphany, on Twelfth Night a cake was served to the ladies, into which had been kneaded, before the baking, four beans. Each lady whose slice of cake contained a bean became a queen of the revels, and she in turn chose, a gentleman to be her king, signifying her preference by presenting him a bouquet. The four kings thus chosen and duly proclaimed became the patrons of the first of a series of old-time entertainments known as the "kings' balls." At the Twelfth Night festival the time was fixed for the first of these balls, and at the close of this ball the queens selected four more kings, who, in turn, proclaimed four new queens for the next ball. The series of festivities thus inaugurated lasted until Shrove Tuesday and the carnival. All who were present at the Twelfth Night festivities were expected to attend the king's balls without further bidding.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of the History of Missouri by [[Howard Louis Conrad]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|About the 6th of January, in each year, which is called Le Jour de Rais, a party is given, and four beans are baked in a large cake; this cake is distributed amongst the gentlemen, and each one who receives a bean, is proclaimed king. These four kings are to give the next ball. These are called "king balls." These kings select each one a queen, and make her a suitable present. They arrange all things necessary for the dancing party.

In these merry parties, no set supper is indulged in. They go there not to eat, but to be and make merry. They have refreshments of cake and coffee served round at proper intervals. Sometimes bouillon, as the French call it, takes the place of coffee. Toward the close of the party, the old queens select each one a new king, and kisses him to qualify him into office; then each new king chooses his new queen, and goes thro' the ceremony as before. In this manner the king balls are kept up all the carnaval.&lt;ref&gt;The Pioneer History of Illinois by [[John Reynolds (US politician)|John Reynolds]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This is a '''list of [[LGBT]] conferences in [[Singapore]]'''.

==2003==
===Homosexuality and Homophobia: Applied Psychotherapeutic Issues for Counsellors===
A day-long conference held in August 2003, by [[SPACES]], a private counseling agency. It was groundbreaking in that it was the first widely advertised seminar organized by a predominantly gay volunteer organization which dealt with [[homosexuality]] in a scientific and balanced manner. Any previous public talk had to avoid portraying homosexuality as normal, or else the police would not issue a license to allow it to proceed.

===3rd International Convention of Asia Scholars (ICAS3)===
Held from 19–22 August 2003 at the [[Raffles City Convention Centre]], it was hosted and co-organised by the [[National University of Singapore]]'s Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. It drew over 1000 participants from around the world, almost all of whom were academics. Over 900 papers were presented. The conference was a landmark in that its programme included the most papers touching on sexuality and [[transgend]] issues ever assembled in Singapore. The 60-80 queer scholars who flew in for the conference were the largest group of queer academics meeting at a local venue at the same time.

Many felt that the theme of sexuality and transgenderism fielded more papers than any other, such as IndoChinese history or modern Chinese politics. Altogether 10 panels (each with about 4 papers) discussed topics on sexuality and transgenderism. They were: 		 
*Male same-sex cultures in SE Asia and the Asian American Diaspora	
*Gender and sexuality in recent Chinese cinema	
*Same sex cultures in Taiwan	
*Sexualities and transgenderism	
*Gender performance and identity politics	
*Asian transgender and transsexual cultures I &amp; II
*Asian homosexualities, globalisation and medicalisation	
*Sexual identities and social histories	
*Female same-sex cultures in East and Southeast Asia	
Some of the academics from [[Australia]] and other Western countries had wondered, before the conference, whether their papers would be accepted, considering that the conference was to be held in Singapore, and the NUS would play a big part in its organisation. Academic and activist [[Russell Heng]] felt they need not have worried as NUS had actually pitched for it.

===Homosexuality: Myths and Truths===
Held from 25–28 November 2003 by the Singapore chapter of the controversial US-linked organisation [[Focus on the Family]]. This despite the organisers having received protest letters and a statement issued by the [[AFFIRM Network]], a US-based group of psychologists, which highlighted "serious ethical and scientific concerns" about "[[reparative therapy]]" for gays and lesbians. The letter listed three "serious problems" which the Singaporean public should have been made aware of if they were considering attending at the event. Recipients of the letter included ''[[The Straits Times]]'', the [[Singapore Psychological Society]], the [[California Psychological Association Ethics Committee]] and [[Melvin Wong]], Ph.D., the [[California]]-based speaker of the seminars. The series of seminars, which was supported by the Metropolitan YMCA, the YMCA of Singapore, the Salvation Army, the Boys' Brigade and the State-run and funded [[National Council of Social Service]] (NCCS), covered topics such as "Preventing Homosexuality", "Recovery Therapy" and "[[Ego-dystonic sexual orientation|Unwanted Homosexuality]]: Steps to Early Detection and Prevention". [[People Like Us 3|People Like Us]] (PLU) had also sent a different set of letters to the NCCS, the Ministry of Community Development, volunteer organisations and the media highlighting that the claims purported by the seminar's organisers were contrary to the opinions of the mainstream medical community. One of the main points of contention was that voluntary welfare organisations were eligible to receive a 70% training grant from the NCCS if they attended, according to the seminar brochure. The NCCS subsequently withdrew its previously-offered training grant to participants on the grounds of the speaker, Dr. [[Melvin Wong]]'s lack of qualifications.

==2004==
===The Lovers' Lecture series===
In March 2004, [[The Fun Stage]], a theatre group, applied to the [[Public Entertainment Licensing Unit]] ([[PELU]]), which is under the [[Singapore Police Force]] and handles the licensing of public lectures and forums, for permits to hold three talks at [[SPACE 21]], 21 [[Tanjong Pagar Road]]. These were to be lead-up events to their play "Lovers' Words", scheduled for mid-April 2004. The 3 talks entitled the "Lovers' Lecture Series" were meant for academics, arts practitioners and critics. Its scheduled programmed was as follows:
*6 March 2004- Same Sex Love in Chinese Culture (in Mandarin) by Dr. [[Tan Chong Kee]] (Chairman, [[The Necessary Stage]]) and Mr. [[Ng Wai Choy]] (Artistic Director, [[Wayang Merah]]).
*20 March 2004- The Politics of Gay Literature by [[Jason Wee]] (Editor of Vehicle, an arts magazine) and [[Alfian bin Sa'at]] (Playwright, Asian Boys Vol. 1 and 2 amongst others).
*27 March 2004- Open Forum: 1) Placement of the Minority (Majority) in the Majority (Minority) and 2) a discussion on the book People Like Us- Sexual Minorities in Singapore. Panelists were to include [[Jason Wee]] (Chair), [[Richard Chua]] (Artistic Co-Director, [[The Fun Stage]]), [[Lee Weng Choy]] (Artistic Co-Director, [[The Substation]]), [[Lena Lim]] ([[Select Bookstore]] Singapore), [[Benny Lim]] (Artistic Co-Director, [[The Fun Stage]]), [[Alvin Tan]] (Artistic Director, [[The Necessary Stage]]).
:The seminars eventually had to be cancelled because in a letter dated 4 March 2004, the Assistant Director of Operations, Police, replied to [[Richard Chua]], the Artistic Co-Director of [[The Fun Stage]], saying that it would be "contrary to public interest" to grant them the necessary permits.

===Legislating sexual behaviour- should the State be in our bedrooms?===
A forum held on 29 March 2004, organised by the [[National University of Singapore Society]] ([[NUSS]]) at [[Kent Ridge Guild Hall]]. The main speaker was activist [[Alex Au]] who argued that resolving the question of whether the State should be regulating the sexual choices of consenting adults depended on whether the State was a paternalistic or liberal one. In the former case, the State's default tendency was to regulate, and one would have to present positive reasons for it not to. The opposite applied in the liberal paradigm. Au used the example of homosexuality to show how weak the arguments for regulating sexual behaviour in a liberal context were, even for such a contentious issue. The other speaker was Associate Professor [[Michael Hor]], Faculty of Law, [[National University of Singapore|NUS]] who dissected [[section 377]] and [[section 377A]] of the [[Penal Code]], discussed some pertinent cases and also delved into constitutional principles involved. He touched on the reasoning used by the US Supreme Court in the Lawrence vs Texas case, and how such reasoning might apply in Singapore's constitutional provisions.

==2005==
===Singapore Forum on Politics 2005- Towards an Open and Inclusive Society===
*Held on Saturday, 26 February 2005, organized by the [[Department of Political Science]], [[National University of Singapore|NUS]] with the support of [[Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung]]. The five speakers were [[Nizam Bin Ismail]] (President, Young [[Association of Muslim Professionals]] (AMP)), [[Alfian bin Sa'at]] (poet and playwright), [[Alex Au]] (gay activist), [[Eleanor Wong (playwright)|Eleanor Wong]] (Associate Professor, NUS Law Faculty) and [[Asad Usman]] (Senior Correspondent, [[The Straits Times]]). It was chaired by [[Kenneth Paul Tan]] (Assistant Head, Political Science Department, NUS).

===Loving Myself - Two Gay Pilgrims Journeying Life===
Held on Tuesday, 1 March 2005, it was the first workshop organised by [[Oogachaga]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oogachaga.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;-[[Looking Glass (organization)|Looking Glass]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060209225806/http://www.geocities.com/lookgglass/]&lt;/ref&gt; the non-profit lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and straight affirming counseling service. This was part of regular personal development and growth workshops for lesbians, gays and their friends which were to take place on the first Tuesday of every other month in 2005.

[[Clarence Singam]] and [[Eileena Lee]] shared their own journeys of growth into self acceptance and affirmation. Eileena and Clarence shared the lessons they learned about being human, being strong, finding empathy and learning to love from their unique and yet common journeys. They shared their ups and downs, their self rejections, their own healing and the celebration of their selfhoods. The sharing was followed by a question and answer session, to engage Eileena and Clarence further.

===The Pink Dollar in the Singaporean context===
A dialogue held on Saturday, 12 March 2005 as part of an event curated by [[Ong Keng Sen]] of [[TheatreWorks (Singapore)|Theatreworks]], under the umbrella of the [[National Arts Council Singapore|National Arts Council]]-funded [[Singapore Season]]. It took place at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]], [[London]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]. [[PLU3]]'s [[Alex Au]] was one of the panelists at the dialogue.

===Coming Home To Our Families- To Tell or Not to Tell?===
Held on Tuesday, 3 May 2005, the second in the series of [[Oogachaga]]-[[Looking Glass (organization)|Looking Glass]] workshops. A panel of 3 gay persons (Kok Wei, [[Dominic Chua]] and [[Eileena Lee]]), 2 mothers and 2 brothers shared their journey of coming home to each other. What were the challenges they faced when they found out their family members were gay? What made these three gay persons share their lives as gay people to their families? If they could do it all over again, would they? How would they do it differently?

===Loving A Partner- What It Means and What It Takes===
Held on Tuesday, 5 July 2005, the third in the series of [[Oogachaga]] workshops.

It explored the multitude of challenges, from a lack of role models and social support to dealing with one's own and one's partner's hangups. Questions tackled were: What makes a healthy relationship? How does one deal with trials that pop up in every relationship? How does one negotiate one's relationship commitments? What sacrifices does one have to make to maintain a relationship? How does one's biological families fit in, if at all? A panel of gay and lesbian persons shared the ups &amp; downs and joys &amp; sorrows of their relationships. Speaker Kim shared the twists and turns of his 20-year partnership with Leong. Jo and Jorg talked about their long distance stint and why they decided to get married after a 10-year partnership. The panelists shared the lessons they learned about being human, being strong, finding empathy and learning to love from their unique and yet common journeys.

===Sexualities, Genders and Rights in Asia: 1st International Conference of Asian Queer Studies===
[[Sexualities, Genders and Rights in Asia]] was organised by the [[Australian National University]] and [[Mahidol University]] and held in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]] from 7–9 July 2005. The conference had difficulties raising funds because many donors had been exhausted by the recent [[tsunami]] relief effort. Furthermore, many of them also had policies where their contributions should be linked to health issues. This made it hard for the conference to include thematic streams that dealt with identity and representation not connected with HIV/AIDS. Singapore's [[People Like Us 3]] rendered financial assistance which made possible the "Cinema and Media" thematic stream, in particular the panel on Asian Queer Filmmakers, by funding scholarships for speakers from poorer countries who would present papers on this subject. [[Fridae]] was also another proud Singaporean sponsor of the conference. Over 200 papers were presented, including studies by Singaporean and Singapore-based researchers.
*Singaporean PhD student (at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]] in the [[United States|U.S.]]) [[Christopher Tan Kok Kee]] presented a paper entitled "Pinking the Lion City: Interrogating Singapore's Gay Civil Servant Statement". Abstract: Even though it has been 20 years since the separate emergence of queer and Southeast Asian studies within anthropology, the state of being queer and Southeast Asian is still heavily under-articulated. This paper seeks to fill this gap by critiquing the survivalist strategies of Singapore's 2003 statement that promises equal employment opportunities to gay civil servants. Singapore embrace of sexual minorities is indicative of a move by neoliberalist states to attract the 'creative class' by being highly tolerant of 'difference', similar to what [[Richard Florida]] (2002) argued with respect to American cities. Despite the significance of this measure, this paper argues that it is not only ineffective because of its inherent contradictions, it is also politically problematic. Homosexuality still remains criminalized in Singapore because of antiquated British colonial laws. The state-regulated media also continues to demonize homosexuality as a symptom of Western decadence as it valorises the heterosexual patriarchal family as a prop to a declining birth rate. Interrogating Singapore's gay civil servant statement can not only reveal the state of being queer and Southeast Asian, it can also illuminate the limits of neo-liberal policies that embrace 'difference' within the confines of the capitalist logic.
:Tan argued that Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]]’s June 2003 statement, that the Government would employ gays even in 'sensitive' positions provided that these civil servants openly declared their sexual orientation, was not a discourse of tolerance. Data gathered from Tan's fieldwork suggested that while gay Singaporeans welcomed the statement, they also strongly doubted the Government’s sincerity. When civil servants in Tan's survey pool were asked whether their individual ministries or statutory boards had done anything to realise the statement, the answer was a uniformly resounding 'No!'
*Clarence Singam ([[Oogachaga]] Counseling and Support) presented "Developing LGBT Affirmative Support Groups within Singaporean Postmodernity". Abstract: Singapore today, stands between modernity and post-modernity where contradictory narratives of identity battle for dominance. Two increasingly dominant narratives are that of the nation as a successful economic entity and that of Christian fundamentalism. The former asserts that Singapore's survival requires her to become a creative society open to diverse ideas. However this requires celebrating diversity; including [[sexual diversity]]. Thus the issue of gay freedom of expression has been a focal point in the public debate on societal diversity. This push towards diversity has however thrown segments of Singapore's population into identity crises. It has resulted in the growth of a minority though vociferous Christian fundamentalism that adopts the discourses of the religious right wing in the United States. Vocal segments of this population believe they are divinely mandated to stem the rise of lesbigay acceptance in Singapore. These battles are often fought in the public sphere via the discourses of Asian and family values, sexual abstinence as the primary anti-HIV message and allowing religious voices in the political space. This paper will trace the evolution of gay support groups within this terrain of meta-narrative conflicts. It will explore the types of support groups in existence, the strategies employed in planting and nurturing these groups, the obstacles faced and the impact these groups have had on the Singaporean discourse on diversity. The paper will explore the development of religious and social activity based lesbigay affirmative support groups as well as recent community experimentation on straight-gay partnerships.
*Andrea Goh, Melissa Say, Gerald Tan and Frederick Tong, ([[Nanyang Technological University]]) presented "Probing Pink Porn: The perceived value of sexual content for homosexual and heterosexual audiences". Abstract: Singapore law requires consideration of the literary, artistic, social, cultural, educational and scientific value of media content in deciding whether it is objectionable. Responses to structured depth interviews with 40 adults aged under 30 (equal numbers of homosexuals and heterosexuals) were analysed to determine the perceived value of sexual content targeted at homosexual and heterosexual audiences. Input from lawyers, media practitioners and members of the Media Authority's various committees was also analysed.
*Ying Wuen Wong, ([[National University of Singapore]]) presented "The Making of a Local Queen in an International Transsexual Beauty Contest". Abstract: This paper analyses the situation of an international transsexual beauty contest in a discourse of imitation and approximation dominated by Western notions of beauty and femininity. Transsexual beauty contests provide a stage to perform transsexual femininity on the one hand, but subject its participants to imitation of mainstream notions of beauty and femininity on the other. Although transsexual beauty contests market and project a transsexual identity for its participants, pageant participants are expected to perform and imitate femininity and are assessed based on their ability to transgress the gender boundary. A local beauty contest is then compelled to imitate an international one, in a bid to produce a "winner" that matched the mould of beauty constructed by this assessment. Such notions of aesthetics and representation (of one's country and culture) is determined by the discourse of power, both within and without the beauty pageant. This paper will use ethnographic details of both local and international transsexual beauty contests held in Thailand and Singapore in 2004.
*Dr. [[K.K. Seet]], ([[National University of Singapore]]) presented "Progression or Regression? - The 'Gay Teen Summer Romance' as Popular Phenomenon in Taiwanese Cinema".
*Brian Curtin, ([[Raffles LaSalle International Design School]]) presented "Thailand's Gay Male Sexual Cultures and the Problem of Visual Representation".
*Kenneth Chan, ([[Nanyang Technological University]]) presented "Rice Sticking Together: Desire and the Cinematic Representation of Caucasian-Chinese Relationships".
* Day Wong, ([[National University of Singapore]]) presented "Beyond Identity Politics - The Making of an Oral History of Women who Love Women in Hong Kong".

===IndigNation===
{{Main|IndigNation: Singapore's first gay pride month}}
In August 2005, gay activists, bolstered by broad-based grassroots support organised Singapore's inaugural month-long [[gay pride]] celebration called [[IndigNation]]. The latter moniker was a clever play of words representing the gay community's displeasure at the unexpected official ban of the annual Nation mega-parties which had been approved and held without incident 4 years in a row prior to 2005.

===Same-sex love in classical Chinese literature===
The first talk of the "festival" was delivered in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] by Dr. [[Tan Chong Kee]] to a capacity audience at 7:30pm on 2 August 2005 at [[Xposé Café, Bar and Restaurant]]. Its management allowed free use of the premises to conduct the historic event, namely, the first widely advertised talk on homosexuality, open to all and held in a public indoor venue ever to take place in Singapore since Prime Minister [[Lee Hsien Loong]]'s 2004 liberalisation of the rules governing public talks in indoor areas. Dr. Tan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fridae.com/newsfeatures/article.php?articleid=1492&amp;viewarticle=1&amp;nextrecord=0&amp;currentpageno=1&amp;searchtype=all&amp;pageno=1]&lt;/ref&gt; who had conducted extensive research into [[Culture of China|Chinese civilization]], challenged the notion that same-sex love was contrary to [[Culture of Asia|Asian culture]]. He traced and explored various ancient classical Chinese texts to demonstrate that same-sex love had been an integral part of Asian life.

U.S. recessions have increasingly affected economies on a worldwide scale, especially as countries' economies [[Economic globalization|become more intertwined]].

The unofficial beginning and ending dates of '''recessions in the United States''' have been defined by the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] (NBER), an American [[Privately held company|private]] nonprofit research organization. The NBER defines a [[recession]] as "a significant decline in economic activity spread across the [[Economy of the United States|economy]], lasting more than two quarters which is 6 months, normally visible in real [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=February 29, 2008|url=https://www.nber.org/cycles/recessions.html|title=The NBER's Recession Dating Procedure |publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research|date=October 21, 2003|author=Hall, Robert }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The rule of thumb defining recession as two [[Fiscal year|quarters]] of negative GDP growth is not used by NBER.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The NBER's Recession Dating Procedure: Frequently Asked Questions|url=https://www.nber.org/cycles/recessions_faq.html|publisher=[[National Bureau of Economic Research]]|accessdate=October 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NBER looks for monthly dating (GDP is a quarterly figure) and GDP will sometimes be positive even in clear periods of decline, e.g. in the second quarter of 1974, GDP was slightly positive even in the middle of the severe [[1973–75 recession]].|group="nb"}}

In the 19th century, recessions frequently coincided with [[Financial crisis|financial crises]]. Determining the occurrence of pre-20th-century recessions is more difficult due to the dearth of [[economic statistics]], so scholars rely on historical accounts of economic activity, such as contemporary newspapers or business ledgers. Although the NBER does not date recessions before 1857, economists customarily extrapolate dates of U.S. recessions back to 1790 from business annals based on various contemporary descriptions. Their work is aided by historical patterns, in that recessions often follow external shocks to the [[economic system]] such as wars and variations in the weather affecting agriculture, as well as banking crises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=February 29, 2008|url=https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/nipa/2003/2003cr_newsrelease.htm|title=Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts 1929 through Second Quarter 2003|publisher=[[Bureau of Economic Analysis]]|date=December 10, 2003|author=Brent Moulton|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920053305/http://bea.gov/newsreleases/national/nipa/2003/2003cr_newsrelease.htm|archive-date=2008-09-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major modern economic statistics, such as [[unemployment]] and GDP, were not compiled on a regular and standardized basis until after World War II. The average duration of the 11 recessions between 1945 and 2001 is 10 months, compared to 18 months for recessions between 1919 and 1945, and 22 months for recessions from 1854 to 1919.&lt;ref name=NBER&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=October 1, 2008 |url=https://www.nber.org/cycles/ |title=NBER Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions |publisher=NBER }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the great changes in the economy over the centuries, it is difficult to compare the severity of modern recessions to early recessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year = 1986 | title = The American Business Cycle: Continuity and Change | chapter = Appendix A The Development and Role of the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Chronologies | last1 = Moore | first1 = Geoffrey H. | last2 = Zarnowitz |first2 = Victor | url = https://www.nber.org/chapters/c10035 }} in {{Harvnb|Gordon|1986|pp=743–745}}&lt;/ref&gt; No recession of the post-World War II era has come anywhere near the depth of the [[Great Depression]], which lasted from 1929 until 1941 and was caused by [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|the 1929 crash of the stock market]] and [[Causes of the Great Depression|other factors]].

== Early recessions and crises ==
Attempts have been made to date recessions in America beginning in 1790. These periods of recession were not identified until the 1920s. To construct the dates, researchers studied business annals during the period and constructed [[time series]] of the data. The earliest recessions for which there is the most certainty are those that coincide with major financial crises.&lt;ref name = Moore745/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thorp&gt;{{Cite book | title = Business Annals | author = Thorp, Willard Long | year = 1926 | publisher = [[National Bureau of Economic Research|NBER]] | isbn = 0-87014-007-8 | url = https://www.nber.org/books/thor26-1 | pages = 113–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1835, an index of business activity by the [[Cleveland Trust Company]] provides data for comparison between recessions. Beginning in 1854, the National Bureau of Economic Research dates recession peaks and troughs to the month.  However, a standardized index does not exist for the earliest recessions.&lt;ref name = Moore745&gt;{{Cite book | title= The American Business Cycle: Continuity and Change | year = 1986 | chapter = Appendix A The Development and Role of the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Chronologies | last1 = Moore | first1 = Geoffrey H. | last2 = Zarnowitz | first2 = Victor | url = https://www.nber.org/chapters/c10035 }} in {{Harvnb|Gordon|1986|p=747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1791, Congress chartered the [[First Bank of the United States]] to handle the country's financial needs. The bank had some functions of a modern central bank, although it was responsible for only 20% of the young country's currency. In 1811 the bank's charter lapsed, but it was replaced by the [[Second Bank of the United States]], which lasted from 1816–36.&lt;ref name=Thorp/&gt;

| The panic of 1785, which lasted until 1788, ended the business boom that followed the American Revolution. The causes of the crisis lay in the overexpansion and debts incurred after the victory at Yorktown, a postwar deflation, competition in the manufacturing sector from Britain, and lack of adequate credit and a sound currency. The downturn was exacerbated by the absence of any significant interstate trade. Other factors were the British refusal to conclude a commercial treaty, and actual and pending defaults among debtor groups. The panic among business and propertied groups led to the demand for a stronger federal government.

== Free Banking Era to the Great Depression ==

Compared to today, the era from 1834 to the Great Depression was characterized by relatively severe and more frequent banking panics and recessions.]]
In the 1830s, U.S. President [[Andrew Jackson]] fought to end the [[Second Bank of the United States]]. Following the [[Bank War]], the Second Bank lost its charter in 1836. From 1837 to 1862, there was [[Free banking era|no national presence in banking]], but still plenty of state and even local regulation, such as laws against branch banking which prevented diversification. In 1863, in response to financing pressures of the Civil War, Congress passed the [[National Banking Act]], creating [[History of central banking in the United States#1863–1913: National Banks|nationally chartered banks]]. There was neither a central bank nor deposit insurance during this era, and thus banking panics were common. Recessions often led to bank panics and financial crises, which in turn worsened the recession.

The dating of recessions during this period is controversial. Modern economic statistics, such as [[gross domestic product]] and unemployment, were not gathered during this period. [[Victor Zarnowitz]] evaluated a variety of indices to measure the severity of these recessions. From 1834 to 1929, one measure of recessions is the Cleveland Trust Company index, which measured business activity and, beginning in 1882, an index of trade and industrial activity was available, which can be used to compare recessions.&lt;ref group="nb" name=Zarn/&gt;

Following the severe [[Great Depression]], the post-[[World War II]] economy has seen long expansions and, for the most part, less severe recessions than in earlier American history.]]

Following the end of World War II and the large adjustment as the economy adjusted from wartime to peacetime in 1945, the collection of many economic indicators, such as unemployment and GDP, became standardized. Recessions after World War II may be compared to each other much more easily than previous recessions because of these available data. The listed dates and durations are from the official chronology of the National Bureau of Economic Research.&lt;ref name="NBER" /&gt; GDP data are from the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]], unemployment from the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] (after 1948). Note that the unemployment rate often reaches a peak associated with a recession after the recession has officially ended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/cps/ Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey], [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]. Retrieved on September 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

No recession of the post-World War II era has come anywhere near the depth of the Great Depression. In the Great Depression, GDP fell by 27% (the deepest after demobilization is the recession beginning in December 2007, during which GDP has fallen 5.1% as of the second quarter of 2009) and unemployment rate reached 10% (the highest since was the 10.8% rate reached during the 1981–82 recession).&lt;ref name=Labonte/&gt;

The [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] dates recessions on a monthly basis back to 1854; according to their chronology, from 1854 to 1919, there were 16 cycles. The average recession lasted 22 months, and the average expansion 27. From 1919 to 1945, there were six cycles; recessions lasted an average 18 months and expansions for 35. From 1945 to 2001, and 10 cycles, recessions lasted an average 10 months and expansions an average of 57 months.&lt;ref name=NBER/&gt; This has prompted some economists to declare that the business cycle has become less severe.&lt;ref name="Knoop 2004 166–71"&gt;{{Harvnb|Knoop|2004|pp=166–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Livonian Brothers of the Sword''' ({{lang-la|Fratres militiæ Christi Livoniae}}, {{lang-de|Schwertbrüderorden}}, {{lang-fr|Ordre des Chevaliers Porte-Glaive}}) was a  [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Military order (monastic society)|military order]] established by [[Albert of Riga|Albert]], the third [[bishop]] of Riga (or possibly by [[Theoderich von Treyden]]), in 1202. [[Pope Innocent III]] sanctioned the establishment in 1204 for the second time. The membership of the order comprised  [[Germans|German]] "warrior [[monk]]s" who fought Baltic and Finnic pagans in the area of modern-day Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.  Alternative names of the Order include '''Christ Knights''', '''Sword Brethren''', and '''The Militia of Christ of Livonia'''. The seal reads: ''+MAGISTRI ETFRM (et fratrum) MILICIE CRI (Christi) DE LIVONIA''.

Following their defeat by the [[Samogitians]] and [[Semigallians]] in the [[Battle of Saule|Battle of Schaulen (Saule)]] in 1236, the surviving Brothers merged into the [[Teutonic Order]] as an autonomous branch and became known as the [[Livonian Order]].

== History ==
[[Image:LivoniaKnight.jpg|thumb|left|240px|A [[Teutonic Order|Teutonic Knight]] on the left and a Swordbrother on the right.]]
Albert, Bishop of [[Riga]] (also called [[Prince-Bishop]] of [[Livonia]]) (or possibly Theoderich von Treyden),&lt;ref&gt;The Discovery of the Baltic The Reception of a Catholic World-System in the European North (AD 1075-1225) Blomkvist, Nils. 2004 (p.539)&lt;/ref&gt; founded the Brotherhood in 1202 to aid the [[Bishopric of Riga|Bishopric of Livonia]] in the conversion of the [[paganism|pagan]] [[Livonian people|Livonians]], [[Latgalians]] and [[Selonians]] living across the ancient trade routes from the [[Gulf of Riga]] eastwards. From its foundation, the undisciplined Order tended to ignore its supposed [[vassal]]age to the bishops. In 1218, Albert asked King [[Valdemar II of Denmark|Valdemar II]] of [[Denmark]] for assistance, but Valdemar instead arranged a deal with the Brotherhood and conquered [[Danish Estonia|northern Estonia]] (now known as Danish Estonia) for Denmark.

The Brotherhood had its headquarters at [[Viljandi|Fellin (Viljandi)]] in present-day [[Estonia]], where the walls of the Master's castle {{as of|2009|alt=still}} stand. Other strongholds included [[Cēsis|Wenden (Cēsis)]], [[Sigulda|Segewold (Sigulda)]] and [[Aizkraukle|Ascheraden (Aizkraukle)]]. The commanders of Fellin, [[Kuldīga|Goldingen (Kuldīga)]], [[Alūksne|Marienburg (Alūksne)]], [[Tallinn|Reval (Tallinn)]], and the [[bailiff]] of [[Paide|Weißenstein (Paide)]] belonged to the five-member entourage of the Order's Master.

[[Pope Gregory IX]] asked the Brothers to defend [[Finland]] from the [[Finnish-Novgorodian Wars|Novgorodian attacks]] in his letter of November 24, 1232.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://193.184.161.234/DF/detail.php?id=80 |title=Letter by Pope Gregory IX |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814083933/http://193.184.161.234/DF/detail.php?id=80 |archivedate=2007-08-14 }}. (In Latin) Hosted by the [http://www.narc.fi National Archive of Finland]. See [http://www.narc.fi/Arkistolaitos/sahkoiset/ ''Diplomatarium Fennicum''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608003759/http://www.narc.fi/Arkistolaitos/sahkoiset/ |date=2007-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no known information regarding the knights' possible activities in Finland has survived. ([[Sweden]] eventually conquered Finland following the [[Second Swedish Crusade]] in 1249.)

The Order was decimated in the [[Battle of Saule|Battle of Schaulen (Saule)]] in 1236 against [[Lithuanians]] and [[Semigallians]].&lt;ref name="Plakans44"&gt;Andrejs Plakans, ''A Concise History of the Baltic States'', (Cambridge University Press, 2011), 44.&lt;/ref&gt; This disaster led the surviving Brothers to become incorporated into the Order of [[Teutonic Knights]] in the following year, and from that point on they became known as the [[Livonian Order]].&lt;ref name="Plakans44"  /&gt; They continued, however, to function in all respects ([[monastic rule|rule]], clothing and policy) as an autonomous branch of the Teutonic Order, headed by their own Master (himself ''de jure'' subject to the Teutonic Order's [[Hochmeister|Grand Master]]).

'''Mars Orbiter Mission 2''' ('''MOM 2'''), also called '''''Mangalyaan 2''''' ("Mars-craft", from {{lang-sa|मंगल}} ''mangala'', "Mars" and यान ''yāna'', "craft, vehicle"), is [[India]]'s second interplanetary mission planned for launch to [[Mars]] by the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] (ISRO) in the 2022-2023 time frame.&lt;ref name="COSPAR2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="scimag-isro-20170217"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/02/india-eyes-return-mars-and-first-run-venus |title=India eyes a return to Mars and a first run at Venus |work=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |first=Pallava |last=Bagla |date=17 February 2017 |accessdate=1 May 2017 |doi=10.1126/science.aal0781}}&lt;/ref&gt; The orbiter will utilize [[aerobraking]] to lower its initial [[apoapsis]] and enter into an orbit more suitable for observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/With-82-launches-in-a-go-Isro-to-rocket-into-record-books/articleshow/55123860.cms |title=With 82 launches in a go, Isro to rocket into record books |work=[[The Times of India]] |agency=Times News Network |first=Srinivas |last=Laxman |date=29 October 2016 |access-date=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After the successful insertion of [[Mars Orbiter Mission]] into Martian orbit, ISRO announced its intent to launch a second mission to Mars on 28 October 2014 at the Engineers Conclave conference held in Bangalore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/it/isro-mars-misson-mars-orbiter-mission-chandrayaan-2-scientists/story/211826.html |title=We plan to launch 2nd Mars Mission in 2018, says ISRO satellite Centre Director |work=[[Business Today (India)|Business Today]] |agency=[[Indo-Asian News Service]] |date=30 October 2014 |accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed launch vehicle for this campaign is the [[Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III|GSLV Mk III]], which flew for the first time on 5 June 2017.&lt;ref name="times20170606"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gslv-mk-iii-breaks-isros-jinx-of-failure-in-debut-launches/articleshow/59008331.cms |title=GSLV Mk III breaks Isro's jinx of failure in debut rocket launches |work=[[The Times of India]] |agency=Times News Network |first=Surendra |last=Singh |date=6 June 2017 |accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the MOM&amp;nbsp;2 mission, the {{nowrap|GSLV Mk III}} would also launch ''[[Chandrayaan-2]]'' to the Moon in 2019.&lt;ref name="IBNLive201410"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ndtv20141030"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://gadgets.ndtv.com/science/news/mars-2-mission-to-launch-in-2018-says-isro-613969 |title=Mars-2 Mission to Launch in 2018, Says Isro |work=[[NDTV]] |agency=[[Indo-Asian News Service]] |date=30 October 2014 |accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, India and France signed a letter of intent for ISRO and [[CNES]] to jointly build MOM&amp;nbsp;2 by 2020,&lt;ref name="tecake20160128"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tecake.in/news/space/india-join-hands-france-next-mars-mission-scheduled-2020-16964.html |title=India's French Connection: CNES and ISRO jointly will develop Mangalyaan 2 |work=The TeCake |first=Kanishk |last=Singh |date=28 January 2016 |accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by April 2018, France was not yet involved in the mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/india-france-to-work-together-on-inter-planetary-missions/articleshow/63792194.cms |title=India, France to work together on inter-planetary missions |work=[[The Times of India]] |agency=Times News Network |first=Surendra |last=Singh |date=17 April 2018 |accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian government funded MOM&amp;nbsp;2 in its 2017 budget proposal, and ISRO is considering whether the best path is to conduct an [[orbiter]]/[[Lander (spacecraft)|lander]]/[[Rover (space exploration)|rover]] mission or to opt for only an orbiter with more sophisticated instruments than those flown on MOM.&lt;ref name="scimag-isro-20170217"/&gt;

==Development==

An Announcement of Opportunity was released requesting submissions for scientific instruments for an orbiter only, with a deadline set for 20 September 2016.&lt;ref name='AoP'&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.isro.gov.in/announcement-of-opportunity-ao-future-mars-orbiter-mission-mom-2 |title=Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for future Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM-2) |publisher=Indian Space Research Organisation |accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/science/isro-seeking-proposals-for-mars-orbiter-mission-2-4396357/ |title=ISRO seeking proposals for Mars Orbiter Mission-2 |work=[[The Indian Express]] |date=26 November 2016 |accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the science payloads under development is an [[ionosphere]] [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] instrument named ARIS. It is being developed by Space Satellite Systems and Payloads Centre (SSPACE), which is part of the [[Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology]] (IIST).

The '''Murder of Stephanie Roper''' involved a [[Frostburg State University]] student.  On April 3, 1982, Stephanie Roper, a 22-year-old, was kidnapped, repeatedly and brutally raped, tortured, shot, set afire, and partially dismembered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1985/05/21/roper-killers-get-more-prison-time-pg/1e32da04-0118-43d8-863d-f23cdcf03314/|title=Roper Killers Get More Prison Time P.G.|date=May 21, 1985|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder==
Roper was home on a college break, and she and a friend were returning from an evening with friends at a West End Washington, D.C. bar, the "Twenty-First Amendment" late at night. After dropping her friend off in [[Brandywine, Maryland]], Stephanie proceeded toward her own home in [[Croom, Maryland|Croom]], but her car became disabled on a dark rural road.  Two men stopped and instead of helping, kidnapped her at gunpoint. The two men, Jack Ronald Jones and Jerry Lee Beatty, kidnapped Stephanie and took her to an abandoned shack in [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]]. There she was tortured and raped repeatedly. One of the men called the other by his first name. Afraid now that Stephanie knew his name, they decided to kill her. Stephanie made several attempts to escape and upon her last capture, her skull was fractured with a logging chain and she was shot to death.  In order to hinder identification, the murderers burned her body and severed her hands. They were captured after the younger man bragged about his part in the crime. Both men were charged with kidnapping, rape, and felony murder.  The primary killer was convicted in [[Baltimore County, Maryland|Baltimore County]] while his co-defendant pleaded guilty to the same charges in [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland|Anne Arundel County]]. Both courts imposed sentences of two concurrent life sentences, with parole eligibility after twelve years.{{citation needed|date = April 2017}}

==Family response==
The Roper family was excluded from observing the trial and was denied the opportunity to present a victim impact statement at sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/1993/08/29/a-giant-hole-in-your-life/fd8afdab-fd3e-43c5-9672-ee22e333a0f6/|title='A Giant Hole in Your Life' |first=Paul |last=Duggan |date=August 29, 2003 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stephanie's mother, Roberta Roper, has taken on the cause of victims' rights, including the right of victims' families to address the court before sentencing. She actively lobbies and advocates for rights and support services to crime victims and their survivors. She and her husband, Vincent, formed the Stephanie Roper Committee and Foundation, Inc. and she served as its Executive Director for 20 years. The agency is now known as the Maryland Crime Victims' Resource Center, Inc. (MCVRC). Roberta Roper has dedicated her life to these causes. She serves as the Chair of the MCVRC Board of Directors and co-chairs the National Victims' Constitutional Amendment Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.somdnews.com/stories/052307/indycov94410_32162.shtml |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120909220836/http://www.somdnews.com/stories/052307/indycov94410_32162.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 9, 2012 |title=Reaching out to victims of crime |first=Andrea |last=Noble |date=May 23, 2007 |work=Southern Maryland Newspapers Online|accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crime Victims' Rights Act==
The [[Victims' Rights#Crime Victims' Rights Act of 2004|Crime Victims' Rights Act]] of 2004 was named, in part, for Stephanie Roper, whose parents were not notified of trial continuances, were excluded from proceedings, and were prevented from giving a [[victim impact statement]].

==Legacy==

===Maryland's annual Crime Victims and Advocates Commemorative Day===
In 2012, the Maryland General Assembly passed House Bill 766 (Chapter 678 of the Laws of Maryland 2012) which requires the Governor annually to proclaim April 3 as Crime Victims and Advocates Commemorative Day to give recognition to the individuals in the State who have become crime victims and to honor the advocates who serve those victims. In addition to issuing the proclamation, the Governor is also required to take appropriate steps to publicize Crime Victims and Advocates Commemorative Day. April 3 was chosen as the date for the commemorative day in memory of Stephanie Roper, who was murdered on that day in 1982 and whose family members established the Maryland Crime Victims' Resource Center, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlis.state.md.us/2012rs/billfile/hb0766.htm |title=BILL INFO-2012 Regular Session-HB 766 |date=26 June 2012 |work=Maryland General Assembly web site |publisher=Department of Legislative Services, Office of Information Systems |location=[[Annapolis, Maryland]] |accessdate=10 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stephanie Roper Highway===
On October 20, 2012, Maryland Governor [[Martin O'Malley]] issued a proclamation which named part of [[Maryland Route 4]] (the part of [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]] just north of Croom, and part of Southern Maryland Boulevard in adjacent [[Anne Arundel County]]) in honor of Stephanie Roper and the efforts of her parents Roberta and Vincent Roper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdcrimevictims.org/stephanie-roper-highway/|title=Stephanie Roper Highway|publisher=Mdcrimevictims.org|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Stephanie Roper Gallery at Frostburg State University===
The Stephanie Ann Roper Gallery is located in the Fine Arts Building on the Frostburg State University campus.{{citation needed|date = April 2017}}

===Roper Victim Assistance Academy===
The Roper Victim Assistance Academy trains victims' advocates.  The Roper Academy was created in 2003 through a grant from the [[United States Department of Justice]], [[Office for Victims of Crime]] received by the Maryland Governor's Office of Crime Control and Prevention in partnership with the [[University of Baltimore]].{{citation needed|date = April 2017}}

'''Music Hack Day''' is a [[Hack Day]] specifically for the music industry. The first was organised by Dave Haynes and James Darling and held at the London offices of [[The Guardian]] newspaper over the weekend 11/12 July 2009.

The event was attended by around 200 developers who had 24 hours to build new hacks or [[web applications]] using the [[API]]'s or tools of 10 participating companies. These companies were [[7digital]], BBC Music, [[The Echo Nest]], Gigulate, [[Last.fm]], PeoplesMusicStore, [[Songkick]], [[SoundCloud]]. The weekend also included workshops from companies like [[RjDj]] and Tinker.it and anyone else who wished to arrange one. Many developers stayed overnight at the venue and over 35 hacks were built, submitted and demo'ed by the end of the weekend.

Since that first event, more than 50 Music Hack Day events have taken place around the world, with over 3500 participants who have built over 1300 innovative hacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://musichackday.upf.edu/mhd/2015/?page_id=52 |title=About Music Hack Day - Hack Day Barcelona web site |publisher=http://musichackday.upf.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The events are attended by a diverse range of music and technology enthusiasts. A related event, that includes a music hack component, but with a broader focus on performance and research, is the [[Music Tech Fest]], a festival of music ideas that brings musicians, artists, hackers, academics and industry together.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4001">'''Nickanan Night''' (sometimes called Hall Monday or Peasen Monday) is a [[Cornwall|Cornish]] feast, traditionally held during [[Shrovetide]], specifically on the Monday before [[Lent]].&lt;ref&gt;MA Courtney Cornish feast and feasten cutoms&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes called roguery night in West [[Cornwall]], England, UK, this event was an excuse for local youths to undertake acts of minor [[vandalism]] and play practical jokes on neighbours and family.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cornish Traditional Year - Simon Reed''; 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The name Nickanan may come from the practice of knocking on doors and running away which is known as '[[Knock down ginger|Nicky nicky nine doors]]' in some parts of the English-speaking world. The eating of [[pea soup]] and salt bacon was also associated with this date.

==19th century description==
In the 19th century [[Thomas Quiller Couch]] described Nickanan Night.&lt;ref&gt;''Notes and Queries''; 1855.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day termed [[Shrove Monday|Hall Monday]], which precedes
[[Shrove Tuesday]], about the dusk of the evening, it is the
custom for boys, and, in some cases, for those who are
above the age of boys, to prowl about the streets with
short clubs, and to knock loudly at every door, running
off to escape detection on the slightest sign of a motion
within. If, however, no attention be excited, and especially
if any article be discovered negligently exposed, or
carelessly guarded, then the things are carried away;
and on the following day are discovered displayed in
some conspicuous place, to expose the disgraceful want of
vigilance supposed to characterise the owner. The time
when this is practised is called 'Nicka-nan night' and
the individuals concerned are supposed to represent some
imps of darkness, that seize on and expose unguarded
moments

==Traditional rhymes==
The following rhyme was used by the Cornish children during the evening and the following day [[Shrove Tuesday]].

Nicka nicka nan&lt;br&gt;
Give me some pancake, and then I'll be gone&lt;br&gt;
But if you give me none&lt;br&gt;
I'll throw a great stone&lt;br&gt;
And down your door shall come.

'''In [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]] this was''' 

Give me a pancake, now—now—now,&lt;br&gt;
Or I will souse in your door with a row—tow—tow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, Robert ''Popular Romances of the West of England''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trigg meat==
In coastal communities it was also traditional to gather shell fish such as [[limpets]], [[mussels]] and [[Common periwinkle|winkles]].  This practice was known as 'going a triggin' and the produce gathered known as 'trigg meat'.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cornish Year'' (a 19th-century booklet held by Penzance Library)&lt;/ref&gt; This is still practised at [[Easter]] by people living close to the [[Helford]] River.

==Jack o' Lent==
During this 'Nickanan' period another custom prevailed throughout Cornwall. In some villages it was usual to make a '[[Jack o' Lent]]' a straw figure dressed not unlike a [[Guy Fawkes Night]] guy. This Jack-o-Lent was paraded through local communities and  pelted with projectiles and then burned on a [[Bonfire]].&lt;ref&gt;Courtney. M. A. ''Cornish Feasts and Feasten Customs''&lt;/ref&gt; This practice was until the late 19th century common in [[Polperro]]. Fire rituals such as those associated with the Jack-O-Lent may also indicate Celtic pagan origins and may be closely related to the [[Imbolc]] festival.

==Hurling==
The popularity of [[Cornish Hurling]] during the 'Nickanan' season indicates similarity to St Ives feast and other festivities near [[Candlemas]]. The 'Hurling of the silver ball' at [[St Columb Major]] still occurs during the run up to Lent.

The '''North Sea Jazz Festival''' is an annual [[List of jazz festivals|festival]] held each second weekend of July in the [[Netherlands]] at the [[Ahoy Rotterdam|Ahoy]] venue. It used to be in [[The Hague]] but since 2006 it has been held in [[Rotterdam]]. This is because the [[Statenhal]] where the festival was held before was demolished in 2006. As of 3 November 2017 the festival officially will be known as the NN North Sea Jazz Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northseajazz.com/en/news/nn-group-titelsponsor-north-sea-jazz/|title=NN Group title sponsor of North Sea Jazz |website=www.northseajazz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
[[File:North Sea Jazz Festival 2012 - D'ANGELO 2.jpg|thumb|right|280px|D'Angelo performs at the North Sea Jazz Festival in Rotterdam in 2012.]]
The founder of the three-day festival was Paul Acket, a businessman and [[jazz]] lover who made a fortune in the 1960s with his pop magazine publishing company.&lt;ref name=apassion4jazz&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apassion4jazz.net/nsjf.html |title=Rotterdam North Sea Jazz Festival |publisher=APassion4Jazz.net |accessdate=2014-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=muziekencyclopedie&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.muziekencyclopedie.nl/action/entry/Paul+Acket |title=Paul Acket |work=Biography |publisher=MuzikEncyclopedie.nl |accessdate=2014-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Acket sold his company in 1975, he was able to start and sponsor the North Sea Jazz Festival. Acket wanted to present American jazz and European [[avant-garde jazz]]. In 1976 the first edition of the festival took place. It was an immediate success: six stages, thirty hours of music, and 300 performances drew over 9000 visitors. Acts included [[Count Basie]], [[Miles Davis]], [[Billy Eckstine]],  [[Stan Getz]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Benny Goodman]], and [[Sarah Vaughan]].

The Edison Jazz Awards and the [[Paul Acket Award|Bird Awards]] are presented at the North Sea Jazz Festival.&lt;ref name=artsholland&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ww.artsholland.com/port-rotterdam-north-sea-jazz-festival |title=Port of Rotterdam North Sea Jazz Festival - Biggest indoor jazz festival |publisher=ArtsHolland.com |date=2010-05-16 |accessdate=2014-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1990, two sub-festivals were introduced: North Sea Jazz Heats, a free festival performed in pubs throughout The Hague, and the more exclusive Midsummer Jazz Gala.&lt;ref name=artsholland/&gt; Both take place on the evening before the festival. Musicians that have performed at the Midsummer Jazz Gala include [[Tony Bennett]], [[Herbie Hancock]], and [[Oscar Peterson]]. [[Amy Winehouse]] performed at the festival in 2004. 

The festival has grown to fifteen stages, 1,200 musicians, and about 25,000 visitors a day.&lt;ref name=apassion4jazz/&gt; The festival presents concerts in [[Dixieland|New Orleans jazz]], [[Swing (genre)|swing]], [[Jazz fusion|fusion]], [[blues]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[funk music|funk]], [[soul music|soul]] and [[drum and bass]].

The festival is acknowledged as the "biggest indoor jazz festival in the world"&lt;ref name=artsholland/&gt; and has a reputation for showcasing different areas of jazz from all eras.&lt;ref name=artsholland/&gt;

'''Practolol''' ('''Eraldin''', '''Dalzic''', '''Praktol''', '''Cardiol''', '''Pralon''', '''Cordialina''', '''Eraldina''', '''Teranol''') is a selective [[beta blocker]] (beta-1 blocker) that has been used in the emergency treatment of [[cardiac arrhythmias]]. Practolol is no longer used as it is highly toxic despite the similarity of its chemical formula to [[propranolol]].{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}} After its introduction, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, conjunctival scarring, fibrosis, metaplasia, and shrinkage developed in 27 patients as an adverse reaction to practolol. Rashes, nasal and mucosal ulceration, fibrous or plastic peritonitis, pleurisy, cochlear damage, and secretory otitis media also occurred in some cases.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}} Three patients suffered profound visual loss though most retained good vision. Symptoms and signs improved on withdrawal of the drug, but reduction of tear secretion persisted in most patients. (British Medical Journal, March 15, 1975)

==History==
The compound was studied by scientists at the Research Department of the [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI Pharmaceuticals Division]] in [[Alderley Park]] with physiologists at the [[University of Leeds]] in the early 1970s when it was known as compound ''ICI 66082''; they utilised dogs, cats and rats in their investigations. Earlier research had also been carried out as early as 1967 on this and similar molecules by other research teams also with ICI.&lt;ref&gt;

==Side effects==
Side effects are similar to those of other [[beta blocker]]s, such as bronchoconstriction, cardiac failure, cold extremities, fatigue and depression, hypoglycaemia.&lt;ref name=Rang&amp;Dale6th&gt;{{cite book |author1=Rod Flower |author2=Humphrey P.

Furthermore, chronic use of practolol may cause [[oculomucocutaneous syndrome]],&lt;ref name=Rang&amp;Dale6th/&gt; a severe syndrome whose signs include conjunctivitis [[Dryness (medical)|sicca]] and [[psoriasiform rash]]es, [[otitis]] and [[sclerosing serositis]].

A synthesis is available which relates the absolute configuration of the more potent optical isomer to (+)-lactic acid. The glycerol derivative ('''2''') is available from D-[[mannitol]] and retains optical activity as the two 1° alcohol functions are differentially protected. Displacement with sodium p-acetamidophenoxide ('''1''', deprotonated paracetamol) gives '''3''' which is deprotected with dilute acid, the primary alcohol function is selectively reacted with one molar equivalent of [[tosyl chloride]] and pyridine, then treated with NaOH in [[dimethylsulfoxide]] to yield '''3'''. Epoxide opening with [[isopropylamine]] leads to optically active prolactolol ('''4''').{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}

'''Radical cheerleading''' is a performative style of political activism, derived from mainstream [[cheerleading]]. Radical cheerleading combines elements of peaceful protest or [[non-violent direct action]] with theatrical elements including costuming, spectacle and choreographed dance. Radical cheerleading was created by sisters Cara, Aimee and Colleen Jennings in Miami, Florida, in 1996.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; It grew to become an international movement with squads in the United States, Canada and Europe. Radical cheerleaders create and adapt [[Cheering|cheers]] that promote [[feminism]] and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_nyHS4WyUKEC&amp;lpg=PT158&amp;ots=h1VYipd5FH&amp;dq=radical%20cheerleaders&amp;pg=PT158#v=onepage&amp;q=radical%20cheerleaders&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Gender and Society|last=Grindstaff|first=Laura Anne|publisher=SAGE|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4129-0916-7|location=Los Angeles|page=126|chapter=Cheerleading: The Gender Politics of Contemporary Cheerleading}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Subculture ==
Over time, radical cheerleading developed into a subculture apart from [[cheerleading]]. To understand how radical cheerleading became a culture of its own, it is important to consider the impacts of mainstream cheerleading.

Mainstream cheerleading reached new heights of popularity in the 1990s, as it transformed from a form of entertainment to being understood as an athletic sport. The first Cheerleading World Championship took place in 2001, asserting cheerleading as a competitive sport. Still, cheerleaders were (and often still are) consistently stereotyped as unintelligent, ditzy, and promiscuous, as opposed to true athletes. Regular cheerleaders are often hypersexualized and defined by an idealized female body type. Author Christine Ro writes, "the popular image of cheerleading was still very much of the minimally dressed female cheerleader on the sidelines of a male sports event. This was the image radical cheerleaders seized upon in order to subvert gender messages while serving up peppy support for social justice causes."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/hey-hey-ho-ho-where-did-radical-cheerleaders-go|title=HEY HEY! HO HO! WHERE DID RADICAL CHEERLEADERS GO?|last=Ro|first=Christine|date=August 10, 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radical cheerleaders reclaimed the identity of the cheerleader and re-shaped mainstream cheerleading to include all bodies, as opposed to certain bodies. They transformed cheerleading from a sideshow into the main event. They shifted the focus of cheerleading from sexualized spectacle to the promotion of larger ideas, like civilian empowerment and political awareness. In these ways, radical cheerleading developed into a distinct culture of its own.

== Gender non-conformity ==
Mainstream cheerleading is marked by heteronormativity.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} In contrast, gender non-conformity is a foundation upon which the subculture of radical cheerleading developed. Since its creation, radical cheerleading has been a movement open to all: participants may be male, female, [[transgender]], non-binary or non-gender identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ncXeMQUMtPgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=usJqypZj99&amp;dq=%22radical%20cheerleading%22&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q=%22radical%20cheerleading%22&amp;f=false|title=Cheerleader!: An American Icon|last=Adams|first=Natalie Guice|last2=Bettis|first2=Pamela|publisher=Palgrave|year=2003|isbn=978-1-4039-6184-6|location=New York|pages=36–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, radical cheerleaders subvert gender norms through costuming and aesthetics. According to author and radical cheerleader Jeanne Vaccaro, the movement was responsible for "cultivating a queer sensibility."&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The subculture’s inclusion of non-gender-conforming individuals creates a space for all bodies, which in turn creates a uniquely accepting community. This is more than just an open-door policy, but an identifying characteristic of the subculture of radical cheerleading, just as relevant to the movement as the leftist messages it asserts.

== Aesthetics ==
Radical cheerleaders reappropriate the aesthetics of cheerleading, sometimes in an ironic fashion. Radical cheerleaders dress in diverse ways. Radical cheerleading is often marked by a DIY aesthetic, with handmade costumes and props. Some radical cheerleaders make [[Pom-pom|pom-poms]] using garbage bags by folding them in half, tying off one side with a rubber band and then cutting strips from the other end. 

Every squad has a unique aesthetic of its own. The Dirty Southern Belles, from Memphis, Tennessee, wear the colors pink and black to cheer for gay pride. The Pirate Cheerleaders, a squad from Milwaukee, wear black skirts with white pleats, and shirts with pirate logos when performing at basement punk shows. The New Paltz Rads, a squad from the State University of New York at New Paltz, sport signature colors black and red.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/were-here-we-cheer-get-used-it-136589|title=We're Here!

== Notable demonstrations ==
[[File:S15 Radical Cheerleading 1.jpg|thumb]]
Radical cheerleaders often perform at political [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], festivals and other feminist events, where they lead protest chants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aR5uGYkTj5UC&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;ots=HVwsoN399_&amp;dq=%22radical%20cheerleading%22&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q=%22radical%20cheerleading%22&amp;f=false|title=Alternative Media and Politics of Resistance: A Communication Perspective|last=Atkinson|first=Joshua D.|publisher=Peter Lang|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4331-0517-3|location=New York|pages=126–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radical cheerleading is used at demonstrations to promote political messages in a media-friendly, people-friendly way. Radical cheerleaders may also perform on stage at music venues, to bring political issues (as well as entertainment) to an unsuspecting crowd. Chicago's Lickity Split radical cheerleaders frequently used this tactic.

A notable radical cheerleading appearance was at the [[March for Women's Lives]] in [[Washington, DC]] on April 25, 2004. The participants' aim was to raise awareness about the lack of access low-income women have to [[abortion]] clinics.

Another remarkable demonstration took place at a Taco Bell restaurant in Auburn, Alabama in 2001, where radical cheerleaders gathered to protest for fair wages. Dubbed the "Taco Bell Protest," participants explained to police that the purpose of their demonstration was to protest the business relationship between corporate Taco Bell and the Six L's Packing Company, Inc., a firm that pays employees low wages with zero benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/news/gimme-an-a-6323520|title=Gimme an A!|last=Roe|first=Amy|date=August 2, 2001|work=Broward Palm Beach New Times|access-date=April 2, 2016|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taco Bell Protest serves as an encapsulating example of all that radical cheerleading stands for: peaceful (if not disruptive) demonstration, DIY construction of protest tools/props, an anti-capitalist agenda, and a demand for fair wages, a classic feminist ideal. 

Radical cheerleaders demonstrated at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Resistin' Radicatz, a radical cheerleading squad, performed at the 2004 Million Worker March.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Cheer content ==
Cheers are usually written from scratch or by rewriting the words of popular and historic songs. The first radical cheer book was published in 1997.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

An example of a radical cheer, led by creator Cara Jennings, performed at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York:

{{Quote|Sound off! I don’t wanna work anymore! What did you say? I said the system doesn’t work anymore! What did you say? I said STOMP, smash the state, Let's liberate, Acknowledge me or go to hell, another womyn to rebel, let's liberate, Stomp, smash the state, let's liberate, organize and raise some hell, act up, unite and rebel!&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;}}

An example of a cheer performed by the Radical Teen Cheer Squad: "We're teens, we're cute, we're radical to boot! We're angry, we're tough, and we have had enough!"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Media ==
While the subculture has received some attention from the media, radical cheerleading receives less media attention than mainstream cheerleading.

In ''Give Me An F: Radical Cheerleading and Feminist Performance'', radical cheerleader and Author Jeanne Vaccaro describes the process of archiving radical cheerleading through the examination of cheers, zines, photographs and personal testimony from fellow radical cheerleader Mary Xmas.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/hawksites.newpaltz.edu/dist/1/2245/files/2018/01/Vaccaro_Radical-Cheerleaders-and-Feminist-Performance-289w2x9.pdf|title=Give Me an F: Radical Cheerleading and Feminist Performance|last=Vaccaro|first=Jeanne|date=January 2018|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180419120655/https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/hawksites.newpaltz.edu/dist/1/2245/files/2018/01/Vaccaro_Radical-Cheerleaders-and-Feminist-Performance-289w2x9.pdf|archive-date=April 19, 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech at the National Women's Studies Association in 2004, feminist magazine director [[Lisa Jervis]] placed radical cheerleading within a tradition of playful feminist comment on popular culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In August 2004 the New York City Radical Cheerleaders completed ''Don't Let the System Get You Down—Cheer Up'', a video documentary of the Radical Cheerblock at the March for Women's Lives. The video was released in time to celebrate and honor and inspire the hundreds of radical cheerleaders who converged in New York to protest the Republican National Convention.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Responses ==
Radical cheerleading is a style of performance, and is inherently defined by the element of spectacle. Responses within the media have ranged from positive to negative. Sheila Noone, the editorial director of ''American Cheerleader'' magazine, commented that cheerleaders are involved in an "uphill battle" towards gaining respect,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; asserting that radical cheerleading makes this even more difficult. In contrast, Lauren Jack, member of Harvard University's Cheerleading squad, made the statement that cheerleading is "all about trying to get everyone else excited about your causes, so it's perfect for political activism."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3609">The '''Roaring 1980s''' ({{lang-sv|Glada 1980-talet}}) is the name of the [[boom and bust|economic boom]] in Sweden during the mid-late 1980s.

==Background==
The years after the [[1973 oil crisis]] was a time of [[1973–74 stock market crash|economic recession]]. In October 1982 a [[devaluation]] of the [[Swedish krona|Swedish currency]] was done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Horisont|Horisont 1982]]|publisher=[[Bertmarks förlag|Bertmarks]]|year=1983|language=Swedish|pages=220–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 November 1985, the [[November Revolution (Sweden)|credit market became free]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/naringsliv/ollevik-alliansen-har-skapat-nya-branscher_8609916.svd|title=Ollevik: Alliansen har skapat nya branscher|publisher=Svenska dagbladet|language=Swedish|date=13 October 2013|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the international economic boom that had begun spread into Sweden.

==Trends==
A [[yuppie]] culture developed at the [[Stockholm Stock Exchange]]. [[Mobile telephone]]s were also known by the popular nickname "yuppienalle". ("Yuppie's teddy bear")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/it_telekom/mobiltele/article3171514.ece|title=För dig som saknar yuppienallen|language=Swedish|publisher=Ny teknik|author=Yvonne Edenholm|date=6 May 2011|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even the term [[finance puppy]] ("finansvalp") was common when referring to young businessmen. The contemporary yuppie culture was criticized by, among others, [[Stig Malm]] in his 1987 [[May Day|First of May]] speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/arkiv/stockholm/stadshuset-en-halv-miljard-forsvann-10-ar-sedan-de-vidlyftiga|title=Stadshuset: En halv miljard försvann. 10 år sedan de vidlyftiga optionsaffärerna|language=Swedish|publisher=Dagens nyheter|author=Spängs Thorbjörn|date=3 February 1997|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buying and selling [[art]] also became popular within the world of businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/konst-form/omstridda-avtal-pa-bukowskis/|title=Omstridda avtal på Bukowskis|publisher=Dagens nyheter|language=Swedish|author=Matilda Gustavsson|date=15 April 2014|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''''Snake dance'''' is a term used to refer to a parade before or during a high school or  a related event like a [[american football|football]] game.   The parade includes floats built by each high school class, [[marching bands]], students, and alumni.  '''Snake dance''' may also be more narrowly used to describe a student parade, a line of students celebrating, or a parade starting in a central business district or school location and ending with an evening bonfire and pep rally near the school.   Line of students as "snake dance" is a traditional term.  The [[University of Northern Iowa]] archives refer to snake dance as early as 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.uni.edu/collections/special-collections/history-homecoming-uni |title=library.uni.edu |publisher=library.uni.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1911 [[Associated Press]] dispatch covering Philadelphia fans celebrating the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] victory in Game 2 of the [[1911 World Series]] reported, "Staid business and professional men joined their office boys and ragged urchins in a snake dance around city hall".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LkUsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yskEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3596%2C864737 |title=Quaker City Fans All Enthusiasm |publisher= |date=Oct 18, 1911 |accessdate=2011-12-14 |work=Herald-Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sónar''' is an arts, design, and electronic and advanced music festival, founded in Barcelona in 1994 by [[:ca:Ricard Robles|Ricard Robles]], Enric Palau, and [[:es:Sergio Caballero|Sergi Caballero]]. The festival has been divided into two parts since its inception: Sónar by Day and Sónar by Night, with [https://sonarplusd.com/ Sónar+D], a three-day congress dedicated to Creativity, Technology and Business running concurrently since 2013. As well as the flagship event in Barcelona, Sónar hosts events around the world, with annual festivals currently taking place in Bogota, Buenos Aires, Hong Kong, Reykjavik and Istanbul.

Artists to have performed at Sónar include: [[Björk]], [[Thom Yorke]], [[Jean-Michel Jarre]], [[Duran Duran]], [[Grace Jones]], [[Beastie Boys]], [[De La Soul]], [[Kraftwerk]], [[Gorillaz]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[Skrillex]], [[Diplo]], [[M.I.A. (rapper)|M.I.A.]], [[Nile Rodgers|Chic]], [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]], [[Aphex Twin]], [[Richie Hawtin]] and [[Laurent Garnier]].

Writing in 2017, the New York Times states that  “Sónar has built itself into a European institution... It’s a festival of the experimental and the crowd-pleasing, the subtle and the unsubtle, scaled from quiet small-auditorium performances to seismic stadium dance music....&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/18/arts/music/sonar-barcelona-festival-best-performances.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss|title=Sónar 2017: 15 of the Best Sets From the Barcelona Music Festival|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-08-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

==Birth and early years (1994–1996)==
[[File:Sónar 2007 Barcelona Matthew Dear s Big Hands.jpg|thumb|right|260px]]
Sónar was founded in Barcelona in 1994 as the “Festival of Advanced Music and Multimedia Art”, by music journalist Ricard Robles and musicians and visual artists Enric Palau and Sergio Caballero. The first festival took place on 2, 3 and 4 June at the [[Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona]] (Sónar by Day) and the Apolo club (Sónar by Night), with performances by [[Holger Czukay]], [[Mixmaster Morris]], [[Laurent Garnier]], [[Sven Väth]], [[Atom Heart]], and Trans Global Underground, among others. This first event, which included the Record Fair and Technology Fair - the forerunner of what is now known as Sonar+D - was attended by nearly 6,000 people and 40 representatives of the Spanish media.

Over the next two years, the festival expanded considerably: the number of accreditation holders doubled in 1995 and tripled in 1996, and the number of visitors rose from 6,000 to over 12,000 in 1995 and 18,000 in 1996. Sónar by Night relocated in its second year, moving to various areas in the Poble Espanyol, where it was based in 1995 and 1996. Some of performances and sessions during these years included [[Coldcut]], [[Spring Heel Jack]], [[Josh Wink]], [[Autechre]], [[Richie Hawtin]], [[Ken Ishii]], [[Slam (band)|Slam]], [[Jeff Mills]], [[Scanner (band)|Scanner]], [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]], [[Fangoria]], [[John Acquaviva]], [[Kenny Larkin]], and [[Biosphere]].

==Evolution and growth (1997–2000)==

The year 1997 marked a turning point for the festival, as Sónar by Night moved to a new venue, the Mar Bella sports pavilion, tripling its capacity. 
With the late 1990s came considerable growth: from 18,000 visitors in 1996 to 28,000 in 1997, 38,000 in 1998, 43,000 in 1999 and over 53,000 in 2000. The festival's evolution can also be measured in the number of accredited media: in 1996 there were 72 Spanish and 15 international media, by 2000 the number had risen to 158 and 185, respectively.

Artists performing at Sónar by Day during these four years included [[Squarepusher]], [[Fennesz]], [[Bruce Gilbert]], Patrick Pulsinger, [[Pan Sonic]], [[Mouse On Mars]], [[Suicide]], [[Aviador Dro]], [[DJ Spooky]], [[Pole (musician)|Pole]], DJ Zero, [[Goldfrapp]], and [[Merzbow]], [[Daft Punk]], [[Kraftwerk]], [[Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister]], [[Jimi Tenor]], [[Laurent Garnier]] (under his real name or the alias DJ Jamon), [[Marc Almond]], [[Deep Dish (band)|Deep Dish]], Motorbass, [[Plastikman]], [[Matthew Herbert|Herbert]], [[Death In Vegas]], [[Fila Brazillia]], Roger Sánchez, [[Coldcut]], DJ Hell, Sólo Los Solo, [[Atari Teenage Riot]], An Der Beat, [[Chicks On Speed]], [[Super Collider (band)|Super Collider]], and [[Miss Kittin]].

==Sónar in the twenty-first century (2000–present)==

In the early years of the new decade, Sónar continued to grow, first stabilizing at around 80,000 visitors each year and then growing further to 121,000 for its 20th anniversary in 2013. This attendance record was beaten again in 2017 (123,00) and at the 25th anniversary celebration in 2018 (126,000).&lt;ins&gt; In this period Sónar continued to exert an influence on critics and artists alike&lt;/ins&gt;, thanks to its forward thinking programming and production&lt;ins&gt;. &lt;u&gt;As the Financial Times reported in a 2006 review: "[The Scissor Sisters' Jake Shears] was not alone among artists in citing S&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;u&gt;ó&lt;ins&gt;nar as a fundamental influence upon his career"&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/21ccce6e-ffb7-11da-93a0-0000779e2340?sharetype=blocked|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2001 festival saw another change of venue for Sónar by Night to the larger venue of the Fira Gran Via area in L'Hospitalet de Llobregat. This new home meant that it was possible to offer large format concerts with a strong audiovisual component, attracting performances by artists such as [[bjork]] (2002), [[Kraftwerk]] (with a 3D show in 2013) and [[The Chemical Brothers]] (2005 and 2015)

The Sónar by Night Venue hosts several stages; the 15,000 capacity SonarClub, the open air SonarLab and SonarPub and SonarCar. In 2016 this stage received an upgrade, featuring a custom sound system and a new format featuring continuous 7hr sets by selected DJ's. The inaugural edition featured Laurent Garnier (who assisted in the format's development) and Four Tet.

Sónar by Day also consolidated its extensive range, which is based not only on music but also the exhibitions at SonarMàtica, the activities at SonarPro, the screenings at SonarCinema, and the installations at Sonarama. During these years, the festival also collaborated with various institutions, spaces, and centres such as the GREC festival, the Centre d’Arts Santa Mónica, the Mies Van Der Rohe Foundation, CosmoCaixa, and [[L'Auditori]], the venue for concerts by the [[Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National Orchestra]] with [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] + Pan Sonic + Fennesz, Francesco Tristano + Murcof, [[Matthew Herbert|Matthew Herbert Big Band]], and [[DJ /rupture]], among many others.

In 2013, Sónar by Day, moved out of its previous home in MACBA to a larger space in the Fira Montjuïc facilities at Plaza d'Espanya. The music program at Sónar by Day takes place over 5 stages: SonarHall, SonarDome (presented by Red Bull Music), the SonarComplex auditorium, SonarXS (dedicated to urban sounds from the global streets)  and the outdoor stage SonarVillage by Estrella Damm with its trademark artificial grass. In 2018, Sónar added an additional stage Sonar360º by Mediapro, dedicated to full dome experiences.

Notable artists performing in this period include M.I.A., De La Soul, Linton Kwesi Johnson, The Roots, Justice, Hot Chip,Janelle Monáe, Leila, Madlib, Prefuse 73, Ricardo Villalobos, Kode9, Plaid, The Sugarhill Gang, and Flying Lotus.

==Sónar and Barcelona==

Over its 25-year history, Sónar has transformed the dynamics and atmosphere of the city every June, adding substantially to the city's cultural tourism sector, and establishing Barcelona as the epicenter of the European electronic music scene during the week of the event.

In 2004, Sónar contributed 47 million euros to Catalonia's GDP (according to a study performed by Deloitte) A follow-up 360º study commissioned by Sónar in 2015 updated this figure to 126 million euros; a 226% increase over the decade, with a net value to the city of 559.7 Euros per attendee.

The impact on hotel occupancy in the city is also considerable. Occupancy rate in 2011 was 83.65%, and in 2012 it was 83.11%. These figures increase to 100% for officially approved tourist apartments.

In addition to the above, Sónar also leads to the proliferation and organisation of other events, presentations and showcases that take place in Barcelona outside the scope of the festival itself, which in turn also attract very large audiences of between 50 and 70 thousand visitors, in addition to the 126,000 visitors attending the official event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lavanguardia.com/cultura/20180616/45164576912/sonar-musica-festival-2019.html|title=El Sónar bate récords y cierra con 126.000 asistentes|work=La Vanguardia|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sónar around the world==

Since making its first international foray to London in 2002, Sónar has expanded its presence globally, having hosted eponymous events in 65 cities worldwide and across 4 continents. All Sónar events reflect the wider mission of creating a dialogue between the local and international scene in each territory, and feature a strong creative technological component.

To date, these locations include Chicago, Buenos Aires, São Paulo, Hamburg, Bogota, New York, Seoul, Rome, Cape Town, Copenhagen, Tokyo and Hong Kong. Sónar+D has also expanded its international program in recent years, forming part of the program in São Paulo (2015) Santiago de Chile (2015), Buenos Aires (2015), Reykjavik (2015), Bogota (2016), Hong Kong (2017) and Istanbul (2017).

As of 2018, Sónar hosts yearly events in 6 cities: [https://sonarbogota.com/ Bogota], [https://sonarbuenosaires.com/ Buenos Aires], [https://sonarreykjavik.com/ Reykjavik,] [https://sonarhongkong.com/ Hong Kong] and [https://sonaristanbul.com/ Istanbul], with a combined yearly attendance of 30,000.

"''In total, the festival featured more than 40 international, regional and local DJs and live acts – including 11 making their HK debut – as Sónar once again confirmed its reputation as the world's best electronic music festival.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/03/22/hkfp-lens-cutting-edge-performances-stun-revellers-sonar-hong-kong-2018-arts-music-festival/|title=HKFP Lens: Cutting-edge performances stun revellers at Sonar Hong Kong 2018 arts and music festival {{!}} Hong Kong Free Press HKFP|date=2018-03-22|work=Hong Kong Free Press HKFP|access-date=2018-08-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[https://sonarbogota.com/ Sónar Bogota] and [https://sonarbuenosaires.com/ Sónar Buenos Aires]. ===

==Sónar is part of We are Europe==
Since December 2015, Sónar is part of We are Europe, a cooperation project co-founded by the [[Creative Europe]] programme of the European Union, led by the French organization Arty Farty ([[Nuits Sonores|Nuits sonores]] Festival) and gathering 8 major European events joining forces in order to promote, create and produce innovative cultural practices, defined by creative diversity and exchanges.

== Sónar +D ==
In its inaugural edition in 1994, Sónar organized a fair for professionals with a dual dimension: a record and publishing fair (record labels, distributors, publications, publishers, promoters) and a technology fair (hardware and software brands, musical equipment companies). This format would undergo several incarnations over the years, gradually evolving away from the trade fair format and expanding to include art installations, film screenings, talks and conferences. Coinciding with the move of Sónar by Day to Fira Montjuic in 2013, this section of the festival program was re-imagined as Sónar+D.

Oriented as a 3-day congress of Creativity, Technology and Business running concurrently to Sónar by Day, (SonaR+D = Sónar+D). The congress includes installations, talks, exhibitions and displays of new technologies with creative applications. Since 2017, a Networking Day has been added to the program. Starting one day before the start of the festival this event is oriented towards b2b activities, and only accessible to Delegate pass holders.

During the 3 days of Sónar by Day, 80% of the activities at Sónar+D are open to general admission ticket holders, encouraging cross-pollination between, artists, makers and the creatively curious.

Sónar +D also feeds from and into the wider festival program, with tech-shows featured across all the festival stages, and prominent artists invited to give talks and workshops. Recent editions have featured artists and thinkers such as Brian Eno, Björk, Jean-Michel Jarre, Richie Hawtin, Kode 9, Holly Herndon,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2015/06/29/tech/holly-herndon-sonar-2015/index.html|title=Herndon: The musical futurist who makes her own rules - CNN|last=CNN|first=Ben Romberg, for|work=CNN|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alva Noto and Ryuichi Sakamoto.

As of 2018, companies and institutions  that have actively participated in Sónar+D  include BBC R+D, Spotify, Google Arts and Culture, Universal Music Group, Sony Music, PS4, HP, Me by Melia, Mediapro, Native Instruments, MIT Media Lab, Roland Instruments and Pioneer DJ, among others.

Sónar+D Hong Kong, takes place concurrently to the annual Sónar Hong Kong event at Hong Kong Science Park.  

== Sónar Calling GJ273b ==
To commemorate Sónar's 25th anniversary in 2018, the festival embarked on a groundbreaking experiment to send 33 pieces of music to Luytens Star b, a potentially habitable exo-planet located 12.4 light years from Earth.

Devised as "A celebration, an artistic and scientific experiment and a collective rumination on what it means to be human, and alien",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sonarcalling.com|title=Sónar Calling GJ273b|work=Sónar Calling|access-date=2018-08-08|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; and developed in collaboration with the Catalonia Institute of Space Studies and [[Messaging Extra-terrestrial Intelligence|METI]] International, the transmission took place in October 2017 and May 2018 from the [[EISCAT]] antenna in Tromsø, Norway.

Artists close to the festival who submitted specially created pieces of music include Jean-Michel Jarre, Autechre, Squarepusher, Nina Kraviz, The Black Madonna, Matmos, Laurent Garnier and Olafur Arnalds.

The message will take approximately 12.4 Earth years to arrive at its destination, making a potential reply arrive in time for Sónar's 50th anniversary in 2043.

Directed by Sergio Caballero since the first festival in 1994, Sónar's visual image is an intrinsic part of the festival's identity.

Deliberately avoiding the design clichés of music festival advertising, and by turns, witty, provocative and thought-provoking, the festival's image has incorporated a range of media over the years, from film, collage, sculpture, installations, commercial photography and viral video.

In 2018, coinciding with the 25th anniversary of the festival, the exhibition NI FLYERS, NI POSTERS: 25 years of SonarImage was held at Tecla Sala Art Center in [[L'Hospitalet de Llobregat|L'Hospitalet]], Barcelona. Presented as a multi-installation experiential exhibit, many of the key themes, characters and ideas over the preceding quarter century were re-imagined across 7 rooms in the ex-industrial space.

'''''The Scottsboro Boys''''' is a musical with a book by [[David Thompson (writer)|David Thompson]], music by [[John Kander]] and lyrics by [[Fred Ebb]]. Based on the [[Scottsboro Boys]] trial, the musical is one of the last collaborations between [[Kander and Ebb]] prior to the latter's death. The musical has the framework of a [[minstrel show]], altered to "create a musical social critique" with a company that, except for one, consists "entirely of African-American performers".&lt;ref name=play1&gt;Jones, Kenneth. [http://www.playbill.com/news/article/138814-Kander-Ebbs-Scottsboro-Boys-Will-Get-a-Cast-Album "Kander &amp; Ebb's 'Scottsboro Boys' Will Get a Cast Album"], playbill.com, April 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The musical debuted Off-Broadway and then moved to Broadway in 2010 for a run of only two months. It received twelve [[Tony Award]] nominations, but failed to win any.&lt;ref name=ew&gt;{{cite news |first=Aubry|last=D'Arminio|title=The Tony nominees react: How they partied with ribs, Louis CK, and an F-word cake |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/05/06/the-tony-nominees-react/|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=|date=2011-05-06 |accessdate=2011-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous record for nominations without a win was eleven, held by ''[[Steel Pier (musical)|Steel Pier]]'' and the original production of ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'', both also by Kander and Ebb. The musical's twelve nominations were second only to ''[[The Book of Mormon (musical)|The Book of Mormon]]'', which garnered fourteen nominations that year.&lt;ref name=ew/&gt; Nevertheless, ''The Scottsboro Boys'' played in US regional theatres in 2012 and moved to London in 2013, where, after a sell-out production at the [[Young Vic]], it moved to the [[West End theatre|West End]] in 2014.

==Synopsis==
As she is waiting for a bus, a lady lifts a corner of a cake box she's holding. As it brings back memories, the scene around her fades aways, and the minstrels arrive ("Minstrel March"). The Interlocutor, the host of the [[Minstrel Show]], introduces the players in the troupe, including Mr. Bones and Mr. Tambo, then begins the story of the [[Scottsboro Boys]] ("Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey!").

In 1931, [[Haywood Patterson]], one of the nine boys riding in a boxcar on a train to Memphis, is ready to see the world ("Commencing in Chattanooga"). As the train is stopped, two white girls jump out, and two policemen recognize them as prostitutes. To get away, they accuse the nearby boys of rape ("Alabama Ladies"), and the boys are sent to jail. At their trial, their lawyer is drunk and mounts no defense, and Haywood, speaking for the boys, can only respond that he has done nothing. ("Nothin'") They are found guilty and are sentenced to death at [[Kilby Prison]]. Eugene, the youngest, has nightmares ("Electric Chair"). Awaiting execution, the boys long to return home ("Go Back Home").  Just as the executions are about to begin, the verdict is overturned. In  the North, the case has become a [[cause célèbre]], and the Supreme Court has ruled the boys didn't have effective counsel. While the boys aren't free, they do get another trial ("Shout!").

A year later, they are still in prison. Haywood learns to write, and shares his short story ("Make Friends With the Truth"). The next trial gets under way in the spring of 1933. Public outrage over the trial has grown, especially in the North. They are given a New York lawyer, [[Samuel Leibowitz]], to represent them to court ("That's Not The Way We Do Things").  During the trial, Ruby Bates, one of the girls, surprises the court and admits that the boys are innocent ("Never Too Late"). But, upon cross-examination, the Southern District Attorney makes antisemitic claims that Ruby Bates' change of heart was purchased by Leibowitz ("Financial Advice").

While the boys sit in a holding cell, waiting for the verdict, they talk about what they will do when the trial is over, believing that they can't be found guilty of crime that never happened. They talk about heading North, but the Interlocutor reminds them that they belong in the South ("Southern Days").  The boys are found guilty again and are sent back to prison. Haywood tries to escape in order to see his mother before she dies ("Commencing in Chattanooga (Reprise)"), but he's quickly caught.

As time passes, Leibowitz continues to appeal the verdict. In every trial, the boys are found guilty. Even the other girl, Victoria Price, begins to buckle ("Alabama Ladies (Reprise)"), tired of being dragged to repeated trials, but she never recants her testimony. One of the boys, Ozie Powell, is shot in the head after assaulting a guard and is left brain-damaged. By 1937, four of the youngest boys are released, but the other five remain in prison. Haywood wonders if he will ever get justice, and the Interlocutor advises him to be patient ("It's gonna take time"). Finally, Haywood is brought up for parole in front of the governor of [[Alabama]], but will not be given parole unless he pleads guilty ("Zat So?") He defiantly refuses ("You Can't Do Me").  Haywood dies twenty-one years later in prison. As the show ends, the Interlocutor calls for the finale. The boys appear dressed in full-blown Minstrel attire and blackface, alternating between a high-energy closing number and solemnly relating how their experiences in prison left them unable to leave normal lives, leading to careers of unemployment, addiction, suicide and tragedy. The Interlocutor calls for the cakewalk, but the boys refuse, wiping off their make-up in defiance, and disappear. ("[[The Scottsboro Boys]]").

The scene fades back to the bus stop, just as the bus arrives. The lady, who is, in fact, [[Rosa Parks]], boards the bus. The driver, who is revealed to be the Interlocutor, tells her to move to the back of the bus, but she refuses to comply.&lt;ref&gt;April 2010. “Song Lyrics”.  In ''The Scottsboro Boys'' CD booklet.

== Background ==
In 2002, [[Susan Stroman]] first met with Thompson, Kander, and Ebb. The team began to "research the famous American trials" and found the [[Scottsboro Boys]] trial, which they thought was "a story that needed to be told."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/celebritybuzz/article/144021-PLAYBILLCOMS-BRIEF-ENCOUNTER-With-Susan-Stroman Susan Stroman interview from ''Playbill'']&lt;/ref&gt; After Ebb's death in 2004, the project was put on hold. However, in 2008, Kander reapproached Stroman and Thompson, and the project continued. Kander finished writing the lyrics in Ebb's place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadway.com/shows/scottsboro-boys/buzz/153832/whats-up-john-kander-the-legendary-composer-talks-scottsboro-boys-cabaret-and-liza/ "What’s Up, John Kander?

The ''CurtainUp'''s reviewer wrote, "While ''The Scottsboro Boys'' has made the leap from a small downtown theater to Broadway without a stumble, the tricky question as to whether it will clear the financial hurdle of having to sell more and higher priced tickets, has yet to be answered. For all the singing and dancing, this is not a cheerful story, nor does it have sexy ladies or a romantic element. But neither is it the overly familiar standard fare geared to the tourist trade."&lt;ref&gt;Sommer, Eylse.[http://www.curtainup.com/scottsboroboys.html "'The Scottsboro Boys', a Curtainup musical review"] curtainup.com, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ben Brantley]], reviewing for ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "With ''Scottsboro'' it is as if the events on which it is based are still too raw and upsetting to be treated with too much panache. Though it features some high-kicking dancing from its personable and industrious ensemble, this production gives the impression of always treading carefully, with furrowed brow, stooped shoulders and an accusatory glare."&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, Ben.[http://theater.nytimes.com/2010/03/11/theater/reviews/11scottsboro.html "Theater Review:'The Scottsboro Boys' - Kander and Ebb Revisit an Infamous Case"]''The New York Times'', March 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John McWhorter]] of ''[[The New Republic]]'' panned the production, writing that "ideally, [this would be] a piece that grappled with the real story of the Scottsboro boys, a rich one driven by the conflicting impulses of desperate people with conflicting agendas. But the musical paints it in such broad strokes that it’s hard to engage with it on any substantial level."&lt;ref name=TNR&gt;[[John McWhorter|McWhorter, John]] (2010-11-22) [http://www.tnr.com/blog/john-mcwhorter/79345/the-great-white-guilt-the-great-white-way The Great White Guilt on the Great White Way], ''[[The New Republic]]''&lt;/ref&gt; McWhorter concluded that "[i]f this thing were about [[Haymarket affair|Haymarket]] or [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square]] we’d never have heard of it. The only reason The Scottsboro Boys has made it to the [[Great White Way]] is the Great [[White Guilt]]."&lt;ref name=TNR/&gt;

The score was generally well received by critics, with ''[[The Associated Press]]'' review saying, "Kander’s melodies are effortless, pouring out in a variety of styles from cakewalk to folk ballad to comic ditty. Ebb died in 2004, but here his clear, precise and often quite funny lyrics have been finished by Kander, and the transitions are seamless."&lt;ref&gt;Kuchwara, Michael. "‘The Scottsboro boys’ examines racial injustice". ''Associated Press''.  March 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; McWhorter, however, disagreed, writing that "the Scottsboro score isn’t even much. One of John Kander and Fred Ebb’s least celebrated scores, ''[[Steel Pier (musical)|Steel Pier]]'', is ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' compared to this one. Time passes for show music writers: the Scottsboro score is perhaps analogous to [[Cole Porter]]’s ''Aladdin'' or [[Jule Styne]]’s ''[[The Red Shoes (musical)|The Red Shoes]]''. I would barely suspect Kander and Ebb had written this score if not told."&lt;ref name=TNR/&gt;

=== Controversy ===
On November 6, 2010, about thirty people gathered outside the Lyceum Theatre to protest ''The Scottsboro Boys'', arguing that "the use of minstrelsy and blackface were racist."&lt;ref name="protest"&gt;Cohen, Patricia.[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/07/scottsboro-boys-is-focus-of-protest/ "'Scottsboro Boys' Is Focus of Protest"]. ''The New York Times'', November 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Stroman said she was disappointed that the protesters, who "probably had not seen the musical," had "misunderstood that the creators were not celebrating the minstrel tradition but rather using it to reveal the evils of the system." Weissler said the minstrel show is "not meant to demean or degrade anybody," but rather that it "houses the story we’re trying to tell."&lt;ref name="protest"/&gt;

[[Whoopi Goldberg]] addressed these protests on ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'', saying that "there's been a lot of protests all over New York against this show – a show that people have not seen. The people who are protesting this show, 90% of the people have not seen it. ... People are protesting saying that it shouldn't be a minstrel show, this is too serious. What people don't understand is that you have to bring information to people in a most invigorating way."&lt;ref name="w"&gt;[http://broadwayworld.com/article/Whoopi_Talks_SCOTTSBORO_Protests_on_THE_VIEW_20101115#ixzz18NzDnADQ "Whoopi Talks SCOTTSBORO Protests"] broadwayworld.com, November 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Sound of Music Live!''''' is a [[television special]] that was originally broadcast by NBC on December 5, 2013. Produced by [[Craig Zadan]] and [[Neil Meron]], the special was an adaptation of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s Broadway musical ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. The television special starred [[country music|country]] singer and ''[[American Idol]]'' winner [[Carrie Underwood]] as [[Maria von Trapp]], and was performed and televised [[live television|live]] from [[Grumman Studios]] in [[Bethpage, New York]].

Spearheaded by NBC chairman [[Robert Greenblatt|Bob Greenblatt]], the network positioned the special as being a live [[event television|television "event"]]. In preparing for the broadcast, Meron and Zadan emphasized the logistical challenges that they would face due to the live aspects of the special, and the fact that ''The Sound of Music Live!'' was an adaptation based on the musical itself and not the [[The Sound of Music (film)|1965 film version]]. Meron felt that if the telecast were successful, the concept could become "another kind of entertainment that can exist on TV." By her request, Underwood's casting as Maria was personally endorsed by [[Julie Andrews]], who starred in the 1965 film.

The production was met with mixed reviews; much of its criticism was directed towards the casting of Carrie Underwood to play Maria, whom critics (including the real-life [[von Trapp family]]) believed was not experienced enough in theatre to portray such an iconic role. While her vocal performance was praised, her acting was described by critics as "amateur", "lifeless" and lacking emotion. The production was a ratings success for NBC; with a total of 18.62 million live viewers, ''The Sound of Music Live!'' brought the network its highest Thursday night viewership for an entertainment program since the [[Goodnight, Seattle|series finale]] of ''[[Frasier (TV series)|Frasier]]'' in 2004, and prompted NBC to sign Zadan and Meron on to produce more live musicals for the network in the future.

==Plot==
Maria Rainer, a [[postulant]] at [[Nonnberg Abbey]] in [[Salzburg]], is contemplating the day she has spent in the mountains ("The Sound of Music").  When she returns to the Abbey, she learns from the Mother Abbess that she is to be the new governess for the von Trappe children.  Before she leaves the Abbey, Mother Abbess asks her to teach her the song that she's always singing ("My Favorite Things"). When Maria arrives at the von Trappe house, she is greeted coldly by the Captain and introduced to the children, who enter with military precision. Maria  finds that the Captain has emotionally closed himself off since the death of his wife and decides to teach his children the basics of singing to gain their trust and acceptance.

A month, later the captain returns home with Elsa Schraeder, whom he is courting, and their friend Max Detweiler, who is looking for the perfect local singing group to perform at the annual Kaltzberg Festival. When his children arrive dressed in clothes Maria had made from her old bedroom curtains he is outraged and embarrassed. Maria then confronts him and tells him how he does not know or understand his children and that they need him but this only upsets him more and he orders her to return to Nonnberg Abbey. However, upon hearing his children sing to Schraeder, his eyes are open to the truth Maria had been speaking and he embraces his children and ask Maria to stay on as governess.

He then throws a grand party for Schraeder and when the band plays the [[Ländler]], the captain's youngest son asks Maria to teach him the dance and the captain steps in to help. As the two dance an unspoken attraction begins to arise in the two and Maria puts a stop to the dancing. However, this unspoken attraction did not go unnoticed by Brigitta who confronts Maria on this. Though Maria strongly denies it she begins to realize that Brigitta is telling the truth. Then, Schraeder calls the children out to say good night to the guests and Max is instantly smitten with the idea to have the children sing in the festival and during all the hustle and bustle Maria sneaks off unnoticed and returns to the Abbey, where she confides in the Mother Abbess that she has fallen in love with the captain but that she is ready to take the orders of [[poverty, obedience and chastity]]. The Mother Abbess denies her this and encourages her to take face her problem head-on and to find the life she was born to live.

Maria then returns to the von Trapp home and is warmly greeted by the children, who no longer feel the joys of singing due to her sudden departure. When she finds out that the captain intends to marry Schraeder she decides to see her duties through until arrangements can be made for a new governess. However, the political differences between Schraeder and the captain cause the two to realize that they have no future together and she leaves. Meanwhile, the captain confronts Maria and the two admit their feelings for each other. The two agree to marry at the Abbey and while the two are on honeymoon, [[Anschluss|Germany invades Austria]].

When they return, the captain is ordered to accept a commission in the German Navy and report immediately to [[Bremerhaven]]. Maria, thinking quickly, hands the Admiral the program for the Kaltzberg Festival showing that the von Trapp Family Singers are scheduled to perform, so the captain couldn’t possibly leave right away. They are granted permission to perform. During the finale, Max announces that a guard of honor is waiting to escort the captain away as soon as the concert is over. Maria leads the family in one more song to which they escape to one by one and flee to the Abbey. The Nazi soldiers search the Abbey for the von Trapps to no avail, as the family decides to flee Austria over the mountains with Maria's help.&lt;ref name="Synopsis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masterworksbroadway.com/music/the-sound-of-music-%E2%80%93-music-from-the-nbc-television-event-2013|title=The Sound of Music – Music from the NBC Television Event 2013|work=[[Masterworks Broadway]]|publisher=[[Sony Music Entertainment]]|accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Produced on a budget of around $9 million, ''The Sound of Music Live!'' was broadcast live from a soundstage built at Grumman Studios in [[Bethpage, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/carrie-underwood-s-sound-of-music-special-to-air-live-from-bethpage-1.6528060|title=Carrie Underwood's 'Sound of Music' special to air live from Bethpage|last1=Amodio|first1=Joseph|date=December 2, 2013|website=[[Newsday]]|publisher=[[Cablevision]]|accessdate=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC, as well as producers [[Craig Zadan]] and [[Neil Meron]], emphasized that the production was not a remake of the film, but an adaptation of the musical itself; Meron iterated that "the audience will discover, within the first few minutes of watching the show, that they are not seeing a TV version of the movie. They'll know right away it's ''The Sound of Music'', but it's a different ''Sound of Music'' than they are accustomed to seeing on film." Meron felt that if successful, the broadcast could "open the door to another kind of entertainment that can exist on TV." He also praised the involvement of Underwood as the star of the production, believing that she was a quick learner, and "has all of the qualities of Maria." Greenblatt was highly supportive of the project, as he was, in the words of Zadan, a "passionate devotee of theater". Zadan considered the production to be "one of the profoundly complicated, amazing experiences we’ve ever had", noting the additional challenges created by the live broadcast.&lt;ref name=variety-smlcomplex&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Sound of Music Live’: Producers Call It a ‘Profoundly Complicated, Amazing Experience’|url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/sound-of-music-live-a-profoundly-complicated-amazing-experience-1200925997/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|last=Littleton|first=Cynthia|date=December 6, 2013|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thq-somliveproduction&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC's 'Sound of Music' Producers on Live Show Fears and Big Expectations (Q&amp;A)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/nbcs-sound-music-producers-live-661941|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]| last=Ng|first=Philiana|date=December 5, 2013|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Promoted by NBC as a "three-hour holiday event",&lt;ref name="Bricker"/&gt; ''The Sound of Music Live!'' was aired as part of a push by NBC to air more live entertainment specials. Among its most popular programs in recent years have been those with live components (such as ''[[The Voice (U.S. TV series)|The Voice]]'' and ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]''); NBC's Jennifer Salke believed that the increased level of [[social networking service|social network]] interaction possible in a live broadcast, along with the feeling of being part of an "event", would encourage viewers to watch the special live instead of [[Video on-demand|on-demand]] or from a recording. NBC's previous attempt at event television, ''[[The Million Second Quiz]]'', was met with mixed reviews and viewership, but NBC did indicate that [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]]'s advertising throughout the series brought a higher level of [[Brand awareness|awareness]] to the brand.&lt;ref name=adage-nbclive&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC Plots Aggressive Live Programming Strategy|url=http://adage.com/article/media/nbc-plots-aggressive-live-programming-strategy/245473/|work=[[AdAge]]|publisher=[[Crain Communications]]|last=Poggi|first=Jeanine|date=December 2, 2013|accessdate=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The television special was also the first live musical special in almost fifty years on NBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes|title=The Sound of Music: Music from the NBC Television Event|type=[[Compact disc]] [[liner notes]]|year=2013|publisher=[[Sony Masterworks|Masterworks]]|page=7|id=88843 79814 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retail chain [[Walmart]] served as the presenting sponsor for ''The Sound of Music Live!''. NBC also produced five themed Walmart commercials to air throughout the special, featuring scenes of a family using products from the store set to songs from ''The Sound of Music''. The five ads were timed to air during the commercial break following the scene where the song was featured; NBC's advertising chief Dan Lovinger considered the ads to be a way to "enhance the excitement" of the presentation for families.&lt;ref name=variety-walmartads&gt;{{cite web|title=Walmart Ads for NBC’s "Sound of Music" Will Sound Just Like the Show|url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/walmart-ads-for-nbcs-sound-of-music-will-sound-just-like-the-show-1200922060/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|last=Steinberg|first=Brian|date=December 5, 2013|accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
Prior to the broadcast, members of the real-life von Trapp family were critical of casting Underwood to play Maria, agreeing with the notion that she would be a good singer but a poor actor. They suggested that [[Anne Hathaway]], who played [[Fantine]] in the [[Les Misérables (2012 film)|2012 film adaptation]] of ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]], would have been a better choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rothman|first=Michael|title=Who the Von Trapps Wish Could Replace Carrie Underwood in ‘The Sound of Music Live’|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2013/12/who-the-von-trapps-wish-could-replace-carrie-underwood-in-the-sound-of-music-live/|work=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=December 6, 2013|date=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sound of Music Live!'' received mixed reviews from entertainment critics, commending the show for its scope and supporting cast while questioning Underwood's acting capabilities.

Kevin Fallon of ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' wrote: "Naturally, Underwood sounded astounding, as alive as those damned hills, every time she was asked to stand on top of things and belt. But whether it was because of nerves or lack of experience, her acting was painfully lifeless and amateur throughout the first two thirds of the lengthy ordeal. The singer, it seems, is a proud graduate of the school of 'If I don't blink, they'll think I'm acting!'"&lt;ref name=db-somlreview&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Sound of Music Live!’ Review: The Hills Are Barely Alive| url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/12/06/sound-of-music-live-review-the-hills-are-barely-alive.html|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|publisher=[[The Newsweek Daily Beast Company]]|last=Fallon|first=Kevin|date=December 6, 2013|accessdate=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verne Gay of ''[[Newsday]]'' liked Underwood's performance, commenting that not only could she sing, but "she is a luminous stage presence who had the guts to take on one of the most iconic roles of the stage or screen."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/columnists/verne-gay/sound-of-music-and-carrie-underwood-largely-a-success-1.6550556|title = 'Sound of Music' -- and Carrie Underwood -- largely a success|date = December 5, 2013|accessdate =December 6, 2013|work = [[Newsday]]|publisher=[[Cablevision]]|last = Gay|first = Verne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described the production "as lifeless as [its] alpine backdrops."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TV Review: '' 'The Sound of Music Live!'

He also panned Moyer, criticizing his vocal performance and describing "his attempt at conveying an emotional hollowness" as "mildly constipated" and "clenched." However, he lauded Benanti, Borle and McDonald's "strong" performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/sound-music-live-tv-review-663346|title = The Sound of Music Live!: TV Review|date =December 5, 2013|accessdate=December 6, 2013|work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|last = Bernardin|first = Marc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NBC's Bob Greenblatt considered the production to be a success, and signed Meron and Zadan to produce another live musical for the 2014 holiday season. Greenblatt felt that there were enough recognizable, family-friendly musicals to make events like ''The Sound of Music Live!'' an annual tradition, and he indicated that NBC received e-mails and phone calls from various theatrical rightsholders, expressing interest in having their musicals adapted in a similar fashion, In January 2014, NBC announced that it would broadcast a live version of ''[[Peter Pan Live!|Peter Pan]]'' in December 2014, and at NBC's [[upfronts]] in May 2014, Greenblatt announced that NBC had also obtained rights to produce an adaptation of ''[[The Music Man]]'', although the network did not announce any timeframe for the production.&lt;ref name=nyt-morelive&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC Says It Will Put On a Show, Again| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/arts/television/a-network-is-buoyed-by-sound-of-music-ratings.html?ref=television&amp;_r=0|work=[[The New York Times]]|last=Carter|first=Bill|date=December 9, 2013|accessdate=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=billboard-nbcmusicman&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC Announces 'Music Man' Live TV Production|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6084818/nbc-announces-music-man-live-tv-production|website=Billboard|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Frizell |first=Sam |date=January 19, 2014 |title=NBC Announces ''Peter Pan'' for Next Live Production |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2014/01/19/nbc-announces-peter-pan-for-next-live-production/ |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=November 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later revealed that ''The Music Man'' project was put on hold for a live performance of ''[[The Wiz Live!|The Wiz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/article/2015/03/30/wiz-nbc The Wiz is NBC's next live musical] Entertainment Weekly, Retrieved October 4, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in the concept also spread to competing networks: in April 2014, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] announced that it would produce a [[Grease: Live|live production]] of ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'', which aired in January 2016.&lt;ref name=billboard-foxgrease&gt;{{cite web|title='Grease' Live Coming to Fox TV|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6070137/grease-live-coming-to-fox-tv|website=Billboard|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC aired ''[[Hairspray Live!]]'' later that year.&lt;ref&gt;Gans, Andrew.

The special also had an influence on viewership for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s annual broadcast of the [[The Sound of Music (film)|1965 film version]] of ''The Sound of Music''; with 6.5 million viewers and a 1.3 share, it was ABC's highest-rated airing of the film since 2007, although it was beaten by NBC's ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]''.&lt;ref name=deadline-ratings/&gt;

'''USS ''Stark'' (FFG-31)''', 23rd ship of the {{sclass-|Oliver Hazard Perry|frigate|4}} of guided-missile [[frigate]]s, was named for Admiral [[Harold Rainsford Stark]] (1880–1972). Ordered from [[Todd Pacific Shipyards]] in [[Seattle, Washington]], on 23 January 1978, ''Stark'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] on 24 August 1979, [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 30 May 1980, and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 23 October 1982 with CDR Terence W. Costello commanding. In 1987, an Iraqi jet fired two missiles at ''Stark'', killing 37 U.S. sailors on board. Decommissioned on 7 May 1999, ''Stark'' was scrapped in 2006.

==Missile attack==
{{main article|USS Stark incident}}
USS ''Stark'' was deployed to the [[Middle East Force]] in 1984 and 1987. Captain [[Glenn R. Brindel]] was the [[commanding officer]] during the 1987 deployment. The ship was struck on 17 May 1987 by two [[Exocet]] anti-ship missiles during the [[Iran–Iraq War]] fired from an Iraqi [[Dassault Mirage F1]]&lt;ref name="DoD_report"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120323222902/http://www.dod.gov/pubs/foi/operation_and_plans/USS_Liberty_Pueblo_Stark/65rev.pdf Formal Investigation into the Circumstances Surrounding the Attack of the USS Stark in 1987]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=erVzmflT2MIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Desert Storm at sea: what the Navy really did by Marvin Pokrant], p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; aircraft. The Reagan administration however attributed the blame to Iran for its alleged belligerence in the underlying conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bacevich|first=Andrew|title=America's War for the Greater Middle East: A Military History|year=2016|publisher=Random House}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plane had taken off from [[Shaibah]] (in Iraq) at 20:00 and had flown south into the [[Persian Gulf]]. The pilot fired the first Exocet missile from a range of {{convert|22.5|nmi|km}}, and the second from {{convert|15.5|nmi|km}}, just about the time ''Stark'' issued a standard warning by radio.&lt;ref name=kelley-0706&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/research/theses/kelley07.pdf|format=PDF|title=Better Lucky Than Good: Operation Earnest Will as Gunboat Diplomacy|author=Stephen Andrew Kelley|date=June 2007|publisher=[[Naval Postgraduate School]]|accessdate=9 November 2007|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823062402/http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/research/theses/kelley07.pdf|archivedate=23 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The frigate did not detect the missiles with radar; warning was given by the lookout only moments before the missiles struck.&lt;ref name="DoD_report"/&gt; The first penetrated the port-side hull and failed to detonate, but left flaming rocket fuel in its path. The second entered at almost the same point, and, leaving a {{convert|3|by|4|m|ft|0|adj=on|sp=us}} gash, exploded in crew quarters. 37 sailors were killed and 21 were injured.&lt;ref name="DoD_report"/&gt;

[[File:USS Stark.jpg|thumb|left|''Stark'' listing following two hits by [[Exocet]] missiles.]]
No weapons were fired in defense of ''Stark''. The [[Phalanx CIWS]] remained in standby mode, [[Mark 36 SRBOC]] countermeasures were not armed until seconds before the missile hit. The attacking Exocet missiles and Mirage aircraft were in a blindspot of the STIR [[Fire-control radar|fire control]] director (Separate tracking and illumination Radar, part of the [[Mk 92 Guided Missile Fire Control System]]), and the [[Oto Melara]] Mk 75 [[76mm/L62 Allargato|76 mm/62 caliber naval gun]], but in the clear for the MK 92 CAS (Combined Antenna System, primary search and tracking radar of the Mk 92 Guided Missile Fire Control System) and the Mk 13 Mod 4 single-arm launcher.  The ship failed to maneuver to bring its Mk 75 to bear before the first missile hit.&lt;ref name="DoD_report"/&gt;

On fire and listing, the frigate was brought under control by its crew during the night. The ship made its way to [[Bahrain]] where, after temporary repairs by the [[destroyer tender]] {{USS|Acadia|AD-42|6}} to make her seaworthy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://headmuscle.wordpress.com/2010/05/31/a-stark-reminder-2/|title=A Stark Reminder|first=|last=Chuck|date=31 May 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; she returned to her home port of [[Naval Station Mayport]], under her own power. The ship was eventually repaired at [[Ingalls Shipbuilding]] in [[Mississippi]] for $142 million.

[[File:USS Stark - external damage by exocet.jpg|thumb|left|A view of external damage to the port side.]]
It is unknown whether Iraqi leaders authorized the attack. Initial claims by the Iraqi government (that ''Stark'' was inside the Iran–Iraq War zone) were shown to be false. The motives and orders of the pilot remain unanswered. American officials have claimed he was executed, but an ex-Iraqi Air Force commander later said that the pilot who attacked ''Stark'' was not punished, and remained alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fisk|first=Robert|title=The Great War For Civilisation: The Conquest of the Middle East|year=2005|publisher=Knopf Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing lapses in training requirements and lax procedures, the U.S. Navy's board of inquiry relieved Captain Brindel of command and recommended him for [[court-martial]], along with Tactical Action Officer Lieutenant Basil E. Moncrief. Instead, Brindel and Moncrief received [[Nonjudicial punishment|non-judicial punishment]] from [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Frank B. Kelso II]] and [[Letter of reprimand|letters of reprimand]]. Both opted for early retirement, while [[Executive Officer]] [[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] Raymond Gajan Jr. was detached for cause and received a letter of admonition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times|title=Navy Forgoes Courts-Martial for Officers of Stark|url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6DD1439F93BA15754C0A961948260 |date=28 July 1987 | first=John H. | last=Cushman Jr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1990s==
''Stark'' was part of the Standing Naval Forces Atlantic Fleet in 1990 before returning to the Middle East Force in 1991. She was attached to [[UNITAS]] in 1993 and took part in [[Operation Uphold Democracy]] and [[Operation Able Vigil]] in 1994. In 1995, she returned to the Middle East Force before serving with the Standing Naval Forces, Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT) in 1997 and in 1998.

''Stark'' was decommissioned on 7 May 1999. A scrapping contract was awarded to Metro Machine Corp. of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 7 October 2005. The ship was reported scrapped on 21 June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[[Naval Vessel Register]]. {{NVR url|id=FFG31|title=STARK (FFG 31)}}. Retrieved 4 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Her stern plate was saved and donated to the Naval Station Mayport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lopez|first1=Michael|title=Mayport, Fla., remembers fallen shipmates at Stark Memorial|url=http://www.aerotechnews.com/blog/2016/05/20/mayport-fla-remembers-fallen-shipmates-at-stark-memorial/|publisher=Aerotech News and Review|date=May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Unique Theater''' was an 830-seat [[vaudeville]] theater built in 1904 on [[Hennepin Avenue]] in downtown [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]]. It was situated between the [[Hennepin Center for the Arts]] and the [[West Hotel]], built in the [[Renaissance Revival]] style, and catered to a family audience with daily performances costing $0.10 or $0.20.&lt;ref name=HCA&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Hennepin Center for the Arts|last=Balcom|first=Thomas|publisher=Mill City History Associates|year=1989|pages=5|location=Minneapolis, Minnesota}}&lt;/ref&gt; A then-unknown [[Charlie Chaplin]] performed at the Unique very early in his career.&lt;ref name=Treasure&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theater/4635/|title=Unique Theater|last=Krefft|first=Bryan|publisher=Cinema Treasures|accessdate=2007-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when vaudeville declined in the 1920s, the theater became a single-screen [[movie theater]], which was demolished in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=Treasure /&gt; The lot where it once stood is now a [[parking lot]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mndance.org/contact/map_directions.html|title=Map &amp; Directions|publisher=Minnesota Dance Theatre &amp; The Dance Institute|accessdate=2007-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; but will eventually be part of the [[Minnesota Shubert Performing Arts and Education Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnshubert.org/Release.html |title=Minnesota Shubert Center receives $11 million from Legislature |date=2007-05-22 |accessdate=2007-12-23 |publisher=Minnesota Schubert Performing Arts and Education Center |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120180524/http://www.mnshubert.org/Release.html |archivedate=November 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17449">The '''[[1975 in chess|1975]] [[World Chess Championship]]''' was not played due to a dispute over the match format. Champion [[Bobby Fischer]] (United States) was to play [[Anatoly Karpov]] ([[Soviet Union]]) in [[Manila]], commencing June 1, 1975. Fischer refused to play the then-standard "Best of 24 games" match, and after [[FIDE]] were unable to work out a compromise, forfeited his title instead. Karpov was named World Champion by default on April 3, 1975.

==1973 Interzonal tournaments==

Two 18-player, single round robin Interzonals were played with the top three from each qualifying for the Candidates Tournament. [[Leningrad]] and [[Petropolis]], [[Brazil]] were the venues.

Portisch and Polugaevsky qualified.

==1974 Candidates tournament==

The 1974 [[Candidates Tournament]] was played as knockout matches. Spassky as the loser of the last championship match and Petrosian as loser of the previous candidates final were seeded directly into the tournament and joined by the top three from each of the two interzonals.

The first round matches were first to win three games, [[draw (chess)|draws]] not counting. Semifinals were first to four wins, while the final was first to five wins but with a maximum of 24 games. Karpov beat Korchnoi 3–2 with 19 draws, earning the right to challenge Fischer.

The semifinal stage was marked by the presence of two ex-champions, Petrosian and Spassky, playing in different matches. The two had faced each other in the 1966 and 1969 title matches. Both were eliminated in this stage of the current cycle. Although the match rules called for four wins in the semifinals, Petrosian resigned the match after losing three games.

==Championship match==
Fischer had, prior to his [[World Chess Championship 1972|1972 match against Spassky]], felt that the first-to-12½-points format was not fair, since it encouraged whoever was leading to play for draws instead of wins. He himself espoused this strategy in the match: after having taken a comfortable lead, he drew games 14–20. With each game, he coasted closer to the title, while Spassky lost a chance to fight back. This style of chess offended Fischer. Instead he demanded the format be changed to that used in the very [[World Chess Championship 1886|first World Championship]], between [[Wilhelm Steinitz]] and [[Johannes Zukertort]], where the winner was the first player to score 10 wins with draws not counting. In case of a 9–9 score, the champion would retain title, and the prize fund split equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Seirawan |first=Yasser |date= |title=Winning Chess Brilliancies |url= |location= |publisher=Microsoft Press |page= |isbn=978-1857443479}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kasparov |first=Garry |date= |title=My Great Predecessors, Volume IV |url= |location= |publisher=Gloucester Publishers |page= |isbn=1-85744-395-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A FIDE Congress was held in 1974 during the [[Nice, France|Nice]] [[Chess Olympiad|Olympiad]]. The delegates voted in favor of Fischer's 10-win proposal, but rejected the 9–9 clause as well as the possibility of an unlimited match.&lt;ref&gt;Plisetsky &amp; Voronkov 2005, pp. 412–13&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Fischer refused to defend his title. Deadlines were extended for Fischer's reconsideration, but he did not respond, so Karpov was named World Champion by default on April 3, 1975.

==Aftermath==
After Fischer defaulted, Karpov became World Champion by forfeit.  Whether Karpov could have beaten Fischer is a matter of speculation. Future world champion [[Garry Kasparov]] argued that Karpov would have had good chances, because he had beaten Spassky convincingly and was a new breed of tough professional, and indeed had higher quality games, while Fischer had been inactive for three years.&lt;ref&gt;''Kasparov, [[My Great Predecessors]], part IV: Fischer, p. 474''&lt;/ref&gt; Spassky thought that Fischer would have won in 1975 but Karpov would have qualified again and beaten Fischer in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;In [http://www.chesscafe.com/text/polgar26.pdf an article] (PDF) published in 2004 on the Chesscafe website [[Susan Polgar]] wrote: "I spoke to Boris Spassky about this same issue and he believes that Bobby would have won in 1975, but that Anatoly would have won the rematch."&lt;/ref&gt;

Karpov had become world champion without defeating the previous champion in a match, causing some to question the legitimacy of his title. He combated these questions by participating in nearly every major tournament for the next ten years.&lt;ref name="WinningChessStrategies"&gt;{{cite book |last=Seirawan |first=Yasser |date= |title=Winning Chess Strategies |url= |location= |publisher=Microsoft Press |page= |isbn=978-1857443851}}&lt;/ref&gt; He convincingly won the very strong [[Milan]] tournament in 1975, and captured his first of three Soviet titles in 1976. He created a phenomenal streak of tournament wins against the strongest players in the world. Karpov held the record for most consecutive tournament victories (9) until it was shattered by [[Garry Kasparov]] (14). As a result, most experts soon acknowledged him as a legitimate world champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seirawan|first = Yasser|date= |title=Winning Chess Brilliancies|url= |location= |publisher=Microsoft Press |page= |isbn=9781857443479}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodman|first=David|title=The Centenary Match Kasparov-Karpov III|publisher=Macmillan Pub Co|isbn=978-0020287001|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|last=Fine|first=Reuben|title=The world's great chess games|publisher=Ishi Press|isbn=978-4871875325|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Zeta Perseids''' (ζ–Perseids) are a daylight [[meteor shower]] that takes place from about May 20 to July 5.&lt;ref name="Kronk"/&gt; The shower was discovered at [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]] in 1947 using radio equipment.&lt;ref name="Kronk"/&gt; The Zeta Perseids and [[Beta Taurids]] are both probably associated with the [[Taurids|Taurid Complex]] of meteor showers.&lt;ref name="IMO2012P"/&gt; The [[Arietids]] and Zeta Perseids maxima tend to blend into one another.&lt;ref name="IMO2012P"/&gt;
