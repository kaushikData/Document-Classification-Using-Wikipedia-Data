'''{{mp|(285263) 1998 QE|2}}''', provisional designation {{mp|1998 QE|2}}, is a dark [[asteroid]] and synchronous [[Binary asteroid|binary system]], classified as [[near-Earth object]] and [[potentially hazardous asteroid]] of the [[Amor asteroid|Amor group]], approximately 3 kilometers in diameter.&lt;ref name="Springmann-2014" /&gt; It was discovered on 19 August 1998, by astronomers of the [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research|LINEAR]] program at [[Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site]] near Socorro, New Mexico, in the United States.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt; Its sub-kilometer [[minor-planet moon]] was discovered by radar on 30 May 2013.&lt;ref name="johnstonsarchive" /&gt;{{efn|name=lcdb-Brozovic 2013b}}  

== Classification and orbital characteristics ==

As an [[Amor asteroid]] the orbit of {{mp|1998 QE|2}} is entirely beyond Earth's orbit. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.0–3.8&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 3 years and 9 months (1,378 days; [[semi-major axis]] of 2.42&amp;nbsp;AU). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.57 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 13[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]]. The ''Earth [[minimum orbit intersection distance]]''  with the orbit of the asteroid is {{convert|0.035|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}}, which translates into 13.4 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]]. As with many members of the Amor group, this asteroid has an [[aphelion]] beyond the orbit of [[Mars]] (at 1.66&amp;nbsp;AU) which also makes it a [[Mars-crosser]].&lt;ref name=jpldata /&gt;

The [[soot]]y surface of {{mp|1998 QE|2}} suggested that it might have previously been a [[comet]] that experienced a close encounter with the [[Sun]].&lt;ref name=phys /&gt; However, the [[Tisserand parameter]] with respect to [[Jupiter]] (T&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;=3.2) does not make it obvious whether {{mp|1998 QE|2}} was ever a comet, since cometary T&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; values are typically below 3.&lt;ref name="Goldstone" /&gt;

=== Earth approach ===

On May 31, 2013, {{mp|1998 QE|2}} approached within {{convert|0.039|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} (15 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]]) of [[Earth]] at 20:59 [[Universal Time|UT]] (4:59 pm EDT).&lt;ref name="jpl-close" /&gt; This was the closest approach the asteroid will make to Earth for at least the next two centuries.&lt;ref name="news2013-163" /&gt; It is a very strong radar target for [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]] from May 30 to June 9 and will be one for [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo]] from June 6 to June 12.&lt;ref name="Goldstone" /&gt; At its closest approach the asteroid had an [[apparent magnitude]] of 11 and therefore required a small telescope to be seen.&lt;ref name="Goldstone" /&gt;

Integrating the orbital solution shows the asteroid passed {{convert|0.08|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}} from Earth on June 8, 1975,&lt;ref name="jpl-close" /&gt; with an apparent magnitude of about 13.9.&lt;ref name="NEODyS1975" /&gt; The next notable close approach will be May 27, 2221, when the asteroid will pass Earth at a distance of {{convert|0.038|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=off}}.&lt;ref name="Goldstone" /&gt;

== Satellite ==

[[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]] [[Radar astronomy|radar]] observations on May 29, 2013 discovered that {{mp|1998 QE|2}} is orbited by a [[minor-planet moon]] approximately 600–800 meters in diameter.&lt;ref name="johnstonsarchive" /&gt;&lt;ref name="news2013-182" /&gt;{{efn|name=lcdb-Brozovic 2013b}} In radar images, the satellite appears brighter than {{mp|1998 QE|2}} because it is rotating significantly more slowly, which compresses the radar return of the satellite along the Doppler axis. This makes the satellite appear narrow and bright compared to {{mp|1998 QE|2}}.&lt;ref name="Lakdawalla" /&gt; The satellite orbits the primary every 32 hours with a maximum separation of {{convert|6.4|km|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="nasamoon" /&gt;  Once the satellite's orbit is well determined, [[astronomer]]s and [[astrophysicist]]s will be able to determine the mass and density of {{mp|1998 QE|2}}.

== Physical characteristics ==

=== Surface, albedo and composition ===

The surface of {{mp|1998 QE|2}} is covered with a [[soot]]y substance, making it optically dark with a geometric [[Astronomical albedo|albedo]] of 0.06,&lt;ref name="Goldstone" /&gt; meaning it absorbs 94% of the light that hits it, which is indicative for a carbonaceous surface of a [[C-type asteroid]]. The asteroid is covered with craters and is dark, red, and primitive.&lt;ref name=astrowatch /&gt;

=== Diameter ===

With a diameter between 2.7 and 3.2 kilometers, {{mp|1998 QE|2}} is one of largest known [[potentially hazardous asteroid]] ''(see [[Potentially hazardous asteroid#Largest PHA|PHA-list]])''.&lt;ref name="MPC-PHA-list" /&gt; Conversely, the ''Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link'' assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 1.08 kilometers based on an [[absolute magnitude]] of 17.2.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1456">The '''ANEMOON Foundation''', in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] '''Stichting ANEMOON''', is a foundation dedicated to the study of [[marine life]] in the [[Netherlands]]. "Anemoon" is a Dutch word that literally means [[anemone]], as in [[sea anemone]], a marine organism portrayed in the logo of the foundation, although here the word is used as an [[acronym]], based on the Dutch words "ANalyse Educatie Marien Oecologisch ONderzoek", meaning "analysis, education and marine ecological research". ANEMOON was founded in 1993 to focus on encouraging and supporting research on marine fauna and flora that is carried out by volunteers, i.e. [[citizen scientist]]s. ANEMOON is one of ten non-governmental data-managing organizations (PGOs, Particuliere Gegevensbeherende Organisaties) which compile data on the fauna and flora of the Netherlands; these ten PGOs feed data into the "Foundation for Flora and Fauna Research" and the "{{ill|Nationale Databank Flora en Fauna|nl}}", or NDFF, a conservation body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nlbif.nl/en/nlbif-data/organizationsanemoon-foundation NLBIF data, organizations, ANEMOON Foundation] accessed 2015-4-21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ballast water en.svg|thumb|Diagram showing the water pollution of the seas from untreated ballast water discharges]]
[[Ballast water]] discharges by ships can have a negative impact on the [[marine environment]]. The discharge of ballast water and sediments by ships is governed globally under the [[Ballast Water Management Convention]], since its entry into force in September 2017. It is also controlled through national regulations, which may be separate from the Convention, such as [[Ballast water regulation in the United States|in the United States]].

Cruise ships, large tankers, and bulk cargo carriers use a huge amount of ballast water, which is often taken on in the coastal waters in one region after ships discharge wastewater or unload cargo, and discharged at the next port of call, wherever more cargo is loaded. Ballast water discharge typically contains a variety of biological materials, including [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[virus]]es, and [[bacteria]]. These materials often include non-native, nuisance, exotic species that can cause extensive ecological and economic damage to aquatic ecosystems, along with serious human health issues including death.

==Problematic species==
There are hundreds of organisms carried in ballast water that cause problematic ecological effects outside of their natural range. The [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO) lists the ten most unwanted species as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imo.org/en/About/conventions/listofconventions/pages/international-convention-for-the-control-and-management-of-ships'-ballast-water-and-sediments-(bwm).aspx|title=International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments |publisher=International Maritime Organization}} &lt;/ref&gt;

*Round Goby ''[[Neogobius melanostomus]]''

==Ballast water issues by country==
===New Zealand===
The ballast tanks in New Zealand carry animals and plants that kill ecosystems. Ballast tanks are only used in cargo ships there. Ballast water is controlled under the [[Biosecurity Act 1993]].

===Peru===
A form of [[cholera]], ''Vibrio cholerae'', previously reported only in [[Bangladesh]] apparently arrived via ballast water in [[Peru]] in 1991, killing more than 10,000 people over the following three years.&lt;ref&gt;Living Beyond Our Means: Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005. Statement from the Board.{{Full citation needed|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main|Ballast water regulation in the United States}}
The [[zebra mussel]], which is native to the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea]]s, arrived in [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake St. Clair]] in the ballast water of a transatlantic freighter in 1988. Within 10 years it had spread to all of the five neighbouring [[Great Lakes]]. The economic cost of this introduction has been estimated by the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] at about $5 billion.

Ballast water discharges are believed to be the leading source of invasive species in U.S. marine waters, thus posing public health and environmental risks, as well as significant economic cost to industries such as water and power utilities, commercial and recreational fisheries, agriculture, and tourism.&lt;ref&gt;Statement of Catherine Hazlewood, The Ocean Conservancy, “Ballast Water Management: New International Standards and NISA Reauthorization,” Hearing, House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, 108th Cong., 2nd sess., March 25, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies suggest that the economic cost just from introduction of pest mollusks (zebra mussels, the [[Asian clam]], and others) to U.S. aquatic ecosystems is more than $6 billion per year.&lt;ref&gt;David Pimentel, Lori Lach, Rodolfo Zuniga, and Doug Morrison, “Environmental and Economic Costs Associated with Non-indigenous Species in the United States,” presented at AAAS Conference, Anaheim, CA, January 24, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[National Invasive Species Act]] in 1996 in order to regulate ballast water discharges.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Pub. L. 104-332. October 26, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] issued ballast water regulations in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Coast Guard, Washington, D.C. "Standards for Living Organisms in Ships’ Ballast Water Discharged in U.S. Waters." ''Federal Register,'' {{Federal Register|77|17254}}, 2012-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the authority of the [[Clean Water Act]], the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) published its latest ''Vessel General Permit'' in 2013. The permit sets numeric ballast water discharge limits for commercial vessels {{convert|79|ft|m}} in length or greater.&lt;ref name="EPA-permits"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/npdes/vessels-incidental-discharge-permitting-4 |title=Vessels Incidental Discharge Permitting |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-12-09 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA issued a separate permit for smaller commercial vessels in 2014.&lt;ref name="EPA-permits" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2014-09-10).

===Singapore===
Among 818 ports in the Pacific region, Singapore alone accounts for an estimated of 26 percent of cross-region (long range) species exchange. Via targeted ballast management on Singapore and a few other "influential" ports, cross-region species exchange to/from the Pacific region can be combinatorially reduced.&lt;ref name="XuWickramarathne2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xu|first1=Jian|last2=Wickramarathne|first2=Thanuka L.|last3=Chawla|first3=Nitesh V.|last4=Grey|first4=Erin K.|last5=Steinhaeuser|first5=Karsten|last6=Keller|first6=Reuben P.|last7=Drake|first7=John M.|last8=Lodge|first8=David M.|title=Improving management of aquatic invasions by integrating shipping network, ecological, and environmental data|year=2014|pages=1699–1708|doi=10.1145/2623330.2623364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IMO convention==
{{Main|Ballast Water Management Convention}}
To react to the growing concerns about environmental impact of ballast water discharge, the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO) adopted in 2004 the "''[[Ballast Water Management Convention|International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments]]''" to control the environmental damage from ballast water.
The Convention will require all ships to implement a "Ballast water management plan" including a ballast water record book and carrying out ballast water management procedures to a given standard.
Guidelines are given for additional measures then the guidelines.

The goals of the convention are to minimise damage to the environment by:
* Minimise the uptake of organisms during ballasting.
* Minimising the uptake of sediments during ballasting.
* Ballast water exchange while at sea (the ship should be minimum 200 nautical miles from shore with a depth of minimum 200 metres and can use the flow through or sequential method). At least 95 percent of the total ballast water should be exchanged.
* Treatment of the ballast water by chemical or mechanical influences (UV-radiation, filter, deoxygenation, cavitation, ozone…)

Control measures include:
* ''International Ballast Water Management Certificate''
* Ballast water management plan
* Ballast water record book

The IMO convention was ratified by enough countries and entered into force on September 8, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;

U.S. president [[Barack Obama]] has received widespread criticism due to his support of government surveillance. President Obama had released many statements on [[mass surveillance]] as a result.

==The Patriot Act==
As a [[United States Senate|senator]], Obama condemned the [[Patriot Act]] for violating the rights of American citizens. He argued that it allowed government agents to perform extensive and in-depth searches on American citizens without a search warrant. He also argued that it was possible to secure the United States against terrorist attacks while preserving individual liberty.&lt;ref name="Obama Speeches"&gt;{{cite speech | url=http://obamaspeeches.com/041-The-PATRIOT-Act-Obama-Speech.htm| title=Senate Floor Statement - The PATRIOT Act| date=December 15, 2005| accessdate= February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Obama signed a four-year renewal of the Patriot Act, specifically provisions allowing roaming wiretaps and government searches of business records. Obama argued that the renewal was needed to protect the United States from terrorist attacks. However, the renewal was criticized by several members of Congress who argued that the provisions did not do enough to curtail excessive searches.&lt;ref name="NBC News"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/43180202/ns/us_news-security/t/obama-europe-signs-patriot-act-extension/#.Uw1-ojoo7IU |title=Obama, in Europe, signs Patriot Act extension | date=2011-05-27|accessdate= February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama also received criticism for his reversal on privacy protection.&lt;ref name="The Washington Post"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/02/sen-obama-warned-about-patriot-act-abuses-president-obama-proved-him-right/|title=Sen. Obama warned about Patriot Act abuses. President Obama proved him right.| date=August 2, 2013| accessdate= February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial reaction to NSA mass surveillance leaks==
In June 2013, reports from a cache of [[top secret]] documents [[Leak (news)|leaked]] by ex-NSA contractor [[Edward Snowden]] revealed that the U.S. [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) and its international partners had created a global system of surveillance that was responsible for the mass collection of information on American and foreign citizens.

Obama initially defended NSA mass surveillance programs when they were first leaked. He argued that NSA surveillance was transparent and claimed that the NSA is unable and had made no attempt to monitor the phone calls and e-mails of American citizens.&lt;ref name="HuffPo-Reilly-06172013"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/17/obama-nsa-surveillance_n_3455771.html | title=Obama Defends NSA Surveillance Program, Says It's 'Transparent' | work=Huffington Post | date=June 17, 2013 | accessdate=February 21, 2014 | author=Reilly, Molly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Snowden's admittance to leaking classified documents regarding national surveillance, Obama attempted to ignore the issue of NSA surveillance. It was speculated that Obama did this to avoid complicating the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] investigation into Snowden.&lt;ref name="Politico-Epstein-06112013"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/edward-snowden-obama-92580.html | title=As Edward Snowden Speaks out, President Obama goes quiet | work=Politico | date=June 11, 2013 | accessdate=February 21, 2014 | author=Epstein, Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, Obama argued that his administration was already in the process of reviewing the NSA surveillance programs when they were leaked by Snowden. Obama stated that it would have been best for the American people to have never learned about the programs. He also criticized Snowden for not using existing systems within the federal government for whistleblowers. The latter statement was criticized as Snowden would have been directed to one of the committees responsible for protecting the secrecy of NSA surveillance if he had used the existing whistle-blower system.&lt;ref name="CNN-Wolf-08132013"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/12/politics/obama-snowden-whistleblower | title=Fact-checking Obama's claims about Snowden | work=CNN Politics | date=August 13, 2013 | accessdate=February 21, 2014 | author=Wolf, Z. Byron}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also promised to make public information about government surveillance and work with Congress to increase public confidence in the government.&lt;ref name="WhiteHouse-08092013"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/08/09/background-president-s-statement-reforms-nsa-programs | title=Background on the President’s Statement on Reforms to NSA Programs | work=The White House Office of the Press Secretary | date=August 9, 2013 | accessdate=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==January 17, 2014 speech==
On January 17, 2014,  President Obama gave a public address on mass surveillance.

}} During the speech, Obama promised increased restrictions on data collection of American citizens, which would include the requirement of court approval for searches of telephone records. In addition, Obama called for increased oversight and admitted the dangers NSA surveillance posed to civil liberties.&lt;ref name="NYT-Ed-01172014"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/18/opinion/the-president-on-mass-surveillance.html?_r=1 | title=The President on Mass Surveillance | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 17, 2014 | accessdate=February 21, 2014 | author=The Editorial Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions===
Obama's speech was criticized for being deliberately vague and not going far enough to protect civil liberties.&lt;ref name="NYT-Ed-01172014"/&gt;

Representatives for [[Google]], [[Facebook]] and [[Yahoo]] stated that Obama's proposed reforms represented positive progress, but that they did not ultimately do enough to protect privacy rights. A representative for [[Mozilla]] noted that mass surveillance had damaged the open Internet and caused balkanization and distrust.&lt;ref name="LATimes-01172014"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2014/jan/17/business/la-fi-tn-silicon-valleys-reaction-obama-nsa-reforms-20140117 | title=Silicon Valley's reaction to Obama's NSA reforms: Not Enough | work=[[The Los Angeles Times]] | date=January 17, 2014 | accessdate=February 21, 2014 | author=Guynn, Jessica | location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sen. [[Rand Paul]] criticized the remarks, saying: {{quote|1=While I am encouraged the President is addressing the NSA spying program because of pressure from Congress and the American people, I am disappointed in the details. The [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] requires an individualized warrant based on probable cause before the government can search phone records and e-mails. President Obama’s announced solution to the NSA spying controversy is the same unconstitutional program with a new configuration.  I intend to continue the fight to restore Americans' rights through my [[Fourth Amendment Restoration Act]] and my legal challenge against the NSA. The American people should not expect the fox to guard the hen house.&lt;ref name="GlobalDispatch-01192014"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/rand-paul-on-obama-nsa-reform-the-american-people-should-not-expect-the-fox-to-guard-the-hen-house-54111/ | title=Rand Paul On Obama NSA Reform: ‘The American People Should Not Expect The Fox To Guard The Hen House’ | work=The Global Dispatch | date=January 19, 2014 | accessdate=February 21, 2014 | author=Herriman, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Dianne Feinstein]], a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, stated that all but two or three of the members of her committee support Obama. Likewise, she criticized "privacy people" for not understanding the threat terrorists pose to the United States.&lt;ref name="NBCNews-01192014"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/19/22358363-congressional-intelligence-chairmen-applaud-obama-for-backing-surveillance | title=Congressional intelligence chairmen applaud Obama for backing surveillance | work=[[NBC News]] | date=January 19, 2014 | accessdate=February 21, 2014 | author=Curry, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mike Rogers (Michigan politician)|Mike Rogers]], the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, praised Obama's stance on NSA surveillance. [[Peter T. King|Peter King]], another member of the House Intelligence Committee, questioned the need for the proposed reform of NSA surveillance, but admitted that they were necessary to calm down the "[[ACLU]] types".&lt;ref name="HuffPo-01252014"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/17/nsa-obama-reaction_n_4619683.html | title=The NSA's Biggest Fans Are Happy With Obama's Speech | work=[[Huffington Post]] | date=January 25, 2014 | accessdate=February 21, 2014 | last1=McAuliff | first1=Michael | last2=Sledge | first2=Matt | last3=Siddiqui | first3=Sabrina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reactions from global leaders were limited. Great Britain and Russia, both states with extensive surveillance programs, offered no comments. [[Dilma Rousseff]], the current president of Brazil and an outspoken critic of NSA surveillance, also refused to comment. In Germany, a government spokesperson demanded greater protection for non-Americans in reaction to the speech. [[Der Spiegel]] accused the NSA of turning the internet into a weapons system.&lt;ref name="WaPo-01172014"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/tepid-global-reaction-to-obamas-nsa-vow/2014/01/17/a37a43ac-7fb5-11e3-97d3-b9925ce2c57b_story.html | title=Tepid global reaction to Obama's NSA Vow | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=January 17, 2014 | accessdate=February 21, 2014 | author=Witte, Griff | location=Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union]] stated that Obama's pledge to reform the phone data collection is a step in the right direction, but demanded that actual laws be passed regarding this reform.&lt;ref name="TheLocal-01192014"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thelocal.de/20140119/obama-merkel-doesnt-need-to-worry-about-spying | title=Obama to Merkel: Don't worry about spying | work=[[The Local]] | date=January 19, 2014 | accessdate=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A full point was awarded in each category where Obama fully made the promised reform. However, partial points were awarded for reforms that had not been fully completed, but where the EFF and The Day We Fight Back felt that progress as being made.&lt;ref name="TheDayWeFightBack-ObamaScorecard"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://thedaywefightback.org/obama-scorecard/ | title=A Scorecard for Obama's Surveillance Reform Announcement | work=[[The Day We Fight Back]] | accessdate=February 21, 2014 | last1=Cohn | first1=Cindy | last2=Reitman | first2=Rainey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama received praise for adding independent advocates to the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] (FISA) courts and opposing the [[FISA Improvements Act]]. However, it was also noted that Obama had not made any progress on giving metadata storage responsibility to a third party, ending the undermining of encryption standards, increasing transparency within the NSA and protecting whistleblowers.&lt;ref name="EFFCohn"/&gt;

==Statements to the German people==
On January 18, Obama spoke to [[ZDF]] in an attempt to improve the United States relations with Germany,&lt;ref name="NBCNews-01182014"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/18/22353575-obama-promises-germans-that-us-wont-wiretap-them-merkel | title=Obama Promises Germans That US Won't Wiretap Them, Merkel | work=[[NBC News]] | date=January 18, 2014 | accessdate=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ-01182014"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304603704579329084011340404 | title=Obama Promises Not to Spy on Merkel | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=January 18, 2014 | accessdate=February 22, 2014 | author=Thomas, Andrea | location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; which a German foreign office official said were "worse than … the low-point in 2003 during the Iraq War" due to the surveillance leaks.&lt;ref name="NBCNews-01172014"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/17/22338261-us-germany-relations-hit-new-low-amid-nsa-spying-scandal-official-says | title=U.S.-Germany relations hit new low amid NSA spying scandal, official says | work=[[NBC News]] | date=January 17, 2014 | agency=Reuters | accessdate=February 22, 2014 | author=Lamarque, Kevin | location=[[Mainz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama promised that he would not let revelations about mass surveillance damage [[Germany–United States relations|German-American relations]]  and admitted that it would take a long time for the United States to regain the trust of the German people. However, he maintained that the surveillance was necessary for international security.

German reactions to the speeches given by Obama on January 17 and 18 ranged from skeptical to outright hostile. Members of the German media argued that they were hopeful that Obama would bring about needed reform. However, they also noted that his statements were vague and argued that they did not represent legitimate reform. Many German political leaders responded with outright hostility. [[Thomas Oppermann]], the chairman of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|German Social Democrats]], demanded a no-spy treaty and stated that American surveillance constituted a crime. The German attorney general argued that there were grounds for a criminal investigation into the NSA's tapping of [[Angela Merkel]]'s cell phone.&lt;ref name="TheLocal-01202014"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thelocal.de/20140120/the-usa-knows-that-for-us-spying-is-a-crime-germany-nsa-obama-snowden | title='The USA knows that for us spying is a crime' | work=[[The Local]] | date=January 20, 2014 | accessdate=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed overhaul of NSA phone surveillance programs==
On March 25, 2014, Obama promised to end the NSA's collection and storage of bulk phone-call data. Despite this promise, his administration continued to seek reauthorization of the telephone metadata program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/198-press-releases-2014/1147-joint-statement-from-the-odni-and-the-u-s-doj-on-the-declassification-of-renewal-of-collection-under-section-501-of-the-fisa-12-14 |title=Joint Statement from the ODNI and the U.S. DOJ on the Declassification of Renewal of Collection Under Section 501 of the FISA |access-date=March 22, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403175215/http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/198-press-releases-2014/1147-joint-statement-from-the-odni-and-the-u-s-doj-on-the-declassification-of-renewal-of-collection-under-section-501-of-the-fisa-12-14 |archive-date=April 3, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is approved every 90 days by the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court|FISC]], with the most recent authority set to expire June 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/210-press-releases-2015/1180-joint-statement-from-the-odni-and-the-doj-on-the-declassification-of-renewal-of-collection-under-section-501-of-the-fisa-3-11 |title=Joint Statement from the ODNI and the DOJ on the Declassification of Renewal of Collection Under Section 501 of the FISA |access-date=March 22, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326182117/http://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/210-press-releases-2015/1180-joint-statement-from-the-odni-and-the-doj-on-the-declassification-of-renewal-of-collection-under-section-501-of-the-fisa-3-11 |archive-date=March 26, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a plan submitted by the Obama Administration to Congress, the NSA would be required to  conduct searches of data at phone companies. They would also need to receive a warrant from a federal judge to conduct the search.

The overhaul proposal received support from the American Civil Liberties Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/12/us/aclu-files-suit-over-phone-surveillance-program.html|title=A.C.L.U.

Reactions from the carriers were generally positive.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}  A representative of [[Sprint Corporation]] stated that the carrier was examining the president's proposal with great interest.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/03/usa-security-obama-idUSL1N0MS1QW20140403?type=companyNews&amp;feedType=RSS| title=Obama's NSA overhaul may require phone carriers to store more data| date=April 3, 2014 | agency=Reuters | accessdate=April 9, 2014 | author=Hosenball, Mark | location=[[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2015, the administration's proposals have not been implemented and the NSA retains the authority to collect and store telephone record metadata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/02/one-year-later-obama-failing-promise-rein-nsa |title=One Year Later, Obama Failing on Promise to Rein in NSA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abuses and 4th Amendment Violations by the NSA and FBI==

On May 24, 2017, a declassified FISA report&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/icotr/51117/2016_Cert_FISC_Memo_Opin_Order_Apr_2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama intel agency secretly conducted illegal searches on Americans for years|url=http://circa.com/politics/barack-obamas-team-secretly-disclosed-years-of-illegal-nsa-searches-spying-on-americans|accessdate=28 May 2017|agency=Circa|date=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; marked [[Classified information#Top Secret .28TS.29|"Top Secret"]] was published, noting that the NSA routinely violated the 4th Amendment of Americans and abused intelligence tools to do so. The Obama administration self-disclosed the problems at a closed-door hearing on Oct. 26 before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, two weeks before the 2016 election. The report labeled the matter a “very serious Fourth Amendment issue," citing an "institutional lack of candor" on the part of the administration. It also criticized the NSA as having “disregard” for rules and “deficient” oversight.

More than 5 percent, or one out of every 20 searches seeking upstream Internet data on Americans inside the NSA’s so-called Section 702 database, violated the safeguards the Obama administration vowed to follow in 2011. In addition, there was a three-fold increase in NSA data searches about Americans and a rise in the unmasking of U.S. person’s identities in intelligence reports after the administration loosened privacy rules in 2011. Many of the searches involved any and all mentions of foreign targets.

Officials like former National Security Adviser Susan Rice have argued their activities were legal under the so-called minimization rule changes the Obama administration made, and that the intelligence agencies were strictly monitored to avoid abuses. The FISA court and the NSA's own internal watchdog entity disputes this claim, stating that the administration conducting such queries were "in violation of that prohibition, with much greater frequency than had been previously disclosed to the Court.”

===Sharing of data by the FBI===

The FISA report also indicated hundreds of incidences in which the FBI illegally shared raw surveillance data illegally obtained by the NSA with private entities. Earlier in May, then-FBI Director James Comey told lawmakers his agency used sensitive espionage data gathered about Americans without a warrant only when it was “lawfully collected, carefully overseen and checked.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Declassified memos show FBI illegally shared spy data on Americans with private parties|url=http://circa.com/politics/declassified-memos-show-fbi-illegally-shared-spy-data-on-americans-with-private-parties|accessdate=28 May 2017|agency=Circa|date=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling in the report declared that “The Court is nonetheless concerned about the FBI’s apparent disregard of minimization rules and whether the FBI is engaging in similar disclosures of raw Section 702 information that have not been reported.”

In a declassified report from 2015,&lt;ref&gt;https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2015/o1501.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the internal watchdog had concerns as early as 2012 that the FBI was submitting "deficient” reports indicating it had a clean record complying with spy data gathered on Americans without a warrant. While Section 702 of the Foreign Surveillance Act, last updated by Congress in 2008, allowed the NSA to share with the FBI spy data collected without a warrant, the FISA report indicates FBI compliance problems began months after the updated legislation was implemented. The FBI’s very first compliance report in 2009 declared it had not found any instances in which agents accessed NSA intercepts supposedly gathered overseas about an American who in fact was on U.S. soil. The Inspector General, however, said it reviewed the same data and easily found evidence that the FBI accessed NSA data gathered on a person who likely was in the United States, making it illegal to review without a warrant.

===Reaction===

On April 28, the NSA issued a rare press release indicating it will no longer monitor all internet communications that mention a foreign intelligence target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsa.gov/news-features/press-room/statements/2017-04-28-702-statement.shtml|title=NSA Statement: NSA Stops Certain Section 702 "Upstream" Activities|website=www.nsa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neema Singh Guliani, the ACLU's legislative counsel in Washington, DC stated, “I think what this emphasizes is the shocking lack of oversight of these programs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://circa.com/politics/barack-obamas-team-secretly-disclosed-years-of-illegal-nsa-searches-spying-on-americans}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Farrell, Director of Investigations for the watchdog group Judicial Watch asserted, "This is an abuse of power and authority like we have never seen in this country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Farrell|first1=Chris|title=Obama’s NSA conducted illegal searches on Americans for years: Report|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92qk1GH68NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''biocapacity''' or '''biological capacity''' of an [[ecosystem]] is an estimate of its production of certain biological materials such as [[natural resources]], and its absorption and filtering of other materials such as [[carbon dioxide]] from the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.footprintnetwork.org/|website=[[Global Footprint Network]]: Advancing the Science of Sustainability|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JEM&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yue|first1=Dongxia|last2=Guo|first2=Jianjun|last3=Hui|first3=Cang|title=Scale dependency of biocapacity and the fallacy of unsustainable development|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|date=2013|volume=126|pages=13–19|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.04.022}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 August 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; “Useful biological 

Biocapacity is expressed in terms of [[global hectares]] per person, thus is dependent on human population. A global hectare is an adjusted unit that represents the average biological productivity of all productive [[hectares]] on Earth in a given year (because not all hectares produce the same amount of [[ecosystem services]]). Biocapcity is calculated from United Nations population and land use data, and may be reported at various regional levels, such as a city, a country, or the world as a whole. 

For example, there were 12 billion hectares of biologically productive land and water on this planet in 2008. Dividing by the number of people alive in that year, 6.7 billion, gives a biocapacity of 1.8 global hectares per person . This assumes that no land is set aside for other species that consume the same biological material as humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/ecological_wealth_of_nations_en Ecological Wealth of Nations: Earth's Biocapacity as a new framework for International Cooperation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Biocapacity is used together with [[Ecological Footprint]] as a method of measuring [[Human impact on the environment]]. Biocapacity and Ecological Footprint are tools created by the [[Global Footprint Network]], used in sustainability studies around the world.

==Applications of biocapacity==
An increase in global population can result in a decrease in biocapacity.  This is usually due to the fact that the Earth’s resources have to be shared; therefore, there becomes little to supply the increasing demand of the increasing [[population]].&lt;ref name=WWF&gt;{{cite web|title=What does ecological overshoot mean?|url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/all_publications/living_planet_report/demands_on_our_planet/overshoot/|website=World Wildlife Fund|publisher=WWF|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, this issue can be resolved by [[outsourcing]]. However, resources will run out due to the increasing demands and as a result a collapse of an ecosystem can be the consequence of such actions.&lt;ref name=WWF /&gt; When the [[ecological footprint]] becomes greater than the biocapacity of the population, a [[ecological deficit|biocapacity deficit]] is suspected.&lt;ref name=WWFbiocap&gt;{{cite web|title=Natures regenerative capacity|url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/all_publications/living_planet_report/demands_on_our_planet/biocapacity/|website=World Wildlife Fund|publisher=WWF|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
'Global biocapacity' is a term sometimes used to describe the total capacity of an ecosystem to support various continuous activity and changes.  When the [[ecological footprint]] of a population exceeds the biocapacity of the environment it lives in, this can be called an 'ecological overshoot'.&lt;ref name=WWFbiocap /&gt;&lt;ref name=RefiningEF&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Venetoulis|first1=Jason|last2=Talberth|first2=John|title=Refining the ecological footprint|journal=Environment, Development and Sustainability|date=5 January 2007|volume=10|issue=4|pages=441–469|doi=10.1007/s10668-006-9074-z}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 August 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 report stated that people were using an equivalence of 1.5 Earths to compensate for their needs.&lt;ref name=WWF /&gt;  However other sources have suggested that depletion of cropland, grazing land, forest land, fishing grounds, and built-up land is not occurring on an aggregate, global level. Hence, virtually all of the ecological overshoot comes from the measure of the rate at which carbon dioxide is accumulating in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Does the Shoe Fit? Real versus Imagined Ecological Footprints|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001700|publisher=PLOS biology journal }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional stresses of [[greenhouse gas]]es, [[climate change]], and [[ocean acidification]] can also aggravate the problem.&lt;ref name=WWF /&gt; In reference to the definition of biocapacity: 1.5 Earths means [[renewable resource]]s will eventually result in depletion because they are being produced faster and more often than the resources can be re-grown.&lt;ref name=WWF /&gt; Therefore, it will one year and six months for the resources we use to be able to regenerate again and in addition absorb all the waste we manufactured as well.&lt;ref name=WWF /&gt; So instead of taking one year, we are now in-taking enough [[resource]]s that should last us one year and six months.

In addition, if this matter becomes severe, an [[nature reserve|ecological reserve]] will be set on areas to preserve their ecosystems. Awareness about our depleting resources include: agricultural land, forest resources and rangeland.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hayden|first1=Anders|title=ecological footprint (EF)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1699724/ecological-footprint-EF|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|accessdate=11 August 2014|date=December 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biocapacity used in correlation to ecological footprint can therefore suggest whether a specific population, region, country or part of a world is living in the means of their capital. Accordingly,§98 the study of biocapacity and ecological footprint is known as the [[ecological footprint|Ecological Footprint Analysis (EFA)]].&lt;ref name=FAQ /&gt;

Biocapacity is also affected on the technology used during the year. With new technologies emerging, it is not whether the technology in that year is good or bad but whether how the technology impacts resource supply and demand; which in return affects biocapacity.&lt;ref name=FAQ /&gt; Hence what is considered “useful” can change from year to year (e.g. use of corn (maize) stover for cellulosic ethanol production would result in corn stover becoming a useful material, and thus increase the biocapacity of maize cropland).

Moreover, environmentalists have created [[ecological footprint|ecological footprint calculators]] for a single person(s) to determine whether they are encompassing more than what is available for them in their population.&lt;ref name=RegionalScale&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hopton|first1=Matthew E.|last2=White|first2=Denis|title=A simplified ecological footprint at a regional scale|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|date=2012|volume=111|pages=279–286|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2011.07.005}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 August 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, biocapacity results will be applied to their ecological footprint to determine how much they may contribute or take away from sustainable development.

In general, biocapacity is the amount of resources available to people at a specific moment in time to a specific population ([[resource|supply]]) and to differentiate between ecological footprint – that is the demand constructed on behalf of a '''regional ecosystem'''.&lt;ref name=RegionalScale /&gt; Biocapacity is able to determine the human impacts on Earth. By determining productivity of land, hence the resources available for human consumption, biocapacity will be able to predict and perhaps examine the effects on the ecosystems closely based on collected results of human consumption.
.The biocapacity of an area is calculated by multiplying the actual physical area by the yield factor and the appropriate equivalence factor. Biocapacity is usually expressed in [[global hectare|global hectares (gha)]].&lt;ref name=Serres&gt;{{cite web|title=Bioresources, Biocapacity of Ecosystems, and related terms|url=http://institutmichelserres.ens-lyon.fr/spip.php?article37|website=Michel Serres Institute: for resources and public goods|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since global hectares is able to convert [[Consumer (food chain)|human consumptions]] like food and water into a measurement, biocapacity can be applied to determine the [[carrying capacity]] of the Earth.

'''Biological exponential growth''' is the exponential growth of biological organisms. When the resources availability is unlimited in the [[habitat]], the [[population]] of an [[organism]] living in the habitat grows in an [[Exponential growth|exponential]] or geometric fashion. Population growth in which the number of individuals increase by a constant multiple in each generation. The potential for population growth can be demonstrated in the laboratory under conditions that provide abundant resources and space. For example, a few fruit flies in a large culture jar containing an abundant food source may reproduce rapidly. One female fruit fly may lay more than 50 eggs. Reproductive adults develop in about 14 days, with approximately equal numbers of male and female offspring. For each female that began the population, 50 flies are expected 2 weeks later. Each female in the second generation produces 50 more flies after 2 more weeks, and so on. In other words, the population is experiencing exponential growth.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Miller and Stephen B. Harley zoology 4th edition&lt;/ref&gt; Slow exponential growth is when a population grows slowly yet exponential because the population has long live spans. While a rapid exponential growth refers to a population that grows ( and dies ) rapidly because the population has short life spans.

Resource availability is obviously essential for the unimpeded growth of a population. Ideally, when resources in the habitat are unlimited, each species has the ability to realise fully its innate potential to grow in number, as [[Charles Darwin]] observed while developing his theory of [[natural selection]].

If, in a hypothetical population of size ''N'', the birth rates (per capita) are represented as ''b'' and death rates (per capita) as ''d'', then the increase or decrease in ''N'' during a time period ''t'' will be:

&lt;math&gt;dN/dt=(b-d)N&lt;/math&gt;

(b-d) is called the 'intrinsic rate of natural increase' and is a very important parameter chosen for assessing the impacts of any biotic or [[Abiotic components|abiotic factor]] on population growth.

Any species growing exponentially under unlimited resource conditions can reach enormous [[Population density|population densities]] in a short time. Darwin showed how even a slow growing animal like the [[elephant]] could reach an enormous population if there were unlimited resources for its growth in its habitat.

[[File:Czone chorover et al catalina jemez czo.png|thumb|Earth's Critical Zone. Illustration by Critical Zone Observatories (CZO) based on a figure in Chorover et al. 2007.]]

'''Earth's critical zone''' is the “[[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]], near surface environment in which complex interactions involving rock, soil, water, air, and living [[organism]]s regulate the natural habitat and determine the availability of life-sustaining resources” (National Research Council, 2001).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/9981/chapter/1|title=Front Matter {{!}} Basic Research Opportunities in Earth Science {{!}} The National Academies Press|doi=10.17226/9981}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Critical Zone, surface and near-surface environment, sustains nearly all [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Critical Zone is an interdisciplinary field of research exploring the interactions among the land surface, [[vegetation]], and water bodies, and extends through the [[Soil science|pedosphere]], unsaturated [[vadose zone]], and saturated [[groundwater]] zone. Critical Zone science is the integration of Earth surface processes (such as [[Landscape evolution model|landscape evolution]], [[weathering]], [[hydrology]], [[geochemistry]], and [[ecology]]) at multiple spatial and temporal scales and across anthropogenic gradients. These processes impact mass and energy exchange necessary for [[biomass]] productivity, chemical cycling, and water storage.

The Critical Zone is studied at [[Critical Zone Observatories]],where multiple scientific communities study various aspects of the Critical Zone that can lead to synthesized understanding of complex systems.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles and Dynamics of the Critical Zone|last=Giardino|first=John|last2=Houser|first2=Christ|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|year=2015|isbn=9780444633699|location=|pages=1–4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Tsakalotos]] first introduced the term "Critical Zone" in chemistry literature to describe the binary mixture of two fluids, but has since been adopted to refer to the 'connection of vegetation to soil and weathered materials' by [[Gail Ashley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Where are we headed? "Soft" rock research into the new millennium.|journal=Geological Society of America Abstract/Program|volume=30, p, A-148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2003, scientists attended the first Weathering System Science Workshop.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Participants agreed to promote outreach activities to broaden the profile of involved Earth scientists and crafted a set of questions that would drive further development of Weathering System Science. This field of science was considered to include all aspects of chemistry, biology, physics, and geology of the Critical Zone.

The Weather System Science Consortium was established in early 2004 and later was changed to the Critical Zone Exploration Network (CZEN) in 2006.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In October 2005 WSSC/CZEN solicitated a call for proposals to initiate seed sites that would help grow and establish a critical zone network. In tota, 10 sites have been awarded grants, and 9 sites have received continued funding.

In 2005 the [[University of Delaware]] hosted an NSF-sponsored workshop ([https://web.archive.org/web/20070910021929/http://ag.udel.edu/plsc/Conference/ Frontiers in Exploration of the Critical Zone]) that resulted in a call by scientists for an international initiative to study the critical zone. As key parts of that initiative, the scientists called for the development of an international Critical Zone initiative and a systematic approach to the investigation of processes in the critical zone across a broad array of sciences, including geology, soil science, biology, ecology, chemistry, geochemistry, geomorphology and hydrology. A booklet (Frontiers in Exploration of the Critical Zone) was produced from the meeting.

On July 24, 2006 NSF posted a solicitation for proposals for [https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=500044&amp;org=NSF&amp;sel_org=NSF&amp;from=fund Critical Zone Observatories] (CZO) within the Division of Earth Sciences. See https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=500044

Established in 2009, the Delaware Environmental Institute (DENIN) [http://www.denin.udel.edu] is a multidisciplinary initiative bringing together scientists, engineers and policy specialists to  provide solutions to pressing environmental needs and produce strategies to address emerging environmental challenges by conducting research and promoting and coordinating knowledge partnerships that integrate environmental science, engineering and policy. DENIN fosters a culture of scholarship that leverages the combined talents of affiliates and fellows through collaborative working groups, joint proposal development and, where synergistic, project resource coordination.

{{refimprove|date=September 2013}}
An '''electret''' (formed of ''electr-'' from "[[electricity]]" and ''-et'' from "[[magnet]]") is a [[dielectric]] material that has a quasi-permanent [[electric charge]] or [[dipole]] [[polarization (electrostatics)|polarisation]]. An electret generates internal and external [[electric field]]s, and is the [[electrostatic]] equivalent of a [[permanent magnet]]. Although [[Oliver Heaviside]] coined this term in 1885, materials with electret properties were already known to science and had been studied since the early 1700s. One particular example is the [[electrophorus]], a device consisting of a slab with electret properties and a separate metal plate. The electrophorus was originally invented by [[Johan Carl Wilcke]] in Sweden and again by [[Alessandro Volta]] in Italy.

== Similarity to magnets ==
Electrets, like magnets, are dipoles. Another similarity is the radiant fields: They produce an electrostatic field (as opposed to a magnetic field) around their perimeter. When a magnet and an electret are near one another, a rather unusual phenomenon occurs: while stationary, neither has any effect on one another.  However, when an electret is moved with respect to a magnetic pole, a force is felt which acts perpendicular to the magnetic field, pushing the electret along a path 90 degrees to the expected direction of 'push' as would be felt with another magnet.

== Similarity to capacitors ==
There is a similarity between an electret and the dielectric layer used in [[capacitors]]; the difference is that dielectrics in capacitors have an induced polarisation that is only transient, dependent on the potential applied on the dielectric, while dielectrics with electret properties exhibit quasi-permanent charge storage or dipole polarisation in addition. Some materials also display [[ferroelectricity]]; i.e. they react to the external fields with a [[hysteresis]] of the polarisation; ferro-electrics can retain the polarisation permanently because they are in thermo-dynamic equilibrium, and are used in [[ferroelectric capacitor]]s. Although electrets are only in a [[metastable state]], those fashioned from very low leakage materials can retain excess charge or polarisation for many years. An [[electret microphone]] is a type of condenser microphone that eliminates the need for a power supply by using a permanently charged material.

An electret is a stable dielectric material with a quasi-permanently embedded static electric charge (which, due to the high resistance of the material, will not decay for time periods of up to hundreds of years) and/or a quasi-permanently oriented dipole polarisation. The name comes from electron (Greek word for amber) and magnet and was coined by Oliver Heaviside in 1885; drawing analogy to the formation of a magnet by alignment of magnetic domains in a piece of iron. Historically, electrets were made by first melting a suitable dielectric material such as a polymer or wax that contains polar molecules, and then allowing it to re-solidify in a powerful electrostatic field. The polar molecules of the dielectric align themselves to the direction of the electrostatic field, producing a dipole electret with a permanent electrostatic 'bias'. Modern electrets are usually made by embedding excess charges into a highly insulating dielectric, e.g. by means of an electron beam, a corona discharge, injection from an electron gun, electric breakdown across a gap or a dielectric barrier, etc.

== Electret types ==
There are two types of electrets:
* '''Real-charge electrets''' which contain excess charge of one or both polarities, either
** on the dielectric's surfaces (a [[surface charge]])
** within the dielectric's volume (a [[space charge]])
* '''Oriented-dipole electrets''' contain oriented (aligned) dipoles. [[Ferroelectric]] materials are one variant of these.

Cellular space charge electrets with internal bipolar charges at the voids provide a new class of electret materials, that mimic ferroelectrics, hence they are known as [[ferroelectret]]s. Ferroelectrets display strong [[piezoelectricity]], comparable to ceramic piezoelectric materials.

Some dielectric materials are capable of acting both ways.

== Materials ==
Electret materials are quite common in nature.  [[Quartz]] and other forms of silicon dioxide, for example, are naturally occurring electrets. Today, most electrets are made from synthetic [[polymer]]s, e.g. [[fluoropolymer]]s, [[polypropylene]], [[polyethyleneterephthalate]], etc. Real-charge electrets contain either positive or negative excess charges or both, while oriented-dipole electrets contain oriented dipoles. The quasi-permanent internal or external electric fields created by electrets can be exploited in various applications.

== Manufacture==
Bulk electrets can be prepared by cooling a suitable [[dielectric]] material within a strong electric field, after melting it. The field repositions the charge carriers or aligns the dipoles within the material. When the material cools, solidification ''freezes'' them in position.  Materials used for electrets are usually [[wax]]es, [[polymers]] or [[resin]]s. One of the earliest recipes consists of 45% [[carnauba wax]], 45% white [[rosin]], and 10% white [[beeswax]], melted, mixed together, and left to cool in a static electric field of several kilovolts/cm. The [[thermo-dielectric effect]], related to this process, was first described by Brazilian researcher [[Joaquim Costa Ribeiro]].

Electrets can also be manufactured by embedding excess negative charge within a dielectric using a [[particle accelerator]], or by ''stranding'' charges on, or near, the surface using [[high voltage]] [[corona discharge]]s, a process called ''corona charging''. Excess charge within an electret decays exponentially. The [[decay constant]] is a function of the material's relative [[dielectric constant]] and its bulk [[resistivity]]. Materials with extremely high resistivity, such as [[polytetrafluoroethylene|PTFE]], may retain excess charge for many hundreds of years{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}. Most commercially produced electrets are based on [[fluoropolymer]]s (e.g. [[amorphous]] Teflon) machined to thin films.

== Applications ==

Electret materials have found commercial and technical interest. For example, they are used in [[electret microphone]]s and in [[copy machine]]s. They are also used in some types of [[air filter]]s, for electrostatic collection of dust particles, in electret ion chambers for measuring [[ionizing radiation]] or [[radon]] and in Vibration [[Energy Harvesting]].&lt;ref&gt;http://tikalon.com/blog/blog.php?article=2011/electret&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite emission reductions from automobiles and more fuel-efficient and less polluting [[turbofan]] and [[turboprop]] engines, the rapid growth of [[air travel]] in the past years contributes to an increase in total pollution attributable to [[aviation]]. From 1992 to 2005, passenger kilometers increased 5.2 percent per year. And in the [[European Union]], [[greenhouse gas]] emissions from aviation increased by 87 percent between 1990 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Climate change: Commission proposes bringing air transport into EU Emissions Trading Scheme | publisher = EU press release | date = 2006-12-20 | url = http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/06/1862 |accessdate = 2008-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Press Airlines Writer. Houston Chron., 17 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; released by most aircraft in flight through the burning of fuels such as [[jet fuel|Jet-A]] (turbine aircraft) or [[Avgas]] (piston aircraft), the aviation industry also contributes [[greenhouse gas]] emissions from ground [[airport]] vehicles and those used by passengers and staff to access airports, as well as through emissions generated by the production of energy used in airport buildings, the manufacture of [[aircraft]] and the construction of airport infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;Horvath A, Chester M (2008).

Info: University of California Transportation Center, UC Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the principal [[greenhouse gas]] emission from powered aircraft in flight is CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, other emissions may include [[nitric oxide]] and [[nitrogen dioxide]] (together termed [[oxides of nitrogen]] or NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), [[water vapour]] and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] (soot and sulfate particles), sulfur oxides, [[carbon monoxide]] (which bonds with [[oxygen]] to become CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; immediately upon release), incompletely burned [[hydrocarbons]], [[tetraethyllead]] (piston aircraft only), and radicals such as [[hydroxyl]], depending on the type of aircraft in use.&lt;ref name="IPCC" /&gt; Emissions weighting factor (EWFs) i.e., the factor by which aviation {{CO2}} emissions should be multiplied to get the {{CO2}}-equivalent emissions for annual fleet average conditions is in the range 1.3–2.9.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-011-0168-8 Valuing the non-CO2 climate impacts of aviation] Climatic Change, 111 (3–4) s. 559–579 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanisms and cumulative effects of aviation on climate ===
In 1999 the contribution of civil aircraft-in-flight to global CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions was estimated to be around 2%.&lt;ref name="IPCC"&gt;[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc/aviation/index.htm IPCC, ''Aviation and the Global Atmosphere: A Special Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change'' (1999), Cambridge University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the cases of high-altitude [[airliners]] which frequently fly near or in the [[stratosphere]], non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; altitude-sensitive effects may increase the total impact on anthropogenic (human-made) [[climate change]] significantly.&lt;ref name="IPCC" /&gt; A 2007 report from [[Environmental Change Institute]] / Oxford University posits a range closer to 4 percent cumulative effect.&lt;ref&gt;http://climatecare.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Calculating-the-Environmental-Impact-of-Aviation-Emissions.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Subsonic aircraft-in-flight contribute to climate change&lt;ref name="IPCC" /&gt; in four ways:

====Carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)====
CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from aircraft-in-flight are the most significant and best understood&lt;ref name="Sausen"&gt;Sausen; Ivar Isaksen, Volker Grewe, Didier Hauglustaine, David S. Lee, Gunnar Myhre, Marcus O. KÖhler, Giovanni Pitari, Ulrich Schumann, Frode Stordal and Christos Zerefos, Robert (2005).

Gebrüder Borntraeger. 14 (4): 555–561. doi:10.1127/0941-2948/2005/0049. Retrieved 2017-02-03.&lt;/ref&gt; element of aviation's total contribution to climate change. The level and effects of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions are currently believed to be broadly the same regardless of altitude (i.e. they have the same atmospheric effects as ground-based emissions). In 1992, emissions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from aircraft were estimated at around 2 percent of all such anthropogenic emissions, and that year the atmospheric concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; attributable to aviation was around 1 percent of the total anthropogenic increase since the industrial revolution, having accumulated primarily over just the last 50 years.&lt;ref name="IPCC_chapter4"&gt;[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc/aviation/006.htm#spm41 ''Aviation and the Global Atmosphere: A Special Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change'' (1999), Cambridge University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oxides of nitrogen (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;)====
At the high altitudes flown by large jet airliners around the [[tropopause]], emissions of NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; are particularly effective in forming [[ozone]] (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in the upper [[troposphere]]. High altitude (8–13&amp;nbsp;km) NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; emissions result in greater concentrations of O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; than surface NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, and these in turn have a greater global warming effect. The effect of O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; surface concentrations are regional and local, but it becomes well mixed globally at mid and upper tropospheric levels.&lt;ref name=Derwent2002&gt;{{citation

NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; emissions also reduce ambient levels of [[methane]], another greenhouse gas, resulting in a climate cooling effect. But this effect does not offset the O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; forming effect of NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. It is now believed that aircraft [[sulfur]] and water emissions in the [[stratosphere]] tend to deplete O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, partially offsetting the NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-induced O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; increases. These effects have not been quantified.&lt;ref name="IPCC_chapter4" /&gt;    This problem does not apply to aircraft that fly lower in the troposphere, such as light aircraft or many commuter aircraft.

====Water vapor (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), and contrails====
[[File:Contrails.jpg|thumb|[[Condensation trails|Contrails]]]]
[[File:Cirrus clouds cold day.jpg|thumb|[[Cirrus cloud]] formation]]

One of the products of burning hydrocarbons with oxygen is water vapour, a greenhouse gas. Water vapour produced by aircraft engines at high altitude, under certain atmospheric conditions, condenses into droplets to form [[condensation trails]], or contrails. Contrails are visible line clouds that form in cold, humid atmospheres and are thought to have a global warming effect (though one less significant than either CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions or NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; induced effects).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/SPM2feb07.pdf SPM-2] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114144734/http://www.ipcc.ch/SPM2feb07.pdf |date=14 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrails are uncommon (though by no means rare) from lower-altitude aircraft, or from [[propeller (aircraft)|propeller]]-driven aircraft or rotorcraft.

[[Cirrus cloud]]s have been observed to develop after the persistent formation of contrails and have been found to have a global warming effect over-and-above that of contrail formation alone. There is a degree of scientific uncertainty about the contribution of contrail and cirrus cloud formation to global warming and attempts to estimate aviation's overall climate change contribution do not tend to include its effects on cirrus cloud enhancement.&lt;ref name="Sausen" /&gt; However, a 2015 study found that artificial cloudiness caused by contrail "outbreaks" reduces the difference between daytime and nighttime temperatures. The former are decreased and the latter are increased, in comparison to temperatures the day before and the day after such outbreaks.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhardt, J. &amp; Carleton, A.M. (2015). The impacts of long-lived jet contrail ‘outbreaks’ on surface station diurnal temperature range. Jrnl of Int'l Climatology. Online-early (July).&lt;/ref&gt; On days with outbreaks the day/night temperature difference was diminished by about 6F° in the U.S. South and 5F° in the Midwest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/06/150618122236.htm Jet contrails affect surface temperatures]. Science Daily. 18 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Particulates====
Least significant on a mass basis is the release of soot and sulfate particles. Soot absorbs heat and has a warming effect; sulfate particles reflect radiation and have a small cooling effect. In addition, particles can influence the formation and properties of clouds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Questions &amp; Answers on Aviation &amp; Climate Change | publisher = European Commission | date = 2005-09-17 | url = http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/05/341&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en | accessdate = 2008-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including both line-shaped contrails and naturally-occurring cirrus clouds. The impact of "spreading contrails and cirrus clouds that evolve from them -- collectively known as contrail cirrus -- have a greater radiative forcing (RF) today than all aviation CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions since the first powered airplane flight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kärcher|first1=B.|title=The importance of contrail ice formation for mitigating the climate impact of aviation|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres|date=2016|volume=121|issue=7|pages=3497–3505|doi=10.1002/2015JD024696}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the particles emitted by aircraft engines, the soot particles are thought to be most important for contrail formation since they are large enough to serve as condensation nuclei for water vapor. All aircraft powered by combustion will release some amount of soot; although, recent studies suggest that reducing the aromatic content of jet fuel decreases the amount of soot produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corporan|first1=E., et al.|title=Emissions characteristics of a turbine engine and research combustor burning a Fischer-Tropsch jet fuel|journal=Energy &amp; Fuels|date=2007|volume=21|issue=5|pages=2615–2626|doi=10.1021/ef070015j}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lobo|first1=P.|last2=Hagen|first2=D.E.|last3=Whitefield|first3=P.D.|title=Comparison of PM emissions from a commercial jet engine burning conventional, biomass, and Fischer-Tropsch fuels|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|date=2011|volume=45|issue=24|pages=10744–10749|doi=10.1021/es201902e|pmid=22043875}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=R.H., et al.|title=Biofuel blending reduces particle emissions from aircraft engines at cruise conditions|journal=Nature|date=2017|volume=543|issue=7645|pages=411–415|doi=10.1038/nature21420|pmid=28300096|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature21420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greenhouse gas emissions per passenger kilometre===

====Averaged emissions====
Emissions of passenger aircraft per passenger kilometre vary extensively because of differing factors such as the size and type of aircraft, the altitude and the percentage of passenger or freight capacity of a particular flight, and the distance of the journey and number of stops en route. Also, the effect of a given amount of emissions on climate ([[radiative forcing]]) is greater at higher altitudes: [[#Total_climate_effects|see below]]. Some representative figures for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions are provided by LIPASTO's survey of average direct emissions (not accounting for high-altitude radiative effects) of airliners expressed as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent per passenger kilometre:&lt;ref&gt;[http://lipasto.vtt.fi/yksikkopaastot/henkiloliikennee/ilmaliikennee/ilmae.htm Average passenger aircraft emissions and energy consumption per passenger kilometre in Finland 2008] accessed 3 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

* Domestic, short distance, less than {{convert|463|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}: 257 g/km CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or 259 g/km (14.7 oz/mile) CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e
* Domestic, long distance, greater than {{convert|463|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}: 177 g/km CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or 178 g/km (10.1 oz/mile) CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e
* Long distance flights: 113 g/km CO&lt;sub &gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or 114 g/km (6.5 oz/mile) CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e

These emissions are similar to a four-seat car with one person on board;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lipasto.vtt.fi/yksikkopaastot/henkiloliikennee/tieliikennee/henkiloautote/hayhte.htm Average emissions and energy consumption per vehicle kilometre of cars in Finland in 2009] accessed 3 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; however, flying trips often cover longer distances than would be undertaken by car, so the total emissions are much higher. For perspective, per passenger a typical economy-class New York to Los Angeles round trip produces about 715&amp;nbsp;kg (1574&amp;nbsp;lb) of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (but is equivalent to 1,917&amp;nbsp;kg (4,230&amp;nbsp;lb) of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; when the high altitude "climatic forcing" effect is taken into account).&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, Joseph (2010, 13-Dec), ''[http://www.yesmagazine.org/planet/kicking-the-habit-air-travel-in-a-time-of-climate-change Kicking the Habit: Air Travel in the Time of Climate Change]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the categories of flights above, emissions from scheduled jet flights are substantially higher than turboprop or chartered jet flights. About 60 percent of aviation emissions arise from international flights, and these flights are not covered by the Kyoto Protocol and its emissions reduction targets.&lt;ref name=Owen&gt;Owen B, Lee DS, Lim L, 2010/04/01 P- (2010).

====Emissions by passenger class, and effects of seating configuration====
In 2013 the World Bank published a study of the effect on {{CO2}} emissions of its staff's travel in business class or first class, versus using economy class.&lt;ref name="WB-2013"&gt;Bofinger, H.; Strand, J. (2013). [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2013/05/31/000158349_20130531105457/Rendered/PDF/WPS6471.pdf Calculating the carbon footprint from different classes of air travel]. World Bank, Development Research Group, Env. &amp; Energy Team. 40pp. May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the factors considered was that these premium classes displace proportionately more economy seats for the same total aircraft space capacity, and the associated differing load factors and weight factors. This was not accounted for in prior standard carbon accounting methods. The study concluded that when considering respective average load factors (percent of occupied seats) in each of the seating classes, the carbon footprints of business class and first class are three-times and nine-times higher than economy class.&lt;ref name="WB-2013"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post (2013).

By Irene Kwan. Int'l Counc. on Clean Transport.&lt;/ref&gt; A related article by the International Council on Clean Transport notes further regarding the effect of seating configurations on carbon emissions that:&lt;ref name="ICCT-2013"/&gt;

{{quote|The A380 is marketed as a "green giant" and one of the most environmentally advanced aircraft out there. But that spin is based on a maximum-capacity aircraft configuration, or about 850 economy passengers. In reality, a typical A380 aircraft has 525 seats. Its fuel performance is comparable to that of a B747-400 ER and even about 15 percent worse than a B777-300ER on a passenger-mile basis (calculated using Piano-5 on a flight from AUH to LHR, assuming an 80 percent passenger load factor, and in-service fleet average seat counts).}}

===Total climate effects===
In attempting to aggregate and quantify the total climate impact of aircraft emissions the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) has estimated that aviation's total climate impact is some 2–4 times that of its direct CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions alone (excluding the potential impact of cirrus cloud enhancement).&lt;ref name="IPCC" /&gt;  This is measured as [[radiative forcing]]. While there is uncertainty about the exact level of impact of NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and water vapour, governments have accepted the broad scientific view that they do have an effect. Globally in 2005, aviation contributed "possibly as much as 4.9 percent of radiative forcing."&lt;ref name="Owen"/&gt;   [[Air transport and the environment (United Kingdom)#Airport development strategy|UK government policy]] statements have stressed the need for aviation to address its total climate change impacts and not simply the impact of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft_aviation/documents/divisionhomepage/029650.hcsp ''The Future of Air Transport White Paper'' (2003), HMSO] "The aviation industry is encouraged to take account of, and where appropriate reduce, its contribution to global warming...The impact of aviation on climate change is increased over that of direct CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions alone by some of the other emissions released and their specific effects at altitude".&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPCC has estimated that aviation is responsible for around 3.5 percent of anthropogenic climate change, a figure which includes both CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; induced effects. The IPCC has produced scenarios estimating what this figure could be in 2050. The central case estimate is that aviation's contribution could grow to 5 percent of the total contribution by 2050 if action is not taken to tackle these emissions, though the highest scenario is 15%.&lt;ref name="IPCC" /&gt; Moreover, if other industries achieve significant cuts in their own greenhouse gas emissions, aviation's share as a proportion of the remaining emissions could also rise.

===Future emission levels===

Even though there have been significant improvements in [[fuel efficiency]] through aircraft technology and operational management as described here, these improvements are being continually eclipsed by the increase in air traffic volume.

A December 2015 report finds that aircraft could generate {{val|43|ul=Gt}} of carbon pollution through to 2050, consuming almost 5 percent of the remaining global climate budget.  Without regulation, global aviation emissions may triple by mid-century and could emit more than {{val|3|u=Gt}} of carbon annually under a high-growth, business-as-usual scenario.  Efforts to bring aviation emissions under an effective global accord have so far largely failed, despite there being a number of technological and operational improvements on offer.&lt;ref name="center-for-biological-diversity-2015"&gt;

=== Scope for improvement ===

==== Aircraft efficiency ====

While it is true that late model jet aircraft are significantly more fuel efficient (and thus emit less {{CO2}} in particular) than the earliest jet airliners,&lt;ref&gt;IATA/ATAG, ''Aviation &amp; the Environment'' (1999)  "Aircraft fuel efficiency has improved by some 50 percent over the past 30 years"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peeters-2005"&gt;Peeters P.M., Middel J., Hoolhorst A. (2005). [http://www.transportenvironment.org/publications/fuel-efficiency-commercial-aircraft-overview-historical-and-future-trends Fuel efficiency of commercial aircraft — An overview of historical and future trends]. National Aerospace Laboratory. NLR-CR-2005-669, 37pp.&lt;/ref&gt; new airliner models in the 2000s were barely more efficient on a seat-mile basis than the latest piston-powered airliners of the late-1950s (e.g., [[Lockheed Starliner|Constellation L-1649-A]] and [[Douglas DC-7|DC-7C]]).&lt;ref name="Peeters-2005"/&gt; Claims for a high gain in efficiency for airliners over recent decades (while true in part) has been biased high in most studies, by using the early inefficient models of jet airliners as a baseline. Those aircraft were optimized for increased revenue, including increased speed and cruising altitude, and were quite fuel inefficient in comparison to their piston-powered forerunners.&lt;ref name="Peeters-2005"/&gt;

Today, turboprop aircraft – probably in part because of their lower cruising speeds and altitudes (similar to the earlier piston-powered airliners) compared to jet airliners – play an obvious role in the overall fuel efficiency of major airlines that have regional carrier subsidiaries.&lt;ref name="ICCT-Kwan"&gt;[http://www.theicct.org/blogs/staff/back-future-return-turboprop Back to the Future: Return of the Turboprop?]. By Irene Kwan. Int'l Counc. on Clean Transport. 3 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, although [[Alaska Airlines]] scored at the top of a 2011–2012 fuel efficiency ranking, if its large regional carrier – turbo-prop equipped [[Horizon Air]] – were dropped from the lumped-in consideration, the airline's ranking would be somewhat lower, as noted in the ranking study.

Aircraft manufacturers are striving for reductions in both {{CO2}} and NOx emissions with each new generation of design of aircraft and engine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/research/growth/pdf/acare_press_release_revised_8-11.pdf Advisory Council for Aeronautical Research in Europe (ACARE) ''Strategic Research Agenda'' (2002)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128074432/http://ec.europa.eu/research/growth/pdf/acare_press_release_revised_8-11.pdf |date=28 November 2007 }} "These objectives include, inter alia, a 50 percent cut in {{CO2}} and 80 percent in Nox emissions" [for new aircraft introduced in 2020 relative to new aircraft introduced in 2000].&lt;/ref&gt; While the introduction of more modern aircraft represents an opportunity to reduce emissions per passenger kilometre flown, aircraft are major investments that endure for many decades, and replacement of the international fleet is therefore a long-term proposition which will greatly delay realizing the climate benefits of many kinds of improvements. Engines can be changed at some point, but nevertheless airframes have a long life.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Moreover, rather than being linear from one year to the next the improvements to efficiency tend to diminish over time, as reflected in the histories of both piston and jet powered aircraft.&lt;ref name="Peeters-2005"/&gt;

A 2014 [[life-cycle assessment]] of the cradle-to-grave reduction in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by a [[carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer]] (CFRP) airliner such as a Boeing 787 – including its manufacture, operations and eventual disposal – has shown that by 2050 such aircraft could reduce the airline industry's CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by 14–15%, compared use of conventional airliners.&lt;ref name="Timmis"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Timmis | first1 = A. | last2 = Hodzic | first2 = A. | last3 = Koh | first3 = L. | last4 = Bonner | first4 = M. | last5 = Soutis | first5 = C. | last6 = Schafer | first6 = A. | last7 = Dray | first7 = L. | year = 2014 | title = Environmental impact assessment of aviation emission reduction through the implementation of composite materials | url = https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/21192| journal = The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment | volume =  20| issue = 2| pages =  233–243| doi = 10.1007/s11367-014-0824-0 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefit of CFRP technology is not higher than that amount of reduction, despite the lighter weight and substantially lower fuel consumption of such aircraft, "because of the limited fleet penetration by 2050 and the increased demand for air travel due to lower operating costs." &lt;ref name="Timmis"/&gt;

====Operations efficiency====
Research projects such as Boeing's [[ecoDemonstrator]] program have sought to identify ways of improving the efficiency of commercial aircraft operations. The U.S. government has encouraged such research through grant programs, including the FAA's Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions and Noise (CLEEN) program, and NASA's Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) Project.

Adding an electric drive to the airplane's nose wheel may improve fuel efficiency during ground handling. This addition would allow taxiing without the use of the main engines.&lt;ref&gt;EOS magazine November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://evworld.com/news.cfm?newsid=25180 Fuel Cell-powered Electric Nose Wheel Nears Flight Tests], EV World, 9 Feb 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/tests-prove-electric-drive-concept-200792/ Tests prove electric-drive concept], Flight Global 9 Aug 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another proposed change is the integrating of an [[Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System]] to the airstrips of airports. Some companies such as Airbus are currently researching this possibility. The adding of EMALS would allow the civilian aircraft to use considerably less fuel (as a lot of fuel is used during take off, in comparison to cruising, when calculated per km flown). The idea is to have the aircraft take off at regular aircraft speed, and only use the catapult for take-off, not for landing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treehugger.com/aviation/civilian-airplanes-could-one-day-take-off-electric-catapults.html Civilian aircraft using EMALS]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/technology-quarterly/21598325-electromagnetic-launchers-hurling-objects-electrical-energy-giving Civilian aircraft using EMALS ref 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other opportunities arise from the optimization of airline timetables, route networks and flight frequencies to increase load factors (minimize the number of empty seats flown),&lt;ref&gt;International Civil Aviation ''Organization Operational Opportunities to Minimize Fuel Use and Reduce Emissions'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;  together with the optimization of airspace. However, these are each one-time gains, and as these opportunities are successively fulfilled, diminishing returns can be expected from the remaining opportunities.

Another possible reduction of the climate-change impact is the limitation of cruise altitude of aircraft. This would lead to a significant reduction in high-altitude contrails for a marginal trade-off of increased flight time and an estimated 4 percent increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Drawbacks of this solution include very limited airspace capacity to do this, especially in Europe and North America and increased fuel burn because jet aircraft are less efficient at lower cruise altitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.geomatics.cv.imperial.ac.uk/html/ResearchActivities/..%5C..%5Cdocuments%5Cpublications%5Cyear2002%5Cwp25_williams_etal.pdf | last1 = Williams | first2 = Victoria | author2 = Robert B.

While they are not suitable for long-haul or transoceanic flights, turboprop aircraft used for commuter flights bring two significant benefits: they often burn considerably less fuel per passenger mile, and they typically fly at lower altitudes, well inside the tropopause, where there are no concerns about ozone or contrail production.

==== Alternative fuels ====
{{Main|Aviation_fuel#Chemical_composition|Aviation_fuel#LNG}}
Some scientists and companies such as [[GE Aviation]] and [[Virgin Fuels]] are researching [[biofuel]] technology for use in jet aircraft.&lt;ref name="CBC24Feb08"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2008/02/24/biofuel-flight.html |title=Airline flies jumbo jet powered by biofuel |accessdate=2008-02-24 |last=CBC News |date=February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some aircraft engines, like the [[Wilksch WAM series|Wilksch WAM120]] can (being a 2-stroke Diesel engine) run on [[straight vegetable oil]]. Also, a number of [[Lycoming Engines|Lycoming engines]] [[Aviation fuel#Chemical composition|run well on ethanol]].

In addition, there are also several tests done combining regular petrofuels with a biofuel. For example, as part of this test [[Virgin Atlantic Airways]] flew a [[Boeing 747]] from London [[Heathrow Airport]] to Amsterdam [[Schiphol Airport]] on 24 February 2008, with one engine burning a combination of [[coconut oil]] and [[Attalea speciosa|babassu oil]].&lt;ref name="CBC24Feb08"/&gt; [[Greenpeace]]'s chief scientist [[Doug Parr]] said that the flight was "high-altitude [[greenwash]]" and that producing organic oils to make [[biofuel]] could lead to deforestation and a large increase in greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="CBC24Feb08"/&gt; Also, the majority of the world's aircraft are not large jetliners but smaller piston aircraft, and with major modifications many are capable of using [[ethanol]] as a fuel.&lt;ref name="SDSUProjects"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.age85.org/ActiveProjects.htm|title = Active Projects|accessdate = 2008-02-19|last = South Dakota State University |authorlink = |year = 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928211751/http://www.age85.org/ActiveProjects.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another consideration is the vast amount of land that would be necessary to provide the biomass feedstock needed to support the needs of aviation, both civil and military.&lt;ref&gt;Rapier R (2011, 20-Jan).

In December 2008, an [[Air New Zealand]] jet completed the world's first commercial aviation test flight partially using [[jatropha]]-based fuel. Jatropha, used for biodiesel, can thrive on marginal agricultural land where many trees and crops won't grow, or would produce only slow growth yields.&lt;ref name=jat&gt;Ron Oxburgh.

In January 2009, [[Continental Airlines]] used a sustainable biofuel to power a commercial aircraft for the first time in North America. This marks the first sustainable biofuel demonstration flight by a commercial carrier using a twin-engined aircraft, a [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-800]], powered by CFM International CFM56-7B engines. The biofuel blend included components derived from algae and jatropha plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theengineer.co.uk/Articles/Article.aspx?liArticleID=309553 Sustainable flight]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''The Engineer Online'', 12 January 2009.

One fuel biofuel alternative to [[avgas]] that is under development is [[Swift Fuel]]. Swift fuel was approved as a test fuel by [[ASTM International]] in December 2009, allowing the company to continue their research and to pursue certification testing. Mary Rusek, president and co-owner of Swift Enterprises predicted at that time that "100SF will be comparably priced, environmentally friendlier and more fuel-efficient than other general aviation fuels on the market".&lt;ref name="AvWeb15Dec09"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/EffortsMoveForwardToProduceAlternativeAviationFuels_201691-1.html|title = Efforts Move Forward To Produce Alternative Aviation Fuels |accessdate = 2009-03-05|last =  Grady |first = Mary |date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="InsideIndiana15Dec09"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/newsitem.asp?ID=39195#middle |title=Indiana Airline Fuel Developer Moves Ahead With Testing |accessdate=2009-12-17 |last=Purdue Research Park |date=December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110118042636/http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/newsitem.asp?ID=39195#middle |archivedate=18 January 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 2011, revised international aviation fuel standards officially allow commercial airlines to blend conventional jet fuel with up to 50 percent biofuels. The renewable fuels "can be blended with conventional commercial and military jet fuel through requirements in the newly issued edition of ASTM D7566, Specification for Aviation Turbine Fuel Containing Synthesized Hydrocarbons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/07/50-percent-biofuels-now-allowed-in-jet-fuel |title=50 Percent Biofuels Now Allowed in Jet Fuel |date=1 July 2011 |work=Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, the FAA announced it is awarding $7.7 million to eight companies to advance the development of drop-in commercial aviation biofuels, with a special focus on ATJ (alcohol to jet) fuel. As part of its CAAFI (Commercial Aviation Alternative Fuel Initiative) and CLEEN (Continuous Lower Emissions, Energy and Noise) programs, the FAA plans to assist in the development of a sustainable fuel (from alcohols, sugars, biomass, and organic matter such as pyrolysis oils) that can be "dropped in" to aircraft without changing current infrastructure. The grant will also be used to research how the fuels affect engine durability and quality control standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/12/faa-awards-7-7-million-for-advancement-of-aviation-biofuels |title=FAA Awards $7.7 Million for Advancement of Aviation Biofuels

Finally, [[liquified natural gas]] is another fuel that is used in some airplanes. Besides the lower GHG emissions (depending from where the natural gas was obtained from), another major benefit to airplane operators is the price, which is far lower than the price for jet fuel.

===Reducing air travel===

====Personal choices and social pressure====

The German video short ''The Bill''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWfb0VMCQHE "The Bill"], by Peter Wedel, distributed by GermanWatch.&lt;/ref&gt; explores how travel and its impacts are commonly viewed in everyday developed-world life, and the social pressures that are at play. British writer George Marshall has investigated common rationalizations that act as barriers to making personal choices to travel less, or to justify recent trips. In an informal research project, "one you are welcome to join", he says, he deliberately steered conversations with people who are attuned to climate change problems to questions about recent long-distance flights and why the travel was justified. Reflecting on actions contrary to their beliefs, he noted, "(i)ntriguing as their dissonance may be, what is especially revealing is that every one of these people has a career that is predicated on the assumption that information is sufficient to generate change – an assumption that a moment's introspection would show them was deeply flawed."&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, G. (2009, 24-July). ''[http://climatedenial.org/2009/07/24/why-we-still-dont-believe-in-climate-change/ Why We Still Don’t Believe In Climate Change]''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Business and professional choices====
{{quote|With most international conferences having hundreds if not thousands of participants, and the bulk of these usually traveling by plane, conference travel is an area where significant reductions in air-travel-related GHG emissions could be made....This does not mean non-attendance.&lt;ref name="Reay-2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reay|first1=David S|title=New Directions: Flying in the face of the climate change convention|journal=Atmospheric Environment|date=2004|volume=38|issue=5|pages=793–794|url=http://www.ghgonline.org/flyingaea.pdf|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For example, by 2003 [[Access Grid|Access Grid technology]] has already been successfully used to host several international conferences,&lt;ref name="Reay-2004"/&gt; and technology has likely progressed substantially since then. The Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research has been systematically studying means to change common institutional and professional practices that have led to large carbon footprints of travel by research scientists, and issued a report.&lt;ref&gt;Le Quéré, C. et al. 2015.

FiveThirtyEight. by Christie Aschwanden. 26 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ending incentives to fly—frequent flyer programs====
Over 130 airlines have "[[frequent flyer program]]s" based at least in part on miles, kilometers, points or segments for flights taken. Globally, such programs included about 163 million people as reported in 2006.&lt;ref name=economist&gt;The Economist (2005, 20-Dec), ''[http://www.economist.com/node/5323615 Frequent-flyer miles — Funny money]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  These programs benefit airlines by habituating people to air travel and, through the mechanics of partnerships with credit card companies and other businesses, in which high profit margin revenue streams can amount to selling free seats for a high price.&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt; The only part of [[United Airlines]] business that was making money when the company filed for bankruptcy in 2002 was its frequent flyer program.&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt;

Concerning business travel, "The ease of international air travel and the fact that, for most of us, the costs are met by our employers, means that ... globe trotting conference travel is often regarded as a perk of the job."&lt;ref name="Reay-2004"/&gt; However, the perk usually is not only the business trip itself, but also the frequent flyer points which the individual accrues by taking the trip, and which can be redeemed later for personal air travel. Thus a [[conflict of interest]] is established, whereby bottom-up pressure may be created within a firm or government agency for travel that is really not necessary. Even when such conflict is not a motivation, the perk of frequent flyer miles can be expected to lead in many cases to personal trips that would not be taken if a ticket had to be paid for with personal funds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.fr/scp/sun/facility/reduce/PDFs/EmissionReductionGuide.pdf UNEP DTIE (Sustainable Consumption &amp; Production Branch)(undated). A Guide to Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction in UN Organizations (DTI/1217/PA). pp.18–19.]&lt;/ref&gt;

By just using an airline-sponsored credit card to pay one's household expenses, personal or business bills, or even expense bills charged to an employer, frequent flyer points can be racked up quickly.&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt; Thus, free travel—for which the individual has to pay nothing extra—becomes a reality. Across society, this too can be expected to lead to much air travel—and greenhouse gas emissions—that otherwise would not occur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://medcaribbean.com/making-the-most-of-your-airlines-miles-credit-cards/ MedCaribbean.com.

''[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1989-10-04/news/8910042722_1_airline-braniff-volz Braniff Will SlimDown, Keep Flying]'', by Kenneth Michael, 4 Oct 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Canadian study said that because of competition no airline could unilaterally end its FFP, but that a national government could use its regulatory power to end the programs broadly, which in Canada's case would also require North America-wide cooperation.&lt;ref name=Treth/&gt; In further analysis, a Scandinavian study which recommended an end to frequent flyer plans said, "the only possible way of prohibiting FFPs successfully now that they have spread from the US to Europe to the Far East would be to do so on a global basis. The basis exists: it could be done by the World Trade Organization."&lt;ref name=Storm/&gt; A recent study which surveyed frequent flyers in the U.K. and Norway, looked into behavioral addition to frequent flying and the "flyer's dilemma" of the conflict between "the social and personal benefits of flying and air travel's impact on climate change."&lt;ref name=Cohen/&gt; It concluded that:

{{quote|Continued growth in both frequent flying practices and concern over air travel's climate impacts are in a dynamic relationship and the question of whether one or the other will reach a tipping point cannot yet be determined. Self-regulation, external regulation, social norms, technology and physical resources will continue to co-constitute the balance. An increasing stigmatisation of 'excessive' air travel may (re)frame flying as more open to collective external mitigation.&lt;ref name=Cohen/&gt;}}

This means government action.

====Potential for governmental constraints on demand====
One means for reducing the environmental impact of aviation is to constrain demand for air travel, through increased fares in place of expanded airport capacity. Several studies have explored this:

*The [[United Kingdom|UK]] study ''Predict and Decide – Aviation, climate change and UK policy'', notes that a 10 percent increase in fares generates a 5–15 percent reduction in demand, and recommends that the British government should manage demand rather than provide for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/research/energy/downloads/predictanddecide.pdf|title = Predict and decide — Aviation, climate change and UK policy|accessdate = 2008-05-31|last = Cairns|first = Dr Sally &amp; Carey Newson|date=September 2006 |pages = 96, section 11.9|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be accomplished via a strategy that presumes "… against the expansion of UK airport capacity" and constrains demand by the use of economic instruments to price air travel less attractively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/research/energy/downloads/predictanddecide.pdf|title = Predict and decide — Aviation, climate change and UK policy|accessdate = 2008-05-31|last = Cairns|first = Dr Sally &amp; Carey Newson|date=September 2006 |pages = 4|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A study published by the campaign group [[Aviation Environment Federation]] (AEF) concludes that by levying £9&amp;nbsp;billion of additional taxes, the annual rate of growth in demand in the UK for air travel would be reduced to&amp;nbsp;2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aef.org.uk/downloads/HiddenCost.pdf |format=PDF |first= Brendon|last= Sewill|title=The Hidden Cost of Flying|accessdate=2007-10-18 |publisher= [[Aviation Environment Federation]] |date= February 2003|pages= 19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ninth report of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] [[Environmental Audit Select Committee]], published in July 2006, recommends that the British government rethink its airport expansion policy and considers ways, particularly via increased taxation, in which future demand can be managed in line with industry performance in achieving fuel efficiencies, so that emissions are not allowed to increase in absolute terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmenvaud/981/98108.htm|title= ''Select Committee on Environmental Audit Ninth Report''|accessdate=2007-11-12 |publisher= [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]] |date= 19 July 2006| pages= paras. 112, 118–125, 113–114 &amp; 126–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International regulation of air travel GHG emissions===
==== Kyoto Protocol 2005 ====

Greenhouse gas emissions from fuel consumption in international aviation, in contrast to those from domestic aviation and from energy use by airports, are excluded from the scope of the first period (2008–2012) of the [[Kyoto Protocol]], as are the non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; climate effects. Instead, governments agreed to work through the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) to limit or reduce emissions and to find a solution to the allocation of emissions from international aviation in time for the second period of the Kyoto Protocol starting from 2009; however, the Copenhagen climate conference failed to reach an agreement.&lt;ref&gt;GreenAirOnline (2009, 22-Dec). [http://www.greenaironline.com/news.php?viewStory=713 Copenhagen's failure to deliver an aviation emissions deal leaves sector facing an uncertain future].&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research points to this failure as a substantial obstacle to global policy including a {{CO2}} emissions reduction pathway that would [[avoiding dangerous climate change|avoid dangerous climate change]] by keeping the increase in the average global temperature below a 2&amp;nbsp;°C rise.&lt;ref&gt;RTCC (2014). [Planes and ships escape scrutiny in bottom-up climate regime  http://www.rtcc.org/2014/12/22/planes-and-ships-escape-scrutiny-in-bottom-up-climate-regime/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227113148/http://www.rtcc.org/2014/12/22/planes-and-ships-escape-scrutiny-in-bottom-up-climate-regime/ |date=27 December 2014 }}].

====Approaches toward emissions trading====
As part of that process the ICAO has endorsed the adoption of an open [[emissions trading]] system to meet CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions reduction objectives. Guidelines for the adoption and implementation of a global scheme are currently being developed, and were to be presented to the ICAO Assembly in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icao.int/cgi/goto_m.pl?icao/en/nr/2005 ICAO news release 30 November 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929083654/http://www.icao.int/cgi/goto_m.pl?icao%2Fen%2Fnr%2F2005 |date=29 September 2007 }} "ICAO is also considering market-based options to address engine emissions through the participation of aviation in emissions trading schemes and the use of emissions levies related to local air quality. Guidelines for Contracting States wishing to implement such measures are being formulated and should be completed in time for the next regular Session of the ICAO Assembly in the Fall of 2007, when direction for future action will be set."&lt;/ref&gt; although the prospects of a comprehensive inter-governmental agreement on the adoption of such a scheme are uncertain.

Within the [[European Union]], however, the [[European Commission]] has resolved to incorporate aviation in the [[European Union Emissions Trading Scheme]] (ETS).&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, ''Reducing the Climate Change Impact of Aviation'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; A new directive was adopted by the European Parliament in July 2008 and approved by the Council in October 2008. It became effective on 1 January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32008L0101:EN:NOT Directive 2008/101/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council] of 19 November 2008 amending Directive 2003/87/EC so as to include aviation activities in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community (Text with EEA relevance)&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] investigated the possible effects on [[Small Island Developing States]] (SIDS) of the [[European Union]]'s decision to limit the supply of [[Certified Emission Reduction]]s (CERs) to its [[European Union Emissions Trading Scheme|ETS]]  market to [[Least Developed Countries]] (LDCs) from 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Keane, J. (2012) Briefing paper: [http://www.odi.org.uk/publications/6749-aviation-industry-eu-development-friendly-emissions-trading-scheme The aviation industry, the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme and Small and Vulnerable Economies: development-friendly frameworks]. [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; Most SIDS are highly [[vulnerability|vulnerable]] to the effects of [[climate change]] and rely heavily on [[tourism]] as a basis for their economies, so this decision could place them at some disadvantage. The researchers therefore highlight the need to ensure that any regulatory frameworks put in place to tackle climate change take into account the development needs of the most vulnerable countries affected.

A report published by researchers at the [[Centre for Aviation, Transport and Environment]] at [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] found that the only way to have a significant impact on emissions was to put a price on carbon and to use a market-based measure (MBM), such as the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS).&lt;ref&gt;Lee, D. et al 2013 Briefing paper: [http://www.cate.mmu.ac.uk/projects/bridging-the-aviation-co2-emissions-gap-why-emissions-trading-is-needed/ Bridging the aviation CO2 emissions gap: why emissions trading is needed]. [[Centre for Aviation, Transport and the Environment]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====International Civil Aviation Organization agreement 2016====
In October 2016 the [[United Nations|UN]] agency [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) finalized an agreement among its 191 member nations to address the more than {{val|458|ul=Mt}} (2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2015/569964/IPOL_STU(2015)569964_EN.pdf|title = Emission Reduction Targets for International Aviation and Shipping|accessdate = 2016-11-10|last1 = Cames|first1 = Martin|last2 = Graichen|first2 = Jakob|last3 = Siemons|first3 = Anne|last4 = Cook|first4 = Vanessa|date=November 2015 |pages = 48|publisher = European Parliament, Directorate-General for internal policies}}&lt;/ref&gt; of carbon dioxide emitted annually by international passenger and cargo flights. The agreement will use an offsetting scheme called CORSIA (the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) under which forestry and other carbon-reducing activities are directly funded, amounting to about 2 percent of annual revenues for the sector. Rules against 'double counting' should ensure that existing forest protection efforts are not recycled. The scheme does not take effect until 2021 and will be voluntary until 2027, but many countries, including the US and China, have promised to begin at its 2020 inception date.   Under the agreement, the global aviation emissions target is a 50 percent reduction by 2050 relative to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieta.org/resources/Resources/GHG_Report/2017/Preparing%20for%20CORSIA%20Take-off%20-%20Gill.pdf|title=Preparing for CORSIA Take-Off|last1=Gill|first1=Michael|website=IETA.org|accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] reaction to the deal was mixed.&lt;ref name="milman-2016"&gt;{{cite news|first=Oliver|last=Milman|title=First deal to curb aviation emissions agreed in landmark UN accord|date=6 October 2016|work=The Guardian|location=London|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/06/aviation-emissions-agreement-united-nations|access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement has critics. It is not aligned with the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which set the objective of restricting global warming to 1.5 to 2&amp;nbsp;°C. A late draft of the agreement would have required the air transport industry to assess its share of global carbon budgeting to meet that objective, but the text was removed in the agreed version.&lt;ref name="ccn"&gt;[http://www.climatechangenews.com/2016/10/06/un-aviation-pact-will-not-be-aligned-with-paris-climate-goals/ UN aviation pact will not be aligned with Paris climate goals], M.

Hodgkinson &amp;amp; R. Johnston. ''The Conversation'', 10 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; CORSIA will regulate only about 25 percent of aviation's international emissions, since it grandfather's all emissions below the 2020 level, allowing unregulated growth until then.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2016/airplane-emissions-10-06-2016.html Weak Market-based Measure Allows Airplanes' Greenhouse Pollution to Triple], (Press release) Center for Biological Diversity and Friends of the Earth. 6 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Only 65 nations will participate in the initial voluntary period, not including significant emitters Russia, India and perhaps Brazil. The agreement does not cover domestic emissions, which are 40 percent of the global industry's overall emissions.&lt;ref name="conversation"/&gt; One observer of the ICAO convention made this summary, "Airline claims that flying will now be green are a myth. Taking a plane is the fastest and cheapest way to fry the planet and this deal won't reduce demand for jet fuel one drop. Instead offsetting aims to cut emissions in other industries,..." Another critic called it "a timid step in the right direction."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/news/2016/10/06/green-groups-warn-deal-lower-aviation-pollution-weak-shell-game Green Groups Warn Deal to Lower Aviation Pollution is 'Weak Shell Game'], N. Prupis, ''Common Dreams'', 6 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of climate change on aviation===

====Increased turbulence====

A report published in the science journal ''Nature Climate Change'' forecasts that increasing {{CO2}} levels will result in a significant increase in in-flight turbulence experienced by transatlantic airline flights by the middle of the 21st century. The lead author of the study, Paul Williams, a researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Science, at the University of Reading stated, "air turbulence does more than just interrupt the service of in-flight drinks. It injures hundreds of passengers and aircrew every year – sometimes fatally. It also causes delays and damage to planes."&lt;ref name="RT09Apr13"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://rt.com/news/climate-change-air-travel-science-transatlantic-541/|title = Fasten your seatbelts: Climate change to increase flight turbulence|accessdate = 29 December 2014|date = 9 April 2013| work = RT News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noise==
{{main|Aircraft noise}}
Aircraft noise is seen by advocacy groups as being very hard to get attention and action on. The fundamental issues are increased traffic at larger airports and airport expansion at smaller and regional airports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nonoise.org/resource/trans/air/airport.htm|title = Aviation Noise|accessdate = 2007-12-29|last = Noise Pollution Clearinghouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Aviation authorities and airlines have developed Continuous Descent Approach procedures &lt;ref&gt;https://www.eurocontrol.int/sites/default/files/publication/files/2011-cd-brochure-web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to reduce noise footprint. Current applicable noise standards effective since 2014 are FAA Stage 4 and (equivalent) EASA Chapter 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/noise_emissions/airport_aircraft_noise_issues/levels/ | title=Details on FAA Noise Levels, Stages, and Phaseouts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aircraft with lower standards are restricted to a time window or, on many airports, banned completely. Stage 5 will become effective between 2017-2020. 
Quantification and comparison of noise effects per seat-distance takes into account that noise from cruise levels usually does not reach the earth surface (as opposed to surface-transportation) but is concentrated on and in proximity of airports.

==Water pollution==
[[File:A U.S. Army C-37B aircraft transporting Army Chief of Staff Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, gets de-iced before it departs Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska.jpg|thumb|Aircraft deicing. Excess deicing fluid may contaminate nearby water bodies, if not properly recovered.]]
Airports can generate significant [[water pollution]] due to their extensive use and handling of jet fuel, lubricants and other chemicals. Airports install spill control structures and related equipment (e.g., vacuum trucks, portable berms, absorbents) to prevent chemical spills, and mitigate the impacts of spills that do occur.&lt;ref name="EPA-stormwater-fact"&gt;{{cite report |date=December 2006 |title=Sector S: Vehicle Maintenance Areas, Equipment Cleaning Areas, or Deicing Areas Located at Air Transportation Facilities |series=Industrial Stormwater Fact Sheet Series |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/industrial-stormwater-fact-sheet-series |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=EPA-833-F-06-034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cold climates, the use of [[de-ice|deicing fluids]] can also cause water pollution, as most of the fluids applied to aircraft subsequently fall to the ground and can be carried via [[surface runoff|stormwater runoff]] to nearby streams, rivers or coastal waters.&lt;ref name="EPA airport-TDD"&gt;{{Cite report |date=April 2012 |title=Technical Development Document for the Final Effluent Limitations Guidelines and New Source Performance Standards for the Airport Deicing Category |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/airport-deicing-effluent-guidelines-documents |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-821-R-12-005}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|101}} Airlines use deicing fluids based on [[ethylene glycol]] or [[propylene glycol]] as the active ingredient.&lt;ref name="EPA airport-TDD"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

Ethylene glycol and propylene glycol are known to exert high levels of [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD) during degradation in surface waters. This process can adversely affect aquatic life by consuming oxygen needed by aquatic organisms for survival. Large quantities of [[dissolved oxygen]] (DO) in the [[water column]] are consumed when microbial populations decompose propylene glycol.&lt;ref name="EPA airport-environmental"&gt;{{Cite report |date=April 2012 |title=Environmental Impact and Benefit Assessment for the Final Effluent Limitation Guidelines and Standards for the Airport Deicing Category |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/airport-deicing-effluent-guidelines-documents |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-821-R-12-003}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2–23}}

Sufficient dissolved oxygen levels in surface waters are critical for the survival of fish, [[macroinvertebrate]]s, and other aquatic organisms. If oxygen concentrations drop below a minimum level, organisms emigrate, if able and possible, to areas with higher oxygen levels or eventually die. This effect can drastically reduce the amount of usable aquatic habitat. Reductions in DO levels can reduce or eliminate [[bottom feeder]] populations, create conditions that favor a change in a community’s species profile, or alter critical [[food-web]] interactions.&lt;ref name="EPA airport-environmental"/&gt;{{rp|2–30}}

==Air quality==
{{see also|Air pollution}}

=== Particulate emissions ===
[[Ultrafine particles]] (UFPs) are emitted by aircraft engines during near-surface level operations including [[taxiing|taxi]], [[takeoff]], [[climb (aeronautics)|climb]], [[descent (aircraft)|descent]], and [[landing]], as well as idling at gates and on taxiways. Other sources of UFPs include ground support equipment operating around the terminal areas. In 2014, an [[Air pollution|air quality]] study found the area impacted by ultrafine particles from the takeoffs and landings downwind of [[Los Angeles International Airport]] to be of much greater magnitude than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;Weikel, Dan and Barboza, Tony (May 29, 2014) [http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-0529-lax-pollution-20140529-story.html "Planes' exhaust could be harming communities up to 10 miles from LAX"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Typical UFP emissions during takeoff are on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; particles emitted per kilogram of fuel burned.

=== Lead emissions  ===
{{see also|Avgas#Environmental regulation}}

Some 167,000 piston engine aircraft—about three-quarters of private planes in the United States—release lead (Pb) into the air due to leaded aviation fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2012/12/private-planes-still-use-leaded-gasoline|title=Leaded Fuel Is a Thing of the Past—Unless You Fly a Private Plane|work=Mother Jones|access-date=2017-05-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1970 to 2007, general aviation aircraft emitted about 34,000 tons of lead into the atmosphere according to the Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lewisu.edu/news/Newsarticle.htm?PArticleID=8686#.WSGY6YzyvIV|title=Lead-free airplane fuel testing is in progress at Lewis|website=www.lewisu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lead is recognized as a serious environmental threat by the Federal Aviation Administration if inhaled or ingested leading to adverse  effects on the nervous system, red blood cells and cardiovascular and immune systems with infants and young children especially sensitive to even low levels of lead, which may contribute to behavioral and learning problems, lower IQ&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/news/fact_sheets/news_story.cfm?newsId=14754|title=Fact Sheet – Leaded Aviation Fuel and the Environment|website=www.faa.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.metro.us/news/study-lead-exposure-can-cause-autism/tmWmbz---f8BPut5Sd7fF2|title=Study: Lead exposure can cause autism|date=2013-02-26|work=Metro US|access-date=2017-05-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radiation exposure==
Flying {{convert|12|km|ft|}} high, passengers and crews of [[jet airliner]]s are exposed to at least 10 times the [[cosmic ray]] dose that people at [[sea level]] receive. Every few years, a [[geomagnetic storm]] permits a [[solar particle event]] to penetrate down to jetliner altitudes. Aircraft flying [[polar route]]s near the [[geomagnetic pole]]s are at particular risk.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cordis.europa.eu/docs/publications/7533/75331981-6_en.pdf Evaluation of the Cosmic Ray Exposure of Aircraft Crew]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Phillips| first =Tony| title =The Effects of Space Weather on Aviation| work =Science News| publisher =NASA| date =25 October 2013| url =https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2013/25oct_aviationswx/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube| bAKdaYumlq4 | "Converting Cosmic Rays to Sound During a Transatlantic Flight to Zurich" }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sol.spacenvironment.net/raps_ops/current_files/globeView.html NAIRAS (Nowcast of Atmospheric Ionizing Radiation System)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Land use for infrastructure==
Airport buildings, taxiways and runways take possession of a part of our ecosystem. Most of aircraft movement however is positioned in air at altitude and so away from direct interaction with sensitive nature or human detection. This is opposed to roads, railways and canals being very significant in use of area and dividing of ecological structures while required for surface transportation for as many miles as the distance traveled.

'''Ffyona Campbell''' (born 1967 in [[Totnes]], [[Devon]]) is an English long distance walker who walked around the world. She covered {{convert|32000|km|mi}} over 11 years and raised £180,000 for charity. She wrote about her experience in a series of three books.

==Early life==
Born in 1967, into a family with a long [[Royal Navy|Royal Naval]] tradition. During her childhood and early teens the Campbells moved home 24 times – which resulted in Ffyona attending 15 schools.&lt;ref name="FoC"&gt;Ffyona Campbell, ''Feet of Clay: On Foot through Australia'' (Firebird Distributing), 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Walks==
After leaving home and school at 16, she raised the necessary sponsorship to enable her to walk from [[John o' Groats]] to [[Lands End]]. Walking 20 to 25 miles a day six days a week, she completed the journey in 49 days and was the youngest person at that time to have done it.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} Through sponsorship of the London ''[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]]'', she raised £25,000 for the [[Royal Marsden Hospital|Royal Marsden Cancer Hospital]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

At 18, she set off from [[New York City]] crossing the [[United States]] towards [[Los Angeles]]. The media schedule to coincide with the sponsors' public relations events en route was demanding, requiring hours of interviews at the end of each long day. During this part of the walk she became pregnant and had an abortion, and secretly covered 1000 miles of the journey in her back-up van.[https://www.thefreelibrary.com/MY+FFYONA+IS+A+CHEAT+.+.+BUT+I+AM+STILL+SO+PROUD+OF+HER%3b+Mum+backs...-a061281005]

At 21 she walked across Australia, 50 miles a day for 3,200 miles from [[Sydney]] to [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] in 95 days,{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} beating the men's record for this journey.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} She suffered severe [[sunburn]], [[dehydration]] as well as intense blistering of the feet but was determined not to miss out any miles. She wrote about this journey in her book ''Feet of Clay''.

On 2 April 1991, she left [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]] and walked the length of Africa covering over {{convert|16,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} before arriving in [[Tangiers]], [[Morocco]] two years later on 1 September 1993.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} She had been joined by her former boyfriend, British survival expert [[Ray Mears (author)|Ray Mears]], for five months during the journey through Zaire after an uprising had forced her and her team to abandon the support vehicle and be evacuated by the [[French Foreign Legion]] along with all the other expats. She was able to return to central Africa within weeks of the evacuation and continued walking from the place she had left. During the stretch across the Sahara, she walked an extra 4,000&amp;nbsp;km around a war zone to avoid missing out any steps. She reached Tangiers and was greeted by the international media.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} The walk raised awareness of [[Survival International]], an organisation which helps protect the lives of threatened tribal people. She wrote about this journey in her book ''On Foot through Africa''.

In April 1994, she left [[Algeciras]], [[Spain]] and walked through Europe on the Via de la Plata through Spain, through France, crossing to Britain at [[Dover]]. She then completed the last {{convert|1,300|km|mi|abbr=on}} walking from Dover back to John o' Groats accompanied by young people from [[Raleigh International]] who came to find out just how far they could walk if they really put their minds to it. She arrived at John O'Groat's, the world's end, on 14 October 1994. She was shadowed by a [[BBC]] film crew and presenter [[Janet Street-Porter]]. At the time, Campbell was hailed as the first woman to walk around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-10-15/news/mn-50392_1_ffyona-campbell|title=Briton Is First Woman to Walk Around World|publisher=LA Times (Reuters)|date=15 October 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell raised half the amount for charity in one go when one of the organisers at Raleigh International sold the advertising space on her forehead during her well-publicised return. After a period in hospital for a back operation, she walked across America again for her own personal satisfaction as she had had to miss out a section in the middle due to her pregnancy. She wrote about that journey in her final book, ''The Whole Story''. The media castigated her for her initial deception.

==Hunter-gatherer==
Inspired by the hunter-gatherers she met on her journey – Aborigines, Bushmen, Pygmies and Native Americans – Campbell returned to Australia after the end of the world walk to live with the Aborigines. After three months she returned to Britain to learn how to be a hunter-gatherer in her own country and to work out what had separated us from the life we must have loved so much.{{according to whom|date=February 2014}} She wrote about her adventures in her fourth book, ''The Hunter-Gatherer Way'' and is now teaching others how to be hunter-gatherers in Britain through her company Wild Food Walks based in Devon.

In 1937, she married Allan D. Cruickshank, a lecturer, writer, and photographer for the [[Audubon Society]]. Husband and wife formed a highly effective partnership for photography and bird study. He took the black and white photos and she took the color slides on their bird study expeditions. The [[Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University]] (formerly named the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Science) has a bird image collection named [[Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University#VIREO|VIREO]] (Visual REsource For Ornithology) with over 180,000 thousand photographs, thousands of which were taken by the Cruickshanks.&lt;ref name=OrlandoSentinel/&gt;

Helen Cruickshank won the 1949 [[John Burroughs Medal]] for her 1948 book ''Flight into Sunshine: Bird Experiences in Florida''. [[Brevard County, Florida]] established the Helen and Allan Cruickshank Sanctuary, a 140-acre wildlife refuge near [[Rockledge, Florida]]. The [[Florida Ornithological Society]] sponsors the Helen G. and Allan D. Cruickshank Education Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Helen G. and Allan D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10718">The '''International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes''' (also known as the WHO Code) is an international [[health policy]] framework for [[breastfeeding promotion]] adopted by the [[World Health Assembly]] (WHA) of the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/code_english.pdf ''International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes''.] Geneva, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; The Code was developed as a global [[public health]] strategy and recommends restrictions on the [[marketing]] of [[breast milk]] substitutes, such as [[infant formula]], to ensure that mothers are not discouraged from [[breastfeeding]] and that substitutes are used safely if needed. The Code also covers ethical considerations and regulations for the marketing of feeding bottles and teats. A number of subsequent WHA resolutions have further clarified or extended certain provisions of the Code.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/infantfeeding/Frequently_ask_question_Internationalcode.pdf ''International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes: Frequently Asked Questions.''] Geneva, 2008. Accessed 5 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FTSE. [http://www.ftse.com/Indices/FTSE4Good_Index_Series/Downloads/FTSE4Good_Breast_Milk_Substitute_Criteria.pdf "FTSE4Good Inclusion Criteria for the Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728140611/http://www.ftse.com/Indices/FTSE4Good_Index_Series/Downloads/FTSE4Good_Breast_Milk_Substitute_Criteria.pdf |date=2011-07-28 }} ''FTSE4Good Index Series'', accessed 5 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1981, 84 countries have enacted legislation implementing all or many of the provisions of the Code and subsequent relevant WHA resolutions.&lt;ref name="UNICEF"&gt;UNICEF. [http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/index_24805.html International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes.] Accessed 6 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==
The Code aims to shield breastfeeding from commercial promotion that affects [[mother]]s, [[Health Human Resources|health workers]] and [[health care system]]s. The Code and resolutions also contain specific provisions and recommendations relating to labelling of infant formula and other breastmilk substitutes.

;i. Mothers

* Information and educational materials on [[infant feeding|infant and young child feeding]] should be objective and consistent and emphasize the importance of breastfeeding. In no case should such materials refer to a brand name of a product.
* All forms of product advertising and promotion are prohibited.
* Mothers should not be given free product samples.
* Promotional devices such as discounts and special displays at the retail level are prohibited.
* Company representatives may not initiate direct or indirect contact with mothers.
* Health risks to infants who are artificially fed or who are not exclusively breastfed should be highlighted through appropriate labeling and warnings.

;ii. Health workers

* The Code gives [[health care provider|health workers]] the responsibility to encourage and protect breastfeeding.
* Materials regarding products given to health professionals by manufacturers and distributors should be limited to ‘scientific and factual’ matters. They should not be tools to promote the use of products.
* Product samples may be given only when necessary for professional evaluation or [[research]] at the institutional level. In no case should these samples be passed on to mothers.
* In order to prevent [[conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]], manufacturers and distributors should not give material or financial inducements to health workers. Three WHA resolutions on infant and young child nutrition subsequent to the adoption of the Code specifically cautioned against conflicts of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Baby Milk Action. [http://www.babymilkaction.org/update/update41b.html "World Health Assembly: New UN Resolution tackles intrinsic contamination."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927110116/http://www.babymilkaction.org/update/update41b.html |date=2011-09-27 }} ''Baby Milk Action Update'', Issue 41, November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1996 resolution (WHA resolution 49.15) called for caution in accepting financial support for health professionals working in infant and young child health which may create conflicts of interest. The need to avoid conflicts of interest was expanded in 2005 (WHA resolution 58.32) to cover programmes in infant and young child health and reiterated in 2008 (WHA resolution 61.20).

;iii. Health care systems

* Promotion of any product is forbidden in a [[health care provider|health care facility]]. This includes the display of products, placards and posters concerning such products and distribution of materials provided by manufacturers and distributors.
* Formula feeding should be demonstrated only to those mothers or family members who need to use it and the information given should include a clear explanation of the risks of formula feeding and hazards of improper use of products.
* Donated equipment and materials should not refer to brand names of products.
* Free Supplies:  Two subsequent resolutions (WHA 39.28 [1986] and WHA 47.5 [1994]) effectively call for an end to all free or low-cost supplies to any part of the health care system.&lt;ref&gt;The Boycott Book. [http://www.theboycottbook.com/reinstating.pdf ''Reinstating the Nestlé Boycott (1988)''.]  Accessed 5 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturers and distributors are therefore prohibited from providing products to health care facilities for free or at low cost. (According to guidelines under the [[Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative]], ‘low cost’ means less than 80% of the retail price.)

;iv. Labelling

* Information on [[labelling|labels]] for infant formula must be in simple and easy to understand terms in an appropriate language. 
* Labels of infant formula must contain a statement on the superiority of breastfeeding and that the product should only be used after consultation with health professionals.
* Pictures or text which may idealize the use of infant formula and certain wordings, such as 'humanized” or “materialized” or similar terms should not be used.
* Nutrition and health claims on labels for breastmilk substitutes should not be permitted unless allowed by [[health policy|national legislation]]  (WHA resolution 58.32 [2005]).&lt;ref name="IBFAN"&gt;IBFAN. [http://www.ibfan.org/issue-international_code-code.html Understanding the International Code.] Accessed 5 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Labels must contain explicit warnings on labels to inform consumers about the risks of contamination of powdered formula with pathogenic [[microorganism]]s (WHA resolution 58.32 [2005]).&lt;ref name="IBFAN"/&gt; 
* Labels must conform with WHO/[[FAO]] guidelines on safe preparation, storage and handling of powdered infant formula (WHA resolution 61.20 [2008]).&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. [http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/micro/pif2007/en/ ''Guidelines for the safe preparation, storage and handling of powdered infant formula''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310072035/http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/micro/pif2007/en/ |date=2010-03-10 }} Geneva, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with the recommendation for exclusive breastfeeding in WHA resolution 54.2 [2001],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibfan.org/issue-international_code-full-542.html WHA Resolution 54.2 - 2001: Infant and young child nutrition.]&lt;/ref&gt; all complementary foods must be labeled as suitable for use by infants from six months and not earlier.

==Implementation==

The [[baby food]] industry has been the subject of pointed criticism from [[non-governmental organization]]s, international agencies and campaign groups for failing to abide by the Code.  One of the largest food and beverage manufacturers in the world, the Swiss giant [[Nestlé]], has been the subject of an international boycott campaign since 1977 for its milk-substitute marketing practices prior to and since the development of the Code (see [[Nestlé boycott]]).

On its own, the International Code is not legally enforceable.

In [[economics]], '''land''' comprises all [[natural resource|naturally occurring resources]] as well as geographic [[land]]. Examples include particular [[geographical location]]s, [[mineral deposit]]s, forests, fish stocks, atmospheric quality, [[geostationary orbit]]s, and portions of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. Supply of these resources is fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/land-economics|title=Land - economics|author=|date=|website=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Natural resources are fundamental to the [[Production theory basics|production]] of all [[good (economics)|goods]], including [[capital goods]]. Location values are not be confused with values imparted by fixed capital improvements. In [[classical economics]], land is considered one of the three [[factors of production]] (also sometimes called the three producer goods) along with [[capital (economics)|capital]], and [[labor (economics)|labor]]. Land is sometimes merged with capital to simplify micro-economics. However, a common mistake is combining land and capital in macro-analysis.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Land was sometimes defined in classical and [[neoclassical economics]] as the "original and indestructible powers of the soil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2097629|title=Economic Aspects of Urban Land Use Patterns|first=Ernest M.|last=Fisher|date=17 May 2018|publisher=|journal=The Journal of Industrial Economics|volume=6|issue=3|pages=198–208|doi=10.2307/2097629}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Vague|date=January 2018}}

==Ownership and rent==
Income derived from ownership or control of [[natural resources]] is referred to as [[economic rent|rent]].

===Georgism===
[[Georgism|Georgists]] hold that this implies a perfectly [[elasticity (economics)|inelastic]] [[supply curve]] (i.e., zero elasticity), suggesting that a [[land value tax]] that recovers the [[Economic rent#Land rent|rent of land]] for public purposes would not affect the [[opportunity cost]] of using land, but would instead only decrease the value of owning it.  This view is supported by evidence that although land can come on and off the market, market inventories of land show if anything an inverse relationship to price (i.e., negative elasticity).

===Accounting===
As a tangible [[asset]] land is represented in accounting as a [[fixed asset]] or a [[capital asset]].

===Conflict===
Land, particularly geographic locations and mineral deposits, has historically been the cause of much conflict and dispute; [[land reform]] programs, which are designed to redistribute possession and/or use of geographic land, are often the cause of much controversy, and conflicts over the economic rent of mineral deposits have contributed to many civil wars.

==Academic==
Some United Kingdom and common wealth universities offer a courses in ''land economy'', where economics is studied alongside law, business regulation, surveying and the built and natural environments.&lt;ref name="cam.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.landecon.cam.ac.uk/courses/undergradstudy/prospectus.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912080021/http://www.landecon.cam.ac.uk/courses/undergradstudy/prospectus.htm |archivedate=2009-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abdn.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-taught/degree-programmes/286/rural-surveying-and-rural-property-management/|title=Land Economy - Rural Surveying - Postgraduate Taught Degrees - Study Here - The University of Aberdeen|author=|date=|website=www.abdn.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecommonwealth.org/organisation/commonwealth-association-surveying-and-land-economy-casle|title=Commonwealth Association of Surveying and Land Economy (CASLE) - The Commonwealth|first=Site designed and built by Hydrant|last=(http://www.hydrant.co.uk)|date=|website=thecommonwealth.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This mode of study at Cambridge dates back to 1917 when [[William Cecil Dampier]] suggested the creation of a school of rural economy at the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.landecon.cam.ac.uk/about-us/a-brief-history-of-land-economy|title=A brief history of Land Economy — Department of Land Economy|first=|last=pjm93@cam.ac.uk|date=|website=www.landecon.cam.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lasse Nordlund by Marko Ulvila 2016-06-19.jpg|thumb|Lasse Nordlund summer 2016]]

'''Lasse Nordlund''' (1965) is a Finnish social thinker who is known for his experiment of living completely self-sufficiently in the Finnish countryside, producing his clothes and tools and cultivating his food from his small farm and what he gathered from the surrounding country.

==History==
Born in [[Helsinki]] to a Finnish father and a German mother,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://suomenkuvalehti.fi/jutut/kotimaa/lantun-varassa/ |title=Hän elää luontaistaloudessa – ei omaisuutta, syö toista kiloa lanttua päivässä |website=[[Suomen Kuvalehti|Suomenkuvalehti.fi]] |access-date=November 26, 2017 |url-access=subscription |language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nordlund spent a typical youth in Germany and was interested in studying physics. However, he began to doubt the viability and meaning of conventional living and decided to try and live a self-sufficient lifestyle.

The background to Nordlund's experiment is his conviction that only [[Subsistence economy|subsistence living]] is materially sustainable on a long-term basis.

==The Experiment==

Nordlund could not, by his own admission, distinguish between a [[pine]] or a [[fir]] tree when he started his project, but started by studying books and experimenting to produce goods and obtain food. Eventually, he was able to live in [[Valtimo]], in [[North Karelia|Finnish North Karelia]], for the years between 1992 and 2004 in complete self-sufficiency.

According to Nordlund, one person needs about five [[Are (unit)|ares]] (500m²) of farmland to live on without buying any additional food. The most important food crop for him is the [[rutabaga]], a common Finnish staple. In his self-sufficient economy, Nordlund consumes 200&amp;nbsp;kg of mushrooms per year and about the same in berries preserved without additives or sugar. He forsook livestock because he projected the maintenance for example, animal feed) to be too time-consuming to make sense. Though he does accept the value of animal husbandry as wool and leather are handy clothing materials able to outlast cotton cloth. Nordlund became accustommed to life without salt, though many believe it to be life-threatening. He argues that he has been able to live without salt for years, although initially leaving out salt caused him some health issues. Instead of toilet paper, he uses dried [[sphagnum|sphagnum moss]]. In the early years of self-reliance, Nordlund's days were full of work, but eventually he was able to relax and take up hobbies from his youth, such as [[flute]] playing and working on equations.

==Recent==
He is an author and a speaker on sustainability topics.

Today, he lives with his family, still mostly self-sufficiently.

In 2008, Palladium books published a work written by Lasse Nordlund and Maria Dorff "The Foundations of Our Life, Reflections about Human labour, Money and Energy from Self-sufficiency Standpoint".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7228">West Virginia contains a network of eight [[state forests]] that help to protect over {{convert|70000|acres}} of wooded lands in the state.  Most of the forests are managed by the [[West Virginia Division of Forestry]], although [[Kanawha State Forest]] is managed as a [[state park]] by the [[West Virginia Division of Natural Resources|Division of Natural Resources]].  All of the forests except for [[Calvin Price State Forest|Calvin Price]] contain recreational facilities managed in cooperation with the [[West Virginia Division of Natural Resources|DNR]].

This is a list of the most important [[fjord]]s of the [[Russian Federation]].
==Fjords==
In spite of the vastness of the Arctic coastlines of the federation there are relatively few fjords in Russia. Fjords are circumscribed to certain areas only; over thirty are in [[Novaya Zemlya]] —including lakes which are structurally fjords, with a few others in the [[Barents Sea]] coast of the [[Kola Peninsula]], the [[Severnaya Zemlya]]  archipelago, the [[Bering Sea]] coast of the [[Chukchi Peninsula]]&lt;ref&gt;P. Brovko et al. in ''The Diversity of Russian Estuaries and Lagoons Exposed to Human Influence'' edited by Ruben Kosyan, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; and the southeastern shores of [[Kamchatka]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaplin, P.A., ''Fjord coasts of the Soviet Union.''

[[File:Denali Mt McKinley.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Elevation|highest]] [[Summit|mountain peak]] of [[North America]].  Denali is the third most [[Topographic prominence|topographically prominent]] and third most [[Topographic isolation|topographically isolated]] [[summit]] on Earth after [[Mount Everest]] and [[Aconcagua]].]]

This article comprises three sortable tables of [[Summit|major mountain peaks]]&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]], and a major summit as a susexxleast {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  All summits in this article have at least 500&amp;nbsp;meters of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Alaska|State of Alaska]].

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[#Highest major summits|first table]] below ranks the 100 highest major summits of Alaska by elevation.
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite far away.  The key col for [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in [[Nicaragua]], {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range/&gt;  The [[#Most prominent summits|second table]] below ranks the 100 most prominent summits of Alaska.
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[#Most isolated major summits|third table]] below ranks the 50 most isolated major summits of Alaska.

__TOC__{{clear}}

==Highest major summits==
{{GeoGroup|section=Highest major summits}}
{{see also|List of the major 4000-meter summits of Alaska}}
Of the 100 highest major summits of Alaska, only Denali exceeds {{convert|6000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} elevation, four peaks exceed {{convert|5000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, [[List of the major 4000-meter summits of Alaska|23 peaks exceed {{convert|4000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}]], 61 peaks exceed {{convert|3000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, 92 peaks exceed {{convert|2000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, and all 100 peaks exceed {{convert|1740|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} elevation.  Five of these peaks lie on the international border with [[Yukon]] and five lie on the international border with [[British Columbia]].  All ten of the highest major summits of the United States are in Alaska.

[[File:Denali Mt McKinley.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Elevation|highest]] [[Summit|mountain peak]] of the [[United States]] and [[North America]].  Denali is the third most [[Topographic prominence|topographically prominent]] and third most [[Topographic isolation|topographically isolated]] [[summit]] on Earth after [[Mount Everest]] and [[Aconcagua]].]]

This article comprises three sortable tables of [[Summit|major mountain peaks]]&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]], and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  All summits in this article have at least 500&amp;nbsp;meters of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[United States|United States of America]].

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=NAVD_88&gt;All elevations in the 48 [[U.S. state|states]] of the [[contiguous United States]] include an elevation adjustment from the [[National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929]] ([[NGVD 29]]) to the [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988]] ([[NAVD 88]]).  For further information, please see this [[United States National Geodetic Survey]] [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatVD29VD88 note].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[#Highest major summits|first table]] below ranks the 100 highest major summits of the United States by elevation.
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite far away.  The key col for [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in [[Nicaragua]], {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range/&gt;  The [[#Most prominent summits|second table]] below ranks the 50 most prominent summits of the United States.
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[#Most isolated major summits|third table]] below ranks the 50 most isolated major summits of the United States.

{{main|List of the highest major summits of the United States}}
{{see also|List of the major 4000-meter summits of the United States|List of the major 3000-meter summits of the United States|List of United States fourteeners}}
Of the 100 highest major summits of the United States, only Denali exceeds {{convert|6000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} elevation, four peaks exceed {{convert|5000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, and all 100 peaks exceed {{convert|4012|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} elevation. 

Of these 100 summits, 53 are located in Colorado, 23 in Alaska, 14 in California, five in Wyoming, two in Hawai{{okina}}i, and one each in Washington, Utah, and New Mexico.  Five of these summits are located on the international border between Alaska and Yukon, and one is located on the international border between Alaska and British Columbia.  The ten highest major summits of the United States are all located in Alaska.

==Rivers by orography==
{{see|Hydrology of Switzerland}}
[[Image:Suisse hydrologie 1.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|The five river basins of Switzerland. {{legend|#ff8635|[[Rhine]]}} {{legend|#ffa86d|[[Aare]] (part of the basin of the Rhine)}} {{legend|#fff448|[[Rhone]]}} {{legend|#ccff75|[[Po (river)|Po]]}} {{legend|#de87cd|[[Danube]]}} {{legend|#43a900|[[Adige]]}}]]
[[Image:Aare river in Bern.jpg|thumb|The [[Aare]] at [[Bern]]]]

Switzerland is drained into four directions: 
*[[North Sea]], via the [[Rhine]].
*[[Mediterranean Sea]], via the [[Rhône]].
*[[Adriatic Sea]], via the [[Po (river)|Po]] and the [[Adige]].
*[[Black Sea]], via the [[Danube]].

Rivers that flow into other rivers are sorted by the proximity of their points of confluence to the sea (the lower in the list, the more upstream). Some rivers (e.g. Danube) do not flow through Switzerland themselves, but they are mentioned for having Swiss tributaries. They are given in ''italics''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42521">This is the list of notable [[star]]s in the [[constellation]] '''[[Puppis]]''', sorted by decreasing brightness.

This constellation's [[Bayer designation]]s (Greek-letter star names) were given while it was still considered part of the constellation of [[Argo Navis]]. After Argo Navis was broken up into [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]], [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]], and Puppis, these Greek-letter designations were kept, so that Puppis does not have a full complement of Greek-letter designations. For example, since Argo Navis's alpha star went to Carina, there is no Alpha Puppis.

[[Image:Giotto - Scrovegni - -24- - Marriage at Cana.jpg|thumb|right|280px|''Marriage at Cana'' by [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]], 14th century]]
The transformation of [[water]] into [[wine]] at the '''Marriage at Cana''' or '''Wedding at Cana''' is the first [[miracle of Jesus|miracle attributed to Jesus]] in the [[Gospel of John]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Van der Loos, 1965 ''The Miracles of Jesus'', E.J. Brill Press, 
s of Christ'' {{ISBN|0-88141-193-0}} page 71&lt;/ref&gt; In the Gospel account, [[Jesus]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|his mother]] and his [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] are invited to a wedding, and when the wine runs out, Jesus delivers a sign of his [[Glory (religion)|glory]] by turning water into wine.

The location of [[Cana]] has been subject to the debate of Christ among biblical scholars and archeologists; several villages in [[Galilee]] are possible candidates.

==Biblical account==
{{bibleverse||John|2:1-11}} states that while [[Jesus]] was at a wedding in [[Cana]] with his disciples, the party ran out of [[wine]]. [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Jesus' mother]] (unnamed in John's Gospel) told Jesus, "They have no wine," and Jesus replied, "Oh Woman, what has this to do with me? My hour has not yet come." His mother then said to the servants, "Do whatever he tells you" ({{bibleverse||John|2:3-5}}). Jesus ordered the servants to fill containers with water and to draw out some and take it to the chief steward [[Waiting staff|waiter]]. After tasting it, without knowing where it came from, the steward remarked to the [[groom|bridegroom]] that he had departed from the custom of serving the best wine first by serving it last ({{bibleverse||John|2:6-10}}). John adds that: "Jesus did this, the first of his signs, in Cana of [[Galilee]], and it revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him" ({{bibleverse||John|2:11}}).

==Interpretation==
Although none of the [[Synoptic Gospels]] mention the marriage at Cana, Christian tradition based on {{bibleverse||John|2:11|9}} holds that this is the first public miracle of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Towner, W. S. (1996), ''Wedding'', in P. J. Achtermeier (Ed.), ''Harper Collins Bible Dictionary'' (pp. 1205-1206), San Francisco: Harper&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to have symbolic importance as the first of the [[seven signs in the Gospel of John]] by which Jesus' divine status is attested, and around which the gospel is structured.
[[File:Marten de Vos Cana.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''The Marriage at Cana'' by [[Maerten de Vos]], c. 1596]]

Interpreted allegorically, the good news and hope implied by the story are in the words of the steward of the Feast when he tasted the good wine, "Everyone serves the good wine first, and then the inferior wine after the guests have become drunk. But you have kept the good wine until now" (John 2:10, NRSV). This could be interpreted by saying simply that it is always darkest before the dawn, but good things are on the way. The more usual interpretation, however, is that this is a reference to the appearance of Jesus, whom the author of the Fourth Gospel regards as being himself "the good wine".&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Smith, D. M. (1988), ''John'', in Mays, J. L. (Ed.), Harper's Bible Commentary (pp. 1044-1076), San Francisco: Harper.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story has had considerable importance in the development of Christian pastoral theology. [[Fulton J. Sheen]] thought that it is very likely that it was one of Mary's relatives who were being married.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholictradition.org/Mary/cana.htm Sheen, Fulton J., ''The World's first Love'' (1952)]&lt;/ref&gt; The gospel account of Jesus being invited to a marriage, attending, and using his divine power to save the celebrations from disaster are taken as evidence of his approval for marriage and earthly celebrations, in contrast to the more austere views of [[Paul the Apostle]] as found, for example, in [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians 7]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|7|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used as an argument against Christian [[teetotalism]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Geisler, N. L. (1982), A Christian Perspective on Wine-Drinking, ''Bibliotheca Sacra, 49''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bill Day, the miracle may also be interpreted as the [[Typology (theology)|antitype]] of [[Moses]]' first public miracle of [[10 plagues#1. Plague of blood (דָם): Ex. 7:14–25|changing water (the Nile river) into blood]]. This would establish a symbolic link between Moses as the first savior of the Jews through their escape from [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and Jesus as the spiritual savior of all people.&lt;ref&gt;Day, Bill, ''The Moses Connection in John's Gospel'', Mariner Publishing (1997) {{ISBN|0-9662080-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have speculated about the identity of the unnamed bridegroom. One tradition, represented by [[Thomas Aquinas]] among others, holds that the bridegroom was St John the Evangelist himself. [[John Spong|Bishop John Spong]] suggests in his book ''Born of a Woman'' that the event was actually the wedding of Jesus himself to [[Mary Magdalene]].&lt;ref&gt;John Shelby Spong, ''Born of a Woman'' (Harper, 1992) pages 187-199.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854, at a time when [[polygamy]] was an element of mainstream [[Mormons|Mormon]] practice, the Mormon elder [[Orson Hyde]] made a similar suggestion, arguing that Jesus was a [[polygamist]] and that the event at Cana was his wedding to [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Martha]] and [[Mary of Bethany]].&lt;ref&gt;Orson Hyde, Conference message, October 6, 1854, Journal of Discourses 2:82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Inside Today's Mormonism'' by Richard Abanes 2007 {{ISBN|0-7369-1968-6}} page 239&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Disparity in Doctrine and Theology'' by E Roberts 2011 {{ISBN|1-4497-1210-X}} page 54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and archaeology==
[[Image: Kafr Kanna BW 1.JPG|thumb|220px|The "Wedding church" in [[Kafr Kanna]], [[Israel]], a pilgrimage site believed by many Christians to be the site of the biblical marriage.]]
The exact location of Cana has been subject to debate among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;''Jesus and archaeology'' by James H. Charlesworth 2006 {{ISBN|0-8028-4880-X}} pages 540-541&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars maintain that since the [[Gospel of John]] was addressed to Jewish Christians of the time, it isn’t likely that the evangelist would mention a place that did not exist.

Locations which are candidates for historical Cana are:
* [[Kafr Kanna]], in [[Galilee]]
* [[Khirbet Qana]], also called Kenet-l-Jalil, also in Galilee
* [[Ain Qana]], [[Southern Lebanon]]
* [[Qana]], Southern Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible'' 2000 {{ISBN|90-5356-503-5}} page 212&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] of 1914, a tradition dating back to the 8th century identifies Cana with the modern Arab town of [[Kafr Kanna]], in [[Galilee]], about 7&amp;nbsp;km northeast of [[Nazareth]], [[Israel]].&lt;ref name=CathCana &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03226a.htm |title=Catholic encyclopedia: Cana |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1908-11-01 |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other suggested alternatives include the ruined village of [[Khirbet Qana]], also called Kenet-l-Jalil, about 9&amp;nbsp;km further north, and [[Ain Qana]], in [[Southern Lebanon]], which is closer to [[Nazareth]] and considered to be a better candidate on etymological grounds. Some Christians, especially Lebanese Christians, believe the southern Lebanese village of [[Qana]] to have been the actual location of this event.&lt;ref name="ap"&gt;"Lebanese Town Lays Claim To Jesus Christ's First Miracle", ''[[Associated Press]]'', January 12, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the journal ''Biblical Archaeological Review'', Michael Homan argues that many biblical scholars have misinterpreted early texts, translating to 'wine' when the more sensible translation is '[[beer]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Homan, Michael M. “Did the Ancient Israelites Drink Beer?.” Biblical Archaeology Review, Sep/Oct 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Henry Maxwell Knight''' [[OBE]], known as '''Maxwell Knight''', (b. [[South Norwood]], 9 July 1900 – 27 January 1968) was a British [[spymaster]], [[naturalist]] and [[Television presenter|broadcaster]], reputedly a model for the [[James Bond]] character [[M (James Bond)|"M"]].  He played major roles in surveillance of an early British Fascist party as well as the main Communist Party.

==Background==

Knight was the son of Hugh Coleraine Knight, a [[solicitor]], and his wife, Ada Phyllis ([[Given name|née]] Hancock). He was christened in Holy Innocents Church, South Norwood on 3 August 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Holy Innocents Church, ''Baptismal Register,'' [http://interactive.ancestry.com/4772/40815_1831109333_1761-00011/2944199?backurl=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ancestry.com%2fcgi-bin%2fsse.dll%3fdb%3dsurreybaptisms%26so%3d2%26pcat%3dROOT_CATEGORY%26gss%3dangs-g%26new%3d1%26rank%3d1%26gsfn%3dCHARLES%2bHENRY%2bMAXWELL%26gsfn_x%3d1%26gsln%3dKnight%26gsln_x%3d1%26MSAV%3d1%26cpxt%3d1%26cp%3d11%26catbucket%3drstp%26uidh%3dg92&amp;ssrc=&amp;backlabel=ReturnSearchResults Surrey, England, Church of England Baptisms, 1813-1912 for Charles Henry Maxwell Knight] Ancestry.com (pay to view site). Retrieved 30 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Military===

He saw service during the First World War. Having been a naval cadet, he was appointed to the temporary rank of [[Midshipman]] in the [[Royal Naval Reserve]] on 2 May 1918.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[The National Archives, Kew|The National Archives]], reference ADM 240/49/4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1918 he attended a [[hydrophone]] officers' course, and in August served for a short time as First Class Hydrophone Officer aboard the trawler, ''Ninus''.  On 1 September 1918 he was appointed to the armed merchant cruiser, HMS ''Andes''. In December 1918 Captain C.T.H. Cooper of the ''Andes'' described him as "a promising young officer." He was demobilised in February 1919.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Having left the navy, he worked as a teacher in a preparatory school and as a freelance journalist.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Andrew, ''The Defence of the Realm'' (2009), quoted in [http://spartacus-educational.com/SSknightM.htm Charles Maxwell Knight] Spartacus Educational. Retrieved 30 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===MI5===
In an unpublished memoir, Knight recalled that he joined the first of the Fascist Movements in Britain, [[Rotha Lintorn-Orman]]'s [[British Fascisti]], in 1924, "at the request of the late Sir [[George Makgill]] who was then running agents on behalf of [[Vernon Kell|Sir Vernon Kell]], Director General of the British Security Service, MI5. I remained with this organisation until 1930 when it more or less became ineffectual. My association with this body was at all times for the purposes of obtaining information for HM Government and also for the purposes of finding likely people who might be used by this department for the same purposes."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [http://spartacus-educational.com/SSknightM.htm Charles Maxwell Knight] Spartacus Educational. Retrieved 30 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as the organisation's director of intelligence.&lt;ref name=twigge&gt;S Twigge, E Hampshire, G Macklin ''British Intelligence'', The National Archives, Kew, 2008, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s, on Knight's instructions, six British Fascists, posing as Communists, joined the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] to work as penetrator agents for Makgill's section 2B.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Andrew, ''The Defence of the Realm'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In time Knight became MI5's chief 'agent runner', being deployed principally against the Communist Party.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="twigge" /&gt; He rose to be head of section B5(b), responsible for infiltrating agents into potentially subversive groups, based for much of its existence at 308, Hood House, [[Dolphin Square]] in London, separate from the rest of MI5.

Joan Miller, who was recruited as an agent by Knight and had a close personal relationship with him, remembered that he felt very deeply about the threat of Communism: "his views on this subject, you might say, amounted almost to an obsession. He was equally adamant in his aversion to Jews and homosexuals, but prepared to suspend these prejudices in certain cases. 'Bloody Jews' was one of his expressions (you have only to read the popular novels of the period - thrillers in particular - to understand just how widespread this particular prejudice was)."&lt;ref&gt;Joan Miller, ''One Girl's War'' (1970), quoted in [http://spartacus-educational.com/SSknightM.htm Charles Maxwell Knight] Spartacus Educational. Retrieved 30 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding this, Miller imagined Knight himself was a homosexual,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/may/21/artsandhumanities.highereducation | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Women make better spies - as long as they forget sex | first=Owen | last=Bowcott | date=21 May 2004 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although his third wife, Susi Maxwell Knight, rejected the allegation.&lt;ref name="Unreliable Witness"&gt;Patricia Craig, [http://spyinggame.me/2013/02/23/unreliable-witness/ Unreliable Witness], Intelligence Analysis and Reporting (23 February 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

A respected case officer, Knight achieved successes with the infiltration of political groups, leading to the internment and imprisonment of fascists and fascist sympathisers regarded as a threat to the United Kingdom, such as Albert Williams, Percy Glading{{Dubious |Percy Glading|date=January 2018}}, George Whomack, [[Anna Wolkoff]], [[Tyler Kent]], leading anti-semite, Captain [[Archibald Maule Ramsay]] MP and [[Oswald Mosley]].

During his career with MI5, Knight found that there was "a very long standing and ill-founded prejudice against the employment of women as agents", a position with which he did not agree. Indeed, many of his best agents were women. Agents working under him included [[Olga Gray]] (who infiltrated the leadership of the Communist Party of Great Britain), Joan Miller (who "penetrated the [[anti-semitic]] underworld of British Fascism"),&lt;ref name="twigge" /&gt; and [[Tom Driberg]].

His early warnings of communist infiltration of MI5 were not taken seriously. Patricia Craig notes that his paper, "The Comintern is not dead", which predicted with great accuracy the developments in Russia’s policy with regard to Britain after the war, "was dismissed as 'over-theoretical' by [[Roger Hollis]], and various other Soviet experts considered it unimpressive."&lt;ref name="Unreliable Witness"/&gt; Moreover, when, in 1941 [[Anthony Blunt]] informed [[Harry Pollitt]] that Tom Driberg was an informer, and Driberg was expelled from the Communist Party, Knight developed the suspicion that his unit had been infiltrated by the [[KGB]], but Blunt's treachery remained undiscovered for some years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spartacus-educational.com/PRdribergT.htm Tom Driberg] Spartacus Educational. Retrieved 30 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

A failure of Knight's section was the entrapment of [[Ben Greene]], an anti-war activist, interned on the orders of the then [[Home Secretary]], [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|Sir John Anderson]], as a result of false evidence given by Knight's agent provocateur, Harald Kurtz.

Having been gazetted as a [[Second Lieutenant]] on the Special List in September 1939,&lt;ref&gt;''Second Supplement to [[The London Gazette]] of Friday, the 3rd of November, 1939'', p. 7490.&lt;/ref&gt; Knight was given the army rank of [[Major]] during the [[Second World War]], but designated as a "Civil Assistant, General Staff, [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|War Office]]." He was appointed as an [[OBE|Officer of the Civil Division of the Order of the British Empire]] in June 1943.&lt;ref&gt;''Third Supplement to [[The London Gazette]] of Friday, the 28th of May, 1943'', p. 2492.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apparently rejected and humiliated by Knight’s failure to consummate their marriage, his first wife took an overdose of [[barbiturates]] and died in 1934, leaving her large fortune to Knight.&lt;ref&gt;Annabel Venning [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2579722/Dark-secret-life-original-M-Spymaster-inspired-007s-boss-closet-gay-married-three-women-never-slept-reinventing-childrens-presenter-called-Uncle-Max.html#ixzz44O8zygOQ Dark secret life of the original 'M'], Mail Online (13 March 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;
Knight was married, secondly, in 1937 to Lois Mary Coplestone, and thirdly, in 1944, to Susan Barnes ("Susi").

[[Ian Fleming]], the author of the [[James Bond]] series of books, used an amalgam of Knight and his former superior [[Rear Admiral]] [[John Henry Godfrey]], Director of the [[Naval Intelligence Division]], as a model for the character "[[M (James Bond)|M]]," Bond's boss.

===BBC===

In 1946, Knight, who had been an ardent naturalist since childhood, began what was to become a successful broadcasting career on [[BBC]] radio, appearing in, and hosting such programmes as ''Naturalist'', ''Country Questions'' and ''Nature Parliament''. He appeared occasionally on television: in [[Peter Scott]]'s ''Look'' and in ''Animal, Vegetable or Mineral.''

Knight conducted his broadcasting career alongside his work in intelligence, until 1956, when he retired early from MI5, on the grounds of ill health, suffering from [[angina pectoris|angina]].

Knight, who wrote of his pet [[cuckoo]], 'Goo,' in ''A Cuckoo in the House'' (1955), was "one of many agents feeding into the phenomenon of British spies being bird enthusiasts. ‘Birdwatcher’ is old intelligence slang for spy. And the cuckoo – which infiltrates and imitates – was an ideal muse for a spy like Knight."&lt;ref&gt;Anoosh Chakelian, [http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/nature/2015/11/cuckoos-le-carr-and-conservation-forgotten-files-real-life-m Cuckoos, le Carré, and conservation: the forgotten files of the real-life "M"], [[New Statesman]] (13 November 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

Fellow naturalist and Knight enthusiast, [[Helen Macdonald (writer)|Helen Macdonald]], writes that "the cuckoo’s life beautifully mirrored the concerns of Knight’s own. First, its sex life was mysterious and secretive. So was Knight’s: for years, he’d maintained a hearty heterosexual facade while picking up rough trade in local cinemas and employing local motorcycle mechanics for reasons other than repairing motorcycles. Second, cuckoos were the avian equivalents of the officer-controller of penetration agents; they ‘insinuated’ their ‘chameleon eggs’ into the nests of their ‘dupes’."&lt;ref&gt;Helen Macdonald, [https://aeon.co/essays/the-tale-of-a-spymaster-and-his-avian-double Nest of spies ], [[Aeon]] (26 February 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Spies and birders, she writes elsewhere, "have the same skills, the ability to identify, recognise, be unobtrusive, invisible, hide. You pay careful attention to your surroundings. You never feel part of the crowd."&lt;ref name="macdonald"&gt;Helen Macdonald, [https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/may/12/fly-away-home-helen-macdonald-britain-birds-migration-spies Spies in the sky: Helen Macdonald on how birds reflect our national anxieties], [[The Guardian]] (12 May 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and death==

Knight was married in [[Sherborne Abbey]] on 29 December 1925 to Gwladys Evelyn Amy Poole.&lt;ref&gt;''Western Gazette'' (Friday, 1 January 1926), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Knight spent his last years at "The Wing," Josselyns, [[Midgham]], near Reading in [[Berkshire]], where he died, from [[heart failure]], on 24 January 1968.&lt;ref&gt;''The London Gazette'' (20 February 1968), p. 2181.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was survived by his third wife, Susi Maxwell Knight.

==Legacy==

After his death, the Maxwell Knight Memorial Fund was set up, which provided for the Maxwell Knight Young Naturalists' Library in the education centre of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]].

In October, 2015, a hitherto unpublished 50,000-word manuscript, entitled [https://thefrightenedfaceofnature.wordpress.com/ The Frightened Face of Nature], written by Knight in 1964, and discovered  by Professor John E. Cooper and Simon H. King in Knight's personal filing cabinet, was published in ''[[The Guardian]]'', under the headline, [https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2015/oct/28/spectre-of-destruction-the-lost-manuscript-of-the-real-life-m "Spectre of destruction": The Lost Manuscript of the Real-Life 'M']

The first [[national park]] established was [[Zangezur National Park]] in 2003. Since then a further 8 national parks have been established; the most recent being the [[Samur-Yalama National Park]] in 2012.  

The national parks are the public lands or bodies of water of special environmental, historical and other importance, which bear the status of governmental protection. They serve to the purposes of environmental protection, educational, scientific, cultural researches, etc.

==National Parks==

As a country located in the Caucasus between the Black and Caspian Seas, Azerbaijan has a rich flora and fauna and widest biodiversity among the European states and enormous natural resources. The lands with specially protected ecosystems play the crucial roles in biodiversity preservation. The activity of such natural bodies promotes the preservation of rare and endangered species of plants and animals. Azerbaijan has a total of 9 national parks (as well as 13 state natural parks and 21 state reserves), which are listed in the table with the year of their establishment and their surface area.

Sea coastal sand plants (42,6%), meadows with jigilgamish and paz grass (13,2%), one-year saline grasses (5,2%) etc. are spread. Ephemeras also develop well in early spring. In dry area gazelle, jackal, fox, rabbit, badger, in Caspian waters seal and various fishes, birds such as silver gull, wheezing swan, grey and red-headed black, white-eyed black ducks, big white bittern, sandpiper, bald-coot, marsh belibagli, sea bozcha and other migrant birds have inhabited here.
Animals and birds inhabiting in Shirvan National Park, names of which have been included in the Red Books, exist in Absheron National Park as well.

===Shahdag National Park===
{{main|Shahdag National Park}}
The Shakhdag National Park was created in 2006, and became the largest national park not only Azerbaijan but in the whole Caucasus.

The Shahdag National Park is located in northern Azerbaijan, on the border with Russia and Georgia at the Greater Caucasus Mountains. The World Bank has allocated a $17 million loan and $8 million grant for the national park's creation, while the government of Japan has provided $8 million as a grant for the project implementation. Shahdag National Park will help address ecological issues and build a tourist infrastructure in the Caucasus for visitors [http://today.az/news/business/41034.html].

===Göygöl National Park===
{{main|Göygöl National Park}}
The Göygöl National Park was created in 2008. The predecessor of Göygöl National Park during Soviet times was the "Goy Gol State Reserve" that was established in 1925. The Göygöl National Park is located in eastern Azerbaijan, on the northern slopes of the Lesser Caucasus and includes Lake Göygöl after which it is named. The area of Göygöl is almost entirely covered by forests and has a rich flora with over 420 plant species, including 20 which are endemic to the area. It also has a rich fauna, with mammals such as brown bears, Caucasian red deer, roe deer, lynx, etc. and birds such as the lammergeyer, raven, mountain partridge.

===Samur-Yalama National Park===
{{main|Samur-Yalama National Park}}
The Samur-Yalama National Park was created in 2012 and is currently the newest national park of Azerbaijan. The major part of the national park is in the Caspian coastal zone and is covered with forests. The types of habitats include the littoral zone, forest, bush and steppe. Some characteristic species are black kite, eastern imperial eagle, otter, reed cat, lynx, chamois, Caspian red deer and brown bear. In the coastal waters belonging to the national park, stellate sturgeon, brown trout, eel, pikeperch and Caspian kutum can be found.

{{Jurassic}}
The '''Oxfordian''' is, in the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]]' [[geologic timescale]], the earliest [[age (geology)|age]] of the [[Late Jurassic]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]], or the lowest [[stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] of the [[Upper Jurassic]] [[series (stratigraphy)|series]]. It spans the time between 163.5 ± 4 [[Annum#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]] and 157.3 ± 4 Ma (million years ago). The Oxfordian is preceded by the [[Callovian]] and is followed by the [[Kimmeridgian]].&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed geologic timescale see Gradstein ''et al''. (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stratigraphic definitions==
[[Image:Péry-Reuchenette Oxfordian.JPG|thumb|Cyclically alternating [[limestone]] (light, more [[Competence (geology)|competent]]) and marl/clay layers of Oxfordian age at [[Péry-Reuchenette]], near [[Tavannes]], [[Jura Mountains]], [[Switzerland]].]]

The Oxfordian stage was called "Clunch Clay and Shale" by William Smith (1815–1816); in 1818 W. Buckland described them under the unwieldy title "Oxford, Forest or Fen Clay". The term Oxfordian was introduced by  [[Alcide d'Orbigny]] in 1844. The name is derived from the English county of Oxford,&lt;ref&gt;Oxfordian is a word meaning "from Oxford" (see [[wiktionary:Oxfordian]]).&lt;/ref&gt; where the beds are well developed, but they crop out almost continuously from Dorsetshire to the coast of Yorkshire, generally forming low, broad valleys. They are well exposed at Weymouth, Oxford, Bedford, Peterborough, and in the cliffs at Scarborough, Red Cliff and Gristhorpe Bay. Rocks of this age are found also in Uig and Skye.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |last=Howe |first=John Allen |wstitle=Oxfordian |volume=20 |page=415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The base of the Oxfordian stage is defined as the point in the stratigraphic record where the [[ammonite]] species ''[[Brightia|Brightia thuouxensis]]'' first appears. A global reference profile for the base (a [[GSSP]]) had in 2009 not yet been assigned. The top of the Oxfordian stage (the base of the Kimmeridgian) is at the first appearance of [[ammonite]] species ''[[Pictonia|Pictonia baylei]]''.

In the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys domain]], the Oxfordian contains six ammonite [[biozone]]s:
*zone of ''[[Epipeltoceras|Epipeltoceras bimammatum]]''
*zone of ''[[Perishinctes|Perishinctes bifurcatus]]''
*zone of ''[[Gregoryceras|Gregoryceras transversarium]]''
*zone of ''[[Perisphinctes|Perisphinctes plicatilis]]''
*zone of ''[[Cardioceras|Cardioceras cordatum]]''
*zone of ''[[Quenstedtoceras|Quenstedtoceras mariae]]''

The '''Paraná-Etendeka traps''' (or '''Paraná and Etendeka Plateau'''; or '''Paraná and Etendeka Province''') comprise a [[large igneous province]] that includes both the main Paraná [[Trap rock |traps]] (in [[Paraná Basin]], a [[South American]] [[geological basin]]) as well as the smaller severed portions of the [[flood basalt]]s at the Etendeka traps (in northwest [[Namibia]] and southwest [[Angola]]). The original basalt flows occurred 128 to 138 million years ago. The province had a post-flow surface area of 1.5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; km² (580,000 miles²)  and an original volume projected to be in excess of 2.3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; km³.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Sur l'âge des trapps basaltiques (On the ages of flood basalt events) |first=Vincent E. |last=Courtillot |first2=Paul R. |last2=Renneb |journal=Comptes Rendus Geoscience |volume=335 |issue=1 |date=January 2003 |pages=113–140 |doi=10.1016/S1631-0713(03)00006-3|bibcode=2003CRGeo.335..113C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=R.V. |last=Fodor |first2=E.H. |last2=McKee |first3=A. |last3=Roisenberg |title=Age distribution of Serra Geral (Paraná) flood basalts, southern Brazil |journal=Journal of South American Earth Sciences |volume=2 |issue=4 |year=1989 |pages=343–349 |doi=10.1016/0895-9811(89)90012-6 |bibcode = 1989JSAES...2..343F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpretations of geochemistry, including [[isotope]]s, have led geologists to conclude that the magmas forming the traps and associated [[igneous rock]]s originated by [[partial melting|melting]] of [[asthenosphere|asthenosphic mantle]] due to the arrival of a [[mantle plume]] to the base of Earth's [[lithosphere]]. Then much of the magma was [[crustal contamination|contaminated]] with [[continental crust|crustal materials]] prior to their eruption.

'''Probabilistic prognosis''' means the anticipation of future events based on a [[probability|probabilistic]] structure of past experiences of individual and present situations. Past experiences and present situations help to create [[hypothesis]] about the forthcoming future and attributes certain probabilities to them. According to probabilistic prognosis, the preparation of an individual occurs to corresponding actions.

This ability is the result of [[Evolution|biological evolution]] in a probabilistically organized environment. The prognosis of living creatures optimizes the results of their actions, and therefore they are adequate, exactly to those variable characteristics of environment on which the success of action – satisfaction of needs, achieving goals, depends on.

Under some pathological conditions, such as [[schizophrenia]], local [[brain damage|damage of the brain]], the probabilistic prognosis mechanism can be disturbed. The theory of probabilistic prognosis originated as a continuation of [[Nikolai Bernstein]]'s ideas stated in his work "Essays of the Physiology of Movement and Physiology of Activity" (1966).
A new direction of studies of probabilistic prognosis started with works of Professor J. Feigenberg (1969), Professor M. Tsiskaridze (1969), and Professor V. Ivannikov (1971), and later were widely explored by other scientists. Studies of probabilistic prognosis remain topical until now and have many followers.

[[File:Radio-frequency-anechoic-chamber-HDR-0a.jpg|thumb|right|An RF anechoic chamber used for EMC testing.]]
'''Radiation-absorbent material''', usually known as '''RAM''', is a material which has been specially designed and shaped to [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorb]] incident RF radiation (also known as [[non-ionising radiation]]), as effectively as possible, from as many incident directions as possible. The more effective the RAM, the lower the resulting level of [[reflection (physics)|reflected]] RF radiation. Many measurements in [[electromagnetic compatibility]] (EMC) and antenna radiation patterns require that spurious signals arising from the test setup, including reflections, are negligible to avoid the risk of causing [[observational error|measurement errors]] and ambiguities.

==Introduction==
[[File:Large Drive-In EMC Test Chamber.png|thumb|right|A large drive-in RF anechoic test chamber. Note the orange caution cones for size reference.]]
[[File:Anechoic chamber wall.JPG|thumb|Pyramid RAM. The grey paint helps to protect the delicate RAM material.]]
One of the most effective types of RAM comprises arrays of [[pyramid]] shaped pieces, each of which is constructed from a suitably [[lossy material]]. To work effectively, all internal surfaces of the anechoic chamber must be entirely covered with RAM. Sections of RAM may be temporarily removed to install equipment but they must be replaced before performing any tests. To be sufficiently lossy, RAM can be neither a good [[electrical conductor]] nor a good [[electrical insulator]] as neither type actually absorbs any power. Typically pyramidal RAM will comprise a [[rubber]]ized [[foam]] material impregnated with controlled mixtures of [[carbon]] and [[iron]]. The length from base to tip of the pyramid structure is chosen based on the lowest expected frequency and the amount of absorption required. For low frequency damping, this distance is often 24&amp;nbsp;inches, while high-frequency panels are as short as 3&amp;ndash;4&amp;nbsp;inches. Panels of RAM are typically installed on the walls of an [[anechoic chamber|EMC test chamber]] with the tips pointing inward to the chamber. Pyramidal RAM attenuates signal by two effects: scattering and absorption. Scattering can occur both coherently, when reflected waves are in-phase but directed away from the receiver, or incoherently where waves are picked up by the receiver but are out of phase and thus have lower signal strength. This incoherent scattering also occurs within the foam structure, with the suspended carbon particles promoting destructive interference. Internal scattering can result in as much as 10&amp;nbsp;dB of attenuation. Meanwhile, the pyramid shapes are cut at angles that maximize the number of bounces a wave makes within the structure. With each bounce, the wave loses energy to the foam material and thus exits with lower signal strength.&lt;ref&gt;E Knott, J Shaeffer, M Tulley, Radar Cross Section. pp 528&amp;ndash;531. {{ISBN|0-89006-618-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative type of RAM comprises flat plates of [[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]] material, in the form of flat [[tile]]s fixed to all interior surfaces of the chamber. This type has a smaller effective frequency range than the pyramidal RAM and is designed to be fixed to good conductive surfaces. It is generally easier to fit and more durable than the pyramidal type RAM but is less effective at higher frequencies. Its performance might however be quite adequate if tests are limited to lower frequencies (ferrite plates have a damping curve that makes them most effective between 30&amp;ndash;1000&amp;nbsp;MHz). There is also a hybrid type, a ferrite in pyramidal shape. Containing the advantages of both technologies, the frequency range can be maximized while the pyramid remains small (10&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=875567&amp;isnumber=18905 Fully compact anechoic chamber using the pyramidal ferrite absorber for immunity test]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in stealth technology==
Radar-absorbent RAM is used in [[stealth technology]] to disguise a vehicle or structure from [[radar]] detection. A material's absorbency at a given frequency of radar wave depends upon its composition. RAM cannot perfectly absorb radar at any frequency, but any given composition does have greater absorbency at some frequencies than others;  no one RAM is suited to absorption of all radar frequencies. A common misunderstanding is that RAM makes an object invisible to radar. A radar-absorbent material can significantly reduce an object's [[radar cross-section]] in specific radar frequencies, but it does not result in "invisibility" on any frequency. Bad weather may contribute to deficiencies in stealth capability.

===History===
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
The earliest forms of stealth coating were the materials called ''Sumpf'' and ''Schornsteinfeger'', a coating used by the German navy during [[World War II]] for the [[Submarine snorkel|snorkel]]s (or [[periscopes]]) of [[submarine]]s, to lower their reflectivity in the 20-cm radar band the Allies used. The material had a layered structure and was based on [[graphite]] particles and other [[semiconductive]] materials embedded in a [[rubber]] matrix. The material's efficiency was partially reduced by the action of sea water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Types of radar-absorbent material (RAM)===

====Iron ball paint absorber====
[[File:F-117 Nighthawk Front.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk]] utilises iron ball paint]] 
One of the most commonly known types of RAM is iron ball paint. It contains tiny spheres coated with [[carbonyl iron]] or [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]]. [[Radar]] waves induce molecular oscillations from the alternating magnetic field in this paint, which leads to conversion of the radar energy into heat. The heat is then transferred to the aircraft and dissipated.  The iron particles in the paint are obtained by decomposition of [[iron pentacarbonyl]] and may contain traces of [[carbon]], [[oxygen]], and [[nitrogen]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} One technique used in the [[F-117A Nighthawk]] and other such stealth aircraft is to use electrically isolated carbonyl iron balls of specific dimensions suspended in a two-part epoxy paint. Each of these microscopic spheres is coated in [[silicon dioxide]] as an insulator through a proprietary process. Then, during the fabrication panel process, while the paint is still liquid, a magnetic field is applied with a specific Gauss strength and at a specific distance to create a magnetic field patterns in the carbonyl iron balls within the liquid paint [[ferrofluid]]. The paint then cures [hardens] whilst the magnetic field holds the particles in suspension, locking the balls into their magnetic pattern. Some experimentation has been done applying opposing north-south magnetic fields to opposing sides of the painted panels causing the carbonyl iron particles to align (standing up on end so they are three-dimensionally parallel to the magnetic field). The carbonyl iron ball paint is most effective when the balls are evenly dispersed, electrically isolated, and present a gradient of progressively greater density to the incoming radar waves.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} A related type of RAM consists of [[neoprene]] polymer sheets with ferrite grains or conductive [[carbon black]] particles (containing about 0.30% of crystalline [[graphite]] by cured weight) embedded in the polymer matrix. The tiles were used on early versions of the F-117A Nighthawk, although more recent models use painted RAM. The painting of the F-117 is done by industrial robots so  the paint can be applied consistently in specific layer thicknesses and densities. The plane is covered in tiles "glued" to the fuselage and the remaining gaps are filled with iron ball "glue."{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The [[United States Air Force]] introduced a radar-absorbent paint made from both [[ferrofluid]]ic and nonmagnetic substances. By reducing the reflection of electromagnetic waves, this material helps to reduce the visibility of RAM-painted aircraft on radar.&lt;!-- .(Invented by Wayne Gindrup of Conroe, Texas) {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} --&gt; The Israeli firm [[Nanoflight]] has also made a radar-absorbing paint that uses nanoparticles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2010-07/stealth-paint-turns-any-aircraft-radar-evading-stealth-plane&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Taiwan|Republic of China (Taiwan)'s]] [[Republic of China Armed Forces|military]] has also successfully developed radar-absorbing paint which is currently used on Taiwanese stealth warships and the Taiwanese-built stealth jet fighter which is currently in development in response to the development of stealth technology by their rival, the mainland [[People's Republic of China]] which is known to have displayed both stealth warships and planes to the public.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2011/07/05/2003507440&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spacewar.com/reports/Taiwan_to_build_stealth_warship_fleet_999.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Foam absorber====
Foam absorber is used as lining of [[anechoic chamber]]s for electromagnetic radiation measurements.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} This material typically consists of a fireproofed urethane foam loaded with conductive carbon black [carbonyl iron spherical particles, and/or crystalline graphite particles] in mixtures between 0.05% and 0.1% (by weight in finished product), and cut into square pyramids with dimensions set specific to the wavelengths of interest. Further improvements can be made when the conductive particulates are layered in a density gradient, so  the tip of the pyramid has the lowest percentage of particles and the base contains the highest density of particles. This presents a "soft" impedance change to incoming radar waves and further reduces reflection (echo). The length from base to tip, and width of the base of the pyramid structure is chosen based on the lowest expected frequency when a wide-band absorber is sought. For low-frequency damping in military applications, this distance is often 24&amp;nbsp;in, while high-frequency panels are as short as 3-4&amp;nbsp;in. An example of a high-frequency application would be the police radar (speed-measuring radar K and Ka band), the pyramids would have a dimension around 4 in long and a 2 x 2-in base. That pyramid would set on a 2 x 2-in  cubical base that is 1in high (total height of pyramid and base of about 5 in). The four edges of the pyramid are softly sweeping arcs giving the pyramid a slightly "bloated" look. This arc provides some additional scatter and prevents any sharp edge from creating a coherent reflection. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Panels of RAM are installed with the tips of the pyramids pointing toward the radar source. These pyramids may also be hidden behind an outer nearly radar-transparent shell where aerodynamics are required. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Pyramidal RAM attenuates signal by scattering and absorption. Scattering can occur both coherently, when reflected waves are in-phase but directed away from the receiver, or incoherently where waves may be reflected back to the receiver but are out of phase and thus have lower signal strength. A good example of coherent reflection is in the faceted shape of the F-117A stealth aircraft which presents angles to the radar source such that coherent waves are reflected away from the point of origin (usually the detection source). Incoherent scattering also occurs within the foam structure, with the suspended conductive particles promoting destructive interference. Internal scattering can result in as much as 10&amp;nbsp;dB of attenuation. Meanwhile, the pyramid shapes are cut at angles that maximize the number of bounces a wave makes within the structure. With each bounce, the wave loses energy to the foam material and thus exits with lower signal strength.&lt;ref&gt;E Knott, J Shaeffer, M Tulley, Radar Cross Section. pp 528-531. {{ISBN|0-89006-618-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other foam absorbers are available in flat sheets, using an increasing gradient of carbon loadings in different layers. Absorption within the foam material occurs when radar energy is converted to heat in the conductive particle. Therefore, in applications where high radar energies are involved, cooling fans are used to exhaust the heat generated. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

====Jaumann absorber====
A Jaumann absorber or Jaumann layer is a radar-absorbent substance.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} When first introduced in 1943, the Jaumann layer consisted of two equally spaced reflective surfaces and a conductive ground plane. One can think of it as a generalized, multilayered [[Salisbury screen]], as the principles are similar. Being a resonant absorber (i.e. it uses wave interfering to cancel the reflected wave), the Jaumann layer is dependent upon the λ/4 spacing between the first reflective surface and the ground plane and between the two reflective surfaces (a total of λ/4 + λ/4 ). Because the wave can resonate at two frequencies, the Jaumann layer produces two absorption maxima across a band of wavelengths (if using the two layers configuration). These absorbers must have all of the layers parallel to each other and the ground plane that they conceal. More elaborate Jaumann absorbers use series of [[dielectric]] surfaces that separate conductive sheets. The conductivity of those sheets increases with proximity to the ground plane.

====Split-ring resonator absorber====
{{Main|Split-ring resonator}}

Split-ring resonators (SRRs) in various test configurations have been shown to be extremely effective as radar absorbers. SRR technology can be used in conjunction with the technologies above to provide a cumulative absorption effect. SRR technology is particularly effective when used on faceted shapes that have perfectly flat surfaces that present no direct reflections back to the radar source (such as the F-117A). This technology uses photographic process to create a resist layer on a thin (about 0.007 in) copper foil on a dielectric backing (thin circuit board material)  etched into tuned resonator arrays, each individual resonator being in a "C" shape (or other shape—such as a square). Each SRR is electrically isolated and all dimensions are carefully specified to optimize absorption at a specific radar wavelength. Not being a closed loop "O", the opening in the "C" presents a gap of specific dimension which acts as a capacitor. At 35&amp;nbsp;GHz, the diameter of the "C" is near 5&amp;nbsp;mm. The resonator can be tuned to specific wavelengths and multiple SRRs can be stacked with insulating layers of specific thicknesses between them to provide a wide-band absorption of radar energy. When stacked, the smaller SRRs (high-frequency) in the range face the radar source first (like a stack of donuts that get progressively larger as one moves away from the radar source) stacks of three have been shown to be effective in providing wide-band attenuation. SRR technology acts very much in the same way that antireflective  coatings operate at optical wavelengths. SRR technology provides the most effective radar attenuation of any technologies known previously and is one step closer to reaching complete invisibility (total stealth, "cloaking"). Work is also progressing in visual wavelengths, as well as infrared wavelengths (LIDAR-absorbing materials). {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==== Carbon nanotube ====
{{main|Carbon nanotube}}
Radars work in the microwave frequency range, which can be absorbed by multi-wall nanotubes (MWNTs). Applying the MWNTs to the aircraft would cause the radar to be absorbed and therefore seem to have a smaller [[radar cross-section]]. One such application could be to paint the nanotubes onto the plane. Recently there has been some work done at the [[University of Michigan]] regarding carbon nanotubes usefulness as [[stealth technology]] on aircraft. It has been found that in addition to the radar absorbing properties, the nanotubes neither reflect nor scatter visible light, making it essentially invisible at night, much like painting current [[stealth aircraft]] black except much more effective. Current limitations in manufacturing, however, mean that current production of nanotube-coated aircraft is not possible. One theory to overcome these current limitations is to cover small particles with the nanotubes and suspend the nanotube-covered particles in a medium such as paint, which can then be applied to a surface, like a stealth aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Bourzac, Katherine. [http://www.technologyreview.com/article/39238/?mod=chfeatured "Nano Paint Could Make Airplanes Invisible to Radar."] Technology Review. MIT, 5 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Silicon Carbide ====

Silicon carbide is the same material used in many sharpening stones or discs. This material in finely powdered form is added to standard heat resistant paint base to absorb radar on stealth aircraft. To check radar or general electromagnetic wave absorption of materials, they can be tested in an ordinary microwave oven. Water works very well as does silicon carbide, which is why such materials heat well. Most metals reflect radio waves so they are also detected by radar, and thus cannot be used or heated in a microwave oven.

'''Roberto Mantovani''' (25 March 1854 &amp;ndash; 10 January 1933), was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[geologist]] and [[violin]]ist.

Mantovani was born in [[Parma]].  His father, Timoteo, died seven months after his birth. His mother, Luigia Ferrari, directed him to studies, and at the age of 11 he was accepted as a boarder in the Royal School of Music, where he was conferred with the [[Honorary Degree]] in August 1872. He always preferred the exact sciences and literature to music.

In 1889 and 1909 Mantovani published a hypothesis of an [[Expanding Earth theory|expanding earth]] and [[continental drift]]. He assumed that a closed continent covered the entire surface of a smaller earth. Through [[Volcanism|volcanic]] activity because of [[thermal expansion]] this continent broke, so that the new continents were drifting away from each other because of further expansion of the rip-zones, where now the oceans lie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Mantovani, R.| author-link =| title = Les fractures de l’écorce terrestre et la théorie de Laplace | journal= Bull. Soc. Sc. Et Arts Réunion | pages=41–53| year=1889}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Mantovani, R.| title = L’Antarctide |journal= Je m’instruis. La science pour tous |volume=38 | pages=595–597| year=1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Alfred Wegener]] saw similarities to his own theory, but did not support Mantovani's earth-expansion hypothesis. He wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | author=Wegener, A. | title = The Origin of Continents and Oceans | origyear=1929| year=1966 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=0-486-61708-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{cquote|In a short article in 1909 Mantovani expressed some ideas on continental displacement and explained them by means of maps which differ in part from mine but at some points agree astonishingly closely: for example, in regard to the earlier grouping of the southern continents around southern Africa.}}

He died in [[Paris]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6980">In various scientific contexts, a '''scale height''' is a distance over which a quantity decreases by a factor of ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]'' (approximately 2.72, the base of [[natural logarithms]]). It is usually denoted by the capital letter ''H''.

==Scale height used in a simple atmospheric pressure model==

For planetary atmospheres, '''scale height''' is the increase in altitude for which the [[atmospheric pressure]] decreases by a factor of ''e''. The scale height remains constant for a particular temperature. It can be calculated by&lt;ref name=AMS&gt;
{{cite web
 |title= Glossary of Meteorology - scale height
 |url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Scale_height
 |publisher= [[American Meteorological Society]] (AMS)
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wolfram&gt;
{{cite web
 |title= Pressure Scale Height
 |url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/PressureScaleHeight.html
 |publisher= [[Wolfram Research]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;H = \frac{kT}{mg}&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently

:&lt;math&gt;H = \frac{RT}{Mg}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

* ''k'' = [[Boltzmann constant]] = 1.38 x 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;23&lt;/sup&gt; J·K&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;
* ''R'' = [[Gas constant]]
* ''T'' = mean atmospheric [[temperature]] in [[kelvin]]s = 250 K&lt;ref name=Jacob1999&gt;
{{cite web
 |title= Daniel J. Jacob: "Introduction to Atmospheric Chemistry", Princeton University Press, 1999
 |url=http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/people/faculty/djj/book/bookchap2.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt; for Earth
* ''m'' = mean mass of a molecule (units kg)
* ''M'' = mean molecular molar mass of one atmospheric particle = 0.029&amp;nbsp;kg/mol for Earth
* ''g'' = [[acceleration]] due to [[gravity]] on planetary surface (m/s²)

The pressure (force per unit area) at a given altitude is a result of the weight of the overlying atmosphere. If at a height of ''z'' the atmosphere has [[density]] ''&amp;rho;'' and pressure ''P'', then moving upwards at an infinitesimally small height ''dz'' will decrease the pressure by amount ''dP'', equal to the weight of a layer of atmosphere of thickness ''dz''.

Thus:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dz} = -g\rho&lt;/math&gt;

where ''g'' is the acceleration due to gravity. For small ''dz'' it is possible to assume ''g'' to be constant; the minus sign indicates that as the height increases the pressure decreases. Therefore, using the [[equation of state]] for an [[ideal gas]] of mean molecular mass ''M'' at temperature ''T,'' the density can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \frac{MP}{kT}&lt;/math&gt;

Combining these equations gives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{P} = \frac{-dz}{\frac{kT}{Mg}}&lt;/math&gt;

which can then be incorporated with the equation for ''H'' given above to give:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{P} = - \frac{dz}{H}&lt;/math&gt;

which will not change unless the temperature does. Integrating the above and assuming where ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the pressure at height ''z'' = 0 (pressure at [[sea level]]) the pressure at height ''z'' can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;P = P_0\exp\left(-\frac{z}{H}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

This translates as the pressure [[exponential decay|decreasing exponentially]] with height.&lt;ref name=iapetus_1&gt;
{{cite web
 |title = Example: The scale height of the Earth's atmosphere
 |url   = http://iapetus.phy.umist.ac.uk/Teaching/SolarSystem/WorkedExample4.pdf
}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]], the pressure at sea level ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; averages about 1.01×10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Pa, the mean molecular mass of dry air is 28.964 [[unified atomic mass unit|u]] and hence 28.964 &amp;times; 1.660×10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;27&lt;/sup&gt; = 4.808×10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;26&lt;/sup&gt; kg, and ''[[standard gravity|g]]'' = 9.81&amp;nbsp;m/s².  As a function of temperature the scale height of Earth's atmosphere is therefore 1.38/(4.808&amp;times;9.81)×10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 29.26 m/deg.  This yields the following scale heights for representative air temperatures.

:''T'' = 290 K, ''H'' = 8500 m
:''T'' = 273 K, ''H'' = 8000 m
:''T'' = 260 K, ''H'' = 7610 m
:''T'' = 210 K, ''H'' = 6000 m

These figures should be compared with the temperature and density of Earth's atmosphere plotted at [[NRLMSISE-00]], which shows the air density dropping from 1200 g/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at sea level to 0.5&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = .125 g/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 70&amp;nbsp;km, a factor of 9600, indicating an average scale height of 70/ln(9600) = 7.64&amp;nbsp;km, consistent with the indicated average air temperature over that range of close to 260 K.

Note:
* Density is related to pressure by the [[ideal gas]] laws. Therefore—with some departures caused by varying temperature—density will also decrease exponentially with height from a sea level value of ''&amp;rho;''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; roughly equal to 1.2&amp;nbsp;kg&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt;
* At heights over 100&amp;nbsp;km, molecular [[diffusion]] means that each molecular atomic species has its own scale height.

In [[nuclear physics]], the '''semi-empirical mass formula''' ('''SEMF''') (sometimes also called '''Weizsäcker's formula''', or the '''Bethe–Weizsäcker formula''', or the '''Bethe–Weizsäcker mass formula''' to distinguish it from the [[Bethe–Weizsäcker process]]) is used to approximate the [[mass]] and various other properties of an [[atomic nucleus]] from its number of [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s.  As the name suggests, it is based partly on theory and partly on empirical measurements.  The theory is based on the '''liquid drop model''' proposed by [[George Gamow]], which can account for most of the terms in the formula and gives rough estimates for the values of the coefficients.  It was first formulated in 1935  by German physicist [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]], and although refinements have been made to the coefficients over the years, the structure of the formula remains the same today.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |last=von Weizsäcker |first=C. F. |year=1935 |title=Zur Theorie der Kernmassen |language=German |journal=[[Zeitschrift für Physik]] |volume=96 |issue=7–8 |pages=431–458 |bibcode=1935ZPhy...96..431W |doi=10.1007/BF01337700 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bailey&gt; {{cite web |last=Bailey |first=D. |title=Semi-empirical Nuclear Mass Formula |url=http://www.upscale.utoronto.ca/GeneralInterest/DBailey/SubAtomic/Lectures/LectF25/Lect25.htm |work=PHY357: Strings &amp; Binding Energy |publisher=[[University of Toronto]] |accessdate=2011-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SEMF gives a good approximation for atomic masses and several other effects, but does not explain the appearance of [[magic number (physics)|magic numbers]] of protons and neutrons, and the extra binding-energy and measure of stability that are associated with these numbers of nucleons.

==The liquid drop model and its analysis==
[[File:Bethe-Weizsäcker.png|right|thumb|300 px|A graphical representation of the semi-empirical binding energy formula. The binding energy per nucleon in MeV (highest numbers in yellow, in excess of 8.5 MeV per nucleon) is plotted for various [[nuclide]]s as a function of ''Z'', the [[atomic number]] (on the y-axis), vs. ''N'', the [[neutron number]] (on the x-axis). The highest binding energies are seen for  ''Z'' = 26 (iron).]]

The liquid drop model in [[nuclear physics]] treats the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] as a drop of incompressible nuclear fluid of very high density.  It was first proposed by [[George Gamow]] and then developed by [[Niels Bohr]] and [[John Archibald Wheeler]].  The nucleus is made of [[nucleon]]s ([[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s), which are held together by the [[Nuclear force#The nuclear force as a residual of the strong force|nuclear force]] (a residual effect of the [[strong nuclear force|strong force]]). This is very similar to the structure of a spherical liquid drop made of microscopic molecules. This is a crude model that does not explain all the properties of the nucleus, but does explain the spherical shape of most nuclei. It also helps to predict the [[nuclear binding energy]] and to assess how much is available for consumption.

Mathematical analysis of the theory delivers an equation which attempts to predict the binding energy of a nucleus in terms of the numbers of [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s it contains.  This equation has five terms on its right hand side.  These correspond to the cohesive binding of all the [[nucleon]]s by the nuclear force, a [[Surface tension|surface energy]] term, the [[electrostatic|electrostatic (Coulomb)]] mutual repulsion of the protons, an asymmetry term (derivable from the protons and neutrons occupying independent [[quantum]] [[momentum]] states) and a pairing term (partly derivable from the protons and neutrons occupying independent [[quantum]] [[spin (physics)|spin]] states).

If we consider the sum of the following five types of energies, then the picture of a nucleus as a drop of incompressible liquid roughly accounts for the observed variation of binding energy of the nucleus:

[[File:Liquid drop model.svg|thumb|300 px|Illustration of the terms of the semi-empirical mass formula in the liquid drop model of the atomic nucleus.]]

''Volume energy''.  When an assembly of nucleons of the same size is packed together into the smallest volume, each interior nucleon has a certain number of other nucleons in contact with it. So, this nuclear energy is proportional to the volume.

''Surface energy''.  A nucleon at the surface of a nucleus interacts with fewer other nucleons than one in the interior of the nucleus and hence its binding energy is less. This surface energy term takes that into account and is therefore negative and is proportional to the surface area.

''[[Coulomb's law|Coulomb]] Energy''. The electric repulsion between each pair of protons in a nucleus contributes toward decreasing its binding energy.

''Asymmetry energy'' (also called [[Wolfgang Pauli|Pauli]] Energy).  An energy associated with the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. Were it not for the Coulomb energy, the most stable form of nuclear matter would have the same number of neutrons as protons, since unequal numbers of neutrons and protons imply filling higher energy levels for one type of particle, while leaving lower energy levels vacant for the other type.

''Pairing energy''.  An energy which is a correction term that arises from the tendency of proton pairs and neutron pairs to occur. An even number of particles is more stable than an odd number.

==The formula==
In the following formula, let ''A'' be the total number of [[nucleon]]s, ''Z'' the number of [[proton]]s, and ''N'' the number of [[neutron]]s, so that ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''Z''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''N''.

The mass of an atomic nucleus is given by
:&lt;math&gt;m = Z m_p + N m_n - \frac{E_B}{c^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;m_p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_n&lt;/math&gt; are the rest mass of a proton and a neutron, respectively, and &lt;math&gt;E_B&lt;/math&gt; is the [[binding energy]] of the nucleus.  The semi-empirical mass formula states that the binding energy will take the following form:
:&lt;math&gt;E_B = a_V A - a_{S} A^{2/3} - a_C \frac{Z(Z-1)}{A^{1/3}} - a_A \frac{(A - 2Z)^2} A - \delta(A,Z)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=OSUFormula&gt;{{cite web|author1=Oregon State University|title=Nuclear Masses and Binding  Energy Lesson 3|url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/ch374/ch418518/lecture3-1.pdf|accessdate=30 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930014054/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/ch374/ch418518/lecture3-1.pdf|archivedate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the terms in this formula has a theoretical basis, as will be explained below. The coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_V&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_C&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_A&lt;/math&gt; and a coefficient that appears in the formula for &lt;math&gt;\delta(A,Z)&lt;/math&gt; are determined empirically.

==Terms==

===Volume term===

The term &lt;math&gt;a_{V} A&lt;/math&gt; is known as the ''volume term''.  The volume of the nucleus is proportional to ''A'', so this term is proportional to the volume, hence the name.

The basis for this term is the [[Strong interaction|strong nuclear force]].  The strong force affects both protons and neutrons, and as expected, this term is independent of ''Z''.  Because the number of pairs that can be taken from ''A'' particles is &lt;math&gt;\frac{A(A - 1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, one might expect a term proportional to &lt;math&gt;A^{2}&lt;/math&gt;.  However, the strong force has a very limited range, and a given nucleon may only interact strongly with its nearest neighbors and next nearest neighbors.  Therefore, the number of pairs of particles that actually interact is roughly proportional to ''A'', giving the volume term its form.

The coefficient &lt;math&gt;a_{V}&lt;/math&gt; is smaller than the binding energy of the nucleons to their neighbours &lt;math&gt;E_b&lt;/math&gt;, which is of order of 40 [[MeV]]. This is because the larger the number of [[nucleon]]s in the nucleus, the larger their kinetic energy is, due to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. If one treats the nucleus as a [[Fermi ball]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; [[nucleon]]s, with equal numbers of protons and neutrons, then the total kinetic energy is &lt;math&gt;{3\over 5} A \varepsilon_F&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_F&lt;/math&gt; the [[Fermi energy]] which is [[Fermi energy#Nucleus|estimated]] as 28 [[MeV]]. Thus the expected value of &lt;math&gt;a_{V}&lt;/math&gt; in this model is &lt;math&gt;E_b - {3\over 5}\varepsilon_F \sim 17\;\mathrm{MeV} &lt;/math&gt;, not far from the measured value.

===Surface term===

The term &lt;math&gt;a_{S} A^{2/3}&lt;/math&gt; is known as the ''surface term''.  This term, also based on the strong force, is a correction to the volume term.

The volume term suggests that each nucleon interacts with a constant number of nucleons, independent of ''A''.  While this is very nearly true for nucleons deep within the nucleus, those nucleons on the surface of the nucleus have fewer nearest neighbors, justifying this correction. This can also be thought of as a [[surface tension]] term, and indeed a similar mechanism creates [[surface tension]] in liquids.

If the volume of the nucleus is proportional to ''A'', then the radius should be proportional to &lt;math&gt;A^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt; and the surface area to &lt;math&gt;A^{2/3}&lt;/math&gt;.  This explains why the surface term is proportional to &lt;math&gt;A^{2/3}&lt;/math&gt;. It can also be deduced that &lt;math&gt;a_S&lt;/math&gt; should have a similar order of magnitude as &lt;math&gt;a_V&lt;/math&gt;.

===Coulomb term===
The term &lt;math&gt;a_{C} \frac{Z(Z-1)}{A^{1/3}}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;a_{C}\frac{Z^2}{A^{1/3}}&lt;/math&gt;  is known as the ''Coulomb'' or ''electrostatic term''.

The basis for this term is the [[electromagnetic force|electrostatic repulsion]] between protons.  To a very rough approximation, the nucleus can be considered a sphere of uniform [[electric charge|charge]] density.  The [[potential energy]] of such a charge distribution can be shown to be
:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{3}{5} \left( \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \right) \frac{Q^{2}}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Q'' is the total charge and ''R'' is the radius of the sphere.  Identifying ''Q'' with &lt;math&gt;Z e&lt;/math&gt;, and noting as above that the radius is proportional to &lt;math&gt;A^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;, we get close to the form of the Coulomb term. However, because electrostatic repulsion will only exist for more than one proton, &lt;math&gt;Z^2&lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt;Z(Z-1)&lt;/math&gt;. The value of &lt;math&gt;a_{C}&lt;/math&gt; can be approximately calculated using the equation above:

[[Nuclear size|Empirical nuclear radius]]:

:&lt;math&gt;R \approx r_0 A^{\frac{1}{3}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Quantum charge integers:

:&lt;math&gt;Q = Ze \ &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z^2 \approx Z(Z - 1) \ .&lt;/math&gt;

Solving by substitution:
:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{3}{5} \left( \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \right) \frac{Q^2}{R} = \frac{3}{5} \left( \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \right) \frac{(Ze)^2}{(r_0 A^{\frac{1}{3}})} = \frac{3 e^2 Z^2}{20 \pi  \varepsilon_{0} r_0 A^{\frac{1}{3}}} \approx \frac{3 e^2 Z(Z - 1)}{20 \pi  \varepsilon_0 r_0 A^{\frac{1}{3}}} = a_C \frac{Z(Z-1)}{A^{1/3}}&lt;/math&gt;

Potential energy of charge distribution:
:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{3 e^2 Z(Z - 1)}{20 \pi  \varepsilon_0 r_0 A^{\frac{1}{3}}}&lt;/math&gt;

Electrostatic Coulomb constant:
:&lt;math&gt;a_C = \frac{3 e^2}{20 \pi \varepsilon_0 r_0}&lt;/math&gt;

The value of &lt;math&gt;a_C&lt;/math&gt; using the [[fine structure constant]]:

:&lt;math&gt;a_C = \frac{3}{5} \left( \frac{\hbar c \alpha}{r_0} \right)=\frac{3}{5} \left( \frac{R_P}{r_0} \right)\alpha m_pc^2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the [[fine structure constant]] and &lt;math&gt;r_0 A^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Nuclear size|radius of a nucleus]], giving &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt; to be approximately 1.25 [[femtometer]]s. &lt;math&gt;R_P&lt;/math&gt; is the proton Compton radius and &lt;math&gt;m_p&lt;/math&gt; the proton mass. This gives &lt;math&gt;a_C&lt;/math&gt; an approximate theoretical value of 0.691 [[MeV]], not far from the measured value.

:&lt;math&gt;a_C = 0.691 \text{ MeV}&lt;/math&gt;

===Asymmetry term===
[[Image:Semf asymmetric term.svg|right|300 px|Illustration of basis for asymmetric term]]

The term &lt;math&gt;a_A \frac{(A - 2Z)^2}{A}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;4a_A\frac{((A/2)-Z)^2}{A}&lt;/math&gt; is known as the ''asymmetry term''.  Note that as &lt;math&gt;A = N + Z&lt;/math&gt;, the parenthesized expression can be rewritten as &lt;math&gt;(N - Z)&lt;/math&gt;.  The form &lt;math&gt;(A - 2Z)&lt;/math&gt; is used to keep the dependence on ''A'' explicit, as it will be important for a number of uses of the formula.

The theoretical justification for this term is more complex.  The [[Pauli exclusion principle]] states that no two [[Identical particles|identical]] [[fermion]]s can occupy exactly the same [[quantum state]] in an atom.  At a given energy level, there are only finitely many quantum states available for particles.  What this means in the nucleus is that as more particles are "added", these particles must occupy higher energy levels, increasing the total energy of the nucleus (and decreasing the binding energy).  Note that this effect is not based on any of the fundamental forces ([[Gravity|gravitational]], electromagnetic, etc.), only the Pauli exclusion principle.

Protons and neutrons, being distinct types of particles, occupy different quantum states.  One can think of two different "pools" of states, one for protons and one for neutrons.  Now, for example, if there are significantly more neutrons than protons in a nucleus, some of the neutrons will be higher in energy than the available states in the proton pool.  If we could move some particles from the neutron pool to the proton pool, in other words change some neutrons into protons, we would significantly decrease the energy.  The imbalance between the number of protons and neutrons causes the energy to be higher than it needs to be, ''for a given number of nucleons''.  This is the basis for the asymmetry term.

The actual form of the asymmetry term can again be derived by modelling the nucleus as a Fermi ball of protons and neutrons. Its total kinetic energy is 
:&lt;math&gt;E_k = {3 \over 5} (N_p {\varepsilon_F}_p + N_n {\varepsilon_F}_n)&lt;/math&gt;
where  &lt;math&gt;N_p&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;N_n&lt;/math&gt; are the numbers of protons and neutrons and &lt;math&gt;{\varepsilon_F}_p&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;{\varepsilon_F}_n&lt;/math&gt; are their [[fermi energy|Fermi energies]]. Since the latter are proportional to &lt;math&gt;{N_p}^{2/3}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{N_n}^{2/3}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, one gets
:&lt;math&gt;E_k = C (N_p^{5/3} + N_n^{5/3})&lt;/math&gt; for some constant ''C''.
The leading expansion in the difference &lt;math&gt;N_n - N_p&lt;/math&gt; is then 
:&lt;math&gt;E_k = {C\over 2^{2/3}} \left((N_p+N_n)^{5/3} + {5\over 9}{(N_n-N_p)^2 \over (N_p+N_n)^{1/3}}\right) + O((N_n-N_p)^2).&lt;/math&gt;
At the zeroth order expansion the kinetic energy is just the [[Fermi energy#Nucleus|Fermi energy]] &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_F\equiv {\varepsilon_F}_p = {\varepsilon_F}_n&lt;/math&gt; multiplied by &lt;math&gt;{3\over 5}(N_p+N_n)^{2/3}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we get
:&lt;math&gt;E_k = {3\over 5}\varepsilon_F (N_p+N_n)+ {1\over 3}\varepsilon_F {(N_n-N_p)^2 \over (N_p+N_n)} + O((N_n-N_p)^4)
= {3\over 5}\varepsilon_F A+ {1\over 3}\varepsilon_F {(A-2Z)^2 \over A} + O((A-2Z)^4).&lt;/math&gt;

The first term contributes to the volume term in the semi-empirical mass formula, and the second term is minus the asymmetry term (remember the kinetic energy contributes to the total binding energy with a ''negative'' sign).

&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_F&lt;/math&gt; is 38 [[MeV]], so  calculating &lt;math&gt;a_A&lt;/math&gt; from the equation above, we get only half the measured value. The discrepancy is explained by our model not being accurate: nucleons in fact interact with each other, and are not spread evenly across the nucleus. For example, in the [[Nuclear shell model|shell model]], a proton and a neutron with overlapping [[wavefunction]]s will have a greater [[strong interaction]] between them and stronger binding energy. This makes it energetically favourable (i.e. having lower energy) for protons and neutrons to have the same quantum numbers (other than [[isospin]]), and thus increase the energy cost of asymmetry between them.

One can also understand the asymmetry term intuitively, as follows. It should be dependent on the [[absolute difference]] &lt;math&gt;|N - Z|&lt;/math&gt;, and the form &lt;math&gt;(A - 2Z)^{2}&lt;/math&gt; is simple and [[Derivative|differentiable]], which is important for certain applications of the formula.  In addition, small differences between ''Z'' and ''N'' do not have a high energy cost.  The ''A'' in the denominator reflects the fact that a given difference &lt;math&gt;|N - Z|&lt;/math&gt; is less significant for larger values of ''A''.

===Pairing term===

[[File:Pairing term nuclear physics.gif|thumb|300 px|Magnitude of the pairing term in the total binding energy for even-even and odd-odd nuclei, as a function of mass number. Two fits are shown (blue and red line). The pairing term (positive for even-even and negative for odd-odd nuclei) was derived from the binding energy data in: G. Audi et al., 'The AME2012 atomic mass evaluation', in Chinese Physics C 36 (2012/12) pp. 1287–1602.]]

The term &lt;math&gt;\delta(A,Z)&lt;/math&gt; is known as the ''pairing term'' (possibly also known as the pairwise interaction).  This term captures the effect of [[Spin (physics)|spin]]-coupling.  It is given by:&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book |last=Krane |first=K. |year=1988 |title=Introductory Nuclear Physics |pages=68 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |isbn=0-471-85914-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\delta(A,Z) = \begin{cases} +\delta_{0} &amp; Z,N \text{ even } (A \text{ even}) \\ 0 &amp; A \text{ odd} \\ -\delta_{0} &amp; Z,N \text{ odd } (A \text{ even})\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta_0&lt;/math&gt; is found empirically to have a value of about 1000 keV, slowly decreasing with mass number&amp;nbsp;''A''. The dependence on mass number is commonly parametrized as
:&lt;math&gt;\delta_0 = {a_P}{A^{k_P}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The value of the exponent ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''P''&lt;/sub&gt; is determined from experimental binding energy data. In the past its value was often assumed to be&amp;nbsp;−3/4, but modern experimental data indicate that a value of&amp;nbsp;−1/2 is nearer the mark:
:&lt;math&gt;\delta_0 = {a_P}{A^{-1/2}}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\delta_0 = {a_{P}\prime}{A^{-3/4}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Due to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] the nucleus would have a lower energy if the number of protons with spin up were equal to the number of protons with spin down. This is also true for neutrons. Only if both ''Z'' and ''N'' are even can both protons and neutrons have equal numbers of spin up and spin down particles. This is a similar effect to the asymmetry term.

The factor &lt;math&gt;A^{k_P}&lt;/math&gt; is not easily explained theoretically. The Fermi ball calculation we have used above, based on the liquid drop model&lt;!-- Was Self-redirect! --&gt; but neglecting interactions, will give an &lt;math&gt;A^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; dependence, as in the asymmetry term. This means that the actual effect for large nuclei will be larger than expected by that model. This should be explained by the interactions between nucleons; For example, in the [[nuclear shell model|shell model]], two protons with the same quantum numbers (other than [[Spin (physics)|spin]]) will have completely overlapping [[wavefunction]]s and will thus have greater [[strong interaction]] between them and stronger binding energy. This makes it energetically favourable (i.e. having lower energy) for protons to form pairs of opposite spin. The same is true for neutrons.

==Calculating the coefficients==

The coefficients are calculated by fitting to experimentally measured masses of nuclei. Their values can vary depending on how they are fitted to the data. Several examples are as shown below, with units of megaelectronvolts.

The semi-empirical mass formula provides a good fit to heavier nuclei, and a poor fit to very light nuclei, especially [[helium-4|&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He]].  This is because the formula does not consider the internal [[Nuclear shell model|shell structure]] of the nucleus.  For light nuclei, it is usually better to use a model that takes this structure into account.

==Examples for consequences of the formula==
By maximizing ''E&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''(''A'',''Z'') with respect to ''Z'', we find the best neutrons to protons ratio ''N/Z'' for a given atomic weight ''A''.&lt;ref name=Rohlf /&gt;
We get 
:&lt;math&gt;N/Z \approx 1 + \frac{a_C}{2a_A} A^{2/3}.&lt;/math&gt;
This is roughly 1 for light nuclei, but for heavy nuclei the ratio grows in good agreement with [[periodic table|nature]].

By substituting the above value of ''Z'' back into ''E&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' one obtains the binding energy as a function of the atomic weight, ''E&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''(''A'').
Maximizing ''E&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''(''A'')/''A'' with respect to ''A'' gives the nucleus which is most strongly bound, i.e. most stable. The value we get is ''A'' = 63 ([[copper]]), close to the [[Iron#Isotopes|measured values]] of ''A'' = 62 ([[nickel]]) and ''A'' = 58 ([[iron]]).

'''Soapstone''' (also known as '''steatite''' or '''soaprock''') is a [[talc]]-[[schist]], which is a type of [[metamorphic rock]].  It is largely composed of the mineral [[talc]], thus is rich in [[magnesium]].  It is produced by dynamothermal [[metamorphism]] and [[metasomatism]], which occur in the zones where [[tectonic plates]] are [[subduction|subducted]], changing rocks by heat and pressure, with influx of fluids, but without melting. It has been a medium for carving for thousands of years.

==Petrology==
[[Image:Talc block.jpg|thumb|right|A block of talc ]]
[[Petrology|Petrologically]], soapstone is composed dominantly of talc, with varying amounts of [[chlorite group|chlorite]] and [[amphibole]]s (typically [[tremolite]], [[anthophyllite]], and [[cummingtonite]], hence its obsolete name, magnesiocummingtonite), and trace to minor iron-chromium [[oxide]]s.  It may be [[schist]]ose or [[Crystal habit|massive]].  Soapstone is formed by the metamorphism of [[Ultramafic rock|ultramafic]] [[protolith]]s (''e.g.'' [[dunite]] or [[serpentinite]]) and the [[metasomatism]] of siliceous [[dolostone]]s.

By mass, "pure" steatite is roughly 63.37% [[silica]], 31.88% [[Magnesium oxide|magnesia]], and 4.74% water.&lt;ref name=Handbook&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Anthony, John W. |editor2=Bideaux, Richard A. |editor3=Bladh, Kenneth W. |editor4=Nichols, Monte C. |title= Handbook of Mineralogy|publisher= Mineralogical Society of America|place= Chantilly, VA, US|url=http://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/doclib/hom/talc.pdf|format=PDF|chapter=Talc|isbn=0962209716 |volume=II (Silica, Silicates)|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; It commonly contains minor quantities of other oxides such as CaO or Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Pyrophyllite]], a mineral very similar to talc, is sometimes called soapstone in the generic sense, since its physical characteristics and industrial uses are similar,&lt;ref name="Virta"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Virta |first1=Robert L. |title=Minerals Yearbook Metals and Minerals 2010 |publisher=Government Printing Office |page=75.1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zyKCNW0BHm8C&amp;lpg=SA23-PA7&amp;ots=gyGGzisJbZ&amp;dq=%22Domestic%20survey%20data%20and%20tables%20were%20prepared%20by%20Raymond%20I.%20Eldridge%20III%2C%20statistical%20assistant%2C%20and%20the%20world%20production%20table%20was%20prepared%20by%20Glenn%20J.%20Wallace%2C%20international%20data%20coordinator.%22&amp;pg=SA75-PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=TALC%20AND%20PYROPHYLLITE&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because it is also commonly used as a carving material. However, this mineral typically does not have such a soapy feel as soapstone.

==Physical characteristics==

Soapstone is relatively soft because of its high talc content, talc having a definitional value of 1 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness scale]]. Softer grades may feel similar to [[soap]] when touched, hence the name. No fixed hardness is given for soapstone because the amount of talc it contains varies widely, from as little as 30% for architectural grades such as those used on countertops, to as much as 80% for carving grades.

Soapstone is often used as an [[Electrical insulation|insulator]] for housing and electrical components, due to its durability and electrical characteristics and because it can be pressed into complex shapes before firing. Soapstone undergoes transformations when heated to temperatures of 1000–1200°C into [[enstatite]] and [[cristobalite]]; in the Mohs scale, this corresponds to an increase in hardness to 5.5–6.5.&lt;ref&gt;"Some Important Aspects of the Harappan Technological Tradition," Bhan KK, Vidale M and Kenoyer JM, in ''Indian Archaeology in Retrospect''/edited by S. Settar and Ravi Korisettar, Manohar Press, New Delhi, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Historical uses===
[[File:Idi-ilum Louvre AO 19486 n01.jpg|thumb|upright|The 21st-century BC [[statue of Iddi-Ilum]] of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] is made of soapstone.]]

Ancient Egyptian [[Scarab (artifact)|Scarab]] signet/amulets were most commonly made from glazed steatite.&lt;ref name=aldred&gt;{{cite book |last=Aldred |first=Cyril |date=1971 |title=Jewels of the Pharaohs Egyptian Jewellery of the Dynastic Period |publisher=Thames and Hudson |pages=160-161 |isbn=0500231389}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Soapstone is used for inlaid designs, sculpture, [[beermat|coasters]], and kitchen [[countertop]]s and sinks.  The [[Inuit]] often used soapstone for traditional carvings. Some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes and bands make bowls, cooking slabs, and other objects from soapstone; historically, this was particularly common during the Late [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic archaeological period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Kenneth E. Sassaman| title = Early Pottery in the Southeast: Tradition and Innovation in Cooking Technology| date = 1993-03-30| publisher = University Alabama Press| isbn = 978-0-8173-0670-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Locally quarried soapstone was used for gravemarkers in 19th century northeast [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], US, around [[Dahlonega, Georgia|Dahlonega]], and [[Cleveland, Georgia|Cleveland]], as simple field stone and "slot and tab" tombs.

Vikings hewed soapstone directly from the stone face, shaped it into cooking pots, and sold these at home and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Else Rosendahl, ''The Vikings'', The Penguin Press, 1987, page 105&lt;/ref&gt;

Soapstone is sometimes used for construction of fireplace surrounds, cladding on [[wood-burning stoves]],&lt;ref name=sfnm&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.santafenewmexican.com/life/home/there-s-a-stove-for-every-taste/article_6ad9bf86-cbbb-5d31-88f0-34c1a6c1238b.html |title=There's a stove for every taste |date=2017-11-05 |accessdate=2017-12-14 |work=[[The Santa Fe New Mexican]] |author= Weideman, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wapo&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/home/the-enduring-appeal-of-wood-stoves/2017/01/17/b08c2698-d690-11e6-9f9f-5cdb4b7f8dd7_story.html |title=The enduring appeal of wood stoves |date=2017-01-19 |accessdate=2017-12-14 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |author=Damrosch, Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as the preferred material for woodburning masonry heaters because it can absorb, store, and evenly radiate heat due to its high density and magnesite (MgCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) content.  It is also used for countertops and bathroom tiling because of the ease of working the material and its property as the "quiet stone".  A weathered or aged appearance occurs naturally over time as the patina is enhanced.

The ancient trading city of [[Tepe Yahya]] in southeastern Iran was a center for the production and distribution of soapstone in the fifth to third millennia BC.&lt;ref&gt;"Tepe Yahya," ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 2004. Britannica Concise Encyclopedia. 3 January 2004, [http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9380473/Tepe-Yahya Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used in [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Crete]].  At the Palace of [[Knossos]], [[archaeological]] recovery has included a magnificent [[libation]] table made of steatite.&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan (2007) [http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10854/knossos.html#fieldnotes "Knossos Fieldnotes"], ''The Modern Antiquarian''&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Yoruba people]] of West Nigeria used soapstone for several statues, most notably at [[Esie]], where archaeologists have uncovered hundreds of male and female statues about half of life size. The Yoruba of [[Ife]] also produced a miniature soapstone obelisk with metal studs called superstitiously "the staff of [[Oranmiyan]]".

===Modern uses===
Soapstone has been used in India for centuries as a medium for carving.  Mining to meet worldwide demand for soapstone is threatening the habitat of India's tigers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,982537,00.html |title=West's love of talc threatens India's tigers|publisher=|accessdate=2007-01-09| work=The Guardian| location=London| first=Antony| last=Barnett| date=2003-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazil, especially in [[Minas Gerais]], due to the abundance of soapstone mines in that Brazilian state, local artisans still craft objects from that material, including pots and pans, wine glasses, statues, jewel boxes, coasters, and vases. These handicrafts are commonly sold in street markets found in cities across the state. Some of the oldest towns, notably [[Congonhas]], [[Tiradentes]], and [[Ouro Preto]], still have some of their streets paved with soapstone from colonial times.

Some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] use soapstone for [[Smoking pipe (tobacco)|smoking pipe]]s; numerous examples have been found among artifacts of different cultures and are still in use today.  Its low heat conduction allows for prolonged smoking without the pipe heating up uncomfortably.&lt;ref&gt;Witthoft, J.G., 1949, "Stone Pipes of the Historic Cherokees", ''Southern Indian Studies'' 1(2):43–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some wood-burning stoves make use of soapstone to take advantage of its useful thermal and fire-resistant properties.&lt;ref name=sfnm/&gt;&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt;

Soapstone is also used to carve [[Seal (East Asia)|Chinese seals]].

Currently, soapstone is most commonly used for architectural applications, such as counter tops, floor tiles, showerbases, and interior surfacing. 

The active North American soapstone mines include one south of Quebec City with products marketed by Canadian Soapstone, the Treasure and Regal mines in Beaverhead County, Montana mined by the Barretts Minerals Company,  and another in Central Virginia operated by the Alberene Soapstone Company. Architectural soapstone is mined in Canada,  Brazil, India, and Finland and imported into the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soapstone gives countertops, tiles a look that’s both new and old|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/realestate/soapstone-gives-countertops-tiles-a-look-thats-both-new-and-old/2013/05/30/48f500c2-bc1d-11e2-89c9-3be8095fe767_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=2014-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Welding|Welders]] and [[Fabrication (metal)|fabricators]] use soapstone as a marker due to its resistance to heat; it remains visible when heat is applied. It has also been used for many years by seamstresses, carpenters, and other craftsmen as a marking tool because its marks are visible and not permanent.

Soapstone can be used to create molds for [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]] objects from soft metals, such as [[pewter]] or [[silver]].  The soft stone is easily carved and is not degraded by heating.  The slick surface of soapstone allows the finished object to be easily removed.

Soapstones can be put in a freezer and later used in place of ice cubes to chill alcoholic beverages without diluting. Sometimes called whiskey stones, these were first introduced around 2007.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}  Most whiskey stones feature a semipolished finish, retaining the soft look of natural soapstone, while others are highly polished.

Steatite [[ceramic]]s are low-cost biaxial [[porcelain]]s of nominal composition (MgO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Royalty Minerals |url=http://www.royaltyminerals.in |website=www.royaltyminerals.in |accessdate=26 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steatite is used primarily for its [[dielectric]] and thermal insulating properties in applications such as tile, substrates, washers, bushings, beads, and pigments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Superior Technical Ceramics |url=http://www.ceramics.net |accessdate=26 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used for high-voltage insulators, which have to stand large mechanical loads, e.g. insulators of [[mast radiator]]s.

== Safety ==
People can be exposed to soapstone in the workplace by breathing it in, skin contact, or eye contact. 

===United States===
The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]  has set the legal limit ([[permissible exposure limit]]) for soapstone exposure in the workplace as 20 million particles per cubic foot over an 8-hour workday. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] of 6&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; total exposure and 3&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 3000&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, soapstone is [[IDLH|immediately dangerous to life and health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards - Soapstone (containing less than 1% quartz)|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0558.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Single bubble cropped.jpg|right|thumb|Single-bubble sonoluminescence – a single, cavitating bubble.]]'''Sonoluminescence''' is the emission of short bursts of light from [[Implosion (mechanical process)|imploding]] [[Liquid bubble|bubble]]s in a liquid when excited by sound.

==History==
The sonoluminescence effect was first discovered at the [[University of Cologne]] in 1934 as a result of work on [[sonar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Single Bubble Sonoluminsescence|journal= Aps Northwest Section Meeting Abstracts|pages= D1.007|author= Farley, Jennifer; Hough, Shane|date=2003|bibcode=2003APS..NWS.D1007F}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[H. Frenzel]] and [[H. Schultes]] put an ultrasound [[transducer]] in a tank of photographic [[developer fluid]]. They hoped to speed up the development process. Instead, they noticed tiny dots on the film after developing and realized that the bubbles in the fluid were emitting light with the ultrasound turned on.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} It was too difficult to analyze the effect in early experiments because of the complex environment of a large number of short-lived bubbles. (This experiment is also ascribed to N.&amp;nbsp;Marinesco and J.&amp;nbsp;J. Trillat in 1933, which also credits them with independent discovery). This phenomenon is now referred to as multi-bubble sonoluminescence (MBSL).

In 1960 Dr. Peter Jarman from Imperial College of London proposed the most reliable theory of SL phenomenon. The collapsing bubble generates an imploding shock wave that compresses and heats the gas at the center of the bubble to extremely high temperature.

In 1989 an experimental advance was introduced by [[D. Felipe Gaitan]] and [[Lawrence Crum]], who produced stable single-bubble sonoluminescence (SBSL).{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} In SBSL, a single bubble trapped in an acoustic standing wave emits a pulse of light with each compression of the bubble within the [[standing wave]]. This technique allowed a more [[system]]atic study of the [[phenomenon]], because it isolated the complex effects into one stable, predictable bubble. It was realized that the temperature inside the bubble was hot enough to melt [[steel]], as seen in an experiment done in 2012; the temperature inside the bubble as it collapsed reached about 12,000 [[kelvin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ndiaye|first=Abdoul Aziz|last2=Pflieger|first2=Rachel|last3=Siboulet|first3=Bertrand|last4=Molina|first4=John|last5=Dufrêche|first5=Jean-François|last6=Nikitenko|first6=Sergey I.|date=2012-05-24|title=Nonequilibrium vibrational excitation of OH radicals generated during multibubble cavitation in water|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry A|volume=116|issue=20|pages=4860–4867|doi=10.1021/jp301989b|issn=1520-5215|pmid=22559729|bibcode=2012JPCA..116.4860N}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in sonoluminescence was renewed when an inner [[temperature]] of such a bubble well above one million [[kelvin]]s was postulated.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} This temperature is thus far not conclusively proven; rather, recent experiments conducted by the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] indicate temperatures around {{convert|20000|K|C F}}.&lt;ref name=Illinois/&gt;

==Properties==
[[Image:Sonoluminescence.jpg|right|thumb|Long exposure image of multi-bubble sonoluminescence created by a high-intensity [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] horn immersed in a beaker of liquid]]

Sonoluminescence can occur when a sound wave of sufficient intensity induces a gaseous cavity within a liquid to collapse quickly. This cavity may take the form of a pre-existing bubble, or may be generated through a process known as [[cavitation]]. Sonoluminescence in the laboratory can be made to be stable, so that a single bubble will expand and collapse over and over again in a periodic fashion, emitting a burst of light each time it collapses. For this to occur, a standing acoustic wave is set up within a liquid, and the bubble will sit at a pressure [[anti-node]] of the standing wave. The [[frequency|frequencies]] of [[resonance]] depend on the shape and size of the container in which the bubble is contained.

Some facts about sonoluminescence: {{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}
* The light flashes from the bubbles last between 35 and a few hundred [[picosecond]]s long, with peak intensities of the order of 1–{{val|10|ul=mW}}.
* The bubbles are very small when they emit the light—about 1 [[micrometre]] in diameter—depending on the ambient fluid (e.g., water) and the gas content of the bubble (e.g., [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric air]]).
* Single-bubble sonoluminescence pulses can have very stable periods and positions. In fact, the frequency of light flashes can be more stable than the rated frequency stability of the oscillator making the sound waves driving them. However, the stability analyses of the bubble show that the bubble itself undergoes significant geometric instabilities, due to, for example, the [[Bjerknes force]]s and [[Rayleigh–Taylor instability|Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities]].
* The addition of a small amount of [[noble gas]] (such as [[helium]], [[argon]], or [[xenon]]) to the gas in the bubble increases the intensity of the emitted light.

Spectral measurements have given bubble temperatures in the range from {{val|2300|u=K}} to {{val|5100|u=K}}, the exact temperatures depending on experimental conditions including the composition of the liquid and gas.&lt;ref name=flannigan&gt;{{cite journal

Writing in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', chemists [[David J. Flannigan]] and [[Kenneth S. Suslick]] describe a method of determining temperatures based on the formation of [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]]. Using argon bubbles in [[sulfuric acid]], their data show the presence of ionized molecular oxygen O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [[sulfur monoxide]], and atomic argon populating high-energy excited states, which confirms a hypothesis that the bubbles have a hot plasma core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=David J. Flannigan  |author2=Kenneth S. Suslick |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Plasma formation and temperature measurement during single-bubble cavitation|journal=Nature|volume=434|pages=52–55|year=2005|doi=10.1038/nature03361|pmid=15744295|issue=7029|bibcode = 2005Natur.434...52F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ionization]] and [[Excited state|excitation]] energy of [[Ozonide|dioxygenyl]] [[cations]], which they observed, is 18 [[electronvolt]]s. From this they conclude the core temperatures reach at least 20,000 kelvins.&lt;ref name=Illinois&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.illinois.edu/news/05/0302bubbles.html |title=Temperature inside collapsing bubble four times that of sun &amp;#124; Archives &amp;#124; News Bureau &amp;#124; University of Illinois |publisher=News.illinois.edu |date=2005-02-03 |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rayleigh–Plesset equation==
:{{main|Rayleigh–Plesset equation}}
The dynamics of the motion of the bubble is characterized to a first approximation by the Rayleigh–Plesset equation (named after [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]] and [[Milton S. Plesset|Milton Plesset]]):

:&lt;math&gt;R\ddot{R} + \frac{3}{2}\dot{R}^{2} = \frac{1}{\rho}\left(p_g - P_0 - P(t) - 4\mu\frac{\dot{R}}{R} - \frac{2\gamma}{R}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

This is an approximate equation that is derived from the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] (written in [[spherical coordinate system]]) and describes the motion of the radius of the bubble ''R'' as a function of time ''t''. Here, ''μ'' is the [[viscosity]], ''p'' the [[pressure]], and ''γ'' the [[surface tension]]. The over-dots represent time derivatives. This equation, though approximate, has been shown to give good estimates on the motion of the bubble under the [[acoustics|acoustically]] driven field except during the final stages of collapse.  Both simulation and experimental measurement show that during the critical final stages of collapse, the bubble wall velocity exceeds the speed of sound of the gas inside the bubble.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley P. Barber and Seth J. Putterman, "Light Scattering Measurements of the Repetitive Supersonic Implosion of a Sonoluminescing Bubble", Phys Rev Lett 69, 3839-3842 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a more detailed analysis of the bubble's motion is needed beyond Rayleigh–Plesset to explore the additional energy focusing that an internally formed shock wave might produce.

==Mechanism of phenomenon==
{{main|Mechanism of sonoluminescence}}
The mechanism of the phenomenon of sonoluminescence is unknown. [[Hypothesis|Hypotheses]] include: hotspot, [[Bremsstrahlung|bremsstrahlung radiation]], collision-induced radiation and [[corona discharge]]s, [[nonclassical light]], [[Quantum tunnelling|proton tunneling]], [[electrodynamic]] [[Jet (fluid)|jets]] and [[fractoluminescence|fractoluminescent jets]] (now largely discredited due to contrary experimental evidence).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[Image:Sonoluminescence.png|center|600px|thumb|From left to right: apparition of bubble, slow expansion, quick and sudden contraction, emission of light]]

In 2002, M. Brenner, S. Hilgenfeldt, and D. Lohse published a 60-page review that contains a detailed explanation of the mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prola.aps.org/abstract/RMP/v74/i2/p425_1?"Single bubble sonoluminescence" (''Reviews of Modern Physics'' 74, 425)]&lt;/ref&gt; An important factor is that the bubble contains mainly inert noble gas such as argon or xenon (air contains about 1% argon, and the amount dissolved in water is too great; for sonoluminescence to occur, the concentration must be reduced to 20–40% of its equilibrium value) and varying amounts of [[water vapor]]. Chemical reactions cause [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] to be removed from the bubble after about one hundred expansion-collapse cycles. The bubble will then begin to emit light.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v80/i4/p865_1?"Evidence for Gas Exchange in Single-Bubble Sonoluminescence", Matula and Crum, ''Phys. Rev. Lett.'' 80 (1998), 865-868)]&lt;/ref&gt; The light emission of highly compressed noble gas is exploited technologically in the [[argon flash]] devices.

During bubble collapse, the inertia of the surrounding water causes high pressure and high temperature, reaching around 10,000 kelvins in the interior of the bubble, causing the ionization of a small fraction of the noble gas present. The amount ionized is small enough for the bubble to remain transparent, allowing volume emission; surface emission would produce more intense light of longer duration, dependent on [[wavelength]], contradicting experimental results. Electrons from ionized atoms interact mainly with neutral atoms, causing thermal bremsstrahlung radiation. As the wave hits a low energy trough, the pressure drops, allowing electrons to [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombine]] with atoms and light emission to cease due to this lack of free electrons. This makes for a 160-picosecond light pulse for argon (even a small drop in temperature causes a large drop in ionization, due to the large [[ionization energy]] relative to photon energy). This description is simplified from the literature above, which details various steps of differing duration from 15 microseconds (expansion) to 100 picoseconds (emission).

Computations based on the theory presented in the review produce radiation parameters (intensity and duration time versus wavelength) that match experimental results{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} with errors no larger than expected due to some simplifications (e.g., assuming a uniform temperature in the entire bubble), so it seems the phenomenon of sonoluminescence is at least roughly explained, although some details of the process remain obscure.

Any discussion of sonoluminescence must include a detailed analysis of metastability. Sonoluminescence in this respect is what is physically termed a bounded phenomenon meaning that the sonoluminescence exists in a bounded region of parameter space for the bubble; a coupled magnetic field being one such parameter. The magnetic aspects of sonoluminescence are very well documented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v77/i23/p4816_1?"Sonoluminescence in High Magnetic Fields, J.B. Young, T. Schiemedel and Woowan Kang" (''Physical Review Letters'' 77, 4816)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other proposals===

====Quantum explanations====
An unusually exotic hypothesis of sonoluminescence, which has received much popular attention, is the Casimir energy hypothesis suggested by noted physicist [[Julian Schwinger]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infinite-energy.com/iemagazine/issue1/colfusthe.html |title=Within article "Cold Fusion: A History of Mine" |publisher=Infinite-energy.com |date=1989-03-23 |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more thoroughly considered in a paper by [[Claudia Eberlein]]&lt;ref&gt;Phys. Rev. Lett. 76, 3842–3845 (1996); https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9506024v1&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[University of Sussex]]. Eberlein's paper suggests that the light in sonoluminescence is generated by the vacuum within the bubble in a process similar to [[Hawking radiation]], the radiation generated at the [[event horizon]] of [[black hole]]s. According to this vacuum energy explanation, since quantum theory holds that vacuum contains [[virtual particle]]s, the rapidly moving interface between water and gas converts virtual photons into real photons. This is related to the [[Unruh effect]] or the [[Casimir effect]]. The argument has been made that sonoluminescence releases too large an amount of energy and releases the energy on too short a time scale to be consistent with the vacuum energy explanation,&lt;ref&gt;K.A. Milton, "Dimensional and dynamical aspect of the
Casimir effect: understanding the reality and significance
of vacuum energy", hep-th/0009173 (2000) https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0009173&lt;/ref&gt; although other credible sources argue the vacuum energy explanation might yet prove to be correct.&lt;ref&gt;S.Liberati, F.Belgiorno, Matt Visser, "Comment on ``Dimensional and dynamical aspects of the Casimir effect: understanding the reality and significance of vacuum energy''", hep-th/0010140v1 (2000) https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0010140v1&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nuclear reactions====
{{main|Bubble fusion}}
Some have argued that the Rayleigh–Plesset equation described above is unreliable for predicting bubble temperatures and that actual temperatures in sonoluminescing systems can be far higher than 20,000 kelvins.

This possibility is sometimes referred to as [[bubble fusion]] and is likened to the implosion design used in the fusion component of [[thermonuclear weapon]]s.

On January 27, 2006, researchers at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] claimed to have produced fusion in sonoluminescence experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.rpi.edu/luwakkey/1322 |title=RPI: News &amp; Events – New Sonofusion Experiment Produces Results Without External Neutron Source |publisher=News.rpi.edu |date=2006-01-27 |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/01/060130155542.htm |title=Using Sound Waves To Induce Nuclear Fusion With No External Neutron Source |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=2006-01-31 |accessdate=2012-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments in 2002 and 2005 by [[Rusi Taleyarkhan|R. P. Taleyarkhan]] using deuterated [[acetone]] showed measurements of [[tritium]] and neutron output consistent with fusion.

==Biological sonoluminescence==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Optical phenomenon]] --&gt;
[[Alpheidae|Pistol shrimp]] (also called ''snapping shrimp'') produce a type of sonoluminescence from a collapsing bubble caused by quickly snapping its claw. The animal snaps a specialized claw shut to create a cavitation bubble that generates acoustic pressures of up to 80 kPa at a distance of 4&amp;nbsp;cm from the claw. As it extends out from the claw, the bubble reaches speeds of 60 miles per hour (97&amp;nbsp;km/h) and releases a sound reaching 218 decibels. The pressure is strong enough to kill small fish. The light produced is of lower intensity than the light produced by typical sonoluminescence and is not visible to the naked eye. The light and heat produced may have no direct significance, as it is the shockwave produced by the rapidly collapsing bubble which these shrimp use to stun or kill prey. However, it is the first known instance of an animal producing light by this effect and was whimsically dubbed "shrimpoluminescence" upon its discovery in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Nature | volume = 413 | pages = 477–478 | year = 2001 | doi = 10.1038/35097152 | title = Snapping shrimp make flashing bubbles |author1=Detlef Lohse, Barbara Schmitz  |author2=Michel Versluis  |lastauthoramp=yes | pmid = 11586346 | issue = 6855|bibcode = 2001Natur.413..477L }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has subsequently been discovered that another group of crustaceans, the [[mantis shrimp]], contains species whose club-like forelimbs can strike so quickly and with such force as to induce sonoluminescent cavitation bubbles upon impact.&lt;ref name="Patek and Caldwell"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=S.

'''Surface runoff''' (also known as '''overland flow''') is the flow of [[water]] that occurs when excess [[stormwater]], [[meltwater]], or other sources flows over the [[Earth#Surface|Earth's surface]]. This might occur because [[soil]] is [[Surface runoff#Saturation excess overland flow|saturated]] to full capacity, because rain arrives [[Surface runoff#Infiltration excess overland flow|more quickly than soil can absorb]] it, or because [[wikt:impervious#Adjective|impervious]] areas ([[roof]]s and [[Road surface|pavement]]) send their runoff to surrounding soil that cannot absorb all of it. Surface runoff is a major component of the [[water cycle]]. It is the primary agent in [[Soil erosion#Rainfall and runoff|soil erosion by water]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronnie Wilson, ''The Horton Papers'' (1933)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith Beven]], ''[[Robert E. Horton]]'s perceptual model of infiltration processes'', Hydrological Processes, Wiley Intersciences DOI 10:1002 hyp 5740 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Runoff that occurs on the ground surface before reaching a [[Channel (geography)|channel]] is also called a [[Nonpoint source pollution|nonpoint source]].  If a nonpoint source contains man-made contaminants, or natural forms of pollution (such as rotting leaves) the runoff is called [[nonpoint source pollution]].  A land area which produces runoff that drains to a common point is called a [[drainage basin]].  When runoff flows along the ground, it can pick up [[Soil contamination|soil contaminants]] including [[petroleum]], [[pesticide]]s, or [[fertilizer]]s that become [[discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] or nonpoint source pollution.&lt;ref&gt;L. Davis Mackenzie and Susan J. Masten, ''Principles of Environmental Engineering and Science'' {{ISBN|0-07-235053-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to causing water erosion and pollution, surface [[Urban runoff|runoff in urban areas]] is a primary cause of [[Flood#Urban flooding|urban flooding]] which can result in property damage, damp and mold in [[basements]], and street flooding.

==Generation== 
[[File:Runoffrazorback.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Surface runoff from a hillside after soil is saturated]] Surface runoff can be generated either by rainfall, snowfall or by the melting of snow, or glaciers.

[[Snowmelt|Snow]] and [[glacier]] melt occur only in areas cold enough for these to form permanently. Typically [[snowmelt]] will peak in the spring and glacier melt in the summer, leading to pronounced flow maxima in rivers affected by them. The determining factor of the rate of melting of snow or glaciers is both air temperature and the duration of sunlight. In high mountain regions, streams frequently rise on sunny days and fall on cloudy ones for this reason.

In areas where there is no snow, runoff will come from rainfall. However, not all rainfall will produce runoff because storage from soils can absorb light showers. On the extremely ancient soils of [[Australia]] and [[Southern Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;McMahon T.A. and Finlayson, B.; ''Global Runoff: Continental Comparisons of Annual Flows and Peak Discharges'' {{ISBN|3-923381-27-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[proteoid root]]s with their extremely dense networks of root hairs can absorb so much rainwater as to prevent runoff even when substantial amounts of rain fall. In these regions, even on less infertile [[Vertisol|cracking clay soils]], high amounts of rainfall and  potential evaporation are needed to generate any surface runoff, leading to specialised adaptations to extremely variable (usually ephemeral) streams.

===Infiltration excess overland flow===
[[File:Runoff and filtersoxx.ogv|thumb|446x446px|runoff and filter soxx]]
This occurs when the rate of [[rainfall]] on a surface exceeds the rate at which water can [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltrate]] the ground, and any depression storage has already been filled. This is called flooding excess overland flow, Hortonian overland flow (after [[Robert E. Horton]]), or unsaturated overland flow. This more commonly occurs in [[arid]] and [[semi-arid]] regions, where rainfall intensities are high and the [[soil]] [[infiltration capacity]] is reduced because of surface sealing, or in paved areas. This occurs largely in city areas where pavements prevent water from flooding.

===Saturation excess overland flow===
When the [[soil]] is saturated and the depression storage filled, and rain continues to fall, the rainfall will immediately produce surface runoff. The level of antecedent soil moisture is one factor affecting the time until soil becomes saturated. This runoff is called saturation excess overland flow, saturated overland flow or Dunne runoff.

===Antecedent soil moisture===
Soil retains a degree of moisture after a [[rainfall]]. This residual water moisture affects the soil's [[infiltration capacity]]. During the next rainfall event, the infiltration capacity will cause the soil to be saturated at a different rate. The higher the level of antecedent soil moisture, the more quickly the soil becomes saturated. Once the soil is saturated, runoff occurs.

===Subsurface return flow===
After water infiltrates the soil on an up-slope portion of a hill, the water may flow laterally through the soil, and exfiltrate (flow out of the soil) closer to a channel. This is called subsurface return flow or [[throughflow]].

As it flows, the amount of runoff may be reduced in a number of possible ways: a small portion of it may [[evapotranspiration|evapotranspire]]; water may become temporarily stored in microtopographic depressions; and a portion of it may [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltrate]] as it flows overland. Any remaining surface water eventually flows into a [[surface water|receiving water]] body such as a [[river]], [[lake]], [[estuary]] or [[ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, R. (2004). ''The Water Cycle.'' Minneapolis: Lerner. {{ISBN|0-8225-4596-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human influence==
[[File:View of urban runoff discharging to coastal waters.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Urban surface water runoff]]
[[Urbanization]] increases surface runoff by creating more [[impervious surface]]s such as [[pavement (roads)|pavement]] and buildings that do not allow [[percolation]] of the water down through the soil to the [[aquifer]]. It is instead forced directly into streams or [[storm drain|storm water runoff drains]], where [[erosion]] and [[siltation]] can be major problems, even when flooding is not. Increased runoff reduces [[groundwater]] recharge, thus lowering the [[water table]] and making [[drought]]s worse, especially for agricultural farmers and others who depend on the [[water well]]s.

When anthropogenic contaminants are dissolved or suspended in runoff, the human impact is expanded to create [[water pollution]]. This pollutant load can reach various receiving waters such as streams, rivers, lakes, estuaries and oceans with resultant water chemistry changes to these water systems and their related ecosystems.

A 2008 report by the [[United States National Research Council]] identified urban stormwater as a leading source of [[water quality]] problems in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;United States. National Research Council. Washington, DC. [http://www.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/nrc_stormwaterreport.pdf "Urban Stormwater Management in the United States."] October 15, 2008. pp. 18-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

As humans continue to alter the climate through the addition of [[greenhouse gases]] to the atmosphere, precipitation patterns are expected to change as the atmospheric capacity for water vapor increases. This will have direct consequences on runoff amounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Influences of precipitation changes and direct CO2 effects on streamflow|last = Wigley T.M.L &amp; Jones P.D|first = |date = 1985|journal = Letters to Nature|doi = |pmid = |url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v314/n6007/abs/314149a0.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of surface runoff==

===Erosion and deposition===
Surface runoff can cause [[erosion]] of the Earth's surface; [[sediment|eroded material]] may be [[deposition (geology)|deposited]] a considerable distance away. There are four main types of [[Erosion#Rainfall and runoff|soil erosion by water]]: splash erosion, sheet erosion, [[rill]] erosion and [[gully]] erosion. Splash erosion is the result of mechanical collision of raindrops with the soil surface: soil particles which are dislodged by the impact then move with the surface runoff. Sheet erosion is the overland transport of [[sediment]] by runoff without a well defined channel. Soil surface roughness causes may cause runoff to become concentrated into narrower flow paths: as these incise, the small but well-defined channels which are formed are known as [[rill]]s. These channels can be as small as one centimeter wide or as large as several meters. If runoff continue to incise and enlarge rills, they may eventually grow to become [[gully|gullies]]. Gully erosion can transport large amounts of eroded material in a small time period. 
{|align="right"
|[[File:Wassererosion Acker.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[Erosion#Rainfall and runoff|Soil erosion by water]] on intensively-tilled farmland.]]
|[[File:Fascine49.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Willow hedge strengthened with [[fascine]]s for the limitation of runoff, north of France.]]
|}
Reduced crop productivity usually results from erosion, and these effects are studied in the field of [[soil conservation]]. The soil particles carried in runoff vary in size from about .001 millimeter to 1.0 millimeter in diameter. Larger particles [[precipitate|settle]] over short transport distances, whereas small particles can be carried over long distances suspended in the [[water column]]. Erosion of silty soils that contain smaller particles generates [[turbidity]] and diminishes light transmission, which disrupts [[aquatic ecosystem]]s.

Entire sections of countries have been rendered unproductive by erosion. On the high central [[plateau]] of [[Madagascar]], approximately ten percent of that country's land area, virtually the entire landscape is devoid of [[vegetation]], with erosive gully furrows typically in excess of 50 meters deep and one kilometer wide.  [[Shifting cultivation]] is a farming system which sometimes incorporates the [[slash and burn]] method in some regions of the world. Erosion causes loss of the fertile top soil and reduces its fertility and quality of the agricultural produce.

Modern industrial [[farming]] is another major cause of erosion. In some areas in the American [[corn belt]], more than 50 percent of the original [[topsoil]] has been carried away within the last 100 years.

===Environmental effects===
The principal environmental issues associated with runoff are the impacts to surface water, [[groundwater]] and [[soil]] through transport of water pollutants to these systems. Ultimately these consequences translate into human health risk, ecosystem disturbance and aesthetic impact to water resources. Some of the contaminants that create the greatest impact to surface waters arising from runoff are [[petroleum]] substances, [[herbicide]]s and [[fertilizer]]s. Quantitative uptake by surface runoff of pesticides and other contaminants has been studied since the 1960s, and early on contact of pesticides with water was known to enhance [[phytotoxicity]].&lt;ref&gt;W.F. Spencer, ''Distribution of Pesticides between Soil, Water and Air'', International symposium on Pesticides in the Soil, February 25–27, 1970, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of surface waters, the impacts translate to [[water pollution]], since the streams and rivers have received runoff carrying various chemicals or sediments. When surface waters are used as [[drinking water|potable water]] supplies, they can be compromised regarding [[risk assessment|health risks]] and drinking water [[aesthetics]] (that is, odor, color and [[turbidity]] effects). Contaminated surface waters risk altering the metabolic processes of the aquatic [[species]] that they host; these alterations can lead to death, such as [[fish kill]]s, or alter the balance of populations present. Other specific impacts are on animal mating, spawning, [[Egg (biology)|egg]] and [[larva]]e viability, juvenile survival and plant productivity.  Some researches show surface runoff of pesticides, such as [[DDT]], can alter the gender of fish species genetically, which transforms male into female fish.&lt;ref&gt;''Science News.'' [http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/160/title/DDT_treatment_turns_male_fish_into_mothers "DDT treatment turns male fish into mothers."] 2000-02-05. (By subscription only.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Surface runoff occurring within forests can supply lakes with high loads of mineral nitrogen and phosphorus leading to [[eutrophication]]. Runoff waters within [[Temperate coniferous forest|coniferous forests]] are also enriched with [[humic acid]]s and can lead to [[Humus|humification]] of water bodies &lt;ref&gt;Klimaszyk Piotr, Rzymski Piotr "Surface Runoff as a Factor Determining Trophic State of Midforest Lake" Polish Journal of Environmental Studies, 2011, 20(5), 1203-1210&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, high standing and young islands in the tropics and subtropics can undergo high soil erosion rates and also contribute large material fluxes to the coastal ocean. Such land derived runoff of sediment nutrients, carbon, and contaminants can have large impacts on global biogeochemical cycles and marine and coastal ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Renee K. Takesue,Curt D. Storlazzi. Sources and dispersal of land-based runoff from small Hawaiian drainages to a coral reef: Insights from geochemical signatures. Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science Journal. 2/13/17&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the case of groundwater, the main issue is contamination of drinking water, if the [[aquifer]] is abstracted for human use. Regarding [[soil contamination]], runoff waters can have two important pathways of concern. Firstly, runoff water can extract soil contaminants and carry them in the form of water pollution to even more sensitive aquatic habitats. Secondly, runoff can deposit contaminants on pristine soils, creating health or ecological consequences.

====Agricultural issues====

The other context of agricultural issues involves the transport of agricultural chemicals (nitrates, phosphates, pesticides, herbicides etc.) via surface runoff. This result occurs when chemical use is excessive or poorly timed with respect to high precipitation. The resulting contaminated runoff represents not only a waste of agricultural chemicals, but also an environmental threat to downstream ecosystems.

===Flooding===
[[Flood]]ing occurs when a watercourse is unable to convey the quantity of runoff flowing downstream. The frequency with which this occurs is described by a [[return period]]. Flooding is a natural process, which maintains ecosystem composition and processes, but it can also be altered by [[land use]] changes such as river engineering. Floods can be both beneficial to societies or cause damage. Agriculture along the [[Nile]] floodplain took advantage of the seasonal flooding that deposited nutrients beneficial for crops. However, as the number and susceptibility of settlements increase, flooding increasingly becomes a natural hazard. In urban areas, surface runoff is the primary cause of urban flooding, known for its repetitive and costly impact on communities.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Neighborhood Technology, Chicago IL [http://www.cnt.org/media/CNT_PrevalenceAndCostOfUrbanFlooding.pdf “The Prevalence and Cost of Urban Flooding.”] May 2013 &lt;/ref&gt; Adverse impacts span loss of life, property damage, contamination of water supplies, loss of crops, and social dislocation and temporary homelessness. Floods are among the most devastating of natural disasters.

==Mitigation and treatment==
[[File:North-Bend-Uplands-Runoff-pond-3942.jpg|thumb|right|Runoff holding ponds (Uplands neighborhood of [[North Bend, Washington]])]]
Mitigation of adverse impacts of runoff can take several forms:

* [[Land use]] development controls aimed at minimizing [[impervious surface]]s in urban areas
* [[Erosion]] controls for [[farm]]s and [[construction]] sites
* Flood control and retrofit programs, such as [[green infrastructure]] 
* Chemical use and handling controls in [[agriculture]], [[landscape maintenance]], industrial use, etc.

'''Land use controls.''' Many world regulatory agencies have encouraged research on methods of minimizing total surface runoff by avoiding unnecessary [[hardscape]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). [http://www.epa.gov/ATHENS/research/impervious/ "Impervious Cover."] Ecosystems Research Division, Athens, GA. 2009-02-24. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509130718/http://www.epa.gov/ATHENS/research/impervious/ |date=May 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many municipalities have produced guidelines and codes ([[zoning]] and related [[Local ordinance|ordinances]]) for [[land developer]]s that encourage minimum width sidewalks, use of [[paving stone (flooring)|pavers]] set in earth for [[driveway]]s and [[walkway]]s and other design techniques to allow maximum water [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] in urban settings. An example land use control program can be seen in the city of [[Santa Monica, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://santa-monica.org/epd/residents/Urban_Runoff/urban.htm Urban Runoff], City of [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] website. Retrieved 29 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Further|Low-impact development (Canada/US)}} {{Further|Rainwater harvesting}}

'''Erosion controls''' have appeared since medieval times when farmers realized the importance of contour farming to protect soil resources. Beginning in the 1950s these agricultural methods became increasingly more sophisticated. In the 1960s some [[U.S. state|state]] and [[local government]]s began to focus their efforts on mitigation of construction runoff by requiring builders to implement [[erosion control|erosion]] and [[sediment control]]s (ESCs).  This included such techniques as: use of [[straw bale]]s and barriers to slow runoff on slopes, installation of [[silt fence]]s, programming construction for months that have less rainfall and minimizing extent and duration of exposed graded areas. [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], [[Maryland]] implemented the first local government sediment control program in 1965, and this was followed by a statewide program in Maryland in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Maryland Department of Environment. Baltimore, MD. [http://mdspe.org/2007_SSA_History.pdf "Erosion and Sediment Control and Stormwater Management in Maryland."] 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912203809/http://mdspe.org/2007_SSA_History.pdf |date=September 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flood control programs''' as early as the first half of the twentieth century became quantitative in predicting peak flows of [[riverine]] systems. Progressively strategies have been developed to minimize peak flows and also to reduce channel velocities. Some of the techniques commonly applied are: provision of holding ponds (also called [[detention basin]]s) to buffer riverine peak flows, use of energy dissipators in channels to reduce stream velocity and land use controls to minimize runoff.&lt;ref&gt;''Channel Stability Assessment for Flood Control Projects'' [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], (1996) {{ISBN|0-7844-0201-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Chemical]] use and handling.''' Following enactment of the U.S. [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (RCRA) in 1976, and later the [[Clean Water Act|Water Quality Act of 1987]], states and cities have become more vigilant in controlling the containment and storage of toxic chemicals, thus preventing releases and leakage. Methods commonly applied are: requirements for double containment of [[underground storage tank]]s, registration of [[hazardous materials]] usage, reduction in numbers of allowed pesticides and more stringent regulation of fertilizers and herbicides in landscape maintenance. In many industrial cases, pretreatment of wastes is required, to minimize escape of pollutants into [[sanitary sewer|sanitary]] or [[storm sewer|stormwater sewers]].

The U.S. [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA) requires that local governments in [[urbanized areas]] (as defined by the [[Census Bureau]]) obtain [[stormwater]] discharge permits for their drainage systems.&lt;ref&gt;United States. ''Code of Federal Regulations'', [http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_07/40cfr122_07.html 40 CFR 122.26]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPA. Washington, D.C.  [http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/munic.cfm "Stormwater Discharges From Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4s)."] 2009-03-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially this means that the locality must operate a [[Stormwater#Stormwater management|stormwater management]] program for all surface runoff that enters the municipal separate [[storm sewer]] system ("MS4"). EPA and state regulations and related publications outline six basic components that each local program must contain:
* Public education (informing individuals, households, businesses about ways to avoid stormwater pollution)
* Public involvement (support public participation in implementation of local programs)
* Illicit discharge detection &amp; elimination (removing [[sanitary sewer]] or other non-stormwater connections to the MS4)
* [[Construction]] site runoff controls (i.e. erosion &amp; sediment controls)
* Post-construction (i.e. permanent) stormwater management controls
* [[Pollution prevention]] and "good housekeeping" measures (e.g. system maintenance).
Other property owners which operate storm drain systems similar to municipalities, such as state highway systems, universities, military bases and prisons, are also subject to the MS4 permit requirements.

==Measurement and mathematical modeling==
Runoff is analyzed by using [[mathematical model]]s in combination with various [[water quality]] sampling methods. Measurements can be made using continuous automated water quality analysis instruments targeted on pollutants such as specific [[organic compound|organic]] or [[inorganic chemical]]s, [[pH]], turbidity etc. or targeted on secondary indicators such as [[dissolved oxygen]]. Measurements can also be made in batch form by extracting a single water sample and conducting any number of chemical or physical tests on that sample.

In the 1950s or earlier [[hydrology transport model]]s appeared to calculate quantities of runoff, primarily for flood forecasting. Beginning in the early 1970s computer models were developed to analyze the transport of runoff carrying water pollutants, which considered [[Solvation|dissolution]] rates of various chemicals, [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] into soils and ultimate pollutant load delivered to [[surface water|receiving waters]].
One of the earliest models addressing chemical dissolution in runoff and resulting transport was developed in the early 1970s under contract to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Hogan, Leda Patmore, Gary Latshaw, Harry Seidman et al. Computer modeling of pesticide transport in soil for five instrumented watersheds, [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] Southeast Water laboratory, Athens, Ga. by [[ESL Inc.]], Sunnyvale, California (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[computer model]] formed the basis of much of the mitigation study that led to strategies for [[land use]] and chemical handling controls.

Other computer models have been developed (such as the [[DSSAM Model]]) that allow surface runoff to be tracked through a river course as reactive water pollutants. In this case the surface runoff may be considered to be a [[line source]] of [[water pollution]] to the receiving waters.

The tangie plays a major role in the Shetland legend of Black Eric, a sheep rustler. The tangie he rode gave him supernatural assistance when he raided and harassed surrounding [[crofts]]. In his final battle with crofter Sandy Breamer, Black Eric fell to his death in the sea. The tangie then continued to terrorize the area, particularly the young women he was hoping to abduct.{{sfnp|Lamont-Brown|1996|p=84|ps=none}}

The TIP instruments were designed and built by the [[US Naval Research Laboratory|US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL)]] and are a part of the [[Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate|COSMIC]] program.

==Operation==
Although each TIP instrument is fairly simple in design and operation, the value of this instrument is that six of them were launched at once, and they observe the earth simultaneously from three orbital planes spaced equally apart around the earth. The data of this instrument when combined with the data from the other COSMIC payloads allows a 3D tomographic analysis of the Earth's ionosphere to be performed.

The '''Union of International Associations''' ('''UIA''') is a [[non-profit organization|non-profit]] [[non-governmental organization|non-governmental]] research institute and documentation center based in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], and operating under [[United Nations]] mandate. It was founded in 1907 under the name [[Central Office of International Associations]] by [[Henri La Fontaine]],  the 1913 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate, and [[Paul Otlet]], a founding father of what is now called [[information science]].

The UIA is an independent research institute and a repository for current and historical information on the work of global [[civil society]]. It serves two main purposes: to document and promote public awareness of the work of [[Yearbook of International Organizations|international organizations]] (both [[International nongovernmental organization|INGOs]] and [[Intergovernmental organizations|IGOs]]), [[International Congress Calendar|international meetings]], and [[Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential|world problems]]. The UIA also supports and facilitates the work of international associations through training and networking opportunities.

It has consultative status with [[ECOSOC]] and [[UNESCO]].

==Aims==

* Facilitate the development and efficiency of nongovernmental networks in every field of human activity – especially non-profit and voluntary associations – considered to be essential components of contemporary society
* Collect, research and disseminate information on international bodies, both governmental and nongovernmental, their interrelationships, their meetings, and the problems and strategies with which they are concerned
* Experiment with meaningful and action-oriented ways of presenting such information to enable these initiatives to develop and counterbalance each other creatively, and act as a catalyst for the emergence of new forms of associative activity and international co-operation
* Promote research on the legal, administrative and other problems common to these international associations, especially in their contacts with governmental bodies
* Contribute to a universal order based on principles of human dignity, solidarity of peoples and freedom of association and communication

==History==
The two founders started work setting up the Central Office of International Organisations and then conducting a survey of international organisations with headquarters in Belgium. Then with the help of the sociologist [[Cyril van Overbergh]] they extend this research to organisations based elsewhere.&lt;ref name="WELIS"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rayward |first1=W.

Şüräle closely resembles other similar characters from the folklore such as [[Archura|Arçuri]] of the [[Chuvashes]], [[Pitsen]] (Picen) of the [[Siberian Tatars]] and Yarımtıq of the Ural [[Tatars]].

==Description==
He can shapeshift into many different forms. As a human, he looks like a peasant with glowing eyes, and his shoes are on backwards. A person who befriends Şüräle can learn the secrets of magic. Farmers and shepherds would make pacts with the [[leshy]] to protect their crops and sheep. Şüräle has many tricks, including leading peasants astray, making them sick, or tickling them to death.&lt;ref&gt;Türk Mitolojisi Ansiklopedik Sözlük, Celal Beydili, Yurt Yayınevi (Page - 531)&lt;/ref&gt; They are also known to hide the axes of woodcutters. A person gets lost in the woods when a Şüräle crosses their path. To find the way out, you have to turn your clothes inside out and wear shoes on opposite feet.

Inspired by the Tatar folklore, [[Ghabdulla Tuqay]] wrote a poem ''Şüräle''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050101/http://kitapxane.noka.ru/authors/tuqay/shurale Şüräle], Ğabdulla Tuqay, 1907&lt;/ref&gt; Şüräle was Tuqay's [[pseudonym]]. The first{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Tatar ballet by [[Farit Yarullin]] had its name after ''Şüräle''.
