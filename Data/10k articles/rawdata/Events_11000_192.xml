The '''[[World Figure Skating Championships]]''' is an annual [[figure skating competition]] sanctioned by the [[International Skating Union]] in which [[figure skating|figure skaters]] compete for the title of World Champion. The first competition took place on 9 February 1896, in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russian Empire]].

In 1895, the International Skating Union organized the first World Figure Skating Championships committee, which consisted of 5 people. This committee was entrusted with preparation and presentation of the figure skating rules. ISU also confirmed that World Figure Skating Championships will be held and that in the meantime men skaters should comply with the rules not yet published.&lt;ref&gt;Absalyamova I.

===District councils===
In 123 districts one third of the council was up for election.

A further 20 councils had passed a resolution under section 7 (4) (b) of the [[Local Government Act 1972]], requesting a system of elections by thirds. They could do so because they had had their new ward boundaries introduced at the 1983 elections.

__NOTOC__
Year '''478 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Mamercus and Structus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 276 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 478 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

==== Greece ====
* Despite [[Sparta]]n opposition, [[Athens]] is refortified as well as rebuilt after the [[Persia]]n destruction of the city.
* With the help of the Athenian statesman and general, [[Cimon]], [[Aristides]] commands an Athenian fleet of 30 ships that the Spartan commander [[Pausanias (general)|Pausanias]] leads to free the Greek cities on [[Cyprus]] and capture [[Byzantium]] from the Persians and their [[Phoenicia]]n allies.
* While Pausanias is occupying Byzantium, his arrogance and his adoption of Persian clothing and manners offends the allies and raises suspicions of disloyalty. Pausanias is recalled to [[Sparta]], where he is tried and acquitted of the charge of treason, but he is not restored to his command.

The '''Alaska State Fair''' is an annual [[state fair]] held in [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]], [[Alaska]], United States. The fairgrounds are located approximately one hour north of Anchorage and draw visitors from the entire [[Municipality of Anchorage]] and beyond for the popular 1 and ½ week event beginning at the end of August. The fair is famous for its record setting giant vegetables and picturesque location at the foot of the [[Chugach Mountains]] in the [[Matanuska-Susitna Valley]]. The event features amusement rides, food concessions, competitive exhibits, carnival games, live performances and more.

==History==
The first Alaska State Fair was held September 4–7, 1936. It was organized by members of the [http://www.grange.org/northlandpioneerak1/2012/04/17/hello-world/ Northland Pioneer Grange No. 1], an agricultural fraternal organization, that was organized in the Matanuska Valley in 1933.  Planning for the Fair began in 1935 and coincided with establishment of the Matanuska Colony, a New Deal resettlement community designed to assist out of work Midwestern families.&lt;ref&gt;https://scholarworks.alaska.edu/handle/11122/8947&lt;/ref&gt;  In establishing a colony in the [[Matanuska-Susitna Valley]] it was the U.S. government's intent to decrease Alaska's reliance on imported food, increase the Territory's population, and give Midwestern families on public assistance a new start.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.alaskastatefair.org/aboutus/history.html |title=Alaska State Fair History Website |access-date=September 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803121740/http://www.alaskastatefair.org/aboutus/history.html |archive-date=August 3, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

That first year’s Fair was held in the community center of the newly established Matanuska Colony and included the crowning of the Fair queen, a baby show, boxing matches, horse races, dances, a [[rodeo]] and baseball games. There were also agricultural entries, including giant cabbages, grain, carrots, onions, celery, peas and other vegetables.&lt;ref name="programs"&gt;[http://consortiumlibrary.org/archives/FindingAids/ephemeralist.html  Matanuska Valley Fair Association programs; 1937–1958. EPH-0054]&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, the Fair took a five-year hiatus from 1942 to 1946. But the Fair was back in operation in 1947. 1950 saw the first carnival rides at the Fair. In 1956, the Fair Board petitioned the [[Alaska Legislature]] for official designation as the Alaska State Fair. In 1960, the Fair celebrated its 25th anniversary and was paid a visit by President [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;[http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/Archives/Reference+Desk/Speeches/JFK/JFK+Pre-Pres/1960/002PREPRES12SPEECHES_60SEP21c.htm John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

1967 was the Fair’s first year in its present 300-acre location at 2075 Glenn Highway in [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]]. The total attendance that year reached 72,000. Over the years, Fair attendance has continued its upward trend. During the 18-day Fair in 1998, a record 361,804 people participated in the event.&lt;ref name="fairfacts"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.alaskastatefair.org/aboutus/fairfacts.html |title=State Fair History Website – Fair Facts |access-date=September 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329092118/http://www.alaskastatefair.org/aboutus/fairfacts.html |archive-date=March 29, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the Fair accepted 10,890 exhibit entries – the highest on record. The Fair set another record in 2003, with 312,419 visitors attending the Fair over a 12-day period.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

Fairground facilities have also continued to grow. In 1975, the Fair became home to Colony Village, which preserves some of the historic buildings from the Valley’s early days. In 1997, the construction of Pioneer Plaza and Raven Hall was completed. In 2004, the Fair opened its new Green Gate and Railroad Depot.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

In 2010, it was estimated a total of 290,119 people attended the Fair, which featured 8,081 exhibit entries and 450 vendors.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

Also in 2010, Valley resident and protester Sidney Hill was arrested for fourth-degree assault, disorderly conduct and trespassing after he caused a disturbance on the fairgrounds while carrying a large political sign. The incident was addressed on the Fair blog,&lt;ref name="Sidney Hill"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.alaskastatefair.org/blog/archives/555 |title=ASF blog archive |access-date=August 4, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630101311/http://www.alaskastatefair.org/blog/archives/555 |archive-date=June 30, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent articles regarding Mr. Hill’s activities were published in the [[Anchorage Daily News]]&lt;ref name="ADN"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.adn.com/2011/07/12/1964289/palmers-no-1-sign-waver-in-trouble.html |title=Anchorage Daily News |access-date=August 4, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715155608/http://www.adn.com/2011/07/12/1964289/palmers-no-1-sign-waver-in-trouble.html |archive-date=July 15, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and The [[Frontiersman]].&lt;ref name="The Frontiersman"&gt;[http://frontiersman.com/articles/2011/07/03/opinion/editorials/doc4e096e00e5171325416381.txt The Frontiersman]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attractions==
Situated in the heart of the fertile  [[Matanuska-Susitna Valley]], the Fair features giant vegetable exhibits, like 2010’s pending world record-breaking 46-foot (14 m), 8-inch (20 cm) gourd vine, and the state record-breaking 39-inch (100 cm) bean, 83-inch (210 cm) gourd and 1,101-pound (500 kg) pumpkin.

The Fair’s giant cabbage contest tradition began in 1941, when a $25 prize was offered for the largest cabbage and Max Sherrod of the Valley took the prize with a 23 pounder (10.5 kg). The official Giant [[Cabbage]] Weigh-Off was established in 1995. In 2012, grower Scott Robb entered a 138.25 pound (63 kg) cabbage, which not only took first place, but also set a new world record.&lt;ref name="news"&gt;https://www.npr.org/2012/09/04/160562400/alaska-man-rolls-record-cabbage-out-of-the-patch&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the Fair’s flowers and gardens received some national recognition, when the makers of the Public Broadcasting Service program [[GardenSMART]] visited the Fair to film a 30-minute segment.&lt;ref name="GardenSMART"&gt;[http://www.gardensmart.tv/pages.php?page=episodes&amp;subpage=2007_show27 GardenSMART show archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

Topping the list of fairgoer favorites is Fair food. Nearly 70 food vendors are scheduled to attend the 2011 Fair, offering staples like hot dogs, pizza, burgers and nachos, to more exotic selections including gyros, Alaska seafood and all kinds of food on a stick, to desserts like ice cream, cream puffs and more. More than 400 non-food vendors are also present at the Fair each year.&lt;ref name="survey"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.alaskastatefair.org/pdfs/State%20Fair%20Report%20Final.pdf |title=Alaska State Fair: Household Opinion Survey, May 2010 |access-date=September 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612215908/http://alaskastatefair.org/pdfs/State%20Fair%20Report%20Final.pdf |archive-date=June 12, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Criminal law}}

'''Attempted murder''' is a crime of [[attempt]] in various jurisdictions.

==Canada==
Section 239 of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|''Criminal Code'']] makes attempted murder punishable by a maximum of [[Life imprisonment in Canada|life imprisonment]]. If a gun is used, the [[Mandatory sentencing|minimum sentence]] is four, five or seven years, dependent on prior convictions and relation to [[organized crime]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-239.html#docCont ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 239.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==

===England and Wales===

In English [[criminal law]], attempted murder is the crime of simultaneously preparing to commit an [[unlawful killing]] and having a [[specific intent]]ion to cause the death of a human being under the [[Queen's Peace]].{{clarify|date=January 2016}} The phrase "more than merely preparatory" is specified by the [[Criminal Attempts Act 1981]] to denote the fact that preparation for a crime by itself does not constitute an "attempted crime".

In [[England and Wales]], as an "[[attempt]]", attempted murder is an offence under section 1(1) of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 and is an [[indictable offence]] which carries a maximum penalty of [[life imprisonment]] (the same as the mandatory sentence for murder). The corresponding legislation for [[Northern Ireland]] is section 3(1) of the [[Criminal Attempts and Conspiracy (Northern Ireland) Order 1983]] (No.1120 (N.I.13)).

The ''[[mens rea]]'' (''[[Latin]]'' for the "guilty mind") for murder includes an intention to kill or cause [[grievous bodily harm]] where there is virtual certainty of death resulting, whereas attempted murder depends on an intention to kill and an overt act towards committing homicide. Attempted murder is only the planning of a murder and acts taken towards it, not the actual killing, which is the murder.  This makes the offence very difficult to prove and it is more common for a lesser charge to be preferred under the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]].

However, in ''R v Morrison'' [2003] 1 WLR 1859, the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] considered the issue of [[lesser included offense|alternative verdicts]] on an indictment with a single count of attempted murder. Morrison had gone into a shop with two other men on  a robbery with a firearm. They demanded money and one of the men shot at the shopkeeper who suffered only minor injury. The prosecution had many opportunities to add other counts before the [[trial (law)|trial]] but failed to act. Having heard the case, the [[judge]] expressed his view that the [[jury]] could consider an attempted [[grievous bodily harm]] (GBH) under section 18 of the 1861 Act and Morrison was duly convicted of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm. The Court of Appeal confirmed that attempting to cause grievous bodily harm is a valid alternative to attempted murder because there can be no intention to kill someone without the intention also to cause grievous bodily harm.

This is a practical decision to ensure that the criminal justice system did not allow a guilty person to walk away because only one charge had been preferred. But it is not necessarily a good general principle{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} because, in [[euthanasia]] for example, a person assisting intends to cause death, but with no suffering. That attempting to cause grievous bodily harm must be an alternative verdict should the intended victim not die would be a strange outcome because there is no intention to cause any long-lasting and serious injury: the two attempted offences have different ''mens rea'' requirements so that proof of intent to murder would not necessarily meet the requirement for section 18 of the 1861 Act.

First, acting deliberately and intentionally or recklessly with extreme disregard for human life, the person attempted to kill someone; and the person did something that was a substantial step toward committing the crime. [Mere preparation is not a substantial step toward committing a crime.]

====Proof of ''mens rea''====
{{Main|Mens rea}}
There must be more than merely preparatory acts and, although the defendant may threaten death, this may not provide convincing [[evidence (law)|evidence]] of an intention to kill unless the words are accompanied by relevant action, e.g. finding and picking up a weapon and making serious use of it, or making a serious and sustained physical attack without a weapon.

====Duress, necessity and marital coercion====

The defences of [[Duress in English law|duress]] and [[Necessity in English law|necessity]] are not available to a person charged with attempted murder. Conversely, the statutory defence of [[marital coercion]] is, on the face of the statute, available to a wife charged with attempted murder.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice Act 1925]] (15 &amp; 16 Geo.5 c.86), section 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1945]] (c.15)(N.I.), section 37&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
Prior to 1967, [[Offences against the Person Act 1861#Attempts to murder|sections 11 to 15 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861]] created a number of offences of attempting to commit murder by various specified means (ss.11 to 14), and an offence of attempting to commit murder by any means not specified in those offences (s.15).

After the repeal of these offences by the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]], attempted murder was allowed to subsist at [[common law]] until the enactment of the 1981 Act.

===Scotland===

Attempted murder is a crime at [[common law]] in Scotland. Attempted murder is the same as the offence of murder in Scottish law with the only difference being that the victim has not died.&lt;ref&gt;Cawthorne v HMA, 1968 JC 32, 36 per LJ-G Clyde.&lt;/ref&gt; The offence of murder was defined in [[Drury v HM Advocate]]:

{{Cquote|[M]urder is constituted by any wilful act causing the destruction of life, by which the perpetrator either wickedly intends to kill or displays wicked recklessness as to whether the victim lives or dies.}}

Intention can be inferred from the circumstances of the case. Wicked recklessness is determined objectively&lt;ref&gt;Broadley v HMA, 1991 JC 108, 114 per LJ-C Ross.&lt;/ref&gt; and is "recklessness so gross that it indicates a state of mind which falls to be treated as wicked and depraved as the state of mind of a deliberate killer." &lt;ref&gt;Scott v HMA, 1996 JC 1, 5 (opinion of the court)&lt;/ref&gt; As with all common law offences in Scotland, the maximum punishment available is life imprisonment.

==United States==

In the [[United States]], attempted murder is an [[inchoate offense|inchoate crime]].  A conviction for attempted murder requires a demonstration of an intent to murder, meaning that the perpetrator either tried to murder and failed (e.g. attempted to shoot the victim and missed or shot the victim and the victim survived) or took a substantial step towards committing a murder (e.g. purchasing a gun or other deadly weapon and writing about his or her intent to kill).

The business model of this company usually involves sending promotional email to invite attendees and speakers, at the same time, registration fee will be provided based on different levels of speakers in relevant fields. Unlike traditional model of scientific congresses in which abstracts are usually submitted and [[peer reviewed]] before being accepted for presentation, speakers are guaranteed a speaking role as long as the attendance fees are paid. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The '''Battle of Harim (Harenc)''' was fought on 12 August 1164 near [[Artah (Medieval Town)|Artah]] between the forces of [[Nur ad-Din Zangi]] and a combined army from the [[County of Tripoli]], the [[Principality of Antioch]], the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Armenia]]. Nur ad-Din won a crushing victory, capturing most of the leaders of the opposing army.

==Background==
In 1163 King [[Amalric I of Jerusalem]] led an invasion of [[Egypt]], leaving the [[crusader state]]s open to attack from the east. Nur ad-Din took advantage of this to invade Tripoli, but he was taken by surprise by a large combination of enemies at the [[Battle of al-Buqaia]]{{sfn|Oldenbourg|1966|p=363}} and was almost killed himself. He then moved north to Antioch, with assistance from his brother [[Qutb ad-Din Mawdud|Qutb ad-Din]] in [[Mosul]], his other vassals from [[Aleppo]] and [[Damascus]], and the [[Ortoqid]]s of [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|the Jazira]], and besieged the fortress of Harim (Harenc) in 1164. As [[William of Tyre]] says, "he stationed his engines around it in the customary manner and began to assault the place with a fury which permitted the inhabitants no rest."

==Battle==
Reginald of Saint Valery, lord of Harim,{{sfn|Cawley|2012||loc=Lords of Harenc}} called for help, and [[Raymond III of Tripoli]], [[Bohemund III of Antioch]], and [[Joscelin III of Edessa]] arrived to relieve the siege. They were joined by [[Konstantinos Kalamanos]], the Byzantine governor of [[Cilicia]], and [[Thoros II of Armenia|Thoros]], and [[Mleh of Armenia]], as well as [[Hugh VIII of Lusignan]] and Geoffrey Martel, brother of [[William IV of Angoulême]], both of whom had recently arrived on [[pilgrimage]]. 

Nur ad-Din prepared to give up the siege when they arrived, but the crusaders, inspired by the victory at al-Buqaia, and, "regardless of the rules of military discipline ... recklessly dispersed and roved hither and yon in pursuit of the foe." Nur ad-Din's troops defended against their charge and led a counterattack, pushing the crusaders into a swamp, and they were massacred "like victims before the altar." 

It is possible that Nur ad-Din was only feigning a retreat in order to draw the crusaders into an ambush, but abandoning a siege when a relief army arrived was a standard tactic and Nur ad-Din presumably had no way of knowing the crusaders would follow him. William's assertion that this was a reckless move is further evidence of this. "Only the Armenian Thoros, who had forseen the Turkish maneuver and had not set off in pursuit, escaped from the disaster".{{sfn|Oldenbourg|1966|p=364}} Mleh also avoided capture. Konstantinos Kalamanos, Hugh, Raymond, Bohemund, and Joscelin were captured and imprisoned in Aleppo. According to [[Ibn al-Athir]], 10,000 crusaders were killed.

==Aftermath==
Nur ad-Din resumed the siege and captured Harim a few days later. With Amalric absent in Egypt, all three crusader states were now without their rulers, but Nur ad-Din did not want to attack [[Antioch]] itself for fear of provoking a Byzantine response, as the Principality was technically an Imperial fief. To his critics he replied, "I would rather have Bohemund as a neighbor than the King of the Greeks!".{{sfn|Oldenbourg|1966|p=364}} Nur ad-Din went on to besiege and capture [[Banias]]. Amalric abandoned Egypt and marched north with [[Thierry of Alsace]] to relieve Nur ad-Din's pressure on Antioch. Bohemund was released from captivity in 1165 but Raymond remained in prison until 1173.

'''Bride burning''' or '''bride-burning''' is a form of [[domestic violence]] practiced in countries located on or around the [[Indian subcontinent]]. A category of [[dowry death]], bride-burning occurs when a young woman is [[murder]]ed by her husband or his family for her family's refusal to pay additional dowry. The wife is typically doused with [[kerosene]], [[gasoline]], or other flammable liquid, and set alight, leading to [[Death by burning|death by fire]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ash |first=Lucy |title=India's dowry deaths |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/crossing_continents/3071963.stm |date=16 July 2003 |accessdate=30 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lakhani | first = Avnita | title = Bride-burning: the "elephant in the room" is out of control | journal = [[Pepperdine Dispute Resolution Law Journal]] | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 249–298 | publisher = [[Pepperdine University School of Law]] | date = 2005 | url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/pepds5&amp;div=14&amp;id=&amp;page= | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1103&amp;context=drlj pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Kerosene is most often used as the fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aishaiqbal.blogspot.com/2007/02/bride-burning.html |title=Aisha Iqbal: Bride Burning- in the name of dowry |publisher=Aishaiqbal.blogspot.com |date=8 February 2007 |accessdate=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most common in India and has been a major problem there since at least 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.cnn.com/1996-08-18/world/9608_18_bride.burn_1_dowry-hindu-attitudes?_s=PM:WORLD |title=Brideburning claims hundreds in India – CNN |publisher=Articles.cnn.com |date=18 August 1996 |accessdate=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Dowry deaths===
A [[dowry death]] is the death of a young woman in South Asian countries, primarily [[India]], who is murdered or driven to [[suicide]] by her husband. This results from the husband continually attempting to extract more dowry from the bride or her family. Bride burning is just one form of dowry death. Others include [[acid throwing]] and [[Eve teasing]]. Because dowry typically depends on class or socioeconomic status, women are often subjected to the dowry pressures of their future husband or his relatives.&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt;

===Origins of bride burning===
There are at least four perspectives on why bride burning came to be and how its existence has prevailed in South Asian nations, as detailed by Avnita Lakhani in her report on bride burning titled “The Elephant in the Room Is Out of Control". These theories describe practices that contributed to the rise of dowry as a whole, thus ultimately contributing to bride burning.

One of the more culturally-founded theories suggests that in a highly patriarchal society such as India, a woman’s role is defined from before she is born, which ultimately places her as lesser than men.&lt;ref name="Nangia"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Nangia | first = Anshu | title = Note: the tragedy of bride burning in India: how should the law address it? | journal = [[Brooklyn Journal of International Law]] | volume = 22 | pages = 637–694 | publisher = [[Brooklyn Law School]] | date = 1996–1997 | url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/bjil22&amp;div=31&amp;id=&amp;page | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=22+Brooklyn+J.+Int%27l+L.+637&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;key=6a3e2417a95ef12fac702ce6549e7ea1 Lexis Nexis.]&lt;/ref&gt; Because she is seen as a burden and an "extra mouth to feed",&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt; her status as an economic liability promotes the idea that men, who are considered physical assets, can treat women as subservient.&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt; Once a woman marries, she is bound to her husband and his will because “society mandates obedience to her husband".&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nangia"/&gt;

Another theory claims that consumerism, a primarily Western ideal that is newly founded in developing nations, has caused countries like India to become greedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pardee | first = Laurel Remers | title = The dilemma of dowry deaths: domestic disgrace or international human rights catastrophe | journal = [[James E. Rogers College of Law|Arizona Journal of International and Comparative Law]] | volume = 13 | pages = 491–522 | publisher = [[James E.

Lakhani also suggests that, historically speaking, it has been noted that the dowry system may have been conceived as a way to distinguish Muslim from Hindu culture,&lt;ref name="Nangia"/&gt; creating a further divide within [[castes]]. A higher dowry would indicate a higher status and distinction from Islam, thus providing an incentive to demand a larger dowry.&lt;ref name="Nangia"/&gt;

Finally, some scholars argue that the dowry practice came out of British rule and influence in India in order to distinguish "different forms of marriage" between castes.&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt; When the dowry system was established within the higher castes, the British government sought to reinforce it in the lower castes as a means to eradicate their more ritualised marriages.&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt; Such forms of union were discredited until only upper caste marriage systems were recognised.&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt;

===In India===

Dr. Ashley K. Jutla, MD and [[David Heimbach]] describe bride burning by saying that "the husband and/or in-laws have determined that the dowry, a gift given from the daughter's parents to the husband, was inadequate and therefore attempt to murder the new bride to make the husband available to remarry or to punish the bride and her family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jutla | first1 = Rajni K. | last2 = Heimbach | first2 = David | title = Love burns: an essay about bride burning in India | journal = Journal of Burn Care &amp; Rehabilitation | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 165–170 | publisher = [[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]] | pmid = 15091143 | date = March–April 2004 | url = http://journals.lww.com/burncareresearch/Abstract/2004/03000/Love_Burns__An_Essay_about_Bride_Burning_in_India.5.aspx | ref = harv | postscript = . | doi=10.1097/01.bcr.0000111929.70876.1f}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, dowry size is a reflection of wealth. The Indian author Rajesh Talwar has written a play on dowry deaths titled 'The Bride Who Would Not Burn.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Rajesh Talwar | url = https://www.amazon.com/author/rajeshtalwar | website = amazon.com | publisher = [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, the Government of India passed the Dowry Prohibition Act, making the dowry demands in wedding arrangements illegal.&lt;ref name="Act"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 | url = http://www.wcd.nic.in/dowryprohibitionact.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150909082421/http://www.wcd.nic.in/dowryprohibitionact.htm | website = wcd.nic.in | publisher = [[Ministry of Women and Child Development (India)]]  | date = 20 May 1961 | archive-date = 9 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the Indian Parliament added dowry deaths as a new [[domestic violence]] crime. According to the new section 304-B of the Indian Penal Code, where a bride "within 7 years of her marriage is killed and it is shown that soon before her death, she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband, or any relative of her husband, or in connection with any demand for dowry, such death shall be called 'dowry death' and such husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused her death."&lt;ref name="Act" /&gt;

The offenders can be sentenced for any period, from a minimum of seven years in prison to a maximum of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | contribution = Annex C: Legal framework surrounding domestic violence in India | editor-last1 = Johnson | editor-first1 = Cate | title = Domestic violence in India: recommendations of the women's rights team: report to USAID/India PROWID | date = October 1996 | pages = 28–42 |display-editors=etal}} (Explaining section 304-B of the Indian Penal Code.)&lt;/ref&gt; Many cases of dowry-related domestic violence, suicides, and murders have been reported. A 1997 report claimed that at least 5000 women die each year because of dowry deaths and at least a dozen die each day in 'kitchen fires' thought to be intentional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Kitchen fires kill Indian brides with inadequate dowry | publisher = [[United Press International|UPI]] | location = New Delhi, India | date = 23 July 1997 }} [http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/52a/033.html Extract.]&lt;/ref&gt; About 30 percent of reported dowry deaths result in convictions in courts.&lt;ref name=ncrb/&gt;

===In Pakistan===
In Pakistan, the Progressive Women's Association says that 300 women are burned to death each year by their husband's families and that bride burning incidents are sometimes disguised as accidents, such as an 'exploding stove'.&lt;ref name="BBC_1999"/&gt;  According to the Association, doctors say that victims presenting from these accidents have injuries inconsistent with stove burns.&lt;ref name="BBC_1999"&gt;{{cite news

In 1988, a survey showed that 800 women were killed in this manner; in 1989, the number rose to 1100, and in 1990 it stood at 1800 estimated killings. Newspapers in [[Lahore]] in a six-month period (1997) reported on average 15 attacks a month.&lt;ref name=Jilani&gt;{{citation | last = Jilani | first = Hina | contribution = Violence against women: the legal system and institutional responses in Pakistan | editor-last1 = Goonesekere | editor-first1 = Savitri | editor-last2 = Ahmed | editor-first2 = Eman M. | title = Violence, law and women's rights in South Asia |page=161 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | location = New Delhi Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780761997962 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=QWUKUF1MAu8C&amp;pg=PA161 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to an estimate by Human Development in South Asia, on average there are 16 cases of bride burnings a month.&lt;ref name="Ajmal 2012-04-25"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ajmal|first=Umer Bin|title=Domestic violence|newspaper=Dawn|date=25 April 2012|url=http://dawn.com/2012/04/25/domestic-violence-2/|accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Women's eNews]] reported 4000 women attacked in this manner in [[Islamabad]]'s surroundings over an eight-year period and that the average age range of victims is between 18 and 35 with an estimated 30 percent being pregnant at the time of death.&lt;ref name=Terzieff /&gt; [[Shahnaz Bukhari]] has said of such attacks &lt;blockquote&gt;Either Pakistan is home to possessed stoves which burn only young housewives, and are particularly fond of genitalia, or looking at the frequency with which these incidences occur there is a grim pattern that these women are victims of deliberate murder.&lt;ref name=Terzieff&gt;{{cite news | last = Terzieff | first = Juliette | title = Pakistan's fiery shame: women die in stove deaths | url = http://womensenews.org/story/domestic-violence/021027/pakistans-fiery-shame-women-die-stove-deaths | work = [[Women's eNews]] | date = 27 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; According to the Progressive Women's Association such attacks are a growing problem and in 1994 on [[International Women's Day]] announced that various NGOs would join to raise awareness of the issue.&lt;ref name=Rappaport&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Rappaport | editor-first = Helen | title = Encyclopedia of women social reformers, volume 1 | page = 115 | publisher = ABC-CLIO | location = Santa Barbara, California | year = 2001 | isbn = 9781576071014 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other nations==
Occasionally, bride burning happens among resettled Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities in other parts of the world, including the United States.

===In the United States===
Aleyamma  Mathew was a registered nurse at a hospital in [[Carrollton, Texas]], who died of burn wounds on 5 April 1992.&lt;ref name="jthomasniu.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Parameswaran | first = Radhika | title = Coverage of "Bride Burning" in the "Dallas Observer": a cultural analysis of the "Other" | journal = [[Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies]] | volume = 16 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 69–100 | publisher = [[University of Nebraska Press]] via [[JSTOR]] | doi = 10.2307/3346804 | jstor = 3346804 | date = 1996 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3346804 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://jthomasniu.org/class/781/Assigs/otheriing111.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; She and her husband, Mathew Varughese, had immigrated from India two decades before and had three daughters in the United States.&lt;ref name="jthomasniu.org"/&gt;  The couple had been having marital problems since the late 1980s, which culminated in a fight that led to Aleyamma’s death.&lt;ref name="jthomasniu.org"/&gt;  She was found by her children, doused in gasoline and covered in flames, dying soon after.&lt;ref name="jthomasniu.org"/&gt;

Brief articles were run in the ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'' and ''[[The Atlanta-Journal Constitution]]'' after the incident, while the ''[[Dallas Observer]]'' ran a detailed, nine page article covering Aleyamma’s death.&lt;ref name="jthomasniu.org"/&gt; The article faced some criticism for its portrayal of non-Western countries as backward or inappropriate: “Battered by her husband, Aleyamma Mathew remained true to her culture. In the end she became its victim.”&lt;ref name="jthomasniu.org"/&gt;

==Controlling bride burning==
There are current governmental initiatives to criminalize bride burning and grassroots organizations working to combat the practice, as well as international laws working against human rights violations.&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt; Finally, there are many proposed initiatives in place to end bride burning globally.

===Governmental efforts===
In 1961, India enacted the Dowry Prohibition Act,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Greenberg | first = Judith G. | title = Criminalizing dowry deaths: the Indian experience | journal = Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 801–846 | publisher = [[American University]] | date = 2003 | url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/geoimlj7&amp;div=40&amp;id=&amp;page= | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1410&amp;context=jgspl Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; to halt dowry murders. It was amended in the early 1980s to “rectify several inherent weaknesses and loopholes”&lt;ref name="Nangia"/&gt; in order to make it a criminal offense if the husband or his relatives causes a woman to “die of burns or bodily injury or unnatural circumstances within seven years of the marriage and where there is evidence that she suffered cruelty and harassment in connection with the dowry.”&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt; Unfortunately, this particular law does not provide a comprehensive definition of dowry, which can change the way it is demanded and delivered. Ultimately, this allowed perpetrators more flexibility in the court of dowry death.&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt; The seven-year clause is equally problematic, as it simply allowed husbands to wait until that period ended to burn or otherwise cause the death of their bride.&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt;

Another major Indian law, the 1983 “Anti-Cruelty Statute", prohibits cruelty towards a wife and subjects the husband and/or in-laws to fines or imprisonment if they inflict cruelty upon the wife.&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt; However, the law is equally ambiguous, which results in inadequate enforcement of bride burning and dowry murders.&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt;

Article 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] declares the following: “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.”&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Universal Declaration of Human Rights | url = https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml | website = un.org | publisher = [[United Nations]] }} [http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Documents/UDHR_Translations/eng.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Article 5 proclaims: “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt;

===Non-governmental efforts===
In India, where most cases of bride burning are seen, domestic legislation is typically inadequately enforced. Because of this, grassroots organizations “have taken up the cause to halt bride burning". One example of this is government-funded family counseling center cells, in which the intended goal is to strengthen family ties and reduce legal intervention. However, often such cells only reinforce the stereotype of “women’s sharp tongues” and men’s power to “hit and beat.”&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt; Other similar counseling-style [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s have been developed in order to resolve such issues with similar consequences.&lt;ref name="Nangia"/&gt;

===Potential efforts===
Primarily, alternative initiatives resolve around reform of current flawed, failing laws. One proposal calls for the expansion of the protection for women under the international refugee law  in order to provide asylum to victims of gender discrimination or gendercide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Cipriani | first = Linda | title = Gender and persecution: protecting women under international refugee law | journal = Georgetown Immigration Law Journal | volume = 7 | pages = 511–548 | publisher = [[Georgetown University Law Center]] | date = 1993 | url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/geoimlj7&amp;div=39&amp;id=&amp;page= | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; One way this could be achieved would be by including women in the definition of a “persecuted social group”,&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt; which would allow their gender to seek international asylum under fear of dowry-related persecution globally.

In April 1984, European Parliament introduced a proposal that would “protect women from persecution on the basis of gender”&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt; by reforming international refugee laws.&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt; However, the proposal was rejected.

Another solution is to increase economic interest for women by establishing their [[Women's property rights|property rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gopal | first = Gita | title = Gender and economic inequality in India: the legal connection | journal = Boston College Third World Law Journal | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–86 | publisher = [[Boston College]] | date = 1993 | url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/bctw13&amp;div=7&amp;id=&amp;page= | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1280&amp;context=twlj Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Even when married, the bride has no rights over the property belonging to the husband while he is living.&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt; In giving women the right to own property, women would not need to marry for economic or legal purposes, thus disregarding the dowry practice.&lt;ref name="Bride Burning"/&gt;

'''Christ Church Regatta''' is a boat race in the [[University of Oxford]], [[England]], which is held annually during seventh week of [[Michaelmas term]] (late November), in which novice crews (of eight rowers with a cox) representing each [[college]], compete against each other.&lt;ref name="wolfson"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wolfsonrowing.org/category/racing/christchurch/ | title=Christ Church Regatta | publisher=[[Wolfson College Boat Club (Oxford)|Wolfson College Boat Club]] | date=2015 | accessdate=16 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are separate men's and women's races, with many colleges entering more than one crew. The regatta is organized by [[Christ Church Boat Club]].&lt;ref name="wolfson" /&gt;

==Course==
The regatta is held on the [[The Isis|Isis]], the stretch of the [[River Thames]] running through [[Oxford]], in [[Christ Church Meadow]] (the park in Oxford belonging to [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]). The stretch of the river that is used is generally familiar to novice crews as the stretch where they train. The course is only between about 500 and 750 metres long, from a part of the river between "Longbridges" and the start of the boathouse island to a finish line near the Head of the River pub by [[Folly Bridge]].{{fact|date=June 2017}}

==Racing==
The competition is run over about four days in total, usually from Wednesday of 7th week in Michaelmas Term to Saturday of 7th Week. Races are head-on-head between two teams that are chosen at random. The winner of the race will progress to the next round of races. The loser may be knocked out so that they no longer race. However, the loser of a first round race will enter the [[repechage]], meaning that they have the chance to stay in the competition. The knock-out rounds of the competition proceed until two teams are left to race against each other in the Final.

==Problems==
A regatta of novice crews has potential problems. During the course of the regatta, several races have to be stopped once they have started due to novice crews becoming stranded within the racing lanes. Also, at this time in Michaelmas Term, weather is often not especially agreeable. It is generally quite cold and often raining, with the result that the river can be higher and faster than is perhaps ideal. The regatta in 2006 had to be cancelled two days in because of the river's condition. The entire regatta was cancelled in 2000 and 2007 for the same reason. In 2012, some crews did get out for the first day but rapid stream and weather changes forced a cancellation of the regatta.{{fact|date=June 2017}}

'''Clayton James Cosgrove''' (born 31 October 1969) is a former New Zealand politician. He is a member of the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]].

==Early life==

Cosgrove was born in [[Nelson, New Zealand]]. He received a BA (Triple Major), in History, American Studies and Political Science, from the [[University of Canterbury]] in 1992 and received an [[MBA]] in 1996. Before entering politics, he worked in the Corporate Affair field within the Minerals and Telecommunications industries. He was also a small business owner.

==Labour Party involvement==

Cosgove has been a member of the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] since he was fourteen, and has held a number of posts within the party. He was chairman of the party's [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] branch from 1989 to 1994, and served as campaign manager to Labour Party leader [[Mike Moore (New Zealand politician)|Mike Moore]] in the [[New Zealand general election, 1990|1990 election]] and the [[New Zealand general election, 1993|1993 election]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

He was a strong supporter of Moore, and opposed Moore's replacement by [[Helen Clark]]. Before the [[New Zealand general election, 1996|1996 election]] he was involved in discussions with Moore to form a [[New Zealand Democratic Coalition|new party]] but this failed to eventuate.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Cosgrove himself stood for election in Moore's former [[Waimakariri (New Zealand electorate)|Waimakariri]] seat in the [[New Zealand general election, 1999|1999 election]], and was successful. He was re-elected in the [[New Zealand general election, 2002|2002]], [[New Zealand general election, 2005|2005]] and [[New Zealand general election, 2008|2008]] general elections. However, he was defeated in the electorate by [[New Zealand National Party|National]]'s [[Kate Wilkinson (politician)|Kate Wilkinson]] in [[New Zealand general election, 2011|2011]] and was subsequently elected as [[list MP]]. Wilkinson retired at the end of the parliamentary term and was replaced as National's candidate for the {{NZ election link|2014}} by [[Matthew Doocey]], who had previously contested the {{By-election link|Christchurch East|2013}} in [[Christchurch East]].&lt;ref name="Wilkinson sword"&gt;{{cite news |first=Glenn |last=Conway |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=8 November 2013 |page=A7 |title=Wilkinson to fall on her sword}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Glenn |last=Conway |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=8 November 2013 |accessdate=9 November 2013 |title=Canterbury MP Kate Wilkinson quits |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/north-canterbury/9372548/Canterbury-MP-Kate-Wilkinson-quits |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doocey beat Cosgrove with an increased majority.&lt;ref name="2014 election"&gt;{{cite web |title=Official Count Results -- Waimakariri |url= http://electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2014/electorate-57.html |publisher=[[Electoral Commission (New Zealand)|Electoral Commission]] |accessdate=27 September 2014 |date=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being again in eighth place on the Labour list, Cosgrove remained a list MP.&lt;ref name="labour-list"&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO1406/S00372/labour-list-for-the-2014-election-announced.htm |title=Labour List for the 2014 Election Announced |publisher=[[New Zealand Labour Party]] |agency=[[Scoop (website)|Scoop]] |date=23 June 2014 |accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cabinet minister (2005–2008)===
He was appointed Minister for Building and Construction, Minister of Statistics, Associate Minister of Finance, Associate Minister of Justice and Associate Minister of Immigration (responsible for individual immigration cases) after the 2005 election. At the October 2007 Cabinet reshuffle, he was promoted and replaced his Building and Construction and Statistics portfolio responsibilities; with the Immigration, Small Business, Sport and Recreation portfolios, and ministerial responsibility for the Rugby World Cup. He retained his roles as Associate Minister of Justice and Finance. Cosgrove lost his ministerial position when Labour was defeated in the 2008 election.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Cosgrove was selected to attend the [[World Economic Forum]]'s Annual meeting in New York and Davos in 2001 and 2002, and was appointed to the Forum's task force on Free Trade. He is generally considered to be on the right of the Labour Party.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

====Boy racers====
In August 2007 Cosgrove was targeted after raising considerable concerns about [[boy racer]]s, who have caused numerous and significant problems throughout his electorate and Christchurch in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title =Boy racers, residents draw battle lines  |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/818227 |newspaper=Television New Zealand  |date=20 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news  |title =Boyracers cause havoc in Christchurch

===Opposition (2008–2017)===
When [[Lianne Dalziel]] confirmed that she would contest the [[Christchurch mayoral election, 2013|2013 Christchurch mayoralty]], her Christchurch Earthquake Recovery portfolio was split and assigned to Cosgrove and [[Ruth Dyson]] in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cairns |first=Lois |title=Two MPs to take over Dalziel's portfolio |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/8907042/Two-MPs-to-take-over-Dalziels-portfolio |accessdate=23 August 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=11 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered standing in the [[Christchurch East by-election, 2013|by-election]] resulting from Dalziel's resignation from Parliament, but in the end decided not to put his name forward for the Labour nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cosgrove not standing for Christchurch East |page=A5 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He announced he would be retiring from politics at the [[New Zealand general election, 2017|2017 general election]] in April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/301124/labour's-clayton-cosgrove-to-leave-politics | title=Labour's Clayton Cosgrove to leave politics | work=RNZ News | date=10 April 2016 | accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Law |first1=Tina |last2=Small |first2=Vernon |authorlink2=Vernon Small |title=Cosgrove calls quits on politics&lt;!-- online title is different: "Labour MP Clayton Cosgrove will not seek re-election in 2017" --&gt; |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/78750052/labour-mp-clayton-cosgrove-will-not-seek-reelection-in-2017 |accessdate=25 April 2016 |work=[[The Press]] |date=11 April 2016 |page=A2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cotyttia''' ({{lang-el|Κοτύττια}}, ''Kotuttiā'') was an [[orgy|orgiastic]], nocturnal [[religious festival]] of ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Thrace]] in celebration of [[Kotys (deity)|Kotys]], the goddess of sex, considered an aspect of [[Persephone]].&lt;ref name=cass&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Orion Publishing Group|Cassell's]] Latin Dictionary |last=Simpson |first=D.

==Celebration==

Cotyttia originated with the [[Edoni|Edones]] as a celebration of the [[rape of Proserpine|rape of Persephone]].&lt;ref name=bell/&gt;&lt;ref name=peck/&gt; Throughout [[Thrace]] it was celebrated secretly in the hills at night,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Milton's Arcades and Comus |last=Verity |first=A.

Through influence of trade and commerce, the Edonian form of the festival spread to [[Athens]], [[Corinth]], and [[Chios]],&lt;ref name=cass/&gt;&lt;ref name=bell/&gt;&lt;ref name=theoi/&gt; where its mark became so pronounced that "companion of Cotytto" became synonymous with "slut".&lt;ref name =gow/&gt;

In [[Sicily]] the rites of Cotyttia were much more mundane, celebrating the waxing aspect of Persephone.&lt;ref name=bell/&gt;&lt;ref name=peck/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21091">The '''Devonshire House Ball''' or the '''Devonshire House Fancy Dress Ball''' was an elaborate [[Fancy Dress|fancy dress]] [[Masquerade ball|ball]], hosted by the [[Spencer Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|Duke]] and [[Louisa Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Duchess of Devonshire]], held on 2 July 1897 at [[Devonshire House]] in Piccadilly to celebrate [[Queen Victoria]]’s [[diamond jubilee]].  Due to the many prominent royals, aristocrats, and society figures who attended as well as the overall lavishness of the ball, it was considered the event of the 1897 London Season.

In 1897, The [[Spencer Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|Duke]] and [[Louisa Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Duchess of Devonshire]] hosted the Devonshire House Ball at [[Devonshire House]], the London residence (in [[Piccadilly]]) of the [[Duke of Devonshire|Dukes of Devonshire]] in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Duke had served as a [[Member of Parliament]] and a cabinet minister as a member of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] and the Duchess, known as the [[Double Duchess]], was the widow of the [[William Drogo Montagu, 7th Duke of Manchester|William Montagu, 7th Duke of Manchester]].&lt;ref name="Leach1904"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leach|first1=Henry|title=The Duke of Devonshire: A Personal and Political Biography|date=1904|publisher=Methuen &amp; Company|pages=308-324|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tum_MKt4mwQC&amp;pg=PA383|accessdate=9 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] in 1861, Queen Victoria had withdrawn from social life and "the mantle of royal entertaining" was passed to the [[Edward VII|Prince of Wales]] and his wife, [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra]].&lt;ref name="enoughofthistomfoolery"/&gt;  During the 1870s,&lt;ref name="Toit2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Toit|first1=Herman du|title=Pageants and Processions: Images and Idiom as Spectacle|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781443815079|page=199|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bfUZBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA199|accessdate=9 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; they hosted a costume ball at [[Marlborough House]], their London residence, which was considered a success and carried on the popularity of such events.&lt;ref name="enoughofthistomfoolery"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Masque1897"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lady Masque|title=The Great World {{!}} Lady's Realm|date=1897|publisher=Hutchinson and Company|page=464|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pF5EAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA464|accessdate=9 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Devonshires, who were close friends of the Prince and Princess of Wales, therefore, decided to throw a costume ball thrown to celebrate [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[diamond jubilee]].&lt;ref name="Chatsworth"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cavendish Story: The Double Duchess|url=http://www.chatsworthblog.org/2014/11/the-cavendish-story-double-duchess.html|website=www.chatsworthblog.org|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Queen's Diamond Jubilee procession had taken place on 22 June 1897 and followed a route six miles long through London.  More than 700 invitations were sent out a month before the event, although some reports of the event stated up to 3,000 invites.&lt;ref name="rvondeh"/&gt; By accident, [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] and [[Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia|Maria]], the [[List of Saxon consorts#Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] did not receive invitations.

===Costumes===
The Duchess of Devonshire's costume was described in detail by ''[[The Times]]'':&lt;ref name="1897TimesCoverage"&gt;{{cite news|title=THE DUCHESS OF DEVONSHIRE’S BALL|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/33170650/|accessdate=9 January 2018|work=[[The Times]]|date=3 July 1897|page=12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Duchess of Devonshire, as Zenobia, Queen of Palmyra, wore a magnificent costume. The skirt of gold tissue was embroidered all over in a star-like design in emeralds, sapphires, diamonds, and other jewels outlined with gold, the corners where it opened in front being elaborately wrought in the same jewels and gold to represent peacocks outspread tails. This opened to show an underdress of cream crepe de chine, delicately embroidered in silver, gold, and pearls and sprinkled all over with diamonds. The train, which was attached to the shoulders by two slender points and was fastened at the waist with a large diamond ornament, was a green velvet of a lovely shade, and was superbly embroidered in Oriental designs introducing the lotus flower in rubies, sapphires, amethysts, emeralds, and diamonds, with four borderings on contrasting grounds, separated with gold cord. The train was lined with turquoise satin. The bodice was composed of gold tissue to match the skirt, and the front was of crepe de chine hidden with a stomacher of real diamonds, rubies and emeralds and jewelled belt. A gold crown incrusted (sic) with emeralds, diamonds, and rubies, with a diamond drop at each curved end and two upstanding white ostrich feathers in the middle, and round the front festoons of pearls with a large pear shaped pearl in the centre falling on the forehead."&lt;ref name="1897TimesCoverage"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the most expensive costumes was worn by [[Charles Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough]] who went as the [[Louis Philippe, comte de Ségur|French Ambassador]] [[List of Ambassadors of France to Russia|to the Court of]] [[Catherine the Great]].&lt;ref name="Stevenson1978"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stevenson|first1=Sara|title=Van Dyck in Check Trousers: Fancy Dress in Art and Life ; 1700 - 1900 ; [1 July to 10 September 1978, Held in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery]|date=1978|publisher=Scottish National Portrait Gallery|isbn=9780903148160|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ESyDAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=9 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The velvet costume was made by the [[House of Worth]] and was embroidered in silver, pearls and diamonds with a waistcoat made out of gold and white [[damask]]. The price of the costume, which cost 5,000 [[franc]]s, reportedly even shocked the Duke, who had famously married American heiress [[Consuelo Vanderbilt]] in 1895.&lt;ref name="Sebba2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sebba|first1=Anne|title=American Jennie: The Remarkable Life of Lady Randolph Churchill|date=2007|publisher=W.

==Legacy==
The ball was reproduced on the London stage in [[Drury Lane]] in September 1897 "to the scandal of nobility and the amusement of the commoners."&lt;ref name="1897Stage"&gt;{{cite news|title=NEW PLAYS ON LONDON'S STAGE; Kyrle Bellew and Mrs. Potter Make Their Debut in "Francillon" -- Duchess of Devonshire's Ball. |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1897/09/19/102062421.pdf |accessdate=9 January 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]]|date=19 September 1897}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ball was utilized as the setting for the last act of a new play entitled ''[[The White Heather (play)|The White Heather]]'' by [[Cecil Raleigh]] and [[Henry Hamilton (playwright)|Henry Hamilton]].

The '''EFDA Nations Cup''' was a Formula Opel competition which was held between 1990 and 1998. The competition pitted international drivers against each other in similar cars, with drivers representing their nations. It was founded by Dan Partel within the Formula Opel/Vauxhall racing series.

The first Nations Cup race was held at the historic [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa-Francorchamps]] circuit in [[Belgium]] on 19–20 July 1990, and organised by the European Formula Drivers Association (EFDA).

==History==
In 1990, drivers representing 25 countries were already participating in the various Formula Vauxhall/Opel Lotus Series. The Nations Cup format called for two-car national teams. The Formula Vauxhall/Opel Lotus racing series was the only series that could muster twenty legitimate two-car national teams from its active list of competitors.

The format of the event remained the same for the next eight years, with two drivers from each country racing in virtually identical Formula Opel/Vauxhall racing cars painted in their [[List of international auto racing colors|national colours]].

The EFDA selected the [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps|Spa-Francorchamps]] circuit, licensed to start 46 cars or 23 two-car teams, for the inaugural event. The winners received the Nations Cup, and the top three teams were awarded gold, silver and bronze medals respectively. The event preceded the [[Spa 24 Hours]] race, and occurred in the middle of the racing season.

The '''Eurovision Song Contest 1984''', the 29th event of its kind, was held on 5 May 1984 in [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]]. The presenter, [[Désirée Nosbusch]], only 19 years old at the time, hosted the show in a lax manner, which was quite unusual for the show at the time. She manifested her fluency in four languages by switching between a strong transatlantic [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]] and [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]] in the course of talking, often in the same sentence.

Sweden's the [[Herreys]] were the winners of this contest with the song, "[[Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley]]". This was the Nordic country's second win, and the first song performed in Swedish. The previous Swedish winner, [[ABBA]], ten years ago had performed their song "[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]" in English. Richard and Luis Herrey became the first teenage males to win Eurovision and remain the youngest ever male winners, being 19 years and 260 days and 18 years and 184 days of age respectively&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest - The Official Celebration. Carlton Books, 2015. {{ISBN|978-1-78097-638-9}}. Pages 32-33&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Israel]] withdrew from the contest due to [[Yom Hazikaron]] (Day of Remembrance for the Fallen Soldiers of Israel and Victims of Terrorism) being commemorated on the same date. [[Iceland]] was going to participate but withdrew due to lack of financial support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?issId=119078&amp;pageId=1571564&amp;lang=is&amp;q=Eurovision%201984 |title=Morgunblaðið, 20.03.1983 |publisher=Timarit.is |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1984 is also a notable for the audible booing that could be heard from the audience, particularly at the end of the UK's performance. It was said that the booing was due to English football hooligans having rioted in Luxembourg in November 1983 after being knocked out of the UEFA European Football Championship. However, the song itself managed a pretty good showing, reaching seventh place.

==Voting structure==
Before the contest, Sweden was not expected to win or even achieve a high placing. In the run-up to the Contest, bookmakers [[Ladbrokes]] had the lowest odds on songs from Ireland, Italy, and the United Kingdom. Sweden was considered a "[[dark horse]]" entry with high odds.

Each country had a jury that awarded one to eight, 10 and 12 points for their top ten songs.

At the close of the penultimate jury's votes, there was only a difference of six points between Sweden and Ireland, at 141 and 135 respectively. However, Yugoslavia was the only country who had not given any points to Ireland, and Portugal, the last jury, gave that western country only two points, crushing their chances. Portugal's voting also cost Denmark, who had been holding at a strong third position, even leading the scoreboard for a short time, in that place, when Portugal's 12 lifted Spain from 94 to 106 points. Portugal at the same time had only given Denmark one point making Denmark's total 101 points. Despite this, this was latter country's best position in over 20 years.

Halfway through the voting, the scoreboard turned blue and remained so until the end of the voting. This was visible only to television viewers.

'''Formula Asia''', also known as '''Asian Formula 2000''', was a class of [[open wheel]] [[formula racing]].  The formula used an [[Argo Racing Cars|Argo chassis]] coupled with a 16-valve Ford Zetec 1,800cc engine.

There was only one championship held in Asia from 1994 until 2002, organized and promoted by Motorsport Asia Ltd. It was established to assist young Asian drivers make the transition from karting to European formulae such as Formula Ford and Formula Renault. Rounds were held in India, Indonesia, Malaysia and China. A special invitation race was also held annually at the [[Macau Grand Prix]]. It was replaced by [[Formula BMW]] Asia in 2003. 

Japanese female driver [[Keiko Ihara]] finished third in the AF2000 race at the 2002 Macau Grand Prix, becoming the first woman on the podium in the event's 50-year history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/4350105.stm Ex-model aims to be racing success] BBC Sport Motorsport Tuesday, 15 March 2005, 12:04 GMT&lt;/ref&gt; 

Drivers who have taken part in Formula Asia include: [[Michael Vergers]], [[Narain Karthikeyan]], [[Alex Yoong]], [[Ananda Mikola]], [[Satrio Hermanto]], [[Takuma Sato]], [[Mark Goddard (racing driver)|Mark Goddard]], [[Parthiva Sureshwaren]], [[Karun Chandhok]], [[Denis Lian]], [[Jim Ka To]] and [[Danny Watts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macau.grandprix.gov.mo/gp2002/en/pressnews.phtml Watts Turns on The Power on His Way to Asian Formula 2000 Challenge Victory] www.macau.grandprix.gov.mo 2002 Macau Grand Prix official website press release.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cars were later used as a support class with the [[Asian Formula Three]] cars.

It also refers to gambling establishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=The Free Dictionary |title=Gaming house |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/gaming+house}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They provide opportunity for professional gaming teams to house all of their players in a streamlined environment that the teams can cater and control. Instead of the players having to link up online, all are in a singular area so they can effectively scrimmage and practice with one another to get better at their respective video game. The houses can even have psychologists, analysts, nutritionists, trainers, and chefs so the players can take advantage of them should the need arise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blitzesports.com/lol/video/848/why-esports-teams-live-gaming-houses-evolve|title=Why esports teams live in gaming houses, and how they could evolve|work=blitzesports.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The houses can bring a sense of reality into a virtually fueled lifestyle. Because all of the players are with one another, they must learn to live with each other and will bond through the good and bad. With how strenuous these players lives can be, it is important to keep them in their senses and have a grasp of social connection, apart from the games itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eslgaming.com/article/team-houses-and-why-they-matter-1676|title=Team houses and why they matter|work=eslgaming.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The houses range in aesthetic appeal and can be smaller few bedroom houses with players sharing rooms where they might just have a mattress on the ground, or they can be extremely lavish and furnished with quality amenities in the suburbs of [[Los Angeles, California]] with A-List celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dexerto.com/news/faze-clan-unveil-latest-multi-million-dollar-gaming-house/46470|title=FaZe Clan Unveil Their Latest Multi-Million Dollar Gaming House|work=dexerto.com|accessdate= 19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hans Bertram''' (26 February 1906 &amp;ndash; 8 January 1993) was a German [[aviator]], [[screenwriter]] and [[film director]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Hans Bertram was born on 26 February 1906 in [[Remscheid]], Germany.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{IMDb name|0078313|Hans Bertram}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Career ===
During 1920, Bertram trained under flying instructor [[Paul Bäumer]], a noted German aviator of World War I, at [[Hamburg Airport|Hamburg Fuhlsbuttel Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Flight into Hell|author=Hans Bertram|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 1927, Bertram  was an aviation advisor to the government of the [[Republic of China]] and was involved in establishing its [[Republic of China Navy|naval aviation service]].

When Bertram piloted a [[Junkers W 33]] seaplane on an around-the world flight during 1932, he became lost over a sparsely-populated part of the [[Kimberley region of Western Australia]] and made a forced landing. Bertram and mechanic Adolf Klausmann were [[1932 Kimberley rescue|rescued]] and hospitalised in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]. Klausmann suffered significant long-term psychological effects from their ordeal. Books by Bertram regarding his adventures became best-sellers in Germany during 1933.

In 1934, Bertram joined the [[Nazi Party]] and the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] ("Brownshirts").&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Klee: ''Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945''. S. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 2007, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bertram's script for a drama set in an Australian gold mining town, was made into ''[[Women for Golden Hill|Frauen für Golden Hill]]'' ("Women for Golden Hill"), released in 1938. The World War I aviation drama ''[[D III 88]]'' (1939), also written by Bertram, was made with the support of ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' chief [[Hermann Göring]]. Another script by Bertram (based on a novel by Nicola Rhon), was endorsed by the Nazis: ''[[Der Fuchs von Glenarvon]]'' ("The Fox of Glenarvon") set in Ireland during the 1880s and concerned with Irish opposition to British rule was released in 1940.

During World War II, Bertram wrote and directed two feature-length propaganda-oriented documentaries about German aviators. While on active service with the ''Luftwaffe'' during 1941, he was shot down in [[Libya]] and taken prisoner. Bertram was sent to POW camps in Australia (where he was to remain for the duration of the war).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article8200719 |title=Hans Bertram Returns—Under Guard |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=26 August 1941 |accessdate=1 September 2014 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile in Germany, release of Bertram's film ''{{ill|Symphonie eines Lebens|de}}'' ("Symphony of a Life") was suspended when it was found that he had employed Jews, such as the lead actor [[Harry Baur]]. Bertram's membership of the [[Reich Chamber of Culture]] was suspended  and when ''Symphonie eines Lebens'' was released (1942), the names of Bertram, the rest of the crew and cast were omitted from the credits. 

Bertram wrote the scripts of 10 films completed between 1938 and 1985, and directed six films.&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt;

In 1985, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation screened ''[[Flight into Hell]]'', a television miniseries based on Bertram's accounts of his experiences during 1932.

==Early life and education==
Obokata was born in [[Matsudo, Chiba|Matsudo]], [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]], Japan, in 1983. She attended Toho Senior High School, which is attached to [[Toho University]], and graduated from [[Waseda University]]. At Waseda University, Obokata undertook undergraduate studies in the Department of Applied Chemistry, within the School of Science and Engineering, earning a [[Bachelor of Science]] in 2006, and graduate studies in the Graduate School of Advanced Science and Engineering, earning a [[Master of Science]] in Applied Chemistry in 2008.

After completing her master's, Obokata went on to study stem cells and regenerative medicine at the Institute of Advanced Biomedical Engineering and Science, a cooperative research and education facility operated with [[Tokyo Women's Medical University]]. She then undertook research at [[Harvard Medical School]] in [[Boston]] under [[Charles Vacanti]] for two years before returning to Waseda University to complete her [[Ph.D.]] in Engineering, again, from the Graduate School of Advanced Engineering and Science in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Profile of Riken scientist Obokata |date=January 30, 2014 |publisher=NHK |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203035652/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/english/news/20140130_19.html |archivedate=February 3, 2014|url=http://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/english/news/20140130_19.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Waseda graduate finds new method to create stem cells: Haruko Obokata leads research team |publisher=Waseda University |url=http://www.waseda.jp/eng/news13/140130_obokata.html |date=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a recent ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'' news report, Obokata had offered to retract her doctoral dissertation following allegations that she may have copied and pasted some segments of her dissertation from publicly available documents posted in the U.S. National Institute of Health website.&lt;ref name="asahistap20140316"&gt;[http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201403160016 "STAP cell scientist seeks to withdraw Ph.D. thesis"]. ''The Asahi Shimbun''. March 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, an investigative panel appointed by Waseda University gave Obokata one year to revise her Ph.D dissertation or lose her degree.&lt;ref&gt;Momoko, Suda, "[http://mainichi.jp/select/news/20151030k0000m040171000c.html]", "[[Mainichi Shimbun]]", 30 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; One year later, Waseda University announced that it was revoking Obokata's Ph.D.&lt;ref&gt;Murai, Shusuke, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/11/02/national/waseda-university-strip-obokata-ph-d/#.VjiPjs7os5t Waseda University strips Obokata of Ph.D.]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 3 November 2015, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Obokata became a guest researcher at the Riken Center for Developmental Biology in 2011, then she was appointed as head of the Lab for Cellular Reprogramming in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Rikejo' scientist triumphed over setbacks |publisher=The Japan News |agency=The Yomiuri Shimbun |url=http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0000987487 |date=January 31, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203171600/http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0000987487 |archivedate=February 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology (CDB): CDB welcomes two new laboratories |date=April 4, 2013 |url=http://www.cdb.riken.jp/en/04_news/articles/pdf/13/130404_newpi.pdf |publisher=RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, she published two papers in [[Nature (journal)|the journal '''Nature''']].

==Controversy==
Within a few weeks of publication, questions were raised about the publication ethics of Obokata’s papers published in ''Nature''. Professor [[Teruhiko Wakayama]], a senior author of the ''Nature'' articles, proposed retracting the papers and re-submitting them if the findings could be reproduced. The Japanese government affiliated research institute [[Riken]] also launched an investigation into the issue. Stem cell critics also noted that the images in the published articles are very similar to those published in Obokata's doctoral thesis, which were from a quite different project than the ''Nature'' publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retraction Request Made as More Questions Swirl Around Simple Stem Cell Method|author1=Normile, Dennis  |author2=Vogel, Gretchen |date=March 10, 2014|work=news.sciencemag.org|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/biology/2014/03/retraction-request-made-more-questions-swirl-around-simple-stem-cell-method}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 1, Riken announced that it had found Obokata guilty of scientific misconduct on two of the six charges initially brought against her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newsweek.com/haruko-obokata-who-claimed-stem-cell-breakthrough-found-guilty-scientific-239000 | title=Haruko Obokata, Who Claimed Stem Cell Breakthrough, Found Guilty of Scientific Misconduct | work=[[Newsweek]] | date=April 1, 2014 | accessdate=April 1, 2014 | author=Schlanger, Zoe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Riken investigators reached the following conclusion:

{{quote|In manipulating the image data of two different gels and using data from two different experiments, Dr. Obokata acted in a manner that can by no means be permitted. This cannot be explained solely by her immaturity as a researcher. Given the poor quality of her laboratory notes it has become clearly evident that it will be extremely difficult for anyone else to accurately trace or understand her experiments, and this, too, is considered a serious obstacle to healthy information exchange. Dr. Obokata’s actions and sloppy data management lead us to the conclusion that she sorely lacks, not only a sense of research ethics, but also integrity and humility as a scientific researcher.&lt;ref&gt;Ishii, Shunsuke ''et al.'' (March 31, 2014) [http://www3.riken.jp/stap/e/f1document1.pdf Report on STAP Cell Research Paper Investigation]. riken.jp&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On June 4, 2014, Obokata agreed to retract both the papers published in ''Nature'' in early 2014.&lt;ref name=retract&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan researcher agrees to withdraw disputed stem cell paper|author=Elaine Lies|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/04/us-japan-stemcells-researcher-idUSKBN0EF0SO20140604|newspaper=Reuters|date=June 4, 2014|accessdate=June 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nature'' confirmed the retraction on July 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/02/health-stemcells-retraction-idUSL6N0PD2UG20140702 | title=Nature journal retracts stem cell paper citing "critical errors" | work=Reuters | date=July 2, 2014 | accessdate=July 2, 2014 | author=Lawrence, Janet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNeil, David (June 30, 2014) [http://chronicle.com/article/In-Japan-Research-Scandal/147417/?cid=gn "In Japan, Research Scandal Prompts Questions"]. ''Chronicle of Higher Education''&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, Obokata was allowed to join Riken’s efforts to verify her original results under monitoring by a third party. She tried to replicate her own study using genetically manipulated mouse spleen cells that glow green if a gene indicative of pluripotency is activated. She failed to reproduce the ‘STAP cell’ to back up her claimed discovery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/12/18/national/science-health/obokata-fails-to-replicate-stap-cells-at-riken/ "Obokata fails to reproduce 'STAP cell' discovery"]. ''The Japan Times''. December 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 5, 2014, Obokata's mentor and co-author [[Yoshiki Sasai]] committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Cyranoski, David (August 5, 2014) [http://blogs.nature.com/news/2014/08/researchers-death-shocks-japan.html "Researcher’s death shocks Japan"]. Nature News Blog&lt;/ref&gt; He had been cleared of misconduct, but also criticized for inadequate supervision of Obokata.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/japanese-stem-cell-scientist-yoshiki-sasai-found-dead-in-apparent-suicide-9650050.html "Japanese stem cell scientist Yoshiki Sasai found dead in apparent suicide", ''The Independent'', 5 August 2014]. Accessed 6 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Obokata announced her resignation from Riken in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-30534674 | title=Stem cell scandal scientist Haruko Obokata resigns | work=BBC News | date=19 December 2014 | accessdate=19 December 2014 | author=Gallagher, James}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/feb/18/haruko-obokata-stap-cells-controversy-scientists-lie|title=What pushes scientists to lie?

'''Heroes of Wrestling''' was a [[professional wrestling]] [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) event that took place on October 10, 1999 from the [[Hollywood Casino Bay St. Louis|Casino Magic]] hotel and casino in [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi|Bay St. Louis]], [[Mississippi]]. The event was meant to be the first in a series of pay-per-views that would feature popular wrestling stars from the 1980s and early 1990s. Plans for the franchise were abandoned following the event, which suffered from a poor buy rate and several controversies, most notably a disastrous [[main event]] featuring an inebriated [[Jake Roberts]].

==Overview==
Playing off the resurgence in popularity of pro wrestling at the time, Fosstone Productions president Bill Stone conceived a series of events consisting of wrestling stars from the 1980s and early 1990s fighting one another in a series of "dream matches". Stone booked the initial pay-per-view with the intent of having three more, run on a quarterly basis, if the initial target of 40,000 buys was reached.&lt;ref name=40Kgoal&gt;{{cite web|url=
http://www.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/sep30_heroes.html|title=Reasonable goal for Heroes of Wrestling|accessdate=2007-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the event was heavily promoted, it was only purchased by 29,000 households. Additionally, the event itself was generally regarded to be of poor quality: ''[[Wrestling Observer]]'' rated it the worst major wrestling event of 1999,&lt;ref name=ppvdisappoints&gt;{{cite web|url= http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/oct11_her.html|title=Heroes PPV a disappointment| accessdate=2007-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its editor [[Dave Meltzer]] giving a rating of "[[absolute zero]]" to a tag team match featuring [[The Bushwhackers|Luke Williams and Butch Miller]] facing [[Nikolai Volkoff]] and [[The Iron Sheik]]. Meltzer's colleague, [[Bryan Alvarez]] of ''Figure Four Weekly'', has repeatedly referred to this match as the worst he has ever seen and rated it "minus more stars than there are in the universe"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrestlecrap.com/classic22.html Heroes of Wrestling: Sucked Long Before Jake Used a Snake as a Penis]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

=== Color commentary ===
Minor controversy initially erupted at the beginning of the broadcast due to a last-minute change of commentators. [[Gordon Solie]], a well-respected figure in the wrestling world with several decades of experience delivering play-by-play, had been advertised as one of the event's commentators. Shortly before the event, Solie fell ill with the [[throat cancer]] to which he would succumb nine months later. No announcement was made of the change before the show, and neither Solie nor his illness were ever mentioned during the broadcast. Solie's replacement, Randy Rosenbloom, appeared to have little to no knowledge of professional wrestling, delivering what would come to be regarded as some of the poorest color commentary ever given at a professional wrestling event.&lt;ref name="nosolie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://411mania.com/wrestling/the-smark-retro-repost-heroes-of-wrestling/ |title=The SmarK Retro Repost – Heroes Of Wrestling |first=Scott |last=Keith |date=2002-07-28 |accessdate=2007-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenbloom repeatedly made mistakes during the broadcast, such as misidentifying wrestlers' countries of origin, and having to be repeatedly corrected on basic wrestling terminology by his broadcast partners [[Dutch Mantell]] and [[Captain Lou Albano]], such as when he called an [[Professional wrestling throws#arm drag|arm drag]] performed by [[Marty Jannetty]] a "reverse slam takedown". A particular source of criticism was Rosenbloom's inability to identify a simple [[dropkick]], repeatedly calling the maneuver such things as a "flying kick," "flying leg kick," and "[[leg drop]]".&lt;ref name="dropkick"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlecrap.com/induction%20files/heroesofwrestling/flyinglegkick.rm|title=Rosenbloom messes up basic move names|accessdate=2007-05-13|format=RealMedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jake Roberts incident ===
The show is nominally remembered for its conclusion, originally slated to be a double-main event pitting Jake Roberts against [[Jim Neidhart]], and [[King Kong Bundy]] against [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]]. Roberts' problems with drug and alcohol addiction had been well publicized in the preceding years, and his booking in the main event was meant to capitalize on the resurgence in popularity he had enjoyed as a result of his attempts at sobriety. Roberts' return to the ring was meant to be the high point of the evening, and the match responsible for generating the most publicity. However, Roberts suffered a [[relapse]] prior to the show and consumed a significant amount of alcohol before arriving. Prior to his match with Neidhart, Roberts had been scheduled to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|cut a promo]] in which he would taunt Neidhart. Due to his level of intoxication, Roberts' promo instead consisted of a slurred, incoherent rant consisting largely of wordplay based on the event's casino setting. One particular segment of the rant would [[go viral]] after it was posted on [[WrestleCrap]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You don't want to play cards with me because I'll cheat. Okay? I cheat. You wanna play 21? I've got 22. You want to play [[blackjack]]? I've got two of those, too! You wanna play ... [[Aces and eights]], baby? I got too many of those, too!&lt;ref name="drunkjake"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlecrap.com/induction%20files/heroesofwrestling/jakeinterview.rm|title=Jake interview|accessdate=2007-05-13|format=RealMedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the interview, Roberts staggered to the ring with his trademark snake. However, upon reaching the ring, Roberts put the snake down and attempted to return backstage; he then reversed course, returned to ringside, and began greeting fans. Before entering the ring, Roberts grabbed a female fan and had her rub her hands on his bare chest. Later, Roberts removed the snake from its bag and simulated [[masturbation]] with it. The event's producers cut to wide-shots of the crowd during the incident, so that at-home viewers were unaware what was happening in the ring. Roberts eventually collapsed in the middle of the ring with the snake draped over his body; the prone Roberts then began to attempt to kiss the snake.

In an effort to salvage the match, promoter Bill Stone decided [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|on the fly]] to combine the main events into one tag team event and sent Bundy to team with Neidhart and Yokozuna to team with Roberts. Stone then sent a member of the production crew, Michael Henry, to ringside to consult with the wrestlers. Bundy pinned Roberts by hitting him with a splash after Roberts had staggered and fallen around the ring several times, despite Roberts not being the legal man in the ring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oowrestling.com/columns/oo/20030724.shtml OO Column: Online Onslaught by Rick Scaia Pro Wrestling News, Analysis, and Commentary...

Roberts was too inebriated to realize what was happening and remained oblivious to Yokozuna and Henry's attacks. Yokozuna then hit a Samoan drop on Henry to make the entire series of events appear scripted; while Yokozuna attacked Henry, Roberts began to disrobe in the middle of the ring and the producers cut the feed immediately thereafter.

[[File:Holi bonfire on Holi eve 2012.webm|thumb|Holi bonfire on Holi eve in Delhi, 2012]]
'''Holika Dahan''' also '''Kamudu pyre''' is celebrated by burning [[Holika]], the devil. For many traditions in [[Hinduism]], Holi celebrates the killing of Holika by [[Vishnu]] in order to save [[Prahlad]], a devotee of God [[Vishnu]] in the city of [[Multan]] [[Pakistan]], and thus Holi gets its name. In olden days, people use to contribute a piece of wood or two for the Holika bonfire, and this represents Holika killing her brother Hiranya Kashipu.

==Significance==
[[File:Holika Dahan, Kathamandu, Nepal.jpg|right|thumb|Woman preparing for Holika Dahan, Kathamandu, Nepal]]
The night before Holi, pyres are burnt in North India, Nepal and parts of South India in keeping with this tradition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/forests-bear-the-brunt-of-holi/article4552974.ece&lt;/ref&gt; The youth playfully steal all sorts of things and put them in Holika pyre.

It should also be noted that in some parts of India the day is actually called Holika Dehan {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}. There are other activities associated with the story of Prahlad, but the burning of Holika is the one that we can most directly associate with Holi. Fire burnt on the eve of Holi (Holika Dahan) symbolizes the burning of Holika. The story as a whole is testament to the power of devotion ([[bhakta]]) over the evil represented by [[King Hiranyakashyapu]], as Prahlad never lost his faith.

==The Ritual==
[[File:Holi Bonfire Festival Mundra Gujarat India.jpg|thumb|Holi festival bonfire at [[Mundra]], 2015]]
;Prepare Holika pyre for bonfire
Days before the festival people start gathering wood and combustible materials for the bonfire in parks, community centers, near temples and other open spaces. On top of the pyre is an effigy to signify Holika who tricked Prahalad into the fire. Inside homes, people stock up on color pigments, food, party drinks and festive seasonal foods such as ''[[gujiya]]'', ''[[mathri]]'', ''[[malpuas]]'' and other regional delicacies.

;Holika dahan
On the eve of Holi, typically at or after sunset, the pyre is lit, signifying Holika Dahan. The ritual symbolises the victory of good over evil. People sing and dance around the fire. People also perform [[parikrama]] of fire.

The next day people play [[Holi]], the popular festival of colors.

==Reason for Holika burning==
The burning of Holika is the most common mythological explanation for the celebration of Holi. In different parts of India varying reasons are given for Holika's death but all agree that the incident occurred in the city of Mulasthana (modern Multan), Punjab. Among those are:

*Vishnu stepped in and hence Holika burnt.
*Holika was given the power by the [[Brahma]] on the understanding that it can never be used to bring harm to anyone,
*Holika was a good person and it was the clothes that she wore that gave her the power and knowing that what was happening was wrong, she gave them to Prahlad and hence died herself.&lt;ref&gt;Travel Guide - Holi [http://www.nepalhomepage.com/society/festivals/fagupurnima.html Nepal Home Page] Retrieved on 4 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
*Holika wore a shawl that would protect her from fire. So when she was asked to sit in the fire with Prahlad she put on the shawl and sat Prahlad down in her lap. When the fire was lit Prahlad began praying to Lord Vishnu.  So Lord Vishnu summoned a gust of wind to blow the shawl off of Holika and on to Prahlad, saving him from the flames of the bonfire and burning Holika to her death.&lt;ref&gt;The Meaning of Holi [http://www.parmarth.com/updates/janfeb2005/holi.html Parmarth] Retrieved on 26 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35607">{{hatnote|This article is about claims to a genealogical descent from the historical Jesus. For the biblical genealogy of Jesus, see [[Genealogy of Jesus]].}}
The '''Jesus bloodline''' is a [[hypothesis|hypothetical]] sequence of lineal descendants of the [[historical Jesus]], often by [[Mary Magdalene]], usually portrayed as his wife. Differing and contradictory versions of a Jesus bloodline hypothesis have been proposed in numerous books by authors such as Louis Martin (1886), [[Donovan Joyce]] (1973), [[Andreas Faber-Kaiser]] (1977), [[Barbara Thiering]] (1992), [[Margaret Starbird]] (1993), and various websites. [[Dan Brown]]'s novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' used the premise for its plot line. The 2007 documentary ''[[The Lost Tomb of Jesus]]'' proposed that evidence existed to show that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene and that their son was named Judah, based upon inscriptions found on [[Ossuary|ossuaries]] discovered in Jerusalem in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simcha Jacobovici]], [[Charles R. Pellegrino]], ''The Jesus Family Tomb: The Discovery, the Investigation, and the Evidence That Could Change History'' (HarperCollins, 2007) {{ISBN|0061192023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biblical scholar and author [[James Tabor]] has affirmed his belief in a married Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;James D. Tabor, Simcha Jacobovici, ''The Jesus Discovery: The New Archaeological Find That Reveals The Birth of Christianity'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2012). {{ISBN|978-1-4516-5040-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Hypothetical Jesus bloodlines should not be confused with the biblical [[genealogy of Jesus]] or the historical relatives of Jesus and their descendants, who are known as the ''[[Desposyni]]''.

==History of the hypothesis==

The 13th-century [[Cistercian]] monk and chronicler [[Peter of Vaux de Cernay]] claimed it was part of [[Catharism|Catharist]] belief that the earthly [[Jesus Christ]] had a relationship with Mary Magdalene, described as his [[concubinage|concubine]].&lt;ref&gt;W.A. Sibly, M.D. Sibly, ''The History of the Albigensian Crusade: Peter of les Vaux-de-Cernay's "Historia Albigensis"'' (Boydell, 1998). {{ISBN|0-85115-658-4}} Quote: "Further, in their secret meetings they said that the Christ who was born in the earthly and visible Bethlehem and crucified at Jerusalem was 'evil', and that Mary Magdalene was his concubine – and that she was the woman taken in adultery who is referred to in the Scriptures; the 'good' Christ, they said, neither ate nor drank nor assumed the true flesh and was never in this world, except spiritually in the body of Paul. I have used the term 'the earthly and visible Bethlehem' because the heretics believed there is a different and invisible earth in which – according to some of them – the 'good' Christ was born and crucified."&lt;/ref&gt;

Early [[Mormon]] leaders [[Jedediah M. Grant]], [[Orson Hyde]], [[Joseph F. Smith]] and [[Orson Pratt]] stated it was part of their religious belief that Jesus Christ was [[polygamy|polygamous]], quoting this in their respective sermons.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Farkas, David A. Reed, ''Mormons: How to Witness to Them'' ([[Baker Publishing Group|Baker Academic]], 1997. {{ISBN|978-0801057397}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emnr.org/papers/jesusmarry.htm ''Did Jesus Christ Marry and Father Children?  A Survey of Mormon Teachings on the Marital and Parental Status of the Son of God''&lt;/ref&gt; The Mormons also used an apocryphal passage attributed to the 2nd-century Greek philosopher [[Celsus]]: "The grand reason why the gentiles and philosophers of his school persecuted Jesus Christ was because he had so many wives. There were Elizabeth and Mary and a host of others that followed him".&lt;ref&gt;Vern Grosvenor Swanson, ''Dynasty of The Holy Grail: Mormonism's Sacred Bloodline'', page 85 (Cedar Fort, 2006). {{ISBN|1-55517-823-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This appears to have been a summary of a garbled or second-hand reference to a quote from [[Celsus the Platonist]] preserved in the apologistic work [[Contra Celsum]] ("''Against Celsus''") by the [[Church Father]] [[Origen]]: "such was the charm of Jesus' words, that not only were men willing to follow Him to the wilderness, but women also, forgetting the weakness of their sex and a regard for outward propriety in thus following their Teacher into desert places."&lt;ref name=LeDonne&gt;{{cite book|last1=Le Donne|first1=Anthony|title=The Wife of Jesus: Ancient Texts and Modern Scandals|date=Nov 7, 2013|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=178074305X|pages=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French 19th-century socialist politician, Louis Martin (pseudonym of Léon Aubry, died 1900), in his 1886 book ''Les Evangiles sans Dieu'' described the [[historical Jesus]] as a turned [[atheism|atheist]], who had married Mary Magdalene, and that both had travelled to the South of France, where they had a son.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jasoncolavito.com/louis-martin--the-holy-bloodline.html Louis Martin on the Holy Bloodline]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jesus bloodline hypothesis which held that the [[historical Jesus]] had married Mary Magdalene and fathered a child with her was brought to the attention of the general public again in the 20th century by [[Donovan Joyce]] in his 1973 book ''[[The Jesus Scroll]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Donovan Joyce, ''The Jesus Scroll, a time bomb for Christianity?'' p. 97-98 (Sphere Books, 1975; {{ISBN|0-7221-5103-9}}).&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1977 book ''Jesus died in Kashmir: Jesus, Moses and the ten lost tribes of Israel'', Andreas Faber-Kaiser explored the legend that Jesus met, married and had several children with a [[Kashmiri people|Kashmiri]] woman. The author also interviewed the late Basharat Saleem who claimed to be a Kashmiri descendant of Jesus.&lt;ref name="Andreas Faber-Kaiser 1977"&gt;Andreas Faber-Kaiser, ''Jesus died in Kashmir: Jesus, Moses and the Ten lost Tribes of Israel'' (London: Gordon and Cremonesi; 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Baigent]], [[Richard Leigh (author)|Richard Leigh]], and [[Henry Lincoln]] developed and popularized the hypothesis that a bloodline from Jesus and Mary Magdalene eventually became the [[Merovingian]] [[dynasty]] in their 1982 book ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]'',&lt;ref name="Baigent, Leigh &amp; Lincoln 1982"&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Michael Baigent|Baigent, Michael]]; [[Richard Leigh (author)|Leigh, Richard]]; [[Henry Lincoln|Lincoln, Henry]]| title = [[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]| publisher = Corgi| year = 1982| isbn = 0-552-12138-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they asserted: {{quote|The symbolic significance of Jesus is that he is God exposed to the spectrum of human experience – exposed to the first-hand knowledge of what being a man entails. But could God, incarnate as Jesus, truly claim to be a man, to encompass the spectrum of human experience, without coming to know two of the most basic, most elemental facets of the human condition? Could God claim to know the totality of human existence without confronting two such essential aspects of humanity as sexuality and paternity? We do not think so. In fact, we do not think the Incarnation truly symbolises what it is intended to symbolise unless Jesus were married and sired children. The Jesus of the Gospels, and of established Christianity, is ultimately incomplete – a God whose incarnation as man is only partial. The Jesus who emerged from our research enjoys, in our opinion, a much more valid claim to what Christianity would have him be.&lt;ref name="Baigent, Leigh &amp; Lincoln 1982"/&gt;}}

In her 1992 book ''[[Jesus the Man (book)|Jesus and the Riddle of the Dead Sea Scrolls: Unlocking the Secrets of His Life Story]]'', Barbara Thiering also developed a Jesus and Mary Magdalene bloodline hypothesis, basing her historical conclusions on her application of the so-called [[Pesher#Barbara Thiering.27s Interpretation|Pesher technique]] to the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion between Barbara Thiering and [[Geza Vermes]] surrounding this, see http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2065&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thiering, Barbara (April, 2005). [http://www.peshertechnique.infinitesoulutions.com/Pesher/Marriage_of_Jesus.html The marriage of Jesus]&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 1993 book ''[[The Woman with the Alabaster Jar]]: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail'', Margaret Starbird developed the hypothesis that [[Saint Sarah]] was the daughter of Jesus and Mary Magdalene and that this was the source of the legend associated with the [[cult (religious practice)|cult]] at [[Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer]]. She also noted that the name "Sarah" meant "Princess" in [[hebrew language|Hebrew]], thus making her the forgotten child of the "''sang réal''", the [[blood royal]] of the [[INRI|King of the Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Starbird, ''The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail'', pages 60-62, Bear &amp; Company, 1993. {{ISBN|1-879181-03-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1996 book ''Bloodline of the Holy Grail: The Hidden Lineage of Jesus Revealed'', [[Laurence Gardner]] presented [[pedigree chart]]s of Jesus and Mary Magdalene as the ancestors of all the [[European ethnic groups|European]] [[royal families]] of the [[Common Era]].&lt;ref name="Gardner 1996"&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Laurence Gardner|Gardner, Laurence]] | title = Bloodline of the Holy Grail: The Hidden Lineage of Jesus Revealed | publisher = Element Books | year = 1996 | isbn = 1-85230-870-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 2000 sequel ''Genesis of the Grail Kings: The Explosive Story of Genetic Cloning and the Ancient Bloodline of Jesus'' is unique in claiming that not only can the Jesus bloodline truly be traced back to [[Adam and Eve]] but that the first man and woman were primate-alien [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] created by the [[Anunnaki]] of [[ancient astronaut theory]].&lt;ref name="Gardner 2000"&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Laurence Gardner|Gardner, Laurence]] | title = Genesis of the Grail Kings: The Explosive Story of Genetic Cloning and the Ancient Bloodline of Jesus | publisher = Element Books | year = 2000 | isbn = 1-86204-809-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2000 book ''Rex Deus: The True Mystery of Rennes-Le-Chateau and the Dynasty of Jesus'', Marylin Hopkins, Graham Simmans and [[Tim Wallace-Murphy]] developed a hypothesis based on a 1994 testimony by "Michael Monkton" (who claimed to be descended from [[Hugues de Payens]]),&lt;ref&gt;Tim Wallace-Murphy, Marilyn Hopkins, ''Custodians of Truth: The Continuance of Rex Deus'', pages 1-2 (Red Wheel/Weiser LLC, 2005). {{ISBN|1-57863-323-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a Jesus and Mary Magdalene bloodline was part of a shadow dynasty descended from twenty-four [[Kohen Gadol|high priests]] of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] known as "[[King|Rex]] [[Deus]]" – the "Kings of God".&lt;ref name="Hopkins, Simmans &amp; Wallace-Murphy 2000"&gt;{{cite book| title = Rex Deus: The True Mystery of Rennes-Le-Chateau| publisher = Element Books| year = 2000| isbn = 1-86204-472-4|author1=Hopkins, Marilyn |author2=Simmans, Graham |author3=Wallace-Murphy, Tim }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Da Vinci Code''===
{{main|The Da Vinci Code}}

The 2003 [[conspiracy fiction]] novel ''The Da Vinci Code'' by Dan Brown accepted some of the above hypotheses as being valid. Elements of some Jesus bloodline hypotheses were propounded by the 2007 documentary film ''[[The Lost Tomb of Jesus]]'' by [[Simcha Jacobovici]] focusing on the [[Talpiot Tomb]] discovery,&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Tomb of Jesus'' (The Discovery Channel), first transmitted on 4 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; which was also published as a book entitled ''[[The Jesus Family Tomb]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Simcha Jacobovici and Charles Pellegrino,''[[The Jesus Family Tomb]]: The Discovery, the Investigation, and the Evidence That Could Change History''(HarperOne, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 [[psychic medium]] [[Sylvia Browne]] released the book ''The Two Marys: The Hidden History of the Mother and Wife of Jesus'', in which she tries to further validate the possibility of Jesus and Mary Magdalene producing a family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Two Marys: The Hidden History of the Mother and Wife of Jesus|last=Browne|first=Sylvia|year=2007 |publisher=Dutton Adult|location=|isbn=0-525-95043-5|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Bloodline (documentary)}}

The 2008 documentary ''[[Bloodline (documentary)|Bloodline]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Bloodline'' DVD (Cinema Libre, 2008, 113 minutes). The documentary was originally released in cinemas on 9 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Bruce Burgess]], a filmmaker with an interest in [[paranormal]] claims, expands on the Jesus bloodline hypothesis and other elements of ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail''.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald H. Fritze, ''Invented Knowledge: False History, Fake Science and Pseudo-Religions'', pages 8-9 (Reaktion Books, 2009). {{ISBN|1-86189-430-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accepting as valid the testimony of an amateur archaeologist codenamed "Ben Hammott" relating to his discoveries made in the vicinity of [[Rennes-le-Château]] since 1999; Burgess claims Ben has found the treasure of [[Bérenger Saunière]]: a mummified corpse, which they believe is [[Mary Magdalene]], in an underground tomb they claim is connected to both the Knights Templar and the Priory of Sion. In the film, Burgess interviews several people with alleged connections to the Priory of Sion, including a Gino Sandri and Nicolas Haywood. A book by one of the documentary's researchers, Rob Howells, entitled ''Inside the Priory of Sion: Revelations from the World's Most Secret Society - Guardians of the Bloodline of Jesus'' presented the version of the Priory of Sion as given in the 2008 documentary,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Howells, ''Inside The Priory of Sion: Revelations From The World's Most Secret Society - Guardians of The Bloodline of Jesus'' (Watkins Publishing, 2011). {{ISBN|1-78028-017-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contained several erroneous assertions, such as the claim that Plantard believed in the Jesus bloodline hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;"In [[Holy Blood, Holy Grail]] Plantard claimed that the key to the mystery of Rennes-le-Château was that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married and had children." Howells, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; By 21 March 2012 Ben Hammott confessed and apologised on [[Podcast]] interview (using his real name Bill Wilkinson) that everything to do with the tomb and related artifacts was a hoax; revealing that the actual tomb was now destroyed, being part of a full sized set located in a warehouse in England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://latalkradio.com/Rene.php ''NightVision Radio'', entry dated Wednesday, March 21, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320110246/http://latalkradio.com/Rene.php |date=March 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.benhammott.com/hammott-statement.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joseph and Aseneth===
{{main|Joseph and Aseneth}}
In 2014 fringe investigative journalist [[Simcha Jacobovici]] and fringe religious studies historian [[Barrie Wilson]] suggested that a 6th century manuscript told the tale of Jesus and Mary Magdalene under the coding of "Joseph" and "Aseneth"&lt;ref&gt;Simcha Jacobovici and Barrie Wilson. The Lost Gospel. New York: Pegasus, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This manuscript, called "Joseph and Aseneth", forms part of an anthology compiled by [[Pseudo-Zacharias Rhetor]], so-named because it also includes the important Ecclesiastical History by the real [[Zacharias Rhetor]]. These documents are preserved as British Library Manuscript #17,202 along with other important works, e.g. The Seven Sleepers of Ephesus, the finding of first century relics of Stephen and Nicodemus, and the Conversion of Constantine written by a bishop of Rome named Sylvester.

As Jacobovici and Wilson point out, there are two covering letters to "Joseph and Aseneth". One is by an anonymous individual who had found a small, very old Greek manuscript in a library belonging to the bishops who had come from Resh'aina. Being rusty in Greek, he asked his friend, [[Moses of Ingila]], to translate the work, suspecting that it contained a hidden meaning. The second letter is by Moses of Ingila. He translated the work into Syriac, positioning it as a work of Wisdom whose meaning has to be carefully discerned, at the same time confirming the truth of mainstream Christianity in relation to Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;"In short, to tell the truth: our Lord, our God, the Word who, at the will of the father and by the power of the Holy Spirit of the Lord, took flesh, and &lt;became human&gt; and was united to the soul with its senses completely..." (Simcha Jacobovici, Barrie Wilson, ''The Lost Gospel'', page 384).&lt;/ref&gt; He also indicated that it contains a hidden meaning. Along with the clues provided by the covering letters, the use of Christian terminology ("Son of God," "Bride of God"), Eucharistic imagery and Syriac use of typology in which Old Testament figures prefigure New Testament ones, the authors argue that the work reflects a community which held that Jesus was married and had children. Using advanced digital imaging techniques, the authors restored the original Syriac text, providing a modern English translation of both "Joseph and Aseneth", and, for the first time ever, the two covering letters.

According to [[Angela Standhartinger]], Moses explained the story "as an allegory of Christ's marriage to the soul".&lt;ref name="Standhartinger"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Angela Standhartinger|editor1-last=Schuller|editor1-first=Eileen M.|editor2-last=Wacker|editor2-first=Marie-Theres|editor1-link=Eileen M.

Israeli Biblical scholar, Rivka Nir wrote: "…this is a serious-minded, thought-provoking and interesting book, giving expression to an excellent knowledge of early Christian sources and the ability to analyze and integrate them into a clear and comprehensible picture. The book abounds with historical surveys and enlightening discussions on its sources, terms, characters and various period-related aspects….This book will certainly occupy a highly important place in the scholarly quest for the historical Jesus, as it raises the fundamental question: how far can scholars go in this quest and to what extent are their conclusions founded",&lt;ref&gt;Nir, Rivka (Fall 2016). Book Review, ''The Lost Gospel''. [[Journal for the Study of the Historical Jesus]]. Volume 14, issue 3: page 296.&lt;/ref&gt; but described the thesis as objectionable.&lt;ref&gt;page 305.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book by Simcha Jacobovici and Barrie Wilson has been dismissed by mainstream Biblical scholarship. for example by Anglican theologian, [[Richard Bauckham]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://markgoodacre.org/BauckhamLostGospel(1).pdf ''Assessing the Lost Gospel'' by Richard Bauckman]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Church of England]] compared ''The Lost Gospel'' to a [[Monty Python]] sketch. The director of communications for the Archbishop's Council stated the book was an example of religious illiteracy and that ever since the publication of ''The Da Vinci Code'' in 2003, "an industry had been constructed in which 'conspiracy theorists, satellite channel documentaries and opportunistic publishers had identified a lucrative income stream'."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/11225598/Lost-gospel-claims-Jesus-and-Mary-were-married-and-had-children.html ''Lost Gospel claims Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married and had children'', by Victoria Ward, [[The Daily Telegraph]], 12 November 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Lost Gospel'' was described as historical nonsense by [[Markus Bockmuehl]].&lt;ref&gt;Markus Bockmuehl, ''Ancient Apocryphal Gospels'', page 21 (Westminster John Knox Press, 2017. {{ISBN|9780664263058}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adherence==

In reaction to ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail'', ''The Da Vinci Code'', and other controversial books, websites and films on the same theme, a significant number of individuals in the late 20th and early 21st centuries have adhered to a Jesus bloodline hypothesis despite its lack of substantiation. While some simply entertain it as a novel intellectual proposition, others hold it as an established belief thought to be authoritative and not to be disputed.&lt;ref name="Ouellet 2006"&gt;Bertrand Ouellet, " "But you, who do you say that I am?" Proclaiming Jesus Christ after the Da Vinci tsunami", officecom.qc.ca, 2006. Retrieved on 2008-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent among the latter are those who [[expectation (epistemic)|expect]] a direct descendant of Jesus will eventually emerge as a [[great man]] and become a [[messiah]], a [[Great Catholic Monarch|Great Monarch]] who rules a Holy European Empire, during an event which they will interpret as a [[Second Coming#Western Wisdom Teachings|mystical second coming]] of [[Christ#Western Wisdom Teachings|Christ]].&lt;ref name="Baigent, Leigh &amp; Lincoln 1987"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Baigent, Michael |author2=Leigh, Richard |author3=Lincoln, Henry | title = The Messianic Legacy| publisher = Henry Holt &amp; Co | year = 1987| isbn = 0-8050-0568-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eclectic spiritual views of these adherents are influenced by the writings of [[iconoclastic]] authors from a wide range of perspectives. Authors like Margaret Starbird and [[Jeffrey Bütz]] often seek to challenge modern beliefs and institutions through a re-interpretation of [[History of Christianity|Christian history]] and [[Christian mythology|mythology]].&lt;ref name="Ouellet 2006"/&gt; Some try to advance and understand the [[gender equality|equality of men and women]] spiritually by portraying Mary Magdalene as being the apostle of a [[Christian feminism]],&lt;ref&gt;Claire Nahmad and Margaret Bailey, ''The Secret Teachings of Mary Magdalene: Including the Lost Verses of The Gospel of Mary, Revealed and Published for the First Time'' (Watkins; 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; and even the personification of the [[mother goddess]] or [[sacred feminine]],&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Clare Prophet, ''Mary Magdalene and the Divine Feminine: Jesus' Lost Teachings on Woman'' (Summit University Press; 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; usually associating her with the [[Black Madonna]].&lt;ref&gt;Ean Begg, ''The Cult of the Black Virgin'' (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; Some wish the ceremony that celebrated the beginning of the alleged marriage of Jesus and Mary Magdalene to be viewed as a "[[hierogamy|holy wedding]]"; and Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and their alleged daughter, [[Saint Sarah|Sarah]], to be viewed as a "[[Holy Family|holy family]]", in order to question traditional [[gender role]]s and [[family values]].&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Starbird, ''The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail'' (Bear &amp; Company; 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all these claims are at odds with scholarly [[Christian apologetics]], and have been dismissed as being [[New Age]] [[Gnosticism in modern times|Gnostic]] [[Christian heresy|heresies]].&lt;ref name="ehrman"&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Bart D. Ehrman]] | title = Truth and Fiction in The Da Vinci Code: A Historian Reveals What We Really Know about Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and Constantine | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-19-518140-1 | url = http://www.religionfacts.com/da_vinci_code/jesus_married.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ben Witherington III]], ''The Gospel Code – Novel Claims about Jesus, Mary Magdalene and Da Vinci'', pages 172-173 (InterVarsity Press, Illinois; 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

No mainstream [[Christian denomination]] has adhered to a Jesus bloodline hypothesis as a [[dogma]] or an object of [[worship|religious devotion]] since they maintain that Jesus, believed to be [[God the Son]], was perpetually [[Clerical celibacy#Celibacy.2C continence and chastity|celibate, continent and chaste]], and [[Bride of Christ|metaphysically married to the Church]]; he [[death of Jesus|died]], was [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrected]], [[ascension of Jesus|ascended to heaven]], and will eventually [[Second Coming of Christ|return to earth]], thereby making all Jesus bloodline hypotheses and related [[messianism|messianic]] expectations impossible.&lt;ref name="Ouellet 2006"/&gt;

Many [[fundamentalist Christian]]s believe the [[Antichrist]], prophesied in the [[Book of Revelation]], plans to present himself as descended from the [[Davidic line]] to bolster his false claim that he is the [[Jewish Messiah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title =Jerry Falwell and the Jews| author =Merrill Simon| year =1999|edition=first| publisher =Jonathan David Pub| isbn =9780824603007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intention of such propaganda would be to influence the opinions, emotions, attitudes, and behavior of [[Jews]] and [[philo-Semites]] to achieve his [[Satan]]ic objectives. An increasing number of fringe [[Christian eschatology|Christian eschatologists]] believe the Antichrist may also present himself as descended from the Jesus bloodline to capitalize on growing adherence to the hypothesis in the general public.&lt;ref name="Aho on the Merovigians 1997"&gt;{{citation | author = Aho, Barbara | title = The Merovingian Dynasty: Satanic Bloodline of the AntiChrist &amp; False Prophet | year = 1997 | url = http://watch.pair.com/merovingian.html | accessdate = 2009-11-11 |work= Watch Unto Prayer [watch.pair.com] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Jesus bloodline hypotheses parallel other [[legend]]s about the flight of [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] to distant lands, such as the one depicting [[Joseph of Arimathea]] traveling to [[England]] after the death of Jesus, taking with him a piece of thorn from the [[Crown of Thorns]], which he later planted in [[Glastonbury]]. Historians generally regard these legends as "[[pious fraud]]" produced during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Sherman Loomis (Editor),''Arthurian Literature in the Middle Ages. A collaborative history''. Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Francis Treharne, ''The Glastonbury Legends: Joseph of Arimathea, the Holy Grail and King Arthur'', London, Cresset Press, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Armitage Robinson, ''Two Glastonbury Legends: King Arthur and St Joseph of Arimathea'', University Press, Cambridge, 1926&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jesus bloodline hypothesis from the book ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail'' is not contained in any of the "[[Priory of Sion]] documents" and was dismissed as fiction by [[Pierre Plantard]] in 1982 in a French radio interview, as well as by [[Philippe de Cherisey]] in a magazine article.&lt;ref&gt;Quoting Pierre Plantard: "I admit that 'The Sacred Enigma' (French title for 'The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail') is a good book, but one must say that there is a part that owes more to fiction than to fact, especially in the part that deals with the lineage of Jesus. How can you prove a lineage of four centuries from Jesus to the Merovingians? I have never put myself forward as a descendant of Jesus Christ" (Jacques Pradel radio interview on 'France-Inter', 18 February 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philippe de Chérisey, ''Jesus Christ, his wife and the Merovingians'' (Nostra – 'Bizarre News' N° 584, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt; However, Plantard's "Priory of Sion" documents prior to 1956 were found to be forgeries which were planted in French institutions to be later "rediscovered".&lt;ref&gt;The Secret of the Priory of Sion, CBS News '60 Minutes', transmitted on 30 April 2006, presented by Ed Bradley, produced By Jeanne Langley.&lt;/ref&gt; Plantard only claimed that the [[Merovingians]] were descended from the [[Tribe of Benjamin]],&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Jarnac, ''Les Mystères de Rennes-le-Château: Mèlange Sulfureux'' (CERT, 1994),&lt;/ref&gt; which contradicts the hypothesis of a Jesus bloodline as the missing link between the Merovingian line and the [[Davidic line]] from the [[Tribe of Judah]]. The notion of a direct bloodline from Jesus and Mary Magdalene, and its supposed relationship to the Merovingians (as well as their alleged modern descendants: [[House of Habsburg]], [[Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg]], [[Clan Sinclair]], [[House of Stuart]], [[House of Cavendish]], [[House of Bourbon]], [[House of Orléans]] and other noble families), is strongly dismissed as [[pseudohistorical]] by a qualified majority of Christian and secular historians such as [[Darrell Bock]]&lt;ref&gt;Bock, Darrell L. ''Breaking The Da Vinci Code : Answers To The Questions Everyone's Asking'' / Darrell L. Bock. Waterville, Me. : Thorndike Press, 2004. 239 p. (large print) ; 22&amp;nbsp;cm. {{ISBN|0-7862-6967-7}} (alk. paper)
&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bart D. Ehrman]],&lt;ref name="ehrman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darrell L. Bock, [http://www.leaderu.com/theology/wasjesusmarried.html Was Jesus Married?]&lt;/ref&gt; along with journalists and investigators such as Jean-Luc Chaumeil, who has an extensive archive on this subject matter.

In 2005, UK TV presenter and amateur archaeologist [[Tony Robinson]] edited and narrated a detailed rebuttal of the main arguments of Dan Brown and those of Baigent, Leigh, and Lincoln, "The Real Da Vinci Code", shown on [[Channel 4]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Real Da Vinci Code'', Channel Four Television, presented by Tony Robinson, transmitted on 3 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The programme featured lengthy interviews with many of the main protagonists, and cast severe doubt on the alleged landing of Mary Magdalene in [[France]], among other related myths, by interviewing on film the inhabitants of [[Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer]], the centre of the cult of Saint Sarah.

The Jesus bloodline hypothesis from the book ''Rex Deus: The True Mystery of Rennes-Le-Chateau and the Dynasty of Jesus'' hinges on the testimony of the authors' anonymous informant, "Michael", who claimed to be a ''Rex Deus'' scion. Evidence supporting the hypothesis was supposedly lost, and therefore cannot be independently verified, because Michael claimed that it was contained in his late father's bureau, which was sold by his brother unaware of its contents.&lt;ref name="Hopkins, Simmans &amp; Wallace-Murphy 2000"/&gt; Some critics point out the informant's account of his family history seems to be based on the controversial work of Barbara Thiering.&lt;ref&gt;McKeown, Trevor W. [http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/anti-masonry01.html#rex What about the Rex Deus dynasty's influence on Freemasonry?] in the ''Anti-masonry Frequently Asked Questions'', 5 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Lockwood, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh]]'s director for communications, sees the notion of the Church conspiring to [[cover-up]] the truth about a Jesus bloodline as a deliberate piece of [[anti-Catholic]] propaganda. He sees it as part of a long tradition of anti-Catholic sentiment with deep roots in the American [[Protestant]] imagination but going back to the very start of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] of 1517.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, Craig. [http://www.pittsburghcatholic.org/newsarticles_more.phtml?id=1659 'Da Vinci' proves Catholic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504023211/http://www.pittsburghcatholic.org/newsarticles_more.phtml?id=1659 |date=2006-05-04 }} in  ''Pittsburgh Catholic'', April 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Jesus bloodline hypotheses were not submitted to the judgment of the [[Jesus Seminar]], a group of scholars involved in the [[quest for the historical Jesus]] from a [[liberal Christian]] perspective, they were unable to determine whether Jesus and Mary Magdalene had a matrimonial relationship due to the dearth of [[Historicity (Bible Studies)|historical evidence]]. They concluded that the historical Mary Magdalene was not a repentant prostitute but a prominent disciple of Jesus and a leader in the [[early Christian]] movement.&lt;ref name="Acts"&gt;''The Acts of Jesus: The Search for the Authentic Deeds of Jesus'' (1998), Harper SanFrancisco, {{ISBN|0-06-062979-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bart D. Ehrman]], who chairs the Department of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina, commented that, although there are some historical scholars who claim that it is likely that Jesus was married, the vast majority of [[New Testament]] and [[early Christianity]] scholars find such a claim to be historically unreliable.&lt;ref name="ehrman"/&gt;

Ultimately, the notion that a person living millennia ago has a small number of descendants living today is statistically improbable.&lt;ref&gt;F. M. Lancaster, [http://www.genetic-genealogy.co.uk/supp/ancestor_paradox.html The Ancestor Paradox]&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Olson, author of ''Mapping Human History: Genes, Race, and Our Common Origins'', published an article in ''Nature'' demonstrating that, as a matter of statistical probability:

{{quote|If anyone living today is descended from Jesus, so are most of us on the planet.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Steve. [http://www.slate.com/id/2138060/ Why We're All Jesus' Children] in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', March 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Historian Ken Mondschein ridiculed the notion that the bloodline of Jesus and Mary Magdalene could have been preserved:

{{quote|Infant mortality in pre-modern times was ridiculously high, and you'd only need one childhood accident or disease in 2,000 years to wipe out the bloodline … keep the children of Christ marrying each other, on the other hand, and eventually they'd be so inbred that the sons of God would have flippers for feet.&lt;ref name="Thompson 13/01/2008"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Thompson, Damian| title = How Da Vinci Code tapped pseudo-fact hunger| year = 2008 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/01/12/nrfact212.xml| accessdate=2008-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Chris Lovegrove, who reviewed ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail'' when first published in 1982, dismissed the significance of a Jesus bloodline, even if it were proven to exist despite all evidence to the contrary:

{{quote|If there really is a Jesus dynasty – so what? This, I fear, will be the reaction of many of those prepared to accept the authors' thesis as possible, and the book does not really satisfy one's curiosity in this crucial area.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Lovegrove, "The Magdalene &amp; the Sangraal", in ''Journal of the Pendragon Society'', Volume XV, Number 2 (Spring 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Kapparot''' ({{lang-he|כפרות}},  [[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi transliteration]]: {{transl|he|Kapporois}}, {{transl|he|Kappores}}) is a [[Minhag|customary]] [[Atonement in Judaism|, Jewish atonement]] [[ritual]] practiced by some [[Jews]] on the eve of [[Yom Kippur]]. This is a practice in which a [[chicken]] or money is waved over a person's head and the chicken is then slaughtered in accordance with [[Halakha|halachic]] rules.  ([[tzedakah]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Etymology==
[[File:Kapparot Lithography.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Lithograph of Kapparot, late 19th/early 20th century]]
''Kapparah'' ({{lang|he|כפרה}}), the singular of ''kapparot'', means '[[Atonement in Judaism|atonement]]' and comes from the Hebrew root k-p-r, which means 'to atone'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H3722&amp;t=NASB |title= Strong's Concordance Lexicon entry for kaphar (Hebrew word #3722) |publisher= [[Blue Letter Bible]] |location= [[Rancho Santa Margarita, California]] |accessdate= 2011-08-19 |quote= to cover, purge, make an atonement, make reconciliation, cover over with pitch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
[[File:ShohetWithRoosterThumb.jpg|thumb|right|''The [[Shechita|Shochet]] with Rooster'' by [[Israel Tsvaygenbaum]], 1997]]
On the afternoon before [[Yom Kippur]], one prepares an item to be donated to the poor for consumption at the pre-Yom Kippur meal,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shulchan Aruch]] Rama [[Orach Chayim]]'' 605:1&lt;/ref&gt; recites the two biblical passages of {{bibleverse-lb||Psalms|107:17-20|HE}} and {{bibleverse-lb||Job|33:23-24|HE}}, and then swings the prepared charitable donation over one's head three times while reciting a short prayer three times.

===Using a rooster===
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 3411 Jewish holidays.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A vendor at [[Mahane Yehuda Market]] in [[Jerusalem]] sells [[rooster]]s for kapparot before [[Yom Kippur]].]]
In one variant of the practice of Kapparot, the item to be donated to charity is a [[rooster]]. In this case, the rooster would be swung overhead while still alive. After the Kapparot ritual is concluded, the rooster would be treated as a normal [[kashrut|kosher]] [[poultry]] product, i.e., it would be [[Ritual slaughter#Jewish Shechita|slaughtered]] according to the laws of ''[[shechita]]''. It would then be given to charity for consumption at the pre-Yom Kippur meal. In modern times, this variant of the ritual is performed with a rooster for men and a hen for women.

In this case, the prayer recited translates as:
{{quote|This is my exchange, this is my substitute, this is my atonement. This rooster (hen) will go to its death, while I will enter and proceed to a good long life and to peace.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete [[ArtScroll]] [[Machzor]]: Yom Kippur'', p.4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Using money===
In a second variant of the practice of Kapparot, a bag of money is swung around the head and then given to charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hsje.org/Holidays/kaparot.htm |title= The Ancient Origins of an Obscure Egyptian Jewish High Holy Day Custom |first= Andrew |last= Strum |year= 2002 |publisher= Historical Society of Jews From Egypt |archiveurl= http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?rls=com.microsoft%3A*&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;startIndex=&amp;startPage=1&amp;hl=en&amp;q=cache:jK_1ZTlxp40J:http://www.hsje.org/Holidays/kaparot.htm+%22alternatively+been+practised+with+coins+which+are+then+donated+to+charity%22&amp;ct=clnk |archivedate= 2011-08-06 |accessdate= 2011-08-16 |quote= ... alternatively been practised with coins which are then donated to charity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case, the prayer recited translates as:
{{quote|This is my exchange, this is my substitute, this is my atonement. This money will go to charity, while I will enter and proceed to a good long life and to peace.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete [[ArtScroll]] [[Machzor]]: Yom Kippur'', p.4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Sources==
The practice of kapparot is mentioned for the first time by [[Amram Gaon]] of [[Sura Academy]] in [[Babylonia]] in 670 and later by [[Natronai ben Hilai]], also of Sura Academy, in 853. Jewish scholars in the ninth century explained that since the Hebrew word {{lang|he|גבר}}&lt;ref&gt;Complete Jewish Bible by David H. Stern -1998&lt;/ref&gt; means both "man" and "rooster", a [[rooster]] may substitute as a religious and spiritual vessel in place of a man.

==Historical controversy==
[[File:Kaparot.jpg|thumb|250px|The original printing of [[Joseph ben Ephraim Karo]]'s ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'', [[Orach Chayim]], ch. 605, states in the chapter heading that kapparot is a nonsensical custom that should be abolished. Later editions removed this. However, according to [[Samson Morpurgo]], (''Shemesh Tsedakah'', 1:23) the chapter heading was not written by Rabbi Karo but was inserted by the publishers.]]
Kapparot was strongly opposed by some rabbis, among them [[Nahmanides]], [[Shlomo ben Aderet]], and the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] rabbi [[Joseph ben Ephraim Karo]] in the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]''. According to the ''[[Mishnah Berurah]]'', his reasoning was based on the caution that it is similar to non-Jewish rites.  

The Ashkenazi rabbi [[Moses Isserles]] disagreed with Karo and encouraged kapparot.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'', [[Orach Chayim]] 605:1&lt;/ref&gt;  In Ashkenazi communities especially, Rabbi Isserles' position came to be widely accepted, since [[Ashkenazi Jews]] will generally follow the halachic rulings of Rabbi Isserles where the Sephardic and Ashkenazic customs differ. It was also approved by [[Asher ben Jehiel]] (c. 1250–1327) and his son [[Jacob ben Asher]] (1269–1343) and other commentators. The ritual was also supported by [[Kabbalah|Kabbalists]], such as [[Isaiah Horowitz]] and [[Isaac Luria]], who recommended the selection of a white rooster as a reference to {{bibleverse-lb||Isaiah|1:18|HE}} and who found other [[Jewish mysticism|mystic]] allusions in the prescribed formulas. Consequently, the practice became generally accepted among the [[Ashkenazi Jews]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] of [[Eastern Europe]]. The ''[[Mishnah Berurah]]'' agrees with Rabbi Isserles, solidifying support for the practice among [[Lithuanian Jews]] as well. The Mishnah Berurah only supports the use of money (i.e., not a chicken) if there might be a problem with the [[Ritual slaughter#Jewish Shechita|slaughter]] due to haste or fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shulchan Aruch]] [[Orach Chayim|O.C.]]'' 605:1&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th-century work ''Kaf Hachaim'', [[Yaakov Chaim Sofer]] approves of the custom for Sephardi Jews as well.

==Animal cruelty controversy==
Some Jews also oppose the use of chickens for Kapparot on the grounds of [[tza'ar ba'alei chayim]], the principle banning [[cruelty to animals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishveg.com/schwartz/kapparot.html |title=THE CUSTOM OF KAPPAROT IN THE JEWISH TRADITION |accessdate=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Yom Kippur eve 2005, a number of caged chickens were abandoned in rainy weather as part of a kapparot operation in [[Brooklyn]], New York; some of these starving and dehydrated chickens were subsequently rescued by the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.recordonline.com/archive/2005/10/22/swinger0.htm |last=Horrigan |first=Jeremiah |date=2005-10-22 |publisher=Times Herald-Record |accessdate=2008-10-06 |title=Abandoned chickens saved from death}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob Kalish, an Orthodox Jewish man from [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]], was charged with animal cruelty for the drowning deaths of 35 of these kapparot chickens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://pqarchiver.nypost.com/nypost/access/924767591.html?dids=924767591:924767591&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Nov+10%2C+2005&amp;author=PHILIP+MESSING&amp;pub=New+York+Post&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=027&amp;desc=ABUSE+MOST+FOWL%3B+CHICKEN-DEATH+BUST |title=Abuse Most Fowl; Chicken-death Bust |date=2005-11-10 |publisher=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to such reports of the mistreatment of chickens, Jewish [[animal rights]] organizations have begun to picket public observances of kapparot, particularly in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3309121,00.html |date=2006-09-28 |last=Sela |first=Neta |accessdate=2008-10-06 |title=Rabbis cry 'fowl' on ritual use of chickens}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Activists cry foul over ultra-Orthodox chicken ritual |first= Nicole |last= Neroulias |url= http://newsok.com/activists-cry-foul-over-ultra-orthodox-chicken-ritual/article/feed/189277 |agency= [[Associated Press]] |newspaper= [[The Oklahoman]] |date= 2010-09-08 |accessdate= 2011-08-30 |quote= Some efforts, though, have been made to point out that the ritual is not religiously required and can instead be performed with money. |archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kapparot ritual would seem to be constitutionally protected as an exercise of [[freedom of religion in the United States]], based upon a 1993 [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decision in the case of ''[[Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah]]''. In that case, the court upheld the right of [[Santería]] adherents to practice ritual [[animal sacrifice]], with Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] stating in the decision, "Religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection" (quoted by Justice Kennedy from the opinion by Justice [[Warren E. Burger]] in ''[[Thomas v. Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division]]'', {{ussc|450|707|1981}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Hall|first=Daniel E.|title=Criminal Law and Procedure|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KnBnknQAHlkC&amp;pg=PA266|year=2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-4283-4059-6|page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NYC Department of Health controversy==
In October, 2017, public health and animal rights activists in New York City launched a campaign to compel NYC's Health Commissioner, Dr. Mary Bassett, to enforce seven public health codes violated during Kapporot.&lt;ref&gt;https://theirturn.net/2017/10/27/nyc-health-commissioner-mary-bassett-chicken-massacre/&lt;/ref&gt; From October 2017 to May 2018, the activists disrupted four of her public speaking engagements and staged four protests in the lobby of the NYC Department of Health (DOH).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/demonstrators-implore-city-ban-jewish-chicken-slaughter-ritual-article-1.3859211&lt;/ref&gt; The activists allege that Commissioner Bassett is turning a blind eye to the health code violations because the ultra-Orthodox Jews who practice the ritual represent a powerful voting bloc. A toxicology reported submitted to the court as part of an ongoing lawsuit against the DOH states that the ritual poses a risk to public health in the neighborhoods where it takes place.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.endchickensaskaporos.com/180308nyc_residents_pressure_doh.html&lt;/ref&gt; While Commissioner Bassett has not publicly acknowledged the toxicology report or the activists' claims about the health code violations, she has issued a public statement asserting that "there remains no evidence that the use of chickens for Kaporos poses a significant risk to human health."&lt;ref&gt;https://theirturn.net/2018/02/13/Mary-Bassett-Public-Health/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Iraqi Kurdistan}}
The '''Kirkuk status referendum''' was the [[Kirkuk]] part of a planned plebiscite to decide whether the [[disputed territories of Northern Iraq]] should become part of the [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] [[regions of Iraq|region]].  The [[referendum]] was initially planned for 15 November 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.export.gov/Iraq/pdf/iraq_government.pdf Iraqi Council of Ministers Presented to the Parliament by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001111155/http://export.gov/Iraq/pdf/iraq_government.pdf |date=1 October 2013 }} www.export.gov/Iraq&lt;/ref&gt; but was repeatedly delayed&lt;ref name=iran&gt;[http://www.thenewanatolian.com/tna-29406.html Iran pleases Ankara, irks Kurds with call for Kirkuk poll delay], ''[[The New Anatolian]]'', 2007-11-08, accessed on 1 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aina.org/news/20071217124429.htm Kirkuk, Other Iraq Issues to Be Delayed&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately never took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Iddon| first = Paul| title = Iraqi Kurdistan in disarray after the loss of Kirkuk| work = alaraby| accessdate = 2017-10-31| url = https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/indepth/2017/10/19/iraqi-kurdistan-in-disarray-after-the-loss-of-kirkuk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The referendum was mandated by Article 140 of the [[Constitution of Iraq]].  Article 140 required that before the referendum, measures had to be taken to reverse the [[Arabization]] policy employed by the [[Saddam Hussein]] administration during the [[Al-Anfal Campaign]]. Thousands of [[Kurd]]s returned to Kirkuk following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. The referendum was to decide whether enough had returned for the area to be considered Kurdish.&lt;ref name=DELAY&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/12/38b72bcc-9ef3-4fd7-a7f3-05a650dcd190.html Iraq: Kurds warn against delaying Kirkuk Referendum] RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty&lt;/ref&gt;  

Kurdish resentment over the government's failure to implement Article 140 was one of the reasons for the [[Iraqi Kurdistan independence referendum, 2017|2017 Iraqi Kurdistan independence referendum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = President of Iraqi Kurdistan says independence vote is due to failure of unity| work = The National| accessdate = 2017-10-31| url = https://www.thenational.ae/world/mena/president-of-iraqi-kurdistan-says-independence-vote-is-due-to-failure-of-unity-1.626631}}&lt;/ref&gt; which posed the question, "Do you want the Kurdistan Region and the Kurdistani areas outside the Region to become an independent state?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Kurdistan referendum commission reveals four-language sample ballot| work = Rudaw| accessdate = 2017-10-31| url = http://www.rudaw.net/english/kurdistan/060920172}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referendum led to episodes of [[2017 Iraqi–Kurdish conflict|Iraqi–Kurdish conflict]] and the [[Battle of Kirkuk (2017)|government takeover]] of Kirkuk.

==The Iraqi Constitution==
[[File:Disputed areas in Iraq.svg|thumb|Disputed areas in Iraq according to Article 140:&lt;small&gt;
{{legend|#ff80e5|Disputed and part of the Kurdish Regional Government since 1991.}}
{{legend|#decd87|Disputed and in part under the control of central government, although this area has diminished since the events of 2014.}}&lt;/small&gt;]]
Following the [[invasion of Iraq]] in 2003 by the [[United States]]-led coalition, the country was under the direct rule of the [[United States]]-appointed [[Coalition Provisional Authority]], with advice from selected Iraqi leaders who sat on the [[Iraqi Governing Council]]. The IGC approved an interim constitution, the [[Law of Administration for the State of Iraq for the Transitional Period]] (Transitional Administrative Law, TAL), which established the framework for the drafting and approval of a permanent constitution.

The TAL included specific clauses providing for the return of and compensation for forced migrants and for the "''resolution of disputed territories including Kirkuk''" through arbitration:

{{Quotation|
*'''A.''' The Iraqi Transitional Government, and especially the Iraqi Property Claims Commission and other relevant bodies, shall act expeditiously to take measures to remedy the injustice caused by the previous regime’s practices in altering the demographic character of certain regions, including Kirkuk, by deporting and expelling individuals from their places of residence, forcing migration in and out of the region, settling individuals alien to the region, depriving the inhabitants of work, and correcting nationality.  To remedy this injustice, the [[Iraqi Transitional Government]] shall take the following steps:

:*'''1.''' With regard to residents who were deported, expelled, or who emigrated; it shall, in accordance with the statute of the Iraqi Property Claims Commission and other measures within the law, within a reasonable period of time, restore the residents to their homes and property, or, where this is unfeasible, shall provide just compensation.

:*'''2.''' With regard to the individuals newly introduced to specific regions and territories, it shall act in accordance with Article 10 of the Iraqi Property Claims Commission statute to ensure that such individuals may be resettled, may receive compensation from the state, may receive new land from the state near their residence in the governorate from which they came, or may receive compensation for the cost of moving to such areas.

:*'''3.''' With regard to persons deprived of employment or other means of support in order to force migration out of their regions and territories, it shall promote new employment opportunities in the regions and territories.

:*'''4.''' With regard to nationality correction, it shall repeal all relevant decrees and shall permit affected persons the right to determine their own national identity and ethnic affiliation free from coercion and duress.

*'''B.''' The previous regime also manipulated and changed administrative boundaries for political ends.  The [[Presidency Council of Iraq|Presidency Council]] of the Iraqi Transitional Government shall make recommendations to the [[Council of Representatives of Iraq|National Assembly]] on remedying these unjust changes in the [[Constitution of Iraq|permanent constitution]].  In the event the Presidency Council is unable to agree unanimously on a set of recommendations, it shall unanimously appoint a neutral arbitrator to examine the issue and make recommendations.  In the event the Presidency Council is unable to agree on an arbitrator, it shall request the [[Secretary General of the United Nations]] to appoint a distinguished international person to be the arbitrator.
*'''C.''' The permanent resolution of disputed territories, including Kirkuk, shall be deferred until after these measures are completed, a fair and transparent census has been conducted and the permanent constitution has been ratified. This resolution shall be consistent with the principle of justice, taking into account the will of the people of those territories.
|Article 58|[[Law of Administration for the State of Iraq for the Transitional Period]]}}

In 2005, a [[Constitution of Iraq|permanent Constitution]] was approved which referred back to the TAL and set a deadline of the end of 2007 for completion:

{{Quotation|
*'''First''': The executive authority shall undertake the necessary steps to complete the implementation of the requirements of all subparagraphs of Article 58 of the Transitional Administrative Law.
*'''Second:''' The responsibility placed upon the executive branch of the Iraqi Transitional Government stipulated in Article 58 of the Transitional Administrative Law shall extend and continue to the executive authority elected in accordance with this Constitution, provided that it accomplishes completely (normalization and census and concludes with a referendum in Kirkuk and other disputed territories to determine the will of their citizens), by a date not to exceed the 31st of December 2007.|Article 140|[[Constitution of Iraq]]}}

In late 2007, the [[Staffan de Mistura|U.N. Special Representative for Iraq]] negotiated an extension of the deadline for six months. However, the [[Council of Representatives of Iraq|federal parliament]] decided to refer the matter to the Constitutional Court to rule whether the article was now expired or how it should be implemented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=2711 Kirkuk's Article 140: Expired or Not?], ''Nazar Janabi'', [[Washington Institute for Near East Policy]], 31 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==De-Arabization==

Report on N. Iraq ''Washington Post'', April 17, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Government of Iraq from 2006|government]] of [[Nouri al-Maliki]] appointed a "Commission on the Normalisation of the Status of Kirkuk" to implement the de-arabization program. The Justice Minister, [[Hashim Abderrahman al-Shibli]], a secular Sunni Arab from the secular [[Iraqi National List]] coalition was appointed the head. A program of normalisation was to be followed by a census by July 2007 and a referendum in November 2007.

In April 2007, Turkish intelligence sources claimed that Kurdistan President Barzani had "''offered bribes to various Iraqi officials''" involved in the Commission, including $500,000 to al-Shibli.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/6312972_p.asp Turkish special rep. to Iraq brings documents showing "Barzani bribes" to the US], ''[[Hurriyet]]'', 2007-04-11, accessed on 14 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Turkey claimed that Iraqi Kurdistan was planning to annex Kirkuk "''illegally''", and that the rights of [[Iraqi Turkmen]] would be violated if Kirkuk joined Iraqi Kurdistan.

Shibli resigned as head of the Commission in March 2007, citing disagreements with his own coalition on Kirkuk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6514897.stm Iraq's justice minister resigns], ''[[BBC]]'', 2007-03-31, accessed on 14 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raed Fahmy Jahid]], another Sunni Arab from the INL was appointed his replacement in August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.industrywatch.com/pages/iw2/Story.nsp?ID=iw&amp;story_id=109002767&amp;scategory=Top%20Headlines&amp;VNC=hnall Profile of New Head of Iraqi Commission on Normalization of Kirkuk Status], ''[[BBC]] Monitoring'' via IndustryWatch, 2 August 2007 accessed on 5 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, the Commission adopted a controversial plan, which gave Sunni Arabs $15,000 to relocate back to their towns of origin, plus a plot of land in their new home.&lt;ref name=RFE/&gt;

In September 2007, it was reported that the normalization program had been bogged down in technical difficulties. The Kurdish parties were reported to have agreed a delay to the timetable for the census and referendum.&lt;ref name=RFE/&gt;

==International reactions==
*{{flag|Turkey}}
The Turkish government strongly opposed holding of the upcoming referendum in 2007, calling for it to be postponed. Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister [[Barham Salih]] said in a statement posted on the internet on 9 December 2006, "The issue of Kirkuk will be resolved in accordance with the Iraqi Constitution Article 140. Consequently, this constitutional question will be resolved by the Iraqis themselves. No one can interfere in that." On 10 December, in a speech made at the International Institute of Strategic Studies in [[Manama]], [[Bahrain]], Turkish Defense Minister Vecdi Gonul warned the Iraqi government against imposing an "unrealistic" future on Kirkuk. Iraqi Foreign Minister [[Hoshyar Zebari]] criticized Gonul, saying, "You speak of Kirkuk as if it is a Turkish city. These are matters for Iraq to decide."&lt;ref name=DELAY/&gt;

*{{flag|United States}}
The [[Iraq Study Group]] of senior American politicians recommended that the referendum be delayed "''to avert communal violence given the very dangerous situation in Kirkuk''".

* {{flag|Iran}}

[[Iran]] called for a delay of two years for political reasons in early November 2007.&lt;ref name=iran/&gt;

* {{flag|Saudi Arabia}}

[[Saudi Arabia]] reportedly offered the Iraqi Kurdish leaders [[USD|$]]2 billion in exchange for delaying the process for ten years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.monstersandcritics.com/middleeast/news/article_1286353.php/Saudi_Arabia_offers_Kurds_2_billion_dollars_to_give_up_Kirkuk Saudi Arabia offers Kurds 2 billion dollars to give up Kirkuk], ''Middle East Online'', 2007-04-03, accessed on 1 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mediation==

In June 2008 the [[UNAMI]] head, [[Staffan de Mistura]] recommended that the [[Akra District]] of [[Ninawa Governorate]] and the [[Makhmur, Iraq|Makhmur]] District of [[Kirkuk Governorate]] be incorporated into Kurdistan but that the [[al-Hamdaniya]] area of [[Ninawa Governorate]] and the [[Mandali, Iraq|Mandali]] area of [[Diyala Governorate]] be excluded. These recommendations were rejected by the [[Council of Representatives of Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kurdishglobe.net/displayArticle.jsp?id=2DB0ABD40DA3B0E0BD6EABEBC524BC99 Iraqi Kurds await U.N. regional recommendations], ''Kurdish Globe'', 12 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''maternal mortality ratio''' is a [[key performance indicator]] for efforts to improve the health and safety of mothers before, during, and after childbirth per country worldwide. Often referred to as MMR, it is the annual number of female deaths per 100,000 live births from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes). It is not to be confused with the [[maternal mortality rate]], which is the number of maternal deaths (direct and indirect) in a given period per 100,000 women of reproductive age during the same time period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pop.org/content/definitions-maternal-mortality Maternal Mortality Ratio vs Maternal Mortality Rate] on [[Population Research Institute]] website&lt;/ref&gt; The statistics are gathered by [[World Health Organization|WHO]], [[UNICEF]], [[UNFPA]], [[World Bank Group]], and the [[United Nations Population Division]].&lt;ref name=Worldbank&gt;[http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.STA.MMRT Maternal mortality ratio (modeled estimate, per 100,000 live births)] on website of [[The World Bank]]&lt;/ref&gt; The yearly report started in 1990 and is called ''Trends in Maternal Mortality''.&lt;ref name=Worldbank/&gt; As of the 2015 data published in 2016, the countries that have seen an increase in the maternal mortality ratio since 1990 are the Bahamas, Georgia, Guyana, Jamaica, Dem. People’s Rep. Korea, Serbia, South Africa, St. Lucia, Suriname, Tonga, [[maternal mortality in the United States|United States]], Venezuela, RB Zimbabwe. But  according to Sustainable Development Goals report 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2018/overview/|title=Decline in Maternal Mortality Rate|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the overall maternal mortality ratio has declined by 37 percent since 2002. Nearly 303,000 women died due to complications during pregnancy. 

With an exceptionally high mortality ratio compared to other U.S. states, the government of Texas created the  [[Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Task Force]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/gho/maternal_health/countries/usa.pdf US Maternal Health Profile] on WHO website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://legiscan.com/TX/bill/SB495/2013 Senate Bill 495, 83rd Legislature, Regular Session, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, a Pakistani Muslim woman shared her experiences on Facebook of sexual abuse at the Hajj. The post was subsequently deleted, but not before it had been seen by enough people to trigger more experiences being shared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2018/02/15/mosquemetoo-what-happened-when-i-was-sexually-assaulted-during-the-hajj/|title=Opinion {{!}} #MosqueMeToo: What happened when I was sexually assaulted during the hajj|last=Eltahawy|first=Mona|date=2018-02-15|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-02-23|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Mona Eltahawy]], an Egyptian American journalist, shared her experiences of sexual abuse on Hajj in a book in 1982, which were retweeted in February using the hashtag #MosqueMeToo &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/monaeltahawy/status/960644697067749376|title=I am glad to see women are speaking out about being sexually harassed during Hajj.

This photograph shows the theatre prior to the 1943 Luftwaffe bombardment and its subsequent destruction during World War II.]]

The '''Municipal Theatre of Corfu''' ({{lang-el|Δημοτικό Θέατρο Κέρκυρας}}) was the main [[theatre]] and [[opera house]] in [[Corfu]], [[Greece]], from 1902 to 1943.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"&gt;Municipality of Corfu Official Website. (2008) ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070623224051/http://www.corfu.gr/en/profil/theatro.htm History of the municipal theatre via the Internet Archive]'' (writing, "The Municipal Theatre was not only an Art-monument but also a historical one. On its premises the exiled Serbian parliament, the Skoupsina, held up meetings in 1916, which decided the creation of the new Unified Kingdom of Yugoslavia.") Accessed 29 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre was the successor of the [[Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù]], which became the Corfu [[city hall]]. It was destroyed during a [[Luftwaffe]] [[airstrike|aerial bombardment]] in 1943.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; During its 41-year history it was one of the premier theatres and opera houses in [[Greece]].

== History and architecture ==

The Municipal theatre was built to accommodate the demands of a growing audience.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; The decision for its construction was taken in 1885, during the mayoralty of [[Georgios Theotokis]], and construction started in 1893 by mayor Michael Theotokis.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; High construction 
costs delayed its inaugural opening until 1902.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; The architect was the Italian Conrado Pergolesi who developed plans modelled after [[La Scala]] in [[Milan]].&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; The maximum height of the theatre was 39 meters; there was a gallery at the front entrance adorned by high columns of the [[Tuscan order]].&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; The entrance featured large purple [[column]]s and its high walls were decorated with [[fresco]]es of famous [[composer]]s created by Italian artists.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; The upper floor was decorated by four [[Corinthian order]] semi-columns and a [[gable]].&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; The official [[emblem]] [[shield]] of Corfu stood in [[relief]] at the centre of the gable surrounded by a [[laurel wreath]].&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt;

[[File:Municipal Theatre of Corfu interior.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The interior of the Municipal Theatre of Corfu. The three ascending levels (rows) of boxes are visible; the gallery is on the fourth level at the top of the picture.]]

The auditorium included 64 decorated boxes arranged in three levels and a gallery for the general public at the top.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; The first box in the first row was reserved for the theatre committee.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; Behind this box, inside an office, the archives of [[Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù|Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo]] were kept.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; The first box of the second row was reserved for the Greek royal family.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; All boxes included [[gas light]]s at their bow.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; The [[commoner]]s gathered at the top level in the gallery.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt;  There was a [[proscenium]] which accommodated the [[orchestra]].&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; The orchestra was mainly made up of locals and it performed 10 operas per cycle.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; Opera season started in September and ended on the Sunday before [[Ash Monday]].&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt;

The [[stage curtain]] of the new theatre was inherited from its predecessor, Teatro di San Giacomo, and was created by an Italian artist.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; It depicted a scene from the ''[[Odyssey]]'' where [[Odysseus]] was welcomed by King [[Alcinous]] to the land of the [[Phaiax|Phaiakes]].&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt;

[[File:Stage curtain of San Giacomo.jpg|thumb|200px|The historic stage curtain of Teatro di San Giacomo depicting a scene from the [[Odyssey]]. It is the only artefact known to have survived the bombardment.]]

The theatre was considered one of [[Europe]]'s best, with great [[acoustics]] and richly decorated interiors depicting ancient [[Greek gods]] and musical themes, painted by Italian artists.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; It also functioned as a social gathering place where [[Upper class|high society]] gathered for [[dance]]s and [[Ball (dance)|balls]].&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; Its official opening date was 7 December 1902, with [[Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' as the inaugural performance.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] also attended performances while vacationing at his [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]] palace.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; In 1907 the [[Philharmonic Society of Corfu|Old Philharmonic of Corfu]] rendered a [[symphony]] in a performance which received much acclaim from the audience.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt;

From 19 January 1916 through to 19 November 1918,&lt;ref name="Embassy"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071126022238/http://www.embassyofserbia.gr/Krf/KrfEng.htm Official Website of the Serbian Embassy in Athens Greece] Corfu page Quote: "By a kind gesture of the local Greek authorities, the sessions of the Serbian National Assembly were held in the National theatre of Corfu from 19 January 1916 through to 19 November 1918."

The archives of the theatre, including the historical San Giacomo archives, all valuables and art were destroyed in the bombing with the sole exception of the stage curtain, which was not in the premises the night of the bombing and thus escaped harm; among the losses are believed to have been numerous manuscripts of the work of [[Spyridon Xyndas]], composer of the first opera in Greek.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; The remains of the building were considered to be without historical or other value and were condemned following a decision by the supervising [[architect]] Ioannis Kollas and [[civil engineer]]s Georgios Linardos and Renos Paipetis.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; On 31 May 1952, mayor Stamatis Desyllas and the [[city council]] unanimously decided to [[demolition|demolish]] the theatre despite widespread public [[protests]] and [[lawsuit|legal challenges]].&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt;

'''Operation ''Hannibal''''' was a [[Military history of Germany during World War II|German]] naval operation involving the evacuation by sea of German troops and civilians from [[Courland Pocket|Courland]], [[Evacuation of East Prussia|East Prussia]], and the [[Polish Corridor]] from mid-January to May 1945 as the [[Red Army]] advanced during the [[East Prussian Offensive|East Prussian]] and [[East Pomeranian Offensive]]s and subsidiary operations.

The Soviet East Prussian Offensive by the [[Red Army]]'s [[3rd Belarusian Front]] under General [[Ivan Chernyakhovsky]] commenced on January 13, 1945 and, with Marshal [[Konstantin Rokossovsky|Konstantin Rokossovsky's]] [[2nd Belorussian Front]], subsequently cut off East Prussia between January 23 and February 10, 1945. German Grand Admiral [[Karl Dönitz]] ordered General Admiral [[Oskar Kummetz]], as Naval High Commander, Baltic, and Rear Admiral Konrad Engelhardt, head of the [[Kriegsmarine|Kriegsmarine's]] shipping department, to plan and execute the ''Rettungsaktion'' (evacuation operation).&lt;ref&gt;Koburger, Charles W., ''Steel Ships, Iron Crosses, and Refugees'', Praeger Publishers, NY, 1989, p.71.&lt;/ref&gt; Dönitz radioed a message to [[Gdynia]] in [[German-occupied Poland|occupied Poland]] on January 23, 1945, to begin evacuations to ports outside of the Soviet area of operations. The operation was codenamed ''[[Hannibal]]''. Dönitz stated in his post-war memoirs that his aim had been to evacuate as many people as possible away from the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;Dönitz, Karl, ''Memoirs, Ten Years and Twenty Days'', Da Capo Press, NY, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Right up until his suicide, [[Adolf Hitler]] insisted that the war go on. The flood of military personnel and German civilians eventually turned the operation into one of the largest evacuations by sea in history. Over a period of 15 weeks, somewhere between 494 and 1,080 merchant vessels of all types, including fishing boats and other craft,&lt;ref&gt;Williams, David, ''Wartime Disasters at Sea'', Patrick Stephens Limited, Nr Yeovil, UK, 1997, p.225 (figure of 494 merchant vessels); Brustat-Naval, Fritz, ''Unternehmen Rettung'', Koehlers Verlagsgeschellshaft, Herford, Germany, 1985, p.240 (figure of 790 vessels of all types); Koburger, Charles W., ''Steel Ships, Iron Crosses, and Refugees'', Praeger Publishers, NY, 1989, p.92 (figure of 1,080 merchant vessels).&lt;/ref&gt; and utilizing Germany's largest remaining naval units, carried between 800,000 and 900,000 German civilians and 350,000 soldiers&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Kossert, ''Damals in Ostpreussen'', München, 2008, p.160 {{ISBN|978-3-421-04366-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; across the [[Baltic Sea]] to Germany and German-occupied [[Occupation of Denmark|Denmark]]. This was more than three times the number of people evacuated in the nine-day operation at [[Dunkirk evacuation|Dunkirk]].

She was torpedoed and sunk by the Soviet submarine [[Soviet submarine S-13|''S-13'']] off the Pomeranian coast, with possibly as many as 9,500 fatalities. Those on ''Walter Rau'' eventually made it to [[Eckernförde]].

On February 9, [[SS General von Steuben|''Steuben'']] sailed from [[Pillau]] with between 3,000 and 4,000 mostly military personnel on board, heading for [[Swinemünde]]. She was also sunk by ''S-13'', just after midnight; only 300 survived.

In early March, a task force composed of the [[heavy cruiser]] ''[[German cruiser Admiral Scheer|Admiral Scheer]]'' accompanied by three [[German World War II destroyers|destroyers]] and the  [[Elbing-class torpedo boat|''Elbing''-class]] [[torpedo boat]] {{ship|German torpedo boat|T36||2}} were giving cover to a German bridgehead near [[Wollin]]. During that operation, naval small craft evacuated over 75,000 soldiers and civilians who had been isolated in that area. They were taken to larger warships and other transports lying offshore. While a number of these transports were sunk, large liners such as [[SS Deutschland (1923)|''Deutschland'']] got through and carried up to 11,000 soldiers and civilians each.

During the night of April 4–5, a flotilla of small boats and landing craft evacuated over 30,000 soldiers and civilians from ''Oxhöfter Kämpe'' and took them to [[Hel Peninsula|Hela]]. It is estimated that nearly 265,000 people were evacuated from [[Danzig]] (modern Gdańsk) to Hela during the month of April alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://compunews.com/s13/hannibal.htm |title=Operation Hannibal, January – May 1945 |publisher=Compunews.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 15, another large convoy consisting of four liners and other transports left Hela with over 20,000 soldiers and civilians. On April 16, the [[MV Goya|''Goya'']] was torpedoed and sunk by [[soviet submarine L-3|''L-3'']], with the loss of over 6,000 lives; 183 survived.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2004-0127, Ausschiffung von Flüchtlingen.jpg|thumb |Evacuees arriving at a western harbor, already occupied by British troops]]

Initially, on his becoming Reich President on May 1, [[Karl Dönitz]] was determined to continue the war, going so far as to instruct Colonel General [[Carl Hilpert]] that combat troops would have priority in evacuation to Germany from the [[Courland Pocket]]. It wasn't until the afternoon of May 6, with British troops practically on his doorstep, that he gave up on that plan.&lt;ref&gt;Grier, Howard D., ''Hitler/Donitz and the Baltic Sea'', Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, MD, 2007, p.201.&lt;/ref&gt;

From May 1 to May 8, over 150,000 people were evacuated from the beaches of Hela. At 21:00 on May 8, 1945, the last day of the war, a convoy consisting of 92 large and small vessels left the [[Latvia]]n city of [[Liepāja]] ({{lang-de|Libau}}) with 18,000 soldiers and civilians.&lt;ref&gt;Bekker, Cajus, ''Defeat at Sea'', Henry Holt and Co., 1955, p.198.&lt;/ref&gt; While several hundred of those who had boarded small ships on the last day of the war or after were captured by Soviet MTBs, evacuations to the west continued for at least a week after all such movements were prohibited by the terms of the [[German Instrument of Surrender|German surrender]].

=== Shortages ===
Shortages plagued the Operation with food and medicine being seen as primary issues for the Nazi administration, causing a trend of elderly and very young children to die on board the rescue ships.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other shortages included only a three-week supply of coal remaining for the sea transport tasks and only a ten-day supply for rail transports to move troops to the front, with fuel being at its lowest levels since the war began.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Losses==
In addition to the [[MV Goya|''Goya'']], [[MV Wilhelm Gustloff|''Wilhelm Gustloff'']], and [[SS General von Steuben|''General von Steuben'']], 158 other merchant vessels were lost during the 15-week course of Operation ''Hannibal'' (January 23 – May 8, 1945).&lt;ref&gt;Koburger, p.107&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The PeaceOUT (World) Homo Hop Festival''', was an annual festival of [[hip hop music]] and [[culture]] created by [[Lesbian]], [[Gay]], [[Bisexual]], and [[Transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) people from 2001 to 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

''[[Bay Area Reporter]]'', September 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The festival was first held in August 2001 (and was known as "Cypher") as a part of the East Bay (Oakland) LGBT Pride, following the suggestion of East Bay (Oakland) Pride organizer Pete King.&lt;ref name=bar /&gt; Though King was not a fan of hip hop music or culture, he was familiar with the numerous out queer hip hop artists performing in the San Francisco Bay Area and felt the growing scene was an important component of the LGBT arts community. In June 2001, King approached [[Juba Kalamka]] of the group [[Deep Dickollective]] about his ideas (including naming the event "PeaceOUT") and inquired as to the possibility of organizing the event.

Though at first reticent as a result of what he viewed as racial and class antagonism toward hip hop at mainstream pride events, Kalamka eventually relented, which led to the organization of "Cypher 2000:One" by his Deep Dickollective bandmate [[Tim'm West]] and London-based DJ Christopher "Mister Maker" Harvey, who founded the [[Gayhiphop.com]] website in 2000.

The success of the event led to plans to create a larger scale event in 2002. East Bay Pride sponsored the event until its own dissolution after PeaceOUT 2003, at which time main financial sponsorship and organization was coordinated by Kalamka's micro-label [[Sugartruck Recordings]] and [[Matt Wobensmith]] of the zine and record label [[Outpunk]] and later the [[Queercorps]] imprint.

Among the performers who appeared at the festival were [[Deep Dickollective]], [[Katastrophe (rapper)|Katastrophe]], [[Tori Fixx]], [[God-des and She]], [[Deadlee]], Jen-Ro, Jaycub Perez, [[Cazwell]] and [[soce, the elemental wizard]].&lt;ref name=sfgate&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/They-re-here-they-re-queer-and-they-homohop-Gay-2590201.php "They're here, they're queer and they homohop. Gay and lesbian artists, long rejected by mainstream rappers, are stretching the genre's boundaries."]. ''[[SFGate]]'', September 10, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous performances from the festival are featured in the documentary film ''[[Pick Up the Mic]]'', which premiered at the [[2005 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 11, 2005.&lt;ref name=sfgate /&gt;

Despite initial plans to continue with PeaceOUT as a biannual event following the 2007 festival, Kalamka decided to close the event permanently in July 2008. The official website is currently maintained as a permanent historical archive of the festival.

{{Campaignbox Wars of the Hongwu Emperor}}
The '''Red Turban Rebellion''' ({{zh|t=紅巾起義|p=Hóngjīn Qǐyì}}) was an uprising influenced by [[White Lotus Society]] members that, between 1351 and 1368, targeted the ruling [[Mongol|Mongol]]-led [[Yuan dynasty]], eventually leading to the overthrow of Mongol rule in [[China]].

== Causes ==
Since the 1340s the [[Mongol]]-led [[Yuan dynasty]] experienced problems. The [[Yellow River]] flooded constantly, and other natural disasters also occurred. At the same time the Yuan dynasty required considerable military expenditure to maintain its vast empire.&lt;ref name = "guide"&gt;[http://www.travelchinaguide.com/intro/history/yuan/index.htm Yuan Dynasty: Ancient China Dynasties, paragraph 3.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[bubonic plague]] (aka "Black Death") also contributed to the birth of the movement. Other groups or religious sects made an effort to undermine the power of the last Yuan Mongol rulers; these religious movements often warned of impending doom.

== The Red Turban Army ==
[[White Lotus Rebellion|The Red Turban Army]] (紅巾軍) was originally started by followers of the [[White Lotus]] with a mix of [[Dharmic]] [[Religion in China|Chinese religions]]; such as [[Benzhuism]], [[Bimoism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Confucism]], [[Dongbaism]], [[Mohism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Wuism]]; and [[Gnostic]] [[Assyrian religion|Assyrian religions]]; such as [[Chinese Manichaeism|Manichaeism]] (明教 ''Míngjiào''), [[Mandaeanism]], [[Sabianism]] and [[Zoroastrianism]]; was founded by [[Guo Zixing]] (郭子興) to resist the Mongols. The name "Red Turban" was used because of their tradition of using red banners and wearing red [[turban]]s to distinguish themselves.

These rebellions began on a sporadic basis, first on the coast of [[Zhejiang]] when [[Fang Guozhen]] and his men assaulted a group of Yuan officials. After that, the White Lotus society led by [[Han Shantong]] in the north of the Yellow River became the centre of anti-Mongol sentiment. A few rebel groups crossed the [[Yalu River]] from their base in [[Liaoning]] to capture [[Pyongyang]] on the [[Korean Peninsula]]. This invasion [[Red Turban invasions of Goryeo|was repelled]] by [[Goryeo]], under generals [[Choe Yeong]] and  [[Yi Seonggye]].

In 1351 the society plotted an armed rebellion, but it was disclosed and Han Shantong was arrested and executed by the Yuan government. After his death [[Liu Futong]] (劉福通), a prominent member of the White Lotus, assisted Han's son, [[Han Lin'er]] (韓林兒), in succeeding his father and establishing the Red Turban Army. After that, several other Han rebels in the south of the [[Yangtze River]] revolted under the name of the Southern Red Turbans. Among the key leaders of the Southern Red Turbans were [[Xu Shouhui]] and [[Chen Youliang]]. The rebellion was also supported by the leadership of [[Peng Yingyu]] (彭瑩玉; 1338) and [[Zou Pusheng]] (鄒普勝; 1351).

== Conclusion ==
{{main|Hongwu Emperor}}
[[File:Shaolinstele.jpg|thumb|Shaolin monk fighting against the Red Turban rebels.]]

One of the more significant Red Turban leaders was [[Zhu Yuanzhang]]. At first he followed Guo Zixing, and in fact married Guo's stepdaughter. After Guo's death, Zhu was seen as his successor and took over Guo's army.

Between 1356 and 1367 Zhu began a series of [[military campaign|campaigns]] seeking to defeat his opponents in the Red Turbans. At first he nominally supported [[Han Lin'er]] to stabilize his northern frontier. Then he defeated rivals [[Chen Youliang]], [[Zhang Shicheng]] and Fang Guozhen one by one. After rising to dominance, he drowned Han Lin'er. Calling to overthrow the Mongols and restore the [[Han Chinese]], Zhu gained popular support.

In 1368 Zhu Yuanzhang proclaimed himself emperor in [[Nanjing|Yingtian]], historically known as the [[Hongwu Emperor]] of the [[Ming dynasty]]. The next year the Ming army captured [[Beijing|Dadu]], and the rule of the Mongol Yuan dynasty was officially over. China was unified once again under the Han Chinese.

Historical records commonly portray the Red Turban Army as dealing with captive Yuan officials and soldiers with considerable violence. In his work on violence in rural China, [[William T. Rowe]] writes:&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, William. ''Crimson Rain: Seven Centuries of Violence in a Chinese County.'' 2006. p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Red Army brutally killed every Yuan official it could lay its hands on: in one instance, the ''Yuan shi'' reports, the army flayed an official alive and cut out his stomach. The Red Army was equally merciless toward captured Yuan soldiers: according to contemporary observer Liu Renben, Tianwan troops dealt with these demonized enemies by "placing them in shackles, poking them with knives, binding them with cloth, putting sacks over their heads, and parading them around accompanied by drum-beating and derisive chants."}}

The '''Royalty Theatre''' was a small London theatre situated at 73 [[Dean Street]], [[Soho]], which opened in 1840 as Miss Kelly's Theatre and Dramatic School and finally closed to the public in 1938.&lt;ref name=Lloyd&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Royalty.htm Royalty Theatre] at the Arthur Lloyd site accessed 23 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The architect was [[Samuel Beazley]].  The theatre's opening was ill-fated, and it was little used for a decade. It changed its name twice and was used by an opera company, amateur drama companies and for French pieces.

In 1861, it was renamed the '''New Royalty Theatre''', and the next year it was leased by Mrs [[Charles Selby]], who enlarged it from 200 seats to about 650. The theatre continued to change hands frequently. In the 1860s, it featured [[F. C. Burnand]]'s [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] of ''[[Black-Eyed Susan]]'', which ran for nearly 500 nights, and a burlesque by [[W. S. Gilbert]], ''[[The Merry Zingara]]''. The theatre was managed by [[Henrietta Hodson]] during the early 1870s, who also produced mostly burlesques and comedies, including Gilbert's ''[[The Realm of Joy]]'' and ''Ought We to Visit Her?'' On 25 March 1875 the Royalty, under the direction of [[Selina Dolaro]], enjoyed an historic success with ''[[Trial by Jury]]''.

In 1877, [[Kate Santley]] took control of the theatre, running it for nearly 30 years. She had the theatre rebuilt and it reopened in 1883. In this period, it featured opera-bouffes adapted from the French. M. L. Mayer and plays in French. It was increasingly hard for the theatre to compete with larger new London theatres. In 1891, the theatre started a policy of modern drama, presenting plays by [[Ibsen]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]]. When the theatre finally had a great success, with ''[[Charley's Aunt]]'' in 1892, its popularity led to its transference after only a month to a larger theatre. In 1895–96 the theatre underwent another renovation.  [[Arthur Bourchier]]'s ''The Chili Widow'' ran for over 300 nights. In the new century, [[Mrs. Patrick Campbell]] played at the theatre. After another renovation in 1906, [[Sarah Bernhardt]] led her own company in a season. In 1912, ''Milestones'', by [[Arnold Bennett]] and [[Edward Knoblauch]] had over 600 performances. ''[[The Man Who Stayed at Home (1914 play)|The Man Who Stayed at Home]]'' played for 584 performances.

[[The Co-Optimists]] played at the theatre after the war as did [[Noël Coward]]'s ''[[The Vortex]]''. In 1932, ''[[While Parents Sleep]]'' was a hit. The theatre closed in 1938 and was demolished in 1953.

==Origins==
The actress Frances Maria "Fanny" Kelly (1790–1882), used the fortune saved from her highly popular career to establish a dramatic academy with a 200-seat theatre attached.&lt;ref&gt;An earlier theatre, also named the Royalty, existed in Wells Street, [[Wellclose Square]], London from 1787 until the early part of the nineteenth century.

The theatre and school were completed in 1837.&lt;ref name=Pitt&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=41093 ''The Pitt Estate in Dean Street: The Royalty Theatre''], [[Survey of London]]: volumes 33 and 34: St Anne Soho (1966), pp. 215-21 accessed: 23 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Kelley's engineer friend, [[Rowland Macdonald Stephenson]], persuaded her to build into the theatre new machinery that he had invented to move the stage and scenery; theoretically a significant step forward in theatre technology.&lt;ref name=Ellacott&gt;Ellacott, Vivyan. [http://www.overthefootlights.co.uk/18.pdf "An A-Z Encyclopaedia of London Theatres and Music Halls"], Over the Footlights, accessed 16 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It took more than two years to install the machinery in the theatre. The theatre was "obscurely sited [and] perilously combustible", but it had "a relatively spacious stage, and Beazley's work in the auditorium was thought pretty."&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' described the fashionable little theatre as "most elegantly fitted up and appointed, and painted in a light tasteful manner."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 27 May 1840&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
It turned out that the machinery was too heavy to be worked by people, and Stephenson had to use a horse. On the opening night, 25 May 1840, three pieces were presented: ''Summer and Winter'', by [[Morris Barnett]]; a melodrama, ''The Sergeant's Wife''; and a farce, ''The Midnight Hour''. The opening was unsuccessful, and within a week the theatre was closed. Kelly's high admission charges of five or seven shillings did not help, but the main problem was that the tramping of the horse and the roar of the machinery drowned out the voices of the actors and caused the building to vibrate. The theatre had to be demolished to remove the machinery. After it was rebuilt, Kelly reopened the theatre in February 1841, at reduced prices, for a season of her own monologues, but then became ill.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt; She sought to lease the theatre, but it was empty for long periods and was used mostly for amateur productions, including one of [[Charles Dickens]]'s productions. Within a decade, Kelly had lost her entire fortune and was evicted from the property.&lt;ref name=Ellacott/&gt;

In January 1850 the theatre was reopened as the '''Royal Soho Theatre''', after redecoration by W. W. Deane and S. J. Nicholl, changing its name to the '''New English Opera House''' from November 1850,&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt; and in the following year an entrance portico was built. Various types of productions played at the theatre, including English [[Grand Opera]].  Performances were mostly by amateurs, hiring the theatre at standard rates. At other times, as the '''Theatre Français''', it attracted patrons chiefly among the foreigners in Soho.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt;

[[File:Sadness, by Julia Margaret Cameron.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Ellen Terry at 16 in 1864.]]
In 1861, the direction of the theatre was assumed by Albina di Rhona, a Serbian ballerina and comic actress. She renamed it the '''New Royalty Theatre''', and had it altered and redecorated by "M. Bulot, of Paris, Decorator in Ordinary to his Imperial Majesty, Louis Napoleon", with "cut-glass lustres, painted panels, blue satin draperies and gold mouldings".&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt; In the opening programme, di Rhona danced, the leader of the Boston Brass Band from America played a bugle solo, and a melodrama, ''Atar Gull'', was performed, with a 14-year-old [[Ellen Terry]] in the cast. Still, the reopening was not a success.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt;

In 1862, the theatre was leased by, Mrs [[Charles Selby]], who also ran an acting school. She enlarged the original theatre to accommodate about 650 people. She used it to showcase her pupils and occasionally rented it to others.&lt;ref name=Ellacott/&gt; The theatre continued to change hands frequently.  It was managed, from 1866 to 1870, by [[Martha Cranmer Oliver]], who featured mostly [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]], including [[F. C. Burnand]]'s burlesque of ''[[Black-Eyed Susan]]'', which ran for nearly 500 nights, and a burlesque by [[W. S. Gilbert]], ''[[The Merry Zingara]]''. The theatre was managed by [[Henrietta Hodson]] during the early 1870s. She also produced mostly burlesques and comedies, including Gilbert's ''[[The Realm of Joy]]'' and ''Ought We to Visit her?'' In 1872, it became known as the '''Royalty Theatre''' and retained this name (although it was occasionally known as the New Royalty Theatre).&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt;

On 25 March 1875 the theatre, under the direction of Madame [[Selina Dolaro]], enjoyed an historic success with ''[[Trial by Jury]]'', the first [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] opera produced by [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]]. It premiered together with [[Jacques Offenbach]]'s ''[[La Périchole]]'' and another one-act farce, ''[[Cryptoconchoidsyphonostomata]]''.  Carte soon moved his Gilbert and Sullivan company to another theatre.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt; In January 1876 at the Royalty, [[Pauline Rita]] appeared under Carte's management as Gustave Muller in ''The Duke's Daughter''.&lt;ref name=Whos&gt;Stone, David. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/R/RitaPauline.htm Pauline Rita] at ''Who was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company'', 27 August 2001, accessed 7 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Santley years==
In 1877, [[Kate Santley]] "seems to have acquired the head lease." She controlled the theatre for nearly 30 years.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt; Carte joined forces with Santley in January 1877 to present ''Lischen and Fritzen'', [[Jacques Offenbach]]’s ''Orpheus in the Underworld'', and Carte's own operetta, ''Happy Hampstead'' written with his secretary, [[Frank Desprez]]. Later that year, the First Chief Officer of the [[London Fire Brigade]] strongly recommended that the theatre be closed.  Santley had the theatre rebuilt, hiring architect [[Thomas Verity]], who provided additional exits, and it reopened in 1883, with Santley receiving praise for the renovations.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt; Many of the productions in these years were opera-bouffes adapted from the French.  M. L. Mayer, formerly of the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]], staged twice-yearly seasons of plays in French.  The Coquelins and other luminaries of the [[Comédie-Française]] appeared here in the 1880s, when the Royalty was 'the recognized home of the Parisian drama.'&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt; The opening of [[Shaftesbury Avenue]] and of larger new theatres in that neighbourhood, including the [[Lyric Theatre (London)|Lyric Theatre]] and the [[Apollo Theatre]], drew audiences away from the Royalty, and in the 1890s the Royalty was not prospering.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt;

[[File:MrsPatrickCampbell-pre1897.jpg|thumb|left|Mrs. Patrick Campbell]]
In 1891, the theatre started a policy of modern drama. [[Ibsen]]'s ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' premièred, to predictable outrage, at the theatre, in a single private London performance on 13 March 1891. The [[Lord Chamberlain's Office]] censorship was avoided by the formation of a subscription-only [[Independent Theatre Society]], which included [[Thomas Hardy]] and [[Henry James]] among its members.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/lma_learning/theatreland/timelines19.asp#1869 ''Theatreland Timeline'' (London Metropolitan Archives)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101092221/https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/lma_learning/theatreland/timelines19.asp |date=1 November 2007 }} accessed 11 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Again, for the Society, [[George Bernard Shaw]] premièred ''[[Widowers' Houses]]'', his first play, here the following year.&lt;ref name=Glimpse&gt;[http://www.wayneturney.20m.com/independenttheatre.htm ''The Independent Theatre''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206143200/http://wayneturney.20m.com/independenttheatre.htm |date=6 February 2009 }} (A Glimpse of Theatre History), accessed 15 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; When the theatre finally had a great success, with [[Brandon Thomas]]’s play ''[[Charley's Aunt]]'' in 1892, its popularity led to its transference after only a month to the larger [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]].&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt;

In 1895–96 the Royalty's manager was [[Arthur Bourchier]], and the theatre underwent another renovation, by architect [[Walter Emden]].  Bourchier produced, among other plays, ''The Chili Widow'', an adaptation of his own that ran for over 300 nights.  In 1899, the first production of the [[Incorporated Stage Society]] took place with the first performance of Shaw's ''[[You Never Can Tell (play)|You Never Can Tell]]''.  In 1900–01 [[Mrs. Patrick Campbell]] hired the theatre and staged a succession of contemporary plays in which she starred, and in 1903–04 Hans Andresen and Max Behrend presented a successful season of German theatre.  Also in 1904, the newly founded Irish National Theatre Society gave plays by [[W. B. Yeats]] and, in 1905, it presented an early performance of [[John Millington Synge|Synge]]'s first play, ''The Shadow of the Glen''.  In addition, Philip Carr's Mermaid Society produced Elizabethan and Jacobean plays.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt;

==Later years==
Again, the theatre was threatened with closure by the authorities, but Santley had it rebuilt again in 1906 to meet safety requirements.&lt;ref name=Ellacott/&gt; After redecoration in French Regency style, which increased the capacity of the theatre to 657 seats,&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt; the Royalty reopened on 4 January 1906 with a season of Theatre Français directed by Gaston Mayer.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt; [[Sarah Bernhardt]] led her own company in ''La Tosca, Phedre'' and ''La Dame aux Camelias'' in 1907.&lt;ref name=Ellacott/&gt; In 1911, [[J. E. Vedrenne]] and [[Dennis Eadie]] acquired the theatre, and in 1912, they staged ''Milestones'', by [[Arnold Bennett]] and [[Edward Knoblock|Edward Knoblauch]] (later Knoblock), which had over 600 performances.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt; [[Owen Nares]], [[Gladys Cooper]] [[Lynn Fontanne]] appeared at the theatre early in their careers.&lt;ref name=Ellacott/&gt; ''[[The Man Who Stayed at Home (1914 play)|The Man Who Stayed at Home]]'' was a hit at the Royalty in 1914, playing for 584 performances.&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt; [[Henry Daniell]] starred as Bobby Gilmour in ''The Man from Toronto'' at the theatre in May 1918.

A post-war success was the concert-party entertainment, ''The Co-Optimists'', first staged in 1921.  The year 1924 saw the first [[West End Theatre|West End]] production at the theatre of [[Noël Coward]]'s ''The Vortex.'' ''[[Juno and the Paycock]]'' was mounted in 1925, and Ibsen's ''Pillars of Society'' played in 1926.&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt; Another hit for the Royalty was in 1932 with ''While Parents Sleep''.  By 1936 the danger of fire from celluloid stores and other adjacent properties overrided the argument made to the [[Lord Chamberlain]] that the theatre had been on the site before the development of the inflammatory trades nearby. [[J. B. Priestley]]'s ''[[I Have Been Here Before]]'' was the theatre's last success. The last performance was given at a matinee on 25 November 1938, by the Southern Cross Players.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt;

Although several schemes were considered for its rebuilding, but with the growing threat of war, the theatre remained empty and soon became derelict. It was damaged in the [[World War II]] [[The Blitz|Blitz]].&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt;  The Royalty was demolished in 1953 and a block of offices, Royalty House, was erected on the site.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt;

A modern Royalty Theatre was opened in the basement of an office block at Portugal Street near [[Aldwych]] in 1960. This was bought by the London School of Economics and renamed the [[Peacock Theatre]] in 1996. It is a lecture hall by day and a venue for the [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]] company by night.

"'''She's Out of My Life'''" is a song written by American songwriter [[Tom Bahler]] and performed by American singer [[Michael Jackson]]. The song was released as the fourth [[Single (music)|single]] from Jackson's [[1979 in music|1979]] album ''[[Off the Wall]]''. In 2004, the song appeared in ''[[The Ultimate Collection (Michael Jackson album)|The Ultimate Collection]]''. It peaked at number 10 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], marking the first time any solo artist had ever achieved four Top 10 hits from one album.  In America, it earned a million-selling [[Gold certification|Gold]] 45. Unlike the album's previous singles, which were all uptempo [[Dance music|dance]]-oriented [[funk]] and [[disco]] songs, "She's Out of My Life"  was an emotional ballad. The song has a tempo of 66 beats per minute, making it one of Jackson's slowest songs.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Michael Jackson'', International Music Publications Ltd, 1997, {{ISBN|1859094473}}, p77&lt;/ref&gt;

The song is about a painful breakup. It has been claimed that Bahler wrote the song about [[Karen Carpenter]], whom Bahler had briefly dated. However, he has stated, "The fact is, I had already written that song by the time Karen and I became romantic. That song was written more about [[John Davidson (entertainer)|Rhonda Rivera]]... Rhonda and I had been together for two years, and it was after we broke up that I started dating Karen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Little Girl Blue: The Life of Karen Carpenter|author=Randy Schmidt|isbn=978-1780381497|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The demo version of the song, which features Jackson singing with a guitar, was released on the second disc of the 2009 album ''[[Michael Jackson's This Is It (album)|Michael Jackson's This Is It]]''. The song has also been covered by a variety of artists, including [[Patti LaBelle]], [[Ginuwine]], [[98 Degrees|98°]], [[S Club 7]], [[Barbara Mandrell]], [[Daniel Evans (singer)|Daniel Evans]], [[Nina Girado|Nina]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Josh Groban]], and [[Karel Gott]].

==Production==
Jones had originally intended to save the song for [[Frank Sinatra]]. However, he wanted Jackson to record material with more mature themes and "feel the full range of his voice," so he decided to bring the song to Jackson's attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Special Commemorative Edition:Michael Jackson 1958-2009|publisher=[[TIME Magazine]]|date=July 2009|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A poignant moment in the song occurs near the end when Jackson begins to break down in tears as he sings the word "life". Although he had attempted to record the song's last few moments with emotional restraint, after numerous tries he continued to end the rendition the same - by breaking down in tears. Producer [[Quincy Jones]] subsequently let Jackson's tearful recording stand:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''She's Out of My Life'', I'd been carrying around for about three years—you can feel the pain in it, you know. And I held on to it and finally something said 'this is the right moment to give it to Michael'.

And when we recorded it with Michael, I know it was an experience he'd never even thought about to sing in a song, 'cause it's a very mature emotion. And he cried at the end of every take, you know. We recorded about—I don't know—8-11 takes, and every one at the end, he just cried, and I said 'hey - that's supposed to be, leave it on there.'

—[[Quincy Jones]],  ''[[Off the Wall (album)|Off the Wall]]'' 2001 Special Edition, ''Quincy Jones Interview 3''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Jackson's autobiography, ''[[Moonwalk (book)|Moonwalk]]'', he wrote that the song is about knowing that barriers separating him from others are seemingly easy to overcome, yet they cause him to miss out on what he really desires.&lt;ref name="mj mw"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Moonwalk (book)|Moonwalk]] | first=Michael |last=Jackson|authorlink=Michael Jackson |year=2009 |origyear=First published 1988|publisher=Random House|isbn=0-307-71698-8|pages=163–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that he cried from the sudden effect of the words because "I had been letting so much build up inside me."&lt;ref name="mj mw" /&gt; Particularly it reminded him of his feeling of being "so rich in some experiences while being poor in moments of true joy."&lt;ref name="mj mw" /&gt; He worried about this feeling showing up on the song, but also felt "if it touched people's heartstrings, knowing that would make me feel less lonely."&lt;ref name="mj mw" /&gt; He described making ''Off the Wall'' as "one of the most difficult periods of my life...I had very few close friends at the time and felt very isolated."&lt;ref name="mj mw" /&gt; He would walk through his neighborhood, hoping to meet people who didn't know who he was, so he could meet "somebody who would be my friend because they liked me and needed a friend too, not because I was who I am."&lt;ref name="mj mw" /&gt;

==Release and reception==
The song peaked at #10 in the [[United States]] on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/searchResult.jsp?exp=y&amp;Ntt=She%27s+Out+of+My+Life+Michael+Jackson&amp;Ntk=Keyword&amp;Ntx=mode+matchallpartial&amp;nor=10&amp;an=bbcom&amp;N=37&amp;Ns=FORMATTED_DATE|0 Billboard.com - Search Results - She's out of My Life (Singles chart)]. Nielsen Business Media, Inc. Retrieved on 2008-08-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The single was even more successful in the [[UK]] and peaked at number 3 on the charts (the equivalent position reached by ''Off the Wall's'' debut single "[[Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough]]").

Given the popular response to his emotional rendition, the song remained in Jackson's live set for many years.

===Critical reception===
[[AllMusic]] editor [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] called the song an "overwrought ballad" but praised Jackson's "blindingly gifted" singing on the track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/off-the-wall-mw0000190332 |title=Off the Wall - Michael Jackson &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rolling Stone editor Stephen Holden praised: "The singer's ultradramatic phrasing, which takes huge emotional risks and wins every time, wrings the last drop of pathos from Tom Bahler's tear-jerker, "She's Out of My Life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/michaeljackson/albums/album/259585/review/6067502/off_the_wall |title=Michael Jackson: Off The Wall : Music Reviews : Rolling Stone |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=1979-11-01 |accessdate=2015-05-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629055907/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/michaeljackson/albums/album/259585/review/6067502/off_the_wall |archivedate=June 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==
A music video was produced to promote the song, which showed Michael in a blue-green shirt, dark pants, and sitting on a barstool with a spotlight shining behind him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Jackson - She's Out of My Life|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DQJPL9Yuq0|work=michaeljacksonVEVO|accessdate=2011-01-18|format=Youtube video|date=2009-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video uses a [[Split screen (filmmaking)|split screen]] technique to simultaneously show Jackson from two different angles during the second and third verses. It was directed by [[Bruce Gowers]], who also directed a similar video for Jackson's previous single "[[Rock with You]]." The video is shown far less frequently than Jackson's later videos, but it is included on the DVD box set ''[[Michael Jackson's Vision]]'', marking its first DVD release. It was parodied in the [[Dr. PC Man]] video ''[[Three Minutes Hour Life]]''.

==Live performances==
The song was performed during [[The Jacksons]]' [[Triumph Tour]] and [[Victory Tour (The Jacksons tour)|Victory Tour]]. It was also performed on Jackson's [[Bad World Tour]], the [[Dangerous World Tour]], and the Royal Brunei concert, which also turned out to be the final live performance of the song. The song was also rehearsed as a duet with a female backup vocalist for the first "Michael Jackson &amp; Friends" charity concert in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], but cancelled for the final performance, which took place ten years to the day before Jackson's death.

The live performances of the song were featured on the ''[[Michael Jackson: Live at Wembley July 16, 1988|Live at Wembley July 16, 1988]]'', ''[[Michael Jackson: Live In Bucharest - The Dangerous Tour|Live in Bucharest: The Dangerous Tour]]'', and ''[[Michael Jackson: Live at Wembley July 16, 1988]]'' DVDs.  Live audio is available in the ''Live at Wembley July 16, 1988'' CD, included as a bonus on ''[[Bad 25]]'', and the 1981 live album, ''[[The Jacksons Live!]]''

Jackson would bring a female audience member up on stage with him while performing the song.

The '''South African Formula One Championship''', was a [[Formula One]] [[auto racing|motor racing]] championship held in [[South Africa]] between 1960 and 1975, including a race in [[Rhodesia]] during each season.

The frontrunning cars in the series were recently retired from the world championship although there was also a healthy selection of locally built or modified machines, and from the late 60s [[Formula 5000]] added to grids with Formula Two cars joining in 1973. Front-running drivers from the series usually contested their local World Championship Grand Prix, as well as occasional European events, although they had little success at that level.

1967 also saw a remarkable result by [[Rhodesia]]n driver [[John Love (racing driver)|John Love]] with a 2.7 litre four-cylinder Cooper-Climax; Love, who was in his forties and, although seen as one of the finest drivers in Southern Africa, was not a major star, led and finished second in [[1967 South African Grand Prix|that year's South African Grand Prix]]. Love's Cooper was originally designed for the short races of the [[Tasman Series]]; to run a full Grand Prix Love added two auxiliary gas tanks. Unfortunately the auxiliary tanks' fuel pump failure forced him to refuel after having led most of the race.&lt;ref&gt;John Love, L'homme de Kyalami. Automobile historique (To be completed)&lt;/ref&gt;

Love and Charlton both won the South African Formula One championship for six consecutive seasons, Love from 1964 to 1969 and Charlton from 1970 to 1975. In 1975 [[Ian Scheckter]] raced the Tyrrell 007 that had been campaigned by brother, Jody, in the previous year's world championship and won five of the seasons races, including four on the trot. However he only had one other points finish with fifth place at the False Bay "100" on 5 July giving him a points total for the season of 47. Charlton proved more consistent with three victories, five second positions to give him a points total for the season of 57. By winning the Natal Spring Trophy at [[Roy Hesketh Circuit]] on 1 September Charlton joined Rhodesian John Love as a six times winner of the [[South African National Drivers Championship]]. Charlton ended the South African Formula One Championship by winning the final race of the season, the Rand Spring Trophy at [[Kyalami]] on 4 October after the faster Scheckter retired with a driveshaft problem.

Primarily owing to cost and dwindling grids, the Formula One championship was replaced at the end of the 1975 season with Formula Atlantic. The South Africans had tried to build interest by padding the field with Formula 2 and Formula 5000 cars, but viewership was in a steady decline - not helped by a somewhat Byzantine points system.&lt;ref name=SAMotor&gt;{{cite journal | ref = SAM1275 | journal = SA Motor | title = Dull finale | page = 49 | last = Thompson | first = Andrew | publisher = Scott Publications | location = Cape Town, South Africa | date = December 1975 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1976 would see the start of the domination of South Africa's National Championship by Ian Scheckter. Indeed, had it not been for youthful exuberance Scheckter would have won the 1975 title. He won more races than Charlton, but Charlton was more consistent. Scheckter won the first four championship in a row for Lexington Racing before United Tobacco Company withdrew their teams (Lexington, Gunston and Texan). With Gunston returning in 1983, Scheckter returned to the Championship and won a further two championships to join Love and Charlton as six times winners.

'''"Fire"''' is an unfinished instrumental written and produced by [[Brian Wilson]] for [[the Beach Boys]]' ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'' project. It was intended to serve one part of "[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)#"The Elements"|The Elements]]", a [[musical suite]] envisioned for ''Smile''. Believing that the recording contained [[pyrokinesis|pyrokinetic abilities]], Wilson shelved the track indefinitely, then claiming for many years to have destroyed its [[master tape]]s.

The composition was revisited several months later when "Fire" was rerecorded with a minimized arrangement, renamed "[[Fall Breaks and Back to Winter (W. Woodpecker Symphony)]]", and then published for the Beach Boys' 1967 album ''[[Smiley Smile]]''.  Under the title "'''Mrs. O'Leary's Cow'''", Wilson completed "Fire" as a solo artist in 2004 for ''[[Brian Wilson Presents Smile]]''.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p = 163}} In 2011, the Beach Boys' original 1966 recording was released in several composite forms as "'''The Elements: Fire (Mrs. O'Leary's Cow)'''" for the compilation ''[[The Smile Sessions]]''.

Wilson was awarded the [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance]], his first, for "Mrs. O'Leary's Cow".

[[File:Chicago-fire1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Artist's rendering of the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871]]

Named for [[Catherine O'Leary]] of the [[Great Chicago Fire]], "Mrs. O'Leary's Cow" was initially composed for the Beach Boys' unreleased album ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'' as the first part of "[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)#"The Elements"|The Elements]]" suite: [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]].{{sfn|Badman|2004|p = 163}} In Brian Wilson's [[ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] 1991 autobiography ''[[Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story]]'', the circumstances of his second [[LSD]] trip were detailed. They were purported to have involved [[ego death]] as well as [[death by burning]], which has led some to speculate that the track is a musical adaptation of this LSD trip.&lt;ref name="Out-Of-Sight! SMiLE Timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pages.cthome.net/tobelman/The_Out-Of-Sight_SMiLE_Site.html |title=''Out-Of-Sight!'' SMiLE Timeline |accessdate=2011-10-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201234435/http://pages.cthome.net/tobelman/The_Out-Of-Sight_SMiLE_Site.html |archivedate=February 1, 2010 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wilson with Gold, "It created a disturbing picture that mirrored the screams that had filled my head and plagued my sleep for years."{{sfn|Wilson|Gold|1991|p=156}} In regard to the existence of its master tapes, "Roughly two minutes of 'Fire' music still exists, locked in the Capitol vaults, where I hope it remains. Not because I still believe it possesses a negative power; that was merely a reflection of how disturbed I was at the time. I hope that segment remains unreleased simply because it's not good music."{{sfn|Wilson|Gold|1991|p=156}}

At an earlier time, Wilson noted, "It was sick. Weird chords, it wasn't the straight eight and all that. I started thinking, 'Oh God, I'm flipping here.' But I liked it."{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=173}} The music was considered an attempt at "[[witchcraft]]" by Wilson, who dismissed it simply a product of the group's excessive drug use.{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=43}} British rock journalist [[Nick Kent]] described the track as a "dark, booming, reverb-drenched blur of sound."{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=42}} During the 1970s, writer [[Byron Preiss]] was lent an [[acetate disc]] of the track, calling it "a mad, [[Impressionism in music|impressionistic piece]] that crept up on you with the emotional chill of a real fire."{{sfn|Priess|1979|p=62}} Author [[Bob Stanley (musician)|Bob Stanley]] named it a "terrifying [[atonal]] cacophony".{{sfn|Stanley|2013|p=222}} According to ''Wouldn't it Be Nice'', "the instrumental track was one long, eerie whine. It built slowly, like the beginning of a giant conflagration, and grew so intense it was possible to picture the kindling catching, spreading, and being whipped by the wind into a raging, out-of-control inferno ... The weirdest was the crash and crackle of instruments smoldering for the final time. Listening to the playback, I began to feel unnerved by the music, strange and eerie."{{sfn|Wilson|Gold|1991|p=156}}

==Recording==
Present at the instrumental's tracking on November 28, 1966 was [[Danny Hutton]], [[Frank J. Holmes]], and [[Dennis Wilson]], who filmed Brian as he produced the recording.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p = 163}} Other attendants included wife-of-Brian [[Marilyn Wilson]], sister-in-law Diane Rovell, and Beach Boys roadie Arnie Geller.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=173}} [[Van Dyke Parks]] avoided this session "like [[Black Death|the plague]]" due to what he perceived as Brian's regressive behavior during the period.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=172}} It was recorded under unusual conditions. Wilson instructed Geller to purchase several dozen fire helmets at a local [[toy store]] so that everybody in the studio could don them during its recording. Wilson also had the studio's janitor bring in a bucket with burning wood so that the studio would be filled with the smell of smoke.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=173}} After twenty-four takes,{{sfn|Wilson|Gold|1991|p=156}} attempts by Wilson were made to record the crackling noises made by the burning wood and mix them into the track.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p = 163}} An account of the famous "Fire" story was first reported and published in October 1967:
{{quotation|“Yeah,” said Brian on the way home, an acetate trial copy or “dub” of the tape in his hands, the red plastic fire helmet still on his head. "Yeah, I’m going to call this 'Mrs. O’Leary’s Fire' and I think it might just scare a whole lot of people." As it turns out, however, Brian Wilson’s magic fire music is not going to scare anybody—because nobody other than the few people who heard it in the studio will ever get to listen to it. A few days after the record was finished, a building across the street from the studio burned down and, according to Brian, there was also an unusually large number of fires in Los Angeles. Afraid that his music might in fact turn out to be magic fire music, Wilson destroyed the master. "I don’t have to do a big scary fire like that," he later said. "I can do a candle and it’s still fire. That would have been a really bad vibration to let out on the world, that Chicago fire. The next one is going to be a candle.”|[[Jules Siegel]], "[[Goodbye Surfing, Hello God!]]"{{sfn|Siegel|2011}}}}

Another story which circulates involves Wilson attempting to set fire to the tapes only to find that they refuse to ignite, which further frightens him.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p = 163}} [[Al Jardine]] explained from his point of view: "I wasn't at that session but I think [[Carl Wilson|Carl]] was there. Yeah, there was the rumor that he burned all the tapes.  You can’t burn tape, that’s just a myth.  We tried it once, because of the rumor that Brian has burned the tapes, and I wanted to see if that would work. We were finishing a song for ''[[Surf's Up (album)|Surf’s Up]]'' and we had some outtakes from the album and I put a match to it, and it wouldn't burn.  The tapes weren't burned, and needless to say they do exist for the ''Smile'' sessions."&lt;ref name=Sharp2013&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sharp|first1=Ken|title=Al Jardine of the Beach Boys: Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About "SMiLE" (Interview)|url=http://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/2013/04/02/al-jardine-smile-beach-boys-interview/|website=Rock Cellar Magazine|accessdate=2 July 2014|date=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a 1978 ''[[Robert W. Morgan]] Special of the Week'' radio program, Dennis recalled how he had recently played the "Fire" tape for Brian, and that a day later, an electrical fire broke out at the [[Record Plant]] in Los Angeles, destroying the Studio C room.{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In addition to "Fire" session highlights, a digital [[mashup (music)|mashup]] of the Beach Boys' wordless "Fall Breaks and Back to Winter" vocals and the "Fire" backing track was eventually released in 2011 as disc 1, track 17 on ''[[The Smile Sessions]]'' box-set.

As a solo artist, Wilson revisited "Fire" under the title "Mrs. O'Leary's Cow". Still in fear of the track, Wilson left its string arrangement to collaborator [[Darian Sahanaja]], who explained: "I think that's the part that spooked him the most. I told him I'd deal with it."{{sfn|Dillon|2012|pages=280-81}} Wilson also instructed that the vocals be modeled from "Fall Breaks and Back to Winter". Although he ended up performing vocals, Wilson avoided attending his band's rehearsals of the track. Ultimately, this was to their relief, as a [[power outage]] occurred by happenstance in mid-rehearsal as though to signal a bad omen.{{sfn|Dillon|2012}} Sahanaja speculates that if Wilson had been present for this occurrence, ''Smile'' would have been cancelled for the second time.{{sfn|Dillon|2012}} "Mrs. O'Leary's Cow" was released in 2004 for ''[[Brian Wilson Presents Smile]]''.

The '''Theatre Royal''' is owned by Scottish Opera and is the oldest theatre in [[Glasgow]] and the longest running in Scotland. Located at 282 Hope Street, its front door was originally round the corner in Cowcaddens Street. It currently accommodates 1,541 people. The theatre opened in 1867, adopting the name Theatre Royal two years later. It is also the birthplace of [[Howard &amp; Wyndham Ltd]], owners and managers of theatres in Scotland and England until the 1970s, created by its chairman Baillie Michael Simons in 1895. It was Simons who as a cultural entrepreneur of his day also promoted the building of [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]] and Glasgow's International Exhibitions of 1888 (the [[International Exhibition of Science, Art and Industry]]) and 1901.

==History==
The theatre was opened in 1867 as the Royal Colosseum and Opera House by [[James Baylis]]. Baylis also ran the Milton Colosseum Music Hall &lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Glasgow/MiltonColosseum.htm&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Cowcaddens]] Cross, and had opened the Scotia Music Hall &lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Glasgow/Scotia.htm&lt;/ref&gt;, later known as the Metropole &lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Glasgow/Scotia.htm&lt;/ref&gt;, in Stockwell Street in 1862. The Royal, and its shops and adjoining Alexandra Music Hall, were designed by George Bell of Clarke &amp; Bell, who became the founding President of the Glasgow Institute of Architects.

Baylis presented a range of performance activity in its auditorium: pantomimes, plays, comedies, harlequinades and opera. This early mention of opera seems significant given the theatre’s later role since 1975 as the home of Scottish Opera. Despite the financial importance of pantomime, then as now, opera in the time of Baylis was still viable as a commercial venture. The Mitchell Library`s archives record that other venues in Glasgow performed opera – in 1868 there were 76 performances of 23 different operas;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Graeme (2008), ''The Theatre Royal: Entertaining a Nation'',  Glasgow Publications, 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-9559420-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recent research increasingly underlines its presence down the years. Many operas, both famous and forgotten, had their Scottish premiere at the Theatre Royal. Certainly among surviving Scottish theatres, in this respect the Theatre Royal is head and shoulders above others even on the basis of a selective listing.
&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Iain and Fraser, Stephen (2013)  [http://www.operascotland.org/venue/24/Theatre+Royal%2C+Glasgow+|+Glasgow "Theatre Royal, Glasgow"] on  operascotland.org. Accessed 1 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869 Baylis leased the theatre to Glover &amp; Francis who previously ran the old Theatre Royal in Dunlop Street, which had been demolished to make way for [[St Enoch railway station]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Glasgow/TRDunlop.htm&lt;/ref&gt; William Glover brought the name Theatre Royal with him and its company of artistes, orchestra and stage staff, presenting drama, opera, revues and pantomime.

In 1879 the auditorium was destroyed by fire and was rebuilt to the classical French Renaissance design seen today of the renowned theatre architect [[Charles J. Phipps]], creating three galleries instead of two and making the front door face Hope Street instead of Cowcaddens Road. It continued to accommodate about 3,000 people. It is now the largest surviving example of Charles Phipp's theatre work in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Glasgow/TRHope.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1880s a number of managers ran it until Baillie Michael Simons arranged for it to be made available to two actor managers, James Howard and Fred Wyndham, in 1888. They announced that in addition to plays, opera, musicals and summer revues it would be known above all as a pantomime house, their first being The Forty Thieves. The new company, Howard &amp; Wyndham, went on to produce pantomimes across Britain for almost 80 years. Howard &amp; Wyndham also presented from the 1930s onwards the famous Half Past Eight Shows which later became the record-breaking Five Past Eight Shows. They were not operators of music-halls nor presented variety, which was the forte of [[Moss Empires]].

In 1895 the company became [[Howard &amp; Wyndham Ltd]], quoted on Stock Exchanges, and growing to own and operate the largest group of quality theatres in Scotland and England, with the Royal as its flagship. In the same year a fire destroyed the auditorium again, but was rebuilt six months later under the attention of Charles Phipps with few visible changes. [[Howard &amp; Wyndham Ltd]] soon added to their stock of theatres by building the [[Frank Matcham]] designed [[King's Theatre, Glasgow|King’s Theatre]] across the city centre in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Graeme (2008), ''The Theatre Royal: Entertaining a Nation'',  Glasgow Publications, 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-9559420-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, the theatre was sold to [[Scottish Television]] in a joint venture with Howard &amp; Wyndham Ltd (who moved their own shows to their new flagship the [[Alhambra Theatre Glasgow|Alhambra Theatre]] in Waterloo Street) for conversion of the Royal into a Scottish Television Theatre, studios and offices, becoming the main home for the commercial ITV network in central Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Graeme (2011), ''Alhambra Glasgow'' Glasgow Publication. {{ISBN|9780955942013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Live performances in music, dance and comedy were transmitted across Scotland and networked to ITV areas south of the border. STV also transmitted concerts and operas from other venues and became the first and largest sponsors of [[Scottish Opera]] started by Sir [[Alexander Gibson (conductor)|Alexander Gibson]] in 1962

In 1974, Scottish Television moved to custom-built premises next door and offered the Theatre Royal to [[Scottish Opera]] who bought it with public support, converting it to become its home theatre and  Scotland's first national opera house. A major rebuild and refurbishment ensued, involving the creation of an enlarged foyer, new main staircase, orchestra pit enlarged to accommodate 100 players, extended backstage areas and modernised dressing rooms. The auditorium was restored to its full glory and plasterwork once more in its original cream and gold and colour highlights, with the ornate ceiling picked out in its original colours of gold, cream and pale blue. William Morris wallpaper was added to the principal walls. It re-opened in October 1975 with a gala performance of ''Die Fledermaus'', televised live.

A few months later the Theatre Royal also became the home theatre of [[Scottish Ballet]] started in 1969, and became the main home of the [[Scottish Theatre Company]] during its existence in the 1980s. It became a principal venue of the city's Mayfest Festival each year, and continues to attract visiting companies. Since 1977 it has been protected as a [[listed building#Scotland|category A listed building]] of architectural and historic importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.historic-scotland.gov.uk/pls/htmldb/f?p=2200:15:0::::BUILDING:33061|title=Theatre Royal: Listed Building Report |accessdate=8 December 2013 |publisher=Historic Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is the largest example of Charles Phipps' architecture in Britain.

In 1997 a lottery-funded refurbishment allowed for extensive rewiring and redecoration. Cherry red walls, turquoise seating, and red and turquoise carpeting replaced the 1975 scheme. In 2005 [[Scottish Opera]] leased the theatre management to the [[Ambassador Theatre Group]], although the building continues to be the performance home of [[Scottish Opera]], and of [[Scottish Ballet]].

Funding from the Scottish Government, Heritage Lottery and others from 2012 onwards enabled Scottish Opera to build new foyers at the corner of Hope Street and Cowcaddens, partly on the site of the former Alexandra Music Hall. Costing £14m, it opened in December 2014 and is a largely elliptical building, containing new entrances, foyers, bars, cafe, hospitality areas, education space and heritage exhibition areas together with lifts to all levels, including an open roof terrace, and centred by an open spiral staircase.

When winning the design competition, the architects [[Page &amp; Park]] observed: 
:One of the challenges of the design team has been to make a special and memorable corner at the junction of Hope Street and Cowcaddens Road. It will be as if a little bit of the splendid interior has escaped and flourished on the street edge, the auditorium and the lantern crowning the busy junction, working together to celebrate performance in the city. It will be a fun building to visit (and open all day); to climb through the levels will be exhilarating, guiding the visitor to the entrance to the auditoriums but at the same time framing the city around.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pagepark.co.uk/ Page\Park architects website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowds gather around Jesus and believe in him in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#12:9|John 12:9-11]] after [[Raising of Lazarus|he raised Lazarus]] from the dead, and the next day the multitudes that had gathered for the feast in [[Jerusalem]] welcome Jesus as he enters Jerusalem. 

In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#21:1|Matthew 21:1-11]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#11:1|Mark 11:1-11]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#19:28|Luke 19:28-44]], and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#12:12|John 12:12-19]], Jesus descends from the [[Mount of Olives]] towards Jerusalem, and the crowds lay their clothes on the ground to welcome him as he triumphantly enters Jerusalem.

Christians celebrate Jesus' entry into Jerusalem as [[Palm Sunday]], a week before [[Easter Sunday]].

==Gospel accounts==
According to the Gospels, Jesus was staying at [[Bethany (Biblical village)|Bethany]] and [[Bethphage]] before entering Jerusalem. [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#12:1|John 12:1]] states that he was in Bethany six days before the [[passover]]. In the [[synoptic gospels]], Jesus sends two [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] ahead to ''the village over against'' them in order to retrieve a [[donkey]] (or, in [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], two animals: a donkey and a colt) that had been tied up but never ridden, and if questioned, to say that the donkey was needed by the Lord (or Master) but would be returned.&lt;ref name=Boring256 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans381 /&gt;&lt;ref name=M133 /&gt;

Jesus then rode the donkey into Jerusalem, with the three [[Synoptic gospels]] stating that the disciples had first put their [[cloak]]s on it (presumably to make it more comfortable). Matthew 21:7 maintains that the disciples laid their cloaks on both animals: ''they brought the donkey and the colt, laid their clothes on them, and set Him'' (or ''he sat'') ''on them''.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|21:7|NKJV}} in the [[New King James Version]]; "he sat" is the reading in the [[American Standard Version|American]] and [[English Standard Version]]s&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinrich Meyer]] suggests that "they spread their outer garments upon both animals, being uncertain which of them Jesus intended to mount".&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/matthew/21.htm Meyer's NT Commentary] on Matthew 21, accessed 7 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Enrique Simonet - Flevit super illam 1892.jpg|thumb|left|350px|''Flevit super illam'' (''He wept over it''), by [[Enrique Simonet]], 1892.]]
In [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#19:41|Luke 19:41]] as Jesus approaches Jerusalem, he looks at the city and weeps over it (an event known as '''''Flevit super illam''''' in [[Latin language|Latin]]), foretelling the suffering that awaits the city.&lt;ref name=Boring256 /&gt;&lt;ref name=M133 /&gt;

The Gospels go on to recount how Jesus rode into Jerusalem, and how the people there laid down their cloaks in front of him and also laid down small branches of trees. The people sang part of [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Psalms#118:25|Psalm 118: 25-26]]: ''Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord. We bless you from the house of the Lord ...''.&lt;ref name=Boring256 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans381 /&gt;&lt;ref name=M133 /&gt;&lt;ref name=MacArthur17 &gt;''John 12-21'' by John MacArthur 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-8024-0824-2}} pages 17-18&lt;/ref&gt;

On his entry into the city, Matthew's account suggests that Jesus evoked great excitement - "all the city was moved" - but also that Jesus may not have been known to the people of Jerusalem: the people of the city asked "Who is this?" and "the multitudes" ({{lang-gr|οι οχλοι}}, ''hoi ochloi'') answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from [[Nazareth]] of [[Galilee]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|21:10-11|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "moved" in the Greek text is "ἐσείσθη" (''eseisthē''), derived from σεισμός (''seismos''). The [[Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges]] suggests "the word in the original is forcible, “convulsed” or “stirred” as by an [[earthquake]], or by a [[Hurricane|violent wind]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/21.htm Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges] on Matthew 21, accessed 8 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew uses the same word in {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|27:15|NKJV}} when he suggests that the earth "quaked" at the time of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus' death]].

In the Synoptic Gospels, this episode is followed by the [[Cleansing of the Temple]] episode and, in all four Gospels, Jesus performs various healings and teaches by way of parables while in Jerusalem until the [[Last Supper]].&lt;ref name=Boring256 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans381 /&gt;

Traditionally, entering the city on a donkey symbolizes arrival in peace, rather than as a war-waging king arriving on a horse.&lt;ref name=MacArthur17 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Allison120 /&gt;

The [[Synoptic Gospels|Synoptics]] ([[Gospel of Mark|Mc]] chapter 14; [[Gospel of Matthew|Mt]] 26) refers to Jesus visiting the home of an unknown woman of Bethany, where she [[Holy anointing oil|anointed his ''head'' with a precious oil]], in forecast of his burial. The event was placed in the house of [[Simon the Leper]] (''Simon'' in Luke), and dated after the entry in Jerusalem (Mc 11), before the [[sunset|sundown]] and preceding by two days the Passover.

The synoptics differ with the [[anointing of Jesus]] as referred in the [[Gospel of John|John 12]], who named [[Mary of Bethany|Mary]], sister of Lazarus, while anointing the ''feet'' of Jesus at a dinner in his honour in her home. Lastly, John dated the event at the day before first Jesus' entry in Jerusalem (less than two miles from Bethany, as in John 11), and six days preceding the [[Passover]].

==Old Testament parallels==
[[File:Giotto - Scrovegni - -26- - Entry into Jerusalem2.jpg|thumb|''Entry into Jerusalem'', by [[Giotto]], 14th century.]]

[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#21:1|Matthew 21:1-11]] refers to a passage from [[Book of Zechariah]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Zechariah#9:9|9:9]]) and states:&lt;ref name=M133 /&gt;

:"All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass."

The location of the [[Mount of Olives]] is significant in the [[Old Testament]] in that [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Zechariah#9:9|Zechariah 9:9]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Zechariah#14:1|Zechariah 14:1-5]] stated that the Messiah would come to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives:&lt;ref name=M133 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also see [[Josephus]], Flavius, ''Bellum Judaicum'', II,13,5 and ''Antiquitates Judaicae'', XX,8,6&lt;/ref&gt;

:Then shall the Lord go forth and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle. And his feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east.

The triumphal entry and the [[palm branch (symbol)|palm branches]], resemble the celebration of Jewish liberation in [[1 Maccabees]] (13:51) which states:&lt;ref name=CAEvans114 /&gt;

:And entered into it ... with thanksgiving, and branches of palm trees, and with harps, and cymbals, and with viols, and hymns, and songs.

Jesus' entry on a donkey has a parallel in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Zechariah#9:9|Zechariah 9:9]] which states that:

:thy king cometh unto thee; he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass.

The symbolism of the donkey may also refer to the Eastern tradition that it is an animal of peace, versus the horse, which is an animal of war.&lt;ref name=Allison120 &gt;''Matthew 19-28'' by William David Davies, Dale C. Allison 2004  {{ISBN|0-567-08375-6}} page 120&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a king came riding upon a horse when he was bent on war and rode upon a donkey when he wanted to point out that he was coming in peace. Therefore, Jesus' entry to Jerusalem symbolized his entry as the [[Messiah|Prince of Peace]], not as a warmongering king.&lt;ref name=MacArthur17 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Allison120 /&gt;

The '''Utah Pride Festival''' is a [[Pride parade|festival]] held in downtown [[Salt Lake City]] in June celebrating [[Utah]]'s diversity and [[gay]], [[lesbian]], [[bisexuality|bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) community. The event is a program of the [[Utah Pride Center]], and includes the state's second-largest parade, after the [[Days of '47 Parade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Utah Days Of '47 Parade Denies Entry For Mormon LGBT Float|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/09/utah-parade-mormon-lgbt-float_n_5297131.html|accessdate=June 10, 2014|work=The Huffington Post|agency=Associated Press|date=May 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Utah Pride 2006.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Salt Lake City Public Library|Salt Lake City Library]] during the 2006 Utah Pride Festival, which was centered around the [[Salt Lake City and County Building]] in the background.]]
The festival began in 1977 when the Salt Lake Coalition for Human Rights sponsored a three-day conference. [[Affirmation: Gay &amp; Lesbian Mormons]] (then called Gay Mormons United) was founded during this conference, on June 11.&lt;ref name=Affirmation&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.affirmation.org/memorial/historical_events.shtml |title=Affirmation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430002543/http://affirmation.org/memorial/historical_events.shtml |archivedate=April 30, 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1978 keynote speakers were [[David Kopay]], the first NFL player to come out of the closet, and U.S. Air Force Sgt. [[Leonard Matlovich]], an ex-Mormon who was the first openly gay person to appear on the cover of ''Time'' magazine.&lt;ref name="Pride Guide 1996 (1996)"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pride Guide 1996|location=Special Collections, J. Willard Marriott Library, University of Utah, Salt Lake City|publisher=Gay and Lesbian Community Council of Utah|date=June 1996|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utah Pride Inc. was created in 1989 through 2004 as a project of the [[Utah Pride Center#Utah Stonewall Center|Gay and Lesbian Community Council of Utah]]. The project was renamed Pride of Utah in 2006.&lt;ref name="Pride Guide 1996 (1996)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Utah Pride Inc.

The first Pride parade in the state was held June 27, 1990 at the state capitol building. It began on the steps of the capitol, went down Main street, and ended on South Temple at the Utah Museum of Contemporary Art (then the Salt Lake Art Center).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite archive|collection= Gay and Lesbian Community Center of Utah records ACCN 1918, Box 23 Reference Files P-R, Folder 3 Pride Day Utah 1989-2001: Utah's First March for Lesbian and Gay Pride flyer|date=1991|institution=Special Collections Manuscripts Division, J.

In 1997, a football-field long pride flag was made to carry down the parade route. It was produced by Rev. Bruce Barton of the Metropolitan Community Church of Salt Lake City, UT along with a dozen helpers (including Jeff Freedman, Bruce Harmon, Carrie Gaylor, Lynn Gillman and Garth Snyder) whom called it, a "tremendous symbol of pride and unity".  Completed the day of the parade (June 8 at 4:15 am), it was composed of 35 bolts of lightweight fabric in 6 colors, and took more than 80 hours to sew this 300 foot long flag.  Over 100 marchers would hold the sides; people often threw donations onto the flag and children would run around underneath.  In 2012, the original flag had seen better days and a new one from Colonial Flag was purchased for $5,000.  It is 30x200 feet, made of nylon with hand holds every 18".  Also, UPC gifted Moab Pride their own 100' flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SLTB&amp;p_theme=sltb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=allfields(Gay%20Pride%20marchers%20)%20AND%20date(1/1/1997%20to%2012/1/1997)&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=1/1/1997%20to%2012/1/1997)&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=(%22Gay%20Pride%20marchers%20%22)&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no|title=S.L.

In 2004, an estimated 50,000 people attended, the largest since the festival began.&lt;ref name=Affirmation/&gt; However, in 2005, the first year in which an admission was charged, attendance at the festival was 15,000 to 20,000. Some have attributed this decline to patrons not wanting to pay for admission to the festival.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} Festival organizers argued that it was the first year in which an accurate method of counting the attendance was employed and that the numbers did not reflect a drop in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slmetro.com/2005/14/local03.shtml |title=SL Metro |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928070804/http://slmetro.com/2005/14/local03.shtml |archivedate=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 the first local pride festival was held in [[Moab, UT]].

The 2012 festival included performers [[Frenchie Davis]] and [[Prince Poppycock]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utahpride.org/festivities/2012-headliners|title=Utah Pride - Announcing 2012 Headliners|accessdate=April 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, pride spread to [[Provo, UT]] with their first pride.

In 2014, Mayor Ralph Becker threw a private wedding reception for couples whose marriages he performed on the first day that same-sex marriage became legal in Utah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Winslow|first=Ben|title=Utah Pride Festival kicks off as decision on same-sex marriage nears|url=http://fox13now.com/2014/06/06/utah-pride-festival-kicks-off-as-decision-on-same-sex-marriage-nears/|accessdate=June 12, 2014|work=Fox13|date=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pride reached [[Ogden, UT]] in 2015 when they held their first pride festival.

2016 was the first year panel discussions were held during the festival, inside the Salt Lake City Public Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ksl.com/?sid=40047422&amp;nid=148&amp;title=parade-music-5k-highlight-utah-pride-festival|title=Parade, Music, 5K Highlight, Utah Pride Festival|work=KSL News|date=3 June 2016|accessdate=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''War of the Spanish Succession''' (1701–1714) was a European conflict of the early 18th century, triggered by the death of the childless [[Charles II of Spain]] in November 1700. His closest heirs were members of the Austrian [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] and French [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] families; acquisition of an undivided [[Spanish Empire]] by either threatened the European balance of power.

Charles left an undivided Spanish Monarchy {{efn|The term generally used instead of 'Empire.'}} to [[Louis XIV]]'s grandson [[Philip V of Spain|Philip]], who was proclaimed King of Spain on 16 November 1700. Disputes over separation of the Spanish and French crowns and commercial rights led to war in 1701 between the Bourbons of France and Spain and the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]], whose candidate was [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles]], younger son of Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold]].{{efn|The Habsburgs were rulers of Austria and Hungary in their own right; Emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was technically an elected position but had been held by the Habsburgs since 1438.}}

By the end of 1706, Allied victories in Italy and the [[Low Countries]] forced the French back within their borders but they were unable to make a decisive breakthrough. Control of the sea allowed the Allies to conduct successful offensives in Spain, but lack of popular support for Archduke Charles meant they could not hold territory outside the coastal areas. 

When his elder brother [[Joseph_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|Joseph]] died in 1711, Charles succeeded him as Emperor, undermining the primary driver behind the war, which was to prevent Spain being united with either France or Austria. The 1710 British election returned a new government committed to ending it and with the Allied war effort now dependent on British financing, this eventually forced the others to make peace. The war ended with the 1713 [[Treaty of Utrecht]], followed in 1714 by the treaties of [[Treaty of Rastatt|Rastatt]] and [[Treaty of Baden (1714)|Baden]].

In return for confirmation as King of Spain, Philip V renounced his place in the line of succession to the French throne, both for himself and his descendants; Spain retained the bulk of its possessions outside Europe, while its territories in Italy and the Netherlands were divided between Austria, Britain and [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoy]]. The Dutch Republic was granted its [[Barrier_Treaty|Barrier Fortresses]], while France acknowledged the Protestant succession in Britain and agreed to end support for the [[James_Francis_Edward_Stuart|Stuart exiles]]. 

In the longer term, the commercial provisions of Utrecht confirmed Britain's status as the leading European maritime and commercial power. Others included the decline of the Dutch Republic as a first-rank power, the creation of a centralised Spanish state and the acceleration of the break-up of the Holy Roman Empire into larger and more powerful German principalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Falkner |first1=James |title=The War of the Spanish Succession |date=2015 |publisher=Pen and Sword Military |location=4148-4181 |asin=B0189PTWZG |edition=Kindle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Charles II of Spain anonymous portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7| Charles II, 1665–1700; last Habsburg King of Spain; his [[Habsburg chin]] is clearly visible]]
In 1665 Charles II became the last male Habsburg King of Spain; suffering from ill-health all his life, his death was anticipated almost from birth and his successor debated for decades. In 1670, England agreed to support the rights of Louis XIV to the Spanish throne in the [[Secret_Treaty_of_Dover|Treaty of Dover]], while the terms of the 1688 [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg) |Grand Alliance]] committed England and the Dutch Republic to back Leopold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hochedlinger|first1=Michael|title=Austria's Wars of Emergence, 1683-1797|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0582290848|page=171|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=X7pACwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT232&amp;lpg=PT232&amp;dq=treaty+of+1703+savoy+and+austria&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=g5lN4k7aSe&amp;sig=KHxlkkKV5vR1zpulPsLxCkPDzBk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilqdecm9_aAhXEJMAKHTA-DMw4ChDoAQhEMAY#v=onepage&amp;q=league%20of%20augsburg&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1700, the [[Spanish Empire]] included possessions in [[Italy]], the [[Spanish Netherlands]], the [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Philippines]] and the [[Americas]] and though no longer the dominant [[great power]], it remained largely intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Storrs|first1= Christopher|title= The Resilience of the Spanish Monarchy 1665-1700|date= 2006|publisher= OUP Oxford|isbn= 978-0199246373|pages= 6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since acquisition of the Empire by either the Austrian [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] or French [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]] would change the balance of power in Europe, its inheritance led to a war that involved most of the European powers. The 1700-1721 [[Great Northern War]] is considered a connected conflict, since it impacted the involvement of states such as [[Swedish_Empire|Sweden]], [[Electorate_of_Saxony|Saxony]], [[Denmark–Norway]] and [[Russian_Empire|Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Frey, Linda |first1=Frey, Marsha |title=The Treaties of the War of the Spanish Succession: An Historical and Critical Dictionary |date=1995 |publisher=Greenwood |isbn=978-0313278846 |pages=191-192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1688-1697 [[Nine Years War]], armies had increased in size from an average of 25,000 in 1648 to over 100,000 by 1697, a level unsustainable for pre-industrial economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Childs|first1=John|title=The Nine Years' War and the British Army, 1688-1697: The Operations in the Low Countries|date=1991|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=0719089964|page=1|edition=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1690s also marked the lowest point of the [[Little Ice Age]], a period of colder and wetter weather that drastically reduced crop yields.&lt;ref name=White2011pp542-3&gt;I.

The 1697 [[Treaty of Ryswick]] was therefore the result of mutual exhaustion and Louis XIV's acceptance that France could not achieve its objectives without allies. Leopold initially refused to sign and did so with extreme reluctance in October 1697; by now, Charles' health was clearly failing and with the Succession unresolved, the signatories viewed Ryswick as a pause in hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;

Unlike France or Austria, the Crown of Spain could be inherited through the female line. This allowed Charles' sisters [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa (1638–1683)]] and [[Margaret Theresa of Spain|Margaret Theresa (1651–1673)]] to pass their rights as rulers onto the children of their respective marriages with Louis XIV and [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Leopold]].

Despite being opponents in the recent [[Nine Years War]], Louis XIV and [[William III of England|William III of England]] now attempted to resolve the Succession by diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Frey|editor1-first=Linda|editor2-last=Frey|editor2-first=Marsha|title=The Treaties of the War of the Spanish Succession: An Historical and Critical Dictionary|date=1995|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=978-0313278846|page=389}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1685, [[Maria Antonia of Austria|Maria Antonia (1669–1692)]], daughter of Leopold and Margaret, married [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria|Maximillian Emanuel of Bavaria]] and they had a son, [[Joseph Ferdinand of Bavaria|Joseph Ferdinand]].

Charles died on 1 November 1700 and Louis received the offer on 9th, giving him the option to accept or insist on the Treaty of London. The latter would in theory give the throne to Archduke Charles but if Leopold continued to refuse the territorial concessions, Louis could demand Britain and the Dutch join him in enforcing the Treaty, leaving Austria isolated. However, French diplomats advised the anti-French mood of the Habsburg court meant war either way, while Britain and the Dutch would neither fight for nor against Austria.&lt;ref&gt; Onnekink, David (ed) Mijers, Esther (ed), John Rule (author) p.91–108&lt;/ref&gt; On balance, this made it preferable to accept the offer and on 16 November, Philip of Anjou was proclaimed Philip V of Spain.

==Prelude to war==

With most of his objectives achieved by diplomacy, Louis now made a series of moves that combined to make war inevitable.&lt;ref&gt; Falkner, James; pages 508-510&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] majority in the English [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] would not fight for Spain or the Dutch and preferred the provisions of Charles' will to the Partition Treaties.{{efn|Their main objection was France gaining Sicily, an important link in the lucrative Levant trade.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gregg|first1=Edward|title=Queen Anne (Revised) (The English Monarchs Series)|date=1980|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300090246|page=126|edition=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a foreign diplomat observed this was true 'so long as English commerce does not suffer.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Somerset|first1=Anne|title=Queen Anne; the Politics of Passion|date=2012|publisher=Harper|isbn=978-0007203765|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louis either failed to appreciate this or decided to ignore it and his actions gradually eroded Tory opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner, James; page 96&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1593 Valckenborch Ansicht von Antwerpen mit zugefrorener Schelde anagoria.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Antwerp and the frozen Scheldt estuary; French moves against this vital area threatened both England and the Dutch Republic.]]
In early 1701, Louis registered Philip's claim to the French throne with the Paris [[Parlement]], raising the possibility of union with Spain, contrary to Charles' will. In February, the Spanish-controlled Duchies of [[Milan]] and [[Mantua]] in Northern Italy announced their support for Philip and accepted French troops. Combined with efforts to build an alliance between France and Imperial German states in [[Swabia]] and [[Franconia]], these were challenges Leopold could not ignore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=RT|title=Lothar Franz von Schönborn and the Diplomacy of the Electorate of Mainz:|date=1973|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-9024713462|pages=158–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, French garrisons took over Dutch-held 'Barrier' fortresses in the Spanish Netherlands, helped by the Spanish Viceroy and French ally [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria|Max Emanuel of Bavaria]].&lt;ref&gt;Somerset, Anne Pages 166–167&lt;/ref&gt; This undid Dutch gains made at Ryswick and threatened their lucrative monopoly over the [[Scheldt]] granted by the 1648 [[Peace of Münster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Israel|first1=Jonathan|title=Dutch Primacy in World Trade, 1585-1740|date=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0198211396|pages=197–199|edition=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a concern to English merchants since control of the ports of [[Antwerp]] and [[Ostend]] allowed France to blockade the [[English Channel|Channel]] at will. Combined with other French actions potentially damaging to English trade, this produced a clear majority for war and in May 1701, Parliament urged William to negotiate an anti-French alliance.&lt;ref "Queen Anne; the Politics of Passion"&gt; Somerset, Anne; Page 167&lt;/ref&gt;   

On 7 September, Leopold, the Dutch Republic and Britain{{efn|England and Scotland were separate countries until 1707 but the Treaty was signed by William as King of Great Britain.}} signed the [[Treaty of The Hague (1701)|Treaty of The Hague]] renewing the 1689 [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]]. Its provisions included securing the Dutch Barrier in the Spanish Netherlands, the Protestant succession in England and Scotland and an independent Spain but made no reference to placing Archduke Charles on the Spanish throne.&lt;ref "Queen Anne; the Politics of Passion"&gt; Somerset, Anne; Page 168&lt;/ref&gt; 

War became inevitable when the exiled [[James II]] died on 16 September and Louis reneged on his earlier recognition of the Protestant [[William III of England|William III]] as King of England and Scotland by acknowledging the Catholic Stuart heir, [[James Francis Edward]] as King. When William died in March 1702, his successor [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] confirmed her continuation of securing the Protestant succession and resisting French expansion. The Dutch did the same and on 15 May the Grand Alliance declared war on France, followed by the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] on 30 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolf|first1=John|title=Louis XIV|date=1968|publisher=WW Norton &amp; Co|isbn=978-0393007534|page=514|edition=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key strategic drivers==
[[File:Grand Strategy, War of the Spanish Succession.png|thumb|upright=1.6|France's central position required the Grand Alliance to attack on multiple fronts and divide its substantial military resources.]]
'''Economic:''' The importance of trade and economic interests to the participants is often under estimated; contemporaries viewed Dutch and English support for the Habsburg cause as primarily driven by a desire for access to the Spanish American markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schmidt Voges, Inken (ed)|first1=Solana Crespo, Ana (ed)|title=New Worlds?: Transformations in the Culture of International Relations Around the Peace of Utrecht (Politics and Culture in Europe, 1650-1750)|date=2017|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1472463906|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern economics generally assumes a constantly growing market whereas the then dominant theory of [[Mercantilism]] viewed it as static. As a result, increasing your share of trade implied taking it from someone else, with the government's role being to restrict foreign competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rothbard|first1=Murray|title=Mercantilism as the Economic Side of Absolutism|url=https://mises.org/library/mercantilism-economic-side-absolutism|website=Mises.org|publisher=Good summary of the concept|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trade was often used as a policy weapon; between 1690-1704, English import duties increased by 400%, while the 1651-1663 [[Navigation Acts]] were a major factor in the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]]. On 6 September 1700, France banned the import of English manufactured goods like cloth and imposed prohibitive duties on a wide range of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schaeper|first1=Thomas|title=French and English Trade after Utrecht|journal=Journal for Eighteenth Century Studies|date=March 1986|volume=9|issue=1|page=1|doi=10.1111/j.1754-0208.1986.tb00117.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Military:''' the armies engaged in the [[Nine Years War]] often exceeded 100,000 men and proved too large for the pre-industrial economies of its participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Childs|first1=John|title=The Nine Years' War and the British Army, 1688-1697: The Operations in the Low Countries|date=1991|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0719089961|page=2|edition=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those of 1701-1714 averaged around 35,000 - 50,000 but a dependence on water-borne transport accentuated the importance of rivers like the Rhine in Germany or the Adda in Northern Italy. Reliance on the local countryside for resupply limited operations in poor areas like Northern Spain; these factors confined campaigns to the same general areas.{{efn|Similar to the North African campaigns of 1940-42 where the British and German/Italians fought along the same coastal strip.}}

==War aims and major parties==
[[File:Bakhuizen, Battle of Vigo Bay.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|An Anglo-Dutch squadron captures a Spanish treasure fleet, Vigo Bay October 1702]]
===Britain (England and Scotland pre-1707)===
Alignment on reducing the power of France and securing the Protestant succession masked differences on how to achieve them. In general, the Tories favoured a mercantilist strategy of using the [[Royal Navy]] to attack French and Spanish trade while protecting and expanding their own; land commitments were viewed as expensive and primarily of benefit to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shinsuke|first1=Satsuma|title=Britain and Colonial Maritime War in the Early Eighteenth Century|date=2013|publisher=Boydell Press|location=Overview of arguments used|isbn=978-1843838623|page=37 passim}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Whigs argued France could not be defeated by seapower alone, making a Continental strategy essential. Britain's financial strength made it the only member of the Alliance able to operate on all fronts against France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ostwald, James|first1=Murray &amp; Sinnreich (ed)|title=Creating the British way of war: English strategy in the War of the Spanish Succession|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=in; Successful Strategies: Triumphing in War and Peace from Antiquity to the Present|isbn=978-1107633599|pages=100–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Dutch Republic===
The Dutch provided much of the manpower for the campaigns in the Low Countries; while Marlborough was accepted as the Allied commander, in the early years strategy in that theatre was subject to their approval. Dutch priorities were to re-stablish and strengthen the Barrier fortresses, retain control of the Scheldt estuary and gain access to trade in the Spanish Empire.
[[File:II. Rákóczi Ferenc Mányoki.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Francis Rákóczi; leader of the 1703-1711 Hungarian revolt that was a major distraction for Austria]]

===Austria/ The Holy Roman Empire===
Despite Austria being the seat of the Holy Roman Empire, Austrian and Imperial interests did not always coincide. For much of the war, the Austrian Habsburgs focused on securing their southern borders in northern Italy and suppressing [[Rákóczi's War of Independence]] in Hungary. Putting Archduke Charles on the Spanish throne was not an explicit objective for them. The crucial campaign in Spain was reliant on the so-called "Maritime Powers" (England and the Dutch Republic) and also a higher priority for them.

By formalising religious divisions within the Empire, the [[Peace of Westphalia|1648 Peace of Westphalia]] weakened its integrity and by 1700, the larger German states were pursuing their own policies. [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]] allied itself with France while as King of Poland, [[Augustus II the Strong|Augustus of Saxony]] was fully occupied by the [[Great Northern War]]. To gain [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick of Prussia]]'s support, Leopold recognised him as King, with Prussia made an equal member of the Grand Alliance.{{efn|The perceived tendency of the Austrian Habsburgs to agree concessions and then avoid implementation bred mistrust among their allies.}} [[George I of Great Britain|Elector George of Hanover]] was more reliable, given his position as heir to the British throne but the suspicion remained the interests of Hanover came first.&lt;ref&gt;Ingrao: ''In Quest'', 39–40; Veenendaal: ''The War of the Spanish Succession in Europe'', 410–1&lt;/ref&gt; The role played by many of the minor German states and neutrals like Denmark was primarily in hiring out their troops to members of the Grand Alliance.
[[File:Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Victor Amadeus of Savoy (1666-1732)]]
'''France''' Under Louis XIV, France was the most powerful state in Europe with revenue-generating capacities that far exceeded its rivals. Its geographical position provided enormous tactical flexibility, unlike Austria it had its own navy and as the campaigns of 1708-10 proved, even under severe pressure it could defend its borders. The Nine Years War had shown France could not impose its objectives without support but the alliance with Spain and Bavaria made a successful outcome far more likely. Apart from denying an undivided Spanish Monarchy to others, Louis' objectives were to secure his borders with Germany, weaken Austria and increase French commercial strength by access to the Americas trade.

'''Spain''' Their key objective was as far as possible to preserve an undivided and independent Monarchy. During the 17th century, a series of wars with France drained military and financial resources, with the economy subject to long periods of low productivity and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Storrs|first1=Christopher|title=The Decline of Spain in the Seventeenth Century|url=http://gale.cengage.co.uk/images/SpainChristopherStorrs.pdf|website=State Papers Online|publisher=Gale;Cengage Learning|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish monarchy was a personal union of the Crowns of [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] and [[Aragon]], {{efn|The Crown of Aragon was divided into the Kingdoms of Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, Majorca, Naples, Sicily, Malta and Sardinia.}} each with very different political cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jon Cowans|title=Modern Spain: A Documentary History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IcmrVmq0_-8C&amp;pg=PA26|year=2003|publisher=U. of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-1846-6|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of weak central control, war and a depressed economy meant government finances were in perpetual crisis.

'''Savoy''' During the Nine Years War, [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoy]] joined the Grand Alliance in 1690 before agreeing a separate peace with France in 1696. The Duchy was strategically important as it provided access to the southern borders of Austria and France. Philip's accession as King of Spain in 1701 placed Savoy between the Spanish-ruled [[Duchy of Milan]] and France, while the Savoyard [[County of Nice]] and [[County of Savoy]] were in Transalpine France and very difficult to defend.

[[Victor Amadeus II]] allied with France in 1701 but his long-term goal was the acquisition of Milan; neither France, Austria or Spain would relinquish this voluntarily, leaving Britain as the only power that could. After the Royal Navy established control over the Western Mediterranean in 1703, Savoy changed sides.

===Italy===

[[File:North Italy 1700.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Northern Italy; Milan and Savoy were the primary areas of conflict]]
The war was fought over the Spanish-ruled Duchies of Milan and Mantua in Northern Italy considered essential to the security of Austria's southern borders. In 1701, French garrisons occupied Milan and Mantua and [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia|Victor Amadeus II]], Duke of Savoy, allied with France, his daughter [[Maria Luisa of Savoy|Maria Luisa]] marrying Philip V.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dhondt, Frederik|first1=De Ruysscher, Capelle, K et al.

However, in July 1706 Vendôme and any available forces were sent to reinforce France's northern frontier after the defeat at Ramillies. Reinforced by German auxiliaries, Prince Eugene marched on Turin and the siege was broken by the [[Battle of Turin]] on 7 September. Despite a minor French victory at [[Battle of Castiglione (1706)|Castiglione]], the war in Italy was over; the Convention of Milan in March 1707 confirmed Austria's control of Milan and Mantua, with French troops given free passage back to France for redeployment elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sundstrom|first1=Roy A|title=Sidney Godolphin: Servant of the State|date=1992|publisher=EDS Publications Ltd|isbn=978-0874134384|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An attack by forces from Italy on the French base of [[Toulon]] was planned for 1707 but was postponed when 10,000 Imperial troops were diverted in June to seize the Spanish Bourbon [[Kingdom of Naples]].{{efn|Without significant naval forces of its own, Austria could not take Sicily and the Kingdom was recaptured by Spain in 1734.}} The delays contributed to the failure of the siege of [[Battle of Toulon (1707)|Toulon]]; by the end of 1707, fighting in Italy ceased apart from attempts by Victor Amadeus to recover his trans-Alpine territories of Nice and Savoy.{{efn|These became part of France in 1860.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Symcox|first1=Geoffrey|title=Victor Amadeus; Absolutism in the Savoyard State, 1675-1730|date=1985|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520049741|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low Countries, Rhine and Danube===

[[File:Holy Roman Empire c. 1700.png|thumb|right|upright=1.6|Holy Roman Empire; main actions occurred along the Moselle, Rhine and Upper Danube.]]
The first objective for the Grand Alliance in this theatre was to secure the Dutch frontiers, threatened by the alliance between France, Bavaria and [[Joseph Clemens]], ruler of [[Liège]] and [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]]. During 1702, the Barrier fortresses were retaken along with [[Kaiserswerth]], [[Venlo]], [[Roermond]] and [[Liège]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p.275.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1703 campaign was marred by Allied conflicts over strategy; they failed to take [[Antwerp]], while the Dutch defeat at [[Ekeren]] in June led to bitter recriminations.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p.280-281.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[Upper Rhine]], Imperial forces under [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Louis of Baden]] remained on the defensive, although they took [[Siege of Landau (1702)|Landau]] in 1702. Over the course of 1703, French victories at [[Friedlingen]], [[First Battle of Höchstädt|Höchstädt]] and [[Speyerbach]] with the capture of [[Siege of Kehl (1703)|Kehl]], [[Breisach]] and Landau directly threatened Vienna.

In 1704, Franco-Bavarian forces continued their advance with the Austrians struggling to suppress [[Rákóczi's War of Independence|Rákóczi's revolt]] in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;Ingrao: ''In Quest'', 123; McKay: ''Eugene'', 73&lt;/ref&gt; To relieve the pressure, Marlborough marched up the Rhine, joined forces with Louis of Baden and Prince Eugene and crossed the Danube on 2 July. Allied victory at [[Battle of Blenheim|Blenheim]] on 13 August forced Bavaria out of the war and the [[Treaty of Ilbersheim]] placed it under Austrian rule.{{efn|Max Emmanuel remained a French general, fighting in many of the battles of 1705-08.}}&lt;ref&gt; Lynn p.286-294.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pursuit of the French after the Battle of Ramillies.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Ramillies, May 1706; defeat forced France onto the defensive for the rest of the war]]
Allied efforts to exploit their victory in 1705 foundered on poor co-ordination, tactical disputes and command rivalries, while Leopold's ruthless rule in Bavaria caused a brief but vicious [[Bavarian People's Uprising|peasant revolt]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p.298-299.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1706 an Allied force under Marlborough shattered a French army at the [[Battle of Ramillies]]; as French numbers had been maximised by stripping garrisons from the Spanish Netherlands, the entire province fell to the Allies in under two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holmes|first1=Richard|title=Marlborough: England's Fragile Genius|date=2008|publisher=Harper|isbn=978-0007225729|pages=347–349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This eliminated French offensive capabilities for the rest of the war but despite taking key strongpoints like [[Siege of Lille (1708)|Lille]], the Allies were unable to make a decisive breach in the French frontiers. An internal revolt in early 1708 led to the temporary loss of parts of the Spanish Netherlands; this was restored by victory at [[Oudenarde]] in July but the overall position remained largely unchanged from 1706.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, p.320-323.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain and Portugal===
[[File:Spain 1702-1714.png|thumb|right|300px|Peninsular Spain, showing Crowns of Castile and Aragon.]]
Victory in Spain was vital if Archduke Charles were to win the throne but the Habsburgs viewed Northern Italy and suppressing the Hungarian revolt as higher priorities. Anglo-Dutch involvement was driven by the mercantilist strategy of securing trade in the Mediterranean and gaining commercial access to the Spanish Empire. This made Spain more important to the Dutch and English than Austria and dependent on their support, a conflict that was never really solved.

Spain was a union between the Crowns of [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] and [[Aragon]], {{efn|Similar to England and Scotland.}} with Aragon then divided into the [[Principality of Catalonia]] plus the Kingdoms of [[Aragon]], [[Valencia]], [[Majorca]], [[Sicily]], [[Naples]] and [[Sardinia]]. Majorca, Naples, Sicily and Sardinia declared for Philip in 1701; a mixture of anti-Castilian and anti-French sentiment meant Catalonia, most of Aragon and Valencia supported Archduke Charles but this simplifies a very complex reality. 
[[File:Balaca-Battle of Almansa.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Almansa, April 1707; Bourbon victory was a serious setback for the Allies in Spain.]]
Anglo-Dutch strategy required a naval base in the area; the attack on [[Battle of Cádiz (1702)|Cádiz]] in September 1702 ended in failure but victory at [[Battle of Vigo Bay|Vigo Bay]] in October persuaded [[Peter II of Portugal]] to abandon the Bourbons and join the Grand Alliance in May 1703.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Francis|first1=AD|title=Portugal and the Grand Alliance|journal=Historical Research|date=May 1965|volume=38|issue=97|pages=71–93|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2281.1965.tb01638.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gave the Allies access to [[Lisbon]] and in March 1704, the newly crowned Charles III of Spain arrived in Portugal to begin a land campaign.

In May 1704, a Bourbon army won a series of minor victories along the Spain/Portugal border, offset by the Allied capture of [[Capture of Gibraltar|Gibraltar]], a vital strategic possession. Attempts to retake it were defeated at the naval [[Battle of Vélez-Málaga|Battle of Málaga]] in August, with a land siege being abandoned in April 1705.&lt;ref name="Lynn, P.296"&gt;Lynn, p.296.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1705, the 'Pact of Genoa' between Catalan representatives and England opened a second front in the north-east; the loss of [[Siege of Barcelona (1705)|Barcelona]] and Valencia left [[Toulon]] as the only major port available to the Bourbons in the Western Mediterranean.&lt;ref name="Lynn, P.302"&gt;Lynn, p.302.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip tried to retake Barcelona in May 1706 but was repulsed, his absence allowing an Allied force from Portugal to enter Madrid and [[Zaragossa]]. The Allies could not be resupplied so far from their bases and had to withdraw; by November, Philip controlled Castile, [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]] and parts of Valencia.

Attempts to regain the initiative in 1707 ended with Allied defeats at [[Almansa]] in April and Toulon in August, once again restricting Archduke Charles to Catalonia. The British capture of [[Capture of Menorca (1708)|Menorca]] in 1708 combined with possession of Gibraltar gave them control of the Western Mediterranean. By the end of 1708, British objectives had largely been achieved, Portugal and the Dutch Republic were financially exhausted while Austria refused to commit significant resources to putting Charles on the throne of Spain.

==No peace without Spain; 1709–1713==

By the end of 1708, the war had reached stalemate; the French had withdrawn from Northern Italy, with Austria gaining the Spanish possessions of Milan and Naples. In the Low Countries, Ramillies and Oudenarde gave the Maritime Powers control of the Spanish Netherlands and secured the borders of the Dutch Republic; in the Mediterranean, Britain's Royal Navy had achieved naval supremacy and permanent bases in Gibraltar and Menorca.

However, France's frontiers remained largely intact while the Grand Alliance had been unable to make any lasting progress in Spain, where Philip proved to be far more popular with the Spanish than the Austrian candidate Archduke Charles. Many of the objectives originally set out by the Grand Alliance in 1701 had been achieved but the victories of 1706 made them overconfident, resulting in the continuation of a war most participants wanted to end but could not.

===Diplomacy===
[[File:The Battle of Malplaquet, 1709.png|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Malplaquet 1709: ostensibly an Allied victory, the losses shocked Europe and increased the desire for peace.]]
France began peace talks with the Dutch in 1705, viewing them as the most likely to favour a quick end to the war; Ramillies increased this by removing the direct military threat to the Dutch Republic and highlighting Allied differences on the Spanish Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bromley|first1=JS|title=The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 6, The Rise of Great Britain and Russia|date=1970|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521293969|page=446|edition=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, these made little progress since the Allies had agreed to negotiate jointly, not separately and they were unable to reach internal agreement on the terms.
[[File:Vendome-and-PhilipV.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Battle of Villaviciosa, December 1710; tactical draw, strategic Bourbon victory]]
The winter of 1708 in Europe was one of the coldest on record, with widespread crop failures and famine exacerbated in France and Spain by a British naval blockade of grain imports. The French re opened talks and in May 1709, the Allies presented the terms known as the Preliminaries of Hague; they included the demand Philip cede his throne to Archduke Charles without compensation and France assist in his removal by force if this was not done within two months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ward, William,|first1=Leathes, Stanley|title=The Cambridge Modern History|date=1912|publisher=Nabu|isbn=978-1174382055|pages=422–423|edition=2010|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Sqw8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA423&amp;lpg=PA423&amp;dq=the+preliminaries+of+hague+1709#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20preliminaries%20of%20hague%201709&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assumed Philip would abdicate on request and the Spanish accept Archduke Charles while seriously under-estimating France's ability to resist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kamen|first1=Henry|title=Philip V of Spain: The King Who Reigned Twice|date=2001|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300180541|pages=70–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louis was willing to abandon Spain but not make war on his own grandson; when it became public, the demand was considered so offensive that it strengthened French resolve to fight on.&lt;ref&gt; Ward, William, page 424 &lt;/ref&gt;

Marlborough now launched an offensive in Northern France which led to the [[Battle of Malplaquet]] on 11 September 1709 between an Allied army of 86,000 and a French of 75,000. Victory cost the Allies over 20,000 casualties, demonstrated the fighting ability of the French army remained intact and increased war-weariness both in Britain and the Dutch Republic, who suffered heavy losses.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, Edward; Page 289 &lt;/ref&gt; This was compounded by the Bourbon recapture of [[Alicante]] in April and the defeat of an Anglo-Portuguese force at [[Battle of La Gudina|La Gudina]] in May.

Lack of progress accentuated the reality that the Allies no longer shared clear objectives, highlighted by Dutch exclusion from an agreement between Britain and Archduke Charles for trading rights in Spanish America. The British government compensated with the 1709 [[Barrier Treaty|First Barrier Treaty]]; this gave the Dutch effective control of the Spanish Netherlands but was seen as detrimental to British commerce and increased domestic opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, Edward; Page 289 &lt;/ref&gt;

The Whigs won the [[British general election, 1708|1708 British general election]] by arguing military victory was the quickest road to peace but failure in France was followed by the same in Spain. Archduke Charles re-entered Madrid in 1710 after victories at [[Almenar]] and [[Saragossa]] but lack of supplies forced him to retreat; 3,500 British troops surrendered at [[Battle of Brihuega|Brihuega]] on 8 December and while [[Battle of Villaviciosa|Villaviciosa]] on 10 December was a tactical draw, it confirmed Bourbon control of Spain. British financial power was essential for the Allies to continue but the pro-peace Tories won a landslide victory in the [[British general election, 1710|1710 British election]].

===Negotiations===
[[File:Queen Anne by John Closterman.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Queen Anne (1665–1714); her declining health increasingly dominated British domestic politics and attitudes to the war]]
[[File:Jonathan Swift by Charles Jervas detail.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.9|Jonathan Swift; Tory satirist and creator of the first sustained campaign in moulding British public opinion.]]
Negotiations resumed in March 1710 at [[Geertruidenberg]] but broke down due to the continued insistence France expel Philip by force if he refused to abdicate. The new British government confirmed its commitment to the war to prevent a credit crisis and reassure its Allies; despite the capture of [[Siege of Bouchain|Bouchain]] in September, decisive victory in Northern France continued to elude the Allies while an expedition against [[Quebec Expedition|Quebec]] in French North America ended in disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simms|first1=Brendan|title=Three Victories and a Defeat: The Rise and Fall of the First British Empire, 1714–1783|date=2008|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0140289848|pages=60–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British political situation was simplified when Emperor Joseph died in April 1711 and Archduke Charles elected Emperor in October. The purpose of continuing the war was unclear, since union of Spain with Austria was as unwelcome as one with France and as the Tory propagandist [[Jonathan Swift]] pointed out, the 1701 Treaty made no reference to removing Philip.{{efn|The most famous being his pamphlet titled [[The Conduct of the Allies]].}} Even the Whigs had grown frustrated by the Habsburg tendency to put their interests first e.g. the 1707 Convention of Milan or the diversion of resources to capturing Naples in 1707.

The British secretly negotiated peace terms directly with France leading to the signing of the Preliminary Articles of London on 8 October 1711.{{efn|Also known as the Mesnager Convention.}} These included French acceptance of the Act of Settlement and a guarantee the French and Spanish crowns would remain separate, while France undertook to ensure Spain ceded Gibraltar and Menorca and award the [[Asiento]] to Britain for 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bromley|first1=JS|title=The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 6, The Rise of Great Britain and Russia|date=1970|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521293969|pages=459–460|edition=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with a commitment to the Dutch Barrier, these would form the basis of the Treaty of Utrecht.

Despite their annoyance at being excluded from the Anglo-French negotiations, the Dutch were financially exhausted by the enormous cost of the war and could not continue without British support. Charles VI rejected the idea of a peace conference; once the Dutch agreed to support it, he reluctantly agreed rather than be isolated but Habsburg opposition to the Treaty continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dadson, Trevor (ed)|first1=Thompson, Andrew|title=The Utrecht Settlement and its Aftermath in Britain, Spain and the Treaty of Utrecht 1713-2013|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1909662223|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Peace of Utrecht===
[[File:Villars a Denain1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Denain, July 1712; defeat ended Austrian and Dutch hopes of a breakthrough in Northern France]]
Within weeks of the conference opening, events threatened the basis of the peace agreed between Britain and France. First, the French presented proposals awarding the Spanish Netherlands to Max Emmanuel of Bavaria and a minimal Barrier, leaving the Dutch with little to show for their huge investment of money and men. Second, a series of deaths left Louis XIV's two year old great-grandson, the future [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] as heir, making Philip next in line and his immediate renunciation imperative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Somerset|first1=Anne|title=Queen Anne: The Politics of Passion|date=2012|publisher=Harper Press|isbn=978-0007203765|page=470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch and Austrians fought on, hoping to improve their negotiating position but the British government issued 'Restraining Orders' to Marlborough's replacement, the [[James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde|Duke of Ormonde]], instructing him not to participate in offensive operations against the French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gregg|first1=Edward|title=Queen Anne (Revised) (The English Monarchs Series)|date=1980|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300090246|page=354|edition=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; These caused fury then and later with prominent Whigs urging the Hanoverian envoy in London to support military intervention by the future George I.{{efn|George I regarded those involved with deep suspicion and hostility; Ormonde, [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Henry St John, Viscount Bolingbroke]], alleged architect of the Orders and others were effectively driven into exile and became prominent Jacobites.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Somerset|first1=Anne|title=Queen Anne: The Politics of Passion|date=2012|publisher=Harper Press|isbn=978-0007203765|page=477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince Eugene captured [[Le Quesnoy]] in June and besieged [[Landrecies]] but was defeated at [[Battle of Denain|Denain]] on 24 July; the French went on to recapture Le Quesnoy and many towns lost in previous years, including Marchines, Douai and Bouchain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holmes|first1=Richard|title=Marlborough: England's Fragile Genius|date=2008|publisher=Harper|isbn=978-0007225729|page=462}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch finally reached the end of their willingness and ability to continue the war.

[[File:Treaty of Utrecht 1713.png|thumb|right|upright=1.15| The Treaty of Utrecht; [[Abraham Allard]], 18th century]]
On 6 June, Philip had announced his renunciation of the French throne; the British Tory government now offered the Dutch a revised [[Barrier Treaty]], replacing that of 1709 which they rejected as overly generous. It was a significant improvement on the 1697 Barrier but ultimately subject to Austrian approval and the final terms were less beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Myers|title=Violation of Treaties: Bad Faith, Nonexecution and Disregard|journal=The American Journal of International Law|date=1917|volume=11|issue=4|pages=799–829 passim}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Charles withdrew from the Conference when France insisted on a guarantee that Austria would not seek to acquire Mantua or [[Mirandola]]; he was supported by George, Elector of Hanover, who wanted France to withdraw their support for the Stuart heir [[James Francis Edward Stuart|James Francis]]. This meant neither Austria or the Empire signed the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 11 April 1713 between France and the other Allies; Spain made peace with the Dutch in June, then Savoy and Britain on 13 July 1713.

===The treaties of Rastatt and Baden===

Fighting continued on the Rhine but Austria was financially exhausted and after the loss of Landau and Freiburg in November 1713, Charles came to terms. The [[Treaty of Rastatt]] on 7 March 1714 confirmed Austrian gains in Italy, returned Breisach, [[Kehl]] and Freiburg, ended French support for the Hungarian revolt and agreed terms for the Dutch Barrier fortresses. Charles abandoned his claim to Strasbourg and Alsace and agreed to the restoration of the Wittelsbach Electors of Bavaria and Cologne, Max Emmanuel and Joseph Clemens. Article XIX of the treaty transferred sovereignty over the Spanish Netherlands to Austria.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Malettke, ''Les relations entre la France et le Saint-Empire au XVIIe siècle'', Honoré Champion, Paris, 2001, p. 645–647.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Frey|editor1-first=Linda|editor2-last=Frey|editor2-first=Marsha|title=The Treaties of the War of the Spanish Succession: An Historical and Critical Dictionary|date=1995|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=978-0313278846|pages=374–375}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 September, the Holy Roman Empire joined the agreement by the [[Treaty of Baden (1714)|Treaty of Baden]]; although Catalonia and Majorca were not finally subdued by the Bourbons until June 1715, the war was over.

==Aftermath==
[[File:The Battle of Cape Passaro.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The Royal Navy destroys a Spanish fleet off Sicily, Cape Passaro, August 1718.]]
The Peace of Utrecht stipulated that "because of the great danger which threatened the liberty and safety of all Europe, from the too close conjunction of the kingdoms of Spain and France, [...] one and the same person should never become King of both kingdoms."&lt;ref&gt;Article II, Peace and Friendship Treaty of Utrecht.&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians view this as a key point in the evolution of the modern nation state, while legal historian [[Randall Lesaffer]] also argues that it marks a significant milestone in the concept of collective security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lesaffer|first1=Randall|title=The peace of Utrecht and the balance of power|url=https://blog.oup.com/2014/11/utrecht-peace-treaty-balance-power-europe/|website=OUP Blog|accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip was confirmed as King of Spain, which retained its independence and the majority of its Empire but ceded the Spanish Netherlands and most of their Italian possessions. The 1707 ''Nueva Planta'' decrees transferred powers to Madrid and largely abolished regional political structures.{{efn|Aragon and Valencia were brought into the system in 1712, Catalonia and Majorca following in 1767.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vives Vi|first1=Jaime|title=An Economic History of Spain|date=1969|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691051659|page=591|url=https://books.google.com/?id=i1DWCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA591&amp;lpg=PA591&amp;dq=deputation+of+the+aragon#v=onepage&amp;q=deputation%20of%20the%20aragon&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reforms enabled Spain to recover remarkably quickly and only British naval power prevented them regaining Naples and Sicily in 1718.

Despite its failure in Spain, Austria secured its position in Italy and Hungary and acquired the bulk of the Spanish Netherlands. Even after reimbursing the Dutch for most of the expenses associated with their Barrier, the increased tax revenues helped fund a significant expansion of Austrian military forces.&lt;ref name="Falkner, The War of the Spanish Succession"&gt;Falkner, location 4173-4181.&lt;/ref&gt; The acquisition of maritime territories in the Netherlands and Italy increased the potential for conflict in an area where Austria had traditionally relied on others and Spain recaptured Sicily and Naples during the [[War of the Polish Succession]] in 1734.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=MS|title=The War of Austrian Succession 1740-1748|date=1995|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0582059504|pages=7–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victory in the [[Austro-Turkish War of 1716–18]] continued the trend of Habsburg focus shifting away from Germany and into South-East Europe. Their hold over the Empire weakened, with Bavaria, Hanover, Prussia and Saxony increasingly acting as independent powers; in 1742, [[Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles of Bavaria]] became the first non-Habsburg Emperor in over 300 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lindsay |first1=JO |title=The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 7, The Old Regime, 1713-1763 |date=1957 |publisher=Cambridge University Press; New Edition edition |isbn=978-0521045452 |page=420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch Republic ended the war effectively bankrupt and the 1715 Barrier Treaty that had cost so much proved largely illusory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kubben|first1=Raymond|title=Regeneration and Hegemony; Franco-Batavian Relations in the Revolutionary Era 1795-1803|date=2011|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff|isbn=978-9004185586|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forts were quickly overrun in 1740, Britain's promise of military support against an aggressor proving to be far more effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ward|first1=Adolphus William|title=The Cambridge History of British Foreign Policy, Volume 2|date=1922|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1108040136|page=57|edition=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The damage suffered by the Dutch merchant navy permanently affected their commercial and political strength and it was superseded by Britain as the pre-eminent European mercantile power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dadson, Trevor (ed)|first1=Elliott, John|title=The Road to Utrecht in Britain, Spain and the Treaty of Utrecht 1713-2013|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1909662223|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis XIV died on 1 September 1715, with his five-year-old great-grandson reigning as Louis XV until 1774; on his deathbed, he is alleged to have admitted 'I have loved war too well.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Colville|first1=Alfred|title=Studies in Anglo-French History During the Eighteenth, Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries|date=1935|publisher=Forgotten Books|isbn=978-1528022392|page=149|edition=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; True or not, while the final settlement was far more favourable than the Allied offer of 1709, it is hard to see what Louis gained that had not already been achieved through diplomacy by February 1701. France remained strong but could not maintain its former dominance, particularly in relation to Britain; concern over this relative decline in military and economic terms was an underlying cause of the [[War of the Austrian Succession]].&lt;ref name="Lynn, The Wars of Louis XIV"&gt;Lynn, p.361-362.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wider implications include the beginning of the rise of Prussia and Savoy while many of the participants were involved in the 1700-1721 [[the Great Northern War]], with Russia becoming a European power for the first time as a result. Finally, while colonial conflicts were relatively minor and largely confined to the North American theatre or the so-called [[Queen Anne's War]], they were to become a key element in future wars.

==Prizes==
[[file:World Press Freedom Day 2017.webm|thumb|GIS Director, Clement Wulf-Soulage in 2017]]
[[UNESCO]] marks World Press Freedom Day by conferring the [[UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize]] on a deserving individual, organisation or institution that has made an outstanding contribution to the defence and/or promotion of press freedom anywhere in the world, especially when this has been achieved in the face of danger. Created in 1997, the prize is awarded on the recommendation of an independent jury of 14 news professionals. Names are submitted by regional and international [[non-governmental organisations]] working for [[press freedom]], and by UNESCO member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/news/unesco-seeking-nominations-unescoguillermo-cano-world-press-freedom-prize-2018-deadline-15|title=UNESCO is seeking nominations for UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize 2018 - DEADLINE 15 February|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prize is named in honour of [[Guillermo Cano Isaza]], a [[Colombia]]n [[journalist]] who was assassinated in front of the offices of his newspaper, ''[[El Espectador]],'' in [[Bogotá]], on 17 December 1986. Cano's writings had offended Colombia's powerful drug barons.

==UNESCO conference==
UNESCO also marks World Press Freedom Day each year by bringing together media professionals, press freedom organisations and UN agencies to assess the state of press freedom worldwide and discuss solutions for addressing challenges. Each conference is centred on a theme related to press freedom, including good [[governance]], media coverage of [[terrorism]], [[impunity]] and the role of media in post-[[War|conflict]] countries.

'''Østre Gasværk Teater''' ([[literal translation|lit.]] "East Gasworks Theatre") is a [[theatre]] in the [[Østerbro]] district of [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], located in an abandoned [[gas holder|gasometer]] of the former Østre Gasværk (English: Eastern Gasworks). The theatre is constructed within the [[masonry|masonry shell]] that used to house the [[gas holder]] proper. Built in 1883, it was designed by [[Martin Nyrop]], also known for the design of the [[Copenhagen City Hall]].

==History==
The gasworks of Østre Gasværk was opened in 1878 as the city's second gasworks, when the first Vestre Gasværk, a facility located at the site of the current [[Meatpacking District, Copenhagen|Meatpacking District]], no longer could satisfy the rapidly growing demand for gas. The gasometer now housing Østre Gasværk Teater was constructed in 1881-83 as the first of a series of expansions that four-doubled the capacity of the plant in the time up to the turn of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aok.dk/teater/gasvaerket|title=Gasværket|publisher=AOK|accessdate=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 it was shut down and was for a while used as a storage for decorations for the [[Royal Danish Theatre|Royal Theatre]], while awaiting demolition.

From 1979, the building started a second life as a venue for various plays and performances. The first big own production was [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' directed by [[Peter Langdal]] in 1986. From 1992-98 the theatre had big success with musicals, including ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'', ''[[Miss Saigon]]'' and ''[[Atlantis (musical)|Atlantis]]''.
