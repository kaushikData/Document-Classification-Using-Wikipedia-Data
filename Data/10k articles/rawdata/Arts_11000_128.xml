*Thousands of full-length [[film]]s were produced during the 1990s.
*Many films were specifically filmed or edited to be displayed both on theater screens as well as on the smaller TV screens, such as showing close-up scenes during dialog, rather than just wide-angle scenes in a room.

''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995) became the first [[feature length]] film to be completely computer animated, heralding its use as a tool for filmmakers to achieve new visuals for film.
*The [[Disney Renaissance]] began in 1989 with ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', reached its peak in popularity with ''[[The Lion King]]'' in 1994, and ended in 1999 with ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]''.

[[File:Praia-Palácio Presidencial (1).jpg|thumb|right|350px|The Presidential Palace, one of the most renowned buildings in Cape Verde]]
The '''Architecture of Cape Verde''' has different architectural styles in the nation.  Unlike the African mainland, Cape Verde was uninhabited until 1461 when the Portuguese arrived, most of the other islands were first inhabited after the end of the 15th century.  Its architecture was introduced in the 1460s and has its first origins from Portuguese settlers from the Madeira Islands, after the first arrival of mainland Africans, a bit of African architecture would be elements mainly in rural areas. The Manueline was its first architectural style on the island, it was later followed by Renaissance, Baroque, Pombaline (late-Baroque and Neoclassical), Early Modern and Modern.  It was one of the last in the whole of Africa to introduce architecture late.  Cape Verde has one of the richest architecture in the western portion of West Africa, the sub-Saharan portion, the richest probably being Mali.

After independence, modern architecture along with African continued to be influenced in newer buildings and is now the dominant influence on its buildings in the nation today, in its newer resorts particularly in Sal features a mixture of Spanish, African, probably Mexican and Moorish elements of architecture including the Garupa and the Funana hotels, both owned by RIU.  Also [[Aristides Pereira International Airport]] has a mixture of African, Capeverdean and Arabic-Moorish architecture.

The nation also has several buildings and homes with a resemblance of Portuguese and mainland African architectural origins.

==Architectural styles==
Its main architectural styles includes [[funco (architecture)|funco]], dominant on the islands of Fogo, Santiago and Maio, [[loja (architecture)|loja]], used for bars and [[sobrado (architecture)|sobrado]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barbosa.acthus.com/historiasobrados.html|title=Acthus.com|website=Barbosa.acthus.com|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a house style particularly founded in the city of São Filipe in Fogo.  In the Colonial times, the funco style were mainly used for blacks, the loja style were once used for the mixed people and the sobrado style were for the white people used before independence.

==Colonial architecture==
{{Commonscat|Portuguese colonial architecture in Cape Verde}}[[File:Cidade Velha-Igreja Nossa Senhora do Rosário (1).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Nossa Senhora do Rosário (Our Lady of Rosary) church, the first colonial church in the world and the sub-Saharan portion of West Africa]]The first 500 years would have mainly Portuguese elements in its architecture and continued until the independence of Cape Verde in 1975.

===Manueline architecture===
When the city of Ribeira Grande (now [[Cidade Velha]]) was enlarged in its early years in the 1450s, in the 1490s and the start of the 15th century, [[Manueline style|Manueline architecture]]  would be featured in its buildings.  Some of its styles survived in some buildings in [[São Filipe, Cape Verde|São Filipe]].  The town's pillory (not a building) is one example, the other was [[Nossa Senhora do Rosário church (Cidade Velha)|Nossa Senhora do Rosário church]], the world's first colonial church and the Sé Cathedral.  After the [[Cassard expedition]] of 1712, all of its buildings were destroyed.  Its ruins remain on a few. By the 20th century, there were rebuilt in different locations and these buildings are part of UNESCO's [[World Heritage Site]] since 2009.

===Renaissance and Mannerist architecture===
[[File:ForteSFilipeQuarteis.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Ruins of the São Filipe fort]]Most of Cidade Velha's 500 buildings until the destruction of the French featured Renaissance and Mannerist architecture, it included the churches of São Roque, São Pedro, Monte Alverne, Nossa Senhora da Conceição,  the chapel of Santa Luzia, and the church and hospital of Santa Casa de Misericórdia.

[[Fort Real de São Filipe]] built on Achada de São Filipe sobre Ribeira Grande, a fort built in 1585 to protect from further attacks from corsairs after the damages during the [[Capture of Santiago (1585)|raid by Sir Francis Drake]], it was restored in 1968 and in 1999.  Minimal architectural changes occurred with the [[Philippine Dynasty|Habsburg Philippine Dynasty]] in the Portuguese Empire which included Cape Verde for sixty years.

===Restoration and Early Baroque architecture===
Fortim Carlota in São Filipe, Fogo are one of the buildings, a fortress featuring Restoration era architecture.  The Convent of Saint Francis (São Francisco) in Cidade Velha was built in the mid-16th century, it was destroyed by the French in 1712 during a raid and has been restored.

===Pombaline architecture===
====Late Baroque architecture====
[[Ribeira Grande, Cape Verde|Ribeira Grande]] has examples of late 18th century architecture in the center of the city.

As the colonial capital of Praia was moved in 1770, some architectural buildings were added including the warehouses and the port office, late Baroque Pombaline architecture appeared in Praia, almost all of these would be demolished by around the late 19th century and were replaced by neoclassical buildings.  Only the warehouse survives today which is in Praia da Gamboa.

Other examples is São Filipe's Our Lady of Conception church ( ''Nossa Senhora da Conceição'') which was built in a comparatively simple style at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=lipps&gt;Susanne Lipps: ''Kapverdische Inseln'', p. 253-254. Ostfildern 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Opposite the church there are several well-preserved colonial houses dating from the 18th century.  Another one was the Pedra de Lume saltworks built in the early 20th century and its residential complexes.

====Neoclassical architecture====
[[File:Palacio Governador (S Vicente, Cabo Verde).JPG|thumb|300px|Palácio do Povo, Mindelo which serves as the center of the administration of the island, it features an Indian building style, its walls and fences are colored in pink]][[File:São Filipe-Musée municipal (4).jpg|thumb|left|300px|Museu Municipal de São Filipe, located in what was a sobrado style house]]
Neoclassical architecture dominated the building styles from 1822 up to the start of the 20th century, its most prominent were in Praia, the [[Platô]] and Mindelo.  Praia underwent large modernization by the colonial governor [[João da Mata Chapuzet]], one of the buildings he designed was [[Quartel Jaime Mota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asemana.publ.cv/spip.php?article63659&amp;ak=1|title=Como estragar uma bela Praça|newspaper=A Semana|language=pt|date=30 April 2011|accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the buildings features roofs detached from its walls, common in Portugal and the Portuguese Empire at the time.
As [[Mindelo]] flourished in the mid to late 19th centuries with its coal refueling and telegraph services, numerous Pombaline and neoclassical architecture appeared across Mindelo. notable examples include [[Centro Nacional de Artesanato]] (founded as Centro de Artesanato), [[Palácio do Povo]] which features Indian style architecture with its walls and fences in pink, today which serves as the center of the island's administration and offices, others are [[Fortim d'El-Rei]] built in 1852 and used as a defense of Porto Grande and the city, the Mindelo Cultural Center, Mindelo Library, the old barracks, a replica of Lisbon's Torre de Belém, [[Paço do Concelho]], Liceu Gil Eanes, the former British consulate, the French Cultural Center, bandstands or kiosks of Praças Estreia and Amilcar Cabral and the Mindelo Cathedral of Our Lady of Grace.
[[File:Museu da tabanca, Assomada, Cape verde.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Museu da Tabanka, Assomada]][[File:Ponta do Sol 2.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Center of Ponta do Sol with its decorated street along with buildings with colonial architecture, one of them has modern architecture today]]
Other notable examples include those in Praia, the [[Praia, Cape Verde (municipality)|Praia City Hall]] and the buildings around [[Praça Alexandre Albuquerque|Albuquerque square]] (also the 12 de Setembro Square) including the kiosk, Escola Grande and its buildings around Loreno Square, [[Museu Etnográfico da Praia]], [[Pro-Cathedral of Our Lady of Grace, Praia|Praia Cathedral]], the former [[Banco Nacional Ultramarino]] (BNU) Praia branch which is now the headquarters of [[Banco Comercial do Atlântico]], Hospital Agostinho Neto (first as Praia Hospital), Praia Maria and Boutique hotels, Palácio Cultural Ildo Lobo, the building where [[Quintal da Música]] is located and most of all the [[Palácio Presidencial|Presidential Palace of Cape Verde]] with its luxuriant garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite work|last=Lesourd|first=Michel|title=Le Cap-Vert|publisher=Jaguar|place=Paris|page=75|isbn=978-2-86950-408-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Fogo in São Filipe including one that is now Casa de Memória, the town kiosk which is also used as a bandstand and the [[Museu Municipal de São Filipe]] featuring a traditional hut&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barbosa.acthus.com/historiasobrados.html|title=Ilha do Fogo - Históroa dos sobrados|trans-title=Fogo Island - History of Sobrados|website=Barbosa.acthus.com|accessdate=2017-09-09|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the municipal halls of Paul and Ribeira Grande.
[[File:Espargos- Sal.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The city center of Espargos founded as Preguiça, its first buildings features early modern architecture as the town was founded in the late 1940s]]

Other cities featuring late Pombaline and neoclassical architecture across Cape Verde are in the centers of Paul (Pombas), [[Ponta do Sol, Cape Verde|Ponta do Sol]], [[Porto Novo, Cape Verde|Porto Novo]], built when it was called Carvoeiros, [[Ribeira Brava, Cape Verde|Ribeira Brava]], [[Tarrafal de São Nicolau]], a few in [[Santa Maria, Cape Verde|Santa Maria]], [[Sal Rei]], [[Cidade do Maio]], [[Pedra Badejo]], [[Assomada]], [[Calheta de São Miguel]], [[Tarrafal, Cape Verde|Tarrafal]], [[Cova Figueira]], [[Mosteiros, Cape Verde|Mosteiros]], [[Furna, Cape Verde|Furna]], [[Fajã de Agua]] and [[Nova Sintra]] and villages including [[Rabil, Cape Verde|Rabil]] and [[Povoação Velha]], both on Boa Vista.

Other churches built that time included [[Nossa Senhora da Conceição church (Boa Vista)|Nossa Senhora da Conceição church]] located near Povoação Velha.

In the late 19th century, numerous lighthouses were built across Cape Verde and feature colonial architecture; notable ones includes [[Farol de D. Maria Pia|Farol de Ponta Temerosa]] in Praia, [[Farol de Fontes Pereira de Melo|Farol de Ponta Tumbo]] near Janela and Porto Novo, [[Farol de D. Amélia|Farol de São Pedro]] southwest of Mindelo which has a rectangular building, Sal's [[Farol da Ponta Norte]] and [[Farol da Ponta do Sinó]].  [[Farol de Pedra de Lume]], built in 1853 is a lighthouse that is also a chapel that has a white exterior, made out of tile and black and white horizontal bands painted on the roof and the edges, around it serves as a diurnal marking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imieiviaggi.info/capoverde/cv11.jpg|title=Image with a primitive tower and the diurnal marking|website=Imieiviaggi.info|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later neoclassical architecture in other parts of Praia are seen in Fazenda and [[Gamboa, Praia|Gamboa]] including the [[Electra (company)|Electra]] offices.

Today, some or most of the buildings in the Platô neighborhood have been demolished and replaced with newer buildings including [[Banco de Cabo Verde]]'s headquarters and the colorful buildings in the middle of [[Avenida Andrade Corvo]].

Building projects slowed at the early 20th century which was led by drought and rain shortages across Cape Verde at the time.

===Late colonial and early modern architecture===
Early modern architecture started to appear in newer buildings in the 1930s such as art nouveau.  During the time, [[Raul Pires Ferreira Chaves]] was director of public works for Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau, he also lived in Cape Verde for some years, he did architectural works including the terminal and facilities of the Sal International Airport (now known as [[Amílcar Cabral International Airport]]), [[Farol de Fiúra]] in the north point (Ponta Norte) of Sal, an urban plan for the square now known as 5 do Outubro in Praia.

There were hardly any building projects in Cape Verde during the Great Depression and the Famine of the 1940s and remained up until the 1950s.

A town founded for airport services, the center of Espargos once known as Preguiça features late colonial and early modern architecture, one of its buildings is the Sal Municipal Hall.

Several Mormon and Protestant churches built before independence have modern architecture.

Other buildings built during that time included Estádio da Fontinha (now [[Estádio Municipal Adérito Sena]]) in Mindelo and Liceu Domingos Ramos in the north of the plateau.  Seminaro de São José, located near Ponta Temerosa, Praia was also built during that time.

==Modern architecture==
After independence, as the population grew, a lot of buildings featuring modern architecture (or modernism) spread up and many buildings today have a flat roof as other modern buildings on the African mainland.  Many houses and some buildings have little, poor or no architecture today.  One of these were a building that is now part of the [[University of Cape Verde]], its main campus in [[Palmarejo]] and other buildings in the new section of Palmarejo.

Other areas with buildings that contain only modern architecture includes the towers of [[Gamboa, Praia|Gamboa/Chã das Areias]] in the center of Praia and nearby.  Another is an information pavilion near [[Barragem de Poilão]] in the middle of the island of Santiago.  Escola Jorge Barbosa and Hotel Porto Grande, both are in Mindelo also features modern architecture.  Constructed in the late 1990s, one of the most notable is the [[National Library of Cape Verde|National Library]] located in Várzea in the center of Praia.  The other is the headquarters of the [[Bank of Cape Verde]] in the Plateau, being one of the first glass buildings.

After the end of the 20th century, modern architecture are featured in several sports stadiums including the [[Estádio Marcelo Leitão]] in Espargos built in 2003, [[Estádio Municipal Arsénio Ramos]] in Sal Rei built in 2008 and [[Estádio Municipal do Porto Novo]] in 2009.  Also in some resorts and vilas, Afro-Moorish architecture appears in Santa Maria (Funana, Garupa) and near Sal Rei (Karamboa, also features Arabesque architecture) along with a mixture of modern Afro-Northern Mediterranean architecture in places like Ribeira do Rabil southeast of Sal Rei and Murdeira, Sal.  One of the recent international airports constructed was the [[Aristides Pereira International Airport]], the airport of Boa Vista Island located in Rabil.  Its style is a mixture of Portuguese origin and Moorish architectural elements and has peach-rose stone bricks with two arches, entrance and exit doors and a yellow exterior where the airport name is and in the south are three melon colored exteriors with two fudge-brown exteriors in between and are bordered with a stone-brick outer wall.

===In parts of the island of Fogo===
[[File:Chã das Caldeiras-Maison traditionnelle (1).jpg|thumb|left|300px|One notable example was a hut (known as [[funco]]) in Chã das Caldeiras featuring traditional architecture, its bricks were made out of lava]]One of the unique architecture on Fogo was [[Chã das Caldeiras]] which has building material made out of lava, most of the buildings were built after independence especially the southwest part which were rebuilt after the 1995 eruption.  Its architecture is not only of Portuguese origin but contain elements of mainland African styles such as old traditional huts and a circular plan as those in mainland African villages and towns and had only one story.  It had straw roofs, bricks mainly black made out of lava, straw windowpanes and doors  In other parts of Cape Verde, only a very few village have hut style buildings.  Huts covered a quarter of the village.  One of the most notable were a house with blue exterior walls with white facades, brown windowpane and door and on the bottom triangular bricks, painted houses did not dominate the majority of the village, another was a hut that housed the vineyard offices, The other was the Catholic church of Portela which had a circular roof, two rims and green doors.  Some of the houses were rectangular with windows and some narrow doors and detached roofs, some buildings also had a flat roof.  One other examples were the village's primary school which had stucco walls, white roofs and mostly white doors and some brown, nearby had a playground with its benches built out of lava, the other was Vinho do Fogo, where wine is manufactured, a small bungalow was in the middle with two small flat windows on each side, black-grey bricks made out of lava, wide doors  and on the right is a part of the building, the others are outside but sheltered and a near rectangular café with sky blue exterior walls, windows and three narrow doors.

Almost the whole of the village were destroyed by lava flows of the 2014-15 eruption between November and February, several survive with minimal or moderate damages, a few were unharmed.

In early 2016, newer buildings and huts were built and out of lava and some new inhabitants moved in.

The rare architectural style's project was awarded the National Architecture Award in 2013, as Best Project of the Year and was awarded the Archdaily Building of the Year International Award in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fernandoguerra.exposure.co/cabo-verde|title=Fernando Guerra - Cabo Verde on Exposure|website=Fernandoguerra.exposure.co|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere on Fogo, some of the buildings built out of lava have good architecture and some of these are in the east of São Filipe.

'''Art Fund''' (formerly the '''National Art Collections Fund''') is an independent membership-based British [[charitable organization|charity]], which raises funds to aid the acquisition of artworks for the nation. It gives grants and acts as a channel for many gifts and bequests, as well as lobbying on behalf of museums and galleries and their users. It relies on members' subscriptions and public donations for funds and does not receive funding from the government or the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]].

Since its foundation in 1903 Art Fund has been involved in the acquisition of over 860,000 works of art of every kind, including many of the most famous objects in British public collections, such as [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]]'s ''[[Rokeby Venus]]'' in the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]]'s ''[[The Weeping Woman|Weeping Woman]]'' in the [[Tate]] collection, the [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[Staffordshire Hoard]] in [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]] and the medieval [[Canterbury Astrolabe Quadrant]] in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2474799/Unique-medieval-astrolabe-saved-by-the-British-Museum.html|title=Unique medieval astrolabe saved by the British Museum|first=Stephen Adams, Arts|last=Correspondent|date=30 July 2008|publisher=|accessdate=6 September 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:RokebyVenus.jpg|thumb|Art Fund assisted with the purchase of [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]]'s ''[[Rokeby Venus]]''.]]
The original idea for an arts charity can be traced to a lecture given by [[John Ruskin]] in 1857 when he called for the establishment of a "great society" to save works of art for public collections and "watch over" them.

Art Fund, then named National Art Collections Fund, was founded in 1903 in order to help museums and galleries acquire works of art. The founders, who included [[Christiana Herringham]], [[Dugald Sutherland MacColl|DS MacColl]] and [[Roger Fry]], were prompted by what they saw as the inadequacy of government funding of museums.

Art critic [[Frank Rutter]] said it made him "boil with rage" that the Fund had spent thousands of pounds on Old Master paintings, some of which he considered of dubious merit or condition, but "would not contribute one half penny" to his appeal in 1905 to buy the first [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] painting for the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], although it welcomed the prestige of presenting the painting, [[Eugène Boudin]]'s ''The Entrance to Trouville Harbour'', the following year.&lt;ref name=ruttertime118&gt;Rutter, Frank. ''Art in My Time'', p.118–119, [[Rich &amp; Cowan]], London, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; He said "the Fund's inertia and snobbish ineptitude are entirely characteristic of the art-officialdom in England."&lt;ref name=ruttertime118/&gt;

In 2005 Art Fund was caught up in the controversy surrounding the purchase by the [[Tate]] gallery of ''[[Tate's purchase of The Upper Room|The Upper Room]]'' by [[Chris Ofili]].&lt;ref name=rules&gt;Hastings, Chris. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/12/18/ntate18.xml "Tate Broke Own Rules on Ofili Buy"], ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'', 18 December 2005. Retrieved 10 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2006 the name was changed from the National Art Collections to The Art Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=113470|title=Term details|website=British Museum|accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year it was caught out when it was discovered that the ''[[Amarna Princess]]'', purportedly an ancient Egyptian sculpture, was actually a forgery by [[Shaun Greenhalgh]].

==Fundraising campaigns==
In addition to using its own funds to help museums and galleries acquire art, Art Fund organises national fundraising campaigns to secure significant works of art that are in danger of being lost from public view.

In 2009 Art Fund led a fundraising campaign to save the [[Staffordshire Hoard]], a collection of over 3,500 gold and silver artefacts discovered in [[Staffordshire]]. Over £900,000 was raised through public donations, and the campaign received substantial funds from trusts and foundations. As a result of the campaign, the £3.3 million treasure was acquired for [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]] and the [[Potteries Museum &amp; Art Gallery]], [[Stoke-on-Trent]].

In 2010 ''The Procession to Calvary'' by [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]], which had been hung in [[Wakefield]]'s [[Nostell Priory]] for over 200 years, came under risk of being sold on the open market. Art Fund worked with the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] to raise the £2.7 million required to purchase the painting for the National Trust's art collection.

In 2013 [[King and McGaw]] partnered with Art Everywhere, a charitable project putting on the world's largest art exhibition. This filled 22,000 billboards across the UK with art prints with all the profits going to the Art Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonlovesbusiness.com/lifestyle/london-art/from-picasso-to-kate-moss-how-easyart-is-filling-22000-billboards-with-british-art/6097.article|title=From Picasso to Kate Moss, how EasyArt is filling 22,000 billboards with British art - London Business News - London News - Londonlovesbusiness.com|date=9 August 2013|publisher=|accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year the campaign was expanded to 30,000 billboards displaying 25 artworks including the ''Study of Cirrus Clouds'' by [[John Constable]], ''The Circle of Lustful'' by [[William Blake]] and [[A Lady with a Squirrel and a Starling]] by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/billboard-campaign-drives-interest-in-classic-paintings-9713858.html|title=Billboard campaign drives interest in classic paintings|publisher=|accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artist Rooms==

In 2008 Art Fund helped Tate and the National Galleries of Scotland acquire ARTIST ROOMS, a collection of postwar and contemporary art. Since then Art Fund has supported a tour of the collection around the UK, as well as providing additional funds to help museum display the works. By the beginning of 2011 ARTIST ROOMS tours had been seen by approximately 12 million people across Britain.

'''Bhayānaka''' (Sanskrit: भयानक, Bhayānaka)  is one of the nine [[Indian aesthetics|rasas]], usually translated as fear. Rasa means "flavour", and the theory of rasa is the primary concept behind classical [[Indian art]]s, including [[theatre]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[poetry]], and even [[sculpture]].

[[Image:Gundestrup E.jpg|thumb|440px|Three carnyx players are depicted at right on plate E of the [[Gundestrup cauldron]].]]

The '''carnyx''' was a [[wind instrument]] of the [[Iron Age]] [[Celt]]s, used between c. 200 BC and c. AD 200. It was a type of [[bronze]] [[trumpet]] with an elongated S shape, held so that the long straight central portion was vertical and the short mouthpiece end section and the much wider bell were horizontal in opposed directions. The bell was styled in the shape of an open-mouthed [[boar]]'s, or other animal's, head. 

It was used in warfare, probably to incite troops to battle and intimidate opponents, as [[Polybius]] recounts. The instrument's significant height allowed it to be heard over the heads of the participants in battles or ceremonies.

==Etymology==
The word “carnyx” is derived from the [[Gaulish]] root, "carn-" or "cern-" meaning "antler" or "horn," and the same root of the name of the god, [[Cernunnos]].&lt;ref&gt;Delmarre, 1987, pp.&amp;nbsp;106–107&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical record==
[[File:CarnyxDeTintignac3.jpg|thumb|left|The serpent head from [[Tintignac]]]]



===Archaeology===
Until 2004, fragments of only five carnyces had been preserved, from modern Scotland, France, Germany, Romania and Switzerland, but in 2004 archaeologists discovered a first-century-BC deposit at [[Tintignac]] in [[Corrèze]], France.

In September 2004, over 500 fragments of iron and bronze objects were discovered in a Gallic pit. The objects included a dozen swords and scabbards, iron spearheads, a shield, ten bronze helmets and an iron bird, 2 animal heads, one animal body, a cauldron, and seven Carnyces, one of which is almost complete. These unique military and religious objects are currently being studied by Christophe Maniquet’s team, and are in the process of conservation and restoration by the ''Materia Viva'' laboratory in Toulouse.

Four of the carnyces had boar's heads, the fifth appears to be a serpent-like monster; they appear to represent a ritual deposit dating to soon after the [[Roman conquest of Gaul]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expatica.com/fr/news/local_news/france-trumpets-discovery-of-gallic-war-trophies-14434.html Press report]&lt;/ref&gt; The Tintignac finds enabled some fragments found in northern Italy decades before to be identified in 2012 as coming from a carnyx.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2012/11/15/Ancient-Celtic-war-horn-found-in-Italy/UPI-43251353006605/ UPI.com] Carnyx identified in Italy&lt;/ref&gt;

The only example from the British Isles is the Deskford Carnyx, found at the farm of Leitchestown, [[Deskford]], [[Banffshire]], Scotland in 1816. Only the boar's head bell survives, also apparently placed as a ritual deposit.  It was donated to Banff Museum, and is now on loan from Aberdeenshire Museums Service to the [[Museum of Scotland]]. The location and age of the Deskford Carnyx suggests the instrument had a peaceful, ceremonial use and was not only used in warfare. 

Before 2004 this was the best surviving example, and generally copied in earlier reconstructions.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter&lt;/ref&gt; The Deskford find was made almost entirely of brass, a metal used almost exclusively by the Romans, and strictly controlled by them. Further, the basic size and shape of the Deskford find suggests it may in fact have been a Roman military draco standard.

===Depiction in sculpture===
The instrument is known from depictions on coins and [[relief]]s, notably from [[Trajan's Column]] and the so-called initiation scene of the [[Gundestrup cauldron]].

===Literature===
The name is known from textual sources, carnyces are reported from the Celtic attack on the [[Delphi]] in 279 BC, as well as from [[Julius Caesar]]'s campaign in [[Gaul]] and [[Claudius]]' invasion of [[British Iron Age|Britain]]. [[Diodorus Siculus]] around 60-30 BC said (Histories, 5.30):
:''"Their trumpets again are of a peculiar barbarian kind; they blow into them and produce a harsh sound which suits the tumult of war''"
&lt;!-- Polybius describes the terror of the Romans at the onslaught of the Celts at the battle of Telamon. needs cite and actual quote --&gt;

===Objects from Tintignac===
Objects found at [[Tintignac]] were exhibited at the 2012 exhibition "Les Gaulois, une expo renversante" (''The Gauls, a stunning exhibition'').

The reconstruction of the Deskford Carnyx was initiated by Dr. [[John Purser]], and commenced in 1991 funded jointly by the Glenfiddich Living Scotland award and the National Museums of Scotland.  In addition to John Purser as musicologist, the team comprised the archaeologist Fraser Hunter, silversmith John Creed, and trombonist [[John Kenny (trombonist)|John Kenny]].  After 2,000 years of silence the reconstructed Deskford Carnyx was unveiled at the National Museum of Scotland in April 1993.

In 1993 Kenny became the first person to play the carnyx in 2,000 years, and has since lectured and performed on the instrument internationally, in the concert hall, on radio, television, and film. There are numerous compositions for the carnyx and it is featured on seven CDs. On March 15, 2003 he performed solo to an audience of 65,000 in the [[Stade De France]] in Paris.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

On 15 June 2017 "The Music of the Forest", a specially commissioned work by Lakeland composer, Christopher Gibbs, featuring a reconstructed carnyx, received its world premiere at [[Slaidburn]] Village Hall. The four-part song cycle evoked the landscape and history of the [[Forest of Bowland]] and was performed by the Renaissance Singers of [[Blackburn Cathedral]] under the direction of Samuel Hudson. The carnyx was played by John Kenny.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lancashire.gov.uk/news/details.aspx?Id=PR17/0137]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7889">'''Catalan Gothic''' is an [[artistic style]], with particular characteristics in the field of [[architecture]]. It occurred under the [[Crown of Aragon]] between the 13th and 15th centuries, which places it at the end of the European Gothic period and at the beginning of the [[Renaissance]]. The term "Catalan Gothic" is confined to [[Barcelona]] and its area of influence ([[Girona]], [[Northern Catalonia]], [[Balearic Islands]], etc.), which has its own characteristics.

Despite its name, Catalan Gothic differs from the [[Gothic Art|Gothics]] from other parts of Europe. In architecture, it does not seek excessive height, or have highlights in its flying buttresses, and its decoration is sober.

== Historical context ==
[[File:Pedralbes1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Side facade of the church of the monastery of Pedralbes.]]

The style began because of the wealth generated by the expansion of the Counts of Barcelona and Crown of Aragon, first to the [[Languedoc]] and [[Balearic islands]] then across the [[Mediterranean]] to [[Sicily]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and the [[Duchy of Athens]]. This resulted in a demand for an updating of existing [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] buildings and new public buildings as well as a demand for mansions for the newly enriched. The style reached its climax in the 15th century. After the unification of  the Crowns of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and Aragon, and the discovery of the [[Americas]], [[Seville]] became Spain's major port, to the detriment of Barcelona.

== Artistic context ==
The terms "Gothic style" and "Gothic city" are used in relation to the local time frame. It is not to be confused with Spanish or other Gothic styles, though the latest available technologies were always employed. There are many differences in, for example, the arch, [[rose window]] and struts. 

In church architecture Catalan Gothic does not strive for great heights, but tends to balance dimensions of width with height, so there are no long sloping roofs so characteristic of central and northern Europe, and its buttresses are as tall as the naves. Buildings also have fewer windows because the Mediterranean light is much stronger than the rest of Europe. Sparsely decorated, they have no figurative motifs on their pillars and no notable intricacy in their vaults.

The main features of Catalan Gothic, compared with the international Gothic, are:

In [[sculpture]] and [[painting]] the peculiarities of Catalan Gothic are not as marked and as distinctive as either the Italian or Flemish styles. Nevertheless, there are several notable painters, including [[Ferrer Bassa]], [[Pere Serra]], [[Lluís Borrassà]], [[Bernat Martorell]], [[Lluís Dalmau]] and [[Jaume Huguet]].&lt;ref name="mnac"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cornudella|first1=Rafael|last2=Fava|first2=Cesar|last3=Macias|first3=Guadaira|title=Gothic art in the MNAC collections|year=2011|publisher=Museu National d'Art de Catalunya|isbn=978-84-8043-242-9|pages=85–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Typology ==

=== Church ===
Religious architecture tends to unify space, which is achieved through two methods: either with slender and thin columns spaced far enough apart to avoid interruption the view of the side ailes, which are often the same height as the nave, or constructing with a single nave of much wider  [[Span (architecture)|span]]. The towers, usually one or two, stand out as smooth polygonal prisms (6 sides, 8 sides), and there are no [[transept]]s, though churches based on the [[Templar]] design, are planned as Greek crosses.

The abutments have two effects in addition to their role in bracing the walls. On the [[Architectural drawing|drawing]] the chapels can be distinguished, and the elevation of the building is continuous and visually smooth on the outside. When these appear on the main facade (usually the West Front), they create a rectangle that frames the doorway and perhaps a rose window.

=== Palace ===
[[File:Palau Requesens.jpg|thumb|250px|View of a typical courtyard with stairs in the palace Requesens, located in the [[Gothic Quarter, Barcelona|Gothic Quarter]] of Barcelona.]]

The palace, with a larger street wall than other dwellings, is typical of 15th-century bourgeois spaces, the best examples of which are in the Carrer de Montcada in Barcelona's Ribera district. The building is accessed through a portal and is characterised by a courtyard, which is the centre of the building and contains the main staircase that is either open or half closed.

On the ground floor are the facilities for doing business and there may be an office on a mezzanine. The first floor is reserved for living, with main hall, richly decorated stretching along the facade, sometimes occupying it entirely. The following storey contains service rooms and secondary units. Some palaces have small towers for watching over the city rooftops.

=== Llotja ===
During the 15th century the Catalan Gothic was used in civil architecture, best exemplified in the [[Llotja of Barcelona]], built between 1380 and 1392. It consisted of three naves separated by ogival arches resting on columns with beaded and flat roofs built in wood. Many features of the Barcelona Llotja was replaced in the 18th century by a neoclassical style.

== Examples ==
Examples of this type of architecture are the [[Cathedral of Barcelona]], begun in 1298 or the [[Girona Cathedral|Cathedral of Girona]], started in 1312, which has three naves leading to the crossing where it continues as a single width. Its technical difficulties had to be addressed by a board or architects sent by the [[Crown of Aragon]].
Other good examples are:
* [[Santa Maria del Mar, Barcelona|Santa Maria del Mar]], in [[Barcelona]].
* [[Palau Reial Major]], in [[Barcelona]].
* [[Monastery of Pedralbes]], in [[Barcelona]].

A '''commercial director''' is a [[film director]] who specializes in the creation of [[commercials]], often for television, but sometimes also on film and of  [[music video]]s (given that music videos are recognized as a form of advertising for the song featured in the video{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}).

The term is also used for the more general business role of [[chief commercial officer]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4640">The term '''Context art''' ({{lang-de|Kontext Kunst}}) was introduced through the seminal exhibition and an accompanying publication ''Kontext Kunst. The Art of the 90s''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neuegalerie-archiv.at/93/kunst/cover.html Neue Galerie im Künstlerhaus Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; curated by [[Peter Weibel]] at the Neue Galerie im Künstlerhaus Graz (Austria) in 1993 (02.10.–07.11.1993).

== Exhibition and publication ==

Both exhibition and publication aimed to establish grounds for recognizing a new form of artistic practice emerging in the early 1990s. The presentation displayed different approaches though all shared an interest in the use of methods of contextualization to reveal connections between the art works and their conditions of production, whether these were formal, social, or ideologically defined. Institutional critique, feminist positions, later also critiques of precarious economic conditions and issues of globalization, all closely related to social and political changes, became relevant subjects of artistic production.

“It is no longer purely about critiquing the art system, but about critiquing reality and analyzing and creating social processes. In the ’90s, non-art contexts are being increasingly drawn into the art discourse. Artists are becoming autonomous agents of social processes, partisans of the real. The interaction between artists and social situations, between art and non-art contexts has led to a new art form, where both are folded together: Context art. The aim of this social construction of art is to take part in the social construction of reality.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shiftyparadigms.org/false_economies.htm Peter Weibel, Kontextkunst – Kunst der 90er Jahre (Köln: DuMont Verlag, 1994), p. 57, translated by Barnaby Drabble / resource: Rebecca Gordon Nesbitt, ''False Economies: Time to Take Stock'' ]&lt;/ref&gt;  

It might be due to the fact that the term was introduced under the German translation ''[[KontextKunst]]'' instead of ''Context Art'' or its likewise politically tended orientation (see Maria Lind’s reference&lt;ref&gt;[http://eipcp.net/transversal/1204/lind/en/#_ftn16 Actualisation of Space: The Case of Oda Projesi]''Kontextkunst'' is, if you wish a German parallel to the so-called 'relational aesthetics' but more programmatically political and academic. Both imply a more dynamic notion of art, which actively takes the context into consideration and which often goes beyond the exhibition space. Some of the artists used as 'good' examples by Christian Kravagna have been associated with Kontextkunst. See Peter Weibel: ''Kontextkunst – Kunst der 90er Jahre'', Cologne, DuMont Verlag 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;), but it never spread far beyond Europe’s language based barriers. Instead vaguely similar strategies were labeled as ''Models of Participatory Practice''&lt;ref&gt;[http://republicart.net/disc/aap/kravagna01_en.htm Working on the Community Models of Participatory Practice]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1998 by Christian Kravagna’s attempt to define the field or the later appearing and quite moderate [[Relational Art]] based on the 2002 book ''[[Relational Aesthetics]]'' by [[Nicolas Bourriaud]].  

The accompanying catalog is described to document ”a wide-ranging exhibition designed to illustrate the emergence over the past decade of a new international art movement, .. “ featuring “… an anthology of 22 substantial essays (some reprinted) discussing from diverse perspectives the artistic issues and social and political themes that distinguish ''Context Art'' from related forms of conceptual and installation art…. “.

The '''''Coronation of the Virgin''''' (in Italian ''Incoronazione Maringhi'') is a painting of the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] by the Italian Renaissance master [[Filippo Lippi]], in the [[Uffizi]], Florence.

==History==

Francesco Maringhi, ''procuratore'' of the church of [[Sant'Ambrogio, Florence|Sant'Ambrogio]], left money after his death in 1441 for a new painting at the high altar of the church. Bills of the payments for the work until 1447 have been preserved.

In the late 1430s, brother Filippo Lippi had left the convent of the [[Church of the Carmine, Florence|Carmine convent]] to open an artist workshop of his own; however, having no money enough to pay assistants and apprentices, he worked alone with two usual collaborators,  Fra' Carnevale and Fra' Diamante, along with an unknown "Piero di Lorenzo dipintore". For the ''Coronation of the Virgin'', however, Lippi had to call in a total of six external painters, who were responsible also for the gilded frame, now lost. Originally the work had a [[predella]], also lost, with the exception of a small panel with a ''Miracle of St. Ambrose'', now in the [[Berlin State Museums]].

The work was immediately admired and was copied by numerous painters. It remained in Sant'Ambrogio until 1810, when it was stolen. Later it was sold to the [[Galleria dell'Accademia]], from which it was transferred to the [[Galleria degli Uffizi]] in Florence.

==Description==
The work is composed of a single panel, divided into three sectors by the arches. At the sides of the central arch are two ''[[Tondo (art)|tondos]]'', depicting the Angel of Annunciation and the Virgin.

The main scene features a crowd of biblical figures, angels and saints,
portrayed in informal positions; most of them are probably portraits of existing people. As usual, the scene is set in Heaven, but Lippi decided to avoid the outdated gilded background, replacing it with a striped sky which alludes to the seven sectors of the Paradise. In the middle, in a commanding position, are Christ and the kneeling Madonna who is going to be crowned, within a majestic marble throne in perspective. The latter includes the shell-shaped niche, featured in other paintings by Lippi.

Four angels hold a gilded ribbon, while in the lower level is a series of kneeling saints; on the left and right are other two groups of saints and angels, inspired to the crowded choirs of older works, such as the ''Incoronation of the Virgin'' by [[Lorenzo Monaco]]. The elevated pavement of the side groups creates a perspective triangle whose apex is the Virgin's head.

Amongst the figures in the middle can be recognized Mary Magdalene and St. Eustace (titular of one of the most important altars in the church) with his sons and his wife. These figures, all without a halo, are shorter than normal, as the painter imagined them to be correctly seen from below, in perspective, by the nuns of the Sant'Ambrogio convent from their separated choirs.

Kneeling at the side are the work's commissioner, facing a cartouche with the write ''ISTE PERFECIT OPUS'' ("this one finished the work"), while on the left is a self-portrait of Filippo Lippi in the robes of a [[Carmelite monk]] (as he was). Standing on the sides are the two titular saints of the church: St. Ambrose (left) and St. John the Baptist (right), whose austere representation reveal the influence of [[Masaccio]].

This painting is described at length in lines 344-389 of [[Robert Browning|Robert Browning's]] poem '[[Fra Lippo Lippi (poem)|Fra Lippo Lippi]]', published in 1855 in his collection ''[[Men and Women (poetry collection)|Men and Women]]''.

'''''Ethical Intuitionism''''' is a 2005 [[book]] (hardcover release: 2005, paperback release: 2008) by [[University of Colorado]] [[philosophy]] professor [[Michael Huemer]] defending [[ethical intuitionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Ethical Intuitionism|last = Huemer|first = Michael|isbn = 978-0230573741|publisher = [[Palgrave Macmillan]]|authorlink = Michael Huemer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spot.colorado.edu/~huemer/book2.htm|title = Ethical Intuitionism|last = Huemer|first = Michael|accessdate = 2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book expands on Huemer's early writing defending [[moral realism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.sprynet.com/~owl1/objectiv.htm|title = Moral Objectivism|date = 1992|accessdate = November 28, 2013|last = Huemer|first = Michael|authorlink = Michael Huemer}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Reception==

===Reviews in academic publications===

The book was reviewed by [[David McNaughton]] of [[Florida State University]] on ''[[Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews]].''&lt;ref name=ndr-ei&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/25112-ethical-intuitionism/|title = Ethical Intuitionism (book review)|last = McNaughton|first = David|date = September 10, 2006|accessdate = November 28, 2013|publisher = ''[[Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review was generally positive, and concluded thus: "This book has many merits. It is generally clear, well-argued, timely, and thought-provoking. Not the least of its merits, however, is that it contains a large element of truth. Huemer is understandably frustrated that so many people still misrepresent intuitionism and fail to take it seriously. But it is making a return, and currently has more proponents than he sometimes seems to suggest. His book should help create some more." However, McNaughton's review was critical of Huemer's [[phenomenal conservatism]] and suggested that [[doxastic|doxastic conservatism]] would have been more convincing.

[[Mark Schroeder (philosopher)|Mark Schroeder]] of the [[University of Southern California]] reviewed the book in ''[[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]]''.&lt;ref name=ppr-ei&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~maschroe/research/Schroeder_on_Huemer.pdf|title = Huemer's Clarkeanism|date = January 2009|accessdate = November 28, 2013|last = Schroeder|first = Mark|publisher = ''[[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schroder defended his metaethical perspective, [[reductive realism]], against Huemer's criticisms, noting that one could be a realist while rejecting the dualist metaphysics that underpinned Huemer's analysis.

The book was also reviewed by [[Noah Lemos]] in ''Mind'', a journal published by [[Oxford University Press]], in April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mind.oxfordjournals.org/content/117/466/483.extract|title = Review: Michael Huemer: Ethical Intuitionism|date = April 2008|accessdate = November 28, 2013|publisher = ''Mind'', [[Oxford University Press]], 117 (466):483-486}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/NLERMH|title = Review: Michael Huemer: Ethical Intuitionism|date = April 2008|publisher = philpapers.org article information|accessdate = November 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Flaying of Marsyas''''' is a painting by the Italian late Renaissance artist [[Titian]], probably painted between about 1570 and his death in 1576, when in his eighties. It is now in the Archbishop's Palace in [[Kroměříž]], [[Czech Republic]] and belongs to the Archbishopric of Olomouc (administered by Olomouc Museum of Art – Archdiocesan Museum). It is one of Titian's last works, and may be unfinished, although there is a partial signature on the stone in the foreground.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, 231; only "... NUS P" remains, presumably from "TITIANUS P[inxit]" – "Titian painted this".&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting shows the killing by [[flaying]] or skinning alive of [[Marsyas]], a [[satyr]] who rashly challenged the god [[Apollo]] to a musical contest.  It is one of several canvases with mythological subjects from [[Ovid]] which Titian executed in his late years, mostly the ''poesie'' series for King [[Philip II of Spain]], of which this painting seems not to have been part. 

The painting has been in Kroměříž in [[Moravia]] since 1673, and was rather forgotten about, being off the beaten track as far as Venetian painting is concerned.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 717-718&lt;/ref&gt;  It  "did not enter critical literature until 1909".&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, 231&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1930s it was "widely accepted as an important late work" among scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, 231&lt;/ref&gt; but little known by a wider public.  

On its first modern appearance abroad, it "was greeted with astonished admiration" as the "star attraction" of a major exhibition at the [[Royal Academy]] in London in 1983,&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 718 quoted 1st; Rosand (2010), 19 quoted 2nd; Robertson is the catalogue entry&lt;/ref&gt; It was new to most viewers and was described by [[John Russell (art critic)|John Russell]] in the ''[[New York Times]]'' as "the most astonishing picture in the show".&lt;ref&gt;John Russell, [https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/17/arts/art-venetians-of-1500-s-at-british-royal-academy.html ART: VENETIANS OF 1500'S AT BRITISH ROYAL ACADEMY], 17 December, 1983; Rosand, 1985, 295–297&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning an extended analysis, Sir [[Lawrence Gowing]] wrote that "All these months – it is not too much to say – London has been half under the spell of this masterpiece, in which the tragic sense that overtook Titian’s poesie in his seventies reached its cruel and solemn extreme. At most hours on most days there is a knot of visitors riveted and fairly perplexed in front of it. ... At the Academy people still ask, and on the radio well-meaning critics debate, how it is possible that a horribly painful subject should be the occasion of beauty or greatness in art."&lt;ref&gt;Gowing&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and subject==
[[File:Giulio Romano - Flaying of Marsyas - WGA09622.jpg|thumb|360px|Drawing by [[Giulio Romano]], [[Louvre]], for a [[fresco]] in [[Mantua]].]]
The choice of such a violent scene was perhaps inspired by the death of [[Marcantonio Bragadin]], the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] commander of [[Famagusta]] in [[Cyprus]] who was flayed by the [[Ottomans]] when the city fell in August 1571, causing enormous outrage in Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 715; Sohm, 97; Richard&lt;/ref&gt;  Titian's composition is undoubtedly derived from that of [[Giulio Romano]] from several decades before (see "Visual sources" below).&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, 231&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Both artists follow the account in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' (Book 6, lines 382–400),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Text/OvidMetamorphoses6.html www.theoi.com Text of Ovid ''Metamorphoses'' Book 6 in English]&lt;/ref&gt;, which covers the contest very quickly, but describes the flaying scene at relative length, though with few indications that would help to visualize it.&lt;ref&gt;Gowing; Richard&lt;/ref&gt; Marsyas cries out "Why do you tear me from myself?".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted, Hale, 712-713; Wind, 172, Ovid's line 385&lt;/ref&gt;  

Marsyas was a skillful player of the classical [[aulos]] or double flute, for which by Titian's time [[pan pipes]] were  usually substituted in art,&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 305 for a range of other instruments he was given, but all of them from the wind section.  The contest with Pan is also covered in ''Metamorphoses'' (XI, 146-93)&lt;/ref&gt; and his set hangs from the tree over his head. Apollo played his usual [[lyre]], which is here represented by a modern [[lira da braccio]], an ancestor of the [[violin]] with up to seven strings.  This is played by a figure of uncertain identity, who some scholars have said to be Apollo himself, perhaps appearing a second time, since Apollo is clearly the figure wearing a [[Laurus nobilis|laurel]] wreath who is kneeling down and using his knife to flay Marsyas' chest.&lt;ref&gt;Held, 187; Hale, 714; Robertson, 231–232; Gowing&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been suggested that the musician is [[Orpheus]], or Olympus, a devoted pupil of Marsyas, who Apollo later converts to playing the lyre, and Ovid mentions.&lt;ref&gt;Rosand (2010), 22; Sohm, 96; Gowing&lt;/ref&gt;  The mythical King [[Midas]], the seated old man on the right, is often thought to be a self-portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Held, 187; Robertson, 231; Sohm, 97; Glover&lt;/ref&gt;  His downward line of gaze at Marsyas is parallel to that of the musician looking up to the heavens on the other side of the painting.  

Ovid avoids the question of who the judges of the contest were. In most Greek accounts the Three [[Muse]]s did the role, but the story early became confused with another, the "Judgement of Midas", which has happened here.  This was another musical contest, always with lyre versus pan pipes, but with [[Pan (god)|Pan]] himself on the pipes.  Of course Apollo won, but in some accounts King [[Midas]] preferred Pan, and was given the ears of a [[donkey]] as punishment, while Pan was merely humiliated.  The seated figure at right wears a [[diadem]] and is Midas, though his ears seem unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 303–305; Hall, 27–28; Robertson, 232; Hale, 713.  Whether Midas was actually supposed to be the judge, or just a spectator, varies between accounts.&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Judgement of Midas" was also sometimes painted.  Both stories were set in [[Phrygia]], in modern [[Turkey]], where Midas ruled, which in the ancient world had various associations with music.  The Phrygians were not Greek, until [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] after [[Alexander the Great]], but lived on the edge of the Greek world.  The human with the knife wears a [[Phrygian cap]]. 
[[File:Titian - The Flaying of Marsyas (cropped) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The head of Marsyas, inverted]]

Apollo is assisted by a sinister "Scythian" figure on the left, working on Marsyas' leg, and a satyr with a bucket behind Midas, perhaps to collect blood, or hold the removed skin, which in some versions of the story Apollo later had nailed up in a temple.  A small boy, or boy satyr,&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 714; What little can be seen of his legs seems to be furry, and he is described as a ''satirino'' by several authors&lt;/ref&gt; restrains a large dog at right, while a much smaller dog is lapping at the blood that has fallen to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Gowing&lt;/ref&gt;  As was typical in Titian's day, and especially in his works, the satyr is shown with the legs and feet of a goat, and inverting him emphasizes these, as well as giving him the position typical of mid-sized animals being slaughtered or skinned before butchering.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 303–304; Hale, 713&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of his body still seems unflayed, but Apollo holds a large flap of detached skin in the hand not holding his knife.  

Compositionally, the "V" shape made by Marsyas's legs is echoed by the highlighted "V"s of the bent arms of the four figures nearest to him, all of whom are looking at him.  Indeed, his navel is almost exactly at the centre of the canvas as it now is.&lt;ref&gt;[https://paintersonpaintings.com/john-dubrow-on-titian/ "John Dubrow on Titian"] in ''Painters on Paintings; ''Rosand (2010), 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Technical examinations have determined that two of the main differences to the Giulio Romano composition are changes made well after painting was underway; originally the musician merely held his instrument, as in the Giulio Romano composition, and the boy or small satyr and the large dog were not present.&lt;ref&gt;Held, 187&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==
[[File:Titian - The Flaying of Marsyas (cropped to midas).jpg|thumb|Detail with Midas]]
Many writers have attempted to capture the meaning of the "famously savage" painting,&lt;ref&gt;Royal, 222&lt;/ref&gt; which, despite "the brutality of the treatment",&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, 232&lt;/ref&gt; has been found powerfully compelling by many, and described as "the most discussed, revered and loathed of all Titian's paintings".&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 718&lt;/ref&gt;  One common suggestion has been that the painting reflects ideas in [[Renaissance Neoplatonism]] about the "liberation of the spirit from the body",&lt;ref&gt;Held, 187–189; Sohm, 97 quoted; Rosand (2010), 40&lt;/ref&gt; or the acquisition of higher insight or clarity.&lt;ref&gt;Wind, 171–173, on other 16th-century depictions&lt;/ref&gt;  Such ideas are usually considered to be involved in another famous treatment of flaying: the flayed skin carrying a self-portrait face of [[Michelangelo]], held by [[Saint Bartholomew]] as his attribute in ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]'' in the [[Sistine Chapel]].  One of Michelangelo's poems had used the metaphor of a snake shedding its old skin for his hope for a new life after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Sistine, 206; Wind, 187–188; Hale, 713-714&lt;/ref&gt;

In this spirit, [[Dante]] began his ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]'' with a prayer addressed to Apollo, who he asks to "Enter my breast, and so infuse me your spirit as you did Marsyas when you tore him from the cover of his limbs.&lt;ref&gt;Wind, 173–174, quoting ''Paradiso'' I, 13–21; Hale, 713&lt;/ref&gt;  In some other Renaissance depictions, Marsyas's furry legs appear human when flayed, so he "is redeemed from the animality that condemned him to this terrible fate".&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 305&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher-turned-novelist [[Iris Murdoch]] was especially fascinated by the painting, which she described in an interview as "the greatest in the Western canon".  It is mentioned in three of her novels, and sometimes discussed by the characters. In her portrait for the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] by [[Tom Phillips (artist)|Tom Phillips]], a reproduction occupies most of the wall behind her head.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tomphillips.co.uk/images/stories/portraits/murdoch_1.jpg the painting]&lt;/ref&gt;  She said it was "something to do with human life and all its ambiguities and all its horrors and terrors and misery, and at the same time there’s something beautiful, the picture is beautiful, and something also to do with the entry of the spiritual into the human situation and the closeness of the gods ..."&lt;ref&gt;Paris Review.  The novels are ''[[A Fairly Honourable Defeat]]'' (1970), ''[[The Black Prince (novel)|The Black Prince]]'' (1973), and her last, ''[[Jackson's Dilemma]]'' (1995); Hale, 718&lt;/ref&gt;

The general interpretation of the story of Marsyas was as an illustration of the inevitable disaster that followed ''[[hubris]]'' in the form of a challenge to a god. An idea of the contest reinforcing the general moral and artistic superiority of the courtly lyre, or modern stringed instruments, over the rustic and frivolous wind family was present in much ancient discussion, and perhaps retained some relevance in the 16th-century.  Gowing comments: "It was on behalf of order and the laws of harmonious proportion, which sound in the music of strings, that Apollo claimed victory over the chaotic and impulsive sound of the pipes."&lt;ref&gt;Gowing; Rosand (2010), 19–20; Held, 190;  Hale, 713, 715-717&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Edgar Wind]] the contest determined "the relative powers of Dionysian darkness and Apollonian clarity; and if the contest ended with the flaying of Marsyas, it was because flaying was itself a Dionysian rite, a tragic ordeal of purification by which the ugliness of the outward man was thrown off and the beauty of his inward self revealed".&lt;ref&gt;Wind, 172–173&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, there have been suggestions that the painting has a political meaning, either general or specific, and depicts the "just punishment" of hubristic opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Held, 190–191, 193&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'three ages of man' are all represented (if satyrs are allowed to count), indeed on the right they are aligned diagonally.  The boy or young satyr is looking rather vacuously out at the viewer, those in their prime are concentrating on their tasks with a variety of expressions, and Midas contemplates the scene, apparently with melancholy resignation, but making no further attempt to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;Held, 191–192; Sohm, 97–98; Rosand (2010), 22; Matthews&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:The Torment of Marsyas 1, Louvre May 2010.jpg|thumb|Roman version of the Hellenistic figure type, [[Louvre]]]]
It is unknown whether the painting had an intended recipient; Titian's main client in his last years was King [[Philip II of Spain]], but the picture is not mentioned in the surviving correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 711-712&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting may well be one of those still in Titian's studio at his death in 1576.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, 231&lt;/ref&gt;  There are a number of these, including for example ''[[The Death of Actaeon]]'' in the [[National Gallery, London]] (certainly intended for Philip),&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 250–252&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a general argument as to whether they should be regarded as finished or not.  In this case the signature and areas of detailed finish may suggest that the painting had been completed.&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 250–252; Robertson, 231; Jaffé, 25–28, 59, 151–152 (with both points of view expressed by different authors). The painting was in this exhibition, but not in the catalogue; Gowing, and Penny's letter in response below, which may indicate a shifted position; in 1984 Penny emphasizes unfinished aspects, in 2008 those suggesting completion.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Nothing is known of its history before it appears in an inventory of 1655 of the Arundel Collection, by then in exile from the [[English Civil War]] in [[Amsterdam]].  This was formed by [[Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel]] (d. 1646) and his wife [[Alethea Howard, Countess of Arundel|Alethea Howard]], and was mostly dispersed by their son after Alethea's death in 1655.  The collection had mostly been formed in the 1620s, when the Howards went on an extended visit to Italy, and it is presumed that the painting was bought there.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, 233; Rosand (2010), 43 note 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was bought by Franz Imstenraed in 1655.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, 233&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the nephew of (Edvard, Everard or) [[Everhard Jabach]], a banker from [[Cologne]] who was one of the greatest private collectors of the century, and also acted as an agent for [[Cardinal Mazarin]] and [[Louis XIV of France]].  In the 1650s the superb collection of Arundel's friend [[Charles I of England]] was being dispersed in London, and Jabach, acting on behalf of Louis, was one of many international buyers active, with agents on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Brotton, 298–299&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1673 it was acquired by [[Karl II von Liechtenstein-Kastelkorn]], [[Bishop of Olomouc]], after being a prize in a [[lottery]].&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, 233; [http://www.shafe.co.uk/home/art-history/early_stuart_contents/early_stuart_20_-_protectorate/ It seems the lottery was abandoned from lack of sales, and the actual purchase was by a conventional sale].&lt;/ref&gt;  He also bought most of the collection of the brothers Bernhard and Franz Imstenraed, which remains intact in [[Kroměříž Castle]], the former Archbishop's Palace, now the National Museum, in [[Kroměříž]].&lt;ref&gt; Machytka, Lubor, extract from "History of the Archbishop’s Gallery in Olomouc", 13, [http://docplayer.net/6216553-Acta-universitatis-palackianae-olomoucensis-facultas-philosophica-philologica-81-2003.html ACTA UNIVERSITATIS PALACKIANAE OLOMUCENSIS, NEERLANDICA II – 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marsyas, as a single figure, was a well-known subject in Roman and [[Hellenistic sculpture]], with a famous type showing him tied and hanging with his arms above his head.  This probably originated in Hellenistic [[Pergamon]],&lt;ref&gt;It was originally part of a group with the ''[[Arrotino]]'', then known as the ''Scythian'', a figure of a slave sharpening a knife, though the connection between the two was not realized until the 17th century.&lt;/ref&gt; and was well-known from various examples by the late Renaissance, followed for example by [[Raphael]] in a small scene on the ceiling of the [[Stanza della Segnatura]] in the Vatican.  But this is not a very direct influence on Titian's composition.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 27; Bull, 301–303; Gods, 185&lt;/ref&gt;

Much closer is "an awkward sketch for a now damaged [[fresco]]" by [[Giulio Romano]] in the [[Palazzo Te]] in [[Mantua]] (1524–34),&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 714&lt;/ref&gt; for which there is also a drawing in the [[Louvre]]; this is clearly the main source for the composition.  It has all the same figures and elements except the boy and the dogs, in roughly the same positions, including, apparently for the first time in art, Marsyas shown tied upside down.  The standing figure at left is a servant holding a lyre, rather than Titian's lira da bracchio player.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, 231–232; Bull, 303–304; Rosand (2010), 19–20; Royal, 222&lt;/ref&gt;  The seated figure of Midas has donkey ears, and is more clearly distressed, holding his hands over his face, and Apollo, bending down rather than on one knee, is not cutting, but is pulling the skin off like a jacket.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, 304&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrea Schiavone]]'s ''Judgement of Midas'' in the British [[Royal Collection]] (in 2017 displayed in the Gallery at [[Kensington Palace]]), is some twenty years earlier, from c. 1548–50, and is comparable to Titian, in atmosphere and some details of the composition.  Titian "must also have remembered elements of this painting: the pensive and abstracted attitudes of Apollo and Midas, and the radically free impressionistic brushwork used to heighten the dramatic mood of the story."  Apollo also plays a lira da bracchio, and Midas, as yet with normal ears, looks straight at Pan.&lt;ref&gt;Royal, 222, quoted.  Midas's ears are "barely indicated" since later overpaint was removed in the 1990s; [https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/search#/3/collection/402862/the-judgement-of-midas  "Andrea Schiavone (c. 1510–1563), The Judgement of Midas  c. 1548–50"] Royal Collection webpage&lt;/ref&gt;

Midas or "Midas/Titian adopts the traditional melancholic's pose", which Titian would have known from Raphael's supposed portrait of [[Michelangelo]] as [[Heraclitus]] in ''[[The School of Athens]]'', and [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s ''[[Melencolia I]]'', not to mention the Schiavone.&lt;ref&gt;Sohm, 97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique and style==
The technique is characteristic of Titian's late style.  [[Nicholas Penny]] commented that there are "intense greens and blues and reds ([[vermilion]] as well as [[crimson]]) ... after 1560 Titian began to apply these colours in [[Glaze_(painting_technique)#Wall_glazing|scumbles]], often with his fingers, so that they only half belong to any of the forms and seem to float on the surface of the painting: evidently he painted them last. ... one can still see passages of smoky preliminary painting (notably the ghostly body of Apollo) but the blood, dogs' tongues and the ribbons in the trees are brilliant red."&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 251 quoted.  See also Rosand (2010), 23–27, and Sohm, 96–98&lt;/ref&gt;  

Describing a group of late works which he considers finished, including this,&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 252, but see his earlier letter in response to Gowing (below it on webpage) where he takes the opposite tack&lt;/ref&gt; and contrasting them with the ''[[Death of Actaeon]]'', which he considers unfinished, Penny notes "the impact of blurred areas of painting (... indecipherable distances, light piercing foliage) is enhanced by contrast with forms that were more fully modelled, if still often roughly painted, and, indeed, with some that were more detailed (Midas's diadem ...)".&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 252&lt;/ref&gt;  There are strong white highlights on the knife blades, the bucket, and elsewhere, comparable with those in ''[[Tarquin and Lucretia (Titian)|Tarquin and Lucretia]]'', which Titian delivered in 1571.&lt;ref&gt;Rosand (2010), 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the purely technical means, many critics have tried to articulate evocations of Titian's pictorial language in this and other very late paintings.&lt;ref&gt;See Sohm, 97–98 for a further example&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Sydney Joseph Freedberg|Sidney Freedburg]], "the surfaces of bodies make a silvered incanescence and the atmosphere, almost unbreathably dense, is like dulled fire.  ...There is a wry comedy within the cruelty, ugliness and strangeness within the magisterial beauty, and terror accompanies the sense of the sublime."&lt;ref&gt;Freedburg, 516&lt;/ref&gt;  For [[John Steer (art historian)|John Steer]] "it is not individual colours that tell, but an all-over emanation of broken touches, evoking a greenish-gold, that is splattered, appropriately to the theme, with reds like splotches of blood.  Vision and expression are here so much one that they cannot, even for the purposes of discussion, be separated.  .... Titian's intense struggle to grasp in paint, through tone and colour, the physical realities of the scene is a fundamental part of their meaning."&lt;ref&gt;Steer in Jaffé, 43.

'''''Fragments of a Cope with the Seven Sacraments''''' refers to a 15th-century [[cope]] in the collection of the [[Historical Museum of Bern]]. It is part of the [[church treasure]] from the [[Lausanne Cathedral | Cathedral of Lausanne]] sent to [[Bern]] after the Protestant conquest of [[Canton Vaud]] in 1536. The cope can be attributed to a master from the Netherlands in the circle of [[Rogier van der Weyden]] and was probably executed in [[Tournai]] where van der Weyden had a workshop from 1432 onwards.

== Description ==
[[File:Weltliche Schatzkammer Wien (239)pano-new.jpg|thumb|left| Mantle of the Vestments of the Order of the Golden Fleece, [http://www.kaiserliche-schatzkammer.at/en/visit/collections/secular-treasury/selected-masterpieces/ Imperial Treasury, Vienna]]]
[[File:Mantle of the the Vestments of the Order of the Golden Fleece, detail - Imperial Treasury, Vienna KK 21.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the Mantle of the Vestments of the Order of the Golden Fleece.]]

The piece pictured is the hood. It depicts the [[Eucharist]] in the new tradition of the ''[[Devotio Moderna]]'' that arose in the [[Netherlands]] in the fifteenth century. The embroidery uses one of the most expensive of the Tournai embroiders' techniques, the ''[[Goldwork (embroidery) | or nué]] (shaded gold)'' technique in which the juxtaposed gold threads are more or less closely covered by silk threads. A famous example of this kind of work is the ''[[Mantle of the Vestments of the Order of the Golden Fleece]]'' dating from around 1425–1450 and now at the [[Imperial Treasury (Vienna) | Imperial Treasury]], [[Vienna]].

The cope was commissioned by [[Jacques of Savoy, Count of Romont]] and presented by him to the [[Bishop of Lausanne]]. The Coat of Arms of the Counts of Savoy is embroidered at the bottom and show that the work was made before 1478, the year Jacques of Savoy was admitted to the Order of the Golden Fleece, as it lacks the [[Order of the Golden Fleece | Collar of the Golden Fleece]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell &amp; Van der Stock, pp.536-40&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' has referred to it as "the world's most secretive library".&lt;ref name="kang"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/31/han-kang-bury-book-100-years-norwegian-forest-future-library|title=Han Kang to bury next book for almost 100 years in Norwegian forest|first=Alison|last=Flood|publisher=The Guardian|date=2018-08-31|accessdate=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The project was conceived by [[Katie Paterson]] during the summer of 2014. It is managed by the Future Library Trust and supported by the [[Oslo|City of Oslo]], [[Norway]]. It was produced for the Slow Space public art program and commissioned by [[Bjørvika]], Oslo's former container port, and its development corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.futurelibrary.no/|title=Future Library – Framtidsbiblioteket - Katie Paterson|page=About|accessdate=2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manuscripts will be held in a specially designed room at the new [[Oslo Public Library|Deichman Library]] (Oslo Public Library) currently under construction in Bjørvika, Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Reader offer: buy a Katie Paterson Future Library limited-edition print|url = https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/nov/23/reader-offer-katie-paterson-print-future-library|newspaper = the Guardian|date=November 23, 2014 |first = Vanessa|last = Thorpe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = In English|url = http://blogg.deichman.no/nyedeichman/in-english/|accessdate = 2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Katie Paterson has been working with the architectural team to design this part of the new public library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nothingintherulebook.com/2018/05/23/creatives-in-profile-interview-with-katie-paterson/|title=Creatives in profile – interview with Katie Paterson|date=2018-05-23|work=nothingintherulebook|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collected works will be on display but the manuscripts will not be available for reading.

The Future Library Trust's committee of trustees will make a new selection annually based on the criteria "outstanding contributions to literature or poetry, and for their work's ability to capture the imagination of this and future generations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A library that won't be read for 100 years|url = http://www.mprnews.org/story/2015/05/29/books-thread-future-library|website = www.mprnews.org|accessdate = 2015-08-09|first = Tracy|last = Mumford}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Umberto Eco]] and [[Tomas Tranströmer]], both deceased as of 2016, were previously considered as potential contributors. All other authors approached by Paterson have accepted the invitation.&lt;ref name="smh"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/the-future-library-why-you-face-a-big-wait-to-read-any-of-the-books-20170113-gtqw6i.html|title=The Future Library: Why you face a big wait to read any of the books|first=Gaby|last=Wood|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=2017-01-13|accessdate=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The Future Library project has attracted criticism for its emphasis on preventing readership between 2014 and 2114.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maggietiede.com/2018/09/05/margaret-atwood-han-kang-and-more-will-bury-their-new-novels-for-100-years-what-do-you-think-about-the-future-library-project/|first=Maggie|last=Tiede|title=Margaret Atwood, Han Kang, and more will bury their new novels for 100 years.

'''Glitch art''' is the practice of using digital or analog errors for aesthetic purposes by either corrupting digital data or physically manipulating electronic devices. Glitches appear in visual art such as the film ''A Colour Box'' (1935) by [[Len Lye]], the video sculpture ''TV Magnet'' (1965) by [[Nam June Paik]] and more contemporary work such as ''Panasonic TH-42PWD8UK Plasma Screen Burn'' (2007) by [[Cory Arcangel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Menkman | first = Rosa | author-link = Rosa Menkman | contribution = Glitch Studies Manifesto | editor1-last = Lovink | editor1-first = Geert | editor2-last = Somers-Miles | editor2-first = Rachel | title = Video Vortex Reader II: Moving Images Beyond YouTube | volume =  | pages = 336–347 | publisher = Institute of Network Cultures | place = Amsterdam | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-90-78146-12-4 | contribution-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110827222833/http://www.networkcultures.org/_uploads/%236reader_VideoVortex2PDF.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the term ==

In a technical sense, a [[glitch]] is the unexpected result of a malfunction, especially occurring in software, video games, images, videos, audio, and other digital artefacts. Early examples of glitches used in [[new media art|media art]] include ''Digital TV Dinner'' (1978) created by Jamie Fenton and Raul Zaritsky, with glitch audio done by Dick Ainsworth. This video was made by manipulating the [[Bally Astrocade|Bally video game console]] and recording the results on videotape.&lt;ref name=betancourt&gt;Betancourt, Michael. (2015) [http://www.michaelbetancourt.com/pdf/Betancourt_TheInventionofGlitchVideo.pdf The Invention of Glitch Video: Digital TV Dinner (1978) (preview)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term glitch came to be associated with music in the mid 90s to describe a genre of experimental/noise/electronica (see [[Glitch (music)|glitch music]]). Shortly after, as VJs and other visual artist began to embrace the glitch as an aesthetic of the digital age, glitch art came to refer to a whole assembly of visual arts.&lt;ref&gt;Betancourt, Michael. (2003) "Welcome to Cyberia" [http://www.michaelbetancourt.com/pdf/MAEX_Welcome_to_Cyberia_2003.pdf], ''Miami Art Exchange,'' September 19, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2002, Motherboard, a tech-art collective, held a glitch symposium in [[Oslo]], Norway, to "bring together international artists, academics and other Glitch practitioners for a short space of time to share their work and ideas with the public and with each other."&lt;ref&gt;Motherboard. (2002) http://www.liveart.org/motherboard/&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 29 thru October 3, 2010, [[Chicago]] played host to the first GLI.TC/H, a five-day conference in Chicago organized by Nick Briz, Evan Meaney, [[Rosa Menkman]] and Jon Satrom that included workshops, lectures, performances, installations and screenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = McCormack| first = Tom| title = Code Eroded: At GLI.TC/H| work = Rhizome| accessdate = 2016-08-25| date = 2010-10-13| url = http://rhizome.org/editorial/2010/oct/13/code-eroded-at-glitch/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2011, the second GLI.TC/H event traveled from [[Chicago]] to [[Amsterdam]] and lastly to [[Birmingham]], UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecreatorsproject.com/blog/chicagos-glitch-fest-disrupts-the-traditional-gallery-space The Creators Project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229055113/http://thecreatorsproject.com/blog/chicagos-glitch-fest-disrupts-the-traditional-gallery-space |date=February 29, 2012 }}. (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; It included workshops, screenings, lectures, performance, panel discussions and a gallery show over the course of seven days at the three cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Rubin| first = Josh| title = GLI.TC/H: A Chicago convention explores artistic failures of the digital world| work = Cool Hunting| accessdate = 2016-08-26| date = 2011-11-04| url = http://www.coolhunting.com/culture/glitch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What is called "glitch art" typically means visual glitches, either in a still or moving image. It is made by either "capturing" an image of a glitch as it randomly happens, or more often by artists/designers manipulating their digital files, software or hardware to produce these "errors." Artists have posted a variety of tutorials online explaining how to make glitch art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://danieltemkin.com/Tutorials Daniel Temkin, "Glitch Tutorials," DanielTemkin.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://phillipstearns.wordpress.com/glitch-art-resources/ Phillip Stearns, "Glitch Art Resources," phillipstearns.wordpress.com]&lt;/ref&gt; There are many approaches to making these glitches happen on demand, ranging from physical changes to the hardware to direct alternations of the digital files themselves. Artist [[Michael Betancourt]] identified five areas of manipulation that are used to create "glitchart."&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Betancourt]], "Glitch Art in Theory and Practice," Cinegraphic.net May 20, 2016 [http://www.cinegraphic.net/article.php?story=20160520143014412]&lt;/ref&gt; Betancourt notes that "glitch art" is defined by a broad range of technical approaches that can be identified with changes made to the digital file, its generative display, or the technologies used to show it (such as a video screen). He includes within this range changes made to analog technologies such as television (in video art) or the physical film strip in motion pictures:

===Data manipulation===
[[File:My first datamosh.webm|thumb|right|200px|An example of datamoshing]]
Data manipulation  (aka ''[[databending]]'') changes the information inside the digital file to create glitches. Databending involves editing and changing the file data. There are a variety of tutorials explaining how to make these changes using programs such as HexFiend.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Betancourt]], "An Easy 7-Step Protocol for Databending," ''Signal Culture Cookbook,'' 2014 [http://www.michaelbetancourt.com/pdf/Cookbook_Databending.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Woodall explains in his tutorial
&lt;blockquote&gt;Like all files, image files (.jpg .bmp .gif etc) are all made up of text. Unlike some other files, like .svg (vectors) or .html (web pages), when an image is opened in a text editor all that comes up is gobbldygook!&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fizzpop.org.uk/an-introduction-to-databending/ Adam Woodall, "An introduction to databending ," FizzPop, May 15, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Related processes such as '''datamoshing''' changes the data in a video or picture file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Datamoshing Technique for Video Art Production|journal=芸術科学会論文誌 - The Journal of The Society for Art and Science|volume=13|url=http://www.art-science.org/journal/v13n3/v13n3pp154/artsci-v13n3pp154.pdf|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="flossmanuals"/&gt;  Datamoshing with software such as [[Avidemux]] is a common method for creating glitch art by manipulating different frame types in compressed digital video: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Datamoshing involves the removal of an encoded video’s I-frames (intra-coded picture, also known as key frames—a frame that does not require any information regarding another frame to be decoded), leaving only the P- (predicted picture) or B- (bi-predictive picture) frames. P-frames contain information predicting the changes in the image between the current frame and the previous one, and B-frames contain information predicting the image differences between the previous, current and subsequent frames. Because P- and B-frames use data from previous and forward frames, they are more compressed than I-Frames."&lt;ref&gt;Zinman, Gregory (2015). ‘Getting Messy: Chance and Glitch in Contemporary Video Art,’ in Abstract Video: The Moving Image in Contemporary Art, edited by Gabrielle Jennings. Oakland: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This process of direct manipulation of the digital data is not restricted to files that only appear on digital screens. "3D model glitching" refers to the purposeful corruption of the code in [[List of 3D animation software|3D animation program]]s resulting in distorted and abstract images of 3D [[virtual world]]s, [[3D modeling|models]] and even [[3D printing|3D printed objects]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turk|first1=Victoria|title=3D-Printed Mistakes Are Inspiring a New Kind of Glitch Art|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/read/3d-printed-mistakes-are-inspiring-a-new-kind-of-glitch-art|publisher=Vice Motherboard|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misalignment===
Misalignment glitches are produced by opening a digital file of one type with a program designed for a different type of file,&lt;ref name="flossmanuals"&gt;{{cite web|title=Encoding Explained|url=https://flossmanuals.net/a-look-at-open-video/encoding-explained/|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as opening a video file as a sound file, or using the wrong codec to decompress a file.  Tools commonly used to create glitches of this type include [[Audacity (audio editor)|Audacity]] and [[WordPad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=databending and glitch art primer, part 1: the wordpad effect|url=http://blog.animalswithinanimals.com/2008/08/databending-and-glitch-art-primer-part.html|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artist Jamie Boulton explains the process and the glitches it produces, noting that these glitches depend on how Audacity handles files, even when they are not audio-encoded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The easiest way to manipulate a file in Audacity is to select a section of the file and apply one of the built in sound effects to it. Now I’m no computing whizz kid but the way I see it when you apply a sound effect to a sound file, the program takes that file and alters the file data in the manner which it’s been told will achieve that effect. So, for example, if you were to apply an echo effect then it would repeat parts of the file, diminishing the repetition after each iteration. The wonderful thing is that it will do this regardless of what the file actually is. Audacity doesn’t know or care whether the file is a sound or not, it will alter it in the manner instructed.&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Boulton, "Databending using Audacity Effects," Question Something, July 26, 2012 [https://questionsomething.wordpress.com/2012/07/26/databending-using-audacity-effects/]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Hardware failure===
Hardware failure happens by altering the physical wiring or other internal connections of the machine itself, such as a short-circuit, in a process called "[[circuit bending]]" causes the machine to create glitches that produce new sounds and visuals.&lt;ref name=wired1&gt;{{cite web|title=Glitch art created by 'databending'|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/glitch-art-databending|work=Wired|first=Duncan |last= Geere |accessdate=19 July 2016|date=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, by damaging internal pieces of something like a [[VHS]] player, one can achieve different colorful visual images. Video artist [[Tom DeFanti]] explained the role of hardware failure in a voice-over for Jamie Fenton's early glitch video ''Digital TV Dinner'' that used the [[Bally Astrocade|Bally video game console]] system:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This piece represents the absolute cheapest one can go in home computer art. This involves taking a $300 video game system, pounding it with your fist so the cartridge pops out while its trying to write the menu.  The music here is done by Dick Ainsworth using the same system, but pounding it with your fingers instead of your fist.&lt;ref name=betancourt/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Physically beating the case of the game system would cause the game cartridge to pop out, interrupting the computer's operation. The glitches that resulted from this failure were a result of how the machine was set-up:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There was ROM memory in the cartridge and ROM memory built into the console. Popping out the cartridge while executing code in the console ROM created garbage references in the stack frames and invalid pointers, which caused the strange patterns to be drawn. [...] The Bally Astrocade was unique among cartridge games in that it was designed to allow users to change game cartridges with power-on. When pressing the reset button, it was possible to remove the cartridge from the system and induce various memory dump pattern sequences. Digital TV Dinner is a collection of these curious states of silicon epilepsy set to music composed and generated upon this same platform.&lt;ref name=betancourt/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Misregistration===
Misregistration is produced by the physical noise of historically analog media such as motion picture film. It includes dirt, scratches, smudges and markings that can distort physical media also impact the playback of digital recordings on media such as CDs and DVDs, as electronic music composer [[Kim Cascone]] explained in 2002:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"There are many types of digital audio ‘failure.' Sometimes, it results in horrible noise, while other times it can produce wondrous tapestries of sound. (To more adventurous ears, these are quite often the same.) When the German sound experimenters known as Oval started creating music in the early 1990s by painting small images on the underside of CDs to make them skip, they were using an aspect of ‘failure' in their work that revealed a subtextual layer embedded in the compact disc.

Oval's investigation of ‘failure' is not new. Much work had previously been done in this area such as the optical soundtrack work of Laszlo Moholy-Nagy and Oskar Fischinger, as well as the vinyl record manipulations of John Cage and Christian Marclay, to name a few. What is new is that ideas now travel at the speed of light and can spawn entire musical genres in a relatively short period of time."&lt;ref name=Cascone1&gt;{{cite web|title=THE AESTHETICS OF FAILURE 'Post-Digital' Tendencies in Contemporary Computer Music|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/journals/COMJ/CMJ24_4Cascone.pdf|work=''Computer Music Journal,'' 24:4 Winter 2002 (MIT Press)|first=Kim |last=Cascone | author-link = Kim_Cascone |accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Distortion===
Distortion was one of the earliest types of glitch art to be produced, such as in the work of video artist [[Nam June Paik]], who created video distortions by placing powerful magnets in close proximity to the television screen, resulting in the appearance of abstract patterns.&lt;ref name=Keys1&gt;{{cite web|title=Error Message|url=http://www.richardbkeys.net/error-message/|first=Richard B. |last=Keys |accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paik's addition of physical interference to a TV set created new kinds of imagery that changed how the broadcast image was displayed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The magnetic field interferes with the television’s electronic signals, distorting the broadcast image into an abstract form that changes when the magnet is moved.&lt;ref&gt;"Nam June Paik: TV Magnet," Whitney Museum of American Art, web description for accession number 86.60a-b [http://collection.whitney.org/object/6139]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By recording the resulting distortions with a camera, they can then be shown without the need for the magnet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18859">An '''Inquisition post mortem''' (abbreviated to '''Inq.p.m.''' or '''i.p.m.''', and formerly known as an '''escheat''')&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell-Lyte, Introduction, uses the term "inquisition post mortem" and states they were "formerly known as 'escheats'". Modern academic usage favours the term Inq.p.m., see e.g. the Winchester University project, op.cit.&lt;/ref&gt; (Latin, meaning "(inquisition) after death") is an English medieval record of the death, estate and heir of one of the king's [[tenant-in-chief|tenants-in-chief]], made for royal fiscal purposes. The process of making such inquisition was effected by the royal escheators in each county where the deceased held land. The earliest inq.p.m. was made in 1236, in the reign of [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] (1216–1272), and the practice ceased c.1640, at the start of the Civil War, and was finally abolished by the [[Tenures Abolition Act 1660]], which ended the feudal system.

==Purpose==
The escheators were ordered by a writ from the king's [[Court of Chancery|chancery]] to investigate the deaths of tenants-in-chief in order to assess what monetary value was due to the king from his so-called feudal incidents, comprising for example feudal relief, wardships, and marriages. Such revenues which resulted from the deaths of his tenants-in-chief formed a significant proportion of the [[History of the English fiscal system|mediaeval royal revenues]]. The feudal due which was payable to the king on the inheritance of the lands by the tenant's heir is termed a [[Feudal relief|relief]], from Latin ''levo, levare'' (to lift-up), plus ''re'' (again), signifying the process of re-elevating the heir to the honourable position of the deceased, as a [[lord of the manor]] and tenant-in-chief. The scale of reliefs payable to the king by his tenants-in-chief who held under the [[feudal land tenure]] of [[English feudal barony|barony]] had become a fixed sum under clause two of [[Magna Carta]] (1215), but the king nevertheless needed to know who the heir was so payment of the relief could be demanded. If the tenant-in-chief was found to have no heir, for example if he was unmarried or childless, the lands held would "escheat" (i.e. revert to the [[demesne]] of the king) to be re-granted as a valuable reward to a favoured courtier or official, or sold for cash proceeds. This aspect of the process was the origin of their former appellation by early Victorian antiquarians of "escheats". If the tenant-in-chief left a minor son as heir, that is to say one aged under 21, his wardship escheated likewise to the king, who was able to sell or award his marriage to a third party. Generally the marriages of such wards were purchased by wealthy men as husbands for their own daughters, and a marriage contract was drawn up at the direction of the bride's father which [[entail]]ed the ward's future estate onto the progeny of the marriage. Thus the wealthy purchaser's grandchildren became the inheritors of the ward's estate. If the deceased tenant-in-chief left a minor daughter, that is to say one aged under 14, or one younger who was not contracted in marriage, as sole heiress (or more as joint-heiresses), her wardship and marriage likewise escheated to the king. Such wardships constituted a significant part of the royal revenues in mediaeval times.

==Avoidance measures==
The practice arose amongst tenants-in-chief of transferring the legal title in their lands to [[feoffee|feoffees to uses]], which effectively established trusts enabling the tenant-in-chief to continue to use the land and its revenues, but to avoid being officially recognised in law as the legal holder. This exempted him from the scope of the Inquisition post mortem, as the legal holders were effectively an immortal [[corporation]] one or two of whose constituent feoffees could on occasion die, only to be replaced by others. Such avoidance devices were apparently tolerated by the crown for a considerable time, yet on the accession of [[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII]] (1485–1509)
the king's ancient right to his feudal incidents was enforced with determination and ruthlessness.

==Procedure==
For an heir to inherit his paternal lands a formal and lengthy standard procedure had to be completed, only at the end of which he could "sue out his [[livery of seisin]]" (i.e. gain physical possession of his inheritance), so it was in his best interest to get the process started as soon as possible after the death. He himself, or his relatives if a minor, would generally inform the king's chancery that the death had occurred,&lt;ref&gt;That the heir himself generally sued for a writ of ''diem clausit extremum'' is noted by Fleming, Peter &amp; Wood, Michael, in Gloucestershire's Forgotten Battle: Nibley Green 1470&lt;/ref&gt; and this would prompt the production of a writ by the chancery under the king's [[Great Seal of the Realm|great seal]] addressed to the various escheators of the counties in which the deceased held lands, known as a writ ''diem clausit extremum''.  This writ, the earliest identified example of which dates from 1254,&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell-Lyte&lt;/ref&gt; informed the escheator that the king had been informed (''quia datum est nobis intelligi'' ("because it has been given to us to know")) that the tenant-in-chief named had "closed his last day", as the Latin phrase by which the writ has become known may be translated, and that he was ordered to hold an inquisition ''post mortem'', and to send the resultant report back to the chancery, with his seal and with the writ ''diem clausit extremum'' sewn onto it. On receipt of the writ the escheator requested the sheriff of the county concerned to empanell a jury made up of local freeholders, that is to say persons of social standing, who could be relied upon to provide the standard information required in accurate form. Such information, termed 'the jurors' "verdict"' &lt;ref&gt;Called a verdict in contemporary correspondence re the Inq.p.m. of William Paston (d.1444), see Winchester University case study 2: Informing the Escheator&lt;/ref&gt; comprised:
*Date of death
*Name of heir
*Age of heir
*Name of manors held in chief
*Name of manors held from other persons
*Extent (i.e. area/size) of manors
*Annual value of manors
*Nature of [[feudal land tenure|feudal tenure]]s &amp; services due
The most immediate order in the writ however was that requiring the escheator to take control of all the deceased's [[demesne]] lands, i.e. those which had not been [[subinfeudation|sub-enfeoffed]] to [[Mesne lord|mesne tenant]]s but had been managed in-hand directly by the deceased and his household officials. All revenues resulting from such lands whilst in the hands of the escheator had to be audited (i.e. accounted for before the Barons of the Exchequer) periodically at the treasury.

The end result of the inquisition would be one of the three following, depending on what the jury reported:
*If the vassal had died with an heir who was of age, then a fine was paid to the king for the right of the heir to inherit, namely his [[feudal relief|relief]].
*If the heir was underage, that is to say under 21 for a male and under 14 for a female, then the heir and the lands were placed into royal [[wardship]].
*If there was no heir, then the lands [[escheat]]ed (i.e. reverted) to the king's royal [[demesne]].

==Form of permanent record==
Inquisitions post mortem (or "escheats") were recorded on two duplicate sheets of parchment. The original return was held in the records of the [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]], to which department the escheator had made his original return, the other by the [[treasury]], which had caused a copy to be made for fiscal purposes, in order to verify the escheator's accounts&lt;ref&gt;National Archives, op.cit., para 5&lt;/ref&gt; which were presented to the treasury periodically. Unlike some other series of records, they were not historically sewn together as rolls, but in modern times the parchment sheets have been bound in files with covers, and are today held at the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]] in Kew. The documents formerly comprising the chancery records are classified under the initial letter "C", whilst those from the exchequer bear the class letter "E". After the establishment of the [[Court of Wards and Liveries|Court of Wards]] in 1540 a copy of the Inq.p.m. was also sent to that court, and these records also survive at the National Archives classified as "WARD 7". When an Inq.p.m. had been held not as a result of a writ from chancery but under the escheator's own authority, the verdict was sent to the exchequer only.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives, para.5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Value as historical source documents==
Inquisitions post mortem form a valuable source for historians and genealogists, as they not only detail the familial relationships of many of the English nobility and gentry, but also provide information on the history of individual [[manor]]s, including their size and forms of tenure by which they were held.&lt;ref name=Lyon478&gt;Lyon ''Constitutional and Legal History'' p. 478&lt;/ref&gt; They thus constitute "one of the most important sources for the social and economic history of mediaeval England".&lt;ref&gt;Winchester University, stated in several passages&lt;/ref&gt; They also provide summaries and terms of settlements made during the lifetime of the deceased, for example settlement to feoffees, the original copy of which has rarely survived.

==Example==
The following example of the abstracted Latin inq.p.m. of William Pagam (d.1422), published in 1995 as no. 932 in vol. 20, 6–10 Henry V, of the ''Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem'', illustrates many common elements:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Writ 24 July 1422. Hampshire. Inquisition. Alton, 26 Aug.
He held of the king in-chief in his demesne as of fee the manor of Drayton, annual value 8 marks, for 6s. 8d. paid to the king by the constable of Porchester Castle at Michaelmas and providing at his own expense for 15 days a hobbler to keep the castle in time of war. By an indenture of 26 Oct. 1418, shown to the jurors, William Tauk, Robert Monkeston and Thomas Welegh, who were seised in their demesne as of fee, granted the manor of Pury, a messuage, carucate and 13 acres meadow, 40 a. pasture and 20 a. wood at "la Bere juxta Southwyke" as lands and tenements in Pury, Badley, "Colvyle", "Holdmede", and "Bere", to William Pagam and his wife Agnes, who survives, for life of Agnes, remainder to William and his heirs in fee simple. The manor of Pury, annual value 6 marks, is held of the king in chief, service unknown. The messuage, carucate, arable, meadow, pasture and wood at "le Bere" annual value 40s. are held of the king in chief for 7s. 4d. paid to the king by the constable of Porchester Castle at Michaelmas. He died on 15 July last. Philip Pagam is his son and next heir, aged 6 years and more. C 138/63, no.26A"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here the manor of Drayton is held by the [[Feudal land tenure|feudal military tenure]] of [[castle-guard]]; the manor of Pury had been transferred to feoffees to uses, and was re-granted by them in 1418 back to William and his wife for their uses under trust.

==Calendars of Inq.p.m's.==
Printed [[Calendar (archives)|calendars]] (abstracted summaries) of almost all the rolls of Inq.p.m.'s have been published in some form, with the exception of the periods 1447–1485 and 1509–1660. An extensive series of calendars extending from the reign of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] to that of [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], and with an appendix of lists to the reign of [[James VI and I]], was published in four volumes by the [[Record Commission]] between 1806 and 1828, edited by [[John Caley]] and [[John Bayley (antiquary)|John Bayley]]. However, these volumes were later judged by Sir [[Henry Maxwell Lyte]] to be of "unsatisfactory character", and to contain many omissions. In 1865 two volumes were published, covering the reigns of Henry III and [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], in a new series edited by Charles Roberts entitled ''Calendarium Genealogicum'', which concentrated on providing the names of heirs omitted from the previous publications, designed to be of particular use to genealogists. In 1898 the production of three volumes covering the reign of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] (1485–1509) was started, and was completed in 1955. In 1904 the first volume of a new series of Inq.p.m.'s was published, intended to be more complete and systematic, under Maxwell Lyte's editorship. It covered the reign of Henry III, from 1236, when the practice of producing inq.p.m.'s began. This "first series" continued for 26 volumes, the last volume having been published in 2009, although volumes were not published in chronological order. [[Winchester University]] and the [[Department of Digital Humanities]] at [[King's College London]] are currently working on a project to publish on-line in searchable format a revised and expanded series of all existing texts covering the years 1236–1447 and 1485–1509.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inquisitionspostmortem.ac.uk |title=Inquisitions Post Mortem – Mapping the Medieval Countryside: properties, places &amp; people |accessdate=19 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project also aims in the long-term to produce calendars for the first time of the periods 1447–1485 and 1509–1542. A number of county [[Text publication society|record societies]] have published calendars of Inq.p.m.'s relating to their own counties, abstracted from the chancery and exchequer rolls.

'''Jill Marsden''' (born 1964) is a scholar of the work of German philosopher [[Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche]]. Marsden, from [[Nottingham]], took her BA, MA and PhD from the [[University of Essex]]. Her [[doctoral thesis]] explored Nietzsche's Doctrine of Eternal Return. 

In 2002, Marsden's first book, ''After Nietzsche: Notes Towards a Philosophy of Ecstasy'', was published by [[Palgrave Macmillan]]. The text explores the imaginative possibilities for philosophy created by Nietzsche's sustained reflection on the phenomenon of "ecstasy". From ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' (1872) to his experimental "physiology of art", Nietzsche examines the aesthetic, erotic and sacred dimensions of rapture, hinting at how an ecstatic philosophy is realized in his elusive doctrine of Eternal Return. Marsden's book pursues the implications of this legacy for contemporary continental thought via analyses of such voyages in ecstasy as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Schopenhauer]], [[Daniel Paul Schreber|Schreber]] and [[Georges Bataille|Bataille]].

Marsden is a senior lecturer in Philosophy at the [[University of Bolton]]. She is at work on her second volume, set to explore 'the art of [[wiktionary:Brevity|brevity]]'. Outside of her work on Nietzsche, Marsden's research interests include [[aesthetics]], [[feminism]] and [[literature]], on which themes she has published articles in, among others, the ''Journal of the British Society for Phenomenology'' and ''Women's Philosophy Review''.

'''Kitsch''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɪ|tʃ}}; [[loanword]] from [[German language|German]]), also called '''cheesiness''' or '''tackiness''', is art or other objects that appeal to [[popular culture|popular]] rather than [[High culture|high art]] tastes. Such objects are sometimes appreciated in a knowingly [[ironic]] or humorous way.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=kitsch American Heritage Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/kitsch?a=british Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/kitsch Oxford Living Dictionaries]&lt;/ref&gt; The word was first applied to artwork that was a response to certain divisions of 19th-century art with [[aesthetics]] that favored what later art critics would consider to be exaggerated [[sentimentality]] and [[melodrama]]. Hence, 'kitsch art' is closely associated with 'sentimental art'. Kitsch is also related to the concept of [[camp (style)|camp]], because of its humorous and [[irony|ironic]] nature.

To brand visual art as "kitsch" is generally [[pejorative]], as it implies that the work in question is gaudy, or that it serves a solely ornamental and decorative purpose rather than amounting to a work of true artistic merit. The term is also sometimes applied to music or literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scruton|first1=Roger|authorlink1=Roger Scruton|date=Feb 21, 2014|title=A fine line between art and kitsch|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerscruton/2014/02/21/a-fine-line-between-art-and-kitsch/#7fbd667e3679|website=Forbes|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
As a descriptive term, ''kitsch'' originated in the art markets of [[Munich#Capital of reunited Bavaria|Munich]] in the 1860s and the 1870s, describing cheap, popular, and marketable pictures and sketches.&lt;ref&gt;Calinescu, Matei. Five Faces of Modernity. Kitsch, p.&amp;nbsp;234.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Das Buch vom Kitsch'' (''The Book of Kitsch''), [[Hans Reimann (writer)|Hans Reimann]] defines it as a professional expression "born in a painter's studio".

The study of kitsch was done almost exclusively in German until the 1970s, with [[Walter Benjamin]] being an important scholar in the field.&lt;ref name="menninghaus"&gt;{{cite book|last=Menninghaus|first=Winfried|editor=Andrew Benjamin|others=Charles Rice|title=Walter Benjamin and the Architecture of Modernity| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFx1D_BC5tsC&amp;pg=PA40| year=2009| publisher=re.press| isbn=9780980544091| pages=39–58| chapter=On the Vital Significance of 'Kitsch': Walter Benjamin's Politics of 'Bad Taste'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modernism|Modernist]] writer [[Hermann Broch]] argues that the essence of kitsch is imitation: kitsch mimics its immediate predecessor with no regard to ethics—it aims to copy the beautiful, not the good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Broch|first=Hermann|title=Geist and Zeitgeist: The Spirit in an Unspiritual Age. Six Essays by Hermann Broch| year=2002| publisher=Counterpoint| isbn=9781582431680|chapter=Evil in the Value System of Art|pages=13–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Walter Benjamin, kitsch is, unlike art, a utilitarian object lacking all critical distance between object and observer; it "offers instantaneous emotional gratification without intellectual effort, without the requirement of distance, without sublimation".&lt;ref name="menninghaus"/&gt;

Kitsch is less about the thing observed than about the observer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eaglestone|first1=Robert|title=The Broken Voice: Reading Post-Holocaust Literature|date=May 25, 2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0191084204|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Roger Scruton]], "Kitsch is fake art, expressing fake emotions, whose purpose is to deceive the consumer into thinking he feels something deep and serious."&lt;ref name=Scruton&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-30439633 Scruton, Roger. "A Point of View: The strangely enduring power of kitsch", ''BBC News Magazine'', December 12, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomáš Kulka in ''Kitsch and Art'' starts from two basic facts that kitsch "has an undeniable mass-appeal" and "considered (by the art-educated elite) bad" and then proposes three essential conditions: 
# Kitsch depicts a beautiful or highly emotionally charged subject; 
# The depicted subject is instantly and effortlessly identifiable
# Kitsch does not substantially enrich our associations related to the depicted subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Kitsch and art|last=Tomas|first=Kulka|date=|publisher=Pennsylvania State Univ.

{{Hegelianism}}
'''''Lectures on Aesthetics''''' ('''''LA'''''; {{lang-de|Vorlesungen über die Ästhetik}}, '''''VÄ''''') is a compilation of notes from university lectures on [[aesthetics]] given by [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] in Heidelberg in 1818 and in Berlin in 1820/21, 1823, 1826 and 1828/29. It was compiled in 1835 by his student [[Heinrich Gustav Hotho]], using Hegel's own hand-written notes and notes his students took during the lectures, but Hotho's work may render some of Hegel's thought more systematic than Hegel's initial presentation.&lt;ref&gt;G. W. F. Hegel, ''Aesthetics. Lectures on Fine Art'', trans. T. M. Knox, 2 vols. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel's Aesthetics is regarded by many as one of the greatest aesthetic theories to have been produced since [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;Houlgate, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel's thesis about the historical dissolution of art has been the subject of much scholarly debate and influenced such thinkers like [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[György Lukács]], [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Arthur Danto]]. Hegel was himself influenced by [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Friedrich Schiller]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]]. Heidegger calls Hegel's ''Lectures on Aesthetics'' "the most comprehensive reflection on the essence of [[art]] that the West possesses".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''Gesamtausgabe'', vol. 5, Frankfurt, 1977, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
Hegel develops his account of art as a mode of absolute spirit that he calls "the beautiful ideal," which he defines most generally as &lt;blockquote&gt;Now when truth in this its external existence [''Dasein''] is present to consciousness immediately, and with the concept remains immediately in unity with its external appearance, the Idea is not only true but ''beautiful''. ''Beauty'' is determined as the sensible ''shining'' of the Idea.&lt;ref&gt;(''LA'' 111/''VÄ'' I.151)&lt;/ref&gt;     &lt;/blockquote&gt;This ideal is developed throughout the ''Lectures'' accordance Hegel's ''[[Science of Logic|Logic]]'':
#The first ''universal'' part is devoted to the concept of the artistic ideal.
#The second ''particular'' part examines this ideal as it actualizes itself in three stages:
##Symbolic art, understood to encompass everything before Classical Greek art
##Classical art
##Romantic art, understood to emerge with the advent of Christianity on the world stage
#The third ''singular'' part concerns itself with an examination of each of the five major arts in ascending order of "inwardness":
##[[architecture]]
##sculpture
##[[painting]]
##[[music]]
##poetry

In these second two parts of the ''Lectures'', Hegel documents the development of art from the paradigmatically [[symbol]]ic architecture to the paradigmatically classical [[sculpture]] to the [[romantic poetry|romantic]] arts of painting, music, and [[poetry]]. At the time it was noted for the wealth of pictures included with it.&lt;!-- Citation? --&gt;

Contrary to once-common belief, Hegel nowhere declares art to be "dead." What he says, in a representative statement is, "For us art counts no longer as the highest mode in which truth procures existence for itself."&lt;ref&gt;''LA'' 103/''VÄ'' I.141&lt;/ref&gt; He speaks frequently of its "dissolution" [''Auflösung''], not its end [''Ende''], despite Hotho's use of the latter for the heading of the final moment of the Romantic art form.

[[File:Dancer sculpture by Degas at the Met.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A photograph of the sculpture]]
'''''The Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer''''' (French: ''La Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans'')  is a sculpture begun c. 1880 by [[Edgar Degas]] of a young student of the [[Paris Opera Ballet]] dance school, a Belgian named [[Marie van Goethem]].

==Description==
The sculpture is one-third life size and was originally sculpted in wax, a somewhat unusual choice of medium for the time. It is dressed in a real [[bodice]], [[tutu (clothing)|tutu]] and [[ballet slippers]] and has a wig of real hair. All but a hair ribbon and the tutu are covered in wax. The 28 bronze repetitions that appear in museums and galleries around the world today were cast after Degas' death.  The tutus worn by the bronzes vary from museum to museum.

The exact relationship between [[Marie van Goethem]] and Edgar Degas is a matter of debate. It was common in 1880 for the "Petits Rats" of the Paris Opera to seek protectors from among the wealthy visitors at the back door of the opera.

Realistic wax figures with real hair and real clothes had also been popular in religious, Folk, and fine arts for centuries before Degas created his ''Little Dancer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Degas Sculptures|last=Joseph Czestochowski and Anne Pingeot|first=|last2=Reff|first2=Theodore|publisher=Torch Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=Memphis|pages=52–3|chapter=To Make Sculpture Modern}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Degas and the Little Dancer|last=Kendall|first=Richard|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arms are taut, and the legs and feet are placed in a ballet position akin to fourth position at rest, and there is tension in the pose, an image of a ballerina being put through her paces, not posing in an angelic way. Her face is – "contorted, people thought it was a deliberate image of ugliness, but you could also say it's the image of a sickly gawky adolesecent who is being made to do something she doesn't totally want to do."&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Marlow]] on... Degas, Sickert &amp; Toulouse-Lautrec' Channel 5 TV&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Edgar Degas La Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans cast in 1997.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Angle from "The Complete Sculptures of Edgar Degas" collection at [[M.T. Abraham Foundation]], cast in 1997. Note the varying tutu.]]When the ''La Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans'' was shown in Paris at the Sixth Impressionist Exhibition of 1881, it received mixed reviews. [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]] called it "the first truly modern attempt at sculpture I know." Certain critics were shocked by the piece, and the dancer was compared to a monkey and an [[Aztec]]. One critic, Paul Mantz, called her the "flower of precocious depravity," with a face "marked by the hateful promise of every vice" and "bearing the signs of a profoundly heinous character."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=2011-11-02 | url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-10-11/features/1998284216_1_classical-sculpture-original-sculpture-dancer | title=Degas's Little Dancer is still on the point of controversy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparisons with older art were made, perhaps partly because it was exhibited in a glass case, like classical sculpture in the [[Louvre]], and was dressed in wig and clothes.

After Degas' death, his heirs (brother and sister's children&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=2011-11-02 | url=http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/highlights/highlight110292.html | title=National Gallery of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;) made the decision to have the bronze repetitions of ''Le Petite Danseuse'' and other wax and mixed-media sculptures cast. The casting took place at the Hébrard foundry in Paris from 1920 until 1936 when the Hébrard foundry went bankrupt and closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Degas Sculptures|last=Joseph Czestochowski and Anne Pingeot|first=|last2=Pingeot|first2=Anne|publisher=Torch Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=Memphis|pages=34|chapter=Degas and His Castings}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, "Hébrard" Degas ''Little Dancer'' bronzes were cast at the Valsuani foundry in Paris until the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Degas’ Little Dancer, Aged Fourteen: The earlier version that helped spark the birth of modern art|last=Hedberg|first=Gregory|publisher=Arnoldsche Fine Art Publishers|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=10, 19, 28 n. 6–7, 30 n. 44, 74, 99 n. 221, 272–281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty-nine of Degas' wax sculptures survived the casting process. One copy of ''Le Petite Danseuse'' is currently owned by the creator and owner of [[Auto Trader Group|Auto Trader]], [[John Madejski]]. He stated that he bought the sculpture by accident.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} That copy was sold for £13,257,250 ($19,077,250) at [[Sotheby's]] on February, 3rd 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=2009-02-04 | url=http://www.artvalue.com/sale--9928--Sotheby-s-London-New-Bond-Street-L09601-Impressionist-Modern.htm | title=Auction results}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Hébrard ''Little Dancer'' bronze failed to sell at a November 2011 auction at [[Christie's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=2011-11-02 | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2011/11/02/bloomberg_articlesLU0CEK07SXKX.DTL | title=Degas Ballerina Fails to Sell at Christie's as Markets Plummet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To construct the statue, Degas used pigmented beeswax, with a metal armature, rope, and paintbrushes covered by clay for structural support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Edgar Degas Sculpture: The Collections of the National Gallery of Art, Systematic Catalogue|last=Suzanne G. Lindsay, Daphne S. Barbour, and Shelley G. Sturman|first=|publisher=National Gallery of Art|year=2010|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=116–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Little Dancer'' wax sculpture we see today is a reworked version of the original sculpture that was shown in 1881. After seeing the wax sculpture in Degas’ living quarters in April 1903, the New York collector Louisine Havemeyer expressed interest in buying the wax. After proposing a bronze or cast wax of the sculpture, which Mrs. Havemeyer refused, Degas took his wax figure upstairs to his working studio and told Vollard he was reworking the sculpture for Havemeyer for 40,000 francs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Private Collection of Edgar Degas|last=Ann Dumas, Colta Ives, Susan Alyson Stein, and Gary Tinterow|first=|last2=Tinterow|first2=Gary|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|year=1997|isbn=|location=New York|pages=101|chapter=Appendix: Mary Cassatt on the Degas Sales and the Casting of Sculpture}}&lt;/ref&gt; Degas never sold the sculpture to Mrs. Havemeyer. After Degas died, it was found in a corner of his studio. Paul Lefond, Degas’ biographer, described the ''Little Dancer'' wax after Degas’ death as "nothing but a ruin;"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Degas, vol. II|last=Lafond|first=Paul|publisher=H. Floury|year=1918–19|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mary Cassatt telegraphed Mrs. Havemeyer "Statue Bad Condition."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Degas|last=Jean Sutherland Boggs, Douglas W. Druick, Henri Loyrette, Michael Pantazzi, and Gary Tinterow|first=|last2=Pantazzi|first2=Michael|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|year=1988|isbn=|location=New York|pages=352, n. 12|chapter=The Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the wax sculpture we know today is not a ruin. It is Degas' reworked second version of his wax figure. At some point before Degas extensively reworked his sculpture, he allowed a plaster to be cast from the wax figure. This recently re-discovered plaster records the ''Little Dancer''’s original pose, bodice, and hairdo. The plaster is now in a private collection in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Degas’ Little Dancer, Aged Fourteen: The earlier version that helped spark the birth of modern art|last=Hedberg|first=Gregory|publisher=Arnoldsche|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=10–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original wax sculpture was acquired by [[Paul Mellon]] in 1956. Beginning in 1985, Mr and Mrs Mellon gave the [[National Gallery of Art]] 49 Degas waxes, 10 bronzes and 2 plasters, the largest group of original Degas sculptures. ''Little Dancer'' was among the bequests. In 1997, the Airaindor-Valsuani foundry in France began casting a limited edition of Degas bronzes from the pre-1903 ''Little Dancer'' plaster. One such ''Little Dancer'' bronze is owned by the [[M.T. Abraham Foundation]], which, at times, is lent to other institutions and museums including the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Edgar Degas: Figures in Motion|last=Mikhail B. Piotrovsky, Amir Gross Kabiri, Geraldine Norman, Jon Whiteley, June Hargrove, and Dalit Lahav-Durst|first=|publisher=Petronius Publishing House, Ltd.|year=2013|isbn=|location=St. Petersburg|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the various states of many of Degas' prints, the Valsuani bronzes record the first version of Degas' ''Little Dancer'', while the Hébrard casts record the second and final state of the sculpture.

Art historian Richard Kendall published a scholarly account of the history of Degas's sculpture, ''Degas and the Little Dancer'', with contributions by Douglas Druick and Arthur Beale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Kendall|title=Degas and the Little Dancer|publisher=Yale university Press|year=1998|isbn=0-300-07497-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC Two]] documentary ''[[The Private Life of a Masterpiece]]: Little Dancer Aged Fourteen'', produced in 2004, closely examines the sculpture, the model, the circumstances of her life, and the critical reaction to the work. [[Cathy Marie Buchanan]]'s novel, ''The Painted Girls'', presents a fictionalised account of the life of [[Marie van Goethem]], the model for the sculpture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=2009-02-04 | url=http://www.cathymariebuchanan.com/books/the-painted-girls | title=The Painted Girls}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does Carolyn Meyer's young adult novel ''Marie, Dancing''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=2009-02-04 | url=http://www.readcarolyn.com/marie__dancing_109898.htm | title=Marie, Dancing}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Laurence Anholt's children's picture book ''Degas and the Little Dancer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date= | url=http://barronseduc.com/0812065832.html | title=Degas and the Little Dancer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. premiered the stage musical, ''[[Little Dancer (musical)|Little Dancer]]'', inspired by the story of the young ballerina immortalized by Edgar Degas in his famous sculpture. On September 12, 2016, Dr. Gregory Hedberg presented a paper entitled "Unraveling the Mysteries of Degas’ ''Little Dancer, Aged Fourteen''," at the French Institute, Alliance Français, in New York City.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pr3OYfY0zc&amp;feature=youtu.be|title="Unraveling the Mysteries of Degas’ Little Dancer, Aged Fourteen"|last=Hedberg|first=Gregory|date=|website=YouTube|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The piece inspired two of [[Damien Hirst]]'s works, ''Virgin Mother'' and ''[[Verity (sculpture)|Verity]]''.&lt;ref name="Mail"&gt;{{cite web

'''Mosan art''' is a regional style of art from the valley of the [[Meuse river|Meuse]] in present-day [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Germany]]. Although in a broader sense the term applies to art from this region from all periods, it generally refers to [[Romanesque art]], with Mosan [[Romanesque architecture]], [[stone carving]], [[Metalsmith|metalwork]], [[Vitreous enamel|enamelling]] and [[Illuminated manuscript|manuscript illumination]] reaching a high level of development during the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries.

==Development of Mosan art and geographical spread==
The Meuse valley lay in the heart of the [[Carolingian Empire]] and therefore the style draws largely from the heritage of the [[Carolingian art]] tradition. Thus, Mosan art contains strong classical elements, which separates it from the international Romanesque style seen elsewhere during the period, for example in France,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-moyenage.fr/ang/pages/page_id18376_u1l2.htm www.musee-moyenage.fr] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051017230516/http://www.musee-moyenage.fr/ang/pages/page_id18376_u1l2.htm |date=2005-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-moyenage.fr/ang/pages/page_id18362_u1l2.htm www.musee-moyenage.fr] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051017081429/http://www.musee-moyenage.fr/ang/pages/page_id18362_u1l2.htm |date=2005-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; England and Italy. However, it shares with mainstream Romanesque art elements such as the treatment of space. Although the [[iconography]] of 11th- and 12th-century Meuse valley art largely draws on [[Bible|Biblical]] inspiration, some of the elaborately carved capitals in the two main churches in [[Maastricht]] depict scenes from many aspects of daily life, as well as images from an intriguing world of fantasy.

The Mosan region was formed largely by the boundary of the [[Bishopric of Liège]], which had strong political links to the emperors of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], as well as to the bishops of [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]]. The region's main artistic centres were the cities of [[Liège]], [[Huy]], [[Dinant]], [[Namur (city)|Namur]], [[Tongeren]], [[Maastricht]], [[Roermond]] and [[Aachen]], as well as a number of important monasteries: [[Sint-Truiden]], [[Church of Saint Anne, Aldeneik|Aldeneik]], [[Herkenrode Abbey|Herkenrode]], [[Averbode Abbey|Averbode]], [[Munsterbilzen Abbey|Munsterbilzen]], [[Susteren Abbey|Susteren]], [[Sint Odiliënberg]], [[Rolduc]], [[Burtscheid Abbey|Burtscheid]], [[Kornelimünster Abbey|Kornelimünster]], [[Stavelot]], [[Collegiate Church of Saint Gertrude|Nivelles]], [[Aulne Abbey|Aulne]], [[Floreffe Abbey|Floreffe]], [[Flône Abbey|Flône]], [[Celles, Houyet|Celles]], [[Gembloux Abbey|Gembloux]] and [[Lobbes Abbey|Lobbes]]. Mosan art at its peak had a strong influence on bordering regions, notably on [[Rhineland]] art ([[Cologne]], [[Bonn]]).

==Highlights of Mosan art==
Mosan Romanesque art has been described by art historians as the first golden age of Netherlandish art (before [[early Netherlandish painting]] and [[Dutch Golden Age painting]]). Usually the term Mosan art does not include [[Medieval literature]] although [[Heinrich von Veldeke]] may be considered the first poet writing in [[Middle Dutch]] (as well as [[Middle High German]]).

===Architecture===
Mosan architecture can be seen as a distinctive branch in [[Romanesque architecture]], a regional style that produced imposing churches in Aachen, Liège and Maastricht, as well as monasteries in rural areas. The fully developed Mosan style of the 12th century is a comprise between the older Meuse valley traditions and foreign influences, mainly coming from the [[Rhineland]] and [[Italy]]. An outstanding factor in Mosan architecture is the closed west front ([[westwerk]]). Unfortunately, some of the largest churches, notably [[St. Lambert's Cathedral, Liège|Liège cathedral]], and the Stavelot and Sint-Truiden abbeys, were destroyed.

===Stone carving===
Mosan stone carving reached a peak in the 12th century in Maastricht, Liège and Nivelles. Maastricht 'metsen' (stone carvers) worked on [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] and [[relief]]s as far afield as [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], [[Bonn]] and [[Eisenach]].

===Metalwork===
[[Metalsmith|Metalwork]] has been considered the high art of the 12th and early 13th-century Meuse region, culminating in the work of [[Nicholas of Verdun]], which is of exceptionally high quality. The [[Shrine of the Three Kings at Cologne Cathedral]], the Anno Shrine in [[Siegburg]] and the Shrine of Our Lady in [[Tournai]] are among his best work. Other important metalworkers were [[Renier de Huy]] and [[Hugo d'Oignies]].

===Painting, illumination and other works of art===
Very little has come to us from what must have been an impressive body of Mosan [[mural]]s. [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]], in his [[Parzival]] expressed his high regard for Maastricht (and Cologne) painters ([https://books.google.com/books?id=eII6AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA83 Parzival, 158, 13-16]). [[Illuminated manuscript|Book illumination]], like the rest of the arts, was at its zenith in the second half of the 12th century. The principal centres were the abbey of Saint Laurent in Liège and the abbeys of Stavelot and Lobbes. Another highly developed art was [[vitreous enamel]]ing.

The '''Oberlin Conservatory of Music''', located on the campus of [[Oberlin College]] in [[Oberlin, Ohio]], was founded in 1865 and is the second oldest conservatory and oldest continually operating conservatory in the United States. Students of Oberlin Conservatory enter a very broad network within the music world, as the school's alumni can be found in most major professional ensembles. It is one of the few American conservatories to be completely attached to a liberal arts college (Oberlin College).  This allows students the opportunity to seriously pursue degrees in both music and a traditional liberal arts subject via the five year Double-Degree program. Oberlin College and Conservatory pride themselves on being almost exclusively undergraduate.

==History==
[[File:Oberlin music1.jpg|thumb|left|Bibbins Hall houses many of the conservatory's Classical Department and administration.]]
The Oberlin Collegiate Institute was built on {{convert|500|acre|km2}} of land, founded in 1833 and became Oberlin College in 1850. In 1867, two years after the Oberlin Conservatory's founding in 1865, the previously separate Oberlin Conservatory became incorporated with the college on a similar grant.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, Robert Samuel. ''A History of Oberlin College From Its Foundation Through the Civil War''. Chicago:  R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Company, 1943. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In tandem, the administration claimed that "Oberlin is peculiar in that which is good," notable as the first college and first conservatory in the United States to regularly admit African-American students. Oberlin College's role as an educator of African-American students prior to the Civil War and thereafter is historically significant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ohioswallow.com/book/Constructing+Black+Education+at+Oberlin+College Constructing Black Education at Oberlin College]&lt;/ref&gt; Notable is the graduation of [[William Grant Still]], a student who widely became regarded as the "dean of African-American composers." These efforts have helped Oberlin remain committed to its values of freedom, social justice, and service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://new.oberlin.edu/events-activities/black-history/at-oberlin.dot African Americans at Oberlin, Then and Now] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308152212/http://new.oberlin.edu/events-activities/black-history/at-oberlin.dot |date=March 8, 2012 }} The College's approach to African Americans was by no means perfect.  Nonetheless, Oberlin graduates accounted for a significant percentage of African American College graduates at the end of the 19th Century.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Kohl Building.jpeg|thumb|right|The Kohl Building, home of the Jazz and Musicology Departments, opened in 2010]]
It is also the oldest continuously operating [[coeducational]] conservatory, since its incorporation with Oberlin College, [[List of mixed-sex colleges and universities in the United States|the first coeducational college]]. The college and conservatory were listed as a [[National Historic Landmark]] on December 21, 1965, for its significance in social progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=450&amp;ResourceType=Site|title=National Historic Landmarks Program - Oberlin College|work=|accessdate=8 May 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017184121/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=450&amp;ResourceType=Site|archivedate=17 October 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the Conservatory's affiliation with [[Elisha Gray]], inventor of the [[Synthesizer|electromechanical oscillator]], and [[Thaddeus Cahill]], inventor of the [[telharmonium]], Oberlin Conservatory plays a role in the origins of [[electronic music]]. The [[TIMARA]] (Technology In Music And Related Arts) program was the world's first conservatory program in this field, established in 1967. Brian Jortner is widely recognized as the first student-professor to have performed noise music in an academic context, eventually becoming widely recognized for his famous "I Make A Mess;;;" series of acoustic pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dilloway|first1=Aaron|title=Musician|website=www.hansonrecords.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oberlin Conservatory was the recipient of the 2009 [[National Medal of Arts]], the highest award given by the United States government to artists and arts patrons in recognition of the wealth and depth of their creative expressions. The Oberlin Conservatory of Music is the only professional music school to be so honored by President Barack Obama.

==Admissions==
Due to the conservatory's affiliation with Oberlin College, students may either enter the Conservatory only or Oberlin's five year Double-Degree program, in which the student will complete both a [[Bachelor of Music]] degree as well as a [[Bachelor of Arts]]. Admission is based primarily on an extremely competitive audition: over 1,400 musicians from around the world apply for a freshman class of around 120.

==Facilities==
The Conservatory was previously housed in Warner Hall, a large stone building where the King Building now stands. It now occupies four interconnected buildings on the south side of Tappan Square. The original structure of three big white buildings was designed by the Japanese-American architect [[Minoru Yamasaki]] in 1963, which closely resembles Yamasaki's later design of the  [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]].

In 2010, The Bertram and Judith Kohl Building opened to provide a new home for the Jazz Studies, Music History, and Music Theory departments. Kohl is connected to Robertson by a third-floor enclosed bridge, which also contains the Sky Bar, named for the iconic Cleveland jazz club that closed in 1954.

The Robertson Building houses around 150 practice rooms, most with windows. In addition, the Otto B. Schoepfle Vocal Arts Center, Career Resource Center, Kulas Organ Center, reed-making rooms, computer labs, faculty studios, and staff offices are located here.

The Conservatory contains the largest collection of [[Steinway &amp; Sons]] pianos, outside of the Steinway factory, in the world.

{{wide image|Oberlin Conservatory Pond.jpg|1000px|Panoramic view of the Conservatory Pond, the social and physical junction between Bibbins and Robertson.}}

==Course structure==
In an interview between [[Frank J. Oteri]] and Timothy Weiss, the coach of the famous contemporary music ensemble "[[eighth blackbird]]," Weiss states "One advantage [of Oberlin] is that there are only undergraduates, and the reason I think this is an advantage is that at ... schools you might name that have a very strong or large population of graduate students is that those students, by their nature, tend to be somewhat more vocationally minded. They are understandably worried about their next step as musicians: How are they going to enter the industry? How are they going to make a living? And because of that, that can trickle down. The nice thing at Oberlin is that they are immensely talented, but they're not really concerned about their future. They might be a little bit, but it's not what occupies their thoughts. They are thinking about music as an art form. They're preoccupied with how they're going to change the artistic culture. And I think that's actually very important."{{citation needed|date=June 2014|reason=When did this interview take place and where was it published?}}

==Programs and departments==
[[File:Warner Concert Hall, Oberlin Conservatory.JPG|400px|thumbnail|right|Warner Concert Hall]]
'''Bachelor of Music Program (BM):'''
Oberlin Conservatory offers private study in 31 applied areas and undergraduate majors, including a double major in piano performance and vocal accompanying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Degrees and Departments|url=https://new.oberlin.edu/conservatory/degrees-and-majors/|publisher=Oberlin Conservatory|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Department of Contemporary Music:''' [[Musical composition|Composition]], [[TIMARA|Technology In Music And Related Arts (TIMARA)]], [[Jazz|Jazz Studies]]
*'''Department of Performance:''' [[Vocals|Vocal Performance]], Instrumental Music Performance - for [[piano]], [[organ (music)|organ]], [[flute]], [[clarinet]], [[oboe]], [[trumpet]], [[trombone]], [[bassoon]], [[French horn]], [[tuba]], [[violin]], [[viola]], [[double bass]], [[cello]], [[harp]], [[percussion instrument|percussion]] and [[guitar]].
*'''Department of Historical Performance:''' [[Historical performance|Historical Techniques]]
*'''Department of Musicology:''' [[Music Theory]], [[Music history|Music History]]

'''Performance Diploma (PDip):'''
This four-semester program, offered only in certain performance departments, is designed for the very small number of gifted performers who have not yet completed the BM or its equivalent and who are seeking a very narrowly focused program of study leading to a performance-oriented career. Performance Diploma students may apply to transfer to the Bachelor of Music program before the end of the program. Students seeking admission to the BM degree must demonstrate skills necessary to complete both the performance and academic coursework required for the BM.  Students who have completed requirements for both the BM and the Performance Diploma will receive only the BM.

'''Master of Music in Conducting (MM):'''
The MM in Conducting is available only as part of five-year programs integrated with an Oberlin Bachelor of Music degree with a major in Performance, Composition, or Music History.

'''Master of Music in Historical Performance (MM):'''
The MM in Performance on Historical Instruments is intended for a limited number of students who have acquired skills on historical instruments and who wish to pursue practical study in performance in combination with the study of performance practice and musicology. Concentrations are offered in harpsichord, fortepiano, organ, Baroque violin, Baroque flute, recorder, Baroque cello/viola da gamba, historical keyboard instruments (harpsichord, fortepiano, and organ, combined), and historical oboes (Baroque, Classical, and other oboes). Students holding an undergraduate degree from another institution will take four semesters to complete the program.  Oberlin undergraduates may audition during their junior year for a five-year program which combines the Bachelor of Music degree in a modern instrument with the MM in an historical instrument.

'''Master of Music in Teaching (MMT):'''
The MMT is a fourteen-month degree program leading to teacher licensure and a master's degree in teaching.  The degree is available in integration with an Oberlin Bachelor of Music degree with a major in Performance or Composition, or after completion of a Bachelor of Music degree in Performance or Composition from an institution other than Oberlin.

'''Artist Diploma (ADip):'''
This four-semester program, offered only in certain performance departments, is intended for a limited number of exceptionally gifted performers who have completed the BM or its equivalent, who have acquired extensive musical background through institutional or private studies or through unusual performing experiences, and who wish to concentrate on private applied study without additional course requirements. Oberlin Conservatory Bachelor of Music graduates may apply to the Artist Diploma program only with the recommendation of the department and approval of the Office of Associate Deans of the Conservatory. Students who enroll in and/or complete the Artist Diploma program may not transfer to the Bachelor of Music degree program.

'''The Double-Degree Program:'''
The Double-Degree Program represents combined Study in the College of Arts and Sciences and the Conservatory of Music. Students accepted to both the College of Arts and Sciences and the Conservatory of Music pursue a degree in each division. Oberlin’s encouragement of such study–in conjunction with an exceptionally broad range of course options–makes Oberlin a uniquely effective environment for the study of both music and the liberal arts.

[[File:Tiger calf Musei Capitolini MC1222.jpg|thumb|Tigress attacking a calf, marble ''opus sectile''  (325–350 AD) from the [[Basilica of Junius Bassus]] on the [[Esquiline Hill]], Rome]]

'''''Opus sectile''''' is an art technique popularized in the ancient and medieval [[Roman world]] where materials were cut and [[inlay|inlaid]] into walls and floors to make a picture or pattern. Common materials were [[marble]], [[nacre|mother of pearl]], and [[glass]]. The materials were cut in thin pieces, polished, then trimmed further according to a chosen pattern. Unlike [[opus tessellatum|tessellated mosaic]] techniques, where the placement of very small uniformly sized pieces forms a picture, ''opus sectile'' pieces are much larger and can be shaped to define large parts of the design.

==Origin==
[[File:Pannelli di giunio basso 03.1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Biga (chariot)|Two-horse chariot]] bearing the presiding [[Roman magistrate|magistrate]] at a ''[[pompa circensis]]'' ("[[ludi circenses|circus]] parade"), from the Basilica of Junius Bassus&lt;ref&gt;Katherine M.D. Dunbabin, "The Victorious Charioteer on Mosaics and Related Monuments," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 86.1 (1982), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Although early examples have been found from [[Egypt]] and [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], the most prominent artifacts remain from 4th century Rome. A large set from the [[Basilica of Junius Bassus]] survived, depicting an elaborate [[chariot]] and other things. The popularity of ''opus sectile'' decoration continued in Rome through the 6th century, and affected areas as far as [[Constantinople]] (now [[Istanbul]] in Turkey).  Particularly remarkable are a series of ''opus sectile'' glass panels, found in a possible sanctuary of Isis at the eastern Corinthian port of Kenchreai, in excavations carried out in the 1960s; they have scenes of famous authors like Homer and Plato, scenes of [[Nilotic landscape]]s, harbour-front cities and geometric panels. Recent work in Jerusalem has recovered enough pieces of floor tile from the Herodian Temple Mount to reconstruct geometric patterns of ''opus sectile'' flooring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-sites-places/temple-at-jerusalem/what-the-temple-mount-floor-looked-like/?mqsc=E3854622 Frankie Snyder, Gabriel Barkay and Zachi Dvira. 2016. ''Biblical Archaeology Review'', November/December.]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Later uses==
[[File:Ca' d'oro, cortile 02.JPG|thumb|upright|Cosmatesque pavement, [[Ca' d'Oro]], Venice]]
Although the technique died in Rome with the decline of the Empire, it continued to be used prominently in [[Byzantium|Byzantine]] churches, primarily in floor designs. From Byzantium it was eventually brought back to [[Sicily]] and the Italian mainland, in the 12th century as the [[Cosmatesque]] style, concentrating on geometric patterns.  There was a major revival from the [[Italian Renaissance]] in the form of [[pietra dura]] work, although this normally consists of much smaller compositions and it is used on furniture, mainly.  Architectural work from later periods tends to be called [[Intarsia]].

In England, the technique was revived in the late 19th century by artists working in the [[Arts and Crafts movement]]. Charles Hardgrave, whose designs were executed by [[James Powell &amp; Sons]] at the Whitefriars Glass Works, was a noted designer in this technique.

The '''portrayal of women scientists in film''' refers to the way that professional women in [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)]] fields are written as film characters. The portrayal of women is a hotly contested talking point in the film community, with feminists saying that women are not accurately depicted in films. Judith Mayne, author and professor of women's studies at [[Ohio State University]], claims that the study of female characters in film began with movements from the 1960s and 1970s in the form of [[second-wave feminism]], the rise of [[independent film]]s, and the beginning of academic [[film studies]].&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Mayne, Judith. “Feminist Film Theory and Criticism.” ''Signs'', vol. 11, no. 1, 1985, pp. 81–100. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/3174288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars offer several different stereotypes that academic women fall under in films. Eva Flicker, professor of sociology specializing in film at the [[University of Vienna]], is a leading scholar on the topic of academic women in film, specifically women in the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.soz.univie.ac.at/en/personnel/members-of-staff/test/eva-flicker-research-uni-wien/|title=Department of Sociology » Eva Flicker Research Uni Wien|website=www.soz.univie.ac.at|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flicker writes that the role of women scientists often reflect that "job stereotypes are combined with gender stereotypes."&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Hüppauf, Bernd-Rüdiger, and Peter Weingart, editors. ''Science Images and Popular Images of the Sciences''. vol. 8, Routledge, 2008, books.google.com/books?id=BE1j7Hs5egcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all scholars believe that objectification is reserved solely for female characters in films. [[Noël Carroll|Nöel Carroll]], professor of philosophy at [[Cornell University]], writes that men are also strategically blocked for the audience's viewing pleasure.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Carroll does not disagree with the notion that women are objectified in film; rather, his stance says that women are not the only ones affected by the erotic gaze of viewers.

== History of Women Scientists in Film ==
'''Gorillas in the Mist (1988)'''

The film [[Gorillas in the Mist]] based on the book by [[Dian Fossey]] appears to show respect for the fact that a [[woman]] would rather work on her career than be a stereotypical housewife.  The story is about the scientist Fossey that leaves the United States to study gorillas in Rwanda and Uganda. As she bonds with the gorillas, she worries about poachers and devotes her time to protecting the animals. Fossey is shown as an independent woman, breaking the common trope of women being the homemaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist Film Theory|last=Thornham|first=Sue|publisher=New York University Press|year=1999|isbn=9780814782446|location=New York|pages=325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jurassic Park (1993)'''

The 1993 film [[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]], based on the novel by [[Michael Crichton]] depicts a [[paleobotanist]], Dr. Ellie Sattler. She is portrayed with great physical ability, allowing her to survive multiple attacks from dinosaurs. She is shown to have extensive knowledge about dinosaurs and plant life throughout the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jurassic Park|last=Crichton|first=Michael|publisher=Ballantine Books|year=1990|isbn=0345370775|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gravity (2013)'''''

The 2013 film ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'', directed by [[Alfonso Cuarón]] and starring [[Sandra Bullock]] and [[George Clooney]], is often heralded as a breakthrough feminist film due to Bullock's starring role. Some who have critiqued the film have written that ''Gravity'' "proves that a woman can anchor an action-packed blockbuster that does ''not'' have to include violence, superheroes, weapons and/or huge death tolls."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/2013/10/22/the-feminist-pull-of-gravity/|title=The Feminist Pull of "Gravity" - Ms. Magazine Blog|date=2013-10-22|work=Ms. Magazine Blog|access-date=2018-06-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the film's lead is a woman, she gets by with help from her male counterpart, played by Clooney. Bullock's character Ryan Stone is described as "the very model of the damsel in distress," as she can never get out of a situation on her own and must lean on Clooney's character to do the heavy lifting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/nov/11/gravity-my-most-overrated-film|title=Gravity: my most overrated film|last=Evans|first=Alan|date=2014-11-11|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of Bullock's character is thought to be an act of defiant feminism, as she is the lead in a science fiction film, but below the surface viewers find that the film actually subscribes to traditional gender stereotypes and does not at all portray Bullock's character as a true independent woman.

== Ways of Analyzing Women in Film ==
In terms of intelligence, women are not often portrayed as equal to men. Eva Flicker writes that in science fiction films, men are overwhelmingly portrayed as scientists, making up 82% of all film scientists.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Flicker, Eva. “Between Brains and Breasts—Women Scientists in Fiction Film: On the Marginalization and Sexualization of Scientific Competence.” ''Public Understanding of Science'', vol. 12, no. 3, 2003, pp. 307–318., doi:10.1177/0963662503123009.&lt;/ref&gt; After reviewing 60 movies, Flicker has placed the women shown in science fiction films into six categories.

=== "The Old Maid" ===
This type of woman scientist is "only interested in her work"&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; and is often depicted having a nondescript appearance and style. As the film progresses, a man saves her and brings out her feminine side, after which she becomes more attractive. However, she loses credibility as an academic and suddenly makes more mistakes than when she did not focus as much on her appearance. Based on this type of story, Flicker concludes that "femininity and intelligence are mutually exclusive characteristics in a woman's film role."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; An example of this woman in a film can be seen in ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|,]] in the character Dr. Constance Peterson.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== "The Male Woman" ===
This type of woman works with men in an all male environment. Because of this, she has a "harsh voice" and occasionally "succumbs to an unhealthy lifestyle," such as partaking in smoking and drinking, to fit in with the boys.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Flicker claims that this type of woman is "lost somewhere in the middle" of masculinity and femininity, meaning she is not as sexual a character as other women are, but she is also not on the same level as the men she works with. This decreases her credibility both as a women and as one trying to fit into "a man's world." In the end, her heightened female emotions allow her to contribute to a solution, which is her redeeming quality as a character.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The "male woman" character appears in the 1970 [[science fiction]] film ''[[The Andromeda Strain (film)|Andromeda Strain]]''.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== "The Naïve Expert" ===
Seen in ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'', this woman scientist does very little. For the sake of the dramatization of the film, she is crucial, but she does not advance the story and does not contribute much to the solution. Instead, her femininity causes more trouble for the team of scientists. She is young, attractive, and subject to experience womanly emotions which add an extra layer to the existing predicament, forcing the man to solve the problem in order to get the team out of trouble. She is "naïve in her actions," messing up every task that is given to her despite her extensive education and knowledge, while her male counterpart stands in stark contrast and ends up saving the day.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== "The Evil Plotter" ===
[[File:Alison Doody 2.jpg|thumb|Alison Doody, who played [[Indiana Jones]]'s attractive female counterpart Dr. Elsa Schneider in ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade''|259x259px]]
The "evil plotter" woman is young and very beautiful, and she uses her feminine charm to trick the men into doing what she wants. She has an ulterior motive, which is on the opposite end of the spectrum from what the rest of the team is trying to accomplish. She is the character that the audience and the other characters despise by the end of the movie because she is devilishly smart and knows how to use her scientific knowledge and sexual prowess for evil.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This bombshell character type was portrayed by [[Alison Doody]] as [[Dr. Elsa Schneider]] in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade|Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade]]''.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== "The Daughter/Assistant" ===
This role of female scientist encompasses many feminine stereotypes portrayed in movies. In this role the woman is subordinate to her male counterpart, who is either her father or her lover. She is smart and capable, but her secondary role does not allow her to demonstrate her abilities. Flicker writes that when this woman plays the role of lover to the male scientist, "her work place is limited to the bed."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; She is only good for sexual satisfaction, not for the degree she earned. The assistant role is seen in the female Dr. Medford in the film [[Them! (1954 film)|''Them!'']], as she is portrayed alongside an older gentleman of the same name.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== "The Lonely Heroine" ===

This type of woman scientist is intelligent, attractive, and somewhat independent. Flicker says that she "has appropriated some male traits," such as losing herself in her work. She is both sexual and smart, and she manages to exhibit both qualities in the film. Despite this, she is still subordinate to the men on her team, and depends on them and their work in order to gain respect. She is the most progressive of the woman scientist types, but she lacks her own form of independence and still must rely on a sexual relationship with a man in order to be seen as someone.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The "lonely heroine" type is best seen in [[Jodie Foster|Jodie Foster']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s portrayal of Elleonore Arroway in the film ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]''.
&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[File:SDCC13 - Gravity panel (9345233475) cropped.png|thumb|Sandra Bullock (center), with director Alfonso Cuarón (right), and producer [[David Heyman]]|195x195px]]

== Female Characters as Objects in Film ==
Flicker argues that women are often pigeonholed into these six limiting roles when written in films. Each of these roles places the female scientist character on the sidelines, and does not allow her to be on the same level as her male counterpart(s). Despite the fact that the women in these roles are educated, and often just as educated as the men on their team, they are used primarily as assistants and sexual characters. Producers strategically write women's roles for the male gaze, often making the female characters use their "weapons of a woman," such as sex appeal, to be attractive to male characters and viewers alike.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;
[[File:Laura Mulvey Fot Mariusz Kubik July 24 2010 03.JPG|thumb|Prominent feminist film theorist Laura Mulvey|227x227px]]
Feminist film theorist [[Laura Mulvey]] writes that in film, women are passive objects of the male gaze.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Mulvey, Laura. “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema.” Film Theory and Criticism : Introductory Readings. Eds. Leo Braudy and Marshall Cohen. New York: Oxford UP, 1999: 833-44.&lt;/ref&gt; Mulvey writes that movies fulfill "a primordial wish for pleasurable looking," and that male audiences are largely catered to in the film industry.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In her analysis of film, she states that the lead woman in a film often falls in love with her male counterpart, and when she does, she only exists as a character to please him. Through the male character's ownership of the woman, the men in the audience find themselves owning her as well.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Male gaze is a big factor to consider when looking at female scientists and how they are portrayed in films. Typically women are viewed as sexual objects for pleasure of males who view these films. This has a direct effect on how people interpret women scientists and their role in movies. Instead of being portrayed as superheroes, they begin to obtain a reputation based on sexual appeal.

Considering superhero films, Amy Shackelford mentions how the [[male gaze]] is applied to hypersexualize the female character, further misinterpreting women in the media through visual depiction. Looking at these particular films, screenwriters have a difficult time accomplishing the task of writing female characters. Shackelford also states that it seems like the only way these screenwriters know how to portray female characters in superhero films power is to hypersexualize them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://everydayfeminism.com/2013/11/female-characters-superhero-films/|title=The Grim Reality of Female Characters in Superhero Films|last=Shackelford|first=Amy|date=November 30, 2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judith Mayne supports Laura Mulvey's view. She writes that "most feminist film theory and criticism of the last decade" has been in written in response to Mulvey's 1975 assessment, "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; She argues that understanding the often sexist portrayal of women in film requires "an understanding of patriarchy as oppressive and as vulnerable."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Mayne goes deeper in her argument claiming that feminist film theory inspired feminist documentaries that are "aimed at rejecting stereotyped images of women."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This criticism also opens the question about "the notion of woman as 'image.'"&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Law professor Sarah Eschholz and her colleagues Jana Bufkin and Jenny Long write that in film, women are often young, and female characters are rarely played by middle aged or older women.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Eschholz, Sarah, et al. “Symbolic Reality Bites: Women And Racial/Ethnic Minorities In Modern Film.” ''Sociological Spectrum'', vol. 22, no. 3, 2002, pp. 299–334., doi:10.1080/02732170290062658.&lt;/ref&gt; Often the only role available to these women is that of the mother, who is not meant to be a leading character. They write that "females' primary societal value is based on physical appearance and youthful beauty."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; According to their assessment, men are valued at all ages, and arguably more so as they age and become wiser. Most women in film are 35 years old or younger, while their male costars are often older.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Despite women in film having impressive credentials and extensive educations, they are often reduced to objects for looking, due to a reluctance to hire an older, less attractive woman for a major role.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In the traditional husband and wife family, women are often portrayed as the second in command. Their husbands take on the role of family head and get to maintain a bachelor level of freedom, which allows them to work and spend time out with the guys. Eschholz, Bufkin, and Long report on studies that show female characters are more likely to be married and have a family than male characters.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Men have the freedom to work and be protagonists through their actions, while their wives or girlfriends are forced to take a back seat in the story in order to care for the family.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Opposing Views ==
Nöel Carroll references Mulvey's pivotal paper on psychoanalysis and visual pleasure in his writing, and plays devil's advocate to her claim that women are the only subjects of gaze. Carroll acknowledges and agrees with Mulvey's assessment that women in film are strategically placed for the male gaze despite the role of their actual character. Carroll states, "Women in Hollywood film are staged and blocked for the purpose of male erotic contemplation and pleasure."&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Carroll, Noël. “The Image of Women in Film: A Defense of a Paradigm.” ''The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'', vol. 48, no. 4, 1990, pp. 349–360. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/431572.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Carroll adds that men in films are also strategically placed for the purpose of pleasure. He cites such examples as [[Sylvester Stallone]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], big bodybuilding actors "whose scenes are blocked and staged precisely to afford spectacles of bulging pectorals and other parts."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Similarly to actresses, male actors are also heralded for their facial attractiveness and are sometimes lauded exclusively for being attractive. As an example, Carroll brings in [[Leslie Howard]], an actor in ''[[Of Human Bondage (1934 film)|Of Human Bondage]]'' and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]],'' who was highly successful in the industry despite being "staggeringly ineffectual."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; According to Carroll, being subject to the erotic gaze of the audience is not an exclusively female burden; rather, both sexes fall prey to Hollywood camera angles that best show off their bodies.

[[Kristin Thompson]], an American film theorist, analyzes the film ''[[Laura (1944 film)|Laura]].'' In her analysis, she claims that the main character, Laura, was written to embody the role of "passive visual object," which Mulvey and Flicker claim is an extremely prevalent role of women in film.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, Thompson, like Carroll, does not believe that this passive role is limited to women in the industry. Thompson claims that Mulvey's assessment stating that women are used as objects and men cannot handle being the subject of gaze is  "common but not universal" in the film industry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/17326947|title=Breaking the glass armor : neoformalist film analysis|last=1950-|first=Thompson, Kristin,|date=1988|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691067244|location=Princeton, N.J.|oclc=17326947}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claims that men are also presented in flashy ways in film, and gives the example of [[Howard Keel]] in the film ''[[Show Boat (1951 film)|Show Boat]].''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her analysis aligns with Carroll's conclusion that both sexes must be the subject of the audience's gaze, and that objectification is all-encompassing.

== Impact of Film Portrayals of Women ==
[[File:Female scientist from DAST.png|thumb|Female scientist drawn in a Draw-a-Scientist Test (Chambers, 1983)]]
Studies have shown that female scientists are either underrepresented or misrepresented as film characters.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; As Eva Flicker writes, film has a way of taking social realities and expressing women in [[:Category:Media formats|media formats]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The media formats then are able to influence the audience by creating a mirror of metaphors, myths, opinions and a social memory resulting in stereotypes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The ways that women scientists are portrayed in films have contributed to viewers holding certain stereotypes of scientists. A 2007 [[meta-analysis]] by Jocelyn Steinke of [[Western Michigan University]] and colleagues looked at gender stereotyping by children who have been exposed to images of scientists through films, television shows, and books.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Steinke, Jocelyn, et al. “Assessing Media Influences on Middle School-Aged Children's Perceptions of Women in Science Using the Draw-A-Scientist Test (DAST).” ''Science Communication'', vol. 29, no. 1, 2007, pp. 35–64., doi:10.1177/1075547007306508.&lt;/ref&gt; One study reported on consisted of elementary school students taking the [[Draw-a-Scientist Test|Draw-a-Scientist-Test]], or [[Draw-a-Scientist Test|DAST]]. The results showed that out of the over 4,000 children who participated in the DAST, only 28 girls drew female scientists.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Another study of 1,137 Korean students between the ages of eleven and fifteen found that 74 percent of them drew male scientists, while only 16 percent had depicted female scientists.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The study includes the result that gender stereotypes can be the product of the environment a person possess and can influence how a person views themselves and others around them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As social media platforms are being used more and more each day by [[adolescence]]s, the reinforcement of cultural norms is at an all time high.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steinke|first=Jocelyn|date=September 2005|title=Cultural Representations of Gender and Science- Portrayals of Female Scientists and Engineers in Popular Films|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1075547005278610|journal=DOI: 10.1177/1075547005278610|volume= 27|pages=27–63|via=Science Communication}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even before young women reach adolescence, social media platforms transform their images of women into the different stereotypes of dependent, emotional and less capable beings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''"Rio Grande"''' is a psychedelic western saga co-written by [[Brian Wilson]] and [[Andy Paley]] and co-produced by Brian Wilson and [[Lenny Waronker]] for [[Brian Wilson (album)|Brian Wilson's first solo album]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morethings.com/music/best_albums_generation_1985-2005.htm The True and Objective List of the Best 100 Albums of This Generation (1985-2005)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Its modular set of movements hearkened back to the style that Brian Wilson used during the "[[Good Vibrations]]"/''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'' era with [[musique concrète]]. "Rio Grande" was evidence that he could still create brilliant, pictorial landscapes of music similar to ''Smile'' whenever he had the freedom, confidence, and courage to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2004/4/2004_4_40.shtml AmericanHeritage.com / Brian Wilson's Wave&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060304235304/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2004/4/2004_4_40.shtml |date=2006-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the longest piece of music in the Brian Wilson catalogue at eight minutes and 12 seconds.

Although it did not contain [[Van Dyke Parks]]' imagery or have the out-of-the-box, ambitious enlightenment of the ''Smile''-era work, it gave ''[[Brian Wilson (album)|Brian Wilson]]'' the progressive relativity of a genuine comeback album. Mostly, "Rio Grande" unmasked a notion of the old Brian Wilson and helped bridge a gap between the original ''Smile'' and the long-awaited, eventual 2004 release of ''[[Smile (Brian Wilson album)|Smile]]''.

==Creation of "Rio Grande"==
Waronker and [[Seymour Stein]], the President of Sire Records, encouraged Wilson to make an impressionistic collage that had made ''Smile'' an interesting listening experience. [[Eugene Landy]] suggested to Brian to make a suite about the development of an individual. However, it was [[Lenny Waronker]] who insinuated to Brian to undertake a more complex, revealing, and provisional composition with an Old West theme &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adriandenning.co.uk/brian.html Brian Wilson | album reviews | adriandenning.co.uk&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by the [[Howard Hawks]] film ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'' and also the movie ''[[Rio Grande (film)|Rio Grande]]''. A Hawaiian theme was also being considered at the time but was dropped in favor of a Western theme. Work on "Rio Grande" began on October 1, 1987, which happened at the same time as a Los Angeles earthquake. A similar concept being worked on during the same period involved "Saturday Morning in the City" and "Saturday Evening in the City" about describing an ordinary Californian suburban weekend but was soon dropped. Early titles before "Rio Grande" was chosen included 'Baby, Child, Adult,' 'Child, Adult, and Parent,' and "Life's Suite." The lyrics of "Life's Suite" (pun intended), written by Landy, were brought in at the last moment and were rejected out of hand by Waronker.

==Relation to ''Smile''==
The idea of "Rio Grande" was conceived as far back as 1970 when Waronker came by Brian's Bellagio mansion with Brian playing him the basic melody of "Cool, Cool Water." {{citation needed|date=July 2017}}Waronker got the notion if he ever got the chance to produce him; he would want a synthesis of the commercial "Good Vibrations" combined with the pacific "Cool, Cool Water" leading to "Rio Grande" years later. {{citation needed|date=July 2017}}Its different "feels" and movements relate specifically to "[[Cabin Essence]]", "Cool, Cool Water", and most of all, "[[Heroes and Villains]]." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=7813 Rio Grande by Brian Wilson Songfacts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The mosaic suite could easily be compared to the Who's "[[A Quick One While He's Away]]" and "Rael" as a mini-rock opera. {{citation needed|date=July 2017}}It also would easily have been perfect for the unrealized Americana theme on the original ''Smile''. {{citation needed|date=July 2017}}The ending of the short snippet of "Walk On By" on the Friends/20/20 two-fer is reminiscent of "Mrs. O'Leary's Cow" which later showed up in the middle of Part C of "Rio Grande" (see below). {{citation needed|date=July 2017}}"Rio Grande" was recorded in sections at different studios across Los Angeles to sound like one cohesive work like earlier ''Smile'' recordings.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Sections==
===Part A: (0:01–0:57 minutes)===
The first part, Part A, starts off with [[Calliope (music)|calliope]]-like music similar to the "[[The Elements (Beach Boys song)|Fire]]" music he had created 20 years before. The Baystate [[Bluegrass music|Bluegrass]] Band contributed to the suite as well as other different groups as stated above. 'Ride 'Em Cowboy' is repeated in a chant similar to his work on ''Smile'' (e.g. "[[You're Welcome]]", "With Me Tonight"). It segues into Part B with a steam engine whistle similar to the ending of "[[Roll Plymouth Rock]]" on the 2004 ''Smile''.

===Part B: (0:58–2:42)===
Part B is the main theme of "Rio Grande" like an old [[cowboy]] song sung by [[Gene Autry]] or [[Roy Rogers]]. It has a riff similar to one from The Beach Boys' "That Same Song." Part B is meta-physical and autobiographical in the sense of the 'river-as-allegory-of-life' idea, and the main character 'would swim the river but can't.' The [[Rio Grande]] also takes him on an adventure or journey like a [[Lewis and Clark]] expedition. It evokes images of [[Lone Ranger]], [[Tom Mix]], and [[Hopalong Cassidy]] as well as other iconic Western figures and makes explicit reference to the [[Cherokee Trail]]. In an earlier version of "Rio Grande", Part B included "Cool, Cool Guy" but was left out in the released version.

===Part C: (2:43–3:56)===
In Part C, the listener is taken to what sounds like a [[campfire]] vignette before being interrupted by a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[rain dance]] followed by thunder and rain. The wordless vocal lines are similar to the "Fire" music from ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]''.

===Part D: (3:57–6:11)===
"Take Me Home" is the name of Part D, in which the music slows down to a dream-like state where the main character is thinking about his girl who on the other side.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodhumorsmile.com/page18.htm Heroes and Villains&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It sounds like a variation of Part B before ending with a vocal segue.

===Part E: (6:12–7:02)===
Part E is the profound "Night Bloomin' Jasmine" section, which was written in 1979. It was one of a short list of songs or pieces by Wilson written in a minor key. An early version was recorded in 1982 with [[Dennis Wilson|brother Dennis]] at the infamous "hamburger sessions" and/or "cocaine sessions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://lovesurroundsme.tripod.com/nightbloomin.html Night Blooming&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The odd 'Get A Job' interlude in the early version was excluded from the final version.

===Part F: (7:03–8:12)===
The music in the last section is a reprise of Part B, bringing the journey full-circle in which the main character experienced one man out in the wilderness against nature, the old west, and the great outdoors. Like the opposites in ''Smile'' such as "Heroes and Villains" and 'Lost &amp; Found' in Cabin Essence,&lt;ref&gt;[http://pages.cthome.net/tobelman/page03.htm The Opposites&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; opposites exist in "Rio Grande." These include: big man against little man, cowboy against Indian, and all men against nature. The opus closes with a thick, heavy drum being slammed.

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Visuel perichole.jpg|thumb|right|Original poster]] --&gt;
The '''Royalty Theatre''' was a small London theatre situated at 73 [[Dean Street]], [[Soho]], which opened in 1840 as Miss Kelly's Theatre and Dramatic School and finally closed to the public in 1938.&lt;ref name=Lloyd&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Royalty.htm Royalty Theatre] at the Arthur Lloyd site accessed 23 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The architect was [[Samuel Beazley]].  The theatre's opening was ill-fated, and it was little used for a decade. It changed its name twice and was used by an opera company, amateur drama companies and for French pieces.

In 1861, it was renamed the '''New Royalty Theatre''', and the next year it was leased by Mrs [[Charles Selby]], who enlarged it from 200 seats to about 650. The theatre continued to change hands frequently. In the 1860s, it featured [[F. C. Burnand]]'s [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] of ''[[Black-Eyed Susan]]'', which ran for nearly 500 nights, and a burlesque by [[W. S. Gilbert]], ''[[The Merry Zingara]]''. The theatre was managed by [[Henrietta Hodson]] during the early 1870s, who also produced mostly burlesques and comedies, including Gilbert's ''[[The Realm of Joy]]'' and ''Ought We to Visit Her?'' On 25 March 1875 the Royalty, under the direction of [[Selina Dolaro]], enjoyed an historic success with ''[[Trial by Jury]]''.

In 1877, [[Kate Santley]] took control of the theatre, running it for nearly 30 years. She had the theatre rebuilt and it reopened in 1883. In this period, it featured opera-bouffes adapted from the French. M. L. Mayer and plays in French. It was increasingly hard for the theatre to compete with larger new London theatres. In 1891, the theatre started a policy of modern drama, presenting plays by [[Ibsen]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]]. When the theatre finally had a great success, with ''[[Charley's Aunt]]'' in 1892, its popularity led to its transference after only a month to a larger theatre. In 1895–96 the theatre underwent another renovation.  [[Arthur Bourchier]]'s ''The Chili Widow'' ran for over 300 nights. In the new century, [[Mrs. Patrick Campbell]] played at the theatre. After another renovation in 1906, [[Sarah Bernhardt]] led her own company in a season. In 1912, ''Milestones'', by [[Arnold Bennett]] and [[Edward Knoblauch]] had over 600 performances. ''[[The Man Who Stayed at Home (1914 play)|The Man Who Stayed at Home]]'' played for 584 performances.

[[The Co-Optimists]] played at the theatre after the war as did [[Noël Coward]]'s ''[[The Vortex]]''. In 1932, ''[[While Parents Sleep]]'' was a hit. The theatre closed in 1938 and was demolished in 1953.

==Origins==
The actress Frances Maria "Fanny" Kelly (1790–1882), used the fortune saved from her highly popular career to establish a dramatic academy with a 200-seat theatre attached.&lt;ref&gt;An earlier theatre, also named the Royalty, existed in Wells Street, [[Wellclose Square]], London from 1787 until the early part of the nineteenth century. See Wilmot-Buxton, Harry John. [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/39265/39265-h/39265-h.htm "William Clarkson Stanfield"], Chapter IX, ''English Painters'', Sampson Low, Marston, Searle &amp; Rivington (1883), accessed 22 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The architect of the theatre was [[Samuel Beazley]]. The theatre and school were completed in 1837.&lt;ref name=Pitt&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=41093 ''The Pitt Estate in Dean Street: The Royalty Theatre''], [[Survey of London]]: volumes 33 and 34: St Anne Soho (1966), pp. 215-21 accessed: 23 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Kelley's engineer friend, [[Rowland Macdonald Stephenson]], persuaded her to build into the theatre new machinery that he had invented to move the stage and scenery; theoretically a significant step forward in theatre technology.&lt;ref name=Ellacott&gt;Ellacott, Vivyan. [http://www.overthefootlights.co.uk/18.pdf "An A-Z Encyclopaedia of London Theatres and Music Halls"], Over the Footlights, accessed 16 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It took more than two years to install the machinery in the theatre. The theatre was "obscurely sited [and] perilously combustible", but it had "a relatively spacious stage, and Beazley's work in the auditorium was thought pretty."&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' described the fashionable little theatre as "most elegantly fitted up and appointed, and painted in a light tasteful manner."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 27 May 1840&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
It turned out that the machinery was too heavy to be worked by people, and Stephenson had to use a horse. On the opening night, 25 May 1840, three pieces were presented: ''Summer and Winter'', by [[Morris Barnett]]; a melodrama, ''The Sergeant's Wife''; and a farce, ''The Midnight Hour''. The opening was unsuccessful, and within a week the theatre was closed. Kelly's high admission charges of five or seven shillings did not help, but the main problem was that the tramping of the horse and the roar of the machinery drowned out the voices of the actors and caused the building to vibrate. The theatre had to be demolished to remove the machinery. After it was rebuilt, Kelly reopened the theatre in February 1841, at reduced prices, for a season of her own monologues, but then became ill.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt; She sought to lease the theatre, but it was empty for long periods and was used mostly for amateur productions, including one of [[Charles Dickens]]'s productions. Within a decade, Kelly had lost her entire fortune and was evicted from the property.&lt;ref name=Ellacott/&gt;

In January 1850 the theatre was reopened as the '''Royal Soho Theatre''', after redecoration by W. W. Deane and S. J. Nicholl, changing its name to the '''New English Opera House''' from November 1850,&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt; and in the following year an entrance portico was built. Various types of productions played at the theatre, including English [[Grand Opera]].  Performances were mostly by amateurs, hiring the theatre at standard rates. At other times, as the '''Theatre Français''', it attracted patrons chiefly among the foreigners in Soho.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt;

In 1861, the direction of the theatre was assumed by Albina di Rhona, a Serbian ballerina and comic actress. She renamed it the '''New Royalty Theatre''', and had it altered and redecorated by "M. Bulot, of Paris, Decorator in Ordinary to his Imperial Majesty, Louis Napoleon", with "cut-glass lustres, painted panels, blue satin draperies and gold mouldings".&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt; In the opening programme, di Rhona danced, the leader of the Boston Brass Band from America played a bugle solo, and a melodrama, ''Atar Gull'', was performed, with a 14-year-old [[Ellen Terry]] in the cast. Still, the reopening was not a success.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt;

In 1862, the theatre was leased by, Mrs [[Charles Selby]], who also ran an acting school. She enlarged the original theatre to accommodate about 650 people. She used it to showcase her pupils and occasionally rented it to others.&lt;ref name=Ellacott/&gt; The theatre continued to change hands frequently.  It was managed, from 1866 to 1870, by [[Martha Cranmer Oliver]], who featured mostly [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]], including [[F. C. Burnand]]'s burlesque of ''[[Black-Eyed Susan]]'', which ran for nearly 500 nights, and a burlesque by [[W. S. Gilbert]], ''[[The Merry Zingara]]''. The theatre was managed by [[Henrietta Hodson]] during the early 1870s. She also produced mostly burlesques and comedies, including Gilbert's ''[[The Realm of Joy]]'' and ''Ought We to Visit her?'' In 1872, it became known as the '''Royalty Theatre''' and retained this name (although it was occasionally known as the New Royalty Theatre).&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt;

On 25 March 1875 the theatre, under the direction of Madame [[Selina Dolaro]], enjoyed an historic success with ''[[Trial by Jury]]'', the first [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] opera produced by [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]]. It premiered together with [[Jacques Offenbach]]'s ''[[La Périchole]]'' and another one-act farce, ''[[Cryptoconchoidsyphonostomata]]''.  Carte soon moved his Gilbert and Sullivan company to another theatre.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt; In January 1876 at the Royalty, [[Pauline Rita]] appeared under Carte's management as Gustave Muller in ''The Duke's Daughter''.&lt;ref name=Whos&gt;Stone, David.

==The Santley years==
In 1877, [[Kate Santley]] "seems to have acquired the head lease." She controlled the theatre for nearly 30 years.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt; Carte joined forces with Santley in January 1877 to present ''Lischen and Fritzen'', [[Jacques Offenbach]]’s ''Orpheus in the Underworld'', and Carte's own operetta, ''Happy Hampstead'' written with his secretary, [[Frank Desprez]]. Later that year, the First Chief Officer of the [[London Fire Brigade]] strongly recommended that the theatre be closed.  Santley had the theatre rebuilt, hiring architect [[Thomas Verity]], who provided additional exits, and it reopened in 1883, with Santley receiving praise for the renovations.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt; Many of the productions in these years were opera-bouffes adapted from the French.  M. L. Mayer, formerly of the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]], staged twice-yearly seasons of plays in French.  The Coquelins and other luminaries of the [[Comédie-Française]] appeared here in the 1880s, when the Royalty was 'the recognized home of the Parisian drama.'&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt; The opening of [[Shaftesbury Avenue]] and of larger new theatres in that neighbourhood, including the [[Lyric Theatre (London)|Lyric Theatre]] and the [[Apollo Theatre]], drew audiences away from the Royalty, and in the 1890s the Royalty was not prospering.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt;

[[File:MrsPatrickCampbell-pre1897.jpg|thumb|left|Mrs. Patrick Campbell]]
In 1891, the theatre started a policy of modern drama. [[Ibsen]]'s ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' premièred, to predictable outrage, at the theatre, in a single private London performance on 13 March 1891. The [[Lord Chamberlain's Office]] censorship was avoided by the formation of a subscription-only [[Independent Theatre Society]], which included [[Thomas Hardy]] and [[Henry James]] among its members.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/lma_learning/theatreland/timelines19.asp#1869 ''Theatreland Timeline'' (London Metropolitan Archives)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101092221/https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/lma_learning/theatreland/timelines19.asp |date=1 November 2007 }} accessed 11 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Again, for the Society, [[George Bernard Shaw]] premièred ''[[Widowers' Houses]]'', his first play, here the following year.&lt;ref name=Glimpse&gt;[http://www.wayneturney.20m.com/independenttheatre.htm ''The Independent Theatre''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206143200/http://wayneturney.20m.com/independenttheatre.htm |date=6 February 2009 }} (A Glimpse of Theatre History), accessed 15 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; When the theatre finally had a great success, with [[Brandon Thomas]]’s play ''[[Charley's Aunt]]'' in 1892, its popularity led to its transference after only a month to the larger [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]].&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt;

In 1895–96 the Royalty's manager was [[Arthur Bourchier]], and the theatre underwent another renovation, by architect [[Walter Emden]].  Bourchier produced, among other plays, ''The Chili Widow'', an adaptation of his own that ran for over 300 nights.  In 1899, the first production of the [[Incorporated Stage Society]] took place with the first performance of Shaw's ''[[You Never Can Tell (play)|You Never Can Tell]]''.  In 1900–01 [[Mrs. Patrick Campbell]] hired the theatre and staged a succession of contemporary plays in which she starred, and in 1903–04 Hans Andresen and Max Behrend presented a successful season of German theatre.  Also in 1904, the newly founded Irish National Theatre Society gave plays by [[W. B. Yeats]] and, in 1905, it presented an early performance of [[John Millington Synge|Synge]]'s first play, ''The Shadow of the Glen''.  In addition, Philip Carr's Mermaid Society produced Elizabethan and Jacobean plays.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt;

==Later years==
Again, the theatre was threatened with closure by the authorities, but Santley had it rebuilt again in 1906 to meet safety requirements.&lt;ref name=Ellacott/&gt; After redecoration in French Regency style, which increased the capacity of the theatre to 657 seats,&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt; the Royalty reopened on 4 January 1906 with a season of Theatre Français directed by Gaston Mayer.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt; [[Sarah Bernhardt]] led her own company in ''La Tosca, Phedre'' and ''La Dame aux Camelias'' in 1907.&lt;ref name=Ellacott/&gt; In 1911, [[J. E. Vedrenne]] and [[Dennis Eadie]] acquired the theatre, and in 1912, they staged ''Milestones'', by [[Arnold Bennett]] and [[Edward Knoblock|Edward Knoblauch]] (later Knoblock), which had over 600 performances.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt; [[Owen Nares]], [[Gladys Cooper]] [[Lynn Fontanne]] appeared at the theatre early in their careers.&lt;ref name=Ellacott/&gt; ''[[The Man Who Stayed at Home (1914 play)|The Man Who Stayed at Home]]'' was a hit at the Royalty in 1914, playing for 584 performances.&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt; [[Henry Daniell]] starred as Bobby Gilmour in ''The Man from Toronto'' at the theatre in May 1918.

A post-war success was the concert-party entertainment, ''The Co-Optimists'', first staged in 1921.  The year 1924 saw the first [[West End Theatre|West End]] production at the theatre of [[Noël Coward]]'s ''The Vortex.'' ''[[Juno and the Paycock]]'' was mounted in 1925, and Ibsen's ''Pillars of Society'' played in 1926.&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt; Another hit for the Royalty was in 1932 with ''While Parents Sleep''.  By 1936 the danger of fire from celluloid stores and other adjacent properties overrided the argument made to the [[Lord Chamberlain]] that the theatre had been on the site before the development of the inflammatory trades nearby. [[J. B. Priestley]]'s ''[[I Have Been Here Before]]'' was the theatre's last success. The last performance was given at a matinee on 25 November 1938, by the Southern Cross Players.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt;

Although several schemes were considered for its rebuilding, but with the growing threat of war, the theatre remained empty and soon became derelict. It was damaged in the [[World War II]] [[The Blitz|Blitz]].&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt;  The Royalty was demolished in 1953 and a block of offices, Royalty House, was erected on the site.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt;

A modern Royalty Theatre was opened in the basement of an office block at Portugal Street near [[Aldwych]] in 1960. This was bought by the London School of Economics and renamed the [[Peacock Theatre]] in 1996. It is a lecture hall by day and a venue for the [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]] company by night.

== Life and career==
Rosofsky was born to  Russian and Polish Jewish immigrants on the West Side of Chicago in 1924.&lt;ref name="”CPS”"&gt;Chicago Public Library. [https://www.chipublib.org/fa-seymour-rosofsky-collection/ Seymour Rosofsky Collection, Biographical Note]. Retrieved November 26, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; He painted from an young age and took weekend classes at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) as a young teen.&lt;ref name="”CPS”" /&gt; After he enrolled there, his studies were interrupted by military service in the Army during World War II from 1943–6; he completed his BFA in 1949 and an MFA in 1951, while also taking humanities courses at the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Northwestern University]].&lt;ref name="Boris" /&gt; At SAIC, Rosofsky studied oil painting with the Russian–born artist [[Boris Anisfeld]], a former student of [[Marc Chagall]], whose disciplined, academic teaching instilled in him an appreciation for art history and classical painting skills.&lt;ref name="Schulze72" /&gt; He exhibited in the seminal, student-driven Momentum Exhibitions of 1948-1950, organized in protest over the exclusion of students from the Art Institute's prestigious "Chicago and Vicinity" shows. He was also featured, along with Campoli, Golub, and Theodore Halkin in the Art Institute’s "Veteran's Exhibition" of 1948.&lt;ref name="Smart" /&gt; In 1958, he received a Fulbright Fellowship to go to Rome; in 1962, a Guggenheim Foundation grant took him and his family to Paris.&lt;ref name="Boris" /&gt;&lt;ref name="”CPS”" /&gt; 

Rosofsky was part of the loose group of artists dubbed the “Monster Roster,” which attracted a degree of international attention in the 1950s as a “Chicago School”&lt;ref name="”Malone55”"&gt;Malone, Patrick T. and Peter Selz. “Is There a New Chicago School?” ''ARTnews'', October 1955, p. 36–9.&lt;/ref&gt; He was part of a 1956 show at Beloit College curated by Allan Frumkin that brought the group into focus, and the later shows, “The New Chicago Decade: 1950–1960” (Lake Forest College, 1959) and “Haut artistes de Chicago” (Paris, 1962).&lt;ref name="Schulze72" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cozzolino" /&gt; Throughout his career, Rosofsky was associated with Chicago’s more international galleries, such as Richard Feigen, Richard Gray, and B.

Rosofsky taught at Chicago Loop College (later [[Harold Washington College]]) from 1964 until his death from a heart attack in 1981.&lt;ref name="Boris" /&gt; He has been cited by many artists, including [[Phyllis Bramson]] and [[William Conger]], as an influence.&lt;ref name="”ArtDaily”"&gt;artdaily.

==Style and themes==
Rosofsky wrestled with his experiences through intensely personal, penetrating, often brutal, imagery created in a staunchly figurative, gestural style that critics likened to June Leaf’s, and described as a mix of expressionism and “surrealist hysteria.”&lt;ref name="Schulze72" /&gt;&lt;ref name=”Miller11”&gt;Miller, Chris.

Retrieved November 26, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Franz Schulze applauded his “rich color, carefully interwoven tonalities and assured drawing.”&lt;ref name=”Miller11” /&gt; The Chicago Tribune’s Alan Artner called his sense of composition masterly, his palette subtle, and his way with the figure strong, but noted a tendency to overload his works that sometimes made them difficult to understand.&lt;ref name=”Artner85” /&gt;

Rosofsky was drawn to doleful and withering themes, such as the individual’s loss of power in modern life, fraught male-female relationships, the abuse of power and the absurdity of war, often borne out in battered, distorted, sometimes grotesquely comic figures in haunting, fantastical interiors and cityscapes.&lt;ref name="Schulze72" /&gt;&lt;ref name=”CPS” /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boris" /&gt; A lifelong Chicagoan, Rosofsky is considered the post-war artist for whom Chicago—the lake, people, buildings, and abrasive character—was most integral, his bizarre figures and settings often bearing a specificity to the city’s locales and conditions.&lt;ref name="Schulze72" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boris" /&gt; Critic Alan Artner described him as a “poet of exhaustion” depicting an urban carnival of malaise, “disappointment and dejection, of things passing away without proper eulogy, of winter and fading light.”&lt;ref name=”Artner85” /&gt;

==Works==
In the 1950s and early 1960s, Rosofsky often focused on nightmarish modern narratives that featured faceless men, often in hospitals, wheelchairs, and other uncomfortable, vulnerable situations or empty spaces, which he depicted in agitated lines that some critics liken to [[Alberto Giacometti]]’s graphic work and [[Francis Bacon]]’s tortured interiors (e.g., ''Patient in a Dentist Chair'', 1961).&lt;ref name="”Smart”"&gt;Smart Museum of Art.

Time spent in Paris on a fellowship led to a greater surrealist turn in Rosofsky’s work, realized in a fantastical, frightening vocabulary of clowns, menacing faces, and bizarre scenarios urgency and a more intense color palette.&lt;ref name="Boris" /&gt;  He often employed these figures in works examining power (e.g., his sardonic depiction of Chicago politics, ''Daley Machine'', 1968) and social issues (''Homage to Spain, Thalidomide Children and Others'', 1965) that in their focus on generalized dehumanization shared more with New York artist George Tooker, than with Rosofsky’s former classmate, Leon Golub’s more political work.&lt;ref name=”Artner85” /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boris" /&gt; By the 1970s, Rosofsky turned to caustic depictions of fraught male-female relationships and roles that portrayed cardboard cutouts or stage puppet-like men and women, enacting disturbing scenes in theatrical domestic scenes, such as ''The Couple'' (1973) or ''The Love Fountain'' (1967).&lt;ref name="Boris" /&gt;&lt;ref name=”Artner85” /&gt; Rosofsky’s last works were lighter and more detached, and included “commedia dell’ arte” drawings commissioned for the 1982 Venice Biennale’s Carnevale del Teatro.&lt;ref name="Boris" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2673">[[Image:David-Robbins-Talent-WEB.jpg|thumb|David Robbins' ''Talent'']]'''''Talent''''' (1986), is a [[photographic]] work by [[David Robbins (artist)|David Robbins]] comprising eighteen photographs that depict [[contemporary artists]] such as [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Jeff Koons]], [[Jenny Holzer]], [[Robert Longo]], and fourteen others using the [[headshot]] portraits long-utilized by the [[entertainment industry]].

To make the 8 x 10, black-and-white photographs Robbins hired the [[James J. Kriegsmann]] studio, a company specializing in headshot photography.  During the several-month long period of making the photographs in Kriegsmann's [[Times Square]] studio in [[New York City]], Robbins functioned as the "agent" for the artists – scheduling the shoots, styling the artists' look, and paying the bill.  The resultant collection of headshots were produced in an edition of 100 as, according to the Kriegsmann Studio, aspiring entertainers seeking work customarily order them.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Susan. "Write When You Get Work," Artscribe International,  September/October, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Talent updated the image of the [[artist]] from that of [[modern art]]'s tortured genius to, instead, a more complex portrayal of a willing participant in the entertainment industry. The piece was instrumental in modernizing the art context for the [[Information Age]].  Visual artists such as [[Degas]] and [[Picasso]] had long depicted [[musicians]], [[harlequin]]s, and [[actors]] using fine art media, and the [[Pop art|Pop]] artists had introduced commercial production techniques such as [[silkscreen]] to create images taken from [[popular culture]], but ''Talent'' collapsed the distance at which visual artists had previously held entertainment culture.&lt;ref&gt;David Robbins, “On Talent,” in Likeness: Artists' Portraits of Artists, CCAC/Wattis Institute, San Francisco; ICA, Boston, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The eighteen artists featured in the piece include Cindy Sherman, Jeff Koons, Jenny Holzer, Robert Longo, [[Allan McCollum]], [[Ashley Bickerton]], [[Michael J. Byron]], [[Thomas Lawson (artist)|Thomas Lawson]], Clegg &amp; Guttmann, Jennifer Bolande, Larry Johnson, Alan Belcher, Peter Nagy, [[Steven Parrino]], [[Joel Otterson]], Robin Weglinski, Gretchen Bender, and David Robbins.

In May 2012 artist [[Michelle Grabner]] curated "25 Years of Talent," an exhibition at Marianne Boesky Gallery, New York, featuring later work from each of the artists included in the original piece.

}}The  '''Producers Council''' ({{lang-en|Producers' association}}), officially known as the '''Tamil Film Producers Council (TFPC)''', is a [[Trade union|union]] for [[film]] producers in the Indian state of [[Tamil Nadu]], based in [[Chennai]]. Formed in 18 July 1979, the group has a charitable trust fund to provide financial support to retired producers, voiced support for film producers and have collectively protested  for socio-political issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tfpc.org/history|title=History – Tamil Film Producers Council|website=tfpc.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elections in the Producers council, which is made up of over 1500 members, are held once every two years to determine the president of the group.

Government has formed a committee to decide on the existence of state's 30% entertainment tax. Its reported that, per day business loss during the strike was around ₹ 20 crores.

In July 2017, TFPC decided to break the exclusivity of them to work only with employees from [[Film Employees Federation of South India|FEFSI]], so they announced that they will be working with both FEFSI members and non-FEFSI members. Though TFPC has signed exclusivity with FEFSI, FEFSI has not signed any exclusivity with TFPC, hence FEFSI members can work with TFPC producers and also with other languages producers and ad film makers. TFPC's another agenda is, to regulate the excessive travel per-diem and the mandatory clauses to employ minimum a certain number of employees from FEFSI to film any particular scene of a movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/tamil/tn-producer-council-vs-fefsi-what-is-happening-and-why-is-it-important-4778370/|title=Tamil Film Producer Council vs FEFSI: What is happening and why is it important?|date=2017-08-02|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2017-08-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/we-wont-give-in-vishal-on-fefsi-strike-actor-invokes-madras-high-court/articleshow/59865384.cms|title=We won't give in, Vishal on FEFSI strike; actor invokes Madras high court - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tapas''', formerly known as '''Tapastic''', is a [[webtoon]] syndicate set up by [[South Korea]]n entrepreneur Chang Kim in October 2012. Operated from both [[Seoul]] and [[San Francisco]] by '''Tapas Media''', Tapastic features a large collection of short-form, English-language webcomics and [[webtoons]] from over 5,000 artists.&lt;ref name=Startup&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2015/04/03/startup-battles-naver-in-english-webtoons/|publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''|title=Startup Battles Naver in English Webtoons|last=Lee|first=Jun-Youb|date=2015-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website aims to create a platform where comic creators can publish their works without cost, describing itself as the "[[YouTube]] of Comics." Since 2016, the Tapas Media's [[mobile app]] also publishes books through a [[freemium]] business model.

==History==
{{quotebox|"We discovered a lot of people still use print publishing, and paid their own money to print comics ... Or people start their own website, in which case you have to build your audience, think about mobile, pay for hosting. It just doesn't really work out."|Chang Kim&lt;ref name=Youtube&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/54294/20150520/youtube-comics-tapastic-creating-new-publishing-opportunities-creators-fans.htm|publisher=''Tech Times''|title=The YouTube Of Comics: How Tapastic Offers New Publishing Opportunities For Creators And Fans|last=Serafino|first=Jason|date=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=30%}}

Chang Kim came up with the idea of starting an open-publishing platform after wondering if there was a singular online location to read all the webcomics he was a fan of. While YouTube users were making money through uploading independent video content, there existed no equivalent for comic creators. Kim also noted that this business model was already successful in South Korea.&lt;ref name=Youtube /&gt; With $3.4 million in backing from both American and Korean investors, including [[Daum Kakao]] and former [[Facebook]] Chief Technology Officer Adam D’Angelo, Kim started up Tapastic in 2012.&lt;ref name=Startup /&gt;

In 2014, Tapastic reached a partnership with [[Daum Communications]], which operates the largest webtoon portal in South Korea. Through this partnership, Tapastic hopes to bring over successful Korean titles to see if they can find success in the United States market. The partnership deal also resulted in $2 million USD of [[Series A round|Series A funding]] for Tapastic.&lt;ref name=Daum&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/28/tapastic-raises-2m-to-build-out-its-youtube-of-webcomics-and-visual-storytelling/|publisher=''[[Tech Crunch]]''|title=Tapastic Raises $2M To Build Out Its YouTube Of Webcomics And Visual Storytelling|last=Etherington|first=Darrell|date=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2014/01/tapastics-ceo-talks-new-partnership-launch-of-like-a-wolf/|publisher=''[[Comic Book Resources]]''|title=Tapastic’s CEO talks new partnership, launch of ‘Like a Wolf’|last=Alverson|first=Brigid|date=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, Tapas Media released a new mobile app, simply titled "Tapas". Using a [[freemium]] business model by offering content to readers for free as an incentive to pay more, the app added [[books]] to its line-up of offered media. According to Tapas Media, around 10&amp;ndash;20% of the books are offered for free, creating a form of [[product sample|sample preview]]. Books are split up into "bite-sized micro chapters" in order to allow people to read portions within a few minutes. The model was inspired by [[free-to-play]] video games, such as ''[[Candy Crush]]''.&lt;ref name=PublishersWeekly&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/Apps/article/69909-e-book-app-applies-gaming-e-commerce-model-to-mobile-reading.html|publisher=''[[Publishers Weekly]]''|title=E-book App Applies Gaming E-Commerce Model To Mobile Reading|last=Gross|first=Anisse|date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 17, 2017, Tapastic announced that it had changed its name to Tapas, redesigning parts of their website in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@Tapas_App/hello-tapas-io-b41cb5f2d1e7|work=[[Medium.com]]|title=Hello, tapas.io|author=Tapas Media|date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tapas Media changed its [[terms of service]] the same day: the addition of a "Right of First Refusal" clause spurred controversy among the service' users. According to this clause, Tapas Media had the right to negotiate and refuse licensing deals for its users. Tapas Media reversed its decision on May 18, 2017 due to poor reception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/05/18/webcomics-publisher-hiveworks-weighs-tapas-right-first-refusal-controversy/|work=[[Bleeding Cool]]|title=Webcomics Publisher Hiveworks Weighs In On Tapas "Right To First Refusal" Controversy|last=Terror|first=Jude|date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In sync with their name change, they have also added several features such as friend codes, which benefits gives the code-owner and the invitee 200 coins, used for unlocking episodes and chapters.

==Content==
At its launch, Tapastic billed itself as the "YouTube of Comics".&lt;ref name=Youtube /&gt; By 2015, the website features a collection of webcomics from over 5,000 unique artists.&lt;ref name=Startup /&gt; Kim stated that [[slice-of-life]]-style webcomics are the most popular on the service, which is likely because of their "shareability" and because they can quickly be read. Kim also noted that webcomics featuring school life and work life are "deeply relatable" to Tapastic readers.&lt;ref name=Youtube /&gt;

The website has formed an interactive community, with fans discussing the comics and some creators asking for fan feedback.&lt;ref name=Youtube /&gt; According to ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', Tapastic had over a million active readers by April 2016, most of which are from North America and 90% of which are under the age of 34.&lt;ref name=PublishersWeekly /&gt; Tapastic allows its content creators to profit from their work by selling premium webcomic series and by receiving [[donations]] in turn of exclusive benefits. Some artists on Tapastic make over $800 USD per month on the service.&lt;ref name=Startup /&gt; Creators on Tapastic are also supported by shared [[online advertisement|ad revenue]].&lt;ref name=Daum /&gt;

Tapastic features a subscription feed similar to that of [[RSS]], which is optimized to be used on the company's mobile app. In contrast, Caitlin Rosberg of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' described using the Tapastic website as a "steep but fast [[learning curve]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/harley-quinn-25-features-breakthrough-dcs-hit-char-232166|publisher=''[[The A.V.

==Exhibition==
The exhibition was curated by art historian Rangihiroa Panoho for the [[Sarjeant Art Gallery]] in [[Whanganui]] in 1990 and the metropolitan City Galleries in Wellington and in Auckland in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abadia|first1=Karina|title=Maori Art Book Takes Inclusive Approach|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/books/69254057/maori-art-book-takes-inclusive-approach|website=Stuff.co.nz|accessdate=20 June 2015|date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's starting point and its iconic motif was a Tahitian tivaevae featuring the Genesis story of the 'Dream of Joseph' or ''Te moemoea no Iotefa''. The exhibition initially filled all spaces of the historic Sarjeant Gallery building, an earlier version of the Wellington City Art Gallery and the entire first floor of the Auckland Art Gallery.&lt;ref name="Moemoea"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Panoho|first1=Rangihiroa|title=Te Moemoea no Iotefa (The dream of Joseph)|date=1990|publisher=Sarjeant Art Gallery|location=Whanganui}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the exhibition catalogue Panoho outlined the South Pacific as, 'Aotearoa's most immediate historical, geographical and cultural context', and that he was seeking to 'examine and explore the visual side of this context and the ways in which artists in this country are exploring it'.&lt;ref name="Moemoea" /&gt; The exhibition brought together four strands of art making:

&lt;blockquote&gt;1. The wealth of material culture from the Pacific Islands found in museums, libraries, private collections - [[taonga]] such as historical writing, photographs, [[tapa cloth|tapa]], tivaevae, weaving and carving.

2. Work currently being produced by Pacific Islanders living in New Zealand such as tivaevae and carving.

3. Work by [[palagi]] artists in this country (e.g. [[Tony Fomison|Fomison]], Shepherd, [[Vivian Lynn|Lynn]], [[Barry Lett Galleries|Lett]], [[Pat Hanly|Hanly]], McMillan, Adams, and Jowitt) which constitutes a response to Pacific Island subject and motif.

4. Work by contemporary Pacific artists utilising a Western aesthetic - to draw on and interpret their particular island cultures.&lt;ref name ='Moemoea'/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The exhibition 'wove together the various aspects of Pacific culture as it persists in Aotearoa'.&lt;ref name ='Paradise'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chiu|first1=Melissa|last2=Stevenson|first2=Karen|last3=Mason|first3=Ngahiraka|last4=Vercoe|first4=Caroline|title=Paradise now? : contemporary art from the Pacific|date=2004|publisher=David Bateman in association with Asia Society|location=Auckland|isbn=1869535847}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|24}} Art historian Nicholas Thomas writes 'Museum artifacts were placed with contemporary art, folk crafts with paintings, archive photographs with contemporary images, and Pacific artists among white appropriators of culture'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Nicholas|title=The Dream of Joseph: Practices of Identity in Pacific Art|journal=The Contemporary Pacific|date=1996|volume=8|issue=2|page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition catalogue contains interviews with 10 contemporary artists included in the show:

*Iosefa Leo
*[[Fatu Feu'u]]
*Jim Vivieaere
*[[Lily Laita]]
*[[John Pule]]
*[[Michel Tuffery]]
*Johnny Peninsula
*[[Ioane Ioane]]
*Sale Jessop
*[[Sopolemalama Filipe Tohi|Filipe Tohi]]

Te Moemoea was also an exploration of Pacificness as it more diversely related to broader creative activity in Aotearoa. As curator Panoho was not exclusively looking at contemporary Pacific art. As with his show 'Whatu Aho Rua' (1989/1992 - another Sarjeant exhibition involving historical and contemporary material) he was also interested in historical Pacific collections of tapa, fibre, photography and carving and in how non-Pacific artists were working with Pacific communities and in how they were interpreting the material and the ideas that they valorised. Te Moemoea while initiated from within a regional institution travelled to and was reinvented by Panoho and gallery staff within the Whanganui, Wellington and Auckland gallery spaces. A newspaper review from Wellington helps clarify the complexity and the layered nature of the content within Te Moemoea: ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Cross-currents crackle around the latest exhibition at Wellington's City Gallery. People who like to keep art in neat pigeonholes... will probably find '''Te Moemoea no Iotefa''' (Joseph's dream defeats them. Rangihīroa Panoho...has curated a lively exhibition which aims to be a lot more than a showcase for artists with a Pacific Island background who are working in New Zealand. It is that, but it's also a visual essay about cross-fertilisation''.' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pihirau.co.nz/maori-curator-ii-future-flowerings/|title=Margot Porter, 'Visual Essays of the Pacific', The Dominion, 20 July 1991|last=|first=|date=|website=Pihirau Productions Ltd|publisher=Pihirau|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''

==Reception and influence==
''Te Moemoea no Iotefa'' has been described as 'the first group exhibition to celebrate the dynamism of Pacific art'.&lt;ref name='Pasifika'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raymond|first1=Rosanna|last2=Salmond|first2=Amiria|title=Pasifika Styles|date=2008|publisher=University of Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology; Otago University Press|location=Cambridge and Dunedin|isbn=0947595155}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|40}}

Pacific art historian Peter Brunt saw '''''Te Moemoea''''' as, ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'The first exhibition to focus on contemporary Pacific art in a civic gallery in New Zealand was Te Moemoea no Iotefa '[the Dream of Joseph: A Celebration of Pacific Art and Taonga]...The exhibition thematized the presence of Pacific culture in New Zealand society, introduced community-based arts like tivaevae into the contemporary gallery, and canvassed the work of migrant artists like Fatu Feu'u, Johnny Penisula, Michel Tuffery and others, only then beginning to garner serious public attention. But it was the title that was the most prescient about its own historical significance. The title was borrowed from the title of a tivaevae it showed, and refers to the biblical story of Joseph sold into slavery in Egypt by his brothers, eventually to rise to a position of power in the Pharoah's court. Joseph's dream turns out to be an allegory of the moment of recognition when, as an exile, he reveals himself to his brothers as the important person he has become. The ambiguity of the allegory lies in the question of whether recognition in Egypt or escape from Egypt (if we can pardon the Orientalism) is the preferable goal''.' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pihirau.co.nz/maori-curator-ii-future-flowerings/|title=Art in Oceania|last=Brunt|first=Peter|date=2012|website=Pihirau Productions Ltd|publisher=Thames and Hudson|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition contributed to a sense of group identification amongst a group of young or emerging artists, including Ioane, Tuffery, Laita and [[John Pule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mallon|first1=Sean|last2=Pereira|first2=Pandora Fulimalo|title=Speaking in colour : conversations with artists of Pacific Island heritage|date=1997|publisher=Te Papa Press|location=Wellington|isbn=0909010447}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|134}}The exhibition is seen as an important precursor to [[Bottled Ocean]], a 1994 exhibition focused on the work of contemporary Pacific artists.&lt;ref name="Oceania" /&gt;{{Rp|432}}

Art historian Karen Stevenson notes the importance of the exhibition in building the careers of participating artists:

&lt;blockquote&gt;With the success of ''Te Moemoea no Iotefa'', Pacific artists found exhibition space more readily available, and as recognition of Pacific artists grew, dealer galleries and community centers became interested in hosting "Pacific" exhibitions. Group "Pacific" shows became regular occurrences in art galleries throughout the country, as did solo exhibitions at dealer galleries."&lt;ref name ='Paradise'/&gt;{{Rp|25}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Teatro Flavio Vespasiano''' is a theater and opera house in [[Rieti]], a city in the [[Lazio]] region of Italy.

==History==
[[File:Teatro Flavio Vespasiano, Rieti - esterno.jpg|thumb|left|Exterior]]
Planning for the theatre began in the early 19th century, but construction did begin until 1883. Named after the Roman emperor [[Vespasian]] who was born near Rieti, the theatre was designed by [[Achille Sfondrini]], the architect responsible for the [[Teatro dell'Opera di Roma|Teatro Costanzi]] in Rome. Its inaugural performance took place on 20 September 1893 with a double bill of Mascagni's ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' and Gounod's ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Casaglia, Gherardo (2005). [http://www.amadeusonline.net/almanacco?r=&amp;alm_sett=&amp;alm_giorno=&amp;alm_mese=&amp;alm_anno=&amp;alm_testo=Teatro+Flavio+Vespasiano "Teatro Flavio Vespasiano"]. ''Almanacco Amadeus''. Retrieved 20 December 2015 {{it}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, an earthquake damaged the structure and destroyed the cupola's frescoes. The building was repaired and the cupola repainted by [[Giulio Rolland]], who depicted a ''Roman Triumph''. The atrium was decorated by [[Antonino Calcagnadoro]] with allegorical theatrical figures. [[Guglielmo Ballester]] depicted an ''Allegory of Music''.

Major restoration works took place from 2005 until 2009.

The structure, known for its good acoustics, is still active in presenting performances.&lt;ref&gt;Comune of Rieti. [http://www.comune.rieti.it/teatro-flavio-vespasiano Teatro Flavio Vespasiano]. Retrieved 20 December 2015 {{it}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Elizabeth of Romania pic.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A royal portrait employing strong mythic overtones: [[Elisabeth of Wied|Queen Elisabeth of Romania]], born a German princess, adopts the national costume of Romania, with distaff and spindle.]]
The theme of '''textiles in mythology and folklore''' is ancient, and its lost mythic lore probably accompanied the early spread of this art.  In traditional societies today, westward of Central Asia and the Iranian plateau, [[weaving]] is a mystery within woman's sphere.  Where men have become the primary weavers in this part of the world, it is possible that they have usurped the archaic role:&lt;ref&gt;Kathy M'Closky, "Trading is a whiter man's game: the appropriation of women's weaving," in Sally Cole and Lynne Phillips, eds., ''Ethnographic Feminisms: Essays in Anthropology'' (Ottawa: Carleton University Press) 1996:97–118&lt;/ref&gt; among the gods, only goddesses are weavers. [[Herodotus]] noted, however, the cultural difference between gender identities and weaving among Hellenes and Egyptians: among Egyptians it was the men who wove.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, 2.35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weaving begins with [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]].  Until the [[spinning wheel]] was invented in the 14th century, all spinning was done with [[distaff]] and [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]]. In English the "distaff side"  indicates relatives through one's mother, and thereby denotes a woman's role in the household economy.  In Scandinavia, the stars of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion's belt]] are known as ''Friggjar rockr'', "Frigg’s distaff".

Textiles have also been associated in several cultures with [[Cultural depictions of spiders|spiders in mythology]].

The spindle, essential to the weaving art, is recognizable as an emblem of security and settled times in a ruler's eighth-century BCE inscription at [[Karatepe]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In those places which were formerly feared, where a man fears... to go on the road, in my days even women walked with spindles"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the adjacent region of North [[Syria]], historian [[Robin Lane Fox]] remarks [[funerary]] [[stelae]] showing men holding cups as if feasting and women seated facing them and holding spindles.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted and noted in Fox, Robin Lane (2008). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NZFM-TUwFxgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Travelling Heroes in the Epic Age of Homer]''. Vintage Books. p. 77. {{ISBN|978-0-679-76386-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Egypt==
In pre-Dynastic Egypt, ''nt'' ([[Neith]]) was already the goddess of weaving (and a mighty aid in war as well). She protected the Red Crown of Lower Egypt before the two kingdoms were merged, and in Dynastic times she was known as the most ancient one, to whom the other gods went for wisdom. Nit is identifiable by her emblems: most often it is the loom's shuttle, with its two recognizable hooks at each end, upon her head.  According to E. A. Wallis Budge (''The Gods of the Egyptians'') the root of the word for ''weaving'' and also for ''being'' are the same: ''nnt''.

==Greece==
In Greece the [[Moirai]] (the "Fates") are the three [[crone]]s who control [[destiny]], and the matter of it is the art of spinning the thread of life on the distaff.  [[Ariadne]], the wife of the god [[Dionysus]] in Minoan Crete,{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} possessed the spun thread that led [[Theseus]] to the center of the [[labyrinth]] and safely out again.

Among the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]]s, the weaver goddess is [[Athena]], who, despite her role, was bested by her acolyte [[Arachne]], who was turned later into a weaving spider.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Athena-Greek-mythology|title=Athena {{!}} Greek mythology|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The daughters of Minyas, [[Alcithoe]], [[Leuconoe]] and their sister, defied [[Dionysus]] and honored Athena in their weaving instead of joining his festival. A woven [[peplos|peplum]], laid upon the knees of the goddess's iconic image, was central to festivals honoring both Athena at Athens, and [[Hera]].

In Homer's legend of the [[Odyssey]], [[Penelope]] the faithful wife of [[Odysseus]] was a weaver, weaving her design for a shroud by day, but unravelling it again at night, to keep her suitors from claiming her during the long years while Odysseus was away; Penelope's weaving is sometimes compared to that of the two weaving enchantresses in the ''Odyssey'', [[Circe]] and [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]]. [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] is at her loom in the ''[[Iliad]]'' to illustrate her discipline, work ethic, and attention to detail.

[[Homer]] dwells upon the supernatural quality of the weaving in the robes of goddesses.

In Roman literature, [[Ovid]] in his ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' (VI, 575–587) recounts the terrible tale of [[Philomela (princess of Athens)|Philomela]], who was raped and her tongue cut out so that she could not tell about her violation, her loom becomes her voice, and the story is told in the design, so that her sister [[Philomela (princess of Athens)|Procne]] may understand and the women may take their revenge.  The understanding in the Philomela myth that pattern and design convey myth and ritual has been of great use to modern mythographers: [[Jane Ellen Harrison]] led the way, interpreting the more permanent patterns of vase-painting, since the patterned textiles had not survived.

==Germanic==
For the [[Norse paganism|Norse]] peoples, [[Frigg]] is a goddess associated with weaving. The Scandinavian "[[Darraðarljoð|Song of the Spear]]", quoted in "[[Njals Saga]]", gives a detailed description of [[Valkyrie]]s as women weaving on a loom, with severed heads for weights, arrows for shuttles, and human gut for the warp, singing an exultant song of carnage. Ritually deposited spindles and loom parts were deposited with the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]] ritual wagon at Dejbjerg, Jutland,&lt;ref&gt;Found in the 1880s; noted by Grigsby, John (2005). ''Beowulf and Grendel: the Truth behind England's Oldest Myth''. Watkins. p. 57, 113f. {{ISBN|1-84293-153-9}}. See discussion of the ritual wagons in Danish bogs in Glob, Peter Vilhelm &amp; [[Rupert Bruce-Mitford|Bruce-Mitford, Rupert]] (transl.) (1988). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=5e0tkA6gGT8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Bog People: Iron-Age Man Preserved]''. New York Review. pp. 166-71. {{ISBN|1-59017-090-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and are to be associated with the wagon-goddess.

In Germanic mythology, [[Holda]] (Frau Holle) and [[Perchta]] (Frau Perchta, Berchta, Bertha) were both known as goddesses who oversaw spinning and weaving. They had many names.

[[Holda]], whose patronage extends outward to control of the weather, and source of women's fertility, and the protector of unborn children, is the patron of spinners, rewarding the industrious and punishing the idle. Holda taught the secret of making [[linen]] from [[flax]]. An account of Holda was collected by the [[Brothers Grimm]], as the [[fairy tale]] "[[Holda|Frau Holda]]". Another of the Grimm tales, "[[Spindle, Shuttle, and Needle]]", which embeds social conditioning in fairy tale with mythic resonances, rewards the industrious spinner with the fulfillment of her mantra:
:''"Spindle, my spindle, haste, haste thee away,''
:''and here to my house bring the wooer, I pray."''

::''"Spindel, Spindel, geh' du aus,''
::''bring den Freier in mein Haus.''"

This tale recounts how the magic spindle, flying out of the girl's hand, flew away, unravelling behind it a thread, which the prince followed, as [[Theseus]] followed the thread of [[Ariadne]], to find what he was seeking: a bride "who is the poorest, and at the same time the richest". He arrives to find her simple village cottage magnificently caparisoned by the magically-aided products of spindle, shuttle and needle.

[[Jacob Grimm]] reported the superstition "if, while riding a horse overland, a man should come upon a woman spinning, then that is a very bad sign; he should turn around and take another way." (''Deutsche Mythologie'' 1835, v3.135)

Also the [[Norns]], female giantesses, weavers of fate, belong in this folklore of weaving.

==Celts==

The goddess [[Brigantia (goddess)|Brigantia]], due to her identification with the Roman [[Minerva]], may have also been considered, along with her other traits, to be a weaving deity.

==French==
Weavers had a repertory of tales: in the 15th century [[Jean d'Arras]], a Northern French storyteller (''[[trouvere]]''), assembled a collection of stories entitled ''Les Évangiles des Quenouilles'' ("Spinners' Tales"). Its [[frame story]] is that these are narrated among a group of ladies at their spinning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mDX2_0Qb03EC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=jean+d%2527arras+Les+%25C3%2589vangiles+des+Quenouilles&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n65ZEKV55V&amp;sig=qhPVWJ1PRk29zltb8KGoqh7jdmY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_0vLPj7XPAhUGOj4KHRxSDDoQ6AEIXTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=jean%2520d'arras%2520Les%2520%25C3%2589vangiles%2520des%2520Quenouilles&amp;f=false|title=The Distaff Gospels: A First Modern English Edition of Les Évangiles des Quenouilles|last=Jeay|first=Madeleine|last2=Garay|first2=Kathleen|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Broadview Press|isbn=9781551115603|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baltic==
In Baltic myth, [[Saulė|Saule]] is the life-affirming sun goddess, whose numinous presence is signed by a wheel or a rosette. She spins the sunbeams. The Baltic connection between the sun and spinning is as old as spindles of the sun-stone, amber, that have been uncovered in burial mounds. Baltic legends as told have absorbed many images from Christianity and Greek myth that are not easy to disentangle.

==Finnish==
The Finnish epic, the ''[[Kalevala]]'', has many references to spinning and weaving goddesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Kalevala|title=Kalevala {{!}} Finnish literature|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hunterian Psalter c. 1170 Eve spinning.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Eve spinning, from the [[Hunterian Psalter]], English, ca 1170]]

==Later European folklore==
"When Adam delved and Eve span..." runs the rhyme; though the tradition that [[Eve]] [[spinning (textiles)|span]] is unattested in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], it was deeply engrained in the medieval Christian vision of Eve. In an [[illuminated manuscript|illumination]] from the 13th-century [[Hunterian Psalter]] (''illustration. left'') Eve is shown with distaff and spindle.

In later European folklore, weaving retained its connection with magic.  [[Mother Goose]], traditional teller of [[fairy tale]]s, is often associated with spinning.&lt;ref&gt;Tatar, Maria (1987). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=lTtMH_ezI4UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales]''. p. 114. {{ISBN|0-691-06722-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was known as "Goose-Footed Bertha" or ''Reine Pédauque'' ("Goose-footed Queen") in French legends as spinning incredible tales that enraptured children.

The daughter who, her father claimed, could spin straw into gold and was forced to demonstrate her talent, aided by the dangerous earth-daemon [[Rumpelstiltskin]] was an old tale when the [[Brothers Grimm]] collected it.  Similarly, the unwilling spinner of the tale ''[[The Three Spinners]]'' is aided by three mysterious old women.  In ''[[The Six Swans]]'', the heroine spins and weaves [[starwort]] in order to free her brothers from a shapeshifting curse.  ''[[Spindle, Shuttle, and Needle]]'' are enchanted and bring the prince to marry the poor heroine.  [[Sleeping Beauty]], in all her forms, pricks her finger on a spindle, and the curse falls on her.&lt;ref&gt;Tatar, Maria (1987). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=lTtMH_ezI4UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales]''. pp. 115–8, {{ISBN|0-691-06722-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Holman-Hunt, William, and Hughes, Edward Robert - The Lady of Shalott - 1905.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Lady of Shallott'' by [[William Holman Hunt]], painted from 1888 to 1902]]
In [[Alfred Tennyson]]'s poem "[[The Lady of Shalott]]", her woven representations of the world have protected and entrapped [[Elaine of Astolat]], whose first encounter with reality outside proves mortal. [[William Holman Hunt]]'s painting from the poem (''illustration, right'') contrasts the completely pattern-woven interior with the sunlit world reflected in the roundel mirror. On the wall, woven representations of Myth ("[[Hesperides]]") and Religion ("Prayer") echo the mirror's open roundel; the tense and conflicted Lady of Shalott stands imprisoned within the brass roundel of her loom, while outside the passing knight sings "'Tirra lirra' by the river" as in Tennyson's poem.

A high-born woman sent as a hostage-wife to a foreign king was repeatedly given the epithet "weaver of peace", linking the woman's art and the familiar role of a woman as a dynastic pawn. A familiar occurrence of the phrase is in the early English poem ''[[Widsith]]'', who "had in the first instance gone with Ealhild, the beloved weaver of peace, from the east out of Anglen to the home of the king of the glorious Goths, Eormanric, the cruel troth-breaker..."

==Inca==
In [[Inca mythology]], [[Mama Ocllo]] first taught women the art of spinning thread.

==China==
{{See also|The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl}}

*In [[Tang Dynasty]] [[China]], the goddess weaver floated down on a shaft of moonlight with her two attendants.  She showed the upright court official ''Guo Han'' in his garden that a goddess's robe is seamless, for it is woven without the use of needle and thread, entirely on the loom. The phrase "a goddess's robe is seamless" passed into an idiom to express perfect workmanship.  This idiom is also used to mean a perfect, comprehensive plan.
*The Goddess Weaver, daughter of the [[Queen Mother of the West|Celestial Queen Mother]] and [[Jade Emperor]], wove the [[stars]] and their light, known as "[[the Silver River]]" (what Westerners call "[[Milky Way|The Milky Way]] Galaxy"), for heaven and earth.  She was identified with the [[star]] Westerners know as [[Vega]].  In a 4,000-year-old legend, she came down from the Celestial Court and fell in love with the mortal Buffalo Boy (or Cowherd), (associated with the star [[Altair]]).  The Celestial Queen Mother was jealous and separated the lovers, but the Goddess Weaver stopped weaving the Silver River, which threatened heaven and earth with darkness.  The lovers were separated, but are able to meet once a year, on the seventh day of the seventh moon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=unM5hd_V13MC&amp;pg=PA429&amp;lpg=PA429&amp;dq=Chinese+Goddess-Weaver&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Qnzhq4U4Pp&amp;sig=f6LtsUkqci3qb-sBMyEqmA2CKcU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lAPvSu2sJomoMa7BsIQM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Chinese%20Goddess-Weaver&amp;f=false Jung Chang, ''Wild Swans: Three Daughters of China''], New York: Touchstone, 2003, reprint, GlobalFlair, 1991, p. 429, accessed 2 Nov 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japan==
* The Japanese folktale ''[[Tsuru no Ongaeshi]]'' features a weaving theme.  A crane, rescued by a childless elderly couple, appears to them in the guise of a girl who cares for them out of gratitude for their kindness and is adopted as their daughter.  She secretly begins weaving stunningly beautiful cloth for the couple to sell under the condition that they may not see her weave.  Though the couple initially comply, they are overcome with curiosity and find the girl is the crane who has been weaving the cloth from her own feathers, leaving her in a pitiful state.  With her identity discovered, she must leave the remorseful couple.  A variation of the story replaces the elderly couple with a man, who marries the crane when she takes on the form of a young woman.

[[File:The Falling Man.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''The Falling Man'']]

'''''The Falling Man''''' is a photograph taken by [[Associated Press]] photographer [[Richard Drew (photographer)|Richard Drew]] of a man falling from the [[One World Trade Center|North Tower]] of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] at 9:41:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. during the [[September 11 attacks]] in [[New York City]]. The subject of the image, whose identity remains uncertain, was one of the people trapped on the upper floors of the skyscraper who either fell searching for safety or jumped to escape the fire and smoke.

The photograph gives the impression that the man is falling straight down; however, a series of photographs taken of his fall showed him to be tumbling through the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/photographer-behind-9-11-falling-man-retraces-steps-recalls-unknown-soldier.html|title=Photographer behind 9/11 "Falling Man" retraces steps, recalls "unknown soldier"|first=Joe|last=Pompeo|date=August 29, 2011|publisher=''[[Yahoo! News]]''|accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The photographer has noted that, in at least two cases, newspaper stories commenting on the image have attracted a barrage of criticism from readers who found the image "disturbing.”&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Peter (2001).

==Background==
Of the nearly 3,000 people killed on 9/11, at least 200 people are believed to have fallen or jumped to their deaths, while other estimates say the number is half of that or fewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/10/nyregion/10jumpers.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first1=Kevin | last1=Flynn | first2=Jim | last2=Dwyer | title=Falling Bodies, a 9/11 Image Etched in Pain | date=September 10, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Whitworth |first=Melissa |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/september-11-attacks/8737671/911-Jumpers-from-the-World-Trade-Center-still-provoke-impassioned-debate.html |title=9/11: 'Jumpers' from the World Trade Center still provoke impassioned debate |publisher=Telegraph |date= September 3, 2011|accessdate=December 13, 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;Cauchon, Dennis.

''[[USA Today]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Officials could not recover or identify the bodies of those forced out of the buildings prior to the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|collapse of the towers]]. All deaths in the attacks except those of [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|the hijackers]] were ruled to be homicides due to [[blunt trauma]] (as opposed to suicides).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Leonard|first=Tom|title=The 9/11 victims America wants to forget: The 200 jumpers who flung themselves from the Twin Towers who have been 'airbrushed from history'|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2035720/9-11-jumpers-America-wants-forget-victims-fell-Twin-Towers.html|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=September 9, 2013|location=London|date=September 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Office of Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York|New York City medical examiner's office]] said it does not classify the people who fell to their deaths on September 11 as "[[jumper (suicide)|jumpers]]". According to Ellen Borakove, the examiner's office spokeswoman, "A 'jumper' is somebody who goes to the office in the morning knowing that they will commit suicide. These people were forced out by the smoke and flames or blown out."&lt;ref name=usatoday /&gt;

==Publication history==
The photograph initially appeared in newspapers around the world, including on page 7 of ''[[The New York Times]]'' on September 12, 2001. The photo's caption read, "A person falls headfirst after jumping from the north tower of the World Trade Center. It was a horrific sight that was repeated in the moments after the planes struck the towers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mills|title=Images of Terror|journal=Dissent|year=2009|pages=75–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appeared only once in the ''Times'' because of criticism and anger against its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/news/9-11/10th-anniversary/jumpers/ |title=The Encyclopedia of 9/11: Jumpers: Why the most haunting images of 2001 were hardly ever seen. |date=August 27, 2011 |publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |author=Susie Linfield}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six years later, it appeared on page 1 of ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' on May 27, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boutin |first=Maurice |editor=Arvin Sharma |year=2009 |chapter=The Current State of the Individual: A Meditation on "The Falling Man" |title=The World's Religions after September 11 |pages=3–9 |isbn=0-275-99621-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The identity of the subject of the man has never been officially confirmed. The large number of people trapped in the tower has made identifying the man in the 12 photos difficult. It is thought, though the number is uncertain, that at least 200 people fell to their deaths.&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt;

Reporter [[Peter Cheney]]  suggested in the nationally distributed Canadian newspaper ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' that the man pictured in the photo may have been Norberto Hernandez, a [[pastry chef]] at [[Windows on the World]], a restaurant located on the 106th floor of the [[List of tenants in One World Trade Center|North Tower]]. Some members of Hernandez's family agreed with Cheney,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/incoming/the-life-and-death-of-norberto-hernandez/article4153194/|title=The life and death of Norberto Hernandez |first=Peter |last=Cheney |date=September 22, 2001 |publisher="[[The Globe and Mail]]"|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after examining the entire photo sequence and noting details of his clothing, were no longer convinced.&lt;ref name="JunodEsquire"&gt;{{cite web |last=Junod |first=Tom |publisher= Esquire Magazine| year=2003 |url=http://www.esquire.com/features/ESQ0903-SEP_FALLINGMAN |title=The Falling Man }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jonathan Eric Briley===
"The Falling Man", an article about the photograph by American journalist [[Tom Junod]], was published in the September 2003 issue of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine. It was adapted into a documentary film by the same name. The article gave the possible identity of the falling man as Jonathan Briley, a 43-year-old audio technician for Windows on the World. Briley, a resident of [[Mount Vernon, New York]], was a [[sound engineer]]. His brother [[Alex Briley|Alex]] is an original member of the 1970s [[disco]] group [[Village People]]. Briley had [[asthma]] and would have known he was in danger when smoke began to pour into the restaurant.&lt;ref name="JunodEsquire"/&gt;

[[Michael Lomonaco]], the Executive Chef/Director at Windows on the World, also suggested that the man was Briley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/memorial/people/2023.html|title=Jonathan Briley|work=September 11: A Memorial|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Briley was initially identified by his brother, Timothy.&lt;ref name="JunodEsquire" /&gt; Lomonaco could identify Briley by his clothes and his body type. In one of the pictures, the Falling Man's shirt or white jacket was blown open and up, revealing an orange t-shirt similar to one shirt that Briley often wore. Briley's older sister, Gwendolyn, originally helped in identifying the victim. She told reporters of ''[[Daily Mirror|The Sunday Mirror]]'', "When I first looked at the picture [...] and I saw it was a man—tall, slim—I said, 'If I didn't know any better, that could be Jonathan.{{' "}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/911-the-image-of-the-falling-man-that-still-152974|title=9/11: The image of The Falling Man that still haunts 10 years on|accessdate=May 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
''9/11: The Falling Man'' is a 2006 [[documentary film]] about the picture and the story behind it. It was made by American filmmaker [[Henry Singer]] and filmed by Richard Numeroff, a New York-based director of photography. The film is loosely based on Junod's ''Esquire'' story. It also drew its material from photographer [[Lyle Owerko]]'s pictures of falling people. It debuted on March 16, 2006, on the [[United Kingdom|British]] television network [[Channel 4]]. It later made its [[North America]]n premiere on [[Canada]]'s [[CBC Newsworld]] on September 6, 2006, and has been broadcast in more than 30 countries. The U.S. premiere was September 10, 2007, on the [[Discovery Times|Discovery Times Channel]].

The novel ''[[Falling Man (novel)|Falling Man]]'', by [[Don DeLillo]], is about the September 11 attacks. The "falling man" in the novel is a performance artist recreating the events of the photograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Matthew J. Morgan |last=Versluys |first=Kristiaan |chapter=9/11 in the Novel |title=The Impact of 9/11 on the Media, Arts, and Entertainment: The Day that Changed Everything? |volume=4 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |pages=142–143 |isbn=978-0-230-60841-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeLillo says he was unfamiliar with the title of the picture when he named his book. The artist straps himself into a harness and jumps from an elevated structure in a high visibility area (such as a highway overpass), hanging in the pose of ''The Falling Man''.

'''The Tale of the Shifty Lad, the Widow's Son''' is a Scottish [[fairy tale]] collected by [[John Francis Campbell]] in ''[[Popular Tales of the West Highlands]]''. [[Andrew Lang]] included it, as '''The Shifty Lad''' in ''[[The Lilac Fairy Book]]''.

==Synopsis==
{{plot|date=January 2013}}
A widow wanted her son to learn a trade. He insisted that he wanted to be a thief. She predicted he would end up hanging from a bridge.  One day he did not go to church, and told her that the first trade she heard when she came out would be his. He came to the path and shouted "Thievery" in a disguised voice. She again predicted he would hang from the bridge but gave him to the Black Gallows Bird to learn the trade. The man taught him, and then said they must rob a man who had sold his cattle. On Halloween, they hid in the loft. The shifty lad went down and stirred up the cattle, sending people out; while they were gone, he stole nuts and sewed a leather hide to the thief. He cracked nuts, though the thief warned him he would be heard. He was heard, and the people came, and the thief ran off with the hide still attached. The people said he was stealing the hide and chased him. The Shifty Lad stole the gold and silver while they were gone, and brought them to the thief; they split them.  

Soon, a tenant sent a man to get a wether to give as a wedding gift. The Shifty Lad bet his master that he could steal it from the man's back. When he was coming, the lad put a dirty shoe in his path; the man said that if he had the other one, he would clean this one and have a pair. The Shifty Lad ran ahead of his, and put the shoe in the way again. The man went back to get the other, and the lad took the wether and the shoes and won his bet.  The tenant sent the same man after a kid. The lad bleated like the wether, and when the man searched for it, thinking to come back with both, the lad stole the kid. The third time, the tenant directed him to never let the wether go, and so he brought it home.

The shifty lad had his master hang him, and let him down when he kicked his legs. He praised it, and his master let him hang him, but the lad killed him. His wife was angry, and the lad fled. He took service with a wright who lived next to the king's storehouse, and broke into it to steal. The gifts persuaded the wright and his wife to let him. At the advice of the Seanagal, the king set a hogshead of pitch to catch the thief, and it caught the wright. The lad cut off his head to prevent their learning who he was.

The king displayed the body to discover who grieved at the sight, but when the wright's wife cried out, he cut his foot and pretended she cried over that. Then the body was hung from a tree for the same reason. The lad took a horse with casks of whiskey by them, as if he were hiding from the soldiers. They chased him, and he fled, leaving the horse. They took it back, found the whiskey, and became drunk. The lad took the body. The king sent a black pig about to dig up the body. When it rooted about the wright's house, the lad sent the soldiers inside to eat and drink while it searched. He killed the pig and buried it while they ate. The king sent men to discover where people had pig's flesh they could not account for; the lad killed the soldiers sent to his house, and then started a rumor that the soldiers meant to massacre them, so all the people killed the soldiers.  

The Seanagal advised to give a ball, since the man would be the boldest and dance with the princess; when the lad did so, the Seanagal marked him with a black dot, but the lad saw it and marked the Seanagal himself with two and twenty other men with one. The king decided that he was beaten, and that he wanted so clever a man for his son-in-law. He had all the men with the black dots put in a room, and had a child give one an apple. The lad drew him with a shaving and a drone, and the child gave him the apple. They took the shaving and drone, but the child remembered them and still gave him the apple, so the shifty lad married the princess.  

One day, while they walked on the bridge, the lad told the princess that his mother said he would hang from that bridge. She said that if he wished to go over the wall, she would hold him by her handkerchief. He did, and hanged there, but a cry went up about a fire, startling the princess. She let go. The lad fell and died.

'''Urban art''' is a style of art that relates to cities and city life often done by artists who live in or have a passion for city life. In that way urban art combines [[street art]] and [[graffiti]] and is often used to summarize all [[visual art]] forms arising in [[urban area]]s, being inspired by urban architecture or present urban lifestyle. Because the urban arts are characterized by existing in the public space, they are often viewed as [[vandalism]] and destruction of private property.

Although urban art started at the neighborhood level, where a lot of people of different cultures live together, it is an international art form with an unlimited number of uses nowadays. Many urban artists travel from city to city and have social contacts all over the world. The notion of 'Urban Art' developed from street art which is primarily concerned with [[graffiti]] culture. Urban art represents a broader cross-section of artists that, in addition to covering traditional street artists working in formal gallery spaces, also cover artists using more traditional media but with a subject matter that deals with contemporary urban culture and political issues. In Paris, [[Le Mur (urban art)|Le Mur]] is a [[Public art|public]] museum of urban art.

== In the mainstream ==
Though starting as an underground movement, urban artists like [[Banksy]] and [[Adam Neate]] have now gained mainstream status and have, in turn, propelled the urban art scene into popular culture. Perceptions have started to change as urban movements such as graffiti slowly gain acceptance from the public. A confirmation of street art's new mainstream status can be, in part, confirmed by an invitation from the [[Tate]] calling upon artists to create outdoor pieces on the Thames side of the gallery in the summer of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2008/apr/08/streetartattate|title=Street Art is Officially Mainstream|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band [[Gorillaz]] uses an urban art style to promote their band. The band members are animated in a [[graffiti]] style.

'''''World Tales''''', subtitled "'''The Extraordinary Coincidence of Stories Told in All Times, in All Places'''" is a book of 65 [[Fairy tale|folk tales]] collected by [[Idries Shah]] from around the world, mostly from literary sources. Some of the tales are very current, others are less well known.

==Content==
Each story is preceded by a short introduction by the author, giving a brief history of the tale's literary mutations, or remarking on the strange similarities that versions exhibit across great geographical or historical distances.&lt;ref&gt;For example, asking, with reference to the story of [[Childe Rowland]]: "How can it be that the same story is found in Scotland and also in pre-Columbian America?"&lt;/ref&gt; The collection has had a broad appeal. For instance Canadian poet [[P. K. Page]] cited it as the book she would give to a child,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/writersandcompany/98readings.html|title=Home - Writers &amp; Company with Eleanor Wachtel - CBC Radio|date=12 January 2016|website=Cbc.ca|accessdate=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and author and storyteller [[Norah Dooley]]:&lt;ref name="NorahDolley"&gt;{{cite web

Whilst Shah mentions many of the ancient and modern interpretations that have been placed on the tales, along with some of the theories of [[Fairy tale#Cross-cultural transmission|cross-cultural transmission]], he himself interprets them little, writing in the introduction: 
{{cquote| Working for thirty-five years among the written and oral sources of our world heritage in tales, one feels a truly living element in them which is startlingly evident when one isolates the 'basic' stories: the ones which tend to have travelled furthest, to have featured in the largest number of classical collections, to have inspired great writers of the past and present.}} 
The value that Shah put on folklore of this kind is clear, not only from the many volumes of tales that he published but also from books published by his children. The title alone of one of his daughter [[Saira Shah]]'s books, ''The Storyteller's Daughter'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Shah
  | first = Saira
  | title = The Storyteller's Daughter
  | publisher = Penguin Books Ltd
  | year = 2004
  | isbn =  0-14-101026-6 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; gives some indication, while his son [[Tahir Shah]]'s book ''[[In Arabian Nights]]'', itself an exploration of the power of the folktale, recalls:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Shah
  | first = Tahir

&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|When my father died a decade ago, I inherited his library. There were five reinforced boxes of books labeled "STORIES: VALUABLE, HANDLE WITH CARE". Among them were [[Aesop's Fables|Aesop's ''Fables'']], [[Hans Christian Andersen]], and the [[Brothers Grimm]]. There were many others too, the Arab collections and volumes of tales from every corner of the world... }}

==Original illustrated edition==

The book was first published in large format by [[Harcourt Brace Jovanovich]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; with each tale illustrated. Originally Shah asked [[Ivan Tyrrell]] to find illustrations for the tales by the likes of [[Arthur Rackham]], [[Kay Nielsen]] and [[Edmund Dulac]]. Tyrrell instead suggested commissioning new work, Shah agreed to this and the idea was put to, and approved by, the publisher, [[William Jovanovich]].&lt;ref name="listening"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tyrrell|first1=Ivan|title=Listening to Idries Shah|date=2016|publisher=Human Givens Publishing|isbn=978-1899398089|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty seven artists&lt;ref&gt;David Aicken, Wayne Anderson, Philip Argent, [[Peter Brookes]], Fred Carver, Doranna, Roy Ellsworth, Brian Froud, Tim Gill, Peter Goodfellow, Melvyn Grant, Lynda Gray, Colin Hadley, Ivan Hissey, Ken Laidlaw, Roger Langton, Carol Lawson, Janina Lech, [[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]], James Marsh, Chris McEwan, Tony Meeuwissen, Martin Newton, David O'Connor, Joe Petagno, Sue Porter, Peter Richardson, Carolyn Scrace, Caroline Smith, Mike Terry, [[Alan Tunbridge]], [[Ivan Tyrrell]], George Underwood, Malcolm Walker, Mai Watts, Juan Wijngaard and Ray Winder&lt;/ref&gt; contributed. This edition is no longer in print; the [[Octagon Press]] edition is text only.

Agnes Perkins, writing in the ''[[Children's Literature Association Quarterly]]'' cited this "lavish" edition of ''World Tales'' as an example of books that bridge the gap between illustrated books of folktales published for the juvenile market which pay little attention to sources or to authenticity of tone and language and which supply none of the working tools developed for folklore scholarship which might lead readers to further study of tales from the oral tradition, and collections by folklorists concerned primarily with local variants and the unusual persistence of motifs which ignore questions of the value of the stories from a literary standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Agnes Perkins|year= 1981|title= Folklore and Children's Books: Bridging the Gap|journal= [[Children's Literature Association Quarterly]]  |volume= 6|issue= 2|pages= 1–37 |doi=10.1353/chq.0.1667}}&lt;/ref&gt;
