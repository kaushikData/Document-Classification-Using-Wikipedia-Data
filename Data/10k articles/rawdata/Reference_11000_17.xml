      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3650">[[File:Hunter Museum Label.jpg|thumb|Every object in galleries has a label where you'll find that object's accession number. ]]
In [[library|libraries]], [[art gallery|art galleries]], [[museum]]s and [[archive]]s, an '''accession number''' is a unique identifier assigned to, and achieving initial control of, each acquisition. Assignment of accession numbers typically occurs at the point of accessioning or cataloging.  The term is something of a misnomer, because the form accession numbers take is often alpha-numeric.&lt;ref name="Witt"&gt;Witt, B.S., Whittfield, J.C., Stepansky, A.J. (2012) ''Pastperfect software for museum collections: Version 5 users guide.'' Retrieved from http://museumsoftware.com/v5userguide.html&lt;/ref&gt;

If an item is removed from the collection, its number is usually not reused for new items.

In libraries, this numbering system is usually in addition to the [[library classification]] number (or alphanumeric code) and to the [[ISBN]] or International Standard Book Number assigned by [[publisher]]s.

Accession numbers are also used in [[botany]], by institutions with living collections like [[arboretum|arboreta]], [[botanic garden]]s, etc., to identify plants or groups of plants that are of the same [[taxon]], are of the same [[Propagule|propagule type]] (or treatment), were received from the same source, were received at the same time.&lt;ref name="Glasnevin"&gt;Jebb, Matthew (1998) ''Cataloguing and Record keeping for Plant Collections'' Retrieved from http://www.botanicgardens.ie/educ/accnosho.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbarium|Herbaria]] and other botanic institutions collecting non living material also use accession numbers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

An accession number may include the year acquired, sometimes the full date (as at the [[British Museum]]), and a sequential number separated by a period.&lt;ref name="Witt" /&gt; In addition, departments or art classifications within the collection or museum may reserve sections of numbers. For example, objects identified by the numbers 11.000 through 11.999 may indicate objects obtained by the museum in 1911; the first 300 numbers might be used to indicate American art, while the next fifty (11.301–350) might be used for [[African art]]. In some cases, they also include letters and other punctuation, such as commas, hyphens or slashes.&lt;ref&gt;Reitz, J.M. (2004) ''Dictionary for library and information science.'' Libraries Unlimited. p.&amp;nbsp;6&lt;/ref&gt;

In older institutions, simpler numbering systems are sometimes maintained alongside, or incorporated within, newer systems.  Where the objects are unique, institutions normally need to retain the original number in some form as it will have been used in old references that are still of use in scholarship.  In particular, collections of [[manuscripts]] use the prefix "MS", and many well known manuscripts are known by their old MS numbers, often incorporating a prefix for a particular collection within a library.  These collections may be divided by former owners, as with several [[British Library]] [[:Category:British Library collections|"closed" collections]], or by language, as with [[Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse (BnF Fr 2643-6)|Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse (BnF MS Fr. 2643-6)]], indicating a two volume manuscript in French at the {{lang|fr|[[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]}}.

'''Shihab al-Din abu 'l-Abbas Ahmad ben Ali ben Ahmad Abd Allah al-Qalqashandi [[Banu Fazara|al-Fazari]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=al-Ḳalḳas̲h̲andī |url=https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/al-kalkashandi-SIM_3832 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;''' (1355 or 1356 &amp;ndash; 1418) was a medieval [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] writer and [[Islamic mathematics|mathematician]].

Born in a village in the [[Nile Delta]], al-Qalqashandi was scribe of the scroll (''katib al-darj'') in the [[Mamluk]] chancery in [[Cairo]]. He is the author of ''Subh al-a 'sha'', completed in fourteen volumes in 1412, "one of the final expressions of the genre of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] administrative literature".&lt;ref name="AllenDeYoung2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maaike van Berkel|editor=Roger M. A.

The ''Subh al-a 'sha'' included a section on [[cryptology]]. This information was attributed to [[Ibn al-Durayhim]] who lived from 1312 to 1361, but whose writings on cryptology have been lost. The list of ciphers in this work included both [[Substitution cipher|substitution]] and [[Transposition cipher|transposition]], and for the first time, a cipher with multiple substitutions for each [[plaintext]] letter. Also traced to Ibn al-Durayhim is an exposition on and worked example of cryptanalysis, including the use of tables of [[letter frequencies]] and sets of letters which can not occur together in one word.

The '''Atlantic blue marlin''' (''Makaira nigricans'') is a species of [[marlin]] endemic to the Atlantic Ocean. It is closely related to, and usually considered conspecific with, the [[Indo-Pacific blue marlin]], then simply called blue marlin. Some authorities still consider both species distinct.

The Atlantic blue marlin (hereafter, blue marlin) feeds on a wide variety of organisms near the surface. It uses its bill to stun, injure, or kill while knifing through a school of fish or other prey, then returns to eat the injured or stunned fish. Marlin is a popular [[game fish]]. The relatively high fat content of its meat makes it commercially valuable in certain markets. It is the national fish of the [[The Bahamas|Commonwealth of the Bahamas]] and is featured on its coat of arms.

Blue marlin are distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the [[Atlantic Ocean]].  A [[maritime geography|bluewater]] fish that spends the majority of its life in the open sea far from land,&lt;ref name=zoo&gt;
{{citation

|title=Blue Marlin
|accessdate=2008-11-11
}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the blue marlin preys on a wide variety of marine organisms, mostly near the surface, often using its bill to stun or injure its prey.

Females can grow up to four times the weight of males. The maximum published weight is {{convert|818|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and length {{convert|5|m|ft|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=fishbase&gt;{{FishBase species | genus = Makaira | species = nigricans | month = August| year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adult blue marlin have few predators apart from killer whales, sharks, and humans. They are sought after as a highly prized game fish by anglers and are taken by commercial fishermen, both as a directed catch and as bycatch in major industrial tuna fisheries.  Blue marlin are currently considered a threatened species by the IUCN due to [[overfishing]] &lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;, particularly in the international waters off the coast of Portugal where they migrate to breed in the June/July months.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

Some other historic English names for the blue marlin are  '''Cuban black marlin''',  '''ocean gar''', and '''ocean guard'''.&lt;ref name=marlin&gt;

==Taxonomy and naming==
The blue marlin is placed in the genus ''Makaira''. This name is derived from the Greek word ''machaira'', meaning "a short sword or bent dagger", and the Latin ''machaera'', "sword".&lt;ref&gt;

The blue marlin is part of the [[billfish]] family [[Istiophoridae]] and is in the [[perch]]-like order [[Perciformes]]. In addition, it is in the suborder Xiphioidei and is a member of the subclass [[Neopterygii]], which means "new wings". It is also in the class of [[Actinopterygii]], which includes ray-finned fishes and spiny-rayed fishes, and the superclass [[Osteichthyes]], which includes all of the bony fishes.&lt;ref name=VT&gt;

The classification of the Atlantic blue marlin (''M. nigricans'') and the [[Indo-Pacific blue marlin]] (''M. mazara'') as separate species is under debate. Genetic data suggest, although the two groups are isolated from each other, they are both the same species, with the only genetic exchange occurring when Indo-Pacific blue marlin migrate to and contribute genes to the Atlantic population.&lt;ref&gt;

Body mass in the largest female specimens has been reported from {{convert|540|to|820|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, depending on the source (few large specimens are scientifically verified).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marinebio.org/species.asp?id=386 |title=Blue Marlins, Makaira nigricans at |publisher=Marinebio.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest blue marlin caught by IGFA angling rules is from Vitoria, Brazil, which weighed {{convert|1402|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/gallery/descript/bluemarlin/bluemarlin.html |title=FLMNH Ichthyology Department: Blue Marlin |publisher=Flmnh.ufl.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; fishermen often refer to individual marlins that reach or exceed 1,000 pounds as "granders".

The marlin has two [[dorsal fin]]s and two [[anal fin]]s. The fins are supported by bony spines known as [[Actinopterygii|rays]]. Its first dorsal fin has 39 to 43 rays from front to back.&lt;ref name="yummy"/&gt; Its second dorsal fin has six or seven rays.&lt;ref name="yummy"/&gt; Its first anal fin, which is similar in shape and size to the second dorsal fin, has 13 to 16 rays,&lt;ref name="yummy"/&gt; and the second anal fin has six or seven rays.&lt;ref name="yummy"/&gt; The pectoral fins, which have 19 to 22 rays,&lt;ref name="yummy"/&gt; are long and narrow and can be drawn in to the sides of the body. The [[pelvic fin]]s are shorter than the pectorals, have a poorly developed membrane, and are depressible into ventral grooves. Its first anal fin, along with its [[pectoral fin|pectoral]] and [[caudal fin]]s, can be folded into grooves. This [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamlines]] the fish and thereby reduces [[drag (physics)|drag]].

Blue marlin, like other billfish, can rapidly change color, an effect created by pigment-containing  [[iridophore]]s and light-reflecting skin cells.&lt;ref&gt;

Most often, however, the body is blue-black on top with a silvery white underside. It has about 15 rows of pale, cobalt-colored stripes, each of which has round dots and/or thin bars, located on both sides of the fish.&lt;ref name="yummy"/&gt; The first dorsal fin membrane is dark blue or almost black and has no dots or marks. Other fins are normally brownish-black, sometimes with a hint of dark blue. The bases of the first and second anal fins have a hint of silvery white.

The body is covered with thick, bony, elongated scales that have one, two, or three posterior points, with one being the most common form.&lt;ref name="yummy"/&gt;

The bill is long and stout. Both the jaws and the palatines (the roof of the mouth) are covered with small, file-like teeth. The [[lateral line|lateral line system]] is a group of [[lateral line|neuromasts]] rooted in lateral line canals that can sense weak water motions and large changes in pressure.&lt;ref&gt;

==Range and migration==

Blue marlin are found year-round in tropical oceanic waters of the Atlantic.  The range expands into temperate waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres during the warmer months and contracts towards the Equator during colder months.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Warm currents such as the [[Gulf Stream]] in the western Atlantic have a major influence on their seasonal distribution.

The blue marlin's latitudinal range extends from about [[45th parallel north|45°N]] to about 35°S. It is less abundant in the eastern Atlantic, where it mostly occurs off Africa between the latitudes of 25°N and 25°S. The largest numbers are usually found in waters warmer than 24&amp;nbsp;°C (75&amp;nbsp;°F), but blue marlin have been found at surface water temperatures as high as 30.5&amp;nbsp;°C (86.9&amp;nbsp;°F) and as low as 21.7&amp;nbsp;°C (71.1&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name=blue&gt;

Tagging studies, using conventional "spaghetti" tags, and more recently [[Pop-up satellite archival tag|pop-up satellite tags]], have given researchers a glimpse into blue marlin migration patterns and habits.  Recaptures of tagged fish have shown multiple movements between the [[Caribbean]] Islands and [[Venezuela]] and the [[Bahamas]], as well as between the Caribbean [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands]] and West Africa, and interocean travel.  Most notably, a blue marlin tagged off the coast of Delaware was recovered near the island of Mauritius off the southeast coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean – a voyage of 9,254 miles.&lt;ref name="tunaresearch.org"&gt;http://www.tunaresearch.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=111&amp;Itemid=232&lt;/ref&gt; Several fish have been recaptured in the same general area where they were tagged, implying reverse migration after/over several years, but the data are insufficient to accurately determine seasonality.&lt;ref&gt;

== Predators and parasites ==
Once blue marlin reach maturity, they have few predators, with the most important probably being large pelagic sharks such as the [[shortfin mako]] and [[great white shark]].&lt;ref name=white&gt;

Blue marlin have many parasites, including from these groups: [[Digenea]] (flukes), Didymozoidea (tissue flukes), [[Monogenea]] (gillworms), [[Cestoda]] (tapeworms), [[Nematoda]] (roundworms), [[Acanthocephala]] (spiny-headed worms), [[copepods]], [[barnacle]]s, and [[cookiecutter shark]]s.

==Lifecycle==

'''Growth and maturity'''

Atlantic blue marlin reach [[sexual maturity]] at the age of two to four years. Males reach sexual maturity at a weight of {{convert|35|-|44|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and females at {{convert|47|-|61|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;

Blue marlin breed in late summer and fall. Females may spawn as many as four times in one season. They often release over seven million [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] at once, each about {{convert|1|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter. Few reach sexual maturity. The [[planktonic]] young drift freely in the ocean's [[pelagic zone]]. Larvae inhabit the west central Atlantic off [[Georgia (U.S. State)|Georgia]], [[North Carolina]], [[Florida]], [[Jamaica]], [[Bahamas]], the [[Dominican Republic]], and [[Puerto Rico]], and also the southwest Atlantic off [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name=ummz/&gt;
The larvae may grow as much as {{convert|16|mm|in|abbr=on}} in a day.&lt;ref name=ummz/&gt; On their sides and [[dorsum (biology)|dorsal surface]]s, they are blue-black in color, while [[ventral]]ly they are white. Both the caudal fin and the [[caudal peduncle]] (the narrow part of the fish's body to which the [[Adipose fin|caudal or tail fin]] is attached) are clear. Two iridescent blue patches occur on the head, and some individuals have darker spots on their backs. In adolescents, the first dorsal fin is large and concave, gradually reducing in proportion to body size with continued growth.&lt;ref name="marlin"/&gt; Males may live for 18 years, and females up to 27.

'''Diet and feeding'''

The [[Ichthyoplankton|larvae]] feed upon a variety of [[zooplankton]] along with drifting fish eggs and other larvae. They progress to feeding on a wide range of fishes, particularly scombrids, such as [[mackerel]] and [[tuna]], [[squid]], and especially near oceanic islands and [[coral reef]]s, on juvenile inshore fish.  Studies of stomach contents have found that smaller schooling scombrids such as [[frigate mackerel]], [[bullet tuna]], and [[skipjack tuna]] make up a substantial proportion of their diet. Squid and deep-sea fishes such as [[pomfret]] and [[snake mackerel]] are also important prey items in certain areas.  Blue marlin have been recorded to take prey as large as [[white marlin]], as well as [[yellowfin tuna|yellowfin]] and [[bigeye tuna]] in the 100-lb range. Conversely, they are also capable of feeding on small but numerous prey such as [[filefish]] and [[snipefish]].

Scientists and fishermen have long debated the extent to which blue marlin and other billfish use their elongated upper jaw in feeding.  A 2007 Japanese study of stomach contents of fish captured in a commercial trolling fishery found that 130 undigested prey items obtained from 227 blue marlin had spearing, slashing, and other injuries that were judged to have been inflicted by the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shimose | first1 = T. | last2 = Yokawa | first2 = K. | last3 = Saito | first3 = H. | last4 = Tachihara | first4 = K. | title = Evidence for use of the bill by blue marlin, ''Makaira nigricans'', during feeding | doi = 10.1007/s10228-007-0419-x | journal = Ichthyological Research | volume = 54 | issue = 4 | pages = 420–422| year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bioaccumulation'''

[[Heavy metals]] have been known to accumulate in the Atlantic blue marlin, a process known as [[bioaccumulation]]. In 2017, the [[Texas Parks and Wildlife Department]] issued a consumption advisory for all blue marlin caught along the coast of Texas based on the presence of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://tpwd.texas.gov/regulations/outdoor-annual/fishing/general-rules-regulations/fish-consumption-bans-and-advisories |title=Fish Consumption Bans and Advisories |website=Texas Parks and Wildlife Department |access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic importance==
[[File:Makaira nigricans meat.JPG|thumb|An 8-oz (230-g) marlin filet|alt=Approximately triangular piece of pink-to-red fish]]

=== Commercial fishery ===

Marlin has commercial value throughout the world, with landings totalling 3,064 metric tons in 2000.&lt;ref name=ummz/&gt;  It is particularly valued in Japan for [[sashimi]].&lt;ref name=ummz/&gt;  Blue marlin meat is sometimes smoked and sold by roadside vendors.

Blue marlin are often caught as [[bycatch]] in tuna [[longline fisheries]].

=== Recreational fishery ===

Sport fishermen first encountered blue marlin in the Bahamas in the 1920s and early 1930s, when pioneering big-game fishermen such as Van Campen Heilner and [[S. Kip Farrington]] began exploring the waters offshore of Bimini and Cat Cay. Since then, blue marlin have been renowned as one of the world's greatest game fishes.  The sportfishing pursuit of marlin and other billfish has developed into a multimillion dollar industry that includes hundreds of companies and thousands of jobs for boat operators, boat builders, [[marina]]s, dealerships, and [[fishing tackle]] manufacturers and dealers.

The most established sport fisheries for blue marlin are found along the eastern seaboard and the [[Gulf Coast]] of the United States, Bermuda, the Bahamas, and several other Caribbean islands (notably St Thomas and [[Puerto Rico]]).  Recreational fishing for blue marlin also takes place in [[Hawaii]], Brazil, [[Venezuela]], and the Atlantic coast of [[Mexico]], particularly the [[Yucatan]] peninsula.  In the eastern Atlantic, blue marlin sport fisheries exist from the [[Algarve]] coast of [[Portugal]] in the north to [[Angola]] in the south and include the islands of the [[Azores]], [[Canary Islands|Canaries]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Madeira]], and [[Ascension Island]].

The [[IGFA|International Game Fish Association]] all-tackle world record for blue marlin currently stands at 1,402&amp;nbsp;lb 2 oz (636&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref name="marlin"/&gt;  This fish was captured in Vitoria, Brazil.

== Conservation ==
The blue marlin is under intense pressure from longline fishing. In the Caribbean region alone, Japanese and Cuban fishermen annually take over a thousand tons. All vessels within {{convert|200|mi|km|abbr=on}} of the U.S. coastline are required to release any [[billfish]] caught. However, the survival rate of released fish is low because of damage during capture.&lt;ref name="marlin"/&gt;

''Makaira nigricans'' is listed as a threatened species by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]].&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; In 2010, [[Greenpeace International]] added the blue marlin to its seafood red list. &lt;!-- "The Greenpeace International seafood red list is a list of fish that are commonly sold in supermarkets around the world, and which have a very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries." --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species Greenpeace International Seafood Red list] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205030730/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/seafood/red-list-of-species |date=5 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sport fishermen have been at the forefront of efforts to conserve blue marlin populations.  The initial efforts to develop electronic tags for tracking highly migratory fish were carried out on marlin in Hawaii, in collaboration with anglers in the Hawaiian International Billfish Tournament.&lt;ref name="tunaresearch.org"/&gt;

== In popular culture ==
[[File:Hemingway and Marlins.jpg|right|thumb|Ernest Hemingway with caught blue marlin]]
Both Zane Grey and [[Ernest Hemingway]], who fished for blue marlin off the Florida Keys, the Bahamas, and most famously in Cuba, wrote extensively about their pursuit.

In Hemingway's novella ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'', a fisherman named Santiago battles a blue marlin for three days off the coast of Cuba.&lt;ref name="zoo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red''''' was a public art installation created in the [[moat]] of the [[Tower of London]], England, between July and November 2014. It commemorated the [[centenary of the outbreak of World War I]] and consisted of 888,246 [[ceramic]] red [[Papaver rhoeas|poppies]], each intended to represent one British or Colonial serviceman killed in the War. The ceramic artist was [[Paul Cummins]], with conceptual design by the stage designer [[Tom Piper]].&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://poppies.hrp.org.uk/about-the-installation "About the installation"], Tower of London website. Retrieved 17 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The work's title was taken from the first line of a poem by an [[War poet|unknown soldier in World War I]].

==Background==
The work's title came from a poem discovered by Cummins and was used by Piper as the inspiration for his conceptual design. It was written by an unknown World War I soldier from [[Derbyshire]], who joined up in the early days of the war and died in at the Front of the First World War. The poem begins: "The blood swept lands and seas of red,/ Where angels dare&lt;ref&gt;Some sources give "... fear to tread ..."&lt;/ref&gt; to tread / ... ".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ssafa.org.uk/get-involved/donate/wills/will-of-an-unnamed-soldier/ "The Will of an unnamed soldier"], SSAFA website (contains full text of poem). Retrieved 9 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The poem was contained in the soldier's unsigned [[will and testament|will]], found by Cummins among old records in [[Chesterfield]], Derbyshire.&lt;ref name="May"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/07/tower-london-moat-filled-ceramic-poppies-ww1-dead "Poppies to fill Tower of London moat in first world war commemoration"], ''The Guardian'', 7 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was created by Paul Cummins Ceramics in conjunction with Historic Royal Palaces to be displayed in the moat of the Tower of London, which was used in the early days of the war as a training ground for [[City of London]] workers who had enlisted to fight – the "[[Stockbrokers' Battalion]]".&lt;ref name="May"/&gt;

==Form==
The work consisted of a sea of [[ceramic]] red [[Papaver rhoeas|poppies]], in a design which appeared to flow out of the Tower itself and ripple across the moat. There were a series of designed elements which added drama, height and movement to the installation: the "Weeping Window" flowing out of a window in Legge's Mount in the West Moat, (which became the iconic image), "Over the Top", a cascade of poppies down the wall on the wharf side of the moat and the "Wave", a free-standing twisted metal sculpture covered in poppies which curled over the main causeway into the Tower. 

The ceramic poppies were individually hand-made at Cummins's ceramics works in Derbyshire&lt;ref name="May" /&gt; and at Johnson Tiles in [[Tunstall, Staffordshire|Tunstall]], Stoke-on-Trent.&lt;ref name="sentinel"&gt;[http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Campaign-launched-bring-Tower-London-poppies/story-25695953-detail/story.html "Campaign launched to bring the Tower of London poppies to Stoke-on-Trent"], ''The Sentinel'', 12 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnson-tiles.com/blog/2014/11/johnson-tiles-helps-poppies-bloom-tower-london/ "Johnson Tiles helps poppies bloom at Tower of London"], Johnson Tiles website, 5 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The poppies were added to the installation progressively by volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/in-pictures-29935592 "The poppies at the Tower of London"], BBC News, 7 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The 497,000&amp;nbsp;kg of the Etruria Marl-based Etruscan red [[earthenware]] used, as well as the majority of the manufacturing equipment and materials, were supplied by Potclays Limited in Stoke-on-Trent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Business-Family-firm-Potclays-supplies-materials/story-21090630-detail/story.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/29/tower-poppies-debt-to-the-potteries "Tower poppies’ debt to the Potteries"], ''The Guardian'', 29 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; There were eventually 888,246 of the flowers, representing one count of the number of [[History of the United Kingdom during World War I#Casualties|British and Colonial military fatalities]] in World War I.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwgc.org/learning-and-resources/publications/annual-report.aspx Commonwealth War Graves Commission Annual Report 2010–2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151104004037/http://www.cwgc.org/learning-and-resources/publications/annual-report.aspx |date=4 November 2015 }}. This includes a table of numbers of war dead (page 45); 888,246 is the figure for identified burials and names listed on memorials, for the UK and colonies (not including [[dominion]]s).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Poppy Planting (14845374937).jpg|right|thumb|Volunteer planting poppies]]

The first poppy was planted on 17 July 2014, and the work was unveiled on 5 August (the centenary of [[History of the United Kingdom during World War I|Britain's entry into the war]]). A team of about 17,500 volunteers put the poppies in place, overseen by Piper and YW Jim Duncan, making this a true public artwork. The last one was planted on 11 November 2014 ([[Remembrance Day]]), by a 13-year-old cadet, Harry Hayes, from the [[Combined Cadet Force|Combined Cadet Force (CCF)]] of [[Reading Blue Coat School]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-one/11224043/Cadet-Harry-Hayes-13-plants-last-of-888246-poppies-in-Tower-of-London-moat.html "Cadet Harry Hayes, 13, plants last of 888,246 poppies in Tower of London moat"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 11 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; After that day a team of about 8,000 volunteers began removing the flowers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-30014867 "Tower of London poppies: Volunteers to remove ceramic flowers"], BBC News, 12 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the public had been able to pre-order the ceramic poppies for £25 each, with a share of the proceeds (estimated at more than £15 million&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-30100926 "Removal of Tower of London poppies 'at halfway point'"], BBC News, 19 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;) going to six service charities: COBSEO, [[Combat Stress (charitable organisation)|Combat Stress]], [[Coming Home campaign|Coming Home]], [[Help for Heroes]], the [[Royal British Legion]] and [[SSAFA]].&lt;ref name=about /&gt;

At around sunset each day between 1 September and 10 November, the names of 180 World War I service personnel, nominated by members of the public to appear on a Roll of Honour, were read aloud by a [[Yeomen Warders|Yeoman Warder]] or guest reader, followed by the ''[[Last Post]]'' bugle call.&lt;ref name=web2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrp.org.uk/TowerOfLondon/VisitUs/Topthingstoseeanddo/Poppies/RollofHonour|title=Roll of Honour – Submit your nomination|work=Historic Royal Palaces – Tower of London|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The installation was visited by the Princes [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|William]] and [[Prince Harry|Harry]] and the [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Duchess of Cambridge]] on the day of its opening,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20151102062135/http://royalista.com/27639/gallery-kate-william-and-harry-visit-blood-red-sea-of-poppies/ "Kate, William and Harry visit blood red sea of poppies"], royalista.com, 6 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] and [[Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] on 16 October.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-29642463 "Queen visits Tower of London poppy garden"], BBC News, 16 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/gallery/2014/oct/16/queen-blood-swept-lands-seas-of-red-in-pictures "Queen visits Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red installation"], ''The Guardian'', 16 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen later spoke about the memorial in her annual [[Royal Christmas Message|Christmas Message]], broadcast on 25 December 2014.

In all, an estimated 5 million people saw the installation,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-30001177 "Tower of London poppies: Final poppy is 'planted'"], BBC News, 11 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and the huge visitor demand saw the Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] and other politicians join calls to try and extend the period for which the installation remained at the Tower so that more visitors would be able to pay their respects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/11214379/David-Cameron-joins-plea-to-extend-Tower-of-London-poppies.html "David Cameron joins plea to extend Tower of London poppies"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 7 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Historic Royal Palaces and the artist Paul Cummins resisted such calls, stating that the transience of the installation was a key part of the artistic concept,&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/nov/06/tower-of-london-poppies-removed-12-november-blood-swept-lands-and-seas-of-red "Tower of London poppies to be removed as planned on 12 November"], ''The Guardian'', 6 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the poppies would be removed as planned and distributed to their purchasers. On 8 November it was announced that ''Wave'', which rose up over the Tower's entrance, would remain in place until the end of the month and that following this, the sculptures ''Wave'' and ''Weeping Window'' would be taken on a tour of the UK, organised by [[14-18 NOW]]. This tour would last until the centenary of the armistice of World War I in November of 2018 and visit 19 locations; after the tour the sculptures would enter the [[Imperial War Museum]]'s collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-29965477 "Poppy display segment at Tower of London given extension"], BBC News, 8 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News Online 9 November 2014"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-29965477|title= Tower of London poppies: Thousands to go on tour|author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 9 November 2014|website= [[BBC News Online]] |publisher= | accessdate= 7 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A campaign was launched in December 2014 to bring the sculptural elements to Stoke-on-Trent during the tour itinerary as the majority of materials and much of the piece itself were manufactured in the city.&lt;ref name="sentinel" /&gt; In April 2016, about halfway through the tour, ''Weeping Windows'' was installed at [[St Magnus Cathedral]] in [[Kirkwall]], [[Orkney]], Britain's most northerly cathedral, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the [[Battle of Jutland]], the biggest naval engagement of the First World War.&lt;ref name="grdn"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Mark|title=Tower of London poppies bloom at Britain's most northerly cathedral|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/22/tower-of-london-poppies-weeping-window-st-magnus-kirkwall-orkney|accessdate=2 July 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition of the work, Paul Cummins and Tom Piper were both awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire)]] in the [[2015 New Year Honours]].&lt;ref name=mbe&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30633687 "NY Honours for poppy duo, Joan Collins and John Hurt"], BBC News, 30 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reaction==
Although the installation struck a chord with the public, it received negative reactions from some critics in the press. [[A. A. Gill]] of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' called it "impressive" but "curiously bland".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-the-papers-29974714 BBC News paper review], 9 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'s'' art critic [[Jonathan Jones (journalist)|Jonathan Jones]] described it as having a "false nobility" and being a "prettified and toothless" memorial. Tom Piper said in response that "... it is a remarkably good thing that it is so accessible. We should not be trying to create something that is difficult to understand."&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

The '''Bode Museee''' is one of the group of [[museum]]s on the [[Museum Island]] in [[Berlin]], Germany. It was designed by architect [[Ernst von Ihne]] and completed in 1904. Originally called the '''Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum''' after [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Emperor Frederick III]], the museum was renamed in honour of its first [[curator]], [[Wilhelm von Bode]], in 1956.

==Collections==
Closed for repairs since 1997, the museum was reopened on October 18, 2006 after a €156 million refurbishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/berliner-kulturbauten-und-was-sie-kosten-teuer-billig-im-plan/8949466.html |title=Teuer, billig, im Plan: Berliner Kulturbauten und was sie kosten |newspaper=[[Der Tagesspiegel]] |date=17 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; True to the ethos of its founding director, Wilhelm von Bode, who believed in mixing art collections,&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Alan Riding (November 27, 2006), [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/27/arts/design/27bode.html German Museums Move Closer to Reunification] ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; it is now the home for a collection of [[sculpture]]s, [[Byzantine art]], and [[coin]]s and [[medal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smb.spk-berlin.de/smb/sammlungen/details.php?lang=en&amp;objID=14&amp;p=1 History – Sculpture Collection and Museum of Byzantine Art.]&lt;/ref&gt; The presentation of the collections is both geographic and chronological, with the Byzantine and Gothic art of northern and southern Europe displayed separately on the museum’s first floor and a similar regional division of Renaissance and Baroque art on its second floor.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

The sculpture collection shows art of the [[Eastern Christianity|Christian Orient]] (with an emphasis on [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] [[Egypt]]), sculptures from [[Byzantium]] and [[Ravenna]], sculptures of the [[Middle Ages]], the [[art of Italy|Italian]] [[Gothic art|Gothic]], and the early [[Renaissance]]. Late German Gothic works are also represented by [[Tilman Riemenschneider]], the south German Renaissance, and Prussian [[Baroque sculpture|Baroque art]] up to the 18th century. In the future selected works of the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin|Gemäldegalerie]] will be integrated into the sculpture collection. This is reminiscent of William von Bode's concept of "style rooms", in which sculptures, paintings, and crafts are viewed together, as was usual in upper middle-class private collections.

The ''Münzkabinett'' ("coin cabinet") is one of the world's largest [[Numismatics|numismatic]] collections. Its range spans from the beginning of [[mint (coin)|minting]] in the 7th century BC  in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] up to the present day. With approximately 500,000 items the collection is a unique archive for historical research, while its medal collection makes it an important art exhibition at the same time.

Writing in ''[[The Financial Times]]'' on the occasion on the museum's reopening in 2006, [[Neil MacGregor]], director of the [[British Museum]], hailed “the most comprehensive display of European sculpture anywhere.” He added: “It is no exaggeration to say that in the new Bode Museum, Europe will be able for the first time to read its history — aesthetic and religious, intellectual and political — in a three-dimensional form.”&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

==The "Flora" bust==
In 1910, it was revealed that a bust of ''[[Flora (mythology)|Flora]]'', which had been purchased by the [[Kaiser Friedrich Museum]], [[Berlin]], under the belief that it was by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], may have actually been created  by the English sculptor, [[Richard Cockle Lucas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Albert Durer Lucas |url=http://www.burlington.co.uk/artist-biography/albert-durer-lucas.html|publisher=Burlington Paintings|accessdate=15 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilhelm von Bode]], the general manager of the Prussian Art Collections for the Berlin Museum, had spotted the bust in a London gallery and purchased it for a few pounds. Bode was convinced that the bust was by Leonardo and the Berlin Museum authorities, and the German public, were delighted to have "snatched a great art treasure from under the very noses" of the British art world.&lt;ref name="Craddock"&gt;{{cite book|last=Craddock|first=Paul |title= Scientific investigation of copies, fakes and forgeries|year=2009|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |isbn= 978-0-7506-4205-7 |pages=432–434 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=41g63RVB4fIC&amp;pg=PA432&amp;lpg=PA432&amp;dq=Flora+Bode-Museum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wpL7OrLMx_&amp;sig=7kNV80BwYpeuyvrJVsWpXSoKBq0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ViEJTfSJJMubhQe74pS9Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly afterwards, ''[[The Times]]'' ran an article claiming that the bust was the work of Lucas, having been commissioned to produce it from a painting. Lucas's son, Albert, then came forward and swore under oath that the story was correct and that he had helped his father to make it. Albert was able to explain how the layers of wax had been built up from old candle ends; he also described how his father would stuff various debris, including newspapers, inside the bust. When the Berlin museum staff removed the base they found the debris, just as Albert had described it, including a letter dated in the 1840s.&lt;ref name="Craddock"/&gt;

Despite this evidence, Bode continued to claim that his original attribution was correct. To support this, he displayed the Flora bust among a selection of Lucas's lesser work – this exhibition rather backfired, however, as it showed that Lucas had been regularly making wax sculptures inspired by the great works of previous times.&lt;ref name="Craddock"/&gt;

Various claims and counter-claims have been put forward about the bust, from its being an outright forgery to being a genuine 16th-century piece (albeit not by Leonardo). Scientific examination has been inconclusive and unhelpful in dating the bust, although it is accepted as having at least some connection with Lucas.&lt;ref name="Craddock"/&gt; The bust remains on display in what is now the Bode Museum [[museum label|labelled "England"]], "19th Century" with a question mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Härig |first=Beatrice |title=Flora's duel for waxy smile|url=http://www.monumente-online.de/10/01/sonderthema/Madame_Tussaud_Wachsrestaurierung_Moulagen_Wachskunst_Bodemuseum_Flora_Votivfigur.php |publisher="Monumente"|accessdate=15 December 2010|language=German|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canadian gold coin theft==
On 27 March 2017, a solid gold coin called the [[Big Maple Leaf]], issued by the [[Royal Canadian Mint]] in 2007 as a commemorative piece, was stolen from the museum.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-39409754|title=Solid gold coin worth $4m stolen from Berlin museum|date=2017-03-27|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-03-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/28/forging-pound-coins-crime-forgers Guardian report remembers the theft]&lt;/ref&gt; The coin, at 53&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter and 3&amp;nbsp;cm in thickness, is made of 24-carat gold and is worth around [[Euro|€]]3.7 million.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/27/giant-gold-coin-worth-almost-4-millionstolen-berlin-museum-dawn/|title=Giant gold coin worth almost €4 million stolen from Berlin museum in dawn heist|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2017-03-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ladder was found on the train tracks nearby, leading German police to speculate that the thief entered the building by breaking open a window in the back of the museum next to the railway tracks.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

==Pop culture==
The museum appears as a playable level in the World War II video game ''[[Sniper Elite V2]]''.

'''Bruno Leopoldo Francesco Sammartino'''&lt;ref name=NWA/&gt; (October 6, 1935 – April 18, 2018) was an Italian-born American [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], best known for his work with the [[WWE|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (WWWF, now WWE). There, he held the [[WWE Championship|WWWF World Heavyweight Championship]] (WWWF Heavyweight Championship during his second reign) for more than 11 years (4,040 days) across two reigns, the first of which is [[List of WWE Champions|the longest single reign in the promotion's history]] at 2,803 days.

== Early life ==
Bruno Leopoldo Francesco Sammartino was born in [[Pizzoferrato]], [[Abruzzo]], Italy, to Alfonso and Emilia Sammartino on October 6, 1935.&lt;ref name=hornbaker/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; He was the youngest of seven children, four of whom died during his early childhood.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; When he was four, his father immigrated to [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;&lt;ref name="trib"/&gt; During [[World War II]], his mother hid Bruno and his siblings from German soldiers in a mountain called Valla Rocca.&lt;ref name="trib"/&gt; During this time, his mother would sneak into their German-occupied town for food and supplies.&lt;ref name="trib"/&gt; In 1950
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-bruno-sammartino-obit-20180418-story.html Pro wrestling legend Bruno Sammartino dies at 82, ''Los Angeles Times'', April 18, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; she and the children joined her husband in Pittsburgh.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;

When the Sammartinos arrived in the U.S. Bruno spoke no English and was sickly from the privations of the war years.&lt;ref name="trib"/&gt; This made him an easy target for bullies at [[Schenley High School]]. He turned to weightlifting and wrestling to build himself up.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; His devotion to weightlifting nearly resulted in a berth on the 1956 U.S. Olympic team, which went instead to eventual gold medalist [[Paul Anderson (weightlifter)|Paul Anderson]].&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;

In 1959, Sammartino set a world record in the bench press with a lift of 565 pounds, done without elbow or wrist wraps. When he brought the bar down, he did not bounce it off his chest, but set it there for two seconds before attempting the press.&lt;ref name=davies/&gt; He trained in wrestling with Rex Peery, the [[University of Pittsburgh]] team coach.&lt;ref name=hornbaker/&gt;

He also became known for performing strongman stunts in the Pittsburgh area, and sportscaster [[Bob Prince]] put him on his television show. It was there that he was spotted by local [[professional wrestling]] promoter Rudy Miller, who recruited the young man into the ring.&lt;ref name=hornbaker/&gt;

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Early years (1959–1963) ===
Sammartino made his professional debut in Pittsburgh on December 17, 1959, [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinning]] Dmitri Grabowski in 19 seconds.&lt;ref name=davies/&gt; Sammartino's first match in [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]] was on January 2, 1960,&lt;ref name=NWA/&gt; defeating [[Bull Curry]] in five minutes.&lt;ref name=slamobit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2018/04/18/22776675.html|title=Bruno Sammartino dies at 82|date=April 18, 2018|last1=Oliver|first1=Greg|last2=Johnson|first2=Steven|accessdate=April 19, 2018|work=Slam!

[[File:Bruno Sammartino Mario Trevi a New York.jpg|thumb|Bruno Sammartino and [[Mario Trevi]]]]
Feeling like he was being held back in the New York territory in favor of [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) star [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|Buddy Rogers]], Sammartino gave his notice to [[Capitol Wrestling Corporation]] (CWC) owner [[Vince McMahon Sr.]] and planned to go to [[San Francisco]] to work for [[Roy Shire]]. While on his way to California, he missed two bookings in Baltimore and Chicago, and as a result was suspended in those territories. California honored the other state's suspension, leaving Sammartino out of work.&lt;ref name=Oliver12&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2012/03/27/19554651.html|title=Without Toronto, there would have been no Bruno Sammartino|date=March 27, 2012|last=Oliver|first=Greg|accessdate=April 19, 2018|work=Slam! Sports|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography, Sammartino states that he believed McMahon set him up, by double-booking him and not informing him of his match in Baltimore, as a way of punishment.&lt;ref name=sammartino&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sammartino |first1=Bruno |last2=Michelucci |first2=Bob |year=1990 |title=Bruno Sammartino: An Autobiography of Wrestling's Living Legend |publisher=Sports Publishing |isbn=978-0911137149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sammartino was forced to return to Pittsburgh and found work as a laborer.&lt;ref name=Oliver12/&gt;

On the advice of wrestler [[Yukon Eric]], Sammartino contacted [[Toronto]] promoter [[Frank Tunney]] hoping to take advantage of Toronto's large Italian population.&lt;ref name=slamobit/&gt; Sammartino made his Toronto debut in March 1962 and very quickly, with the help of self-promotion in local newspapers and radio programs, became an attraction. His ability to speak Italian also ingratiated him with that immigrant population.&lt;ref name=Oliver12/&gt; With [[Whipper Billy Watson]], Sammartino won his first [[professional wrestling championship]] in September 1962, the local version of the [[NWA International Tag Team Championship (Toronto version)|International Tag Team Championship]].&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; Soon, he was in demand by other promoters in different Canadian territories.&lt;ref name=Oliver12/&gt;

Sammartino also challenged [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Lou Thesz]] twice for the championship in Canada. One match ended in a [[Professional wrestling#Draw|draw]] and the other with Thesz scoring a fluke pin after a collision, despite Sammartino controlling the 20 minute match from the beginning. This match was [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booked]] by NWA kingpin [[Sam Muchnick]] as a preliminary to the forming of the WWWF, to ensure the dominance of the senior organization and its championship.&lt;ref name=won1995&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meltzer |first=Dave |authorlink=Dave Meltzer |date=August 21, 1995 |journal=Wrestling Observer Newsletter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Wide Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Federation (1963–1981) ===
==== First World Heavyweight Championship reign (1963–1971) ====
Eventually, promoters [[Toots Mondt]] and McMahon Sr. cleared up Sammartino's suspension by paying his $500 fine, allowing him to return to wrestling in the United States. After many weeks of phone calls from McMahon trying to lure him back, Sammartino agreed if he received a title match against "Nature Boy" Buddy Rogers, the-then [[WWWF World Heavyweight Champion]]. Sammartino won the title on May 17, 1963, defeating Rogers in 48 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cawthon |first=Graham |year=2013 |title=The History of Professional Wrestling: The Results WWF 1963–1989 |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform |isbn=978-1-4928-2597-5 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sammartino and Rogers faced each other two months later at Madison Square Garden in a tag team match, with Rogers and Handsome Johnny Barend defeating Sammartino and Bobo Brazil by 2 falls to 1. Rogers pinned Sammartino for the third and deciding fall. Rogers retired prior to their scheduled title rematch on October 4, 1963, in Jersey City, New Jersey's Roosevelt Stadium. Sammartino instead that night had his first match against new number one contender, [[Gorilla Monsoon]]. Monsoon won the match but since it was by [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]] which under such a set of circumstances a title is not transferable, Sammartino retained his belt.

On December 8, 1969, he teamed with [[Tony Marino]] to win the [[WWWF International Tag Team Championship]] by defeating The Rising Suns ([[Professor Tanaka|Tanaka]] and [[Mitsu Arakawa]]). Company policy meant that Sammartino could not hold two championships simultaneously, so he was replaced by [[Víctor Rivera (professional wrestler)|Victor Rivera]].&lt;ref name=Intertag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/classics/classic-lists/10-titles-you-never-knew-existed|title=10 championships you never knew existed in WWE|accessdate=April 22, 2018|publisher=[[WWE]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sammartino held the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship for seven years, eight months, and one day (2,803 days).&lt;ref name=slamobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBSremembers&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/remembering-bruno-sammartino-the-singular-face-of-a-bygone-pro-wrestling-era/|title=Remembering Bruno Sammartino, the singular face of a bygone pro wrestling era|date=April 18, 2018|last=Campbell|first=Brian|accessdate=April 22, 2018|publisher=[[CBS Sports]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 18, 1971, Sammartino lost the championship at Madison Square Garden to [[Ivan Koloff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cawthon |first=Graham |year=2013 |title=The History of Professional Wrestling: The Results WWF 1963–1989 |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform |isbn=978-1-4928-2597-5 |page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sammartino recalled the shocked silence that greeted the result, remarking he thought he had damaged his ears.&lt;ref name=Schramm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingGuestColumn/schramm_99sep15.html|title=Sammartino the Living Legend|date=September 15, 1999|last=Schramm|first=Chris|accessdate=April 19, 2018|work=Slam! Sports|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he won the International Tag Team Championship for the second time by teaming with [[Dominic DeNucci]].&lt;ref name=Intertag/&gt;

==== Second World Heavyweight Championship reign (1973–1977) ====
[[File:Kathy Segal &amp; Bruno Sammartino, August 1974.jpg|thumb|250px|Sammartino signing an autograph in August 1974 for bodybuilder [[Kathy Segal]], who later won the [[Ms. International]]]]
Later in 1972, Sammartino was asked back by McMahon Sr. to regain the title. After refusing McMahon's initial offer, Sammartino was offered a percentage of all the gates when he wrestled and a decreased work schedule that only included major arenas. Soon after, Sammartino and then champion Pedro Morales teamed up for a series of tag team matches. In a televised match, Professor Tanaka blinded both men with salt and they were maneuvered into fighting each other. When their eyes cleared, they kept fighting each other. Two weeks later, all syndicated wrestling shows in the WWWF showed a clip of Sammartino and Morales signing a contract for a title match at [[Shea Stadium]]. When McMahon gestured for them to shake hands, both wordlessly turned and walked away. On September 30, 1972, Sammartino and Morales wrestled to a 65-minute draw at Shea Stadium in New York.&lt;ref name=Davies2001&gt;{{cite book |last=Davies |first=Ross |year=2001|title=Bruno Sammartino |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-8239-3432-4 |page=77 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zPdkZJX4Q80C&amp;pg=PA77 |accessdate=September 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, on December 10, 1973, Sammartino regained the WWWF Heavyweight Championship by defeating [[Stan Stasiak]].&lt;ref name=Schramm/&gt; During this time, on April 26, 1976, Sammartino suffered a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Legit|legitimate]] neck fracture in a match against [[Stan Hansen]] at Madison Square Garden, when Hansen [[Botch (professional wrestling)|improperly executed]] a move and dropped Sammartino on his head.&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/18/sports/bruno-sammartino-pro-wrestlings-champ-for-a-decade-dies-at-82.html|title=Bruno Sammartino, Durable Champ in WWE Hall of Fame, Dies at 82|date=April 18, 2018|last=McFadden|first=Robert D.|accessdate=April 19, 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=slamobit/&gt; After two months, Sammartino returned and faced Hansen in a rematch on June 25, 1976 at [[Showdown at Shea#1976|Shea Stadium]], which was on the closed circuit TV undercard of the [[Muhammad Ali|Ali]] vs. [[Antonio Inoki]] match for WWWF cities. The match was rated 1976 "Match of the Year" by ''[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]''.&lt;ref name="PWI Awards"/&gt;

In early 1977, Sammartino informed McMahon Sr. that he felt he could no longer continue as champion due to his injuries. On April 30, 1977, he was defeated by Superstar Billy Graham for the title.&lt;ref name=Schramm/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cawthon |first=Graham |year=2013 |title=The History of Professional Wrestling: The Results WWF 1963–1989 |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform |isbn=978-1-4928-2597-5 |page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second title run lasted three years, four months, and twenty days (1,237 days).&lt;ref name=slamobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBSremembers/&gt; Despite a very long series of rematches against Graham, Sammartino was unable to regain the title. His final attempt was in Philadelphia, just a few days before Graham was scheduled to lose the title to [[Bob Backlund]].

==== Later career and initial retirement (1978–1981) ====
After his second reign ended, Sammartino leisurely toured the U.S. and the world. He wrestled then NWA World Heavyweight Champion [[Harley Race]] to a one-hour draw in [[St. Louis]]. He also wrestled and defeated [[Blackjack Mulligan]], [[Alfred Hayes (wrestler)|Lord Alfred Hayes]], [[Dick Murdoch]], [[Kenji Shibuya]], and [[Ray Stevens (wrestler)|"Crippler" Ray Stevens]]. Also during this time, Sammartino began serving as color commentator for the WWF's syndicated programs, ''[[WWF Championship Wrestling]]'' and ''[[WWF All-Star Wrestling]]''.

On January 22, 1980, his former student [[Larry Zbyszko]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turned]] on him at the [[WWE#World Wrestling Federation|World Wrestling Federation]]'s ''[[WWWF Championship Wrestling|Championship Wrestling]]'' show. Sammartino, shocked and hurt by Zbyszko's betrayal, vowed to make Zbyszko pay dearly. Their feud culminated on August 9, 1980, in front of 36,295 fans at Shea Stadium.&lt;ref name ="WWFresults309"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cawthon |first=Graham |year=2013 |title=The History of Professional Wrestling: The Results WWF 1963–1989 |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform |isbn=978-1-4928-2597-5 |page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the main event of 1980's [[Showdown at Shea#1980|Showdown at Shea]], Sammartino defeated Zbyszko inside a steel cage.&lt;ref name="WWFresults309"/&gt; In his autobiography, [[Hulk Hogan]] claimed that his match with [[André the Giant]] was the real reason for the huge draw at Shea Stadium; however, the [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] between Sammartino and Zbyszko sold out everywhere in the build-up to the show. In contrast, Hogan and André headlined exactly one card in [[White Plains, New York]] before they wrestled at Shea, and they drew a paltry 1,200 in a building that held 3,500.&lt;ref name=WWF6389Book&gt;{{cite book |last=Cawthon |first=Graham |year=2013 |title=the History of Professional Wrestling Vol 1: WWF 1963–1989 |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform |isbn=978-1492825975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sammartino retired from North American wrestling full-time in 1981,&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; in a match that opened the [[Meadowlands Arena]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]. Sammartino pinned George "The Animal" Steele in his match. Sammartino then finished up his full-time career by touring Japan.

=== Return to WWF (1984–1988) ===
It was during this time Sammartino found out through [[Angelo Savoldi]], a recently fired office employee of Capitol Wrestling Corporation, that he had been cheated by Vince McMahon Sr. on the promised gate percentages for his entire second title run. Sammartino filed suit against McMahon and his Capitol Wrestling Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wrestlingperspective.com/legal/sammartino.html Bruno Sammartino v. Capitol Wrestling Corporation and Vince McMahon]. Wrestlingperspective.com (August 26, 1983). Retrieved on September 29, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The suit was eventually settled out of court by McMahon's son, [[Vince McMahon]] after his father had died, and included an agreement for Sammartino to return to the company as a commentator.&lt;ref name=CBSremembers/&gt;

At the inaugural [[WrestleMania I|WrestleMania]] at a sold out Madison Square Garden in 1985, Sammartino was in his son [[David Sammartino|David]]'s corner for his match against [[Brutus Beefcake]].&lt;ref name=timesherald&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesherald.com/sports/20180418/professional-wrestling-great-bruno-sammartino-dies-at-82|title=Professional wrestling great Bruno Sammartino dies at 82|date=April 18, 2018|accessdate=April 19, 2018|work=[[The Times Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match ended in a double-disqualification after the Sammartinos began brawling with Beefcake and his [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] Johnny Valiant. He returned to in-ring action soon after with his son, as they wrestled against Beefcake and Valiant at Madison Square Garden. The Sammartinos also teamed against "Mr. Wonderful" [[Paul Orndorff]] and [[Bobby Heenan|Bobby "The Brain" Heenan]] in various arenas.

Sammartino's highest-profile feud during this run was with "Macho Man" [[Randy Savage]]. An irate Sammartino attacked Savage during a TV interview, after Savage bragged about injuring [[Ricky Steamboat]], by driving the timekeeper's bell into Steamboat's throat during a televised match. Sammartino defeated Savage in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Lumberjack match|lumberjack match]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship]] via disqualification at the [[Boston Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cawthon |first=Graham |year=2013 |title=The History of Professional Wrestling: The Results WWF 1963–1989 |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform |isbn=978-1-4928-2597-5 |page=620}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed Savage to keep the championship, as titles cannot change hands via countout or disqualification. He was often teamed with [[Tito Santana]] and his old enemy George "The Animal" Steele (who was a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] at this point in his career) to wrestle Savage and [[Adrian Adonis|"Adorable" Adrian Adonis]]. The climax of their feud came was a victory for Sammartino and Santana in a steel cage match in Madison Square Garden. Sammartino also engaged in a feud with "Rowdy" [[Roddy Piper]] after Piper insulted his heritage on a segment of ''[[Piper's Pit]]'' at Madison Square Garden. Sammartino faced Piper in both singles and tag team matches. Sammartino teamed with Paul Orndorff in his matches against Piper, while Piper would tag with his "bodyguard", [[Bob Orton Jr.|Ace "Cowboy" Bob Orton]]. Sammartino would eventually get the upper hand in the feud, by defeating Piper in a steel cage match at the Boston Garden. In 1986, Sammartino competed in a 20-man battle royal at [[WrestleMania 2]] at the [[Rosemont Horizon]] in Chicago.&lt;ref name=timesherald/&gt;

Sammartino's final match was at a WWF house show in Baltimore on August 29, 1987, where he teamed up with Hulk Hogan to defeat [[King Kong Bundy]] and [[One Man Gang]] in the main event. Sammartino continued doing commentary on ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars of Wrestling]]'' until March 1988.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;

=== Non-wrestling roles and WWE Hall of Fame (1988–2018)===
After leaving the WWF, Sammartino became an outspoken critic of the path on which Vince McMahon has taken professional wrestling. He particularly criticized the use of steroids and "vulgar" storylines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/oct20_bruno.html|title=Sammartino no fan of McMahon|date=October 20, 1999|last=Molinaro|first=John|accessdate=April 22, 2018|work=Slam!

Sammartino worked as a commentator for the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams)|Universal Wrestling Federation]]. On October 28, 1989, Sammartino made a special appearance at the NWA [[pay-per-view]] event [[Halloween Havoc (1989)|Halloween Havoc]], where he was the [[Referee (professional wrestling)#Special referees|special guest referee]] in a "[[Professional wrestling match types#Thundercage|Thunderdome]]" cage match which featured [[Ric Flair]] and [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] taking on [[Terry Funk]] and [[Keiji Mutoh|The Great Muta]].&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; Sammartino worked several WCW events in a minor analysis role in the early 1990s, as well as a brief run doing color commentary with [[Jim Ross]] on ''[[WCW Saturday Night|Saturday Night]]'' in 1992. He also acted as special guest referee in [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) for a series of matches between Flair and Randy Savage in June 1996.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;

In 2006, he signed an independent deal with [[Jakks Pacific]] to produce an [[action figure]], which is part of the WWE Classic Superstars line, Series 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Where legends are displayed |publisher=Classicfigs.com |url=http://www.classicfigs.com/CS10/sing-10-BS.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210022315/http://www.classicfigs.com/CS10/sing-10-BS.html |archivedate=February 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 25, 2010, Sammartino was honored at the 74th annual Dapper Dan Dinner, a popular awards and charity fundraising event in Pittsburgh, with a lifetime achievement award, for which fellow former ''[[Studio Wrestling]]'' personalities [[Bill Cardille]], [[Johnny De Fazio|"Jumping" Johnny De Fazio]], [[Dominic DeNucci]], Frank Durso, and [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] [[Andy DePaul|Andy "Kid" DePaul]] were all present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dvorchak |first=Robert |date=March 26, 2010 |title=Dapper Dan: Malkin, Sammartino, Penn State volleyball claim awards |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10085/1045805-61.stm |accessdate=March 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Sammartino accepted an invitation for induction into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]], after having declined several times in prior years.

In the late 1960s, Sammartino was involved in a fight with former Pennsylvania Athletic Commissioner Joe Cimino. Cimino was new to his post and intervened in a match finish involving Sammartino, who took a shot at Cimino in the ring and the argument continued backstage. Sammartino ended up in a screaming match with Cimino on Pittsburgh's local ''Studio Wrestling'' program, and Cimino suspended him for a month. Sam Muchnick mentioned the incident in his book, ''Wrestling Babylon''.&lt;ref name=Muchnick2011&gt;{{cite book |last=Muchnick |first=Sam |year=2011 |title=Wrestling Babylon |publisher=ECW Press |location=New York |isbn=978-1-55022-761-1 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiography, ''The Cowboy and the Cross: The Bill Watts Story: Rebellion, Wrestling and Redemption'', [[Bill Watts]] told of witnessing a backstage incident between Sammartino and Gorilla Monsoon.&lt;ref name=Watts2006&gt;{{cite book |last=Watts |first=Bill |year=2006 |title=The Cowboy and the Cross:The Bill Watts Story: Rebellion, Wrestling and Redemption |publisher=ECW Press |location=New York |isbn=978-1-55022-708-6 |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watts wrote that Monsoon "soon found himself in deep water" when messing with Sammartino, and he did not go into further detail on the incident out of respect for Monsoon.&lt;ref name=Watts2006/&gt;

On July 26, 2004, Sammartino and Ric Flair were involved in the "Who snubbed who?" non-confrontation at the [[Mellon Arena]] in Pittsburgh. Flair had denigrated Sammartino's wrestling ability in his book ''[[To Be the Man]]''.&lt;ref name=Flair2005&gt;{{cite book |last=Flair |first=Ric |year=2005 |title=Ric Flair: to Be the Man |publisher=Pocket Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7434-9181-5 |pages=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flair said Sammartino refused to shake his hand at the event, while Sammartino said Flair saw him coming down the hall, turned, and rushed away.&lt;ref name=Flair2005/&gt;

The '''''Byelorussian Soviet Encyclopedia''''' ({{lang-be|Беларуская Савецкая Энцыклапедыя}}) is the first universal encyclopaedia in the [[Belarusian language]] in 12 volumes printed in [[Minsk]] from 1969 to 1975. 

More than five thousand authors wrote for the encyclopedia, including 125 academics and members of the [[Academy of Sciences of Belarus|Academy of Sciences of the BSSR]] or of the [[Academy of Sciences of the USSR]] and its branches. More than 85% of authors lived and worked in the [[Byelorussian SSR]].
 
The first eleven volumes contain encyclopedic articles; the twelfth was dedicated to the BSSR. The total number of articles in the encyclopedia numbered 34,409, of which about 40% devoted to Belarusian subjects. 
Around six thousand articles are about history, around ten thousand on the natural sciences, about 6.7 thousand on geography, around 6.8 thousand on culture, and around seven thousand  biographies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3701">'''The Center For Equal Opportunity''' (CEO) is an [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservative]] [[think tank]], which focuses on three specific areas of concern: [[affirmative action]], [[immigration]] and [[bilingual education]].

The Chairman of the Center For Equal Opportunity is [[Linda Chavez]], the President and General Counsel is  [[Roger Clegg]], and the Executive Director is Rudy Gersten, Chavez's son.&lt;ref&gt;http://townhall.com/columnists/rudygersten/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Focus Areas==
===Voting Policies===
The CEO is proactive in the laws governing redistricting policies. They see redistricting sections to help a candidate win, whether minority or a majority member, as immoral. They have assembled resources to aid those interested in monitoring the process, and has a list of organisations that specialize in these issues.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/2011/11/02/141931700/in-redistricting-where-do-50-million-latinos-fit&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dailycaller.com/2011/11/22/artur-davis-racial-redistricting-hurts-voters/&lt;/ref&gt;

They also take an active stance in concern to the voting rights of rehabilitated felons. They believe the right to vote should be reinstated after the fulfillment of the sentence, under the condition they go through a process of review.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pacificlegal.org/page.aspx?pid=1204&lt;/ref&gt; Clegg believes that ex-felons' voting rights should not be restored automatically, but rather on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/19/opinion/allowing-felons-to-vote.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Politics&amp;region=Footer&amp;module=Recommendation&amp;src=recg&amp;pgtype=article&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Issues===
The Center also focuses on other issues related to race and ethnicity. Some recent issues that have come to light include the continual usage of desegregation policies that are 50 years old and hinder school effectiveness, usage of disparate impact laws that damage neutral policies and practices, and the issue of reparations for those that have been discriminated against.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailypage.com/daily/article.php?article=34650&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charlotte Mary Yonge''' (1823–1901) was an English novelist who wrote to the service of the church. Her books helped to spread the influence of the [[Oxford Movement]]. Her abundant work is mostly out of print.

==Life==
Charlotte Mary Yonge was born in [[Otterbourne]], Hampshire, England, on 11 August 1823 to William Yonge and Fanny Yonge, ''née'' Bargus.{{sfn|Hayter|1996|p=vii}} She was educated at home by her father, studying Latin, Greek, French, [[Euclid]], and algebra.{{sfn|Coleridge|1903|pp=107–108}} Her father's lessons could be harsh:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
He required a diligence and accuracy that were utterly alien to me. He thundered at me so that nobody could bear to hear it, and often reduced me to tears, but his approbation was so delightful that it was a delicious stimulus... I believe, in spite of all breezes over my innate slovenliness, it would have broken our hearts to leave off working together. And we went on till I was some years past twenty.{{sfn|Coleridge|1903|p=108}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yonge's devotion to her father was lifelong and her relationship with him seems to have been for her the standard for all other relationships, including marriage.{{sfn|Sturrock|1995|pp=17–18}} His "approbation was throughout life my bliss; his anger my misery for the time."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{harvnb|Sturrock|1995|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was born into a religious family background, was devoted to the High Church, and much influenced by [[John Keble]], Vicar of [[Hursley]] from 1835, a near neighbour and one of the leaders of the [[Oxford Movement]]. Yonge is herself sometimes referred to as "the novelist of the Oxford Movement",{{sfn|Dennis|1992}} as her novels frequently reflect the values and concerns of [[Anglo-Catholicism]]. She remained in Otterbourne all her life and for 71 years was a teacher in the village [[Sunday school]].{{sfn|Cross|1957|p=1484}} She lived in a house called ''Elderfield'' (which became a grade 2 listed building in 1984).

[[File:Charlotte Mary Yonge.jpg|thumb|Yonge, {{circa|1845}}]]
In 1868 a new parish was formed to the south of Yonge's home village of Otterbourne; the parish was to contain the villages of Eastley and Barton. Yonge donated £500 towards the [[parish church]] and was asked to choose which of the two villages the parish should be named after. She chose Eastley, but decided that it should be spelt ''[[Eastleigh]]'' as she perceived this as being more modern.&lt;ref name="lambert"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lambert |first=Tim |title=A Brief History of Eastleigh |url=http://www.localhistories.org/eastleigh.html |website=A World History Encyclopedia |access-date=7 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yonge died in her home town of Otterbourne on 24 May 1901. Her obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Charlotte Yonge: Her Life and Context |url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/c.e.schultze/context/obituary.html |publisher=Charlotte Mary Yonge Fellowship |access-date=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Her friends, and especially her poorer neighbours, knew both the strength and the winning charm of her character. Thus the late Archbishop Benson noted in his diary her 'odd majesty and kindliness, which are very strong'.

But it is of course as a writer that Miss Yonge will be remembered. She had an inventive mind and a ready pen, and a bare list of the books written or edited by her would probably occupy nearly a whole column of The Times. She wrote chiefly for young people, especially young girls, and her books are the result not only of a strong ethical purpose, but also of her firm devotion to the High Church view of Christian doctrine and practice.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Literary career==
She began writing in 1848, and published during her long life about 160 works, chiefly novels.{{sfn|Cross|1957|p=1484}} Her first commercial success, ''[[The Heir of Redclyffe]]'' (1853), provided the funding to enable the schooner ''[[Southern Cross (Melanesian Mission ship series)|Southern Cross]]'' to be put into service on behalf of [[George Augustus Selwyn|George Selwyn]]. Similar charitable works were done with the profits from later novels. Yonge was also a founder and editor for forty years of ''[[Monthly Packet|The Monthly Packet]]'', a magazine (founded in 1851) with a varied readership, but targeted at British Anglican girls (in later years it was addressed to a somewhat wider readership).&lt;ref name=gos/&gt;

[[File:Picture of Charlotte Mary Yonge.jpg|thumb|Charlotte Mary Yonge later in life]]
Among the best known of her works are ''The Heir of Redclyffe'', ''Heartsease'', and ''The Daisy Chain''. ''A Book of Golden Deeds'' is a collection of true stories of courage and self-sacrifice. She also wrote ''Cameos from English History'', ''Life of [[John Coleridge Patteson]]: Missionary Bishop of the Melanesian Islands'', and ''[[Hannah More]]''. Her ''History of Christian Names'' was described as "the first serious attempt at tackling the subject" and as the standard work on names in the preface to the first edition of Withycombe's ''The Oxford Dictionary of English Christian Names'' (1944).

Around 1859 Yonge created a literary group made up of younger girl cousins in order that they could write essays and gain advice from Yonge on their writing. Together they created "The Barnacle" and this collaboration continued until about 1871. This was valuable as this may have been the last generation of girls to be educated at home.&lt;ref name="NelsonVallone2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Claudia Nelson|author2=Lynne Vallone|title=The Girl's Own: Cultural Histories of the Anglo-American Girl, 1830-1915|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HYleSwnEuRQC&amp;pg=PA77|date=1 June 2010|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-3695-4|pages=72–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her god-daughter, [[Alice Coleridge|Alice Mary Coleridge]] contributed as the name of "Gurgoyle" from the first issue drawing the covers and contributing translations, articles and verses.&lt;ref name=gos/&gt;

Her personal example and influence on her god-daughter, [[Alice Coleridge|Alice Mary Coleridge]], played a formative role in Coleridge's zeal for women's education and thus, indirectly, led to the foundation of [[Abbots Bromley School for Girls]].&lt;ref name=gos&gt;Chancellor, V. (2004-09-23). Coleridge, Alice Mary (1846–1907), promoter of girls' schools. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Retrieved 22 Dec. 2017, see [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-48674 link]&lt;/ref&gt;

After her death, her friend, assistant and collaborator, [[Christabel Coleridge]], published the biographical ''Charlotte Mary Yonge: her Life and Letters'' (1903).

==Reputation==

Yonge's work was widely read and respected in the nineteenth century. Among her admirers were [[Lewis Carroll]], [[George Eliot]], [[William Ewart Gladstone]], [[Charles Kingsley]], [[Christina Rossetti]], [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], and [[Anthony Trollope]].{{sfn|Hayter|1996|p=1}} [[William Morris]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] read ''[[The Heir of Redclyffe]]'' aloud to each other while undergraduates at Oxford University and "took [the hero, Guy Morville's] medieval tastes and chivalric ideals as presiding elements in the formation of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]]."{{sfn|Hayter|1996|p=2}} Yonge's work was compared favourably with that of Trollope, [[Jane Austen]], [[Honoré de Balzac]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], and [[Émile Zola]].{{sfn|Hayter|1996|p=2}}

[[John Marriott (British politician)|Sir John Arthur Ransome Marriott]] wrote of her:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Charlotte Yonge (1823–1902) was not only a prolific novelist, but a serious student of history, especially in its personal aspects. Having dealt in ''The Constable's Tower'' with Hubert de Burgh, with his famous defence of Dover Castle against Prince Louis of France (1213), and his still more famous victory at sea off Sandwich, and with Edward I as a crusader (''The Prince and the Page''), Miss Yonge drew on the ''Vie de Bertrand du Guesclin'' as well as on Froissart for her fascinating tale ''The Lances of Lynwood''. With characteristic modesty she expressed the hope that her sketch might "serve as an inducement to some young readers to make acquaintance with the delectable old Canon (Froissart) for themselves". The wise, of all ages, will fulfil her hope.{{sfn|Marriott|1940|p=68}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So popular were her works that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A [[midshipman]] was able to supply from memory a missing page in his ship's copy of ''The Daisy Chain''. An officer in the Guards, asked in a game of "Confessions" what his prime object in life was, answered that it was to make himself like Guy Morville, hero of ''The Heir of Redclyffe''.{{sfn|Hayter|1996|pp=1–2}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[C. S. Lewis]] thought very highly of Yonge, at one point bracketing her evocations of domestic life with those of [[Homer]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]].{{sfn|Lewis|1949|p=31}}

[[Abraham Kuyper]], who read ''The Heir of Redclyffe'' on the recommendation of his fiancé, Johanna Schaay, found it to be a very moving experience and wrote that the novel was "next to the [[Bible]] in its meaning for my life."{{sfn|Kuyper|1998|p=51}}

According to critic Catherine Sandbach-Dahlström, Yonge's work has been "constantly be-deviled" by a "tendency to confuse the moral quality of [her] view of life with the quality of her literary expression".{{sfn|Sandbach-Dahlström|1984|p=3}}

Yonge's work has been little studied, with the possible exception of ''The Heir of Redclyffe''.{{sfn|Sandbach-Dahlström|1984|p=8}}

This '''comparison of programming languages (array)''' compares the features of [[array data structure]]s or [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] processing for over 48 various computer [[programming language]]s.

== Syntax ==

=== Array dimensions ===

The following list contains [[programming language syntax|syntax]] examples of how to determine the dimensions (index of the first element, the last element or the size in elements).

Note particularly that some languages index from zero while others index from one.  At least since Dijkstra's famous essay,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD831.html&lt;/ref&gt; zero-based indexing has been seen as superior, and new languages tend to use it.

===Slicing===

The following list contains syntax examples of how a range of element of an array can be accessed.

In the following table:
*&lt;tt&gt;first&lt;/tt&gt; - the index of the first element in the slice
*&lt;tt&gt;last&lt;/tt&gt; - the index of the last element in the slice
*&lt;tt&gt;end&lt;/tt&gt; - one more than the index of last element in the slice
*&lt;tt&gt;len&lt;/tt&gt; - the length of the slice (= end - first)
*&lt;tt&gt;step&lt;/tt&gt; - the number of array elements in each (default 1)

== Vectorized array operations ==

Some compiled languages such as [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] and [[Fortran]], and some scripting languages such as [[IDL (programming language)|IDL]], [[MATLAB]], and [[S-Lang (programming library)|S-Lang]], have native support for vectorized operations on arrays.  For example, to perform an element by element sum of two arrays, &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;b&lt;/tt&gt; to produce a third &lt;tt&gt;c&lt;/tt&gt;, it is only necessary to write
&lt;pre&gt;
    c = a + b
&lt;/pre&gt;
In addition to support for vectorized arithmetic and relational operations, these languages also vectorize common mathematical functions such as sine. For example, if &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; is an array, then
&lt;pre&gt;
    y = sin (x)
&lt;/pre&gt;
will result in an array &lt;tt&gt;y&lt;/tt&gt; whose elements are sine of the corresponding elements of the array &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt;.

Vectorized index operations are also supported.  As an example,
&lt;source lang="fortran"&gt;
    even = x(2::2);
    odd = x(::2);
&lt;/source&gt;
is how one would use [[Fortran]] to create arrays from the even and odd entries of an array.  Another common use of vectorized indices is a filtering operation.  Consider a clipping operation of a sine wave where amplitudes larger than 0.5 are to be set to 0.5.  Using [[S-Lang (programming library)|S-Lang]], this can be done by
&lt;pre&gt;
    y = sin(x);
    y[where(abs(y)&gt;0.5)] = 0.5;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;ref name="s2"&gt;Slices of the type &lt;code&gt;''first'':''last'':''step''&lt;/code&gt; are also supported.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="s3"&gt;More generally, for 1-d arrays [[Perl]] and [[S-Lang (programming library)|S-Lang]] allow slices of the form&lt;code&gt;''array''[''indices'']&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;''indices''&lt;/code&gt; can be a range such mentioned in footnote 2 or an explicit list of indices, e.g., '&lt;code&gt;[0,9,3,4]&lt;/code&gt;', or a mix of both, e.g., &lt;code&gt;A[[[0:3]],7,9,[11:2:-3]]]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="s4"&gt;&lt;tt&gt;''last''&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;''end''&lt;/tt&gt; may be a negative number, indicating to stop at the corresponding number of places before the end of the array.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="cr1"&gt;Size can only be chosen on initialization after which it is fixed&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="cr2"&gt;Allows arrays of arrays which can be used to emulate most—but not all—aspects multi-dimensional arrays&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="cr3"&gt;Size can only be chosen on initialization when memory is allocated on the heap, as distinguished from when it is allocated on the stack. This note need not be made for a language that always allocates arrays on the heap&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="cr4"&gt;C99 allows for variable size arrays; however there is almost no compiler available to support this new feature&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="cr5"&gt;This list is strictly comparing language features. In every language (even assembler) it is possible to provide improved array handling via add on libraries. This language has improved array handling as part of its standard library&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="cr6"&gt;The class Array is fixed-size, but OrderedCollection is dynamic&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="cr7"&gt;The indexing base can be 0 or 1 as per the System Variable &lt;tt&gt;⎕IO&lt;/tt&gt;.  This value may apply to the whole "workspace", or be localized to a user-defined function or a single primitive function by use of the Variant operator (&lt;tt&gt;⍠&lt;/tt&gt;)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="cr8"&gt;At least 2 dimensions (scalar numbers are 1×1 arrays, vectors are 1×n or n×1 arrays)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="cr9"&gt;Allows creating fixed-size arrays in "unsafe" code, allowing enhanced [[interoperability]] with other language&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="cr10"&gt;Varies by implementation. Newer implementations (FreePascal, Object Pascal (Delphi)) allow heap-based dynamic arrays&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="cr11"&gt;Behaviour can be tuned via compiler switches. As in DMD 1.0 bounds are checked in debug mode and unchecked in release mode for efficiency&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="cr12"&gt;Almost all Fortran implementations offer bounds checking options via compiler switches.  However by default, bounds checking is usually turned off for efficiency&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="cr13"&gt;Many implementations (Turbo Pascal, Object Pascal (Delphi), FreePascal) allow the behaviour to be changed by compiler switches and in-line directives&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="cr14"&gt;COBOL provides a way to specify that the usable size of an array is variable, but this can never be greater than the declared maximum size, which is also the allocated size&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="cr15"&gt;Most Common Lisp implementations allow checking to be selectively disabled&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="cr16"&gt;The index type can be a freely chosen [[integer (computer science)|integer type]], [[enumerated type]], or [[character (computing)|character type]]. For arrays with non-compact index types see: [[Associative array]]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="cr17"&gt;The default base index is the lowest value of the index type used&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="cr18"&gt;Standard [[Perl]] array data types do not support vectorized operations as defined here.  However, the [[Perl Data Language]] extension adds array objects with this ability&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="cr19"&gt;The standard [[Python (programming language)|Python]] array type, &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;, does not support vectorized operations as defined here.  However, the [[numpy]] extension adds array objects with this ability&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="cr20"&gt;By specifying a base index, arrays at an arbitrary base can be created. However, by default, Lua's length operator does not consider the base index of the array when calculating the length. This behavior can be changed via metamethods&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="cr21"&gt;FreeBASIC supports both variable array lengths and fixed length arrays.  Arrays declared with no index range are created as variable-length arrays, while arrays with a declared range are created as fixed-length arrays&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="cr22"&gt;In these languages, one can access or write to an array index greater than or equal to the length of the array, and the array will implicitly grow to that size. This may appear at first as if the bounds are not checked; however, the bounds are checked in order to decide to grow the array, and you do not have unsafe memory access like you do in C&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="cr23"&gt;PHP's "arrays" are associative arrays. You can use integers and strings as the keys (indexes); floats can also be used as the key but are truncated to integers. There is not really any "base index" or "bounds"&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="cr24"&gt;Haskell arrays (Data.Array) allow using any type which is an instance of Ix as index type. So a custom type can be defined and used as an index type as long as it instances Ix. Also, tuples of Ix types are also Ix types; this is commonly used to implement multi-dimensional arrays&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="cr25"&gt;ALGOL 68 arrays must be subscripted (and sliced) by type &lt;tt&gt;INT&lt;/tt&gt;. However a hash function could be used to convert other types to &lt;tt&gt;INT&lt;/tt&gt;.  e.g. &lt;tt&gt;name'''['''hash("string")''']'''&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="cr26"&gt;Because C does not bound-check indices, a pointer to the interior of any array can be defined that will symbolically act as a pseudo-array that accommodates negative indices or any integer index origin&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="cr27"&gt;COBOL arrays may be indexed with "INDEX" types, distinct from integer types&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="cr28"&gt;While COBOL only has arrays-of-arrays, array elements can be accessed with a multi-dimensional-array-like syntax, where the language automatically matches the indexes to the arrays enclosing the item being referenced&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="cr29"&gt;While Golang's Array type is not dynamically sized, the data type [https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/7 Slice] is dynamically-sized and is much more common in use than arrays.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="dotnetarray"&gt;The base can be changed when using the &lt;tt&gt;System.Array&lt;/tt&gt; type, but not with &lt;tt&gt;T[]&lt;/tt&gt; (C# syntax).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="xpath"&gt;XPath/XQuery has two kinds of arrays. ''Sequences'' &lt;tt&gt;(1,2,3)&lt;/tt&gt; which cannot nest and in the XPath/XQuery 3.1 version ''arrays'' &lt;tt&gt;array { 1,2,3 }&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;[1,2,3]&lt;/tt&gt; which can.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ContractExpress''' is a [[document automation]] program designed and developed by [[Business Integrity Ltd.]], a company focused on contract automation&lt;ref name="Why going online is better for everyone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article544656.ece |title=Why going online is better for everyone By Richard Susskind |publisher=The Sunday Times |date=2005-07-19 |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in the UK and the US. ContractExpress is available for SharePoint on-premises or in the cloud, for Salesforce, and as a stand-alone app in a private or public cloud. Users of the product are typically law firms and corporations, such as Clifford Chance and Microsoft.&lt;ref name="Business Integrity Customers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidecounsel.com/Issues/2010/July-2010/Pages/Document-Assembly-System-Provides-Efficiency.aspx?page=1 |title=Inside Counsel: Document Assembly Speeds Contract Process | accessdate=2010-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functionality ==
ContractExpress template creation is conducted entirely within a [[Microsoft Word]] interface. As a Microsoft Word App, ContractExpress Author integrates into the Microsoft Word ribbon, providing a familiar user experience for users creating templates in all ContractExpress products. The add-in provides the ease and speed of automating complex legal documents without the complexity inherent in traditional document assembly tools. Further, generated documents automatically inherit their styling from the marked-up Word document without having to apply styles to each generated document.&lt;ref name="Law.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/lawtechnologynews/PubArticleLTN.jsp?id=1202458746868 |title=Law.com: Sum of Parts | date=2010-06-01 | accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Authors create a contract template using bracket-based markups to specify conditional text and variable fields for us in their customized templates.

Once published, other users can then manipulate the document using a pre-defined questionnaire to apply client specific details and preferences. Accordingly, the need for programming skills is removed; a basic knowledge of document mark-up is all that is required.&lt;ref name="AdamsDrafting: Business Integrity Launches ContractExpress.Com" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adamsdrafting.com/2010/02/10/business-integrity-launches-contractexpress-dot-com/ |title=AdamsDrafting: Business Integrity Launches ContractExpress.Com | accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable that the field control used is derived from the conventions of traditional legal document mark-up, for example use of square brackets to indicate areas for document specific information.&lt;ref name="Legal IT Professionals"&gt;(Press Release)  {{citation |url = http://www.legalitprofessionals.com/America-news/new-document-assembly-features-put-contractexpresscom-at-the-heart-of-law-firms-interactions-with-clients.html|title = Legal IT Professionals: New Document Assembly Features Put ContractExpress.com at the Heart of Law Firms’ Interactions with Clients|date = 2010-10-02|accessdate = 2010-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent version of the software is version 5.x, released in 2015. It includes significant updates to the user interface and customer extranet features, as well as improved compatibility with tablets and smartphones.

'''''Dead Island: Official Announcement Trailer''''' is an [[advertisement|announcement trailer]] for the 2011 video game ''[[Dead Island]]'', which was developed by [[Techland]] and published by [[Deep Silver]]. The story of the trailer follows a family who is attacked by a horde of zombies in a hotel. The trailer ends with the infected daughter, who has turned into a zombie, being thrown to her death from a hotel window. The trailer was produced by Glasgow-based Axis Animation, with music created by [[Giles Lamb]].

The trailer was designed to be emotional, allowing players to care for the characters and to be distinct from trailers for the game's competitors. The trailer does not show any actual gameplay, instead telling a short story about the game's world and the background behind its events. The development team also had the goal to show the inevitability and the helplessness of a family in a zombie outbreak. Upon its release on February 16, 2011, the trailer sparked public interest, and the community reaction led Techland to adjust the content of the actual game. It was met with a mixed reception from critics. Praise was directed at the trailer's new ideas, story, immersion and tone, however, it received criticism for lacking gameplay information and its depiction of a dead child. The trailer received multiple awards upon release.

==Plot==
The story is presented in [[Reverse chronology|reverse chronological order]] and in [[slow motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2011/03/23/dead-island-there-is-an-apocalypse-happening/|title=Dead Island: "There is an apocalypse happening"|first=Keza|last=MacDonald|work=[[VG247]]|date=March 23, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/videos/dead-island-cgi-trailer/2300-6299756/|title=Dead Island CGI Trailer|first=Dan|last= Mihoerck |date=February 17, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015|work=[[GameSpot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer follows a family, consisting of a father, a mother and a daughter, visiting Banoi, an island paradise. After they have settled in a hotel, an unexpected [[zombie outbreak]] occurs.&lt;ref name="Kok"/&gt; The daughter is running away from the horde of zombies in the hotel's corridor and dashing towards her room, where her father and mother are staying, when she is caught. A zombie bites the daughter's legs, causing her to become infected with the zombie virus.

The father opens the door and picks up a [[fire axe]] to fight against zombies. He rescues his daughter and brings her inside the hotel room. After placing the injured daughter on a bed, the couple begin fighting the zombies who are breaking into the room. The zombies overwhelm them, and the daughter turns into a zombie and attacks her father, biting him on the neck.  To defend himself, the father struggles, trying to push her off, until he throws her out of the window, breaking the glass. The daughter dies on impact with the ground. While the father is struggling, the mother is attacked and eaten by several zombies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZqrG1bdGtg|title=Dead Island: Official Announcement Trailer|work=[[IGN]]|date=February 16, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corpses of the couple can be seen in a hotel room in the beginning of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5837416/the-final-moments-of-that-heartbreaking-dead-island-family-discovered-in-the-game|title=The Final Moments of That Heartbreaking Dead Island Family Discovered in the Game|first=Brian|last=Crecente|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=September 6, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
''[[Dead Island]]'', originally announced in 2007 by Techland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/08/08/dead-island-details-rescued|title=Dead Island Details Rescued|first=Daemon|last=Hatfield|work=[[IGN]]|date=August 8, 2007|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[action role-playing game|action role-playing]] [[survival horror]] video game. Set in a zombie-infested tropical island called Banoi, the game focuses heavily on melee combat. According to Techland, it was a game about killing zombies, not a game focused on delivering an emotional experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5775798/that-heartbreaking-dead-island-family-theyre-not-in-the-game|title=That Heartbreaking Dead Island Family?

The trailer was produced and made by the [[Glasgow]]-based Axis Animation, which had previously created trailers for ''[[Killzone 2]]'' and ''[[Mass Effect 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.develop-online.net/news/dead-island-trailer-creators-revealed/0108748|title=Dead Island trailer creators revealed|first=Rob|last=Crossley|work=[[Develop (magazine)|Develop]]|date=February 17, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stuart Aitken, Axis's Managing Director and Technical Director and the director of the trailer, [[Deep Silver]] gave the team a lot of creative freedom and flexibility in creating the trailer, allowing them to create their own characters instead of using the in-game protagonists.&lt;ref name="Line"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.list.co.uk/article/37118-dead-island/|title=Dead Island: The game behind the stunning trailer, developed by Axis Animation and Savalas, is finally ready for release|first=Henry|last=Northmore|work=[[The List (magazine)|The List]]|date=August 25, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep Silver had given them a script and general ideas for them to follow, and the team expanded upon it. In order to make the trailer feel [[non-linear]] and focused, the team decided to narrow down the trailer's location to only a single hotel room.&lt;ref name="G4TV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/710713/dead-island-the-making-of-an-amazing-video-game-trailer/|title=Dead Island: The Making Of An Amazing Video Game Trailer|first=Anthony|last=Hernandez|work=[[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4TV]]|date=February 22, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep Silver wanted the trailer to have some exterior environment. As a result, the team added a segment which has the daughter falling from the hotel window; in the process, audiences glimpse the island setting.&lt;ref name="Dev"/&gt;

The team hoped that despite the short duration of the trailer, audiences would understand the story and be connected with its characters. They decided that it would be easy for players to identify with a family and that a story involving parents and children could convey the message quickly.&lt;ref name="G4TV"/&gt; They intended to use the trailer to depict the background information of the game, presenting information regarding the "discovery" of the outbreak, its inevitability,&lt;ref name="Dev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.develop-online.net/interview/how-we-made-the-gore-ballet-dead-island-trailer/0116981|title=How we made the 'gore ballet' Dead Island trailer|work=[[Develop (magazine)|Develop]]|first=Rob|last=Crossley|date=February 24, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the helplessness of the family. The team had an internal debate on whether the trailer should show guns, ultimately deciding that doing so would distract from the primary goal of the story.&lt;ref name="G4TV"/&gt; The story originally had the mother turn into a zombie, but the team changed it to the daughter, as they considered her more vulnerable when facing a large group of zombies.&lt;ref name="Dev"/&gt; The team was worried that the action and violence featured would seem excessive, and they decided to alleviate the problem by introducing non-chronological storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/109577-Dead-Island-Publisher-Shares-Its-Trailer-Making-Secrets|title=Dead Island Publisher Shares Its Trailer-Making Secrets|first=Logan|last=Westbrook|work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|date=April 29, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep Silver also proposed to mitigate the violence by having the trailer presented in [[slow motion]], as they believed that it could make the action feel "balletic" instead of purely violent.&lt;ref name="Dev"/&gt;

The trailer is made up of [[computer imagery]], and it does not show any actual gameplay footage of ''Dead Island''.&lt;ref name="Line"/&gt; The team hoped to use the trailer as a piece of "artwork", stating influence from the ''Carousel'' trailer from [[Philips]].&lt;ref name="Escapist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/issues/issue_303/8817-The-Ballet-of-Death|first=Robert|last=Rath|title=Rise From Your Grave: The Ballet Of Death|work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|date=April 26, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer was also designed to showcase "great zombie moments" in an effort to attract the genre's supporters.&lt;ref name="Dev"/&gt; The actual game development team used the trailer to build up the mood and atmosphere for the game, and they designed quests which required players to help people who had lost their families. They hoped that the mood would make players feel that they were the only hope existing on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/07/paradise-lost-how-dead-island-hopes-to-live-up-to-emotional-trailer/|title=How Dead Island hopes to live up to emotional trailer|first=Andrew|last=Webster|work=[[Ars Technica]]|date=July 15, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trailer's music was composed by [[Giles Lamb]], who worked for a soundtrack development company called Savalas.&lt;ref name="Line"/&gt; The music was designed to be "somber", "melancholy", and "elegant",&lt;ref name="Dev"/&gt; in contrast with the gore presented in the trailer.&lt;ref name="Line"/&gt; The music was designed to be tense when the trailer is depicting violent action, and beautiful during peaceful moments. The team hoped that the music would create a "juxtaposition between beauty and horror".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2011/02/25/dead-island-cinematic-designer-responds-to-mixed-trailer-reactions.aspx|title=Dead Island Cinematic Designer Responds To Mixed Trailer Reactions|first=Annette|last=Gonzalez|date=February 25, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015|work=[[Game Informer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular reaction to the trailer led Techland to slightly adjust the game's tone, gameplay, and story, as well as the game's promotion strategy.&lt;ref name="Poly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2012/11/14/3537988/dead-island-the-reckoning|title=Dead Island: The Reckoning|first=Russ|last=Pitts|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=February 21, 2012|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="views"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2011/09/02/dead-island-release-trailer/|title=How a viral trailer set up Dead Island as a triple-A game release next week|first=Matthew|last=Lynley|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=September 2, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
A week after the release of the trailer, more than one million people had viewed it through [[YouTube]], exceeding Deep Silver's expectation of only 100,000 views.&lt;ref name="views"/&gt; ''Dead Island'' also became one of the most searched items on [[Google]], [[YouTube]], and [[Twitter]] for several days.&lt;ref name="views"/&gt; Axis was pleasantly surprised at the trailer's popularity.&lt;ref name="Dev"/&gt; Following the trailer's release, ''Dead Island'' became a widely anticipated game.&lt;ref name="views"/&gt;

Many critics praised the trailer's use of reverse storytelling. Keith Stuart from ''[[The Guardian]]'' compared it favorably to [[Coldplay]]'s "[[The Scientist (song)|The Scientist]]", saying that it successfully delivered an affecting and emotive experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/feb/17/dead-island-trailer-controversial|title=Dead Island: Will It Be The Most Controversial Trailer Ever Made|first=Keith|last=Sturat|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=February 17, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Fahey from ''[[Kotaku]]'' called the trailer's use of the dead girl "heartbreaking" and thought that it would be amazing if Techland was able to incorporate these emotional elements into the actual game.&lt;ref name="Kok"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5762287/dead-island-returns-and-a-little-girl-dies|title=The Most Heartbreaking Zombie Video Game Trailer You'll Ever See|first=Mike|last=Fahey|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=February 16, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its graphics and pacing also received commendation.&lt;ref name="Reception"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-problem-with-game-trailers/1100-6365663/|title=The Problem With Game Trailers|first=Laura|last= Parker |date=March 12, 2012|accessdate=October 24, 2015|work=[[GameSpot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer's story was praised for presenting an unconventional take on a zombie apocalypse.&lt;ref name="reception"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2011/09/dead-islands-trailer-was-amazing-appalling-and-enlightening/|title=Dead Island's Trailer Was Amazing, Appalling And Enlightening|first=Kirk|last=Hamilton|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=September 13, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Schreier from ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' said that the trailer had successfully made a saturated genre feel fresh again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/02/dead-island-trailer/|title=Don't Get Caught Up In Dead Island Trailer Hype|first=Jason|last=Schreier|work=[[Wired.co.uk]]|date=February 17, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trailer generated controversy around the depiction of the daughter's death. Fahey said that such elements are something video games usually "shy away from", yet it is presented as a main focus in the trailer.&lt;ref name="Kok"/&gt; Ben Parfitt from ''[[Market for Home Computing and Video Games]]'' found it offensive and thought that the team had stepped across the mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/opinion-that-dead-island-trailer/04843|title=OPINION: That Dead Island trailer|first=Ben|last=Parfitt|work=[[Market for Home Computing and Video Games]]|date=February 17, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defending the trailer, Axis said that their depiction fit the overarching narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/dead-island-trailer-creator-speaks-to-dead-girl-controversy/|title=Dead Island trailer creator speaks to dead girl controversy|first=Matt|last=Bradford|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=February 24, 2011|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Rath from ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' also liked the segment, calling it "deliberate and necessary", and thought that the overall effect would have been significantly hampered if had been removed from the trailer.&lt;ref name="Escapist"/&gt;

The lack of gameplay information was also criticized. Laura Parker found the trailer disconnected from the actual game, with the trailer being misleading by not showing any in-game information, and with the game failing to deliver the same emotional effect as the trailer.&lt;ref name="Reception"/&gt; Daemon Hatfield from [[IGN]] similarly thought that the trailer was not useful in assessing the game's quality and expressed concerns that the game would not be as entertaining and interesting as the trailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/03/04/gdc-is-dead-island-anything-like-its-debut-trailer|title=GDC: Is Dead Island Anything Like Its Debut Trailer|first=Daemon|last=Hatfield|work=[[IGN]]|date=March 3, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon release, many reviewers thought that the trailer had set expectation too high for the actual game, and that the game ended up not meeting expectations.&lt;ref name="reception"/&gt;

The trailer was given a gold award at the [[Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/06/29/dead-island-trailer-wins-gold-award-at-cannes-advertising-fe/|title=Dead Island trailer wins Gold award at Cannes ... advertising festival|first=Christopher|last=Grant|work=[[Joystiq]]|date=June 29, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named by gaming journalists as one of the best video game trailers ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/features/article/ten_of_the_best_cgi_game_trailers.html|title=Ten of the Best CGI Game Trailers|work=VideoGamer.com|date=February 17, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/the-best-game-trailers-of-the-generation-1462534128|title=The Best Game Trailers Of The Generation|first=Kirk|last=Hamilton|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=November 11, 2013|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/11/the-14-best-game-trailers-of-2014|title=The 14 Best Game Trailers Of 2014|first=Marty|last=Silva|work=[[IGN]]|date=December 11, 2014|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
A live-action remake and a recut version of the trailer which shows the story in a chronological order were released by fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/3/5061620/dead-island-trailer-live-action-remake|title=Watch the gloriously gory 'Dead Island' trailer re-enacted in live action|first=Vlad|last=Savov  |date=November 3, 2013|accessdate=October 25, 2015|work=[[The Verge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2011/02/17/dead-island-trailer-re-cut-in-chronological-order.aspx|title=Dead Island Trailer Re-Cut In Chronological Order|first=Matt|last=Helgeson|date=February 17, 2011|accessdate=October 25, 2015|work=[[Game Informer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement trailer also boosted the popularity of Techland and Deep Silver.&lt;ref name="Poly"/&gt; The announcement trailer for ''[[Dead Island: Riptide]]'', released in 2012, featured a similar, depressing tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/dead_island_riptide/b/xbox360/archive/2012/09/18/another-gorgeous-depressing-cg-trailer.aspx|title=Dead Island Riptide: Another Gorgeous, Depressing CG Trailer|first=Tim|last=Turi|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=September 18, 2012|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A trailer for ''[[Goat Simulator]]'' in 2014 also mimicked the format of the ''Dead Island'' announcement trailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/goat-simulator-pulls-a-dead-island-for-its-emotional-launch-trailer-272493.phtml|title=Goat Simulator pulls a Dead Island for its emotional launch trailer|first=Jordan|last=Devore|work=[[Destructoid]]|date=March 26, 2014|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A movie tie-in based on the trailer was once proposed by [[Lionsgate]], though the project was ultimately cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/1/5960827/dead-island-movie-deep-silver|title=Hollywood taking a second stab at a Dead Island movie|first=Michael|last=McWhertor|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=August 1, 2014|accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deep Silver released a musical tribute to the trailer, coinciding with the launch of ''[[Dead Island: Definitive Edition]]'' in May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/heres-a-musical-tribute-to-the-dead-island-trailer-in-case-you-wanted-to-cry-today/?|title=Here's a musical tribute to the Dead Island trailer, in case you wanted to cry today|first=Sam|last=Prett|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=May 31, 2016|accessdate=May 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Empress Bianca''''', the first novel by [[Lady Colin Campbell]], was initially published in June 2005.&lt;ref name=court/&gt; One month later, Arcadia Books, the British publisher, withdrew the book and pulped all unsold copies in reaction to a legal threat initiated on behalf of [[Lily Safra]] under her interpretation that the book was a defamatory [[roman à clef]]. After some changes the book was republished in the United States in 2008 by Dynasty Press.

==Plot==
Bianca Barrett, the protagonist and daughter of a Welsh Surveyor and his Palestinian wife, becomes an "ambitious and mercenary" social climber and double murderess. Charming and well-educated, Bianca marries four times and advances in wealth and social influence. 

With Bernardo, her first husband, Bianca has three children; they lose their son in a car crash. After a divorce, she marries the rich Fredie whose family owns the Piedraplata commercial empire. Before it comes to a divorce, the second husband is shot and killed by a hitman who makes it look like a suicide. The killing is arranged by her lover, Phillipe Mahfud, and Bianca becomes the financial beneficiary. 

After a brief marriage to husband number three – she had married him only to make Mahfud jealous-, she lastly marries Mahfud, a rich Iraqi businessman and banker. When their relationship sours, the banker dies with his nurse in a mysterious fire in his apartment in the tax haven of [[Andorra]]. Bianca's lawyers pay off the police and investigators, and the only justice that remains is in the court of public opinion.

==Pulping of first edition==
In July 2005, Lily Safra claimed that her life had been "stolen" by the book and had her lawyer, [[Anthony Julius]], demand that the publisher should recall the book and destroy unsold copies.&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barnes|first1=Anthony|last2=Pyke|first2=Nicholas   |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/pulp-fiction-the-millionaire-socialite-the-english-lady-and-a-book-too-far-500003.html|title= Pulp fiction: the millionaire socialite, the English Lady and a book too far.  |publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=24 July 2005|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julius' letter indicated that Safra "regarded the book as defamatory".&lt;ref name=vincent&gt;{{cite book| author=[[Isabel Vincent]] |title=Golden Lily |publisher=HarperCollinsPublishers, 2010| pages=267f |ISBN=978-0-06-113393-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[English defamation law]] puts the burden of proof on the defendant, Arcadia Books complied indicating that they were too small a company to fight the looming legal battle.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; The author, however, denied that she had used Safra's life as a template and claimed that it was based on characters of her own family, including her cousin Blanche, a double murderess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://business.scotsman.com/interviews/Interview-Lady-Colin-Campbell-.5640892.jp   |author=Catherine Deveney |title=Interview: Lady Colin Campbell – All about my mother.  |publisher=Scotsman.com|date=13 September 2009 |accessdate=12 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A countersuit ensued with Lady Campbell demanding compensation for lost income. She did not prevail.&lt;ref name=court&gt;[http://www.5rb.com/docs/Campbell-v-Safra%20QBD%2012%20Apr%202006.pdf Court proceedings Campbell vs Safra, December 4, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

A rewritten, American edition of the novel was published in 2008 after the 17 specific issues that had been seen as pointing to Safra were addressed.&lt;ref name=court/&gt;&lt;ref name=vincent/&gt; With changes described as minor, but legally important&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/arts/content/arts/2008/12/19/CampbellKohl1220.html |author=Robert Janjigian |title=Jana Kohl, Lady Colin Campbell talk at Palm Beach author breakfast. |publisher=Palm Beach Daily News |date=19 December 2008 |accessdate=12 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309065017/http://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/arts/content/arts/2008/12/19/CampbellKohl1220.html |archivedate=9 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; – for instance, Barret now grows up in [[Mexico]] (not [[South America]]), her mother is Palestinian (not Jewish), and her last husband Iraqi (not Lebanese) – this edition still preserved story, plot, incidents, and dialogue elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dynastypress.co.uk/article3.html |title=Press release by Dynasty Press on the publication of Empress Bianca.

An '''executive agreement'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=William|editor1-last=Schultz|editor1-first=David|editor2-last=Vile|editor2-first=John R.|title=The Encyclopedia of Civil Liberties in America|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=Armonk, NY|isbn=9781317457138|pages=345–348|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KngGCAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA359&amp;dq=encyclopedia%20of%20civil%20liberties%20in%20america%20%22william%20crawford%20green%22&amp;pg=PA345#v=onepage&amp;q=encyclopedia%20of%20civil%20liberties%20in%20america%20%22william%20crawford%20green%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 April 2016|ref=EncycCivLib|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an agreement between the [[head of government|heads of government]] of two or more nations that has not been ratified by the [[legislature]] as [[treaty|treaties]] are ratified.  Executive agreements are considered ''politically binding'' to distinguish them from [[treaty|treaties]] which are ''legally binding''.

In the [[United States]], executive agreements are made solely by the [[President of the United States]]. They are one of three mechanisms by which the United States enters into binding international obligations. Some authors consider executive agreements to be [[treaty|treaties]] under [[international law]] in that they bind both the United States and another [[sovereign state]].  However, under United States constitutional law, executive agreements are not considered treaties for the purpose of the [[Treaty Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]], which requires the advice and consent of two-thirds of the [[United States Senate|Senate]] to qualify as a treaty.

Some other nations have similar provisions with regard to the ratification of treaties.

==In general==
Executive agreements are often used in order to bypass the requirements of national [[constitution]]s for ratification of [[treaty|treaties]].  Many nations that are [[republic]]s with written constitutions have constitutional rules about the ratification of treaties.  The [[Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe]] is based on executive agreements.

==In the United States==
In the United States, executive agreements are binding internationally if they are negotiated and entered into under the president's authority in foreign policy, as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, or from a prior act of Congress.  For instance, as commander-in-chief the President negotiates and enters into [[status of forces agreement]]s (SOFAs), which govern the treatment and disposition of U.S. forces stationed in other nations. The president cannot, however, enter unilaterally into executive agreements on matters that are beyond his constitutional authority. In such instances, an agreement would need to be in the form of a [[congressional-executive agreement]], or a [[treaty]] with Senate advice and consent.

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], in ''[[United States v. Pink]]'' (1942), held that international executive agreements validly made have the same legal status as treaties and did not require Senate approval. Also, in ''[[Reid v. Covert]]'' (1957), while reaffirming the president’s ability to enter into executive agreements, the Court held that such agreements cannot contradict existing [[United States Code|federal law]] or the Constitution.

The [[Case Act of 1972]] requires the president to inform the Senate within 60 days of any executive agreement being made. No restriction was placed on presidential powers to make such agreements. The notification requirement enabled Congress to vote to cancel an executive agreement, or to refuse to fund its implementation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wps.prenhall.com/wps/media/objects/434/445252/DocumentsLibrary/docs/caseact.htm Case Act on Executive Agreements (1972)]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1846">'''FAST''' is an [[acronym]] used as a [[mnemonic]] to help detect and enhance responsiveness to the needs of a person having a [[stroke]]. The acronym stands for '''F'''acial drooping, '''A'''rm weakness, '''S'''peech difficulties and '''T'''ime to call emergency services.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.strokeassociation.org/STROKEORG/WarningSigns/Stroke-Warning-Signs-and-Symptoms_UCM_308528_SubHomePage.jsp|title=Stroke Warning Signs and Symptoms|website=www.strokeassociation.org|access-date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Facial drooping: A section of the face, usually only on one side, that is [[Central facial palsy|drooping and hard to move]]. This can be recognized by a crooked smile.
* Arm weakness: The inability to [[Paresis|raise one's arm fully]]
* Speech difficulties: An [[Aphasia|inability or difficulty to understand or produce speech]]
* Time: If any of the symptoms above are showing, time is of the essence; call the [[emergency services]] or go to the hospital.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==History==
The FAST was developed in the UK in 1998 by a group of stroke physicians, ambulance personnel, and an [[emergency department]] physician and was designed to be an integral part of a training package for ambulance staff. The FAST was created to expedite administration of intravenous [[tissue plasminogen activator]] to patients within 3 hours of acute [[stroke symptom]] onset. The instruments at this time with most evidence of validity were the [[Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale]] (CPSS) and the [[Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen (LAPSS)]].&lt;ref&gt;http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/34/1/71&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Family cookbooks''' are collections of recipes, sometimes including family history and photos of the family members. These cookbooks may be written in notebooks, put in ring binders, or professionally published by one of several cookbook publishers that cater to families interested in preserving their food heritage.

Families interested in [[genealogy]] sometimes also decide to preserve their recipes, since those recipes often represent a facet of their history. Some older recipes may give clues as to the ethnic origins of the people who cooked it, like [[lebkuchen]] with its German origins or sweet potato pie and its [[southern United States]] roots. Other genealogical clues may be found in recipe boxes, from the things the recipes are written on: old bills (may indicate where a family lived), letters (may contain stories about what was happening in their lives at the time), or newspaper clippings (may have dates).

Other than the historical/genealogical aspect of a family cookbook, they also serve as a way to pass along [[family traditions]] to another generation. It is worth the time to measure the ingredients of a cook who makes her/his dishes from memory, as they prepare it. Some recipes may become lost when the person who always made that recipe (from memory) dies if it's not written down. In addition to the recipe itself, stories about the tradition are also good to include, perhaps special [[Christmas cookies]] were set out for [[Santa Claus]] for many generations, or a traditional Irish meal was made every [[St. Patrick's Day]]. 

For large families who need to print 100 or more copies of their cookbook, there are several publishers who specialize in printing limited numbers of books. Smaller families have the option of going to their local printer (such as [[Kinko's]]), or doing it at home with [[desktop publishing]].

'''The Fellowship of American Bibliophilic Societies''' (FABS) is an association of American book clubs whose members seek interaction with book collectors across the country and around the world. At The Rowfant Club's 100th anniversary celebration in 1992, local members and their guests from book clubs in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and San Francisco discovered common interests of [[bibliophilic]] book clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About FABS|url=http://www.fabsocieties.org/about.html|access-date=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new association's first meeting was November 5, 1993, in New York, at [[Grolier Club|The Grolier Club]]. In 1994, the group drew up articles of association outlining their goals to promote and develop common interests of the member societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=F.A.B.S. Newsletter, Volume 1, Number 1, Winter 1995|url=http://www.fabsocieties.org/newsletters/1.1.pdf|access-date=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Book Talk: Essays on Books, Booksellers, Collecting, and Special Collections: Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5j5rKevsB5IC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=introduction&amp;f=false|access-date=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founding member book clubs were (in chronologic order of the year of the club's founding): The Grolier Club of New York City (1884); [[The Club of Odd Volumes]], Boston (1886); The Rowfant Club, Cleveland (1892); The Philobiblon Club, Philadelphia (1893); [[Caxton Club|The Caxton Club]], Chicago (1895); [[Book Club of California|The Book Club of California]] (1912); [[Roxburghe Club|The Roxburghe Club]], San Francisco (1927); and The Baxter Society, Portland, Maine (1984).

== Activities ==

The National Collegiate Book Collecting Contest, founded in 2005 by Fine Books &amp; Collections Magazine, was led starting in 2010 by a partnership of the [[Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America]] (ABAA), the Fellowship of American Bibliophilic Societies (FABS), the Grolier Club, and the [[Center for the Book]] and the Rare Books and Special Collections Division of the [[Library of Congress]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The National Collegiate Book Collecting Contest |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-10-033/library-to-co-sponsor-collegiate-book-collecting-contest/2010-02-22/ |access-date=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with support by the Jay I. Kislak Foundation.

The contest encourages young book collectors. Similar contests have been held at colleges and universities across the United States, such as the [[Swarthmore College]] [[A. Edward Newton|A. E. Newton]] Award Book Collecting Contest dating from the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A. E. Newton Book Collecting Contest|url=http://bookaward.swarthmore.edu/|access-date=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students from all schools, regardless of whether their school has a similar contest, and regardless of whether they've won similar contests, are encouraged to participate. The awards ceremony is held at the Library of Congress.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5261">[[File:Haarlem-Museum_De_Hallen.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to the museum through the middle house between the Vleeshal and Verweyhal.]]
'''Frans Hals Museum - Hal''' (until March 29 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.franshalsmuseum.nl/en/news/a-marriage-made-in-art-heaven/|title=A marriage made in art heaven - Frans Hals Museum|work=Frans Hals Museum|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;: ''De Hallen Haarlem'') is one of the two locations of the [[Frans Hals Museum]], located on the [[Grote Markt, Haarlem|Grote Markt]], [[Haarlem]], [[Netherlands]], where modern and contemporary art is on display in alternating presentations. The emphasis is on contemporary photograph and video presentations, with the focus on Man and society. 

The museum consists of three different buildings, the [[Vleeshal]] (Flesher's hall) on the east side and the Verweyhal (named for [[Kees Verwey]]) on the west side are two large "halls" sandwiching the small entrance building. All three buildings are National Heritage sites today.&lt;ref name="Rijks"&gt;[[Rijksmonument]] report&lt;/ref&gt;

== De Vleeshal building ==
[[File:Vleeshal (Haarlem).JPG|left|thumb|View from the Spekstraat, or ''Bacon-street''. The entrance is on the other side.]]
The Vleeshal was built in the years 1602 to 1605 and was originally a ‘meat hall’ where butchers sold their goods.&lt;ref name=Rijks/&gt;  The heads of bulls and rams on the façades are reminders of the original function of the building. It is an example of [[Renaissance architecture|Dutch renaissance architecture]], with renaissance ornaments being applied on a basic Gothic structure (floor plan and outer walls). The renaissance forms include pilasters, rustica, Tuscan (interior) pillars, scrollwork (above the cellar entrances) and obelisks. Sample prints by [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]] from Antwerp provided a source of inspiration for this. De Vleeshal was built by [[Lieven de Key]], the town architect, commissioned by the city government, which judging by the finished building had a substantial treasury at the time.&lt;ref name=Rijks/&gt;  It remained a meat hall all the way into the 19th century.

The building later fulfilled a totally different function; from 1840 to 1885 it served as a storehouse for a garrison quartered in Haarlem. Later the building served as a Public Records Office, and after that as a depot for the municipal library. During the [[Second World War]] the building was occupied by the Distribution Service.

After World War II, the Mayor and Aldermen decreed that the building should become an exhibition hall, and the first exhibitions were held in 1950. De Hallen Haarlem organises alternating exhibitions of contemporary art on two storeys, throughout summer combined with modern art. The Archeological Museum is in the cellar.

Along the top of the facade are the words "Modern Art" and the more famous names in Haarlem [[Modern art]] as of 1992, when local artist [[Kees Verwey]] financed the renovation of the old hall to house his collection. [[Isaac Israëls|Israëls]], [[Herman Kruyder|Kruyder]], [[Jan Sluyters|Sluyters]], [[Jacobus van Looy|Van Looy]], [[Mari Andriessen|Andriessen]], [[Otto B. de Kat|De Kat]] and [[Leo Gestel|Gestel]].]]
The [[Verweyhal]] is a former society meeting hall next to the main entrance on the corner of the Grote Markt and the [[Grote Houtstraat]], where the former main entrance to it is located. The Verweyhal was built in the 19th century as a home for the Haarlem gentlemen’s society [[Trou moet Blycken]].&lt;ref name=Rijks/&gt;

The building is in the Eclectic style and also contains some art deco features in the interior though it has been renovated beyond recognition since 1880. It became a modern art exhibition hall in 1992 when the [[Kees Verwey Foundation]] renovated it and gave the artist's oeuvre to the [[Frans Hals Museum]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9531">The '''Graph500''' is a rating of supercomputer systems, focused on [[Data-intensive computing|data-intensive loads]]. The project was announced on [[International Supercomputing Conference]] in June 2010. The first list was published at the [[Supercomputing Conference|ACM/IEEE Supercomputing Conference]] in November 2010. New versions of the list are published twice a year. The main performance metric used to rank the supercomputers is [[Traversed edges per second|GTEPS]] ([[giga]]- [[traversed edges per second]]).

Richard Murphy from Sandia, says that "The Graph500's goal is to promote awareness of complex data problems", instead of focusing on computer benchmarks like HPL (High Performance Linpack), which [[TOP500]] is based on.&lt;ref name="inside-exascale-2012-03"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidehpc.com/2012/03/15/the-case-for-the-graph-500-really-fast-or-really-productive-pick-one/|title=The Case for the Graph 500 – Really Fast or Really Productive? Pick One|author=The Exascale Report|publisher=Inside HPC|date=2012-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its name, there were several hundreds of systems in the rating, growing up to 174 in June 2014.&lt;ref name="graph500.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.graph500.org/results_jun_2014 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628045351/http://www.graph500.org/results_jun_2014 |archivedate=2014-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The algorithm and implementation that won the championship is published in the paper titled "Extreme scale breadth-first search on supercomputers".&lt;ref&gt;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7840705/&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also list Green Graph 500, which uses same performance metric, but sorts list according to performance per Watt, like [[Green 500]] works with [[TOP500]] (HPL).

== Benchmark ==
The benchmark used in Graph500 stresses the communication subsystem of the system, instead of counting double precision floating-point.&lt;ref name="inside-exascale-2012-03"/&gt; It is based on a breadth-first search in a large undirected graph (a model of [[Kronecker graph]] with average degree of 16). There are two computation kernels in the benchmark: the first kernel is to generate the graph and compress it into sparse structures CSR or CSC (Compressed Sparse Row/Column); the second kernel does a parallel BFS search of some random vertices (64 search iterations per run). Six possible sizes (Scales) of graph are defined: toy (2&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; vertices; 17 GB of RAM), mini (2&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;; 137 GB), small (2&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;; 1.1 TB), medium (2&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;; 17.6 TB), large (2&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;; 140 TB), and huge (2&lt;sup&gt;42&lt;/sup&gt;; 1.1 PB of RAM).&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/tokyotechsuzumuralab/publication/Graph500-IISWC2011-camera-ready.pdf?attredirects=0 Performance Evaluation of Graph500 on Large-Scale Distributed Environment] // IEEE IISWC 2011, Austin, TX; [https://sites.google.com/site/tokyotechsuzumuralab/publication/Graph500-201111.pdf?attredirects=0 presentation]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hibu''' (styled '''hibü'''), formerly '''Yell Group plc''', is a [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] directories and internet services company headquartered in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Berkshire]], UK. It has operations in the United Kingdom (known as Yell), the United States, and Spain (known as Paginas Amarillas). It has its origins in the [[yellow pages]] division of the [[privatization|privatised]] British telecommunications operator [[BT Group]].

==History==

===1966–2001===
In 1966, [[Post Office Telecommunications]] – a division of the UK [[Post Office (United Kingdom)|General Post Office]], launched the first UK Yellow Pages classified directory in [[Brighton]], Sussex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yellgroup.com/english/aboutyell-yelluk-yellukhistory-19601969|title=Yell History&amp;nbsp;– 1960–1969|publisher=Yell.com|accessdate=11 January 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118235429/http://www.yellgroup.com/english/aboutyell-yelluk-yellukhistory-19601969|archivedate=18 January 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yellow Pages were rolled out across the UK by 1973,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yellgroup.com/english/aboutyell-yelluk-yellukhistory-19701979|title=Yell History&amp;nbsp;– 1970–1979|publisher=Yell.com|accessdate=11 January 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208134328/http://www.yellgroup.com/english/aboutyell-yelluk-yellukhistory-19701979|archivedate=8 February 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became the first information provider on [[Prestel]].

Yellow Pages launched its iconic ''[[J. R. Hartley]]'' [[advertising|adverts]] in 1983, and became a separately identified business within the BT Group after BT was privatised in 1984. The red fronted ''Business Pages'' launched in 1985 in [[Bristol]] and [[South Wales]], and the telephone directory enquiries information service ''Talking Pages'' was piloted in [[Brighton]] and [[Bristol]] from 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yellgroup.com/english/aboutyell-yelluk-yellukhistory-19801989|title=Yell History&amp;nbsp;– 1980–1989|publisher=Yell.com|accessdate=11 January 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208134333/http://www.yellgroup.com/english/aboutyell-yelluk-yellukhistory-19801989|archivedate=8 February 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which then became known as 118 24 7 after 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yell.com/118247/ 118 24 7] website&lt;/ref&gt; The group launched [[Yellow pages|Yell.com]], its UK local search engine, in 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yellgroup.com/english/aboutyell-yelluk-yellukhistory-19901999|title=Yell History&amp;nbsp;– 1990–1999|publisher=Yell.com|accessdate=11 January 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208134338/http://www.yellgroup.com/english/aboutyell-yelluk-yellukhistory-19901999|archivedate=8 February 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and acquired YellowBook USA in 1999 for $665 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yellgroup.com/english/media-pressreleases-1999-btbuysyellowbookusa BT Buys Yellow Book USA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111165230/http://www.yellgroup.com/english/media-pressreleases-1999-btbuysyellowbookusa |date=11 November 2006 }} Press Release, 26 August 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The Group was renamed Yell in 2000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yellgroup.com/english/media-pressreleases-2000-yellowpagestobecomeyellplc Yellow Pages to become Yell plc] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720150103/http://www.yellgroup.com/english/media-pressreleases-2000-yellowpagestobecomeyellplc |date=20 July 2011 }} Press Release, 13 April 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and BT restructured in 2001 and agreed to sell the Yell directory business to private equity firms [[Apax Partners]] and [[HM Capital Partners|Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst]] (today operating in Europe as [[Lion Capital LLP]]) for £2.14 billion/$3.5 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yellgroup.com/english/aboutyell-yelluk-yellukhistory-2000 |title=Yell History&amp;nbsp;– 2000+ |publisher=Yell.com |accessdate=11 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208131527/http://www.yellgroup.com/english/aboutyell-yelluk-yellukhistory-2000 |archivedate=8 February 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; making it then the largest non-corporate LBO in European history.

===2001–2011===
Yell bought [[McLeodUSA]], one of the largest independent directory publishers in the US for about $600 million in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1774061.stm Yell buys US directories] BBC News, 21 January 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and floated on London's [[FTSE 100 Index|FTSE]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_29/b3842142_mz035.htm Europe's IPO trickle could become a flood] Businessweek, 21 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, Yell announced the acquisition of U.S. directory publisher TransWestern Publishing (and its holding company TransWestern Holdings L.P. from a consortium of private equity firms ([[Thomas H. Lee Partners]] and [[CIVC Partners]] for $1.575 billion (£829 million). TransWestern operated in 25 states and had core positions in California and Texas. The deal went through later in the year, making Yell's U.S. subsidiary Yellowbook the fifth largest directory publisher in the United States at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7882912/ Yell Group to buy US phone book rival] MSNBC, 17 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; TransWestern had been acquired by [[CIVC Partners]] in 1993 and was used as a vehicle for additional acquisitions of smaller directories publishers in the western US.  In 1997, TransWestern completed a [[leveraged recapitalization|leveraged recapitalisation]] in which [[Thomas H. Lee Partners]] and [[Providence Equity Partners]] acquired a 60% interest in the company, with CIVC retaining a minority interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19727717.html TransWestern Publishing Company, L.P. Announces $300 Million Recapitalization with Thomas H. Lee Company]. 8 September 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2001, TransWestern acquired Texas-based WorldPages.com, Inc., a leading print and Internet yellow pages publisher listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] for $215 million.  At the time, TransWestern was the second largest independent publisher of directories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_/ai_73703301 TransWestern Publishing to Acquire WorldPages.com; Creates Second-Largest Independent Telephone Directory Company with Strong Presence in Both Print and Online Markets].

In April 2006, Yell agreed to purchase a 59.9% stake in Spanish phone directory firm Telefónica Publicidad e Informacion (TPI) from [[Telefónica]], and launched a bid for the remaining shares which valued TPI at a total of {{GBP}}2.3 billion (€3.3 billion; US$4.1bn). Since then, Yell has bought further capital and in September 2007 reached agreement with the minority shareholders to acquire the remaining 1.28% of what was then named Yell Publicidad (now named Hibu Connect S.A.U., operating under the name Páginas Amarillas España).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4953286.stm Yell snaps up Spanish rival TPI] BBC News, 28 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2006, Yell threatened [[Yellowikis]] with legal action, claiming that people will confuse the two organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Legal threat to wiki listing site|work=BBC News | date = 12 July 2006| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/5169674.stm| accessdate =12 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Yell Group purchased the Pindar Set business and renamed it Yell Adworks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.printweek.com/news/829640/Pindar-sell-directory-division-Yell/ Pindar sell directory division to Yell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019125838/http://www.printweek.com/news/829640/Pindar-sell-directory-division-Yell |date=19 October 2009 }} Print Week, 8 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, it warned that it is working with a number of capital options that which may attribute little or no value to the group’s ordinary shares, it also warned profits would miss forecasts owing to the ongoing decline of its directory business.&lt;ref name="Rushton"/&gt;

As part of a strategic review of the business, in Spring 2014 Hibu decided to discontinue its US magazine business, having taken similar actions in the UK, Spain and Latin America.

On 3 March 2014, Hibu announced that the financial restructuring of the group is now effective following consent from lenders, clearance from the UK Pensions Regulator and court sanction. All of Hibu’s operations were transferred to a new group holding company, held privately by lenders.

On 18 August 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/yellow-pages-in-uturn-over-hibu-brand-9543137.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Gideon | last=Spanier | title=Yellow Pages in u-turn over Hibu brand | date=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hibu UK changed their customer facing brand back to Yell.

'''''Hoffmann v South African Airways''''' is an important case, heard by the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2000/17.html&lt;/ref&gt; in [[South Africa]]n labour and constitutional law. Hoffmann argued that he had been unfairly [[Discrimination|discriminated]] against on the ground of disability, due to his being [[HIV-positive people|HIV positive]]. The Constitutional Court held that [[HIV]] was not a "disability," but found nonetheless that discrimination on this basis would constitute an infringement of dignity, as it was discrimination based on a person's medical health. Discrimination on the basis of HIV status, as part of discrimination on the basis of illness, was held to be analogous to the grounds of unfair discrimination listed in the [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution]],&lt;ref&gt;s 9(3).&lt;/ref&gt; and was found, therefore, to be unfair.

The case was heard on 18 August 2000 and decided on 28 September 2000.

Retrieved on July 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; the Museum District specifically refers to the area located within a 1.5-mile radius of the Mecom Fountain in [[Hermann Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About HMDA|url=http://houstonmuseumdistrict.org/about-hmda/|website=Houston Museum District Association|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2016}} The Museum District Civic Association compared the area to [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and to the [[French Quarter]] of [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name=Mulvaney/&gt;

The Museum District is served by four stops on the [[METRORail]], one specifically named for it and is easily accessible from [[Interstate 69|I-69]]/[[U.S. Route 59|US 59]], [[Texas State Highway 288|State Highway 288]] and Main Street, across from the main entrance to Rice University.

The beginnings of the Museum District are found in 1977, when it became apparent that some action needed to be taken to provide easier access to the museums of the area. This call for community improvement evolved into the non-profit Montrose Project by the mid-1980s but changed into the Museum District Development Association of Houston (MDDAH) shortly thereafter.  Based on the works of this organization, the Museum District was formally recognized by the City of Houston in 1989. The founding organization was dissolved in 1994, but the Museum District is now under the auspices of the Houston Museum District Association, founded in 1997.

The Museum District attracts visitors, students and volunteers of all ages, backgrounds, and ethnicities to learn about and celebrate art, history, culture, and nature around the world.  More information on the 20 institutions of Houston's Museum District&lt;ref name="houstonmuseumdistrict.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonmuseumdistrict.org|title=Houston Museum District|work=houmuse.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be found on their official website.&lt;ref name="houstonmuseumdistrict.org"/&gt;

==History==
In the late 1970s, the area currently including the Houston Museum District had fallen into disrepair, badly needing attention from local, county and state governments to improve roads and beautify the area, then unsafe for pedestrian traffic and cyclists.

The Houston Museum District began as a grassroots community movement in 1977 led by Alexandra R. Marshall whose concept was to create a pedestrian-friendly district with the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston|Museum of Fine Arts]], at the intersection of Bissonnet Street and Montrose Boulevard, as its core.    In such a strongly vehicle-oriented city, and one which to this day retains the title of the largest city in the [[United States of America|United States]] without [[zoning]], this was fairly progressive.

The Museum District Development Association of Houston proposed a multi-phase plan to beautify and make more pedestrian-friendly the area located between [[Allen Parkway]], [[Buffalo Bayou]] and Hermann Park. It took advantage of the opportunity to create in Houston an area of vital urban importance, similar to the [[French Quarter]] in [[New Orleans]], [[Boulevard Saint-Germain|St. Germain]] in [[Paris]], and [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]].

Since its creation, the numerous efforts of the Houston Museum District organizations have included community improvement projects, tree planting, sidewalk planning, construction and expansion, esplanade design, development and beautification, establishment of public transportation to and from the area, police support and various cultural events
	
The Montrose Association, the Museum Area Municipal Association, the South Main Civic Association, the Cultural Arts Center of Houston and TALA (Texas Accountants and Lawyers for the Arts) all played a part in the development and subsequent success in the creation of the Houston Museum District.

==Funding==
Originally, funding was completely based on private sources—association member dues and members’ donations. Later, with growing awareness of the MDDAH and their work, funding came from numerous other sources.

Today, total operating budgets for the member museums exceed $80 million, funded almost completely from revenues and private donations. Museum District funding includes approximately $1.5 million in Hotel Occupancy Tax funds from the City of Houston and the Houston Arts Alliance;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cachh.org |title=cachh.org |publisher=cachh.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; contributions from all participating museums; foundation support from The Houston Endowment, Inc.;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonendowment.org |title=Houston Endowment |publisher=Houston Endowment |date= |accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The John P.

==Public issues==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}
The District plays an ongoing role in forming responses to public concerns and opportunities that include transportation improvements, signage, visitor information, area beautification, flood control and urban planning considerations.
The HMDA also serves as an intermediary, which fosters an ongoing dialogue among the museums in the district to maintain continuing interest and visitation in the area.

==Residential areas==
Museum Park Neighborhood Association (MPNA) serves houses roughly bound by [[Texas State Highway 288]], [[Hermann Park]], [[Main Street (Houston)|Main Street]], and Alabama Street.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.museumparkna.org/page-1733166 Mission]." Museum Park Neighborhood Association. Retrieved on July 11, 2016. [https://www.museumparkna.org/Resources/Documents/Museum%20Park%20PP%20How%20It%20Fits.pptx Maps available here]&lt;/ref&gt; Several apartment and/or condo communities are already in the area and new ones are currently being built and developed. One benefit of living at The Circle at Hermann Park, The Mosaic, The Parklane, The Plaza, The Warwick, or new residential communities being built is that residents enjoy easy walking distance to the Houston Zoo, The Children's Museum of Houston, The Houston Museum of Natural Science, Miller Outdoor Theater, Hermann Park, The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and more.

==Parking==
Parking in the Houston Museum District can be tricky if you visit on Thursdays, weekends, HISD Spring/Summer/Winter vacation days, or evenings when Miller Outdoor Theater is hosting a popular show. A parking lot adjacent to the McGovern Centennial Gardens on Hermann Drive was added in 2014. You may park there for free. Parking in the lot across from the Law Building at MFAH is also free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mfah.org/visit/parking/|title=Parking and Transportation Options - The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston|author=|date=|website=www.mfah.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; You may also park at the zoo or in the lot near the Rice University Light Rail Station for free (there is a 3-hour time limit). You may pay to park along Hermann Drive or on side streets, in the HMNS garage, or in various garages. You may also park along the MetroRail Line and take the light rail train to Rice University or The Museum District stops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://houmuse.org/visitor-information/transportation/|title=Transportation|author=|date=|website=houmuse.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Houston Public Library]] Clayton Library, Center for Genealogical Research is located in the Museum District. The genealogical collection, originally housed in the [[Julia Ideson Building]] in [[Downtown Houston]], moved to the William Clayton Home, a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian-style]] house built in 1917, in the Museum District in 1968. A site for a new building, adjacent to the Clayton Home, was purchased in 1986.

[[File:Examples of Ibid, from "Justice" by Michael J- Sandel 2013-04-08 20-17.jpg|thumbnail|An example of Ibid. citations in use, from "Justice" by [[Michael J. Sandel]].]]

'''Ibid''' is an abbreviation for the [[Latin]] word ''[[wikt:ibidem#Latin|ibīdem]]'', meaning "in the same place", commonly used in an [[endnote]], [[footnote]], [[bibliography]] [[citation]], or [[reference#Scholarship|scholarly reference]] to refer to the [[Source text|source]] cited in the preceding note or list item. This is similar to ''[[wikt:idem#Latin|īdem]]'', literally meaning "the same", abbreviated ''Id.'', which is commonly used in [[legal citation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/idem |title=Idem|publisher=thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=11 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibid. may also be used in the Harvard (name-date) system for in-text references where there has been a close previous citation from the same source material.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Manual of Style Online, (13.64).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Hart's Rules, Oxford University Press, 2005, p.396&lt;/ref&gt; The previous reference should be immediately visible, e.g. within the same paragraph or page. Some academic publishers now prefer that "ibid." not be italicized, as it is a commonly found term.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., {{cite web |url= http://www.cambridge.org/us/notesforauthors/cambridge_style.doc |title=Style sheet: Cambridge University Press |format=DOC |date=2013 |website= |publisher= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ibid. is an [[abbreviation]] where the last two letters of the word are omitted, it takes a full stop (period) in both British and American usage.

==Example==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:[1] E. Vijh, ''Latin for Dummies'' (New York: Academic, 1997), 23.
:[2] Ibid.
:[3] Ibid., 29.
:[4] A. Alhazred, ''The Necronomicon'' (Petrus de Dacia, 1994).
:[5] Ibid. 1, 34.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Reference 2 is the same as reference 1: E. Vijh, ''Latin for Dummies'' on page 23, whereas reference 3 refers to the same work but at a different location, namely page 29. Intervening entries require a reference to the original citation in the form Ibid. &lt;citation #&gt;, as in reference 5.

==Cultural references==

* Ibid. is used in the 1960s play ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' by [[Edward Albee]]. Albee uses an unabbreviated ibid{{huh|date=April 2017}} in his stage directions to tell an actor to use the same tone as the previous line.
* In the 1989 book ''Pyramids'' by [[Terry Pratchett]], one of the Ephebian philosophers is called "Ibid".
* In the 1997 movie ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'', the main character, Will Hunting, when arguing for himself in court against the dismissive rebuttals of the prosecuting attorney, cites obscure case law, then follows up by stating "Ibid, your Honour."

'''Kolonaki''' ({{Lang-el|Κολωνάκι}}, {{IPA-el|koloˈnaci|pron}}), literally "Little Column", is a neighborhood in central [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. It is located on the southern slopes of [[Lycabettus]] hill. Its name derives from the two metre column (located in [[Kolonaki Square]]) that defined the area even before a single house had been built there. (See map, with Colonne indicating the column.)

==Description==
Kolonaki is a wealthy and upmarket district. As one of the capital's leading shopping areas, it includes a number of high-end boutiques from young adult to casual fashion to prestigious [[haute couture]] from Greek and international designers. One of its main shopping streets, [[Voukourestiou Street]], is now known for its jewelry.

[[Museums]] and [[art museum|galleries]] also abound in Kolonaki. The [[Benaki Museum]], inside a preserved [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] manor house, and the [[Goulandris Museum of Cycladic Art]] and are two of the finest private collections in the country. Two smaller museums to be found in Kolonaki are the Museum of the History of Greek Costume and the Theater Museum, both highly specialized in their respective areas. A walk across the street from [[Vasilissis Sofias Avenue]] are the [[Byzantine Museum]], and the [[War Museum of Athens]].

There is a plethora of available options for nightlife, including bars, ouzeries, and tavernas.  Outdoor seating on pedestrian walks is typical, creating a lively atmosphere at night. The main [[Kolonaki Square]] (with the small column) is surrounded by cafes and restaurants.

The Lycabettus Funicular, a [[funicular|funicular railway]], links Kolonaki to the summit of Lycabettus hill.
Kolonaki also hosts two metro stations, Evengelismos and Megaro Mousikis.

'''The Letter to the Romans''' by [[Ignatius of Antioch|Ignatius]], an early-second-century [[Bishop of Antioch]], was written during his transport from [[Antioch]], [[Province of Syria|Syria]], to his execution in Rome. One of seven [[extant literature|extant]] epistles written by Ignatius, ''Romans'' is Ignatius’ most detailed explanation of his views on martyrdom.

==Context==

The exact year in which ''Romans'' was written is disputed; however, common consensus seems to be that Ignatius wrote concurrent with New Testament writings and likely under the rule of Roman Emperor [[Trajan]]. Scholars hypothesize that the text was written between “105 and 110 AD”,&lt;ref&gt;Clayton Jefford (ed.). ''Reading the Apostolic Fathers: An Introduction''p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; as well as “prior to 117 CE”,&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Pratscher (ed.) ''The Apostolic Fathers: An Introduction'' p.94&lt;/ref&gt; and “between the first year of Vespasian and the 10th year of Trajan” &lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Pratscher (ed.) ''The Apostolic Fathers: An Introduction'' p.94&lt;/ref&gt; Although we do not know which specific year Ignatius wrote this letter, he does provide the month and day: August 23.

Following his arrest in [[Province of Syria|Syria]], Ignatius traveled through many cities on his way to Rome for execution. ''Romans'' was written prior to his arrival in Rome, while he was in [[Smyrna]]. Our evidence for the Ignatius’ journey to Rome primarily comes from the fourth-century church historian [[Eusebius of Caesarea]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Pratscher (ed.) ''The Apostolic Fathers: An Introduction'' p.91&lt;/ref&gt;

''Romans'' is part of a series of seven epistles that Ignatius wrote, each addressed to a different regional church. However, while the other letters addressed communities with whom Ignatius had already had contact (either in person or via representatives), ''Romans'' addresses Roman Christians prior to his arrival in Rome. It has been suggested that the letter (especially because it includes the specific day and month it was written) was intended to allow Roman Christians to prepare for Ignatius’ arrival.

==Style/Format==

''Romans'' follows an epistolary format, addressing the regional Roman church. The text is often considered to be modeled after the Pauline epistles, while incorporating certain Hellenistic mores.

==Content==

''Romans'' follows this basic epistolary format:
	
'''Prescript'''

	''Superscripto'' – “Ignatius, also called Theophorus.”
		Theophorus appears to be a familiar, or nickname, meaning “bearer of God” that Ignatius includes in all his letters.

	''Adscription''
		A more detailed description of the church receiving the letter.

	''Salutario''
		Includes circumstances of the letter and a greeting to the recipients.

Sections 1-8 are Ignatius’ request that Roman Christians not interfere with his martyrdom, as it is how he desires to be with God.
	
Sections 9-10 contain concluding remarks and greetings.

Jefford provides a nice acute summary (in clear, modern English) of ''Romans'' in the book ''Reading the Apostolic Fathers:''

"Greetings to the Romans! Though I am unworthy, I long to see you. Pray for me. And when I arrive in chains, let me die a martyr’s death – eaten by wild beasts! I long for this proof that I am a true disciple of Christ. Let me follow in the footsteps of the Lord. I no longer take pleasure in life. Pray for the church in Syria."

==Significance==

While ''Romans'' is primarily significant for Ignatius’ discussion of his impending [[martyrdom]], it is also important for serving as a representation of early Christian writing, though it does differ from the other six letters Ignatius wrote.

Ignatius implores the Roman Christians to allow him to be martyred, that they practice what they teach in regard to enduring suffering. The language Ignatius uses to discuss his death is frequently [[eucharistic]], often referring to the consumption of his body as bread. Likewise, the language Ignatius uses is morbid, as the prospect of his death informs much of the letter. He claims that only through death can he attain true freedom, and that there is no longer any value in worldly things for him. Ignatius also likens his movement towards Rome to a victory march from battle. The various metaphors Ignatius uses glorify martyrdom. Overall, his rumination on martyrdom reflects the countercultural attitudes of Christianity during this post-apostolic era.

Also, it is important in how it differs from Ignatius’ other six epistles. This letter discusses martyrdom with a people Ignatius has not yet personally encountered (the Christian community in Rome), whereas the other letters primarily address issues such as church hierarchy, creeds and confessions, and maintaining Christianity. Thus, this letter places importance upon Rome as a vehicle towards martyrdom.

Finally, this text is also important because it provides a sketch of the emerging church hierarchy. We can see how the three-tiered church hierarchy (consisting of [[bishop]]s, elders, and [[deacon]]s) was coming into being, and how regional churches were gaining unity through it.

'''Loanwords''' have entered [[中文|written]] and [[普通话|spoken]] [[Chinese language|Chinese]] from many sources, including [[Four Barbarians|ancient peoples]] whose descendants now speak Chinese. In addition to phonetic differences, [[varieties of Chinese]] such as [[Cantonese]] and [[Shanghainese]] often have distinct words and phrases left from their original languages which they continue to use in daily life and sometimes even in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]]. Similarly, [[Mandarin Chinese|northern dialects]] include relatively greater numbers of loanwords from nearby languages such as [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] and [[Manchu language|Manchu]].

Throughout China, [[Buddhism]] has also introduced words from [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali language|Pali]]. More recently, foreign invasion and trade since the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s of the mid-nineteenth century has led to prolonged contact with [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. Although politically-minded language reform under the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Republic]] and [[People's Republic of China]] have generally preferred to use [[calque]]s and [[neologism]]s in place of loanwords, a growing number {{ndash}} particularly from [[American English]] {{ndash}} have become current in modern Chinese. On the [[mainland China|mainland]], [[transcription into Chinese characters]] in official media and publications is directed by the Proper Names and Translation Service of the [[Xinhua News Agency]] and its reference work ''Names of the World's Peoples''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Xinhua News Agency]]. ''Names of the World's Peoples: a Comprehensive Dictionary of Names in Roman-Chinese'' [{{lang|zh|世界人名翻译大辞典}}, ''Shìjiè Rénmíng Fānyì Dà Cídiǎn''].&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[Hong Kong]] was under British control until 1997, [[Hong Kong Cantonese]] borrowed many words from English such as 巴士 (from the word "bus", Mandarin: ''bāshì'', Cantonese: ''baa1 si2''), 的士 (from "taxi", Man.: ''dīshì'', Can.: ''dik1 si2''), 芝士 (from "cheese", Man.: ''zhīshì'', Can.: ''zi1 si6''), and 麥當簩/麦当劳 (from "McDonald's", Man.: ''Màidāngláo'', Can.: ''Mak6 dong1 lou4''), and such loanwords have been adopted into Mandarin, despite them sounding much less similar to the English words the Cantonese versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yoyochinese.com/blog/8-Chinese-words-borrowed-English-that-will-finally-make-sense-to-you|title=8 Chinese Words Borrowed From English That Will Finally Make Sense to You|website=www.yoyochinese.com|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign businesses and products are usually free to choose their own transliterations and typically select ones with positive connotations and phonetic similarity to their products: for example, {{lang|zh|宜家}}&amp;nbsp;([[IKEA]]) is "proper home". Owing to [[antonomasia]] and [[generic trademark|genericization]], these can then enter general Chinese usage: for example [[Coca-Cola]]'s {{lang|zh|可口可乐}}&amp;nbsp;("delicious fun") has led to {{lang|zh|可乐}} becoming the common Chinese noun for all [[Cola|colas]].

Since the [[Kuomintang]] retreated to [[Taiwan]] after the [[Chinese Civil War]], relations between the [[Republic of China]] and the [[People's Republic of China]] had been hostile, thus communication between [[Taiwan]] and [[mainland China]] became limited. For that reason, many loanwords and proper names became quite different from each other. For example, "cheese" in mainland China is 芝士 ''zhīshì'', while cheese in Taiwan is 起司 ''qĭsī''.

==English==
Chinese words of English origin have become more common in [[mainland China]] during its [[reform and opening]] and resultant increased contact with the [[Western world|West]]. Note that some of the words below originated in other languages but may have arrived in Chinese via English (for example "pizza/披萨" from Italian). English [[acronym]]s are sometimes borrowed into Chinese without any transcription into Chinese characters; for example "IT" ([[information technology]]), "PPT" (PowerPoint), "GDP" ([[Gross domestic product]]), "APP" ([[mobile app]]), "KTV" (karaoke), or "[[DVD]]". A rarer occurrence is the blending of the [[Latin alphabet]] with Chinese characters, as in  "卡拉OK" ("karaoke"), “T恤” ("T-shirt"), "IP卡" ("internet phone card").&lt;ref&gt;Zuo, X. (2005). Language planning with respect to English into China. ''Terminology'', 11(2), 283-292.&lt;/ref&gt;  In some instances, the loanwords exists side by side with neologisms that translate the meaning of the concept into existing Chinese morphemes. For instance, while the loanword for 'penicillin' is 盘尼西林 (pánníxīlín), a neologism that 'translates' the word was later coined, 青霉素 （qīngméisù), which means 'blue/green mold extract/essence'.  In contemporary Chinese, neologisms using native Chinese morphemes tend to be favored over loanwords that are transliterations.  In the case of penicillin, the term 青霉素 is used almost exclusively, while 盘尼西林 is viewed as an early 20th century relic.  Similarly, 'science' is now known as 科学 (kēxué) 'subject/specialty study' rather than 赛因斯 (sàiyīnsī), though it should be pointed out that the characters 科学 were actually coined in the late 19th century by the Japanese as a kanji compound.

The '''Malta Kiosk''' ({{lang-tr|Malta Köşkü}}) is a historic imperial [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] residence located within the garden of the [[Yıldız Palace]] in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]. The two-storey [[pavilion]] was commissioned by Sultan [[Abdülaziz]] (reigned 1861&amp;ndash;1876) as a hunting lodge,&lt;ref name="wow"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wowturkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7027 |publisher=Wow Turkey |title=Malta Köşkü-Yıldız Korusu |date=May 6, 2004 |accessdate=December 8, 2008 |language=Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt; designed&lt;ref name="beltur"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibb.gov.tr/en-US/Organization/Companies/Pages/BELTURAS.aspx |publisher=Istanbul Büyükşehir Belediyesi |title=Beltur A.Ş.-Malta Köşkü |accessdate=December 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by the architect [[Balyan family#Sarkis Balyan|Sarkis Balyan]]&lt;ref name="wow" /&gt; in the [[neo-baroque]] style and completed in 1870.

The pavilion, perched atop a steep hill, is one of the two lodges of its art within the [[Yıldız Park]], the other one being the [[Çadır Pavilion]] ({{lang-tr|Çadır Köşkü}}). It is located at the north side of the wall separating Yıldız Palace. There are also two watching and resting pavilions in the grove being the rear garden of [[Çırağan Palace]] from the Abdül Aziz I period. The origin of the name is not certain but it is thought that during the Ottoman era certain parts of palaces were called after the names of conquered places, so this name was probably given after the [[Great Siege of Malta|siege]] of [[Malta]] (even though the siege was a major Ottoman defeat and Malta remained unconquered).

== Architecture ==
[[Image:Malta Kiosk interior March 2008panoc.jpg|thumb|Marble fountain pool in the lower salon adorned with carved swan and fish figures.]]
[[File:Malta Kiosk interior March 2008pano.jpg|thumb|One of the salons on the second floor]]
Malta Kiosk is an example of westernised architecture of the 19th century. The building was constructed by Sarkis Balyan and his brothers. During the Abdül Mecid I period, the architects have been influenced by the European architecture and motifs of nature, flowers, fruits and hunting animal figures have been widely used on the walls. Round marble columns, terraces, bedrooms, wooden and crystal halls have features like neo-classical, neo-Islamic and neo-Ottoman characteristics. The arches in S and C shapes originated from the Rococo style. Columns, palmets or sea shells have been added to the keystones of the arches. The baroque style of the 19th century has been reflected with oval windows, fluted cornices, flushed columns with small tower on ends. The vertical and horizontal elements have been balanced in the Empire style symbolising the Napoleonic period under the influence of Egyptian and Roman architecture.

The facades of the building on each side, painted in yellow and green, consists of three parts with a large center section flanked by two smaller. Main elements of the facades are triple, tall but narrow, round-arched windows. At the second floor on the side overlooking the [[Bosporus]] are also balconies. The building has four doors in total.&lt;ref name="wow" /&gt;&lt;ref name="osd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://osdir.com/ml/culture.region.turkish/2005-08/msg00006.html |publisher=Osdir |title=Malta Pavilion |author=Soysal, Hakan |accessdate=December 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The waterside entrance opens onto a large hall. On both sides of the entrance hall, two staircases rise to upper floor. A large chandelier hangs from a dome-shaped ceiling, which is opulently decorated with curving branches and clusters of various flower motifs. The lower salon contains a big marble fountain and a marble pool in the center decorated with carved swan and fish figures.&lt;ref name="wow" /&gt; Between the hall and the salon, there are five-tier marble fountains again with carved swan figures. Two marble columns erects here to the ceiling.&lt;ref name="osd" /&gt;

The salon on the upper level is flanked with two large and one small-sized rooms. The large salons on both floors are equipped with a carved marble fireplace worked with colorful flowers.&lt;ref name="wow" /&gt; Oil paintings with landscape themes beautify the walls of the salons.&lt;ref name="osd" /&gt; Two rooms on the upper floor are decorated with flower motifs. There are balconies on the second floor facing the sea.

== Witness to political incidents ==

When Sultan Abdülaziz was dethroned in 1876, his nephew [[Murad V]] (reigned May 30-August 31, 1876) was elevated to the throne. However, he was in turn deposed only after 93 days on the grounds that he was mentally ill, and was replaced by his brother, [[Abdul Hamid II]] (reigned 1876&amp;ndash;1909). Abdul Hamid II detained Murad V in the Malta Pavilion.&lt;ref name="lp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/turkey/istanbul/sights/402214 |publisher=Lonely Planet |title=Yildiz Parki |accessdate=December 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Midhat Pasha]], [[grand vizier]] and statesman, was ordered by Sultan Abdul Hamid II to be arrested the second time in 1881. Although escaped in the first instance, Midhat Pasha returned a short time later claiming a fair hearing. The trial was held in the nearby Çadır Pavilion,&lt;ref name="wow" /&gt; and lasted three days in June that year, during which he was tortured in the basement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/europe/turkey/istanbul/attraction-detail.html?vid=1194826474263 |publisher=The New York Times |title=Istanbul Attractions-Yildiz Palace and Park |accessdate=December 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial of Midhat Pasha took place in a tent behind the pavilion.

== Redevelopment ==
[[File:View Bosphorus Yildiz Malta March 2008.JPG|thumb|View onto the Bosphorus from the terrace at dawn]]
Following the foundation of the Republic of Turkey, the Malta Pavilion, as many of Ottoman imperial buildings, stood unused and was neglected over a long period. In 1979, the [[Touring and Automobile Club of Turkey]] (TTOK) under its [[CEO]] [[Çelik Gülersoy]] signed an agreement with the City of Istanbul to restore and preserve specific imperial residences, and to run them as public premises. Malta Pavilion was the first restoration work accomplished.&lt;ref name="arch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archnet.org/library/pubdownloader/pdf/6174/doc/DPT0145.pdf |publisher=ArchNet |title=Historic Site Development |format=pdf |accessdate=December 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exterior walls were repainted green with white trim, and the interiors were restored to their former glory. Furnishings, chandeliers and paintings were collected to fit the style of the rich neo-baroque building.&lt;ref name="arch" /&gt;

Opened to the public in 1982, the Malta Pavilion was run as a cafeteria and restaurant by the TTOK until the lease license expired, and the Metropolitan Municipality of Istanbul did not renew it. From 1997 until 2003, it was operated by the tourism company Beltur of the Metropolitan Municipality. Today, the premise is being run by a private company.&lt;ref name="wow" /&gt; In the restaurant and cafeteria on two floors, up to 150 guests can be served.&lt;ref name="beltur" /&gt;

== Dessert ==

"Malta Köşkü" is also the name of a [[cake]] in the [[Turkish cuisine]] prepared with the [[loquat]] fruit ({{lang-tr|Malta eriği}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nepisirsem.com/resimliyemektarifi.aspx?yemekid=735 |publisher=Ne Pişirsem |title=Malta Köşkü |accessdate=December 9, 2008 |language=Turkish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Microstock photography''',{{Citation needed|date=July 2013|reason=Source needed for use of this term and definition}} also known as '''micropayment photography''', is a part of the [[stock photography]] industry.  What defines a company as a microstock photography company is that they (1) source their images almost exclusively via the Internet, (2) do so from a wider range of photographers than the traditional stock agencies (including a willingness to accept images from "amateurs" and hobbyists), and (3) sell their images at a very low rate (from [[US$]]0.20 to $10 in the US) for a [[royalty-free]] (RF) image.

A number of microstock sites also sell [[vector graphics|vector art]], and some sell audio (music) files, Flash animations and video as well as images.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Shankland, [http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9588_22-6188197.html "With site revamp, Fotolia adds vector art"], ZDNet News, June 1, 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604184538/http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9588_22-6188197.html |date=June 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The pioneer of microstock photography was [[Bruce Livingstone]], who created [[iStockphoto]], originally a free stock photo site that quickly became an industry phenomenon.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Livingstone sold iStockphoto to [[Getty Images]] in February 2006 for {{US$}}50 million. Many other sites sprang up in the years after iStockphoto's inception. Some of the larger ones are [[Alamy]], [[Fotolia]], [[Depositphotos]], [[123RF]], [[Featurepics]], [[Pond5]], [[Can Stock Photo]], [[Dreamstime]] and [[Shutterstock]].

After a few years of initial growth, the microstock industry began a period of mergers and acquisitions. The acquisition of iStockphoto by Getty Images in 2006 was followed by acquisition of [[StockXpert]] by Jupiterimages during 2006.&lt;ref name="JUI_SXP"&gt;[http://www.webmediabrands.com/corporate/releases/06.11.07-JI_HAAPMedia.html "Jupiterimages acquires Stockxpert.com and Stock.xchng] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117153826/http://www.webmediabrands.com/corporate/releases/06.11.07-JI_HAAPMedia.html |date=January 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Jupiterimages, a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Jupitermedia]], was bought by Getty Images in 2009 for $96 million in cash&lt;ref name="getty-feb"&gt;{{Cite press release |url=http://company.gettyimages.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=192&amp;isource=corporate_website_ind_press_release |title=Jupitermedia Announces Completion Of Sale Of Jupiterimages To Getty Images and Change Of Jupitermedia Name to WebMediaBrands|publisher=Getty Images|date=2009-02-23|accessdate=2009-08-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228031805/http://company.gettyimages.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=192&amp;isource=corporate_website_ind_press_release|archivedate=2009-02-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and resulted in the closure of StockXpert in 2010 because it was perceived to be non-strategic for Getty compared to iStockphoto. After the sale, Jupitermedia changed its name to [[WebMediaBrands]].&lt;ref name="getty-feb"/&gt; [[BigStockPhoto]] was purchased by [[Shutterstock]] in 2009.

Starting from limited RF license, all agencies added various Extended Licenses; sites based on a "pay-per-download" principle introduced subscription and vice versa. Shutterstock, which was the only 100% subscription-based microstock agency, introduced a pay-per-download scheme and later acquired BigStockPhoto to extend their presence in pay-per-download niche. Newcomer Cutcaster.com extended the pricing model by introducing a model where contributors could set their start price or could choose to use a pricing algorithm and they allowed a buyer to pay the price shown or bid on the content and name their price. Microstock prices were significantly adjusted several times by the respective agencies in the last three years across multiple sites. Many microstock agencies started to sell video in addition to static pictures, and some started to sell sound clips.

2011 marked the first signs of microstock photographers becoming a field of professionals.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Photographers with large, market-relevant, or high-quality portfolios now often collaborate with each other and negotiate with less-established agencies for better commissions or search positioning, and the increasing popularity among photographers of photography portfolio management solutions to increase their throughput and improve metadata quality to better align with principles of [[SEO]] in image search algorithms.

In 2012, Shutterstock became the first microstock agency to complete an initial public offering. The agency now trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker SSTK.&lt;ref name="shutterstock-ipo"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shutterstock.com/blog/2012/10/shutterstock-celebrates-at-the-new-york-stock-exchange/|title=Shutterstock Announces Closing of Initial Public Offering and Exercise of Underwriters' Option to Purchase Additional Shares|publisher=Shutterstock|date=2012-10-16|accessdate=2013-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014 [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] acquired Fotolia for {{US$}}800 million in cash.&lt;ref&gt;https://venturebeat.com/2014/12/11/adobe-is-buying-stock-photo-giant-fotolia/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practices and controversy==
Each microstock agency uses a different pricing and payment scheme. In some instances the same photo can have several prices. Photographers can upload the same pictures on multiple sites or, with some agencies, become an exclusive supplier and receive an increased commission and additional benefits.&lt;ref name="NYT-06-05-07"&gt;Eric A. Taub, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/05/technology/circuits/05syndicate.html "When Are Photos Like Penny Stocks? When They Sell"], ''The New York Times'', June 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no fee to post photos on a microstock agency website. However, microstock agencies do not accept all submitters or all photographs. Each employs a team of reviewers who check every picture submitted for legal issues and technical quality, as well as artistic and commercial merit. Photographers add keywords that help potential buyers filter and find pictures of interest.&lt;ref name="NYT-06-05-07"/&gt;

Some professional photographers who do not participate believe that microstock devalues the practice of photography, and that the business model is unsustainable. They see the growth of microstock sites as reducing their own incomes.&lt;ref name="NYT-06-05-07"/&gt; In 2015, hundreds of microstock contributors joined together to create the open-source Symbiostock project&lt;ref&gt;Steve Heap, [http://www.backyardsilver.com/2015/07/the-new-symbiostock-trying-again-with-my-own-stock-agency/ "trying again with my own stock agency"], July 27, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and associated Symzio agency&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.symzio.com/ "Symzio, a contributor controlled agency"]&lt;/ref&gt; in an effort to offset this devaluation through independently controlled pricing.

A development that counters these critical opinions is the advance of on-demand photography (or crowd sourced photography, photography marketplaces, etc.). With the higher penetration of smartphones with ever-better cameras, most amateurs can create high quality photography wherever they are. Crowd photo services like CrowdFoto.net or imagebrief.com try to tap into this vast potential by giving clients the possibility to publish a request (or briefing) that can be picked up and worked on by literally everybody who finds the briefing on their platform. These services reinstate the traditional model of a client asking a photographer to create a photo, but make use of the broadened number of amateur photographers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14420">'''Minority rights''' are the normal [[individual rights]] as applied to members of racial, [[ethnic]], [[social class|class]], [[minority religion|religious]], [[minority language|linguistic]] or [[LGBT|gender and sexual minorities]]; and also the [[collective rights]] accorded to minority groups. Minority rights may also apply simply to [[individual and group rights|individual rights]] of anyone who is not part of a [[majority rule|majority decision]].

[[Civil rights movements]] often seek to ensure that individual rights are not denied on the basis of membership in a minority group, such as global [[women's rights]] and global [[LGBT rights]] movements, or the various racial minority rights movements around the world (such as the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the United States).

==History==
The issue of minority rights was first raised in 1814, at the [[Congress of Vienna]], which discussed the fate of German [[Jew]]s and especially of the [[Poles]] who were once again partitioned up.  The Congress expressed hope that [[Prussia]], [[Russia]], and [[Austria]] would grant tolerance and protection to their minorities, which ultimately they disregarded, engaging in organized discrimination.

The 1856 [[Congress of Paris]] paid special attention to the status of Jews and [[Christian]]s in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In Britain, [[William Gladstone]] made the massacres of [[Bulgarians]] by the Ottoman Empire a major campaign issue and demanded international attention. The [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878 dealt with the status of Jews in [[Romania]], especially, and also [[Serbia]], and [[Bulgaria]].

On the whole, the 19th century congresses failed to impose significant reforms. Russia was especially active in protecting Orthodox Christians and Slavic peoples under the control of the Ottoman Empire.  Persecution or discrimination against specific minorities was increasingly the subject of media attention, and the Jews began to organize to protest the [[pogrom]]s in Russia. However, there was little international outrage regarding treatment of other minorities, such as black people in the [[southern United States]].

The first minority rights were proclaimed and enacted by the revolutionary Parliament of Hungary in July 1849.&lt;ref&gt;Laszlo Peter, Martyn C. Rady, Peter A. Sherwood: Lajos Kossuth sas word...: papers delivered on the occasion of the bicentenary of Kossuth's birth (page 101)&lt;/ref&gt; Minority rights were codified in Austrian law in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verfassungen.de/at/stgg67-2.htm Staatsgrundgesetz vom 21. Dezember 1867 (R.G.Bl. 142/1867), über die allgemeinen Rechte der Staatsbürger für die im Reichsrate vertretenen Königreiche und Länder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807075910/http://www.verfassungen.de/at/stgg67-2.htm |date=7 August 2011 }} — see Article 19 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minority rights at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919===
{{for|information about Minority rights at the Paris conference |Minority Treaties}}
At the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Versailles Peace Conference]] the Supreme Council established 'The Committee on New States and for The Protection of Minorities'. All the new successor states were compelled to sign minority rights treaties as a precondition of diplomatic recognition. It was agreed that although the new states had been recognized, they had not been 'created' before the signatures of the final peace treaties. The issue of German and Polish rights was a point of dispute as Polish rights in Germany remained unprotected, unlike the German minority in [[Poland]]. Like other principles adopted by the League, the Minorities Treaties were a part of the Wilsonian idealist approach to international relations; like the League itself, the Minority Treaties were increasingly ignored by the respective governments, with the entire system mostly collapsing in the late 1930s. Despite the political failure, they remained the basis of international law. After [[World War II]], the legal principles were incorporated in the UN Charter and a host of international human rights treaties.

===International law===
Minority rights, as applying to ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities and indigenous peoples, are an integral part of [[international human rights law]]. Like [[children's rights]], [[women's rights]] and [[refugee]] rights, minority rights are a legal framework designed to ensure that a specific group which is in a [[social vulnerability|vulnerable]], disadvantaged or [[social exclusion|marginalized]] position in society, is able to achieve equality and is protected from persecution. The first postwar international treaty to protect minorities, designed to protect them from the greatest threat to their existence, was the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]].

Subsequent human rights standards that codify minority rights include the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (Article 27), the [[United Nations]] [[Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities]], two [[Council of Europe]] treaties (the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]] and the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]), and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) Copenhagen Document of 1990.

Minority rights cover protection of existence, protection from discrimination and persecution, protection and promotion of identity, and participation in political life. For the rights of [[LGBT]] people, the [[Yogyakarta Principles]] have been approved by the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]]. For the rights of persons with [[disability|disabilities]], the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] has been adopted by [[United Nations General Assembly]].

To protect minority rights, many countries have specific laws and/or commissions or [[ombudsman]] institutions (for example the Hungarian Parliamentary Commissioner for National and Ethnic Minorities Rights).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obh.hu/nekh/en/index.htm Homepage of the Parliamentary Commissioner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223215718/http://www.obh.hu/nekh/en/index.htm |date=23 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While initially, the United Nations treated [[indigenous peoples]] as a sub-category of minorities, there is an expanding body of international law specifically devoted to them, in particular [[Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989|Convention 169]] of the [[International Labour Organization]] and the UN [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] (adopted 14 September 2007).

In 2008, a declaration on LGBT rights was presented in the [[UN General Assembly]], and in 2011, a LGBT rights resolution was passed in the United Nations Human Rights Council (''See [[LGBT rights at the United Nations]]'').

There are many political bodies which also feature minority group rights, which might be seen in [[affirmative action]] quotas or in guaranteed minority representation in a [[consociational state]].

== National minorities in the law of the EC/EU ==
The direct role of the [[European Union]] (and also the law of the EU/EC) in the area of protection of national minorities  is still very limited (likewise the general protection of [[human rights]]). The EU has relied on general [[international law]] and a European regional system of international law (based on the [[Council of Europe]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], etc.) and in a case of necessity accepted their norms. But the “de-economisation of European integration”, which started in the 1990s, is changing this situation. The political relevance of national minorities' protection is very high.

Now (2009), although protection of the national minorities has not become a generally accepted legally binding principle of the EU, in  several legal acts issues of national minorities are mentioned. In external relations protection of national minorities became one of the main criteria for cooperation with the EU or  accession.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Šmihula]] (2008). ''National Minorities in the Law of the EC/EU'' in Romanian Journal of European Affairs, Vol. 8 no. 3, Sep. 2008, pp.51-81. {{cite web |url=http://ns.ier.ro/site/documente/rjea_pdf/RJEA_Vol8_No3_Sept2008.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823110657/http://ns.ier.ro/site/documente/rjea_pdf/RJEA_Vol8_No3_Sept2008.pdf |archivedate=23 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''News Media Ownership v Findlay''' [1970] NZLR 1089  is a cited case in New Zealand regarding the defence of fair comment / honest opinion to a claim involving defamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
News Media's newspaper ''[[New Zealand Truth|Truth]]'' ran a campaign to bring back [[caning]]. In the process, they made allegations against opposition MP Findlay that his views to the contrary were based on the fact that as he was a lawyer, he was more interested in the extra legal fees an anti-caning policy would bring him, rather than any perceived interest in victims of domestic violence.

Findlay, later sued for defamation, and was later awarded $15,000. NMO appealed.

==Held==
The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal.

Ordbogen A/S&lt;ref&gt;{{Cvr|cvr=26404037|access-date=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; itself comprises several products: Two dictionary sites, Ordbogen.com and the forthcoming international site Lemma.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lemma.com|title=Lemma.com|website=lemma.com|access-date=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two online teaching resources Grammatip.com&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://grammatip.com|title=http://grammatip.com|website=grammatip.com|access-date=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; (grammar and spelling) and Educas.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://educas.com|title=Educas|website=educas.com|access-date=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; (all subjects of the Danish school system, 1st-10th grade).

==History and Evolution==
[[File:Ordbogen.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Ordbogen.com headquarters in Odense.]]

=== Origins ===
In 2001, Michael Walther, Bjarni Norddahl, Thomas Thomsen and Jacob Hatt founded the company Cool Systems ApS. Their associated website, coolsms.dk became one of the biggest websites in Denmark at that point in time, with 266,000 visits a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.computerworld.dk/art/74107/snart-slut-med-gratis-sms|title=Snart slut med gratis SMS|date=2002-03-19|access-date=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website allowed people to send text messages online at a lower price than the telephone companies’ usual price. Shortly after the release of coolsms.dk, Thomas Thomsen and Jacob Hatt left the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fyens.dk/erhverv/Rekordaar-for-Ordbogen-AS/artikel/2501428|title=Rekordår for Ordbogen A/S|date=2014-05-06|access-date=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the remaining founders, Michael Walther and Bjarni Norddahl, went on to change Cool Systems ApS to Ordbogen ApS, and later, converted to a public limited liability company - Ordbogen A/S'''.''' 2003 was also the year when Ordbogen A/S released Ordbogen.com - the first subscription-based dictionary website in Denmark,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://careers.ordbogen.com/|title=Careers at Ordbogen.com|website=careers.ordbogen.com|access-date=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; offering easy access to a high-quality Danish-English/English-Danish dictionary, edited by Jørgen Rohde,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gyldendal.dk/joergen-rohde|title=Gyldendal|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; translator and editor.

By 2005, the company replaced the previous dictionary with a new version tailored for web use, which was the company's first self-produced dictionary. That same year, Ordbogen also became strategic partners with the Centre for Lexicography at Aarhus University in order to publish their dictionary ''Den Danske Netordbog''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ordbogen.com/products/center-for-leksikografi/den-danske-netordbog.php?product_id=9|title=Den Danske Netordbog - Center for Leksikografi|website=Ordbogen.com|access-date=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Engl.: “the Danish Internet Dictionary”).

A year later, in 2006, Ordbogen A/S released their second bilingual and self-produced dictionary, Danish-German/German-Danish.

=== 2008-2013 ===
During this period, Ordbogen received the [[Børsen]] Gazelle award&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://borsen.dk/konferencer/gazeller.html|title=Gazeller|website=borsen.dk|access-date=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; six years in a row. In 2010, Ordbogen acquired the online grammar teaching system Grammatip, and that same year they entered into another strategic partnership with the publishers [[JP/Politikens Hus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://careers.ordbogen.com/files/the_evolution_of_ordbogen.pdf|title=Careers at Ordbogen|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the [[Dansk Sprognævn|Danish Language Council]], Dansk Sprognævn, in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dsn.dk/retskrivningsordbogen-i-eksamensperioden|title=Dansk Sprognævn|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Grammatip was merged with Ordbogen A/S. This was also the year that the online school platform Educas was launched. Educas had developed from Vikartimen, a teachers’ resource previously bought by Ordbogen A/S, whose name and concept was changed and further digitised.

2012 was also the year that Ordbogen became strategic partners with [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Dictionaries]] as well as German publishers [[Duden|Duden Schulbuch]] and [[Akademie Verlag|Cornelsen Verlag]], while 2013 was the year work started on Lemma.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://careers.ordbogen.com/files/the_evolution_of_ordbogen.pdf|title=Careers at Ordbogen|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2013-present ===
In recent years, Ordbogen.com has undergone significant development, and in 2016 many new additions to the staff were made. Ordbogen is currently in the process of expanding to international markets through their development of an international version of Ordbogen.com, the site Lemma.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://careers.ordbogen.com/|title=Careers at Ordbogen.com|website=careers.ordbogen.com|access-date=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products ==

=== Ordbogen.com ===
Ordbogen's flagship product is Ordbogen.com which, due to its international collaboration, makes Ordbogen.com the largest dictionary website in Denmark. Ordbogen&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ordbogen.com|title=Ordbogen.com - Danmarks største online ordbog.|website=www.ordbogen.com|access-date=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; has more than 100 dictionaries including:

=== Grammatip.com ===
Grammatip is an online educational tool for teaching Danish, English, German and French grammar and spelling to Danish elementary and secondary school children as well as to adults and foreigners. It is a dynamic product as new assignments are added to it every week. Users have the opportunity to suggest changes and edits, which Grammatip then incorporates when creating new categories and exercises. Grammatip covers several exercises such as:
* Danish spelling
* Spelling tests
* Dictations
* Danish reading tests&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammatip.com|title=https://www.grammatip.com|website=www.grammatip.com|access-date=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Educas.com ===
Educas is a web-based educational portal with thousands of exercises for all mandatory subjects and interdisciplinary themes for the public Danish elementary and secondary level school system (the “folkeskole”). The site is updated daily with new exercises. Educas.com and Grammatip.com are both online resources, and assignments are both given and completed online. Educas allows teachers to apply the site as a digital ”blackboard”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/company/ordbogen-a-s?trk=company_logo|title=Ordbogen A/S|access-date=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several times a year theme weeks are held that combine school topics with current events. The assignments are searchable through the Danish “Fælles Mål” (Engl. “common goals”), which are the official competence goals for the different school subjects at different grade levels of the “folkeskole”. Folkeskole courses include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://educas.com/|title=Educas|website=educas.com|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lemma will offer a lot of the same dictionaries as Ordbogen, but with such additions as:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lemma.com/|title=Lemma.com|website=lemma.com|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Achievements ==
Ordbogen was awarded as a Gazelle company 6 years in a row (2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013) by the Danish business newspaper [[Børsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/11/65432/artikel.html?hl=YToxOntpOjA7czoxMjoiT3JkYm9nZW4uY29tIjt9|title=Børsen|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gazelle award is given to Denmark's fastest growing companies. A gazelle is defined as a company which: "[...] has achieved a continuous growth in revenue or gross profit for the last four financial years, and which has, in total, more than doubled the revenue or the gross profit in the period".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://img.borsen.dk/img/cms/tuksi4/media/cmsmedia/2072_content_2_6996.pdf|title=Børsen|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Ordbogen set a Guinness World Record for world's largest dictionary, with a book measuring 4.62 m (15&amp;nbsp;ft 1.89 in) and 89,471 pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/thickest-book-unpublished|title=Thickest book unpublished|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book encompasses the 46 dictionaries which were available on www.ordbogen.com at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tv2fyn.dk/node/54501|title=Verdens største ordbog er fra Odense|date=2014-06-24|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4332">A '''Page of Testimony''' is a form issued by [[Yad Vashem]] (יד ושם) that asks for information about a [[Jewish]] victim of [[the Holocaust]].  Over 4.3 million Pages of Testimony have been submitted to Yad Vashem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/archive/hall-of-names/database |title=About the Yad Vashem Archives - Yad Vashem Archives |publisher=Yad Vashem |date=2010-02-16 |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; beginning in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/museum/holocaust-history-museum/hall-of-names?WT.mc_id=wiki |title=Hall of Names - The Holocaust History Museum |publisher=Yad Vashem |date=2010-02-16 |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of these, as well as other forms of documentation of [[Holocaust victims]], are searchable and viewable online through Yad Vashem's Central Database of Shoah Victims' Names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://db.yadvashem.org/names/search.html?language=en&amp;WT.mc_id=wiki |title=The Central Database of Shoah Victims' Names |publisher=Db.yadvashem.org |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pages of Testimony can be submitted online,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yvng.yadvashem.org/index.html?WT.mc_id=wiki|title=The Central Database of Shoah Victims' Names |publisher=Yadvashem.org |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; or downloaded,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/remembrance/names/pdf/pot_english_a4.pdf?WT.mc_id=wiki |title=Let No Holocaust Victim Be Forgotten |publisher=Yadvashem.org |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; printed, and mailed to Yad Vashem.  Downloadable forms are available in English, Hebrew, Russian, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian, Hungarian, and Dutch.  Though many Pages of Testimony are submitted by relatives of the victims, anyone can submit a Page of Testimony about any victim.

Through its Names Recovery Project, Yad Vashem actively solicits help collecting new Pages of Testimony, and provides resources for community outreach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/archive/hall-of-names/pages-of-testimony?WT.mc_id=yvscommunityguide |title=Remembrance |publisher=Yadvashem.org |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Details provided on Pages of Testimony vary, but can include genealogical, residential, occupational, and wartime information about the victims.  Submitters are named and their relationships to the victims, contact information (on the date of submission), and wartime status are sometimes recorded.

==Genealogical use==
Because of the extensive genealogical information often included on Pages of Testimony, the fact that the submitters were often related to the victims, and the large number of Pages of Testimony that have been collected, the Central Database of Shoah Victims' Names is frequently used by Jewish [[genealogists]] and others searching for ''living'' relatives.  As recently as 2006, siblings separated since [[World War II]] found each other through Page of Testimony research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucu94QAi4dA?WT.mc_id=wiki |title=Emotional Reunion of Siblings Separated During the Holocaust |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-04-24 |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14896842/ |title=Holocaust siblings reunited after 65 years - World news - Mideast/N. Africa &amp;#124; NBC News |publisher=MSNBC |date=2006-09-18 |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Yad Vashem's purpose in collecting Pages of Testimony is not genealogical, but commemorative.  A [[non-commercial]] website unaffiliated with Yad Vashem, ShoahConnect.org,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ShoahConnect.org |title=reunite families separated by the Shoah (Holocaust) |publisher=ShoahConnect.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; facilitates such Page of Testimony research by enabling email addresses to be associated with Pages of Testimony, and matching people associated with the same Pages.

Pal was born in [[Bangladesh]] and received his early schooling in [[Darjeeling]] and [[Calcutta]].&lt;ref name=BASC&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Pratapaditya Pal was awarded 'Padmashree'|url=http://home.bascweb.org/drpal|website=bascweb|publisher=Bengali Association of Southern California|accessdate=2 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518065459/http://home.bascweb.org/drpal|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studying at the [[University of Calcutta]], he hoped to specialize in [[anthropology]], but the university didn't offer any courses in the area in 1957, and he instead obtained a [[Master of Arts]] degree in ancient Indian history and culture.&lt;ref name="LAT Profile"/&gt; He continued at the university to earn a [[PhD]] in the history of [[Nepali architecture]] in 1962. He then won a scholarship to [[Cambridge University]], where in 1965 he earned a second PhD in Nepali sculpture and painting. However he failed to get a teaching job in India, and moved to the US instead.&lt;ref name="LAT Profile"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Muchnic|first1=Suzanne|authorlink1=Suzanne Muchnic|title=ART : Laboring Under No Illusions|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-11-20/entertainment/ca-65009_1_southeast-asian-art/|accessdate=2 May 2015|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=20 November 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1967 Pal was appointed the curator of the Indian art collection at [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Boston Museum]], a position that had previously been held by [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]]. In 1969, he moved to the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]], which was then beginning to develop its own collection of Indian art. Pal joined as the head of department of Indian and Islamic art, and subsequently served as the museum's acting director (1979–80) and as the senior curator of Indian and Southeast Asian art from 1981. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' art writer [[Suzanne Muchnic]] described his legacy as building the museum's collection from "a handful of items to about 4,000 pieces, giving LACMA one of the nation's preeminent holdings of Indian and Southeast Asian art."&lt;ref name="LAT Profile" /&gt;&lt;ref name=DIA&gt;{{cite web|title=Distinguished Indian Art Scholar Pratapaditya Pal to speak at Detroit Institute of Arts|url=http://www.dia.org/news/1656/Distinguished-Indian-Art-Scholar-Pratapaditya-Pal-to-speak-at-Detroit-Institute-of-Arts---Essence-of-Indian-art-and-its-relation-to-Hinduism,-Buddhism-and-Jainism-topic-of-talk.aspx|website=dia.org|publisher=[[Detroit Institute of Arts]]|accessdate=2 May 2015|date=29 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505075255/http://www.dia.org/news/1656/Distinguished-Indian-Art-Scholar-Pratapaditya-Pal-to-speak-at-Detroit-Institute-of-Arts---Essence-of-Indian-art-and-its-relation-to-Hinduism,-Buddhism-and-Jainism-topic-of-talk.aspx|archivedate=5 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Pal was appointed visiting curator of Indian, Himalayan and Southeast Asian Art at [[The Art Institute of Chicago]]. He moved to [[Norton Simon Museum]], [[Pasadena, California]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Artner|first1=Alan G.|title=Himalayas exhibit offers rare glimpse|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-04-06/news/0304060502_1_himalayan-art-southeast-asian-art-pratapaditya-pal|accessdate=2 May 2015|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=6 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the mid-1970s Pal had advised [[Norton Simon]] on acquiring Asian art for that museum.&lt;ref name="LAT Profile" /&gt;

'''Rosicrucian Park''' is the headquarters of the English Grand Lodge for the Americas of the [[Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis]], located in [[San Jose, California]].

==History==
The Rosicrucian Park was established in 1927 by [[Harvey Spencer Lewis]]. It grew from one single lot to a 5-acre city block.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Singh, [http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/09.12.02/rosicrucian-0237.html Ring Around the Rosy Cross], ''Metroactive.com'', 9 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum]] was built in 1932, the Planetarium in 1936, the research library opened in June 1939. The Akhenaton Shrine was built in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h3012.html Rosicrucian Park], ''Us-history.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Peace Garden was added to the park in 2004 and dedicated by [[Rosicrucian]] [[Imperator]] [[Christian Bernard]]. In 2013, a new Alchemy Museum was announced for 2020.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Singh, [http://www.metroactive.com/features/columns/Alchemy-Museum-Rosicrucian-Park.html Alchemy Museum Coming to Rosicrucian Park], ''Metroactive.com'', 22 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rosicrucianpark.org/alchemy-museum|title=New Rosicrucian Alchemy Museum|last=Rosicrucian Order|first=AMORC|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening ceremony for the preliminary exhibit in the Lecture Gallery of the [[Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum]] occurred during the Summer solstice of June 2015. The new museum in the former Rose-Croix University International building will include a working alchemy laboratory. The Alchemy garden in front of the new museum is composed of four elemental gardens representing the four elements.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Singh, [http://www.metroactive.com/features/columns/Alchemy-Museum-Rosicrucian-Egyptian-Museum.html Alchemy for You], ''Metroactive.com'', 1 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gary Singh, [http://www.metroactive.com/features/columns/Rosicrucian-alchemy-museum-garden.html Alchemy Garden Opens in San Jose], ''Metroactive.com'', 23 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2009 to 2015, the Park reduced its water consumption by 4.5 million gallons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecologicalconcerns.com/rosicrucian-park-and-egyptian-museum-reduced-water-usage-by-4-5-million-gallons/ Rosicrucian Park and Egyptian Museum Reduced Water Usage by 4.5 Million Gallons], ''Ecologicalconcerns.com'', 16 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The park takes up nearly an entire city block and includes the [[Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum]], the administration building for the Order, the Rosicrucian Planetarium, the Rosicrucian Peace Garden, the Rosicrucian Research Library, the Grand Temple, and a central fountain plaza and gardens. A [[rose]] garden is incorporated in the Park next to the Research Library. A [[Metasequoia glyptostroboides|dawn redwood]] grows outside of the Rosicrucian Research Library as a memorial to [[Harvey Spencer Lewis|H. Spencer Lewis]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Clara|date=March 1980|title=Tree from the Dawn of Time|url=|journal=Rosicrucian Digest|volume=58 March 1980|pages=22-23|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was planted in 1950 from a seedling from the lot brought from China by Dr. Ralph Chaney,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 1951|title=Temple Echoes|url=|journal=Rosicrucian Digest|volume=Vol 29 #5|pages=180|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and donated by an unnamed donor to H. Spencer Lewis's widow for this purpose.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The park also includes the Akhenaten Shrine (named for the [[18th dynasty]] Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]]), which contains the ashes of AMORC founder [[Harvey Spencer Lewis]] and other former officials of the order.

With the exception of the planetarium, all buildings in Rosicrucian Park were constructed with exteriors inspired by the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian architectural tradition. In tribute to their claimed Egyptian heritage, [[cyperus papyrus]] plants are also incorporated into the landscaping.

[[File:JFK limousine.png|thumb|right|Picture of President Kennedy in the limousine in Dallas, Texas, on Main Street, minutes before the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]]. Also in the presidential limousine are Jackie Kennedy, Texas Governor John Connally, and his wife, Nellie.]]

'''SS-100-X''' was the [[U.S. Secret Service]] code name for the [[Presidential state car (United States)#Age of automobiles (1950–1969)|presidential limousine]] originally used by the [[List of Presidents of the United States|35th]] President of the United States, [[John F. Kennedy]]. The [[limousine]] is the car in which Kennedy and First Lady [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]] were passengers when the President was [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]] in [[Dallas|Dallas, Texas]] on November 22, 1963.

Following Kennedy's assassination, the car received significant armor plating and a bullet-proof hardtop and its navy blue exterior was painted black. It resumed its role as a presidential limousine for President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] until 1967 and later remained in service until 1978, when it was sent to the [[The Henry Ford#Henry Ford Museum|Henry Ford Museum]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]].&lt;ref name="thehenryford.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehenryford.org/research/kennedyLimo.aspx|title=Kennedy Presidential Limousine|publisher=The Henry Ford |accessdate=November 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specifications==
[[File:1961 Lincoln model 74A.jpg|thumb|The car on display in the [[Henry Ford Museum]]]] 
SS-100-X was originally a standard 1961 [[Lincoln Continental#Fourth generation (1961–1969)|Lincoln Continental four door convertible]] (model 74A) built by the Ford Motor Company and assembled at the [[Wixom, Michigan]] plant. It had a retail price of $7,347 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|7347|1961|r=0}}}}, as of {{inflation-year|US}}{{Inflation-fn|US}}).

The car was moved to the Experimental Garage at the Ford Proving Grounds where an additional 41 inches was added between the front and rear doors and just beyond the rear doors.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The car's frame was strengthened to accommodate the additional length and weight. It was painted a special [[navy blue]] color and taken to [[Hess &amp; Eisenhardt]] of [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], for reupholstering and further modifications to [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] specifications.{{clarify|There appear to be dueling contentions where significant physical modifications were made|date=January 2017}} During the refit the car had no bulletproof or bullet-resistant additions added. The windshield remained the standard two-ply safety glass which could be easily replaced at any dealership.

It was first delivered to the [[White House]] on June 15, 1961 and measured {{convert|255|in|m}} long, had a wheelbase of {{convert|156|in|m}}, was {{convert|78.6|in|m}} wide, and {{convert|57|in|m}} high.  It weighed {{convert|7,800|lb|kg}}, up {{convert|1,585|lb|kg}} from factory weight, and was powered by a hand-built 350-[[horsepower]] {{convert|430|cuin|cm3|adj=on}} [[Ford MEL engine]].

An open car, the Lincoln was equipped with an assortment of tops, including a snap-together bubble top, a black cover for the bubble, a formal rear top and a [[stainless steel]] forward section (none of which were [[bulletproof]]). It also featured two-way radio telephones&lt;ref name="thehenryford.org"/&gt; and retractable steps and grab-handles for [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents. No armor plate was added to the bodywork, but the [[Chassis|undercarriage]] and all [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] components were strengthened. A [[hydraulic]]ally-lifted rear seat was fitted. At the time of the assassination, the Lincoln had been fitted with a 1962-model front clip ([[Fender (vehicle)|fender]]s, hood, [[grille]] and bumper assemblies).

It had a special short-turn radius, {{convert|61.9|ft|m}}, compared to {{convert|64|ft|m}} on the 1950 Eisenhower "bubbletop" which had been its predecessor.  Total cost of modifications was approximately $200,000 (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-GDP|200000|1961}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-GDP}}{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}). The limousine was registered to the Ford Motor Company and was leased to the Secret Service for a nominal fee of $500 per year (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|500|1961}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}{{inflation-fn|US}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarsweekly.com/news/editors-picks/ss-100-x-lincoln-became-part-history-jfk-tragedy|title=SS-100-X Lincoln became part of history with JFK tragedy|publisher=www.oldcarsweekly.com|accessdate=November 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The limousine carried the District of Columbia license plate GG 300. In November 2015, the license plates were sold at auction for $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=JFK licence plates sell for $100,000 at auction |first= |last= |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-34759098 |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=November 8, 2015 |accessdate=November 25, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kennedy assassination==
[[File:John F. Kennedy motorcade, Dallas crop.png|thumb|right|JFK, Jackie, and the Connallys in the presidential limousine.]]
On November 21, 1963 SS-100-X was loaded onto a [[Fairchild C-123 Provider]] piloted by Captain Thomason of the [[76th Air Transport Squadron]] and flown to San Antonio and then onto [[Dallas Love Field]] where it was stored in an underground car park.

Following the shooting of President Kennedy and Governor Connally at approximately 12:30 pm, SS-100-X was driven to [[Parkland Memorial Hospital]]. The [[Plexiglas]] bubble top and cloth cover were then attached. Later that afternoon at 3:30 pm CST, the limousine was taken to Love Field and loaded on a [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] and flown to [[Andrews Air Force Base]], Washington DC, landing at 8 pm EST. After arrival at Andrews AFB, the limo was delivered to the White House garage. The Secret Service and later the FBI took photos of the limo's interior and searched it for evidence before it was thoroughly cleaned and valeted.

==Post-assassination==
In late December 1963, the car was sent back to Hess &amp; Eisenhardt to be modified further, and was rebuilt from the ground up. For protection, the Lincoln received [[titanium]] armor plating, bullet-resistant glass and a bulletproof permanent roof. Solid aluminium rims were also fitted inside the tires to make them flat-proof. It remained in service for an additional eight years, logging 50,000 miles on the ground and over one million miles being flown to and from its destinations. The vehicle was equipped with Presidential lap robes and [[Mouton fur|mouton]] carpeting and a complete communications system including radio patch to the White House. It was replaced in 1967 and remained in service doing less important duties until 1978, when it was retired to the [[The Henry Ford#Henry Ford Museum|Henry Ford Museum]]. Finished originally in navy blue, the car was repainted black after the assassination, then repainted again{{clarify|In what color(s)?|date=January 2017}} after each assignment.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.cnn.com/2009-03-18/living/aa.obama.limo_1_jfk-protective-aol-autos/2?_s=PM:LIVING{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Secret Service agent [[Clint_Hill_(Secret_Service)|Clint Hill]], who leapt onto the limousine directly after Kennedy was shot, is the last surviving passenger of the presidential limousine during the assassination.

'''saynoto0870.com''' is a [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[website]] with a directory of [[non-geographic numbers|non-geographic telephone numbers]] and their geographic alternatives.

The website, which primarily started as a directory of cheaper alternatives to [[0870]] numbers (hence the name), also lists geographic-rate (01, 02 or 03) or free-to-caller (080) alternatives for [[0843]], [[0844]], [[0845]], [[0871]], [[0872]], and [[0873]] revenue-share numbers.

The vast majority of telephone numbers are submitted by visitors to the website,&lt;ref name="money_2249470"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/bills/article-2249470/Phone-rage-HMRC-calls-cost-customers-130million-year.html | title=£2 to talk to the taxman: HMRC phone delays leave customers with £33 MILLION a year in call charges | work=[[This is Money]] | date=18 December 2012 | last=Monk | first=Ed | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719180153/http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/bills/article-2249470/Phone-rage-HMRC-calls-cost-customers-130million-year.html | archivedate=2013-07-19 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the discussion board also offers a place for visitors to request alternative telephone numbers if they are not included in the database. Some companies that advertise a non-geographic number will also offer a number for calling from abroad - usually starting '''+44 1''' or '''+44 2''' - this number can be used within the UK (removing the '''+44''' and replacing it with '''0''') to avoid the cost of calling non-geographic telephone numbers. Some companies will also offer a geographic alternative if asked.

== Motivations behind the website ==
* Organisations using 084, 087 and 09 non-geographic telephone numbers (except for 0870 numbers from 1 August 2009&lt;ref name="sun_66038"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/money/66038/Dial-R-for-rip-off.html | title=Dial R for 'rip off' | last=Noseda | first=Holly | work=The Sun | date=1 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to 1 July 2015&lt;ref name="ukcalling_numbers"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ukcalling.info/faqs#a-9 | title=UK Calling: FAQs (Which numbers are affected?) | publisher=Ofcom | date=1 July 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701114332/http://www.ukcalling.info/faqs | archivedate=2015-07-01 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;) automatically impose a Service Charge on all callers. Calls to 01, 02 and 03 numbers, standard 07 mobile numbers and 080 numbers do ''not'' attract such an additional charge.
* The revenue derived from the Service Charge is used by the call recipient to cover the call handling and call routing costs incurred at their end of the call. Any excess is paid out under a "revenue share" agreement or may be used as a contribution towards meeting other expenses such as a lease for switchboard equipment.
* Non-geographic telephone numbers beginning 084 and 087 have increasingly been employed for inappropriate uses such as bookings, renewals, refunds, cancellations, customer services and complaints, and for contacting public services including essential health services.
* Most landline providers offer 'inclusive' calls of up to one hour to standard telephone numbers (those beginning with 01, 02 or 03), while calls to 084 and 087 numbers are usually chargeable.
* Mobile telephones on a contract offer hundreds of minutes per month of 'inclusive' calls to standard telephone numbers, while calls to 084 and 087 telephone numbers are always chargeable.
* Calls to most 084 and 087 non-geographic telephone numbers are generally not included in bundled minutes from landlines and even less so from mobile telephones. However, a small number of landline providers do include 0870 and a smaller number include 0845 telephone numbers in some of their call packages.
* Calls to 084 and 087 non-geographic telephone numbers have a much larger Access Charge if called from a mobile telephone, than if called from a landline, making the call price from mobile telephones excessive.
* Before 1 July 2015, calls to [[0800]] and [[0808]] numbers were chargeable when called from most contract and pay-as-you-go mobile telephones.&lt;ref name="ukcalling_0800"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ukcalling.info/freephone | title=UK Calling: Freephone | publisher=Ofcom | date=1 July 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701114335/http://www.ukcalling.info/freephone | archivedate=2015-07-01 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calls to 0500 numbers remained chargeable from mobile telephones.&lt;ref name="ukcalling_0500"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ukcalling.info/faqs#a-20 | title=UK Calling: FAQs (Will 0500 Freephone numbers become free to call from mobiles?) | publisher=Ofcom | date=1 July 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701114332/http://www.ukcalling.info/faqs | archivedate=2015-07-01 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; until closure of this range on 3 June 2017.&lt;ref name="ftc_0500"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fairtelecoms.org.uk/closure-of-0500-range | title=Closure of 0500 range | publisher=Fair Telecoms Campaign | date=14 March 2017 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170316153412/http://www.fairtelecoms.org.uk/closure-of-0500-range.html | archivedate=2017-03-16 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Smithsonian Folkways''' is the nonprofit record label of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. It is a part of the Smithsonian's [[Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage]], located at Capital Gallery in downtown [[Washington, D.C.]] The label was founded in 1987 after the family of [[Moses Asch]], founder of [[Folkways Records]], donated the entire Folkways Records label to the Smithsonian. The donation was made on the condition that the Institution continue Asch's policy that each of the more than 2,000 albums of Folkways Records remain in print forever, regardless of sales. Since then, the label has expanded on Asch's vision of documenting the sounds of the world, adding six other record labels to the collection, as well as releasing over 300 new recordings. Some well-known artists have contributed to the Smithsonian Folkways collection, including [[Pete Seeger]], [[Ella Jenkins]], [[Woody Guthrie]], and [[Lead Belly]]. Famous songs include "[[This Land Is Your Land]]", "[[Goodnight, Irene]]", and "[[Midnight Special (song)|Midnight Special]]." Due to the unique nature of its recordings, which include an extensive collection of traditional American music, children's music, and international music, Smithsonian Folkways has become an important collection to the musical community, especially to [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologists]], who utilize the recordings of "people's music" from all over the world.

==History==

The Smithsonian Folkways Recordings label arose when the Smithsonian acquired a vast collection of recordings from Folkways Records, maintained by Moses Asch. The original 2,168 titles produced by Folkways Records now make up the bulk of the label's collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.folklife.si.edu/archives_resources/collections/asch.aspx | title = Moses and Frances Asch Collection | accessdate = 2013-01-02 | author = Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folkways Records===
{{Main|Folkways Records|Moses Asch}}
In 1905, Moses "Moe" Asch was born in Poland. His father, [[Sholem Asch]], a successful author, made enough money to move the family to Paris in 1912. In 1914, Sholem left Paris for work in New York City and, a year later, sent for his family. The experience at [[Ellis Island]] was traumatic for 10-year-old Moe, and, based on his own account, memory was seared into his mind. Sholem believed in educating his fellow man through his literature, and Moe showed that same passion through his chosen career of audio engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Carlin, Richard (2008). ''Worlds of Sound'', pp.2–3. New York:HarperCollins Publishers. {{ISBN|978-0-06-156355-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1920s, Asch studied radio engineering in Germany, a center for the new science. When he returned to the United States, he worked for various electronic firms before opening his own radio repair business, Radio Labs, during the [[Great Depression]]. In this business, Moe built equipment for radio stations and installed recorders for air use.&lt;ref&gt;Carlin, Richard (2008). ''Worlds of Sound'', p.3. New York:HarperCollins Publishers. {{ISBN|978-0-06-156355-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Asch wrote in a 1961 article, "Forming one of the first independent record companies it was natural for me to want to record folk music and people's expression of their wants, needs and experiences."&lt;ref&gt;Asch, Moses (Feb/March 1961). "Folk Music – A Personal Statement". ''[[Sing Out!]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, Sholem invited his son with him to New Jersey to meet physicist and humanitarian [[Albert Einstein]], who encouraged Moe to record and document the sounds of the world, which Asch took to be his life calling. Soon after that meeting, in early 1940, Asch founded ''Asch Records'' with a small staff and studio located in downtown Manhattan, New York. He allowed any artist to come and record at no charge, in contrast to bigger studios that charged artists fees for using recording equipment. Because of his open-door policy, Asch attracted many young and/or unique "would-be" artists. Due to the [[American Federation of Musicians]]' [[1942–44 musicians' strike|1942 strike]] against major record labels, small labels such as Asch's filled the void in sales for distributors. The label grew and became more successful through deals with other producers, including [[Norman Granz]]. This partnership proved successful, leading to the concept of recording live concerts. These recordings came close to Asch's vision of documenting "real" sound, and, because there were no studio fees, were less expensive to produce. Around this time, Asch began another record label, [[Disc Records]], though this fell through in a short time. Asch received recordings from Granz of an up-and-coming pianist named [[Nat King Cole|Nat Cole]], which he decided to issue on a record in fall 1946. He invested a large amount of money in publicity and advertising, for the first time attempting to break into the pop charts. Due to a snowstorm, shipping was delayed past the holiday rush, causing Asch Records to fall into [[bankruptcy]]. As one of the terms of his bankruptcy, Asch was barred from starting another label. To get around this, in July 1948, Marian Distler, Asch's longtime assistant, became the president of a new label, Folkways Records and Service Corporation. Asch was hired as her "consultant," and Folkways Records was created. It was at this time that Asch created his plan for keeping all of the Folkways records in print, regardless of demand. In this way, he figured that demand, though small, would continue for decades. He famously remarked, "Just because the letter ''J'' is less popular than the letter ''S'', you don't take it out of the dictionary."&lt;ref&gt;Carlin, Richard (2008). ''Worlds of Sound'', pp.4–11. New York:HarperCollins Publishers. {{ISBN|978-0-06-156355-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Folkways Records released over 2,000 recordings between the years 1949 and 1987, spanning many genres, including [[jazz music|jazz]], [[folk music|folk]], [[classical music|classical]], [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]], and [[world music|world]] music. Over the years of Folkways Records, Asch recorded some of the biggest names in music, including [[Woody Guthrie]], [[Lead Belly]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[James P. Johnson]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[John Cage]], and [[Charles Ives]]. Reissues of the early blues and folk recordings from Folkways, such as [[Harry Everett Smith|Harry Smith's]] well-known ''[[Anthology of American Folk Music]]'', fueled several generations of folk revivals, inspiring young musicians such as [[Dave van Ronk]], [[Peter, Paul, and Mary]], and [[Bob Dylan]].&lt;ref&gt;Rogovoy, Seth (Summer 2002). "Moe Asch: Collector of Culture". ''Pakn Treger'', pp.8–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smithsonian Institution===
In 1984, looking for someone to continue the Folkways Records collection after him, Asch found [[Ralph Rinzler]], who was then artistic director of the Smithsonian's annual [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival|Folklife Festival]]. Asch saw that the Smithsonian had the power to keep the collection alive and keep the sounds of the world in the people's hands.&lt;ref&gt;Burdick, Alan (01 July 2001). "Now Hear This: historic sound recordings at Smithsonian Folkways Records". ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harpers Magazine]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Asch stipulated one main condition: that every recording was to remain "in print" forever, regardless of its sales. It was the way that he began the label, and he felt that the people deserved to have the sounds of the world preserved. There was opposition to the transfer, with some members of the Smithsonian citing the Folkways collection's "uneven quality" and "balance of repertory." Despite these criticisms, Rinzler persevered, and negotiations with Asch continued. Asch died in 1986 before the deal was completed, but his family finished the passing of the Folkways Records to the Smithsonian in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Carlin, Richard (2008). ''Worlds of Sound'', pp.252–255. New York:HarperCollins Publishers. {{ISBN|978-0-06-156355-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional acquisitions==
The collection became known as the Moses and Frances Asch Collection, part of the [[Ralph Rinzler Folklife Archives and Collections]] housed in the Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage. The recordings on other labels, including Paredon Records, [[Cook Records|Cook]], [[Collector Records|Collector]], [[Dyer-Bennet]], [[Fast Folk]], [[Monitor Records (New York)|Monitor]], [[M.O.R.E.]]  [[The Mickey Hart Collection]], [[Arhoolie Records]], and [[Bobby Susser]] Songs For Children have since been added to the collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.folklife.si.edu/archives_resources/about.aspx “About the Ralph Rinzler Archives and Collections”]. [http://www.folklife.si.edu Smithsonian Folkways]. Retrieved 2010-05-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
After the creation of the collection in the Smithsonian Archives, only two full-time positions were funded. Rinzler recruited [[Anthony Seeger]], well known in the ethnomusicology community as director of the Archives of Traditional Music at [[Indiana University]], as director, and a full-time archivist, Jeff Place. The Smithsonian also stipulated a condition regarding the transfer: if they accepted the label, it would have to support itself through its sales. Seeger and Place had no experience running a record label, but took on the project. Though they could not retain all of Asch's business practices, they managed to preserve the essence of Folkways Records while creating the new label, Smithsonian Folkways. The label now relies on a small team of full-time staff, part-time staff, interns, and volunteers to continue the mission of Smithsonian Folkways.&lt;ref&gt;Carlin, Richard (2008).

==Projects==
Smithsonian Folkways is engaged in several projects dedicated to increasing the awareness and use of their recordings, as well as the preservation of them.

===Digital distribution===
As part of their mission in spreading the sounds of the world, Smithsonian Folkways has made the recordings of their archives available digitally in various ways, in addition to retail distribution of CDs (some titles [[Manufacture on demand|Manufactured on Demand]]) and LPs.

====Smithsonian Global Sound====
{{Further|Smithsonian Global Sound}}
In February 2005, Smithsonian Folkways launched [[Smithsonian Global Sound]], an online MP3 music store, similar to programs such as Apple's [[iTunes]]. The entire collection was made available online, at the cost of $0.99 per track. Smithsonian Folkways pays royalties to all the artists (and if the artists cannot be found, the money is put in [[escrow]]).&lt;ref&gt;Trescott, Jacqueline (April 1, 2005). "Smithsonian Folkways to Open MP3 Music Store". ''Washington Post'', p.C01.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the brand name Smithsonian Global Sound has been altered to provide the entire collection online for [[streaming media|streaming]] for subscribing institutions, such as universities, via the Smithsonian Global Sound for Libraries service, a co-production with [[Alexander Street Press]].

====folkways.si.edu====
Smithsonian Folkways now offers the entire Folkways collection for digital download through its website, at $0.99 for most songs and $9.99 for most albums, available in both [[MP3]] and [[FLAC]] format. In addition, Smithsonian Folkways distributes digitally via outlets such as [[iTunes]] and [[eMusic]].&lt;ref&gt;(May 25, 2006). "Gigs &amp; Bytes:Downloading Woody". ''Pollstar''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jazz: The Smithsonian Anthology====

In 2012 Smithsonian Folkways released ''[[Woody At 100: The Woody Guthrie Centennial Collection]]'', a 150-page large-format book with 3 CDs containing 57 tracks, including Woody Guthrie's most important recordings such as the complete version of "[[This Land Is Your Land]]," "Pretty Boy Floyd," "I Ain't Got No Home in This World Anymore," and "Riding in My Car."

==folkwaysAlive!==
folkwaysAlive! was  a partnership between Smithsonian Folkways and the [[University of Alberta]] established in 2002–2003 by professors Regula Qureshi and Michael Frishkopf with support from then VP Research Gary Kachanoski, aiming to create a "national centre of musical and cultural excellence." Originally conceived as a part of the [http://www.music.museums.ualberta.ca/CanadianCentreForEthnomusicology.aspx Canadian Centre for Ethnomusicology], folkwaysAlive! subsequently operated independently within the University of Alberta's Faculty of Arts. The mission was to create a research center for the music of the cultures of Alberta and western Canada, as well as cultures from around the world. The center invited local and visiting musicians and artists to present lectures and workshops. The partnership concluded December 31, 2016.  As a consequence, folkwaysAlive! no longer exists at the University of Alberta, but has been superseded by a more broadly-conceived entity, the [http://soundstudies.ualberta.ca/ Sound Studies Initiative].

==Save Our Sounds==
In 2003, Smithsonian Folkways, in conjunction with the American Folklife Center at the [[Library of Congress]], began a project called "Save Our Sounds" that aims at preserving the sounds vital to our nation's history which are deteriorating, such as [[Thomas Edison]]'s recordings made on [[wax cylinder]]s and others done on [[acetate disc]]s in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;January 27, 2003. "What's that Sound?: Could be anything at the Library of Congress". ''The Holland Sentinel'', p.A12.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Save America's Treasures'' program initiated by the White House Millennium Council awarded a matching grant of $750,000 for the project. The goal of the project is to expose the nation to the need for sound preservation, and to protect the most important and "priceless" records from the combined collections.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/folklife/sos/index.html “Save Our Sounds:America’s Recorded Sound Heritage Project”].

[[Image:Stevensblack.jpg|thumb|Stephens-Black House]]

'''The Stephens-Black House''' is a 19th-century house featured in [[Historic Richmond Town]] on [[Staten Island]], [[New York City]].

The deed to the Stephens-Black House suggests that its construction began shortly after 2 February 1837. It is located on a 25 by 100 foot plot at the corners of Center Street and Court Place. It was built in a modified [[Greek Revival]] style which is most apparent in the eyebrow windows located on the third level of the home. The main floor of the original structure included a side hall entry with two adjoining formal parlors. The second floor originally housed three large bedrooms. The third parlor was added onto the western side of the structure sometime after 1840. Two more bedrooms were the added above the third parlor. The basement of the structure houses both a functioning 1830's kitchen and what was once the home's dining room. The adjoining [[General store|General Store]] was built as a series of additions between 1840 and 1870.

Stephen Dover Stephens, born in 1808, was the original owner. He owned the home and operated the store between 1837 and 1870. He was married to Elizabeth Johnson in 1829 at Saint Andrew's Church, which is also located in [[Richmondtown]]. Their five children Stephen Dover Jr., William James, Lucretia, Mary Elizabeth Jr, and Charlotte Ann were all baptized at that same church.

In 1870 both the home and the connected store were sold to Mary and Joseph Black. The Stephens family then moved up the road to the Stephens Prior House. Mr and Mrs. Stephens both resided there until their deaths in 1883. The Black family raised eleven children in the home and their family operated the store until 1926. In 1926 the remaining members of the Black family sold the store to Willet and Bertha Conner  whom operated a [[post office]] in the store until the time of [[World War II|the Second World War]]. After which the house was separated into two apartments and rented until the mid-1960s when it became property of [[Historic Richmond Town]].

== History ==
In February 2017, WikiLeaks began teasing the release of "Vault 7" with a series of cryptic messages on Twitter, according to media reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dwilson |first=Stephanie Dube |url=http://heavy.com/tech/2017/02/what-is-vault-7-wikileaks-theories-vault7-tweets-photos-analysis-clues-twitter-who-where-when-why-how/ |title=What Is Vault 7 on WikiLeaks? |date=7 February 2017 |work=Heavy |accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on in February, WikiLeaks released classified documents describing how the CIA monitored the [[2012 French presidential election]].&lt;ref name="Daily Beast"/&gt; The press release for the leak stated that it was published "as context for its forthcoming CIA Vault 7 series."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wikileaks.org/cia-france-elections-2012/ |title=CIA espionage orders for the 2012 French presidential election |publisher=WikiLeaks |date=16 February 2017 |accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, US intelligence and law enforcement officials said to the international wire agency [[Reuters]] that they have been aware of the CIA security breach, which led to Vault 7, since late-2016. Two officials said they were focusing on "contractors" as the possible source of the leaks.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters: [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cia-wikileaks-leak-idUSKBN16F2CZ U.S intel, law enforcement officials aware of CIA breach since late last year], 8 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, federal law enforcement identified CIA software engineer Joshua Adam Schulte as a suspected source of Vault 7.&lt;ref name=Post180515&gt;{{cite news | last = Harris | first = Shane | title = U.S. identifies suspect in major leak of CIA hacking tools | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-identifies-suspect-in-major-leak-of-cia-hacking-tools/2018/05/15/5d5ef3f8-5865-11e8-8836-a4a123c359ab_story.html | newspaper = The Washington Post | date = May 15, 2018 | access-date = May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shane |first1=Scott |last2=Goldman |first2=Adam |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/15/us/cia-hacking-tools-leak.html |title=Suspect Identified in C.I.A.

== Publications ==

=== Part 1 ===
The first batch of documents named "Year Zero" was published by WikiLeaks on 7 March 2017, consisting of 7,818 web pages with 943 attachments, purportedly from the Center for Cyber Intelligence,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/wikileaks-cia-documents-released-cyber-intelligence/|title=WikiLeaks claims to release thousands of CIA documents|last=|first=|date=7 March 2017|publisher=CBS News|agency=Associated Press|access-date=7 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which already contains more pages than former [[National Security Agency|NSA]] contractor and leaker, [[Edward Snowden]]'s [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|NSA release]].&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/wikileaks-cia-vault-7-julian-assange-year-zero-documents-download-spying-secrets-a7616031.html|title=WikiLeaks publishes massive trove of CIA spying files in 'Vault 7' release|date=7 March 2017|access-date=7 March 2017|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; WikiLeaks did not name the source, but said that the files had "circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive."&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; According to WikiLeaks, the source "wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of [[cyberweapon]]s" since these tools raise questions that "urgently need to be debated in public, including whether the C.I.A.'s hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency."&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

WikiLeaks redacted names and other identifying information from the documents before their release,&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; while attempting to allow for connections between people to be drawn via [[unique identifier]]s generated by WikiLeaks.&lt;ref name="wikileaks-primary-uid"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/|accessdate=10 March 2017|title=Vault7 - Home|publisher=[[WikiLeaks]]|at="Redactions" section}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ars Technica"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/03/wikileaks-publishes-what-it-says-is-trove-of-cia-hacking-tools/|title=Wikileaks publishes docs from what it says are CIA hacking trove|date=7 March 2017|access-date=7 March 2017|work=Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also said that it would postpone releasing the source code for the cyber weapons, which is reportedly several hundred million lines long, "until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the C.I.A.'s program and how such 'weapons' should be analyzed, disarmed and published."&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; WikiLeaks founder [[Julian Assange]] claimed this was only part of a larger series.&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt;

The CIA released a statement saying, "The American public should be deeply troubled by any WikiLeaks disclosure designed to damage the Intelligence Community's ability to protect America against terrorists or other adversaries. Such disclosures not only jeopardize US personnel and operations, but also equip our adversaries with tools and information to do us harm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Berke |first=Jeremy |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/cia-responds-to-wikileaks-disclosure-2017-3 |title=CIA: Americans 'should be deeply troubled' by WikiLeaks' disclosure |date=8 March 2017 |work=Business Insider |accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assange held a press conference on 9 March to offer to share unpublished data from Vault 7 with technology companies to enable them to fix vulnerabilities detailed therein. He stated that only 1% of the total leak has been released and that much of the remainder of the leak included unpatched vulnerabilities but that he was working with Microsoft, Apple and Google to get these vulnerabilities patched as he would not release information which would put the public at risk, and as fixes were released by manufacturers he would release details of vulnerabilities. As such, none of the vulnerabilities currently released are [[zero-day exploit]]s. In this press release Assange also read an official statement by Microsoft which stated Microsoft's desire for the "''next Geneva Convention''" which would protect people from government cyber weapons the same way the previous [[Geneva Conventions]] have protected noncombatants from warfare.&lt;ref name=transc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://steemit.com/wikileaks/@ausbitbank/wikileaks-vault-7-march-9th-press-conference-transcript|title=Wikileaks Vault 7 March 9th Press Conference [Full Transcript] — Steemit|date=10 March 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement issued on 19 March 2017, Assange said the technology companies who had been contacted had not agreed, disagreed or questioned what he termed as WikiLeaks' standard industry disclosure plan. The standard disclosure time for a vulnerability is 90 days after the company responsible for patching the software is given full details of the flaw.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Evans (computer security expert)|Chris Evans]], [[Ben Hawkes]]: [https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.de/2015/02/feedback-and-data-driven-updates-to.html Feedback and data-driven updates to Google’s disclosure policy], ''[[Google]]'s [[Project Zero (Google)|Project Zero]] blog'', 13 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; According to WikiLeaks, only [[Mozilla]] had been provided with information on the vulnerabilities, while "Google and some other companies" only confirmed receiving the initial notification. WikiLeaks stated: "Most of these lagging companies have conflicts of interest due to their classified work with US government agencies. In practice such associations limit industry staff with US security clearances from fixing holes based on leaked information from the CIA. Should such companies choose to not secure their users against CIA or NSA attacks users may prefer organizations such as Mozilla or European companies that prioritize their users over government contracts".&lt;ref name="iTWire20March"&gt;Sam Varghese: [http://www.itwire.com/security/77349-vault-7-plans-to-expose-firms-that-do-not-patch-flaws.html Vault 7: Plans to expose firms that do not patch flaws], ''iTWire'', 20 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/324749-assange-chastises-companies-who-havent-responded-to-cia-vulnerability Assange chastises companies that haven't responded to CIA vulnerability offers], ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', 20 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 March 2017 WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 2 "Dark Matter".

=== Part 3 ===

On 31 March 2017 WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 3 "Marble". It contained 676 source code files for the CIA's Marble Framework. It is used to obfuscate, or scramble, [[malware]] code in an attempt to make it so that anti-virus firms or investigators cannot understand the code or attribute its source. According to WikiLeaks, the code also included a de-obfuscator to reverse the obfuscation effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Hyacinth |last=Mascarenhas |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/wikileaks-marble-files-latest-leak-exposes-how-cia-disguises-its-own-hacking-attacks-1614811 |title=WikiLeaks 'Marble' files: Latest leak exposes how CIA disguises its own hacking attacks |date=1 April 2017 |work=International Business Times |accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://heavy.com/tech/2017/03/wikileaks-vault-7-part-3-marble-cia-tool-to-mask-hacks-hacking-russian-chinese-arabic-decoy-languages-attribute/|title=WikiLeaks Vault 7 Part 3 Reveals CIA Tool Might Mask Hacks as Russian, Chinese, Arabic|last=Dwilson|first=Stephanie Dube|date=2017-03-31|work=[[Heavy.com]]|access-date=2017-04-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Part 4 ===
On 7 April 2017 WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 4 dubbed "Grasshopper". The publication contains 27 documents from the CIA's Grasshopper framework, which is used by the CIA to build customized and persistent malware payloads for the Microsoft Windows operating systems. Grasshopper focused on Personal Security Product (PSP) avoidance. PSPs are [[antivirus software]] such as [[Microsoft Security Essentials|MS Security Essentials]], [[Symantec Endpoint Protection|Symantec Endpoint]] or [[Kaspersky Internet Security|Kaspersky IS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wikileaks-vault-7-series-the-grasshopper-framework_us_58e7bf35e4b0acd784ca57a7|title=Wikileaks Vault 7 Series - The Grasshopper Framework|last=Supervizer|first=Payman|date=2017-04-07|website=[[Huffington Post]]|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/cia-files-wikileaks-vault-7|title=WikiLeaks drops 'Grasshopper' documents, part four of its CIA Vault 7 files|last=Burgess|first=Matt|date=2017-04-07|work=[[WIRED UK]]|access-date=2017-04-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Part 5 ===
On 14 April 2017 WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 5, titled "HIVE". Based on the CIA top-secret virus program created by its "Embedded Development Branch" (EDB). The six documents published by WikiLeaks are related to the HIVE multi-platform CIA malware suite. A CIA back-end infrastructure with a public-facing [[HTTPS]] interface used by CIA to transfer information from target desktop computers and smartphones to the CIA, and open those devices to receive further commands from CIA operators to execute specific tasks. Also called Listening Post (LP), and Command and Control (C2). All of the above while hiding its presence behind unsuspicious-looking public [[Domain name|domains]]. This masking interface is known as "Switchblade".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wikileaks-vault-7-series-hive_us_58f0a299e4b0156697224e4a|title=Wikileaks Vault 7 Series - Hive|last=Supervizer|first=Payman|date=2017-04-14|website=[[Huffington Post]]|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Part 6 ===
On 21 April 2017 WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 6, code-named "Weeping Angel". Which is a [[hacking (computer security)|hacking]] tool co-developed by the [[CIA]] and [[MI5]]. Used to [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]] a series of [[smart TV]]s for the purpose of covert [[Signals intelligence#COMINT|intelligence gathering]]. Once installed in suitable televisions with a USB stick, the hacking tool enables those televisions' built-in microphones and possibly video cameras to record their surroundings, while the televisions falsely appear to be turned off. The recorded data is then either stored locally into the television's memory or sent over the internet to the CIA. Allegedly both the CIA and MI5 agencies collaborated to develop that malware and coordinated their work in Joint Development Workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itwire.com/security/77764-vault-7-guide-to-leak-data-from-samsung-tvs-released.html|title=iTWire - Vault 7: guide to leak data from Samsung TVs released|last=Varghese|first=Sam|date=2017-04-23|website=www.itwire.com|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brandom |first=Russell |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15421326/smart-tv-hacking-cia-samsung-weeping-angel-vulnerability |title=Here's how to use the CIA's 'weeping angel' smart TV hack |date=25 April 2017 |work=The Verge |accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mintpressnews.com/video-iphones-ispies-wikileaks-vault-7-revelations-continue-terrify/227066/|title=VIDEO: iPhones Are iSpies – Wikileaks "Vault 7" Revelations Continue To Terrify|last=Chamseddine|first=Roqayah|date=2017-04-21|work=[[MintPress News]]|access-date=2017-04-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of this part 6 publication, "Weeping Angel" is the second major CIA hacking tool which notably references the British television show, [[Doctor Who|Dr. Who]], alongside "Sonic Screwdriver" in "Dark Matter".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Pachal| first = Pete| title = CIA hack of Samsung TVs was named after a Doctor Who monster| work = Mashable| accessdate = 2017-03-08| url = http://mashable.com/2017/03/07/cia-samsung-tv-hack-weeping-angel/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Molina| first = Brett| title = Alleged CIA hack named after super creepy 'Doctor Who' villain| work = USA TODAY| accessdate = 2017-03-08| url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2017/03/07/alleged-cia-technique-named-after-doctor-who-villain/98853924/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Part 7 ===
On 28 April 2017 WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 7 "Scribbles". The leak includes documentation and source code of a tool intended to track documents leaked to [[whistleblower]]s and journalists by embedding [[web beacon]] tags into classified documents to trace who leaked them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Spring |first=Tom |url=https://threatpost.com/wikileaks-reveals-cia-tool-scribbles-for-document-tracking/125299/ |title=WikiLeaks Reveals CIA Tool 'Scribbles' For Document Tracking |date=28 April 2017 |work=Threatpost |accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/wikileaks-publishes-user-guide-source-code-cias-secret-leaker-tracking-tool-scribbles-1619399|title=WikiLeaks publishes user guide and source code for CIA's secret leaker-tracking tool Scribbles|last=Ashok|first=India|date=2017-05-01|work=[[International Business Times UK]]|access-date=2017-05-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tool affects Microsoft Office documents, specifically "Microsoft Office 2013 (on Windows 8.1 x64), documents from Office versions 97-2016 (Office 95 documents will not work!) [and d]ocuments that are not [locked], encrypted, or password-protected".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/vault7/#Scribbles|title=WikiLeaks - Vault 7: Projects|website=wikileaks.org|access-date=2017-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a CIA watermarked document is opened, an invisible image within the document that is hosted on the agency's server is loaded, generating a [[HTTP request]]. The request is then logged on the server, giving the intelligence agency information about who is opening it and where it is being opened. However, if a watermarked document is opened in an alternative word processor the image may be visible to the viewer. The documentation also states that if the document is viewed offline or in protected view, the watermarked image will not be able to contact its home server. This is only overridden when a user enables editing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/gaming/wikileaks-publishes-cia-anti-whistleblowers-tool-for-microsoft-office-documents/|title=WikiLeaks Publishes CIA Anti-Whistleblowers Tool for Microsoft Office Documents|work=BleepingComputer|access-date=2017-09-24|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Part 8 ===
On 5 May 2017 WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 8 "Archimedes". According to U.S. [[SANS Institute]] instructor Jake Williams, who analyzed the published documents, Archimedes is a virus previously codenamed "Fulcrum". According to cyber security expert and [[European Union Agency for Network and Information Security|ENISA]] member Pierluigi Paganini, the CIA operators use Archimedes to redirect [[local area network]] (LAN) web browser sessions from a targeted computer through a computer controlled by the CIA before the sessions are routed to the users. This type of attack is known as [[Man-in-the-middle attack|man-in-the-middle]] (MitM). With their publication WikiLeaks included a number of hashes that they claim can be used to potentially identify the Archimedes virus and guard against it in the future. Paganini stated that potential targeted computers can search for those hashes on their systems to check if their systems had been attacked by the CIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/58775/hacking/cia-archimedes-tool.html|title=WikiLeaks leaked documents that detail the Archimedes tool used by the CIA in MitM attacks|last=Paganini|first=Pierluigi|date=2017-05-05|work=Security Affairs|access-date=2017-05-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Part 9 ===
On 12 May 2017 WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 9 "AfterMidnight" and "Assassin". AfterMidnight is a [[malware]] installed on a target personal computer and disguises as a [[Dynamic-link library|DLL]] file, which is executed while the user's computer reboots. It then triggers a connection to the CIA's Command and Control (C2) computer, from which it downloads various modules to run. As for Assassin, it is very similar to its AfterMidnight counterpart, but deceptively runs inside a [[Windows service]] process. CIA operators reportedly use Assassin as a C2 to execute a series of tasks, collect, and then periodically send user data to the CIA Listening Post(s) (LP). Similar to [[Trojan horse (computing)|backdoor Trojan]] behavior. Both AfterMidnight and Assassin run on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system, are persistent, and periodically beacon to their configured LP to either request tasks or send private information to the CIA, as well as automatically uninstall themselves on a set date and time.&lt;ref name="Storm"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/3196987/security/wikileaks-posts-user-guides-for-cia-malware-implants-assassin-and-aftermidnight.html|title=WikiLeaks posts user guides for CIA malware implants Assassin and AfterMidnight|last=Storm|first=Darlene|date=2017-05-15|work=[[Computerworld]]|access-date=2017-05-17|archive-url=|archive-date=2017-05-16|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/new-wikileaks-dump-reveals-how-cia-hacks-spies-sabotages-software-1621980|title=New WikiLeaks dump reveals how the CIA hacks, spies and sabotages software|last=Ashok|first=India|date=2017-05-17|work=[[International Business Times|International Business Times UK]]|access-date=2017-05-29|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Part 10 ===
On 19 May 2017 WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 10 "Athena". The published user guide, demo, and related documents were created between September 2015 and February 2016. They are all about a malware allegedly developed for the CIA in August 2015, roughly one month after Microsoft released [[Windows 10]] with their firm statements about how difficult it was to compromise. Both the primary "Athena" malware and its secondary malware named "Hera" are similar in theory to [[Vault 7#Part 4|Grasshopper]] and [[Vault 7#Part 9|AfterMidnight]] malware but with some significant differences. One of those differences is that Athena and Hera were developed by the CIA with a [[New Hampshire]] private corporation called Siege Technologies. During a [[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]] 2014 interview the founder of Siege Technologies confirmed and justified their development of such malware. Athena malware completely hijacks Windows' [[Remote Access Service|Remote Access services]], while Hera hijacks Windows [[Microsoft DNS#DNS lookup client|Dnscache service]]. Also both Athena and Hera affect all current versions of Windows including, but not limited to, [[Windows Server 2012]] and Windows 10. Another difference is in the types of encryption used between the infected computers and the CIA Listening Posts (LP). As for the similarities, they exploit persistent [[Dynamic-link library|DLL]] files to create a [[Trojan horse (computing)|backdoor]] to communicate with CIA's LP, steal private data, then send it to CIA servers, or delete private data on the target computer, as well as Command and Control (C2) for CIA operatives to send additional malicious software to further run specific tasks on the attacked computer. All of the above designed to deceive [[computer security software]]. Beside the published detailed documents, WikiLeaks has not provided any evidence suggesting the CIA used Athena or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/wikileaks-new-dump-reveals-all-windows-versions-can-be-targeted-by-cia-spy-malware-athena-1622508|title=What is WikiLeaks' new dump Athena?

=== Part 11 ===
On 1 June 2017 WikiLeaks published Vault 7 part 11 "Pandemic". This tool serves as a persistent implant affecting Windows machines with shared folders. It functions as a file system filter driver on an infected computer, and listens for [[Server Message Block]] traffic while detecting download attempts from other computers on a local network. "Pandemic" will answer a download request on behalf of the infected computer. However, it will replace the legitimate file with malware. In order to obfuscate its activities, "Pandemic" only modifies or replaces the legitimate file in transit, leaving the original on the server unchanged.  The implant allows 20 files to be modified at a time, with a maximum individual file size of 800MB. While not stated in the leaked documentation, it is possible that newly infected computers could themselves become "Pandemic" file servers, allowing the implant to reach new targets on a local network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cia-malware-can-switch-clean-files-with-malware-when-you-download-them-via-smb/|title=CIA Malware Can Switch Clean Files With Malware When You Download Them via SMB|work=BleepingComputer|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WikiLeaks said that the documents came from "an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI) in [[Langley, Virginia]]."&lt;ref name="Boston.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.boston.com/news/national-news/2017/03/07/wikileaks-publishes-cia-trove-alleging-wide-scale-hacking |title=WikiLeaks publishes CIA trove alleging wide scale hacking |last=Satter |first=Raphael  |date=7 March 2017 |website=Boston.com |access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documents allowed WikiLeaks to partially determine the structure and organization of the CCI.

===Frankfurt base===
The first portion of the documents made public on 7 March 2017, Vault 7 "Year Zero", revealed that a top secret CIA unit used the German city of [[Frankfurt]] as the starting point for hacking attacks on [[Europe]], [[China]] and the [[Middle East]]. According to the documents, the U.S. government uses its [[Consulate General of the United States, Frankfurt|Consulate General Office]] in Frankfurt as a hacker base for [[Cyber Operations|cyber operation]]s. WikiLeaks documents reveal the Frankfurt hackers, part of the Center for Cyber Intelligence Europe (CCIE), were given cover identities and diplomatic passports to obfuscate customs officers to gain entry to Germany.&lt;ref name="Fox" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=John|last1=Goetz|authorlink1=John Goetz|first2=Frederik|last2=Obermaier|authorlink2=Frederik Obermaier|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/wikileaks-frankfurter-us-generalkonsulat-soll-spionagezentrale-sein-1.3409364|title=Frankfurter US-Konsulat soll Spionagezentrale sein|trans-title=Frankfurt's US Consulate appears to be an espionage center|work=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]|language=de|date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief [[Public Prosecutor General (Germany)|Public Prosecutor General of the Federal Court of Justice]] in [[Karlsruhe]] Peter Frank announced on 8 March 2017 that the government was conducting a preliminary investigation to see if it will launch a major probe into the activities being conducted out of the consulate and also more broadly whether people in Germany were being attacked by the CIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Dirk Hautkapp |title=Internet-Methoden der CIA enthüllt |url=https://www.waz.de/politik/internet-methoden-der-cia-enthuellt-id209874865.html |work=[[Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung]] |date=9 March 2017 |access-date=April 17, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=transc/&gt; Germany's foreign minister [[Sigmar Gabriel]] from the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] responded to the documents of Vault 7 "Year Zero" that the CIA used Frankfurt as a base for its digital espionage operations, saying that Germany did not have any information about the cyber attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/german-foreign-minister-gabriel-fears-new-arms-race-with-russia/a-37863822 German Foreign Minister Gabriel fears new arms race with Russia], ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', 9 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== UMBRAGE ==

The documents reportedly revealed that the agency had amassed a large collection of cyberattack techniques and malware produced by other hackers. This library was reportedly maintained by the CIA's Remote Devices Branch's UMBRAGE group, with examples of using these techniques and source code contained in the "Umbrage Component Library" [[git]] repository. According to WikiLeaks, by recycling the techniques of third-parties through UMBRAGE, the CIA can not only increase its total number of attacks,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; but can also mislead forensic investigators by disguising these attacks as the work of other groups and nations.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox" /&gt; Among the techniques borrowed by UMBRAGE was the file wiping implementation used by [[Shamoon]]. According to ''[[PC World]]'', some of the techniques and code snippets have been used by CIA in its internal projects, whose end result cannot be inferred from the leaks. ''[[PC World]]'' noted that the practice of planting "[[false flags]]" to deter attribution was not a new development in cyberattacks: Russian, North Korean and Israeli hacker groups are among those suspected of using false flags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CIA false flag team repurposed Shamoon data wiper, other malware|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/3178365/security/cia-false-flag-team-repurposed-shamoon-data-wiper-other-malware.html|accessdate=12 March 2017|work=PCWorld|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study by [[Kim Zetter]] in ''[[The Intercept]]'', UMBRAGE was probably much more focused on speeding up development by repurposing existing tools, rather than on planting false flags.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Zetter |first=Kim |author-link=Kim Zetter |url=https://theintercept.com/2017/03/08/wikileaks-files-show-the-cia-repurposing-foreign-hacking-code-to-save-time-not-to-frame-russia/ |title=WikiLeaks Files Show the CIA Repurposing Hacking Code To Save Time, Not To Frame Russia |work=The Intercept |accessdate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Graham, CEO of [[Errata Security]] told ''The Intercept'' that the source code referenced in the UMBRAGE documents is "extremely public", and is likely used by a multitude of groups and state actors. Graham added: "What we can conclusively say from the evidence in the documents is that they're creating snippets of code for use in other projects and they're reusing methods in code that they find on the internet. [...] Elsewhere they talk about obscuring attacks so you can't see where it's coming from, but there's no concrete plan to do a [[false flag]] operation. They're not trying to say 'We're going to make this look like Russia'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cimpanu |first=Catalin |url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/vault-7-cia-borrowed-code-from-public-malware/ |title=Vault 7: CIA Borrowed Code from Public Malware |work=Bleeping Computer |accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===False flag theories===

On the day the Vault 7 documents were first released, WikiLeaks described UMBRAGE as "a substantial library of attack techniques 'stolen' from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation," and tweeted, "CIA steals other groups virus and malware facilitating [[false flag]] attacks."&lt;ref name="Business Insider"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tani |first=Maxwell |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/sean-hannity-wikileaks-conspiracy-theory-cia-hacked-2017-3 |title=Conservative media figures are embracing a wild WikiLeaks conspiracy theory that the CIA hacked the DNC, and then framed Russia |date=9 March 2017 |work=Business Insider |accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[conspiracy theory]] soon emerged alleging that the CIA framed the [[Russian government]] for [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|interfering in the 2016 U.S. elections]]. Conservative commentators such as [[Sean Hannity]] and [[Ann Coulter]] speculated about this possibility on Twitter, and [[Rush Limbaugh]] discussed it on his radio show.&lt;ref name="WaPo conspiracy"&gt;{{cite web |last=Blake |first=Aaron |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/03/10/the-dangerous-and-irresistible-gop-conspiracy-theory-that-explains-away-trumps-russia-problem/ |title=Analysis - The dangerous and irresistible GOP conspiracy theory that explains away Trump's Russia problem |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian foreign minister [[Sergey Lavrov]] said that Vault 7 showed that "the CIA could get access to such 'fingerprints' and then use them."&lt;ref name="Business Insider"/&gt;

Cybersecurity writers, such as Ben Buchanan and [[Kevin Poulsen]], were skeptical of those theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buchanan|first1=Ben|title=WikiLeaks doesn't raise doubts about who hacked the DNC.

== Marble framework ==
The documents describe the Marble framework, a string obfuscator used to hide text fragments in malware from visual inspection. As part of the program, foreign languages were used to cover up the source of CIA hacks.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Cheminat: [http://www.silicon.fr/marble-framework-le-double-jeu-perfide-sur-le-hacking-de-la-cia-171177.html Marble Framework: le double jeu perfide des hackers de la CIA], ''silicon.fr'', 31 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefania Maurizi: [http://www.repubblica.it/esteri/2017/03/31/news/wikileaks_usa_cia_spionaggio_depistaggio-161859197/ WikiLeaks, così la Cia depista i raid nei computer: svelato il 'Marble Framework'], ''[[La Repubblica]]'', 31 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Marc Manach: [http://www.liberation.fr/futurs/2017/03/31/wikileaks-joue-a-cache-cache-avec-la-cia_1559706 WikiLeaks joue à cache-cache avec la CIA], [[Libération]], 31 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; According to WikiLeaks, it reached 1.0 in 2015 and was used by the CIA throughout 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cimpanu |first=Catalin |url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/government/wikileaks-dumps-source-code-of-cia-tool-called-marble/ |title=WikiLeaks Dumps Source Code of CIA Tool Called Marble |work=Bleeping Computer |date=1 April 2017 |accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its release, WikiLeaks described the primary purpose of "Marble" as to insert foreign language text into the malware to mask viruses, trojans and hacking attacks, making it more difficult for them to be tracked to the CIA and to cause forensic investigators to falsely attribute code to the wrong nation.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Varghese: [http://www.itwire.com/security/77508-wikileaks-releases-third-tranche-of-cia-files.html WikiLeaks releases third tranche of CIA files], ''iTWire', 1 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The source code revealed that Marble had examples in Chinese, Russian, Korean, Arabic and [[Persian language|Persian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://heavy.com/tech/2017/03/wikileaks-vault-7-part-3-marble-cia-tool-to-mask-hacks-hacking-russian-chinese-arabic-decoy-languages-attribute/|title=WikiLeaks Vault 7 Part 3 Reveals CIA Tool Might Mask Hacks as Russian, Chinese, Arabic|last=Dwilson|first=Stephanie Dube|date=2017-03-31|work=[[Heavy.com]]|access-date=2017-03-31|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were the languages of the US's main cyber-adversaries – China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran.&lt;ref name=Register31Mar&gt;John Leyden: [https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/03/31/wikileaks_cia/ WikiLeaks exposes CIA anti-forensics tool that makes Uncle Sam seem fluent in enemy tongues], The Register, 31 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysts called WikiLeaks' description of Marble's main purpose inaccurate, telling ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' its main purpose was probably to avoid detection by antivirus programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/326691-wikileaks-newest-cia-source-code-leak-shows-how-cia-avoids-anti-virus|title=WikiLeaks' latest leak shows how CIA avoids antivirus programs|last=Uchill|first=Joe|date=31 March 2017|website=|publisher=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marble also contained a deobfuscator tool with which the CIA could reverse text obfuscation.&lt;ref name=Register31Mar /&gt;

Security researcher Nicholas Weaver from [[International Computer Science Institute]] in Berkeley told the Washington Post: "''This appears to be one of the most technically damaging leaks ever done by WikiLeaks, as it seems designed to directly disrupt ongoing CIA operations.''"&lt;ref&gt;The Washington Post: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/wikileaks-latest-release-of-cia-cyber-tools-could-blow-the-cover-on-agency-hacking-operations/2017/03/31/63fc3616-1636-11e7-833c-503e1f6394c9_story.html WikiLeaks’ latest release of CIA cyber-tools could blow the cover on agency hacking operations], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 31 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/04/wikileaks-releases-code-that-could-unmask-cia-hacking-operations/ Wikileaks releases code that could unmask CIA hacking operations], ''[[Ars Technica]]'', 2 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compromised technology and software ==

=== CDs/DVDs ===
HammerDrill is a CD/DVD collection tool that collects directory walks and files to a configured directory and filename pattern as well as logging CD/DVD insertion and removal events.  v2.0 adds a gap jumping capability that Trojans 32-bit executables as they are being burned to disc by Nero.  Additionally, v2.0 adds a status, termination and an on-demand collection feature controlled by HammerDrillStatus.dll, HammerDrillKiller.dll and HammerDrillCollector.dll.  The logging now also fingerprints discs by hashing the first two blocks of the ISO image, which enables unique identification of multi-sessions discs even as data is added and removed.  The log also logs anytime a HammerDrill trojaned binary is seen on a disc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_17072172.html|title=HammerDrill v2.0|website=wikileaks.org|language=en|access-date=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.recode.net/2017/3/7/14846926/cia-code-names-surveillance-wikileaks|title=Weeping Angel, Brutal Kangaroo and other secret CIA code names from the Wikileaks surveillance leak|website=www.recode.net|language=en|access-date=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Apple products ===
After WikiLeaks released the first installment of Vault 7, "Year Zero", Apple stated that "many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS," and that the company "will continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McCormick |first=Rich |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/8/14851266/apple-patch-wikileaks-cia-dump-ios |title=Apple says it's already patched 'many' iOS vulnerabilities identified in WikiLeaks' CIA dump|date=8 March 2017 |work=The Verge |accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 March 2017, WikiLeaks released "Dark Matter", the second batch of documents in its Vault 7 series, detailing the hacking techniques and tools all focusing Apple products developed by the Embedded Development Branch (EDB) of the CIA. The leak also revealed the CIA had been targeting the iPhone since 2008, a year after the device was released. These EDB projects attacked Apple's firmware meaning that the attack code would persist even if the system gets rebooted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wikileaks.org/vault7/darkmatter/releases Releases Dark Matter], ''WikiLeaks'', 23 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/wikileaks-cia-dark-matter-hacking-leak-apple-iphone-ipad-new-vault-7-files-latest-a7646751.html WikiLeaks CIA files: New 'Dark Matter' release details how US 'hacked into Apple products'], ''The Independent'', 23 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The "Dark Matter" archive included documents from 2009 and 2013. Apple issued a second statement assuring, that based on an "initial analysis, the alleged iPhone vulnerability affected iPhone 3G only and was fixed in 2009 when iPhone 3GS was released." Additionally, a preliminary assessment showed "the alleged Mac vulnerabilities were previously fixed in all Macs launched after 2013".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Uchill |first=Joe |url=http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/325579-apple-new-wikileaked-vulnerabilities-no-longer-work |title=Apple: Security vulnerabilities revealed by WikiLeaks no longer work |date=23 March 2017 |work=The Hill |accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thunderbolt"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gallagher |first=Sean |url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/03/new-wikileaks-dump-the-cia-built-thunderbolt-exploit-implants-to-target-macs/ |title=New WikiLeaks dump: The CIA built Thunderbolt exploit, implants to target Macs |work=Ars Technica |date=23 March 2017 |accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 March 2017 WikiLeaks described Apple as "duplicitous" for saying it had fixed security flaws: "Apple's claim that it has "fixed" all "vulnerabilities" described in DARKMATTER is duplicitous. EFI is a systemic problem, not a zero-day". Echoing the lack of trust in Apple was the German-Finnish Internet entrepreneur [[Kim Dotcom]], who wrote: "Apple statement is not credible."&lt;ref&gt;William Suberg: [https://cointelegraph.com/news/vault-7-volume-ii-apple-patch-claims-duplicitous-says-wikileaks Vault 7 Volume II: Apple Patch Claims “Duplicitous,” Says WikiLeaks], ''The Cointelegraph,'' 24 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cisco ===
WikiLeaks said on 19 March 2017 on Twitter that the "CIA was secretly exploiting" a vulnerability in a huge range of [[Cisco]] router models discovered thanks to the Vault 7 documents.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/843573087950069764&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="securityweek1"&gt;http://www.securityweek.com/cisco-finds-zero-day-vulnerability-vault-7-leak&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA had learned more than a year ago how to exploit flaws in Cisco's widely used [[Network switch|internet switch]]es, which direct electronic traffic, to enable eavesdropping. Cisco quickly reassigned staff from other projects to turn their focus solely on analyzing the attack and to figure out how the CIA hacking worked, so they could help customers patch their systems and prevent criminal hackers or spies from using similar methods.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Menn: [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-defense-idUSKBN17013U A scramble at Cisco exposes uncomfortable truths about U.S. cyber defense], Reuters, 29. March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 March, Cisco researchers confirmed that their study of the Vault 7 documents showed the CIA had developed malware which could exploit a flaw found in 318 of Cisco's switch models and alter or take control of the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Goodin |first=Dan |url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2017/03/a-simple-command-allows-the-cia-to-commandeer-318-models-of-cisco-switches/ |title=A simple command allows the CIA to commandeer 318 models of Cisco switches |date=20 March 2017 |work=Ars Technica |accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cisco issued a warning on security risks, patches were not available, but Cisco provided mitigation advice.&lt;ref name="securityweek1" /&gt;

=== Smartphones/tablets ===

The electronic tools can reportedly compromise both [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iOS]] and [[Google]]'s [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating systems. By adding malware to the Android operating system, the tools could gain access to secure communications made on a device.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite web |last=Barrett |first=Brian |url=https://www.wired.com/2017/03/wikileaks-cia-hack-signal-encrypted-chat-apps/ |title=The CIA Can't Crack Signal and WhatsApp Encryption, No Matter What You've Heard |publisher=Wired |date=7 March 2017 |accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Messaging services ====
According to WikiLeaks, once an Android smartphone is penetrated the agency can collect "audio and message traffic before encryption is applied".&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Some of the agency's software is reportedly able to gain access to messages sent by instant messaging services.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; This method of accessing messages differs from obtaining access by decrypting an already encrypted message.&lt;ref name="Wired" /&gt; While the encryption of [[Secure instant messaging|messengers]] that offer [[end-to-end encryption]], such as [[Telegram (messaging service)|Telegram]], [[WhatsApp]] and [[Signal (software)|Signal]], wasn't reported to be cracked, their encryption can be bypassed by capturing input before their encryption is applied, by methods such as keylogging and recording the touch input from the user.&lt;ref name="Wired" /&gt; Commentators, among them Snowden and [[cryptographer]] and security pundit [[Bruce Schneier]], observed that Wikileaks incorrectly implied that the messaging apps themselves, and their underlying encryption, had been compromised - an implication which was in turn reported for a period by the New York Times and other [[mainstream media|mainstream outlets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Glaser|first1=April|title=WikiLeaks Reveals The CIA Hacked Into Apple IPhones.|url=http://www.recode.net/2017/3/7/14843494/wikileaks-cia-hacked-apple-iphone-google-androidsamsung|website=ReCode|accessdate=17 March 2017|date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

On 8 April 2017, Ashley Gorski, an [[American Civil Liberties Union]] staff attorney calls it "critical to understand" that "these vulnerabilities can be exploited not just by our government but by foreign governments and [[cyber criminal]]s around the world." [[Justin Cappos]], professor in the Computer Science and Engineering department at New York University asks "if the government knows of a problem in your phone that bad guys could use to hack your phone and have the ability to spy on you, is that a weakness that they themselves should use for counterterrorism, or for their own spying capabilities, or is it a problem they should fix for everyone?".&lt;ref name=news1&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy experts say the CIA left Americans open to cyber attacks|url=http://www.newsweek.com/privacy-experts-cia-americans-open-cyber-attacks-580659|publisher=Newsweek|accessdate=9 April 2017|language=en|date=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 April 2017, [[Cindy Cohn]], executive director of the international non-profit digital rights group based in San Francisco [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], said: "If the C.I.A. was walking past your front door and saw that your lock was broken, they should at least tell you and maybe even help you get it fixed."

On 12 May 2017 Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer, Brad Smith, wrote "This is an emerging pattern in 2017. We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on WikiLeaks," In other words, Smith expressed concern about the fact that the CIA have stockpiled such computer vulnerabilities, which in turn were stolen from them, while they failed to inform Microsoft in a timely fashion about their security breach, as a result the privacy and security of their customers around the world were potentially negatively affected for an extended period and caused widespread damage.&lt;ref name="Storm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2017/05/14/need-urgent-collective-action-keep-people-safe-online-lessons-last-weeks-cyberattack/|title=The need for urgent collective action to keep people safe online: Lessons from last week's cyberattack - Microsoft on the Issues|last=Smith|first=Brad|date=2017-05-14|work=[[Microsoft]]|access-date=2017-05-17|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12466">'''Vector tiles''', '''tiled vectors''' or '''vectiles'''&lt;ref name="teczno"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mike.teczno.com/notes/postgreslessness-mapnik-vectiles.html|title=the liberty of postgreslessness: tiled vectors in mapnik (tecznotes)|publisher=mike.teczno.com|accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; are packets of geographic data, packaged into pre-defined roughly-square shaped "tiles" for transfer over the web. This is an emerging method for delivering styled [[Web mapping|web maps]], combining certain benefits of pre-rendered raster map tiles with [[vector map]] data. As with the widely used raster [[tiled web map]]s, map data is requested by a client as a set of "tiles" corresponding to square areas of land of a pre-defined size and location. Unlike raster tiled web maps, however, the server returns vector map data, which has been clipped to the boundaries of each tile, instead of a pre-rendered map image.

There are several major advantages of this hybrid approach. Compared to an un-tiled vector map, the data transfer is reduced,&lt;ref name="msr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/mapcruncher/TiledVectors/TiledVectorsDemo-1.1/description.html|title=About Tiled Vectors|publisher=research.microsoft.com|accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; because only data within the current viewport, and at the current zoom level needs to be transferred. The [[geographic information system|GIS]] clipping operations can all be performed in advance, as the tile boundaries are pre-defined. This in turn means that tiled vector data can be packaged up and distributed, without needing any kind of GIS system available to serve data.

Compared to a tiled raster map, data transfer is also greatly reduced, as vector data is typically much smaller than a rendered bitmap. Also, styling can be applied later in the process, or even in the browser itself, allowing much greater flexibility in how data is presented. It is also easy to provide interactivity with map features, as their vector representation already exists within the client.&lt;ref name="msr"/&gt; Yet another benefit is that less centralised server processing power is required, since rasterisation can be performed directly in the client. This has been described as making "rendering ... a last-mile problem, with fast, high-quality GPU[s] in everyone’s pocket".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://mike.teczno.com/img/Geomeetup-slides-2013-04.pdf|title = Geomeetup Slides 2013-04|date = 2013-04-01|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Migurski|first = Michal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
There is a long history of the use of vector tile schemes in GIS. A very early GIS (circa 1966), the Canada Geographic Information System (CGIS), used a vector tile storage scheme that allowed limited resource computers to efficiently access and process vector map data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crcpress.com/Introductory-Readings-In-Geographic-Information-Systems/Peuquet-Marble/9780203393246|title=Introductory Readings In Geographic Information Systems|website=CRC Press|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; CGIS used the term "frame" instead of vector tiles.

In 1975, the US Wildlife Service initiated a national program to map and digitize all the wetlands in the US. In 1976 they awarded a contract to Autometric to develop a software application that allowed stereo imagery to be digitized using an analytical stereo plotter. Later support for 2d digitization from single photos (aka single photo resection) on a digitizing table was added. The software was called WAMS (Wetlands Analytical Mapping System). The WAMS data store used a tiled vector structure. Each tile was called a “geounit”. A geounit corresponded to one of the USGS quadrangle scales, typically 1:24000. As the data were digitized, they were immediately stored in the tiled data store and topologically structured. Lines crossing geounit boundaries were automatically split. The  storage Coordinate Reference System (CRS) was WGS 72 lat/long. WAMS is described in detail in “The wetlands analytical mapping system: WAMS" [Pywell and Niedzwiadek, 1980]

Building on the operational experience gained in implementing and using WAMS as well as from the Map Overlay and Statistical System (MOSS),&lt;ref&gt;Moss: A Historical Perspective https://www.scribd.com/document/4606038/2004-Article-by-Carl-Reed-MOSS-A-Historical-perspective&lt;/ref&gt; in 1986 Autometric released a UNIX based commercial GIS that implemented an enhanced vector tile storage and access structure: DeltaMap (later GenaMap). The vector tile structure and capability is described in "DeltaMap: Not just another GIS".&lt;ref&gt;Reed C N (1986) DELTAMAP: Not just another new GIS- Proceedings of the 3rd International Symposium on Spatial Data Handling. IGU Commission on Geographical Data Sensing and Processing, Williamsville NY, pp. 375-83&lt;/ref&gt; Where WAMS implemented a fixed tile system based on latitude/longitude 1:24000 quadrangles, DeltaMap allowed the user to define any size tile in any coordinate reference system (CRS). In this way, sparse data required only a few tiles whereas dense data could use much smaller tiles. R-trees were used as the indexing scheme for the vector tiles. In the late 1980's, Genasys further enhanced GenaMap to allow "Continuous, seamless" processing of the tiled layers. Basically, from the end user perspective, the tiles became invisible. This capability was true regardless of whether the user were editing, visualizing, querying, or analyzing the data.

== Standards and approaches ==
As of early 2015, there is no dominant standard for vector tiles. Approaches can differ in their URL format, data serialisation format, packaging of styling information, and support for projections other than Web Mercator.

=== Protocol buffers (Mapbox) ===
[[Mapbox]] has defined an open standard for vector map tiles called "vector-tile-spec" which uses [[Google Protocol Buffers|Google protocol buffers]] for space-efficient data serialisation. [[Web Mercator]] is the projection of reference, but vector tiles may be used to represent data with any projection and tile extent scheme.&lt;ref name="github2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec/tree/master/2.1|title=vector-tile-spec/2.1 at master · mapbox/vector-tile-spec · GitHub|publisher=github.com|accessdate=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also tied to the [[Mapnik]] rendering engine, using a "serialized version of the internal data that Mapnik uses".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.mapbox.com/developers/vector-tiles/|title = Vector Tiles Overview|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Mapbox|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, [[Esri]], the dominant geospatial software maker, announced that they would be supporting Mapbox's vector tiles standard in both server and client platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.mapbox.com/blog/vector-tile-adoption/|title = Mapbox Vector Tile Specification adopted by Esri|date = 2015-03-17|accessdate = |website = Mapbox blog|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mapnik Vector Tile ===
This was an early format developed for the Mapnik renderer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Python: module TileStache.Goodies.VecTiles.mvt|url = http://tilestache.org/doc/TileStache.Goodies.VecTiles.mvt.html|website = tilestache.org|accessdate = 2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other formats ===
The approach followed by TileStache is to allow multiple data serialisation formats; as of early 2015, it supports GeoJSON, ArcJSON, GeoBSON, Arc GeoServices BSON, GeoAMF and Arc GeoServices BSON. The requested format is given in the URL (e.g., &lt;code&gt;http://example.com/tiles/mylayer/2/1/3.json&lt;/code&gt;)

==Support==

=== Services and applications ===
Vector tiles have been used by the Google Maps Android client since December 2010&lt;ref name="blogspot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googlemobile.blogspot.com.au/2010/12/under-hood-of-google-maps-50-for.html|title=Under the hood of Google Maps 5.0 for Android - Official Google Mobile Blog|publisher=googlemobile.blogspot.com.au|accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on the desktop client since 2013.&lt;ref name="engadget"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/05/15/redesigned-google-maps-hands-on-io-2013/|title=Redesigned Google Maps hands-on: vector-based, more personal and coming soon to mobile|publisher=engadget.com|accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Vector tiles for rendering OpenStreetMap data were first proposed in March 2013&lt;ref name="teczno"/&gt; and are supported by Mapnik,&lt;ref name="github"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/mapbox/mapnik-vector-tile|title=mapbox/mapnik-vector-tile · GitHub|publisher=github.com|accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most widely used renderer of OpenStreetMap data. [[Mapbox]], a commercial provider of custom cartography tools and hosting, has focused its cartography tool, Mapbox Studio, around vector tiles.&lt;ref name="mapbox"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mapbox.com/blog/vector-tiles/|title=Vector Tiles for MapBox Streets &amp;#124; Mapbox|publisher=mapbox.com|accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popular, and very powerful, Android client for OpenStreetMap data, [[osmAnd]] supports vector tiles, which it calls "vector maps".&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://code.google.com/p/osmand/wiki/HowToVectorTileData|title=HowToVectorTileData -   osmand -    This article describes how to use key features -   Global Mobile Map Viewing &amp;amp; Navigation for Offline and Online OSM Maps - Google Project Hosting|publisher=code.google.com|accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Servers ===
The tile server pipeline [[TileStache]] supports several flavours of JSON natively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://tilestache.org/doc/TileStache.Vector.html|title = TileStache.Vector|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a plugin vector tile provider called VecTiles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://tilestache.org/doc/TileStache.Goodies.VecTiles.server.html#Provider%20-%20MVT%20or%20GeoJSON|title = TileStache.Goodies.VecTiles.server|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which converts PostGIS data into vector tiles in Mapnik Vector Tile format (incompatible with the Mapbox specification&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Protobuf.skip unimplemented types · Issue #15 · SpatialServer/Leaflet.MapboxVectorTile|url = https://github.com/SpatialServer/Leaflet.MapboxVectorTile/issues/15|website = GitHub|accessdate = 2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or [[TopoJSON]].

PGRestAPI (also known as Chubbs Spatial Server) is a standalone NodeJS server which can also generate vector tiles on the fly from a PostGIS data source, as well as serving pre-generated vector tiles from sources such as Mapbox Studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://github.com/spatialdev/PGRestAPI|title = PGRestAPI (aka Chubbs Spatial Server)|date = 2015-02-25|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ESRI ArcGIS Server 10.4&lt;ref&gt;https://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2016/02/18/arcgis-10-4-is-here/&lt;/ref&gt; and ArcGIS Pro 1.2&lt;ref&gt;https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/get-started/whats-new-in-arcgis-pro-1-2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; released in February 2016 added support for vector tiles.

=== Client libraries ===
The Leaflet JavaScript library does not directly support vector tiles, but there are third-party plugin for vector tiles,  Leaflet.MapboxVectorTile for Leaflet 0.7.x&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://github.com/SpatialServer/Leaflet.MapboxVectorTile|title = Leaflet.MapboxVectorTile|date = 2015-02-12|accessdate = |website = GitHub|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Leaflet.VectorGrid for Leaflet 1.0.x.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.VectorGrid|title = Leaflet.VectorGrid|date = 2017-02-16|accessdate = |website = GitHub|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mapbox's own JavaScript library, Mapbox.js, can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js|title = API Documentation|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Mapbox|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

OpenLayers supports vector tiles through the ol.source.VectorTile object,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/ol.source.VectorTile.html|title = Open Layers 3 documentation|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; as of version 3.

'''''View on the Amstel from Amsteldijk''''' (c. 1680) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] landscape painter [[Jacob van Ruisdael]].
It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is now in the collection of the [[Amsterdam Museum]].

This painting was purchased in 2007 with support from the [[Vereniging Rembrandt]] as an important artifact of [[Amsterdam]] history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verenigingrembrandt.nl/152/de-kunst/gesteunde-kunst/gezicht-op-amsterdam-vanaf-de-amsteldijk Information] on Vereniging Rembrandt website&lt;/ref&gt; It was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1911, who wrote; "17. View of Amsterdam. The [[Amstel]] fills the right-hand side of the picture. In the centre is a canal bordered by a meadow. A ray of light illumines the town. In the sky are masses of storm-cloud. Canvas. Sale. [[Charles de Morny, Duke of Morny|Comte de Morny]], Paris, May 24, 1852, No. 24 (3100 francs)."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn04hofsuoft#page/13/mode/1up  Entry 17 for ''''View of Amsterdam''] in Hofstede de Groot, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Vereniging Rembrandt, the steeples in this painting are from left to right: [[Leidsepoort]], [[Utrechtsepoort]], [[Westerkerk]], [[Stadhuis (Dam)]], [[Oude Kerk, Amsterdam|Oude Kerk]], [[Zuiderkerk]], [[Portugees-Joodse Synagoge]], [[Nederlands Scheepvaartmuseum|'s Lands zeemagazijn]], [[Weesperpoort]], [[Oosterkerk]]. All of these buildings had been recently designed and built under the supervision of the city architect [[Daniël Stalpaert]].

This scene is very similar to other paintings Ruisdael made in this period of Amsterdam and these often served as inspiration for later painters of landscape.

[[Keith Floyd]] (1943–2009) was an English broadcaster, restaurateur and food writer. He was brought up in [[Somerset]], England, where his mother taught him to cook.{{sfn|Levy|2013}} He was educated at [[Wellington School, Somerset|Wellington]], a local [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]], although he left at the age of sixteen.&lt;ref name="Guard: Obit" /&gt; He joined the ''[[Bristol Evening Post]]'' as a cub reporter—where he worked alongside the future playwright [[Tom Stoppard]].&lt;ref name="D Tel: Obit" /&gt; He was commissioned into the [[Royal Tank Regiment]] in 1963 as a [[second lieutenant]], but his career there only lasted until 1966; he left military service and moved to London and then France, where he worked in several restaurants in various roles.{{sfn|Levy|2013}}&lt;ref name="Indie: Obit" /&gt;

In 1971 he set up his first restaurant in [[Bristol]]—Floyd's Bistro—which proved popular enough for him to open three further outlets in the city. His burgeoning empire soon collapsed and he sailed around the [[Mediterranean]] for two years, from where he exported wine to the UK. He also opened a restaurant in the south of France, but this was also unsuccessful and it closed in 1979, when Floyd returned to the UK.{{sfn|Levy|2013}}&lt;ref name="D Tel: Obit" /&gt; He opened another Bristol-based restaurant and wrote a book—''Floyd's Food''—which was locally published in 1981; this led to a short recipe slot on the local [[Heart Bristol|Radio West]] station.&lt;ref name="Guard: Obit" /&gt; In 1983 one of his customers—David Pritchard, a television producer—suggested to Floyd that he front a television series, which resulted in ''Floyd on Fish'', broadcast on [[BBC Two]] in late 1985.{{sfn|Levy|2013}} Several series followed on the BBC before the Floyd-Pritchard partnership broke up in 1993; a corresponding book appeared with each series.{{sfn|Levy|2013}} There were no scripts for the programmes, and Floyd [[Ad libitum|ad-libbed]] throughout; when he ran out of words, he would sip from an ever-present glass of wine to give him time to create the next line.&lt;ref name="Indie: Obit" /&gt; Pritchard's directing style and Floyd's presentation technique produced what the food writer [[Tom Jaine]] considers as "cheerful mayhem", although viewers were educated in basic techniques. He went on to say that "Floyd's performances, on or near the stove, were a refreshing departure from the prissy, controlled style then in favour at the BBC, or the alternative mode of half an hour with a French chef whose incomprehensible English made the recipes a mystery."&lt;ref name="Guard: Obit" /&gt;

Paul Levy, Floyd's obituarist, considered the broadcaster had "no outstanding talent, either as a cook or as a TV presenter, no great knowledge of his subject, or any apparent passion for anything but drink. This is not to say that his first TV programmes were bad – they were, indeed, highly diverting entertainment".&lt;ref name="Indie: Obit" /&gt; The programmes were also highly popular both with the public and other cooks. Following his death of heart disease in September 2009 several fellow chefs voiced their opinions of him. [[Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall]] considers that Floyd "cooked his ingredients with the love and passion of a gifted amateur", while [[Heston Blumenthal]] opines that "His enthusiasm, even when he was being a bit crotchety, jumped out of the screen. No-one made TV food programmes quite like him. He had a wealth of knowledge but there was a no-nonsense approach to it all".&lt;ref name="Guard: Tribs" /&gt;
