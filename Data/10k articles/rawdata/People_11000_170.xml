[[File:Tu eres la amada de mis suenhos.jpg|thumb|''Tu eres la amada de mis sueños'', {{Interlanguage link multi|Rafael Miguel Sánchez|es}} for Agustín Magaldi]]
'''Agustín Magaldi''' (December 1, 1898 – September 8, 1938) was a [[tango music|tango]] and [[Milonga (music)|milonga]] [[singer]]. His nickname was "''the sentimental voice of Buenos Aires''."
Magaldi took part in the opening broadcasts of Argentina's LOY Radio Nacional in July 1924.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mEZaYZevYR8C&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=%22Agust%C3%ADn+Magaldi%22&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=39#v=onepage&amp;q=Magaldi&amp;f=false The film industry in Argentina: an illustrated cultural history] Jorge Finkielman p. 112, [[McFarland &amp; Company]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Magaldi suffered from liver disease and was admitted to Sanatorium Otamendi early in September 1938.  An operation by Dr. Pedro Valdez was successful, but the patient died 48 hours later.  He was buried in the Chacarita Cemetery in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YoEO5K19KPMC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=%22Agust%C3%ADn+Magaldi%22+tango&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=13#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Agust%C3%ADn%20Magaldi%22%20tango&amp;f=false Frommer's Buenos Aires] Michael Luongo p. 152 [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrayal in ''Evita''==
Magaldi is portrayed in the [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and [[Tim Rice]] [[Broadway musical]] ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]''. In the musical, Magaldi is depicted as bringing Eva to [[Buenos Aires]] and so is therefore referred to as "the first man to be of use to [[Eva Perón|Eva Duarte]]".

There is some disagreement, however, about the role Magaldi played in Eva's real life. For example, in the biography ''Evita: The Real Life of Eva Perón'' biographers Marysa Navarro and Nicholas Fraser write that there are no records of Magaldi performing in Eva's hometown of [[Junín, Buenos Aires Province|Junín]] in the year that Eva is said to have met Magaldi:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Most accounts of Evita's life say that she fell in love with the spotlight image of Magaldi or that she decided to seduce him and use him; but that, in either event, she was introduced to him, asked him to take her to Buenos Aires, and when he wavered, forced her way into his train compartment and rode with him to the city, thus leaving her family and becoming a married man's [[mistress (lover)|mistress]]. Yet there is no record of the tango singer's having come to Junín that year. Magaldi, a mild man who was devoted to his mother, used to bring his wife on tour, and it is hard to understand what he would have seen in small, skinny Eva María. If he did help her leave Junín, it is likely that his assistance was of the most innocuous kind. Evita's sister insists that doña Juana, prodded by don Pepe, accompanied Evita to the city. According to her account, mother and daughter kept visiting the [[radio stations]] until they found a programme for which a young girl was needed."&lt;ref&gt;Navarro, Marysa. Fraser, Nicholas. ''Evita: The Real Life of Eva Perón''. Page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A major point that detracts from the credibility of the version of the story presented in ''Evita'' is that in the stage (and film) versions, Magaldi is depicted as performing at a charity concert given in aid of the victims of an earthquake in [[1944 San Juan earthquake|San Juan, Argentina]]. The earthquake occurred on 15 January 1944, and the concert occurred on 22 January, when Eva almost certainly met Peron.  However, Magaldi could not have performed there since he had died of [[peritonitis]] in Buenos Aires more than five years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myetymology.com/encyclopedia/Agust%C3%ADn_Magaldi.html |title=Agustín Magaldi |publisher=Myetymology.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 Graham-Douglas became chairman of the Southern Minorities Movement, one of the groups that eventually merged into the [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party]] (PDP). He was a candidate in the PDP primaries for the presidential nomination in 1998, losing to [[Olusegun Obasanjo]], who went on to become president.&lt;ref name=comp698/&gt;

An elder statesman in [[Rivers State politics]], in 1999 Graham Douglas and [[Marshal Harry]], Chairman of the [[Rivers State People's Democratic Party]], settled for Dr [[Peter Odili]] as a consensus candidate for governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He said of Odili that "he has no respect for good governance and we have a right to call him to order".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In January 2007, following the PDP primaries in Rivers State in which Riverine candidates performed poorly compared to Uplanders, the Ijaw Consultative Assembly which Graham-Douglas had founded launched an attack on Ijaws who had served in Odili's government, apparently in a move to reverse the selection of [[Rotimi Amaechi]] as PDP candidate for governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

However, in February 2010 Graham-Douglas disagreed with Amaechi about marginalization of the [[Kalabari]] people, claiming problems were due to  longstanding government neglect combined with efforts to cut oil-producing areas out of the Kalabari region. Amaechi took the position that Kalabari leaders themselves were to blame, and should do more to develop their communities and discourage militancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Talking of the [[Niger delta crisis]] in an interview in October 2009, Graham-Douglas blamed the problems in part on the elections of 2003 when the boys were given arms and used to disrupt the polls. He said the recent amnesty was progress, but not enough. More should be done to provide local housing and employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{History of Morocco}}

The "'''Azwafit'''" or "'''Azwafayt'''" ({{lang-ar|أزوفيت}}) is a tribe of bedouin (nomad) [[Arab]] origin.

== Etymologie ==
The word "Azwafit" ({{lang-ar|أزوفيت}}) is derived from the Arabic word "zfata", means "To protect from the Zfata". The Zfata is a group of people which claim false payments for the transportation of goods.

== About ==
The Azwafit are part of the greater [[Tekna]] confederation. Azwafit is a tribe which was accustomed to escort and protect caravans against the payment of "Ztata" or "Zfata", whence the name of Azwafit. Because they became part of a bigger Berberian tribe, the Arab subtribes are partially Berberised and speak Berber today.

The writer La Chapelle noted that Azwafits counted the following fractions: Ait Ahmed Ou Ali, Ahl Hayin, Mhamd Ait Ait El Khennous, Ait Messaoud Ait Boukko and Ida Ou Louggan.&lt;ref&gt;Tribes of Morocco. Azwafit tribe of Morocco.http://tribusdumaroc.free.fr/azwafit.php&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burke's Peerage Limited''' is a British [[genealogy|genealogical]] [[publisher]] founded in 1826, when Irish genealogist [[John Burke (genealogist)|John Burke]] began releasing books devoted to the ancestry and [[heraldry]] of the [[peerage]], [[baronetage]], [[knight]]age and [[landed gentry]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. His first publication, a ''Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the United Kingdom'', was updated sporadically until 1847, when the company began releasing new editions every year as ''Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage'' (often shortened to just ''Burke's Peerage''). Other books followed, including ''[[Burke's Landed Gentry]]'', ''Burke's Colonial Gentry'', and ''Burke's General Armory''. In addition to the peerage, Burke's published books on royal families of [[Europe]] and [[Latin America]], ruling families of [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], distinguished families of the [[United States]] and historical families of [[Ireland]].

==History==
The firm was established in 1826 by John Burke (1786–1848), progenitor of a dynasty of [[genealogist]]s and [[herald]]s. His son Sir [[Bernard Burke|John Bernard Burke]] (1814–92) was [[Ulster King of Arms]] (1853–92) and his grandson, Sir [[Henry Farnham Burke]] (1859–1930), was [[Garter Principal King of Arms]] (1919–30). After his death, ownership passed through a variety of people. [[Image:Burke's Peerage, Sixth Edition (1839), Title Page.jpg|thumb|195px|''A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the British Empire, Sixth Edition 1839'' (known better simply as ''Burke's Peerage'')|left]] Apart from the Burke family, editors have included [[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies]], [[Alfred Trego Butler]], [[Leslie Gilbert Pine]], and [[Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd]].

==Criticism==
From the start, Burke's works suffered from pomposity and carelessness. Readers may have accepted as a minor eccentricity of style the idolisation of medieval figures who were little more than brigands and the ludicrously reverential tone adopted towards otherwise insignificant people who happened to possess a title or were related to a titled person. The major fault of substance, however, was the frequent and evident inaccuracy of the articles. Without much knowledge of history or genealogy, one could see improbabilities and inconsistencies both within articles and between articles. Errors in existing articles remained uncorrected between editions and new errors were added in new articles. A very minor example can be found as late as 1953, where the article on the [[Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell]] barony contained a statement about the relationship of the first baron (died 1941) to the family of the first [[Earl Nelson]] (died 1835) which was not supported by the article on the Nelson earldom, because there was no relationship and the statement was untrue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title = Burke's Peerage|year = 1953|edition = 100|location = London|publisher = Burke's Peerage Ltd|editor = L. G. Pine|pages = 1544 and 1704}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$c148190;view=1up;seq=1973]&lt;/ref&gt; When such carelessness was shown over relatively recent links, what hope had readers of finding accurate guidance over titles with complicated ascents going back to remote medieval times?
[[File:Burke's Peerage, Sixth Edition, 1839, Frontispiece.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Sir John Bernard Burke, &lt;br&gt;''Burke's Peerage'' frontispiece (62nd edition, 1900)&lt;/center&gt;]]

Serious scholars have always taken little account of Burke's books, exposing their flaws from time to time. In 1877, the Oxford professor [[Edward Augustus Freeman]] attacked ''in language of almost unexampled scorn, the fables and the fictions'' in Burke's,&lt;ref name = Round&gt;{{cite|title = Studies in Peerage and Family History|first = J. Horace |last = Round|location = London|year = 1901|ISBN = 0-8063-0426-X|url = https://archive.org/details/round1910|access-date = 25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he could readily find a pedigree that was ''purely mythical – if indeed mythical is not too respectable a name for what must be in many cases the work of deliberate invention …. (and) all but invariably false. As a rule, it is not only false, but impossible … not merely fictions, but exactly that kind of fiction which is, in its beginning, deliberate and interested falsehood.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|article = Pedigrees and Pedigree-Makers |title = Contemporary Review|volume = XXX |pages = 11 to 41|date = June 1877|first = Edward A.|last = Freeman }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reputation of the imprint in informed circles was well established by 1893 when [[Oscar Wilde]] in the play ''[[A Woman of No Importance]]'' wrote: "You should study the Peerage, Gerald. It is the one book a young man about town should know thoroughly, and it is the best thing in fiction the English have ever done!" Such barbs had little effect for, writing in 1901, the historian [[J. Horace Round]] aimed many blows at the ''old fables'' and ''grotesquely impossible tales'' still being perpetuated by Burke's.&lt;ref name = Round/&gt;

'''Buyeo Hyo''' (扶餘孝, ? – ?) was a prince of [[Baekje]], one of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]]. He was a son of the last king, [[Uija of Baekje]]. When [[Sabi (Korea)|Sabi]], the capital fell to the [[Silla-Tang alliance]] in 660 he fled to [[Ungjin]] with his mother the queen. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Samguk Sagi | language = Korean | url = http://www.koreandb.net/sam/bon/samkuk/04_280_2001521.htm | quote = 王子扶餘豊 嘗質於倭國者 立之爲王 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000151/http://www.koreandb.net/sam/bon/samkuk/04_280_2001521.htm | archivedate = 2007-09-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They went to Busosanseong (Busosan Fortress) where they held out for a short time but there were many that knew that could not withstand the forces of the Silla-Tang alliance and a certain soldier opened up the gate and surrendered to fortress. After this he was taken to [[Luoyang]] in China where he disappears from history.

His younger brother, Zenkō (善光 or 禅広), settled in Japan and was given the family name [[Kudara no Konikishi]] (百濟王; king of Baekje) by the emperor of Japan.

'''Catherine Evelyn Smith''' (born 25 April 1947 in [[Hamilton, Ontario]])&lt;ref name=CESMITH1&gt;{{cite web| title = Citation for Hamilton, Ontario birthplace: Cathy Smith| url=http://www.corfid.com/gl/press/press14.htm| accessdate = 2007-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Canadian occasional [[backup singer]], [[rock music|rock]] [[groupie]], [[drug dealer]], and legal secretary, who served 15 months in the [[California Institution for Women|California state prison]] system for injecting [[John Belushi]] with a fatal dose of [[Speedball (drug)|heroin and cocaine]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/17422739/ns/today-entertainment/t/gone-years-belushis-impact-still-felt/# |title=Gone 25 years, Belushi’s impact still felt|work=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith had been paid for a front-page headline story in the [[Hollywood]] [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] the ''[[National Enquirer]]'',&lt;ref name=CESMITH4&gt;{{cite news| title = ''New York Times'' Belushi Case Judge Holds 2 Reporters in Contempt| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/12/us/around-the-nation-belushi-case-judge-holds-2-reporters-in-contempt.html?emc=rss&amp;partner=rssnyt| accessdate = 2007-04-07 | work=The New York Times | date=1985-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she stated she was the person who injected the actor with a fatal drug overdose. Smith co-wrote the book ''Chasing the Dragon'' (1984)&lt;ref name=CESMITH17&gt;{{cite web| title= Book: "Chasing the Dragon".|url=http://www.allbookstores.com/book/0919493505/Cathy_Smith/Chasing_The_Dragon.html| accessdate = 2007-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; which told her life story; its title alludes to Smith's [[heroin addiction]]. Smith appeared prominently in the [[Bob Woodward]] book ''[[Wired (book)|Wired: The Short Life and Fast Times of John Belushi]]'' (1984) and was played by [[Patti D'Arbanville]] in the 1989 [[Wired (film)|film version of ''Wired'']].

==Levon Helm and The Band==
Smith became notorious in the Belushi case, but her association with celebrities went back at least 20 years prior to her confession in the ''National Enquirer''. Her earliest acquaintance was with [[Levon Helm]], who later joined [[the Band]], in 1963.&lt;ref name=CESMITH2&gt;{{cite web| title = Book: "This Wheel's on Fire"| url=http://theband.hiof.no/books/this_wheels_on_fire.html| website=The Band|accessdate = 2007-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography, Helm recalls that Smith first met him in [[Hamilton, Ontario]].&lt;ref name=CESMITH3&gt;{{cite web| title = The Band's guestbook at Official web site| url=http://theband.hiof.no/guestbook/may_00.html| accessdate = 2007-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helm, with friend and bandmate [[Rick Danko]], was in a band called the Hawks at the time (see [[Ronnie Hawkins]]). At one point, the musicians were in Toronto facing a drug bust.&lt;ref name=CESMITH15&gt;{{cite web| title = Peter Viney, "14 Years old" citation at Official web site of ''The Band''| url=http://theband.hiof.no/articles/the_weight_viney.html#sdfootnote14sym| accessdate = 2007-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith has been connected to the Band's famous song, "[[The Weight]]" (1968).&lt;ref name="CESMITH5" /&gt; Smith says in ''Rock and Roll Toronto: From Alanis to Zeppelin'' (1997),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Goddard, John Goddard  |author2=Crouse, Richard |title=Rock and Roll Toronto: From Alanis to Zeppelin|publisher= Doubleday|date= 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Richard Manuel]] offered to marry her, but she refused.&lt;ref name=CESMITH5&gt;{{cite web| title = Cathy Smith's connection to song; "The Weight".| url=http://theband.hiof.no/articles/the_weight_viney.html| quote="According to Rock &amp; Roll Toronto, Smith was impregnated by one member of the band, but the identity of the father was not clear." | accessdate = 2007-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, she continued to tour and party with Helm, Danko, and Manuel through the 1960s, and at one point became pregnant with a child known as "the band baby," as its paternity was unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoskyns|first=Barney|title=Across The Great Divide: The Band And America|year=1993|publisher=Hyperion|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-7868-8027-9|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later had an affair with [[Gordon Lightfoot]]. After the affair ended, Smith returned to Helm and the circle who comprised The Band.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== Gordon Lightfoot ==
Smith became an employee and then [[mistress (lover)|mistress]] of [[Canadians|Canadian]] singer-songwriter [[Gordon Lightfoot]] in the early to mid-1970s.

The Smith-Lightfoot affair was volatile and illustrated in the lyrics of "[[Sundown (Gordon Lightfoot song)|Sundown]]" (1974), Lightfoot's No. 1 hit and most lucrative song. It reflects the dark feelings Lightfoot was experiencing at the time, with lyrics such as: "Sometimes I think it's a shame / When I get feeling better when I'm feeling no pain." Drinking too much and married to another woman, he on one occasion broke Smith's cheekbone in a fight.&lt;ref name=CESMITH8&gt;{{cite web| title =Lightfoot broke Smith's cheekbone.|url=http://www.corfid.com/gl/press/press04.htm| accessdate = 2007-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lightfoot has stated of his three-year relationship with Smith, "I was sometimes crazy with jealousy".&lt;ref name=CESMITH9&gt;{{cite web| title ="I was sometimes crazy with jealousy".- Gordon Lightfoot|url=http://www.corfid.com/gl/press/press14.htm| accessdate = 2007-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bluegrass musicians Bruce and Brian Good, [[The Good Brothers]], who were one of Lightfoot's opening acts during that time, got fired by Lightfoot for "flirting" with Smith.&lt;ref name=CESMITH12&gt;{{cite web| title =James &amp; the Good Brothers fired by Lightfoot for flirting w/ Smith.|url=http://www3.sympatico.ca/tnunn/onradio.htm| accessdate = 2007-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith was cited in Lightfoot's divorce papers, and shortly after his affair with Smith ended, Lightfoot was a party to the most expensive divorce settlement in Canadian history to that date.&lt;ref name=CESMITH&gt;{{cite web| title =After "Sundown" Gordon Lightfoot makes up for lost time|author=Naglin, Nancy |url=http://www.corfid.com/gl/press/press26b.htm| accessdate = 2007-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1975 interview, Lightfoot expanded upon "Sundown" and hinted at the worry he experienced in his relationship with Smith:

{{quote|All it is, is a thought about a situation where someone is wondering what his loved one is doing at the moment. He doesn't quite know where she is. He's not ready to give up on her, either, and that's about all I got to say about that.&lt;ref name=CESMITH10&gt;{{cite web| title =Song Facts: "Sundown".|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=3833| accessdate = 2007-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lightfoot gave another insight into his relationship with Smith in a 2000 interview when he remarked upon "Sundown" being:

{{quote|[A] back-alley kind of tune. It's based on infidelity – I've seen both sides of that.&lt;ref name=CESMITH11&gt;{{cite web| title =Gordon Lightfoot article: "Still out there."|url=http://www.s-t.com/daily/12-00/12-04-00/b02ae081.htm| accessdate = 2007-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2008, Lightfoot gave an interview confirming that "Sundown" was written with his then-girlfriend in mind:

{{quote|I think my girlfriend was out with her friends one night at a bar while I was at home writing songs. I thought, 'I wonder what she’s doing with her friends at that bar!' It’s that kind of a feeling. 'Where is my true love tonight? What is my true love doing?'&lt;ref name=CESMITH16&gt;{{cite web| title =Gordon Lightfoot article: "Sunrise to Sundown".|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2008/01/gordon-lightfoot-sunrise-to-sundown/| accessdate = 2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2014, Lightfoot added further insight into his writing of "Sundown":

{{quote|Well, I had this girlfriend one time, and I was at home working, at my desk, working at my songwriting which I had been doing all week since I was on a roll, and my girlfriend was somewhere drinking, drinking somewhere. So I was hoping that no one else would get their hands on her, because she was pretty good lookin'! And that's how I wrote the song 'Sundown,' and as a matter of fact, it was written just around Sundown, just as the sun was setting, behind the farm I had rented to use as a place to write the album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Gordon Lightfoot Interview: 'Gordon Lightfoot here.

== Belushi case ==
After Lightfoot and the Band, around 1976, Smith became a backup singer for [[Hoyt Axton]], who was struggling with cocaine addiction at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Allen, Bob|date=1998|title=Hoyt Axton|work=Encyclopedia of Country Music|author2= Kingsbury, Paul (Ed.)|location= New York|publisher= Oxford University Press|page= 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; She sang on his song "Fearless" (1976) and co-wrote "Flash of Fire" (1976) with Axton.&lt;ref name=CESMITH13&gt;{{cite web| title= Smith sang backup on song; "Fearless" + co-wrote; "Flash of Fire".|url=http://theband.hiof.no/guestbook/may_00.html| accessdate = 2007-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith began using heroin in the late 1970s. In [[Bob Woodward]]'s book ''Wired'', she appears as a drug dealer to [[Rolling Stones]] band members [[Ron Wood]] and [[Keith Richards]] during their touring and rehearsals as [[The New Barbarians (band)|The New Barbarians]]. She moved to [[Los Angeles]] and, as her addiction increased, she became a full-time drug dealer and courier to Wood, Richards, and others in the entertainment world. Smith first met comedian [[John Belushi]] on the set of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1976, when the Band were the musical guests.&lt;ref name=CESMITH14&gt;{{cite web| title= Smith met Belushi on set of SNL.|url=http://theband.hiof.no/guestbook/december_98.html| accessdate = 2007-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She later met Belushi again through Wood and Richards, when Belushi contacted her to purchase the drugs that eventually killed him. Smith alleges that she injected Belushi with 11 [[Speedball (drug)|speedballs]] (a combination of cocaine and heroin) at the [[Chateau Marmont]] in [[Hollywood, California]] in 1982, and that this injection led to his death. According to Woodward, [[Robin Williams]] was on the scene at the time and was "creeped out" by Smith, whom he deemed a "lowlife."&lt;ref name=CESMITH18&gt;{{cite web| title= Robin Williams thought Cathy Smith was a "lowlife."|url=http://www.franksreelreviews.com/shorttakes/morbid.htm#belushi| accessdate = 2007-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belushi had been battling cocaine addiction for years and combining it with occasional heroin use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/wrong-time-wrong-place-wrong-people-19820513|title=John Belushi: Wrong Time, Wrong Place, Wrong People|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Released after initial questioning on the morning of Belushi's death, Smith spoke briefly to freelance writer Chris Van Ness. Then, two ''National Enquirer'' reporters, Tony Brenna and Larry Haley, spoke with her and published their lengthy in-person interviews with her under the headline: "I killed John Belushi. I didn't mean to, but I am responsible." Her revelation led to the charge against Smith in Belushi's murder and 13 counts of administering cocaine and heroin.&lt;ref name=CESMITH22&gt;{{cite news| title= (New York Times) "2 Writers in Belushi Case Cited for Contempt"|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/08/us/around-the-nation-2-writers-in-belushi-case-cited-for-contempt.html?emc=rss&amp;partner=rssnyt| accessdate = 2007-04-07 | work=The New York Times | date=1985-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''National Enquirer'' reporters refused to testify at the subsequent trial and were threatened with incarceration by Judge Brian Crahan; however, he later vacated the contempt order.&lt;ref name=CESMITH33&gt;{{cite news| title= (New York Times) "Contempt Finding Reversed For Writers in Belushi Case"|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/11/us/contempt-finding-reversed-for-writers-in-belushi-case.html| accessdate = 2007-04-07 | work=The New York Times | date=1985-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the police released her on March 5, Smith went to St. Louis on the advice of her lawyer, Robert Sheahen, to avoid reporters. Discovered there, she flew back to Los Angeles. Then she traveled to New York and eventually returned to Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Investigation Centers on a Burnt-Out Case, Cathy 'Silverbag' Smith|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20082686,00.html|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=People Magazine|date=July 19, 1982|author=Michael Small|author2=Salley Rayl|author3=Tony Costa|author4=Karen G.

[[File:Claire Starozinski 2008.jpg|thumb|Claire Starozinski in 2008]]
'''Claire Starozinski''' is a French teacher, writer, and animal rights advocate focusing on opposition to [[bullfighting]]. She is president of the ''AllianceAnticorrida'', which she founded in 1994, and author of several books and pamphlets on bullfighting, including ''On est toujours le taureau de quelqu'un'' (2003) and ''La Face cachée des corridas'' (2006). 

Michael Ogorzaly writes that Starozinski has taken part in several important legal battles in France to curtail bullfighting, including in July 2001 when the ''Alliance'' won a case in Toulouse that declared both that bullfighting was illegal, and that there was no continuous tradition of the practice there. The ruling was upheld in 2005 by the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;Starozinski, see Michael Ogorzaly, ''When Bulls Cry: The Case Against Bullfighting'', AuthorHouse, 2006, pp. 3, 41–42, 165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--taken from the French WP, needs a source: Born in Algeria, Starozinski moved to France in 1962, where she became an English teacher at the St. Stanislas Institute in Nimes.--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1541">'''Colonel Frederick''' is a pseudonym of the 18th-century author of ''Memoirs of [[Corsica]], Containing the Natural and Political History of that Important Island,'' 1768, and of ''The Description of Corsica,'' 1795. 
He was born c.1725 and came to London c.1750, but his place of origin is unknown. He claimed to be the son of King [[Theodore of Corsica]], and adopted the title of Prince of [[Caprera]], serving in the army of King [[Frederick II of Prussia]] then acting as agent in London for the [[Duke of Württemberg]]. He was probably an impostor, and according to some intelligence reports may have been a [[Poland|Polish]] Jew called Wigliawiski. Though penniless, he managed to gain the acquaintance of those in high circles and was for a time accepted into society. He died in poverty in 1797.&lt;ref name="Lettre à Pascal Paoli"&gt;{{cite book | title=''Lettre à Pascal Paoli'', trans. Éditions Materia Scritta, Bastia, 2005. | author=François de Negroni | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederick wrote an account of his purported father's life, ''Memoires pour servir a l'histoire de la Corse'', and also an English translation, both published in London in 1768. In 1795 he published an enlarged edition, ''A Description of Corsica'', with an account of its union to the crown of Great Britain. See also Fitzgerald, King Theodore of Corsica (London, 1890).

'''Flavius Claudius Constantinus''',&lt;ref name="Jones, pg. 316"&gt;Jones, pg. 316&lt;/ref&gt; known in English as '''Constantine III''' (died shortly before 18 September 411) was a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] general who declared himself [[Western Roman Emperor]] in [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] in 407 and established himself in [[Gaul]]. He was co-emperor from 409 until 411.

Constantine rose to power during a bloody struggle in Roman Britain and was acclaimed emperor by the local legions in 407. He promptly moved to [[Gaul]], taking all of the mobile troops from Britain, to confront the various Germanic invaders who had crossed the Rhine the previous winter. Constantine gained the upper hand after several battles with the forces of the [[Western Roman Emperor]] [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]]. As a result, Honorius recognised Constantine as co-emperor in 409. The activities of the invading tribes, raids by Saxons on the near-defenseless Britain and desertions by some of his top commanders led to a collapse of support. After further military setbacks he abdicated in 411. He was captured and executed shortly afterwards.

==Life==
[[File:Roman Gaul - AD 400.png|thumb|Roman Gaul prior to the crossing of the Rhine]]

In 406, the provinces of [[Roman Britain]] revolted. The garrisons had not been paid and had determined to choose their own leader.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, 6:1:2&lt;/ref&gt; Their first two choices, [[Marcus (usurper)|Marcus]] and [[Gratian (usurper)|Gratian]], did not meet their expectations and were killed. Fearful of a Germanic invasion and desperate for some sense of security in a world that seemed to be rapidly falling apart, the Roman military in Britain sought greater security in strong and able military leadership and chose as their leader a man named after the famed emperor of the early fourth century, [[Constantine the Great]], who had himself risen to power through a military coup in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, 7:40:5&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine was a common soldier, but one of some ability.&lt;ref&gt;Orosius, 7:40:4&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 407, they acclaimed him as emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Snyder|1998|pp=19}}, ''Age of Tyrants''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones, pg. 316"/&gt;

Constantine moved quickly. He crossed the [[English Channel|Channel]] at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Bononia]] (Boulogne) and (historians have assumed) took with him all of the mobile troops left in Britain, thus denuding the province of any first line military protection and explaining the disappearance of the legions from Britannia in the early fifth century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Elton, ''Constantine III (407–411 A.D.)''&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman forces in Gaul (modern France) declared for him, followed by most of those in Hispania (modern Spain). On 31 December 406 several tribes of [[barbarian]] invaders, including the [[Vandal]]s, the [[Burgundians]], the [[Alans]] and the [[Suebi|Sueves]] had [[Crossing of the Rhine|crossed the Rhine]], perhaps near [[Mainz]], and overrun the Roman defensive works in a successful invasion of the [[Roman Empire|Western Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Bury, pg. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine's forces won several confrontations with the Vandals and quickly secured the line of the Rhine. The sitting Western emperor, [[Flavius Augustus Honorius|Honorius]], ordered [[Stilicho]], his leading general, or ''[[magister militum]]'', to expel Constantine. [[Sarus (Goth)|Sarus the Goth]], a commander of Honorius, defeated two of Constantine's generals, [[Iustinianus]] and the [[Franks|Frank]] [[Nebiogastes]], who were leading the vanguard of his forces.&lt;ref name="Birley, pg. 460"&gt;Birley, pg. 460&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine's lieutenant, Nebiogastes, was first trapped in, then killed outside, [[Valence, Drôme|Valence]].&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, 6:2:3&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine sent another army headed by [[Edobichus]] and [[Gerontius (general)|Gerontius]], and Sarus retreated into [[Italy]], needing to buy his passage through the [[Alps|Alpine]] passes from the brigand [[Bagaudae]], who controlled them.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, 6:2:4&lt;/ref&gt; With these advances, Constantine controlled all of Gaul and garrisoned the Alpine passes into Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pgs. 458–459&lt;/ref&gt; By May 408 he had made [[Arles]] his capital,&lt;ref name="Bury, pg. 140"&gt;Bury, pg. 140&lt;/ref&gt; where he appointed [[Apollinaris (praefect)|Apollinaris]], the grandfather of [[Sidonius Apollinaris]], as prefect.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pg. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition as co-emperor===

In the summer of 408, the Roman forces in Italy assembled to counterattack. [[Hispania]] was a stronghold of the [[House of Theodosius]]&lt;ref name="Bury, pg. 140"/&gt; and loyal to the ineffectual Honorius. Constantine feared that Honorius' cousins would organise an attack from that direction while troops under Sarus and Stilicho attacked him from Italy in a [[Pincer movement|pincer manoeuvre]]. He struck first at Hispania.&lt;ref&gt;Zosimus, 6:2:5&lt;/ref&gt; He summoned his eldest son, [[Constans II (usurper)|Constans]], from the [[monastery]] where he was dwelling, elevated him to [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]],&lt;ref name="Birley, pg. 459"&gt;Birley, pg. 459&lt;/ref&gt; and sent him with the general Gerontius towards Hispania,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; where they defeated the cousins of Honorius with little difficulty; two{{snd}}[[Didymus (cousin of Honorius)|Didymus]] and [[Verinianus]]{{snd}}were captured, and two others — [[Lagodius]] and [[Theodosiolus]] — escaped, Lagodius to [[Rome]] and Theodosiolus to [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, Ch. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Constans left his wife and household at [[Zaragoza, Spain|Saragossa]] under the care of Gerontius and returned to Arles to report to his father.&lt;ref name="Bury, pg. 141"&gt;Bury, pg. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the loyalist Roman army mutinied at [[Ticinum]] ([[Pavia]]) on 13 August, which was followed by the execution of Honorius' general Stilicho on 22 August.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, Ch. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Intrigue within the Imperial court caused the general Sarus and his men to abandon the western army. This left Honorius in [[Ravenna]] without any significant military power, and facing a [[Goths|Gothic]] army under [[Alaric I|Alaric]] that roamed unchecked in northern Italy. So, when Constantine's envoys arrived to parley, the fearful Honorius recognised Constantine as co-emperor, and the two were joint [[Roman consul|consuls]] for the year 409.&lt;ref name="Bury, pg. 141"/&gt;

===March on Italy===
That year was Constantine's high-water mark. While he had been fighting Honorius' armies, some of the Vandal tribes had overrun Constantine's Rhine defenses and spent two years and eight months burning and plundering their way through Gaul. The tribes reached the [[Pyrenees]], where they broke through Constantine's garrisons and entered Hispania.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Constantine prepared to send his son Constans back to deal with this crisis when word came that his general Gerontius had rebelled, raising his relative, [[Maximus of Hispania]], as co-emperor.&lt;ref name="Birley, pg. 460"/&gt; Despite Constantine's best efforts, the feared attack from Hispania come the following year, when Gerontius advanced with the support of his barbarian allies.&lt;ref&gt;Bury, pg.142&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time [[Saxon people|Saxon]] [[pirate]]s raided Britain, which Constantine had left defenceless.&lt;ref name="Bury, pg. 143"&gt;Bury, pg. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Distressed that Constantine had failed to defend them, the Roman inhabitants of Britain and [[Armorica]] (Brittany) rebelled and expelled his officials.&lt;ref name="Birley, pg. 459"/&gt;{{sfn|Higham|1992|pp=71–72}}

Constantine's response to this tightening circle of enemies was a final desperate gamble. Encouraged by the entreaties of officials of the western court, he marched on Italy with the troops left to him.{{cn|date=August 2018}} They wanted to replace Honorius with a more capable ruler.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Constantine, though, had insufficient forces and retreated into Gaul in the late spring of 410.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Constantine's position became untenable; Gerontius defeated his forces at [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]] in 411; there his son Constans was captured and executed.&lt;ref name="Birley, pg. 460"/&gt; Constantine's praetorian prefect [[Decimus Rusticus]], who had replaced Apollinaris a year earlier, abandoned Constantine to be caught up in the new rebellion of [[Jovinus]] in the [[Rhineland]]. Gerontius trapped Constantine inside Arles and besieged him.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Surrender and execution===
[[Image:Siliqua Constantine III-RIC 1355.jpg|thumb|250px|Constantine III portrayed on a [[siliqua]]. The reverse celebrates the victories of the ''[[Augustus (honorific)#In the divided Roman Empire|Augusti]]''.]]

At the same time, Honorius found a new general, the future [[Constantius III]]. He arrived at Arles and put Gerontius to flight. Gerontius committed suicide and many of his troops deserted to Constantius, who took over the siege.{{cn|date=August 2018}} Constantine held out, hoping for the return of Edobichus, who was raising troops in northern Gaul amongst the [[Franks]].&lt;ref name="Bury, pg. 143"/&gt; But on his arrival Edobichus was defeated in an ambush.&lt;ref name="Bury, pg. 144"&gt;Bury, pg. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine, his hopes fading after his troops guarding the Rhine abandoned him to support Jovinus, surrendered to Constantius. Despite the promise of safe passage, and Constantine's assumption of clerical office, Constantius imprisoned the former soldier and had him beheaded on his way to [[Ravenna]]{{cn|date=August 2018}} in either August or September 411.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pg. 316&lt;/ref&gt; His head, on a pole, was presented to Emperor Honorius on 18 September. It was later displayed outside [[Carthage]].&lt;ref&gt; Heather, pg. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Athaulf]] the [[Visigoth]] later suppressed the revolt of Jovinus.{{cn|date=August 2018}} Roman rule never returned to Britain after the death of Constantine III. As the historian [[Procopius]] later explained, "from that time onwards it remained under [the rule] of tyrants."&lt;ref&gt;Birley, pg. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend==
Constantine III is also known as Constantine II of Britain. He is remembered as a [[List of legendary kings of Britain|King of the Britons]] in the [[Wales|Welsh]] chronicles and [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s highly popular and imaginative ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', where he comes to power following [[Gracianus Municeps]]' reign. In this version, the Britons ask Aldroneus, the ruler of Armorica, to be their ruler too, seeking a king who can defend them against the barbarians. Aldroenus refuses, believing the country to have diminished, but sends his brother Constantine to rule instead. Constantine becomes King and has three sons, [[Constans II (son of Constantine III)|Constans]], [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius]] and [[Uther Pendragon|Uther]], but is stabbed to death by a Pict.&lt;ref&gt;Monmouth, 6:5&lt;/ref&gt;

Geoffrey seems to have conflated the historical Constantine III with an unrelated [[Cornwall|Cornish]] king of a similar name, [[Custennin Gorneu]].&lt;ref&gt;David Nash Ford's ''Early British Kingdoms'': [http://www.earlybritishkingdoms.com/bios/constcdm.html Constantine Corneu] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301102049/http://www.earlybritishkingdoms.com/bios/constcdm.html |date=1 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to confusion among modern scholars but, beyond their names, Geoffrey's fictional Constantine does not resemble the historical one.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bartrum, ''A Welsh Classical Dictionary,'' National Library of Wales, 1993, pp. 157–158.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Denis Browne''' (1763 – 14 August 1828) was an Irish politician.

==Life==
Browne was the second son of two sons and four daughters born to [[Peter Browne, 2nd Earl of Altamont]] and Elizabeth Kelly of Lisduffe, [[County Galway]]. He was born and raised at the family home of [[Westport House]], [[County Mayo]]. He was a direct descendant of the [[pirate]], [[Gráinne Ní Mháille]] (c.1530-c.1603).

Browne served as an officer in the [[5th Royal Irish Dragoons]] from 1779 to 1784. Due to his brother's influence and the support of the Irish catholic interest, he was elected M.P. for [[Mayo (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|County Mayo]] in 1782, which he would hold till 1800. His uncle, [[James Browne, Prime Sergeant]], was dismissed in 1782 which led to the brothers going into opposition against the government. In time, they were conciliated by the [[Duke of Rutland]]'s administration. Browne was appointed to the [[privy council]] on 20 January 1794.

Browne supported [[catholic emancipation]] but would not help the Catholic Committee in organising elections in the county; [[Wolfe Tone]] believed this was because Browne was unwilling to lose any influence in his locality. On the other hand, Browne and his brother supported the government, keeping the administration in [[Dublin]] well informed of events in Mayo in the years prior to the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. In 1795 the brothers assisted over five hundred Ulster families who fled to Mayo in the wake of disturbances arising from the [[Battle of the Diamond]]. All the refugees were carefully questioned to root out any disaffected elements, the families settling on the family estates.

He was appointed [[High Sheriff of Mayo]] for 1798, the year of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|Irish Rebellion]]. He acquired the nickname ''Denis the Rope'' in the aftermath of the French invasion of Mayo in that year for his zeal in hanging suspected rebels. His own home in [[Claremorris]] was destroyed by the rebels. Browne had a well-earned reputation as a feared duelist. While Sheriff, he fought against [[George Robert FitzGerald]]; another, during the election of 1790, against his electoral opponent, John Bingham. In 1801 he fought against another parliamentary opponent, won, and was returned unopposed for [[County Mayo (UK Parliament constituency)|County Mayo]].

Browne's subsequent support for the [[Acts of Union 1800]] failed to gain him a [[peerage]], though his brother was made first [[Marquess of Sligo]]. In the following decades he represented Mayo (1800–1818) and [[Kilkenny City (UK Parliament constituency)|Kilkenny city]] (1820–26), strongly supporting military coercion in Ireland. However, he was still a supporter of catholic emancipation.

==Family==
He married his cousin Anne Mahon (died 1833) of Castlegar, County Galway, in 1790, having five sons and four daughters. Two of his sons, [[James Browne (1793–1854)|James]] and [[Peter Browne (MP)|Peter]], also served in the commons from the 1820s. He was instrumental in securing the election of his cousin, [[Dominick Browne, 1st Baron Oranmore and Browne]], supposedly encouraging him to fight a duel to gain votes (Martyn, 2001).

He died at his home in Claremorris. A portrait of him by [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]] hangs in [[Westport House]].

'''Edward Telfair''' (1735&lt;!-- True birth date has been lost to history - "January 1" date from National Governors Association is only used as a placeholder birthday --&gt; – September 17, 1807) was the [[List of governors of Georgia|Governor]] of the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] between 1786 and 1787, and again from 1790 through 1793. He was a member of the  [[Continental Congress]], and a signer of the [[Articles of Confederation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.nga.org/cms/home/governors/past-governors-bios/page_georgia/col2-content/main-content-list/title_telfair_edward.html | title=Georgia Governor Edward Telfair  | publisher=[[National Governors Association]] | accessdate=October 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Telfair was born in 1735 on his family's ancestral estate in western [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Charles J. "Edward Telfair (1735-1807)." ''[[New Georgia Encyclopedia]]''. May 26, 2015. Web. August 30, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  He graduated from the [[Kirkcudbright]] Grammar School, before acquiring commercial training.  He immigrated to [[Thirteen Colonies|America]] in 1758 as an agent of a [[Commission (remuneration)|commission house]], settling in [[Province of Virginia|Virginia]]. Telfair subsequently moved to [[Halifax, North Carolina]], and finally to [[Savannah, Georgia]], where he established his own commission house.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=T000114 | title=TELFAIR, Edward, (1735–1807) | publisher=''[[Biographical Directory of the United States Congress]]'' | accessdate=October 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived in Georgia in 1766, joining his brother, William, who had emigrated earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Harvey H.|title=Edward Telfair|publisher=American National Biography|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ers&amp;AN=88829488&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|accessdate=May 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Basil Cowper, Telfair built the commission house, and it was an overnight success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pressly|first1=Paul M.|title=Scottish Merchants and the Shaping of Colonial Georgia|journal=Georgia Historical Quarterly|date=2007|volume=91|issue=2|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=25565259&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|accessdate=May 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slave owner===
Telfair was a [[slave owner]] and a consultant on slavery issues.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Telfair Papers, 1764–1831; 906 Items &amp; 5 Volumes; Savannah, Georgia; "Papers of a merchant, governor of Georgia, and delegate to the Continental Congress".&lt;/ref&gt; His mercantile firm dealt in slaves, among other things, and contemporary correspondence of his included discussions of such topics as: the management of slaves; the purchase and sale of slaves; runaway slaves; the mortality rate of slaves born on plantations; the difficulty of selling closely related slaves; and the relations between whites and [[Freedman|freedmen]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Revolutionary period==
Telfair was a member of a [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]] (1775–1776), and was a delegate to the Georgia [[Provincial Congress]] meeting at Savannah in 1776. He was also a member of the Georgia [[Committee of Intelligence]] in 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Harvey H.|title=Edward Telfair|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ers&amp;AN=88829488&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|publisher=American National Biography|accessdate=May 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Telfair was elected to the Continental Congress for 1778, 1780, 1781, and 1782.  He was a signatory to the [[Articles of Confederation]]. In 1783, during the [[Cherokee–American wars]], Telfair was commissioned to [[treaty|treat]] with the [[Chickamauga Cherokee]] Indians. Telfair was the designated agent (on behalf of Georgia) in talks aimed at settling the northern boundary dispute with [[North Carolina]] in February 1783. The land in question was generally regarded 
as Creek land, so the Cherokees readily signed the treaty. The Creeks refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cashin|first1=Edward J.|title=The King's Ranger : Thomas Brown and the American Revolution on the Southern Frontier|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780820310930|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nlebk&amp;AN=16266&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site&amp;ebv=EB&amp;ppid=pp_161|accessdate=May 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the citizens of Franklin County begged him to retaliate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1793 Jan. 1, Franklin County, [Georgia to] Edward Telfare [i.e., Telfair], Governor of Georgia / [citizens of] Franklin County|url=http://dbs.galib.uga.edu/cgi-bin/write_stats.cgi?stattype=fulltext&amp;dbscode=zlna&amp;format=jpg&amp;redirect=http://purl.galileo.usg.edu/nativeamericandocs/jpg/tcc352a.jpg|website=Southeastern Native American Documents, 1730-1842|publisher=Digital Library of Georgia|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secretary of War, [[Henry Knox]], instructed Governor Telfair not to retaliate against the Creek Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knox|first1=Henry|title=Henry Knox, Secretary of War, to Edward Telfair, Governor of Georgia|url=http://cdm16797.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/ONWT/id/571|website=Northwest Territory Collection, 1721-1825|publisher=Indiana Historical Society|accessdate=May 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served three terms as [[List of Governors of Georgia|Governor]] of the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|state of Georgia]]. During his second term as governor, he illegally granted thousands of acres of land to speculators as part of the [[Yazoo land fraud]].

==Later life==
Telfair was one of only 12 men who received [[electoral votes]] during the first election for President and Vice President of the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsj&amp;fileName=001/llsj001.db&amp;recNum=5&amp;itemLink=r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj00112)):%230010006&amp;linkText=1 Journal of the Senate]; Vol. 1; 1789; p8.&lt;/ref&gt; receiving the vote of one unrecorded elector from his home state of Georgia.

Telfair died in Savannah in 1807, interred initially in the family vault at ''Sharon'' plantation. Later in the 19th century, his remains were moved to [[Bonaventure Cemetery]] in Savannah.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Charles J. "Edward Telfair (1735-1807)." ''New Georgia Encyclopedia''. May 26, 2015. Web. August 30, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations==
One of Telfair's sons, [[Thomas Telfair]], represented Georgia in the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Charles J. "Telfair Family." ''New Georgia Encyclopedia''. May 26, 2015. Web. August 30, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The eldest of the Telfair daughters, [[Mary Telfair]], outlived her siblings and became the benefactor of the first public art museum in the [[Southern United States|American South]], now a complex of three buildings called the [[Telfair Museums]]. After her death in 1875, her will also provided for the founding of the Telfair Hospital for Females. Today it is known as Mary Telfair Women's Hospital and is part of Savannah's [[St. Joseph's/Candler]] health system.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Charles J. "Mary Telfair (1791-1875)." ''New Georgia Encyclopedia''. May 26, 2015. Web.

==Legacy==
Three months after Edward Telfair died, Georgia named [[Telfair County, Georgia|Telfair County]] after the former governor.

Later in the 19th century, Savannah's [[Squares of Savannah, Georgia|St. James Square was renamed Telfair Square]] to honor the family.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5307">'''Erkki Rapo''' (July 2, 1946 – February 28, 2004), also known as "Uncle Eki" and to international celebrities as "Eric", was a [[Finland|Finnish]] amateur [[autograph]] collector. He dedicated the last 40 years of his life to his hobby, and is among its best-known practitioners worldwide.

==Biography==
Erkki Rapo lived a rather nomadic, lonely life. He had a series of odd jobs, including stints as limousine driver, club MC and porter at a local university campus. However, autograph hunting was his passion and he never held a job for long. He never married, and his apartment has been described by those who visited it as "chaotic". One of his few friends was [[Jukka Häkkinen]] who served as Rapo's personal driver from the late 1980s until his death. Rapo was diagnosed with [[diabetes]] as a child and suffered from the condition throughout his life.

Rapo's celebrity encounters began in 1959 when he met [[Paul Anka]] before a concert in [[Helsinki]]. Over the following years Rapo made it his mission to meet other famous people in person, and he would spend hours planning and executing his autograph-hunting campaigns. In 1966 Rapo met [[The Beatles]] and managed to obtain all four signatures, which is considered something of a rarity because only [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]] are regarded by autograph experts as consistent autograph signers. Rapo also met and obtained autographs from [[Jim Morrison]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Plácido Domingo]], [[Boris Yeltsin]], [[Pope John Paul II]] and various other celebrities and notables. [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] considered Rapo a personal friend, even though his visits to Finland were limited by his tour schedules.

Along with the [[album cover]]s, [[magazine]]s and similar items favoured by autograph hunters, Rapo is said to have had supermarket receipts, plain paper and other odd items signed. He is said to have regularly carried autographed items with him, and many times he would try to sell these or offer them to a [[gas]] station or food store owner in return for gas or meals. Sometimes, if a buyer thought his prices were too high, he would photocopy the signed item and sell a fake autograph, albeit for less money than originally asked for.

As a result of his activities Rapo became a celebrity himself in Finland. He appeared several times in Finnish newspapers alongside the individual whose autograph he was seeking, and curious readers called the newspapers to ask about him. This motivated journalists to find out more about Rapo, and his life was later chronicled in Finland through newspaper interviews and articles.

In 1988 Rapo's collection was displayed at the [[Martinus Hall]] in [[Vantaa]].

==Bob Dylan incidents==
Rapo tried to obtain [[Bob Dylan]]'s autograph on a number of occasions. Dylan apparently disliked this. There are accounts of a 1989 encounter between Dylan and Rapo in Helsinki, where Dylan allegedly shouted at Rapo to stop following him. Rapo nevertheless went the next day to Dylan's [[hotel]] but Dylan, signing autographs for a younger crowd, left the area upon spotting Rapo.

In 1996, Rapo and Dylan crossed paths again, at a music festival. According to Rapo, Dylan told him that he didn't like giving autographs to adults, and stepped away.

==Later years==
Rapo did not stop autograph hunting until late in his life when, affected by diabetes complications, he scheduled fewer autograph-seeking dates. Rapo's illness forced him to stay at home for a large part of his final few years, until he died in 2004. His death was relayed by Finnish newspapers to readers across the nation.{{OR|date=June 2015}}

==Auction==
Shortly after Rapo's death, his autograph collection was [[auction]]ed by well known dealer [[Martin Sinisalo]] in Helsinki. His biography "Hei anna nimmari - Eki-Sedän stoori" by [[Tomi Lindblom]] &amp; Jukka Hakkinen was published in 2006.

'''Frederick Hambright''' (May 1, 1727 n.s.– March 9, 1817) was a military officer who fought in both the local [[militia]] and in the [[North Carolina Line]] of the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. He is best known for his participation in the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]] in 1780. Serving as a statesman early in the Revolution, Hambright joined the War in 1777, ranked a  [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in a local militia. His early actions were limited to occasional checks on (and some minor skirmishes with) [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] groups. This changed in 1780 with Hambright's important role at the Battle of Kings Mountain, which occurred near his lands in the newly formed [[Lincoln County, North Carolina]]. Hambright was commended for his bravery during the battle, though suffering a wound which forced him to permanently resign from military service. 

A native of the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], Hambright immigrated to [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]] in 1738. Between 1755 and 1775, he moved several times, first to [[Province of Virginia|Virginia]], and then to various areas in [[North Carolina]]. After the War, he lived the remainder of his life near Kings Mountain.

==Early life==
Frederick Hambright was born to Conrad Hambrecht on May 1, 1727 in [[Moosbach, Germany|Moosbach]], Bavaria (then part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and in present day [[Germany]]). He lived there for the first eleven years of his life, until the family immigrated to the [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania Colony]] on October 27, 1738, initially settling in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]]. At the age of eighteen, Hambright left his father's home for [[Henrico County, Virginia|Henrico County]], Virginia. There he married his first wife, Sarah Hardin, sister of Colonel [[Joseph Hardin, Sr.|Joseph Hardin]], who bore him 12 children, 6 of whom were raised to maturity.&lt;ref name="Hunter p. 325"&gt;Hunter p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; Along with several neighbors, Hambright again emigrated, in 1760, to rural [[Mecklenburg County, North Carolina]] (in the area which was to become [[Tryon County, North Carolina|Tryon County]] in 1768), settling near the [[Catawba River]] close to a frontier fortification that ensured his family's protection from [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] attacks.&lt;ref name="Hunter p. 325"&gt;Hunter p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; This area was to become part of [[Lincoln County, North Carolina]] in 1779, and eventually [[Gaston County, North Carolina|Gaston County]], in 1846.

==Revolutionary War==
Before serving as a soldier, Hambright was a signer of the [[Tryon Resolves]] of August 14, 1775, a document which declared that the signers would vow resistance against the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] for their actions at the [[Battle of Lexington]]. He was a representative of Tryon County, at the [[North Carolina Provincial Congress#Third Provincial Congress|Third Provincial Congress]], which lasted from August 20 to September 10, 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Connor p. 409&lt;/ref&gt;  In late 1776, Hambright took part in the [[Rutherford Light Horse expedition]] against the [[Overhill Cherokee]].&lt;ref name="Carolina"&gt;[http://www.carolana.com/NC/Revolution/revolution_cherokee_expedition_1776.html ''Cherokee Expeditions'']; Carolana.com; retrieved May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
 
When the war reached Tryon County in 1777, Hambright joined the colonial cause as a lieutenant colonel of the Lincoln County troops, (locally known as "The South Fork Boys"). Hambright was called the "Terror of the [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Tories]]".&lt;ref name="Hunter p. 326"&gt;Hunter p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 22, 1780, [[Patrick Ferguson|Major Patrick Ferguson]] was assigned as "Inspector of the British Militia", and was promptly ordered to march to Tryon County, North Carolina to raise troops and to protect the left flank of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis's]] main body which occupied [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dameron p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; By September 10, Ferguson had established a military camp at Gilbert Town, North Carolina and issued a challenge to the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] leaders to lay down their arms or he would, "''Lay waste to their country with fire and sword''."&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving this message, Patriot leaders [[Isaac Shelby]] and [[John Sevier]] quickly planned a preemptive campaign against Ferguson's army. They sent messages to military leaders [[William Campbell (general)|William Campbell]] and [[Benjamin Cleveland]] to join them.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, pp. 210-211&lt;/ref&gt; The rendezvous at [[Sycamore Shoals]] on September 25, brought to Campbell's army 200 Virginians and 160 North Carolinians.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan  p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; Another 1,100 "[[Overmountain Men]]," volunteers from the [[Washington District, North Carolina|Washington District]], also arrived to fight for the Patriot cause. The army met with Cleveland's 350 men at [[Burke County, North Carolina]],&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan  p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; and the now 1,400&amp;ndash;strong force marched towards the [[South Mountains (North Carolina)|South Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

When word of this force reached Ferguson, he sent a message to Cornwallis asking for reinforcements. This message did not reach Cornwallis in time, and on October 1 Ferguson retreated towards the [[Broad River (Carolinas)|Broad River]], asking for local loyalist militia to join him. By October 6, the Patriots had passed Gilbert Town and had reached Cowpens, South Carolina. Local sympathizers informed the Patriots that Ferguson had 1500 men camped on Kings Mountain.&lt;ref name="Buchanan p. 223"&gt;Buchanan p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

As they were pressed for time before Ferguson would continue on to Charlotte, Patriot leaders picked 900 men&amp;mdash;including Hambright's&amp;mdash;to ride to Kings Mountain.&lt;ref name="Buchanan p. 223"&gt;Buchanan p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; By the morning of the 7th, they had reached Kings Mountain, surrounded it, and attacked. The militia's commanding officer, [[William Graham (colonel)|Col. William Graham]], was absent during the battle due to an illness in his family, leaving Hambright in command.&lt;ref name="Hunter p. 326" /&gt; Hambright's group, along with six units, was positioned at the "ball" base beside the "heel" crest of the mountain, in position suited to attack the main Loyalist position. The objective was to catch the Loyalists by surprise. During the assault, Hambright was severely wounded from a musket ball shot to his thigh. Although bleeding badly, he continued fighting. Hambright's comrades were impressed with his bravery, and as fellow soldier, Samuel Moore, later put it: {{quote|"''He knew he was wounded, but was not sick or faint from the loss of blood&amp;mdash; [he] said he could still ride very well, and therefore deemed it his duty to fight on till the battle was over''."&lt;ref name="Hunter p. 326"/&gt;}} 

After the battle, Hambright was taken to his nearby log cabin for treatment. He survived, but had to resign from service due to his injury, which caused a permanent limp in Hambright's walk.&lt;ref name="Hunter p. 327"&gt;Hunter p. 327&lt;/ref&gt;

After his first wife's death on July 17, 1781, Hambright married Mary Dover. Together they had ten children, eight of whom survived to maturity.&lt;ref name="Hunter p. 327"&gt;Hunter p. 327&lt;/ref&gt;  He lived a quiet life on his homestead near [[Kings Mountain, North Carolina|Kings Mountain]], until his death on March 9, 1817 at the age of ninety.&lt;ref name="Hunter p. 327"&gt;Hunter p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; His remains were interred at Old Shiloh Presbyterian Cemetery in [[Grover, North Carolina]].

'''Friedrich Schmiedl''' (11 May 1902 – 11 September 1994&lt;ref name=forum/&gt;) was an [[Austria]]n rocket designer; known particularly for his development of [[rocket mail]].

==Rocket mail==
Schmiedl was born in [[Schwertberg]] in Upper Austria, and from 1924 studied civil engineering at the ''[[Graz University of Technology|Technische Hochschule]]'' in [[Graz]].&lt;ref name=forum&gt;[http://austria-forum.org/af/Wissenssammlungen/Biographien/Schmiedl,%20Friedrich Schmiedel, Friedrich] Austria-forum, accessed 24 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=astronautica&gt;[http://www.astronautix.com/astros/schmiedl.htm Schmiedl, Friedrich] Encyclopedia Astronautica, accessed 23 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

He began experiments with [[solid-fuel rocket]]s in 1918. From 1924 the experiments took place at [[Schöckl]], a mountain about 15&amp;nbsp;km north of Graz.&lt;ref name=forum/&gt;&lt;ref name=astronautica/&gt;

[[File:Schoeckl 10.JPG|thumb|Schöckl, where Schmiedl's rockets were launched]]
On 2 February 1931 he launched a rocket from Schöckl, which contained 102 letters. It was operated by remote control and landed by parachute at [[Sankt Radegund bei Graz|St Radegund]], a village about 3&amp;nbsp;km away. More successful launches were subsequently made, to St Radegund and to [[Kumberg]], a village about 6&amp;nbsp;km away. [[Philatelist]]s became interested in collecting letters which had been sent by rocket. Schmiedl envisaged that mail could be sent between towns by rocket; however the Austrian Post Office was not persuaded.&lt;ref name=forum/&gt;&lt;ref name=astronautica/&gt;&lt;ref name=mail&gt;[http://www.philatel2.com/jubilee/id269.htm Rocket Mail] King George V Silver Jubilee stamps, accessed 23 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=darling&gt;[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/Schmiedl.html Schmiedl, Friedrich] The Worlds of David Darling, accessed 23 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also worked on rockets used to collect meteorological data, and rockets for [[aerial photography]].&lt;ref name=forum/&gt;&lt;ref name=astronautica/&gt;

The rocket mail launches eventually had to be discontinued: they were mostly financed by special postage stamps, and in 1934 the Austrian Post Office forbade this financing; in 1935 the Austrian government forbade the possession of explosives, so private rocket development could no longer be carried out.&lt;ref name=forum/&gt;&lt;ref name=astronautica/&gt;

==Second World War and after==
When the Second World War began, there was military interest in his work; however Schmiedl, not wishing his research to be used for military purposes, destroyed the research documents. After the war he declined an offer to work on rocket development in the USA. Staying in Austria, he worked on boat propulsion.&lt;ref name=forum/&gt;&lt;ref name=astronautica/&gt;

Friedrich Schmiedl died in Graz in 1994. His bequest to the City of Graz  was used to establish the ''Friedrich Schmiedl Foundation'', to support new ideas to improve communications in the region of Graz.&lt;ref name=forum/&gt;&lt;ref name=wirtschaft&gt;[http://www.wirtschaft.graz.at/cms/beitrag/10066484/5084389/ Ing. Friedrich Schmiedl Foundation] Graz Business Server, accessed 23 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gran Sasso raid''' or '''Operation ''Eiche''''' ("Oak") was the rescue of Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] by [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Fallschirmjäger|paratroopers]] led by Major [[Harald Mors|Otto-Harald Mors]] and ''[[Waffen-SS]]'' [[commando]]s in September 1943, during [[World War II]]. The airborne operation was personally ordered by [[Adolf Hitler]], planned and executed by Major [[Harald Mors]], and approved by General [[Kurt Student]]. 

==Overview==
On the night between 24 and 25 July 1943, a few weeks after the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] and [[Bombing of Rome in World War II|bombing of Rome]], the Italian [[Grand Council of Fascism]] voted a [[motion of no confidence]] (''Ordine del Giorno'' [[Dino Grandi|Grandi]]) against Mussolini. On the same day, [[Victor Emmanuel III|the king]] replaced him with Marshal [[Pietro Badoglio]]&lt;ref name="fital"&gt;{{cite book | last= Whittam| first= John |title =Fascist Italy| publisher= [[Manchester University Press]]| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hHgMm6APG_0C&amp;dq=%22Vatican+Radio%22+%22Radio+London%22+fascist&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 | isbn= 0-7190-4004-3 | year= 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had him arrested.&lt;ref name="prisonrescue"&gt;{{cite book |last= Annussek |first=Greg |title=Hitler's Raid to Save Mussolini |publisher=Da Capo Press |url= https://www.amazon.com/Hitlers-Raid-Save-Mussolini-Operation/dp/0306813963|isbn=978-0-306-81396-2 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-567-1503A-05, Gran Sasso, Hotel Campo Imperatore.jpg|thumb|left|Campo Imperatore Hotel in 1943]]
[[File:Campo Imperatore 04(RaBoe).jpg|thumb|Campo Imperatore in 2008]]

Hitler's common procedure was to give similar orders to competing organisations within the German military. So he ordered the [[Hauptsturmführer]] (SS captain) [[Otto Skorzeny]] to track Mussolini, and simultaneously ordered the paratroop General Kurt Student to execute the liberation.

Mussolini was being transported around [[Italy]] by his captors (first to [[Ponza]], then to [[La Maddalena]], both small islands in the [[Tyrrhenian sea]]).
Intercepting a coded Italian radio message, Skorzeny used the reconnaissance provided by the agents and informants (counterfeit notes with a face value of £100,000 forged under [[Operation Bernhard]] were used to help obtain information) of ''SS-Obersturmbannführer'' [[Herbert Kappler]] to determine that Mussolini was being imprisoned at Campo Imperatore Hotel, a ski resort at [[Campo Imperatore]] in Italy's Gran Sasso massif, high in the Apennine Mountains. 

On 12 September 1943, Skorzeny and 16 SS troopers joined the ''[[Fallschirmjäger]]'' to rescue Mussolini in a high-risk glider mission. Ten [[DFS 230]] gliders, each carrying nine soldiers and a pilot, towed by [[Henschel Hs 126]] planes started between 13:05 and 13:10 from the [[Pratica di Mare Air Base]] near Rome. The leader of the airborne operation, paratrooper-[[Oberleutnant]] Georg Freiherr von Berlepsch entered the first glider, Skorzeny and his SS troopers sat in the fourth and fifth glider. To gain height before crossing the close-by [[Alban Hills]] the leading three glider-towing plane units flew an additional loop. All following units considered this manoeuvre unnecessary and preferred not to endanger the given time of arrival at the target. This led to the situation that Skorzeny's two units arrived first over the target. &lt;ref name="López"&gt;{{cite book|author=Óscar González López|title=Fallschirmjäger at the Gran Sasso|publisher=AF Editores |place=Valladolid |year=2007 |isbn=978-84-96935-00-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile the valley station of the funicular railway leading to the Campo Imperatore was captured at 14:00 in a ground attack by two paratrooper companies led by Major Harald Mors, who was commander-in-chief of the whole raid. They also cut all telephone lines. At 14:05 the airborne commandos landed their ten DFS 230 gliders on the mountain near the hotel; only one crashed, causing injuries. The ''Fallschirmjäger'' and Skorzeny's special troopers overwhelmed Mussolini's captors (200 well-equipped ''[[Carabinieri]]'' guards) without a single shot being fired; this was also due to the fact that General [[Fernando Soleti]] of the ''Polizia dell Africana Italiana'', who flew in with Skorzeny, told them to stand down. Skorzeny attacked the radio operator and his equipment and stormed into the hotel, being followed by his SS troopers and the paratroopers. Ten minutes after the beginning of the raid, Mussolini left the hotel, accompanied by the German soldiers. At 14:45 Major Mors accessed the Hotel via the funicular railway and introduced himself to Mussolini.

Subsequently Mussolini was to be flown out by a [[Fieseler Fi 156]] [[STOL]] plane that had arrived meanwhile. Although under the given circumstances the small plane was overloaded, Skorzeny insisted to accompany Mussolini, thus endangering the success of the mission. After an extremely dangerous but successful lift-off, they flew to Pratica di Mare. There they continued immediately, flying in a [[Heinkel He 111]] to Vienna, where Mussolini stayed overnight at the [[Hotel Imperial]]. The next day he was flown to [[Munich]] and on September 14 he met Hitler at [[Führer Headquarters]] [[Wolf's Lair]] in near Rastenburg.&lt;ref name="Kuby"&gt;[[Erich Kuby]]: ''Verrat auf deutsch.

==Aftermath==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J15420, Gran Sasso, Mussolini vor Hotel.jpg|thumb|upright|Mussolini leaving the Hotel]]
&lt;!---[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J07989, Berlin, Sportpalast, Waffen-SS-Angehörige.jpg|thumb|Berlin celebration of the troops under the command of Skorzeny that rescued Mussolini.]]---&gt;
Mussolini was made leader of the [[Italian Social Republic]] (a German [[puppet state]] consisting of the German-occupied portion of Italy).

The operation granted a rare late-war public relations opportunity to [[Hermann Göring]], with German propaganda hailing the operation for months afterward. (The Axis otherwise had little about which to boast in the fall of 1943.) The landing at Campo Imperatore was in fact led by First Lieutenant von Berlepsch, commanded by Major Mors and under orders from General Student, all ''[[Fallschirmjäger]]'' (German air force paratroop) officers; but Skorzeny stewarded the Italian leader right in front of the cameras. After a pro-SS propaganda coup at the behest of ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] and propaganda minister [[Joseph Goebbels]], Skorzeny and his Special Forces (''SS-Sonderverband z. b. V. "Friedenthal"'') of the ''[[Waffen-SS]]'' were granted the majority of the credit for the operation.
Skorzeny gained a large amount of success from this mission; he received a promotion to [[Sturmbannführer]], the award of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] and fame that led to his "most dangerous man in Europe" image.&lt;ref name="López"/&gt;

[[Winston Churchill]] himself described the mission as "one of great daring". As it turned out, however, this was one of the last of Hitler's spectacular gambles to bear fruit.

== Additional information ==
According to Michele Vicenzo's researches, based on interviews and supposed contradictions between eyewitnesses and on other documents, the Gran Sasso raid is considered as possible result of a secret agreement between Badoglio's Italian government and the German government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Last Secret of Mussolini|last=Di Michele|first=Vincenzo|publisher=Il Cerchio|year=2015|isbn=978-8884744265|location=Rimini|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerhard Mertins]] was among the paratroopers who participated in the raid.&lt;ref&gt;Romano Mussolini, ''My father, il Duce'', Kales Press 2006, S.29: ''"For more than sixty years, my father´s liberation from Gran Sasso was attributed solely to Skorzeny, even though Mors and Mertins played crucial roles."''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guatemalan people''' (Spanish: ''Pueblo guatemalteco'' &lt;small&gt;(collective)&lt;/small&gt;, ''Guatemaltecos'' &lt;small&gt;(individuals)&lt;/small&gt;) are people identified with [[Guatemala]], a multiethnic country in [[Central America]]. Guatemalans are mainly of [[Mestizos]] (mixed European and Amerindian heritage), [[indigenous people]] or Amerindians and descendants from [[Europe]]an people. Guatemalans are also nicknamed ''chapines'' by other mainly Spanish-speaking countries of the [[Latin America]].

Guatemala has a population of 15,824,463 (2014 est). In 1900, Guatemala had a population of 885,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.populstat.info/Americas/guatemac.htm |title=Population Statistics |publisher=Populstat.info |accessdate=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guatemala had the fastest population growth in the Western Hemisphere during 20th century. Approximately the half of the Guatemalan population live in poverty and 13.7% of them live in extreme poverty.

Guatemala is heavily centralized. Transportation, communications, business, politics, and the most relevant urban activity takes place in Guatemala City. Guatemala City has about 2 million inhabitants within the city limits and more than 5 million within the wider urban area. This is a significant percentage of the population (14 million).&lt;ref name="cia"/&gt;

The estimated median age in Guatemala is 20 years old, 19.4 for males and 20.7 years for females.&lt;ref name="cia"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gt.html |title=CIA World Factbook, Guatemala|website=Cia.gov |date=July 2011 |accessdate=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the lowest [[median]] age of any country in the Western Hemisphere and comparable to most of central Africa and Iraq.

=== Ethnic groups ===
According to the Census of 2010 by the National Institute of Statistics (INE) about 41.0% of the population is [[Mestizo]] (called ''[[Ladino people|Ladino]]''), [[Whites]] of European descent also called [[Criollo people|Criollo]] represent the 18.5% in their majority descendants of Spanish descent follow by the descendants of Germans, [[French people|French]], [[Italians]], [[English people|English]], [[Swedish people|Swedish]], [[Belgian people|Belgian]], [[Swiss people|Swiss]], [[Danish people|Danish]], [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Russian people|Russian]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Welsh people|Welsh]] and the rest of [[Europe]].

There are smaller communities present, including about 110,000 Salvadorans. The [[Garífuna]], who are descended primarily from Black Africans who lived with and intermarried with indigenous peoples from St. Vincent, live mainly in Livingston and [[Puerto Barrios]]. Those communities have other [[Afro-Guatemalan|blacks]] and [[mulatto]]s descended from banana workers. There are also [[Asian people|Asians]], mostly of [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] descent. Other Asian groups include [[Arab people|Arabs]] of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] and [[Syrian people|Syrian]] descent.

According to the Language Law of 2003, the languages of Mayas, Xincas, and Garifunas are unrecognized as National Languages.&lt;ref name=Decreto19-2003&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=June 10, 2007 |url=http://www.oj.gob.gt/es/QueEsOJ/EstructuraOJ/UnidadesAdministrativas/CentroAnalisisDocumentacionJudicial/cds/CDs%20leyes/2003/Leyes%20en%20PDF/Decretos%202003/Decreto%2019-2003.pdf |title=Ley de Idiomas Nacionales, Decreto Número 19-2003 |format=PDF |language=Spanish |publisher=El Congreso de la República de Guatemala |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927235237/http://www.oj.gob.gt/es/QueEsOJ/EstructuraOJ/UnidadesAdministrativas/CentroAnalisisDocumentacionJudicial/cds/CDs%20leyes/2003/Leyes%20en%20PDF/Decretos%202003/Decreto%2019-2003.pdf |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The peace accords signed in December 1996 provide for the translation of some official documents and voting materials into several indigenous languages (see summary of main substantive accords) and mandate the provision of interpreters in legal cases for non-Spanish speakers. The accord also sanctioned bilingual education in Spanish and indigenous languages. It is common for indigenous Guatemalans to learn or speak between two and five of the nation's other languages, and Spanish.

===Diaspora===
[[File:Indigenous Mayan Women at Chichicastenango Market.jpg|thumb|right|Indigenous Mayan Women at Chichicastenango Market]]
The Civil War forced many Guatemalans to start lives outside of their country. The majority of the Guatemalan [[diaspora]] is located in the United States of America, with estimates ranging from 480,665&lt;ref name="US_Census_2000"&gt;The [[2000 U.S. Census]] recorded 480,665 Guatemalan-born respondents; see Smith (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; to 1,489,426.&lt;ref name="MigrationDC_2006"&gt;{{cite web |author=Smith, James |date=April 2006 |url=http://www.migrationdrc.org/research/typesofmigration/global_migrant_origin_database.html| title=DRC Migration, Globalisation and Poverty|website=Migrationdrc.org|accessdate=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty in getting accurate counts for Guatemalans abroad is because many of them are refugee claimants awaiting determination of their status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guatemalans |url=http://www.multiculturalcanada.ca/ecp/content/guatemalans.html |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080420083039/http://www.multiculturalcanada.ca/ecp/content/guatemalans.html |archivedate=2008-04-20 |work=multiculturalcanada.ca |date=November 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Emigration to the United States of America has led to the growth of Guatemalan communities in California, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Texas, Rhode Island and elsewhere since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/USfocus/display.cfm?ID=385 |title=Migration Information Statistics |website=Migrationinformation.org |accessdate=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immigration ===
During the colonial era Guatemala received immigrants (settlers) only from Spain. Subsequently, Guatemala received waves of immigration from Europe in the mid 19th century and early 20th century.{{clarify|date=June 2015}} Primarily from Germany, these immigrants installed coffee and cardamom [[fincas]] in [[Alta Verapaz]], [[Zacapa]], [[Quetzaltenango]], [[Baja Verapaz]] and [[Izabal Department|Izabal]]. To a lesser extent people also arrived from Spain, France, Belgium, England, Italy, Sweden, etc.

Many Europeans who emigrated to Guatemala were politicians, refugees, families, entrepreneurs and mainly settlers, Guatemala had long been the Central American country that received the most immigrants, behind [[Costa Rica]] for 1950, that does not mean that the country no longer receive large numbers of immigrants.{{clarify|date=June 2015}}

From the 1890s there have been small communities of Asians (in particular from [[Korea]], China, Japan, [[Singapore]] and the [[Philippines]]) but in recent decades this has been growing. Also beginning with the [[First World War]], the immigrant population is being strengthened by [[Jewish]] and [[Pakistan]]i immigration.

During the second half of the twentieth century, Latin American immigration grew strong in Guatemala, particularly from other [[Central American]] countries, Mexico, [[Cuba]], [[Argentina]], etc. Although the majority of them resided only temporarily to go to their final destination, which was the United States.

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main article|Guatemalan cuisine}}

The '''Guatemalan cuisine''' reflects the multicultural nature of Guatemala, in that it involves food that differs in taste depending on the region. Guatemala has 22 departments of (or divisions), each of which has very different food varieties. For example, [[Antigua Guatemala]] is well known for its candy which makes use of many local ingredients fruits, seeds and nuts along with honey, condensed milk and other traditional sweeteners. Antigua's candy is very popular when tourists visit the country for the first time, and is a great choice in the search for new and interesting flavors.

Many traditional foods are based on [[Maya cuisine]] and prominently feature corn, chilis and beans as key ingredients. Various dishes may have the same name as dishes from a neighboring country, but may in fact be quite different for example the [[enchilada]] or [[quesadilla]], which are nothing like their Mexican counterparts.

[[File:Chiltepin mexico sonora.jpg|thumb|right|130px|Chiltepe, a common pepper used on some Guatemalan dishes]]
There are also foods that it is traditional to eat on certain days of the week – for example, by tradition it is known that on Thursday, the typical food is "paches", which is like a [[tamale]] made with a base of potato, and on Sundays it is traditional to eat tamales, due to the fact that Sundays are considered holidays. Certain dishes are also associated with special occasions, such as [[fiambre]] for [[All Saints Day]] on November 1 and tamales, which are common [[Christmas]].

There are reportedly hundreds of varieties of [[tamales]] throughout Guatemala. They key variations are what is in the ''[[masa]]'' or dough ([[corn]], [[potatoes]], [[rice]]), what's in the filling (meat, fruits, nuts), and what is it wrapped with (leaves, husks). The masa is made out of corn that is not sweet, such as what is known as feed corn in the U.S.A. In Guatemala, this non-sweet corn is called [[maize]] and the corn that Americans from the USA are used to eating on the cob, sweet corn, they call ''[[elote]]''. Tamales in Guatemala are more typically wrapped in [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]] or [[banana]] leaves and mashan leaves than corn husks.

The ancient Mayan civilization lasted for about six hundred years before collapsing around 900 A.D. Today, almost half of the Guatemalan population is still Mayan.  These natives live throughout the country and grow maize as their staple crop. In addition, the ancient Maya ate amaranth, a breakfast cereal similar to modern day cereals.
[[File:Tamal chipilín.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Chipilín Tamal, a common dish usually eaten at dinner]]

=== Music ===
[[Guatemala]]'s national instrument is the [[marimba]], an [[idiophone]] from the family of the [[xylophones]], which is played all over the country, even in the remotest corners. Towns also have wind and percussion bands that play during the [[Lent]] and [[Easter]]-week processions, as well as on other occasions. The [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]] people of [[wikt:Afro-Caribbean|Afro-Caribbean]] descent, who are spread thinly on the northeastern Caribbean coast, have their own distinct varieties of [[Popular music|popular]] and [[folk music]]. [[Cumbia]], from the Colombian variety, is also very popular, especially among the lower classes.

=== Literature ===

The [[Guatemala National Prize in Literature]] is a one-time only award that recognizes an individual writer's body of work. It has been given annually since 1988 by the Ministry of Culture and Sports.

[[Miguel Ángel Asturias]] won the literature Nobel Prize in 1967. Among his famous books is ''[[El Señor Presidente]]'', a novel based on the government of [[Manuel Estrada Cabrera]].

[[Rigoberta Menchú]], winner of the Nobel Peace Prize for fighting oppression of indigenous people in Guatemala, is famous for her books ''I, Rigoberta Menchú'' and ''Crossing Borders.''

Historically, [[Catholicism]] was introduced by the Spanish and was the official religion during the colonial era. However, the practice of Protestantism has increased markedly in recent decades, with nearly one third of Guatemalans identifying themselves as Protestants, chiefly [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] and [[Pentecostal]]s. Growth is particularly strong among the ethnic Mayan population, with [[National Evangelical Presbyterian Church of Guatemala]] being an important denomination, maintaining 11 indigenous-language Presbyteries.

Traditional [[Maya religion|Mayan religion]] persists through the process of [[inculturation]], whereby certain practices are incorporated into Catholic ceremonies and worship when they are sympathetic to the meaning of Catholic belief.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.focolare.org/en/news/2011/07/28/dal-guatemala-il-focolare-scuola-d%E2%80%99inculturazione/ From Guatemala: the focolare, a school of inculturation].

The government has instituted a policy of providing altars at every Mayan ruin found in the country, so traditional ceremonies may be performed there.

'''Jerry Mouse''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] and one of the title characters (the other being [[Tom Cat]]) in [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s series of ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' theatrical cartoon short films. Created by [[William Hanna]] and [[Joseph Barbera]], Jerry is a brown [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[house mouse]], who first appeared as a mouse named Jinx in the 1940 MGM animated short ''[[Puss Gets the Boot]]''.&lt;ref name="JBarberaPuss"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Barbera|first=Joe| authorlink=Joseph Barbera|title=My Life in 'Toons: From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century|publisher=Turner Publishing|year=1994|location=Atlanta, GA|pages=73–76|url=|doi=|id =|isbn=1-57036-042-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanna gave the mouse's original name as "Jinx",&lt;ref name="WHannaPuss"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hanna|first=William|authorlink=William Hanna| title=A Cast of Friends|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2000|location=|pages=39–46|url=|doi=|id=| isbn=0-306-80917-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Barbera claimed the mouse went unnamed in his first appearance.&lt;ref name="JBarberaPuss"/&gt;

==History==

===''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons===
The name "Jerry" was chosen by MGM animator John Carr, who submitted "Tom and Jerry" as potential names for the duo after an important [[Loews Inc.]] distributor in Texas asked for follow-ups to ''Puss Gets the Boot''.&lt;ref name="JBarberaPuss"/&gt; While the idea of a cat-and-mouse duo was considered shopworn by the 1940s,&lt;ref name="JBarberaPuss"/&gt; Hanna and Barbera decided to expand upon the standard expected hunter/prey relationship. Their Jerry Mouse, an "incurable scene stealer",&lt;ref name="HannaonTJ"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hanna|first=William| authorlink=William Hanna|title=A Cast of Friends|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2000| location=|page=20|url=|doi=|id=|isbn=0-7864-0728-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; served more or less as the protagonist of most of the films; instead of being a "cowering victim" of his pursuer, [[Tom Cat|Tom]], he took delight in besting, and often torturing, his antagonist (though sometimes, Tom is just following orders or is even just minding his own business and is antagonized by Jerry).&lt;ref name="JBarberaPuss"/&gt; Hanna and Barbera considered Tom and Jerry "the best of enemies", whose rivalry hid an unspoken amount of mutual respect.&lt;ref name="HannaonTJ"/&gt;

In later ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons, Jerry acquired a young ward: a small grey mouse called "[[Nibbles (Tom and Jerry)|Tuffy]]" or "Nibbles" depending upon the cartoon,&lt;ref name="JBarberaTuffy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MaltinTuffy"/&gt; who was left on Jerry's doorstep as a [[Child abandonment|foundling]] baby in the 1946 short ''[[The Milky Waif]]''.&lt;ref name="MaltinTuffy"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Maltin|first =Leonard|authorlink=Leonard Maltin|title=Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons|publisher=Plume|origyear=1980|year=1987|location=New York|pages=303–304|url=| doi=|id=|isbn=0-452-25993-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jerry and Tuffy were also featured together in a sub-series of ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons set in 17th century [[France]] which featured the characters as [[musketeers]].&lt;ref name="JBarberaTuffy"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Barbera|first=Joe|authorlink=Joseph Barbera|title=My Life in 'Toons: From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century| publisher=Turner Publishing|year=1994|location=Atlanta, GA|page=96|url=|doi=|id=|isbn=1-57036-042-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these shorts, ''[[The Two Mouseketeers]]'', won the 1951 [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film|Academy Award for Best Short Subject: Cartoons]].&lt;ref name="JBarberaTuffy"/&gt;

Hanna and Barbera served as writer/directors of the ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons until 1956, when they also became the producers.&lt;ref name="BarrierMGMclosing"&gt;Barrier, Michael (1999). ''Hollywood Cartoons''. New York: Oxford University Press. Pg. 547-548. {{ISBN|0-19-516729-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons between 1940 and 1954 were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Short Subject: Cartoons, with seven of the shorts winning that award.&lt;ref name="IndVallanceB"&gt;{{cite news|title=Joseph Barbera: Animation pioneer whose creations with William Hanna included the Flintstones and Tom and Jerry |last=Vallance|first=Tom| date=2006-12-20|work=The Independent (London)}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32}} MGM shut down its animation department in 1957, but new ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons were produced by [[Gene Deitch]] and later [[Chuck Jones]] during the 1960s. Jerry would also appear in later ''Tom and Jerry'' productions made for television, a series of direct-to-video features, and ''[[Tom and Jerry: The Movie]]'', a 1992 theatrical film.&lt;ref name="JBarberaTJMovie"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Barbera|first=Joe|authorlink =Joseph Barbera|title=My Life in 'Toons: From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century |publisher=Turner Publishing|year=1994|location=Atlanta, GA|pages=234–239|url=|doi=|id=|isbn= 1-57036-042-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later productions eschewed much of the violence the 1940s and 1950s shorts were known for, and in several of the television shows Jerry was given a red bow tie and a kinder disposition.&lt;ref name="MaltinLater"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Maltin|first=Leonard|authorlink= Leonard Maltin|title=Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons| publisher=Plume|origyear=1980|year=1987|location=New York|pages=306–309|url=|doi=|id=|isbn=0-452-25993-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom and Jerry aren't always enemies; they have been known to team up on occasion.

===''Anchors Aweigh''===
On his own, Jerry Mouse appears in a fantasy sequence in the 1945 [[Gene Kelly]] MGM [[musical film]] ''[[Anchors Aweigh (film)|Anchors Aweigh]]''.&lt;ref name=nytimesGene&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0823.html |title=Gene Kelly, Dancer of Vigor and Grace, Dies |accessdate=2010-05-13 |author=Albin Krebbs |date=February 3, 1996 |work= |publisher=NY Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jerry appears as the ruler of a kingdom where music is banned because he feels he lacks talent, and Kelly persuades the mouse into performing a song-and-dance number with him.&lt;ref name="HannaonAnchors"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hanna|first=William| authorlink=William Hanna|title=A Cast of Friends|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2000| location=|pages=61–64|url=|doi=|id=|isbn=0-306-80917-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly and MGM had originally wanted [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Mickey Mouse]] as Kelly's dance partner for the sequence, but Disney was unwilling to license the character.&lt;ref name="JBarberaAnchor"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Barbera| first=Joe|authorlink=Joseph Barbera|title=My Life in 'Toons: From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century|publisher=Turner Publishing|year=1994|location=Atlanta, GA|pages= 97–98|url=|doi=|id=|isbn=1-57036-042-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanna and Barbera achieved the effect of Kelly dancing with Jerry by [[rotoscoping]]: live-action plates of Kelly dancing alone were shot first, and the action traced frame by frame so that Jerry's movements would match.&lt;ref name="JBarberaAnchor"/&gt; The success of the animated segment of ''Anchors Aweigh'', which was noted as "stealing the show" in contemporary trade reviews,&lt;ref name="HannaonAnchors"/&gt; led to two more live-action/animated projects for Hanna and Barbera and MGM: an underwater ballet sequence featuring both Tom and Jerry in [[Esther Williams]]' 1953 film ''[[Dangerous When Wet]]'', and the "Sinbad the Sailor" sequence of Kelly's 1956 film ''[[Invitation to the Dance (film)|Invitation to the Dance]]''.&lt;ref name="JBarberaAnchor"/&gt;

===''Tom &amp; Jerry Kids''===
In 1990, this version of Jerry wears a red bowtie, and has a tuft of hair on his head. He often taunts Tom (as a [[kitten]]) any chance he gets. Sometimes, in a few episodes, he is friends with/allies of Tom.

Jerry has had a number of voice actors over the years. Ever since his debut in ''[[Puss Gets the Boot]]'' his vocal effects were provided by co-creator [[William Hanna]] during the Hanna-Barbera era. [[Sara Berner]] also did vocal effects for Jerry in the short ''[[Baby Puss]]'' (1943) and voiced him in the short ''[[The Zoot Cat]]'' (1944), as well as ''Anchors Aweigh'' (1945) in a dance sequence with him and [[Gene Kelly]]. [[Billy Bletcher]] provided some vocal effects for Jerry in the short ''[[Mouse in Manhattan]]''. A sequence in the short ''[[The Milky Waif]]'' (1946) features Jerry and Nibbles disguising themselves as a pair of black people, in which the former is voiced by [[Lillian Randolph]] (same voice as [[Mammy Two Shoes]]). [[Paul Frees]] did Jerry's speaking voice in the shorts ''[[His Mouse Friday]]'' (1951) and ''[[Blue Cat Blues]]'' (1956). When the [[MGM cartoon studio]] shut down in 1957, [[Gene Deitch]] and European animation studio [[Rembrandt Studio]] took over, and voice actor [[Allen Swift]] did Jerry's voice during the 1961-62. During the [[Chuck Jones]] era in 1963-1967, his voice was provided by [[Mel Blanc]] and [[June Foray]]. [[Stan Freberg]] did his voice in the short ''[[The Cat Above and the Mouse Below]]'' (1964) and [[Dallas McKennon|Dale McKennon]] did Jerry’s singing voice in ''[[Cat and Dupli-cat]]'' (1967). In ''[[The Tom and Jerry Show]]'' (1975), Jerry was voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]. [[Frank Welker]] voiced him in ''[[The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show]]'' (1980-1982), ''[[Tom and Jerry Kids]]'' (1990-1994), and ''[[Tom and Jerry: The Magic Ring]]'' (2002). [[Dana Hill]] voiced Jerry in ''[[Tom and Jerry: The Movie]]'' (1992).

Other voice actors include [[Samuel Vincent]] in ''[[Tom and Jerry Tales]]'' (2006-2008) and [[Charlie Adler]] in ''[[Tom and Jerry in War of the Whiskers]]'' video game (2002). In ''[[The Tom and Jerry Show (2014 TV series)]]'', Jerry's vocal effects are provided by archival recordings of [[William Hanna]] and [[Mel Blanc]] from the original theatrical shorts.

==Popular culture==
Tom and Jerry were planned to appear as a cameo in the deleted scene "Acme's Funeral" from the 1988 film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''.

'''Joseph Franklin Rutherford''' (November 8, 1869 – January 8, 1942), also known as Judge Rutherford, was the second president of the incorporated [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania]].  He played a primary role in the organization and [[Development of Jehovah's Witnesses doctrine|doctrinal development]] of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]],&lt;ref&gt;Leo P. Chall, ''Sociological Abstracts'', vol 26 issues 1–3, "Sociology of Religion", 1978, p. 193 col 2: "Rutherford, through the Watch Tower Society, succeeded in changing all aspects of the sect from 1919 to 1932 and created Jehovah's Witnesses—a charismatic offshoot of the Bible student community."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Embryonic State of a Religious Sect's Development: The Jehovah's Witnesses" ''Sociological Yearbook of Religion in Britain'', ed. Michael Hill, 1972, issue 5 pp 11–12: "Joseph Franklin Rutherford succeeded to Russell's position as President of Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society, but only at the expense of antagonizing a large proportion of the Watch Towers subscribers. Nevertheless, he persisted in moulding the Society to suit his own programme of activist evangelism under systematic central control, and he succeeded in creating the administrative structure of the present-day sect of Jehovah's Witnesses."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Twentieth century'', vol 153, 1953 p. 14: "This latter phenomenon, perhaps the most widely spread politico-religious movement at the present time, is linked, as are so many, with a source in America, in this case Judge Rutherford, the New York founder of Jehovah's Witnesses."&lt;/ref&gt; which emerged from the [[Bible Student movement]] established by [[Charles Taze Russell]].

Rutherford began a career in law, working as a court stenographer, trial lawyer and prosecutor. He became a special judge in the 14th Judicial District of Missouri at some time after 1895.&lt;ref&gt;An Encyclopedia of Religion, by Vergilius Ferm, 1945, p. 674; New York Times, January 7, 1917, Section I, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; He developed an interest in the doctrines of Watch Tower Society president Charles Taze Russell, which led to his joining the [[Bible Student movement]], and he was baptized in 1906. He was appointed the legal counsel for the Watch Tower Society in 1907, as well as a traveling representative prior to his election as president in 1917. His early presidency was marked by a dispute with the Society's board of directors, in which four of its seven members accused him of autocratic behavior and sought to reduce his powers. The resulting leadership crisis divided the Bible Student community and contributed to the loss of one-seventh of adherents by 1919 and thousands more by 1931.&lt;ref&gt;P.S.L. Johnson, ''The Present Truth and Herald of Christ's Epiphany'', April 1927, p. 66: "Since the Fall of 1923 ... from 20,000 to 30,000 Truth people the world over have left the Society."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Penton 1997 50"&gt;{{harvnb|Penton|1997|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogerson 1969 p=37"&gt;{{harvnb|Rogerson|1969|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rutherford and seven other Watch Tower executives were imprisoned in 1918 after charges were laid over the publication of ''The Finished Mystery'', a book deemed seditious for its opposition to [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;"Postwar Enlargement of the Theocratic Organization", ''The Watchtower'', July 15, 1950, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beckford|1975|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rutherford introduced many organizational and doctrinal changes that helped shape the current beliefs and practices of Jehovah's Witnesses.&lt;ref name="Penton 1997 p=75"&gt;{{harvnb|Penton|1997|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rogerson|1969|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; He imposed a centralized administrative structure on the worldwide Bible Student movement, which he later called a [[theocracy]], requiring all adherents to distribute literature via door to door preaching and to provide regular reports of their preaching activity.&lt;ref&gt;"Testing and Sifting in Modern Times", ''The Watchtower'', June 15, 1987, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rogerson|1969|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also instituted training programs for public speaking as part of their weekly meetings for worship. He established 1914 as the date of Christ's invisible return, asserted that Christ died on a [[Dispute about Jesus' execution method|tree rather than a cross]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strictlygenteel.co.uk/riches/riches1.html ''Riches'', by J.F. Rutherford, Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1936, p. 27], "Jesus was crucified, not on a cross... Jesus was crucified by nailing his body to a tree. ...[http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-22.htm (Deuteronomy 21:22,23)] ... [http://bible.cc/galatians/3-13.htm (Galatians 3:13)] ... [http://bible.cc/acts/5-30.htm Acts 5:30.]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Flashes of Light—Great and Small", ''The Watchtower'', May 15, 1995, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; formulated the current Witness concept of [[Armageddon]] as God's war on the wicked, and reinforced the belief that the start of Christ's millennial reign was imminent. He condemned the observance of traditional celebrations such as Christmas and birthdays, the saluting of national flags and the singing of national anthems. He introduced the name "Jehovah's witnesses" in 1931 and the term "[[Kingdom Hall]]" for houses of worship in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society|1993|p=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote twenty-one books and was credited by the Society in 1942 with the distribution of almost 400 million books and booklets.&lt;ref&gt;''Consolation'', May 27, 1942, p. 6. It is not clear from this publication whether this included the distribution of Russell's earlier writings.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite significant decreases during the 1920s, overall membership increased more than sixfold by the end of Rutherford's 25 years as president.&lt;ref&gt;"Part 1—United States of America", ''1975 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'', p. 94, "...earthwide report shows that the Memorial of Jesus Christ's death on April 5, '''1917''', was attended by '''21,274'''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses in the Divine Purpose'', pp. 312–313: Memorial attendance figures in Rutherford's final years were 98,076 (1941) and 140,450 (1942)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Rutherford was born on November 8, 1869 to James Calvin Rutherford and Leonora Strickland and raised in near-poverty in a [[Baptist beliefs|Baptist]] farm family. Some sources list his place of birth as [[Boonville, Missouri]], but according to his death certificate he was born in [[Versailles, Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Penton|1997|p=47}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Dept. of Public Health, San Diego California, Joseph Franklin Rutherford, Certificate of Death issued February 6, 1942&lt;/ref&gt; Rutherford developed an interest in law from the age of 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rogerson|1969|p=34}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although his father discouraged this interest, he allowed Rutherford to go to college under the condition that he pay for a laborer to take his place on the family farm. Rutherford took out a loan&lt;ref name="Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society 1975 81"&gt;{{Harvnb|Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society|1975|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; and helped to pay for his law studies by working as a door-to-door encyclopedia salesman and court stenographer.&lt;ref name="Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society 1993 67"&gt;{{Harvnb|Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society|1993|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law career===
Rutherford spent two years as a judge's intern, became an official court reporter at age 20, and was admitted to the [[Missouri]] bar in May 1892 at age 22.&lt;ref name="Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society 1993 67"/&gt; He became a trial lawyer for a law firm&lt;ref name="Watchtower 1955, p. 175"&gt;"Modern History of Jehovah's Witnesses", ''Watchtower'', March 15, 1955, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; and later served for four years in Boonville as a public prosecutor. He campaigned briefly for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential candidate [[William Jennings Bryan]].&lt;ref name="Jehovah's Witnesses 1978"&gt;[[Barbara Grizzuti Harrison]], ''Visions of Glory – A History and Memory of Jehovah's Witnesses'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1978, chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed as a Special Judge in the Eighth Judicial Circuit Court of Missouri,&lt;ref name="Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society 1993 67"/&gt;&lt;ref name=timesjudge&gt;''The New York Times'', January 17, 1919, Section I, p. 9, [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1917/01/07/102307691.pdf As Retrieved 2010-03-02]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Religion: Jehovah's Witness", ''Time'', June 10, 1935, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,883470,00.html Online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biographies of Rutherford in the March 15, 1955 ''Watchtower'' and 1975 ''Yearbook'' of Jehovah's Witnesses state that his appointment as Special Judge was in the Fourteenth Judicial Circuit.&lt;/ref&gt; sitting as a substitute judge at least once when a regular judge was unable to hold court.&lt;ref name="Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society 1975 81"/&gt; As a result of this appointment he became known by the [[sobriquet]] Judge Rutherford. He was admitted to the New York bar in 1909 and admitted to practice before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society|1975|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Watch Tower Society==
[[Image:Jfrutherford1911.jpg|thumb|left|Joseph F. Rutherford (1911)]]
In 1894 Rutherford purchased the first three volumes of Charles Taze Russell's ''[[Studies in the Scriptures|Millennial Dawn]]'' series of Bible study textbooks from two [[colportage|colporteurs]] who visited his office. Rutherford, who then viewed all religions as insincere, shallow and hypocritical, was struck by Russell's sincerity and his sentiments towards religion, which mirrored his own view.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wills|2007|p=131}} Wills (p. 131) claims Rutherford had never doubted God's existence, but Wills does not cite a source for that claim.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'' (October 1, 1997, p. 6) cites a 1913 newspaper interview wherein Rutherford describes becoming an atheist after a Baptist minister claimed Rutherford's wife Mary would go to Hell because she had not been baptized.&lt;/ref&gt; Rutherford immediately wrote to the Watch Tower Society to express appreciation for the books.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society|1993|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was baptized twelve years later and he and his wife began holding Bible classes in their home.&lt;ref name="Jehovah's Witnesses 1978"/&gt; In 1907, he became legal counsel for the Watch Tower Society at its Pittsburgh headquarters, and from around that time began to give public talks as a "pilgrim" representative of the Society.&lt;ref name="Watchtower 1955, p. 175"/&gt; As Russell's health deteriorated, Rutherford represented him on trips to Europe&lt;ref&gt;"British Branch report", ''Watch Tower'', January 15, 1915, p. 26, Reprints 5616.&lt;/ref&gt; and in April 1915 he was deputized to speak at a major debate with Baptist preacher J. H. Troy over four nights in Los Angeles before an audience of 12,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rogerson|1969|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; debating various subjects, including the state of the dead, hellfire and Christ's Second Coming.&lt;ref&gt;''Yearbook'', Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1991, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Rutherford wrote a pamphlet, ''A Great Battle in the Ecclesiastical Heavens'', in defense of Russell&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mostholyfaith.com/bible/Reprints/Z1915MAY.asp#Z131:1 "Judge Rutherford's Spicy Defense", ''Watch Tower'', May 1, 1915, p. 130. R5685.]&lt;/ref&gt; and served as chairman of the Bible Students' Los Angeles convention in September 1916.

===Board of directors===
By 1916 Rutherford had become one of the seven directors of the Watch Tower Society; when Russell died on October 31, 1916 he joined vice-President Alfred I. Ritchie and Secretary-Treasurer William E. Van Amburgh on a three-man executive committee that ran the Pennsylvania corporation until a new president was elected at the annual general meeting the following January.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society|1993|p=647}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also joined a five-person editorial committee to run ''The Watch Tower'' from the December 15, 1916 issue. Russell's [[Will (law)|will]], drawn up in 1907, had named the five people he wished to run the magazine after his death;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mostholyfaith.com/bible/Reprints/Z1916DEC.asp#Z358:1 Russell's Last Will and Testament, ''The Watch Tower'', December 15, 1916.]&lt;/ref&gt; Rutherford appeared only on a second list of five alternative members to fill any vacancies that arose.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Penton|1997|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bible Student [[Alexander Hugh Macmillan|Alexander H. Macmillan]], who served as an aide to the executive committee, later wrote that tensions at the Watch Tower Society headquarters mounted as the day for election of the Society's officers approached. He wrote: "A few ambitious ones at headquarters were holding caucuses here and there, doing a little electioneering to get their men in. However, Van Amburgh and I held a large number of votes. Many shareholders, knowing of our long association with Russell, sent their proxies to us to be cast for the one whom we thought best fitted for office."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Macmillan|1957|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macmillan, who claimed he had declined an offer from an ailing Russell months earlier to accept the position of president after his death,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Macmillan|1957|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; agreed with Van Amburgh that Rutherford was the best candidate. According to Macmillan, "Rutherford did not know what was going on. He certainly didn't do any electioneering or canvassing for votes, but I guess he was doing some worrying, knowing if he was elected he would have a big job on his hands ... There is no doubt in our minds that the Lord's will was done in this choice. It is certain that Rutherford himself had nothing to do with it."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Macmillan|1957|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidency dispute===
{{Main article|Watch Tower Society presidency dispute (1917)}}
On January 6, 1917, Rutherford, aged 47, was elected president of the Watch Tower Society, unopposed, at the [[Pittsburgh]] convention. By-laws passed by both the Pittsburgh convention and the board of directors stated that the president would be the executive officer and general manager of the Society, giving him full charge of its affairs worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pierson et al| 1917|pp=5,6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By June, four of the seven Watch Tower Society directors—Robert H. Hirsh, Alfred I. Ritchie, Isaac F. Hoskins and James D. Wright— had decided they had erred in endorsing Rutherford's expanded powers of management, claiming Rutherford had become autocratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pierson et al| 1917|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, Hirsch attempted to rescind the new by-laws and reclaim the board's authority from the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rutherford| August 1917|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rutherford later claimed he had by then detected a conspiracy among the directors to seize control of the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rutherford| August 1917|pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, Rutherford gained a legal opinion from a [[Philadelphia]] corporation lawyer that none of his opposers were legally directors of the society. The Watch Tower Society's official 1959 account of its history claimed the legal advice given to the ousted directors confirmed that given to Rutherford;&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses in the Divine Purpose'' (1959) p. 71, col. 2&lt;/ref&gt; however, the pamphlets produced by the expelled board members at the time indicated that their legal advice, acquired from several attorneys, disagreed with Rutherford's.&lt;ref&gt;''Light After Darkness'' (September 1, 1917) p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Facts for Shareholders'' (November 15, 1917) p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; On July 12, Rutherford filled what he claimed were four vacancies on the board, appointing Macmillan and Pennsylvania Bible Students W. E. Spill, J. A. Bohnet and George H. Fisher as directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rutherford| August 1917|pp=14,15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between August and November the society and the four ousted directors published a series of pamphlets, with each side accusing the other of ambitious and reckless behavior. The former directors also claimed Rutherford had required all headquarters workers to sign a petition supporting him and threatened dismissal for any who refused to sign.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pierson et al| 1917|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former directors left the Brooklyn headquarters on August 8.&lt;ref name="Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society 1993 p=68"&gt;{{harvnb|Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society| 1993|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 5, 1918, shareholders returned Rutherford to office.

The controversy fractured the Bible Student movement and some congregations split into opposing groups loyal either to Rutherford or those he had expelled.&lt;ref name="Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society 1993 p=68"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'' (1993) identifies opposing sides as "those loyal to the Society and those who were easy prey to the smooth talk of the opposers" (p. 68). ''Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'' (1975) dismisses the four ousted directors as "rebellious individuals who claimed to be board members" (p. 87) and men who "ambitiously sought to gain administrative control of the Society" (p. 92).&lt;/ref&gt;  By mid-1919 about one in seven Bible Students had chosen to leave rather than accept Rutherford's leadership,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society|1975|pp=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over the following decade they helped form or joined other groups including the Stand Fast Movement, the [[Layman's Home Missionary Movement]], the [[Dawn Bible Students Association]], the [[Pastoral Bible Institute]], the Elijah Voice Movement, the [[Concordant Publishing Concern]], and the Eagle Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rogerson|1969|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Finished Mystery''==

In late 1916 Fisher and another prominent Bible Student at the Brooklyn headquarters, Clayton J. Woodworth, sought the Executive Committee's approval to produce a book about the prophecies of the books of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] and [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] based primarily on Russell's writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wills|2007|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work on the book, ''The Finished Mystery'', proceeded without the knowledge of the full Board of Directors and Editorial Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pierson et al|1917|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jehovah's Witnesses in the Divine Purpose|publisher=Watchtower|year=1959|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released by Rutherford to headquarters staff on July 17, 1917, the day he announced the appointment of the four replacement directors.
[[File:Scan of the cover for "The Finished Mystery" - published in the United States in 1917.png|thumb|left|"The Finished Mystery"—vol. 7 of "Studies in the Scriptures"]]
The book, which was misleadingly labeled as the posthumous seventh volume of Russell's ''Studies in the Scriptures'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/americanstatetr00howagoog Lawson, John D., ''American State Trials'', vol 13, Thomas Law Book Company, 1921], p. viii: "After his death and after we were in the war they issued a seventh volume of this series, entitled "The Finished Mystery," which, under the guise of being a posthumous work of Pastor Russell, included an attack on the war and an attack on patriotism, which were not written by Pastor Russell and could not have possibly been written by him."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crompton, Robert. ''Counting the Days to Armageddon''. Cambridge: James Clarke &amp; Co. 1996. pp 84–85: "One of Rutherford's first actions as president ... was, without reference either to his fellow directors or to the editorial committee which Russell had nominated in his will, to commission a seventh volume of Studies in the Scriptures. Responsibility for preparing this volume was given to two of Russell's close associates, George H. Fisher and Clayton J. Woodworth. On the face of it, their brief was to edit for publication the notes left by Russell ... and to draw upon his published writings ... It is obvious ... that it was not in any straightforward sense the result of editing Russell's papers, rather it was in large measure the original work of Woodworth and Fisher at the behest of the new president."&lt;/ref&gt; was denounced by Rutherford's opponents, but became a best-seller and was translated into six languages and serialized in ''The Watch Tower''.&lt;ref name="Rogerson 1969 p=40"&gt;{{harvnb|Rogerson|1969|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expecting [[Kingdom of God|God's Kingdom]] to establish rule on earth and for the saints to be raised to heaven in 1918,&lt;ref name="Rogerson 1969 p=40"/&gt; Rutherford wrote in January of that year: "The Christian looks for the year to bring the full consummation of the church's hopes."&lt;ref&gt;''Watch Tower'', October 1, 1917, January 1, 1918.&lt;/ref&gt; He embarked on a vast advertising campaign to expose the "unrighteousness" of religions and their alliances with "beastly" governments, expanding on claims in ''The Finished Mystery'' that patriotism was a delusion and murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wills|2007|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogerson 1969 41"&gt;{{harvnb|Rogerson|1969|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign attracted the attention of governments and on February 12, 1918 the book was banned by the [[Canadian government]] for what a [[Winnipeg]] newspaper described as "seditious and antiwar statements"&lt;ref name="Macmillan 1957 p=85"&gt;{{harvnb|Macmillan|1957|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 24 in [[Los Angeles]] Rutherford gave a talk entitled "The World Has Ended—Millions Now Living May Never Die" (subsequent talks in the series were renamed, "Millions Now Living ''Will'' Never Die")&lt;ref&gt;The initial delivery was entitled "The World Has Ended—Millions Now Living May Never Die". See:&lt;br /&gt;"Noteworthy Events in the Modern-day History of Jehovah's Witnesses", ''Jehovah's Witnesses – Proclaimers of God's Kingdom"'', 1993 Watch Tower, p. 719, "1918 The discourse "The World Has Ended—Millions Now Living May Never Die" is first delivered, on February 24, in Los Angeles, California. On March 31, in Boston, Massachusetts, the talk is entitled "The World Has Ended—Millions Now Living Will Never Die" [emphasis added]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Morning Tribune'', February 25, 1918, as recorded in ''Faith on the March'' by A. H. Macmillan, 1957, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; in which he attacked the [[Clergy#Christianity|clergy]], declaring: "As a class, according to the Scriptures, the clergymen are the most reprehensible men on earth for [[World War I|the great war]] that is now afflicting mankind."&lt;ref name="Macmillan 1957 p=85"/&gt; Three days later the [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|Army Intelligence Bureau]] seized the Society's Los Angeles offices and confiscated literature.

===Imprisonment and release===
In early May 1918 [[United States Attorney General|US Attorney General]] [[Thomas Watt Gregory]] condemned ''The Finished Mystery'' as "one of the most dangerous examples of ... propaganda ... a work written in extremely religious language and distributed in enormous numbers".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Macmillan|1957|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warrants were issued for the arrest of Rutherford and seven other Watch Tower directors, who were charged under the [[Espionage Act of 1917|1917 Espionage Act]] of attempting to cause insubordination, disloyalty, refusal of duty in the armed forces and obstructing the recruitment and enlistment service of the U.S. while it was at war.&lt;ref name="Rogerson 1969 41"/&gt; On June 21 seven of them, including Rutherford, were sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment. Rutherford feared his opponents would gain control of the Society in his absence, but on January 2, 1919 he learned he had been re-elected president at the Pittsburgh convention the day before, convincing him that God wanted him in the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Macmillan|1957|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Macmillan|1957|pp=105,106}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1919 the directors were released on bail after an appeals court ruled they had been wrongly convicted; in May 1920 the government announced that all charges had been dropped.&lt;ref name="Rogerson 1969 44"&gt;{{harvnb|Rogerson|1969|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reorganization==

===Administrative changes===

Following his release from prison, Rutherford began a major reorganization of Bible Student activities. At a May, 1919 convention in [[Ohio]] he announced the publication of a new magazine, ''The Golden Age'' (later renamed ''[[Awake!]]''). Because Russell's [[Last Will and Testament|will]] had decreed the Society should publish no other periodicals&lt;ref name="Penton 1997 p=56"&gt;{{harvnb|Penton|1997|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; the new magazine was at first published by "Woodworth, Hudgings &amp; Martin", with a Manhattan (rather than Brooklyn) address.&lt;ref&gt;''The Golden Age'', volume 1, number 1, October 1, 1919, cover, [http://www.strictlygenteel.co.uk/goldenage/ga1919.html As Retrieved 2010-02-16]&lt;/ref&gt; Within months Bible Students were organized to distribute it door-to-door.&lt;ref name="Penton 1997 p=56"/&gt; He expanded the Society's printing facilities, revived the colporteur work and in 1920 introduced the requirement for weekly reports of Bible Students' preaching activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rogerson|1969|pp=53,54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Annual report for 1920", ''The Watchtower'', December 15, 1920, "At the beginning of the fiscal year there were only 225 active colporteurs in the field. The number has now increased to 350, all of whom are devoting their entire time to the service ...

Rutherford]]Beginning with an eight-day convention at [[Cedar Point]], [[Ohio]], in September 1922 Rutherford, launched a series of major international conventions under the theme "Advertise the King and Kingdom", attracting crowds of up to 20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rogerson|1969|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences were urged to "herald the message far and wide".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society|1975|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stressed that the primary duty of all Bible Students was to become "publicity agents" in fulfillment of Matthew 24:14, especially in the form of door-to-door evangelism with the Society's publications.&lt;ref name="Penton 1997 60"&gt;{{harvnb|Penton|1997|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watchtower March 1, 1925 p. 72 col 2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 Rutherford began to teach that the Cedar Point convention and the events resulting from it fulfilled the prophecy of the 1290 days at Daniel 12:11.&lt;ref&gt;Watchtower December 15, 1929 pp 371–77: "Briefly, then, these prophecies and the dates of their fulfilment {{sic}} are as follows, to wit: The fixed "time of the end" is October 1, 1914 A.D. The 1260-day period ended in April, 1918. The 1290-day period ended September, 1922. The 1335-day period of blessedness began May, 1926, and goes on for ever."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Harp of God, 1928 edition&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, Rutherford published a booklet, ''Millions Now Living Will Never Die'', and a year later published his first hardcover book, ''The Harp of God''.  This was followed by a further nineteen hardcover books, each with one-word titles, such as ''Creation'' (1927), ''Jehovah'' (1934) and ''Children'' (1941). His publications reached a total printing of 36 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Penton|1997|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925 he gained full control over what doctrines would be taught in Watch Tower Society publications, overruling the refusal by the five-man Editorial Committee to publish his article, "Birth of the Nation",&lt;ref&gt;''Watchtower'', March 1, 1925 pp 67–74. In the content list on the cover the article is entitled ''Birth of '''a''' Nation'', but the article itself on page 67 is entitled ''Birth of '''the''' Nation''&lt;/ref&gt; which contained significant doctrinal changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Penton|1997|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rutherford later claimed [[Satan]] had "tried to prevent the publication of that article ... but failed in that effort";&lt;ref name="Watchtower, July 1, 1938, p. 201"&gt;''Watchtower'', July 1, 1938, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927 the Watch Tower Society ceased printing of Russell's ''Studies in the Scriptures''.&lt;ref&gt;WTB&amp;TS, "God's Kingdom of a Thousand Years Has Approached" (1973) p. 347&lt;/ref&gt; The Editorial Committee was dissolved in 1931, after which Rutherford wrote every leading article in ''The Watch Tower'' until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wills|2006|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1933 Watch Tower Society ''Yearbook'' observed that the demise of the Editorial Committee indicated "that the Lord himself is running his organization".&lt;ref&gt;''Yearbook'', Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1933, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rutherford expanded his means of spreading the Watch Tower message in 1924 with the start of 15-minute radio broadcasts, initially from WBBR, based on [[Staten Island]], and eventually via a network of as many as 480 radio stations.&lt;ref name="Rogerson 1969 55"&gt;{{harvnb|Rogerson|1969|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1931 talk was broadcast throughout North America, Australia and France, but his attacks on the clergy resulted in both the [[NBC]] and [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] radio networks banning his broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wills|pp=149–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928 Rutherford began to abolish the system of electing elders by congregational voting, dismissing them as "haughty" and "lazy", and finally asserting in 1932 that electing elders was unscriptural.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Penton|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wills|2006|pp=177–179}}&lt;/ref&gt; He impressed on elders the need to obey the Society's "regulations", "instructions" and "directions" without complaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wills|2006|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Service directors, who reported back to Brooklyn, were appointed in each congregation and a weekly "[[Jehovah's Witnesses practices#Midweek meeting|service meeting]]" introduced to meeting programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wills|2006|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933 Rutherford claimed that abolishing elective elders was a fulfillment of the prophecy of 2300 days at Daniel 8:13–14, and that God's sanctuary (the Watch Tower Society) was thereby cleansed.&lt;ref&gt;Watchtower July 15, 1933 pp. 214-15: "Beginning to count from the transgression resulting by reason of the League of Nations, and the giving of notice, which must begin May 25, 1926, the twenty-three hundred days, or six years, four months, and twenty days, would end October 15, 1932...What, then, took place at the end of the twenty-three-hundred-day period? ''The Watchtower'', issues of August 15 and September 1, 1932, brought before God's people the Scriptural proof that the office of "elective elder", chosen or selected by vote of creatures, does not Scripturally exist, and that therefore the selection of elders by such means should end." In 1971 the Watchtower Society changed the interpretation ending the 2300 days in 1944 rather than 1932.&lt;/ref&gt;

At a 1931 Bible Student assembly in [[Columbus, Ohio]] Rutherford proposed a new name for the organization, ''Jehovah's witnesses'', to differentiate them from the proliferation of other groups that followed Russell's teachings.&lt;ref name="Rogerson 1969 55"/&gt; Bible Students who opposed or abandoned Rutherford to form new groups were increasingly described as the "evil servant class" by ''The Watchtower'', which said it was wrong to pray for those who were "unfaithful".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wills|2006|pp=167–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Watchtower'', February 15, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later the term "Kingdom Hall" was introduced for the local meeting place of congregations.&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses – Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'' chap. 20 p. 319, 721&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, the door-to-door preaching program was extended to formally include "back calls" on interested people and Witnesses were urged to start one-hour [[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Students|Bible studies]] in the homes of householders.&lt;ref name="Rogerson 1969 57"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Testing and Sifting in Modern Times", ''The Watchtower'', June 15, 1987, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 1930s, he advocated the use of "sound cars" and portable [[phonograph]]s with which talks by Rutherford were played to passersby and householders.&lt;ref name="Rogerson 1969 57"&gt;{{harvnb|Rogerson|1969|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938 he introduced the term "theocracy" to describe the denomination's system of government, with ''Consolation'' explaining: "The Theocracy is at present administered by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, of which Judge Rutherford is the president and general manager."&lt;ref&gt;''Consolation'', September 4, 1940, p. 25, as cited by Penton, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; "Zone servants" (now known as ''[[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Circuit|circuit overseers]]'') were appointed to supervise congregations. In a ''Watchtower'' article Rutherford declared the need for congregations to "get in line" with the changed structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wills|2006|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Watchtower'', June 15, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1942, the year of his death, worldwide attendance at the annual [[Jehovah's Witnesses practices#Memorial of Christ's death|Memorial of Christ's death]] was 140,450 though his restructuring of the Bible Student community coincided with a dramatic loss of followers during the 1920s and 1930s. Worldwide attendance of the annual Memorial of Christ's death fell from 90,434 in 1925&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society|1959|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 17,380 in 1928.&lt;ref name="Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society 1959 312–313"&gt;{{harvnb|Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society|1959|pp=312–313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memorial attendance figures did not surpass 90,000 again until 1940.&lt;ref name="Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society 1959 312–313"/&gt; Author Tony Wills, who analyzed attendance and "field worker" statistics, suggests it was the "more dedicated" Bible Students who quit through the 1920s, to be replaced by newcomers in larger numbers, although Rutherford dismissed the loss of the original Bible Students as the Lord "shaking out" the unfaithful.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wills|2007|pp=142, 146, 157–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1931 Yearbook, Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''1942 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'', Rutherford wrote that the year's achievements "would, on the face of it, show that the Theocratic witness work on earth is about done".&lt;ref name="Wills 2007 p=223"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Yearbook'', 1942, Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doctrinal changes===

In July 1917, Rutherford had ''The Finished Mystery'' published as a seventh volume of the ''Studies in the Scriptures'' series. The volume, though written by Fisher and Woodworth, was advertised as Russell's "posthumous work" and "last legacy"&lt;ref&gt;''The Finished Mystery'', 1917, p. 2: "POSTHUMOUS WORK OF PASTOR RUSSELL His Last Legacy to the Dear Israel of God (Matt. 20:9)"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Students Monthly'', December 1917, vol. 9 no. 9, p. 1: "The following article is extracted mainly from Pastor Russell's posthumous volume entitled "THE FINISHED MYSTERY," the 7th in the series of his STUDIES IN THE SCRIPTURES and published subsequent to his death... In this posthumous volume, which is called his "last legacy to the Christians of earth" is found a thorough exposition of every verse in the entire Book of Revelation."&lt;/ref&gt; but contained several interpretations and viewpoints not espoused by Russell,&lt;ref&gt;Tony Mills, ''A People for His Name'', 2007, pp 97–8: "While he keeps faithfully to Russell's comments in most cases, there are a few times when he goes beyond Russell's plainly stated interpretation. In some of the chapters of Revelation on which Russell left no comments his imagination wandered free. He ridicules John Wesley, whom Russell admired, and his Methodist movement. He calls Europeans "the most cruel, bloodthirsty, quarrelsome, rapacious people on earth," a thought Russell denied. He ridicules Calvinists by saying that they have "lost their manhood, reason and common sense." He ridicules politics, patriotism, religion and almost everything the world holds holy, without (as Russell was careful to do) presenting the good along with the bad."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bible Students Tract Society, ''Notes and Comments on the Finished Mystery'', Feb. 1919, pp 6–7: "Thus we have Bro. Woodworth's distinct statement that none of these interpretations of Revelation are Pastor Russell's, but another's {{sic}} (presumably his own)... Have Pastor Russell's interpretations been followed? To this we reply that in many cases they have not. On the contrary, entirely contradictory ones are frequently given."&lt;/ref&gt; including an urging of all Bible Students to cast judgment upon Christendom and its clergy, the adoption of new dates for the fulfillment of particular prophecies, a claim that salvation is tied to membership within the Watch Tower Society, as well as shunning and censuring any who reject the interpretations given in the volume or related articles in ''Zion's Watch Tower'' magazine.

[[File:Mnlwnd.png|thumb|right|"Millions Now Living Will Never Die" contains some of the earliest doctrinal changes]][[File:1920 Rutherford NationalTheatre BostonEveningGlobe Dec17.png|thumb|right|Newspaper advertisement for Rutherford's "Millions" lecture.]]In the February 1918 discourse "Millions Now Living Will Never Die" (printed in booklet form in May 1920) a revision of Russell's calculation of a "Jubilee type" was presented, changing it from 1875 to 1925,&lt;ref&gt;''The Time is at Hand'', 1889, p. 183: "Reckoned from the beginning of the seventy years desolation under Babylon, the great cycle [50x50] ends with the year A.D. 1875."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Millions Now Living Will Never Die!'', 1920, p.88 : "A simple calculation of these jubilees brings us to this important fact: Seventy jubilees of fifty years each would be a total of 3500 years. That period of time beginning 1575 before A.D. 1 of necessity would end in the fall of the year 1925."&lt;/ref&gt; despite Russell's rejection of such a change a few months prior to his death.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watch Tower'' April 15, 1916 p. 127: "We cannot help it that many of the dear friends continue to tell what THE WATCH TOWER believes, and to misrepresent its teachings. Our kindest thought must be that they are not giving much heed to its teachings. Otherwise they would know from its columns that we are not looking forward to 1925, nor to any other date. As expressly stated in THE WATCH TOWER, we are simply going on, our last date or appointment having been passed more than a year ago...we have no different time in mind from the Scriptures on the subject and do not expect to have any."&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1920 the Society published a new edition of Russell's 1881 ''Tabernacle Shadows of the Better Sacrifices''. It included an appendix introducing many alterations or reinterpretations of Russell's original views on the death of Jesus and the role of Christ's followers in heaven as typified in the ceremonies of the Jewish tabernacle.&lt;ref&gt;Tabernacle Shadows of the Better Sacrifices, 1920, ''Appendix of Notes'' pp 133–155: "Thirty-nine years have passed since the publication of this little booklet; and during that time some of the teachings herein contained have come to be seen in clearer light – even as the details of a mountain become more discernible the closer one draws to it. In harmony with these clearer understandings we suggest the following alterations in appendix form, leaving the text intact out of deference to the honored and beloved writer of the booklet."&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1922 Cedar Point convention Rutherford began teaching that Christ's reign had begun in 1914,&lt;ref&gt;''Watchtower'', December 15, 1922, p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt; and not 1878 as Russell had taught.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mostholyfaith.com/bible/Reprints/Z1881JAN.asp "How Long, O Lord?", ''Zion's Watch Tower'', January 1881.]&lt;/ref&gt; Rutherford expanded on this view in the March 1, 1925 issue of ''The Watch Tower'' in the article "Birth of The Nation", which he later acknowledged "caused a real stir or shake-up within the ranks."&lt;ref name="Watchtower, July 1, 1938, p. 201"/&gt; In 1927 he moved the date of the resurrection of the "sleeping saints" (all Christians who had died since Jesus' time) from 1878 to 1918&lt;ref&gt;Watchtower June 1, 1927 p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strictlygenteel.co.uk/light1/light1_6.html ''Light'' by J. F. Rutherford, Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1930, p 226.]&lt;/ref&gt; and as early as 1930 began to dismiss the year 1874 as the date for the invisible presence of Christ in favor of the year 1914.&lt;ref&gt;''The Golden Age'' May 7, 1930 p. 503&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Golden Age'' March 14, 1934 p 380 "Prior to 1914 and years thereafter we thought that our Lord's return dated from 1874; and we took it for granted that the ''parousia'' or presence of our Lord dated from that time. An examination of the scriptures containing the word parousia shows that the presence of the Lord could not date prior to 1914."&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1925 he developed the view of the battle of [[Armageddon]] as a universal war waged by God rather than Russell's belief that it was the decline of human society into social, political and religious anarchy. Rutherford based his interpretations on the books of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]], [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] and [[Psalms]] as well as additional material from the books of [[Book of Samuel|Samuel]], [[Books of Kings|Kings]] and [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wills|2007|pp=154,155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rogerson|1969|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Can This World's Armageddon Be Avoided?", ''Watchtower'', December 1, 1966, p. 730.&lt;/ref&gt; An article in the January 1, 1926 ''Watch Tower'' introduced new emphasis on the importance of the name "Jehovah";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society|1993|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1929 Rutherford taught that the vindication of God's name—which would ultimately occur when millions of unbelievers were destroyed at Armageddon—was the primary doctrine of Christianity and more important than God's display of goodness or grace toward humankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wills|2007|pp=181, 182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Penton|1997|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strictlygenteel.co.uk/prophecy/prophecy12.html J.F. Rutherford, ''Prophecy'', Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1929, pp. 319, 328–333]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strictlygenteel.co.uk/vindication1/vindication1_1.html J.F. Rutherford, ''Vindication'', Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, 1931, pp. 9–14, 65–68, 135.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932 he published an interpretation of a passage in Ezekiel describing the attack on Jerusalem by [[Gog and Magog|Gog of Magog]], in which he predicted an intensification of persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses that would culminate in God intervening on their behalf to begin the battle of Armageddon, which would destroy all opposers of God's organization.&lt;ref name="Wills 2007 p=223"&gt;{{harvnb|Wills|2007|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926 he discredited Russell's teaching on the importance of Christian "character development" or personal "sanctification"&lt;ref name="Penton 1997 60"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wills|2007|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Character or Covenant – Which?", ''The Watchtower'', May 1, 1926&lt;/ref&gt; and a year later discarded the teaching that Russell had been the "faithful and wise servant" of Matthew 24:45–47, warning that the desire to revere men was a snare set by the [[Devil#Christianity|Devil]].&lt;ref name="Penton 1997 60"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Watchtower'', January 1, 1927, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1926 Rutherford released his book ''Deliverance'' at the Bible Student's convention in [[Kensington]], England later interpreting the event as the fulfillment of the 1335 days of Daniel 12:12.&lt;ref&gt;Watchtower July 15, 1933 p. 214 col 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, Christmas was declared to be of pagan origin, and the following year its celebration by Bible Students was condemned as supporting "Satan's organization".&lt;ref&gt;''The Golden Age'', December 14, 1927, "The Origin of Christmas", pp 178–79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''1975 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'', 1974, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Mother's Day was condemned in 1931,&lt;ref&gt;''Vindication'' book 1, 1931, pp 158–60: "On the face of it the arrangement of "Mother's Day" seems harmless and calculated to do good. But the people are in ignorance of Satan's subtle hand in the matter, and that he is back of the movement, to turn the people away from God... Neither the man nor the woman should be worshiped for doing right, because such doing of right is their duty. Creature worship of any kind is wrong and an abomination in the sight of God."&lt;/ref&gt; with other holidays as well as birthdays officially renounced in subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;George Chryssides, ''Historical Dictionary of Jehovah's Witnesses'', 2008, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses: Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'', 1993, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928 Rutherford discarded Russell's teaching that the natural Jews would be restored to Palestine and return to God's favor, despite having declared ten years earlier that prophecies of their restoration were already being fulfilled with the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British takeover of Palestine]] from [[Turkey]] during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wills|2007|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; He denied there was a role for Jews in God's Kingdom arrangement and by 1933 he had reversed Russell's earlier teaching, claiming that prominent Jewish business leaders were "arrogant, self-important and extremely selfish," and would gain no favored standing with God.&lt;ref&gt;J. F. Rutherford, ''Favored People'', Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society, as cited by Wills, 2007, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; The teaching that God would restore the Jews to Palestine was discontinued around the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rogerson|1969|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell's teaching that the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] was built under God's direction&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Thy Kingdom Come|pages=309–376|url=http://www.pastor-russell.com/volumes/V3/Study_10.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; was overturned in 1928, when Rutherford asserted that it had been built under the direction of Satan for the purpose of deceiving God's people in the last days.&lt;ref&gt;The Messenger, August 5, 1928 p. 1: "When the Lord spoke of hiding his people in his secret place he was not talking about any chambers in the pyramid, built by the Devil himself."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Watch Tower, November 15, 1928&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement prompted further defections among long-time Bible Students.&lt;ref&gt;Great Pyramid Passages, 1924, reprint by Portland Area Bible Students, 1988, pp i–xxxviii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Messenger, August 5, 1928 p. 2: "It sure did set the tongues wagging at the Fair Grounds and resulted in another overhauling of the old trunk wherein are kept a few choice relics of what, until recently, we honestly believed the Bible teaches."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, Rutherford published a systematic reinterpretation of the book of Revelation.&lt;ref&gt;''Light'' book 1 and 2, 1930&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the symbols recorded in the book were applied to events following 1918, specifically to Watch Tower conventions held in the years 1922 through 1928.&lt;ref&gt;''Light'' book 1, 1930, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; These reinterpretations reflected both a wholesale rejection of his own earlier views as well as the [[Historicism (Christianity)|historicist]] interpretations of Pastor Russell.&lt;ref&gt;''The Finished Mystery'', 1917&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gruss, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Watch Tower'', Nov 15, 1916, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt;

At a [[Washington, D.C.]] convention in 1935, Rutherford rejected Russell's teaching that the "great company" of Revelation 7:9 was a "secondary spiritual class" composed of millions of Christians who would be resurrected to heaven apart from the [[144,000#Jehovah's Witnesses|144,000 "elect"]], and instead argued that the "[[Jehovah's Witnesses and salvation#The 'other sheep' and the 'great crowd'|great multitude]]", the "sheep" of Matthew 25 and the "[[Jehonadab|Jonadabs]]" of [[2 Kings]] chapter 10 all picture the people who could potentially survive Armageddon and receive everlasting human life on earth if they became Jehovah's Witnesses before it began.&lt;ref name="Penton 1997 72"&gt;{{harvnb|Penton|1997|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society|1959|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, Rutherford objected to U.S. state laws requiring school students to [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|salute the flag]] as a means of instilling patriotism; in the 1936 ''Yearbook'' he declared that baptized Jehovah's Witnesses who did [[flag salute|salute]] the [[National flag|flag]] were breaking their covenant with God and were thus "guilty of death".&lt;ref&gt;''Yearbook'', 1936, p. 22, "The saluting of or salutation to a flag means this: 'I depend on what the flag represents for my salvation. Those who know and serve God in spirit and in truth look to Jehovah God for salvation, and not to any man or any man-made organization. It therefore follows that the saluting of any flag by those who are in covenant with Jehovah God to do his will constitutes the breaking of that covenant with God, and such covenant breakers are guilty of death."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, children in 43 states were expelled for refusing to salute the flag and the Watch Tower Society took most cases to court, with Rutherford personally leading the unsuccessful case of [[Minersville School District v. Gobitis]]. Controversy over the flag salute issue escalated and mob attacks became prevalent in many U.S. states until 1943 when the court overruled its previous decision in the case of [[West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wills|2007|pp=214–224}}&lt;/ref&gt; A U.S. law magazine noted how Jehovah's Witnesses had helped shape the course of constitutional law, remarking: "Through almost constant litigation this organization had made possible an ever-increasing list of precedents concerning the application of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th amendment]] to freedom of speech and religion".&lt;ref&gt;''American Bar Association's Bill of Rights Review'', Vol 2, No.4, Summer 1942, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, Rutherford rejected the belief that Jesus had been executed on a Roman cross, in favor of an upright stake or "tree."&lt;ref&gt;''Riches'', 1936, p. 27: "Jesus was crucified, not on a cross of wood, such as is exhibited in many images and pictures, and which images are made and exhibited by men; Jesus was crucified by nailing his body to a tree."&lt;/ref&gt;

Stroup, ''The Jehovah's Witnesses'', Columbia University Press, 1945, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and a strong booming voice that helped make him a powerful orator.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Penton|1997|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wills 2007 131"&gt;{{harvnb|Wills|2007|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, ''The New York Times'' stated that Rutherford "has a reputation as an eloquent, forceful speaker".&lt;ref name=timesjudge /&gt; Watch Tower Society literature states that his personality contrasted strongly with that of his predecessor. One Witness history book says that while Russell was kind, warm and tactful, Rutherford "was warm and generous toward his associates but he was also a brusque and direct type of person, and his legal background and experiences in early life gave him a directness in his approach to problems in dealing with his brothers that caused some to take offense."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society|1959|pp=68, 69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Watch Tower Society account says he did not hide his feelings, adding, "His bluntness, even when spoken in kindness, was sometimes misunderstood."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society|1975|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow Watch Tower Society director A. H. Macmillan says Rutherford "spoke as simply and directly to the people as he knew how, and he was an extremely forthright man. He was thoroughly convinced that what he had to say was the truth and that it was a matter of life and death."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Macmillan|1957|pp=150,151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macmillan added, "He would never tolerate anything that would be contrary to what he clearly understood the Bible to teach. He was so strict about that, he would permit nothing that would seem to show a compromise when it came to an issue of the truth."&lt;ref name="Macmillan 1957 77"&gt;{{harvnb|Macmillan|1957|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author Tony Wills describes him as charitable and generous, and says his sympathy for the poor and oppressed was exceeded only by his hatred for the rich, the oppressors.&lt;ref name="Wills 2007 131"/&gt; Wills also notes that he was a dynamic, impatient [[Extraversion and introversion|extrovert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wills|2007|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors also address Rutherford's abrasiveness: James Penton describes him as blunt and moody with an explosive temper,&lt;ref&gt;P.S.L. Johnson's ''Harvest Siftings Reviewed'' (1917, p.17) relates an incident in which an enraged Rutherford rushed at him in a confrontation in Brooklyn Bethel, grabbed at his arm and "almost jerked me off my feet". Johnson complains that in an earlier hearing of complaints against him, Rutherford treated him to "sneers, sarcasm and ridicule. His face expressed more contempt than that of any other face upon which I have ever looked."(p.14)&lt;/ref&gt; with "a streak of self-righteousness which caused him to regard anyone who opposed him as of the Devil",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Penton|1997|pp=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Alan Rogerson notes that he was a "dogmatic and insensitive person, obsessed with his own self-importance."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rogerson|1969|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rutherford's confrontation with four Watch Tower Society directors who opposed him in 1917 highlighted both the forcefulness of his personality and his determination to fight for what he believed was right. Penton claims Rutherford played "hard-fisted church politics"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Penton|1997|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rogerson accuses Rutherford of using ''The Watchtower'' as a propaganda medium to attack his opposers in what was effectively a battle for his position as president.&lt;ref name="Rogerson 1969 p=37" /&gt; At the heart of his opponents' complaints was his "autocratic" behavior as he strove to "exercise complete management of the Society and its affairs."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pierson et al|1917|pp=3,4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penton similarly describes Rutherford's actions in his first year of presidency—including his appointment of new directors, refusal to allow the Society's accounts to be examined, and his unilateral decision to publish ''The Finished Mystery''—as high-handed and secretive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Penton|1997|pp=51, 53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Rutherford claimed, "It was my duty to use the power the Lord had put into my hands to support the interests of the shareholders and all others interested in the Truth throughout the world ... to be unfaithful to them would be unfaithful to the Lord."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rutherford|August 1917|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macmillan, who supported Rutherford throughout the crisis, claimed the president was extremely patient and "did everything that he could to help his opposers see their mistake, holding a number of meetings with them, trying to reason with them and show them how contrary their course was to the Society's charter".&lt;ref name="Macmillan 1957 77"/&gt;

[[File:Judge Rutherford Uncovers Fifth Column (1940) - J.F. Rutherford.jpg|thumb|left|A 1940 Rutherford booklet "exposing" a Catholic campaign of mob violence against Jehovah's Witnesses]]According to Wills, Rutherford emerged from prison in 1919 bitter against the world and the collusion he saw between the clergy and military that had secured his imprisonment. Soon after his release he coined the term "Satan's organization" to refer to this supposed conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wills|2007|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Watchtower'' articles Rutherford was similarly scathing towards [[big business]], politics and the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wills|2007|pp=131–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rogerson describes Rutherford's attitude towards the clergy—his avowed enemies—as "unadulterated hatred".&lt;ref name="Rogerson 1969 44"/&gt; His attacks on clergymen, particularly those of the [[Catholic Church]], from the late 1920s were strong enough to attract a ban on his broadcasts by the [[NBC Radio Network|NBC radio network]], which condemned his "rabid attack upon organized religion and the clergy".&lt;ref&gt;''Yearbook'', 1930, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; He also applied criticizing terms to those who had deserted Watch Tower ranks, calling them the "evil servant".&lt;ref&gt;The term was drawn from the account of the "faithful servant" and "evil servant" of Matthew 24:45–51.&lt;/ref&gt; He urged readers to view with contempt anyone who had "openly rebelled against God's order or commandments"&lt;ref&gt;''Watchtower'', February 15, 1933, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; and also described elective elders of the 1930s who refused to submit to Watch Tower Society administrative changes as "despicable".&lt;ref&gt;''Watchtower'', March 15, 1938, p.87&lt;/ref&gt;

Wills states that Rutherford seemed to relish his descriptions of how completely the wicked would be destroyed at Armageddon, dwelling at great length on prophecies of destruction. He claims that towards the close of his ministry Rutherford spent about half of each year's ''Watchtowers'' writing about Armageddon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wills|2007|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Penton, Rutherford's austerity—evidenced by his distaste for [[Christmas]], [[birthday]] parties and other popular customs&lt;ref&gt;J.F.Rutherford, ''Vindication'', Vol I, pp. 188, 189, as cited by Wills, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; that were described as of [[pagan]] origin or that encouraged [[creature worship]] and were not to be observed&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society|1975|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;—led in turn to austerity becoming a part of Witness life. In 1938, he directed that singing be dispensed with at congregation meetings;&lt;ref name="Penton 1997 66"&gt;{{harvnb|Penton|1997|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society|1959|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society|1993|p=241}}, "singing in local congregations was largely dispensed with in about 1938"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', May 1, 1938, p 139, "At all study meetings...the one presiding at the study might well, as a prelude to the meeting, briefly state God's purpose which is now being performed... two minutes might well be devoted to such at the beginning of all meetings for study [by] the one presiding... A few words like the above pronounced at the beginning of the study would be far more beneficial than to occupy the same time in singing songs, which often express much that is out of harmony with the truth"&lt;/ref&gt; singing was reinstated soon after his death.&lt;ref&gt;"Music's Place in Modern Worship", ''The Watchtower'', February 1, 1997, pp 26–27, "In 1938 singing at congregation meetings was largely dispensed with. However, the wisdom of following apostolic example and direction soon prevailed. At the 1944 district convention, F. W. Franz...announced the release of the ''Kingdom Service Song Book'' for use at the weekly service meetings."&lt;/ref&gt;

Rutherford's books and magazine articles reveal his strong views on "[[Complementarianism|the proper place of women]]" in the church and society. In a 1931 book he linked the post-1919 rise of [[feminist movement|women's movements]] that encouraged equality of the sexes with satanic influence,&lt;ref&gt;J.F.Rutherford, ''Vindication'', Vol I, pp. 155–159, as cited by Wills, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; and claimed the custom of men [[Hat tip|tipping their hats]] to women or standing when a woman approached was a scheme of the devil to turn men from God and indicated an effeminate streak in men who practiced the custom.&lt;ref name="Penton 1997 66"/&gt; [[Mother's Day]] was similarly described as part of a plan to turn people away from God.&lt;ref&gt;J.F.Rutherford, ''Vindication'', Vol I, pp. 155–157, as cited by Wills, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 he urged adherents to delay marriage and child-bearing until after Armageddon,&lt;ref&gt;''Watchtower'', November 15, 1938, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; which Wills claims prompted a strong community bias among Witnesses against marriage. Those who did marry, says Wills, were considered to be weak in faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wills|2007|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a 1941 convention in Missouri he quoted [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s description of women as "a rag and a bone and a hank of hair".&lt;ref name="Penton 1997 66"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Grizzuti Harrison]], ''Visions of Glory – A History and Memory of Jehovah's Witnesses'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1978, chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Jehovah's Witness and former [[Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses|Governing Body]] member [[Raymond Franz]] claimed there was no evidence Rutherford engaged in door-to-door ministry despite his assertion that it was a requirement and sacred duty of all Witnesses. Franz claimed to have heard Rutherford's associates say his responsibilities as president "do not permit his engaging in this activity".&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Franz, ''In Search of Christian Freedom'', Commentary Press, 2007, pp. 191–192&lt;/ref&gt; Macmillan, however, related details of Rutherford's home preaching in 1905 or 1906 when he was baptized,&lt;ref&gt;"Part 1—United States of America", ''1975 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'', 1975 Watch Tower, p 83&lt;/ref&gt; and a 1975 article quoted several Witnesses relating their experiences with Rutherford in the house-to-house ministry in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;"Part 2—United States of America", ''1975 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'', 1975 Watch Tower, p 133&lt;/ref&gt; The official history of Jehovah's Witnesses also notes, "Rutherford personally shared with other conventioners as they engaged in the work of Kingdom proclamation from house to house."&lt;ref&gt;"Conventions Proof of Our Brotherhood", ''Jehovah's Witnesses – Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'', 1993 Watch Tower, p 260&lt;/ref&gt;  On August 2, 1928 in a meeting with the Bible Student elders who had attended a general convention in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] Rutherford listed his responsibilities and concluded "when I have attended to many other details, I have not had very much time to go from door to door."&lt;ref&gt;''The Messenger'', August 3, 1928 p. 5: "Frequently some elder says: "The president of the Society does not go from house to house selling books. Why should I?" ... When I have looked after the management of the work at headquarters with its many departments; when I have given attention to a voluminous mail; when I have managed thirty odd branch offices in different parts of the earth and kept in close touch with them by correspondence and examination of their reports, and given advice and counsel as to what shall be done; when I have given attention to may {{sic}} legal matters that have arisen against members of the Society by reason of the opposition of the enemy; when I have given counsel to the various parts of the radio work; when I have prepared copy for The Watch Tower and other publications; and occasionally written a book or booklet and followed its progress through the manufacturing thereof; and when I have attended to many other details, I have not had very much time to go from door to door."&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors William Whalen and James Penton have claimed that Rutherford was to Russell what [[Brigham Young]] was to [[Mormon]] prophet [[Joseph Smith]]. Penton contends that both Russell and Smith were capable religious leaders but naive visionaries, while Rutherford and Young were "hard-bitten pragmatists who gave a degree of permanency to the movements they dominated".&lt;ref name="brigham"&gt;Prof. William J. Whalen, ''Armageddon Around the Corner: A report on Jehovah's Witnesses'', John Day, New York, 1962, page 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Penton|1997|pp=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

[[File:Beth Sarim Outside Stairs.jpg|right|thumb|[[Beth Sarim]] was built in San Diego, California in 1929. Rutherford died at the property in 1942.]]Rutherford married Mary Malcolm Fetzer of Boonville, Missouri on December 31, 1891. Their only child, Malcolm Cleveland, was born on November 10, 1892.&lt;ref&gt;''St. Paul Enterprise'' January 16, 1917 p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The couple separated after Joseph Rutherford became president of the Watch Tower Society.&lt;ref name="Penton 1997 72"/&gt; Mary remained an active member of the Jehovah's Witnesses until becoming confined to her home in the years before her death in 1962 at age 93.&lt;ref name=advertise89&gt;"Advertise the King and the Kingdom! (1919–1941)", ''Jehovah's Witnesses – Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'', 1993 Watch Tower, p 89&lt;/ref&gt;

Rutherford had reportedly lost the use of one lung from [[pneumonia]] suffered during his imprisonment in 1918 and 1919; finding New York's winter weather "impossible", Rutherford was encouraged by a doctor to "spend as much time as possible" in a more favorable climate.&lt;ref&gt;"Advertise the King and the Kingdom! (1919–1941)", ''Jehovah's Witnesses – Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'', 1993 Watch Tower, p 75&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, a residence named ''[[Beth Sarim]]'' (literally, ''House of Princes'') was constructed at [[San Diego, California]] for Rutherford's use,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|journal=The Messenger|title=Beth-Sarim – Much Talked About House|publisher=Watchtower|date=July 25, 1931|url=http://www.strictlygenteel.co.uk/tracts/1931_Messenger.pdf|pages=6, 8|postscript=.}} (17MB)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''1975 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'', 1974 Watch Tower, p 194, "In time, a direct contribution was made for the purpose of constructing a house in San Diego for Brother Rutherford's use."&lt;/ref&gt; initially as winter accommodation and later as a full-time residence.&lt;ref name=advertise89 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New York Times ''Deeds San Diego Home To Kings of Israel; Judge Rutherford in the Interim Occupies the House and Drives the Cars'' March 19, 1930 p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; He died at the property in 1942. The villa was sold in 1948, with ''The Watchtower'' declaring, "It had fully served its purpose and was now only serving as a monument quite expensive to keep."&lt;ref&gt;''Watchtower'', December 15, 1947, as cited by ''Proclaimers'', 1993, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard of Rutherford's accommodation and his personal conduct attracted criticism from some Bible Students and Jehovah's Witnesses in the 1930s. Walter F. Salter, the Society's former branch manager in Canada, wrote a public letter to Rutherford in 1937, the month he was expelled from the group, claiming that Rutherford had exclusive use of "luxurious" and "expensive" residences (in Brooklyn, Staten Island, Germany, and San Diego), as well as two [[Cadillac]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Penton|1997|pp=72,73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', May 15. 1937, p 159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jehovah's Witnesses and the Third Reich'' by M. James Penton, University of Toronto Press, 2004, p 368; though Salter's letter was dated "April 1, 1937", Penton writes, "Salter had broken with the Watch Tower Society and had been excommunicated from the Witness community at the time he wrote the letter."&lt;/ref&gt; and alleged that on more than one occasion he had purchased for Rutherford cases of whiskey, brandy, beer and other liquors, and 'go from "drink to drink"'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=h61sHeXTwXcC&amp;pg=PA363 Letter to Rutherford by Walter Salter, reproduced in ''Jehovah's Witnesses and the Third Reich: sectarian politics under persecution'' by M. James Penton, University of Toronto Press, 2004, pp. 365-7.], "I, at your orders would purchase cases of whiskey at $60.00 a case, and cases of brandy and other liquors, to say nothing of untold cases of beer. A bottle or two of liquor would not do... [Rutherford] sends us out from door to door to face the enemy while he goes from 'drink to drink,' and tells us if we don't we are going to be destroyed."&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1939 [[Olin R. Moyle]], legal counsel for the Society, wrote an open letter of resignation to the president, in which he complained about behavior of some members of the Watch Tower Society, including Rutherford himself, that he considered excessive and inappropriate. Moyle mentioned California when discussing "the difference between the accommodations furnished to you, and your personal attendants, compared with those furnished to some of your brethren." Moyle also accused Rutherford of "unkind treatment of the staff, outbursts of anger, discrimination and vulgar language" and condemned his allowing the "glorification of alcohol" at Bethel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.watchthetower.net/olin.html Moyle letter to Rutherford, July 21, 1939.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=A People For His Name: A History of Jehovah's Witnesses and an Evaluation|author=Tony Wills|pages=202–204|publisher=Lulu.com|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iTt2EphfPr8C&amp;pg=PA181 | isbn=978-1-4303-0100-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Society directors defended Rutherford in an October 1939 ''Watchtower'' article, accusing Moyle of lies and "wicked slander" and claimed he was a "Judas" trying to cause division. Moyle successfully sued the board of directors for libel, collecting $15,000 plus court costs. See Penton, pp. 80–83 and Wills, pp. 202–205.&lt;/ref&gt; Penton notes that Moyle was a "teetotaller" and "puritanical", but claims Rutherford's drinking habits were "notorious" and cites unnamed former Brooklyn Bethel workers who told of occasional difficulties in getting Rutherford to the podium to give public talks due to inebriation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Penton|1997|pp=72,73}}: "Although Jehovah's Witnesses have done everything possible to hide accounts of the judge's drinking habits, they are simply too notorious to be denied. Former workers at the Watch Tower's New York headquarters recount tales of his inebriation and drunken stupors. Others tell stories of how difficult it sometimes was to get him to the podium to give talks at conventions because of his drunkenness. In San Diego, California, where he spent his winters from 1930 until his death, an elderly lady still speaks of how she sold him great quantities of liquor when he came to purchase medicines in her husband's drugstore."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and burial==
From the age of 70, Rutherford underwent several medical treatments for [[cancer of the colon]].&lt;ref name="Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society 1993 89"&gt;{{harvnb|Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society|1993|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included an operation on November 5, 1941, which found "carcinoma of the rectal sigmoid". Doctors gave him less than six months to live.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Rutherford died at Beth Sarim on January 8, 1942 at the age of 72.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rogerson |first = Alan| title = Millions Now Living Will Never Die: A Study of Jehovah's Witnesses | publisher = Constable &amp; Co, London| year = 1969 |pages = 64| isbn = 0094559406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cause of death was "[[Uremia|uraemia]] due to carcinoma of the rectum due to pelvic metastasis."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A Watch Tower Society staff member said of the announcement of Rutherford's death, "It was at noontime when the family was assembled for lunch. ... The announcement was brief. There were no speeches. No one took the day off to mourn. Rather, we went back to the factory and worked harder than ever."&lt;ref name="Watch Tower Bible &amp; Tract Society 1993 89"/&gt;

Rutherford's burial was delayed for five months&lt;ref name="brigham" /&gt; due to legal proceedings arising from his desire to be buried at Beth Sarim, which he had previously expressed to three close advisers from Brooklyn headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Jehovah's Witnesses – Proclaimers of God's Kingdom|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|newspaper=The Evening Independent (St Petersburg, Florida)|date=January 26, 1942|title=Witnesses Ask Right To Bury Leader|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Zb4LAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KlUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2083%2C1777860|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Consolation'', "Judge Rutherford looked for the early triumph of 'the King of the East', Christ Jesus, now leading the host of heaven, and he desired to be buried at dawn facing the rising sun, in an isolated part of the ground which would be administered by the princes, who should return from their graves."&lt;ref&gt;''Consolation'', May 27, 1942.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on his claims that resurrected biblical characters would live at Beth Sarim, Rutherford concluded that it was appropriate that his bones be buried on the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|journal=Consolation|date=May 27, 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal problem arose because [[Beth Sarim]] was not a legally zoned [[cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Penton|1997|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses collected more than 14,000 signatures for two petitions—one supporting his burial at Beth Sarim, another for a second preferred site on a nearby Watch Tower Society property named Beth-Shan—that Rutherford's dying wish might be granted.&lt;ref&gt;"San Diego officials line up against New Earth's princes", ''Consolation'', May 27, 1942, pp. 6,9&lt;/ref&gt; ''Consolation'' condemned San Diego County officials for their refusal to grant a permit for Rutherford's burial at either property, stating "It was not the fate of the bones which they decided, but their own destiny. Nor is their blood on anyone else's head, because they were told three times that to fight against God, or to tamper with His servant's bones even, would bring upon them the condemnation of the Lord. ... So their responsibility is fixed, and they followed the course of Satan."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|newspaper=San Diego Union|title=No Will Left By Rutherford, Says Secretary|date=February 18, 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.seanet.com/~raines/bethshan.html |title=Beth Shan—The Watchtower's "House of Security" |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002170539/http://www.seanet.com/~raines/bethshan.html |archivedate=October 2, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.equipresources.org/atf/cf/%7B9C4EE03A-F988-4091-84BD-F8E70A3B0215%7D/DJ566.pdf|title=Beth Shan and the Return of the Princes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early life===
José Ramón Machado was born in [[San Antonio de las Vueltas]], in the former province of [[Las Villas (Cuba)|Las Villas]], and was schooled in [[Camajuaní]] and [[Remedios, Cuba|Remedios]].&lt;ref name=gadcuba&gt;{{cite web|title=Los Culpables de Cuba: La Elite de Poder (Cuba's Guilty: The Powerful Elite)|url=http://gadcuba.org/Los%20Culpables/Elite%20del%20Poder.htm|publisher=Gadcuba.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040921194121/http://gadcuba.org/Los%20Culpables/Elite%20del%20Poder.htm|archivedate=2004-09-21 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a  medical doctor by profession, graduating from the [[University of Havana]] in 1953. Machado joined the [[Cuban Revolution|revolutionary movement]] immediately following [[Fulgencio Batista]]'s [[coup d'état]] of 10 March 1952, while still a medical student, and was an early member of the [[26th of July Movement]] opposing the dictatorship. Later, under the command first of [[Che Guevara|Ernesto "Che" Guevara]] and subsequently of [[Fidel Castro]], he was one the original revolutionaries who fought the guerrilla war in the [[Sierra Maestra]]. In 1958, promoted to the rank of captain, he was sent to the province of [[Oriente Province|Oriente]] under the command of Raúl Castro as part of the rebels' bid to open up a second front. There he was placed in charge of the guerrillas' medical service, establishing a network of hospitals and dispensaries, and was promoted to the rank of major "''comandante''" (top rank on Castro's rebel army).&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elegido José Ramón Machado Ventura primer vicepresidente cubano (José Ramón Machado Ventura Chosen as First Cuban Vice President)|url=http://www.prensalatina.com.mx/article.asp?ID=%7B057B757E-6425-4EAE-9357-2773D79E44D1%7D|publisher=Prensa Latina|language=Spanish}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He remained in Matanzas until mid-1971; his administration of the province's economy and health sector was successful, particularly in terms of crop outputs, public transport and reduced infant mortality.&lt;ref name=gadcuba/&gt; Upon leaving Matanzas in 1971, he was appointed first secretary of the [[Cuban Communist Party]] in the [[Havana Province|province of Havana]] and was elected to the Politburo in December 1975.

'''José de Armendáriz y Perurena, 1st Marquis of Castelfuerte''' (sometimes ''marqués de Castel-Fuerte'') (? in [[Ribaforada]], [[Navarre]] – 1740 in probably in [[Madrid]]) was a Spanish soldier and colonial administrator. From May 14, 1724 to February 4, 1736 he was viceroy of [[Peru]].

==Early career==
He entered the military and fought in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], on the side of [[Philip V of Spain]]. He saw action in the campaigns in [[Naples]], [[Sardinia]], [[Roussillon|Rosellón]] and [[Catalonia]], and in the siege of [[Gibraltar]]. Philip granted him the title of marquess of Castelfuerte on June 5, 1711. He was governor of [[Tarragona]] and [[Captain General|captain general]] of [[Guipúzcoa]]. He was appointed a member of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] in 1737 on his return to Spain, and was also awarded the [[Order of Santiago]].&lt;sup&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060812111210/http://www.somosprimos.com/spsep02.htm]&lt;/sup&gt;

==As viceroy of Peru==
In 1723 Philip named him viceroy of Peru, a position which he took up in May of the following year. His term in office was distinguished by a campaign against fraud and corruption in the government, and reform of the royal treasury and tax collection. He took steps to strengthen the ''[[Mita (Inca)|mita]]'', the forced labor of Indigenous in the silver mines, and thus to stimulate the production of the metal. He sent to jail the Count of San Juan de Lurigancho, director of the mint, as well as the assayer, for producing false coins. In order to fight smuggling (especially of silver), he reorganized the navy and fortified the coasts.

He reestablished the system whereby Inca nobles who could prove their ancestry were recognized as [[Hidalgo (Spanish nobility)|hijosdalgo]]s of Castile. This led to a frenzy on the part of the Indigenous nobility to legitimate their status.

In 1724 society in Lima discovered an exotic drink &amp;mdash; coffee. One patron commented, "The new drink is as bitter as the new viceroy".

==The Comunero Revolt in Paraguay==
During this time the [[Revolt of the Comuneros (Paraguay)|Comunero Revolt]] broke out in Paraguay. The governor of Paraguay, [[Diego de los Reyes Balmaseda]], was an unpopular supporter of the [[Jesuit]]s. A predecessor of Viceroy Armendáriz, [[Carmine Nicolao Caracciolo]], sent an inspector there in 1721 to look into the matter. The inspector was [[José de Antequera y Castro]]. Antequera, however, gained the support of the comuneros, challenged royal authority, imprisoned Reyes Balmaceda and expelled the [[Jesuit]]s. (The Jesuits were unpopular because they sheltered many Indians from forced labor.) Antequera defeated a royalist force from [[Buenos Aires]] under García Ros.

In 1724, Armendáriz, now the viceroy in Lima, ordered Buenos Aires governor [[Bruno Mauricio de Zabala]] to suppress the rebellion and send Antequera to Lima for trial. Antequera's followers deserted him, and he was forced to flee to a convent in Cordóba in March 1725. He was arrested at [[Chuquisaca Department|Chuquisaca]] in Charcas, and taken to Lima. He was eventually brought to trial, and in 1731 he was beheaded. However another revolt broke out in Paraguay in 1730, under [[Fernando Mompó de Zayas]]. Mompó asserted the sovereignty of the people over the king.

Armendáriz faced other rebellions as well. The first uprising of the [[Chiriguano]]s, led by Aruma, occurred in 1727. In 1730 there was an insurrection in [[Oropesa, Perú|Oropesa]], led by the Mestizo [[Alejo Calatayud]].&lt;sup&gt;[http://perso.wanadoo.es/remilitari/cronolog/hispamerica.htm]&lt;/sup&gt;

==End of his term==
In 1736 Armendáriz turned over the office to his successor, [[José Antonio de Mendoza, 3rd Marquis of Villagarcía]]. The ex-viceroy returned to Spain, became captain of the king's guard, and was elected a [[Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece]] in 1737. He died in 1740 without descendants.

'''''Les Démoniaques''''' (English title: ''Demoniacs'') is a 1974 film directed by [[Jean Rollin]], about a group of shipwrecked sailors who rape two young women, who re-emerge and make a pact with the devil to get their revenge.

==Plot==
At the end of the 19th century, on the north European coasts, live three [[Wrecking (shipwreck)|shipwreckers]] simply nicknamed the "wreckers".  

The Captain is their leader, followed by Le Bosco, Paul and the beautiful but perverted Tina.

When two young women accidentally stumble upon these wreckers, they brutally and violently rape them. The next day, the Captain thinks that he is going insane when he sees the women's dead bodies. He wrecks a tavern and gets into a fight with Le Bosco. The Captain, Tina, Le Bosco and Paul go back to the wreck to kill the women, who manage to escape. Wandering around, the women come across a clown who looks after them. The women are unable to speak, but a man tells them he can help them. They communicate via a drawing and the man realises that they want revenge. The women are the only ones who can free the devil from being imprisoned in the ruins of an old castle; by making love to each of them, he will give them the power to get their revenge. The women, now the "démoniaques", return for their revenge. At the beach, they are again attacked by the Captain and Le Bosco, who tie them to the wreck. The Captain goes mad and kills Tina and Le Bosco. He realises that what he has done is wrong, but is unable to save them, and the tide comes in and they all drown.

==Career==
After graduating, Gelobter worked for the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|House of Representatives' Energy and Commerce Committee]], chaired by [[John Dingell]], and then served in the government of the [[New York City|City of New York]] under Mayor [[David Dinkins]] as Director of [[New York City Department of Environmental Protection|Environmental Quality]].&lt;ref name=LeanBio2016/&gt; He then became founding Director of the Environmental Policy Program at [[School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University|Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs]], where he was appointed an assistant professor.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Michel|first1=Gelobter|title=The Meaning of Urban Environmental Justice|journal=Fordham Urban Law Journal|date=1993|volume=21|issue=3|url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/ulj/vol21/iss3/19/|language=en}}. See author titles.&lt;/ref&gt; Next, he became a professor in the public administration department at [[Rutgers University]].&lt;ref name=NYT2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2007/&gt;

In 2001 he moved back to California and became executive director of an environmental [[think tank]] called Redefining Progress.&lt;ref name=LeanBio2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2007&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Alex|title=Buying Into the Green Movement|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/01/fashion/01green.html|work=The New York Times|date=1 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of that organization he advocated for California to adopt strong regulation of [[greenhouse gases]] through [[market mechanism]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Redefining Progress Urges Policymakers to Use Market Incentives to Promote Sustainability|url=http://www.planningreport.com/2006/05/17/redefining-progress-urges-policymakers-use-market-incentives-promote-sustainability|publisher=The Planning Report|date=May 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contributed to the passing of the [[Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006]].&lt;ref name=LeanBio2016/&gt;

===Advocacy===
Gelobter has urged others to start businesses in the [[clean technology]] sector, in order to create, develop, and validate successful business models. He argues that clean technology companies survive by providing services to companies in the rest of the economy, and if a clean technology company is making money, it does so by helping other kinds of companies make more money as well – in other words, it uses sound environmental practices that are also economically sound and sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hirsch|first1=Jennifer|title=Three Big Ideas from the Garrison Institute’s Climate, Mind and Behavior Symposium|url=http://www.climateaccess.org/blog/three-big-ideas-garrison|work=Climate Access|date=August 6, 2013|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gelobter|first1=Michel|title=Presentation: Why Making the Road by Walking It Doesn’t Work in Business|url=https://www.garrisoninstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Michel-Gelobter-Why-Making-the-Road-by-Walking-It-Doesn%E2%80%99t-Work-in-Business-CMB-2013.pdf|publisher=The Garrison Institute|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gelobter and eight other authors with an [[environmental justice]] perspective responded to the 2005 essay, ''The Death of Environmentalism: Global Warming Politics in a Post-Environmental World,'' by [[Michael Shellenberger]] and [[Ted Nordhaus]] – which asserted that the environmental movement is unable to fully address climate change – with the essay, ''The Soul of Environmentalism: Rediscovering transformational politics in the 21st century''. They argued that Shellenberger and Nordhaus had not addressed the concerns of the non-white poor, and that the environmental movement could be strengthened by allying with [[social justice]] and [[civil rights]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Garofoli|first1=Joe|title=New life through 'Death' / Authors shake up environmentalism with essay on movement's fatal flaws|url=http://www.sfgate.com/politics/joegarofoli/article/EAST-BAY-New-life-through-Death-Authors-2678056.php|work=SFGate|date=April 23, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cox&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cox|first1=Robert|title=Environmental Communication and the Public Sphere|date=2010|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781412972116|page=288|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T212jYziosUC&amp;pg=PA288|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Soul2005&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gelobter|first1=Michel|last2=Dorsey|first2=Michael|last3=Fields|first3=Leslie|last4=Goldtooth|first4=Tom|last5=Mendiratta|first5=Anuja|last6=Moore|first6=Richard|last7=Morello-Frosch|first7=Rachel|last8=Shepard|first8=Peggy M.|last9=Torres|first9=Gerald|title=The Soul of Environmentalism Rediscovering transformational politics in the 21st century|url=http://grist.org/comments/soapbox/2005/05/27/gelobter-soul/index1.html|publisher=Grist|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050711000747/http://grist.org/comments/soapbox/2005/05/27/gelobter-soul/index1.html|archivedate=11 July 2005|date=27 May 2005|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kimball's first feature film, ''Eternal Kiss'', was released in 2010 and screened at the Atlantic Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =MacDonald | first =Ron Foley | title =Eternal Kiss: World Premiere | publisher =InfoMonkey | date =April 4, 2010 | url =http://halifax.infomonkey.net/nova.scotia.news.events.php?e=world-premiere-of-eternal-kiss | accessdate =2013-08-28 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131104063642/http://halifax.infomonkey.net/nova.scotia.news.events.php?e=world-premiere-of-eternal-kiss | archivedate =November 4, 2013 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; His second feature film, the supernatural thriller ''The Cuckoo and the Clock'', and his third feature ''Roundabout'' were released in 2014.

===Theater===
In 2007 Kimball adapted and directed a version of the [[Peter Weiss]] play ''Marat / Sade''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =MacDonald | first =Ron Foley | title =A 21st Century Marat | publisher =InfoMonkey | year =2007 | url =http://halifax.infomonkey.net/nova.scotia.news.events.php?e=theatre-de-boheme | accessdate =2013-08-27 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131104064815/http://halifax.infomonkey.net/nova.scotia.news.events.php?e=theatre-de-boheme | archivedate =2013-11-04 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kimball followed ''Marat / Sade'' later in the year with the science fiction play ''Doing Time'', which he co-wrote with American author [[Mac Tonnies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Walker | first =Rob | title =Cyberspace When You're Dead | publisher =New York Times Magazine | year =2011| url =https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/magazine/09Immortality-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 | accessdate =2013-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It premiered in November in Halifax, Nova Scotia to positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =MacDonald | first =Ron Foley | title =Doing Time A Breath Of Fresh Air| publisher =InfoMonkey | year =2007| url =http://halifax.infomonkey.net/blog.details.php?post_id=1491 | accessdate =2013-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Watson | first =Kate | title =Make Time For A Great Play| publisher =The Coast | year =2007| url =http://redstarfilms.blogspot.ca/2007/11/doing-time-coast-review.html | accessdate =2013-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kimball also directed ''Doing Time'' at the 2008 Boulder International Fringe Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Doing Time | publisher =Boulder International Fringe Festival | year =2008| url =http://www.boulderfringe.com/programs/2008/theater-2008/semaphore-theatre-company/ | accessdate =2013-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
In June 2016, Kimball announced he was attempting to enter provincial politics by seeking the [[Progressive Conservative Association of Nova Scotia|Progressive Conservative]] nomination in the riding of [[Halifax Needham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/1376539-ex-rcmp-filmmaker-seek-tory-nomination|title=Ex-RCMP, filmmaker seek Tory nomination|work=The Chronicle Herald|date=June 29, 2016|accessdate=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, he lost the nomination, finishing third on the first ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/metro/1381987-arsenault-wins-tory-nod-for-halifax-needham|title=Arsenault wins Tory nod for Halifax Needham|work=The Chronicle Herald|date=July 20, 2016|accessdate=2016-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016, Kimball was nominated as the Progressive Conservative candidate in [[Clayton Park West]] for the [[Nova Scotia general election, 2017|2017 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/1405880-filmmaker-picked-by-pcs-takes-aim-at-liberals|title=Filmmaker picked by PCs, takes aim at Liberals|work=The Chronicle Herald|date=October 14, 2016|accessdate=2016-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On election night, Kimball finished second with 26% of the vote to Liberal candidate [[Rafah DiCostanzo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/election-elected-mla-riding-electoral-district-halifax-1.4135129|title=Who won in your riding? See the list of elected MLAs|publisher=CBC News|date=May 30, 2017|accessdate=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paranormal research==
A number of Kimball's documentaries have dealt with [[paranormal]] themes, including the UFO phenomenon, [[ghosts]], and [[cryptozoology]]. Since 2005 he has maintained a blog about various paranormal subjects called The Other Side of Truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =The Other Side of Truth blog | publisher =Paul Kimball | date =| url =http://redstarfilms.blogspot.com | accessdate =2013-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first book, ''The Other Side of Truth: The Paranormal, The Art of the Imagination, and The Human Condition'', was published in October 2012, by Redstar Books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Kimball | first =Paul | title =The Other Side of Truth: The Paranormal, The Art of the Imagination, and The Human Condition | publisher =Redstar Books | date =| url =https://www.amazon.com/The-Other-Side-Truth-Imagination/dp/0991697502/ | accessdate =2013-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kimball is the nephew of prominent [[ufologist]] [[Stanton Friedman]], but is skeptical of extraterrestrial visitation as an explanation for the UFO phenomenon, and is a vocal critic of the [[Exopolitics]] movement, a stance which has generated controversy among believers in the [[Extraterrestrial hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Heath | first =Gord | title =Paul Hellyer and the Politics of Exopolitics | publisher =UFOBC | year =2005| url =http://www.ufobc.ca/Beyond/exopolitics.htm | accessdate =2013-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kimball posits that the paranormal could be our interaction with an advanced non-human intelligence who may be pulling things out of our own minds and presenting it back to us in ways that we will understand. This accounts for why tales of the paranormal have changed over various eras, from dragons to spaceships. Whoever is presenting these images is trying to appeal to a particular audience in a specific time frame. He theorizes that most paranormal phenomena is a kind of artistic creation by this non-human intelligence. It may be part of a teaching or preparation process, whereby humans are encouraged to move up to the next level of development or think about things in a broader way. He has drawn links between the paranormal and various strands of [[spiritualism]] and [[mysticism]], including the experiences of [[Jakob Böhme]], [[William Blake]] and [[Henry Alline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Paranormal Interactions | publisher =Coast to Coast AM | date =January 21, 2013| url =http://www.coasttocoastam.com/show/2013/01/21 | accessdate =2013-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, Paul. ''The Other Side of Truth: The Paranormal, The Art of the Imagination, and The Human Condition''. Halifax: Redstar Books, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kimball also hosts a podcast called ''The Other Side of Truth'', where he has interviewed a wide range of people primarily about [[paranormal]]-themed subjects, including UFO researchers [[Kevin Randle]], [[Nick Pope (journalist)|Nick Pope]], and [[Stanton Friedman]], historian and author Aaron John Gulyas, filmmaker [[Paul Davids]], and scientist and consciousness researcher [[Dean Radin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =The Other Side of Truth | publisher =Kimball Media | date =| url =http://redstarfilmtv.com/radio/the-other-side-of-truth-podcast/ | accessdate =2013-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kimball has appeared as a guest on numerous radio programs, including ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]'' with [[George Noory]], Radio Misterioso, and Binnall of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Paul Kimball - Biography | publisher =Coast to Coast AM | date =| url =http://www.coasttocoastam.com/guest/kimball-paul/6415 | accessdate =2013-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a former co-host of the syndicated radio program [[The Paracast]].

'''Prudence Anne Villiers Farrow Bruns''' (born January 20, 1948) is an American author, meditation teacher, and [[film producer]]. She is the daughter of [[film director]] [[John Farrow]] and actress [[Maureen O'Sullivan]] and younger sister of actress [[Mia Farrow]].&lt;ref name="Pop History"/&gt; She is the subject of the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] song "[[Dear Prudence]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pophistorydig.com/?tag=beatles-prudence-farrow|title= Dear Prudence, 1967-1968|first=Jack|last=Doyle|publisher=PopHistoryDig.com|date=July 27, 2009|accessdate=May 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Farrow was raised in the [[Catholic]] faith and attended [[convent]] schools. She learned the [[Transcendental Meditation technique]] (TM) in 1966 at [[UCLA]] and next year became interested in [[yoga]], opening a yoga institute at a former church in [[Boston]].&lt;ref name=NFDN&gt;{{cite news|title=`Dear Prudence' living, teaching TM in Walton|work=Northwest Florida Daily News|location=Fort Walton Beach, Fla.|date= October 25, 1992|page=1C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work= The Sydney Morning Herald |date=November 9, 1967 |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RZUpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OOcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1360,2696923&amp;dq=prudence+farrow&amp;hl=en|department=Women's Section |page=8 |title= Art and fashion on show}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Girl"&gt;{{cite news|title=Girl Defects From Convent|date=October 24, 1967|author=Associated Press|work=Gettysburg Times|page=5|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=q2wmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lP8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=902,610517&amp;dq=prudence+farrow&amp;hl=en }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 Farrow, along with her sister Mia and brother Patrick, traveled with [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] from [[New York City|New York]] to [[India]],&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Jonathan (2007) Harmony Books, ''Can't Buy Me Love: The Beatles, Britain, and America'', {{ISBN|978-0-307-35337-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then to the Maharishi's ashram in [[Rishikesh]] for a Transcendental Meditation teacher training course.&lt;ref name="Pop History"&gt;"Although the Beatles left the retreat before the course on transcendental meditation was finished, Prudence Farrow, Mike Love of the Beach Boys, and others stayed on and became TM teachers"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Beatles at Rishikesh|The Beatles arrived]] shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;The Ultimate Beatles Quiz Book, Michael Hockinson, page 128, St. Martins Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Farrow was dedicated to practicing the TM technique so she could become a TM teacher. She said: "I would always rush straight back to my room after lectures and meals so I could meditate. [[John Lennon|John]], [[George Harrison|George]] and [[Paul McCartney|Paul]] would all want to sit around jamming and having a good time and I'd be flying into my room. They were all serious about what they were doing, but they just weren't as fanatical as me".&lt;ref name="Pop History"/&gt; She "turned into a near recluse" and "rarely came out" of her cottage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NOT TUNED IN: Farrow tells story of `Dear Prudence' Sister meditated 23 hours a day, oblivious to song written for her|first=MICHAEL|last=WARREN|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=November 5, 1995|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon was asked to "contact her and make sure she came out more often to socialize" and he wrote the song "[[Dear Prudence]]". According to Lennon,  "She'd been locked in for three weeks and was trying to reach God quicker than anyone else".&lt;ref name="Pop History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Dead"&gt;The American book of the Dead, Oliver Trager, page 90, Simon and Schuster, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pulok Chatterji''' (born 1952) is an [[India]]n [[civil servant]] who served as [[Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister of India]], Manmohan Singh, from 2011 to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2302287.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Nair appointed advisor to PM, Pulok Chatterji as Principal Secretary | date=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-07-29/india/29829000_1_pmo-ias-officer-joint-secretary | work=The Times Of India | title=Pulok Chatterji is principal secretary to PM, Nair adviser | date=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and formerly served as Executive Director to the [[World Bank]] and  Joint Secretary at the Prime Minister's Office from 2004 to 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Pulok Chatterjee, close Sonia associate, joins PMO as Principal Secy |publisher=Indian Express

He is a 1974 batch [[Indian Administrative Service]] [[Civil Services of India|officer]] from [[Uttar Pradesh]] cadre.

==Early life and education==
His late father had been Chairman of United Commercial Bank. He is an alumnus of [[St. Stephen's College, Delhi]].&lt;ref name=today&gt;
{{cite web | title = India Today High and Mighty power list 2013: Top 10 officials - | publisher= India Today | url = http://indiatoday.intoday.in/gallery/india-today-high-and-mighty-power-list-2013-the-official-top-10/1/9134.html 
|date=2013| accessdate = 2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
By 1981, he was aged 32 and Collector of Sultanpur in UP. He moved to the PMO as Deputy Secretary when [[Rajiv Gandhi]] took over as PM in 1985. He worked at the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation and as [[Officer on Special Duty (India)|Officer on Special Duty]] to [[Sonia Gandhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Profiles: Pulok Chatterjee | url = http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?234460 
|publisher=Outlook|date=April 23, 2007| accessdate = 2014-05-14  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, when [[United Progressive Alliance]] came to power, he returned to PMO serving as Joint Secretary to Government of India before being promoted as Secretary to Government of India.

In 2012, he was awarded the C.F. Andrews Distinguished Alumni Award by the St. Stephen's College, Delhi.&lt;ref name=today/&gt;

==Controversies and allegations==
File notings available with ''[[India Today]]'' show that Pulok Chatterji, a senior official in the PMO in 2007-08, was fully aware of [[A. Raja]]'s dubious decision-making in [[2G spectrum case]]. In this note, Chatterji basically agrees that spectrum can be allotted on payment of normal fees -- the existing usual fee of Rs 1,658 crore -- which is what the nine licensees forked out for a pan-Indian footprint.&lt;ref name="pilokscam"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/pulok-chatterji-tainted-by-scams/1/148554.html |title=Family Choice: Pulok Chatterji tainted by scams before taking over as principal secretary to PM|author=Sandeep Bamzai |date=19 August 2011 |work=[[India Today]] |publisher= |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Joint Secretary in the PMO, Chatterji wrote a note on December 3, 2004, favouring Kalmadi's appointment citing the host city contract and precedent of the 1982 Asian Games. Chatterji's note said Kalmadi should head the OC, but recommended caveats to address concerns raised by then sports minister Sunil Dutt.&lt;ref name="pilokscam"/&gt;

In 2013, several reports state that he was responsible for tampering of the CBI coalgate report.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In Lodi, his father, Cesare, established a successful fruit packing business under the name C. Mondavi and Sons, packing and shipping grapes to the east coast primarily for home winemaking. Mondavi graduated from [[Stanford University]] in 1937 with a degree in economics and business administration. While at Stanford he was a member of the [[Phi Sigma Kappa]] fraternity.

In 1943, Mondavi joined his father and brother [[Peter Mondavi|Peter]] after the family acquired the [[Charles Krug]] Winery located in [[St. Helena, California]] from James Moffitt.
In 1965, Robert Mondavi left the family winery after a feud with his younger brother [[Peter Mondavi|Peter]] over the business direction of the Krug Winery. Subsequently, Mondavi started his own winery in [[Oakville, California]], and set out to create wines that could compete with fine French wines

In 1966, he founded the Robert Mondavi Winery with his sons Michael and Tim Mondavi in the Napa Valley with the goal of producing wines that would compete with the finest wines from Europe. Michael Mondavi, the eldest, was in charge of the sales and marketing for Robert, while Tim was the winemaker.  Robert Mondavi was the first major winery built in Napa Valley in the post-Prohibition era. Part of Mondavi's original vineyard land included the ''To Kalon'' (a Greek term meaning "the beautiful") vineyard originally established by Napa Valley pioneer H.W. Crabb in 1868. The winery bearing Mondavi's name produced high quality wine in the [[California mission]] style.

==Family==
In 1937, Mondavi married his high school sweetheart, Marjorie Ellen (Declusin) Mondavi. Together, the couple had three children, Michael, Marcia, and Tim. In the late 1970s their marriage ended in a divorce. In 1980, at the age of 67, he married [[Margrit Mondavi|Margrit (Kellenberger) Biever Mondavi]], a Swiss-born, and multilingual woman who worked at the Robert Mondavi winery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prial|first=Frank|title=Robert Mondavi, Napa Wine Champion, Dies at 94|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/17/business/17mondavi.html?pagewanted=all|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert and Margrit had no children, but together they dedicated a lot of time and money to philanthropic events.

==Wine history==
[[File:Mondavi Napa Valley Chardonnay 2005.jpg|thumbnail|right|A wine from the Robert Mondavi Winery, a Napa Valley Chardonnay.]]
In 1968, Mondavi made a dry oak–aged [[Sauvignon blanc]], an unpopular variety in California at the time, and labeled it "[[Fumé Blanc]]". The wine was a success and, in time, Fumé Blanc became accepted as a synonym for Sauvignon blanc.

Mondavi successfully developed a number of premium wines that earned the respect of connoisseurs and vintners alike. In 1979, he built the Mondavi Woodbridge Winery in Lodi, California developing it into a leader of popular-premium wines. He also entered into a joint venture with [[Philippe de Rothschild|Baron Philippe de Rothschild]] of [[Château Mouton Rothschild]] to create [[Opus One Winery]], and since the 1990s has set up joint ventures with local partners in [[Europe]], [[South America]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;Julien Lefour, Comment les cépages de tradition française deviennent des vins californiens ?, Communications, n°77, 2005, 16 p. (Edgar Morin Center – EHESS/CNRS). Free downloading sur http://www.persee.fr&lt;/ref&gt;

Interested by his work and his success, in the 1990s Mondavi's story and his wine company became topics for specialists of wine. 

In the [[Grand European Jury Wine Tasting of 1997]], the Robert Mondavi Chardonnay Reserve was ranked number one.

In 2005, Robert Mondavi and his younger brother Peter made wine together for the first time after their feud. Using grapes from both family vineyards, they produced one barrel of cabernet blend, which was sold for $400,000 under the name "Ancora Una Volta" ("Once Again") at the 2005 Napa Valley Auction.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Sullivan, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/16/AR2008051603900.html "Robert Mondavi 94; Noted Vintner Who Raised Qualities of American Wine"], ''[[Washington Post]]'', May 17, 2008, p. B5.  Accessed 24 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; All the money earned from the barrel of wine went to charity.

==Legacy==
In 2003, Mondavi expressed regret and criticized his sons for the business strategy that emphasized the inexpensive Mondavi lines, Coastal and Woodbridge, over the premium wines, allowing the company name to lose its association with fine wine it held in the past. He said, "We've got to get our image back, and that's going to take time."&lt;ref name=nyt03&gt;{{cite news|author=Frank J. Prial | title= With Head Held High, Mondavi, at 90, Faces a Storm |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9506E7D9123AF931A35754C0A9659C8B63&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=mondavi+and+prial&amp;st=nyt |work=[[The New York Times]]| date= July 2, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2004 documentary film ''[[Mondovino]]'', the Mondavi family featured prominently, in close application to its theme of [[globalization]]. At the time, the Mondavis had recently acquired the Italian "[[cult wine]]" [[Ornellaia]] winery, Tenuta Dell'Ornellaia.

On December 22, 2004, [[Constellation Brands]] acquired the Mondavi winery in a controversial takeover for nearly US$1.36 billion in cash and assumption of debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2007-11-13|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/11/04/MNG3A9LLVS1.DTL|title=

The family partnership Continuum Estate is still run by Robert's son Tim, daughter Marcia and grandchildren Carissa Mondavi, Chiara Mondavi, Carlo Mondavi and Dante Mondavi. 

In 2001, Robert Mondavi donated $10 million to help with the building cost of the Robert and Margrit Mondavi Center for the Performing Arts building at [[UC Davis]].  The [[Mondavi Center]] was opened on October 3, 2002. Robert also donated $25 million to establish the Robert Mondavi Institute for Wine and Food Science and this opened a new era for UC Davis’s wine and food programs. It was the largest private contribution to UC Davis.

The two were founders and major benefactors behind the museum [[Copia (museum)|Copia]], which opened November 2001 in the city of [[Napa, California]].

Robert and Margrit were also founding supporters of the restoration of the 19th-century [[Napa Valley Opera House]] and the [[Oxbow School]], a new art school in Napa that provides grants and instruction to art students in their junior year of high school. They have contributed to the restoration of the [[Lincoln Theatre (Yountville, California)|Lincoln Theatre]] in [[Yountville, California]], and have supported the [[Cantor Arts Center]] at Stanford University in [[Palo Alto, California]].

'''Roberta Beatrice "Bertha" Boyd''' (16 June 1862 – 10 January 1944), sometimes listed as Roberta Grace, was a [[Canada|Canadian]] lighthouse keeper and [[heroine]] known as the '[[Grace Darling]] of the [[Saint Croix River (Maine – New Brunswick)|St. Croix]]'.

== Early life ==
Roberta was born on 16 June 1862 to John and Kate Boyd. Her father, John Boyd, was the keeper of the Spruce Point Light near [[St. Stephen, New Brunswick]]. Roberta and her mother would tend the light when her father was away. 

==St. Croix River rescue==

On 8 October 1882, Boyd saved two men whose [[sailing boat]] had overturned in the river, and rowed them back to shore.  For this action she was awarded a gold watch by the [[Dominion of Canada|Dominion Government]] with the words "In recognition of her humane exertions in saving life in the St. Croix River" inscribed on it; in addition, the [[Department of Marine and Fisheries]] presented her with a new boat with "Roberta Grace Boyd, Grace Darling of the Saint Croix" on the helm.

==Later life==

After her father's death on 15 September 1892,&lt;ref&gt;"John Boyd, keeper of the lower lighthouse, near the Ledge, St. Croix river, died Thursday last week from the effects of a bruise accidentally inflicted while at work with a drawing knife. Mr. Boyd was one of the most reliable pilots in the St. Andrews district and was pilot of steamer 'Stroud' while she ran on the Grand Manan route." (22 September 1892). ''St. Andrews Beacon'' (St. Andrews); &lt;/ref&gt; Boyd became keeper of the light. She served as keeper at Spruce Point until at least 1922 (when records were no longer published). 

Boyd married Herbert LeRoy Hannah on 18 October 1900 in The Ledge, [[St. Stephens Parish, New Brunswick]]. 

She died on 10 January 1944.

'''Salem al-Hazmi''' ({{lang-ar|سالم الحازمي}}, {{transl|ar|''Sālam al-Ḥāzmī''}}, also [[transliteration|transliterated]] as '''Alhazmi''') (February 2, 1981 – September 11, 2001) was [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|one of five hijackers]] of [[American Airlines Flight 77]] as part of the [[September 11 attacks]].

Hazmi had a relatively long history with [[al-Qaeda]] before being selected for the attacks. He obtained a tourist visa through the Visa Express program and arrived in the United States in June 2001 where he would settle in [[New Jersey]] with other American 77 hijackers up until the attacks.

On September 11, 2001, Hazmi boarded American Airlines Flight 77 and helped subdue the passengers and crew for [[Hani Hanjour]], the pilot among the hijackers, to crash the plane into west facade of [[the Pentagon]]. His older brother, [[Nawaf al-Hazmi]], was another hijacker aboard the same flight. At the age of 20 years and 221 days, he was the youngest hijacker who participated in the attacks.

==History==
Hazmi was born on February 2, 1981 to Muhammad Salim al-Hazmi, a grocer, in [[Mecca]], [[Saudi Arabia]]. His father described Salem as a quarrelsome teenager who had problems with alcohol and petty theft. However, he stopped drinking and began to attend the mosque about three months before he left his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report.pdf |title='&amp;#39;The 9/11 Commission Report'&amp;#39; |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are reports that he fought in [[Afghanistan]] with his brother, [[Nawaf al-Hazmi]], and other reports say the two fought together in [[Chechnya]]. Salem al-Hazmi was an [[al-Qaeda]] veteran by the time he was selected for participation in the 9/11 attacks. U.S. intelligence learned of Hazmi's involvement with [[al-Qaeda]] as early as 1999, but he was not placed on any watchlists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John J. Lumpkin |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/salem_al-hazmi.htm |title=Salem al-Hazmi |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=2004-07-22 |accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known as ''Bilal'' during the preparations,&lt;ref name="willalOmari"&gt;Videotape of recorded will of Abdulaziz al-Omari and others&lt;/ref&gt; both he and [[Ahmed al-Ghamdi]] flew to [[Beirut]] in November 2000, though on separate flights.

Along with [[Nawaf al-Hazmi]] and several other future hijackers, Salem al-Hazmi may have attended the [[2000 Al Qaeda Summit]] in [[Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia]]. It was there that the details of the 9/11 attacks were decided upon.
{{Clear}}

==In the United States==
According to the [[FBI]] and the [[9/11 Commission]] report, Hazmi first entered the United States on June 29, 2001, although there are numerous unconfirmed reports that he was living in [[San Antonio, Texas]] with fellow hijacker [[Satam al-Suqami]] much earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Hazmi moved to [[Paterson, New Jersey]] where he lived with [[Hani Hanjour]]. Both were among the five hijackers who applied for Virginia identity cards at the [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]] office of the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles on August 2, 2001, although Salem already held an NJ identity card.

On August 27, brothers Nawaf and Salem purchased flight tickets through [[Travelocity]].com using Nawaf's [[VISA|visa card]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/2002_hr/092602mueller.html |title=Statement of Robert S.

With the four other Flight 77 hijackers, he worked out at a [[Gold's Gym]] in [[Greenbelt, Maryland]] from September 2 to September 6 of the same year.

==Attacks==
{{Main|American Airlines Flight 77}}
On September 11, 2001, Hazmi boarded [[American Airlines Flight 77]].

The flight was scheduled to depart at 08:10, but ended up departing 10&amp;nbsp;minutes late from Gate&amp;nbsp;D26 at Dulles. The last normal radio communications from the aircraft to [[air traffic control]] occurred at 08:50:51.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gregor |first=Joseph A. |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/info/ATC_%20Report_AA77.pdf |format=PDF|title=ATC Report American Airlines Flight 77 |publisher=National Transportation Safety Board |date=2001-12-21 |accessdate=2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 08:54, Flight&amp;nbsp;77 began to deviate from its normal, assigned flight path and turned south, and then hijackers set the flight's [[autopilot]] heading for Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/info/autopilot_AA77_UA93_study.pdf |format=PDF|title=Study of Autopilot, Navigation Equipment, and Fuel Consumption Activity Based on United Airlines Flight&amp;nbsp;93 and American Airlines Flight&amp;nbsp;77 Digital Flight Data Recorder Information |last=O'Callaghan |first=John |author2=Bower, Daniel  |publisher=National Transportation Safety Board |date=2002-02-13 |accessdate=2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passenger [[Barbara Olson]] called her husband, [[United States Solicitor General]] [[Theodore Olson]], and reported that the plane had been hijacked and that the assailants had box cutters and knives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Glen |url=http://www.boston.com/news/packages/underattack/news/planes_reconstruction.htm |title=Probe reconstructs horror, calculated attacks on planes |work=The Boston Globe |date=2001-11-23 |accessdate=2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At 09:37, American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the west facade of [[the Pentagon]], killing all 64 aboard (including the hijackers), along with 125 on the ground in the Pentagon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/info/AAL77_fdr.pdf |format=PDF|title=American Airlines Flight 77 FDR Report |publisher=National Transportation Safety Board |date=2002-01-31 |accessdate=2008-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the recovery process at the Pentagon, remains of all five Flight&amp;nbsp;77 hijackers were identified through a process of elimination, as not matching any [[DNA]] samples for the victims, and put into custody of the FBI.

==Mistaken identity==

Shortly after the attacks, several sources reported that Salem al-Hazmi, 26, was alive and working at a petrochemical plant in Yanbu, [[Saudi Arabia]]. He claimed that his [[passport]] had been stolen by a pickpocket in [[Cairo]] three years before, and that the pictures and details such as [[date of birth]] released to the public by the FBI were his own. He also stated that he had never visited the United States, but volunteered to fly to the U.S. to prove his innocence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Muhammad Salim al-Hazmi, father of the two suspects, Nawaf and Salim Muhammad al-Hazmi, said that the published photos may be doctored or faked somehow. Hazmi continued, "As a father, I have a feeling that the two of them are still alive and unhurt, and will come back home in the near future when the truth is uncovered and the real culprits are found."{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

After some confusion and doubt [[Saudi Arabia]] admitted&lt;!--When?--&gt; that in fact the names of the [[Aircraft hijacking|hijackers]] were correct.

'''Spencer Reid''' is a fictional character from the CBS crime drama ''[[Criminal Minds]]'', portrayed by [[Matthew Gray Gubler]]. Reid is a [[genius]] with an IQ of 187 and can read 20,000 words per minute with an [[eidetic memory]] (meaning that he can remember an exceedingly large amount of information with extraordinary detail.) He is the youngest member of the [[FBI]]'s [[Behavioral Analysis Unit]] (BAU), has three BAs and three PhDs, and specializes in statistics and geographic profiling.

==Development==

Reid was born on October 12th, 1981 and is a genius and [[autodidacticism|autodidact]] who graduated from a [[Las Vegas]] public high school at age 12. He has an [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] of 187,&lt;ref name=s1e1&gt;"Extreme Aggressor", season 1, episode 1&lt;/ref&gt; an eidetic memory, and can read 20,000 [[words per minute]]&lt;ref name=s1e1/&gt; (an average American adult reads prose text at 200–300 words per minute).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettnelson/2012/06/04/do-you-read-fast-enough-to-be-successful/|title=Do You Read Fast Enough To Be Successful?|website=Forbes|access-date=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He holds B.A.s in Psychology, Sociology, and Philosophy, a Ph.D. in Chemistry and Engineering as well as a Ph.D. in [[Mathematics]] from [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]].&lt;ref name=s4e7&gt;"Memoriam", season 4, episode 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Reid is 23 in the pilot episode,&lt;ref name=s1e4&gt;"Plain Sight", season 1, episode 4&lt;/ref&gt; having joined the unit when he was 22.&lt;ref name=s4e7/&gt;&lt;ref name=s3e19&gt;"Tabula Rasa", season 3, episode 19&lt;/ref&gt; His fellow team members almost always introduce him as [[Ph.D.|Dr.]] Reid. [[Aaron Hotchner|Hotch]] reveals in the first season that [[Jason Gideon|Gideon]] insists on introducing him as Dr. Reid because Gideon fears that, because of his age, Reid will not be taken seriously as an FBI agent.&lt;ref name=s1e1/&gt; This was a genuine concern, both for in-universe and for audience acceptance, since in real life the minimum age to become an FBI [[Special Agent]] is 23,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/facts-and-figures-2010-2011/working-for-the-fbi |title=Working for the FBI |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514085516/http://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/facts-and-figures-2010-2011/working-for-the-fbi |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with at least three more years to obtain Supervisory Special Agent status, and appointments to the [[Behavioral Analysis Unit|BAU]] do not usually occur until after at least eight to ten years in the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbijobs.gov/114.asp |title=Special Agent Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702113627/http://www.fbijobs.gov/114.asp |archivedate=July 2, 2007 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While filming the pilot, the show's FBI consultant informed [[Matthew Gray Gubler]] that there was nothing realistic about his character.&lt;ref name=insidepulse060920&gt;{{cite web |url=http://primetimepulse.insidepulse.com/articles/61071/2006/09/20/matt-romanada-talks-to-icriminal-mindsi-stars-matthew-gray-gubler-and-kirsten-vangsness.html |title=Matt Romanada Talks To ''Criminal Minds'' stars Matthew Gray Gubler and Kirsten Vangsness |last=Romanada |first=Matthew |date=September 20, 2006 |website=Inside Pulse |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022032914/http://primetimepulse.insidepulse.com/articles/61071/2006/09/20/matt-romanada-talks-to-icriminal-mindsi-stars-matthew-gray-gubler-and-kirsten-vangsness.html |archivedate=October 22, 2006 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Gubler was cast in the role, the character was envisioned as more like Data from ''[[Star Trek]]''. However, the producers liked Gubler's softer interpretation, despite telling the actor he was wrong for the part. After several callbacks, he was hired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ciminal-minds-matthew-gray-gubler-168464 |title='Criminal Minds' Star Matthew Gray Gubler on Directing |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |first=Jessica |last=Gardner |date=March 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During October 2012, series creator [[Jeff Davis (writer)|Jeff Davis]] tweeted that Reid was originally envisioned to be bisexual, but the network shut the idea down by the fourth episode when Reid develops a crush on his colleague, [[Jennifer Jareau|Jennifer "JJ" Jareau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Willis |first=Jackie |date=October 26, 2012 |title='Criminal Minds' Creator: Reid Was to be Bi-Sexual |url=http://www.etonline.com/tv/126267_Criminal_Minds_Creator_Reid_Was_Supposed_to_Be_Bi_Sexual/index.html |deadurl=yes |work=[[ETonline]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028230538/http://www.etonline.com/tv/126267_Criminal_Minds_Creator_Reid_Was_Supposed_to_Be_Bi_Sexual/index.html |archivedate=October 28, 2012 |accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality==

As a common characteristic of people with [[Asperger syndrome|Asperger's syndrome]], Reid is [[socially awkward]]. Reid has a hard time dealing with his emotions. He often fixates on things (prompting Morgan and other team members to have to tell him to be quiet), and misses social cues at times (for example, unknowingly changing the subject of a conversation). The Unknown Subject ("UnSub") in "Broken Mirror"&lt;ref name=s1e5&gt;"Broken Mirror", season 1, episode 5&lt;/ref&gt; notes this, and Gubler stated in an interview in the show's second season "[Reid]'s an eccentric genius, with hints of [[schizophrenia]] and minor [[autism]], Asperger's syndrome. Reid is 24 years old with three Ph.D.s and one cannot usually achieve that without some form of autism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvdramas.about.com/od/criminalminds/a/matgraygubint.htm |title=An Interview with Matthew Gray Gubler (Dr. Spencer Reid, Criminal Minds) |last=Thomas |first=Rachel |website=[[About.com]] |accessdate=September 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer Sharon Lee Watson stated in a Twitter chat that Reid's Asperger traits make the character more lovable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cmsetreport.tumblr.com/post/34127594413/full-transcript-live-chat-with-writer-sharon-lee |title=Full Transcript – Live Chat with Writer, Sharon Lee Watson and Line Producer, Harry Bring |date=October 18, 2012 |accessdate=October 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gubler has commented on the differences between Reid and similarly odd character [[Penelope Garcia]]: "She represents everything he's not, she's very tech oriented and I would like to imagine he is more like 1920s smart, books and reading etc". [[Kirsten Vangsness]] agreed, adding that Garcia is more extroverted and available emotionally, whereas Reid struggles with his emotions.&lt;ref name=insidepulse060920/&gt; Reid is a technophobe, using neither email nor the new [[iPad]]s. Gubler tweeted that Reid is also germaphobic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/GUBLERNATION/status/3091118963 |title=GUBLERNATION |date=August 2, 2009 |accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Reid dislikes shaking hands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cmsetreport.blogspot.com/2011/12/cmsetreport-chat-transcript-for.html |title=CM_SetReport Chat Transcript for Executive Producer Janine Sherman Barrois and Matthew Gray Gubler 12/15/2011 |date=December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shows adverse reactions when touched by strangers.&lt;ref name=s4e16&gt;"Pleasure Is My Business", season 4, episode 16&lt;/ref&gt; It is speculated the character may also have slight [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], particularly from a scene in "Out of the Light"&lt;ref name=s6e22&gt;"Out of the Light", season 6, episode 22&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Derek Morgan (Criminal Minds)|Derek Morgan]] slightly moves an item in the home of an UnSub afflicted with OCD, and Reid immediately places it back to its previous spot.

Reid is a good map-reader, and therefore does the geographic profiling and map-related activities for the team. He also has a talent with words, and is the team's go-to linguistic profiler, as well as their unofficial discourse analyst. He is rarely seen behind the wheel – one time when Morgan hands him the keys, JJ and [[Emily Prentiss|Emily]] exchange horrified expressions – but in "Lo-Fi" he is seen getting into the driver's side of a vehicle and even driving that same vehicle in one scene, as well as driving to Gideon's cabin in "In Name and Blood," and in "Nelson's Sparrow." However, he is usually seen as a backseat passenger during car scenes, and he commutes to work using the Metro,&lt;ref name=s2e11&gt;"Sex, Birth, Death", season 2, episode 11&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably the [[Virginia Railway Express|VRE]].

==Storylines==

===Backstory===

Spencer Walter Reid was born in Las Vegas to William Reid ([[Taylor Nichols]]), a lawyer, and Diana Reid ([[Jane Lynch]]), a former professor of [[15th century in literature|15th century literature]]. Diana also has [[paranoid schizophrenia]], and went off her medication during her pregnancy.&lt;ref name=s4e7/&gt; Reid and his mother have a very close relationship despite her condition.

At age four, Spencer was approached by a man, Gary Michaels, while playing chess at a local park. Although Spencer was unharmed, Diana insisted the family move because she believed her son was in danger. Shortly thereafter, Spencer's six-year-old neighbor, Riley Jenkins, was sexually abused and murdered. Diana told Lou Jenkins, Riley's father, about the park incident. Diana then followed Jenkins and witnessed him beat Michaels to death with a baseball bat, getting blood on her clothes in the process. In order to protect his wife, William burned Diana's clothes, which Spencer inadvertently witnessed. Jenkins avoided arrest because Michaels "disappeared", and as he had a criminal history as a sexual predator, the police didn't look very hard into the case.&lt;ref name=s4e7/&gt; Years later, Reid starts having nightmares about the incident, initially leading him to believe his own father was Riley's killer. Rossi and Morgan help him investigate. After undergoing hypnosis to recover his memories, Reid mistakenly believes he saw his father burning Riley's clothes, not Diana's. He pursues his father as a suspect, even after it becomes clear that Michaels is the more likely perpetrator. Michaels' body is found, and DNA confirms his killer was Lou Jenkins, who is arrested. While Reid is interviewing Jenkins, demanding to know how his father was involved, his parents interrupt and confess to their son the whole story.&lt;ref name=s4e7/&gt;

At ten years old,&lt;ref&gt;"Scared to Death", season 3, episode 3&lt;/ref&gt; Reid's father abandoned the family. The Michaels incident had already started the rift, and as Diana's mental state continued to deteriorate due to her paranoid schizophrenia, William left, refusing to take Spencer with him.&lt;ref name=s2e15&gt;"Revelations", season 2, episode 15&lt;/ref&gt; He moved ten miles away, and never contacted his son. Reid finds out his father's address from Lou Jenkins seventeen years later, as well as the fact that his father never changed jobs. William later states that the reason he never returned was because he was too ashamed, and felt too much time had passed for him to re-enter Reid's life, although he did keep electronic tabs on his son.&lt;ref name=s4e7/&gt; When his father was leaving, young Spencer tried to convince him to stay by using a statistic that children of parents who remain together receive more education. This angered William: "We're not statistics."&lt;ref name=s2e15/&gt; Reid states that one way he gets back at his father is to collect more educational degrees.&lt;ref&gt;"Public Enemy", season 5, episode 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to his young age and genius IQ, Reid was a victim of severe bullying in high school. In "Elephant's Memory", he recounts one instance where he was stripped naked and tied to a goalpost in front of other students, remaining there for hours. In "L.D.S.K.", Hotchner is forced to kick Reid in order to allow him access to a gun in order to shoot a suspect. When Hotch says he is sorry if he hurt him, Reid points out that he was a child prodigy in a Las Vegas school and tells Hotch, "you kick like a nine-year-old girl". Reid's social standing as a child increased when he started winning games as the coach of his high school's basketball team, using statistics to break down the opposing teams' shooting strategies.&lt;ref name=s7e4&gt;"Painless", season 7, episode 4&lt;/ref&gt;

At age twelve, Reid graduated from high school. He attended Caltech, where he rode his bike to classes. He finished his undergraduate degree at sixteen, and received his first doctorate (in Mathematics) the following year.&lt;ref name=s4e7/&gt; It has also been stated that he attended [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], but episode writer [[Breen Frazier]] admitted the MIT line was a mistake,&lt;ref name=cmsetreport111014&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cmsetreport.blogspot.com/2011/10/cmsetreport-chat-transcript-for-breen.html |title=CM_SetReport Chat Transcript for Breen Frazier 10-13-11 |date=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it has not yet been corrected onscreen. [[Yale University]] was Reid's "safety school". Between the ages of 17 and 21, he completed two more doctorates (Chemistry and Engineering), and two more Bachelor's degrees (psychology and sociology).

When Reid was eighteen, he realized his mother's condition had deteriorated to the point where she could no longer take care of herself and had her committed involuntarily to a psychiatric institution, Bennington Sanitarium.&lt;ref name=s2e15/&gt; Diana still resides in the same institution, and Reid says that he sends her letters every day, in part because of the guilt he feels for not visiting her.&lt;ref&gt;"Fisher King (Part 1)", season 1, episode 22&lt;/ref&gt; He worries about the fact that his mother's illness can be passed on genetically; telling Morgan: "I know what it's like to be afraid of your own mind".&lt;ref name=s2e11/&gt;

Currently, Reid resides in an apartment&lt;ref&gt;"Magnum Opus", season 8, episode 13&lt;/ref&gt; in the District of Columbia, possibly near the Van Ness-UDC Metro stop.&lt;ref name=s6e16/&gt;

===Behavioral Analysis Unit===

Reid joined the FBI at either the age 21 or 22, depending upon what age he entered the FBI Academy. While there was "no psychological exam or test the FBI could put in front of him he could not ace inside of an hour",&lt;ref name=s4e7/&gt; he did struggle with the more physical aspects of training, and ultimately received waivers for those requirements.&lt;ref&gt;"What Happens At Home", season 6, episode 10&lt;/ref&gt; Even after a year in the field, Reid still struggles to pass his gun qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;"LDSK", season 1, episode 6&lt;/ref&gt; He is often left behind during takedowns, has never given chase, and jokes that it's Morgan's job to kick down the doors.&lt;ref name=s5e1&gt;"Nameless, Faceless", season 5, episode 1&lt;/ref&gt; This does not bother the team, because while he has shown an ability to physically disarm unsubs, his true talent is psychologically disarming them, as well as his abilities to solve the cases behind the scenes.

Profiling is the only profession Reid considered, and he was groomed specifically for the BAU.&lt;ref&gt;"Jones", season 2, episode 18&lt;/ref&gt; Upon graduation from the Academy, he was placed in the BAU at age 22, and given the title Supervisory Special Agent. His first case in the field was the Blue Ridge Strangler.&lt;ref name=s3e19/&gt;

Gideon is Reid's closest confidante on the team during the first two seasons, and often serves as a mentor to Reid. Gideon's departure affects Reid deeply. He tries playing all possible chess moves in order to understand.&lt;ref&gt;"Uncanny Valley", season 5, episode 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Reid is close to JJ, Morgan, and Emily Prentiss. JJ asks him to be [[godparent|godfather]] to her new born son Henry, and is the only one on the team who calls him "Spence." It is implied in "Plain Sight" that Reid may have a slight crush on JJ, and Gideon even prods him to ask out JJ after giving him [[Washington Redskins]] football tickets for his birthday, but nothing comes from it, and they continue with their brother-sister relationship. However, Reid is very protective of her, and often blames himself if she is injured; even if there was nothing he could have done to prevent it. In "Closing Time", after she arrests an unsub, but gets hurt in the process, Spencer is seen counting her injuries as she sits in the ambulance and tells the paramedic that she should be going to get a CAT scan. Reid also shares a brotherly friendship with Derek Morgan. In season seven, he is comfortable enough to start a joke war with him, something that he probably would never do with anyone else, and he occasionally confides his secrets to Morgan. It is suggested in the episode "Epilogue" that Reid told Derek details about what Tobias Hankel did to him when he makes a remark about seeing the afterlife before Tobias saved him. Morgan looks surprised and says "You never told me that." In the episode "Elephant's Memory", when approached by a fully armed Owen Savage, the unsub whom Reid identifies with, Reid gives Prentiss his gun and trusts her enough to back him up and not shoot at Owen as he tries talking Owen down. Although not shown, it is implied Reid and Prentiss spend time together outside of work heavily, along with riding the train home together when they return from cases. Prentiss is the only one who has beat Reid at poker, even correcting his statistic about her particular poker move. Reid and Prentiss are held hostage by a cult led by Benjamin Cyrus (portrayed by [[Luke Perry]]). Though he is not injured, Reid struggles with guilt over "allowing" Prentiss's beating at the hands of Cyrus in "Minimal Loss". Reid later becomes close to Alex Blake, whose forensic linguistics class he guest lectures in. Blake serves as a maternal figure within the BAU.

Reid contracts anthrax during an outbreak in [[Maryland]],&lt;ref&gt;"Amplification", season 4, episode 24&lt;/ref&gt; and is later shot in the leg protecting a doctor whose life is being threatened.&lt;ref name=s5e1/&gt;

During "Corazon", Reid begins to suffer from severe headaches and hallucinations. He goes to see a doctor in order to find out the source of his headaches, but the doctor says there is no physical cause for his headaches, and they may be psychosomatic. Reid refuses to believe this, afraid that he may be suffering from the same illness as his mother.&lt;ref&gt;"Corazon", season 6, episode 12&lt;/ref&gt; It is not mentioned again until "Coda", when he is seen once again wearing sunglasses and is carrying a book on migraines. In the same episode, Reid bonds with a young autistic boy, Sammy Sparks.&lt;ref name=s6e16&gt;"Coda", season 6, episode 16&lt;/ref&gt; A cut line from the episode has [[David Rossi|Rossi]] stating that Sammy and Reid are two of the most fascinating minds he's ever encountered.{{Citation needed |reason=This is s6e16 Coda extended promo – previously given link was copyvio video. |date=January 2015}} In the episode "Valhalla", Reid tells Prentiss about his headaches. By then, Reid has gone to several doctors, but no one has been able to diagnose what is wrong with him. He tells Prentiss that he has not told any of the team members because he is afraid that they will "make him feel like a baby."&lt;ref&gt;"Valhalla", season 6, episode 17&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Lauren", it is Reid and [[Penelope Garcia|Garcia]] who react most strongly to the news of Emily's death. Reid's reaction is to run out of the room, and he ends up sobbing into JJ's shoulder telling her that he "never got a chance to say goodbye."&lt;ref&gt;"Lauren", season 6, episode 18&lt;/ref&gt; In season seven, when Emily returns and Reid discovers Hotch and JJ faked her death, he is upset, especially with JJ. He tells her he feels betrayed because he came to her house "for 10 weeks in a row, crying over losing a friend" and "not once did you have the decency to tell me the truth." She doesn't say anything. He asks J.J. "what if" he had started using Dilaudid again after Emily "died."&lt;ref&gt;"Proof", season 7, episode 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In "True Genius", Reid doubts his reasons for being in the BAU and wonders if he should be doing more with his 'genius'. This is caused by the unsub sending him taunting messages and challenging Reid to find him. In this episode, he also reveals that the team missed his 30th birthday. At the end of the episode, the team throw him a mini birthday party.

====Drug addiction====

After being kidnapped by a serial killer with multiple personalities, Tobias Hankel ([[James Van Der Beek]]), Reid is tortured and drugged over the course of two days in [[Criminal Minds (season 2)#ep37|"Revelations"]]. This leads him to develop an addiction to the narcotic painkiller [[Dilaudid]]. While the BAU team members have their suspicions about Spencer's addiction, none of them confront him about it. An old friend of Reid's in [[New Orleans]] is also aware that Reid suffers from 'problems' in "Jones".

Reid gets clean and attends a support group meeting for addicts in law enforcement in "Elephant's Memory", at which he admits struggling with cravings as well as with traumatic memories, including a young adult suspect's shooting death in his presence. When he contracts [[anthrax]] in "Amplification", he strictly refused to take any narcotic painkillers in an attempt to remain clean. Memories of his torture under Hankel later allow him to empathize with other victims.

====Personal life====

Throughout the show, Reid shows a lack of interest when interacting with women. The only three exceptions are Lila Archer, a young actress he is assigned to protect; Austin ([[Courtney Ford]]), a bartender he "woos" with magic tricks while showing her a sketch of a potential suspect; and Maeve, a geneticist he first meets through correspondence, then later weekly phone calls. In "Memoriam", a prostitute hits on Reid in a Las Vegas casino, but he is oblivious to her intentions.

In "Somebody's Watching", with the team on a case to protect a TV starlet, Reid saves Lila Archer ([[Amber Heard]]) from being harmed by a serial killer. Reid and Lila kindle a short-lived romance, beginning when Lila pulls Reid, fully clothed, into her pool for a kiss. At the end of the episode, they go their separate ways, and Lila is not seen in further episodes.

In another episode, Reid and Morgan are in a nightclub trying to find a serial murderer who picks up women in nightclubs. Reid is having trouble talking to the women in these clubs, especially since he is spouting facts about club-related deaths, but Morgan helps him out. Reid starts a conversation with the female bartender, and proceeds to do a magic trick in which he appears to jab a pen through the eye of a police sketch, but pulls it through, leaving the paper unscathed. She expresses interest in him, and he gives her his business card in case she hears something about the killer. Later, she sees the killer with another potential victim and intentionally spills her drink on the lady, pulling her away. The killer seems to disappear, and while the bartender goes outside to phone Reid, he grabs her. The team responds quickly and saves her before she is harmed. At the end of the episode, she and Reid are talking over the phone, and he opens a package at his desk that contains the card that he gave her—with a lipstick kiss on the back.

In "God Complex", Reid begins calling a mystery woman on a pay phone and they talk about his progress with his headaches and sleep deprivation. It is revealed that she is in danger and doesn't want someone to know about her and Reid. While on a case in New Mexico, Alex Blake drops Reid off at a phone booth, unaware that he is going to call the mystery woman. Blake later returns and questions his motives. The two agents have a heated discussion, and he tells her the mystery woman is a geneticist he contacted about his headaches during season six, whom he believes can help on the case. Thanks to her, they are able to find the unsub and save his latest victim. At the end of the episode, Reid thanks her for her help and tells her that he and the BAU can help her in her situation. However, she refuses because she doesn't want ''him'' to hurt Reid. She ends the phone call by telling him that she loves him. Left shocked and speechless, he starts walking to his left but then turns around and walks to his right. Sometime after "The Lesson", Reid continues calling his mystery woman, and it is revealed that her name is Maeve (portrayed by [[Beth Riesgraf]]). She tells Reid that her stalker might be gone and because of this, she wants to meet him. During a case in Arizona, Blake confronts him about "phone booth girl". Reid tells Blake that he's nervous to meet her because he already believes she's the most beautiful girl in the world, and he is afraid that she won't like him because of his looks. Blake encourages him to meet her. After Reid gets back from the case, they plan to meet at a fancy restaurant until Reid sees a man gazing over at him. Thinking him to be Maeve's stalker, Reid calls her to cancel while she is right outside. Spencer realizes that the man is not the stalker, and Maeve has already left. The hostess gives him a bag that she left for him. It turns out to be the very same book he was going to give to her by [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]. Inside, she has written a quote by [[Thomas Merton]]; "Love is our true destiny. We do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone. We find it with another."

In "Zugzwang", Reid discovers that Maeve has been kidnapped by her stalker. In the investigation, he meets Maeve's former fiance, the man he believed to be her stalker. Reid becomes more and more distressed by the situation and discovers that her kidnapper is not her ex-fiance, but the man's girlfriend. Reid searches excessively to find her, and even offers to take her place. He discovers that the stalker wants attention from him and to be seen as an equal. He gets a clue from the stalker leading him to her location, where he tricks the unsub into believing that he is in love with her. Reid finally meets Maeve face-to-face during the situation and is able to briefly subdue the stalker, only to have her hold Maeve at gunpoint. He once again offers to take Maeve's place, but the unsub kills herself and Maeve in one shot.

Reid spends two weeks alone in his apartment after Maeve's death. The team constantly tries to help him, but he refuses to answer the door. While Reid remains at home, the team travel to another case. They call him for help a few times before he joins the team in person. Once the case is complete, Reid asks Morgan, Penelope, and JJ to help clean up his apartment. He picks up ''The Narrative of John Smith'' (given to him by Maeve) with the Thomas Merton quote and places it on the bookshelf.

In the months following, Reid throws himself into his work when he is not able to sleep because of a recurring dream where Maeve asks him to dance with her, but forces himself to wake up before he answers. By the end of "Alchemy", Reid is able to complete the dream by accepting Maeve's request to dance with her. In "The Inspiration", Reid admits that, had Maeve not died, he might have had kids. In the season nine finale, it is revealed that he still carries a copy of ''The Narrative of John Smith'' in his bag.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8826">'''Steve Beren''' (born September 9, 1951) is an American political activist from [[Seattle, Washington]].

==Early life and education==
Born in [[New York City]], Beren says that he was raised in a nominal [[Jewish]] home, later became an atheist and, in 1995, a Christian.&lt;ref name=mv2&gt;{{404|date=May 2016}}{{cite web|url=http://www.steveberen.com/mv2.html|title=The Liberal Elite, Paranoia, Moral Values, and the War Against Terrorism (part 2 of 2)|last=Beren|first=Steve|date=December 29, 2008|publisher=Steve Beren|accessdate=2009-10-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716135312/http://www.steveberen.com/mv2.html|archivedate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activism==

===Socialist Workers Party===
Until 1990 Beren was a member of the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP),&lt;ref name="met"&gt;{{cite news |first=Josh |last=Feit |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=McKenna Consultant is Original Local Tea Party Activist and Former Socialist|url=http://www.seattlemet.com/news-and-profiles/publicola/articles/mckenna-consultant-is-original-local-tea-party-activist-and-former-socialist |work=[[Seattle Metropolitan Magazine]] |publisher= |date=September 2011 |accessdate=15 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramsey" /&gt;

While living in [[Detroit]] in the 1970s, Beren was questioned by the [[FBI]] who were investigating his roommate at the time, a [[Young Socialist Alliance]] partisan suspected of [[subversion|subversive]] activities. According to a congressional report of that incident, the roommate had previously been harassed by a "person claiming to be a congressman on the [[House Un-American Activities Committee|House Internal Security committee]]" who had insinuated knowledge of an "undisclosed purpose" behind the roommate and Beren's relocation from New York; the purported congressman claimed the move was done at the behest of the SWP for purposes of infiltration and [[agitprop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |date=1975 |title=U.S. Intelligence Agencies and Activities: Hearings Before the Select Committee on Intelligence |url= |location= |publisher=[[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] |page=1176 |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beren left the SWP in 1990 due to, what he described as, "exhaustion with it." &lt;ref name="met" /&gt;

===Democratic Party===
After leaving the SWP, Beren became a member of the [[Democratic Party of the United States|Democratic Party]], where he remained for the next fourteen years.&lt;ref name="Ramsey"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/opinion/2003184531_rams09.html|title=McDermott challenger knows a little something about the left|last=Ramsey|first=Bruce|date=August 9, 2006|work=[[Seattle Times]]|accessdate=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republican Party===

Beren quit the Democratic Party to become a Republican. He is a self-identified "Tea Party activist" and was an early confederate of [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] founder [[Keli Carender]]. The success of Carender's first event, a 2009 rally in Seattle against the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], has been partly attributed to promotion it received on Beren's [[blog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maltsev |first=Yuri |date=2013 |title=The Tea Party Explained: From Crisis to Crusade |url= |location= |publisher=Open Court |page=71 |isbn=0812698312 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beren went on to organize and speak at other Tea Party rallies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2009/04/tea_party_post_mortem.php |title=Tea Party Post Mortem |last=Ward |first=Don |date=April 16, 2009 |series=Civics 101 |work=[[Seattle Weekly]] |accessdate=2009-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724111813/https://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2009/04/tea_party_post_mortem.php |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beren has said that Republicans should "have bold colors, wave the Republican flag boldly; wave fiscal conservatism, social conservatism, immigration conservatism — boldly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/elections/2008/06/24/washington-state-republicans-ditching-party-labels-to-compete/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303171203/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/elections/2008/06/24/washington-state-republicans-ditching-party-labels-to-compete/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=March 3, 2016|title=Washington State Republicans Ditch Party Labels to Compete|last=Springer|first=Dan|date=June 24, 2008|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=2009-10-14}} &lt;/ref&gt; During the 2012 GOP presidential primaries, Beren endorsed [[Newt Gingrich]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steveberen.com/newtgingrich2012.html The Conservative Alternative to President Obama] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223013557/http://www.steveberen.com/newtgingrich2012.html |date=February 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://plus.google.com/103558202399303174212/posts/efsk1Pio58o Newt 2012 Announces Washington State Endorsements]&lt;/ref&gt; He has called for fortifying the U.S.' southern border with Mexico&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wenatcheeworld.com/news/2013/sep/27/roundtable-unites-two-voices-for-immigration-and-reform/|title=Roundtable spotlights contrasting views on immigration reform|last=Pratt|first=Christine|date=September 27, 2013|work=[[Wenatchee World]]|accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a supporter of the [[2003 Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/seattlepolitics/archives/121513.asp|title=Beren for Congress|last=Connelly|first=Joel|date=September 10, 2007|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|publisher=|accessdate=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, and again in 2008, Beren ran for [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from [[Washington's 7th congressional district]], advancing to the general election on the Republican ticket in the heavily Democratic-leaning district. In both races he was soundly defeated by incumbent [[Jim McDermott]], scoring roughly 16-percent of the vote each time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sos.wa.gov/elections/results_report.aspx?e=134&amp;c=&amp;c2=&amp;t=863&amp;t2=1&amp;p=&amp;p2=&amp;y= |title=November 2006 General

'''Xavier Kurt Naidoo''' (born October 2, 1971), also known by his stage name '''Kobra''', is a [[Germanic peoples|German]] Soul and R&amp;B singer/songwriter, record producer, and occasional actor. He is a founding member of the German band [[Söhne Mannheims]], and started two record labels, Beats Around the Bush and Naidoo Records. Naidoo also has a successful solo career. His debut album ''Nicht von dieser Welt'' (1998) has sold over 1 million records, and all his next six albums ''Zwischenspiel – Alles für den Herrn'' (2002), ''Telegramm für X'' (2005), ''Alles kann besser werden'' (2009), ''Danke für's Zuhören'' (2012), ''Bei meiner Seele'' (2013) und ''Nicht von dieser Welt 2'' (2016) reached number 1 on the German album charts. Most of his songs are in German, however, he has also released a couple of English songs.

==Career==
Born and raised in [[Mannheim]] to [[South Africa]]n parents of [[Indian South Africans|Indian]], [[Germans in South Africa|German]] and [[Irish diaspora#South Africa|Irish descent]], Naidoo worked in several jobs in the food and music industries before relocating to the United States in the early 1990s, where he released his first full-length [[English language|English-language]] album ''Seeing Is Believing'' under his stage name '''Kobra''' in 1994. He currently resides in [[Heidelberg]] in his native Germany.

After working as a backing vocalist for the [[Rödelheim Hartreim Projekt]] and 3P label mates [[Sabrina Setlur]] and Illmat!c, Naidoo released his first [[German language]] album ''Nicht von dieser Welt'' in 1998, for which he won an [[ECHO (music award)|ECHO Award]] and an [[MTV Europe Music Award]]. Selling more than one million copies in total, it produced six singles, including "Seine Straßen" and "Sie sieht mich nicht", the latter of which served as the theme song for ''[[Astérix &amp; Obélix Take On Caesar|Astérix &amp; Obélix Take on Caesar]]'' (1999). After his highly publicized departure from 3P, his third studio album ''Zwischenspiel – Alles für den Herrn'' was released in 2002. It spawned the top five hit singles "Wo willst du hin?" and "Abschied nehmen" and led to a collaboration with [[Wu-Tang Clan]] member and producer [[RZA]], with whom he released his first number-one single "Ich kenne nichts (das so schön ist wie du)" in 2003.

Known for his soulful voice and his [[Christian]] lyrics, he has collaborated with several famous artists such as [[Deborah Cox]] and [[Switzerland|Swiss]] artist Stress. Naidoo was with [[Söhne Mannheims]] (Sons of Mannheim) earlier before he became famous, after his popularity increased he went back to the band and wanted to help them to become famous too, which worked. Nowadays he switches back and forth with doing some solo music or recording an album and going on tour with Söhne Mannheims. He joined groups like [[Brothers Keepers]] and the charity project (Signs of the Times) in the early 2013

In 2012, he also collaborated in '''Xavas''', a duo formation with [[Kool Savas]], a Turkish-German rapper in the album ''Gespaltene Persönlichkeit''. The two had already worked together on a number of other releases.

In 2013, Xavier released "Eye Opener" on the vocal collaboration album "Features" by [[Kris Menace]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://soundcloud.com/krismenace/sets/features] SoundCloud Kris Menace&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eurovision Song Contest invitation and withdrawal ==

On 19 November 2015, Naidoo was announced as the [[Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest 2016|German representative]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=xavier_naidoo_to_represent_germany_in_stockholm|title=Xavier Naidoo to represent Germany in Stockholm|publisher=Eurovision.tv|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His entry was due to be chosen from six competing entries in a national final in February.

However, his selection proved controversial. Naidoo's right wing political views, coupled with homophobic lyrics in his 2012 song (featuring Kool Savas) "Wo sind sie jetzt", led to calls for his selection to be reconsidered. Within a day, an online petition had gathered nearly 15,000 signatories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eurovoix.com/2015/11/19/commentary-xavier-naidoo-good-decision/|title=Commentary: Xavier Naidoo – Good Decision?|work=Eurovoix|date=19 November 2015|accessdate=22 November 2015|last=Schneider|first=Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claudia Roth]], a vice-president of the Bundestag for the German Green Party, also criticised the decision, citing the poor timing, with right wing political causes gaining popularity in the wake of the [[European migrant crisis|migrant crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kritik an ARD-Auswahl:Grünen-Politikerin Roth findet Naidoos ESC-Teilnahme "voll daneben"|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/xavier-naidoo-claudia-roth-findet-teilnahme-am-esc-voll-daneben-a-1063666.html|website=Spiegel Online|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 November, it was revealed by the [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|German broadcaster, NDR]], that Germany had withdrawn the singer's participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://escxtra.com/2015/11/21/ndr-withdraws-xavier-naidoo-from-eurovision/|title=NDR withdraws Xavier Naidoo from Eurovision|work=escXtra|date=21 November 2015|accessdate=21 November 2015|last=van Lith|first=Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndr.de/der_ndr/presse/mitteilungen/Xavier-Naidoo-faehrt-nicht-zum-ESC-nach-Stockholm,pressemeldungndr16524.html|title=Xavier Naidoo fährt nicht zum ESC nach Stockholm|trans-title=Xavier Naidoo is not running for ESC to Stockholm|language=German|work=[[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]]|date=21 November 2015|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
Xavier Naidoo has blamed the [[Rothschild family]] for Germany's 20th century history&lt;ref name="MyUser_Huffingtonpost.de_March_13_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.de/2014/10/16/xavier-naidoo-antisemitismus_n_5994710.html |title=Antisemitische Liedzeilen: Xavier Naidoo verbreitet judenfeindliche Klischees |newspaper=Huffingtonpost.de |date=  |author= |accessdate= March 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MyUser_Heise.de_March_13_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/43/43561/1.html |title=Rothschild-Verschwörungen bei Xavier Naidoo |newspaper=Heise.de |date=  |author= |accessdate= March 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has spoken at a meeting of the [[Reichsbürgerbewegung]], the right-wing movement that seeks to restore Germany's pre-1918 borders, denies the legal existence of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] and claims Germany is a country occupied by enemy, foreign forces.

Naidoo gave similar opinions in a live interview on [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] [[Morgenmagazin]], public service breakfast television.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Faz.net_March_13_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/gesellschaft/menschen/xavier-naidoos-auftritt-vor-reichsbuergern-13210732.html |title=Xavier Naidoos Auftritt vor "Reichsbürgern" |newspaper=Faz.net |date=  |author= |accessdate= March 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical themes==

===Ethos===
Naidoo's music has been claimed to feature a utopian, pan-theistic ideology through which he expressed his own political anxieties and stances. Although he explores Christian, Muslim, and Rastafarian modes of living, his work has been asserted to be strongly grounded in Old Testament narratives and apocalyptic sentiments. Applying these to situations faced specifically in a " Black German "? context, Naidoo has called for solutions not from the state, but from cross-cultural spiritual collectivities. For example, in the lyrics and video for "Seine Strassen," the power of the state in terms of protection and surveillance is said to pale in comparison to higher spiritual powers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weheliye|first1=Alexander|title=My Volk to Come: Peoplehood in Recent Diaspora Discourse and Afro-German Popular Music|journal=Black Europe and the African Diaspora|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However his lyrics have also featured [[antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] slurs&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.de/2014/10/16/xavier-naidoo-antisemitismus_n_5994710.html "Antisemitische Liedzeilen: Xavier Naidoo verbreitet judenfeindliche Klischees"] in ''Huffington Post'', accessed 23 November 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[homophobia|homophobic]] sentiments. His 2012 song ''Wo sind'' implied that homosexuals were [[paedophiles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Germany-withdraws-Eurovision-contender-after-uproar-on-anti-Semitic-homophobic-lyrics-434858 "Germany withdraws Eurovision contender after uproar on anti-Semitic, homophobic lyrics"], ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', accessed 23 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mixed German and Asian identity===
Naidoo didn't engage directly with his own mixed German and Asian identity in his music, but he was integral to the formation of an Afro-German presence in German popular culture. Specifically, his work with Glashaus can be said to have originated a distinctly Afro-German form of R&amp;B, one which addressed the issues faced by Black Germans without invoking Black Germans specifically. Not only did Naidoo experiment with sounds from around the Black Diaspora, notably working with RZA, but was also a member of Brothers Keepers, an explicitly Afro-German and explicitly political collective. As lead singer in "Adriano," one of Brothers Keepers's most iconic songs, he stands with the Afro-German collective, setting the tone for their message.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
