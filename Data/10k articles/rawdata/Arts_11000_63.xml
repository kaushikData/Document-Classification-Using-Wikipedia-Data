It was set and filmed in [[Bangalore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/80867.html|title='22 FK' opens to positive responses|publisher=Indiaglitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story concerns the travails of 22-year-old nurse Tessa ([[Rima Kallingal]]) from [[Kottayam]] who was raped and who takes revenge on her tormentors.

It released on 13 April 2012, and received positive reviews from critics. It was also well received at the box-office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/malayalam/article/81193.html|title='22 Female Kottayam' is a hit|date=21 April 2012 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rima Kallingal won the [[Kerala State Film Award for Best Actress]] for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-02-22/news-and-interviews/37241349_1_celluloid-honours-male-playback-singer | work=The Times Of India | title=Celluloid clinches top honours at Kerala State Film Awards| date=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Tessa ([[Rima Kallingal]]) is a nursing student in [[Bangalore]] with plans of traveling to [[Canada]] for a career. She meets Cyril ([[Fahadh Faasil]]) from the travel consultancy agency working towards setting up her visa. They soon fall in love and start living together. Tessa loves him with all her heart and takes their relationship and living together seriously.

One day while at a pub, a guy misbehaves with Tessa and Cyril beats him up badly. The guy tries to take revenge on Cyril and searches for him. Cyril goes into hiding with the help of his boss Hegde ([[Prathap Pothen]]). Hegde arrives at Cyril's home to inform Tessa about the situation. Then he asks her plainly "Can I have sex with you?" A shocked Tessa is then brutally attacked and raped. When Cyril finds out what happened, he becomes violent and wants to kill Hegde. Tessa calms him down saying that she does not want to make the incident worse than it is; she instead wants to get to Canada at the earliest. Once Tessa recovers from her injuries, Hegde visits her again to ask for forgiveness. He comes while Cyril is not around and rapes her for a second time. Tessa decides not to travel abroad and plans to murder Hegde.

Cyril discusses the situation with his boss who suggests killing Tessa and appoints Cyril to do it. Cyril traps her by putting some drugs in her bag. The police arrest Tessa and she is imprisoned. While Tessa calls out for help, she finds Cyril simply walking away from her, which is when she realises Cyril set her up. Cyril relocates to Cochin and runs a modeling agency. While in prison Tessa meets Zubeida (Rashmi Sathish) who is sentenced for murder. Through Zubeida's criminal world connections Tessa realizes that Cyril, is a known pimp and was cheating her along with the support of his boss Hegde. Zubeida and Tessa bond well with each other, and Zubeida moulds a criminal mindset within her for the strength and courage needed to strike back at Cyril and Hegde.

When the court sets her free, Tessa with the help of DK (Sathaar) kills Hegde by poisoning him with a cobra. Next, she arrives in Cochin as a [[femme fatale]] in search of Cyril while pretending to be a model. Later one night Tessa hooks up with Cyril in his studio. Cyril who had recognized her earlier reveals it and angrily berates her. He beats her and abuses her by calling her a "slut who does any 'adjustment' to flourish her career" for stopping her further being a menace to him. But his frustration dissolves slowly as he wants to enjoy her company. She reminds him she is a mere woman.

But at night Tessa executes her revenge plan and [[sedates]] Cyril and sadistically [[Penectomy|penectomises]] him. When he regains consciousness she tells him that she has removed his male organ through a medical surgery. While Cyril finds himself in intense pain and bound to his bed, she taunts him to make him realize his faults and the gross wrongs he committed to her and rationalizes her crime. But he doesn't yield to her taunts and reveals a back-story concerning his mother and that his life as a pimp is not entirely his fault.

Tessa tells Cyril that she knows that she is still somewhere in his heart. She reminds him that she has only lost someone who cheated on her, whereas he lost someone who genuinely loved him. Now Cyril is stunned that he is not even able to face Tessa. Cyril recollects that her love was true and his love was overshadowed by his male supremacy concept and greed for wealth. Over the days he admits his actions that caused her pain. Then Tessa leaves him but not before inviting him to settle the score with her, if any remains there. Cyril accepts the challenge of a true criminal as he is and taunts her that he will confront her when he is ready, most probably knowing that he has to settle the score with her in terms of true love with roots in violence. Tessa leaves for Canada, dismantles her cell phone, and cuts further contact with DK.

==Production==
Ashik says that the concept of the film was there in his mind since many years. "This concept was there in my mind when I was working on my maiden venture, ''[[Daddy Cool (2009 Malayalam film)|Daddy Cool]]''. It stayed in my mind and I wanted to take it up at some point. I got the confidence to go ahead with the subject after the success of ''[[Salt N' Pepper]]''. This one is not the usual kind of storyline that will appeal to all producers. There is a certain amount of risk in it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-south-interview-with-aashiq-abu-on-22-female-kottayam/20120413.htm "22 Female Kottayam is a commercial thriller"]&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of ''Salt N' Pepper'', Ashik announced his next film ''[[Idukki Gold]]''. During the pre-production, Abu put the project on hold and started the work of ''22 Female Kottayam''.&lt;ref name="Idukki Gold"&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-10-27/news-interviews/30327680_1_upcoming-flick-creative-department-romantic-thriller "Ashik next will be '22 Female Kottayam'"]&lt;/ref&gt; The film was scripted by debutant writer Abhilash Kumar (who is the husband of actress [[Lena (actress)|Lena]]) along with Shyam Pushkaran of ''Salt N' Pepper'' fame. Kumar had worked with Ashik in ''Daddy Cool'' and ''Salt 'N Pepper'' as an assistant director. Kumar says the story is loosely based on real-life stories about young women who move out of [[Kerala]] to [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] and [[Bangalore]] in search of nursing jobs to eventually go abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-10-22/news-interviews/30310620_1_thrill-audience-whopping-success-aashiq-abu "Ashik to thrill audience"]&lt;/ref&gt; The production controller of ''22 Female Kottayam'' is [[Shibu G Suseelan]].

''22FK'' started production in December 2011 and was mostly filmed from [[Bangalore]].&lt;ref name="Idukki Gold"/&gt; Shyju Khalid wielded the camera. He says that the film, which was shot on a multi-camera, was a big challenge for him. "It is a thriller-cum-romance movie. In the first half, there is romance and suddenly a rape scene, so I had to add a lot of grays to give that effect. And, the climax was the most challenging part, as it’s very dramatic and I had to add the proper effect to retain the mood. Here, the subject was a little dark so I could experiment, but in normal movies you can’t do much of an experiment. Also, you have to keep in mind the taste of Malayalis," says Khalid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deccanchronicle.com/tabloid/kochi/malayalam-directors-usher-new-cinematic-language-860 "Malayalam directors usher in a new cinematic language"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601001255/http://www.deccanchronicle.com/tabloid/kochi/malayalam-directors-usher-new-cinematic-language-860 |date=1 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antoine Watteau - Actors from the Comédie Française - WGA25475.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Actors from the [[Comédie-Française]], {{Circa|1720}}.]]
An '''actor''' is a person who portrays a [[Character (arts)|character]] in a performance (also '''actress'''; [[#The term actress|see below]]).&lt;ref&gt;"The dramatic world can be extended to include the 'author', the 'audience' and even the 'theatre'; but these remain 'possible' surrogates, not the 'actual' referents as such" (Elam 1980, 110).&lt;/ref&gt; The actor performs "in the flesh" in the traditional medium of the [[theatre]] or in modern mediums such as [[film]], [[radio]], and [[television]]. The analogous Greek term is {{wikt-lang|grc|ὑποκριτής|italic=yes}} ({{grc-transl|ὑποκριτής}}), literally "one who answers".&lt;ref name="hypocrite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/actor?q=actor|title=Definition of actor}}''Hypokrites'' (related to our word for [[Hypocrisy|hypocrite]]) also means, less often, "to answer" the [[Tragedy|tragic]] [[Greek chorus|chorus]]. See Weimann (1978, 2); see also Csapo and Slater, who offer translations of classical source material using the term ''hypocrisis'' ([[acting]]) (1994, 257, 265–267).&lt;/ref&gt; The actor's interpretation of their role—the art of [[acting]]—pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is "playing themselves", as in some forms of experimental [[performance art]].

Formerly, in [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]], the [[Middle Ages|medieval world]], and the time of [[William Shakespeare]], only men could become actors, and women's roles were generally played by men or boys.&lt;ref name="Neziroski 2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/narrativelyricdrama.htm|title=narrative, lyric, drama|last=Neziroski |first=Lirim|year=2003|work=Theories of Media :: Keywords Glossary :: multimedia|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=2009-03-14|quote=For example, until the late 1600s, audiences were opposed to seeing women on stage, because of the belief stage performance reduced them to the status of showgirls and prostitutes. Even Shakespeare's plays were performed by boys dressed in drag.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[English Restoration]] of 1660, women began to appear on stage in England. In modern times, particularly in pantomime and some operas, women occasionally play the roles of boys or young men.&lt;ref name="PDF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.s-sj.org/pdfs/St-Dusinberre-web.pdf|format=PDF|title=Boys Becoming Women in Shakespeare’s Plays|author=JULIET DUSINBERRE|website=S-sj.org\accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The term actress==
After 1660 in [[Kingdom of England|England]], when women first started to appear on stage, the terms ''actor'' or ''actress'' were initially used interchangeably for female performers, but later, influenced by the French {{wikt-lang|fr|actrice}}, ''actress'' became the commonly used term for women in theater and film. The [[etymology]] is a simple derivation from ''actor'' with {{Wikt-lang|en|-ess}} added.&lt;ref name="OED2010"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|edition=3|date=November 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|chapter=actress, n.|quote=Although ''actor'' refers to a person who acts regardless of gender, where this term "is increasingly preferred", actress remains in general use; actor is increasingly preferred for performers of both sexes as a gender-neutral term.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When referring to groups of performers of both sexes, ''actors'' is preferred.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2011/sep/25/readers-editor-actor-or-actress|title=The readers' editor on... Actor or actress?|first=Stephen|last=Pritchard|date=24 September 2011|accessdate=22 October 2017|website=Theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Actor'' is also used before the full name of a performer as a gender-specific term.

Within the profession, the re-adoption of the neutral term dates to the [[post-war]] period of the 1950 and '60s, when the contributions of women to cultural life in general were being reviewed.&lt;ref name="De GayGoodman1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goodman|first1=Lizbeth|authorlink1=Lizbeth Goodman|last2=Holledge|first2=Julie|title=The Routledge reader in gender and performance|year=1998|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-16583-0|pages=8; 93}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''The Observer'' and ''The Guardian'' published their new joint style guide in 2010, it stated "Use ['actor'] for both male and female actors; do not use actress except when in name of award, e.g. Oscar for best actress."&lt;ref name="theguardian.com" /&gt; The guide's authors stated that "actress comes into the same category as authoress, comedienne, manageress, 'lady doctor', 'male nurse' and similar obsolete terms that date from a time when professions were largely the preserve of one sex (usually men)." (See ''[[male as norm]]''). "As [[Whoopi Goldberg]] put it in an interview with the paper: 'An actress can only play a woman. I'm an actor – I can play anything.{{'"}}&lt;ref name="theguardian.com" /&gt; The UK performers' union [[Equity (British trade union)|Equity]] has no policy on the use of "actor" or "actress". An Equity spokesperson said that the union does not believe that there is a consensus on the matter and stated that the "...subject divides the profession".&lt;ref name="theguardian.com" /&gt; In 2009, the ''Los Angeles Times'' stated that "Actress" remains the common term used in major [[acting]] awards given to female recipients&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jan/18/entertainment/ca-actress18|title=From actor to actress and back again|last=Linden|first=Sheri|date=18 January 2009 |work=Entertainment|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2009-03-14|quote=It would be several decades before the word "actress" appeared – 1700, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, more than a century after the word "actor" was first used to denote a theatrical performer, supplanting the less professional-sounding "player."}}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]).

With regard to the [[cinema of the United States]], the gender-neutral term "player" was common in film in the [[silent film]] era and the early days of the [[Motion Picture Production Code]], but in the 2000s in a film context, it is generally deemed [[archaism|archaic]]. However, "player" remains in use in the [[theatre]], often incorporated into the name of a theatre group or company, such as the [[American Players Theatre|American Players]], the [[East West Players]], etc. Also, actors in [[improvisational theatre]] may be referred to as "players".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spolin|first1=Viola|title=Improvisation for the Theater: A Handbook of Teaching and Directing Techniques|date=1999|publisher=Northwestern Univ Press|location=Evanston, Ill|ISBN=0810140004|pages=Introduction to the 3rd Edition|edition=3rd|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/improvisation-for-the-theater-a-handbook-of-teaching-and-directing-techniques/oclc/41176682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first recorded case of a performing actor occurred in 534 BC (though the changes in calendar over the years make it hard to determine exactly) when the [[Greece|Greek]] performer [[Thespis]] stepped onto the stage at the ''Theatre Dionysus'' to become the first known person to speak words as a character in a play or story. Prior to Thespis' act, Grecian stories were only expressed in [[song]], dance, and in [[Perspective (storytelling)|third person]] narrative. In honor of Thespis, actors are commonly called ''Thespians''. The exclusively male actors in the [[theatre of ancient Greece]] performed in three types of [[drama]]: [[tragedy]], [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]], and the [[satyr play]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 15–19).&lt;/ref&gt; Western theatre developed and expanded considerably under the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The [[theatre of ancient Rome]] was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from [[Roman festival|festival]] performances of [[street theatre]], nude dancing, and acrobatics, to the staging of situation [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]], to [[high culture|high-style]], verbally elaborate [[Tragedy|tragedies]].

As the [[Western Roman Empire]] fell into decay through the 4th and 5th centuries, the seat of Roman power shifted to [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Records show that [[mime]], [[pantomime]], scenes or recitations from [[tragedy|tragedies]] and [[comedy|comedies]], [[dance]]s, and other entertainments were very popular. From the 5th century, [[Western Europe]] was plunged into a period of general disorder. Small nomadic bands of actors traveled around Europe throughout the period, performing wherever they could find an audience; there is no evidence that they produced anything but crude scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 75)&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, actors were not of high status; therefore, in the [[Early Middle Ages]], traveling acting troupes were often viewed with distrust. Early Middle Ages actors were denounced by the [[Catholic Church|Church]] during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], as they were viewed as dangerous, immoral, and [[pagan]]. In many parts of Europe, traditional beliefs of the region and time period meant actors could not receive a Christian burial.

In the [[Early Middle Ages]], churches in [[Europe]] began staging dramatized versions of biblical events. By the middle of the 11th century, [[liturgical drama]] had spread from [[Russia]] to [[Scandinavia]] to [[Italy]]. The [[Feast of Fools]] encouraged the development of comedy. In the [[Late Middle Ages]], plays were produced in 127 towns. These vernacular [[Mystery plays]] often contained [[comedy]], with actors playing [[devil]]s, [[villain]]s, and [[clown]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 86)&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of actors in these plays were drawn from the local population. Amateur performers in England were exclusively male, but other countries had female performers.

There were a number of secular plays staged in the Middle Ages, the earliest of which is ''The Play of the Greenwood'' by [[Adam de la Halle]] in 1276. It contains satirical scenes and [[Folk culture|folk]] material such as [[faeries]] and other supernatural occurrences. [[Farce]]s also rose dramatically in popularity after the 13th century. At the end of the [[Late Middle Ages]], professional actors began to appear in [[England]] and [[Europe]]. [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] and [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] both maintained small companies of professional actors. Beginning in the mid-16th century, [[Commedia dell'arte]] troupes performed lively improvisational playlets across Europe for centuries. Commedia dell'arte was an actor-centred theatre, requiring little scenery and very few props. Plays were loose frameworks that provided situations, complications, and outcome of the action, around which the actors improvised. The plays utilised [[stock character]]s. A troupe typically consisted of 13 to 14 members. Most actors were paid a share of the play's profits roughly equivalent to the sizes of their roles.

[[File:The Swan cropped.png|thumb|A 1596 sketch of a performance in progress on the [[thrust stage]] of [[The Swan (theatre)|The Swan]], a typical [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan]] open-roof playhouse.]]

Renaissance theatre derived from several medieval theatre traditions, such as the [[mystery plays]], "[[morality play]]s", and the "university drama" that attempted to recreate Athenian tragedy. The Italian tradition of [[Commedia dell'arte]], as well as the elaborate [[masque]]s frequently presented at court, also contributed to the shaping of public theatre. Since before the reign of Elizabeth I, [[Playing company|companies of players]] were attached to households of leading aristocrats and performed seasonally in various locations. These became the foundation for the professional players that performed on the [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan stage]].

The development of the theatre and opportunities for acting ceased when [[Puritan]] opposition to the stage banned the performance of all plays within London. Puritans viewed the theatre as immoral. The re-opening of the theatres in 1660 signaled a renaissance of English drama. English [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]] written and performed in the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period from 1660 to 1710 are collectively called "Restoration comedy". Restoration comedy is notorious for its [[human sexual behavior|sexual]] explicitness. At this point, women were allowed for the first time to appear on the English stage, exclusively in female roles. This period saw the introduction of the first professional actresses and the rise of the first celebrity actors.

===19th century===
[[File:Henry Irving Vanity Fair.jpg|thumb|Henry Irving in ''[[The Bells (play)|The Bells]]'', 1874.]]

In the 19th century, the negative reputation of actors was largely reversed, and acting became an honored, popular profession and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Wilmeth, Don B. |author2=Bigsby, C.W.E. | title=The Cambridge history of American theatre | year=1998 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge, UK | isbn=978-0-521-65179-0 | pages=449–450}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the actor as celebrity provided the transition, as audiences flocked to their favorite "stars". A new role emerged for the [[actor-manager]]s, who formed their own companies and controlled the actors, the productions, and the financing.&lt;ref&gt;James Eli Adams, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the Victorian era'' (2004) 1:2-3.&lt;/ref&gt; When successful, they built up a permanent clientele that flocked to their productions. They could enlarge their audience by going on tour across the country, performing a repertoire of well-known plays, such as those by Shakespeare. The newspapers, private clubs, pubs, and coffee shops rang with lively debates evaluating the relative merits of the stars and the productions. [[Henry Irving]] (1838-1905) was the most successful of the British actor-managers.&lt;ref&gt;George Rowell, ''Theatre in the Age of Irving'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; Irving was renowned for his Shakespearean roles, and for such innovations as turning out the house lights so that attention could focus more on the stage and less on the audience. His company toured across Britain, as well as Europe and the United States, demonstrating the power of star actors and celebrated roles to attract enthusiastic audiences. His knighthood in 1895 indicated full acceptance into the higher circles of British society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Richards|title=Sir Henry Irving: A Victorian Actor and His World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=22Xp03gBd-MC&amp;pg=PA109|year=2007|publisher=A&amp;C Black|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
[[File:The_Shubert_Theatre00.jpg|border|right|frameless]]
By the early 20th century, the economics of large-scale productions displaced the actor-manager model. It was too hard to find people who combined a genius at acting as well as management, so specialization divided the roles as [[Stage management|stage managers]] and later [[theatre director]]s emerged. Financially, much larger capital was required to operate out of a major city. The solution was corporate ownership of chains of theatres, such as by the [[Theatrical Syndicate]], [[Edward Laurillard]], and especially [[The Shubert Organization]]. By catering to tourists, theaters in large cities increasingly favored long runs of highly popular plays, especially musicals. Big name stars became even more essential.&lt;ref&gt;Foster Hirsch, ''The Boys from Syracuse: The Shuberts' Theatrical Empire'' (Cooper Square Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
{{Main|List of acting techniques}}
* [[Classical acting]] is an umbrella term for a philosophy of acting that integrates the expression of the body, voice, imagination, personalizing, improvisation, external stimuli, and script analysis. It is based on the theories and systems of select classical actors and directors including [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] and [[Michel Saint-Denis]]. 
* In [[Stanislavski's system]], also known as Stanislavski's method, actors draw upon their own feelings and experiences to convey the "truth" of the character they portray. Actors puts themselves in the mindset of the character, finding things in common to give a more genuine portrayal of the character.
* [[Method acting]] is a range of techniques based on for training actors to achieve better characterizations of the characters they play, as formulated by [[Lee Strasberg]]. Strasberg's method is based upon the idea that to develop an emotional and cognitive understanding of their roles, actors should use their own experiences to identify personally with their characters. It is based on aspects of Stanislavski's system. Other acting techniques are also based on Stanislavski's ideas, such as those of [[Stella Adler]] and [[Sanford Meisner]], but these are not considered "method acting".&lt;ref&gt;Guerrasio, Jason. (2014-12-19) [https://tribecafilminstitute.org/blog/detail/what_it_means_to_be_method What It Means To Be ‘Method’]. Tribecafilminstitute.org. Retrieved on 2016-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Meisner technique]] requires the actor to focus totally on the other actor as though he or she is real and they only exist in that moment. This is a method that makes the actors in the scene seem more authentic to the audience. It is based on the principle that acting finds its expression in people's response to other people and circumstances. Is it based on Stanislavski's system.

==As opposite sex==
Formerly, in some societies, only men could become actors. In [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/2002_52_fri_04.shtml|title=BBC - Radio 4 - Woman's Hour -Women Actors in Ancient Rome|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Middle Ages|medieval world]], it was considered disgraceful for a woman to go on stage; this belief persisted until the 17th century in [[Venice]]. In the time of [[William Shakespeare]], women's roles were generally played by men or boys.&lt;ref name="Neziroski 2003"/&gt;

When an eighteen-year [[Puritan]] prohibition of [[Restoration drama|drama]] was lifted after the [[English Restoration]] of 1660, women began to appear on stage in England. [[Margaret Hughes]] is oft credited as the first professional actress on the English stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,,1534673,00.html |title=Smallweed |last=Smallweed |date=23 July 2005 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=2009-03-14 |quote="Whereas women's parts in plays have hitherto been acted by men in the habits of women ... we do permit and give leave for the time to come that all women's parts be acted by women," Charles II ordained in 1662. According to Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, the first actress to exploit this new freedom was Margaret Hughes, as Desdemona in Othello on December 8, 1660. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422150043/http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0%2C%2C1534673%2C00.html |archivedate=22 April 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This prohibition ended during the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in part because he enjoyed watching actresses on stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1885/10/18/103638994.pdf |title=Women as actresses |date=18 October 1885 |work=Notes and Queries |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=2009-03-14 |quote=There seems no doubt that actresses did not perform on the stage till the Restoration, in the earliest years of which Pepys says for the first time he saw an actress upon the stage.

"The Restoration Actress". In Owen, Susan J. ''A companion to restoration drama'', pg. 73, (1. publ. ed.). Oxford [u.a.]: Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-0631219231}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first occurrence of the term ''actress'' was in 1608 according to the [[OED]] and is ascribed to [[Thomas Middleton|Middleton]]. In the 19th century many viewed women in acting negatively, as actresses were often [[courtesans]] and associated with promiscuity. Despite these prejudices, the 19th century also saw the first female acting "stars", most notably [[Sarah Bernhardt]].&lt;ref&gt;‘Studies in hysteria’: actress and courtesan, Sarah Bernhardt and Mrs Patrick Campbell&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]], ''[[onnagata]]'', men taking on female roles, were used in ''[[kabuki]]'' theatre when women were banned from performing on stage during the [[Edo period]]. This convention continues. By contrast, some forms of [[Culture of China|Chinese]] drama involve women playing all roles.

In modern times, women occasionally played the roles of boys or young men. For example, the stage role of [[Peter Pan]] is traditionally played by a woman, as are most [[principal boy]]s in British [[pantomime]]. [[Opera]] has several "[[breeches role]]s" traditionally sung by women, usually [[mezzo-soprano]]s. Examples are Hansel in ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]'', [[The Marriage of Figaro#Characters|Cherubino]] in ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' and Octavian in ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]''.

Women playing male roles are uncommon in film, with notable exceptions. In 1982, [[Stina Ekblad]] played the mysterious Ismael Retzinsky in ''[[Fanny and Alexander]]'', and [[Linda Hunt]] received the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for playing Billy Kwan in ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously (film)|The Year of Living Dangerously]]''. In 2007, [[Cate Blanchett]] was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for playing Jude Quinn, a fictionalized representation of [[Bob Dylan]] in the 1960s, in ''[[I'm Not There]]''.

In the 2000s, women playing men in live theatre is particularly common in presentations of older plays, such as Shakespearean works with large numbers of male characters in roles where gender is inconsequential.&lt;ref name="PDF"/&gt;

Having an actor dress as the opposite sex for comic effect is also a long-standing tradition in [[comic theatre]] and film. Most of Shakespeare's comedies include instances of overt [[cross-dressing]], such as [[Francis Flute]] in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. The movie ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' stars [[Jack Gilford]] dressing as a young bride. [[Tony Curtis]] and [[Jack Lemmon]] famously posed as women to escape gangsters in the [[Billy Wilder]] film ''[[Some Like It Hot]]''. Cross-dressing for comic effect was a frequently used device in most of the [[Carry On films]]. [[Dustin Hoffman]] and [[Robin Williams]] have each appeared in a hit comedy film (''[[Tootsie]]'' and ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'', respectively) in which they played most scenes dressed as a woman.

Occasionally, the issue is further complicated, for example, by a woman playing a woman acting as a man—who then pretends to be a woman, such as [[Julie Andrews]] in ''[[Victor/Victoria]]'', or [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] in ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]''. In ''[[It's Pat: The Movie]]'', filmwatchers never learn the gender of the androgynous main characters [[Pat (Saturday Night Live)|Pat]] and Chris (played by [[Julia Sweeney]] and [[Dave Foley]]). Similarly, in the aforementioned example of The Marriage of Figaro, there is a scene in which Cherubino (a male character portrayed by a woman) dresses up and acts as a woman; the other characters in the scene are aware of a single level of gender role obfuscation, while the audience is aware of two levels.

A few modern roles are played by a member of the opposite sex in order to emphasize the gender fluidity of the role. Edna Turnblad in ''Hairspray'' was played by [[Divine (actor)|Divine]] in the [[Hairspray (1988 film)|1988 original film]], [[Harvey Fierstein]] in the [[Hairspray (musical)|Broadway musical]], and [[John Travolta]] in the [[Hairspray (2007 film)|2007 movie musical]]. [[Felicity Huffman]] was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for playing Bree Osbourne (a [[male-to-female transsexual]]) in 2005's ''[[Transamerica (film)|Transamerica]]''.

==Types==
Actors working in theatre, film, television and radio have to learn specific skills. Techniques that work well in one type of acting may not work well in another type of acting.

===In theatre===
To act on stage, actors need to learn the stage directions that appear in the script, such as "Stage Left" and "Stage Right". These directions are based on the actor's point of view as he or she stands on the stage facing the audience. Actors also have to learn the meaning of the stage directions "Upstage" (away from the audience) and "Downstage" (towards the audience)&lt;ref name="sft.edu"&gt;{{cite web |title= Industry Tips |url=http://www.sft.edu/tips/stage-acting.html |accessdate=April 4, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326100456/http://www.sft.edu/tips/stage-acting.html |archivedate=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theatre actors need to learn blocking, which is "...where and how an actor moves on the stage during a play". Most scripts specify some blocking. The Director also gives instructions on blocking, such as crossing the stage or picking up and using a prop.&lt;ref name="sft.edu"/&gt;

Some theater actors need to learn [[stage combat]], which is simulated fighting on stage. Actors may have to simulate hand-to-hand [fighting] or sword[-fighting]. Actors are coached by [[fight director]]s, who help them learn the [[choreography|choreographed sequence]] of fight actions.
&lt;ref name="sft.edu"/&gt;

===In film===
====Silent films====
From 1894 to the late 1920s, movies were [[silent film]]s. Silent film actors emphasized [[body language]] and [[facial expression]], so that the audience could better understand what an actor was feeling and portraying on screen. Much silent film acting is apt to strike modern-day audiences as simplistic or [[camp (style)|campy]]. The melodramatic acting style was in some cases a habit actors transferred from their former stage experience. [[Vaudeville]] theatre was an especially popular origin for many American silent film actors.&lt;ref name=textbook&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=John|title=American Film: A History|date=2008|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-393-97922-0|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pervading presence of [[stage actor]]s in film was the cause of this outburst from director [[Marshall Neilan]] in 1917: "The sooner the stage people who have come into pictures get out, the better for the pictures." In other cases, directors such as John Griffith Wray required their actors to deliver larger-than-life expressions for emphasis. As early as 1914, American viewers had begun to make known their preference for greater naturalness on screen.{{sfn|brownlow|1968|pages=344-353}}

Pioneering film directors in Europe and the United States recognized the different limitations and freedoms of the mediums of stage and screen by the early 1910s. Silent films became less vaudevillian in the mid 1910s, as the differences between stage and screen became apparent. Due to the work of directors such as [[D W Griffith]], cinematography became less stage-like, and the then-revolutionary [[close up]] shot allowed subtle and naturalistic acting. In America, D.W. Griffith's company [[Biograph Studios]], became known for its innovative direction and acting, conducted suit the cinema rather than the stage. Griffith realized that theatrical acting did not look good on film and required his actors and actresses to go through weeks of film acting training.&lt;ref name="infoplease.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/cig/movies-flicks-film/film-acting-vs-theater-acting.html|title=Movies and Film|publisher=infoplease.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lillian Gish]] has been called film's "first true actress" for her work in the period, as she pioneered new film performing techniques, recognizing the crucial differences between [[Stage acting|stage]] and [[screen acting]]. Directors such as [[Albert Capellani]] and [[Maurice Tourneur]] began to insist on naturalism in their films. By the mid-1920s many American silent films had adopted a more naturalistic acting style, though not all actors and directors accepted naturalistic, low-key acting straight away; as late as 1927, films featuring expressionistic acting styles, such as ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', were still being released. {{sfn|Brownlow|1968|pages=344–353}}

According to Anton Kaes, a silent film scholar from the University of Wisconsin, American silent cinema began to see a shift in acting techniques between 1913 and 1921, influenced by techniques found in German silent film. This is mainly attributed to the influx of emigrants from the [[Weimar Republic]], "including film directors, producers, cameramen, lighting and stage technicians, as well as actors and actresses".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Silent Cinema|last = Kaes|first = Anton|date = 1990|journal = Monatshefte|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advent of sound in film====
Film actors have to learn to get used to and be comfortable with a camera being in front of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ace-your-audition.com/auditions-for-film.html|title=Auditions for Film: Movie Acting Tips and Techniques|website=Ace-your-audition.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Film actors need to learn to find and stay on their "mark." This is a position on the floor marked with tape. This position is where the lights and camera focus are optimized. Film actors also need to learn how to prepare well and perform well on [[screen test]]s. Screen tests are a filmed audition of part of the script.

Unlike theater actors, who develop characters for repeat performances, film actors lack continuity, forcing them to come to all scenes (sometimes shot in reverse of the order in which they ultimately appear) with a fully developed character already.&lt;ref name="infoplease.com"/&gt;

"Since film captures even the smallest gesture and magnifies it..., cinema demands a less flamboyant and stylized bodily performance from the actor than does the theater." "The performance of emotion is the most difficult aspect of film acting to master: ...the film actor must rely on subtle facial ticks, quivers, and tiny lifts of the eyebrow to create a believable character."&lt;ref name="infoplease.com"/&gt; Some theatre stars "...have made the theater-to-cinema transition quite successfully ([[Laurence Olivier]], [[Glenn Close]], and [[Julie Andrews]], for instance), others have not..."&lt;ref name="infoplease.com"/&gt;

===In television===
"On a television set, there are typically several cameras angled at the set. Actors who are new to on-screen acting can get confused about which camera to look into."&lt;ref name="sft.edu" /&gt; TV actors need to learn to use lav mics ([[Lavaliere microphone]]s).&lt;ref name="sft.edu" /&gt; TV actors need to understand the concept of "frame". "The term frame refers to the area that the camera's lens is capturing."&lt;ref name="sft.edu" /&gt;
Within the acting industry, there are four types of television roles one could land on a show. Each type varies in prominence, frequency of appearance, and pay. The first is known as a ''series regular''—the main actors on the show as part of the permanent cast. Actors in ''recurring'' roles are under contract to appear in multiple episodes of a series. A ''co-star'' role is a small speaking role that usually only appears in one episode. A ''guest star'' is a larger role than a ''co-star'' role, and the character is often the central focus of the episode or integral to the plot.

===In radio===
[[File:Opname van een hoorspel Recording a radio play.jpg|thumb|Recording a radio play in the Netherlands (1949; [[Spaarnestad Photo]]).]]
Radio drama is a dramatized, purely acoustic [[performance]], broadcast on [[radio]] or published on audio media, such as tape or CD. With no visual component, radio [[drama]] depends on dialogue, music and sound effects to help the listener imagine the characters and story: "It is auditory in the physical dimension but equally powerful as a visual force in the psychological dimension."&lt;ref&gt;Tim Crook: [http://www.coffeetheater.com/usr/down/2_93.pdf ''Radio drama. Theory and practice''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701103558/http://www.coffeetheater.com/usr/down/2_93.pdf |date=July 1, 2014 }}. London; New York: Routledge, 1999, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio drama achieved widespread popularity within a decade of its initial development in the 1920s. By the 1940s, it was a leading international popular entertainment. With the advent of television in the 1950s, however, radio drama lost some of its popularity, and in some countries has never regained large audiences. However, recordings of OTR ([[old-time radio]]) survive today in the audio archives of collectors and museums, as well as several online sites such as [[Internet Archive]].

{{as of|2011}}, radio drama has a minimal presence on terrestrial radio in the United States. Much of American radio drama is restricted to rebroadcasts or [[podcast]]s of programs from previous decades. However, other nations still have thriving traditions of radio drama. In the United Kingdom, for example, the [[BBC]] produces and broadcasts hundreds of new radio plays each year on [[BBC Radio 3|Radio 3]], [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]], and [[BBC Radio 4 Extra|Radio 4 Extra]]. Podcasting has also offered the means of creating new radio dramas, in addition to the distribution of vintage programs.

The terms "audio drama"&lt;ref&gt;Compare the entry to ''Hörspiel'' e.g. in: [http://www.dict.cc/deutsch-englisch/H%C3%B6rspiel.html dict.cc – Deutsch-Englisch-Wörterbuch]&lt;/ref&gt; or "audio theatre" are sometimes used synonymously with "radio drama" with one possible distinction: audio drama or audio theatre may not necessarily be intended specifically for broadcast on radio. Audio drama, whether newly produced or OTR classics, can be found on [[CD]]s, [[cassette tape]]s, [[podcast]]s, [[webcast]]s and conventional broadcast radio.

Thanks to advances in digital recording and Internet distribution, radio drama is experiencing a revival.&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite news | author = Newman, Barry |date = 2010-02-25 | title = Return With Us to the Thrilling Days Of Yesteryear — Via the Internet  | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704240004575085313479028540 | publisher = Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Apocalypse of Lorvão''''' is an [[illuminated manuscript]] from [[Lorvão]], Portugal containing the ''[[Commentary on the Apocalypse]]'' of [[Beatus of Liébana|Beatus]] of [[Santo Toribio de Liébana|Liébana Monastery]], Spain. 

It is currently kept at the [[Torre do Tombo National Archive]] in [[Lisbon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063606/POR_280_004.html|title=Apocalipsis of Lorvao|website=www.europeana.eu|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
This is a well-dated manuscript whose origin is identified through its [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]], which indicates that it was completed in 1189 in the [[scriptorium]] of the Lorvão monastery in the present municipality of [[Penacova]], near [[Coimbra]]. It was signed by the scribe Egeas, who might also be the author of illustrations. It remained preserved in the abbey until the nineteenth century, including while the monastery changed denomination in 1205 and hosted a [[Cistercian]] community.&lt;ref name="MCE"&gt;Notice du ministère de la Culture espagnol&lt;/ref&gt; 

The historian [[Alexandre Herculano]] discovered the manuscript in the library of the monastery in 1853 and transferred it to the national archives of Portugal in Lisbon to be part of the corpus of documents and texts in the history of Portugal (''Portugalliae Monumenta Historica''). The manuscript is still preserved there.&lt;ref name="MCE"&gt;Notice du ministère de la Culture espagnol&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of eleven manuscripts of Beatus in the Iberian record of the [[Memory of the World Register]] by [[UNESCO]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/fr/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-5/the-manuscripts-of-the-commentary-to-the-apocalypse-beatus-of-liebana-in-the-iberian-tradition/ Présentation sur le site de l'UNESCO]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
This is the only manuscript of the Beatus Commentary on the Apocalypse of Liébana, also called Beatus, produced in Portugal during the [[Middle Ages]]. This is a relatively primitive version of the text, probably copied from a ninth century original. It is written in a [[Carolingian minuscule]] style that made the transition to the [[Blackletter|Gothic]]. His miniatures are at number 70, including 18 full-page, 20 of the half-page and the other smaller and variable dimensions. The manuscript also retains its original binding.&lt;ref name="MCE"&gt;Notice du ministère de la Culture espagnol&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;These illustrations were considered archaic for the time, marked by a thick stroke and colors dominated by orange and yellow. They may have been copied from an older model, perhaps close to the original manuscript written by [[Beatus of Liebana]]. There are also repeatedly scenes of everyday life at the time of [[Sancho I of Portugal]]. Finally, [[Beatus map]] belonging to the manuscript has been preserved but only half of it. It was reunited with the manuscript after being separated from it.&lt;ref name="MCE"&gt;Notice du ministère de la Culture espagnol&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cathedral of Saint Lazarus of Autun''' ({{lang-fr|Cathédrale Saint-Lazare d'Autun}}), commonly known as '''Autun Cathedral''', is a [[Roman Catholic]] cathedral in [[Autun]] and a [[Monument historique|national monument]] of [[France]]. Famous for its [[Cluniac]] inspiration and its [[Romanesque sculpture]]s by [[Gislebertus]] it is a highlight in Romanesque art&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=van Boxtel|first=Eduard|title=The site of the Romanesque art in Burgundy|url=http://mydas.ath.cx/bourgogneromane/edifices/autun.htm|accessdate=March 14, 2012|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712081310/http://mydas.ath.cx/bourgogneromane/edifices/autun.htm|archive-date=2012-07-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in Burgundy and it is the seat of the [[Bishop of Autun]].  The Bishop of Autun set forth the construction of St. Lazarus Cathedral as a result of the large movement of pilgrims travelling to Vezelay as they progressed on the pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=William|title=Medieval Cathedrals|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group Inc|location=Westport, CT, USA|isbn=0-313-32693-2|pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to social practices that involved pilgrims venerating the relics of saints in this period, the Bishop of Autun ordered the creation of a larger cathedral to house the relics and accommodate the influx of pilgrims into Autun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=NIckell|first=Joe|title=Relics of the Christ|year=2007|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|location=Lexington, Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-2425-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The column capitals and main façade of the church are embellished with realistic sculptures carved by Gislebertus. The artwork is a means of teaching the masses of Christian ethics with dramatic scenes of heaven and hell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dietsch|first=Deborah|title=Architecture for Dummies|year=2002|publisher=Wiley Publishing Inc|location=Hoboken, NJ, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other features include a rare tympanum signed by Giselbertus of Autun. {{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The Autun Cathedral is a magnificent display of Romanesque Art and Architecture. The sculptures created by Gislebertus successfully integrate biblical iconography relating to the new and old testament's with ease and amazing artistic ability. The size and quality of the tympanum of the Last Judgment, and the lintel of the Temptation of Eve are impressive and exquisitely detailed pieces of art. The Autun Cathedral remains on the highest elevation in Autun, France and is considered a fine example of the French Romanesque.

==History==
===Saint Nazaire Cathedral===
The first cathedral of Autun was built from the 5th century onwards (later dedicated to [[Nazarius and Celsus|Saint Nazarius]] (St. Nazaire), as it held relics of Saints [[Nazarius and Celsus]]) and was several times refurbished and enlarged. In about 970 it obtained from [[Marseille]] some of the relics of [[Lazarus of Aix]], in the belief that they were relics of [[Lazarus of Bethany]], the friend of Jesus. These became an object of pilgrimage and the crowds became too great for the cathedral building. The Bishop of Autun, Etienne de Bâgé, therefore decided in about 1120 on the construction of a new cathedral as a pilgrimage church and for the better veneration of the relics. The new cathedral was allotted a site to the north of the earlier cathedral of Saint Nazaire, of which some remains may still be seen.

===Saint Lazare Cathedral===
[[File:Autun Cathédrale St. Lazare Fassade.jpg|thumb|250px|Front façade]]
[[File:Autun Cathédrale St. Lazare bei Nacht 1.jpg|thumb|250px|The Autun Cathedral at night]]
Work on the new cathedral of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Saint Lazarus]] (St. Lazare) began in around 1120 and advanced rapidly enough for the building to be consecrated in 1132. It was mostly finished by 1146, when the relics of Lazarus were translated from the old cathedral. The Tomb of Lazarus, the shrine of the relics, was constructed in the choir in 1170-1180.&lt;ref&gt;destroyed in 1766&lt;/ref&gt; The [[narthex]] or portico was not completed until the very end of the century.

St. Lazare Cathedral stands in the highest and best fortified corner of the town, and through external modifications that have been applied to the building the appearance has been much altered by the addition of a Gothic tower, a spire and side chapels in the 15th century. The cathedral still contains a highly Romanesque appearance on the interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Town|url=http://france-for-visitors.com/burgundy/morvan/autun-town.html|work=Burgundy, France|accessdate=March 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1462, Bishop [[Jean Rolin (cardinal)|Jean Rolin]] had a new belfry built in replacement of the Romanesque one that was unfortunately destroyed by a bolt of lightning.

The inspiration of the new building, both in layout and decoration, was [[Cluniac]]. The designs were the work of the bishop Etienne de Bâgé, who was particularly influenced by the Cluniac [[abbey of Paray-le-Monial]]. St. Lazare Cathedral was consecrated in 1132.&lt;ref name=Janson&gt;{{cite book|last=Janson|first=Horst Woldemar|title=History of Art: The Western Tradition|year=2004|publisher=Pearson Education Inc|location=New Jersey, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a number of years after 1146 the two cathedrals operated in tandem, with Saint Lazare as the summer cathedral (from Easter to All Saints' Day) and Saint Nazaire as the winter cathedral. The cathedral was finished in 1146, (with the exception of the porch which was added a few years later); Abbé Grivot writing in his excellent guide to the cathedral explains that the interior of the building is not Gothic, as there are no crossed diagonal ribs, but Roman vaulting as was used at Cluny III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Burgundy Today St. Lazare Autun}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Saint Lazare was eventually confirmed as the one cathedral of Autun in 1195. From 1793 until 1805 it was home to the famous painting ''[[Madonna of Chancellor Rolin]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]], now in the [[Musée du Louvre]].

== Architecture==
=== Interior ===
[[File:LazareAutun.jpg|thumb|left|''Saint Mary Magdalene'', sculpture from the old tomb of Saint Lazarus at the Autun Cathedral, now at Autun's [[Musée Rolin]]]]
The interior has a nave and two aisles, divided by massive columns with longitudinal carvings punctuated with beautifully decorated Romanesque capitals. The plan of the cathedral has a narthex of two bays topped by two towers, followed by a 7-bay nave flanked by side aisles and a transept with the tower surmounting cross. The twin flanking towers date from the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Town|url=http://www.france-for-visitors.com|work=Burgundy, Autun|accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nave elevation is composed of three levels: grand arcade, triforium and clerestory, each marked by a cornice. The three story elevation of St. Lazare was made possible by the use of pointed arches for the nave. Each nave bay is separated at the vault by a transverse rib. Each transept projects to the width of two nave bays and the west entrance has a narthex which screens the main portal. The triforium base is decorated with a frieze of rosettes and consists of three blind arches.

The pointed arch has been debated to be adapted from Islamic Art architecture where it had been used for some time.&lt;ref name=Janson/&gt; Many of the historiated capitals that adorn the columns within St Lazare were carved by Gislebertus that include fine representations of the ''[[Flight into Egypt]]'' and ''[[Adoration of the Magi]]. The capitals adorn columns along the nave. What makes St. Lazare a masterpiece of Romanesque art is the quality of Gislebertus' sculpture that appears on dozens of capitals in the nave and chancel including scenes from the Bible carved in stone in a very particular style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=van Boxtel|first=Eduard|title=The site of the Romanesque art in Burgundy: Autun|url=http://mydas.ath.cx/bourgogneromane/edifices/autun.htm|accessdate=March 14, 2012|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712081310/http://mydas.ath.cx/bourgogneromane/edifices/autun.htm|archive-date=2012-07-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exterior ===

The Cathedral of St. Lazare has a ground-plan in the form of a Latin cross, with an aisled nave, a plain transept and a three-stage choir with a semicircular end. The Gothic spire dates from the 15th century although the west towers were rebuilt in the 19th century, based on the Romanesque style of Paray-le-Monial.&lt;ref name=sacred&gt;{{cite web|title=Autun Cathedral`|url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/france/autun-cathedral|work=Sacred Destinations|accessdate=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Capitals ==

St. Lazare Cathedral contains some of the most spectacular Romanesque capitals done by Gislebertus in its nave and choir. Gislebertus created capitals that used the tendrils of the actual Corinthian capital to create an architectural frame for the narrative of the story to develop. 
The capitals of the portal are carved with biblical and traditional scenes. One depicts St. Jerome removing a thorn from a lion's paw; another shows the Presentation of Christ.&lt;ref name=sacred/&gt; Over 60 capitals within St. Lazare are known to be the works of Gislebertus and include other biblical narratives including Samson, the prophet Habakkuk, Cain &amp; Abel, St. Peter, as well as capitals containing Christ and the Apostles. The intricate carvings that make up the capitals by Gislebertus vividly display the narrative it is meant to be picturing.

Owing to a near-collapse in the 19th century, the capitals under the central tower were replaced by replicas; the originals can be viewed up close in the upstairs chapter house (entrance to the right of the choir). Among the scenes on the capitals in the chapter house are the Flight into Egypt, God Questioning Cain, the Hanging of Judas, and the Adoration of the Magi.&lt;ref name=sacred/&gt;

=== Three Magi Capital ===

Gislebertus is conceiving the capitals through liturgical drama. This capitals depicts the angel's attempt to wake the three sleeping magi. The angel points to the star in attempt to have the three magi to follow the star. The narrative of the three magi extends along the columns in the nave. Each capital shows great detail and a vivid depiction of the story it is telling.&lt;ref name=Seidel&gt;{{cite book|last=Seidel|first=Linda|title=Legends in limestone: Lazarus, Gislebertus, and the Cathedral of Autun|year=1999|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=United States of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Suicide of Judas Capital ===

When Judas realizes what he has done to Jesus he repents. In his horror he hangs himself, unable to bear disobeying his master. The capital shows Judas with an open face shown in a grimace with his tongue out. The capital also depicts demons pulling Judas up and hanging him.&lt;ref name=Seidel/&gt;  Gislebertus actually uses one of the tendrils of the Corinthian capital in an innovative way to demonstrate what was used to hang Judas. The fire hair of the devils represents a reference to hell. Gislebertus displays a strong didactic image within the Suicide of Judas capital.&lt;ref name=Seidel/&gt;

=== The Flight to Egypt Capital ===

The Flight into Egypt capital by Gislebertus is located on the column opposite of the Adoration of the Magi narrative. The Flight into Egypt capital depicts Mary with a calm demeanour showing us her child as she sits upon the pony.&lt;ref name=Seidel/&gt; She seems to be floating on the donkey rather than sitting on him, a position similar to the enthroned Madonna and Child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Flight into Egypt by Gislebertus|url=http://www.wga.hu/html_m/g/gisleber/4capital.html|work=Web Gallery of Art|accessdate=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vices and Virtues Capital ===

This capital depicts Charity defeating Greed and Patience conquering Wrath. Such a carving would remind parishioners that evil intentions must be overcome if purity of heart and life is to prevail. This Romanesque capital would provide a didactic function for pilgrims that were illiterate and unable to read the script.  The vice and virtues capital contains acanthus leaves on the background with Charity and Patience stepping upon the "vices" which are demonic creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Capital: Virtues and Vices|work=Art in the Christian Tradition|publisher=Jean and Alexander Heard Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Temptation of Eve'' ==
[[Image:AUTUN Gislebertus Eva.JPG|thumb|300px|The bas-relief ''The Temptation of Eve''.]]
Gislebertus' ''Temptation of Eve'' (French: ''La Tentation d'Ève'') was originally the lintel of the north door of the cathedral. It is stated that the Temptation of Eve was created around the 1130s at the same time in which the Last Judgment and the narrative capitals were made. This large sculpture is now  displayed in the Musée Rolin, Autun, France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Temptation of Eve by Gislebertus|url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/france/autun-musee-rolin-photos/slides/xti_2801p|work=Sacred Destinations|accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The ''Last Judgment'' tympanum ==
[[File:118 Autun Cathédrale Saint-Lazare Le tympan (détail).jpg|thumb|300px|''Last Judgment'' by [[Gislebertus]] in the west tympanum]]
The Last Judgment is believed to have been created around 1130.&lt;ref name=Seidel/&gt;  The tympanum was saved from potential ruin as the canons who were managing the cathedral in the eighteenth century believed that Gislebertus' work was ugly, they covered it with plaster. The tympanum was rediscovered and released from the plaster in 1837.&lt;ref name=Seidel/&gt;

In 1766, the canons decided that the sculpture was not worth keeping because it was mediocre. They then covered everything in a layer of plaster in order to affix other art work on top of the tympanum. Not until 1837 when another canon curiously began to chip away at the plaster was the tympanum discovered. Luckily, it was preserved underneath the plaster with the exception of the head of Christ which was documented to have been removed so that the plaster could fill the tympanum completely.

The West façade of St. Lazare contains the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] (1130–1135), signed ''Gislebertus hoc fecit ''("Gislebertus made this")  within the portico which is ranked amongst the masterpieces of [[Romanesque sculpture]] in France. However, art historian Linda Seidel challenged this reading, arguing that instead Gislebertus was a patron.&lt;ref&gt;Art History, 4th Edition, Stokstad&lt;/ref&gt;

The sheer size of the tympanum required that double lintels support it with a middle column to further support the sculpture. The left side of the tympanum displays the rise to the heavenly kingdom, and on the right is a portrayal of the demons in hell with an angel and a devil weighing the souls on a balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Calkins|first=Robert|title=Monuments of Medieval Art|year=1979|publisher=Cornell Paperbacks|location=New York|pages=102–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zodiac signs surround the arch vault with Christ in the center portrayed as a serene figure. Christ is placed in perfect symmetrical position with a balanced composition of elongated figures. Jesus is flanked by his mother, the Virgin Mary and his apostles cast as penitents and observers of the last judgment. St. Peter guards the gate to heaven and looks on as resurrected individuals attempt to squeeze in with the assistance of the angels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Last Judgment, Gislebertus|url=http://culturedart.blogspot.com/2010/12/last-judgment-gislebertus.html|work=Art and Culture 104|accessdate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gislebertus successfully integrated the modern view of heaven and hell and created a sculpture that would act as a visual educational device for individuals that were illiterate. Viewing the tympanum would allow pilgrim's to know what would happen to them if they were to end up in hell.&lt;ref name=Kleiner&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: The Western Perspective Volume 1|year=2010|publisher=Clark Baxter|location=Boston, MA, USA|pages=317–319}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two men near the centre of the lintel carry bags bearing a cross and a seashell. These are the symbols of pilgrims that travelled from Jerusalem to Santiago de Compostela.&lt;ref name=Kleiner/&gt;

The tympanum would have inspired terror in believers that passed beneath it and viewed the detailed high relief sculpture. The bottom of the tympanum underneath the weighing of the souls has an inscription that states, "May this terror terrify those whom earthly error binds for the horror of the images here in this manner truly depicts what will be".&lt;ref name=Kleiner/&gt; The tympanum is framed by two archivolts. The inner one has carved foliage while the outer archivolt consists of magnificently detailed medallions representing the four seasons, zodiacs, and labors of the months.

There have been various attempts to explain the fact that the figures and scenes on the lintel seem to be an unnecessary doubling of some of the figures and scenes from the main relief. It was argued, for example, that the people represented on the lintel await judgement  or that the scene represents the idea of "[[particular judgement]]" as opposed to "[[general judgement]]", which is represented on the main relief. Dębicki rejects all these interpretations. According to him, the symbolism of the relief consistently reflects the theological views expressed by [[Honorius Augustodunensis]] in his [[Elucidarius]]. Specifically, the doubling is based on the idea that "on judgement day two classes [of people] will be divided into four" (''in die judicii duo ordine in quattuor dividentur''): the figures on the lintel represent the two general classes of people (the saved and the damned), while the figures on the tympanum represent the four particular classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dębicki|first=Jacek|title=Zachodni portal katedry świętego Łazarza w Autun.

'''''Avant-Garde and Kitsch''''' is the title of a 1939 essay by [[Clement Greenberg]], first published in the ''[[Partisan Review]]'', in which he claimed that [[avant-garde]] and [[Modernism|modernist]] art was a means to resist the "[[dumbing down]]" of culture caused by [[consumerism]]. 

The term "[[kitsch]]" came into use in the 1860s or 1870s in Germany's street markets.

== Key ideas ==
Greenberg believed that the avant-garde arose in order to defend [[aesthetic]] standards from the decline of [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]] perpetuated by the mass-production of consumer society, and saw kitsch and art as opposites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenberg|first=Clement|date=1939|title=Avant Garde and Kitsch|url=|journal=The Partisan Review|volume=|pages=34-49|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of his more controversial claims was that kitsch was equivalent to [[Academic art]]: "All kitsch is academic, and conversely, all that is academic is kitsch." He argued this based on the fact that Academic art, such as that in the 19th century, was heavily centered in rules and formulations that were taught and tried to make art into something learnable and easily expressible. He later came to withdraw from his position of equating the two, as it became heavily criticized.

[[File:Lilly the cat 1.jpg|thumb|A 16-year-old female black cat, sleeping]]
A '''black cat''' is a [[Cat|domestic cat]] with black fur that may be a mixed or specific [[Purebred|breed]]. The [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] (CFA) recognizes 22 cat [[breed]]s that can come with solid black coats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.catchannel.com/breeds/black-cat-breeds.aspx|title= Black Cat Breeds and History|first= Stacy N.|last= Hackett|date= 2015-08-17|publisher= CatChannel.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150906094914/http://www.catchannel.com/breeds/black-cat-breeds.aspx|archivedate= 2015-09-06|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bombay cat|Bombay]] breed is exclusively black. All-black fur pigmentation is slightly more prevalent in male cats than female cats. Their high [[melanin]] pigment content causes most black cats to have yellow (golden) eyes ([[iris (anatomy)|irises]]).

==Coat==
{{see also|Cat coat genetics}}
Any cat whose fur is a single color, including black, is known as a "solid" or "self". A "solid black" cat may be coal black, grayish black, or brownish black. Most solid-colored cats result from a recessive gene that suppresses the tabby pattern. Sometimes the tabby pattern is not completely suppressed; faint markings may appear in certain lights, even on a solid black cat. A cat having black fur with white roots is known as a "black smoke."&lt;ref name="colorfaq"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cat Colors FAQ: Common Colors |url=http://fanciers.com/other-faqs/colors.html |publisher=Cat Fanciers Chat (fanciers.com) |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62ISL6nRl?url=http://fanciers.com/other-faqs/colors.html |archivedate=2011-10-09 |accessdate=2011-10-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black cats can also "rust" in sunlight, the coat turning a lighter brownish shade.&lt;ref name="colorfaq"/&gt; Eumelanin, the pigment that is required to produce the black fur, is somewhat fragile, so the rusting effect can be more pronounced in cats that frequently spend time in the sun. A rarer condition that can also cause rusting is a deficiency of the enzyme tyrosine, which is required to produce eumelanin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://paws-and-effect.com/why-is-my-black-cat-rusting/|title=Why Is My Black Cat "Rusting"?|publisher=Paws and Effect|date=2015-09-13|accessdate=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the [[Bombay (cat)|Bombay]], the [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] allows solid black as a color option in 21 other breeds. The color description for those breeds is:

:''Black'': dense coal black, sound from roots to tip of fur. Free from any tinge of rust on the tips. Nose leather: black. Paw pads: black or brown.

The exceptions are:
*[[Oriental Shorthair|Oriental]] – ''Ebony'': dense coal black. Free from any tinge of rust on tips or smoke undercoat. Nose leather: black. Paw pads: black or brown.
*[[Sphynx cat|Sphynx]] – ''Black'': black. One level tone from nose to tip of tail. Nose leather: black. Paw pads: black or brown.
*[[Ragamuffin cat|Ragamuffin]] – Although black is not specifically mentioned, the standard allows for "any color, with or without white," so technically speaking, an all-black Ragamuffin would be allowed under the breed standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cats.about.com/od/blackcats/ss/factsaboutblackcats_5.htm |title=Facts About Black Cats |author=Syufy, Franny |publisher=[[About.com]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62ISnsOfs?url=http://cats.about.com/od/blackcats/ss/factsaboutblackcats_5.htm |archivedate=2011-10-09 |accessdate=2011-10-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical associations==

===Superstition, prejudice, bringer of good or bad luck===

The [[folklore]] surrounding black cats varies from culture to culture. The [[Scottish people|Scots]] believe that a strange black cat's arrival to the home signifies prosperity. In [[Celtic mythology]], a [[fairy]] known as the [[Cat sìth]] takes the form of a black cat. Black cats are also considered good luck in the rest of Britain and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csicop.org/superstition/library/black_cats |title=Superstition Bash Black Cats |year=2011 |location=Amherst, New York |publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62ITHwwRN?url=http://www.csicop.org/superstition/library/black_cats |archivedate=2011-10-09 |accessdate=2011-10-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it is believed that a lady who owns a black cat will have many suitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.petside.com/article/black-cat-myths |title=Black Cat Myths |author=Singer, Jo |publisher=PetSide.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62ITlNtPa?url=http://www.petside.com/article/black-cat-myths |archivedate=2011-10-09 |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-11-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Western history, black cats have typically been looked upon as a symbol of evil omens, specifically being suspected of being the [[familiar spirit|familiar]]s of witches, or actually [[shape-shifting]] witches themselves. Most of Europe considers the black cat a symbol of bad luck, particularly if one walks across the path in front of a person, which is believed to be an omen of misfortune and death. In Germany, some believe that black cats crossing a person's path from right to left, is a bad omen. But from left to right, the cat is granting favorable times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.best-cat-art.com/black-cats.html |title=Black Cats...

The black cat in folklore has been able to change into human shape to act as a spy or courier for witches or demons. When the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] arrived at [[Plymouth Rock]], they brought with them a devout faith in the Bible. They also brought a deepening suspicion of anything deemed of Satan and were a deeply suspicious group. They viewed the black cat as a companion, or a familiar to witches. Anyone caught with a black cat would be severely punished or even killed. They viewed the black cat as part demon and part sorcery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecatsite.com/Snips/124/The-Mystique-Behind-Black-Cats.html |title=The Mystique Behind Black Cats |first=Mary Ann |last=Miller |year=2011 |publisher=The Cat Site.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6208I6S7P?url=http://www.thecatsite.com/Snips/124/The-Mystique-Behind-Black-Cats.html |archivedate=2011-09-27 |accessdate=2011-09-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These superstitions led people to kill black cats. There is no evidence from England of regular large-scale massacres of "satanic" cats, or of burning them in [[midsummer]] bonfires, as sometimes occurred elsewhere in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t71.e150 |title=''A Dictionary of English Folklore''|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2000 |accessdate=2009-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the supernatural powers ascribed to black cats were sometimes viewed positively; for example, sailors considering a "[[ship's cat]]" would want a black one because it would bring good luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Don't Shoot the Albatross!: Nautical Myths and Superstitions |last=Eyers |first=Jonathan |year=2011 |publisher=[[A &amp; C Black]] |location=London|isbn=978-1-4081-3131-2 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, fishermen's wives would keep black cats at home too, in the hope that they would be able to use their influence to protect their husbands at sea (see [[Ship's cat]]). The view of black cats being favorable creatures is attributed specifically to the Egyptian goddess Bast (or [[Bastet]]), the cat goddess. Egyptian households believed they could gain favor from Bastet by hosting black cats in their household. This view was held in the early 17th century by the English monarch [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. Upon the death of his treasured pet black cat, he is said to have lamented that his luck was gone. True to his claim, he was arrested the very next day and [[High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I|charged with high treason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cats.lovetoknow.com/Black_Cats |title=Black Cats |first=Ann |last=Parkinson |date= |publisher=Love To Know Cats |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62IX7iggs?url=http://cats.lovetoknow.com/Black_Cats |archivedate=2011-10-09 |accessdate=2011-10-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Piracy|Pirates]] of the 18th century believed that a black cat would bring different kinds of luck. If a black cat walks towards someone, that person will have bad luck. If a black cat walks away from someone, then that person will have good luck.

Conversely in the United Kingdom if a black cat walks towards someone, it brings good fortune, but if it walks away, it takes the good luck with it.&lt;ref name="Superstitionsonline" /&gt; If a black cat walks onto a ship and then walks off it, the ship is doomed to sink on its next trip.

Black cats have been found to have lower odds of adoption in American [[Animal shelter|shelters]] compared to other colors except brown, although black animals in general take more time to find homes. The reasons given include not only superstition, but also the perception of black as "boring" compared to other colors as well as the belief that black cats don't photograph well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.psyeta.org/jaaws/full_articles/5.1/leeper.pdf|title= Prediction of adoption versus euthanasia among dogs and cats in a California animal shelter|first1= Merry|last1= Lepper|first2= Philip H.|last2= Kass|first3= Lynette A.|last3= Hart|year= 2002|work= Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science, 2002;5(1):29-42 |publisher= School of Veterinary Medicine [[University of California]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060925235905/http://www.psyeta.org/jaaws/full_articles/5.1/leeper.pdf |archivedate= 2006-09-25|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="blkcatappr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://holidappy.com/holidays/Why-You-Should-Celebrate-Black-Cat-Appreciation-Day-on-August-17th|title=Why You Should Celebrate Black Cat Appreciation Day on August 17th|date=2018-07-19|author=Jennifer Wilber|publisher=holidappy.com|accessdate=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some shelters also suspend or limit adoptions of black cats around [[Halloween]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/31/living/black-cats-irpt/index.html?hpt=hp_c4|title= To be a black cat on Halloween|first= Rachel|last= Rodriguez|date= 2014-10-31|publisher= [[CNN]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141031142859/http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/31/living/black-cats-irpt/index.html?hpt=hp_c4|archivedate= 2014-10-31|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; for fear they will be tortured, or used as "living decorations" for the holiday and then abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/mayhem/blackcat.asp |title=Cat o'Nine Tales |first1=Barbara |last1=Mikkelson |first2=David |last2=Mikkelson |date=2005-10-27 |publisher=[[Snopes.com]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62IXk2kbc?url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/mayhem/blackcat.asp |archivedate=2011-10-09 |accessdate=2011-10-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="truth_halloween"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=74&amp;SubsectionID=114&amp;ArticleID=86024|author=Boks, Ed|title=The truth about black cats and Halloween|location=Prescott, Arizona|work=[[The Daily Courier (Arizona)|The Daily Courier]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61yCKuiNb?url=http://www.dcourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=74&amp;SubsectionID=114&amp;ArticleID=86024|archivedate=2011-09-25|date=2010-10-06|accessdate=2010-10-10|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytoreador.com/news/article_9bcbeea6-ff85-11e0-8a42-0019bb30f31a.html |title=Humane Society refuses black cat adoption during Halloween season |author=Crump, Morgan |date=2011-10-25 |publisher=dailytoreador.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62yLXU9mn?url=http://www.dailytoreador.com/news/article_9bcbeea6-ff85-11e0-8a42-0019bb30f31a.html |archivedate=2011-11-05 |accessdate=2011-10-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, no one has ever documented in the history of humane work any relationship between adopting black cats and cats being killed or injured.

In the early days of television in the United States, many stations located on [[VHF]] channel 13 used a black cat as a mascot in order to make sport of being located on an "unlucky" channel number.

===Anarcho-syndicalism===

{{see also|Anarchist symbolism#black cat|label1=Anarchist symbolism § Black cat}}

[[Image:Anarchist black cat.svg|left|thumb|The black cat of the Industrial Workers of the World, also adopted as a symbol by anarcho-syndicalists]]
Since the 1880s, the [[political colour|color]] [[black]] has been associated with [[anarchism]]. The black cat, in an alert, fighting stance was later adopted as an [[anarchist symbol]].

More specifically, the black cat—often called the "sab cat" or "sabo-tabby"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iww.org/en/history/dictionary |title=IWW Union Dictionary and Glossary |first= |last= |date=2005-05-01 |location=Chicago, Illinois |publisher=[[Industrial Workers of the World]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62IYWAFaL?url=http://www.iww.org/en/history/dictionary |archivedate=2011-10-09 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2011-10-09 |quote=A symbol for "sabotage" (i.e. inefficiency at the point of production by disgruntled workers), usually represented by a black cat with bared teeth. Also called "sab kitty", "sabo-tabby", or "the cat". |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;—is associated with [[anarcho-syndicalism]], a branch of anarchism that focuses on labor organizing (see [[Wildcat strike]]).

In testimony before the court in a 1918 trial of [[Industrial Workers of the World]] leaders, [[Ralph Chaplin]], who is generally credited with creating the IWW's black cat symbol, stated that the black cat "was commonly used by the boys as representing the idea of [[Industrial Workers of the World philosophy and tactics#Sabotage|sabotage]]. The idea being to frighten the employer by the mention of the name sabotage, or by putting a black cat somewhere around. You know if you saw a black cat go across your path you would think, if you were superstitious, you are going to have a little bad luck. The idea of sabotage is to use a little black cat on the boss."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Salerno |first1=Salvatore |title=Red November, Black November: Culture and Community in the Industrial Workers of the World |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_M25WbGARJwC&amp;pg=PA178|year=1989|location= Albany, New York|publisher= [[SUNY Press]]|isbn=0-7914-0089-1 |page=178 }} from U.S. v.

==Adoption and Black Cat Day==
October 27 has been designated ‘Black Cat Day’ by [[Cats Protection]] in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]],&lt;ref name="NBCatDay"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cats.org.uk/get-involved/national-black-cat-day/|title= National Black Cat Day 2015|date= 2015|publisher= Cats Protection|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151005163431/http://www.cats.org.uk/get-involved/national-black-cat-day/|archivedate= 2015-10-05|deadurl= yes|accessdate= 2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; to celebrate the virtues of black cats and to encourage people to adopt an unwanted black cat. Cats Protection's own figures suggest that black cats are more difficult for them to find a new home for than other colours.&lt;ref name="NBCatDay" /&gt; In 2014, the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|RSPCA]] reported that 70% of the abandoned cats in its care were black,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2709721/Hundreds-black-cats-abandoned-owners-don-t-look-good-SELFIES.html |title=Hundreds of black cats are being abandoned by their owners because they don't look good in selfies |first=Harriet |last=Arkell |date=2014-07-29 |work=[[Daily Mail]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6chEq4l7K?url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2709721/Hundreds-black-cats-abandoned-owners-don-t-look-good-SELFIES.html |archivedate=2015-10-31 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2015-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting a possible reason was that people considered black cats [[Photogenic|"un-photogenic"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/black-cats-being-rejected-because-they-dont-look-good-in-selfies-says-rspca-9637202.html|title= Black cats being rejected because they don't look good in selfies, says RSPCA|first= Christopher|last= Hooten|date= 2014-07-30|location= London|work= [[The Independent]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150405040719/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/black-cats-being-rejected-because-they-dont-look-good-in-selfies-says-rspca-9637202.html|archivedate= 2015-04-05|deadurl= no|accessdate= 2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, "Black Cat Appreciation Day" is August 17.&lt;ref name="AnimalFound"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://animalfoundation.com/black-cats-the-good-the-bad-and-the-misunderstood/|title= Black Cats — The Good, The Bad, and The Misunderstood|date= n.d.|location= Las Vegas, Nevada|publisher= The Animal Foundation|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161028021839/http://animalfoundation.com/black-cats-the-good-the-bad-and-the-misunderstood/|archivedate= 2016-10-28|deadurl= no|accessdate= 2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by the [[ASPCA]] shows that black cats are the least likely to be adopted from shelters of any type of cat.&lt;ref name="AnimalFound" /&gt; This can be partly because of the superstition behind black cats such as their association with witchcraft or bad luck, or because they appear dull next to more colorful cats. In 2014 [[Toronto]], Canada's largest city, held an event on [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] during which people could adopt a black cat without paying the usual $75 adoption fee, in order to encourage the adoption of black cats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/11/22/adoption_fees_being_waved_for_black_cats_at_shelters.html|title= Adoption fees being waived for black cats at shelters|first= Katherine|last= Declerq|date= 2014-11-22|location= Toronto, Ontario|work= [[Toronto Star]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160410110242/http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/11/22/adoption_fees_being_waved_for_black_cats_at_shelters.html|archivedate= 2016-04-10|deadurl= no|quote= Animal Services will be hosting a “cat adoption blitz” in honour of Black Friday. The $75 adoption fee will be waived from four different animal shelters across the city, as well as at a number of partner locations. The only cost to adopt a black cat will be a $15 license fee.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend had now spread across the United States, with many shelters offering free adoption of black cats on Black Friday.

With the success of the 2018 African-themed [[Superhero film]], ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'', there was a fad of adopting black domestic cats as pets and naming them after various characters of the film such as [[T'Challa]] and [[Shuri (comics)|Shuri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ahsan|first1=Sadaf|title=Thanks to Black Panther, there's been a reported rise in black cat adoptions|url=http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/movies/thanks-to-black-panther-theres-been-a-reported-rise-in-black-cat-adoptions|accessdate=2 March 2018|publisher=The National Post|date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed that usually people were not going out of their way to follow this fad, but visited animal shelters to simply adopt a pet under normal circumstances and were inspired by the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] to adopt a black cat when they see one. Regardless, to reduce the chance of such cats being abandoned when the fad fades, reputable animal shelter personnel took the usual precautions of having potential adopters fill out questionnaires to weed out potentially abusive guardians and have them read literature about the needs and responsibilities of such a pet to dissuade the less conscientious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chorney|first1=Saryn|title=A Kitten Named Wakanda?

A '''boom operator''' is an assistant of the [[production sound mixer]]. The principal responsibility of the boom [[Operator (profession)|operator]] is [[microphone]] placement, usually using a boom pole (or "fishpole") with a microphone attached to the end (called a boom mic), their aim being to hold the microphone as close to the actors or action as possible without allowing the microphone or boom pole to enter the camera's frame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.media-match.com/usa/jobtypes/boom-operator-jobs-402683.php media-match.com, Boom Operator, What do Boom Operators do?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invention of the boom mic==

The first noted use of a boom mic was on the set of ''[[Beggars of Life]]'' (1928) when director [[William A. Wellman]] wanted a [[tracking shot]] of two actors walking down a street, and the [[Production sound mixer|sound man]] refused, telling the director that the actors had to be static and the microphone had to be hidden in a flowery vase. Wellman said "that's crazy" and instructed the sound man to put the microphone on a broom-handle and walk along the actors just outside of the frame.&lt;ref&gt;''Wild Bill: Hollywood Maverick'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[David O. Selznick]], "I was also present on the stage when a microphone was moved for the first time by Wellman, believe it or not. Sound was relatively new and at that time the sound engineer insisted that the microphone be steady. Wellman, who had quite a temper in those days, got very angry, took the microphone himself, hung it on a boom, gave orders to record—and moved it."&lt;ref&gt;''The Parade's Gone By...'' (1992) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Another instance of a prototype boom mic was on ''[[The Wild Party (1929 film)|The Wild Party]]'' (1929). To allow [[Clara Bow]] to move freely on the set, director [[Dorothy Arzner]] had technicians rig a microphone onto a fishing rod.&lt;ref name=geller&gt;{{cite web|author=Geller, Theresa L.|title=Dorothy Arzner|work=Great Directors|publisher=Senses of Cinema|url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2003/great-directors/arzner|accessdate=2007-04-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210225806/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/directors/03/arzner.html|archivedate=2007-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/dorothy-arzner-hidden-star-maker-of-hollywood-s-golden-age |  title = Dorothy Arzner, Hidden Star Maker of Hollywood's Golden Age |accessdate = July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A patent was filed a year later for a very similar sound-recording device by Edmund H Hansen, a sound engineer at the [[Fox Film Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Seger |first1=Linda S. |title=When Women Call the Shots: The Developing Power and Influence of Women in Television and Film|date=2003|isbn=0595268382|page=15}}&lt;!--|accessdate=July 17, 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Often in television studios, the boom operator will use a "fisher boom", which is a more intricate and specialized piece of equipment on which the operator stands, allowing precise control of the microphone at a greater distance from the actors. They will also attach [[wireless microphone]]s to persons whose voice requires recording. Boom poles are usually manufactured from several lengths of aluminum or carbon fibre tubing, allowing the boom to be extended and collapsed as the situation requires.

Some poles have a microphone cable routed through the inside of the pole, which may be a regular cable protruding at the bottom end, or a coiled cable that can extend with the pole, connecting to a socket at the base into which the operator plugs the microphone cable. The ideal boom pole is lightweight and strong, supporting the weight of the microphone on the end while adding as little weight as possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://getinmedia.com/careers/boom-operator getinmedia.com, Boom operator]&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequently, a wind-attenuating cover, called a "[[Microphone#Blimps|blimp]]" or "mic-blimp", is used to enclose the microphone. A blimp covered with sound-absorbing fuzzy fabric is usually nicknamed a windmuff or a "dead cat". In film crew jargon, the gruesome-sounding phrase ''dead cat on a stick'' is simply a boom microphone fitted with a fuzzy wind-screen.

The boom operator and production sound mixer may often be combined into a job performed by one person, usually when the crew number is to be kept minimal, such as for documentaries or news collecting, or in low-budget productions. The one-man unit is often known simply as a "sound recordist" or "sound man", and would perform all on set sound duties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://work.chron.com/boom-operator-job-26102.html work.chron.com, boom operator]&lt;/ref&gt;

The boom operator must decide where to place the microphone based on a combination of factors, including the location and projection of any dialogue, the frame position of the camera, the source of lighting (and hence shadows) and any unwanted noise sources. Often the boom operator will need to be as familiar with the script as are the actors, as they may be required to tilt or move the microphone according to who is speaking.

In productions with a bigger budget, more than one boom operator may be used, with each operator focusing on a different actor.

Having the boom mic or its shadow appear on the screen in a completed picture is considered a sign of poor film-making. Notable examples include the mic's shadow appearing above two crewmen flying a plane in ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' and the mic itself dipping into the frame numerous times in [[Rudy Ray Moore]]'s film ''[[Dolemite]]''. The [[TV Tropes]] wiki has a list on its "Visible Boom Mic" trope page demonstrating more examples.&lt;ref&gt;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisibleBoomMic&lt;/ref&gt; Pastiches of bad film-making may also use boom mic visibility to spoof their material.

'''''Bourke Street''''' is a [[1886 in art|1886]] painting by Australian artist [[Tom Roberts]]. Roberts originally titled the work '''''Allegro con brio'''''.&lt;ref name="NLA"&gt;{{cite web|title= Bourke Street, Melbourne (picture) / Tom Roberts. |url=http://www.nla.gov.au/apps/cdview?pi=nla.pic-an2268340&amp;fullrecord=yes|work=Digital collections|publisher=National Library of Australia|accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting depicts the western end of [[Bourke Street, Melbourne|Bourke Street]], one of the main thoroughfares in [[Melbourne]] as seen from the [[Buckley &amp; Nunn]] drapery.&lt;ref name="EMelbourne"&gt;{{cite web|last=Spate|first=Virginia|title=Bourke Street (Tom Roberts)|url=http://www.emelbourne.net.au/biogs/EM00220b.htm|work=EMelbourne|publisher=University of Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was painted a few months after Roberts' return to Australia in 1885, after he had spent four years in Europe .&lt;ref name=EMelbourne /&gt; It was not displayed until 1890, and only five days beforehand,  Roberts added three female figures to the lower left.&lt;ref name=EMelbourne /&gt;&lt;ref name="McQueen"&gt;{{cite web|last=McQueen|first=Humphrey|title=Allegro con brio, Bourke Street west|url=http://home.alphalink.com.au/~loge27/roberts/roberts_allegro.htm|accessdate=19 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309125644/http://home.alphalink.com.au/~loge27/roberts/roberts_allegro.htm|archivedate=9 March 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts was unable to find a buyer and handed the painting to fellow artist, [[Frederick McCubbin]]. In 1920, McCubbin's widow sold the painting to the [[Commonwealth Parliamentary Library]] for 20 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]]&amp;mdash;forwarding the proceeds to Roberts, who was in London at the time.&lt;ref name=McQueen /&gt;

''The Early Paintings and Drawings of John Constable'', (London: [[Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art]] and [[Yale University Press]], 1996) {{ISBN|9780300063370}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''''catalogue raisonné''''' is a comprehensive, annotated listing of all the known [[Visual arts|artworks]] by an [[artist]] either in a particular medium or all media.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nypl.org/node/29583 What is a Catalogue Raisonné?]", ''New York Public Library''.&lt;/ref&gt; The works are described in such a way that they may be reliably identified by third parties.

There are many variations, both broader and narrower than "all the works" or "one artist". The parameters may be restricted to one type of art work by one artist or widened to all the works by a group of artists.

It can take many years to complete a ''catalogue raisonné'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=''[[FiveThirtyEight]]'' |title=One Art Lover’s Crusade To Catalog The World |url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/one-art-lovers-crusade-to-catalog-the-world/ |first=Oliver |last=Roeder |date=August 17, 2017 |quote=Such a catalog can itself represent the life’s work of the scholar who compiles it. It took Jacob-Baart de la Faille 11 years to complete van Gogh’s catalog. Monet’s catalog was published over a span of 18 years by a French billionaire. And it took 46 years for all of Picasso’s catalog to be released, while its publisher sold his car and apartment to finance the project.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and large teams of researchers are sometimes employed on the task. For example, it was reported in 2013 that the Dedalus Foundation (established by the abstract-expressionist painter [[Robert Motherwell]]) took 11 years to complete the three-volume catalogue raisonné of Motherwell’s work which was published by Yale University Press in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;Flam, J.; Rogers, K.; and Clifford, T. (2012). {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929215632/http://yalebooks.co.uk/display.asp?K=9780300149159 |date=29 September 2014 |title=Robert Motherwell Paintings and Collages: A Catalogue Raisonné 1941–1991}}.

Early examples consisted of two distinct parts, a biography and the catalogue itself. Their modern counterpart is the critical catalogue which may contain personal views of the author.&lt;ref name="Wildenstein Institute"/&gt;

==Name==

The term ''catalogue raisonné'' is French, meaning "reasoned catalogue"&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"&gt;"[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/catalogue+raisonne Catalogue raisonné]", ''Online Merriam-Webster Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. containing arguments for the information given, such as attributions), but is part of the [[technical terminology]] of the English-speaking art world. The spelling is never Americanized to "catalog", even in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Car.html |title=Car-Caz |website=ArtLex.com |date=13 July 2007 |access-date=26 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713171515/http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/Car.html |archive-date=13 July 2007 |quote=Although 'catalogue raisonné' was originally a French term, English speakers have used it for a long time.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FAQ, placing the Catalogue Raisonné in context with other types of art catalogues: {{cite web |url=http://arthistory.about.com:80/od/artspeak_faqs/f/catalogue.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909211530/http://arthistory.about.com:80/od/artspeak_faqs/f/catalogue.htm |archive-date= 9 September 2017 |title=

==Role in authentication of artistic work==
''[[The New York Times]]'' has described catalogues raisonnés as the definitive, scholarly compendia of an artist's work, the "supreme arbiter of the genuine and fake".&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;Cohen, Patricia (19 June 2012). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/arts/design/art-scholars-fear-lawsuits-in-declaring-works-real-or-fake.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 In Art, Freedom of Expression Doesn't Extend to 'Is It Real?']", ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of deceased artists the producer of a catalogue raisonné which is regarded as a standard text may have considerable power to determine whether a particular work is regarded as authentic or not.{{efn|[[Wildenstein Index Number]]}} In this context "producers" may include authors, editors, committees or publishers.

Inclusion in or exclusion from a respected catalogue raisonné can have a considerable effect on the market price of a work, amounting in some cases to large sums of money. Inclusion has been called the difference between "great wealth and the gutter",&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; and auction houses sometimes refuse to handle unlisted works.&lt;ref name="New York Times 2014/02/03"/&gt; As a result, catalogue raisonné authors have been the targets of lawsuits, and allegedly of bribes and even death threats&lt;ref name="New York Times 2014/02/03"&gt;Cohen, Patricia (2 February 2014). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/03/arts/design/a-modigliani-who-says-so.html?ref=design&amp;_r=2 A Modigliani? Who Says So?]", ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; although no evidence of the latter has reached the courts.

In an edition of the television programme in the [[BBC]] documentary series ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'' broadcast in the United Kingdom on 19 June 2011, the subject was the authenticity of the [[Claude Monet|Renoir]]  painting ''[[Bords de la Seine à Argenteuil]]''. The painting was submitted to the [[Wildenstein Institute]] which is the publisher of the catalogues raisonnés&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223132505/http://wildenstein-institute.fr/spip.php?page=wildenstein-publications-liste&amp;lang=en |title="Catalogue of Publications", ''Wildenstein Institute'' |date=23 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; most widely accepted as [[Wildenstein Index Number|authoritative]] on the subject of Renoir paintings. The result of this submission was that the Institute, acting in accordance with the wishes of a descendant of the original author of the catalogues, refused to include it in future editions. This decision was taken despite the fact that the Institute had been presented with considerable evidence of the painting's authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartsdesk.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=3936:fake-or-fortune?-episodes-1-2-bbc1&amp;Itemid=27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180713074928/https://theartsdesk.com/?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=3936%3Afake-or-fortune%3F-episodes-1-2-bbc1&amp;Itemid=27 |archive-date=13 July 2018 |title=Reviews |publisher=The Arts Desk |date=23 March 2012 |accessdate=27 March 2012}}{{verify source|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to this decision the edition of the programme broadcast in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2014 investigated one of a [[The Grand Teddy tea-rooms paintings|group of paintings]] reputedly by French post-impressionist [[Édouard Vuillard]] and on this occasion a committee of the Wildentstein Institute decided that the painting should be included in their catalogue raisonné for the artist.&lt;ref name="Huff vuillard"&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Painting Bought For £3,000 On Ebay Actually Worth A Fortune |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/01/20/ebay-painting-fortune_n_4630252.html |accessdate=24 January 2014|newspaper=[[Huffington Post]]|date=20 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The art dealer and historian [[Philip Mould]] stated while presenting the programme that this painting would be worth approximately £250,000 if it was accepted for inclusion in the catalogue raisonné, but that if it was not accepted it would be worth approximately £1,500 'as a piece of decorative art' – less than 1% of the full value.&lt;ref&gt;Transcribed from BBC iPlayer: [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03rmbqc ''Fake or Fortune?'' S3 E1/4: "Vuillard"], ''BBC.co.UK''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the ''New York Times'' reported that some scholars and artists' foundations have decided not to publish future catalogues raisonnés because they fear being sued by buyers or sellers unhappy with their conclusions.&lt;ref name="New York Times 2014/02/03"/&gt; The question of whether producers of catalogues raisonnés should accept responsibility for determining authenticity of works was debated at a seminar on 29 March 2012 held at Christies, New York under the auspices of the Catalogue Raisonné Scholars Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222195618/http://www.catalogueraisonne.org/programs/programs.html |title="Programs", ''Catalogue Raisonne Scholars Association'' |date=22 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of individual policies is given by the Wildenstein Institute's stated policy with regard to authentication of artworks which (at 8 February 2014) was as follows: 'After examination, and based on the opinion of the members of the committee, a recommendation is made in the form of the intention to include or not to include the work under study; a third possibility also exists, that of continuing the examination of the work. Under no circumstance is a recommendation to be considered as a certificate of authenticity or appraisal, and no justification will be provided for said recommendation.’&lt;ref name="Wildenstein Institute"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wildenstein-institute.fr/spip.php?page=wildenstein-catalogue-raisonne-catalogue-critique&amp;lang=en |title=Catalogue Raisonné, Critical Catalogue |website=Wildenstein Institute |accessdate=2014-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223131620/http://wildenstein-institute.fr/spip.php?page=wildenstein-catalogue-raisonne-catalogue-critique&amp;lang=en |archivedate=23 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy contrasts with the text of the letter from the Institute which was read out on the television programme about the Monet painting, in which the Institute appeared to reject the authenticity of the work.

Difficulties can occur when more than one catalogue raisonné is published for the same oeuvre. The work of the artist [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]] is the subject of at least five catalogues raisonnés.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Gareth (2013). {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404042512/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Modigliani-Institute-president-arrested/28490 |title="Modigliani Institute president arrested", ''The Art Newspaper'' |date=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Destruction of paintings ===

Even if there is no published catalogue raisonné for an artist there may be an organisation which publishes authentications of work which are regarded as having the same effect as a formal catalogue. In the edition of ''Fake or Fortune?'' first broadcast in the United Kingdom on 2 February 2014, an example of such a committee was featured. The subject of the programme was a painting which bore a signature reading "[[Marc Chagall]]" thus implying that it had been painted by the Russian-French artist of that name. It had been included in a reference work on the painter, but not in the most recent edition of that work, and forensic tests showed that it was painted with pigments not available at the time it was purported to have been executed. Despite this uncertain evidence of authenticity the makers of the programme submitted it to a group referred to as the "Chagall Committee", which includes descendants of the artist. This committee ruled that the painting is a fake and sought its destruction either with the agreement of the owner or, failing that, by court order under the French law of [[Droit moral]].&lt;ref&gt;Alberge, Dalya (1 February 2014). "[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/feb/01/chagall-could-be-furnt-fortune-or-fake The man whose 'real Chagall' could now be burnt as a fake], ''Guardian.com'' (2014/02/01).&lt;/ref&gt; The art historian Dr [[Bendor Grosvenor]] criticised the Chagall Committee's decision to seek the destruction of the painting, &lt;ref&gt;(2014). "[http://www.arthistorynews.com/articles/2641_Mon_Dieu__le_feu_ctd Mon Dieu - le feu! (ctd.)]", ''Art History News''.&lt;/ref&gt; which contrasts with the policy of the Wildenstein Institute when works are submitted to it: 'Whatever the committee's recommendation, the work will be returned upon presentation of the consignment receipt'.&lt;ref name="Wildenstein Institute"/&gt; Presenter and art dealer [[Philip Mould]] said "I would now [think] three times or more before sending it to Paris. Ugly acts like the one proposed by the Committee can have the effect of damaging the progress of art history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/10612704/Philip-Mould-burning-fake-paintings-could-damage-art-history.html |title=Burning fake paintings could damage art history |first=Philip |last=Mould |newspaper=Telegraph |date=2 Feb 2014 |accessdate=9 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8774">The term '''children's literature criticism''' includes both generalist discussions of the relationship between [[children's literature]] and [[literary theory]] and literary analyses of a specific works of children's literature.  Some academics consider [[young adult literature]] to be included under the rubric of 'children's literature.'

Nearly every school of theoretical thought has been applied to children's literature, most commonly [[Reader-response criticism|reader response]] (Chambers 1980) and [[New Criticism|new criticism]].  However, other schools have been applied in controversial and influential ways, including [[Orientalism]] (Nodelman 1992), [[Feminist literary criticism|feminist theory]] (Paul 1987), [[Postmodern literature|postmodernism]] (Stevenson 1994), [[structuralism]] (Neumeyer 1977), [[post-structuralism]] (Rose, 1984, Lesnik-Oberstein, 1994) and many others.

== Approaches ==

=== Child focused ===
Early children's literature critics aimed to learn how children read literature specifically (rather than the mechanics of reading itself) so that they could recommend "good books" for children. These early critics were often teachers, librarians and other educationalists. The critics often disagreed about what books they think children would like, and why, and about which books will be "good" for children and why. Though many critics are still child-centric, the discipline has expanded to include other modes of analysis.  As children's literature criticism started developing as an academic discipline (roughly in the past thirty years or so, see historical overviews by Hunt (1991) and McGillis (1997)), children's literature criticism became involved with wider work in [[literary theory]] and [[cultural studies]].

==== Construction of the child ====
Many children's literature critics now point out that children are not one group, but differ according to gender, ethnicity, religious background, and so on. Feminist children's literature critics such as [[Lissa Paul]] (1987) therefore try to work out how boys and girls read differently, for instance. Other critics (for instance, [[Peter Hunt (literary critic)|Peter Hunt]] (1991), [[Perry Nodelman]] (1992), [[John Stephens (literary critic)|John Stephens]] (1992), and [[Roderick McGillis]] (1996)) take this idea a step further and argue that children are often "colonized" by adults, including children's literature critics, because adults speak on behalf of children instead of letting children express themselves. However, these critics too can not agree on what then are "true" children expressing themselves, and which books are therefore "good" for them. Finally, a few critics, notably [[Jacqueline Rose]] (1984) and [[Karin Lesnik-Oberstein]] (1994 and 2004) take this discussion even further, arguing that identities are created and not "inherent", and that in the case of an identity such as "childhood" it is created by "adults" in the light of their own perceptions of themselves. That is, "adulthood" defines "childhood" in relation to differences and similarities it perceives to itself. This [[post-structuralist]] approach is similar to that argued by critics in [[gender studies]] such as [[Judith Butler]] and is widely accepted and used in [[sociological]] and [[anthropological]] studies of [[childhood]] (Jenks 1996; Jenks, James and Prout 1997).

=== Textual focus ===
Many scholars approach children's literature from the perspective of literary studies, examining the text ''as text'' without focus on audience.  Stephens and McCallum (1998) discuss the [[intertextuality]] of children's literature, while Rose explores the identifying characteristics of the [[genre]].  Nodelman (1990) looks at the synthesis of text and illustration in picturebooks.

=== Cultural studies focus ===
Culture studies scholars investigate children's literature as an aspect of culture.  Children's literature, in this light, is a product consumed like other aspects of children's culture: video games, television, and the like.  For more analysis of children's culture in general, see Jenkins.  For literature in particular as cultural artifact, see Mackey.

'''''Cliff Hanger''''' is the name of two different 1983 [[comic strip]]s, one published in the [[United Kingdom]] and the other in the [[United States]].

==British version==

The British ''Cliff Hanger'' was written and drawn by [[Jack Edward Oliver]]. It first appeared in the 25 June 1983 issue of the British comics magazine [[Buster (comics)|Buster]]. 

Watching a television show called 'Now Get Out of This' (a [[parody]] of [[Now Get Out of That]]), Cliff remarks that he thinks he could get out of everything. This is overheard by the '''Evil Spies''', agents of M.E.S.S. (the Mysterious Evil Spies Society). They tell Cliff that he's now a [[guinea pig]] in their traps, and if he doesn't survive, they'll know the traps will be good enough to use against secret agents.

From then on, the premise of the strip every week would be that Cliff is suddenly transported into a dangerous situation by the spies, using the Atomic Matter Transmitter. Three options would be presented to the readers, who would select one by ticking one of the boxes, and turning to another page to see whether their choice was correct or not. For example, in the first strip, Cliff is stranded on a moving artificial desert island. Just as it's about to hit the shore, the [[Ocean current|current]] changes and Cliff is driven back into the [[shark]] infested sea. The choices were 'Take off his shoe and use it to paddle the island to the shore', 'Pull out the tree and use it as a raft' and 'Climb the tree'. A and B were incorrect- using the shoe as a paddle simply sent Cliff round in circles, and pulling out the tree revealed it was plugging a hole, causing the island to sink. The correct answer was C, as Cliff's weight caused the tree to bend over onto the shore, lifting Cliff to safety.

The strip featured several minor background details that would occur in every issue, including a box with a handle, a plaster, the word '[[Acme Corporation|Acme]]', an arrow with another (backwards facing) arrow inside it, a [[warthog]], the initials 'JEO', a [[worm]], and a sign saying "Abolish Tuesdays". A running gag would feature one of the Evil Spies' constant wondering why his counterpart would frequently call him "Ray" even though that wasn't his name, when in fact he was simply referring to one of the gadgets ("Fire the Transporter Ray!").
Another thing of note is that Cliff's jumper often featured the strip number on it, starting with a "1" in the first, and going on well into the hundreds at the end. Over the years, several continuous storylines emerged featuring parodies of popular film and television series of the day, including [[James Bond]], the [[Star Wars]] Trilogy, [[Back to the Future]] and [[List of Transformers TV series|Transformers]]. The strip ended in 1987, replaced by [[Vid Kid]].

However, as Buster moved into the 1990s, the amount of reprints started to dramatically increase, and several old strips began to reappear. Cliff Hanger was one of these, though as J. Edward Oliver was still working for the comic, he was able to turn the originally black and white pages into full colour. With most of the readers unaware that these were reprints, this gave the impression that they were brand new. In February 1998, when the strips started being reprinted for a third time, rather than continue to advertise them as new, the '''Cliff Hanger Classic''' strand was started. Here there would be an afterword at the bottom of the strips, written by Jack, featuring factual information like the original issue dates, background details explained, the most popular television programmes of that week, or the top 5 of that week's [[UK Singles Chart]].

By 1999, virtually the entire comic featured reprints. Because of this, J. Edward Oliver decided to draw one final strip, which appeared in issue 118/99, dated 7–21 July 1999 (the comic had become a fortnightly publication in 1995). Finding the Evil Spies in danger, all three options led to the conclusion that the Evil Spies would never trap Cliff again (if Cliff called the police, the spies would be arrested, if Cliff helped them out, they would stop trapping Cliff as a gesture of thanks, etc.). This issue also featured the final appearance of 'b-mail', the name used at the time for the Letters Page (which Jack also wrote). Cliff's final appearance was in a cameo appearance in the last page of Buster's final issue, which occurred half a year later. Explaining how all the characters ended, and once again drawn by J. Edward Oliver, Cliff was seen mourning the passing of Bernie Banks (the lead character in [[Memory Banks (comic strip)|Memory Banks]], another Buster strip) who had apparently forgotten how to breathe. Symbolising that this was indeed the final issue, his jumper carried the word 'END'.

==American version==
The American ''Cliff Hanger'' was written by [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]] with artwork by [[Al Williamson]].  The title character was a swashbuckling adventurer who crashlands in an unnamed jungle region in the late 1930s and finds himself in a mysterious plot involving a secret research facility.  

The strip originally appeared as a back-up feature in the four issue run of [[Somerset Holmes]], a 1983 thriller [[comic book]] also by Jones and Williamson.  It has been reprinted in collections of Williamson's artwork.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6339">[[File:Prisme.jpg|thumb|right|White light split by a [[prism (optics)|prism]]. The additive primary colors are clearly visible.]]
There are two types of '''color mixing''': ''Additive'' and ''Subtractive''. In both cases, there are three [[primary colors]], three [[secondary colors]] (colors made from 2 of the three primary colors in equal amounts), and one tertiary color made from all three primary colors. This point is a common source of confusion, as there are different sets of primary colors depending on whether you are working with additive or subtractive mixing.

==Additive mixing==
[[File:Additive color mixing simulated.png|thumb|A simulated example of additive color mixing. Additive primaries act as sources of light.  The standard red, green, and blue combine pairwise to produce the additive secondaries cyan, magenta, and yellow. Combining all three primaries (center) produces yellow and white.]]
The additive mixing of colors is unintuitive as it does not correspond to the mixing of physical substances (such as paint) which would correspond to subtractive mixing. For instance, one can additively mix yellow and blue by shining yellow light together with blue light, which will result in not green but a white light. As in this example, one should always have the mixture of light in mind when considering additive color mixing as it is the only situation where it occurs. Despite being unintuitive, it is conceptually simpler than subtractive mixing. Two beams of light that are superimposed correspond to additive mixing.

By convention, the three primary colors in additive mixing are [[red]], [[green]], and [[blue]]. In the absence of color, when no colors are showing, the result is black. If all three primary colors are showing, the result is white. When red and green combine, the result is yellow. When red and blue combine, the result is magenta. When blue and green combine, the result is cyan. 

Additive mixing is used in television and computer [[Visual display unit|monitors]] to produce a wide range of colors using only three primary colors. A [[pixel]] is a juxtaposition of these three primary colors. Projection televisions typically have three projectors, one for each primary color.

==Subtractive mixing==
{{Main|Subtractive color}}
[[File:SubtractiveColorMixing.png|thumb|right|A simulated example of (idealized) subtractive color mixing.  An external source of illumination is assumed, and each primary attenuates (absorbs) some of that light.  The standard subtractive primaries cyan, magenta, and yellow combine pairwise to make subtractive secondaries red, green, and blue (which themselves are additive primaries, or in practice somewhat darker and less-saturated versions of typical additive primaries).  Combining all three primaries (center) absorbs all the light, resulting in black. For real pigments, the results would be somewhat complicated by opacity and mixing behavior, and in practice adding a fourth pigment such as black may be helpful.]]
The mixing of colored physical substances corresponds to subtractive color mixing, hence it corresponds to our intuition about mixing colors. To explain the mechanism, let us consider mixing red paint with yellow paint. The red paint is red because when the ambient light strikes it, the composition of the material is such that it absorbs all other colors in the visible spectrum except for red. The red light, not being absorbed, reflects off the paint and is what we see. This same mechanism describes the color of all material objects -- note that light is not a material object -- and so applies to the yellow paint as well. Making recourse to the figure above demonstrating additive color mixing, one sees that yellow light is composed of an (additive) mixture of red and green light. When we mix the two paints, the resulting substance has red paint and yellow paint. The yellow paint absorbs all colors except for red and green. However, the red paint will absorb the green reflected by the yellow paint. The red paint can be said to subtract the green from the yellow paint. The resulting paint reflects only red light and so appears red to our eyes. Note however that this description is theoretical and that the mixing of [[pigment]]s does not correspond to ideal subtractive color mixing because some light from the subtracted color is still being reflected by one component of the original paint. This results in a darker and desaturated color compared to the color that would be achieved with ideal filters.

The three primary colors in subtractive mixing that produce the largest [[gamut]] are [[yellow]], [[magenta]] and [[cyan]], leading to the [[CMYK color model]] widely used in color printing. Historically, painters have used [[RYB color model|yellow, red and blue]] in place of these, resulting in reduced gamut. In subtractive mixing of color, the absence of color is white and the presence of all three primary colors is black. The secondary colors are the same as the primary colors from additive mixing, and vice versa. This is not an accident. By mixing additive secondary colors subtractively one can reachieve the primary additive colors. Subtractive mixing is used to create a variety of colors when [[printing]] on paper by combining a small number of [[ink]] colors, and also when painting. Red is created by mixing magenta and yellow (removing green and blue). Green is created by mixing cyan and yellow (removing red and blue respectively). Blue is created by mixing cyan and magenta (removing red and green). Black can be approximated by mixing cyan, magenta, and yellow, although real pigments are not ideal and so pure black is nearly impossible to achieve.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1362">In [[engraving]], a '''counterproof''' is a [[Printmaking|print]] taken off from another just printed, which, by being passed through the [[printing press|press]], gives a copy in reverse, and of course in the same position as that of the plate from which the first was printed, the object being to enable the [[engraver]] to inspect the state of the [[Offset printing|plate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WD1913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Counterproofing was used to produce the finest quality [[Intaglio printing|copperplate]] printing; the second print consisted of delicate lines, and lacked the [[beveled]] impressions seen in the original print.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.lindahall.org/events_exhib/exhibit/exhibits/womenswork/printing.shtml Counterproof] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807080412/http://www.lindahall.org/events_exhib/exhibit/exhibits/womenswork/printing.shtml |date=2007-08-07 }}". ''Women's Work: Printing Techniques''. Linda Hall Library of Science, Engineering &amp; Technology. 2005. Retrieved 2007-05-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

To ''counter-prove'' is also to pass a design in [[Graphite|black lead]] or [[Sanguine|red chalk]] through the press, after having moistened with a sponge both that and the [[paper]] on which the counterproof is to be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cyclopaedia 1728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4420">'''David Petrovich Shterenberg''' ([[Russian language|Russian]] {{lang|ru|Давид Петрович Штеренберг}}; b. {{OldStyleDate|July 26|1881|July 14}} [[Zhytomyr|Zhitomir]], d. May 1, 1948 [[Moscow]]) was a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]]-born [[Russian people|Russian]] [[Painting|painter]] and [[graphic artist]].

==Life==
Born to a [[Jewish]] family in Zhitomir, [[Ukraine]], Shterenberg studied art in [[Odessa]] and then from 1906-1912 based himself in [[Paris]] where he studied with, amongst others, [[Kees van Dongen]].{{fact|date=July 2017}}
He studied at the [[Académie Vitti]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|ref={{harvid|Vitti, ??-??}}
 |title=Vitti, ??-??|publisher=University of Glasgow|work=The Correspondence of James McNeill Whistler
 |url=http://www.whistler.arts.gla.ac.uk/correspondence/people/biog/?bid=Vitti_1&amp;initial=V|accessdate=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was influenced by the works of [[Paul Cézanne]] and by [[Cubism]]. 

He made return visits to Russia but did not settle there until after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Revolution of 1917]], when he was supported by his acquaintance [[Lunacharsky]], who was the [[People's Commissar]] responsible for culture. He attended the ''Conference of Authors, Artists and Directors'' on cooperation with the Soviet Government at the [[Smolny]] Palace  in [[Petrograd]] (St.Petersburg) with [[Nathan Altman]] and others . In 1917 -1918 he was a Commissar for Artistic Matters. In 1918 he had an exhibition with the group ''Jewish Society for the Furthering of the Arts'' together with Baranoff-Rossine, Altman, and [[Lissitzky]], in Moscow. From 1918 to 1920 he was the Head of the Department of Fine Arts (IZO) of the People's Commissariat of Enlightenment (NARKOMPROS). In 1918 he published his programmatic essay ''Tasks of Contemporary Art'' in the News of the Petrograd Council. 

In 1920 Shterenberg was the Director of the [[People%27s_Commissariat_for_Education#Izo-Narkompros|Department of Fine Arts (IZO)]] at the People's Commissariat for Education. In this rile he organised the funding of the [[Moscow]] based [[Institute of Artistic Culture]] (INKhUK). He explained that "We organised the INKhUK as a cell for the determination of scientific hypotheses on matters of art".&lt;ref name="Gough"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gough|first1=Maria|title=The Artist as Producer: Russian Constructivism in Revolution|date=2005|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520226180|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Artist_as_Producer.html?id=KCJHxeNQuGMC|accessdate=10 February 2018|language=en}}{{rp|23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1920 to 1930 Shterenberg taught at the [[VKhUTEMAS]]. He showed at an exhibition of Jewish artists in Moscow in 1922 which also featured [[Marc Chagall]]. In the same year he wrote an essay for the catalogue of the ''First Russian Art Exhibition'' at the Gallery van Diemen, in [[Berlin]]. However his independent style ceased to find favour with the Soviet authorities and gradually his work was withdrawn from public view. After the 1930s he was forced to work in a more 'realistic' style. By his death in 1948 he was virtually forgotten. He is buried in [[Vagankovo Cemetery]] in Moscow.
 
Shterenberg was deeply conscious of his Jewish roots. He wrote to his wife Nadezhda: 'I have an Oriental blood in my veins, blood of my forebears who wrote the '[[Song of Songs]]', - and there's no better song.'&lt;ref&gt;''Lazarev, (2000), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;'

Today his work is on view in public galleries in Moscow ([[Tretyakov Gallery]] and [[Pushkin Museum]]), [[St. Petersburg]] ([[Russian Museum]]) and [[Ekaterinburg]]. Much is still held in private collections in Russia.

The '''Dutch Design Awards''' (DDA) are a series of awards to honor [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[designer]]s. The awards are handed out during the annual [[Dutch Design Week]] in the Dutch city of [[Eindhoven]]. A year book and exhibition of the nominated designs are also presented as part of the event. The Dutch Design Awards are organised by the Dutch Design Award Foundation and the city of Eindhoven.

De Dutch Design Awards have been handed out since 2003. In 2008, the name was changed from the [[Dutch language|Dutch-language]] ''Nederlandse Design Prijzen'' to the current name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nederlandsedesignprijzen.nl/downloads/Press_release_new_name.pdf Dutch Design Awards: the new name of the Nederlandse Design Prijzen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724162021/http://www.nederlandsedesignprijzen.nl/downloads/Press_release_new_name.pdf |date=2011-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty prizes are handed out during an annual awards show. In addition to the main prize, the Golden Eye, which honours the most successful Dutch designer or design studio, awards are handed out in a number of categories. Each category has its own selection committee, and the winners are selected by an international jury. One exception is the public award, the Audi Design Award; the winner of this prize is chosen from a shortlist by means of a public election held on the Web site of the Dutch Design Awards and in the [[De Bijenkorf|Bijenkorf]] department store in Eindhoven.

In 2009, the awards were presented on October 17 at [[Muziekcentrum Frits Philips]] in Eindhoven. The main prize, the Golden Eye, went to Studio Wieki Somers ([[Wieki Somers]] and [[Dylan van den Berg]]) for their ''Merry-go-round Coat Rack'', a [[carousel]]-like construction to hang coats, designed for the [[cloakroom]] of  [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]]. During the awards ceremony, the first edition of the Dutch Design Jaarboek was presented to Eindhoven mayor [[Rob van Gijzel]]. The nominated designs were exhibited from October 17 to 25 at the Brainport Greenhouse, a large glass greenhouse on [[Stadhuisplein]] square in Eindhoven.

==Biography==
Elena Garro was born to a Spanish father and a Mexican mother. She spent her childhood in [[Mexico City]] but moved to [[Iguala]], [[Guerrero]], during the [[Cristero War]]. She studied literature, choreography and theater in the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] in Mexico City, where she was an active member of Julio Bracho's theatre group. She married Octavio Paz in 1937 and began a career in literature and theater. Garro's fiction involved political and social causes related to life in Mexico. Her citizenship status and focus on Indian rights was controversial in Mexico. After her divorce from Paz in 1959, Garro spent time in seclusion between Madrid and Paris in Europe until moving back to [[Cuernavaca]], Mexico in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Cortes and Barrea-Marlys.

The '''''Fano Altarpiece''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist [[Pietro Perugino]], executed in 1497, and housed in the church of  Santa Maria Nuova, [[Fano]], central Italy. It also includes a [[lunette]] with a ''Pietà'' and several [[predella]] panels.

Perugino had already painted an ''[[Annunciation (Perugino, Fano)|Annunciation]]'' in 1488-1490. Several scholars have supposed that a young [[Raphael]] collaborated on the predella.
[[File:Pietro Perugino cat45a.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Lunette.]]

==Description==
The Madonna is portrayed on a luminous landscape of hills, on a high throne; in front of her is a pedestal with, on it, a mystic vase, and featuring the signature and date, which were always added by Perugino when the painting was produced in his workshop and then shipped to the destination. Mary holds the Child in the same fashion of the [[Decemviri Altarpiece]] of 1495-1496.

At the sides are the saints John the Baptist (with a camel skin and a stick with the cross), [[St. Louis of Toulouse|Louis of Toulouse]], who wears a bishop dress, Francis of Assisi (reading), Peter with the Keys of Heaven, Paul (with a long beard and a red vest) and Mary Magdalene with offerings to the Madonna. The portico is a typical element of Perugino's paintings of the period, such as the [[Albani Torlonia Polyptych]]; also typical of his late works is the Madonna's figure as a more mature woman, different than the elegantly youthful portrayal painted before. Less usual are the differentiated proportions of the saints and of the Madonna herself.

The lunette depicts Jesus raised from his sepulchre  by [[Joseph of Arimathea]] and Nicodemus, with Mary and John the Apostle at the sides. The predella includes the scenes of the ''Nativity of Mary'', the ''Presentation of Jesus at the Temple'', the ''Marriage of the Virgin'', the ''Annunciation'' and the ''Assumption''. In these secondary paintings Perugino used some of his typical themes, including the portico and the oval in a valley.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4927">Although elements of '''fashion design copyright''' may be traced in Europe to as early as the 15th century, &lt;ref name= salmon/&gt; as of [[as of|2016]] most countries (including the United States and the United Kingdom) [[fashion design]] does not have the same protection as other creative works (art, film, literature, etc.), because [[apparel]] (clothes, shoes, handbags, etc.) are classified as "functional items", excluded from protection by [[copyright law]]s. This explains the success of the [[knockoff]] businesses to the detriment of both the established labels, as well as of emerging designers, the latter ones being especially damaged, because they rely on relatively few designs.&lt;ref name=BoF20160314&gt;[https://www.businessoffashion.com/community/voices/discussions/what-is-the-real-cost-of-copycats/fashions-copycat-economy "What are the consequences of copycats?"], by Helena Pike, March 14, 2016, ''Business of Fashion''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
French king [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] &lt;ref name= salmon&gt;Salmon, J.H.M. "Francis I (France)." Encyclopedia. Issues &amp; Controversies. Facts On File News Services, n.d. Web. 4 Mar. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; gave out specific privileges related to the production of textiles. By 1711, in Lyon, illegalities were already being defined in regards to fashion materials, and in 1787, in England and Scotland fashion designers had fruitfully pushed their needs for protection into basic legislation. In 1876 Germany began protecting fashion patterns as well as models, and in 2002 European regulation on designs that were new and provided an aspect of fresh character or aesthetic were brought under protection.&lt;ref&gt;(Fischer Par. 8)&lt;/ref&gt; From 2004 to 2006 the “total production volume for clothing decreased by about 5% each year… [and by] 2006 the European union trade deficit for clothing was at 33.7 billion.”&lt;ref&gt;(Fischer Par. 2)&lt;/ref&gt; These statistics show that while there are benefits of their advanced design legislation, the economic and external factors still hindered their industry growth in ways the U.S. can empathize with. As 2007 came to a close, WIPO, or the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], had registered twenty-nine international designs.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Fridolin. “Design Law in the European Fashion Sector” WIPO February 2008. Web. 10 Feb 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current regulation==
There are some elements of protection of fashion design, with limited effectiveness.  The copyright law covers creative elements of fashion designs, such as print patterns. [[Trademark law]] protects items with visibly displayed protected [[logo]]s. [[Intellectual property]] laws protect "[[trade dress]]", which is an appearance of a product which uniquely identifies its source to the level of a trademark.&lt;ref name=BoF20160314/&gt;

Some countries introduced other laws to protect fashion design, however the protection is inconsistent around the world.&lt;ref name=BoF20160314/&gt;

===European Union===
In the [[European Union]], the Creative Designs Directive and the European Designs Directive are in effect to protect new designs for three or five years.&lt;ref name=BoF20160314/&gt;

===United States===
{{main|Fashion design copyright in the United States}}
As of late 2015, fashion designs were not subject to copyright laws in the United States, and could not be copyrighted.&lt;ref&gt;"Protection for Fashion Design", Statement of the United States Copyright Office  before the Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property, Committee on the Judiciary, United States House of Representatives, 109th Congress, 2nd Session, July 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Fashion Design and Copyright in the US and EU", Michele Woods and Miyuki Monroig, Copyright Law Division, World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), Geneva, November 17, 2015. Web 25 Sep 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Several bills named [[Design Piracy Prohibition Act]] and some other similar ones attempted to introduce protection of [[apparel]].

== Societal impact ==
Resercher Johanna Blakley argues that the very lack of regulation of fashion design has allowed the fashion industry to do very well economically and has lead to the birth of [[fast fashion]] and a much faster changing of [[fashion trend]]s and has enabled pieces of clothing to become pieces of art. She also refers to [[Tom Ford]] pointing out that the people who buy cheap lookalikes are a different [[demography|demographic]] compared with people who buy the original very high end products and that while many exclusive designers get copied, also the high end designers often attribute the inspiration of their creations to following street fashion so the copying is a [[win-win game|two way street]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ted.com/talks/johanna_blakley_lessons_from_fashion_s_free_culture Johanna Blakley: Lessons from fashion&amp;#39;s free culture] TED Talk, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8481">'''Geocriticism''' is a method of [[literary analysis]] and [[literary theory]] that incorporates the study of geographic space. The term designates a number of different critical practices.  In France, [[Bertrand Westphal]] has elaborated the concept of ''géocritique'' in several works.&lt;ref&gt;See Westphal, ''La Géocritique, Réel, Fiction, Espace'', Paris, Éditions de Minuit, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, [[Robert Tally]] has argued for a geocriticism as a critical practice suited to the analysis of what he has termed "literary cartography".&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Tally's "Geocriticism and Classic American Literature" and ''Spatiality''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Some of the first expressly ''geocritical'' writings emerged from symposia organized by  Westphal at the [[University of Limoges]]. Westphal's foundational essay, "Pour une approche géocritique des textes"&lt;ref&gt;Available in French online at http://www.vox-poetica.net/sflgc/biblio/gcr.html&lt;/ref&gt; constitutes a [[manifesto]] for geocriticism.  Westphal's theory is elaborated in greater detail in his ''Geocriticism: Real and Fictional Spaces'', translated by Tally, who also provides a brief introduction.  But there are also many works addressing similar themes and using similar methods that might be considered geocritical, even if the term "geocriticism" is not used.

== Theory ==
In Westphal's theory, geocriticism is based on three theoretical concepts: spatio-temporality, transgressivity, and referentiality. 

The idea that space and time form a continuum ([[space-time]]) is a tenet of modern physics. In the field of literary theory, geocriticism is an interdisciplinary method of literary analysis that focuses not only on such temporal data as relations between the life and times of the author (as in biographical criticism), the history of the text (as in [[textual criticism]]), or the story (as studied by [[narratology]]), but also on spatial data. Geocriticism therefore has affinities with geography, architecture, urban studies, and so on; it also correlates to philosophical concepts such as [[deterritorialization]].
 
Following the work of [[Michel Foucault]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Henri Lefebvre]] and [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], among others, a geocritical approach to literature recognizes that representations of space are often transgressive, crossing the boundaries of established norms while also reestablishing new relations among people, places, and things. Cartography is no longer seen as the exclusive province of the state or the government; rather, various agents or groups may be responsible for representing the geographic spaces at the same time and with different effects. In practice, therefore, geocriticism is multifocal, examining a variety of topics at once, thus differentiating itself from practices that focus on the singular point of view of the traveler or protagonist. 

Geocriticism also assumes a literary referentiality between world and text, or, in other words, between the referent and its representation. By questioning the relations between a given space's nature and its actually existing condition, the geocritical approach allows for a study of fiction that points also to the theory of possible worlds, such as may be seen in the work on third space by the American geographer [[Edward Soja]] (''Thirdspace''). Tally's book ''Spatiality'', an introduction to spatiality studies in literature and critical theory, includes a chapter on geocriticism.

== Critical practices ==
Geocriticism frequently involves the study of places described in the literature by various authors, but it can also study the effects of literary representations of a given space. An example of the range of geocritical practices can be found in Tally's collection ''Geocritical Explorations: Space, Place, and Mapping in Literary and Cultural Studies''.

Geocriticism derives some of its practices from precursors whose theoretical work helped establish space as a valid topic for literary analysis.  For example, in ''The Poetics of Space'' and elsewhere, Gaston Bachelard studied literary works to develop a typology of places according to their connotations. Maurice Blanchot's writings have legitimized the idea of literary space, an imaginary place for the creation of the work of literature. One might also look at the developments of cultural studies and especially postcolonial studies, such as [[Raymond Williams]]'s ''The Country and the City'' or [[Edward Said]]'s ''Culture and Imperialism'', which employ what Said has called a "geographical inquiry into historical experience."&lt;ref&gt;Said, ''Culture and Imperialism'', p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Fredric Jameson]]'s concept of cognitive mapping and his theoretical engagement with the postmodern condition also highlight the importance of spatial representation and aesthetic productions, including literature, film, architecture, and design.  In ''The Atlas of European Novel, 1800-1900'', [[Franco Moretti]] has examined the diffusion of literary spaces in Europe, focusing on the complex relationship between the text and space. Moretti has also promulgated a theory of literary history, or literary geography, that would use maps to bring to light new connections between the texts studied and their social spaces.&lt;ref&gt;See Moretti, ''Graphs, Maps, Trees''.&lt;/ref&gt;  And, in his study of Herman Melville's literary cartography, Robert Tally has offered a geocritical approach to certain texts.&lt;ref&gt;See Tally, ''Melville, Mapping and Globalization''.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Geocriticism has intellectual and methodological affiliations with such fields as Literature and the Environment or [[ecocriticism]], regional literature, urban studies, sociological and philosophical approaches to literature, and utopian studies.

'''''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner''''' is a 1967 American [[comedy-drama|comedy-drama film]] produced and directed by [[Stanley Kramer]], and written by [[William Rose (screenwriter)|William Rose]]. It stars [[Spencer Tracy]], [[Sidney Poitier]], and [[Katharine Hepburn]], and features Hepburn's niece [[Katharine Houghton]].

The film was one of the few films of the time to depict an [[interracial marriage]] in a positive light, as interracial marriage historically had been illegal in most states of the United States, and still was illegal in 17 states—mostly [[Southern United States|Southern states]]—until 12 June 1967, six months before the film was released, roughly two weeks after Tracy filmed his final scene (and two days after his death), when [[anti-miscegenation laws]] were struck down by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]''. The film's [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-nominated score was composed by [[Frank De Vol]].&lt;ref&gt;Joel Whitburn, Top Pop Albums 1955-2001 (Menomonee Falls, WI: Record Research, 2001), 1018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is notable for being the ninth and final on-screen pairing of Tracy and Hepburn, with filming ending just 17 days before Tracy's death. Hepburn never saw the completed film,&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; saying the memories of Tracy were too painful. The film was released in December 1967, six months after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061735/|title=Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967)|author=Claudio Carvalho|date=12 December 1967|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-17-178/|title=2017 National Film Registry Is More Than a 'Field of Dreams'|publisher=|accessdate=December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:Hepburn tracy guess whos coming to dinner.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy as Christina and Matt Drayton]]

Twenty-three year old Joanna Drayton's unannounced early return from her Hawaiian vacation causes a stir when she brings her new fiancé to her upper-class family home in San Francisco. He is John Prentice: a 37-year-old Negro  (the 1967 dialogue uses the term [[Negro]] throughout) physician and medical professor, whom she met just 10 days prior, whose first wife and young son were killed in a train accident eight years earlier.

Joanna's parents – newspaper publisher Matt Drayton and his wife, art gallery owner Christina – are avowed liberals who have always instilled in her the idea of racial equality. Although they try to hide it, Joanna's parents and in particular her father are initially upset that she is planning to marry a Negro man. The Draytons' black maid for 22 years, Tillie, is even more horrified, telling Joanna that John is trying to "get above himself" by marrying a white woman, but Joanna
asks why it is okay that she loves Tillie but she shouldn’t love John, who is “just as black”.

The Draytons are unsettled by her engagement with John, since they never thought that her choice would be a Negro man, and further unsettled by John's decision that if Joanna's parents do not accept the engagement that day, then he will end it.

Adding to the situation is that Joanna, at first intending to join John in a few weeks in Geneva for their planned marriage ceremony, has now decided that she will join him when he leaves after dinner to fly to a meeting in New York City, then onward to Switzerland, where he is an assistant director with the [[World Health Organization]]. She has also invited John's parents to fly up from Los Angeles for dinner, so they can all become acquainted. Due to this invitation, what was intended to be a sit-down steak dinner for two turns into a meet-the-in-laws dinner party. Furthermore, John is forced to reveal that he had not yet told his parents of his intention to marry a white woman.

Matt's golf buddy, Catholic [[Monsignor]] Mike Ryan, stops by after Matt earlier cancelled their golf game. After learning of John, he shares Joanna's enthusiasm for the pending nuptials and tells her father as much. However, Matt says he cannot give the couple his blessing: he fears that Joanna will be hurt by the prejudice that John and she will surely encounter.

One of Christina's art gallery employees, Hilary, who had briefly met John and Joanna earlier in the day, stops by the Draytons' home to express her disapproval over the relationship. Though Christina is still unsure of her own feelings about the matter, she is so offended at Hilary's racism that she fires her on the spot. Later, when dressing for dinner, Christina shares with Matt her support for Joanna, even if it should mean having to fight her husband.

Cocktails at the Drayton home resemble a game of [[musical chairs]], as different permutations of parents and clergy and children gather and share their views about the situation, with the mothers generally expressing more faith in their children than the fathers. Universally, the parents express that more than a few hours are necessary for a proper decision.

Mrs. Prentice tells Matt that her husband and he, in growing old, have forgotten what it is like to feel romantic passion; if they remembered, they would see that as more important for their children than any racial problem.

When the elder Prentice tells John that he is making a huge mistake, John pushes back that his father thinks of himself “as a coloured man, (while) I think of myself as a man.”

After thinking about the situation, and his conversation with Mrs. Prentice in particular, Matt calls everyone together (including Tillie) to make an announcement. He says that it does not matter what everyone else may think about John and Joanna getting married; all that matters is that they love each other. The film ends with the two families and Monsignor Ryan finally sitting down to dinner.

According to Kramer,  Rose and he intentionally structured the film to debunk ethnic stereotypes. The young doctor, a [[typecasting (acting)|typical]] role for the young Sidney Poitier, was purposely created idealistically perfect, so that the only possible objection to his marrying Joanna would be his [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], or the fact she had only known him for 10 days; the character has thus graduated from a top school, begun innovative medical initiatives in [[Africa]], refused to have premarital sex with his fiancée despite her willingness, and leaves money in an open container on his future father-in-law's desk in payment for a long-distance phone call he has made. Nothing is made of the 14-year difference in their ages. Kramer and Rose completed the film script in five weeks.&lt;ref name="Andersen295"&gt;Andersen, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kramer stated later that the principal actors believed so strongly in the premise that they agreed to act in the project even before seeing the script. Production had been set for January 1967 and ended on May 24, 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, pp. 207, 211&lt;/ref&gt; Spencer Tracy was in poor health, and insurance companies refused to cover him. Kramer and Hepburn put their salaries in [[escrow]] so that if he died, filming could be completed with another actor. According to Kramer, "You're never examined for insurance until a few weeks before a picture starts. [Even] with all his drinking and ailments, Tracy always qualified for insurance before, so nobody thought it would be a problem in this case. But it was. We couldn't get insurance for Spence. The situation looked desperate. So then we figured out a way of handling it. Kate and I put up our own salaries to compensate for the lack of an insurance company for Spence. And we were allowed to proceed."&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, pp. 207-208&lt;/ref&gt;

The filming schedule was altered to accommodate Tracy's failing health.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, pp. 206-209&lt;/ref&gt; All of Tracy's scenes and shots were filmed between 9:00&amp;nbsp;am and noon of each day to give him adequate time to rest.&lt;ref name="Andersen295"/&gt; For example, most of Tracy's dialogue scenes were filmed in such a way that during close-ups on other characters, a stand-in was substituted for him.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracy's failing health was more serious than most people are aware of. According to Poitier:
"The illness of Spencer dominated everything. I knew his health was very poor and many of the people who knew what the situation was didn't believe we'd finish the film, that is, that Tracy would be able to finish the film. Those of us who were close knew it was worse than they thought. Kate brought him to and from the set. She worked with him on his lines. She made sure with [Stanley] Kramer that his hours were right for what he could do, and what he couldn't do was different each day. There were days when he couldn't do anything. There were days when he was great, and I got the chance to know what it was like working with Tracy."&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, pp. 231-232.&lt;/ref&gt;

A bust of Tracy sculpted by Hepburn herself was used as a prop, on the bookshelf behind the desk where Sidney Poitier makes his phone call. Tracy died two weeks after he completed his work on the film.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hepburn significantly helped cast her niece, Katharine Houghton, for the role of Joey Drayton. Concerning this, Hepburn stated: "There was a lovely part for Kathy [Houghton], my niece [...] She would play Spencer's and my daughter. I loved that. She's beautiful and she definitely had a family resemblance. It was my idea."&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, pp. 229-237.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hepburn, the role of Joey Drayton would be one of Houghton's first major roles as a young actress. "The part of my daughter," Kate said, "was a difficult one. A young unknown actress needs more opportunity to win the sympathy of the audience. Otherwise, too much has to depend on her youth, innocence, and beauty. She had one good speech to win the audience, but it was cut. Instead she only talks with her father about the differences between the principles he taught her and the way he's behaving."&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

Poitier frequently found himself starstruck and as a result, a bit tongue-tied, in the presence of Hepburn and Tracy, whom he considered to be "giants" as far as acting is concerned.&lt;ref name="Poitier286"&gt;Poitier, p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Poitier reportedly found a way to overcome his nerves. "When I went to play a scene with Tracy and Hepburn, I couldn't remember a word. Finally, Stanley Kramer said to me, 'What are we going to do?' I said, 'Stanley, send those two people home. I will play the scene against two empty chairs. I don't want them here because I can't handle that kind of company.' He sent them home. I played the scene in close-up against two empty chairs as the dialogue coach read Mr. Tracy's and Miss Hepburn's lines from off camera."&lt;ref name="Poitier286"/&gt;

Given the tense nature of racism in the United States during the time of the film's production, Poitier felt he was "under close observation" by both Tracy and Hepburn during their first dinner meetings prior to production.&lt;ref&gt;Poitier, ''Measure of a Man'', p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he managed to swiftly win them over. Due to Tracy and Hepburn's close history with Kramer, Poitier cited that Hepburn and Tracy came to bear on him "the kind of respect they had for Kramer, and they had to say to themselves (and I'm sure they did), this kid has to be pretty okay, because Stanley is nuts about working with him".&lt;ref&gt;Poitier, ''Measure of a Man'', p. 121-124.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
The film premiered in theaters on January 1, 1968. The film falls into the genre of comedy drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmcritic.com/reviews/1967/guess-whos-coming-to-dinner/ |title=amc filmcritic.com |accessdate=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released on VHS on December 12, 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parentpreviews.com/movie-reviews/guess-whos-coming-to-dinner/# |title=Parent Previews |publisher=One Voice Communications Ltd. |accessdate=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the 20th anniversary of the original release. The film was released on DVD on May 22, 2001.&lt;ref name=rottentomatoes /&gt;

===Reception===
''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner'' was a box-office hit in 1968 throughout the United States, including in Southern states where it was traditionally assumed that few white filmgoers would want to see any film with black leads. The success of this film challenged that assumption in [[film marketing]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Mark. ''Pictures at a Revolution: Five Films and the Birth of a New Hollywood''. Penguin Press, 2008, p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this success, which included numerous film award nominations, [[Frank Rich]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote in November 2008 that the film was frequently labeled as dated among liberals. Another main point of contention was the fact that Poitier's character, the golden future son-in-law, had no flaws and a resume of good deeds. Many people felt that the dynamic between the Draytons and Poitier's character would have inevitably resulted in a happily-ever-after film ending because Poitier's character was so perfect, respectable, likable, and proper. Some people went as far as saying Prentice was "too white" not to be accepted by the Draytons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rich | first1 = Frank | title = Guess Who's Coming to Dinner | journal = New York Times | page=10 | year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The release of the film in the U.S. gave Poitier his third box-office success in six months in 1967,&lt;ref name=rottentomatoes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/guess_whos_coming_to_dinner/ |title=Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=Flixster |accessdate=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which placed the race of Poitier's character at issue. The film grossed a total of $56.7 million.&lt;ref name=BOM/&gt;

In a 1986 review of the film by ''The New York Times'', [[Lawrence Van Gelder]] wrote: "the suspicion arises that were the film made today its makers would come to grips a good deal more bluntly with the problems of intermarriage. Still, this remains a deft comedy and - most of all - a paean to the power of love."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Van Gelder | first1 = Lawrence| title = HOME VIDEO; New Cassettes: Big Stars and Big Bands|journal = New York Times | page = 28 | year = 1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variant versions==
The original version of the film that played in theaters in 1968 contained a moment in which Tillie responds to the question "Guess who's coming to dinner now?" with the sarcastic one-liner: "The Reverend [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King]]?" After [[assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|King's assassination]] on April 4, 1968, this line was removed from the film, so by August 1968, almost all theaters' showings of this film had this line omitted. As early as 1969, the line was restored to many but not all prints, and the line was preserved in the VHS and DVD versions of the film, as well.

The plot explores similar themes to the 1958 play ''[[flame_in_the_Streets|Hot Summer Night]]'' by [[Ted_Willis,_Baron_Willis|Ted Willis]].

==Remakes==
[[Stanley Kramer]] produced and directed an unsold 30-minute [[television pilot]] for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]] with the same title and premise in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Debolt, Abbe A. |editor2=Baugess, James S. |title=Encyclopedia of the Sixties: A Decade of Culture and Counterculture: A Decade of Culture and Counterculture|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1-440-80102-9|page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, comedian [[Daniele Luttazzi]] published the screenplay ''[[Tabu (2003 film)|Tabù]]'', an almost [[Wiktionary:verbatim|verbatim]] [[Parody film|parody]] of the film. In the variation, the engaged lovers are aged 40 (him) and 12 (her), and are brother and sister.&lt;ref name="Luttazzi03"&gt;[[Daniele Luttazzi]] (2003) ''La castrazione e altri metodi infallibili per prevenire l'acne'', Feltrinelli, pp. 155-233.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005 film ''[[Guess Who (film)|Guess Who]]'' starring [[Ashton Kutcher]] and [[Bernie Mac]] is a loose remake styled as a comedy rather than a drama, with the racial roles reversed: black parents are caught off-guard when their daughter brings home the young white man she has chosen to marry. Talking about the film, Bernie Mac told ''[[USA Today]]'' in 2003, "Interracial dating is not that significant anymore." In the article, the writer cites that during the time at which the original movie was filmed, "interracial marriage was considered risky." Casting for Mac's remake of the film began in November 2003. Mac said of the script, "They want to make it a comedy, but I won't disrespect Spencer, Katharine or Sidney."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = Karen | title = Bernie will be Spencer in new 'Coming to Dinner' | journal = USA Today | year = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish writer [[Roddy Doyle]] wrote a short story by the same title about an Irish girl who brings home an immigrant from Nigeria, published in 2008 in the collection ''[[The Deportees and Other Stories|The Deportees]]''.&lt;ref name="NYT Review"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wagner|first=Erica|title=White Irish Need Not Apply|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/books/review/Wagner-t.html|accessdate=1 March 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot is very similar to another film, ''[[Crossroads (1957 film)|Crossroads]]'', made by the Canadian director Don Haldane a decade earlier in 1957. In this film, a young white woman in Toronto surprises her mother with her black fiancé.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.nfb.ca/2012/06/18/crossroads-interracial-marriage-toronto-1957/ What’s Black and White and Shocking All Over?] Carolyne Weldon, National Film Board of Canada Blog, June 18, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was referenced in a 1988 episode of the sitcom ''[[Designing Women]]'' by Suzanne, who mistakenly calls it, "There's Some Black People Comin' Over for Dinner."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Reservations for Eight|series=Designing Women, Season 2|access-date=11 September 2017|series-no=2|number=22|minutes=30|quote="There's Some Black People Comin' Over for Dinner." |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episode ''Guess Who's Coming to Marry'' (season 2, episode 6) of the [[black sitcom]] ''[[Fresh Prince of Bel Air]]'', an aunt of the lead character introduces her fiancé, a white man, to the horror of her family.

'''Gwen Wetzler''' is an American [[Film Producer|producer]], [[Film Director|director]] and [[animator]] and is best known as the first woman to produce and direct [[animation]] for a major network.

==Early years==

At a young age while growing up in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], Gwen Wetzler found her love of art. During high school Wetzler would paint signs for local businesses because of her artistic ability and steady hand. In the early 1950s Gwen was married and moved from [[Pennsylvania]] to suburban [[Los Angeles]]. In 1955 she started in the animation business at [[Disney]]&lt;ref  name= "goerie"&gt;[http://www.goerie.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070909/LIFESTYLES06/709090362/-1/RSS Art House touts youth talent]&lt;/ref&gt; as an [[Inbetweening|in between]] [[animator]] on such classics as [[Sleeping Beauty]] and [[Lady and the Tramp]].

==Career==

In 1977, after 20 years at Disney, Wetzler became the first woman to direct and produce animation at major studios including [[MGM]], [[Warner Bros.]] and the [[Hanna-Barbera Studios]].&lt;ref name="goerie" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/mar/19/entertainment/ca-10274/3 |title=Move Over, Old Men - Page 3 - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=2000-03-19 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wetzler's directorial debut was on [[Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids]] which led to further projects. Other directed titles include [[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]], [[The New Adventures of Batman]], [[My Little Pony]],&lt;ref name="Beck2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerry Beck|title=The Animated Movie Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fTI1yeZd-tkC&amp;pg=PR17|accessdate=14 August 2012|date=28 October 2005|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=978-1-55652-591-9|pages=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Archie/Sabrina Hour, [[Flash Gordon]] and [[Sport Billy]] among others.

In the 1980s, Wetzler became the first woman to produce animation for a major studio; she produced [[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]], [[Jem (TV series)|Jem]], and [[The Legend of Prince Valiant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Angela | last = Randazzo | title = 'Salon' bonds and inspires artists | date = 6 Aug 2010 | url = http://www.simivalleyacorn.com/news/2010-08-06/Neighbors/Salon_bonds_and_inspires_artists.html | work = The Simi Valley Acorn | accessdate = 2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with directing, producing, and antimating series, Wetzler also worked on feature full-length feature films such as [[Mighty Mouse]].&lt;ref name="PaiettaKauppila1994"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ann Catherine Paietta|author2=Jean L.

Gwen Wetzler retired from the animation industry in the early 2000s, giving her time to focus primarily on her artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/artist/gwen-wetzler-p116528 |title=Gwen Wetzler movies, photos, movie reviews, filmography, and biography |publisher=AllMovie |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12700">{{Heraldic achievement}}
In [[Heraldry|heraldic]] achievements, the '''helmet''' or '''helm''' is situated above the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]] and bears the [[torse]] and [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]]. The style of helmet displayed varies according to [[Ranks of nobility and peerage|rank]] and [[social status]], and these styles developed over time, in step with the development of actual military helmets.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idWoodcock1988|Woodcock (1988)]], p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FD303"&gt;[[#Reference-idFox-Davies1909|Fox-Davies (1909)]], p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt; In some traditions, especially [[Heraldry#German-Nordic heraldry|German and Nordic heraldry]], two or three helmets (and sometimes more) may be used in a single [[achievement (heraldry)|achievement of arms]], each representing a [[fief]] to which the bearer has a right.  For this reason, the helmets and crests in German and Nordic arms are considered to be essential to the coat of arms and are never separated from it.

Open-visored or barred helmets are typically reserved to the highest ranks of nobility, while lesser nobility and [[burgher arms|burghers]] typically assume closed helms.&lt;ref name="FD303" /&gt; While these classifications remained relatively constant, the specific forms of all these helmets varied and evolved over time.&lt;ref name="FD303" /&gt; 
In [[ecclesiastical heraldry]], bishops and other [[clergy]] use a [[mitre]] or other rank-appropriate ecclesiastical hat in place of a helmet.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idWoodcock1988|Woodcock (1988)]], p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The evolution of heraldic helmet shaped followed the evolution of helmet design, especially [[jousting]] helmets, from the 14th to 16th centuries.
The [[armorial]]s of the second half of the 13th century do not include helmets. Helmets are shown as integral part of coats of in the first half of the  14th century (''[[Codex Manesse]]'', ''[[Zürich armorial]]''). These  helmets are still of the "[[great helm]]" type, without movable visor. 
Heraldic helmets become diversified with the development of dedicated jousting armour during the 15th and 16th century. The development is halted with the abandonment of jousting as a courtly practice, in the early years of the 17th century. From that period, the various types of heraldic helmet are purely driven by convention, and no longer tied to improvements  or fashions in [[Plate armour|armoury]].

The practice of indicating rank through the display of barred or open-face helmets appears around 1615.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idFox-Davies1909|Fox-Davies (1909)]], p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; 
As jousting with lances was supplanted by tourneying with maces, the object being to knock the opponent's crest off his helmet, the fully enclosed helmet gave way to helmets with enlarged visual openings with only a few bars to protect the face. These barred helmets were restricted by the imperial chancellery in Vienna to the nobility and certain doctors of law or theology, while the jousting helm was freely adopted by anyone.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idNeubecker1976|Neubecker (1976)]], pp. 148, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The direction a helmet faces and the number of bars on the grille have been ascribed special significance in later manuals, but this is not a period{{huh|date=November 2018}} practice.&lt;ref name="N148"&gt;[[#Reference-idNeubecker1976|Neubecker (1976)]], p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; A king's helmet, a golden helmet shown affronté with the visor raised, crowned with a royal crown, became adopted by the kings of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]].&lt;ref name="N148" /&gt; 

Historically,{{huh|date=November 2018}} the helmet was not specifically [[Grant of arms|granted]] in an achievement of arms, but was naturally assumed by appropriate rank as a matter of "inherent right", so a helmet with torse and mantling would not be misplaced even above a shield which had no crest to place above it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idFox-Davies1909|Fox-Davies (1909)]], p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; When multiple crests need to be depicted, the convention  in [[English heraldry]] is to draw the crests above a single helmet, each being separated from it, while in [[German heraldry]], where multiple crests appear frequently after the 16th century, each crest is always treated as inseparable from its own helmet and turned in agreement with the helmet.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idFox-Davies1909|Fox-Davies (1909)]], pp. 322-323.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In continental Europe, multiple helmets were usually turned inward, with the center helm (if an odd number) turned affrontê, while in Scandinavian heraldry the helmets were usually turned outward.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idFox-Davies1909|Fox-Davies (1909)]], p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Heraldic combinations were driven to extremes in the 18th century, e.g. the  arms of the last [[margrave]]s of [[Principality of Ansbach|Brandenburg-Ansbach]] ([[Charles Alexander, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach]], r. 1737&amp;ndash;1791) consist of a shield with 21 [[Quartering (heraldry)|quarterings]] topped with a record thirteen helmets and crests.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idNeubecker1976|Neubecker (1976)]], p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

==By traditions==
===General===
&lt;gallery class="center"&gt;
 File:Meuble héraldique Heaume comte.svg| Open or barred helmet, reserved for members of the [[nobility]]
 File:Skraiste 3.png| Closed or tilting helm, used by medieval [[knights]], also adopted by English [[esquire]]s and [[gentleman|gentlemen]], as well as on [[burgher arms]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The usage of heraldic helmets in Britain is as follows: gold helmet with bars for the royal family; silver helmet with gold bars for [[Peerage of the United Kingdom|peers]]; steel helmet with gold bars for the non-peerage [[Scottish feudal barony|Scottish feudal baron]]; open steel helmet shown affronté  for [[knight]]s and [[baronet]]s; steel tournament helm for [[Scottish clan chief]]s; closed steel helmet for [[esquire]]s and [[gentleman|gentlemen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Iain Moncrieffe and Don Pottinger|title=Simple Heraldry Cheerfully Illustrated|date=1953|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Russia===
The norms of [[Russian heraldry]] regarding helmets diverge greatly from the Western European tradition. Alongside the traditional Western open helmet (silver with gold details for titled nobility, steel with gold details for everyone else), as well as the closed helmet sometimes granted by the state, "ethnic" helmets were also in use, not found anywhere else. From the 19th century onwards, ancient [[Ethnic Russian|Russian]] families began to use the [[:ru:Ерихонка|''yerikhonka'']], the "cap of Jericho", a medieval conical Slavic helmet similar to the Middle Eastern [[Lobster-tailed pot helmet|shishak]]. These followed their own colour system, not corresponding with the use of tinctures for Western helmets: non-titled nobles would use a steel ''yerikhonka'' with silver details, barons and counts steel with golden details, ''[[knyaz]]'' families silver with golden details. The [[House of Romanov]] itself used a unique ''yerikhonka'' called the [[:ru:Шапка_ерихонская_Михаила_Фёдоровича|"helmet of Alexander Nevsky"]], based on the royal helmet of [[Michael I of Russia|Michael I]] (once mistakenly believed to have belonged to [[Alexander Nevsky]], hence the name). Asian noble families [[Inorodtsy|non-Slavic]] origin who were integrated in the Empire were also allowed an ethnic helmet, usually a [[:ru:Мисюрка|''misyurka'']], similar to the ''yerikhonka'' in shape but rounder and with an obtuse tip. &lt;ref&gt;[https://sovet.geraldika.ru/page/17295 Структура герба: российская практика]. Медведев М.Ю. Геральдика // Специальные исторические дисциплины. СПб, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern [[Russian Federation]], the [[Heraldic Council of the President of the Russian Federation|Russian Heraldic Council]] allows both Western and ethnic helmets (called ''sheloms'' in modern Russian heraldic language), but only in their simplest forms, and stripped of any details that may be perceived as symbols of nobility. For Western helmets, this means using commoner [[kettle hat]]s as opposed to them more aristocratic open and close helmets, while ''sheloms'' are to be used without nasal bars, cheekpieces or neck guards, which were sometimes found on older "ethnic" helmets. On the other hand, a commoner helmet may be complemented with a [[mail coif]] below. All colours except for steel are forbidden, with the exception of the lining, for which other tinctures may be used ([[Purpure (heraldry)|purpure]] is recommended). ''However'', none of these restrictions apply to direct descendants of old Russian aristocracy, who can use the same helmets as their ancestors alongside the rest of their family arms. &lt;ref&gt;[https://sovet.geraldika.ru/article/23119 Основные принципы оформления личного герба в современной России]. Гражданская геральдика сегодня. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Both in Imperial and republican Russian heraldry, the direction of the helmet plays no role: whether the helmet is portrayed affronty or turned to the right depends on the shape of the [[crest (heraldry)|crest]].

&lt;gallery class="center" size = "300px"&gt;

 File:Skornyakov Coat of Arms.jpg| Closed Western helmet: coat of arms of the [[:ru:Скорняковы|Skornyakov]] family.

 File:Kopelev Arms.jpg| Commoner ethnic helmet: coat of arms of Vladimir Kopelev, knight of the [[Order_"For_Merit_to_the_Fatherland"|''For Merit to the Fatherland'']] order.
 File:Likhachev Arms.jpg| Commoner Western helmet: coat of arms of Nikolai Likhachev, citizen of [[Petergof|Peterhof]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Ecclesiastical===
In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], clerics entitled to a coat of arms use a [[galero]] instead of a helmet, which is considered too belligerent for men in holy orders.
&lt;gallery class="center"&gt;
 File:Template-Cardinal.svg| Galero gules with fifteen tassels per side, used by cardinals in place of a helmet (and patriarchal cross)
 File:Template-Archbishop.svg| Galero vert with ten tassels per side, used by archbishops in place of a helmet (and patriarchal cross)
 File:Template-Bishop.svg| Galero vert with six tassels per side, used by bishops in place of a helmet (and single-barred cross)
 File:Template-Priest.svg| Galero sable with one tassel per side (and blank shield), used by armigerous priests in place of a helmet
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the same way, clerics of the [[Anglican Communion]] entitled to a coat of arms use a similar black hat in place of a helmet.
&lt;gallery class="center"&gt;
 File:External Ornaments of an Archdeacon (Church of England).svg| Hat sable with cords purpure and three tassels per side, used by Anglican archdeacons in place of a helmet
 File:External Ornaments of a Dean (Church of England).svg| Hat sable with cords purpure and three tassels gules per side, used by Anglican deans in place of a helmet

The '''Hong Kong Visual Arts Centre''' ({{zh|t=香港視覺藝術中心}}) is located in [[Hong Kong Park]], at 7A [[Kennedy Road, Hong Kong|Kennedy Road]] in [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]], [[Hong Kong Island]], [[Hong Kong]]. It was opened by Leung Ding-Bong, then chairman of the [[Urban Council]], in 1992.

The centre encourages local art creation. It was restructured from an early 20th-century building called Cassels Block, a former barracks for married British officers of [[Victoria Barracks, Hong Kong|Victoria Barracks]]. It currently provides an area and facilities for local artists. It includes modern artefacts and sculptures.

The historic building is listed as a [[List of Grade II historic buildings in Hong Kong|Grade II historic building]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amo.gov.hk/form/historical.pdf List of Graded Historic buildings in Hong Kong (As at 6 Jan 2007)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709224215/http://www.amo.gov.hk/form/historical.pdf |date=2011-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based in [[Chennai]], [[India]], the academy was founded in January 1936 by [[Rukmini Devi Neelakanta Sastri]] and her husband Arundale. Under Arundale's guidance, the institution achieved national and international recognition for its unique style and perfectionism. In 1962, Kalakshetra moved to a new campus in [[Besant Nagar]], Chennai, occupying {{convert|40|ha|acre|abbr=off}} of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[File:Rukmini Devi.jpg|right|thumb|Rukmini Devi Arundale, founder of Kalakshetra]]
[[File:Secretary Clinton Visits a Music Classroom.jpg|thumb|left|A music classroom at Kalakshetra]]
Kalakshetra, later known as the Kalakshetra Foundation, was established by [[Rukmini Devi Arundale]], along with her husband, [[George Arundale]], a well-known [[theosophist]], in [[Adyar (Chennai)|Adyar]], Chennai, in 1936. She invited not only the best students but also noted teachers, musicians and artists to be a part of this institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tamilnation.org/hundredtamils/arundale.htm |title=Early years of Kalakshetra |website=www.tamilnation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Year-long celebrations, including lectures, seminars and festivals marked her 100th birth anniversary, on 29 February 2004, at Kalakshetra and elsewhere in many parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Another centenary celebration |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2003/01/27/stories/2003012700070300.htm |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=27 January 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on 29 February, a photo exhibition on her life opened at the Lalit Kala Gallery in New Delhi, and President [[A. P. J. Abdul Kalam]] released a photo-biography, written and compiled by [[Sunil Kothari]], with a foreword by former president [[R.

==Kalakshetra style==
Having studied the [[Pandanallur style]] for three years, in 1936 [[Rukmini Devi Arundale]] started working on developing her own, Kalakshetra, style of [[Bharatanatyam]]. She introduced group performances and staged various Bharatanatyam-based ballets.
[[File:Secretary Clinton, Leela Samson, and Ambassador Burleigh Enjoy a Bharat Natyam Performance (2).jpg|thumb|left|Bharatanatyam performance at Kalakshetra, during visit of Hillary Clinton, 2011]]
The Kalakshetra style is noted for its angular, straight, ballet-like kinesthetics, and its avoidance of [[Recaka]]s and of the uninhibited throw (Ksepa) of the limbs.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

According to Sankara Menon (1907–2007), who was her associate from Kalakshetra’s beginnings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Guru who inspired love (Sankara Menon’s centenary at Kalakshetra) |url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2007/09/28/stories/2007092850930100.htm |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=28 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rukmini Devi raised Bharatanatyam to a puritan art form, divorced from its recently controversial past by "removing objectionable elements" (mostly, the ''[[Sringara]]'', certain emotional elements evocative of the erotic, such as hip, neck, lip and chest movements) from the [[Pandanallur style]], which was publicly criticized by Indian dancer [[Balasaraswati|Tanjore Balasaraswati]] (1918–1984)  and other representatives of [[Tamil Nadu]]'s traditional Isai Velalar culture. Love outside parameters considered "chaste" was not to be portrayed. Balasaraswati said that "the effort to purify Bharatanatyam through the introduction of novel ideas is like putting a gloss on burnished gold or painting the lotus". Lawyer and classical artist [[E. Krishna Iyer]] (1897–1968) said about Rukmini Devi, "There is no need to say that before she entered the field, the art was dead and gone or that it saw a renaissance only when she started to dance or that she created anything new that was not there before".

{{styles}}
A '''style guide''' or '''style manual''' is a set of standards for the writing and design of documents, either for general use or for a specific publication, organization or field. The implementation of a style guide provides uniformity in style and formatting within a document and across multiple documents. A set of standards for a specific organization is often known as "house style". Style guides are common for general and specialized use, for the general reading and writing audience, and for students and scholars of various [[academia|academic]] disciplines, medicine, journalism, the law, government, business, and industry.

==International==
Several basic style guides for technical and scientific communication have been defined by international [[standards organization]]s. These are often used as elements of and refined in more specialized style guides that are specific to a subject, region or organization. Some examples are:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4535">The '''National Music League''' (NML) was an American arts organization based in [[New York City]] that was active during the 1920s through the 1960s. Founded as a non-profit institution in June 1925, the organization was dedicated to supporting and furthering the careers of talented young American classical musicians. While its goals remained the same, the organization became a for-profit incorporated institution in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F00C10F83E5F167B93C4A9178DD85F4C8485F9|title=From the Mail Pouch: Music League|author=[[Harold V. Milligan]]|date=June 6, 1948 | work=The New York Times}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert E. Simon]] served as the organizations president for many years and [[Leon Barzin]] served as vice president.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1948/05/30/archives/help-on-the-way-up-national-music-league-a-cooperative-gives-young.html?sq=%2522+National+Music+League%2522&amp;scp=1&amp;st=p|title=HELP ON THE WAY UP; National Music League, a Cooperative, Gives Young Artists a Start|author=[[Olin Downes]]|date=May 30, 1948 | work=The New York Times}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization ceased operations in the early 1960s.

The NML selected artists to support through annual competitive music auditions. Judges for the competition were leading musicians and teachers in the New York area, often pulling from faculty members at the [[Juilliard School]] and [[Manhattan School of Music]]. The only requirement to compete was that the artist be under the age of 30. Winners of the competition were then awarded by having a concert series organized and promoted for them by the NML, thereby helping them to gain wider public recognition. Artists who were supported by the NML included [[Josephine Antoine]], [[Frances Blaisdell]], [[Jean Carlton]], [[Risë Stevens]], and [[Thomas Llyfnwy Thomas]] among many others.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

In 1935 the NML presented a production of [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]]'s ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]'' at the [[White House]] after a luncheon hosted by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]. The cast notably included bass [[John Gurney (bass)|John Gurney]] of later [[Metropolitan Opera]] fame as Peter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0A17FA355B107A93C3AA1788D85F418385F9&amp;scp=6&amp;sq=%22+National+Music+League%22&amp;st=p|title=HAENSEL AND GRETEL' GIVEN IN WHITE HOUSE; Performance by National Music League Follows Luncheon Party of First Lady.|work=The New York Times|date=March 31, 1935}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1950 the NML began a partnership with the [[Jeunesses Musicales International]] in France which resulted in an annual foreign-exchange of artists. The program would allow an American musician the opportunity to do a concert tour throughout France and a French artist a United States tour. American musicians to have participated in the exchange program to France included [[Sidney Harth]] (1951-1952), [[Theodore Lettvin]] (1951-1952), [[Lillian Kallir]] (1953), [[James Wolfe]] (1954), [[Shirlee Emmons]] (1954), and [[Betty Allen]] (1955) among others. French artists in the program included [[Pierre Sancan]] (1951-1952), [[Philippe Entremont]] (1953, 1955), and [[Blanche Tarjus]] (1954) among others. The exchange program expanded in 1953 to include artists from Brazil, beginning with Brazilian pianist [[Oriano de Almeida]] in 1954 and Brazilian soprano [[Edmée Brandi]] in exchange for American soprano Shirlee Emmons (1953) and violinist [[Joyce Flissler]] (1955). The [[Gioventù Musicale d'Italia]] began exchanging artists with the organization in 1955, as did the government of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1955/08/21/archives/world-of-music-cultural-interchange-national-music-league-expanding.html?sq=%2522+National+Music+League%2522&amp;scp=2&amp;st=p|title=WORLD OF MUSIC: CULTURAL INTERCHANGE; National Music League Expanding Its Activities to Include Four Countries|author=[[Ross Parmenter]]|date=August 21, 1955 | work=The New York Times}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4465">The notion of '''postdramatic theatre''' was established by German theatre researcher [[Hans-Thies Lehmann]] in his book ''Postdramatic Theatre'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lehmann|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarising a number of tendencies and stylistic traits occurring in [[experimental theatre|avant-garde theatre]] since the end of the 1960s. The theatre which Lehmann calls postdramatic is not primarily focused on the drama in itself, but evolves a performative aesthetic in which the text of the performance is put in a special relation to the material situation of the performance and the stage. The post dramatic theatre attempts to mimic the unassembled and unorganized literature that a playwright sketches in the novel

Thus postdramatic theatre is more striving to produce an effect amongst the spectators than to remain true to the text. Lehmann locates what he calls 'the new theatre' as part of 'a simultaneous and multi-perspectival form of perceiving'; this, he argues is brought about, in large part, by a reaction to the dominance of the written text.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lehmann|2006|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new theatre, Lehmann asserts, is characterised by, amongst other things, the 'use and combination of heterogeneous styles',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lehmann|2006|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; it situates itself as after or beyond dialogue&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lehmann|2006|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and incorporates the notion of the 'performer as theme and protagonist'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lehmann|2006|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its most radical varieties, postdramatic theatre knows no "plot" at all, but concentrates fully on the interaction between performer and audience.

Another way of using the notion is to describe plays with little or no drama, for instance the plays of [[Jon Fosse]].

Some names associated with postdramatic theatre are [[Tadeusz Kantor]] ([[Krakow]]), [[Heiner Müller]] ([[Berlin]]), [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] ([[New York City]]), [[The Wooster Group]] ([[New York City]]), [[The Builders Association]] (New York City),  [[Richard Foreman]] ([[New York City]]), Big Art Group ([[New York City]]), [[Jan Fabre]], [[Jan Lauwers]] and [[Needcompany]], [[Frank Castorf]] (Berlin), [[Josef Szeiler]]/[[TheaterAngelusNovus]] (Vienna), [[Elfriede Jelinek]] (Vienna), [[Heiner Goebbels]] (Frankfurt), [[Verdensteatret]] (Oslo), [[Alvis Hermanis]] (Riga), [[Forced Entertainment]] (Sheffield), [[Teater Moment]] (Stockholm), the Apocryphal Theatre (London), [[The Sydney Front]] (Australia) and [[Socìetas Raffaello Sanzio]] (Italy), [[Navid Memar Kermani]] (Amta Theater Group-Iran).

A new wave of post-dramatic performance companies are troubling the work of those past. These companies include the likes of Pan Pan ([[Ireland]]), POST ([[Australia]]), Action Hero ([[United Kingdom]]), Nature Theatre of Oklahoma ([[United States]]), and more.

A new generation of internationally working postdramatic directors is changing the big picture: Among them are Thomas Luz, Amir Reza Koohestani, Susanne Kennedy, Dusan David Parizek, Yael Ronen, [[Simon Stone]], Kai Tuchmann, Anna Bergmann,Bastian Kraft,Ulrich Rasche, Niklas Stemann, and Kay Voges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmidt|first1=Thomas|title=The Post-Dramatic Turn in German Theatre|url=http://howlround.com/the-post-dramatic-turn-in-german-theatre|website=HowlRound|publisher=HowlRound|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ruth Lingford''' is an [[Independent animation|Independent animator]]. Since 2005, she has taught at the [[Harvard University]]. She now holds a position as [[Faculty (academic staff)|Faculty member]] in the Visual and Environmental Studies, where she is [[Senior lecturer]] and Director of [[Undergraduate degree|Undergraduate Studies]]. She previously taught at the [[Royal College of Art]] and the [[National Film and Television School|National Film and Television School, UK]]. Before investing herself in Animation, she was an [[Occupational therapy|Occupational therapist]] working with the elders and people suffering from [[mental disorder]]s. Lingford completed a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in Fine Arts and [[Art History]] at the [[Middlesex University|Middlesex Polytechnic (Middlesex University)]] from 1987 to 1990 and a [[Master of Arts|MA]] at the Royal College of Art until 1992.

== Animation Work ==

=== Early work ===
Lingford began her work in animation when she made ''Baggage'' and ''Crumble'' (both 1992) as part of her [[Master of Arts|MA]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Robinson, Chris. "Ruth Lingford: Old Halo Coffins Layered." ''Unsung Heroes of Animation''. Eastleigh, UK : John Libbey, 2005. 254–264. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Baggage'' and ''Crumble'' circulated in some film festivals, after their debut at the Royal College of Art's graduation show, including the [[Animafest Zagreb|Animefest Zagred]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.animafest.hr/en/2014/film/read_all/baggage|title=animafest.hr|website=animafest.hr|access-date=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:nl:Holland Animation Film Festival|Holland Animation Film Festival]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.haff.nl/en/persons/ruth-lingford?film=baggage|title=Person – Holland Animation Film Festival – HAFF|website=haff.nl|access-date=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Clermont-Ferrand International Short Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clermont-filmfest.com/index.php?m=131&amp;c=3&amp;id_film=100003470&amp;o=104|title=International Short Film Festival – Clermont-Ferrand|publisher=clermont-filmfest.com|access-date=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clermont-filmfest.com/index.php?m=130&amp;c=3&amp;id_film=100002926&amp;o=|title=International Short Film Festival – Clermont-Ferrand|publisher=clermont-filmfest.com|access-date=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After their limited festival run, and struggles to find stability, Lingford made ''What She Wants'' (1994) with funding of a grant from the Animate! programme (co-founded by [[imdbname:0036002|Dick Arnall]] for the [[Arts Council of England]]/[[Channel 4]]).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Pummel, Simon. "Thunder Under Oppresion." ''Animating the Unconscious: Desire, Sexuality, and Animation.'' Ed. Pilling, Jayne. London ; New York : Wallflower Press, 2012. pp.70–86. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; For ''What She Wants'', Lingford resorted to use her [[Amiga|Amiga 1500]] computer – having no access to animation equipments –, doing individual frames on [[Deluxe Paint]]. Lingford had learnt rudimentary usage of the computer in a workshop at the [[Royal College of Art|RCA]], when [[Traditional animation|hand-drawn animation]] remained the dominant technique.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Mitchell, Ben. "Interview: The Films of Ruth Lingford". ''Skwigly Animation Magazine''. Web. Retrieved 14 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; ''What She Wants''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s individual images were saved across approximately 20 [[Floppy disk]]s.

=== ''Death and the Mother'' and other acclaimed works ===
On her next project, Ruth Lingford was invited at the [[Museum of the Moving Image (London)|Museum of the Moving Image]], for an 'unusual' [[Artist-in-residence|residency]].  Developing a second commission for [[Channel 4]], ''Death and the Mother'' (1997), Lingford returned again to her primitive methods of [[computer animation]].&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Paul. "The Language of Animation." ''Introduction to Film Studies.'' Ed. Nelmes, Jill. London ; New York : Routledge, 2012. 254. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The creative process, however, would take place in full view of the people navigating through the museum : Lingford would be working in a glass room.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The film drew inspiration from German expressionist [[woodcut]], and catapulted Lingford on the international animation scene. Upon completion, in 1997, ''Death and the Mother'' won many awards, including one at [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival]] of the same year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The surface, content and reputation of ''Death and the Mother'' drew attention on Lingford from Orly Yadin and Sylvie Bringas. She was asked to collaborate on their project, ''Silence'' (1998), where Lingford would be working along Tim Webb on the animation of ''Silence''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s sequence.&lt;ref&gt;Winston, Brian. "Ça va de soi: The Visual Representation of Violence in the Holocaust Documentary." ''Killer Images: Documentary Film, Memory and the Performance of Violence''. Eds. Brink, Joram Ten and Joshua Oppenheimer. London ; New York : Wallflower Press, 2002. pp. 114. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Lingford worked on one half of the film which takes place in an animated [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]], while Webb worked on the second half, which takes place in [[Sweden]]. On ''Silence'', she returned to Deluxe Paint to draw preliminary images which were finished by Yadin.&lt;ref&gt;Lingford, Ruth and Tim Webb. "''Silence'': The Role of the Animators." ''Holocaust and the Moving Image: Representations in Film and Television since 1993.'' Eds. Haggith, Toby and [[Joanna Newman]]. London : Wallflower, 2005. 173–182. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the visual she partly built won ''Silence'' several important awards including : the Gold Hugo for Animation Short at the 1998 [[Chicago International Film Festival]] and the Grand Prix of the 1999 [[Odense International Film Festival|Odense Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Lingford's following project, ''Pleasures of War'', of the same year, moved against "the 'plastic' gloss-orientation of much computer-generated imagery".&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Paul. ''Animation: Genre and Autorship.'' London ; New York : Wallflower, 2002. 29. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps due to the success of ''Silence'', she approached novelist and [[Christian theology|Christian theologian]] [[Sara Maitland]], who Lingford remembered for her short story "The Swallow and the Nightingale"&lt;ref&gt;N.a. "Ruth Lingford: The Pleasures of War – Interview." ''Animating the Unconscious: Desire, Sexuality, and Animation.'' Ed. Pilling, Jayne. London ; New York : Wallflower Press, 2012. 77–78. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; (from her ''Far North and Other Dark Tales'' collection)''. Pleasures of War'' was scripted by Maitland, who also collaborated on the general design of the work, based on the [[Deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical]] [[Book of Judith]] – a story in which two women bargain sexual favours to protect their city from besiegers. Within the film are merged, [[collage]]d, [[Newsreel|newsreel footage]] from armed conflicts around the world, the victims of these conflicts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== From the 2000s onward ===
''The Old Fools'' (2002) was Ruth Lingford's following project, again, commissioned by Channel 4.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Bendazzi, Giannalberto. ''Animation: A World History: Volume III: Contemporary Times''. CRC Press, 2015. pp. 77. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an adaptation of the [[Philip Larkin]]'s [[List of poems by Philip Larkin|homonymous poem]] – written while her mother was in nursing home.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In terms of style, ''The Old Fools'' marks a departure from Lingford's computer-drawn evocative imagery ; its aesthetics rather combining [[Digital video|DV]] footage, drawings and [[typography]] animated in [[Adobe After Effects|After Effects]] and [[Corel Painter|Painter]]. With the [[Shynola|Shynola collective]], Lingford worked next on a music video for the music band [[Unkle]], ''An Eye for an Eye'' (2002). The collaboration was successful, and remained inlined with Lingford's previous imagery : "a sublimely creepy evocation of the biological drives and desires".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lingford also collaborated on a fellow Harvard professors' film: ''Secrecy'' (2008), where her animated sequences served "to create a contrast between imaginary and literal realms of the secrecy system".&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Mia P. "Directors Reveal Truth About 'Secrecy'." ''The Harvard Crimson''. Web. Retrieved 14 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, she animated sequences from another film – ''We Still Live Here: Âs Nutayuneân'' (2010) – by Anne Makepeace.

''Little Deaths'' (2010), Lingford's latest standalone work, begun after she received a 2008–09 Harvard Film Study Center Fellowship. In the pre-production process, she wanted to 'interview' people about their [[orgasm]]s. Lingford recalled she expected her interviewees to lack proper words to describe their private experiences, but they did not. She used their commentary, in "celebrat[ing] key aspects of our experience that are often suppressed," and continued to develop her experimental aesthetic of animation "to evoke the elusive physical and emotional experience of orgasm".&lt;ref&gt;Honess Roe, Annabelle. ''Animated Documentary''. Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire ; New York : Palgrave Macmillan, 2013. pp. 123. ''Palgrave Connect''. Web. Retrieved 13 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of recently, Lingford as been part of the band ''What Time Is It, Mr. Fox?'' for whom she has animated the song "The Ladies' Tree",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rockyneckartcolony.org/event/what-time-is-it-mr-fox/|title=Upcoming Events What Time Is It, Mr. Fox?|publisher=rockyneckartcolony.org|access-date=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sang as a [[Backup band|back vocalist]].

'''Smack Mellon''' is a non for profit arts organization located at 92 Plymouth Street, in [[Dumbo, Brooklyn]]. Smack Mellon supports emerging, under-recognized mid-career, and women artists through a highly regarded exhibition program, competitive studio residency, and technical support to realize new and ambitious projects.

==History==
Smack Mellon was founded in 1995 in [[Dumbo, Brooklyn]].  Since its inception the organization has produced numerous exhibitions, and presented the work of hundreds of artists in four different locations in DUMBO. 
In 1998 Smack Mellon began a partnership with the Walentas family and their company Two Trees Management.  At that time, Two Trees had a number of vacant historic, industrial properties throughout DUMBO and was interested in providing their spaces to not-for-profit organizations to use for cultural programming. From 1998 to 2005 Smack Mellon occupied a Civil War-era iron foundry, which had been turned into a spice milling and grinding facility in the 1950s. Since 2005 Smack Mellon has been located at 92 Plymouth Street in a former coal-fired boiler house that provided steam for heat and power to several industrial buildings in the neighborhood.

==Exhibitions==
Today, Smack Mellon’s Exhibition Program continues to advance public interest in the visual arts while providing opportunities for emerging and under-recognized visual artists whose opportunities for exhibition have been limited to realize ambitious projects. Smack Mellon enables roughly thirty artists each year - 60% of whom are women - to create and present large-scale work to the public in their 6,000 sq ft gallery. Smack Mellon features a wide range of work, including sculpture, installation art, painting, photography, film/video, and site specific projects. Smack Mellon provides opportunities for solo exhibitions to artists who do not have commercial gallery representation in NYC.

Previous exhibitions have included the critically acclaimed ''RESPOND,'' which was a direct response to the continued failure of the United States to protect its black citizens from police discrimination and violence, after learning of the grand jury's decision to not indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo for the death of [[Eric Garner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cotter|first1=Holland|title=Raging at Racism, From Streets to Galleries Smack Mellon and Grey Art Display Art Sparked by Politics|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/23/arts/smack-mellon-and-grey-art-display-art-sparked-by-politics.html?_r=0|accessdate=13 November 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=22 January 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150728100539/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/23/arts/smack-mellon-and-grey-art-display-art-sparked-by-politics.html?_r=0|archivedate=28 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sutton|first1=Benjamin|title=Brooklyn Gallery Responds to Police Brutality With an Open Call|url=http://hyperallergic.com/169898/brooklyn-gallery-responds-to-police-brutality-with-an-open-call/|accessdate=13 November 2015|publisher=Hyperallergic|date=18 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117033137/http://hyperallergic.com/169898/brooklyn-gallery-responds-to-police-brutality-with-an-open-call/|archivedate=17 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kuennen|first1=Joel|title=Smack Mellon's RESPOND and the New Imaginary|url=http://www.artslant.com/ny/articles/show/41814|accessdate=13 November 2015|publisher=ArtSlant|date=19 January 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205052551/https://www.artslant.com/ny/articles/show/41814|archivedate=5 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artist Studio Program ==
The Artist Studio Program at Smack Mellon provides urgently needed studio space and career building opportunities to artists wishing to live and work in New York City.  As rents continue to increase astronomically throughout the City, it is increasingly difficult, if not virtually impossible for artists to find affordable, appropriate studio space.  In response to the studio crisis faced by artists in New York City, Smack Mellon's Studio Program provides much needed workspace, and financial and technical support to aid artists in the creation of new work. Smack Mellon receives over 600 applications for six available studios each year. Expenses, including museum admissions, transportation and food, are paid during the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martinez, Alanna, Wyma, Chloe|title=A Guide to 20 Top Artist Residencies and Retreats Across the United States|url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/763138/a-guide-to-20-top-artist-residencies-and-retreats-across-the|accessdate=13 November 2015|agency=Blouin|publisher=Artinfo|date=16 March 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120043535/http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/763138/a-guide-to-20-top-artist-residencies-and-retreats-across-the|archivedate=20 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smack Mellon Studios, Studio Residency Program|url=http://www.artistcommunities.org/residencies/smack-mellon-studios-studio-residency-program|website=Artist Communities|accessdate=13 November 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117032234/http://www.artistcommunities.org/residencies/smack-mellon-studios-studio-residency-program|archivedate=17 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Smack Mellon’s arts education initiative, Art Ready engages young people in a way no other arts education program does, it pairs students directly with working artists; the students learn first hand over the course of a school year what it is to be an artist in the artist’s studio. The program operates during the school year and includes a series of studio visits with emerging and established artists; a series of field trips to museums and galleries; 2-3 art workshops; and a four-month arts mentorship. Art Ready connects up to twenty high school students with ten diverse artists, to gain practical experience working with professionals in a variety of artistic disciplines. The program is free for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Isa|title=Dyeing with Tara St. James + Smack Mellon girls|url=http://textileartscenter.com/blog/dyeing-with-tara-st-james-smack-mellon-girls/|website=Textile Arts Center|accessdate=20 November 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121014734/http://textileartscenter.com/blog/dyeing-with-tara-st-james-smack-mellon-girls/|archivedate=21 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Working as mentors, the artists provide professional and creative guidance as the students make decisions about their futures in the arts. Mentor/teaching artists also tutor the students in their creative process, introduce them to new ways of working, and engage them in continuous critical reflection. Art Ready truly prepares high school aged students for artistic careers and gives them practical experience working in a diversity of artistic disciplines.

The '''summa''' (word in Latin) is a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Didactic method|didactics]] [[literature|literary]] [[genre]] that was written in [[Latin language|Latin]]. This genre was born during the 12th century and was developed during the following centuries.

==Features==
It was a kind of [[encyclopedia]] that developed a matter about [[Law]], [[Theology]] or [[Philosophy]] most of all. Matters were divided in a more detailed way as it was in the ''tractatus'' ([[treatise]]), since they were divided into ''quaestiones'' (questions) and these ones were also divided into ''articles''. The articles had the following structure:

*1. Title of the article as a question and showing two different positions (''disputatio'').
*2. Objeccions or arguments against one of the alternatives, specially the one that defended the author.
*3. Arguments in favor of such an alternative, based on the [[Bible]], the [[Holy Fathers]] and so on.
*4. Solution, that includes arguments that combine faith and reason and that express the author's thought.
*5. The ''sententia'' or answer to the question, that consists in the refutation of the initial objections against the author's solution.&lt;ref&gt;Mateu Ibars, Josefina. ''Braquigrafía de sumas: estudio analítico en la traditio de algunos textos manuscritos, incunables e impresos arcaicos, s. XIII-XVI'' Barcelona: Edicions Universitat Barcelona, 1984 https://books.google.es/books?id=HsPEsH9MMX4C&amp;dq=suma+%22g%C3%A9nero+literario%22&amp;hl=es&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.es/books?id=kyley4JXgNEC&amp;dq=suma+%22g%C3%A9nero+literario%22&amp;hl=es&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Summae'' in the area of Law==

In the area of Law, the ''summa'' is a practical and didactic genre, that was developed from the methodology of the [[Gloss (annotation)|gloss]]. It was divided into two different literary genres: the summa (derived from the ''similia''), and the ''questio legitima'' (derived from the ''contraria'').

The ''summa'' was born in the minor Law schools whose aim was to instruct their students with easy summaries of the [[Justinian]] codes. In order to achieve this goal, easy, simple and systematic summaries of whole works were made, and the literary genre of the ''summae'' in the legal area was born.

The ''summae'' were developed specially in the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] schools of [[Occitanie]] specially regarding Justinian's ''Institutiones''.

==Some important legal ''summae''==
*[[Azo of Bologna]]'''s Summa Codicis''.
*''Summa Codicis'' written in [[Occitan language|Occitan]] and known as ''Lo Codi'', translated into Latin by [[Riccardo Pisano]].

==The ''Summae'' in the areas of Theology and Philosophy==
The teaching of [[Theology]] and [[Philosophy]] during the Middle Ages had two different ways: ''lectio'' and ''disputatio'':
* The ''lectio'' (lesson) was very similar to a present class. The teacher commented the sentences and doctrines of famous and known authors, such as for instance, [[Aristotle]]'s or [[Boethius]]' works, or [[Peter Lombard]]'s sentences. 
* The ''disputatio'' (dispute) was more informal than the ''lectio'', and was a real dialogue between teachers and disciples, where arguments in favour of or against any theses or subject were defended.
These two school methods originated their literary forms:
* From the ''lectio'', the ''commentaria'' (commentaries) were born. And these ones brought the ''summae'' about, which were freer and more autonomous and systematic than the ''commentaria''. 
* The ''disputatio'' originated the ''quaestiones disputatae'' (disputed matters), that gather the material of the disputes that were held every two weeks; and the ''quodlibeta'' (random questions), that gathered the disputes that were held in [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]]. This metodology of the ''disputationes'' was the technical model of the famous mediaeval ''summae''.&lt;ref&gt;Merino, J.A. OFM. Historia de la filosofía franciscana. Madrid. BAC. 1993, p. 13. {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some important theological ''summae''==
There are more or less sixty extant ''summae'' in this field. The following ones must be pointed out:
*[[Simon of Tournai]]'s ''Summa'' or ''Institutiones in sacram paginam'', 1165.
*[[Prepositinus of Cremona]]'s ''Summa de officiis'' or ''Summa de poenitentia''.
*[[William of Auxerre]]'s ''Summa Aurea'', 1220.
*Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]]' ''[[Summa Theologiae]], 1274.
*Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]]' ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]''.
*[[Alexander of Hales]]' ''Summa Theologiae'', 13th century.
*[[Gerard of Bologna]]'s ''Summa Theologiae'', 1317.
*[[Francesc Eiximenis]]' ''Summa Theologica'' (fragments). 14th century.

The [[angel]] of [[Death (personification)|Death]], pristine snow, and the dramatic poses of the characters all express symbolist longings for [[transfiguration (religion)|transfiguration]] “anywhere, out of the world.”]]

'''Symbolism''' was a late nineteenth-century [[art movement]] of [[French art|French]], [[Russian art|Russian]] and [[Art of Belgium|Belgian]] origin in poetry and other arts.

In literature, the style originates with the 1857 publication of [[Charles Baudelaire]]'s ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]''. The works of [[Edgar Allan Poe]], which Baudelaire admired greatly and translated into French, were a significant influence and the source of many stock [[Trope (literature)|tropes]] and images. The aesthetic was developed by [[Stéphane Mallarmé]] and [[Paul Verlaine]] during the 1860s and 1870s. In the 1880s, the aesthetic was articulated by a series of manifestos and attracted a generation of writers.  The name "symbolist" itself was first applied by the critic [[Jean Moréas]], who invented the term to distinguish the Symbolists from the related [[decadent movement|Decadents]] of literature and of art.

Distinct from, but related to, the style of literature, symbolism in art is related to the [[Gothic novel|gothic]] component of [[Romanticism]] and [[Impressionism (literature)|Impressionism]].

==Etymology==
The term "symbolism" is derived from the word "symbol" which derives from the Latin ''symbolum'', a symbol of faith, and ''symbolus'', a sign of recognition, in turn from classical Greek σύμβολον ''symbolon'', an object cut in half constituting a sign of recognition when the carriers were able to reassemble the two halves. In ancient Greece, the ''symbolon'' was a shard of pottery which was inscribed and then broken into two pieces which were given to the ambassadors from two allied city states as a record of the alliance.

==Precursors and origins==
Symbolism was largely a reaction against [[naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] and [[realism (arts)|realism]], anti-idealistic styles which were attempts to represent reality in its gritty particularity, and to elevate the humble and the ordinary over the ideal. Symbolism was a reaction in favour of [[spirituality]], the [[imagination]], and dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Balakian, Anna, ''The Symbolist Movement: a critical appraisal''. Random House, 1967, ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers, such as [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]], began as naturalists before becoming symbolists; for Huysmans, this change represented his increasing interest in religion and spirituality.  Certain of the characteristic subjects of the [[Decadent movement|Decadents]] represent naturalist interest in sexuality and taboo topics, but in their case this was mixed with [[Byron]]ic [[romanticism]] and the world-weariness characteristic of the ''[[fin de siècle]]'' period.

The Symbolist poets have a more complex relationship with [[Parnassianism]], a French literary style that immediately preceded it.  While being influenced by [[hermeticism]], allowing [[free verse|freer versification]], and rejecting Parnassian clarity and objectivity, it retained Parnassianism's love of [[word play]] and concern for the musical qualities of verse. The Symbolists continued to admire [[Théophile Gautier]]'s motto of "[[art for art's sake]]", and retained – and modified – Parnassianism's mood of ironic detachment.&lt;ref&gt;Balakian, see above; see also Houston, introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Symbolist poets, including [[Stéphane Mallarmé]] and [[Paul Verlaine]], published early works in ''[[Le Parnasse contemporain]]'', the poetry anthologies that gave Parnassianism its name. But [[Arthur Rimbaud]] publicly mocked prominent Parnassians and published scatological parodies of some of their main authors, including [[François Coppée]] – misattributed to Coppée himself – in ''[[L'Album zutique]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Album_zutique ''L'Album zutique'']&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Symbolism's most colourful promoters in Paris was art and literary critic (and [[occult]]ist) [[Joséphin Péladan]], who established the [[Salon de la Rose + Croix]]. The Salon hosted a series of six presentations of avant-garde art, writing and music during the 1890s, to give a presentation space for artists embracing spiritualism, mysticism, and idealism in their work. A number of Symbolists were associated with the Salon.

==Movement==
===The Symbolist Manifesto===
[[File:Henri Fantin-Latour - By the Table - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|[[Henri Fantin-Latour]], ''By the Table'', 1872, depicting: [[Paul Verlaine]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]],  Léon Valade,  Ernest d'Hervilly and [[Camille Pelletan]] (seated); Pierre Elzéar,  Emile Blémont and [[Jean Aicard]] (standing).]]

Symbolists believed that art should represent absolute truths that could only be described indirectly. Thus, they wrote in a very metaphorical and suggestive manner, endowing particular images or objects with symbolic meaning. [[Jean Moréas]] published the [[Symbolist Manifesto]] ("Le Symbolisme") in ''[[Le Figaro]]'' on 18 September 1886 (see [[1886 in poetry]]). The '''Symbolist Manifesto''' names [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], and [[Paul Verlaine]] as the three leading poets of the movement. Moréas announced that symbolism was hostile to "plain meanings, declamations, false sentimentality and matter-of-fact description", and that its goal instead was to "clothe the Ideal in a perceptible form" whose "goal was not in itself, but whose sole purpose was to express the Ideal."
:''Ainsi, dans cet art, les tableaux de la nature, les actions des humains, tous les phénomènes concrets ne sauraient se manifester eux-mêmes ; ce sont là des apparences sensibles destinées à représenter leurs affinités ésotériques avec des Idées primordiales.''

::(In this art, scenes from nature, human activities, and all other real world phenomena will not be described for their own sake; here, they are perceptible surfaces created to represent their esoteric affinities with the primordial Ideals.)&lt;ref&gt;Jean Moreas, [http://www.ieeff.org/manifestesymbolisme.htm Le Manifeste du Symbolisme], ''[[Le Figaro]]'', 1886&lt;/ref&gt;

In a nutshell, as Mallarmé writes in a letter to his friend Cazalis, 'to depict not the thing but the effect it produces'.&lt;ref&gt;Conway Morris, Roderick The Elusive Symbolist movement article – International Herald Tribune, March 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Techniques===
[[File:Étienne Carjat, Portrait of Charles Baudelaire, circa 1862.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Charles Baudelaire]], precursor of the symbolist style, c.&amp;nbsp;1862]]

The symbolist poets wished to liberate techniques of versification in order to allow greater room for "fluidity", and as such were sympathetic with the trend toward [[free verse]], as evident in the poems of [[Gustave Kahn]] and [[Ezra Pound]]. Symbolist poems were attempts to evoke, rather than primarily to describe; symbolic imagery was used to signify the state of the poet's [[soul]]. [[T. S. Eliot]] was influenced by the poets [[Jules Laforgue]], [[Paul Valéry]] and [[Arthur Rimbaud]] who used the techniques of the Symbolist school,&lt;ref&gt;Untermeyer, Louis, Preface to ''Modern American Poetry'' Harcourt Brace &amp; Co New York 1950&lt;/ref&gt; though it has also been said{{By whom|date=February 2013}}  that '[[Imagism]]' was the style to which both Pound and Eliot subscribed (see Pound's ''Des Imagistes''). [[Synesthesia]] was a prized experience{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed|date=December 2014}}; poets sought to identify and confound the separate senses of scent, sound, and colour. In [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]]'s poem ''Correspondences'', (considered to be the touchstone of French Symbolism&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, William. ''The Imagist Poem, Modern Poetry in Miniature'' (Story Line Press, 1963, expanded 2001). {{ISBN|1-58654-009-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;) also mentions ''forêts de symboles'' – forests of symbols –

:''Il est des parfums frais comme des chairs d'enfants,&lt;br /&gt;Doux comme les hautbois, verts comme les prairies,&lt;br /&gt;– Et d'autres, corrompus, riches et triomphants,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ayant l'expansion des choses infinies,&lt;br /&gt;Comme l'ambre, le musc, le benjoin et l'encens,&lt;br /&gt;Qui chantent les transports de l'esprit et des sens.''

::(There are perfumes that are fresh like children's flesh,&lt;br /&gt; sweet like oboes, green like meadows&lt;br /&gt;– And others, corrupt, rich, and triumphant,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;having the expansiveness of infinite things,&lt;br /&gt; like amber, musc, benzoin, and incense,&lt;br /&gt;which sing of the raptures of the soul and senses.)

and [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]]'s poem ''Voyelles'':

:''A noir, E blanc, I rouge, U vert, O bleu : voyelles…''
::(A black, E white, I red, U green, O blue: vowels…)

– both poets seek to identify one sense experience with another. The earlier [[Romanticism]] of poetry used [[symbol]]s, but these symbols were unique and privileged objects.  The symbolists were more extreme, investing all things, even vowels and perfumes, with potential symbolic value. "The physical universe, then, is a kind of language that invites a privileged spectator to decipher it, although this does not yield a single message so much as a superior network of associations."&lt;ref&gt;Olds, Marshal C. [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&amp;context=modlangfrench "Literary Symbolism"], originally published (as Chapter 14) in ''A Companion to Modernist Literature and Culture'', edited by David Bradshaw and Kevin J. H. Dettmar. Malden, MA : Blackwell Publishing, 2006. Pages 155–162.&lt;/ref&gt;  Symbolist symbols are not [[allegory|allegories]], intended to represent; they are instead intended to [[evocation|evoke]] particular states of mind.  The nominal subject of Mallarmé's "Le cygne" ("The [[Swan]]") is of a swan trapped in a frozen lake.  Significantly, in French, ''[[wikt:cygne|cygne]]'' is a homophone of ''[[wikt:signe|signe]]'', a sign. The overall effect is of overwhelming whiteness; and the presentation of the narrative elements of the description is quite indirect:

:''Le vierge, le vivace, et le bel aujourd'hui&lt;br /&gt;Va-t-il nous déchirer avec un coup d’aile ivre&lt;br /&gt;Ce lac dur oublié que hante sous le givre&lt;br /&gt;Le transparent glacier des vols qui n’ont pas fui!&lt;br /&gt;Un cygne d’autrefois se souvient que c’est lui&lt;br /&gt;Magnifique mais qui sans espoir se délivre…''
::(The virgin, lively, and beautiful today – will it tear for us this hard forgotten lake that lurks beneath the frost, the transparent glacier of flights not taken with a blow from a drunken wing? A swan of long ago remembers that it is he, magnificent but without hope, who breaks free…)

===Paul Verlaine and the ''poètes maudits''===
Of the several attempts at defining the essence of symbolism, perhaps none was more influential than [[Paul Verlaine]]'s 1884 publication of a series of essays on [[Tristan Corbière]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]], [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], [[Marceline Desbordes-Valmore]], [[Gérard de Nerval]], and "Pauvre Lelian" ("Poor Lelian", an anagram of Paul Verlaine's own name), each of whom Verlaine numbered among the ''[[Poète maudit|poètes maudits]]'', "accursed poets."

[[File:Eugen Bracht - Das Gestade der Vergessenheit (1889).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Eugen Bracht]], ''The Shore of Oblivion'', 1889]]

Verlaine argued that in their individual and very different ways, each of these hitherto neglected poets found [[genius]] a curse; it isolated them from their contemporaries, and as a result these poets were not at all concerned to avoid [[hermeticism]] and idiosyncratic writing styles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Verlaine]], ''[http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Les_Po%C3%A8tes_maudits Les Poètes maudits]''&lt;/ref&gt; They were also portrayed as at odds with society, having tragic lives, and often given to self-destructive tendencies. These traits were not hindrances but consequences of their literary gifts. Verlaine's concept of the ''poète maudit'' in turn borrows from Baudelaire, who opened his collection ''[[Les fleurs du mal]]'' with the poem ''[[Bénédiction]]'', which describes a poet whose internal serenity remains undisturbed by the contempt of the people surrounding him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Baudelaire]], ''[http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/B%C3%A9n%C3%A9diction Bénédiction]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In this conception of genius and the role of the poet, Verlaine referred indirectly to the [[aesthetics]] of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], the philosopher of [[pessimism]], who maintained that the purpose of art was to provide a temporary refuge from the world of strife of the [[will (philosophy)|will]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Delvaille, Bernard, ''La poésie symboliste: anthologie'', introduction. {{ISBN|2-221-50161-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy===
[[Schopenhauer's aesthetics]] represented shared concerns with the symbolist programme; they both tended to consider Art as a contemplative refuge from the world of strife and [[Will (philosophy)|will]]. As a result of this desire for an artistic refuge, the symbolists used characteristic themes of [[mysticism]] and otherworldliness, a keen sense of [[death|mortality]], and a sense of the malign power of [[human sexuality|sexuality]], which [[Albert Samain]] termed a "fruit of death upon the tree of life."&lt;ref&gt;''Luxure, fruit de mort à l'arbre de la vie... '', [[Albert Samain]], "Luxure", in the publication ''Au jardin de l'infante'' (1889)&lt;/ref&gt;  Mallarmé's poem ''Les fenêtres''&lt;ref&gt;Stéphane Mallarmé, [http://cage.ugent.be/~dc/Literature/Mallarme/Mal08.html ''Les fenêtres''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041209140346/http://cage.ugent.be/~dc/Literature/Mallarme/Mal08.html |date=9 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; expresses all of these themes clearly.  A dying man in a hospital bed, seeking escape from the pain and dreariness of his physical surroundings, turns toward his window but then turns away in disgust from

[[File:Félicien Rops - Pornokratès - 1878 (2).jpg|thumb|''Pornocrates'', by [[Félicien Rops]], etching and [[aquatint]], 1878]]

:''… l'homme à l'âme dure&lt;br /&gt;Vautré dans le bonheur, où ses seuls appétits&lt;br /&gt;Mangent, et qui s'entête à chercher cette ordure&lt;br /&gt;Pour l'offrir à la femme allaitant ses petits, …''

::(… the hard-souled man,&lt;br /&gt;Wallowing in happiness, where only his appetites&lt;br /&gt;Feed, and who insists on seeking out this filth&lt;br /&gt;To offer to the wife suckling his children, …)

and in contrast, he "turns his back on life" (''tourne l’épaule à la vie'') and he exclaims:

:''Je me mire et me vois ange! Et je meurs, et j'aime&lt;br /&gt;– Que la vitre soit l'art, soit la mysticité –&lt;br /&gt;A renaître, portant mon rêve en diadème,&lt;br /&gt;Au ciel antérieur où fleurit la Beauté!''

::(I marvel at myself, I seem an angel! and I die, and I love&lt;br /&gt;– Whether the glass might be art, or mysticism –&lt;br /&gt;To be reborn, bearing my dream as a diadem,&lt;br /&gt;Under that former sky where Beauty once flourished!)

===Symbolists and decadents===
The symbolist style has frequently been confused with [[decadent movement|decadence]], the name derived from French literary critics in the 1880s, suggesting the writers were self indulgent and obsessed with taboo subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisegeek.com/what-was-the-decadent-movement-in-literature.htm What Was the Decadent Movement in Literature?]&lt;/ref&gt; A few writers embraced the term while most avoided it. Jean Moréas' [[Symbolist Manifesto|manifesto]] was largely a response to this polemic. By the late 1880s, the terms "symbolism" and "decadence" were understood to be almost synonymous.&lt;ref&gt;David Schimmelpenninck van der Oye, ''Russian orientalism: Asia in the Russian mind from Peter the Great to the emigration'', New Haven: Yale UP, 2010, p. 211 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Kk8XrtXe3IcC&amp;lpg=PA211&amp;dq=decadence%20synonymous%20with%20symbolism&amp;pg=PA211#v=onepage&amp;q=decadence%20symbolism&amp;f=false online]).&lt;/ref&gt; Though the aesthetics of the styles can be considered similar in some ways, the two remain distinct. The symbolists were those artists who emphasized dreams and ideals; the Decadents cultivated ''[[wikt:précieux|précieux]]'', ornamented, or [[hermeticism (poetry)|hermetic]] styles, and [[morbid]] subject matters.&lt;ref&gt;Olds, see above, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;  The subject of [[Decline of the Roman Empire|the decadence of the Roman Empire]] was a frequent source of literary images and appears in the works of many poets of the period, regardless of which name they chose for their style, as in Verlaine's "''Langueur''":&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Langueur ''Langueur''], from ''Jadis et Naguère'', 1884&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Je suis l'Empire à la fin de la Décadence,&lt;br /&gt;Qui regarde passer les grands Barbares blancs&lt;br /&gt;En composant des acrostiches indolents&lt;br /&gt;D'un style d'or où la langueur du soleil danse.''
::(I am the Empire at the end of the decadence, who watches the large, white barbarians passing, while composing lazy acrostic poems in a gilded style in which the languor of the sun dances.)

===Periodical literature===
[[File:TheKnightAtTheCrossroads.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.2|[[Victor Vasnetsov]], ''The Knight at the Crossroads'', 1878]]

A number of important literary publications were founded by symbolists or became associated with the style. The first was ''[[La Vogue]]'' initiated in April 1886. In October of that same year, [[Jean Moréas]], [[Gustave Kahn]], and [[Paul Adam (French novelist)|Paul Adam]] began the periodical ''[[Le Symboliste]]''. One of the most important symbolist journals was ''[[Mercure de France]]'', edited by [[Alfred Vallette]], which succeeded ''La Pléiade''; founded in 1890, this periodical endured until 1965. [[Pierre Louÿs]] initiated ''[[La conque]]'', a periodical whose symbolist influences were alluded to by [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in his story ''[[Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote]]''. Other symbolist literary magazines included ''[[La Revue blanche]]'', ''[[La Revue wagnérienne]]'', ''[[La Plume]]'' and ''[[La Wallonie]]''.

[[Rémy de Gourmont]] and [[Félix Fénéon]] were [[literary criticism|literary critics]] associated with symbolism. The symbolist and decadent literary styles were [[satire|satirized]] by a book of poetry, ''Les Déliquescences d'[[Adoré Floupette]]'', published in 1885 by [[Henri Beauclair]] and [[Gabriel Vicaire]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Beauclair]] and [[Gabriel Vicaire]], [http://www.bmlisieux.com/archives/deliqu01.htm ''Les Déliquescences d'Adoré Floupette''] (1885)&lt;br /&gt;[[:File:Floupette - Les Déliquescences, 1885.djvu|''Les Déliquescences'' – poèmes décadents d'Adoré Floupette, avec sa vie par Marius Tapora]] by Henri Beauclair and Gabriel Vicaire {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
===Visual arts===
[[File:On the Edge of the Sea.jpg|thumb|[[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]], ''Jeunes Filles au Bord de la Mer'' ("Young Girls on the Edge of the Sea"), 1879, [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris]]

Symbolism in literature is distinct from symbolism in art although the two were similar in many aspects. In painting, symbolism can be seen as a revival of some mystical tendencies in the [[Romanticism|Romantic tradition]], and was close to the self-consciously morbid and private [[decadent movement]].

There were several rather dissimilar groups of Symbolist painters and visual artists, which included [[Gustave Moreau]], [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis]], [[Jacek Malczewski]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]], [[Henri Fantin-Latour]], [[Gaston Bussière]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Félicien Rops]], and [[Jan Toorop]]. Symbolism in painting was even more widespread geographically than symbolism in poetry, affecting [[Mikhail Vrubel]], [[Nicholas Roerich]], [[Victor Borisov-Musatov]], [[Martiros Saryan]], [[Mikhail Nesterov]], [[Léon Bakst]], [[Elena Gorokhova]] in Russia, as well as [[Frida Kahlo]] in Mexico{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}, [[Elihu Vedder]], [[Remedios Varo]], [[Morris Graves]] and David Chetlahe Paladin in the United States. [[Auguste Rodin]] is sometimes considered a symbolist sculptor.

The symbolist painters used mythological and dream imagery. The symbols used by symbolism are not the familiar [[emblem]]s of mainstream [[iconography]] but intensely personal, private, obscure and ambiguous references. More a philosophy than an actual style of art, symbolism in painting influenced the contemporary [[Art Nouveau]] style and [[Les Nabis]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

===Music===

Symbolism had some influence on music as well. Many symbolist writers and critics were early enthusiasts of the music of [[Richard Wagner]],&lt;ref&gt;Jullian Phillipe, ''The Symbolists'', 1977, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; an avid reader of Schopenhauer.

[[File:Waterhouse, John William - Saint Cecilia - 1895.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.2|[[John William Waterhouse]], ''Saint Cecilia'', 1895]]

The symbolist aesthetic affected the works of [[Claude Debussy]]. His choices of ''[[libretto|libretti]]'', texts, and themes come almost exclusively from the symbolist canon.  Compositions such as his settings of ''[[Cinq poèmes de Charles Baudelaire]]'', various [[lieder|art songs]] on poems by Verlaine, the opera ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelléas et Mélisande]]'' with a libretto by [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], and his unfinished sketches that illustrate two Poe stories, ''[[The Devil in the Belfry]]'' and ''[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]'', all indicate that Debussy was profoundly influenced by symbolist themes and tastes.  His best known work, the ''[[Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune]]'', was inspired by Mallarmé's poem, ''[[L'après-midi d'un faune (poem)|L'après-midi d'un faune]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.jrank.org/pages/11377/Symbolism-Symbolism-Music.html Symbolism – Symbolism and Music]&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbolist aesthetic also influenced [[Alexander Scriabin|Aleksandr Scriabin]]'s compositions. [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s ''[[Pierrot Lunaire]]'' takes its text from German translations of the symbolist poems by [[Albert Giraud]], showing an association between German expressionism and symbolism. [[Richard Strauss]]'s 1905 opera ''[[Salome (opera)|Salomé]]'', based on the play by [[Oscar Wilde]], uses a subject frequently depicted by symbolist artists.

===Prose fiction===
Symbolism's style of the [[wikt:static|static]] and [[wikt:hieratic|hieratic]] adapted less well to narrative fiction than it did to poetry. [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]' 1884 novel ''[[À rebours]]'' (English title: ''Against Nature'' or ''Against the Grain'') explored many themes that became associated with the symbolist aesthetic.  This novel, in which very little happens, catalogues the psychology of Des Esseintes, an eccentric, reclusive [[antihero]]. [[Oscar Wilde]] was influenced by the novel, it being a major influence in writing his play [[Salome]] and Huysman's book appears in ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'', with the titular character becoming corrupted after reading the book.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/decadent-novel-a-rebours-or-against-nature Joris–Karl Huysmans, ''Decadent novel À rebours, or, Against Nature''], Paris, 1891&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Adam (French novelist)|Paul Adam]] was the most prolific and representative author of symbolist novels. ''Les Demoiselles Goubert'' (1886), co-written with [[Jean Moréas]], is an important transitional work between [[naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] and symbolism. Few symbolists used this form.  One exception was [[Gustave Kahn]], who published ''Le Roi fou'' in 1896.  In 1892, [[Georges Rodenbach]] wrote the short novel ''[[Bruges-la-morte]]'', set in the Flemish town of [[Bruges]], which Rodenbach described as a dying, medieval city of mourning and quiet contemplation: in a typically symbolist juxtaposition, the dead city contrasts with the diabolical re-awakening of sexual desire.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Hollinghurst]], "[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jan/29/featuresreviews.guardianreview30 Bruges of sighs]" (''[[The Guardian]]'', 29 Jan. 2005, accessed 26 Apr 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The cynical, misanthropic, misogynistic fiction of [[Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly]] is sometimes considered symbolist, as well. [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] wrote his first novels in the symbolist manner.

===Theatre===
[[File:Petrutxca de Fokine-1911.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Alexandre Benois]]' set for [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' in 1911]]

The characteristic emphasis on an internal life of dreams and fantasies have made symbolist theatre difficult to reconcile with more recent trends. [[Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam]]'s drama ''[[Axël (drama)|Axël]]'' (rev. ed. 1890) is a definitive symbolist play.  In it, two [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] aristocrats become enamored of each other while trying to kill each other, only to agree to commit suicide mutually because nothing in life could equal their fantasies.  From this play, [[Edmund Wilson]] adopted the title ''Axel's Castle'' for his influential study of the symbolist literary aftermath.

[[Maurice Maeterlinck]], also a symbolist playwright, wrote ''[[The Blind]]'' (1890), ''The Intruder'' (1890), ''Interior'' (1891), ''[[Pelléas and Mélisande]]'' (1892), and ''[[The Blue Bird (play)|The Blue Bird]]'' (1908).
[[Eugénio de Castro]] is considered one of the introducers of Symbolism in the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. He wrote ''Belkiss'', "dramatic prose-poem" as he called it, about the doomed passion of Belkiss, [[queen of Sheba|The Queen of Sheba]], to Solomon, depicting in a avant-guard and violent style the psychological tension and recreating very accurately the tenth century BC Israel. He also wrote ''King Galaor'' and ''Polycrates' Ring'', being one the most prolific Symbolist theoriticians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saraiva, Lopes|first1=António José, Óscar|title=História da Literatura Portuguesa|date=2017|publisher=Porto Editora|location=Lisboa|isbn=978-972-0-30170-3|edition=17th}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Lugné-Poe]] (1869–1940) was an actor, director, and theatre producer of the late nineteenth century. Lugné-Poe "sought to create a unified nonrealistic theatre of poetry and dreams through atmospheric staging and stylized acting".&lt;ref name=EBS&gt;{{cite web|title=Symbolist Movement|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/577796/Symbolist-movement|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon learning about symbolist theatre, he never wanted to practice any other form. After beginning as an actor in the [[Théâtre Libre]] and Théâtre d'Art, Lugné-Poe grasped on to the symbolist movement and founded the [[Théâtre de l'Œuvre]] where he was manager from 1892 until 1929. Some of his greatest successes include opening his own symbolist theatre, producing the first staging of [[Alfred Jarry]]'s ''[[Ubu Roi]]'' (1896), and introducing French theatregoers to playwrights such as [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]] and [[August Strindberg|Strindberg]].&lt;ref name=EBS /&gt;

The later works of the Russian playwright [[Anton Chekhov]] have been identified by essayist [[Paul Schmidt (translator)|Paul Schmidt]] as being much influenced by symbolist pessimism.&lt;ref&gt;''The Plays of Anton Chekhov'', trans. Paul Schmidt (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] and [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]] experimented with symbolist modes of staging in their theatrical endeavors.

Drama by symbolist authors formed an important part of the repertoire of the ''[[Théâtre de l'Œuvre]]'' and the ''[[Paul Fort|Théâtre d'Art]]''.

Among English-speaking artists, the closest counterpart to symbolism was [[aestheticism]]. The [[pre-Raphaelite]]s were contemporaries of the earlier symbolists, and have much in common with them. Symbolism had a significant influence on [[modernism]], ([[Remy de Gourmont]] considered the [[Imagism|Imagists]] were its descendants)&lt;ref&gt;de Gourmont, Remy. ''La France'' (1915)&lt;/ref&gt; and its traces can also be detected in the work of many modernist poets, including [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Wallace Stevens]], [[Conrad Aiken]], [[Hart Crane]], and [[W. B. Yeats]] in the anglophone tradition and [[Rubén Darío]] in Hispanic literature. The early poems of [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] have strong affinities with symbolism. Early Portuguese Modernism was heavily influenced by Symbolist poets, especially [[Camilo Pessanha]]; [[Fernando Pessoa]] had many affinities to Symbolism, such as mysticism, musical versification, subjectivism and transcendatilism.

[[Edmund Wilson]]'s 1931 study ''Axel's Castle'' focuses on the continuity with symbolism and several important writers of the early twentieth century, with a particular emphasis on Yeats, Eliot, [[Paul Valéry]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[James Joyce]], and [[Gertrude Stein]].  Wilson concluded that the symbolists represented a dreaming retreat into
&lt;blockquote&gt;things that are dying–the whole [[belles-lettres|belle-lettristic]] tradition of Renaissance culture perhaps, compelled to specialize more and more, more and more driven in on itself, as industrialism and democratic education have come to press it closer and closer.''&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite book|last=Brooker|first=Joseph|title=Joyce's Critics: Transitions in Reading and Culture|year=2004|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, Wisc.|isbn=978-0299196042|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the beginning of the 20th century, symbolism had a major effect on [[Russian literature|Russian poetry]] even as it became less popular in France. Russian symbolism, steeped in the [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and the religious doctrines of [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], had little in common with the French style of the same name. It began the careers of several major poets such as [[Alexander Blok]], [[Andrei Bely]], and [[Marina Tsvetaeva]]. Bely's novel ''Petersburg'' (1912) is considered the greatest example of Russian symbolist prose.

Primary influences on the style of [[Russian Symbolism]] were the [[Irrationality|irrationalistic]] and [[mysticism|mystical]] poetry and philosophy of [[Fyodor Tyutchev]] and Solovyov, the novels of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], the operas of [[Richard Wagner]],&lt;ref name="lituanus"&gt;[http://www.lituanus.org/2003/03_2_04.htm Nathalie Lorand, ''Symbolist Vision, The role of music in the paintings of M.K. Čiurlionis'', Lituanus, Volume 49, No.2 – Summer 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; the philosophy of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]],&lt;ref&gt;Boris Christa, 'Andrey Bely and the Symbolist Movement in Russia' in ''The Symbolist Movement in the Literature of European Languages'' John Benjamins Publishing Company, 1984, p. 389&lt;/ref&gt; French symbolist and decadent poets (such as [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], [[Paul Verlaine]] and [[Charles Baudelaire]]), and the dramas of [[Henrik Ibsen]].

The style was largely inaugurated by [[Nikolai Minsky]]'s article ''The Ancient Debate'' (1884) and [[Dmitry Merezhkovsky]]'s book ''On the Causes of the Decline and on the New Trends in Contemporary Russian Literature'' (1892). Both writers promoted extreme [[individualism]] and the act of creation. [[Dmitry Merezhkovsky|Merezhkovsky]] was known for his poetry as well as a series of novels on ''god-men'', among whom he counted Christ, [[Joan of Arc]], [[Dante]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Napoleon]], and (later) [[Hitler]]. His wife, [[Zinaida Gippius]], also a major poet of early symbolism, opened a salon in [[St Petersburg]], which came to be known as the "headquarters of Russian decadence". [[Andrei Bely]]'s [[Petersburg (novel)]] a portrait of the social strata of the Russian capital,  is frequently cited as a late example of Symbolism in 20th century Russian literature.

In [[Romania]], symbolists directly influenced by French poetry first gained influence during the 1880s, when [[Alexandru Macedonski]] reunited a group of young poets associated with his magazine ''[[Literatorul]]''. Polemicizing with the established ''[[Junimea]]'' and overshadowed by the influence of [[Mihai Eminescu]], [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romanian symbolism]] was recovered as an inspiration during and after the 1910s, when it was exampled by the works of [[Tudor Arghezi]], [[Ion Minulescu]], [[George Bacovia]], [[Mateiu Caragiale]], [[Tristan Tzara]] and [[Tudor Vianu]], and praised by the [[Modernism|modernist]] magazine ''[[Sburătorul]]''.

The symbolist painters were an important influence on [[expressionism]] and [[surrealism]] in painting, two movements which descend directly from symbolism proper.  The [[harlequin]]s, paupers, and clowns of [[Pablo Picasso]]'s "[[Blue Period]]" show the influence of symbolism, and especially of Puvis de Chavannes.  In Belgium, symbolism became so popular that it came to be known as a national style, particularly in landscape painting&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Jullian, ''The Symbolists'', 1977, p.55&lt;/ref&gt;: the static strangeness of painters like [[René Magritte]] can be considered as a direct continuation of symbolism. The work of some symbolist visual artists, such as [[Jan Toorop]], directly affected the curvilinear forms of [[art nouveau]].

Many early motion pictures also employ symbolist visual imagery and themes in their staging, set designs, and imagery. The films of [[expressionism (film)|German expressionism]] owe a great deal to symbolist imagery. The virginal "good girls" seen in the cinema of [[D. W. Griffith]], and the [[silent film]] "bad girls" portrayed by [[Theda Bara]], both show the continuing influence of symbolism, as do the [[Babylon]]ian scenes from Griffith's ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]''. Symbolist imagery lived on longest in [[horror film]]: as late as 1932, [[Carl Theodor Dreyer]]'s ''[[Vampyr]]'' showed the obvious influence of symbolist imagery; parts of the film resemble ''tableau vivant'' re-creations of the early paintings of [[Edvard Munch]].&lt;ref&gt;Jullian, Philippe, ''The Symbolists''.

'''Tang dynasty tomb figures''' are pottery figures of people and animals made in the [[Tang dynasty]] of China (618–906) as [[grave good]]s to be placed in tombs.  There was a belief that the figures represented would become available for the service of the deceased in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, 24, 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; The figures are made of [[Molding (process)|moulded]] [[earthenware]] with colour generally being added, though often not over the whole figure, or in naturalistic places.  Where the colouring was in paint it has often not survived, but in many cases it was in ''[[sancai]]'' ("three-colour") [[ceramic glaze]], which has generally lasted well.

The figures, called ''mingqui'' in Chinese, were most often of servants, soldiers (in male tombs) and attendants such as dancers and musicians, with many no doubt representing [[courtesan]]s. In burials of people of high rank there may be soldiers and officials as well. The animals are most often horses, but there are surprising numbers of both [[Bactrian camel]]s and their [[Central Asian]] drivers, distinguished by thick beards and hair, and their facial features.  The depictions are [[realism (arts)|realistic]] to a degree unprecedented in [[Chinese art]],&lt;ref&gt;Medley, 78&lt;/ref&gt; and the figures give archaeologists much useful information about life under the Tang.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 80; Medley, 80&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also figures of the imaginary monster "earth spirits" and the fearsome human [[Lokapala]] (or ''tian wang''), both usually in pairs and acting as tomb guardians to repel attacks by both spirits and humans.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 78–79; Tang, 46–63&lt;/ref&gt;   Sets of the twelve imaginary beasts of the [[Chinese Zodiac]] are also found, usually unglazed.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 62; Michaelson, 102–103&lt;/ref&gt;

The figures represent a development of earlier traditions of Chinese tomb figures,&lt;ref&gt;Colburn Clydesdale&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Tang elaborate glazed figures are restricted to north China, very largely to the areas around the capitals.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, 133&lt;/ref&gt; They "virtually disappear" from 755 when the highly disruptive [[An Lushan Rebellion]] began,&lt;ref&gt;Medley, 26&lt;/ref&gt; which probably affected the kilns in [[Henan]] and [[Hebei]] making the pieces as well as their elite clientele.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 81&lt;/ref&gt;  A much diminished tradition continued in later dynasties until the Ming.  The use of ''sancai'' glazing on figures was restricted to the upper classes,&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 78&lt;/ref&gt; and production was controlled by the imperial bureaucracy,&lt;ref&gt;McGregor&lt;/ref&gt; but a single burial of a member of the imperial family might contain many hundreds of figures.&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1973), 136–137&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context and meaning ==
A thousand years before the Tang figures, the [[Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng]] (d. about 433 BC) contained the bodies of 22 musicians, as well as the instruments they played.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, 72&lt;/ref&gt;  Traces of wooden figures wearing textiles are known from similar dates, and the First Emperor's [[Terracotta Army]] is famous;&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, 32–42&lt;/ref&gt; his funeral also involved the killing and burial of many servants and animals, including all his childless concubines.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, 36&lt;/ref&gt; The excavated [[Han dynasty]] tombs we know about contained bronze or pottery figures of horses,&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, 47–48; Watson (1973), 110, 119–120&lt;/ref&gt; and often groups of soldiers, well below life-size, in the tombs of commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, 24, 44–46; Watson (1973), 118–119&lt;/ref&gt;  Lower down the social scale, pottery models of houses and animals were very common, and continued into the Tang.&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1973), 117, 121; Colburn Clydesdale&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time of the short-lived but effective [[Sui dynasty]] (581–618), the pattern of Tang tomb figures was essentially established, though the [[polychromy]] of ''sancai'' colours did not appear until the Tang.&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1973), 136; Tang, 16–22, 46&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Xian 2006 6-5.jpg|thumb|[[Lokapala]] guardian figure]]

The size and number of the figures in a grave depended on the rank of the deceased, as did the number that were glazed.  Servants and farm animals were often glazed, painted or [[slip-painting|slip-painted]] white, or brown in the case of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 78–79; Tang, 46–63&lt;/ref&gt;  The figures were paraded on carts as part of the funeral procession.  They were then lined up outside the tomb before the coffin was taken inside. Once this was in place they were taken inside the tomb and arranged in the tomb, often along the sloping access way to the underground burial chamber, or in an ante-chamber to it.  In large tombs there were niches built into the tomb walls for them to occupy.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 144&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recent years most pieces came from excavations that were not done by archaeologists and knowledge of the context of pieces was lacking. The important tomb of the Tang Princess [[Li Xianhui]] (or Yongtai) from 705 was discovered in 1960 in the imperial [[Qianling Mausoleum]] complex, and professionally excavated from 1964, the first of a number of excavations of major tombs, though others have been left deliberately undisturbed.  It had been robbed in the past, probably soon after the burial, and items in precious materials taken, but the thieves had not bothered with the 777 unglazed and painted and around 60 glazed tomb figures (now mostly [[Shaanxi History Museum]]).  These were mostly in "solid ranks" in stepped niches off the long sloping entrance way.&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1973), 136–137; on other tombs, Hay, throughout, especially 19–35. His fig. 24 shows a niche as found, with its figures.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grand tombs were conceived as "a personalized paradise mirroring the best aspects of the earthly world", approached by a [[spirit road]] with stone statues, and ministered to by priests in temples and altars around the mound.&lt;ref&gt;Eckfield, "Introduction"&lt;/ref&gt; Underground, they also contained extensive frescos with painted representations of the same types of figure as the pottery, and the images in the two media worked together to recreate a palace geography evoking the residence and lifestyle of the deceased before death.  The entrance ramp recreated the approach to a grand palace, the sections with frescos and figure niches reflecting the various enclosures and courtyards of the sprawling palace complexes of Tang royalty. Niches with horses and grooms were nearer the entrance than those with musicians and court ladies; niches were typically flanked by frescos of attendants in charge of that area.  This was imagined as much from the tomb chamber outwards as from the tomb entrance inwards; despite Chinese concepts of Hell and paradise, the spirit of the deceased was believed to continue to inhabit and roam the tomb, and the intention was to provide suitable facilities of all kinds.&lt;ref&gt;Hay, throughout; Eckfield, throughout, concentrating on the mural programmes&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, within tomb complexes such as the Qianling Mausoleum complex, visits by the deceased to the neighbouring tombs of the imperial family, accompanied by huge processions, were envisaged, and saddled pottery horses stood waiting for the entourage, for visits or hunting.&lt;ref&gt;Hay, 46–49&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique ==

The size of figures varies considerably, from about 10 to 110 centimetres high for a standing human figure, and about 55 to 120 or more for the largest types, the beasts and guardians.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 60; Grove: "Earthenware figures, varying in height from c. 150&amp;nbsp;mm to c. 1.5 m", but 12&amp;nbsp;cm is a common height&lt;/ref&gt;  Different scales of figures were usually mixed within tombs, depending on the status of the people or animals depicted.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 79&lt;/ref&gt; There is some indication that glazed and unglazed figures may have been made at different kilns.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 45&lt;/ref&gt;  The figures are low-fired earthenware, since strength and durability were not required. The clay body fires to a "whitish" colour, except for a smaller group of less fine reddish pieces, normally covered in white [[slip (pottery)|slip]].&lt;ref&gt;Medley, 46, 49&lt;/ref&gt;

The figures are moulded, usually from several pieces, with the head always made separately, and the larger animals in the most parts.  The various pieces were [[luting|luted]] together before firing, with the opportunity taken to vary identical figures by joining the heads at slightly different angles.  The clay was often worked by hand, luting on small extra details and textures, and sometimes working on the surface with tools.  In earlier figures a joint line running up the side of the body can often be seen.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 45–46; Medley, 77–78; Vainker, 80&lt;/ref&gt;  The two types of guardian figures For an unknown reason, the heads of horses either face straight ahead or turn to the left; they  almost never turn to the right.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 58&lt;/ref&gt;

When the clay work was complete, a white [[slip (ceramics)|slip]] was applied all over, then any glaze was added to the figure before firing. Smaller figures might have a clear or slightly yellow glaze, and in larger ones the glaze was often kept off the face and hands, which were painted after firing.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 51&lt;/ref&gt;  Sui and early Tang figures, before ''sancai'' was used, normally have the transparent glaze.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 46&lt;/ref&gt;  The application of the coloured glazes can be very variable; in many pieces the colours are carefully applied to different parts of the figures, but in others "they have been splashed on without regard for design or contour".&lt;ref&gt;Medley, 80&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[cobalt]] blue was added to the ''sancai'' palette during the period, and at least one horse is partly coloured blue.&lt;ref&gt;Medley, 80; Vainker, 80, [http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=257839&amp;partId=1 British Museum page]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some figures had elements in wood, such as weapons, [[polo]]-sticks, or rope halters for horses and camels, which have not survived.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, 87&lt;/ref&gt;

The best period for the figures lasted only about 50 years, to the [[An Lushan Rebellion]] of 755, a period of innovation, unprecedented realism and an interest in showing [[psychology|psychological types]] in several media for [[Chinese art]].&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1974), 70–76; McGregor&lt;/ref&gt; The figures share with Buddhist monumental sculpture of the period conventions, derived from further west, that show "appropriate detail of muscle which yet departs from reality at many points". The horse figures reflect the same ideal as seen in contemporary paintings, and it is uncertain in which medium the type first arose.&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1974), 75–76, 76 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

With exception of the Zodiac figures, which were also the only type to increase in popularity after the Tang, the figures are "more closely related to the metropolitan and Buddhist attitudes than to the magical aspects of rural beliefs and a pattern of behaviour governed by superstitions or shamanistic beliefs of the local farming communities", which partly accounts for their failure to return after the 750s,&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 62–63, 63 quoted&lt;/ref&gt; along with a preference for new types of grave goods.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 81&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of figures ==
The group of 13 [[Tang dynasty tomb figures of Liu Tingxun]], a general who died in 728, represent a fine group of the usual major figures, all in ''sancai''. There are four tomb guardians, and pairs of officials (these are all on a similar scale), horses and camels, plus three grooms, this group on a considerably smaller scale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=227685&amp;partId=1 BM collection database, see curator's note]; McGregor&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women ===
The earliest figures, from the 7th century, are "rather simple and less well-executed than later ones".&lt;ref&gt;Medley, 77–78&lt;/ref&gt;  The women are tall and slim, whereas by the mid-8th century a plumper figure had become the norm, with faces that are "fat, heavily brooding and vacuous".&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 46–48 (48 quoted); Grove&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that this change in taste was provoked by the famous imperial concubine [[Yang Guifei]], who had a full figure, although it seems to begin by about 725,&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 47; Michaelson, 61–62, 70&lt;/ref&gt; when she was a child.

There may be groups of women as dancers or small seated orchestras of musicians, and some sitting figures appear to be beautifying themselves.  More rarely, there are female riders and [[polo]] players, wearing male dress, which was usual for Tang women when riding, and apparently a fashion in the capital on other occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 49–51; Michaelson, 72–73&lt;/ref&gt;  The period was one of unusual freedom for well-off women in China, and the figures reflect this.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 46–51; Michaelson, 59–60, 70–73, 84&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Men ===
Tang society, at least in [[Chang'an]], the capital,&lt;ref&gt;[[Luoyang]] was capital for 684–705&lt;/ref&gt; was very cosmopolitan, and drew much of its prosperity from the [[Silk Road]].  Foreigners from further west seem to have been common as servants, in particular as grooms for horses and drivers of the camels which were the main form of transport on the overland Silk Road. Tang art liked to depict foreign figures, usually men, with standard characteristics for their faces and dress; [[Persia]]n and [[Sogdia]]n types can be distinguished, both with big bushy beards, and often fierce and vigorous expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 51–56; Michaelson, 79–82, 86–87; Grove&lt;/ref&gt;  Such figures sometimes contain clear elements of [[caricature]].&lt;ref&gt;Medley, 79–80&lt;/ref&gt;

Male figures are often given more varied and active poses, and worked in more detail than those of women, but are harder to date as the changes in women's costume were not matched in male fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 55&lt;/ref&gt; As well as many types of servants there are military officers in armour, officials, and sometimes foreign ambassadors.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 51–55&lt;/ref&gt;  The function of the officials is to present the case for the deceased to the fierce [[Yama (East Asia)|judge of the afterlife]].&lt;ref&gt;McGregor&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Animals ===
[[File:Tang Kamel mit Führer Museum Rietberg RCH 516.jpg|thumb|Loaded camel with rider, in this case Chinese]]
The most common animals, and the most likely to be large and carefully modelled and decorated, are horses and camels.  Both sorts range from animals without harness and saddlery to those with elaborately detailed trappings, and carrying riders or, in the case of camels, heavy loads of goods. At least two famous camels carry a small human orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 58–59; [[:File:Sancai musicians on camel, front.jpg|example]], [[:File:Sancai musicians on camel, side.jpg|another view]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Dogs and farm animals, apart from some bulls at up to about 30&amp;nbsp;cm high, are more likely to be small and unglazed.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 59&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with guardian figures and officials, statues of horses are the main type of tomb figure that is also known in other media, such as [[gilt-bronze]] or stone, and some rich tombs also contain such figures in metal.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 57–58; Michaelson, 47–48 for a Han example&lt;/ref&gt;  The camels may sometimes belong to tombs of people rich from trade,&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 58&lt;/ref&gt; but also seem to have been associated with wealth generally.  They are often shown with heads raised and their mouths open, and in the finest models the shaggy areas at the neck and top of the legs are carefully textured in the clay.  The horses are the "[[heavenly horses]]" from [[Ferghana]] in the west, which under the Tang dynasty were more common in China and ceased to be a highly prized rarity.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;  These were also made in pottery under the [[Han dynasty]]; the Tang examples are more realistic,&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 56&lt;/ref&gt; if perhaps less expressive.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Tomb guardians ===
[[File:Zhenmushou 02.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Unglazed face of an earth spirit of the semi-human type]]
Four tomb guardians were standard in rich tombs, typically one at each corner: a pair each of "earth spirits" or ''zhenmushou'', and the ''[[lokapala]]'' or ''zhenmuyong'' warrior guardians.  The figures are typically the largest and most elaborate in a tomb, and must often have been much the most difficult to model and fire. They are more likely to be glazed in ''sancai'', although many very elaborately made examples are not.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 60; Medley, 80&lt;/ref&gt;

The figures may have been believed to protect the living by keeping the spirits of the dead from inappropriately roaming the world outside the tomb, as well as protecting the tomb from intrusions by robbers or spirits;&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1973), 143–144&lt;/ref&gt; the earth spirits were apparently associated with the first role, and the ''lokapala'' with the second.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 60; Medley, 80&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''lokapala'' was also found above ground in Buddhist temples, in stone or wood.&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, 139–140&lt;/ref&gt; They seem to represent a merger of traditional [[Daoist]] guardians, dating back to the [[Han dynasty]], and the Buddhist ''[[dvarapala]]'' or "Heavenly Kings", of which there were in theory four, though often only two were depicted in other Buddhist cultures.  These too were shown as "a fabulous crested semi-human being with bulging eyes, furiously gaping mouth and massive powerful arms and legs".&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 60, quoted&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas the Indian versions emphasized royal attributes, in China they were "transformed into dynamic idealized generals",&lt;ref&gt;Michaelson, 139–140, 139 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;  with elaborate armour, often with added sprigged reliefs.

In the early part of the Tang their pose was less dramatic, standing with straight legs and holding a weapon (now usually lost) at rest. In the 8th century the elaborarate ''[[contrapposto]]'' poses were developed, typically with one foot higher than the other, as it rests on an animal or dwarfish conquered demon, and one arm held high, brandishing a weapon, while the other is bent and rests on the hip, in a pose combining fierceness and nonchalance.&lt;ref&gt;Grove; Tang, 60; Watson (1973), 143–144&lt;/ref&gt;

The earth spirits are still more fantastic, with animal bodies, often including wings sprouting from the tops of the forelegs. The heads are often different, with one semi-human and another perhaps based on a snarling lion.  Both have "horns and crests like flames or huge cockscombs",&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 60&lt;/ref&gt; typically even larger in the lion-like type, while the semi-human type may have huge wide ears. Often the faces of the lion type are glazed, and the semi-human type not. Although mentioned in literature from the Han onwards, they only appear in art from the 6th century onwards,&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 60&lt;/ref&gt; apparently developing from masks worn in the "devil-clearing ceremony at the New Year.&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1973), 144&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also more conventional figures of snarling lions, relatively small and usually in '''[[sancai]]'' glaze.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 60–61&lt;/ref&gt; Like the sets of zodiac figures, these continued after the Tang, which the elaborate "earth spirits" and ''[[lokapala]]'' did not.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 60–62&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collecting history ==
[[File:ShiErShengXiao Shaanxi History Museum.JPG|thumb|left|A set of [[Chinese Zodiac]] figures]]
Tang figures were not of much interest to traditional Chinese connoisseurs of pottery, and are still relatively little collected by Chinese collectors because they are made specifically for use in burials, and so considered unlucky;&lt;ref&gt;Wang, 74&lt;/ref&gt; however they are popular exhibits in Chinese museums.  They became extremely popular with Western collectors from about the 1910s,&lt;ref&gt;Watson (1974), 74; Wang, 74–75; Reitlinger (1963), 18&lt;/ref&gt; especially figures of horses, partly because they harmonized well with modern Western art and decor.  By 1963, [[Gerald Reitlinger]] could write that "no [[Mayfair]] flat is complete without a T'ang camel".&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger (1963), 18&lt;/ref&gt;  Prices, which peaked at a top level of about £600 a figure in the early 1920s, fell in the 1930s and 40s, but rose sharply in the 1960s, with a record auction price in 1969 of £16,000 for a horse.&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger (1963), 310–312; Reitlinger (1970), 429–431&lt;/ref&gt;

From about the late 1990s it was realized that there were large numbers of fakes on the market, and there was also an upsurge in new discoveries as construction in China boomed, and the market was hit by increased supply coinciding with a falling from fashion. For all these reasons, the figures have not shared in the huge increase in Chinese art prices since the 1990s, which has been driven by Chinese collectors.  The record price for a horse remains £3,740,000,&lt;ref&gt;Wang, 75, as of 2012&lt;/ref&gt; from a sale by the [[British Rail Pension Fund]] at [[Sotheby's]] in 1989. In 2002 the dealer who had sold this piece to the pension fund in the 1970s said that he thought that in 2002 it would be "lucky" to reach a price of £1 million.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, 75; [https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/items-and-icons-chinese-art-1151571.html "Items and Icons: Chinese art"], ''[[The Independent]]'', 21 March 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2750">:''The Norka is also the name of a restaurant in Akron, Colorado.''

'''The Norka''' is a fairy tale from [[Andrew Lang]]'s ''[[The Red Fairy Book]]''. Lang gives no source for the tale, but it is taken verbatim from the book Russian Folk-tales by W. R. S. Ralston, published in 1873 by Smith, Elder, &amp; co. and re-published by [[Kessinger Publishing]] in 2004.

The King is unable to destroy the Norka, a huge beast who is devouring his animals. He offers half his kingdom to any one of his sons who kills the Norka. The two eldest sons drink and revel instead of hunting the beast. The youngest third son, a simpleton, wounds and chases the beast. The beast escapes under a great stone. The third son descends to the underworld and meets a talking horse who calls him Ivan and takes him to a copper palace owned by a beautiful woman, a sister of the Norka. He travels to a silver palace and a golden palace, also owned by the sisters of the Norka. The third and youngest sister tells him that Norka is asleep on the sea. She gives him a sword and the Water of Strength, and tells him to cut off her brother's head with a single stroke. He cuts off the Norka's head, which says "Well, I'm done for now!", and rolls into the sea. 

The three sisters are in love with him, so he takes them with him to the surface world. They change their palaces into eggs with magic, teach him how to do it, and give him the eggs. His brothers pull the three maidens up, but try to kill the third son by cutting the rope halfway up. He substituted a stone for himself, however, so he was not killed. Stranded in the underworld, he sadly wandered away as it rains. He covers some baby birds with his coat to protect them from the rain. The giant mother bird is grateful and carries him to the surface.

A tailor tells him that the two princes are going to marry the maidens from the underworld, but the maidens refuse to be married until wedding dresses are made in the underworld style, and without measuring them. The third son tells the tailor to accept the job to make the clothes for the wedding. At night, the third son turns the eggs into palaces, takes the maiden's clothes from the palaces, and turns the palaces into eggs again. He gives the dresses to the tailor who is paid richly by the King. He visits the shoemaker and other artificers and does the same thing. The youngest maiden recognizes him (in rags), grabs him, and takes him to the palace. She explains to the king what happened and that the brothers threatened to kill them if they said the third son was alive. The King punishes the two brothers. Three weddings are celebrated.

==Content==

[[File:Idries Shah.gif|thumb|left|100px|Idries Shah]]
Part of a series of books, ''The Pleasantries of the Incredible Mulla Nasrudin'' is a collection of [[teaching stories]], [[anecdote]]s and jokes drawn from Middle Eastern folklore and the [[Sufi]] [[Mysticism|mystical]] tradition, which feature the [[Populism|populist]] [[Middle East]]ern philosopher and wise fool, [[Mullah|Mulla]] [[Nasreddin|Nasrudin]].&lt;ref name="iranica"&gt;{{cite web

Thousands of stories have been written around this popular folk character over the centuries, since his purported birth in the 13th century in what is now modern [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt;

==Reception==

[[Douglas Hill]], Literary Editor of the [[democratic socialism|socialist]] ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'' weekly magazine, wrote in 1969 that ''The Pleasantries of the Incredible Mulla Nasrudin'' contained “a great deal of timeless and universal wisdom made accessible and highly attractive with humour”, adding that “conventional responses and received frames of mind are challenged on every page.”&lt;ref name="Tribune"&gt;{{cite news

In ''[[The New York Times]]'', award-winning writer and later winner of the 2007 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], [[Doris Lessing]] called ''The Pleasantries of the Incredible Mulla Nasrudin'' “perhaps the most shocking to our assumptions about ‘mysticism’” of Shah's books at the time. She said that this corpus of Nasrudin “jokes” was “deliberately created to inculcate Sufic thinking, to outwit The Old Villain, which is a name for the patterns of conditioned thinking which form the prison in which we all live.”&lt;ref name="NewYorkTimes"&gt;{{cite news

  | accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an earlier review in ''[[The Observer]]'', Doris Lessing pointed out that most of the jokes in the book were new to the West; while others could also be found in the written work of Sufis like [[Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī|Rumi]], [[Attar of Nishapur|Attar]] and [[Jami]]. She explained that “[Nasrudin's] antics are parallels of the mind's workings, designed to amuse the teahouses, but also for use on other levels”. As an example she refers to their use at an international scientific conference to illustrate problems in physics that were otherwise difficult or impossible to verbalise.&lt;ref name="Observer"&gt;{{cite news

The '''Théâtre des Tuileries''' was a theatre in the former [[Tuileries Palace]] in Paris. It was also known as the '''Salle des Machines''', because of its elaborate [[stage machinery]], designed by the Italian theatre architects Gaspare Vigarani and his two sons, [[Carlo Vigarani|Carlo]] and Lodovico.&lt;ref&gt;Coeyman 1998, pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Constructed in 1659–1661, it was originally intended for spectacular productions mounted by the court of the young [[Louis XIV]], but in 1763 the theatre was greatly reduced in size and used in turn by the [[Paris Opera]] (up to 1770), the [[Comédie-Française]] (from 1770 to 1782), and the [[Théâtre de Monsieur]] (from January to December 1789). In 1808 [[Napoleon]] had a new theatre/ballroom built to the designs of the architects [[Percier and Fontaine]]. The Tuileries Palace and the theatre were destroyed by fire on 24 May 1871, during the [[Paris Commune]].

==Salle des Machines==
The auditorium, designed and decorated by the architects [[Charles Errard]], [[Louis Le Vau]], and [[François d'Orbay]], was housed in a pavilion located at the north end of the palace as originally built by the architect [[Philibert de l'Orme]] for [[Catherine de Médicis]].&lt;ref name=Wild404&gt;Wild 1989, p. 404.&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of its seating capacity range from 6,000 to 8,000.&lt;ref&gt;Coeyman 1998, p. 53. According to Wild 1989, p. 406, the number of places was 4,000 "d'ap. A. Donnet", but the latter author actually gives the capacity as 6,000 (Donnet 1821, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LqM5AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA261 p. 261]).&lt;/ref&gt; The unusually deep stage was located in a gallery situated between the auditorium and a new, more northern pavilion, later designated as the {{Interlanguage link multi|Pavillon de Marsan|fr|vertical-align=sup}}.&lt;ref name=Wild404/&gt;

The hall was inaugurated on 7 February 1662 with the premiere of Cavalli's ''[[Ercole amante]]''. The costs of the project, including construction of the theatre, came to 120,000 ''[[livres]]'', yet the opera was only performed eight times.&lt;ref&gt;Coeyman 1998, pp. 46, 55.&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre was not used again until January 1671, when ''[[Psyché (play)|Psyché]]'', a scenically spectacular play with music and ballet, was presented. This production cost 130,000 ''livres'' and was only performed twice.&lt;ref name=Coeyman47&gt;Coeyman 1998, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Psyché'' was reduced in size and successfully revived at the smaller [[Théâtre du Palais-Royal (rue Saint-Honoré)|Théâtre du Palais-Royal]] in July.)&lt;ref&gt;Gaines 2002, pp. 394–395.&lt;/ref&gt; The Salle des Machines was not used again for musical theatre during the remainder of Louis XIV's reign. In 1720, during the [[Régence|Regency of Louis XV]], the hall was remodeled again, at a cost of nearly 150,000 livres, and the [[Ballets de cour|court ballet]] ''Les folies de Cardenio'' with music by [[Michel Richard Delalande]] was given. The young [[King Louis XV]] made his first and last appearance in a dancing role in this production. After ''Cardenio'' there were no further productions, except for some [[marionette]] shows in the 1730s.&lt;ref name=Coeyman47/&gt; In view of the large expenditures on the theatre, it is surprising that it was so little used. Modern histories cite the poor acoustics, but Coeyman suggests that its disuse may have been the result of its large size: "the hall may have simply been too hard to fill."&lt;ref&gt;Coeyman 1998, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later incarnations==
The theatre later underwent three substantial transformations: the first in 1763, when it was greatly reduced in size for the [[Paris Opera]] (to a capacity of 400 to 500 spectators) by the architects [[Jacques Soufflot]] and [[Jacques Gabriel]]; the second in 1792, when it was transformed into the hall of the [[National Convention]]; and the third in 1808, when [[Napoleon]] had a new theatre built to the designs of the architects [[Percier and Fontaine]].&lt;ref&gt;Wild 1989, pp. 406–407.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Yiddish Book Center''' ('''National Yiddish Book Center'''), located on the campus of [[Hampshire College]] in [[Amherst, Massachusetts]], United States, is a cultural institution dedicated to the preservation of books in the [[Yiddish language]], as well as the culture and history those books represent. It is one of ten western Massachusetts museums constituting the [[Museums10]] consortium.

==History==
The Yiddish Book Center was founded in 1980 by [[Aaron Lansky]], then a twenty-four-year-old graduate student of Yiddish literature and, {{as of|2016|lc=y}}, the center's president. In the course of his studies, Lansky realized that untold numbers of irreplaceable Yiddish books were being discarded by American-born Jews unable to read the language of their Yiddish-speaking parents and grandparents. He organized a nationwide network of ''zamlers'' (volunteer book collectors) and launched a campaign to save the world’s remaining Yiddish books. Lansky recounts the origins of the center in his 2004 memoir, ''[[Outwitting History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://algonquin.com/book/outwitting-history/|title=Outwitting History - Algonquin Books - Books For A Well-Read Life|work=Algonquin Books - Books For A Well-Read Life|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time Lansky began his work, scholars estimated there were 70,000 Yiddish books still extant and recoverable. Since then, the Yiddish Book Center has recovered more than a million volumes, and it continues to receive thousands of new books each year from around the world.

In 1997, the Yiddish Book Center moved to its current site in Amherst, Massachusetts, a 49,000-square-foot complex that echoes the rooflines of an East European ''shtetl'' (Jewish town). The center is home to permanent and traveling exhibits, a Yiddish book repository, educational programs, and the annual Yidstock: The Festival of New Yiddish Music.

In 2010, the organization dropped the initial word "National" from its name, and is currently known as "Yiddish Book Center."&lt;ref&gt;[https://lccn.loc.gov/no2011169190 "Yiddish Book Center (U.S.)" in ''Library of Congress Authorities'' (accessed October 4, 2017).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on a score of 100, [[Charity Navigator]] rated the Yiddish Book Center 79.82% for its financials and 97% for accountability and transparency, resulting in an overall grade of 85.57.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=7542|title=Charity Navigator Rating - National Yiddish Book Center|work=Charity Navigator|accessdate=October 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
The center has drawn on its duplicate holdings to distribute books to students and scholars, and to establish or strengthen collections at more than 700 research libraries, schools, and museums around the world.

The Yiddish Book Center includes a number of different collections: 
* In 1997, with a grant from the Righteous Persons Foundation, the Center launched its [[Steven Spielberg]] Digital Yiddish Library, which has digitized and cataloged more than 12,000 Yiddish titles and made them available for free download from the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/nationalyiddishbookcenter|title=Yiddish Book Center's Spielberg Digital Yiddish Library|work=archive.org|accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the Yiddish Book Center formed a partnership with the [[National Library of Israel]], which was launching its own project to digitize its entire Hebrew-alphabet collection, including thousands of Yiddish titles. The effort prompted ''The New York Times'' to declare Yiddish "proportionately the most accessible literature on the planet". As of the end of 2014, the titles in the Steven Spielberg Digital Yiddish Library have been downloaded 1.3 million times. 
* The David and Sylvia Steiner Yizkor Books Collection comprises hundreds of ''[[Bereavement in Judaism#Yizkor|yizkor]] books'', memorial volumes commemorating Jewish communities in East Europe that were destroyed in the Holocaust. The books in the collection can be searched online.
* The Noah Cotsen Library of Yiddish Children's Literature includes about 800 titles, both original Yiddish works and Yiddish translations of classic stories written in other languages. The majority of the titles, which come from the [[YIVO]] Institute for Jewish Research as well as from the center's own collection, have been digitized and included in the Steven Spielberg Digital Yiddish Library.
* The Sami Rohr Library of Recorded Yiddish Books is a collection of roughly 150 titles, including novels, short stories, nonfiction works, memoirs, essays, and poetry. The recordings were made at the Jewish Public Library of Montreal (JPL) in the 1980s and '90s by native Yiddish-speaking volunteers. 
* The Frances Brandt Online Yiddish Audio Library comprises recordings of lectures by, and interviews with, writers and poets who visited the JPL between 1953 and 2005. The Yiddish Book Center is now working with the JPL to digitize the recordings. Ultimately, approximately 1,100 recordings from the collection will be digitized and accessible.

==Public programs and resources==
The center offers public programs related to Yiddish and Jewish culture. Each year, the center hosts two visiting exhibits in its Brechner Gallery. It also has a number of permanent exhibits: the Lee &amp; Alfred Hutt Discovery Gallery, an interactive exhibit on Jewish cultural identity; ''Unquiet Pages'' focused on Yiddish literature; ''A Living Connection: Photographs from the An-sky Expeditions, 1912-14'' on the work of ethnographer [[S. Ansky|S. An-sky]]; ''Sholem-Bayes: Reflections on the American Jewish Home''; the Nancy B. Weinstein, ''Kindervinkl'' (children's corner); the Appelbaum-Driker Theater, with exhibits on Yiddish film and radio; and a reproduction Yiddish Print Shop with displays about the Yiddish press in the twentieth century.

''Pakn Treger'' (Yiddish for "book peddler"), the magazine of the Yiddish Book Center, is an English-language magazine that covers subjects related to Yiddish culture and literature as well as news from the center. Its annual translation issue, a digital publication, features newly translated works of Yiddish literature.

==Educational programs==
The center's educational programs include the Steiner Summer Yiddish Program for college students, the Great Jewish Books Summer Program for high school students, a Great Jewish Books Teacher Workshop, a fellowship program, a translation fellowship, and Tent: Encounters with Jewish Culture, as well as online and on-site classes for adult learners, including YiddishSchool. The center also offers a field trip program for middle and high school students.

In 2001, [[Ruthe B. Cowl]] (1912–2008) of [[Laredo, Texas]], donated $1 million to create the Jack and Ruthe B. Cowl Center, which promotes "Yiddish literary, artistic, musical, and historical knowledge and accomplishment" at the center. Early in 2007, Cowl donated another $750,000 to create the Cowl Jewish Leadership Program for promising college students.

==Translation initiative==
In 2013, the center launched a translation effort that includes a translation fellowship program; a publishing venture; Taytsh.org, a website and interactive resource for working Yiddish-to-English translators;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/ |title=Yiddish Book Center |website=Yiddishbookcenter.org |accessdate=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an annual digital ''Pakn Treger'' translation anthology.
