The '''Juba talks''' were a series of negotiations between the government of [[Uganda]] and the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] rebel group over the terms of a ceasefire and possible peace agreement.  The talks, held in [[Juba, Sudan|Juba]], the capital of autonomous [[Southern Sudan]], began in July 2006 and were mediated by [[Riek Machar]], the Vice President of Southern Sudan.  The talks, which had resulted in a ceasefire by September 2006, were described as the best chance ever for a negotiated settlement to the 20-year-old war.&lt;ref name=BBC_deadline&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4790049.stm Uganda hopeful about rebel talks], BBC News, 14 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; However, LRA leader [[Joseph Kony]] refused to sign the peace agreement in April 2008.  Two months later, the LRA carried out an attack on a Southern Sudanese town, prompting the Government of Southern Sudan to officially withdraw from their mediation role.

==Preparations==
A delegation from the LRA arrived in [[Juba, Sudan]] on 8 June 2006 to prepare for talks with the Ugandan government, to be mediated by the [[Southern Sudan autonomous region (2005–2011)|Government of Southern Sudan]] &lt;ref name="juba_8_june"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5060666.stm LRA rebels arrive for Sudan talks], BBC News, 8 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Community of Sant'Egidio]].&lt;ref name="Sant'Egidio"&gt;{{it icon}}[http://santegidio.de/news/rassegna/2006/0820_004061_IT.htm "Guerra in Nord Uganda: la fine è a portata di mano"], [[Avvenire]], August 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  These talks were agreed to after Kony released a video in May in which he denied committing atrocities and seemed to call for an end to hostilities, in response to an announcement by Museveni that he would guarantee the safety of Kony if peace was agreed to by July. Museveni had pledged to grant Kony total amnesty if he gave up "[[terrorism]]". Uganda's security minister [[Amama Mbabazi]] urged the [[International Criminal Court]] to drop the indictments issued in 2005 against leaders of the LRA, but LRA legal adviser [[Krispus Ayena Odongo]] rejected the offer, saying that accepting amnesty "presupposes surrender" and would mean the LRA was no longer available for discussions.&lt;ref name="amnesty_rejection"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5157220.stm Uganda LRA rebels reject amnesty], [[BBC News]], 7 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="drop_charges"&gt;[http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/News/0,,2-11-1447_1966651,00.html ICC urged to drop LRA charges] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229135255/http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/News/0,,2-11-1447_1966651,00.html |date=2008-02-29 }}, [[BBC News]], 12 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Several organizations, including the ICC&lt;ref name="amnesty_offer"&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200607060715.html Museveni Amnesty to Kony Illegal - ICC], AllAfrica (The Monitor), 6 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Bar Association]]'s Human Rights Institute&lt;ref name="IBA_rejects_amnesty"&gt;[http://www.legalbrief.co.za/filemgmt/visit.php?lid=401 IBA says Ugandan Government must meet obligations under the Rome Statute], IBA News Release, 13 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; insisted that LRA leaders must be arrested in accordance with the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]]. 

[[Joseph Kony]] gave his first interview to the press after 20 years of carrying out the conflict in late June 2006. He denied that the LRA had carried out any atrocities and blamed President Museveni for oppressing the Acholi.&lt;ref name="kony_speaks"&gt;Sam Farmar, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/newsnight/5124762.stm Uganda rebel leader breaks silence], BBC [[Newsnight]], 28 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Regardless, in late June 2006, the Government of Southern Sudan formally invited Uganda to attend peace talks.&lt;ref name="sudan_invitation"&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=54279 UGANDA: Gov't to send team to Sudan over proposed LRA talks], IRIN, 28 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial negotiations==
On 14 July 2006 talks began in Juba between delegations from the LRA and Uganda, with the Vice-president of Southern Sudan [[Riek Machar]] as the chief mediator. The leader of the Ugandan delegation, Internal Affairs Minister [[Ruhakana Rugunda]] stated that his priority was to obtain a quick ceasefire.&lt;ref name="Rugunda_comment"&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200607140756.html Ceasefire First On Kony Agenda], AllAfrica (The Monitor), 15 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The LRA delegation, led by [[Martin Ojul]], said that LRA's acceptance of the peace talks should not be interpreted that LRA can no longer fight, but stressed that a negotiated settlement is the best way to end the conflict.&lt;ref name="Ojul_speech"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070401151418/http://www.sundayvision.co.ug/detail.php?mainNewsCategoryId=7&amp;newsCategoryId=132&amp;newsId=509505 Opening speech of LRA delegation at Juba talks], Sunday Vision, 15 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial delegation was criticized as largely consisting of expatriate Acholi, rather than members of the fighting force. However, after many delays [[Vincent Otti]] arrived for meetings on the 29th,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5227526.stm Key Uganda rebel 'attends talks'], BBC News, 29 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; followed the next day by Kony's 14-year-old son [[Salim Saleh Kony]] (sharing a name with brother of President Museveni, [[Salim Saleh]]).&lt;ref name="BBC meet"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5231042.stm Uganda officials 'meet LRA chief'], BBC News, 30 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Kony himself met with local religious and political leaders from northern Uganda and southern Sudan on the following day.&lt;ref name="BBC meet"/&gt;  On 2 August, Kony held his first ever press conference in which he demanded a ceasefire before LRA-government negotiations resumed on the 7th and denied ever abducting children. Some media sources noted that, of the approximately 80 LRA fighters surrounding the press venue, several appeared to be in their early teens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=54938 UGANDA: Government, rebels to resume talks in Sudan], IRIN, 2 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rocketboom.com/vlog/archives/2006/08/rb_06_aug_16.html Video footage of peace talks in Juba, plus snippet of Kony press conference] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017135801/http://www.rocketboom.com/vlog/archives/2006/08/rb_06_aug_16.html |date=2006-10-17 }}, video and commentary by Ruud Elmendorp presented on [[Rocketboom]], 16 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The broader context of the talks remained confused. The government of Southern Sudan views the talks as a means of ridding itself of a foreign army that is complicating their delicate relationship with the [[Khartoum]] government. The request by the Ugandan Government for ICC to suspend war crimes indictments against leaders of the LRA, condemned by international human rights groups but largely supported by leaders and civilians within northern Uganda, led some political analysts to see Ugandan Government's request as a ploy to gain local support.  The comment of a George Olara, an [[Internally displaced person|IDP]] living in a camp in [[Pader District|Pader]], was fairly typical: "He [Kony] should not be taken to [[The Hague]]. Let him come back and live with the community because this is how reconciliation will be achieved. ... [[Peace]] will come if the talks succeed, but there is the potential that they may also fail like they have done before".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=54920 UGANDA: Locals want rebel leader forgiven], IRIN, 1 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceasefire==
[[Image:Scharq al-Istiwa'iya.PNG|thumb|left|[[Owiny Ki-Bul]] is in [[East Equatoria]] (in red) bordering [[Uganda]] to the south, [[Kenya]] to the southeast and [[Ethiopia]] to the east.]]

On 4 August 2006, Vincent Otti declared a unilateral ceasefire and asked the Ugandan government to reciprocate. Ugandan Internal Affairs Minister [[Ruhakana Rugunda]] stated that they were waiting to see the effect on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5243038.stm LRA leaders declare ceasefire], BBC, 4 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  ICC indictee Raska Lukwiya was killed in battle on 12 August 2006; the LRA asked for three days of mourning though a spokesman said that talks would continue.&lt;ref name=BBC_deadline/&gt;  Ugandan President Museveni set a 12 September 2006 deadline to finalize a peace deal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5264742.stm Uganda resumes talks with rebels] ''BBC News'' 18 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  The government and LRA signed a truce on 26 August 2006.  Under the terms of the agreement, LRA forces were required to leave Uganda and gather in two assembly areas, where the Ugandan government promised they would not attack and the government of Southern Sudan guaranteed their safety. Once this is accomplished, talks on a comprehensive peace agreement would begin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5288776.stm Uganda and LRA rebels sign truce], BBC News, 26 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Although a final agreement was not reached by the 12 August deadline, LRA rebels began gathering in the assembly areas and the government delegation stated that they would not hold to the deadline.  Machar stated that several hundred rebels, including Otti, had gathered either at [[Ri-Kwangba]] in [[West Equatoria]] or [[Owiny Ki-Bul]] in [[East Equatoria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5337888.stm Uganda drops peace talks deadline], BBC, 12 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Kitgum IDP camp from the air, Uganda.jpg|thumb|Huts in the [[Kitgum]] IDP camp are tightly packed together]]

The government also began a process of creating "satellite camps" to decongest the main IDP camps.  In Pader, 28 satellite sites were occupied out of 48 identified as of late September 2006, while the numbers in [[Kitgum]] were 21 of 36.  IDPs farther south in [[Teso sub-region|Teso]] and [[Lango sub-region|Lango]] were being encouraged to return home directly.  However, talks continued to be delayed.  On 23 September, the LRA delegation threatened to walk out of the negotiations, claiming that the UPDF had attacked their forces at Owiny Ki-Bul and demanding that composition of the government delegation be changed and that the ICC warrants be voided before any agreement.  Uganda denied the accusation of attacks.  Both delegations met with mediator Riek Machar on 25 September 2006, but not with each other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=55722 UGANDA: Most rebels have left northern Uganda for Sudan - army], IRIN, 26 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks===
The negotiations were paused in early October while a Cessation of Hostilities monitoring team was sent to Owiny Ki-Bul.  The team found that no attack had taken place, but that the LRA had simply moved away from the designated site.  The team recommended that the LRA rebels regroup at Owiny Ki-Bul, while stating that the LRA had not honored the agreement and was using hostile propaganda, that the UPDF was located close to the assembly points and that the mediators had failed to provide armed guards for the assembled rebels.  On 11 October 2006, the LRA proposed that Uganda adopt a [[federalism|federalist]] structure, prompting criticism from the government spokesperson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=55906 UGANDA: Rebels propose federalist solution at Juba talks], [[IRIN]], 11 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 October 2006, Ugandan President [[Yoweri Museveni]] traveled to Juba to meet the LRA negotiators face-to-face for the first time in an attempt to revive the talks, described as "stalled" by ''[[BBC News]]'' and "faltering" by ''[[The Monitor (Uganda)|The Monitor]]'' newspaper.  A Uganda government source reported that the president spoke angrily and rebuked the LRA team several times, before later referring to the LRA as "unserious" in a subsequent address to South Sudan government officials.  A pall had been thrown over the talks by the murder of several dozen civilians, including the shooting of women and children in the head, near Juba during the two previous days.  The attacks were carried out by an as-yet unnamed group, but some suspected that the LRA was responsible for the mayhem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6072994.stm "LRA rebels meet Uganda's Museveni"], BBC News, 21 October 2006; [http://irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=56019 "SUDAN: Armed group kills 42 civilians"], ''IRIN'', 20 October 2006; and [http://www.monitor.co.ug/sunday/news/news10227.php "Museveni meets LRA face to face"]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[The Monitor (Uganda)|The Sunday Monitor]]'', 21 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

After a week-long impasse, the LRA and government signed a second truce on 1 November 2006 that mandated the monitoring team until 1 December. The previous agreement had technically expired in September.  As part of the agreement, the army was to withdraw from Owiny Ki-Bul, past a 30-km (18-mi) buffer zone.  The LRA was given a week to regroup at Owiny Ki-Bul, and four weeks to gather at Ri-Kwangba.  Both Kony and Otti refused to enter the camps, citing fear of arrest on the ICC warrants.  The agreement further stated that food would not be provided to LRA units outside the assembly points except in "exceptional circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;[http://irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=56146 "UGANDA: Revised gov't-LRA ceasefire deal signed"], ''IRIN'', 1 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the most significant moments for the LRA during the talks, [[United Nations]] [[Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator]] [[Jan Egeland]] met with Kony and Otti in the hopes of pushing the talks forward on 12 November 2006.  Egeland had previously stated that he would meet with Kony only if the LRA released abducted children and wounded members, but Kony denied that anyone in the LRA was either wounded or held against their will.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6139554.stm "UN envoy sees Uganda rebel chief"], ''BBC News, 12 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The LRA declared that it was withdrawing from the talks on November 30, stating that UPDF had killed three of its fighters.  The deadline for the LRA fighters to finish gathering at the assembly points was 1 December.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=56580 "UGANDA: Talks hit fresh snag amid rebel protest"], ''IRIN'', 30 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Uganda denied the charge.  Also, outgoing [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] appointed [[Joaquim Chissano]], former president of [[Mozambique]], to be the UN envoy to the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=56623 "UGANDA: Museveni optimistic peace will prevail"], ''IRIN'', 5 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The truce was further extended for two more months on 18 December.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6190283.stm "Ugandan LRA rebel truce extended"], ''BBC News'', 18 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 January 2007 Ojul stated that recent comments made by al-Bashir and Kiir clearly signified that the LRA was not welcome any longer in Sudan, and that further talks should occur in [[Kenya]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6255369.stm "Rebels snub Ugandan peace talks"], BBC News, 12 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200701200030.html "Uganda: LRA Quit Juba Talks, Govt Rejects Rebels' Demands"], allAfrica.com, 21 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 March 2007 the LRA stated it would once again return to the Juba talks.&lt;ref&gt;http://allafrica.com/stories/200703140450.html&lt;/ref&gt; After [[South Africa]], [[Kenya]] and [[Mozambique]] agreed to join the peace talks (a demand the LRA had made before it would return to Juba), the next round of talks was held from 13 April to 14 April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200704021629.html allAfrica.com: Uganda: S. Africa, Kenya Join Juba Peace Talks (Page 1 of 1)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In this round, the ceasefire was extended until 30 June 2007, and [[Ri Kwangba]] was the agreed upon assembly point.  The next round of talks was set for 25 April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monitor.co.ug/sunday/news/news041510.php "Govt, LRA talks underway"]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[Sunday Monitor]], 15–21 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resumption==
Following this suspension in the peace talks, the [[Juba Initiative Project]] enabled the resumption of the talks in May 2007, thanks to the efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for LRA-affected areas [[Joaquim Chissano]].  The talks were again mediated by the Government of [[Southern Sudan]], but with the support of the [[United Nations]] and logistic facilitation from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), under the leadership of her local head [[Eliane Duthoit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=72489 "SUDAN-UGANDA: LRA talks, pencils and helicopters"], ''IRIN'', 31 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 June 2007, the sides agreed to the principles of how justice and reconciliation will be handled, the third of the five-point agenda.  The LRA and government agreed that both formal justice procedures and the traditional [[Mato Oput]] ceremony of reconciliation would play a role.  Government delegation spokesperson Barigye Ba-Hoku stated that they would attempt to convince the ICC that this would address their concerns about impunity and that arrests under ICC auspices would not be necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=73010 |title=UGANDA: LRA talks reach agreement on accountability |publisher=Irinnews.org |date=2007-06-30 |accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2007, an LRA delegation led by [[Martin Ojul]] journeyed to Kampala to restate their commitment to a peaceful resolution of the conflict.  Ojul later led the delegation on a tour of northern Uganda to meet victims of the insurgency and ask their forgiveness.

'''Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|aʊ|m|g|ɑr|t|ən}}; {{IPA-de|ˈbaʊmˌgaɐ̯tn̩|lang}}; 17 July&lt;ref name="lekschas"&gt;Jan Lekschas, [http://www.jan.lekschas.de/?section=gene''The Baumgarten Family'']&lt;/ref&gt; 1714 &amp;ndash; 27 May&lt;ref name="lekschas"/&gt; 1762) was a [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]]. He was a brother to theologian [[Siegmund Jakob Baumgarten]] (1706–1757).

==Biography==
Baumgarten was born in [[Berlin]] as the fifth of seven sons of the [[pietist]] [[pastor]] of the [[garrison]], Jacob Baumgarten, and of his wife Rosina Elisabeth. Both his parents died early, and he was taught by Martin Georg Christgau where he learned [[Hebrew]] and became interested in [[Latin]] [[poetry]].

In 1733, during his formal studies at the [[University of Halle]], he attended lectures on the philosophy of [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] by {{Interlanguage link multi|Johann Peter Reusch|de}} at the [[University of Jena]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Theis, Alexander Aichele (eds.), ''Handbuch Christian Wolff'', Springer-Verlag, 2017, p. 442.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baumgarten-alexander-gottlieb.de/leben/druckleben.html Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten (1714-1762)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==
While the meanings of words often change as a result of cultural developments, Baumgarten's reappraisal of [[aesthetics]] is often seen as a key moment in the development of [[aesthetic philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Caygill|first1=Howard|title=Aesthetics and Civil Society: Theories of Art and Society, 1640-1790|date=1982|location=University of Sussex|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Aesthetics_and_Civil_Society.html?id=cOwrnQEACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously the word ''aesthetics'' had merely meant "sensibility" or "responsiveness to stimulation of the senses" in its use by ancient writers. With the development of [[art]] as a commercial enterprise linked to the rise of a ''[[nouveau riche]]'' class across Europe, the purchasing of art inevitably led to the question, "what is good art?". Baumgarten developed aesthetics to mean the study of good and bad "[[Taste (sociology)|taste]]",  thus good and bad art, linking good taste with beauty.

By trying to develop an idea of good and bad taste, he also in turn generated philosophical debate around this new meaning of aesthetics. Without it, there would be no basis for aesthetic debate as there would be no objective criterion, basis for comparison, or reason from which one could develop an objective argument.

===Vistas sobre estética===
[[File:Aesthetica.png|thumb|''Aesthetica'' (1750) by Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]]
Baumgarten appropriated the word ''aesthetics'', which had always meant "sensation", to mean taste or "sense" of beauty. In so doing, he gave the word a different significance, thereby inventing its modern usage. The word had been used differently since the time of the ancient Greeks to mean the ability to receive stimulation from one or more of the five bodily senses. In his ''Metaphysic'', § 451, Baumgarten defined taste, in its wider meaning, as the ability to judge according to the senses, instead of according to the intellect. Such a judgment of taste he saw as based on feelings of pleasure or displeasure. A science of aesthetics would be, for Baumgarten, a deduction of the rules or principles of artistic or natural beauty from individual "taste". Baumgarten may have been motivated to respond to Pierre Bonhours' opinion, published in a pamphlet in the late 17th century, that Germans were incapable of appreciating art and beauty.

==Reception==
In 1781, Kant declared that Baumgarten's aesthetics could never contain objective rules, laws, or principles of natural or artistic beauty.

{{quote|text=The Germans are the only people who presently (1781) have come to use the word ''aesthetic[s]'' to designate what others call the critique of taste. They are doing so on the basis of a false hope conceived by that superb analyst Baumgarten. He hoped to bring our critical judging of the beautiful under rational principles, and to raise the rules for such judging to the level of a lawful science. Yet that endeavor is futile. For, as far as their principal sources are concerned, those supposed rules or criteria are merely empirical. Hence they can never serve as determinate ''a priori'' laws to which our judgment of taste must conform. It is, rather, our judgment of taste which constitutes the proper test for the correctness of those rules or criteria. Because of this it is advisable to follow either of two alternatives. One of these is to stop using this new name ''aesthetic[s]'' in this sense of critique of taste, and to reserve the name ''aesthetic[s]'' for the doctrine of sensibility that is true science. (In doing so we would also come closer to the language of the ancients and its meaning. Among the ancients the division of cognition into ''aisthētá kai noētá'' [sensed or thought] was quite famous.) The other alternative would be for the new ''aesthetic[s]'' to share the name with speculative philosophy. We would then take the name partly in its transcendental meaning, and partly in the psychological meaning. (''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 1, note.)}}
Nine years later, in his ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'', Kant conformed to Baumgarten's new usage and employed the word ''aesthetic'' to mean the judgment of [[Taste (sociology)|taste]] or the estimation of the beautiful. For Kant, an aesthetic judgment is subjective in that it relates to the internal feeling of pleasure or displeasure and not to any qualities in an external object.

In 1897, [[Leo Tolstoy]], in his ''[[What is Art?]]'', criticized Baumgarten's book on aesthetics. Tolstoy opposed "Baumgarten's trinity &amp;mdash; Good, Truth and Beauty…."&lt;ref name="What7"&gt;''[[What is Art?]]'', VII&lt;/ref&gt; Tolstoy asserted that "these words not only have no definite meaning, but they hinder us from giving any definite meaning to existing art…."&lt;ref name="What7" /&gt; Baumgarten, he said, claimed that there are three ways to know perfection: "Beauty is the perfect (the absolute) perceived by the senses. Truth is the perfect perceived by reason. The good is the perfect attained by the moral will."&lt;ref&gt;''[[What is Art?]]'',  III&lt;/ref&gt; Tolstoy, however, contradicted Baumgarten's theory and claimed that good, truth, and beauty have nothing in common and may even oppose each other. 
 
{{quote|text=…the arbitrary uniting of these three concepts served as a basis for the astonishing theory according to which the difference between good art, conveying good feelings, and bad art, conveying wicked feelings, was totally obliterated, and one of the lowest manifestations of art, art for mere pleasure…came to be regarded as the highest art. And art became, not the important thing it was intended to be, but the empty amusement of idle people.(''[[What is Art?]]'', VII.)}}

Whatever the limitations of Baumgarten's theory of aesthetics, [[Frederick Copleston]] credits him with playing a formative role in German aesthetics, extending [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]'s philosophy to topics that Wolff did not consider, and demonstrating the existence of a legitimate topic for philosophical analysis that could not be reduced to abstract logical analysis.&lt;ref name="FC"&gt;Frederick Copleston (1946–1975). ''[[A History of Philosophy (Copleston)|A History of Philosophy]]'', vol. VI.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metaphysics==
For many years, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] used Baumgarten's ''Metaphysica'' as a handbook or manual for his lectures on that topic. &lt;br&gt; [[Georg Friedrich Meier]] translated the Metaphysics from Latin to German, an endeavour which - according to Meier - Baumgarten himself had planned, but could not find the time to execute.

'''Anthony Abela''' (1954–2006) was a major Maltese [[sociologist]]. He mostly specialised in values.

==Life==
[[Abela]] was born at [[Floriana]], Malta, in 1954. He began his studies at the [[University of Malta]], from which he acquired a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Philosophy]] (1976), and pursued further studies at the [[Gregorian University]] in [[Rome]], Italy, from which he acquired a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[Theology]] (1982). He also studied at the [[Centre Sèvres]] in [[Paris]], France, from which he acquired a [[master's degree]] in [[Theology]] (1984); at the [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola University]] of [[Chicago]], U.S. (1987); and at the [[University of Oxford]], England, from which he acquired a [[doctorate]] in [[Sociology]] (1990).

He began teaching at the [[University of Malta]] in 1985, and in 1990, taught at the [[Gregorian University]] in [[Rome]]. He was principal investigator of the European Values Study in Malta, Member of the European Values Steering Committee at [[Tilburg]] in the Netherlands, and served as Evaluator and Reviewer of social research projects for the [[European Commission]]. He was also the Non-Governmental Maltese Expert on Poverty and Social Inclusion for the European Commission. For three years he was director of the Institute of Social Welfare at the [[University of Malta]].

His research interests included comparative European values studies, sociology of the family, sociology of religion, youth, gender, poverty, and social policy. Until his premature death on April 4, 2006, at the relatively young age of 52, he was an associate professor of [[Sociology]] and [[Social Policy]].

This theory is proposed by [[Grafton Elliott-Smith]] (1912) who was a neuroanatomist who was chiefly concerned with the emergence of the primate brain.

The '''arboreal theory''' claims that [[primate]]s evolved from their ancestors by adapting to [[arboreal]] life.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy,G.E. ''Paleoanthroplogy'' (1980) New York: McGRAW-HILL BOOK COMPANY.(p.28)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sussman, R. W. (1991). Primate origins and the evolution of angiosperms. American Journal of Primatology, 23(4), 209-223.&lt;/ref&gt;

Primates are thought to have developed several of their [[Trait (biology)|traits]] and [[Habituation|habits]] initially while living in trees.  One key component to this argument is that primates relied on sight over [[Olfaction|smell]].  They were able to develop a keen sense of [[depth perception]], perhaps because of the constant leaping that was necessary to move about the trees.  Primates also developed [[hand]]s and feet that were capable of grasping.  This was also a result of arboreal life, which required a great deal of crawling along branches, and reaching out for fruit and other food.  These early primates were likely to have [[diet (nutrition)|eaten]] foods found in trees, such as flowers, fruits, berries, gums, leaves, and insects.  They are thought to have shifted their diets towards insects in the early [[Cenozoic|Cenozoic era]], when insects became more numerous.

===Analysis Services Multidimensional===
'''Aggregation Manager''' - an advanced interface for manually editing aggregations &lt;br /&gt;
'''Calculation Helpers''' -  enhances the Calculations tab of the cube editor &lt;br /&gt;
'''Column Usage Reports''' - lets you open two reports about column usage: Unused Columns Report + Used Columns Report &lt;br /&gt;
'''Delete Unused Aggregations''' - automates the process of detecting which aggregations are unused and deleting them &lt;br /&gt;
'''Deploy Aggregation Designs''' - deploys just the aggregation designs in a cube. It does not change which aggregation design is assigned to each partition &lt;br /&gt;
'''Deploy MDX Script''' - allows you to right click on a cube in an Analysis Services solution and deploy just the calculation script &lt;br /&gt; 
'''Dimension Data Type Discrepancy Check''' - allows you to check that DSV data types match the data types on the KeyColumns and NameColumn of dimension attributes. It displays any discrepancies and lets you fix them with the click of a button. &lt;br /&gt;
'''Dimension Health Check''' - allows you to check various indications of dimension health &lt;br /&gt; 
'''Dimension Optimization Report''' - This report lists all dimension attributes and hierarchies on rows. On columns, it lists various properties which can be used to optimize dimensions. &lt;br /&gt;
'''Duplicate Role''' -  allows you to copy a role with all of the associated settings and permissions &lt;br /&gt;
'''Many-to-Many Matrix Compression''' - Analyzing the data in a m2m relationship to determine whether it can be compressed significantly requires building a complex SQL query. This feature automates this process and returns a report showing how much each m2m relationship can be compressed. &lt;br /&gt;
'''Measure Group Health Check''' - allows you to check various indications of measure group health. &lt;br /&gt;
'''Non-Default Properties Report''' - will let you see on one screen all properties which have been changed from their defaults. &lt;br /&gt;
'''Parent-Child Dimension Naturalizer''' -  aids in converting parent-child dimensions into natural hierarchies. &lt;br /&gt;
'''Printer Friendly Aggregations''' - allows you print or export to PDF a report that lists every aggregation in a cube. &lt;br /&gt; 
'''Printer Friendly Dimension Usage''' - allows you to view and print a report encompassing all the information from the Dimension Usage tab.  &lt;br /&gt;
'''Roles Report''' - recursively list the members of the role and the members of groups so that you can easily determine which members actually have access via each role &lt;br /&gt;
'''Similar Aggregations''' - allows you to view a report that lists any aggregations which are very similar to each other.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Smart Diff''' - lets you compare versions of a SSAS, SSIS, and SSRS files. BIDS Helper preprocesses XML files so that the diff versus source control is more meaningful.
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Show Extra Properties''' - exposes hidden properties on several Analysis Services objects. It also provides a better UI for editing descriptions on Analysis Services objects.
&lt;br /&gt; 
'''Sync Descriptions''' - if you have spent considerable time entering descriptions for relational tables and columns (for example, using the Kimball Dimensional Modeling Spreadsheet)it can help you import those descriptions to the dimension in Analysis Services.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Test Aggregation Performance''' - test the performance of your aggregations &lt;br /&gt;
'''Tri-State Perspectives''' - this feature operates in the Perspectives tab of the cube designer. It highlights any measure groups or dimensions in which not all visible children are part of the perspective &lt;br /&gt;
'''Update Estimated Counts''' - allows you to update the EstimatedCount property of every dimension attribute and every partition with exact counts &lt;br /&gt;
'''Validate Aggregations''' - allows you to quickly check whether any aggregations violate restrictions or best practices &lt;br /&gt;
'''Visualize Attribute Lattice''' - allows you to visually see the attribute relationships you have defined for a dimension in an Analysis Services solution

===Analysis Services Tabular===
'''Smart Diff''' - lets you compare versions of a SSAS, SSIS, and SSRS files. BIDS Helper preprocesses XML files so that the diff versus source control is more meaningful. &lt;br /&gt;
'''Tabular Actions Editor''' - provides a UI for editing actions for Tabular models. For example, this feature allows the model designer the ability to customize the columns returned by drillthrough. &lt;br /&gt;
'''Tabular Display Folders''' - provides a UI for editing display folders on measures, columns, and hierarchies. All display folders are edited in the same place.&lt;br /&gt;  
'''Tabular HideMemberIf''' - allows HideMemberIf setting to be changed &lt;br /&gt;
'''Tabular Pre-Build''' -  catches the build event and checks features for BIDS Helper settings that have been lost. Because these settings were backed up in annotations, they can be restored, and the user will be prompted if this is necessary. &lt;br /&gt;
'''Tabular Sync Descriptions''' -  if you have spent considerable time entering descriptions for relational tables and columns (for example, using the Kimball Dimensional Modeling Spreadsheet)it can help you import those descriptions to the table in your Tabular model in Analysis Services.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Tabular Translations Editor''' -  allows you to code in one language but display your model to users in another language. For example, you could code in English but display to users in Spanish.

===Integration Services===
'''Batch Property Update''' -  Allows you to update multiple packages properties at once &lt;br /&gt;
'''[[Biml]] Package Generator''' - provides the ability to create packages from [[Business Intelligence Markup Language]] (Biml)&lt;br /&gt;
'''Create Fixed Width Columns''' - allows you to use your Excel spreadsheet to create the column definitions in a few simple steps. &lt;br /&gt;
'''Deploy SSIS Packages''' - lets you quickly deploy SSIS packages directly from BIDS without having to create a deployment manifest and use the Package Installation Wizard. &lt;br /&gt;
'''Design Warnings''' -  provides similar functionality to the Design Warning feature in Analysis Services 2008. It compares the current package against a list of design guidelines, and adds warnings to the Error List in Visual Studio for any items that need to be investigated. &lt;br /&gt;
'''dtsConfig File Formatter''' -  watches for when a window is activated or created for a file with a .dtsConfig extension and automatically initiates the Visual Studio formatting feature &lt;br /&gt;
'''Expression and Configuration Highlighter''' - gives a visual indicator so that the influence of expressions and package configurations can be seen at a glance &lt;br /&gt;
'''Expression List''' - provides a window that lists all the expressions defined in a package &lt;br /&gt;
'''Fix Relative Paths''' - helpful in setting up packages to use relative paths in connection managers and in the path to dtsConfig files &lt;br /&gt;
'''Non-Default Properties Report''' - will let you see on one screen all properties which have been changed from their defaults &lt;br /&gt;
'''Pipeline Component Performance Breakdown''' - automates the methodology for determining which piece of a data flow task is the bottleneck and lets you trend component performance as you try different settings and design alternative &lt;br /&gt;
'''Reset GUIDs''' - resets the IDs for all tasks, connection managers, configurations, event handlers, variables, and the package ID itself &lt;br /&gt;
'''Smart Diff''' - lets you compare versions of a SSAS, SSIS and SSRS files &lt;br /&gt;
'''Sort Project Files''' - adds a "Sort by name" menu option to the "SSIS Packages" folder of an SSIS project in Visual Studio &lt;br /&gt;

'''Bruno Latour''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|t|ʊər}}; {{IPA-fr|latuʁ|lang}}; born 22 June 1947) is a French  [[philosopher of science|philosopher]], [[anthropology|anthropologist]] and [[sociologist]].&lt;ref name="Wheeler, Will 2010, p. 189"&gt;Wheeler, Will. ''Bruno Latour:  Documenting Human and Nonhuman Associations'' Critical Theory for Library and Information Science. Libraries Unlimited, 2010, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;  He is especially known for his work in the field of [[Science and Technology Studies|science and technology studies]] (STS).&lt;ref&gt;See [[Steve Fuller (sociologist)|Steve Fuller]], "Science and Technology Studies", in ''The Knowledge book. Key concepts in philosophy, science and culture'', Acumen (UK) and McGill-Queens University Press (NA), 2007, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; After teaching at the [[École des Mines de Paris]] ([[Centre de Sociologie de l'Innovation]]) from 1982 to 2006, he became Professor at [[Institut d'études politiques de Paris|Sciences Po Paris]] (2006–2017), where he was the scientific director of the Sciences Po Medialab. He retired from several university activities in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;See Latour's "Biography" [http://www.bruno-latour.fr/biography Bruno Latour's official website]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a Centennial Professor at the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coursera.org/instructor/brunolatour|title=Bruno Latour, Instructor - Coursera|website=Coursera|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://english.nd.edu/events/2016/11/03/bruno-latour/|title=Bruno Latour // Events // Department of English // University of Notre Dame|first=ENR/PAZ // Marketing Communications: Web // University of Notre|last=Dame|website=english.nd.edu|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latour is best known for his books ''[[We Have Never Been Modern]]'' (1991; English translation, 1993), ''[[Laboratory Life]]'' (with [[Steve Woolgar]], 1979) and ''[[Science in Action (book)|Science in Action]]'' (1987).&lt;ref name = "Anthropolists-Bio"&gt;Heather Vidmar-McEwen,[http://www.indiana.edu/~wanthro/theory_pages/Latour.htm "Anthropologists biographies: Bruno Latour"], "Anthropologists biographies: Bruno Latour", Indiana University Anthropology Department&lt;/ref&gt; Although his studies of scientific practice were at one time associated with [[social constructionist]]&lt;ref name="Anthropolists-Bio"/&gt; approaches to the philosophy of science, Latour has diverged significantly from such approaches. He is best known for withdrawing from the subjective/objective division and re-developing the approach to work in practice.&lt;ref name="Wheeler, Will 2010, p. 189"/&gt; Latour said in 2017 that he is interested in helping to rebuild trust in science and that some of the authority of science needs to be regained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frazier |first1=Kendrick |authorlink=Kendrick Frazier|title='Science Wars' Veteran Latour Now Wants to Help Rebuild Trust in Science |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=1 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Along with [[Michel Callon]] and [[John Law (sociologist)|John Law]], Latour is one of the primary developers of [[actor–network theory]] (ANT), a constructionist approach influenced by the [[ethnomethodology]] of [[Harold Garfinkel]], the generative [[semiotics]] of [[Algirdas Julien Greimas]], and (more recently) the sociology of [[Émile Durkheim]]'s rival [[Gabriel Tarde]].&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, vol. 39 (5), pp. 655-666; https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307  &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elder-Vass, D., 2015. Disassembling actor-network theory. Philosophy of the Social Sciences, 45(1), pp.100-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Latour's [[monograph]]s earned him a 10th place among most-cited book authors in the humanities and social sciences for the year 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=405956&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=The most cited authors of books in the humanities |publisher=timeshighereducation.co.uk |date=26 March 2009 |accessdate=16 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Latour is related to a well-known family of winemakers from [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], but is not associated with the similarly named estate in [[Bordeaux]].&lt;ref&gt;Blok, A. &amp; Elgaard Jensen, T. ''Bruno Latour: hybrid thoughts in a hybrid world''. London: Routledge, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a student, Latour originally focused on philosophy and was deeply influenced by [[Michel Serres]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}  Latour received his Ph.D. in [[theology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Skirbekk|first1=Gunnar|title=Bruno Latour’s anthropology of the moderns|url=http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/commentary/bruno-latours-anthropology-of-the-moderns|website=Radicalphilosophy.com|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[François Rabelais University|Université de Tours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~wanthro/theory_pages/Latour.htm|title="Bruno Latour" by Heather Vidmar-McEwen|publisher=|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quickly developed an interest in [[anthropology]], and undertook fieldwork in [[Ivory Coast]] which resulted in a brief monograph on decolonization, race, and industrial relations.&lt;ref name = "Anthropolists-Bio"/&gt;

After spending more than twenty years at the [[Centre de sociologie de l'innovation]] at the [[École des Mines]] in [[Paris]], Latour moved in 2006 to [[Sciences Po]], where he was the first occupant of a chair named for [[Gabriel Tarde]].  In recent years he also served as one of the curators of successful art exhibitions at the [[Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie]] in [[Karlsruhe]], [[Germany]], including "Iconoclash" (2002) and "Making Things Public" (2005). In 2005 he also held the Spinoza Chair of Philosophy at the [[University of Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uva.nl/en/disciplines/philosophy/home/components-centrecolumn/the-spinoza-chair.html|title=The Spinoza Chair - Philosophy - University of Amsterdam|first=Universiteit van|last=Amsterdam|website=www.uva.nl|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
On 22 May 2008, Latour was awarded an honorary doctorate by the [[Université de Montréal]] on the occasion of an [[organizational communication]] conference held in honor of the work of [[James R. Taylor]], on whom Latour has had an important influence. He holds several other honorary doctorates, as well as France's [[Légion d'Honneur]] (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bruno-latour.fr/biography|title=Biography - bruno-latour.fr|website=www.bruno-latour.fr|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holberg Prize===
On 13 March 2013, he was announced as the winner of the 2013 [[Holberg Prize]].&lt;ref name="holberg1"&gt;[http://www.holbergprisen.no/en/holberg-prize-2013.html Bruno Latour wins the 2013 Holberg Prize], ''Holberg Prize''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="holberg2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2013/03/13/l-anthropologue-francais-bruno-latour-distingue-en-norvege_1847284_3224.html|title=L'anthropologue français Bruno Latour reçoit le prix Holberg en Norvège|website=Le Monde.fr|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="holberg3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/kultur/Holbergprisen-til-Bruno-Latour-7146138.html|title=Holbergprisen til Bruno Latour|publisher=|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize committee stated that "Bruno Latour has undertaken an ambitious analysis and reinterpretation of modernity, and has challenged fundamental concepts such as the distinction between modern and pre-modern, nature and society, human and non-human." The committee states that "the impact of Latour's work is evident internationally and far beyond studies of the history of science, art history, history, philosophy, anthropology, geography, theology, literature and law."&lt;ref name="holberg1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="holberg2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="holberg3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://holbergprisen.no/en/bruno-latour Holberg International Memorial Prize 2013: Bruno Latour. Citation of the Holberg Prize Academic Committee], ''Holberg Prize''&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 article in [[Aftenposten]] by [[Jon Elster]] criticised the conferment to Latour, by saying "The question is, does he deserve the prize."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Den uforståelige Latour|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/Den-uforstaelige-Latour-7183458.html#.UXsG0Uqg1t0|newspaper=[[Aftenposten]]|date=24 April 2013|page=7 Debatt|quote=Spørsmålet er om han fortjener prisen.}}&lt;/ref&gt; …"If the statutes [of the award] had used new knowledge as a main criteria, instead of one of several, then he would be completely unqualified in my opinion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Den uforståelige Latour|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/Den-uforstaelige-Latour-7183458.html#.UXsG0Uqg1t0|newspaper=[[Aftenposten]]|date=24 April 2013|page=7 Debatt|quote=Hvis statuttene hadde brukt ny kunnskap som hovedkriterium, i stedet for ett av flere kriterier, ville han etter min mening ha vært fullstendig ukvalifisert.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main works ==

===''Laboratory Life''===
After his early career efforts, Latour shifted his research interests to focus on laboratory scientists.  Latour rose in importance{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} following the 1979 publication of ''Laboratory Life:  the Social Construction of Scientific Facts'' with co-author [[Steve Woolgar]]. In the book, the authors undertake an [[ethnography|ethnographic]] study of a [[neuroendocrinology]] research laboratory at the [[Salk Institute]].&lt;ref name = "Anthropolists-Bio"/&gt; This early work argued that naïve descriptions of the [[scientific method]], in which theories stand or fall on the outcome of a single experiment, are inconsistent with actual laboratory practice.

In the laboratory, Latour and Woolgar observed that a typical experiment produces only inconclusive data that is attributed to failure of the apparatus or experimental method, and that a large part of scientific training involves learning how to make the subjective decision of what data to keep and what data to throw out. Latour and Woolgar argued that, for untrained observers, the entire process resembles not an unbiased search for truth and accuracy but a mechanism for ignoring data that contradicts scientific orthodoxy.

Latour and Woolgar produced a highly heterodox and controversial picture of the sciences.  Drawing on the work of [[Gaston Bachelard]], they advance the notion that the objects of scientific study are ''socially constructed'' within the laboratory—that they cannot be attributed with an existence outside of the instruments that measure them and the minds that interpret them.  They view scientific activity as a system of beliefs, oral traditions and culturally specific practices— in short, science is reconstructed not as a procedure or as a set of principles but as a culture. Latour's 1987 book ''Science in Action:  How to Follow Scientists and Engineers through Society'' is one of the key texts of the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]] in which he famously wrote his Second Principle as follows: "Scientist and engineers speak in the name of new allies that they have shaped and enrolled; representatives among other representatives, they add these unexpected resources to tip the balance of force in their favor."

Some of Latour's position and findings in this era provoked vehement rebuttals. Gross and Leavitt argue that Latour's position becomes absurd when applied to non-scientific contexts: e.g., if a group of coworkers in a windowless room were debating whether or not it were raining outside and went outdoors to discover raindrops in the air and puddles on the soil, Latour's hypothesis would assert that the rain was socially constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Paul R. and Levitt, Norman (1997). ''[[Higher Superstition]]: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels with Science.'' Johns Hopkins University Press, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, philosopher [[John Searle]]&lt;ref&gt;Searle, John R. (2009) "Why Should You Believe It?" ''The New York Review of Books'', 24 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that Latour's "extreme social constructivist" position is seriously flawed on several points, and furthermore has inadvertently "comical results."

===''The Pasteurization of France''===
After a research project examining the sociology of [[primatology|primatologists]], Latour followed up the themes in ''Laboratory Life'' with ''Les Microbes: guerre et paix'' (published in English as ''The Pasteurization of France'' in 1988).  In it, he reviews the life and career of one of France's most famous scientists [[Louis Pasteur]] and his discovery of microbes, in the fashion of a political biography.  Latour highlights the social forces at work in and around Pasteur's career and the uneven manner in which his theories were accepted.  By providing more explicitly ideological explanations for the acceptance of Pasteur's work more easily in some quarters than in others, he seeks to undermine the notion that the acceptance and rejection of scientific theories is primarily, or even usually, a matter of experiment, evidence or reason.  Another work, [[Aramis, or the Love of Technology|''Aramis, or, The Love of Technology'']] focuses on the history of an unsuccessful mass-transit project.

===''We Have Never Been Modern''===
Latour's work ''Nous n’avons jamais été modernes : Essais d’anthropologie symétrique'' was first published in French in 1991, and then in English in 1993 as ''[[We Have Never Been Modern]]''.

Latour encouraged the reader of this anthropology of science to re-think and re-evaluate our mental landscape.  He evaluated the work of scientists and contemplated the contribution of the [[scientific method]] to knowledge and work, blurring the distinction across various fields and disciplines.&lt;ref name="Wheeler, Will 2010, p. 190"&gt;Wheeler, Will. ''Bruno Latour:  Documenting Human and Nonhuman Associations'' Critical Theory for Library and Information Science. Libraries Unlimited, 2010, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;	

Latour argued that society has never really been modern and promoted nonmodernism (or amodernism) over [[postmodernism]], [[modernism]], or antimodernism.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=47, 134}} His stance was that we have never been modern and minor divisions alone separate Westerners now from other collectives.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=47, 114}} Latour viewed modernism as an era that believed it had annulled the entire past in its wake.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=69}} He presented the antimodern reaction as defending such entities as spirit, rationality, liberty, society, God, or even the past.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=47}} Postmoderns, according to Latour, also accepted the modernistic abstractions as if they were real.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=48}} In contrast, the nonmodern approach reestablished symmetry between science and technology on the one hand and society on the other.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=138}} Latour also referred to the impossibility of returning to premodernism because it precluded the large scale experimentation which was a benefit of modernism.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=140}}

Latour attempted to prove through case studies the fallacy in the old object/subject and Nature/Society compacts of modernity, which can be traced back to Plato.&lt;ref name="Wheeler, Will 2010, p. 190"/&gt;{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=79}} He refused the concept of "out there" versus "in here".&lt;ref name="Wheeler, Will 2010, p. 192"&gt;Wheeler, Will. ''Bruno Latour:  Documenting Human and Nonhuman Associations'' Critical Theory for Library and Information Science. Libraries Unlimited, 2010, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; He rendered the object/subject distinction as simply unusable and charted a new approach towards knowledge, work, and circulating reference.&lt;ref name="Wheeler, Will 2010, p. 192"/&gt; Latour considered nonmoderns to be playing on a different field, one vastly different than that of post-moderns.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=48}} He referred to it as much broader and much less polemical, a creation of an unknown territory, which he playfully referred to as the Middle Kingdom.{{sfn|Latour|1993|p=48}}

In 1998, historian of science Margaret C. Jacob argued that Latour's politicized account of the development of modernism in the 17th century is "a fanciful escape from modern Western history".&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, Margaret C (1998). "Latour's Version of the Seventeenth Century," pp. 240-254 in ''A House Built on Sand: Exposing Postmodernist Myths About Science'', [[Noretta Koertge]] (editor), NY: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0195117255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Pandora's Hope''===

''Pandora's Hope'' (1999) marks a return to the themes Latour explored in ''[[Science in Action (book)|Science in Action]]'' and ''[[We Have Never Been Modern]]''. It uses independent but thematically linked essays and case studies to question the authority and reliability of scientific knowledge. Latour uses a narrative, anecdotal approach in a number of the essays, describing his work with [[pedology (soil study)|pedologists]] in the Amazon rainforest, the development of the pasteurization process, and the research of French atomic scientists at the outbreak of the Second World War. Latour states that this specific, anecdotal approach to science studies is essential to gaining a full understanding of the discipline: "The only way to understand the reality of science studies is to follow what science studies do best, that is, paying close attention to the details of scientific practice" (p.&amp;nbsp;24). Some authors have criticized Latour's methodology, including Katherine Pandora, a history of science professor at the University of Oklahoma. In her review of ''Pandora's Hope'', Katherine Pandora states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[Latour's] writing can be stimulating, fresh and at times genuinely moving, but it can also display a distractingly mannered style in which a rococo zeal for compounding metaphors, examples, definitions and abstractions can frustrate even readers who approach his work with the best of intentions (notwithstanding the inclusion of a nine-page glossary of terms and liberal use of diagrams in an attempt to achieve the utmost clarity)".&lt;ref name="Pandora"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/science-studies-study |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515142825/http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/science-studies-study |archive-date=15 May 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In addition to his epistemological concerns, Latour also explores the political dimension of science studies in ''Pandora's Hope''. Two of the chapters draw on Plato's ''Gorgias'' as a means of investigating and highlighting the distinction between content and context. As Katherine Pandora states in her review:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It is hard not to be caught up in the author's obvious delight in deploying a classic work from antiquity to bring current concerns into sharper focus, following along as he manages to leave the reader with the impression that the protagonists Socrates and Callicles are not only in dialogue with each other but with Latour as well."&lt;ref name="Pandora" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Although Latour frames his discussion with a classical model, his examples of fraught political issues are all current and of continuing relevance: global warming, the spread of mad cow disease, and the carcinogenic effects of smoking are all mentioned at various points in ''Pandora's Hope''. In Felix Stalder's article "Beyond constructivism: towards a realistic realism", he summarizes Latour's position on the political dimension of science studies as follows: "These scientific debates have been artificially kept open in order to render impossible any political action against these problems and those who profit from them".&lt;ref name="Stalder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://felix.openflows.com/html/pandora.html|title=Felix Stalder: Latour's Pandora's Hope (Review)|website=felix.openflows.com|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Why Has Critique Run Out of Steam?"===
In a 2004 article,&lt;ref&gt;Latour, Bruno. (2004) [http://winteranthology.com/?vol=5&amp;author=latour&amp;title=critique "Why Has Critique Run out of Steam? From Matters of Fact to Matters of Concern"]. ''Critical Inquiry'', Vol. 30, No. 2, Winter 2004, pp. 225-248&lt;/ref&gt; Latour questioned the fundamental premises on which he had based most of his career, asking, "Was I wrong to participate in the invention of this field known as science studies?" He undertakes a trenchant critique of his own field of study and, more generally, of social criticism in contemporary academia. He suggests that critique, as currently practiced, is bordering on irrelevancy. To maintain any vitality, Latour argues that social critiques require a drastic reappraisal: "our critical equipment deserves as much critical scrutiny as the Pentagon budget." (p.&amp;nbsp;231) To regain focus and credibility, Latour argues that social critiques must embrace [[empiricism]], to insist on the "cultivation of a stubbornly realist attitude -- to speak like [[William James]]". (p.&amp;nbsp;233)

Latour suggests that about 90% of contemporary social criticism displays one of two approaches which he terms "the fact position and the fairy position." (p.&amp;nbsp;237) The fairy position is [[fetishism|anti-fetishist]], arguing that "objects of belief" (e.g., religion, arts) are merely concepts created by the projected wishes and desires of the "naive believer"; the "fact position" argues that individuals are dominated, often covertly and without their awareness, by external forces (e.g., economics, gender). (p.&amp;nbsp;238) "Do you see now why it feels so good to be a critical mind?” asks Latour: no matter which position you take, "You’re always right!” (p.&amp;nbsp;238-239) Social critics tend to use anti-fetishism against ideas they personally reject; to use "an unrepentant positivist" approach for fields of study they consider valuable; all the while thinking as "a perfectly healthy sturdy realist for what you really cherish." (p.&amp;nbsp;241) These inconsistencies and [[double standards]] go largely unrecognized in social critique because "there is never any crossover between the two lists of objects in the fact position and the fairy position." (p.&amp;nbsp;241)

The practical result of these approaches being taught to millions of students in elite universities for several decades is a widespread and influential "critical barbarity" that has—like a malign virus created by a "[[mad scientist]]"—thus far proven impossible to control. Most troubling, Latour notes that critical ideas have been appropriated by those he describes as [[conspiracy theorists]], including [[global warming skepticism|global warming skeptics]] and the [[9/11 Truth movement]]: "Maybe I am taking conspiracy theories too seriously, but I am worried to detect, in those mad mixtures of knee-jerk disbelief, punctilious demands for proofs, and free use of powerful explanation from the social neverland, many of the weapons of social critique." (p.&amp;nbsp;230)

The conclusion of the article is to argue for a positive framing of critique, to help understand how matters of concern can be supported rather than undermined: "The critic is not the one who lifts the rugs from under the feet of the naïve believers, but the one who offers the participants arenas in which to gather. The critic is not the one who alternates haphazardly between antifetishism and positivism like the drunk iconoclast drawn by Goya, but the one for whom, if something is constructed, then it means it is fragile and thus in great need of care and caution."

===''Reassembling the Social''&lt;!--linked from 'Actor–network theory'--&gt;===
In ''Reassembling the Social'' (2005),&lt;ref name = "Primary"&gt;Latour, Bruno. '''Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor–Network Theory''.  Oxford, UK: Oxford UP, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Latour continues a reappraisal of his work, developing what he calls a "practical [[metaphysics]]", which calls "real" anything that an actor (one whom we are studying) claims as a source of motivation for action.  So if someone says, "I was inspired by God to be charitable to my neighbors" we are obliged to recognize the "[[ontological]] weight" of their claim, rather than attempting to replace their belief in God's presence with "social stuff", like class, gender, [[imperialism]], etc. Latour’s nuanced metaphysics demands the existence of a plurality of worlds, and the willingness of the researcher to chart ever more. He argues that researchers must give up the hope of fitting their actors into a structure or framework, but Latour believes the benefits of this sacrifice far outweigh the downsides: "Their complex metaphysics would at least be respected, their recalcitrance recognized, their objections deployed, their multiplicity accepted."&lt;ref name="Primary" /&gt;

For Latour, to talk about [[metaphysics]] or [[ontology]]–what really is–means paying close empirical attention to the various, contradictory institutions and ideas that bring people together and inspire them to act. Here is Latour's description of metaphysics:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If we call metaphysics the discipline . . . that purports to define the basic structure of the world, then empirical metaphysics is what the controversies over agencies lead to since they ceaselessly populate the world with new drives and, as ceaselessly, contest the existence of others.  The question then becomes how to explore the actors' own metaphysics.&lt;ref name="Primary" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A more traditional metaphysicist might object, arguing that this means there are multiple, contradictory realities, since there are "controversies over agencies" – since there is a plurality of contradictory ideas that people claim as a basis for action (God, nature, the state, sexual drives, personal ambition, and so on). This objection manifests the most important difference between traditional philosophical metaphysics and Latour's nuance: for Latour, there is no "basic structure of reality" or a single, self-consistent world. An unknowably large multiplicity of realities, or "worlds" in his terms, exists–one for each actor’s sources of [[agency (sociology)|agency]], inspirations for action. Actors bring "the real" (metaphysics) into being. The task of the researcher is not to find one "basic structure" that explains agency, but to recognize "the metaphysical innovations proposed by ordinary actors".&lt;ref name="Primary" /&gt; Mapping those metaphysical innovations involves a strong dedication to [[relativism]], Latour argues. The relativist researcher "learns the actors' language," records what they say about what they do, and does not appeal to a higher "structure" to "explain" the actor's motivations. The relativist "takes seriously what [actors] are obstinately saying" and "follows the direction indicated by their fingers when they designate what 'makes them act'". The relativist recognizes the plurality of metaphysics that actors bring into being, and attempts to map them rather than reducing them to a single structure or explanation.

'''Charlie Dunbar Broad''' (30 December 1887 – 11 March 1971), usually cited as '''C. D. Broad''', was an English [[epistemology|epistemologist]], [[history of philosophy|historian of philosophy]], [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]], [[ethics|moral philosopher]], and writer on the philosophical aspects of psychical research. He was known for his thorough and dispassionate examinations of [[argument]]s in such works as ''Scientific Thought'', published in 1923, ''The Mind and Its Place in Nature'', published in 1925, and ''An Examination of McTaggart's Philosophy'', published in 1933.

Broad's essay on "Determinism, Indeterminism, and Libertarianism" in ''Ethics and the History of Philosophy'' (1952) introduced the philosophical terms "occurrent causation" and "non-occurrent causation", which became the basis for today's "agent causal" and "event causal" distinctions in the debates on [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian]] [[free will]].

== Biography ==
Broad was born in [[Harlesden]], in [[Middlesex]], England.&lt;ref&gt;Harlesden was part of Middlesex until 1965; today it is part of the [[London Borough of Brent]] in [[Greater London]].&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Dulwich College]] from 1900 until 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, S. (1981): "God's Gift. A Living History of Dulwich College", London: Heinemann, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;  He gained a scholarship to study at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1906. In 1910 he graduated with [[British undergraduate degree classification|First-Class Honours]], with distinction.

In 1911, he became a Fellow of Trinity College. This was a non-residential position, which enabled him to also accept a position he had applied for as an assistant lecturer at [[St Andrews University]]. He was later made a lecturer at [[St Andrews University]], and remained there until 1920. He was appointed professor at [[Bristol University]] in 1920, and worked there until 1923, when he returned to Trinity College as a College lecturer. He was a lecturer in 'moral science' in the [[Faculty of philosophy cambridge|Faculty of philosophy at Cambridge University]] from 1926 until 1931. In 1931, he was appointed 'Sidgwick Lecturer' at Cambridge University. He kept this role until 1933, when he was appointed [[Knightbridge Professor of Philosophy|Knightbridge Professor of Moral Philosophy]] at Cambridge University, a position he held for twenty years, until 1953.

Broad was President of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1927 to 1928, and again from 1954 to 1955. He was also President of the [[Society for Psychical Research]] in 1935 and 1958.

Broad was openly homosexual at a time when homosexual acts were illegal. In March 1958, Broad along with fellow philosophers [[A.J. Ayer]] and [[Bertrand Russell]], writer [[J.B. Priestley]] and 27 others sent a letter to ''[[The Times]]'' which urged the acceptance of the ''[[Wolfenden Report]]'s'' recommendation that homosexual acts should 'no longer be a criminal offence'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Noel Gilroy Annan|Annan, N.G.]], [[Clement Attlee|Attlee]], [[A. J. Ayer]], [[Robert Boothby]], [[C. M. Bowra]], C. D. Broad, [[Lord David Cecil|David Cecil]], L. John Collins, [[Alex Comfort]], A. E. Dyson, Robert Exon, [[Geoffrey Faber]], [[Jacquetta Hawkes]], [[Trevor Huddleston]], [[Julian Huxley|C. R. Julian Huxley]], [[C. Day-Lewis]], W. R. Niblett, [[J. B. Priestley]], [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], [[Donald Soper|Donald O. Soper]], [[Stephen Spender]], Mary Stocks, [[A. J. P. Taylor]], [[E. M. W. Tillyard]], [[Alexander Roper Vidler|Alec R. Vidler]], [[Kenneth Walker (author)|Kenneth Walker]], [[Leslie Weatherhead|Leslie D. Weatherhead]], [[C. V. Wedgwood]], [[Angus Wilson]], [[John Wisdom]], and [[Barbara Wootton]]. March 7, 1958. 'Letter to the Editor'. ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychical research ==
Broad argued that if research showed that psychic events occur, this would challenge philosophical theories of "[[basic limiting principles]]" in at least five ways:

# [[Backward causation]], the future affecting the past, is rejected by many philosophers, but would be shown to occur if, for example, people could predict the future.
# One common argument against [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]], that is the belief that minds are non-physical, and bodies physical, is that physical and non-physical things cannot interact. However, this would be shown to be possible if people can move physical objects by thought ([[telekinesis]]).
# Similarly, philosophers tend to be [[Skepticism|skeptical]] about claims that non-physical 'stuff' could interact with anything. This would also be challenged if [[mind]]s are shown to be able to communicate with each other, as would be the case if [[telepathy|mind-reading]] is possible.
# Philosophers generally accept that we can only learn about the world through [[reason]] and [[perception]]. This belief would be challenged if people were able to psychically perceive events in other places.
# [[Physicalism|Physicalist]] philosophers believe that there cannot be persons without bodies. If ghosts were shown to exist, this view would be challenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0031819100007452 | last1 = Broad | first1 = C.

== Free will ==
In his essay "Determinism, Indeterminism, and Libertarianism", Broad argued for "non-occurrent causation" as "literally determined by the agent or self." The agent could be considered as a substance or continuant, and not by a total cause which contains as factors events in and dispositions of the agent. Thus our efforts would be completely determined, but their causes would not be prior events.

New series of events would then originate which he called "continuants." These are essentially ''[[causa sui]]''.

[[Peter van Inwagen]] says that Broad formulated an excellent version of what van Inwagen has called the "Consequence Argument" in defense of [[incompatibilism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1990">'''Clemens Baeumker''' (16 September 1853 – 7 October 1924) was a [[Germany|German]] [[historian of philosophy]].

Baeumker was born in [[Paderborn]] to a [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] teacher. He studied philosophy, [[theology]], and [[philology]] in Paderborn and later at the [[University of Münster]], from which he obtained a doctorate in 1877. From 1879 he was a gymnasium lecturer in Münster.

Through the efforts of [[Georg von Hertling]] he was appointed professor of philosophy at the [[University of Breslau]] in 1883, where he remained until 1900. In that year he moved to the [[University of Bonn]], and in 1903 to the [[University of Strasbourg]], where he filled the chair vacated by [[Wilhelm Windelband]]. In 1912 he moved to the [[University of Munich]], filling the chair vacated by his friend von Hertling. He died in Munich in 1924.

Baeumker was known in particular for his studies in the history of [[medieval philosophy]].

'''''Democracy Realized: The Progressive Alternative''''' is a 1998 book by philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]. In the book, Unger sets forth a program of "democratic experimentalism" that challenges and defies the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] consensus that there are few alternatives for the progressive reform of democratic and market structures.

==Overview==

In ''Democracy Realized'', Unger describes the change in the locus of worldwide ideological conflict since the collapse of communism from the old conflict between statism and privatism, to the new ideological conflict about alternative forms of economic, social, and political organization. Unger notes the persistent difficulty in formulating credible alternatives to the neoliberal program in this setting. In the book, he presents a program for overcoming these difficulties through a practice he describes as “democratic experimentalism.”

At the heart of Unger’s productivist program is his explanation of the difference, in business firms, between vanguard production and rearguard production. He contends that the practices of vanguardist production, which include continuous education, a softened contrast between task-defining and task-executing activities, a culture of cooperation between vanguardist firms, and a practice of permanent experiment, already exist in relatively isolated segments of the economy that have greater links to each other, across national borders, than they do to the rearguard economies of their own countries. The vanguardist practices modeled by these firms and industries, Unger argues, are key to productive progress in the contemporary world, and should be extended beyond the productive vanguard to all areas of society, with the assistance of a government reconfigured along democratic experimentalist lines. Unger sets forth the changes he envisions in government, including mechanisms to break impasse between components of government, provisions to heighten political mobilization, expanded and democratized access to capital, a higher social savings rate, significant resources devoted to social endowment, and a central role to an emancipatory school that would train children, as little prophets, to become an informed, creative, and mobilized citizenry of the [[empowered democracy]] that Unger envisions.

Unger concludes the book with a manifesto consisting of thirteen theses that sum up the principles of democratic experimentalism.

==Reception==

[[Anthony Barnett (writer)|Anthony Barnett]], reviewing ''Democracy Realized'' in the [[The Times Literary Supplement|''Times Literary Supplement'']], praised the book highly:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A short, exceptionally sustained argument .... Here [Unger] is in top form, as he advocates the need for democracy. He is neither earnest nor predictable. ... Unger's arguments really are different from both sides of the familiar Lefts and Rights. His is an anti-Marxist, anti-Keynesian critique of neoliberalism ... In the course of it, he combines high theory with striking comparisons of Indian, American and Brazilian democracy.{{sfn|Barnett|2000|p=13}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Ruth Levitas]], writing in the journal ''Critical Horizons'', considered ''Democracy Realized'' alongside [[Richard Rorty]]'s book ''[[Achieving Our Country]]''. Levitas described ''Democracy Realized'' as a &lt;blockquote&gt;summary statement of Unger's hopes for a gradual move from the global ''status quo'' to a world that is more democratic and more economically just, through a process he describes as democratic experimentalism. Here Unger's arguments are pitched in terms of the institutional structures of society, and a process of change of those economic, social and political structures and processes through step-by-step improvisation and collective learning."{{sfn|Levitas|2008|p=53}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Levitas concluded her review of Unger's work by stating that Unger's argument is marked by a "cautious but deeply optimistic openness."{{sfn|Levitas|2008|p=58}} Levitas suggests that although Unger "reject[s] the terminology of utopia," he "may actually be utopian in the best sense of the word."{{sfn|Levitas|2008|p=58}}

Michael Rustin, writing in the ''[[New Left Review]]'', noted that Unger's work first came to prominence before the collapse of Communist regimes around the world, and remarked that ''Democracy Realized'' shows "how Unger's thought weathered the upheavals of the past decades..."{{sfn|Rustin|2004|p=136}} Unger, Rustin concludes, is "defiantly committed to finding a radical alternative in the spirit of a new left .... As a global democratic movement against neoliberalism seems to be growing ... his moment as an inspirational social theorist may be about to arrive."{{sfn|Rustin|2004|p=147}}

Fred Block reviewed ''Democracy Realized'' for ''[[Contemporary Sociology]]''. Block described ''Democracy Realized'' as "Unger's effort to make his political vision accessible to readers who lack his erudition and theoretical sophistication."{{sfn|Block|2000|p=855}} Block praised ''Democracy Realized'', writing, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;For those who find current discussions of the "[[Third Way]]" lacking in both political and intellectual nourishment, Unger's book provides a veritable feast of ideas. His critiques of both social democracy and existing institutional arrangements are often eloquent and original, and the political program strikes the correct balance between radical aspirations and the imperatives of actual politics.{{sfn|Block|2000|p=856}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Disarmament''' is the act of reducing, limiting, or abolishing [[weapons]]. Disarmament generally refers to a country's [[military]] or specific type of weaponry. Disarmament is often taken to mean total elimination of [[weapons of mass destruction]], such as [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear arms]]. General and Complete Disarmament was defined by the United Nations General Assembly as the elimination of all WMD, coupled with the “balanced reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments, based on the principle of undiminished security of the parties with a view to promoting or enhancing stability at a lower military level, taking into account the need of all States to protect their security.”&lt;ref name="UN First Special Session on Disarmament"&gt;UN General Assembly, [https://www.un.org/disarmament/HomePage/SSOD/A-S-10-4.pdf Final Document of the First Special Session on Disarmament] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117222949/http://www.un.org/disarmament/HomePage/SSOD/A-S-10-4.pdf |date=November 17, 2015 }}, para. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before [[World War I]] at the Hague Peace Conferences in 1899 and 1907 government delegations debated about disarmament and the creation of an international court with binding powers. The court was considered necessary because it was understood that nation-states could not disarm into a vacuum.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} After the war revulsion at the futility and tremendous cost of the war was widespread. A commonly held belief was that the cause of the war had been the escalating buildup of armaments in the previous half century among the [[great power]]s (see [[Anglo-German naval arms race]]). Although the [[Treaty of Versailles]] effectively disarmed Germany, a clause was inserted that called on all the great powers to likewise progressively disarm over a period of time. The newly formed [[League of Nations]] made this an explicit goal in the [[Covenant of the League of Nations|covenant of the league]], which committed its signatories to reduce armaments ‘to the lowest point consistent with national safety and the enforcement by common action of international obligations’.

[[File:Martin Kobler addresses a ceremony.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Kobler]] addresses attendees at a disarmament ceremony in [[Goma]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]]]
One of the earliest successful achievements in disarmament was obtained with the [[Washington Naval Treaty]]. Signed by the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy, it prevented the continued construction of [[capital ship]]s and limited ships of other classification to under 10,000 tons displacement. The size of the three country's navies (the [[Royal Navy]], [[United States Navy]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]) was set at the ratio 5-5-3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Marriott|first=Leo|title=Treaty Cruisers: The First International Warship Building Competition|publisher=Pen &amp; Sword|place=Barnsley|year=2005|ISBN=1-84415-188-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 the Temporary Mixed Commission on Armaments was set up by the League of Nations to explore possibilities for disarmament.  Proposals ranged from abolishing [[chemical warfare]] and [[strategic bombing]] to the limitation of more conventional weapons, such as tanks.  A draft treaty was assembled in 1923 that made aggressive war illegal and bound the member states to defend victims of aggression by force. Since the onus of responsibility would, in practice, be on the great powers of the League, it was vetoed by the British, who feared that this pledge would strain its own commitment to police the [[British Empire|empire]].
 
A further commission in 1926, set up to explore the possibilities for the reduction of army size, met similar difficulties, prompting the French [[Foreign Minister]] [[Aristide Briand]] and US [[Secretary of State]] [[Frank Kellogg]] to draft a treaty known as the [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]], which denounced war of aggression. Although there were 65 signatories to the pact, it achieved nothing, as it set out no guidelines for action in the event of a war.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/kbpact.htm|title=Kellogg-Briand Pact 1928|publisher=[[Yale University]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509201753/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/imt/kbpact.htm|archivedate=2012-05-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A final attempt was made at the [[Geneva Disarmament Conference]] from 1932–37, chaired by former British Foreign Secretary [[Arthur Henderson]]. Germany demanded the revision of the Versailles Treaty and the granting of military parity with the other powers, while France was determined to keep Germany demilitarised for its own security. Meanwhile, the British and Americans were not willing to offer France security commitments in exchange for conciliation with Germany. The talks broke down in 1933, when [[Adolf Hitler]] withdrew Germany from the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johndclare.net/league_of_nations4_disarmament.htm|title= The League And Disarmament: A Story Of Failure}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear disarmament===
{{Main article|Nuclear disarmament}} 
[[Image:US and USSR nuclear stockpiles.svg|thumb| [[United States]] and [[USSR]]/[[Russia]]n [[nuclear weapons]] stockpiles, 1945-2006. These numbers include warheads not actively deployed, including those on reserve status or scheduled for dismantlement. Stockpile totals do not necessarily reflect nuclear capabilities since they ignore size, range, type, and delivery mode.]]

Nuclear disarmament refers to both the act of reducing or eliminating [[nuclear weapons]] and to the end state of a nuclear-free world, in which nuclear weapons are completely eliminated.

In the United Kingdom, the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] held an inaugural public meeting at [[Central Hall, Westminster]], on 17 February 1958, attended by five thousand people. After the meeting a few hundred left to demonstrate at [[Downing Street]].&lt;ref name=Minnion&gt;John Minnion and Philip Bolsover (eds.) ''The CND Story'', Alison and Busby, 1983, {{ISBN|0-85031-487-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PREcnd.htm |title=Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) |publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514024607/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PREcnd.htm |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CND's declared policies were the unconditional renunciation of the use, production of or dependence upon nuclear weapons by Britain and the bringing about of a general disarmament convention. The first [[Aldermaston Marches|Aldermaston March]] was organised by the CND and took place at [[Easter]] 1958, when several thousand people marched for four days from [[Trafalgar Square]], London, to the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment|Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] close to [[Aldermaston]] in [[Berkshire]], England, to demonstrate their opposition to nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=CND&gt;[http://www.cnduk.org/pages/binfo/hist.html A brief history of CND]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardianUnlimited:1958&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[Guardian Unlimited]] | title = Early defections in march to Aldermaston | date = 1958-04-05 | url = http://century.guardian.co.uk/1950-1959/Story/0,,105488,00.html | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aldermaston marches continued into the late 1960s when tens of thousands of people took part in the four-day marches.

In 1961, US President [[John F. Kennedy]] gave a speech before the UN General Assembly where he announced the US "intention to challenge the Soviet Union, not to an arms race, but to a peace race - to advance together step by step, stage by stage, until general and complete disarmament has been achieved." He went on to call for a global general and complete disarmament, offering a rough outline for how this could be accomplished:
{{cquote|&lt;blockquote&gt;The program to be presented to this assembly - for general and complete disarmament under effective international control - moves to bridge the gap between those who insist on a gradual approach and those who talk only of the final and total achievement. It would create machinery to keep the peace as it destroys the machinery of war. It would proceed through balanced and safeguarded stages designed to give no state a military advantage over another. It would place the final responsibility for verification and control where it belongs, not with the big powers alone, not with one's adversary or one's self, but in an international organization within the framework of the United Nations. It would assure that indispensable condition of disarmament - true inspection - and apply it in stages proportionate to the stage of disarmament. It would cover delivery systems as well as weapons. It would ultimately halt their production as well as their testing, their transfer as well as their possession. It would achieve under the eyes of an international disarmament organization, a steady reduction in force, both nuclear and conventional, until it has abolished all armies and all weapons except those needed for internal order and a new United Nations Peace Force. And it starts that process now, today, even as the talks begin. In short, general and complete disarmament must no longer be a slogan, used to resist the first steps. It is no longer to be a goal without means of achieving it, without means of verifying its progress, without means of keeping the peace. It is now a realistic plan, and a test - a test of those only willing to talk and a test of those willing to act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/p/io/potusunga/207241.htm|title=Address by President John F.

==Definitions of disarmament==
In his definition of "disarmament", [[David Carlton]] writes in the Oxford University Press Political dictionary, "But confidence in such measures of arms control, especially when unaccompanied by extensive means of verification, has not been strengthened by the revelation that [[Soviet program of biological weapons|the Soviet Union in its last years successfully concealed]] consistent and systematic cheating on its obligations under the [[Biological Weapons Convention]]."  He also notes, "Now a freeze or a mutually agreed increase is not strictly speaking disarmament at all. And such measures may not even be intended to be a first step towards any kind of reduction or abolition. For the aim may simply be to promote stability in force structures. Hence a new term to cover such cases has become fashionable since the 1960s, namely, arms control."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/disarmament?cat=technology disarmament: Definition and Much More from Answers.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book by [[Seymour Melman]], ''[[Inspection for Disarmament]]'', addresses various problems related to the problem of inspection for disarmament, evasion teams, and capabilities and limitations of aerial inspection. Gradually, as the idea of arms control displaced the idea of disarmament, the weaknesses of the present arms control paradigm have created problems for the idea of disarmament itself. {{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

'''Elizabeth Palmer Peabody''' (May 16, 1804 – January 3, 1894) was an American educator who opened the first English-language [[kindergarten]] in the United States.   Long before most educators, Peabody embraced the premise that children's play has intrinsic developmental and educational value.

Peabody also served as the translator for the first English version of a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] scripture which was published in 1844.

==Early years==
Peabody was born in [[Billerica, Massachusetts]] on May 16, 1804. She was the daughter of [[Nathaniel Peabody (Boston)|Nathaniel Peabody]], a physician, and Elizabeth ("Eliza") Palmer (1778-1853), and spent her early years in [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]].

==Career==
After 1822, she resided principally in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] where she engaged in teaching.&lt;ref name="appletons"&gt;{{Cite Appletons'|wstitle=Peabody, Elizabeth Palmer|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also became a writer and a prominent figure in the [[Transcendentalism|Transcendental movement]]. During 1834–1835, she worked as assistant teacher to [[Amos Bronson Alcott]] at his experimental [[Temple School, Boston (1830s)|Temple School]] in [[Boston]]. After the school closed, Peabody published ''Record of a School'', outlining the plan of the school and Alcott's philosophy of early childhood education, which had drawn on German models.

===Bookstore===
She later opened a book store, Elizabeth Palmer Peabody's West Street Bookstore, at her home in Boston (ca.1840-1852).&lt;ref&gt;"Foreign books &amp; circulating library, 13 West" Street; cf. Boston Directory. 1848, 1851, 1852&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sampson R. Urbino]] bought Peabody's book stock in the mid-1850s. cf. Publishers Weekly, April 4, 1896&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stern, Madeleine B. "Elizabeth Peabody's Foreign Library (1840)." American Transcendental Quarterly, No. 20 Supplement Pt. 1 (Fall 1973), p. 5-12. (Includes facsimile of Catalogue of the Foreign Library, No. 13 West Street, Boston: S.N. Dickinson, 1840.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://198.112.12.245/CFPL/scollect/scoll.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010817122435/http://198.112.12.245/CFPL/scollect/scoll.html |archivedate=2001-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was there that the "Conversations" were held, organized by [[Margaret Fuller]]. The first of these meetings between women was held on November 6, 1839.&lt;ref name=Slater43&gt;Slater, Abby. ''In Search of Margaret Fuller''. New York: Delacorte Press, 1978: 43. {{ISBN|0-440-03944-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topics for these discussions and debates varied but subjects were as diverse as fine arts, history, mythology, literature, and nature.&lt;ref&gt;Gura, Philip F. ''American Transcendentalism: A History''. New York: Hill and Wang, 2007: 134. {{ISBN|0-8090-3477-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller served as the "nucleus of conversation" and hoped to answer the "great questions" facing women: "What were we born to do? How shall we do it? which so few ever propose to themselves 'till their best years are gone by".&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Megan. ''The Peabody Sisters: Three Women Who Ignited American Romanticism''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2005: 387. {{ISBN|978-0-618-71169-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many figures in the woman's rights movement took part, including [[Sophia Ripley|Sophia Dana Ripley]], Caroline Sturgis,&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Megan.

Boston: Mariner Books, 2005: 386–387. {{ISBN|978-0-618-71169-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maria White Lowell]].&lt;ref name=Slater43/&gt;

The 1840 ''Catalogue of the Foreign Library'' offered several hundred titles in German, French, Spanish, Italian and English languages, including:&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue of the Foreign Library, no.13 West Street. Boston: printed by S.N. Dickinson, 1840&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1852, the bookstore and library located at 13-15 West Street in Boston closed down. Members of the Transcendentalist movement had begun to disperse since the mid-1840s and income from the bookstore had gradually declined. In 2011, the [[Boston Landmarks Commission]] designated the building as a [[Boston Landmark]].

===The Dial===
[[Image:ElizabethPeabody portrait2.png|thumb|Elizabeth Peabody]]
For a time, Peabody was the business manager of ''[[The Dial]]'', the main publication of the Transcendentalists. In 1843, she noted that the journal's income was not covering the cost of printing and that subscriptions totaled just over two hundred. In 1844 the magazine published Peabody's translation of a portion of the [[Lotus Sutra]] from French, which was the first English version of a Buddhist scripture.&lt;ref name=ford&gt;{{cite book| last =Ford| first =James Ishmael| title =Zen Master Who?| publisher =[[Wisdom Publications]]| year =2006| page =60| url =| id = | isbn = 0-86171-509-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lopez Jr.|first1=Donald S.|title=The Life of the Lotus Sutra|journal=Tricycle Maqgazine|date=2016|issue=Winter}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication ceased shortly thereafter in April 1844.&lt;ref&gt;Gura, Philip F. ''American Transcendentalism: A History''. New York: Hill and Wang, 2007: 130. {{ISBN|978-0-8090-3477-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Kindergarden}}Kindergarten===
When Peabody opened her kindergarten in 1860, the practice of providing formal schooling for children younger than six was largely confined to Germany. She had a particular interest in the educational methods of [[Friedrich Fröbel]], particularly after meeting one of his students living in the U.S. 1859 named [[Margarethe Schurz]].  In 1867, she visited Germany for the purpose of studying Fröbel's teachings more  closely.&lt;ref name="eb1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Peabody, Elizabeth Palmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through her own kindergarten, and as editor of the ''Kindergarten Messenger'' (1873–1877), Peabody helped establish kindergarten as an accepted institution in American education. She also wrote numerous books in support of the cause. The extent of her influence is apparent in a statement submitted to [[United States Congress|Congress]] on February 12, 1897, in support of free kindergartens:

::''The advantage to the community in utilizing the age from 4 to 6 in training the hand and eye; in developing the habits of cleanliness, politeness, self-control, urbanity, industry; in training the mind to understand numbers and geometric forms, to invent combinations of figures and shapes, and to represent them with the pencil—these and other valuable lessons… will, I think, ultimately prevail in securing to us the establishment of this beneficent institution in all the city school systems of our country.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Report of the Commissioner of Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZNtEAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA922|year=1898|pages=922–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diverse activities===
With grounding in history and literature and a reading knowledge of ten languages, in 1840 she also opened a bookstore which held Margaret Fuller's "Conversations" and published books from [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] and others in addition to the periodicals ''The Dial'' and ''Æsthetic Papers''.  She was an advocate of [[abolitionism|antislavery]] and of [[Transcendentalism]]. Moreover, she also led decades of efforts for the rights of the [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] Indians.

==Personal life==
[[Image:ElizabethPalmerPeabodyGrave.jpg|thumb|Grave of Elizabeth Palmer Peabody]]
Her sisters were painter [[Sophia Peabody Hawthorne]]  (wife of writer [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]) and writer [[Mary Tyler Peabody Mann]] (wife of educator [[Horace Mann]]). Peabody died January 3, 1894, aged 89. She is buried at [[Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, Concord|Sleepy Hollow Cemetery]] in [[Concord, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/may16.html Library of Congress ''Today in History: May 16'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Sigler'''; first name also '''Eugenio''', '''Eugène''' or '''Eugene''', last name also '''Siegler''' or '''Siegler Watchel''';&lt;ref name="epheman"&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://epheman.perso.neuf.fr/mars22.html#relgis ''22 mars. Eugen Relgis''] [http://epheman.perso.neuf.fr/ Ephéméride Anarchiste] entry; retrieved 10 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; (22 March 1895 – 24 May 1987) was a Romanian writer, [[Pacifism|pacifist]] philosopher and [[Anarchism|anarchist]] militant, known as a theorist of [[humanitarianism]]. His [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] dogma, with distinct echoes from [[Judaism]] and [[Jewish ethics]], was first shaped during [[World War I]], when Relgis was a [[conscientious objector]]. Infused with [[anarcho-pacifism]] and [[socialism]], it provided Relgis with an international profile, and earned him the support of pacifists such as [[Romain Rolland]], [[Stefan Zweig]] and [[Albert Einstein]]. Another, more controversial, aspect of Relgis' philosophy was his support for [[eugenics]], which centered on the [[compulsory sterilization]] of "[[Degeneration|degenerates]]". The latter proposal was voiced by several of Relgis' essays and [[Sociology|sociological]] tracts.

After an early debut with [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romania's Symbolist movement]], Relgis promoted [[modernist literature]] and the poetry of [[Tudor Arghezi]], signing his name to a succession of literary and political magazines. His work in fiction and poetry alternates the extremes of [[Expressionism]] and [[Didacticism|didactic art]], giving artistic representation to his activism, his pacifist vision, or his struggle with a [[hearing impairment]]. He was a member of several modernist circles, formed around Romanian magazines such as ''[[Sburătorul]]'', ''[[Contimporanul]]'' or ''[[Șantier]]'', but also close to the more mainstream journal ''[[Viața Românească]]''. His political and literary choices made Relgis an enemy of both [[fascism]] and [[communism]]: persecuted during [[World War II]], he eventually took refuge in [[Uruguay]]. From 1947 to the moment of his death, Relgis earned the respect of [[South America]]n circles as an anarchist commentator and proponent of solutions to [[world peace]], as well as a promoter of [[Latin American culture]].

===Early life and literary debut===
The future Eugen Relgis was a native of [[Moldavia]] region, belonging to the [[History of the Jews in Romania|local Jewish community]]. His father, David Sigler, professed Judaism,&lt;ref name="bmiudaistul"&gt;{{ro icon}} Boris Marian, [http://www.romanianjewish.org/db/pdf/nr227/pagina13.pdf "Iudaistul Eugen Relgis"], in ''[[Realitatea Evreiască]]'', Nr. 227 (1027), March–April 2005, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; and descended from [[Tanning (leather)|tanners]] settled in [[Neamț County]].&lt;ref name="ddgsIII-IV"&gt;Dorian &amp; Șerban, p.III-IV&lt;/ref&gt; Eisig had two sisters, Adelina Derevici and Eugenia Soru, both of whom had careers in [[biochemistry]].&lt;ref name="ddgsIV"&gt;Dorian &amp; Șerban, p.IV&lt;/ref&gt; Born in either [[Iași]] city&lt;ref name="epheman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bmiudaistul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="filosofiaer"&gt;{{es icon}} ''[http://www.filosofia.org/ave/001/a046.htm Eugenio Relgis. 1895-1987]'', [http://www.filosofia.org/ Proyecto filosofía en español] entry; retrieved March 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="militantsrelg"&gt;{{fr icon}}, [http://militants-anarchistes.info/spip.php?article5046&amp;lang=fr "Relgis, Eugen"], ''[http://militants-anarchistes.info/?lang=fr Dictionaire international des militants anarchistes]'' entry; retrieved March 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eriisg"&gt;[http://www.iisg.nl/archives/nl/files/r/10767491.php#scopecontent "Note on the Eugen Relgis Papers"], at the [[International Institute of Social History]]; retrieved March 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="acpensador"&gt;{{es icon}} Agustín Courtoisie, [http://www.ort.edu.uy/facs/boletininternacionales/contenidos/74/courtoisie74.html "Notas de Análisis.

L. Zissu]]. It was in Zissu's circle that Relgis probably first met his mentor, the Romanian modernist author Tudor Arghezi; at the time, Arghezi was married to Constanța Zissu, mother of his photographer son [[Eli Lotar]].&lt;ref name="pc56"&gt;Cernat, p.56&lt;/ref&gt; The young writer later noted that he and Zissu were both touched by the wild landscape of the [[Ceahlău Massif]] and Piatra's ''[[shtetl]]'' atmosphere.&lt;ref name="ddgsIII-IV"/&gt; In another one of his texts, Relgis recalled having been influenced in childhood by selective readings from the Romanian Jewish scholar [[Moses Schwarzfeld]] and his ''Anuarul pentru Israeliți'' journal (he told that, during later years, he had collected the entire ''Anuarul'' collection).&lt;ref name="ddgsV"&gt;Dorian &amp; Șerban, p.V&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking his first steps in literary life, Eisig Sigler adopted his new name through forms of wordplay which enjoyed some popularity among pseudonymous Jewish writers (the case of [[Paul Celan]], born ''Ancel'').&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Arnold Helman, [http://www.romanianjewish.org/ro/realitatea_evreiasca_03_01.html ''Contribuția scriitorilor evrei la literatura română. Ilarie Voronca și Paul Celan - două destine tragice''], at the [http://www.romanianjewish.org/ro/mosteniri_ale_culturii_iudaice_03_11_06.html Romanian Jewish Community site]; retrieved March 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He was from early on a promoter of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] and modernist literature, a cause into which he blended his [[left-wing]] perspective and calls for [[Jewish emancipation]]. Writing in 2007, literary historian [[Paul Cernat]] suggested that Relgis, like fellow humanitarianist and Jewish intellectual [[Isac Ludo]], had a "not at all negligible" part to play in the early diffusion of Romanian modernism.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.34&lt;/ref&gt; Relgis' main contribution in the 1910s was the Symbolist tribune ''Fronda'' ("The Fronde"), the three consecutive issues of which he edited, in Iași, between April and June 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.55-57&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Ludo's review ''Absolutio'' (which saw print two years later), ''Fronda'' stood for the radical branch of the [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romanian Symbolist movement]] in Iași, in contrast to both the left-leaning but traditionalist magazine ''[[Viața Românească]]'' and the more conventional Symbolism of ''[[Versuri și Proză]]'' journal.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.55-56&lt;/ref&gt; Its editorial board, Relgis included, went anonymous, but their names were known to other periodicals of the day and to later researchers. According to Cernat, Relgis was "the most significant ''Frondiste''", seconded by two future figures in Romanian Jewish journalism: Albert Schreiber and Carol Steinberg.&lt;ref name="pc56"/&gt; Like Ludo and poet [[Benjamin Fondane]], the ''Fronda'' group represented those Romanian Jewish aficionados in Iași who followed the Symbolist-modernist school of Arghezi, and who promoted Arghezi's poetry in northern Romania: ''Fronda''{{'}}s writers were noted for saluting ''Viața Românească'' when it too began hosting poems by Arghezi.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.56, 57&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fronda'' put out three issues in all, after which time Relgis became an occasional contributor to more circulated periodicals, among them ''[[Rampa (Romanian magazine)|Rampa]]'' (founded by Arghezi and the socialist agitator [[N. D. Cocea]]) and ''[[Vieața Nouă]]'' (led by Symbolist critic [[Ovid Densusianu]]).&lt;ref name="pc56"/&gt; In 1913, he collected his loose philosophical essays, or "fantasies", in the volume ''Triumful neființei'' ("The Triumph of Non-Being").&lt;ref name="bmiudaistul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rjpietreni"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.romanianjewish.org/ro/mosteniri_ale_culturii_iudaice_03_11_08.html ''Carte de neuitare a evreilor pietreni''], at the [http://www.romanianjewish.org/ro/mosteniri_ale_culturii_iudaice_03_11_06.html Romanian Jewish Community site]; retrieved March 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu, p.100; Rose, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; He published his first two books of poems during [[World War I]], but before the end of [[Romania during World War I|Romania's neutrality period]]. The first one was a collection of [[sonnet]]s, ''Sonetele nebuniei'' ("Sonnets of Madness"), printed at Iași in 1914; the second was published in the capital, [[Bucharest]], as ''Nebunia'' ("Madness").&lt;ref name="gc1029"&gt;Călinescu, p.1029&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these poems were illustrated with drawings in Relgis' own hand.&lt;ref name="bmiudaistul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rjpietreni"/&gt;

===From ''Umanitatea'' to ''Mântuirea''===
After training in architecture, Relgis was enrolled at the [[University of Bucharest]], where he took courses in Philosophy.&lt;ref name="epheman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bmiudaistul"/&gt; During the period, he first left Romania on a trip to the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Kingdom of Greece]].&lt;ref name="militantsrelg"/&gt; He interrupted his studies shortly after [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|Romania entered the war]], in the second half of 1916.&lt;ref name="epheman"/&gt; Back in Iași after the [[Central Powers]] stormed into southern Romania, he was reportedly drafted into the [[Romanian Land Forces]], but refused to take up arms as a [[conscientious objector]]; briefly imprisoned as a result, he was in the end discharged for his deafness.&lt;ref name="militantsrelg"/&gt;

Resuming his publishing activity upon the end of war, Eugen Relgis began publicizing his humanitarianist and pacifist agenda. In summer 1918, Relgis became one of the contributors to the Iași-based review ''Umanitatea'' ("The Humanity" or "The Human Race"). Historian [[Lucian Boia]], who notes that ''Umanitatea'' was published when Romania's [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1918|temporary defeat]] seemed to announce sweeping political reforms, believes that the magazine mainly reflected the "nebulous" agenda of a senior editor, the [[Bessarabia]]n journalist [[Alexis Nour]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.259-260&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Relgis and Nour, ''Umanitatea'' enlisted contributions from Ludo and [[Avram Steuerman-Rodion]].&lt;ref name="lb260"&gt;Boia, p.260&lt;/ref&gt; The short-lived magazine, Boia writes, supported [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]], [[labor rights]] and, unusually in the context of "pronounced Romanian [[antisemitism]]", Jewish emancipation.&lt;ref name="lb260"/&gt; On his own, Relgis published a magazine of the same title, issued during 1920.&lt;ref name="epheman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rjpietreni"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ddgsII"&gt;Dorian &amp; Șerban, p.II&lt;/ref&gt; According to one account, ''Umanitatea'' was closed down by Romania's military censorship, which kept a check on radical publications.&lt;ref name="epheman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="militantsrelg"/&gt; In 1921, an unsigned chronicle in the [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]]-based ''[[Gândirea]]'' journal recognized in Relgis "the kind and enthusiastic young man who was propagating [...] the religion of man through ''Umanitatea'' magazine".&lt;ref name="c&amp;rgandirea"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/gandirea/1921-1922/BCUCLUJ_FP_279479_1921_1922_001_003.pdf "Cărți și reviste.

Relgis resumed his literary activity early in the [[interwar period]]. He authored his ideological essay ''Literatura războiului și era nouă'' (Bucharest, 1919); another such piece, ''Umanitarism sau Internaționala intelectualilor'' ("Humanitarianism or the Intellectuals' Internationale"), taken up by ''Viața Românească'' in 1922.&lt;ref name="rjpietreni"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc1029"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dllafjvl"&gt;Dora Litani-Littman, Abraham Feller, [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0017_0_16634.html "Relgis (Sigler), Eugen"], ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'' entry (republished by the [[Jewish Virtual Library]]); retrieved March 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; ''Viața Românească'' also published Relgis' abridged translation of ''The Biology of War'', a pacifist treatise by German physician [[Georg Friedrich Nicolai]].&lt;ref name="c&amp;rgandirea"/&gt; 1922 witnessed the birth of Relgis' manifesto ''Principiile umanitariste'' ("Humanitarianist Principles"), which offered Relgis' own conclusions on [[world peace]], while reaffirming the need to create an international pacifist forum of intellectuals.&lt;ref name="filosofiaer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gslvprolog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rjpietreni"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dllafjvl"/&gt; It carried a preface by Nicolai.&lt;ref name="filosofiaer"/&gt;

Relgis also set up the First Humanitarianist Group of Romania,&lt;ref name="epheman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="filosofiaer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="militantsrelg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rjpietreni"/&gt; as well as a leftist library, ''Biblioteca Cercului Libertatea'' ("Freedom Circle Library").&lt;ref name="epheman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ddgsII"/&gt; Joined in such efforts by the veteran anarchists [[Han Ryner]] and [[Panait Mușoiu]],&lt;ref name="epheman"/&gt; Relgis also circulated an ''Apel către toți intelectualii liberi și muncitorii luminați'' ("Appeal to All the Free Intellectuals and the Enlightened Workers").&lt;ref name="rjpietreni"/&gt; Before 1932, the Humanitarianist Group created some 23 regional branches in [[Greater Romania]].&lt;ref name="militantsrelg"/&gt; Beginning 1925, Relgis also represented Romanian pacifists within the [[War Resisters' International]].&lt;ref name="epheman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="filosofiaer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="militantsrelg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eriisg"/&gt;

In the meantime, he continued to publish sporadic poems, such as ''Ascetism'' ("Asceticism"), featured in ''Gândirea''.&lt;ref name="c&amp;rgandirea 189"&gt;{{ro icon}} Eugen Relgis, [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/gandirea/1921-1922/BCUCLUJ_FP_279479_1921_1922_001_010.pdf "Ascetism"], in ''[[Gândirea]]'', Nr. 10/1921, p.189 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; The year 1923 witnessed the beginnings of a friendship between Relgis and the aspiring pacifist author [[George Mihail Zamfirescu]]. Relgis prefaced Zamfirescu's book ''Flamura albă'' ("The White Flag"), and contributed to Zamfirescu's magazine ''Icoane Maramureșene'' ("[[Maramureș]] Icons").&lt;ref name="mpzamfirescu"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mircea Popa, [http://www.uab.ro/reviste_recunoscute/index.php?cale=2006 "George Mihail Zamfirescu"], in the [[1 Decembrie 1918 University, Alba Iulia|December 1 University of Alba Iulia]] [http://www.uab.ro/reviste_recunoscute/index.php?cale=philologica ''Philologica Yearbook''], 2006, I, p.30&lt;/ref&gt; A prose volume, ''Peregrinări'' ("Wanderings"), saw print with [[Editura Socec]] the same year.&lt;ref name="gc1029"/&gt; Relgis also published, in 1924, the 3 volumes of his main novel ''Petru Arbore'' (a ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' named after its main protagonist).&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.1029; Lovinescu, p.237-238; Rose, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; Two new volumes of his topical essays saw print in later years: the first one, published by the printing offices of fellow journalist [[Barbu Brănișteanu]], was ''Umanitarism și socialism'' ("Humanitarianism and Socialism", 1925); the second, printed in 1926, was titled ''Umanitarismul biblic'' ("Humanitarianism in the [[Bible]]").&lt;ref name="bmiudaistul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dllafjvl"/&gt; His press activity included contributions to Zionist papers: a writer for ''[[Știri din Lumea Evreiască]]'', he was also briefly on the staff of Zissu's ''[[Mântuirea]]''.&lt;ref name="dllafjvl"/&gt;

===''Sburătorul'' and ''Umanitarismul''===
Also during the early 1920s, Eugen Relgis came into contact with the Bucharest-based ''[[Sburătorul]]'' circle, which stood for modernist literature and [[aesthetic relativism]]. The eponymous magazine published samples of his [[lyrical poetry]].&lt;ref name="ddgsII"/&gt; With his humanitarian literature, Relgis was a singular figure among the many ''Sburătorul'' factions, as later noted by literary historian [[Ovid Crohmălniceanu]] in discussing the studied eclecticism of ''Sburătorul'' doyen [[Eugen Lovinescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; Another Romanian researcher, [[Henri Zalis]], notes that Relgis was one of the many Jewish intellectuals whom Lovinescu cultivated in reaction to the tradition of [[Ethnic nationalism|ethno-nationalist]] discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Henri Zalis]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/ZALISaug4.html "Apropieri de o moștenire diferențiată"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', August 2004&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to critic [[Eugen Simion]], Lovinescu also greatly exaggerated Relgis' literary worth.&lt;ref&gt;Simion, in Lovinescu, p.328&lt;/ref&gt;

Relgis' contribution to [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]] was renewed in 1926, when he published ''Melodiile tăcerii'' ("Melodies of Silence") and the collection ''Poezii'' ("Poems"), followed in 1927 by ''Glasuri în surdină'' ("Muted Voices").&lt;ref name="gc1029"/&gt; The latter novel, later republished with a foreword by Austrian author [[Stefan Zweig]],&lt;ref name="militantsrelg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wr12"&gt;Rose, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mancsiusa"&gt;{{it icon}} ''[http://siusa.archivi.beniculturali.it/cgi-bin/pagina.pl?TipoPag=prodpersona&amp;Chiave=151&amp;RicFrmRicSemplice=relgis&amp;RicProgetto=personalita&amp;RicSez=produttori&amp;RicVM=ricercasemplice&amp;RicLin=en Archivi di personalità.

At that stage in his career, Eugen Relgis was also a contributor to the Bucharest left-wing dailies ''[[Adevărul]]'' and ''[[Dimineața]]'', part of a new generation of radical or pacifist authors cultivated by the newspaper (alongside Zamfirescu, [[Ion Marin Sadoveanu]] and various others).&lt;ref name="mpzamfirescu"/&gt; His pieces for ''Adevărul'' include insights into [[medical sociology]], such as the September 1922 ''Înapoi, la biologie!''

===Travels abroad and ''Șantier'' affiliation===
The Romanian writer traveled extensively to promote his ideas of social change. By 1928, he was in regular correspondence with French writer and [[human rights]] activist [[Romain Rolland]], who answered in writing to Relgis' various inquiries.&lt;ref&gt;Duchatelet, p.41&lt;/ref&gt; He was a delegate to pacifist reunions in [[Hoddesdon]], England and [[Sonntagberg]], Austria (1928).&lt;ref name="epheman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="filosofiaer"/&gt; Relgis also exchanged letters with various other prestigious left-wing intellectuals: Zweig, [[Upton Sinclair]], [[Henri Barbusse]], [[Max Nettlau]] etc.&lt;ref name="militantsrelg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ddgsII"/&gt; His various inquiries also enlisted positive replies from other international supporters of pacifism: physicist [[Albert Einstein]], biologist [[Auguste Forel]], writer [[Heinrich Mann]] and anarchist militant [[Paul Reclus]].&lt;ref name="ddgsII"/&gt; He became a contributor to [[Sebastien Faure]]'s ''[[Anarchist Encyclopedia]]'', with the "Humanitarianism" entry.&lt;ref name="militantsrelg"/&gt; In 1929, Delpeuch company published his [[French-language]] essay ''L'Internationale pacifiste'' ("The Pacifist International"),&lt;ref&gt;Duchatelet, p.33, 41&lt;/ref&gt; reissued the same year in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], Spain, as ''La Internacional Pacifista''.&lt;ref name="filosofiaer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="acpensador"/&gt;

Around 1930, Relgis was in [[Paris]], where he met with Han Ryner,&lt;ref name="epheman"/&gt; and in [[Berlin]], where he conversed with his mentor Nicolai.&lt;ref name="wr13"&gt;Rose, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; In its new translated editions, ''Apel către...'' was signed by a number of leading pacifist intellectuals of various persuasions, among them Zweig, Sinclair, Barbusse, [[Campio Carpio]], [[Manuel Devaldès]], [[Philéas Lebesgue]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]].&lt;ref name="filosofiaer"/&gt; While in France, where his work was notably popularized by ''[[L'EnDehors]]'' magazine and [[Gérard de Lacaze-Duthiers]]'s ''Bibliothèque de l'Artistocratie'' book collection,&lt;ref name="epheman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="militantsrelg"/&gt; he was for a while close to Barbusse's ''Clarté'' circle, but left it after discovering its [[Communism|communist]] militancy and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] connections.&lt;ref name="ddgsII"/&gt; His Intellectuals' Internationale therefore took distance from both the [[Comintern]] and the [[International Working Union of Socialist Parties]].&lt;ref name="filosofiaer"/&gt;

In 1932, he published the [[German-language]] collection of interviews ''Wege zum Friede'' ("Path toward Peace").&lt;ref name="eriisg"/&gt; His other travels into [[Bulgaria]], where he represented Romanian [[Vegetarianism|vegetarians]] at an international congress, were discussed in his 1933 volume ''Bulgaria necunoscută'' ("Unknown Bulgaria").&lt;ref name="militantsrelg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clopoțel (1933), ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; The volume ''Cosmometápolis'', about the creation of a [[world government]],&lt;ref name="jpb638"&gt;Joseph Preston Baratta, ''The Politics of World Federation: From World Federation to Global Governance'', [[Greenwood Publishing Group]], Vol. 2, Westport, 2004, p.638.  {{ISBN|0-275-98068-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; was first published in Bucharest by Cultura Poporului imprint, and reissued in Paris by Mignolet et Storz.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} ''[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5774661m/f50.image.r Biblio 1935.

Relgis' participation in left-wing causes was attacked at home by the antisemitic and proto-[[Fascism|fascist]] [[National Christian Defense League]], whose press organ ''Înfrățirea Românească'' alleged that "squire Siegler" and his ''Umanitarismul'', together with the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]], were fostering communist agitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ion V.

By that moment in his career, Relgis became a contributor to ''[[Vremea]]'' newspaper and to [[Ion Pas]]' political and art magazine, ''[[Șantier]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/bitstream/123456789/9451/1/BCUCLUJ_FP_279802_1933_010_010_011.pdf "Bibliografie"], in ''[[Societatea de Mâine]]'', Nr. 10-11/1933, p.182 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; The latter periodical was close to the [[Romanian Social Democratic Party (1927-1948)|Romanian Social Democratic Party]], and had a strongly [[anti-fascist]] agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.159-161&lt;/ref&gt; It published, in 1932, the Relgis essay ''Europa cea tânără'' ("Young Europe"), which talked about civilization, [[imperialism]] and war.&lt;ref name="ddgsVII"&gt;Dorian &amp; Șerban, p.VII&lt;/ref&gt; Relgis' contributions to ''Șantier'' also include a January 12, 1934 essay about "[[anonymous work]]s" and their impact on art history, which was later quoted in ''Viața Românească''.&lt;ref name="vr2,1934"&gt;"Revista revistelor", in ''[[Viața Românească]]'', Nr. 1/1934, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Relgis published the novel ''Prieteniile lui Miron'' ("Miron's Friendships") with [[Editura Cugetarea]].&lt;ref name="gc1029"/&gt;&lt;ref name="icmiron"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Clopoțel]], [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/societateademaine/pdf/BCUCLUJ_FP_279802_1934_011_007_010.pdf "Discuții și recensii.

In his subsequent activity as a journalist and publisher, Relgis combined his humanitarianism with topical interests. He was by then an advocate of [[eugenics]], an interest reflected in his 1934 (or 1935) tract ''Umanitarism și eugenism'' ("Humanitarianism and Eugenism"), published by Editura Vegetarianismul company.&lt;ref&gt;Bucur, p.187, 282; Turda, p.93&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, he also released the collection ''Esseuri despre iudaism'' ("Essays on [[Judaism]]") with Cultura Poporului.&lt;ref name="bmiudaistul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gslvprolog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dllafjvl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ddgsII, V"&gt;Dorian &amp; Șerban, p.II, V&lt;/ref&gt; He was at the time active within the Jewish Cultural Institute, an annex of the [[Templul Coral|Bucharest Choral Temple]].&lt;ref name="dllafjvl"/&gt; His international activity peaked during the [[Spanish Civil War]], when he helped organize anarchist support for the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republican regime]], elected Councilor of the [[International Antifascist Solidarity]].&lt;ref name="militantsrelg"/&gt;

===World War II, persecution and departure===
Eugen Relgis was still active on the literary scene during the first two years of [[World War II]], before Romania formalized its military alliance with the [[Axis Powers]]. The [[Phoney War]] caught him in France, but he returned to Romania shortly after, exposing himself to persecution by the growing Romanian fascist movements.&lt;ref name="militantsrelg"/&gt; In February 1940, he gave a retrospective lecture, republished by the newspaper ''[[L'Indépendence Roumaine]]'', on the work of Austrian [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Sigmund Freud]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.freud.org.uk/archive/catalogue/press-cuttings/title2/DESC/2/ Archive Catalogues. Press Cuttings]'', [[Freud Museum]] archive; retrieved March 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Another book of his political prose, ''Spiritul activ'' ("The Active Spirit"), saw print the same year.&lt;ref name="gc1029"/&gt;

The emergence of antisemitic and fascist regimes (''see [[Romania in World War II]], [[Holocaust in Romania]]'') signified the beginning of Relgis' marginalization. During the short-lived [[National Legionary State]], established by the [[Iron Guard]] fascists between 1940 and early 1941, the author lived in seclusion.&lt;ref name="militantsrelg"/&gt; His ''Biblioteca Cercului Libertatea'' was banned in 1940, but Relgis secretly moved the books into a stable.&lt;ref name="ddgsII"/&gt; After the Guard fell from power, the [[Ion Antonescu]] dictatorship still included Relgis on a nationally circulated list of banned Romanian Jewish authors,&lt;ref&gt;Rotman, p.174-175&lt;/ref&gt; but Relgis continued to write. His texts of the time include a posthumous praise of his pacifist disciple Iosif Gutman, the son of a Bucharest [[rabbi]], who had been killed during the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|Bucharest pogrom]].&lt;ref name="gslvprolog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ddgsII"/&gt; The essay was planned as part of Rabbi Gutman's volume ''Slove de martiri'' ("Notes by Martyrs"), which, although anti-Guard, was not given Antonescu's imprimatur.&lt;ref name="ddgsII"/&gt; Relgis was however able to publish an article in the Jewish-only magazine ''Renașterea Noastră'', on the occasion of Iosif's ''[[Bereavement in Judaism|yahrtzeit]]'', where he compared the Gutmans to [[Laocoön and His Sons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.romanianjewish.org/db/pdf/nr310_311/pagina04.pdf "21-23 ianuarie 1941.

A final period in Relgis' Romanian activity came after the [[King Michael's Coup|August 1944 Coup]] toppled Antonescu and denounced Romania's Axis alliance. In 1945, he was dedicated a public celebration at the Jewish Cultural Institute, which included a speech by [[Chief Rabbi]] [[Alexandru Șafran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.romanianjewish.org/ro/mosteniri_ale_culturii_iudaice_03_11_19.html ''Institutul Cultural al Templului Coral.

With [[refugee]] status,&lt;ref name="wr12"/&gt; having reportedly been singled out for arrest by the [[Romanian Communist Party]] officials,&lt;ref name="militantsrelg"/&gt; Relgis departed from Romania in 1947, shortly before the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] took hold. After a brief stay in Paris,&lt;ref name="militantsrelg"/&gt; he spent some time in Argentina, with his son and his female companion Ana Taubes.&lt;ref name="epheman"/&gt; He later went to [[Montevideo]], in [[Uruguay]], where he lived the remainder of his life.&lt;ref name="epheman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="filosofiaer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gslvprolog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dllafjvl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wr12"/&gt; At home, his works were included in an official ''Publicații interzise'' ("Works Forbidden from Publishing") list, published by the [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censorship apparatus]].&lt;ref name="ascumsedistruge"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Al.

During his last decades, Eugen Relgis dedicated himself to sociological research and political activism. He embarked on a series of university lectures, which carried him throughout Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil.&lt;ref name="epheman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dllafjvl"/&gt; In 1950, he founded an international anarchist archive in Montevideo, reportedly one of the few political libraries in [[South America]] at the time of its creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} Roberto Ceamanos Llorens, [http://www.um.edu.uy/_upload/_descarga/web_descarga_218_CEAMANOS_Los_estudios_en_el_extranjero_como_experiencia_formativa_la_experiencia_de_Carlos_Rama.pdf "Los estudios en el extranjero como período formativo.

===South American career===
With noted help from anarchist translator Vladimiro Muñoz,&lt;ref name="epheman"/&gt; Relgis began his new career as a [[Spanish language|Spanish-language]] writer and publicist with a succession of works. ''Umanitarism și eugenism'' was translated into a Spanish edition: ''Humanitarismo y eugenismo'', Ediciones Universo, [[Toulouse]], 1950.&lt;ref name="filosofiaer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="acpensador"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aerlgitana"&gt;{{es icon}} Ana Esmeralda Rizo López, [http://redalyc.uaemex.mx/pdf/439/43960105.pdf "Apuntes sobre la comunidad gitana española: breves trazos de su historia en conexión con el contexto europeo"], in the [[University of Costa Rica]] ''Diálogos. Revista Electrónica de Historia'', Nr. 1/2005, p.226 ([[Redalyc]] version)&lt;/ref&gt; The same imprint released his essay ''Las aberraciones sexuales en la Alemania nazi'' ("Sexual Aberrations in Nazi Germany"), which discussed in some depth the characteristics of [[Nazi eugenics]].&lt;ref name="filosofiaer"/&gt; Also in 1950, with his Montevideo printing office Ediciones Humanidad, Relgis released a Spanish edition of his ''Principiile'', a version of [[Max Nettlau]]'s ''World Peace'' volume,&lt;ref name="militantsrelg"/&gt; as well as reissuing ''Cosmometápolis''.&lt;ref name="jpb638"/&gt; Two years later, Ediciones Humanidad published Relgis' biographical essay ''Stefan Zweig, cazador de almas'' ("Stefan Zweig, the Soul Hunter"), followed in 1953 by a [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]] version of ''De mis peregrinaciones europeas'' ("From My Wanderings in Europe").&lt;ref name="filosofiaer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="acpensador"/&gt; Relgis also tried to get his contributions translated into [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], asking anarchist philosopher [[José Oiticica]] for assistance.&lt;ref name="epheman"/&gt; He was at the time employed by ''El Plata'' daily, editing its Wednesday literary page, and helping to discover, in 1954, the twelve-year-old poet [[Teresa Porzecanski]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Teresa Porzecanski]], "''Uruguay''.

In 1954, Relgis printed another biographical study, on Romain Rolland: ''El hombre libre frente a la barbarie totalitaria'' ("A Free Man Confronts [[Totalitarianism|Totalitarian]] Barbarity").&lt;ref name="filosofiaer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="acpensador"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duchatelet, p.23, 41&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he gave a public lecture at the [[University of the Republic, Uruguay|University of the Republic]], titled "A Writer's Confession", and reissued ''Esseuri despre iudaism'' as ''Profetas y poetas. Valores permanentes y temporarios del judaísmo'' ("Prophets and Poets.

In 1958, the University of the Republic published Eugen Relgis' acclaimed political essay ''Perspectivas culturales en Sudamérica'' ("Cultural Perspectives in South America"), for which he received a prize from the [[List of Ministers of Education and Culture (Uruguay)|Uruguayan Ministry of Public Instruction and Social Prevision]].&lt;ref name="wr12"/&gt; Relgis' reputation was consolidated in the intellectual circles and, in 1955, his name was unsuccessfully advanced for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref name="epheman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="filosofiaer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="acpensador"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rjpietreni"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Sanda-Valeria Moraru, [http://studia.ubbcluj.ro/download/pdf/566.pdf "Recenzii.

Relgis returned to poetry in 1960 and 1961, with the volumes ''En un lugar de los Andes'' ("Some Place in the [[Andes]]") and ''Locura'' ("Madness"), both translated by Pablo R. Troise.&lt;ref name="filosofiaer"/&gt; They were followed by two other booklets, also in Troise's translation: ''Corazones y motores'' ("Hearts and Engines", 1963), ''Últimos poemas'' ("The Last Poems", 1967).&lt;ref name="filosofiaer"/&gt; His complete ''Obras'' ("Works") were published over the next decades,&lt;ref name="ddgsIV"/&gt; while the essay ''¿Qué es el humanitarismo? Principios y acción'' ("What Is Humanitarianism? Principles and Action") went through several successive editions&lt;ref name="acpensador"/&gt; and featured a prologue by [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref name="aclxxvii"/&gt; Another one of Relgis' Spanish-language volumes, ''Testigo de mi tiempo'' ("A Witness of My Time"), with more essays on Judaism, came in 1961.&lt;ref name="dllafjvl"/&gt; His leading eugenics and [[sexology]] treatise, ''Historia sexual de la Humanidad'' ("The Sexual History of Humanity"), was also published in 1961 (Libro-Mex Editores, [[Mexico City]]),&lt;ref&gt;Masjuan, p.407, 422, 424, 493&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1965, his biography of Nicolai saw print in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;Cappelletti, p.LXI&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final years and death===
In 1962, Eugen Relgis visited Israel and [[Jerusalem]], tightening his links with the Romanian Israeli community, including the Menora Association and Rabbi David Șafran.&lt;ref&gt;Dorian &amp; Șerban, p.II, VIII&lt;/ref&gt; It was in Israel that Relgis published another volume of memoirs, in his native [[Romanian language]]: ''Mărturii de ieri și de azi'' ("Testimonies of Yesterday and Today").&lt;ref name="dllafjvl"/&gt; In 1972, he was made an honorary staff member of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name="rjpietreni"/&gt;

From the early 1960s, Relgis was in correspondence with figures in the Italian radical circles, such as the anarchist [[Gaspare Mancuso]].&lt;ref name="filosofiaer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eriisg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mancsiusa"/&gt; In 1964, Mancuso and Regis' other Italian disciples founded the political journal ''Quaderini degli amici di Eugen Relgis'' ("The Friends of Eugen Relgis Notebooks").&lt;ref name="eriisg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mancsiusa"/&gt; He also became an occasional contributor to ''[[Mujeres Libres]]'', the Spanish [[Anarcha-feminism|anarcha-feminist]] tribune in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Luis Monferrer Catalán, ''Odisea en Albión: los republicanos españoles exiliados en Gran Bretaña 1936-1977'', Ediciones de la Torre, Madrid, 2007, p. 459. {{ISBN|978-84-7960-386-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s and '70s, as a spell of [[liberalization]] occurred in [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]'s Romania, Relgis was again in contact with Romanian intellectuals. Before the [[1977 Vrancea earthquake|massive earthquake of 1977]] devastated Bucharest, he was in regular correspondence with scholar Mircea Handoca.&lt;ref name="gslvprolog"/&gt;

Eugen Relgis lived the final decade of his life as a pensioner of the Uruguayan state—in 1985, a law raised his ''pensión graciable'' to 20,000 [[Uruguayan peso|new pesos]] a month.&lt;ref name="filosofiaer"/&gt; In the 1980s, Relgis was exchanging letters with Romanian cultural historian [[Leon Volovici]], and entertained thoughts about a recovery of his work by Romanian critics and historians.&lt;ref name="gslvprolog"/&gt; He died before this could happen, in Montevideo, at age 92.

==Political doctrine==

===Main ideas===
Throughout his career, Relgis was the proponent of [[anarchism]]. The Romanian writer spoke about the negativity of "state [[fetishism]]", seeking to overturn it and create "universal fraternity",&lt;ref name="gc937"&gt;Călinescu, p.937&lt;/ref&gt; and, in ''Diario de otoño'', postulated a necessary distinction between Law ("which may be interpreted for or against") and Justice ("elementary" and unavoidable).&lt;ref name="acpensador"/&gt; Relgis likewise believed that war could be overcome once humanity shall have toppled "the three idols: State, Property, Money."&lt;ref name="acpensador"/&gt; Political philosopher [[Ángel Cappelletti]] argues: "Relgis was not an anarchist militant, but was always close to [[Left-libertarianism|libertarian]] ideas".&lt;ref name="aclxxvii"/&gt;

According to [[Stefan Zweig]], Relgis fought "tirelessly for the great goal of spiritual fraternity."&lt;ref name="wr12"/&gt; The sentiment was echoed by [[Romain Rolland]], who recognized in Relgis his disciple: "There is no other European man in whose hands I could place, with as much confidence, [...] my pacifist and [[Universalism|universalist]] idea, for it to be passed on into the future. For none other has such far-reaching intelligence to this goal, and none other would feel this idea so intimately connected to his being."&lt;ref name="ddgsI"&gt;Dorian &amp; Șerban, p.I&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking from the cultural mainstream, Romanian literary historian [[George Călinescu]] observed Relgis' [[anti-establishment]] and [[anti-art]]istic rhetoric, but described it as mere "[[Idealism|idealist]] reverie", "without any daring proposals that would threaten our [[self-preservation]] instincts".&lt;ref name="gc937"/&gt; Contrarily, scholar William Rose sees Relgis as "an idealist deeply preoccupied by social problems", "a practical and not a [[utopian]] thinker", and a theorist aware that social or economic evolution was needed before his goals could be achieved.&lt;ref name="wr12"/&gt;

Relgis' [[humanitarianism]] (also known as [[humanism]] or pan-humanism; {{lang-es|humanitarismo}})&lt;ref&gt;Rose, p.12. See also Dorian &amp; Șerban, p.VII&lt;/ref&gt; was a practical extension of [[anarcho-pacifism]]. William Rose describes this doctrine as both "universalist and pacifist", noting that one of its leading purposes was to eliminate those things "which separate man from man and cause wars".&lt;ref name="wr12"/&gt; Relgis himself spoke of his movement as a form of "active thought", and "a critical method applied to natural, human and social realities",&lt;ref name="gslvprolog"/&gt; while expressing admiration for the [[nonviolent resistance]] tactics advocated in [[British Raj|British India]] by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] or [[Rabindranath Tagore]].&lt;ref name="filosofiaer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ddgsVII"/&gt; At the time, he attacked all forms of [[pan-nationalism]], from [[Pan-Germanism]] to [[Pan-European nationalism]], defining pan-humanism as "the only 'pan' that can be accepted as a natural law of the human species".&lt;ref name="ddgsVII"/&gt; In ''El humanitarismo'', he called all [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] movements, except his own, corrupted by "the practice of violence and intolerance".&lt;ref name="acpensador"/&gt;

Writing in 1933, the leftist literary columnist [[Ion Clopoțel]] stressed that Relgis' vision combined humanitarianism with "a lively, dynamic and innovating [[socialism]]".&lt;ref name="ic(33)169"&gt;Clopoțel (1933), p.169&lt;/ref&gt; Although left-wing, Relgis' vision also incorporated militant [[anti-communism]]. As noted by literary historian [[Geo Șerban]], he was from early on skeptical about the outcome of "[[social revolution]]s" and [[Bolshevik]] insurgency.&lt;ref name="ddgsII"/&gt; In the first issue of ''Umanitarianismul'', Relgis criticized both the [[far right]] and the [[far left]], noting that his ideology was "apolitical, in fact antipolitical".&lt;ref name="ddgsII"/&gt; In ''Europa cea tânără'', he referred to the [[Soviet Union]] as the home of "[[proletarian]] [[imperialism]]".&lt;ref name="ddgsVII"/&gt; These thoughts were detailed by ''Diario de otoño'', which drew a direct comparison between the [[Red Army]], pushing Romania into an "armed peace", and the [[Wehrmacht]].&lt;ref name="acpensador"/&gt;

===Judaism, Zionism, Jewish culture===
Beginning in the late 1920s, Relgis was also a supporter of [[Zionism]], convinced that the path of [[Jewish assimilation]] was unsatisfactory for the affirmation of Jewish talents.&lt;ref name="bmiudaistul"/&gt; He also adhered to philosopher [[Martin Buber]]'s ideas about reuniting the three paths chosen by [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]]: universalism, Zionism and [[Conservative Judaism]].&lt;ref name="gslvprolog"/&gt; In his 1929 Avodah conference, he analyzed the ongoing Jewish resettlement into the [[Land of Israel]], and investigated the causes of violent clashes between Jewish migrants and the [[Palestinian people|Palestine Arabs]].&lt;ref name="bmiudaistul"/&gt; In other public statements, Relgis proudly stated his Judaic faith, noting that he had never actually left Judaism, "being integrated into its vast reality by the very reality of my own preoccupations, sociological and ethical, humanitarianist and pacifist."&lt;ref name="gslvprolog"/&gt; However, he explained to Iosif Gutman that joining a Zionist organization was not worth the effort, since membership was a form of captivity, and elsewhere suggested that Zionism was justified only as long as it did not follow "the restrictive methods of vulgar nationalism."&lt;ref name="ddgsII, V"/&gt; The writer also described himself as committed to [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]], and, as late as 1981, noted that [[Romanian language|Romanian]] was still his language of choice.&lt;ref name="gslvprolog"/&gt;

His essays on Judaism (some of which were dedicated to his father David)&lt;ref name="bmiudaistul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ddgsV"/&gt; speak about the threat of [[societal collapse]], which the author connected with mankind's spiritual decline after [[World War I]]. His theory on "[[dehumanization]]" postulated: "the spiritual evolution of mankind has proceeded to descent just as mankind is progressing in material terms."&lt;ref name="bmiudaistul"/&gt; As a reversal of this trend, Relgis proposed a return to the roots of Judaism, in whose [[monotheism]] and [[Messianism]] he decoded the basic representation of [[moral responsibility]], and the immediate precursors of [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name="bmiudaistul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gslvprolog"/&gt; The Romanian writer was interested in those aspects of [[Jewish ethics]] which anticipated humanitarianism or pacifism, citing the [[Bible]] as "that most humane book", and identifying himself with the lament of [[Malachi]] 2:10 ("Why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers?").&lt;ref name="bmiudaistul"/&gt; He later wrote that Jews, and Israelis in particular, were entrusted with keeping alive "the ancient wisdom, poetry and faith", with creating "new values from the old ones".&lt;ref name="gslvprolog"/&gt; Defining in his own terms the relationship between Biblical proto-universalism and 20th century humanitarianism, Relgis wrote: "Judaism is comprised into modern humanitarianism like a flame within a crystal globe."&lt;ref name="ddgsIV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gslvprolog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rjpietreni"/&gt;

In tandem, he rejected those aspects of Judaism or Christianity which he believed where [[bigotry]], and his pacifist discourse criticized all religions as potential instigators or ideological props of hawkish rhetoric.&lt;ref name="bmiudaistul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ddgsII"/&gt; He reserved special criticism for the notions of a "vengeful God" and "[[Jews as a chosen people|Jewish chosenness]]", arguing that they are "primitive", and expressed more sympathy for [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] universalism.&lt;ref name="ddgsII"/&gt; His texts, including the 1922 ''Apel către...'', are thought by some to be purposefully reusing the pro-universalist vocabulary of [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]].&lt;ref name="filosofiaer"/&gt;

Relgis' Judaic-themed tracts cover a wide range of subjects. In several of them, Relgis concentrates on the Biblical prophet [[Moses]], in whom he sees the symbol of "great human aspirations".&lt;ref name="gslvprolog"/&gt; Some texts trace the impact of Moses' teaching on more modern authors (from [[Baruch Spinoza]] to [[Charles Darwin]]), others talk about [[secular Jewish culture]], and still others focus on individual Jewish personalities: Buber, [[Edmond Fleg]], [[Theodor Herzl]].&lt;ref name="bmiudaistul"/&gt; As a critic, he also investigated the survival of ancient Judaic themes in the [[modern art]] of [[Marcel Janco]], [[Lazăr Zin]] or [[Reuven Rubin]], and in the literature of Zweig, [[S. Ansky]], [[Mendele Mocher Sforim]] and even [[Marcel Proust]].&lt;ref name="gslvprolog"/&gt; Other such writings are individual portraits of Romanian Jewish men of letters, from [[A. L. Zissu]] and [[Iosif Brucǎr]] to [[Avram Steuerman-Rodion]] and [[Enric Furtună]].&lt;ref name="gslvprolog"/&gt; According to Geo Șerban, Relgis spent much of his later career promoting "a more fertile awareness of the links between Judaism and the modern world."&lt;ref name="gslvprolog"/&gt;

A critic of [[antisemitism]], Eugen Relgis also dedicated some of his main works in the essay genre to the cause of [[anti-fascism]]. Early on, he exposed claims about [[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory|Judeo-Masonic domination]] as canards, and noted that antisemitism was a negative reaction to the Jews' own status as natural innovators in both politics and culture.&lt;ref name="bmiudaistul"/&gt; He wrote: "I take antisemitism to be that psychological disease whose manifestations display the characteristics of a [[phobia]], that is to say an [[Fixation (psychology)|obsession]]. When someone is obsessed with an image, an individual or even a collective entity, these become the center of their world—and all causes and effects, no matter how far apart and different from each other, are connected to the initial obsession."&lt;ref name="gslvprolog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ddgsV"/&gt;

Writing in 1946, shortly after the scale of [[The Holocaust]] became known to Romanian Jews, Relgis gave credit to the popular, but since challenged rumor that [[Soap made from human corpses|Nazis fabricated human soap]].&lt;ref&gt;Oișteanu, p.69&lt;/ref&gt; Historian of ideas [[Andrei Oișteanu]] analyzes Relgis' text as more of a reaction to Nazism's own obsessive take on cleanliness, and writes that, at that time, Jews and Christians in Romania had been collecting certain brands of German soap and burying them as human remains.&lt;ref&gt;Oișteanu, p.69-70&lt;/ref&gt;

===On Latin America===
After his move to Uruguay, Relgis developed a personal theory on [[Latin America]] as a "neohumanist" continent.&lt;ref&gt;Riose, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, in ''Europa cea tânără'', Relgis had claimed that the European continent needed to revisit its "pathetic history" of violence and imperialism, and reconvert by combining the lessons of [[Eastern philosophy]] and United States models of [[industrialization]].&lt;ref name="ddgsVII"/&gt; Both models, he warned, carried risks: Asia's "spiritual renunciations" were mirrored by a "cancer of machinism" in [[North America]].&lt;ref name="ddgsVII"/&gt;

With ''Perspectivas culturales en Sudamérica'', he expanded on a distinction between civilization and culture: the former as a transitory phase in human development, the latter as a permanent and characteristic sum of ideas; civilization, he argued, was in existence within the New World, but a [[Latin American culture]] was still ahead.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, p.12-13&lt;/ref&gt; Relgis identified this as a merit, describing [[South America]] in general and Uruguay in particular as exceptionally fertile and a "healthier" example for the whole world, offering safe haven to independent thinkers and defying the ideological divisions of the [[Cold War]] era.&lt;ref name="wr13-14"&gt;Rose, p.13-14&lt;/ref&gt; Summarizing the future links between the Latin American regions and Europe as envisaged by Relgis, William Rose wrote: "the cultural mission of America consists in a careful selection of the eternal and universal values of Europe and their assimilation [...] to create typically American values that later, transcending the limits of this continent, will carry their message of peace and fraternity to the entire world."&lt;ref name="wr13"/&gt; Latin America, Relgis cautioned, should leave behind its own traditions of dictatorial government, fanaticism and "[[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] mentality", while fighting the "false moral" of North America; it could thus contribute to the cultural renaissance of a Europe corrupted by totalitarianism and imperialism.&lt;ref name="wr13-14"/&gt; Also important in Relgis' assessment was Latin America's capacity to resist modern dehumanization by granting a social role to its intellectuals, an idea impressed upon him by the writings of Uruguayan humanist [[José Enrique Rodó]].&lt;ref&gt;Rose, p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

Relgis' theory was received with interest by some of his South American colleagues. One was [[Argentina|Argentine]] poet and historian [[Arturo Capdevila]], who wrote about Relgis as a "meritorious" visionary with a "grave and vital message", assuring him: "You can say from now on that you did not suffer in vain, gravely and deeply, the sorrows of the spirit. Your voice will be heard; all of your lesson will be applied."&lt;ref name="wr12"/&gt; Those Uruguayan public figures who paid homage to Relgis on his 60th anniversary included [[Socialist Party of Uruguay|Socialist Party]] leader [[Emilio Frugoni]], [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Colorado Party]] politician [[Amílcar Vasconcellos]], Zionist academic [[Joel Gak]] and poet [[Carlos Sabat Ercasty]].&lt;ref name="acpensador"/&gt; While comparing Relgis' pacifist message with the legendary warnings of [[Antigone]], Frugoni's praise was somewhat skeptical, noting that the Romanian's projects, however grand, could find themselves in disagreement with "the constricting reality".&lt;ref name="acpensador"/&gt; Reviewing such appraisals, Uruguayan philosopher Agustín Courtoisie calls Relgis "eccentric and genial", and sees in him a real-life version of characters in [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' [[fantasy literature]].&lt;ref name="acpensador"/&gt;

===Eugenics===
Like other intellectuals of his generation, Eugen Relgis believed that biology served to explain the background of "social and cultural problems that influence the intellectual movement."&lt;ref name="pt162-163"/&gt; Controversially, he merged his anarchist perspective with support for [[eugenics]], advocating universal [[birth control]] and [[compulsory sterilization]] in cases of "[[degeneration]]".&lt;ref name="filosofiaer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aerlgitana"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mt93-94"&gt;Turda, p.93-94&lt;/ref&gt; According to Agustín Courtoisie: "Anarchist pacifism and the once fashionable eugenics seem to be the concepts one can associate with [Relgis]".&lt;ref name="acpensador"/&gt; In favoring this option, Relgis identified himself with those of his anarchist forerunners who were also dedicated [[Neo-Malthusianism|neo-Malthusians]], and especially with [[Manuel Devaldès]]. He praised Devaldès' call for [[vasectomy]] as a regulatory practice, calling the procedure "a true revolution" in population growth.&lt;ref name="mt93-94"/&gt; His works defended other anarchists who recommended the practice, including the tried anarchist eugenists Norbert Bardoseck and [[Pierre Ramus]].&lt;ref&gt;Masjuan, p.406-407&lt;/ref&gt; According to Romanian [[biomedicine]] historian Marius Turda, Relgis was among the social scientists who, in 1930s Romania, "forced [eugenic sterilization] into the realm of public debate".&lt;ref name="mt93"&gt;Turda, p.93&lt;/ref&gt;

Turda also notes that ''Umanitarism și eugenism'' went beyond sterilization advocacy to propose the [[involuntary euthanasia]] of "degenerate" individuals: those with "pathological characteristics or incurable diseases."&lt;ref name="mt93"/&gt; Relgis' call to action in eugenics came with a provision: "It is, however, preferable, from all points of view, that degenerates should not be born, or, even better, not conceived."&lt;ref name="mt93"/&gt; His views on this subject included an economic rationale, since, he argued, the community could not be expected to provide for sexually "prolific", but otherwise "degenerate", individuals.&lt;ref name="filosofiaer"/&gt; To this goal, he supported [[abortion]], both for eugenic and [[pro-choice]] reasons.&lt;ref name="filosofiaer"/&gt; Relgis also argued: "Instead of [[natural selection]], man should practice rational selection."&lt;ref&gt;Bucur, p.187&lt;/ref&gt; With ''Las aberraciones sexuales...'', Relgis condemned [[Nazi eugenics]] as barbaric, but agreed that those identified as "[[Untermensch|sub-humans]]" needed to be reeducated and (if "incurable") sterilized by non-Nazi physicians.&lt;ref name="filosofiaer"/&gt;

In this context, Relgis identified [[multiracial]] society as a positive paradigm. The emergence of an exemplary Latin American culture was conceived by Relgis as running parallel to a [[Race of the Future|future American racial type]]. In this, Relgis saw the "integral man" of his humanitarianism, "healthy and strong", with a mind unbound by "super-refined culture", and without the traumatic experience of "tyrannical ideologies".&lt;ref name="wr13"/&gt; The idea, Rose noted, was somewhat similar to, but "more universal" than, the [[La Raza Cósmica|Cosmic Race theory]] of Mexican academic [[José Vasconcelos]].&lt;ref name="wr13"/&gt;

==Literary contribution==

===Literary style and principles===
Eugen Relgis blended a critique of [[capitalism]], advocacy of internationalism and [[modern art]] interest with all his main contributions to literature. In his essays and "all too cerebral" novels, George Călinescu argues, Eugen Relgis was "obsessed with humanitarianism" and [[self-help]] techniques.&lt;ref name="gc937"/&gt; With his 1934 piece for ''[[Șantier]]'', Relgis divided the experience and nature of art into a primordial, collective, form and a newer, [[Individualism|individualist]] one: in the past, Relgis noted, creativity was consumed into creating vast anonymous works ("the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramid]], the temple, the cathedral"), often demanding "the silent and tenacious effort of successive generations."&lt;ref name="vr2,1934"/&gt; Presently, he thought, the combat against the "imperative of Profit" and "[[Economic materialism|vulgar materialism]]" justified the "ethical and [[Aesthetic relativism|aesthetic individualism]]". Relgis' essay described [[industrial society]] in harsh terms, as directed by "the bloody gods" of "Capitalism and War", and cautioned that the advocacy of anonymity in modern art could lead to [[kitsch]] ("serialized production, without the significance it used to carry in bygone days").&lt;ref name="vr2,1934"/&gt; Elsewhere, however, Relgis also argued that books needed to have a formative value, and that literature, unlike journalism, "needs to be the expression of length and depth."&lt;ref name="ddgsIV"/&gt;

Some of Relgis' preferences were shaped from his time at ''Fronda''. Its [[art manifesto]]s, described by [[Paul Cernat]] as "virtually illegible", announced radical ideals, such as [[art for art's sake]] through [[Great Fire of Rome|Neronian destruction]]: ''[[Qualis artifex pereo]]''.&lt;ref name="pc56"/&gt; [[Leon Baconsky]], a historian of Romanian Symbolism, notes that all ''Frondistes'' were at the time enthusiastic followers of French literary theorist [[Remy de Gourmont]], to whom Cernat adds philosopher [[Henri Bergson]] and [[Epicureanism|Epicurean]] thinker [[Jean-Marie Guyau]] (both of them dedicated "prolix-metaphoric commentary" in the review's pages).&lt;ref name="pc56"/&gt; In matters of [[poetics]], the group declared its deep admiration for the loose Symbolism of [[Tudor Arghezi]] (whose poems were amply reviewed by all three ''Fronda'' issues) and, to a lesser extent, [[Ion Minulescu]]—according to Baconsky, ''Fronda'' was the first-ever voice in literary criticism to comment on Arghezi's work as an integral phenomenon.&lt;ref name="pc56"/&gt;

The cause of pacifism infused Relgis' work as a writer: a contemporary, the literary critic [[Pompiliu Păltânea]], believed that, with his contribution to [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]], Relgis was part of a diverse [[anti-war]] "ideological"  group of writers (alongside [[Felix Aderca]], [[Ioan Alexandru Brătescu-Voinești]], [[Barbu Lăzăreanu]] and some others).&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [[Pompiliu Păltânea]], [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2019162/f237.image.r "Lettres roumaines"], in ''[[Mercure de France]]'', Nr. 576, June 1922, p.803 (digitized by the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ ''Gallica'' digital library])&lt;/ref&gt; According to Călinescu, Relgis' literary ideal became "the living book", the immediate and raw rendition of an individual's experience, with such "idols" as Rolland, Zweig, [[Henri Barbusse]], [[Heinrich Mann]] and [[Ludwig Rubiner]].&lt;ref name="gc937"/&gt; An additional influence was, according to poet-critic Boris Marian, European [[Expressionism]], in fashion at the start of Relgis' career.&lt;ref name="bmiudaistul"/&gt;

In addition to political essays and fiction, Relgis' prose includes contributions to [[travel literature]], deemed "his most characteristic works" by William Rose.&lt;ref name="wr12"/&gt; These writings include attempts by Relgis to illustrate in plastic terms the application of his ideology: [[Ion Clopoțel]] noted that, in his volume about interwar [[Bulgaria]], Relgis went beyond the facade of "savage" Bulgarian [[militarism]] to depict the humanist, vegetarian and "[[Tolstoyan movement|Tolstoyan]]" civil society of that age.&lt;ref&gt;Clopoțel (1933), p.168&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bulgaria necunoscută'' also worked as a manifesto of [[anti-intellectualism]], chastising the "[[Demagogy|demagogue]]" academics and praising the simplicity of "collective life".&lt;ref name="ic(33)169"/&gt; In a similar way, Relgis' scattered [[memoir]]s, among them ''Strămoșul meu, "David Gugumanul"'' ("My Ancestor, 'Nitwit David' "), shed intimate light on his ideas about Judaism.&lt;ref name="ddgsIII-IV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gslvprolog"/&gt;

Other such [[Didacticism|didactic]] texts detail Relgis' advice on the art of living. ''Glasuri în surdină'' is noted for depicting the disorientation of a young man who becomes deaf: Relgis' [[alter ego]], Miron, finds that such a disability has turned his old friends into opportunistic exploiters, but his imaginative spirit and his (minutely chronicled) self-determination allow him to rebel and start over in life.&lt;ref&gt;Batson &amp; Bergman, p.xi-xii, 206, 307-308&lt;/ref&gt; However, deaf studies experts Trenton W. Batson and Eugene Bergman write, Miron "is not really representative of the deaf majority", leading a life of isolation and, out of despair, seeking out a miracle cure for deafness.&lt;ref&gt;Batson &amp; Bergman, p.xii&lt;/ref&gt; Relgis' patron [[Eugen Lovinescu]] was especially critical of the work, judging its "self-analyzing" [[internal monologue]] as burdensome.&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu, p.238&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' ''Petru Arbore'' is noted by [[Geo Șerban]] as a "rarity" in Romanian literature, "instructive despite its excessive rhetoricism."&lt;ref name="ddgsII"/&gt; Eugen Lovinescu notes its traditional theme of social "inadaptation", which, to him, echoes the [[right-wing]] didacticism of ''[[Sămănătorul]]'' writers.&lt;ref name="Lovinescu, p.237"&gt;Lovinescu, p.237&lt;/ref&gt; Over the three volumes, the idealistic Arbore falls in love with women of various conditions, and, to the backdrop of World War I, tries to build a business as an army supplier.&lt;ref name="Lovinescu, p.237"/&gt; Relgis himself warned that the book should not be seen as his [[autobiography]], but as the "spiritual mirror" of each reader.&lt;ref name="ddgsIV"/&gt; Lovinescu believed the work to be heavily influenced by Rolland's ''[[Jean-Christophe]]'', lacking "inventiveness".&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu, p.237-238&lt;/ref&gt;

Called a "sweet volume of essays" by Clopoțel,&lt;ref name="icmiron"/&gt; ''Prieteniile lui Miron'' chronicles love and desire in relation to age and sex. The work shows a young girl losing and then regaining her faith in true love, a daring young man, "who mistakes love for sport", being rejected by his female companions, and lastly a mature couple whose love has undergone the test of friendship.&lt;ref name="icmiron"/&gt; Clopoțel praised the text for its "seriousness", "finesse" and "reflections enlightened by knowledge and responsibility", concluding: "[This is] a literature of moral health."&lt;ref name="icmiron"/&gt;

These characteristics were also discerned by critics in his various contributions to [[Latin American literature]]. Courtoisie found ''Diario de otoño'', a book that is "miscellaneous, multithematic, [moving] between the poetic and the everyday", comparable to the ''Fermentario'' essays of Uruguay's [[Carlos Vaz Ferreira]].&lt;ref name="acpensador"/&gt; According to critic William T. Starr, ''El hombre libre frente a la barbarie totalitaria'' and other such recollections reveal "more about Relgis than about Rolland".&lt;ref&gt;William T. Starr, "Romain Rolland", in Douglas W. Alden, Richard A. Brooks (eds.), ''A Critical Bibliography of French Literature: The Twentieth Century'', [[Syracuse University Press]], New York City, 1979, p.451-452, 463.  {{ISBN|0-8156-2204-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poetry===
During his time at ''Fronda'', Eugen Relgis and his fellow writers published [[Collective poetry|collective]], [[Experimental literature|experimental]] and unsigned poems, largely echoing the influence of Arghezi and Minulescu, but, according to Cernat, "aesthetically monstrous".&lt;ref name="pc56"/&gt; This perspective is echoed by Șerban, who notes that Relgis' debut as a poet was largely without "convincing results".&lt;ref name="ddgsII"/&gt;  In ''Triumful neființei'', the main stylistic reference was, according to Lovinescu, the Romanian Symbolist [[Prose poetry|prose poet]] [[Dimitrie Anghel]], imitated to the point of "[[pastiche]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu, p.100, 237&lt;/ref&gt;

With time, Relgis developed a style deemed "the poetry of professions" by George Călinescu. According to Călinescu's classification, Relgis the poet is similar in this respect to fellow Symbolists [[Alexandru Tudor-Miu]] and [[Barbu Solacolu]], but also to [[Simona Basarab]], [[Leon Feraru]], [[Cristian Sârbu]] and [[Stelian Constantin-Stelian]].&lt;ref name="gc937"/&gt; The same critic notes that Relgis "attempted, with some beautiful poetic suggestions, to establish a modern-era mythology with abstract gods [...] and other machinist monsters."&lt;ref name="gc936"&gt;Călinescu, p.936&lt;/ref&gt; Lovinescu describes the poet in Relgis as one who "survived" through humanitarian propaganda, returning "in a compact [[Émile Verhaeren|Verhaeren]] form, rhetorical and accumulative."&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; Lovinescu includes the resulting works in a category of "descriptive" and "social" poems, relating Relgis to Feraru, [[Alice Călugăru]], [[Aron Cotruș]], [[Vasile Demetrius]], [[Camil Petrescu]] and [[I. Valerian]].&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu, p.98-104&lt;/ref&gt;

Relgis' poems, Călinescu notes, were individual portraits of industrial machinery ("The Elevator", "The Cement Mixer") or workers ("The Builder", "The Day Laborer"), as temples and deities; by "natural association", the critic suggests, Relgis applied the same technique in his lyrical homages to the very large animals ("The Giraffe", "The Elephant"), but "this requires greater means of suggestion".&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.936-937&lt;/ref&gt; In one piece quoted by George Călinescu, Relgis showed a bricklayer contemplating the modern city from the top of a [[scaffolding]] structure:
{{Verse translation|
De sus, pe schelele ușoare
Orașul îl cuprind întreg,
Masiv și dârz: —enormă stâncă
Ce-a fost ascunsă-n noapte-adâncă,
Și care s-a ivit sub soare
Prin străduinți a mii de ani—
Urcând încet, neînfrânat,
Prin forța micilor titani.&lt;ref name="gc936"/&gt;
|
Up there, on flimsy scaffolds,
I stare all across this city,
Massive and daring: —enormous rock
That was hidden into deepest night
And reemerged under the sun,
Millennial efforts behind it—
Climbing slowly, ceaselessly,
Fed by the force of tiny titans.}}

==Legacy==
The political ideas of Eugen Relgis were largely incompatible with the totalitarianism prevalent in Romania between World War II and the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]]: as Rose notes, the scholar was persecuted by "four dictatorial regimes in his native country".&lt;ref name="wr12"/&gt; Before this, Șerban writes, Relgis' intellectual contacts may have stimulated public debate, even though the writer himself could not claim the status of "opinion maker".&lt;ref name="ddgsII"/&gt; Likewise, Boris Marian describes Relgis as "almost forgotten" by Romanians after his self-exile.&lt;ref name="bmiudaistul"/&gt; In addition to Iosif Gutman, Relgis' Jewish Romanian disciples included [[Fălticeni]] journalist Iacob Bacalu, founder of a Relgis Circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.romanianjewish.org/ro/mosteniri_ale_culturii_iudaice_03_11_06.html ''Fălticenii prin timp și peste timp''], at the [http://www.romanianjewish.org/ro/mosteniri_ale_culturii_iudaice_03_11_06.html Romanian Jewish Community site]; retrieved March 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; According to journalist Victor Frunză, Relgis' targeting by [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censorship]] had a paradoxical antisemitic undertone, as one of the repressive measures which touched Jewish culture in general.&lt;ref name="ascumsedistruge"/&gt;

Attempts to recover Relgis' work were made during the latter half of Romanian communist rule and after the 1989, several of them from within the Romanian Jewish community. In April 1982, the Jewish cultural journal ''Revista Cultului Mozaic'' published [[Leon Volovici]]'s note about Relgis and Judaism.&lt;ref name="ddgsIV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gslvprolog"/&gt; Late in the 1980s, Volovici also contacted Relgis' surviving sisters, then Relgis himself, becoming curator of the manuscripts left behind by the philosopher upon his relocation to South America.&lt;ref name="ddgsIV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gslvprolog"/&gt; These were later donated to the Philippide Institute of the [[Romanian Academy]], where they are kept as the Eugen Relgis library fund.&lt;ref name="ddgsIV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gslvprolog"/&gt;

Relgis enjoys a more enduring reputation abroad. Initially, his anarchist eugenics enjoyed some popularity among [[Anarchism in Spain|Spanish anarchists]];&lt;ref name="filosofiaer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turda, p.94&lt;/ref&gt; his pacifism also inspired [[Llorenç Vidal Vidal]], the [[Balearic Islands|Balearic]] poet and educator.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [[Llorenç Vidal Vidal]], [http://ibdigital.uib.cat/greenstone/collect/premsaForanaMallorca/index/assoc/HASH01c1/2ee9b2cf.dir/doc.pdf "Mirador cultural.

'''Evolution of metal ions in biological systems''' refers to the incorporation of metallic ions into living organisms and how it has changed over time. Metal ions have been associated with biological systems for billions of years, but only in the last century have scientists began to truly appreciate the scale of their influence. Major ([[iron]], [[manganese]], [[magnesium]] and [[zinc]]) and minor ([[copper]], [[cobalt]], [[nickel]], [[molybdenum]], [[tungsten]]) metal ions have become aligned with living organisms through the interplay of [[Weathering#Biogeochemical weathering|biogeochemical weathering]] and [[metabolic pathway]]s involving the products of that weathering. The associated complexes have evolved over time.

Natural development of chemicals and elements challenged organisms to adapt or die. Current organisms require [[redox]] reactions to induce [[metabolism]] and other life processes. [[Metal]]s have a tendency to lose [[electron]]s and are important for redox reactions. &lt;blockquote&gt;“Metals have become so central to cellular function that the collection of metal-binding proteins (referred to as the [[metallome]]s) accounts for over 30% of all proteins in the cell. Metals are known to be involved in over 40% of enzymatic reactions, and metal-binding proteins carry out at least one step in almost all [[biological pathway]]s”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.springerlink.com/index/10.5822/978-1-61091-221-1|title=Evolution in a Toxic World - Springer|last=Monosson|first=Emily|language=en|doi=10.5822/978-1-61091-221-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Metals are also toxic so a balance must be acquired to regulate where the metals are in an organism as well as in what quantities. Many organisms have flexible systems in which they can exchange one metal for another if one is scarce. Metals in this discussion are naturally occurring elements that have a tendency to undergo [[oxidation]]. Vanadium, molybdenum, cobalt, copper, chromium, iron, manganese, nickel, and zinc are deemed essential because without them biological function is impaired.

==Origins==

[[File:Oxygenation-atm-2.svg|thumb|The Great Oxygenation Event. The upper red and lower green lines represent the range of the estimates.|300x300px]]

The Earth began as an iron aquatic world with low oxygen. The [[Great Oxygenation Event]] occurred approximately 2.4 [[Gya|Ga]] (billion years ago) as cyanobacteria and photosynthetic life induced the presence of [[dioxygen]] in the planet’s atmosphere. Iron became insoluble (as did other metals) and scarce while other metals became soluble. Sulfur was a very important element during this time. Once oxygen was released into the environment, [[Sulfate minerals|sulfates]] made metals more soluble and released those metals into the environment; especially into the water.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Incorporation of metals perhaps combatted oxidative stress.

The central chemistry of all these cells has to be [[Organic redox reaction|reductive]] in order that the synthesis of the required chemicals, especially [[biopolymers]], is possible. The different [[anaerobic digestion|anaerobic]], [[Autocatalysis|autocatalysed]], reductive, metabolic pathways seen in the earliest known cells developed in separate energised vesicles, [[protocell]]s, where they were produced cooperatively with certain bases of the nucleic acids.&lt;ref name="Russel2003"&gt;{{cite journal

  |doi=10.1098/rstb.2002.1183 |pmid=12594918 |pmc=1693102
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hypotheses proposed for how elements became essential is their relative quantity in the environment as life formed. This has produced research on the origin of life; for instance, [[Leslie Orgel|Orgel]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]] hypothesized that life was extraterrestrial due to the alleged low abundance of molybdenum on early Earth (it is now suspected that there were larger quantities than previously thought{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}). Another example is life forming around [[Hydrothermal vent|thermal vents]] based on the availability of zinc and sulfur.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In conjunction with this theory is that life evolved as [[Chemotroph|chemoautotrophs]]. Therefore, life occurred around metals and not in response to their presence. Some evidence for this theory is that inorganic matter has self-contained attributes that life adopted as shown by life's compartmentalization.&lt;ref name="Russel2003" /&gt;

===Catalysis===

====Redox catalysts====
The [[Prebiotic world|prebiotic]] chemistry of life had to be reductive in order to obtain, e.g. [[Carbon monoxide|Carbon monoxide (CO)]] and [[Hydrogen cyanide|Hydrogen cyanide (HCN)]] from existing [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Dinitrogen|N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in the atmosphere. CO and HCN were precursor molecules of the essential [[biomolecules]], [[proteins]], [[lipids]], [[nucleotides]] and [[sugars]].&lt;ref name=Gonzalez1995&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, atmospheric oxygen levels increased considerably, and it was then necessary for cells to have control over the reduction and oxidation of such small molecules in order to build and break down cells when necessary, without the inevitable oxidation (breaking down) of everything. [[Transition metal]] ions, due to their multiple oxidation states, were the only elements capable of controlling the oxidation states of such molecules, and thus were selected for.&lt;ref name=Kleczkowski&gt;

====Condensation and hydrolysis====

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metal ion binding to such O-donors was required to build the biological polymers, since the bond is generally weak, it can catalyze the required reaction and dissociate after (i.e. [[Magnesium|Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] in [[DNA synthesis]]).

===Prebiotic (anaerobic) conditions===

Around 4 [[Gya|Ga]] , the acidic seawater contained high amounts of [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] and thus created a reducing environment with a [[Reduction potential|potential]] of around -0.2 V.&lt;ref name=Williams2006/&gt; So any element that had a large negative value with respect to the [[reduction potential]] of the environment was available in its free ionic form and can subsequently be incorporated into cells, i.e. [[Magnesium|Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] has a [[reduction potential]] of -2.372 V, and was available in its ionic form at that time.

===Aerobic conditions===

Around 2 [[Gya|Ga]], an increase in atmospheric [[oxygen]] levels took place, causing an oxidation of [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] in the surroundings, and an increase in the pH of the sea water. The resulting environment had become more oxidizing and thus allowed the later incorporation of the heavier metals such as [[copper]] and [[zinc]].&lt;ref name=Williams2012&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Irving-Williams series==

Another factor affecting the availability of metal ions was their solubilities with [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]]. [[Hydrogen sulfide]] was abundant in the early sea giving rise to [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] in the prebiotic acidic conditions and HS&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; in the neutral ([[pH]] = 7.0) conditions. In the series of metal sulfides, insolubility increases at neutral pH following the [[Irving-Williams series]]:

Mn(II) &lt; Fe(II) &lt; Co(II) ≤ Ni(II) &lt; Cu(II) &gt; Zn(II)

So in high amounts of [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]], which was the [[Prebiotic world|prebiotic]] condition, only [[Iron|Fe]] was most prominently available in its ionic form due to its low insolubility with [[sulfides]]. The increasing oxidation of [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] into [[Sulfate|SO{{su|b=4|p=2−}}]] leads to the later release of Co&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt;, Ni&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt;, Cu&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt;, and Zn&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt; since all of their [[sulfates]] are soluble.

==Origins==

[[File:Oxygenation-atm-2.svg|thumb|The Great Oxygenation Event. The upper red and lower green lines represent the range of the estimates.|300x300px]]

The Earth began as an iron aquatic world with low oxygen. The [[Great Oxygenation Event]] occurred approximately 2.4 [[Gya|Ga]] (billion years ago) as cyanobacteria and photosynthetic life induced the presence of [[dioxygen]] in the planet’s atmosphere. Iron became insoluble (as did other metals) and scarce while other metals became soluble. Sulfur was a very important element during this time. Once oxygen was released into the environment, [[Sulfate minerals|sulfates]] made metals more soluble and released those metals into the environment; especially into the water.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Incorporation of metals perhaps combatted oxidative stress.

The central chemistry of all these cells has to be [[Organic redox reaction|reductive]] in order that the synthesis of the required chemicals, especially [[biopolymers]], is possible. The different [[anaerobic digestion|anaerobic]], [[Autocatalysis|autocatalysed]], reductive, metabolic pathways seen in the earliest known cells developed in separate energised vesicles, [[protocell]]s, where they were produced cooperatively with certain bases of the nucleic acids.&lt;ref name="Russel2003"/&gt;

Hypotheses proposed for how elements became essential is their relative quantity in the environment as life formed. This has produced research on the origin of life; for instance, [[Leslie Orgel|Orgel]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]] hypothesized that life was extraterrestrial due to the alleged low abundance of molybdenum on early Earth (it is now suspected that there were larger quantities than previously thought{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}). Another example is life forming around [[Hydrothermal vent|thermal vents]] based on the availability of zinc and sulfur.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In conjunction with this theory is that life evolved as [[Chemotroph|chemoautotrophs]]. Therefore, life occurred around metals and not in response to their presence. Some evidence for this theory is that inorganic matter has self-contained attributes that life adopted as shown by life's compartmentalization.&lt;ref name="Russel2003" /&gt;

==Importance of metal ions in evolution==

===Catalysis===

====Redox catalysts====
The [[Prebiotic world|prebiotic]] chemistry of life had to be reductive in order to obtain, e.g. [[Carbon monoxide|Carbon monoxide (CO)]] and [[Hydrogen cyanide|Hydrogen cyanide (HCN)]] from existing [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Dinitrogen|N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in the atmosphere. CO and HCN were precursor molecules of the essential [[biomolecules]], [[proteins]], [[lipids]], [[nucleotides]] and [[sugars]].&lt;ref name=Gonzalez1995/&gt; However, atmospheric oxygen levels increased considerably, and it was then necessary for cells to have control over the reduction and oxidation of such small molecules in order to build and break down cells when necessary, without the inevitable oxidation (breaking down) of everything. [[Transition metal]] ions, due to their multiple oxidation states, were the only elements capable of controlling the oxidation states of such molecules, and thus were selected for.&lt;ref name=Kleczkowski/&gt;

====Condensation and hydrolysis====
O-donors{{Definition needed|date=May 2017}} such as [[Hydrogen Phosphate|HPO{{su|b=4|p=2−}}]] were abundant in the prebiotic atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Williams2006/&gt; Metal ion binding to such O-donors was required to build the biological polymers, since the bond is generally weak, it can catalyze the required reaction and dissociate after (i.e. [[Magnesium|Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] in [[DNA synthesis]]).

===Prebiotic (anaerobic) conditions===

Around 4 [[Gya|Ga]] , the acidic seawater contained high amounts of [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] and thus created a reducing environment with a [[Reduction potential|potential]] of around -0.2 V.&lt;ref name=Williams2006/&gt; So any element that had a large negative value with respect to the [[reduction potential]] of the environment was available in its free ionic form and can subsequently be incorporated into cells, i.e. [[Magnesium|Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] has a [[reduction potential]] of -2.372 V, and was available in its ionic form at that time.

===Aerobic conditions===

Around 2 [[Gya|Ga]], an increase in atmospheric [[oxygen]] levels took place, causing an oxidation of [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] in the surroundings, and an increase in the pH of the sea water. The resulting environment had become more oxidizing and thus allowed the later incorporation of the heavier metals such as [[copper]] and [[zinc]].&lt;ref name=Williams2012/&gt;

==Irving-Williams series==

Another factor affecting the availability of metal ions was their solubilities with [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]]. [[Hydrogen sulfide]] was abundant in the early sea giving rise to [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] in the prebiotic acidic conditions and HS&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; in the neutral ([[pH]] = 7.0) conditions. In the series of metal sulfides, insolubility increases at neutral pH following the [[Irving-Williams series]]:

Mn(II) &lt; Fe(II) &lt; Co(II) ≤ Ni(II) &lt; Cu(II) &gt; Zn(II)

So in high amounts of [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]], which was the [[Prebiotic world|prebiotic]] condition, only [[Iron|Fe]] was most prominently available in its ionic form due to its low insolubility with [[sulfides]]. The increasing oxidation of [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] into [[Sulfate|SO{{su|b=4|p=2−}}]] leads to the later release of Co&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt;, Ni&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt;, Cu&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt;, and Zn&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt; since all of their [[sulfates]] are soluble.

==Metal ions==

===Magnesium===
[[Magnesium]] is the eighth most abundant element on earth. It is the fourth most abundant element in vertebrates and the most abundant divalent cation within cells. The most available form of magnesium (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) for living organisms can be found in the hydrosphere. The concentration of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in seawater is around 55 mM. Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is readily available to cells during early evolution due to its high solubility in water. Other transition metals like calcium precipitate from aqueous solutions at much lower concentrations than the corresponding Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; salts.&lt;ref name=Maguire2002&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since magnesium was readily available in early evolution, it can be found in every cell type living organism. Magnesium in anaerobic prokaryotes can be found in [[Adenosine triphosphate|MgATP]]. Magnesium also has many functions in prokaryotes such as [[glycolysis]], all kinases, NTP reaction, signalling, DNA/RNA structures and light capture. In aerobic eukaryotes, magnesium can be found in [[cytoplasm]] and [[chloroplasts]]. The reactions in these cell compartments are glycolysis, [[photophosphorylation]] and [[carbon assimilation]].

ATP, the main source of energy in almost all living organisms, must bind with metal ions such as Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to function. Examination of cells with limited magnesium supply has shown that a lack of magnesium can cause a decrease in ATP.&lt;ref name=Gout2014&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; MgATP can be found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes cells. However, most of the ATP in cells is MgATP. Following the [[Irving–Williams series]], magnesium has a higher binding constant than the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, the dominant ATP in living organisms is MgATP. A greater binding constant also given magnesium the advantage as a better catalyst over other competing transition metals.

===Manganese===
[[File:Photosystem-II 2AXT.PNG|thumb|Magnesium Center in Cyanobacterial photosystem II. Incorporation of manganese sparked evolution of complex plant life.|300x300px]]

Evidence suggests that manganese (Mn) was first incorporated into biological systems roughly 3.2 - 2.8 billion years ago, during the [[Archean|Archean Period]]. Together with calcium, it formed the manganese-calcium oxide complex (determined by [[X-ray diffraction]]) which consisted of a manganese cluster, essentially an inorganic cubane (cubical) structure. The incorporation of a manganese center in [[photosystem II]] was highly significant, as it allowed for [[photosynthetic]] oxygen evolution of plants. The [[oxygen-evolving complex]] (OEC) is a critical component of photosystem II contained in the [[thylakoid membranes]] of chloroplasts; it is responsible for terminal [[photooxidation]] of water during [[light reactions]].&lt;ref name=Williams2007&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incorporation of Mn in proteins allowed the complexes the ability to reduce reactive oxygen species in Mn-[[Superoxide dismutase|superoxide dismutatse]] (MnSOD) and [[catalase]], in electron transfer-dependent catalysis (for instance in certain class I [[ribonucleotide reductases]]) and in the oxidation of water by photosystem II (PSII), where the production of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances is decreased. This is due to manganese's ability to reduce superoxide anion and [[hydroxyl radicals]] as well as its chain-breaking capacity.&lt;ref name=Salomon&gt;

===Iron===

[[Iron]] (Fe) is the most abundant element in the Earth and the fourth most abundant element in the crust, approximately 5 percent by mass. Due to the abundance of iron and its role in [[biological systems]], the transition and mineralogical stages of iron have played a key role in Earth surface systems. It played a larger role in the geological past in [[Marine geology|marine geochemistry]], as evidenced by the deposits of [[Precambrian]] iron-rich sediments. The [[redox]] transformation of Fe(II) to Fe(III), or vice versa, is vital to a number of biological and element cycling processes. The [[Reduction (chemistry)|reduction]] of Fe(III) is seen to oxidize sulfur (from H{{sub|2}}S to SO{{sub|4}}{{sup|-2}}), which is a central process in marine sediments. Many of the first [[metalloproteins]] consisted of iron-sulphur complexes formed during [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name=Taylor2011&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iron is the main redox metal in biological systems. In [[proteins]], it is found in a variety of sites and cofactors, including, for instance, [[Haem|haem groups]], Fe–O–Fe sites, and iron–sulfur clusters.

The prevalence of iron is apparently due to the large availability of Fe(II) in the initial evolution of living organisms, before the rise of photosynthesis and an increase in atmospheric oxygen levels which resulted in the precipitation of iron in the environment as Fe(OH){{sub|3}}. It has flexible redox properties because such properties are sensitive to [[ligand]] coordination, including geometry. Iron can be also used in enzymes due to its [[Lewis acid]] properties, for example in nitrile hydratase. Iron is frequently found in mononuclear sites in the reduced Fe(II) form, and functions in dioxygen activation; this function is used as a major mechanism adopted by living organisms to avoid the kinetic barrier hindering the transformation of organic compounds by O{{sub|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;

Variation in the related proteins with any one of these chemical forms of iron has produced a wide range of enzymes. All of these arrangements are modified to function both in the sense of reactivity and the positioning of the protein in the cell. Iron can have various redox and spin states, and it can be held in many stereochemistries.&lt;ref name=Williams1985&gt;

===Nickel and cobalt===

[[File:Cobalamin.png|thumbnail|Coenzyme B12- Theorized as the first occurrence of cobalt in a biological system]]

Around 4-3 [[Gya|Ga]], [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] [[prokaryotes]] began developing metal and organic [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] for light absorption. They ultimately ended up making [[chlorophyll]] from Mg(II), as is found in [[cyanobacteria]] and plants, leading to modern [[photosynthesis]]. However, chlorophyll synthesis requires numerous steps. The process starts with uroporphyrin, a primitive precursor to the [[porphyrin]] ring which may be [[Biotic component|biotic]] or [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] in origin, which is then modified in cells differently to make [[Magnesium|Mg]], [[Iron|Fe]], [[Nickel|nickel (Ni)]], and [[Cobalt|cobalt (Co)]] complexes. The centers of these rings are not selective, thus allowing the variety of metal ions to be incorporated. Mg porphyrin gives rise to chlorophyll, Fe porphyrin to [[heme]] proteins, Ni porphyrin yields factor [[Cofactor F430|F-430]], and Co porphyrin [[Coenzyme B12]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank, S. et al.

===Copper===
Before the [[Great Oxygenation Event]], copper was not readily available for living organisms. Most early copper was Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cu. This oxidation state of copper is not very soluble in water. One billion years ago, after the great oxidation event the oxygen pressure rose sufficiently to oxidise Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, increasing its solubility in water. As a result, the copper became much more available for living organisms.

Most copper-containing proteins and enzymes can be found in [[eukaryotes]]. Only a handful of [[prokaryotes]] such as aerobic bacteria and cyanobacteria contain copper enzymes or proteins. Copper can be found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes [[superoxide dismutase|superoxide dismutase (SOD)]] enzyme. There are three distinct types of SOD, containing Mn, Fe and Cu respectively. Mn-SOD and Fe-SOD are found in most prokaryotes and mitochondria of the eukaryotic cell. Cu-SOD can be found in the cytoplasmic fraction of the eukaryotic cells. The three elements, copper, iron and manganese, can all catalyze superoxide to ordinary molecular oxygen or hydrogen peroxide. However, Cu-SOD is more efficient than Fe-SOD and Mn-SOD. Most prokaryotes only utilize Fe-SOD or Mn-SOD due to the lack of copper in the environment. Some organisms did not develop Cu-SOD due to the lack of a gene pool for the Cu-SOD adoption.&lt;ref&gt;

  |doi=10.1016/0303-2647(83)90029-1
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zinc===

[[Zinc|Zinc (Zn)]] was incorporated into living cells in two waves. Four to three [[Gya|Ga]], anaerobic prokaryotes arose, and the atmosphere was full of [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] and highly reductive. Thus most zinc was in the form of insoluble [[Zinc sulfide|ZnS]]. However, because seawater at the time was slightly acidic, some Zn(II) was available in its ionic form and became part of early anaerobic prokaryotes’ external [[proteases]], external [[nucleases]], internal [[synthetase]]s and [[dehydrogenases]].&lt;ref name="Williams2012"/&gt;

During the second wave, once the Great Oxygenation Event occurred, more Zn(II) ions were available in the seawater. This allowed its incorporation in the single-cell eukaryotes as they arose at this time. It is believed that the later addition of ions such as zinc and copper allowed them to displace iron and manganese from the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD). Fe and Mn complexes dissociate readily (Irving-Williams series) while Zn and Cu do not. This is why eukaryotic SOD contains Cu or Zn and its prokaryotic counterpart contains Fe or Mn.&lt;ref name="Williams2012"/&gt;

Zn (II) doesn’t pose an oxidation threat to the [[cytoplasm]]. This allowed it to become a major cytoplasmic element in the eukaryotes. It became associated with a new group of [[Transcription factor|transcription proteins]], [[zinc fingers]]. This could only have occurred due to the long life of eukaryotes, which allowed time for zinc to exchange and hence become an internal messenger coordinating the action of other transcription factors during growth.&lt;ref name="Williams2012"/&gt;

===Molybdenum===

[[Molybdenum]] (Mo) is the most abundant [[transition element]] in solution in the sea (mostly as dianionic molybdate ion) and in living organisms, its abundance in the Earth’s crust is quite low. Therefore, the use of Mo by living organisms seems surprising at first glance. [[Archaea]], bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, including humans, require molybdenum. It is also found in over 50 different [[enzymes]]. Its hydrolysis to water-soluble oxo-anionic species makes Mo readily accessible. Mo is found in the [[active site]]s of [[metalloenzymes]] that perform key transformations in the [[metabolism]] of carbon, nitrogen, arsenic, selenium, sulfur,  and chlorine compounds.
The mononuclear Mo enzymes are widely distributed in the biosphere; they catalyze many significant reactions in the metabolism of nitrogen and sulfur-containing compounds as well as various [[Carbonyl|carbonyl compounds]] (e.g., aldehydes, CO, and CO{{sub|2}}). [[Nitrate reductases]] enzymes are important for the nitrogen cycle. They belong to a class of enzymes with a mononuclear Mo center and they catalyze the metabolism reaction of C,  N, S, etc., in bacteria, plants, animals, and humans.&lt;ref name=Sigel&gt;

  |volume=39
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the oxidation of [[sulfides]], The first considerable development was that of [[aerobic bacteria]] which could now utilize Mo.&lt;ref name=Williams2007/&gt; As oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere and oceans, the reaction of MoS{{sub|2}} to MoO{{sub|4}} also increased. This reaction made the highly soluble molybdate ion available for incorporation into critical metalloenzymes, and may have thus allowed life to thrive. It allowed organisms to occupy new ecological niches. Mo plays an important role in the reduction of [[dinitrogen]] to [[ammonia]], which occurs in one type of [[nitrogenase]]s. These enzymes are used by bacteria that usually live in a [[Symbiotic relationships|symbiotic]] relationship with plants; their role is [[nitrogen fixation]], which is vital for sustaining life on earth. Mo enzymes also play important roles in [[sulfur metabolism]] of organisms ranging from bacteria to humans.&lt;ref name=Sigel/&gt;

===Tungsten===

[[File:Pyrococcus furiosus.png|thumb|Pyrococcus furiosus - one of the few modern organisms where the incorporation tungsten is still essential.|300x300px]]

Tungsten is one of the oldest metal ions to be incorporated in biological systems, preceding The Great Oxygenation Event. Before the abundance of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere, oceans teemed with [[sulfur]] and tungsten, while molybdenum, a metal that is highly similar chemically, was inaccessible in solid form. The abundance of tungsten and lack of free molybdenum likely explains why early marine organisms incorporated the former instead of the latter. However, as cyanobacteria began to fill the atmosphere with oxygen, molybdenum became available (molybdenum becomes soluble when exposed to oxygen) and molybdenum began to replace tungsten in the majority of [[Metabolism|metabolic processes]], which is seen today, as tungsten is only present in the biological complexes of prokaryotes (methanogens, gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes), and is only obligated in [[hyperthermophile|hyperthermophilic]] [[archaea]] such as [[Pyrococcus furiosus|P. furiosus]]. Tungesten's extremely high melting point (3,422&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C), partially explains its necessity in these archaea, found in extremely hot areas.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although research into the specific enzyme complexes in which tungsten is incorporated is relatively recent (1970s), natural tungstoenzymes are abundantly found in a large number of prokaryotic microorganisms. These include formate dehydrogenase, formyl methanufuran dehydrogenase, acetylene hydratase, and a class of phylogenetically related oxidoreductases that catalyze the reversible oxidation of aldehydes. The first crystal structure of a tungsten- or [[pterin]]-containing enzyme, that of [[aldehyde]] [[ferredoxin]] [[oxidoreductase]] from P. furiosus, has revealed a [[Active site|catalytic site]] with one W atom coordinated to two pterin molecules which are themselves bridged by a magnesium ion.&lt;ref name=Sigel/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4160">A '''formal proof''' or '''derivation''' is a finite sequence of [[Proposition (philosophy)|sentences]] (called [[well-formed formula]]s in the case of a [[formal language]]), each of which is an [[axiom]], an assumption, or follows from the preceding sentences in the sequence by a [[rule of inference]]. If the set of assumptions is empty, then the last sentence in a formal proof is called a [[theorem]] of the [[formal system]]. The notion of theorem is not in general [[effective method|effective]], therefore there may be no method by which we can always find a proof of a given sentence or determine that none exists. The concept of [[natural deduction]] is a [[generalization]] of the concept of proof.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, ''deduction''&lt;/ref&gt;

The theorem is a [[syntactic consequence]] of all the well-formed formulas preceding it in the proof. For a well-formed formula to qualify as part of a proof, it must be the result of applying a rule of the [[deductive apparatus]] of some formal system to the previous well-formed formulae in the proof sequence. 

Formal proofs often are constructed with the help of computers in [[interactive theorem proving]]. Significantly, these proofs can be [[automated proof checking|checked automatically]], also by computer. Checking formal proofs is usually simple, while the problem of ''finding'' proofs ([[automated theorem proving]]) is usually [[Computationally intractable#Intractability|computationally intractable]] and/or only [[semi-decidable]], depending upon the formal system in use.

== Background ==
=== Formal language ===
{{Main|Formal language}} 

A ''formal language'' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of finite [[sequence (mathematics)|sequences]] of [[symbol]]s. Such a language can be defined without [[reference]] to any [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]s of any of its expressions; it can exist before any [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] is assigned to it &amp;ndash; that is, before it has any meaning. Formal proofs are expressed in some formal languages.

=== Formal grammar ===
{{main|Formal grammar|Formation rule}}

A ''formal grammar'' (also called ''formation rules'') is a precise description of the [[well-formed formula]]s of a formal language. It is synonymous with the set of [[String (computer science)|strings]] over the [[alphabet]] of the formal language which constitute well formed formulas. However, it does not describe their [[semantics]] (i.e. what they mean).

=== Formal systems ===
{{main|Formal system}}

A ''formal system'' (also called a ''logical calculus'', or a ''logical system'') consists of a formal language together with a [[deductive apparatus]] (also called a ''deductive system''). The deductive apparatus may consist of a set of [[transformation rule]]s (also called ''inference rules'') or a set of [[axiom]]s, or have both. A formal system is used to [[Proof theory|derive]] one expression from one or more other expressions.

=== Interpretations ===
{{main|Formal semantics (logic)|Interpretation (logic)}}

An ''interpretation'' of a formal system is the assignment of meanings to the symbols, and values to the sentences of a formal system. The study of interpretations is called [[Formal semantics (logic)|formal semantics]]. ''Giving an interpretation'' is synonymous with ''constructing a [[Structure (mathematical logic)|model]].

'''Frank Sargent Hoffman''' (February 9, 1852 - 1928) was an American [[philosopher]] who wrote on [[psychology]] and [[religion]].

Hoffman was born in [[Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin]]. In 1876 he graduated from [[Amherst College]] and obtained his PhD in 1896. He received a [[Bachelor of Divinity]] degree from [[Yale University]].&lt;ref name="Vranken"&gt;[[Andrew Van Vranken Raymond|Raymond, Andrew Van Vranken]]. (1907).

'''Franz Xaver Maximilian Zippe''' ('''František Xaver Zippe''') (15 January 1791 in [[Kytlice|Nieder Falkenau (now Kytlice)]] &amp;ndash; 22 February 1863 in [[Vienna]]), was a [[Bohemia]]n natural philosopher, scientist and mineralogist.

==Biography==
After attending secondary school in Dresden, Zippe studied philosophy at the Prague University from 1807 to 1809. While still a student, he attended lectures of the chemist [[Karl August Neumann]] (1771-1866) and [[Josef Johann Steinmann]] (1779-1833), a professor of general chemistry at the [[Czech Technical University in Prague|Polytechnic Academy in Prague]]. Zippe developed a close relationship with Dr. Steinmann. Starting in 1819 Zippe taught mineralogy, first as an adjunct, and beginning in 1822 as an assistant professor at the Polytechnic. In 1835 he became a full professor.

Zippe was a close associate of Count Kaspar Maria von Sternberg, the founder of the ''Prague Museum of the Bohemian Kingdom'' (predecessor of the [[National Museum (Prague)|National Museum in Prague]]). Zippe, who was known during his youth for his passion for collecting was one of the first conservators of the Institute. Beginning in March 1819 he described and cataloged the collection and added to it his own self-made crystal models.

In November 1824, Zippe was placed in charge of the mineralogical department of the museum, which position he held until 1842. During this period, he enriched the museum with numerous mineral specimens from his frequent collecting trips which included mining sites in the mountains of the [[Krkonoše|Riesengebirge (Krkonoše)]], [[Jizera Mountains|Isergebirge (Jizera)]] and [[Hrubý Jeseník|Altvatergebirge (Hrubý Jeseníky)]]. Beginning in 1833 he worked with Johann Gottfried Sommer on the 16-volume ''Topography of Bohemia''.

In 1846, Zippe became a corresponding member of the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities|Bavarian Academy of Sciences]]. In 1847 he became one of the first members of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences|Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna]].  From 31 August 1849 until 1 October 1850, he served as the Director of the [[Příbram#Mining University in Příbram (1894–1945)|Mining Academy]] at [[Příbram]]. Beginning in the Fall of 1850, he taught mineralogy at the [[University of Vienna]].

The uranium mineral [[Zippeite]], first found at [[Jáchymov|St. Joachimsthal (Jáchymov)]], was named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;Rösler, Hans Jürgen (1981) ''Lehrbuch der Mineralogie'' (''Manual of Mineralogy'') Deutscher Verlag für Grundstoffindustrie, Leipzig, page 418, {{ISBN|978-3-342-00288-8}}, in German&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3309">In [[population genetics]], the '''Hill–Robertson effect''', or '''Hill–Robertson interference''', is a phenomenon first identified by [[William G. Hill|Bill Hill]] and [[Alan Robertson (geneticist)|Alan Robertson]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, W. G., and A. Robertson, 1966 The effect of linkage on limits to artificial selection. ''[[Genetical Research]]''. 8: 269–294.&lt;/ref&gt;  It provides an explanation as to why there may be an evolutionary advantage to [[genetic recombination]].

==Explanation==
In a population of finite size which is subject to [[natural selection]], random [[linkage disequilibrium|linkage disequilibria]] will occur. These can be caused by [[genetic drift]] or by [[mutation]], and they will tend to slow down the process of [[evolution]] by natural selection.&lt;ref name=HC&gt;Hartl, D. L. &amp; Clark, A. G. (2007). Principles of Population genetics, 4th ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc. Publishers, Sunderland, Massachusetts, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is most easily seen by considering the case of disequilibria caused by mutation:

Consider a population of individuals whose [[genome]] has only two genes, ''a'' and ''b''. If an advantageous mutant (''A'') of gene ''a'' arises in a given individual, that individual's genes will through natural selection become more frequent in the population over time. However, if a separate advantageous mutant (''B'') of gene ''b'' arises before ''A'' has gone to fixation, and happens to arise in an individual who does not carry ''A'', then individuals carrying ''B'' and individuals carrying ''A'' will be in competition. If recombination is present, then individuals carrying both ''A'' and ''B'' (of [[genotype]] ''AB'') will eventually arise. Provided there are no negative [[epistasis|epistatic]] effects of carrying both, individuals of genotype ''AB'' will have a greater selective advantage than ''aB'' or ''Ab'' individuals, and ''AB'' will hence go to fixation.
However, if there is no recombination, ''AB'' individuals can only occur if the latter mutation (''B'') happens to occur in an ''Ab'' individual. The chance of this happening depends on the frequency of new mutations, and on the size of the population, but is in general unlikely unless ''A'' is already fixed, or nearly fixed. Hence one should expect the time between the ''A'' mutation arising and the population becoming fixed for ''AB'' to be much longer in the absence of recombination. Hence recombination allows evolution to progress faster.&lt;ref name=HC/&gt;

[[Joe Felsenstein]] (1974)&lt;ref&gt;Felsenstein, J. 1974 [http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/abstract/78/2/737 The Evolutionary Advantage of Recombination]. ''[[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]]'' 78: 737–756.&lt;/ref&gt; showed this effect to be mathematically identical to the [[Fisher–Muller model]] proposed by [[R. A. Fisher]] (1930)&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, R.A. 1930 ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]''. Clarendon Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[H. J. Muller]] (1932),&lt;ref&gt;Muller, H.J. 1932 Some Genetic Aspects of Sex. ''[[American Naturalist]]'' 66: 118–138.&lt;/ref&gt; although the verbal arguments were substantially different.

A '''humster''' is a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] [[Cell culture|cell line]] made from hamster [[oocyte]] fertilized with human sperm. It always consists of single cells, and cannot form a multi-cellular being.

Humsters are routinely created for mainly two reasons:
* To avoid legal issues with working with pure human [[embryonic stem cell]] lines.
* To assess the viability of human sperm for [[in vitro fertilization]].

Somatic cell hybrids between hamster or mouse and man have been used for mapping of various traits at least since the 1970s.

'''Intellectual movements in Iran''' involve the [[Iran]]ian experience of [[modernity]] and its associated art, science, literature, poetry, and political structures that have been changing since the 19th century.

== History of Iranian modernity ==

Long before the European [[Renaissance]] generated the radical ideas that eventually reshaped Europe and the United States, Persian statesmen, artists, and intellectuals had formulated ideas that strikingly anticipate those of modernity. Since more than thousand years ago there has been a conflict in Persia between the search for modernity and the forces of religious obscurantism.

Some twenty-five hundred years ago, when [[Herodotus]] was writing his ''Histories'', Persia was the West's ultimate ''other''.

It has been a common belief of scholars that modernity began in the West and is by its philosophical nature, economic underpinning, and cultural exigencies a uniquely western phenomenon. All ''other'' cultures, those who have lived on the ''darker side of Renaissance'' must emulate the Western experience, if they want to be modern. From [[Max Weber]] to [[Milan Kundera]], many Western scholars and writers have argued that everything from representative democracy and rational thought to the art of the novel and the essay are not only western in origin but also uniquely suited to its culture, and native to its temperature climes.

[[Persia]] with its impressively rich and varied cultural legacy had a formative role in shaping Western consciousness. The Bible is replete with profuse praise for Persia and its kings. [[The Bible]]'s praise for [[Cyrus the Great]] was partially in recognition of his role in freeing the [[Jews]] from their [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian]] captivity; of equal importance was the fact that the vast [[Persian empire]] of the time was a paragon of religious and cultural tolerance.

[[Hegel]] whose writings are considered by many as the apex of the Western philosophical tradition, uses superlatives in praising the role of Persia and [[Zarathustra]] in history.

Following Hegel in 19th-century Germany, [[Nietzsche]] wrote his magnum opus, ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' that similarly touched upon this key figure of the Persian imagination. Nietzsche's book offers a radical critique, almost a total debunking, of the whole Western tradition of philosophy. It is no mere accident that Nietzsche chose to articulate his critical views in the name of Zarathustra. The end of the 19th century was not the only or the last time Zarathustra played a prominent role in shaping Western consciousness and philosophic discourse. In 1990s Persian influences on the millennial fever, and on other New Age themes, were so strong that [[Harold Bloom]], the eminent American critic, suggested that the last decade of the twentieth century should in truth be called "a return to [[Zoroastrian]] origins."

Western art, no less than history and theology, bear testimony to the ubiquity of the Persian presence in antiquity. Of all the extant works of Greek tragedy, for example, the only one that is about a non-Greek subject is [[Aeschylus]]' play ''[[The Persians]]''.

== Generations of Iranian intellectuals ==
[[File:AmirKabir Sani ol molk 2.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Iranian prime minister, [[Amir Kabir]] by [[Sani ol molk]].]]

===First generation===
The nineteenth century Persian reformers who are considered as the ''first generation of Iranian intellectuals'' were perfectly conscious of the fact that it was not enough to rely upon the antiquity of Persian civilization to think about its continued ability to survive. They tried to establish a relationship with men of power that would have permitted them to dictate their blueprints for reforms. These blueprints naturally remained without immediate impact among the men of power to whom they were addressed. These intellectual reforms encountered a widespread opposition from the court and the Ulama. Abd al-Rahim Talebof, Fath-'Ali Akhoundzadeh, and Sani o Doleh belong to this generation.

===Second generation===
The second generation intended to introduce modern civilization to Persia, not only by imitating the West, but through a coherent and systematic approach to European culture. [[Mohammad-Taqi Bahar]], [[Ali Dashti]], [[Ali Akbar Davar]], [[Mohammad-Ali Foroughi]], [[Sadeq Hedayat]], [[Bozorg Alavi]], [[Ahmad Kasravi]], [[Saeed Nafisi]], [[Hasan Taqizadeh]], [[Abdolhossein Teymourtash]] and [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] belong to this generation.

===Third generation===

The third generation of Iranian intellectuals signify the absorption of Russian Marxism into Iranian political and social thought. With the popularity of [[Marxist ideology]] among the third generation of Iranian intellectuals, the new culture for translation and knowledge of modernity was drawn inevitably toward moral and political absolutes. Intellectuals claimed to be "givers of lessons" and acted as "moral legislators" who were critics of both the state and the society. [[Jalal Al-e-Ahmad]] and [[Ali Shariati]] belong to this generation.

===Fourth generation===
Fourth generation of Iranian intellectuals are mainly characterized by the journals such as ''Goftegu'' and ''Kiyan''. In contrast with the ideological generation of Iranian intellectuals who in their encounter with the western modernity favoured a monistic attitude exemplified by Marxist and [[Martin Heidegger|Heideggerian philosophies]], the Fourth Generation of Iranian intellectuals decided on a move away and a critical distanciation from master ideologies.
The methodological position of the new generation of Iranian intellectuals is characterized by two main philosophical attitudes: the extension of an [[anti-utopia]]n thinking on an intersubjective basis on the one hand, and the urge for a non-imitative dialogical exchange with the modern values of the West on the other.

[[Javad Tabatabaei]] and [[Abdolkarim Soroush]] among many others belong to the fourth generation.

== Modern art movement ==
[[File:Sahabi1.jpg|thumb|left|Sahabi family ([[Ezzatollah Sahabi]], Yadollah and Haleh Sahabi) are symbols of intellectuals who brought politics and ethics together.]]
{{Main|Modern and contemporary art in Iran}}

Iranian experience and development of modernity led to a unique style of cinema, painting and music. Iranian ''New wave'', a movement in [[Cinema of Iran|Iranian cinema]], has found worldwide reputation due to its deeply Philosophical, poetic and artistic style. [[Abbas Kiarostami]] is the most notable figure in the ''New wave'' of Iranian cinema. In the artistic and aesthetic realm, features of New wave of Persian cinema, for example the works of Abbas Kiarostami, can be classified as [[postmodern]].

In his book ''Close Up: Iranian Cinema, Past, Present, Future''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1859843328|title=Close Up: Iranian Cinema, Past, Present, and Future|first=Hamid|last=Dabashi|date=1 November 2001|publisher=Verso|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2001) [[Hamid Dabashi#Close Up: Iranian Cinema|Hamid Dabashi]] describes modern Iranian cinema and the phenomenon of [''Iranian''] national cinema as a form of cultural modernity. According to Dabashi, "the visual possibility of seeing the historical person (as opposed to the eternal Qur'anic man) on screen is arguably the single most important event allowing Iranians access to modernity."

[[Mehdi Saeedi]], is an internationally renowned artist and designer. His aesthetics have become a mainstay of design in many regions, especially in those using the Arabic script as their alphabet. And on November (2009) he won Grand Price for the Five Star Designers at International Invitational Poster Triennial in Osaka, Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osaka-geidai.ac.jp/geidai/tokusyuu/fivestar/outline.html|title=Five Star Designers' Banquet - Outline|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://posterpage.ch/div/news09/n091111a.htm|title=Rene Wanner's Poster Page / News|first=Rene|last=Wanner|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 December 2006, graphic designer, [[Reza Abedini]], received the Principal Award in the [[Prince Claus Awards]] for his way of applying the knowledge and accomplishments of Iran's artistic heritage, renewing them, and making them exciting again. Reza Abedini's Persian Sym style unites the rich calligraphic tradition of Persian culture with "modernity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeclausfund.org/en/what_we_do/awards/AbediniPlatform21.shtml|title=The Visual Language of Reza Abedini|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125030653/http://www.princeclausfund.org/en/what_we_do/awards/AbediniPlatform21.shtml|archive-date=2007-01-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that [[Ebrahim Golestan]], [[Fereydoon Rahnama]] and [[Farrokh Ghaffari]] founded Iran's "different" cinematic style and Iranian intellectual movement in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/arts/story/2006/12/061217_pm-farrokh-ghaffari.shtml|title=BBCPersian.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marcos Grigorian]] and [[Hossein Zenderoudi]] were pioneers of Iranian modern [[painting]] and [[Sculpture]].

==Modern and contemporary architecture movement==
Although the new era in Iranian architecture began with the rise of [[Safavid dynasty]], (1501 - 1736), in fact, it is in the early decades of the twentieth century that the first generation of modern Iranian architects, almost like every generation of modern architects in the world, appears as being influenced by the Modern Movement and rationalism in architecture. Architects such as [[Vartan Hovanesian]], Ali Sadegh, Mohsen Foroughi, Paul Akbar, [[Gabriel Guevrekian]], [[Heydar Ghiai]], [[Abdol-Aziz Mirza Farmanfarmaian|Abdolaziz Farmanfarmaian]] and [[Hooshang Seyhoun]] are examples of this movement.
Later, in the mid-1960s, Ali Sardar Afkhami, [[Kamran Diba]] and [[Nader Ardalan]] are among those Iranian architects who have opened their design approach to the history and traditions to represent a trend of Iranian [[Post-Modernism]].
Attention for the new trends in international architecture, is being carried out by Iranian architects, even after the Islamic Revolution. Like most architectural milieu of the world, in the 1980s the experiments on the transition from post-modernism to new developments, has influenced many Iranians architects, in architects such as [[Reza Daneshmir]], [[Farhad Ahmadi]], and [[Iranian architecture|Darab Diba]].
In this context, It is of interest the attempt by some architects like [[Abbas Gharib]] or [[Bahram Shirdel]] to go in deep within the most advanced theory and trends in contemporary and [[Post-contemporary]] architecture, such as the theory of [[Complex system]]s in architecture in the case of [[Abbas Gharib|Gharib]] and [[folding Theory]] in the case of [[Bahram Shirdel|Shirdel]]. These experiments are valid methods and contribution to liberate architecture and design, from abstraction, flatness, stiffness, forced rectangular and [[Heterotopia (space)|Heterotopia]] of the modernist spaces for a more fluid, flexible, soft and dynamic architecture, open to the complexities of its environment and context

==Music movement==
Simultaneous with the constitutional revolution in Iran, young musicians sought new forms of music to synchronize with the tide of social changes. In 1937, Tehran's Symphonic Orchestra started working and performing western as well as Iranian music.
The 1979 revolution launched a renaissance in [[Persian traditional music|Persian classical music]]. The emergence of three ensembles, the [[Aref Ensemble]], the [[Sheyda Ensemble]] and the [[Masters of Persian Music]] revolutionized [[Iranian music]] during the late 20th century and at the turn of the millennium.
New figures emerged in [[Persian Symphonic Music]], and several symphony orchestras started their work despite a lack of support from national governments or international bodies. The new wave can be characterized by growing interest in using both Iranian and European instruments and musical genres. Perhaps the best examples are the [[Melal Orchestra]] and the [[National Iranian Symphony Orchestra]].

Folk music also enjoyed the emergence of figures such as [[Sima Bina]] and [[Bijan Kamkar|Kamkar]]. These musicians introduced Iranian folk music ([[greater Khorasan|Khorasani]], [[Kurdish music|Kurdish]], [[Bandari music|Bandari]], [[Mazandaran]]i music, among others) to the international community by organizing numerous concerts worldwide.

== Modern poetry ==

Literary criticism and comparative literature in Iran entered a new phase in the 19th century. [[Persian literature]] enjoyed the emergence of influential figures as [[Sadeq Hedayat]], [[Ahmad Kasravi]], [[Abdolhossein Zarrinkoub]], [[Shahrokh Meskoob]], [[Ebrahim Golestan]] and [[Sadegh Choubak]].

==Modern scientific movement==
[[File:Mohammad-Nabi Sarbolouki.JPG|thumb|left|[[Mohammad-Nabi Sarbolouki]], an influential figure in science policy making, prominent scientist and one of the pioneers of biotechnology and biomaterial research in Iran&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:SCIE.0000037364.65282.4d|title=Basic science in the Islamic Republic of Iran|first1=Morteza|last1=Mehrdad|first2=Akbar|last2=Heydari|first3=Mohammad Nabi|last3=Sarbolouki|first4=Shapour|last4=Etemad|publisher=|journal=Scientometrics|volume=61|issue=1|pages=79–80|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1023/B:SCIE.0000037364.65282.4d}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{main|Science in Iran}}

The history of modern science in Iran dates back to the year 1851 and the establishment of [[Dar ul-Funun (Persia)|Darolfonoon]] – which was founded as a result of the efforts of [[Amir Kabir|Mirza Taghi Khan Amir Kabir]], aiming at training and teaching Iranian experts on many fields of sciences, and it was the future minded [[Abbas Mirza]] who first dispatched students to Europe to obtain a western education.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Clawson]] and [[Michael Rubin (historian)|Michael Rubin]]. ''Eternal Iran''. Palgrave Macmillan. 2005. {{ISBN|1-4039-6276-6}} p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

By the establishment of Tehran University, science in Iran entered a new phase. [[Mahmoud Hessaby]], [[Ali Asghar Hekmat]], [[Moslem Bahadori]] and many others played roles in initiating and forming these movements. The outcome of the movement has been the emergence of researchers who have been trained and received doctorate degrees in the country and have found international reputations.
Modernization of Iranian medicine did not occur through the straightforward replacement of traditional Persian medicine by modern European medicine. Rather, the integration of modern medicine went through a long process that included both the reinterpretation of traditional theories by traditional physicians and the assimilation of modern theories through the prism of traditional medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iias.nl/iiasn/31/IIASN31_20.pdf|title=The Newsletter 31 Summer 2003|first=|last=IIAS|date=16 November 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main Iranian scientific movements in the late 20th century was in the field of [[chemistry]] and pharmaceutical chemistry. The main leaders of this movement were [[Abbas Shafiee]], Bijan Farzami, [[Mohammad-Nabi Sarbolouki]], Issa Yavari and [[Ahmad Reza Dehpour]]. The movement resulted in hundreds of research papers in peer reviewed international journals.

Other notable figures who promoted world-class research in Iran during the 20th century are: [[Reza Mansouri]] and Yousof Sobouti (Physics), Abolhassan Farhoudi (Immunology), [[Mohammad Reza Zarrindast]] (Pharmacology), [[Fereydoun Davatchi]] (Rheumatology), Taher Movassaghian (Chemistry), Ardeshir Ghavamzadeh (Hematology), Ali Radmehr (Radiology), [[Hossein Najmabadi]] (Medical genetics), Hormoz Shams (Ophthalmology), [[Moslem Bahadori]] (Pathology), Hormoz Dabirashrafi (Obstetrics and Gynecology), Hossein Esteky (Neuroscience),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visionlab.ir/|title=Research Laboratory for Brain and Cognitive Sciences|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; G.R. Baradaran Khosroshahi (Mathematics), [[Caro Lucas]] (Electrical Engg., AI), [[Jawad Salehi]] (Electrical Engg.) and Ali Kaveh (Civil Engg.).

Iran's university population has swelled from 100,000 in 1979 to 2 million in 2006. Indeed, in Iran some 70% of science and engineering students are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7115/full/444022a.html|title=Islam and Science: An Islamist revolution|first=Ehsan|last=Masood|date=2 November 2006|publisher=|journal=Nature|volume=444|issue=7115|pages=22–25|via=www.nature.com|doi=10.1038/444022a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran is now a world leader in some areas like [[string theory]]. When a reporter for ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' asked [[Reza Mansouri]]: "Why do I see so many string theory papers coming out of Iran?" He explained how Iranian scientists worked together under revolution, sanctions and war to bring Iran to such a position: "I remember exactly the beginning of the revolution, some old colleagues just sat together and spoke about what we could do for Iran. Is it understood that we have to look for excellence, in some areas that we may be strong and that we may get strong at that so that will be the field of physics. So we began with that. It happens that the most active field physicists in our country were working on the string theory at that time. So they tried to be of a school, so to speak, and we did know that that was the only way which was somehow independent of all these political fluctuations regarding war, regarding cultural revolution, all that, and we really tried hard to build up schools. So we have it now, string schools, so to say somehow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/podcast/v443/n7110/nature-2006-09-28.html|title=: Nature|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 [[United Nations]] awarded [[Hossein Malek-Afzali]] with the prestigious UN Population Award. Malek Afzali has helped design strategies to improve health procedures, particularly adolescent health, reproductive health and family planning. In the field of reproductive health, he has engaged policymakers and religious leaders in the planning and implementation of reproductive health programmes in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=22424&amp;Cr=population&amp;Cr1=|title=UN News - Four laureates awarded UN Population Fund’s highest honour|first=United Nations News Service|last=Section|date=2 May 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iranian women's movement ==

{{Main|Iranian women's movement}}

Currently women's rights groups are among the most active social rights groups in Iran and are mostly involved in an effort to gain equal rights for women in the Iranian legal system by opposing specific discriminatory laws. However, under the Presidential regime of [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], elected President in 2005, women's rights advocates have been beaten, jailed and persecuted.&lt;ref name=HRW2&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/09/18/iran19845.htm UN: Hold Ahmadinejad Accountable for Iran Rights Crisis], [[Human Rights Watch]], September 18, 2008; accessed September 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sun&gt;[http://www.nysun.com/new-york/iranian-dissidents-at-forum-speak-on-ahmadinejad/64730/ Iranian Dissidents at Forum Speak On Ahmadinejad, Women's Rights], ''[[New York Sun]]'', Special to the Sun, October 17, 2007; accessed September 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-fg-marriage3-2008sep03,0,5861662.story victory on marriage legislation], Borzou Daragahi, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', September 3, 2008; accessed September 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of [[Iranian woman|women]] in Iranian intellectual movements (science, modern literature, cinema, human-rights activism, etc.) has been remarkable throughout the history of modern Iran. According to the research ministry of Iran, women accounted for 56% of all university students in the natural sciences, including one in five Ph.D. students. Such education and social trends are increasingly viewed with alarm by the Iranian government.&lt;ref name=BBCed&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5359672.stm Women graduates challenge Iran], Francis Harrison, [[BBC]], September 26, 2006; accessed September 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VOE&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1079460.html Iran: Does Government Fear Educated Women?], [[Iraj Gorgin]], [[Radio Free Europe]], February 10, 2008; accessed September 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In cinema and the visual arts, [[Shirin Neshat]], [[Tahmineh Milani]], [[Rakhshan Bani Etemad]], and [[Samira Makhmalbaf]] created new cinematic styles which have attracted many from all over the world and in international festivals.
Persian poet and literary figure [[Simin Behbahani]] was nominated for 1997 Nobel Prize for literature. The 2003 Nobel Peace Prize went to [[Shirin Ebadi]] for her efforts for democracy and human rights, especially for the rights of women and children.
[[Simin Daneshvar]]'s ''Savushun'' is a novel about the Iranian experience of modernity during the 20th century.

Iranian writer and satirist, [[Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi]] was perhaps the first professional female satirist, critic and one of the notable figures involved in Persian constitutional revolution.
In the early 20th century, Persian music enjoyed the emergence of [[Qamar ol-Molouk Vaziri]], the "Lady of Iranian music".

===Persian constitutional revolution===
Iran had undergone a phenomenal constitutional revolution at the turn of the twentieth century. The [[Persian Constitutional Revolution|constitutional movement]] was concerned with modernity and human rights. It led to the establishment of a [[parliament]] in Iran. Mirza Jahangir-Khan Shirazi and [[Mirza Mohammad Farrokhi Yazdi|Farrokhi Yazdi]] were among the most notable writers and critics of this era who sacrificed their lives for establishment of democracy and freedom in Iran.

=== Iranian Revolution ===
Some researchers believe that the [[Iranian Revolution]] was not a simple clash between modernity and tradition but an attempt to accommodate modernity within a sense of authentic Islamic identity, culture and historical experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521650003|title=Intellectual Discourse and the Politics of Modernization - Cambridge University Press|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Amir_Hossein_Aryanpour.jpg|frame|Amir Hossein Aryanpour.]] --&gt;
Perceived by many as a revolt against the secular modernity of the West, Iranian revolution was welcomed by some Western thinkers as a triumph of spiritual values over the profane world of capitalist materialism. For others the Iranian revolution was a protest against the very political rationality of the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iranproject.info/|title=オリックス銀行カードローンを利用したときの体験談|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2nd of Khordad movement ===
{{Main|2nd of Khordad Movement}}

The election of the former President [[Mohammad Khatami]] in May 1997 was through the emergence of a new political force, the youth. Inspired by simultaneously individualist and democratic ideals that are incompatible in every respect with the authoritarian values and symbols traditionally associated in the Iranian intellectual arena with Marxist and Heideggerian World views. It is in this new social atmosphere that the emergence of a global community or a cyberpolis was able to reveal to the Iranian youth the true nature of instrumental rationality as modern universal standards. [[Saeed Hajjarian]] was widely believed to be the main strategist behind the 1997 reform movement of Iran. He allegedly showed the supremacy of politics as such over any religious norm when he said that the survival of the Islamic Republic was paramount and that no religious ritual should stand in its way. This kind of decision, he states, means that politics are more important than religion and that this acknowledges the [[secularization]] of religion. In this context, he argues, it is possible to reassess [[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists|velayat faqih]] and to reject its supremacy within the political field in Iran. While calling to build a new reform movement, Hajjarian believes that the reform movement started in 1997, died during Khatami's second term. He believes that the reform project started by Persian constitutional revolution, has not been completed yet.''(ref: Farhad Khosrokhavar, The New Intellectuals in Iran, Social Compass, Vol. 51, No. 2, 191-202 (2004))''

The scope of 2nd of Khordad movement was much broader than President Khatami's reform plan. The latter has been criticised for wanting slow progress and not producing a real democratic alternative for the current Islamic republic. When asked about this during Khatami's visit to United Kingdom, he said "You know for centuries we have been under dictatorship so we cannot get to a democracy all of a sudden, we have to go step by step"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chathamhouse.org.uk/pdf/meeting_transcripts/011106khatami.pdf|title=''Tolerance, Moderation and the Dialogue of Civilizations''|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210053259/http://www.chathamhouse.org.uk/pdf/meeting_transcripts/011106khatami.pdf|archive-date=2006-12-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Campaigns against intellectuals ===
After the [[Iranian Revolution]], the [[Iran's Cultural Revolution of 1980-1987|Cultural Revolution]] and the [[Chain murders of Iran]] were two major campaigns that involved the imprisonment, torture, emigration, and massacre of Iranian scholars.

==Intellectual circles in late 20th century==
Intellectual circles in postrevolutionary Iran can be classified into the following categories:

=== Revolutionary intellectual circles ===
The main figures in this category are [[Ali Shariati]], [[Jalal Al Ahmad]] and [[Morteza Motahhari]]. [[Morteza Motahhari]] was the main theorist and thinker behind Iranian revolution. He is considered to be one of the most influential philosophical leaders of pre-revolutionary Iran and the impact and popularity of his thought continues to be felt throughout Iranian society many years later.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

=== Reformist intellectual circles ===
[[File:BazarganMehdi.jpg|thumb|Iranian scholar [[Mehdi Bazargan]] was an advocate of democracy and civil rights. He also opposed the cultural revolution and US embassy takeover.]]

Main figures in this category are [[Mehdi Bazargan]], [[Abdolkarim Soroush]], [[Mohammad Mojtahed Shabestari]], [[Mostafa Malekian]], [[Mohsen Kadivar]], [[Alireza Alavitabar]] and [[Hossein Bashiriyeh]].

The unifying traits of these intellectuals include their recognition of reform in the Islamic thought, democracy, civil society and religious pluralism and their opposition to the absolute supremacy of the [[Faqih]]. The rise of religious intellectuals can be followed through the writings of Abdolkarim Soroosh. Soroosh's main idea is that there are perennial unchanging religious truths, but our understanding of them remains contingent on our knowledge in the fields of science and philosophy. Unlike Ali Shariati, who turned to Marxism to bring a historicist perspective to the Shiite thought, Soroosh debates the relation between democracy and religion and discusses the possibility of what he calls ''religious democracy''.

Influenced by Persian mysticism, Soroush advocated a type of reformist Islam that went beyond most liberal Muslim thinkers of the 20th century and argued that the search for reconciliation of Islam and democracy was not a matter of simply finding appropriate phrases in the Qur'an that were in agreement with modern science, democracy, or human rights. Drawing on the works of [[Rumi|Molana Jalaleddin Balkhi]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[G.W.F. Hegel]], [[Karl Popper]], and [[Erich Fromm]], Soroush called for a reexamination of all tenets of Islam, insisting on the need to maintain the religion's original spirit of social justice and its emphasis on caring for other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-230083 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-04-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229085806/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-230083 |archive-date=2007-12-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other influential figures in these circles are [[Saeed Hajjarian]], [[Ahmad Sadri]], [[Mahmoud Sadri]], [[Ezzatollah Sahabi]], [[Ahmad Ghabel]] and [[Hassan Yousefi Eshkevari]]. [[Akbar Ganji]] had also been associated with this circle before he published his ''Manifest of Republicanism''. Moreover, Akbar Ganji took a tour around the world in order to invite non Iranian intellectuals to join Iran's intellectual movement. Many Persian scholars believe that such interactions with world scholars would promote Iranian intellectualism and democratic reform. [[Richard Rorty]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Anthony Giddens]], David Hild, [[Shmuel Noah Eisenstadt]] among a few others accepted the honorary membership of Iranian intellectual society.

Perhaps the most important achievement of this circle was training a new generation of Iranian intellectuals who are far ahead of their mentors and do not belong to any of well-established intellectual circles in Iran. [[Ahmad Zeidabadi]] and [[Mehdi Jami]] belong to this new generation of Persian scholars.

===Democratic religious circles (In-system reformers)===
[[File:Reza Abedini.jpg|right|thumb|[[Reza Abedini]]]]
These groups are characterized by the followings:
*Support for Islamic republic as the best [[form of government]]
*Calling for Religious tolerance
*Calling for democratic values
*Rejecting [[liberalism]]
*Rejecting [[secularism]]
*Calling for the rule of law and [[civil society]]
*They believe that [[ethics]] has priority over [[politics]].

The main thinker and theorist of this circle is [[Mohammad Khatami]], former president of Iran. Other notable figures include [[Yousef Sanei]], [[Abdollah Noori]], [[Mir Hossein Mousavi]] and [[Mostafa Moin]]. They are mainly under the influence of ideas of Ayatollah Mirza Hossein Na'eeni and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.

=== Neo-conservative intellectual circles ===
Unlike the reformist intellectuals, the neo- conservative intellectuals in Iran are in favor of the supremacy of the Leader and against concepts such as democracy, civil society and pluralism. This movement includes figures such as [[Reza Davari Ardakani]], [[Javad Larijani]] and [[Mehdi Golshani]]. The famous personality among these is Reza Davari Ardakani, who as an anti- Western philosopher is very familiar with the works of [[Martin Heidegger]]. Davari, unlike Soroosh, takes some of the features of Heidegger's thought, mainly the critic of modernity and puts it into an Islamic wording. He rejects the Western model of democracy, which is based on the separation of politics and religion.

=== Non-religious intellectual circles ===
Main figures in this category are [[Javad Tabatabaei]], [[Dariush Shayegan]], [[Amir Hossein Aryanpour]], [[Ramin Jahanbegloo]], [[Ehsan Naraghi]], [[Khosro Naghed]], [[Abbas Milani]], and [[Aramesh Doustdar]].

Javad Tabtabaei deplores the deep roots of religion in the Iranian culture. For Tabatabai, the decline of the Iranian political thought goes back to the 9th and 10th centuries and, since then, it has been impossible for them to adequately understand the modernity. The social sciences, according to him, have been introduced in Iran without the secularization of thought and its rationalization and therefore, they reproduce in an unconscious way the ancient prejudices and the inability to think adequately.
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Shahrokh Meskoob.jpg|frame|Shahrokh Meskoob. {{Deletable image-caption|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt;
Dariush Shayegan criticizes a view of religion that does not take into account the major trends of the modern world where cultural homogeneity and religious absolutism are questioned. The quest for a holistic identity based on a monolithic view of Islam is alien to the evolution of modern world and means the isolation and regression of the (Iranian) society.

Dariush Shayegan, who writes mainly in French (but has been extensively translated into Persian), shares some of the views of these particular intellectuals, but his major contribution is to invite Iranians to accept the ‘‘fragmented identity’’ of the modern world and to renounce a unitary view of the Self which leads to a fascination with utopian and mythological ideologies. He insists that, since Iran has undergone the change directly from tradition to postmodernity without the mediation of modernity, it is experiencing a strong malaise. His solution is to open up Iran to the new multicultural world in which one has to accept the diversity of the perspectives and, therefore, to be tolerant towards others who do not think and behave in the same way as the Self. This invitation to become open-minded and to give up the idea of a homogeneous culture exerts an undeniable influence on many young people in Iran.

=== Traditional scholars ===
The most notable circle was associated with [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr|Hossein Nasr]], founder of [[Imperial Iranian Academy of Philosophy]]. For Nasr, the traditional world was pervaded by a tremendous sense of the Sacred and the Absolute, whereas the inception of modernity involved precisely the severing off of that awareness, resulting in what Max Weber would later dub the ''disenchantment of the world.''
Nasr has been an unrelenting opponent of Islamic fundamentalism in all its forms throughout his career because he sees it as a somewhat vigilante reactionary movement operating within the paradigm of the modern nation state, but even more so, because it lacks a well thought out metaphysical basis rooted in a traditional Muslim understanding of the world which respects both nature and human dignity.

=== Other notable figures ===
[[File:MoslemBahadori.jpg|thumb|Prof [[Moslem Bahadori]], one of the pioneering figures in modern Iranian medicine]]

== Philosophy education in Iran ==
[[File:Hoseiniyeh Ershad.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hoseiniyeh Ershad]], where [[Ali Shariati]] used to hold many of his speeches.]]

Philosophy has become a popular subject of study during last few decades in Iran. Comparing the number of philosophy books currently published in Iran with that in other countries, Iran possibly ranks first in this field but it is definitely on top in terms of publishing philosophy books. Currently different approaches are working in a diverging fields of philosophy:
* 1. Traditional Persian Islamic philosophy. traditional classic philosophy revived after a period of silence, in Tehran School, and notably works of Agha Ali Modarres Zonoozi in the early 20th century, after him both schools of Tehran and Ghom (with the works of Allameh Tabatabai and Imam Ruhollah Khomayni) activated philosophical debates. Nowaday, Islamic philosophy is the most fresh period all over the world in Iran all the way after Sfavid school of Isfahan. The most notable figures of our time include Allameh Hossein tabatabaii, Allameh Rafiai Gazvini, Mehdi Hayeri Yazdi, Falatouri, Hasan zadeh Amoli, Morteza Motahhari, Abolhasan Jelveh, Mohammad tagi Amoli, allameh hossein Gharavi Isfahani (kompani), Ibrahim Ashtiyani, Jalaloddin Ashtiyani, Kazem assar.
* 2. Western philosophy. The Western philosophy is mostly welcome to Iran in the 19th century, but its full development began in the 1970s, with the reactive movement against the left political thought of Soviet sect of ''Toodeh'' party, most notably by refutation of their Marxist–Leninist works (typically in Tagi Arani's works). The leading figures include Allameh Tabatabai, and his pupil [[Morteza Motahhari]]. Also [[Ahmad Fardid]] and his Circle who introduced [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and very specifically [[Martin Heidegger]] to Iranian Academia. His pupils like Reza Davari, [[Dariush Shayegan]] who are now among famous Iranian philosophers developed his way to interpret modern conditions in Iran. Today the most dominant branch of Western philosophy in Iranian academia is Continental philosophy; The domination of the department of philosophy of the [[University of Tehran]] over the teaching of philosophy with laying on Islamic philosophy and Continental philosophy put it ahead of philosophy education in Iran. Department of philosophy of the University of Tehran traditionally is the top place of the greatest philosophers in secular education system in Iran; among the philosophers of the University of Tehran to be named are [[Reza Davari]], [[Ebrahimi Dinani]], and [[Mahmoud Khatami]] whose influences are clear all over students of philosophy. Reza Davari who is a philosopher with great debates on Modern condition, intellectualism and enlightenment ranked as the leading Persian philosopher with anti-Western approach. His ideas challenge the defender of Western culture and notably the defender of analytical philosophy and scienticism. Dinani is a defender of Islamic philosophy who also talks about the west; Mahmoud khtami, who is commonly considered as a phenomenologist, is ranked as a totally scholar with no political sign who teaches analytical and continental philosophies in the university, but he has developed a different philosophy of his own that is called [''Ontetics''].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://fieldofphilosophy.webs.com/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816041427/http://fieldofphilosophy.webs.com/ |archive-date=2011-08-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, analytical philosophy is also introduced in Iran in the 1970s by the translations from British Empiricism, and then, in 1980 to the present an increasing interest is in students of philosophy to learn more from this 20th-century branch of philosophy. Very specifically, analytic philosophy of science and social science, and [[moral philosophy]] introduced by Abdolkarim Soroush in the early 1980s, and followed by others. [[Philosophy of mind]] introduced to Iranian academia by Mahmoud Khatami, and [[philosophy of logic]] and [[philosophy of language]] introduced by Hamid Vahid Dastgerdi. [[Philosophy of religion]] is also most welcome branch with the Iranian scholars.
* 3. Comparative philosophy is a tendency in Iranian scholarship.
* 4. Traditionalist (sonnatgera)is also an approach introduced by [[Hossein Nasr]].

'''James McCosh''' (April 1, 1811 &amp;ndash; November 16, 1894) was a prominent philosopher of the [[Scottish School of Common Sense]]. He was president of [[Princeton University]] 1868-1888.

==Biography==

[[File:McCosh 50 (front).jpg|thumb|left|A lecture room in McCosh Hall at Princeton University]]

McCosh was born of a [[Covenanter|Covenanting]] family in [[Ayrshire]], and studied at the Universities of [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]] and [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], obtaining his M.A. at the latter, at the suggestion of Sir [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]], for an essay on [[stoicism]]. He became a minister of the Established [[Church of Scotland]] in 1834, serving as pastor first at [[Arbroath]] and then at [[Brechin]].  He sided with the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] in the [[Disruption of 1843]], becoming minister at Brechin's new East Free Church. In 1850 or 1851 he was appointed Professor of [[Logic]] and [[Metaphysics]] at [[Queen's University Belfast|Queen's College, Belfast]] (now [[Queen's University Belfast]]).&lt;ref&gt;See Hoeveler, ''James McCosh and the Scottish Intellectual Tradition: From Glasgow to Princeton.'' (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868 he travelled to the United States to become president of the College of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]). He resigned the presidency in 1888, but continued to teach philosophy until his death. McCosh Hall (home of the English department) and a cross-campus walkway are named in his honor. The campus infirmary is named after his wife, Isabella McCosh. A school on the South Side of Chicago was named after him, but has since been renamed the [[Emmett Louis Till]] Math &amp; Science Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cps.k12.il.us/AboutCPS/Board/Board_Actions/FY05/11/05-1116-MS1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530034937/http://www.cps.k12.il.us/AboutCPS/Board/Board_Actions/FY05/11/05-1116-MS1.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==
McCosh's position was mainly in the tradition of [[Thomas Reid]] and other Scottish common-sense philosophers.  He denied that our beliefs about the nature of the external world rest on causal or other inferences from perceptual ideas, but held that they are the direct accompaniments of sensation, and thus not open to question.  He also argued for the ''a priori'' nature of fundamental principles such as those of [[causality]] and [[morality]].   Our judgements and other cognitions are regulated by such principles, though that is not to say that everyone is aware of them; they can be reached through reflection on our experience, when they are recognised as self-evidently necessary. In his moral theory, especially, McCosh differed from many of his contemporaries in being relatively uninfluenced by Kant.&lt;ref&gt;See Hoeveler, ''James McCosh and the Scottish Intellectual Tradition: From Glasgow to Princeton.'' (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
McCosh's most original work concerned the attempt to reconcile [[evolution]] and Christianity. In 1874, [[Charles Hodge]], the theologian and intellectual leader at the Presbyterian Seminary in Princeton,  published ''What is Darwinism?'', claiming that [[Darwinism]], was, in essence, atheism. To Hodge, Darwinism was contrary to the notion of design and was therefore clearly atheistic. Hodge's views determined the position of the Seminary until his death in 1878. Hodge simply refused to accept that natural laws alone could create complex organisms that fit into their niches so perfectly and that evolution could explain origins. While he didn't consider all evolutionary ideas to be in conflict with his religion, he was concerned with its teaching in colleges. Meanwhile at the college across town (a totally separate institution) President John Maclean also rejected Darwin's theory of evolution. However in 1868, McCosh became president at the college. McCosh realized that much of Darwinism could and would be proved sound, and so he strove to prepare Christians for this event. Instead of conflict between science and religion, McCosh sought reconciliation. Insisting on the principle of design in nature, McCosh interpreted the Darwinian discoveries as more evidence of the prearrangement, skill, and purpose in the universe. He thus demonstrated that Darwinism was not atheistic nor in irreconcilable hostility to the Bible. McCosh thus argued that evolution, far from being inconsistent with belief in [[Teleological argument|divine design]], glorifies the divine designer (see for example his ''Christianity and Positivism''). This aspect of his work found popularity among most Presbyterians clergy, who found his arguments useful in their attempts to cope with scientific philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Hoeveler, ''James McCosh and the Scottish Intellectual Tradition: From Glasgow to Princeton.'' (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Presbyterians in America thus could choose between two schools of thought on evolution, both based in Princeton. The Seminary held to Hodge's position until his supporters were ousted in 1929, and the college ([[Princeton University]]) became a world class center of the new science of evolutionary biology.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph E. Illick, "The Reception of Darwinism at the Theological Seminary and the College at Princeton, New Jersey. Part I: The Theological Seminary," ''Journal of the Presbyterian Historical Society,'' (1960), Vol. 38 Issue 3, pp 152-165; Part 2, (1960), Vol. 38 Issue 4, pp 234-243&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate between McCosh as president of the college and [[Charles Hodge]], head of Princeton Seminary, during the late 1860s and 1870s exemplified the classic conflict between science and religion over the question of Darwin's evolution theory. McCosh offered the first public endorsement of evolution by an American religious leader. However, the two men showed greater similarities regarding matters of science and religion than popularly appreciated. Both supported the increasing role of scientific inquiry in natural history and resisted its intrusion into philosophy and religion. The debate vitalized the college.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley J.Gundlach, "McCosh and Hodge on Evolution: A Combined Legacy," ''Journal of Presbyterian History'' 1997 75(2): 85-102,&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Demoncritus Reviviscens title page.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''Democritus reviviscens'' (1646).]]
He joined the medical faculty at the [[University of Pavia]], where he published his scientific work ''Democritus reviviscens'' in 1646.
He cited [[Daniel Sennert]], but his ideas were distinct from Sennert's and those of Democritus. He considered that atoms were the indivisible parts of three of the [[classical elements]]: earth, water and fire.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Garber, Michael Ayers (editors), ''The Cambridge History of Seventeenth-century Philosophy'', Volume 1 (2003), p. 556; [https://books.google.com/books?id=BPlkkgIhUXIC&amp;pg=PA556 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

His other writings include ''De tabaco'' (1648), on  medical usage and effects of [[tobacco]], and ''De manna liber singularis'' (1648). He apparently prescribed tobacco syrup as a standard remedy for his patients.

'''John Burnheim''' (born in 1927 in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]])&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, Keith. "[http://equalitybylot.wordpress.com/2011/06/30/john-burnheim-to-reason-why/ John Burnheim: To Reason Why]" at Equality by Lot (Wordpress) blog, 30 June 2011. (It will be seen that John Burnheim is a respondent to the blog.) Accessed 24 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; is a former [[professor]] of General [[Philosophy]] at the [[University of Sydney]], [[Australia]].

==Early career== 
Burnheim was formerly a [[Roman Catholic]] [[priest]]&lt;ref name="stove"&gt;Stove D. "[http://www.sydneyline.com/Farewel%20to%20Arts.htm A Farewell to Arts]"{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126040557/http://sydneyline.com/Farewel%20to%20Arts.htm |date=26 November 2009 }} from ''Quadrant'' May 1986, reproduced by Keith Windschuttle at The Sydney Line&lt;/ref&gt; and, from 1958-1968, was rector of [[St John's College, University of Sydney#Rectors.5B12.5D|St John's]], the Catholic college attached to the university. He became a major figure in the disturbances of the 1970s that split the university's Department of Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin J. "[http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/sydq.html The Sydney philosophy disturbances]". ''Quadrant'' 43 (4) (Apr 1999), 16-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social theory==
In his book ''[[Is Democracy Possible? The alternative to electoral politics]]'' (1985) Burnheim used the term "[[demarchy]]" (created by [[Friedrich Hayek]] in his [[Law, Legislation and Liberty]]) to describe a political system without the [[Sovereign state|state]] or bureaucracies, and based instead on randomly selected groups of decision makers. This has striking resemblances to classical democratic ideas, as reported by [[Thucydides]]. In 2006 Burnheim published a second edition with a new preface in which he directed the reader to an emphasis that "a polity organised by negotiation between specialised authorities would work much better than one based on centralised authority".&lt;ref name=burnpref &gt;Burnheim J. "Is Democracy Possible?" [http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/pubotbin/toccer-new?id=burisde.xml&amp;data=/usr/ot/&amp;tag=democracy&amp;part=front Preface to the second edition]. At SETIS (Sydney University) (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Demarchy as Burnheim conceives it has two features that distinguish it from other proposals for selection by lot in politics:

*First, an insistence on putting distinct policy areas under mutually independent authorities which would settle problems of coordination  between them by negotiation or arbitration rather than by dictation from above. The point of this is to remedy the defect of existing democracies in which issues are settled according to the power strategies of politicians rather than the merits of the case;

*Second, that the committee in charge of each policy body should be statistically representative of those who are most substantially affected by their decisions. The hope is that this would lead to better decisions, not just the wishful thinking of populist spin.

In 2016 John Burnheim published "The Demarchy Manifesto: for better public policy."  Where  ''Is Democracy Possible'' is theoretical, the manifesto suggests a practical approach to current problems, aimed at divorcing the process of "enlightening, articulating and giving effect to public opinion" on selected issues of policy from the electoral party system. It envisaged setting up a public foundation, financed by private contributions, to conduct the proceedings, relying on the complete transparency and participatory amplitude of it proceedings to justify its claim to articulate a view that deserved to be seen as serious public opinion on a range of important matters. The key to complete openness is a website to which anybody who chooses to do so may contribute, dedicated to deciding the best way of dealing with a specific problem. Contributors would be expected to appeal to considerations that most people would accept as directly relevant to the particular problem. The editors would attempt to see that all the considerations that either ordinary people or experts might have were thoroughly debated, establishing the considerations a good solution should take into account. That discussion should lead to clarity about just what facts and values are relevant, but still leave a lot of disagreement about the relative weight placed on them in articulating an acceptable decision. A second small body would be charged with attempting to arrive at a practical compromise between conflicting considerations. The suggestion is that this should be a small committee, statistically representative of the interests most strongly advantaged or disadvantaged by what is to be decided. This body would also operate entirely by correspondence online, open to comment at every stage.

The book tries to tie this proposal up with a realistic approach to the more general issues of public goods, practical uncertainty, social processes and global problems.

'''John Stuart Mill''' (20 May 1806 – 8 May 1873), usually cited as '''J. S. Mill''', was a British philosopher, political economist, and civil servant. One of the most influential thinkers in the history of [[Classical liberalism|liberalism]], he contributed widely to [[social theory]], [[political theory]], and [[political economy]]. Dubbed "the most influential English-speaking philosopher of the nineteenth century",&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/mill/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Christopher|last=Macleod|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=14 November 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mill's conception of [[liberty]] justified the freedom of the individual in opposition to unlimited state and social control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=John Stuart Mill's ''On Liberty'' |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/philosophy/mill/liberty.html |publisher=victorianweb |accessdate=23 July 2009 |quote=On Liberty is a rational justification of the freedom of the individual in opposition to the claims of the state to impose unlimited control and is thus a defense of the rights of the individual against the state.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mill was a proponent of [[utilitarianism]], an ethical theory developed by his predecessor [[Jeremy Bentham]]. He contributed to the investigation of [[scientific method]]ology, though his knowledge of the topic was based on the writings of others, notably [[William Whewell]], [[John Herschel]], and [[Auguste Comte]], and research carried out for Mill by [[Alexander Bain]]. Mill engaged in written debate with Whewell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/#SciMet |title=John Stuart Mill (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=31 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
John Stuart Mill was born at 13 Rodney Street in [[Pentonville]], [[Middlesex]], the eldest son of the Scottish philosopher, historian and economist [[James Mill]], and Harriet Barrow. John Stuart was educated by his father, with the advice and assistance of [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[Francis Place]]. He was given an extremely rigorous upbringing, and was deliberately shielded from association with children his own age other than his siblings. His father, a follower of Bentham and an adherent of [[associationism]], had as his explicit aim to create a [[genius]] intellect that would carry on the cause of [[utilitarianism]] and its implementation after he and Bentham had died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Halevy |first=Elie |title=The Growth of Philosophic Radicalism |year=1966 |publisher=Beacon Press |isbn=978-0191010200 |pages=282–284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mill was a notably precocious child. He describes his education in his autobiography. At the age of three he was taught [[Ancient Greek|Greek]].&lt;ref name="digital.library.cornell.edu"&gt;[http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=nwng;cc=nwng;rgn=full%20text;idno=nwng0033-4;didno=nwng0033-4;view=image;seq=620;node=nwng0033-4:1;page=root;size=s;frm=frameset Journals: New Englander (1843–1892)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of eight, he had read ''[[Aesop's Fables]]'', [[Xenophon]]'s ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'',&lt;ref name="digital.library.cornell.edu" /&gt; and the whole of [[Herodotus]],&lt;ref name="digital.library.cornell.edu" /&gt; and was acquainted with [[Lucian]], [[Diogenes Laërtius]], [[Isocrates]] and six dialogues of [[Plato]].&lt;ref name="digital.library.cornell.edu" /&gt; He had also read a great deal of history in English and had been taught [[arithmetic]], physics and astronomy.

At the age of eight, Mill began studying [[Latin]], the works of [[Euclid]], and [[algebra]], and was appointed schoolmaster to the younger children of the family. His main reading was still history, but he went through all the commonly taught [[Latin literature|Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek literature|Greek]] authors and by the age of ten could read Plato and [[Demosthenes]] with ease. His father also thought that it was important for Mill to study and compose poetry. One of Mill's earliest poetic compositions was a continuation of the [[Iliad]]. In his spare time he also enjoyed reading about [[natural science]]s and popular novels, such as ''[[Don Quixote]]'' and ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]''.

His father's work, ''[[The History of British India]]'' was published in 1818; immediately thereafter, at about the age of twelve, Mill began a thorough study of the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] [[logic]], at the same time reading [[Aristotle]]'s logical treatises in the original language. In the following year he was introduced to [[political economy]] and studied [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]] with his father, ultimately completing their [[Classical economics|classical economic view]] of [[factors of production]]. Mill's ''comptes rendus'' of his daily economy lessons helped his father in writing ''Elements of Political Economy'' in 1821, a textbook to promote the ideas of [[Ricardian economics]]; however, the book lacked popular support.&lt;ref name="Rothbard2006"&gt;{{cite book |author=Murray N. Rothbard |title=An Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MCcWhLmRo-cC&amp;pg=RA1-PA105 |accessdate=21 January 2011 |date=1 February 2006 |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |isbn=978-0945466482 |page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ricardo, who was a close friend of his father, used to invite the young Mill to his house for a walk in order to talk about [[political economy]].

At the age of fourteen, Mill stayed a year in France with the family of Sir [[Samuel Bentham]], brother of [[Jeremy Bentham]]. The mountain scenery he saw led to a lifelong taste for mountain landscapes. The lively and friendly way of life of the French also left a deep impression on him. In [[Montpellier]], he attended the winter courses on [[chemistry]], [[zoology]], [[logic]] of the ''Faculté des Sciences'', as well as taking a course in higher mathematics. While coming and going from France, he stayed in Paris for a few days in the house of the renowned economist [[Jean-Baptiste Say]], a friend of Mill's father. There he met many leaders of the Liberal party, as well as other notable Parisians, including [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Henri Saint-Simon]].

Mill went through months of sadness and pondered suicide at twenty years of age. According to the opening paragraphs of Chapter V of his autobiography, he had asked himself whether the creation of a just society, his life's objective, would actually make him happy. His heart answered "no", and unsurprisingly he lost the happiness of striving towards this objective. Eventually, the poetry of [[William Wordsworth]] showed him that beauty generates compassion for others and stimulates joy.[http://www.victorianweb.org/philosophy/mill/crisis.html] With renewed joy he continued to work towards a just society, but with more relish for the journey. He considered this one of the most pivotal shifts in his thinking. In fact, many of the differences between him and his father stemmed from this expanded source of joy.

Mill had been engaged in a pen-friendship with [[Auguste Comte]], the founder of [[positivism]] and sociology, since Mill first contacted Comte in November 1841. Comte's ''sociologie'' was more an early [[philosophy of science]] than we perhaps know it today, and the ''positive'' philosophy aided in Mill's broad rejection of Benthamism.&lt;ref&gt;Pickering, Mary (1993), ''Auguste Comte: an intellectual biography'', Cambridge University Press, p. 540&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[nonconformist]] who refused to subscribe to the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of the [[Church of England]], Mill was not eligible to study at the [[University of Oxford]] or the [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;Capaldi, Nicholas. ''John Stuart Mill: A Biography.'' p. 33, Cambridge, 2004, {{ISBN|0521620244}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he followed his father to work for the [[East India Company]], and attended [[University College, London]], to hear the lectures of [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]], the first Professor of Jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=nwng&amp;cc=nwng&amp;idno=nwng0033-4&amp;node=nwng0033-4:1&amp;frm=frameset&amp;view=image&amp;seq=623 Journals: New Englander (1843–1892)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1856.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web |title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter M |url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterM.pdf |publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences |accessdate=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mill's career as a colonial administrator at the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] spanned from when he was 17 years old in 1823 until 1858, when the Company was [[Government of India Act 1858|abolished]] in favor of [[British Raj|direct rule by the British crown]] over India.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart.

In ''[[On Liberty]]'', ''[[A Few Words on Non-Intervention]]'', and other works, Mill defended [[British Empire|British imperialism]] by arguing that a fundamental distinction existed between civilized and barbarous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Violence and Epistemology J.

In 1851, Mill married [[Harriet Taylor Mill|Harriet Taylor]] after 21 years of intimate friendship. Taylor was married when they met, and their relationship was close but generally believed to be chaste during the years before her first husband died. Brilliant in her own right, Taylor was a significant influence on Mill's work and ideas during both friendship and marriage. His relationship with Harriet Taylor reinforced Mill's advocacy of [[women's rights]]. He cites her influence in his final revision of ''[[On Liberty]]'', which was published shortly after her death. Taylor died in 1858 after developing severe [[lung congestion]], after only seven years of marriage to Mill.

Between the years 1865 and 1868 Mill served as [[Lord Rector]] of the [[University of St. Andrews]]. During the same period, 1865–68, he was a [[Parliament of Great Britain|Member of Parliament]] for [[Westminster (UK Parliament constituency)|City and Westminster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=22991|date=14 July 1865 |page=3528}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bi2o"&gt;Capaldi, Nicholas. ''John Stuart Mill: A Biography.'' pp. 321–322, Cambridge, 2004, {{ISBN|0521620244}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was sitting for the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. During his time as an [[Member of Parliament|MP]], Mill advocated easing the burdens on Ireland. In 1866, Mill became the first person in the history of Parliament to call for women to be given the right to vote, vigorously defending this position in subsequent debate. Mill became a strong advocate of such social reforms as labour unions and farm cooperatives. In ''[[Considerations on Representative Government]]'', Mill called for various reforms of Parliament and voting, especially [[proportional representation]], the [[single transferable vote]], and the extension of [[suffrage]]. In April 1868, Mill favoured in a Commons debate the retention of [[capital punishment]] for such crimes as aggravated murder; he termed its abolition "an effeminacy in the general mind of the country."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;John Stuart Mill: ''Utilitarianism and the 1868 Speech on Capital Punishment''. (Sher, ed. Hackett Publishing Co, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

He was godfather to the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]].

In his views on religion, Mill was an [[agnostic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Secular Review]] |title=Editorial Notes |date=28 March 1885 |volume=16 |number=13 |page=203 |quote=It has always seemed to us that this is one of the instances in which Mill approached, out of deference to conventional opinion, as near to the borderland of [[Immanuel Kant|Cant]] as he well could without compromising his pride of place as a recognised thinker and sceptic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mbxCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=John Stuart Mill and the Religion of Humanity |year=2002 |publisher=University of Missouri Press |isbn=978-0826263278 |page=65 |author=Linda C.

===''A System of Logic''===
{{Main|A System of Logic}}
Mill joined the debate over [[scientific method]] which followed on from [[John Herschel]]'s 1830 publication of ''A Preliminary Discourse on the study of Natural Philosophy'', which incorporated [[inductive reasoning]] from the known to the unknown, discovering general laws in specific facts and verifying these laws empirically. [[William Whewell]] expanded on this in his 1837 ''History of the Inductive Sciences, from the Earliest to the Present Time'' followed in 1840 by ''The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, Founded Upon their History'', presenting induction as the mind superimposing concepts on facts. Laws were self-evident truths, which could be known without need for empirical verification. Mill countered this in 1843 in ''[[A System of Logic]], Ratiocinative and Inductive, Being a Connected View of the Principles of Evidence, and the Methods of Scientific Investigation.'' In [[Mill's Methods]] of induction, like Herschel's, laws were discovered through observation and induction, and required empirical verification.&lt;ref name="Shermer2002"&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Shermer |authorlink=Michael Shermer |title=In Darwin's Shadow: The Life and Science of Alfred Russel Wallace: A Biographical Study on the Psychology of History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eu9Uu3PbdcgC&amp;pg=PP212 |date=15 August 2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0199923854 |page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory of liberty===
{{Liberalism sidebar}}
{{Main|On Liberty}}
Mill's ''[[On Liberty]]'' addresses the nature and limits of the [[Power (philosophy)|power]] that can be legitimately exercised by society over the [[individual]]. However Mill is clear that his concern for liberty does not extend to all individuals and all societies. He states that "Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34901|title=On Liberty by John Stuart Mill|publisher=|via=www.gutenberg.org|date=2011-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mill states that it is acceptable to harm oneself as long as the person doing so is not harming others. He also argues that individuals should be prevented from doing lasting, serious harm to themselves or their property by the [[harm principle]]. Because no one exists in isolation, harm done to oneself may also harm others, and destroying property deprives the community as well as oneself.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart "On Liberty" Penguin Classics, 2006 {{ISBN|978-0141441474}} pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; Mill excuses those who are "incapable of [[self-government]]" from this principle, such as young children or those living in "backward states of society".

Though this principle seems clear, there are a number of complications. For example, Mill explicitly states that "harms" may include acts of omission as well as acts of commission. Thus, failing to rescue a [[drowning]] child counts as a harmful act, as does failing to pay [[taxes]], or failing to appear as a [[witness]] in court. All such harmful omissions may be regulated, according to Mill. By contrast, it does not count as harming someone if – without force or fraud – the affected individual consents to assume the risk: thus one may permissibly offer unsafe employment to others, provided there is no deception involved. (Mill does, however, recognise one limit to consent: society should not permit people to [[Voluntary slavery|sell themselves into slavery]]). In these and other cases, it is important to bear in mind that the arguments in ''On Liberty'' are grounded on the principle of Utility, and not on appeals to [[natural rights]].

The question of what counts as a self-regarding action and what actions, whether of omission or commission, constitute harmful actions subject to regulation, continues to exercise interpreters of Mill. It is important to emphasise that Mill did not consider giving offence to constitute "harm"; an action could not be restricted because it violated the conventions or morals of a given society.

''[[On Liberty]]'' involves an impassioned defense of free speech. Mill argues that free [[discourse]] is a [[necessary condition]] for intellectual and social progress. We can never be sure, he contends, that a silenced opinion does not contain some element of the truth. He also argues that allowing people to air false opinions is productive for two reasons. First, individuals are more likely to abandon erroneous beliefs if they are engaged in an open exchange of ideas. Second, by forcing other individuals to re-examine and re-affirm their beliefs in the process of debate, these beliefs are kept from declining into mere [[dogma]]. It is not enough for Mill that one simply has an unexamined belief that happens to be true; one must understand why the belief in question is the true one. Along those same lines Mill wrote, "unmeasured vituperation, employed on the side of prevailing opinion, really does deter people from expressing contrary opinions, and from listening to those who express them."&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart, ''On Liberty'', Harvard Classics: Volume 25, p. 258, PF Collier &amp; Sons Company New York 1909&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:J S Mill and H Taylor.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|John Stuart Mill and [[Helen Taylor (feminist)|Helen Taylor]]. Helen was the daughter of Harriet Taylor and collaborated with Mill for fifteen years after her mother's death in 1858.]]

====Social liberty and tyranny of majority====
{{refimprove section|date=April 2013}}
Mill believed that "the struggle between [[Liberty]] and [[Authority]] is the most conspicuous feature in the portions of history".&lt;ref name="OnLiberty-Bartleby"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bartleby.com/130/1.html|title=I. Introductory. Mill, John Stuart. 1869. On Liberty|website=www.bartleby.com|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For him, liberty in antiquity was a "contest ... between subjects, or some classes of subjects, and the government."&lt;ref name="OnLiberty-Bartleby" /&gt; Mill defined "[[social liberty]]" as protection from "the tyranny of political rulers". He introduced a number of different concepts of the form tyranny can take, referred to as social tyranny, and [[tyranny of the majority]].

[[Social liberty]] for Mill meant putting limits on the ruler's power so that he would not be able to use his power on his own wishes and make decisions which could harm society; in other words, people should have the right to have a say in the government's decisions. He said that [[social liberty]] was "the nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual". It was attempted in two ways: first, by obtaining recognition of certain immunities, called political liberties or rights; second, by establishment of a system of "[[constitutional]] checks".

However, in Mill's view, limiting the power of government was not enough. He stated, "Society can and does execute its own mandates: and if it issues wrong mandates instead of right, or any mandates at all in things with which it ought not to meddle, it practices a social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression, since, though not usually upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape, penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself."&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart, "On Liberty" Penguin Classics, 2006 {{ISBN|978-0141441474}} pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;

====Liberty====
John Stuart Mill's view on [[liberty]], which was influenced by [[Joseph Priestley]] and [[Josiah Warren]], is that the [[individual]] ought to be free to do as she/he wishes unless she/he harms others. Individuals are rational enough to make decisions about their well being. Government should interfere when it is for the protection of society. Mill explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinion of others, to do so would be wise, or even right ... The only part of the conduct of anyone, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns him, his independence is, of right, [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]]. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the [[individual]] is [[sovereignty|sovereign]].&lt;ref&gt;Mill, ''On Liberty'', p. 13. [http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=harp;cc=harp;rgn=full%20text;idno=harp0024-5;didno=harp0024-5;view=image;seq=00693;node=harp0024-5%3A1 Cornell.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Freedom of speech====
An influential advocate of [[freedom of speech]], Mill objected to censorship. He says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I choose, by preference the cases which are least favourable to me – In which the argument opposing freedom of opinion, both on truth and that of [[utility]], is considered the strongest. Let the opinions impugned be the belief of God and in a future state, or any of the commonly received doctrines of morality ... But I must be permitted to observe that it is not the feeling sure of a doctrine (be it what it may) which I call an assumption of [[infallibility]]. It is the undertaking to decide that question ''for others'', without allowing them to hear what can be said on the contrary side. And I denounce and reprobate this pretension not the less if it is put forth on the side of my most solemn convictions. However, positive anyone's persuasion may be, not only of the faculty but of the pernicious consequences, but (to adopt expressions which I altogether condemn) the immorality and impiety of opinion. – yet if, in pursuance of that private judgement, though backed by the public judgement of his country or contemporaries, he prevents the opinion from being heard in its defence, he assumes infallibility. And so far from the assumption being less objectionable or less dangerous because the opinion is called immoral or impious, this is the case of all others in which it is most fatal.&lt;ref&gt;John Stuart Mill (1806–1873) "On Liberty" 1859. ed. Gertrude Himmelfarb, UK: Penguin, 1985, pp. 83–84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mill outlines the benefits of 'searching for and discovering the truth' as a way to further knowledge. He argued that even if an opinion is false, the truth can be better understood by refuting the error. And as most opinions are neither completely true nor completely false, he points out that allowing free expression allows the airing of competing views as a way to preserve partial truth in various opinions.&lt;ref name="Freedomof"&gt;Freedom of Speech, Volume 21, by Ellen Frankel Paul, Fred Dycus Miller, Jeffrey Paul&lt;/ref&gt; Worried about minority views being suppressed, Mill also argued in support of freedom of speech on political grounds, stating that it is a critical component for a representative government to have in order to empower debate over public policy.&lt;ref name="Freedomof" /&gt; Mill also eloquently argued that freedom of expression allows for personal growth and self-realization. He said that freedom of speech was a vital way to develop talents and realise a person's potential and creativity. He repeatedly said that [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentricity]] was preferable to uniformity and stagnation.&lt;ref name="Freedomof" /&gt;

====Harm principle====
The belief that the freedom of speech will advance the society was formed with trust of the public's ability to filter. If any argument is really wrong or harmful, the public will judge it as wrong or harmful, and then those arguments cannot be sustained and will be excluded. Mill argued that even any arguments which are used in justifying murder or rebellion against the government shouldn't be politically suppressed or socially persecuted. According to him, if rebellion is really necessary, people should rebel; if murder is truly proper, it should be allowed. But, the way to express those arguments should be a public speech or writing, not in a way that causes actual harm to others. This is the harm principle.

&lt;blockquote&gt; That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.&lt;ref&gt;John Stuart Mill. (1863 [1859]). ''On Liberty''. Ticknor and Fields. p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the beginning of the twentieth century, Associate Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. made the standard of "clear and present danger" based on Mill's idea. In the majority opinion, Holmes writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent.&lt;ref&gt;''Schenck v. United States'', 249 US 47 – Supreme Court 1919&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Holmes suggested that shouting out "Fire!" in a dark theatre, which makes people panic and gets them injured, would be such a case of speech that creates an illegal danger.{{sfn|George|Kline|2006|p=409}} But if the situation allows people to reason by themselves and decide to accept it or not, any argument or theology should not be blocked.

Nowadays, Mill's argument is generally accepted by many democratic countries, and they have laws at least guided by the harm principle. For example, in American law some exceptions limit free speech such as obscenity, defamation, breach of peace, and "fighting words".{{sfn|George|Kline|2006|p=410}}

===Colonialism===

Mill, an employee for the [[British East India Company]] from 1823 to 1858,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/philosophy/mill/career.html|title=J. S. Mill's Career at the East India Company|website=www.victorianweb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued in support of what he called a 'benevolent despotism' with regard to the colonies.&lt;ref name="David Theo Goldberg 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Theo Goldberg | first1 = David | year = 2000 | title = "Liberalism's limits: Carlyle and Mill on "the negro question | url = | journal = Nineteenth-Century Contexts: An Interdisciplinary Journal | volume = 22 | issue = 2| pages = 203–216 | doi = 10.1080/08905490008583508 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mill argued that "To suppose that the same international customs, and the same rules of international morality, can obtain between one civilized nation and another, and between civilized nations and barbarians, is a grave error. ... To characterize any conduct whatever towards a barbarous people as a violation of the law of nations, only shows that he who so speaks has never considered the subject."&lt;ref&gt;John Stuart Mill,'' Dissertations and Discussions: Political, Philosophical, and Historical'' (New York 1874) Vol. 3, pp. 252–253.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slavery===
In 1850, Mill sent an anonymous letter (which came to be known under the title "[[Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question|The Negro Question]]"),&lt;ref&gt;''The Negro Question'', pp. 130–137. by John Stuart Mill.&lt;/ref&gt; in rebuttal to [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s anonymous letter to ''Fraser's Magazine for Town and Country'' in which Carlyle argued for slavery. Mill supported abolition in the United States.

In Mill's essay from 1869, "The Subjection of Women", he expressed his opposition to slavery:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This absolutely extreme case of the law of force, condemned by those who can tolerate almost every other form of arbitrary power, and which, of all others, presents features the most revolting to the feeling of all who look at it from an impartial position, was the law of civilized and Christian England within the memory of persons now living: and in one half of Angle-Saxon America three or four years ago, not only did slavery exist, but the slave trade, and the breeding of slaves expressly for it, was a general practice between slave states. Yet not only was there a greater strength of sentiment against it, but, in England at least, a less amount either of feeling or of interest in favour of it, than of any other of the customary abuses of force: for its motive was the love of gain, unmixed and undisguised: and those who profited by it were a very small numerical fraction of the country, while the natural feeling of all who were not personally interested in it, was unmitigated abhorrence.&lt;ref name="The Subjection of Women"&gt;Mill, J. S. (1869) [http://www.constitution.org/jsm/women.htm ''The Subjection of Women''], Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Women's rights===
[[File:John Stuart Mill, Vanity Fair, 1873-03-29.jpg|thumb|"A Feminine Philosopher". Caricature by [[Leslie Ward|Spy]] published in ''[[Vanity Fair (UK)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1873.]]
Mill's view of history was that right up until his time "the whole of the female" and "the great majority of the male sex" were simply "slaves". He countered arguments to the contrary, arguing that relations between sexes simply amounted to "the legal subordination of one sex to the other – [which] is wrong itself, and now one of the chief hindrances to human improvement; and that it ought to be replaced by a principle of perfect equality." With this, Mill can be considered among the earliest male proponents of gender equality. His book ''[[The Subjection of Women]]'' (1861, published 1869) is one of the earliest written on this subject by a male author.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} In ''The Subjection of Women'' Mill attempts to make a case for perfect equality.&lt;ref&gt;John Stuart Mill: critical assessments, Volume 4, By [[John Cunningham Wood]]&lt;/ref&gt; He talks about the role of women in marriage and how it needed to be changed. There, Mill comments on three major facets of women's lives that he felt are hindering them: society and gender construction, education, and marriage. He argued that the oppression of women was one of the few remaining relics from ancient times, a set of prejudices that severely impeded the progress of humanity.&lt;ref name="The Subjection of Women" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |contribution=The subjection of women |editor1-last=Cudd |editor1-first=Ann E. |editor2-last=Andreasen |editor2-first=Robin O. |editor-link=Ann Cudd |title=Feminist theory: a philosophical anthology |pages=17–26 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location=Oxford, UK; Malden, Massachusetts |year=2005 |isbn=978-1405116619 |ref=harv |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utilitarianism===
{{Main|Utilitarianism (book)}}
The canonical statement of Mill's utilitarianism can be found in ''[[Utilitarianism (book)|Utilitarianism]]''. This philosophy has a long tradition, although Mill's account is primarily influenced by [[Jeremy Bentham]] and Mill's father [[James Mill]].

Jeremy Bentham's famous formulation of utilitarianism is known as the "greatest-happiness principle". It holds that one must always act so as to produce the greatest aggregate happiness among all sentient beings, within reason. In a similar vein, Mill's method of determining the best utility is that a moral agent, when given the choice between two or more actions, ought to choose the action that contributes most to (maximizes) the total happiness in the world. Happiness in this context is understood as the production of pleasure or privation of pain. Given that determining the action that produces the most utility is not always so clear cut, Mill suggests that the utilitarian moral agent, when attempting to rank the utility of different actions, should refer to the general experience of persons. That is, if people generally experience more happiness following action X than they do action Y, the utilitarian should conclude that action X produces more utility than, and is thus favorable to, action Y.&lt;ref name="John Stuart Mill"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11224|title=Utilitarianism by John Stuart Mill|publisher=|via=www.gutenberg.org|date=February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utilitarianism is built upon the basis of consequentialism, that is, the means are justified based solely off the result of said actions. The overarching goal of Utilitarianism – the ideal consequence – is to achieve the "greatest good for the greatest number as the end result of human action".&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Stephen J., Dennis W. Engels, and Michael K. Altekruse. "Foundations for Ethical Standards and Codes: The Role of Moral Philosophy and Theory in Ethics." ''Counseling and Values'', vol. 48, no. 3, 2004, pp. 163–173'', eLibrary''.&lt;/ref&gt; Mill states in his writings on Utilitarianism that "happiness is the sole end of human action."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This statement brought about a bit of controversy, which is why Mill took it a step further, explaining how the very nature of humans wanting happiness, and who "take it to be reasonable under free consideration", demands that happiness is indeed desirable.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In other words, free will leads everyone to make actions inclined on their own happiness, unless reasoned that it would improve the happiness of others, in which case, the greatest utility is still being achieved. To that extent, the Utilitarianism that Mill is describing is a default lifestyle that he believes is what people who have not studied a specific opposing field of ethics would naturally and subconsciously utilize when faced with decision. Utilitarianism is thought of by some of its activists to be a more developed and overarching ethical theory of Kant's belief in good will however, and not just some default cognitive process of humans. Where Kant would argue that reason can only be used properly by good will, Mill would say that the only way to universally create fair laws and systems would be to step back to the consequences, whereby Kant's ethical theories become based around the ultimate good – utility.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, G. Scott. "Introduction." Introduction to Utilitarianism, by John Stuart Mill, VII–XIV. Barnes &amp; Noble Library of Essential Reading. Barnes and Noble, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; By this logic the only valid way to discern what is proper reason would be to view the consequences of any action and weigh the good and the bad, even if on the surface, the ethical reasoning seems to indicate a different train of thought.

Mill's major contribution to utilitarianism is his argument for the qualitative separation of pleasures. Bentham treats all forms of happiness as equal, whereas Mill argues that intellectual and moral pleasures (higher pleasures) are superior to more physical forms of pleasure (lower pleasures). Mill distinguishes between happiness and contentment, claiming that the former is of higher value than the latter, a belief wittily encapsulated in the statement that "it is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be [[Socrates]] dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are of a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question."&lt;ref name="John Stuart Mill"/&gt;

Mill defines the difference between higher and lower forms of pleasure with the principle that those who have experienced both tend to prefer one over the other. This is, perhaps, in direct contrast with Bentham's statement that "Quantity of pleasure being equal, push-pin is as good as poetry",&lt;ref name="Bronfenbrenner"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1465-7295.1977.tb00452.x | volume=15 | title=Poetry, Pushpin, and Utility | year=1977 | journal=Economic Inquiry | pages=95–110 | last1 = Bronfenbrenner | first1 = Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; that, if a simple child's game like [[hopscotch]] causes more pleasure to more people than a night at the opera house, it is more imperative upon a society to devote more resources to propagating hopscotch than running opera houses. Mill's argument is that the "simple pleasures" tend to be preferred by people who have no experience with high art, and are therefore not in a proper position to [[Informed judge|judge]]. Mill also argues that people who, for example, are noble or practice philosophy, benefit society more than those who engage in individualist practices for pleasure, which are lower forms of happiness. It is not the agent's own greatest happiness that matters "but the greatest amount of happiness altogether".{{sfn|Mill|1863|p=[https://archive.org/stream/a592840000milluoft#page/16 16]}}

Mill separated his explanation of Utilitarianism into five different sections; General Remarks, What Utilitarianism Is, Of the Ultimate Sanction of the Principle of Utility, Of What Sort of Proof the Principle of Utility is Susceptible, and Of the Connection between Justice and Utility. In the General Remarks portion of his essay he speaks how next to no progress has been made when it comes to judging what is right and what is wrong of morality and if there is such a thing as moral instinct (which he argues that there may not be). However he agrees that in general "Our moral faculty, according to all those of its interpreters who are entitled to the name of thinkers, supplies us only with the general principles of moral judgments".{{sfn|Mill|1863|p=2}} In the second chapter of his essay he focuses no longer on background information but Utilitarianism itself. He quotes Utilitarianism as "The greatest happiness principle" And defines this theory by saying that pleasure and no pain are the only inherently good things in the world and expands on it by saying that "actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. By happiness is intended pleasure, and the absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain, and the privation of pleasure."{{sfn|Mill|1863|p=3}} He views it not as an animalistic concept because he sees seeking out pleasure as a way of using our higher facilities. He also says in this chapter that the happiness principle is based not exclusively on the individual but mainly on the community.

In his next chapter he focuses in more on the specifics of Utilitarianism when he writes about the sanctions of oneself. He states that a person possesses two sanctions; the internal sanction and the external sanction. According to Mill, the internal sanction is "a feeling in our own mind; a pain, more or less intense, attendant on violation of duty, which in properly cultivated moral natures rises, in the more serious cases, into shrinking from it as an impossibility."{{sfn|Mill|1863|p=6}} Shorthand, he basically just explains that your internal sanction is your conscience. The external sanction he says is "the hope of favour and the fear of displeasure, from our fellow creatures or from the Ruler of the Universe". This states that the external sanction is almost a form of fear of God himself. The sanctions are mentioned because according to Mill the internal sanction is what grasps onto the concept of Utilitarianism and is what makes people want to accept Utilitarianism.

In Mill's fourth chapter he speaks of what proofs of Utility are affected. He starts this chapter off by saying that all of his claims cannot be backed up by reasoning. He claims that the only proof that something is brings one pleasure is if someone finds it pleasurable. Next he talks about how morality is the basic way to achieve happiness. He also discusses in this chapter that Utilitarianism is beneficial for virtue. He says that "it maintains not only that virtue is to be desired, but that it is to be desired disinterestedly, for itself."{{sfn|Mill|1863|p=24}} In his final chapter Mill looks and the connection between Utilitarianism and justice. He contemplates the question of whether justice is something distinct from Utility or not. He reasons this question in several different ways and finally comes to the conclusion that in certain cases justice is essential for Utility, but in others social duty is far more important than justice. Mill believes that "justice must give way to some other moral principle, but that what is just in ordinary cases is, by reason of that other principle, not just in the particular case."{{sfn|Mill|1863|p=29}}

The qualitative account of happiness that Mill advocates thus sheds light on his account presented in ''On Liberty''. As Mill suggests in that text, utility is to be conceived in relation to humanity "as a progressive being", which includes the development and exercise of rational capacities as we strive to achieve a "higher mode of existence". The rejection of censorship and [[paternalism]] is intended to provide the necessary social conditions for the achievement of knowledge and the greatest ability for the greatest number to develop and exercise their deliberative and rational capacities.

Mill redefines the definition of happiness as; "the ultimate end, for the sake of which all other things are desirable (whether we are considering our own good or that of other people) is an existence as free as possible from pain and as rich as possible in enjoyments".{{sfn|Mill|1863|p=8}} He firmly believed that moral rules and obligations could be referenced to promoting happiness, which connects to having a noble character. While John Stuart Mill is not a standard act or rule utilitarian, he is a minimizing utilitarian, which "affirms that it would be ''desirable'' to maximize happiness for the greatest number, but not that we are not morally ''required'' to do so".{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|2006|p=84}}

Mill's thesis distinguishes between higher and lower pleasures. He frequently discusses the importance of acknowledgement of higher pleasures. "To suppose that life has (as they express it) no higher end than pleasure- no better and nobler object of desire and pursuit they designate as utterly mean and groveling; as a doctrine worthy only of swine".{{sfn|Mill|1863|p=}}{{page needed|date=March 2018}} When he says higher pleasures, he means the pleasures that access higher abilities and capacities in humans such as intellectual prosperity, whereas lower pleasures would mean bodily or temporary pleasures. "But it must be admitted that when utilitarian writers have said that mental pleasures are better than bodily ones they have mainly based this on mental pleasures being more permanent, safer, less costly and so on&amp;nbsp;– i.e. from their circumstantial advantages rather than from their intrinsic nature".{{sfn|Mill|1863|p=6}} All of this factors into John Mill's own definition of utilitarianism, and shows why it differs from other definitions.

===Economic philosophy===
{{Main|Principles of Political Economy}}
[[File:Mill - Essays on economics and society, 1967 - 5499347.tif|thumb|''Essays on economics and society'', 1967]]
Mill's early [[Philosophy and economics|economic philosophy]] was one of [[free market]]s. However, he accepted interventions in the economy, such as a tax on alcohol, if there were sufficient [[utilitarian]] grounds. He also accepted the principle of legislative intervention for the purpose of animal welfare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifaw.org/ifaw/dfiles/file_285.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626225342/http://www.ifaw.org/ifaw/dfiles/file_285.pdf|date=26 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mill originally believed that "equality of taxation" meant "[[equality of sacrifice]]" and that [[progressive tax]]ation penalised those who worked harder and saved more and was therefore "a mild form of robbery".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irefeurope.org/col_docs/doc_51_fr.pdf IREF | Pour la liberte economique et la concurrence fiscale] (PDF) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327011315/http://www.irefeurope.org/col_docs/doc_51_fr.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given an equal tax rate regardless of income, Mill agreed that [[inheritance]] should be taxed. A utilitarian society would agree that everyone should be equal one way or another. Therefore, receiving inheritance would put one ahead of society unless taxed on the inheritance. Those who donate should consider and choose carefully where their money goes&amp;nbsp;– some charities are more deserving than others. Considering public charities boards such as a government will disburse the money equally. However, a private charity board like a church would disburse the monies fairly to those who are in more need than others.{{sfn|Strasser|1991}}

Later he altered his views toward a more socialist bent, adding chapters to his Principles of Political Economy in defence of a socialist outlook, and defending some socialist causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mill, John Stuart and Bentham, Jeremy edited by Ryan, Alan. |title=Utilitarianism and other essays |edition= |publisher=Penguin Books |year=2004 |location=London |isbn=978-0140432725 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this revised work he also made the radical proposal that the whole wage system be abolished in favour of a co-operative wage system. Nonetheless, some of his views on the idea of flat taxation remained,&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilson |first=Fred |title=John Stuart Mill: Political Economy |journal=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |year=2007 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/mill/#PolEco |accessdate=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; albeit altered in the third edition of the ''Principles of Political Economy'' to reflect a concern for differentiating restrictions on "unearned" incomes, which he favoured, and those on "earned" incomes, which he did not favour.&lt;ref name="principles online"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |title=On The General Principles of Taxation, V.2.14 |work=Principles of Political Economy |publisher=[[Library of Economics and Liberty]] |year=1852}}
 (3rd edition; the passage about flat taxation was altered by the author in this edition, which is acknowledged in this online edition's footnote 8:  "[This sentence replaced in the 3rd ed. a sentence of the original: 'It is partial taxation, which is a mild form of robbery.']")&lt;/ref&gt;

Mill's ''Principles'', first published in 1848, was one of the most widely read of all books on economics in the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ekelund, Robert B., Jr. |author2=Hébert, Robert F. |title=A history of economic theory and method |edition=4th |publisher=Waveland Press [Long Grove, Illinois] |year=1997 |isbn=978-1577663812 |page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations|Wealth of Nations]]'' had during an earlier period, Mill's ''Principles'' dominated economics teaching. In the case of [[Oxford University]] it was the standard text until 1919, when it was replaced by [[Principles of Economics (Marshall)|Marshall's ''Principles of Economics'']].

====Economic democracy====
Mill promoted [[economic democracy]] instead of [[capitalism]], in the manner of substituting capitalist businesses with [[worker cooperative]]s. He says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The form of association, however, which if mankind continue to improve, must be expected in the end to predominate, is not that which can exist between a capitalist as chief, and work-people without a voice in the management, but the association of the labourers themselves on terms of equality, collectively owning the capital with which they carry on their operations, and working under managers elected and removable by themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Principles of Political Economy with some of their Applications to Social Philosophy, IV.7.21 John Stuart Mill: Political Economy, IV.7.21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Political democracy====
Mill's major work on political democracy, ''Considerations on Representative Government'', defends two fundamental principles: extensive participation by citizens and enlightened competence of rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Dennis. ''John Stuart Mill and Representative Government''. Princeton University Press, 1976. {{ISBN|978-0691021874}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two values are obviously in tension, and some readers have concluded that he is an elitist democrat,&lt;ref&gt;Letwin, Shirley. ''The Pursuit of Certainty''. Cambridge University Press, 1965 (p. 306). {{ISBN|978-0865971943}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others count him as an earlier participatory democrat.&lt;ref&gt;Pateman, Carole. ''Participation and Democratic Theory''. Cambridge University Press, 1970 (p. 28). {{ISBN|978-0521290043}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one section he appears to defend plural voting, in which more competent citizens are given extra votes (a view he later repudiated). But in chapter 3 he presents what is still one of the most eloquent cases for the value of participation by all citizens. He believed that the incompetence of the masses could eventually be overcome if they were given a chance to take part in politics, especially at the local level.

Mill is one of the few political philosophers ever to serve in government as an elected official. In his three years in Parliament, he was more willing to compromise than the "radical" principles expressed in his writing would lead one to expect.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Dennis. "Mill in Parliament: When Should a Philosopher Compromise?" in ''J. S. Mill's Political Thought'', eds. N. Urbinati and A. Zakaras (Cambridge University Press, 2007), pp. 166–199. {{ISBN|978-0521677561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The environment====
Mill demonstrated an early insight into the value of the natural world – in particular in Book IV, chapter VI of ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'': "Of the Stationary State"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/mill/book4/bk4ch06|title=''The Principles of Political Economy'', Book 4, Chapter VI |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6VDY-4DG3DFP-1/2/d74b62bf0315ae52a3e60f698eae5ca5 |title=The early history of modern ecological economics |first=Inge |last=Røpke |issue=3–4|date= 1 October 2004 |accessdate=8 August 2008 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2004.02.012 |volume=50 |journal=Ecological Economics |pages=293–314}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Mill recognised wealth beyond the material, and argued that the logical conclusion of unlimited growth was [[Economic growth#Environmental impact|destruction of the environment]] and a reduced quality of life. He concluded that a [[Steady-state economy|stationary state]] could be preferable to unending economic growth:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I cannot, therefore, regard the stationary states of capital and wealth with the unaffected aversion so generally manifested towards it by political economists of the old school.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the earth must lose that great portion of its pleasantness which it owes to things that the unlimited increase of wealth and population would extirpate from it, for the mere purpose of enabling it to support a larger, but not a better or a happier population, I sincerely hope, for the sake of posterity, that they will be content to be stationary, long before necessity compel them to it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Economic development====
{{refimprove section|date=April 2013}}
Mill regarded economic development as a function of land, labour and capital. While land and labour are the two original factors of production, capital is "a stock, previously accumulated of the products of former labour." Increase in wealth is possible only if land and capital help to increase production faster than the labour force. It is productive labour that is productive of wealth and capital accumulation. "The rate of capital accumulation is the function of the proportion of the labour force employed productively. Profits earned by employing unproductive labours are merely transfers of income; unproductive labour does not generate wealth or income". It is productive labourers who do productive consumption. Productive consumption is that "which maintains and increase the productive capacity of the community." It implies that productive consumption is an input necessary to maintain productive labourers.&lt;ref&gt;''John Stuart Mill's Social and Political Thought: Critical Assessments'', by John Stuart Mill&lt;/ref&gt;

====Control of population growth====
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
Mill supported the [[Malthusian]] theory of population. By population he meant the number of the working class only. He was therefore concerned about the growth in number of labourers who worked for hire. He believed that population control was essential for improving the condition of the working class so that they might enjoy the fruits of the technological progress and capital accumulation. Mill advocated birth control. In 1823 Mill and a friend were arrested while distributing pamphlets on birth control by Francis Place to women in working class areas.&lt;ref name="Capaldi2004"&gt;{{cite book |author=Nicholas Capaldi |title=John Stuart Mill: A Biography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8SxydLpuVC4C |accessdate=1 September 2013 |year= 2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1139449205 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wage fund====
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
According to Mill, supply is very elastic in response to wages. Wages generally exceed the minimum subsistence level, and are paid out of capital. Hence, wages are limited by existing capital for paying wages. Thus, wage per worker can be derived by dividing the total circulating capital by the size of the working population. Wages can increase by an increase in the capital used in paying wages, or by decrease in the number of workers. If wages rise, supply of labour will rise. Competition among workers not only brings down wages, but also keeps some workers out of employment. This is based on Mill's notion that "demand for commodities is not demand for labourers". It means that income invested as advances of wages to labour creates employment, and not income spent on consumer goods. An increase in consumption causes a decline in investment. So increased investment leads to increases in the wage fund and to economic progress.

In 1869, Mill recanted his support of the Wage-Fund Doctrine due to recognition that capital is not necessarily fixed in that it can be supplemented through "income of the employer which might otherwise go into saving or be spent on consumption."{{sfn|Spiegel|1991|p=390}} Walker{{who|date=November 2015}} also states in "The Wages Question" that the limits on capital and the growth in population "were accidental, not essential" to the formation of the doctrine. The limitation on the growth of industrial capacity placed a limit on the number of workers who could be accommodated more than the limit on capital. Furthermore, English agriculture "had reached the condition of diminishing returns.";{{sfn|Walker|1876|p=[https://archive.org/stream/wagesquestiontre00walkiala#page/142 142]}} therefore, each additional worker was not providing more output than he needed for himself for survival. Given the improvements in technology and productivity that followed 1848, the original reasons that gave rise to the doctrine were seen to be unusual and not the basis for a universal law.

====Rate of capital accumulation====
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
According to Mill, the rate of capital accumulation depends on: (1) "the amount of fund from which saving can be made" or "the size of the net produce of the industry", and (2) the "disposition to save". Capital is the result of savings, and the savings come from the "abstinence from present consumption for the sake of future goods". Although capital is the result of saving, it is nevertheless consumed. This means saving is spending. Since saving depends on the net produce of the industry, it grows with profits and rent which go into making the net produce. On the other hand, the disposition to save depends on (1) the rate of profit and (2) the desire to save, or what Mill called "effective desire of accumulation". However, profit also depends on the cost of labour, and the rate of profit is the ratio of profits to wages. When profits rise or wages fall, the rate of profits increases, which in turn increases the rate of capital accumulation. Similarly, it is the desire to save which tends to increase the rate of capital accumulation.

====Rate of profit====
According to Mill, the ultimate tendency in an economy is for the rate of profit to decline due to diminishing returns in agriculture and increase in population at a Malthusian rate &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mill |first1=John Stuart |title=Principles of Political Economy |page=25 |url=http://eet.pixel-online.org/files/etranslation/original/Mill,%20Principles%20of%20Political%20Economy.pdf |accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5162">'''Mark de Bretton Platts''' (born 1947) is a philosopher at the Instituto de Investigaciones Filosóficas de la [[Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México]] (Institute for Philosophical Investigation, National Autonomous University of Mexico). He is well known for criticizing the Humean theory of motivation, especially in his book ''Ways of Meaning'' (1979/1997).

==Life==
Platts was born in England in 1947. He studied philosophy at [[University College, Oxford]], where he received his [[B.Phil.|Bachelor of Philosophy]] in 1972. He has won several prizes for his academic work, such as the Henry Wilde Prize (in 1969) and the John Locke Prize (in 1971) from Oxford University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filosoficas.unam.mx/~platts/home.html Platts's Home Page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531182802/http://www.filosoficas.unam.mx/~platts/home.html |date=2008-05-31 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Platts was a lecturer at Birkbeck College, University of London, for a period in the 1970s and 1980s, where he lectured on philosophical logic and the philosophy of language and also on Descartes and Locke. His colleagues included [[Roger Scruton]], Ian McFetridge, and Samuel Guttenplan. 

Platts was a strong believer in the tutorial system at Birkbeck.

==Work==
Some of Platts's work has been highly influential.  He is well known for his criticisms of the Humean theory of motivation and is considered an "Anti-Humean" (along with philosophers like [[John McDowell]]).&lt;ref&gt;See §3.1 of: Rosati, Connie S. (2008). "Moral Motivation", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/moral-motivation/&lt;/ref&gt; This issue has generated a large body of research in the late 20th century. For example, [[Michael A. Smith (philosopher)|Michael Smith]] discusses Platts's Anti-Humeanism at length in his influential book ''The Moral Problem'' (1994), which won the Book Prize of the [[American Philosophical Association]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apa.udel.edu/apa/opportunities/prizes/book.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

Platts's book, ''Ways of Meaning'' (1979/1997) has been cited by many prominent philosophers, such as [[Simon Blackburn]], [[Philip Pettit]], [[William Lycan]], [[Christopher Peacocke]], and [[Ernest Lepore]]---to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Search+Scholar&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_sauthors=Mark+Platts&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;as_allsubj=some&amp;as_subj=soc&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent philosopher, [[Peter Ludlow]], writes of Platts's (1979/1997) book: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is the book that turned on a generation of philosophers of language—turned them on to the Davidsonian program, that is ... More than that, he surveyed a number of natural language constructions, showing how they could be handled in such a framework, and thereby mapping out the landscape of what has since become a full-blown philosophical research program.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/0262661071&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''{{Lang|la|Mater semper certa est}}''' ("The mother is always certain") is a [[Roman law|Roman-law]]  principle which has the power of {{Lang|la|[[conclusive presumption|praesumptio iuris et de iure]]}}, meaning that no counter-evidence can be made against this principle (literally: Presumed there is no counter evidence and by the law). Its meaning is that the mother of the child is always known.&lt;ref name="ZweigertDrobnig1991"&gt;{{cite book|author1=K. Zweigert|author2=K. Drobnig|title=International Encyclopedia of Comparative Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wKPET7pA_4MC&amp;pg=PA28|date=1 January 1991|publisher=BRILL|pages=28–|id=GGKEY:1LUWFFPE9KR}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since 1978, when the first child was conceived by the technique of [[In vitro fertilisation|''in-vitro'' fertilization]], the principle of {{Lang|la|Mater semper certa est}} no longer applies, since a child may have a ''genetic'' and a ''natural'' ("[[birth]]") mother who are different individuals. Since then some countries have converted the old natural law to an equivalent [[Codification (law)|codified law]] - in 1997 Germany introduced paragraph 1571 {{Lang|de|Mutterschaft}} ("motherhood") of the [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|BGB]] ([[civil code]]) reading {{Lang|de|Mutter eines Kindes ist die Frau, die es geboren hat}} ("the mother of a child is the woman who gave birth to it"). 

The Roman law principle however does not stop at the mother, in fact it continues with {{Lang|la|pater semper incertus est}} ("The father is always uncertain"). This was regulated by the law of {{Lang|la|pater est, quem nuptiae demonstrant}} ("the father is he to whom marriage points"). Essentially [[paternity fraud]] had originally been a marriage fraud in the civil code&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In Germany, the historic {{Lang|de|Ehelichkeitsanfechtungsklage}} ("action in dispute of legitimacy") was simply renamed as {{Lang|de|Vaterschaftsanfechtungsklage}} ("action in dispute of fatherhood") when [[paternity (law)|legal paternity]] was redefined.{{CN|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to this principle. Today some married fathers use the modern tools of [[DNA testing]] to ensure a certainty on their fatherhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1580398-1,00.html | work=Time Magazine U.S. | location= | title=Duped Dads Fight Back | date=19 January 2007 | first=Julie | last=Rawe }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mircea Aurel Vulcănescu''' (3 March 1904, [[Bucharest]] &amp;ndash; 28 October 1952, [[Aiud]]) was a [[Romania]]n philosopher, economist, ethics teacher and sociologist. Undersecretary at the Ministry of Finance from 1941 to 1944 in the Nazi-aligned government of [[Ion Antonescu]], he was arrested in 1946 and convicted as a [[war criminal]].&lt;ref name="revista22"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revista22.ro/mircea-vulcanescu-si-memoria-publica-44107.html|title=Mircea Vulcănescu şi memoria publică|language=Romanian|publisher=[[Revista 22]]|last=Florian|first=Alexandru|date=June 24, 2014|accessdate=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The documents of the trial, previously detained by the [[Securitate]], were recently published by Dora Mezdrea, in Nae Ionescu și discipolii săi în arhiva Securității. Vol. V: Mircea Vulcănescu, Editura Eikon, Cluj-Napoca, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He studied philosophy and law at the [[University of Bucharest]], graduating in 1925. He was then more attracted to [[sociology]], due to his field experiences (monograph campaigns) under the coordination of professor [[Dimitrie Gusti]]. Gusti became one of his most admired mentors, alongside [[Nae Ionescu]]. He was also Gusti's assistant at the University of Sociology in [[Bucharest]]. He started working towards a Ph.D. degree in law and sociology at the [[University of Paris]], but dropped out later.

From June 1935 to September 1937 he was director of the Customs Service, while in 1940 he was director of ''Public Debt'' Department. From January 27, 1941 to August 23, 1944, he was undersecretary at the Ministry of Finance, in the [[Ion Antonescu]] government.&lt;ref name="RL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romlit.ro/deinutul_k_9320_mircea_vulcnescu|title=Deţinutul K 9320: Mircea Vulcănescu|last=Diaconescu|first=Ioana|language=Romanian|publisher=[[Romania literara]]|accessdate=October 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[King Michael's Coup]], he was arrested on August 30, 1946, tried as a war criminal, and sentenced on October 9, 1946 to 8 years in prison.&lt;ref name="RL"/&gt; However, the trial is in itself a controversial one, since the judiciary regime suffered from the influence of the communist party and, consequently, from the Soviet occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Iuliu Crăcană, Dreptul în slujba puterii. Justiția în regimul comunist din România. 1944-1958, Ed. Institutului Național pentru Studierea Totalitarismului, București, 2015, pp. 93-105&lt;/ref&gt; Vulcănescu was convicted for ”permitting the entry of the German army on the country's territory" and for "declaring or continuing the war against the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United Nations".&lt;ref&gt;Nae Ionescu și discipolii săi în arhiva Securității. Vol. V: Mircea Vulcănescu, editor Dora Mezdrea, Editura Eikon, Cluj-Napoca, 2013, p. 500&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicolae Mărgineanu, a teacher at the King Ferdinand I University of Cluj-Napoca and a post-mortem [[list of members of the Romanian Academy|member of the Romanian Academy]], claimed that the accusations that were brought against Vulcănescu were false and that he was a victim of the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]].,&lt;ref&gt;[Margineanu, N. (1991). Amfiteatre si inchisori. Amphitheatres and Prisons]&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a larger scheme of the regime whose aim was to slowly kill of Romanian intellectuals, especially those who opposed the regime.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Controversies==
According to [[Zigu Ornea]], Vulcănescu considered himself a sympathizer of the [[Iron Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ornea|first=Zigu|title=Anii treizeci. Extrema dreaptă românească|language=Romanian|publisher=Editura Samuel Tastet|year=2009|url=http://atelier.liternet.ro/articol/7437/Zigu-Ornea/Anii-treizeci-Extrema-dreapta-romaneasca.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars considered him to be "a supporter of discrimination based on ethnicity",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/articol.php?cod=7466|title=Intelectualii români si "chestia evreiasca"|last=Moraru|first=Ovidiu|language=Romanian|publisher=Romania culturala|date=2005|number=6 (639)|accessdate=October 28, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924123630/http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/articol.php?cod=7466|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who, according to the director of the [[Elie Wiesel National Institute for Studying the Holocaust in Romania]], "supported spiritually and morally the antisemitism of the government."&lt;ref name="revista22"/&gt;

Despite these claims, in one of his works, Vulcănescu reportedly considered the Iron Guard as a terrorist movement controlled by the Nazi Germany. For these reasons, he refused to join the government lead by The Legionary Movement in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Vulcănescu, ”Nae Ionescu așa cum l-am cunoscut”, Ed. Humanitas, 1993, p. 84, 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
He was married twice: to Anina Rădulescu-Pogoneanui, and to Margareta Ioana Niculescu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romlit.ro/coala_central_de_fete_la_150_de_ani|title=Şcoala Centrală de fete la 150 de ani|publisher=[[Romania literara]]|date=2001|number=11|language=Romanian|accessdate=October 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had three daughters: Mariuca, Vivi, and Sandra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.formula-as.ro/2009/898/asul-de-inima-45/vicleim-in-patru-acte-11930|title=Vicleim in patru acte|language=Romanian|date=2008|number=898|publisher=Formula AS|accessdate=October 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moiz Cohen''' (1883 [[Serres]], [[Salonica Vilayet]], [[Ottoman Empire]]–1961 [[Nice]], [[France]]) was a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] writer, philosopher and ideologue of the [[Pan-Turkism|Pan-Turkist]] movement. Born to a [[Jews in Turkey|Jewish]] family, he later changed his name to '''Munis Tekinalp'''.&lt;ref name="jml"&gt;Jacob M. Landau, ''Tekinalp, Turkish Patriot, 1883-1961'' (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

He would later continue to legal studies in Salonica, completing them in [[Constantinople]] after Salonica fell to [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]].&lt;ref name="jml"/&gt;

In 1905, he began to write for the newspapers ''Asır'', where he worked for five years and was promoted to its editor-in-chief. While he has teaching law and economics at [[Istanbul University]] he was engaged in tabac export. He published an economy magazine for the Association of Economy and served as a consultant for some companies until 1918.&lt;ref name="bd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bilgilidunya.net/2012/01/moiz-kohenden-munis-tekinalpi-yaratan-sureci-anlamak/ |publisher=Bilgili Dünya |title=Moiz Cohen'den Munis Tekinalp'ı yaratan süreci anlamak |author=Aslan, Ümit |date=2012-01-20 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2012-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He would later become one of the founding fathers of [[Turkish nationalism]] and an ideologue of Pan-Turkism, after 1923 he became an passionate ideologue of [[Kemalism]]. He taught in the community schools, and entered active politics in the [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP). He served in the city council. Tekinalp ran for the general elections in [[Turkish general election, 1954|1954]] and [[Turkish general election, 1957|1957]], however he could not enter the parliament. He served as the secretary general of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce. He wrote for the newspapers ''[[Cumhuriyet]]'', ''[[Vatan]]'', ''[[Akşam]]'', ''[[Hürriyet]]'' and ''[[Son Posta]]''.&lt;ref name="bd"/&gt;

He was a proponent of minorities within the [[Turkey|Turkish Republic]] ''Turk-ifying'' themselves, and wrote such in his pamphlet ''Türkleştirme'' (1928). He presented the principles of Kemalism in a book published in Istanbul in 1936, then updated and translated into French one year later, with a preface by [[Édouard Herriot]] (''Le Kémalisme'', Paris: Félix Alcan Publisher, 1937).&lt;ref name="jml"/&gt;

'''The National Catholic Bioethics Center''' is a research center located in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. Established in 1972, its mission is promoting and safeguarding the dignity of the human person, thereby sharing in the ministry of Jesus Christ and his Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbcenter.org/page.aspx?pid=245 Mission of the NCBC]&lt;/ref&gt; The chairman of the Board of Directors is the Most Reverend [[Robert C. Morlino]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbcenter.org/board.asp Board of the NCBC]&lt;/ref&gt; bishop of [[Diocese of Madison, Wisconsin|Madison, Wisconsin]]. The Center publishes ''Ethics &amp; Medics'' and ''[[The National Catholic Bioethics Quarterly]]'', as well as books, including the ''Handbook on Critical Life Issues''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbcenter.org/aboutus.asp About the National Catholic Bioethics Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The founding president of the Center was the Rev. Albert S. Moraczewski, O.P. A library, named in his honor, was dedicated in 2007. The current president, who was named by Pope Benedict XVI in June 2010 as a member of the [[Pontifical Academy for Life]], is John M. Haas, Ph.D. The staff of six professional ethicists responds to over 600 requests each year for advice on moral issues of concern to Catholics and other interested parties via e-mail, phone, and letter. The Center also provides moral analysis to the offices of the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] (USCCB) and to the dicastries of the [[Holy See]].

In a 1999 article of ''Ethics and Medics'', it was argued that "as parents have a moral obligation to secure the life and health of their children", so too do they "have a moral obligation to provide vaccinations to their children."&lt;ref&gt;Furton, Edward J., "Vaccines Originating in Abortion", ''Ethics and Medics'', vol.24, no.3, March 1999&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The departments of the Center include education, publications, research and public policy. The educational department administers ''The National Catholic Certification Program in Health Care Ethics'', a year-long distance learning program that educates candidates in the fundamentals of Catholic medical-moral teaching, with special emphasis on the application of the ''Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services,'' a document of the USCCB designed to guide Catholic health care institutions.

The '''''Oration on the Dignity of Man''''' (''De hominis dignitate'') is a famous [[public discourse]] composed in 1486 by [[Pico della Mirandola]], an Italian scholar and [[philosopher]] of the [[Renaissance]]. It remained unpublished until 1496.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pico-della-mirandola/&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Pico Project,'' a collaboration between [[University of Bologna]], Italy, and [[Brown University]], United States, dedicated to the ''Oration'', and others have called it the "Manifesto of the Renaissance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Italian_Studies/pico/presentaz/eng.html|title=Introduction in English|website=www.brown.edu|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://brians.wsu.edu/2016/11/14/pico-della-mirandola-oration-on-the-dignity-of-man-15th-c-ce/|title=Pico Della Mirandola: Oration On the Dignity Of Man (15th C. CE)|last=Brians|first=Paul|date=|website=|access-date=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pico, who belonged to the family that had long dwelt in the Castle of [[Mirandola]], left his share of the ancestral principality to his two brothers to devote himself wholly to study. In his fourteenth year, 1477, he went to Bologna accompanied by his mother to study canon law and fit himself for the ecclesiastical career. Following his mother's death in 1478, Pico in 1479 requested from the [[Federico I Gonzaga, Marquess of Mantua|Marquess of Mantua]] a free passage to [[Ferrara]], where he would devote himself to the study of philosophy and theology. He spent the following seven years variously in Ferrara, [[Padua]], [[Florence]] and [[Paris]], studying Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Syriac, and Arabic at the chief universities of Italy and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Italian_Studies/pico/crono.html|title=Cronologia|website=www.brown.edu|access-date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

===The potential of human achievement===
Pico's ''Oration'' attempted to remap the human landscape to center all attention on human capacity and human perspective. Arriving in a place near Florence, he taught the amazing capacity of human achievement. "Pico himself had a massive intellect and studied everything there was to be studied in the university curriculum of the Renaissance; the ''Oration'' in part is meant to be a preface to a massive compendium of all the intellectual achievements of humanity, a compendium that never appeared because of Pico's early death."{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Dignity of the liberal arts===
Pico della Mirandola intended to speak in front of an invited audience of scholars and clerics of the dignity of the liberal arts and about the glory of angels. Of these angels he spoke of three divisions in particular: the [[Seraphim]], [[Cherubim]], and [[Thrones]]. These are the highest three [[Christian angelic hierarchy|choirs]] in the angel hierarchy, each one embodying a different virtue. The Seraphim represent charity, and in order to obtain the status of Seraphim, Mirandola declares that one must "burn with love for the Creator". The Cherubim represent intelligence. This status is obtained through contemplation and meditation. Finally, Thrones represent justice, and this is obtained by being just in ruling over "inferior things". Of these three, the Thrones is the lowest, Cherubim the middle, and Seraphim the highest. In this speech, Mirandola emphasizes the Cherubim and that by embodying the values of the Cherub, one can be equally prepared for "the fire of the Seraphim and the judgement of the Thrones". This deviation into the hierarchy of angels makes sense when Pico della Mirandola makes his point that a philosopher "is a creature of [[Heaven]] and not of earth" because they are capable of obtaining any one of the statuses.&lt;ref&gt;http://bactra.org/Mirandola/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Importance of human quest for knowledge===
In the ''Oration'', Pico justified the importance of the human quest for knowledge within a Neoplatonic framework. He writes that after God had created all creatures, He conceived of the desire for another sentient being who would appreciate all His works, but there was no longer any room in the [[chain of being]]; all the possible slots from angels to worms had been filled. So, God created man such that he had no specific slot in the chain. Instead, men were capable of learning from and imitating any existing creature. When man philosophizes, he ascends the chain of being towards the angels, and communion with God. When he fails to exercise his intellect, he vegetates. Pico did not fail to notice that this system made philosophers like himself among the most dignified human creatures.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

The idea that men could ascend the chain of being through the exercise of their intellectual capacities was a profound endorsement of the dignity of human existence in this earthly life. The root of this dignity lay in his assertion that only human beings could change themselves through their own [[free will]], whereas all other changes in nature were the result of some outside force acting on whatever it is that undergoes change. He observed from history that philosophies and institutions were always in change, making man's capacity for self-transformation the only constant. Coupled with his belief that all of creation constitutes a symbolic reflection of the divinity of God, Pico's philosophies had a profound influence on the arts, helping to elevate writers and painters from their medieval role as mere artisans to the Renaissance ideal of the artist as genius.

===Introduction to Pico's 900 theses===
The ''Oration'' also served as an introduction to Pico's 900 theses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://en.calameo.com/read/001554655ffe07d58692b|title=Pico's 900 Theses|work=calameo.com|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which he believed to provide a complete and sufficient basis for the discovery of all knowledge, and hence a model for mankind's ascent of the chain of being. The 900 Theses are a good example of humanist syncretism, because Pico combined [[Platonism]], [[Neoplatonism]], [[Aristotelianism]], [[Hermeticism]] and [[Kabbalah]]. They also included 72 theses describing what Pico believed to be a complete system of physics. Pico also argued in this oration that his youth should not discredit any of the content of his 900 theses (he was in his twenties).

Pico had "cosmic ambitions": in his letters and early texts, he hinted that debate of the 900 theses (the first printed book ever universally banned by the Church) might trigger Christ's Second Coming and the end of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Syncretism in the West: Pico's 900 Theses (1486): The Evolution of Traditional Religious and Philosophical Systems|last=Farmer|first=Stephen A|publisher=ACMRS Publications; 1 edition|year=1998|isbn=0866982094|volume=Book 167|location=Tempe, Arizona|pages=39-46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Copenhaver|first=Brian|title=Giovanni Pico della Mirandola|date=2016|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2016/entries/pico-della-mirandola/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2016|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Pope Innocent VIII|Innocent VIII]] condemned the theses in general but declared the author to be free from censure. This was written in August 5, 1487 but it was not issued until the following December. In a letter to [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo]] dated August 27, 1489, Pico affirms among other things some of his thesis refer purely to profane matters and were never intended for general reading, but for private debate among the learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=1883|title=An Early Humanist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7FlDAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA500&amp;lpg|journal=The Atlantic Monthly|publisher=Houghton, Mifflin and company - The Riverside Press|volume=51|page=500-501|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mystical vocation of humanity===
In the ''Oration'' he writes that "human vocation is a mystical vocation that has to be realized following a three stage way, which comprehends necessarily moral transformation, intellectual research and final perfection in the identity with the absolute reality. This paradigm is universal, because it can be retraced in every tradition."&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Pier Cesare Bori. "[http://didattica.spbo.unibo.it/pais/bori/articolo010.html The Italian Renaissance: An Unfinished Dawn?: Pico della Mirandola] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229231307/http://didattica.spbo.unibo.it/pais/bori/articolo010.html |date=2007-12-29 }}". Accessed December 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pico defends philosophy===
Here Pico explains why he chose to become a philosopher. A paraphrase of paragraph 24:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
These are the reasons why I decided to study philosophy. And I'm not going to explain them to anyone except those who condemn philosophy. Philosophy is not something to be used scornfully or as insult, but for honor and glory. People are beginning to think wrongly in that philosophy should only be studied by very few, if any at all, as if it is something of little worth. We have reduced philosophy to only being useful when being used for profit. I say these things with regret and indignation for the philosophers who say it should not be pursued because it has no value, thus disqualifying themselves as philosophers. Since they are in it for their own personal gain, they miss the truth for its own sake. I'm going to say, not to brag, but I've never philosophized except for the sake of philosophy, and have never desired it for my own cultivation. I have been able to lose myself in philosophy and not be influenced by others who try to pull me away from it. Philosophy has taught me to rely on my own convictions rather than on the judgments of others and to concern myself less with whether I am well thought of than whether what I do or say is evil.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Delivery==

Pico was prevented from holding his Oration. It was penned as the opening speech for a public disputation of his 900 theses, planned for early 1487, but Pope Innocent VIII suspended the event and instead set up a commission to examine the theses for heresy. A presentation of the full text in English in front of a live audience read by Sebastian Michael took place at [[TU Wien]] (University of Technology Vienna) as part of the opening event of the first Sophistication Conference organised by the Department for Architecture Theory and Philosophy of Technics on 7 December 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.attp.tuwien.ac.at/interne-veranstaltungen/sophistication-conference|title=Conference: Sophistication: Rhetorical, Geometrical, and Computational "Articulation"|last=|first=|date=|website=ATTP TU Wien|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=12 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In [[Indian philosophy]], '''Paroksha''' refers to mediate knowledge or indirect cognition, mediated by sensory-intellectual apparatus, in which thought systems psychological insights that have evolved in the context of two levels of realities, empirical and transcendental, are gained through both direct cognition and indirect cognition of things that exist in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychology in India Vol. IV|author=Girishwar Misra|publisher=Pearson Education India|page=107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fXQzo7LGfuIC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=paroksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sFk5UYrGOYWGrAeA1ICYCA&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=paroksha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
This [[Sanskrit]] expression made up of two words – ''Para'' (beyond) and ''Aksha'' (eye), literally means beyond the eye i.e. beyond the range of sight. Therefore, it also means invisible, remote, hidden or mysterious. 
The [[Aitareya Brahmana]] VII.30 gives its meaning as "mysterious" and "mystery" – "''tan nayogrohan santan nyogrodhan ity achakshate parokshena, paroksha-priya iva hi deva''" (The nyogodha is called nyogrodha after the mysterious (etymology) for the gods like mystery.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=On the History and Literature of the Veda: Book review|volume=16|publisher=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal|page=846|date= July–December 1847|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VhkYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA846&amp;dq=paroksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sFk5UYrGOYWGrAeA1ICYCA&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=paroksha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Understanding some schools==

===Caravakas===
The [[Caravaka]] school of thought which does not believe in causation and its universality, advocating naïve realism and empiricism rejects [[inference]] as a means of valid knowledge because it depends upon ''[[vyapti]]'' i.e. the universal concomitance between the middle term and the major term, and because one ''vyapti'' is based on another ''vyapti'' thus involving an infinite argument. According to this school ''vyapti'' can only be known through perception of perceptible things alone and therefore, perception is the only means of valid knowledge. This school does not consider imperceptible things to exist.

===Buddhism===
[[Gautama Buddha]] is believed to have directed all monks and scholars to thoroughly analyze his words and not adopt them for the sake of respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Debate in Tibetan Buddhism|author=Dan Perdue|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|page=179|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MPSL-Ac-RrEC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=paroksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_Gw5UeuvN8fIrQfB5oDIBQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=paroksha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He taught rationalism and trust in one's own reasoning and belief, and spoke about the distinction between the mere reception of truth and the knowledge of truth which involves rational conviction.&lt;ref&gt;Amguttaranikaya, Kalamasutta&lt;/ref&gt; The later Buddhist thinkers such as the [[Sautrantika]]s, opposed to the [[Yogacara]]s who deny the reality of external objects reducing them to cognitions, advocating indirect realism recognized the reality of external objects which produced their own cognitions and imprinted their forms on them as being basically perceptible; they developed the doctrine of impermanence into the ontological doctrine of momentariness&lt;ref&gt;Saddarsanasamgraha ii.45-47&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dharmakirti]] considered the so-called external objects as mere sensations, that all object-cognitions are due to the revival of the sub-conscious impressions deposited in the mind which are not excited by external objects. The [[Madhyamaka]]s regard external objects and subjective cognitions to be equally essenceless with [[Sunya]] as their eternal basis and reject the plurality of external objects and internal cognitions because of their relativity. Buddha’s teachings lend support to the three valid cognizers which are the three consciousnesses that comprehend the manifest (visible phenomena), the slightly hidden phenomena or ''kimchid-paroksha'' (which can be inferred) and the very hidden phenomena or ''atyartha-paroksha'' (which is known through the power of belief).

===Jainism===
The followers of the [[Jain]] School of Thought consider knowledge as emanating from the soul to be ''[[Pratyaksha]]'' (direct cognition) and the knowledge which is inherited from the senses, ''Paroksha'' (indirect cognition); paroksha-knowledge is gained with the help of the mind and senses (''Mati'') or through what is heard or learnt (''[[Shruti]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Indology|author=V.B.Srivastava|page=111|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eaCbv1NcbHwC&amp;pg=PT111&amp;dq=paroksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sFk5UYrGOYWGrAeA1ICYCA&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this school Mediate knowledge (Paroksha), which is Valid knowledge ([[Pramana]]),  though indistinct and devoid of perceptual vividness, is of five kinds – Recollection that determines the real nature of an object perceived in the past, Recognition that knows a present perceived object as known in the past, Induction which is knowledge of the past invariable ''vyapti'' arising from the observation of their co-presence and co-absence, Deduction or Inference ([[anumana]]) which is based on ''vyapti'' derived induction and Testimony is the knowledge of objects derived from words of reliable persons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Outlines of Indian Philosophy|author=Jadunath Sinha|publisher=Pilgrim Books (P) Ltd.|pages=124–5|url= http://www.pilgrimsbookhouse.com/xauthordetailsnew.php?mauthor=Jadunath%20Sinha}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are all secondary sources that involve conceptualization of the object of knowledge by means of rational or analytical thought processes. Thus, Paroksha is second-hand knowledge.

===Hinduism===

====Advaita====
According to the [[Advaita]] school ''Paroksha'' consists in the intellectual assent to a stated proposition and ''[[Aparoksha]]'' consists in the actual realization of that proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Five years of Theosophy|author=G.R.S.Mead|publisher=Echo Library|page=119|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lQ4OyHZvU_sC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=paroksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z6A5UeTxMob3rQfSrYCYDg&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=paroksha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Paroksha'' there is the distinction between the subjective concept and the objective reality which that concept represents in consciousness but which distinction is irrelevant in the case of ''[[Aparoksha]]'' knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mystical Philosophy of the Upanishads|author=Sris Chandra Sen|publisher=Genesis Publishing (P) Ltd.|page=197|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xnhNZQJ07DYC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=paroksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=D6Q5UfOzFo60rAfa14DIBg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwATgo#v=onepage&amp;q=paroksha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; A man is said to attain ''paroksha'' (indirect) wisdom when he knows (theoretically) that [[Brahman]] exists; but he is said to attain ''sakshatkara'' (direct cognition) when he knows (or realises) that he is himself Brahman. Then, he becomes [[Jivanmukta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Upanishads|author=Swami Parmeshwaranand|page=896|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1zQytiw_cg8C&amp;pg=PA896&amp;dq=paroksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QKg5UavZKIzirAeGkIG4DA&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAzgy#v=onepage&amp;q=paroksha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vedanta]] conveys the ''aparoksha'' Absolute in a ''paroksha'' way which is a valid way because while referring to certain facts about Brahman ''paroksha'' does not refer to unrealities. In [[Srimad-Bhagavatam]] (XI.xxi.35) it refers to the indirect (''proksha'') statements of the [[rishi]]s. The [[rishi]]s of the [[Vedas]] are found to speak variously about Brahman in an indirect manner (''proksha-vada'') e.g. "''The eye, O Emperor, is the Supreme Brahman''" or "''This being who is in the right eye is named Indha. Though he is Indha , he is indirectly called Indra, for the gods have a fondness, as it were, for indirect names, and hate to be called indirectly''".&lt;ref&gt;[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] IV.i.4 &amp; IV.ii.3&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''paroksha'' is "This", and ''aparoksha'' is "That" of the [[Upanishads]]. ''Paroksha wisdom'' or mediate knowledge, which is right perception, does not liberate a person from [[Saṃsāra]] but it is confirmed by ''Aparoksha wisdom''. The ''paroksha-vada'' (indirect injunctions) of the Vedic rishis indirectly leads one to the path of liberation Srimad-Bhagavatam (XI.iii.44).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Libration from the Illusory Energy|url=http://vedabase.net/sb/11/3/44/en1|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430125255/http://vedabase.net/sb/11/3/44/en1|archivedate=2015-04-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Bhagavad Gita]] XIII.12-13, [[Krishna]] tells [[Arjuna]] about that which is to be known, and also about that by realizing which one attains immortality. This is ''paroksha wisdom'' by which the attention of the listener is aroused and the fruit of such knowledge is indicated viz - the knowledge of the knowable beginningless attributeless Brahman gaining which one gains the ''aparoksha wisdom'', the knowledge of the Knower of the field, Brahman who exists but transcends all verbal expressions, who cannot be expressed in terms like existence and non-existence.

[[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] explains that Krishna objectifies the acosmic through the process of superimposition and sublation by designating Brahman as the field-knower by employing the adjunct, field, variously pluralised due to hands, feet, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srimad Bhagavad Gita Shankara-Bhasya|pages=539–546|url= https://www.scribd.com/doc/17299929/Srimad-Bhagavad-Gita-Shankara-Bhashya-English#page=503}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brahman]] is to be realised as existing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Katha Upanishad]] VI.13&lt;/ref&gt; And, [[Badarayana]] ([[Brahma Sutras]] III.ii.15) states that like light, the non-dual formless Brahman in connection with [[Upadhi]]s (limiting adjuncts) appears to have a form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahma-Sutras (with translation and commentary)|author=Badarayana|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=295–6|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/59726719/BRAHMA-SUTRAS-According-to-Sri-Sankara-translated-by-Swami-Vireswarananda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prajñā''' ([[Sanskrit]]) or '''paññā''' ([[Pāli]]) "wisdom" is insight in the true nature of reality, namely primarily [[anicca]] (impermanence), [[dukkha]] (dissatisfaction or suffering), [[anatta|anattā]] (non-self) and [[śūnyatā]] (emptiness).

==Etymology==
''Prajñā'' is often translated as "wisdom", but is closer in meaning to "insight", "non-discriminating knowledge", or "intuitive apprehension".{{sfn|Keown|2003|p=218}}

* ''jñā'' can be translated as "consciousness", "knowledge", or "understanding".&lt;ref group=web&gt;See, e.g., Monier-Williams (1899), "jña," p. 425 (retrieved 14 August 2012 from "Cologne U." at [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/MWScanpdf/mw0425-jehila.pdf mw0425-jehila.pdf]).&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''Pra'' is an intensifier which can be translated as "higher", "greater", "supreme" or "premium",&lt;ref group=web&gt;See, e.g., Monier-Williams (1899), "prā," p. 652 (retrieved 14 Aug. 2012 from "Cologne U." at http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/monier/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0659-prajalpana.jpg)&lt;/ref&gt; or "being born or springing up",{{sfn|Loy|1997|p=136}} referring to a spontaneous type of knowing.{{sfn|Loy|1997|p=136}}

==Understanding in the Buddhist traditions==
''Paññā'' is the fourth virtue of ten Theravāda ''[[pāramitā|pāramitās]]'', and the sixth of the six Mahāyāna ''pāramitās''.

===Theravada Buddhism===
In the [[Pāli Canon]], ''paññā'' is [[Samādhi|concentrated]] [[vipassana|insight]] into the [[Three marks of existence|three characteristics]] of all things, namely [[anicca|impermanence]], [[dukkha|suffering]] and [[anatta|no-self]], and the [[Four Noble Truths|four noble truths]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title=Nirvana and Other Buddhist Felicities |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2go_y5KYyoC |year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-57054-1 |pages=140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Gombrich|title=Theravada Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZyJAgAAQBAJ|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-90352-8|page=47}}, '''Quote:''' "All phenomenal existence [in Buddhism] is said to have three interlocking characteristics: impermanence, suffering and lack of soul or essence."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl Olson|title=The Different Paths of Buddhism: A Narrative-Historical Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QRp-AixBLKUC |year=2005|publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=978-0-8135-3778-8 |pages=63–64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 5th-century exegetical work ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'', one of the most revered books in Theravada Buddhism, [[Buddhaghosa|Buddhaghoṣa]] states that the function of ''paññā'' is "to abolish the darkness of [[Avidya (Buddhism)|delusion]]".{{sfn|Buddhaghosa|Ñāṇamoli|1999|p=437}}

===Mahāyāna Buddhism===
{{See also|Svatantrika–Prasaṅgika distinction}}
In Mahayana Buddhism, the importance of prajna was stressed in combination with [[Karuṇā|karuna]], compassion. It took a central place in the ''[[Perfection of Wisdom|Prajñā-pāramitā Sutras]]'', such as the [[Heart Sutra]]. Prajna is spoken of as the principal means of attaining [[Nirvana (concept)|nirvāna]], through its revelation of the true nature of all things as [[Sunyata|emptiness]].

He was born of humble parents at [[Stradbroke]] in [[Suffolk]]. Upon his death, he was almost universally revered as a saint in England, but attempts to procure a formal canonization failed. [[Alistair Cameron Crombie|A.&amp;nbsp;C. Crombie]] calls him "the real founder of the tradition of scientific thought in medieval [[Oxford]], and in some ways, of the modern English intellectual tradition".

==Scholarly career==
[[File:Grosseteste-color.png|right|200px|thumb|An image of Grosseteste from a late-14th-century [[illuminated manuscript]].&lt;ref&gt;Grosseteste, ''{{lang|la|Dicta CXLVII}}'' &amp;c. ([http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/ILLUMIN.ASP?Size=mid&amp;IllID=39914 Royal 6 E p.&amp;nbsp;116]).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
There is very little direct evidence about Grosseteste's education. He may have received a [[liberal arts education]] at Hereford, in light of his connection with the Bishop of Hereford [[William de Vere]] in the 1190s and a recommendation from [[Gerald of Wales]]. It is fairly certain that Grosseteste was a ''master'' by 1192, but whether that indicated that he had completed a course of studies is unclear. Grosseteste acquired a position in the bishop's household, but at the death of this patron he disappears from the historical record for several years. He appears again in the early thirteenth century as a judge-delegate in Hereford, but there are no surviving details of where he resided or whether he had continued to study.

By 1225, he had gained the [[benefice]] of [[Abbotsley]] in the [[diocese of Lincoln]], by which time he was a deacon. On that period in his life, scholarship is divided. Some historians argue that he began his teaching career in theology at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] in this year, whereas others have more recently argued that he used the income of his ecclesiastical post to support studies in theology at the [[University of Paris]]. However, there is clear evidence that by 1229/30 he was teaching at Oxford, but on the periphery as the [[lector]] in theology to the [[Franciscans]], who had established a [[convent]] in Oxford about 1224. He remained in this post until March 1235.

Grosseteste may also have been appointed [[Chancellor of the University of Oxford]]. However, the evidence for this comes from a late thirteenth century anecdote whose main claim is that Grosseteste was in fact entitled the master of students (''magister scholarium'').

At the same time he began lecturing in theology at Oxford, [[Hugh of Wells]], Bishop of Lincoln, appointed him as [[List of Archdeacons of Leicester|Archdeacon of Leicester]],&lt;ref name=BHOArchLeicester&gt;[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=33569 British History Online Archdeacons of Leicester] accessed on 28 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and he also gained a [[prebend]] that made him a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] in [[Lincoln Cathedral]]. However, after a severe illness in 1232, he resigned all his benefices (Abbotsley and Leicester), but retained his prebend. His reasons were due to changing attitudes about the plurality of benefices (holding more than one ecclesiastical position simultaneously), and after seeking advice from the [[Roman Curia|papal court]], he tendered his resignations. The angry response of his friends and colleagues to his resignations took him by surprise and he complained to his sister and to his closest friend, the Franciscan [[Adam Marsh]], that his intentions had been completely misunderstood.

As a master of the sacred page (manuscripts of theology in Latin), Grosseteste trained the Franciscans in the standard curriculum of university theology. The Franciscan [[Roger Bacon]] was his most famous disciple, and acquired an interest in the scientific method from him.&lt;ref&gt;John Freely, ''Aladdin's Lamp: How Greek Science Came to Europe Through the Islamic World'', Alfred A. Knopf, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Grosseteste lectured on the [[Psalter]], the [[Pauline epistles]], [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] (at least the [[Genesis creation myth|creation account]]), and possibly on [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] and [[Wisdom of Sirach|Sirach]]. He also led disputations on such subjects as the theological nature of truth and the efficacy of the [[613 Commandments|Mosaic Law]]. Grosseteste also preached at the university and appears to have been called to preach within the diocese as well. He collected some of those sermons, along with some short notes and reflections, not long after he left Oxford; this is now known as his ''Dicta''. His theological writings reveal a continual interest in the natural world as a major resource for theological reflection and an ability to read Greek sources (if he ever learned Hebrew, it would be not until he became bishop of Lincoln). His theological index (''tabula distinctionum'') reveals the breadth of his learning and his desire to communicate it in a systematic manner. However, Grosseteste's own style was far more unstructured than many of his scholastic contemporaries, and his writings reverberate with his own personal views and outlooks.

==Bishop of Lincoln==
[[File:Bishop Robert Grosseteste, 1896.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=1896|A 19th-century portrait of Robert Grosseteste in [[stained glass]]]]
In February 1235, Hugh of Wells died, and the canons of [[Diocese of Lincoln|Lincoln cathedral]] met to elect his successor. They soon were at a deadlock and could not reach a majority. Fearing that the election would be taken out of their hands, they settled on a compromise candidate, Grosseteste. He was consecrated in June of that same year&lt;ref name=Handbook255&gt;Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]].&lt;ref name=BHOLincoln&gt;[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=33560 British History Online Bishops of Lincoln] accessed on 28 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He instituted an innovative programme of visitation, a procedure normally reserved for the inspection of monasteries. Grosseteste expanded it to include all the [[deanery|deaneries]] in each archdeaconry of his vast diocese. The scheme brought him into conflict with more than one privileged corporation, in particular with his own chapter, who vigorously disputed his claim to exercise the right of visitation over their community. The dispute raged hotly from 1239 to 1245, with the chapter launching an appeal to the papacy. In 1245, while attending the [[First Council of Lyons]], the papal court ruled in favour of Grosseteste. [[Dean of Lincoln|Dean]] [[William de Thornaco]] is recorded as being suspended by [[Bishop of Lincoln|Bishop]] Grosseteste in 1239, together with [[precentor]] and [[subdean]] in relation to the aforementioned matter.

In ecclesiastical politics the bishop belonged to the school of [[Thomas a Becket|Becket]]. His zeal for reform led him to advance, on behalf of the courts, Christian pretensions which it was impossible that the secular power should admit. He twice incurred a rebuke from [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] upon this subject although it was left for [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] to settle the question of principle in favour of the state. The devotion of Grosseteste to the hierarchical theories of his age is attested by his correspondence with his chapter and the king. Against the former he upheld the prerogative of the bishops; against the latter he asserted that it was impossible for a bishop to disregard the commands of the Holy See. Where the liberties of the national church came into conflict with the pretensions of Rome he stood by his own countrymen.

Thus in 1238 he demanded that the King should release certain Oxford scholars who had assaulted the [[Papal legate|legate]] [[Otto Candidus]]. But at least up to the year 1247 he submitted patiently to papal encroachments, contenting himself with the protection (by a special papal privilege) of his own diocese from alien clerks. Of royal exactions he was more impatient; and, after the retirement of Archbishop [[Edmund Rich|(Saint) Edmund]], constituted himself the spokesman of the clerical estate in the Great Council.

In 1244 he sat on a committee which was empanelled to consider a demand for a subsidy. The committee rejected the demand, and Grosseteste foiled an attempt on the king's part to separate the clergy from the [[baron]]age. "It is written", the bishop said, "that united we stand and divided we fall."

The last years of Grosseteste's life and episcopacy were embroiled in a conflict with the new [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Boniface of Savoy (archbishop)|Boniface of Savoy]]. In 1250, he travelled to the papal court, where one of the cardinals read his complaints at an audience with [[Innocent IV]]. He claimed not only that Boniface was threatening the health of the church but also that the pope was just as guilty for not reining him in and that that was symptomatic of the current malaise of the entire church. Most observers noted the personal animus between the bishop of Lincoln and the pope, but it did not stop the pope from agreeing to most of Grosseteste's demands about the way the English church ought to function.

Grosseteste continued to keep a watchful eye on ecclesiastical events. In 1251 he protested against a papal mandate enjoining the English clergy to pay Henry III one-tenth of their revenues for a [[crusade]]; and called attention to the fact that, under the system of provisions, a sum of 70,000 marks was annually drawn from England by the alien nominees of Rome. In 1253, upon being commanded to provide in his own diocese for a papal nephew, he wrote a letter of expostulation and refusal, not to the pope himself but to the commissioner, Master Innocent, through whom he received the mandate. The text of the remonstrance, as given in the Burton Annals and in Matthew Paris, has possibly been altered by a forger who had less respect than Grosseteste for the papacy. The language is more violent than that which the bishop elsewhere employs. But the general argument, that the papacy may command obedience only so far as its commands are consonant with the teaching of Christ and the apostles, is only what should be expected from an ecclesiastical reformer of Grosseteste's time. There is much more reason for suspecting the letter addressed "to the nobles of England, the citizens of London, and the community of the whole realm", in which Grosseteste is represented as denouncing in unmeasured terms papal finance in all its branches. But even in this case allowance must be made for the difference between modern and medieval standards of decorum.

[[File:Grosseteste Chapel.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Grosseteste's Tomb and Chapel in Lincoln Cathedral]]

Grosseteste numbered among his most intimate friends the Franciscan teacher, [[Adam Marsh]]. Through Adam he came into close relations with [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]]. From the Franciscan's letters it appears that the earl had studied a political tract by Grosseteste on the difference between a monarchy and a [[tyranny]] and that he embraced with enthusiasm the bishop's projects of ecclesiastical reform. Their alliance began as early as 1239, when Grosseteste exerted himself to bring about a reconciliation between the king and the earl. But there is no reason to suppose that the political ideas of Montfort had matured before the death of Grosseteste; nor did Grosseteste busy himself overmuch with secular politics, except insofar as they touched the interest of the Church. Grosseteste realised that the misrule of Henry III and his unprincipled compact with the papacy largely accounted for the degeneracy of the English hierarchy and the laxity of ecclesiastical discipline. But he can hardly be termed a [[Constitutionalism|constitutionalist]].

==Death and burial==
Grosseteste died on 9 October 1253&lt;ref name=Handbook255/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ii3Rs56pE2wC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=%22Lincoln+cathedral%22+grosseteste&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eItZkhKvVD&amp;sig=b_wYTijjldTByiRJh7bRClnerrI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=obuGU7K6HImv7Ab_6YDwBQ&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBDgo#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Lincoln%20cathedral%22%20grosseteste&amp;f=false James McEvoy, ''Robert Grosseteste'' (Oxford University Press 2000] {{ISBN|978-0-19535417-1}}), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; He was aged between seventy and eighty.

He is buried in a tomb within his memorial chapel within Lincoln Cathedral. Its dedicatory plaque reads as follows:

{{quotation|In this place lies the body of ROBERT GROSSETESTE who was born at Stradbroke in Suffolk, studied in the University of Paris&amp;nbsp;– and in 1224 became Chancellor of Oxford University where he befriended and taught the newly founded orders of Friars : In 1229 he became Archdeacon of Leicester and a Canon of this Cathedral&amp;nbsp;– reigning as Bishop of Lincoln from 17th. June 1235 until his death.
&lt;br /&gt;
He was a man of learning and an inspiration to scholars a wise administrator while a true shepherd of his flock, ever concerned to lead them to Christ in whose service he strove to temper justice with mercy, hating the sin while loving the sinner, not sparing the rod though cherishing the weak&amp;nbsp;– He died on 8th. October 1253.}}

==Reputation and legacy==
Grosseteste was already an elderly man, with a firmly established reputation, when he became a bishop. As an ecclesiastical [[wikt:statesman|statesman]], he showed the same fiery zeal and versatility of which he had given proof in his academic career; but the general tendency of modern writers has been to exaggerate his political and ecclesiastical services, and to neglect his performance as a scientist and scholar. The opinion of his own age, as expressed by [[Matthew Paris]] and [[Roger Bacon]], was very different. His contemporaries, while admitting the excellence of his intentions as a statesman, lay stress upon his defects of temper and discretion. But they see in him the pioneer of a literary and scientific movement; not merely a great ecclesiastic who patronised learning in his leisure hours, but the first mathematician and [[physicist]] of his age. He anticipated, in these fields of thought, some of the striking ideas to which Roger Bacon subsequently gave a wider currency.

[[Bishop Grosseteste University]], a stone's throw away from [[Lincoln Cathedral]], is named after Robert Grosseteste. The university provides Initial Teacher Training and academic degrees at all levels. In 2003, it hosted an international conference on Grosseteste in honour of the 750th anniversary of his death.

==Works==
Grosseteste wrote a number of early works in Latin and French while he was a clerk ([[#Biography|see biography above]]), including one called ''Chasteau d'amour'', an allegorical poem on the creation of the world and Christian redemption, as well as several other poems and texts on household management and courtly etiquette. He also wrote a number of theological works including the influential ''[[Hexaëmeron]]'' in the 1230s.  He was also a highly regarded author of manuals on pastoral care and produced treatises that dealt with a variety of penitential contexts, including monasteries, the parish and a bishop's household.

However, Grosseteste is best known as an original thinker for his work concerning what would today be called science or the [[scientific method]].

From about 1220 to 1235 he wrote a host of scientific treatises including:

*''De sphera''. An introductory text on astronomy.
*''De luce''. On the "metaphysics of light." (which is the most original work of [[cosmogony]] in the Latin West)
*''De accessu et recessu maris''. On tides and tidal movements. (although some scholars dispute his authorship)
*''De lineis, angulis et figuris''. Mathematical reasoning in the natural sciences.
*''De iride''. On the rainbow.

In 1242, having been introduced to the Greek work by [[John of Basingstoke]], Grosseteste had the ''[[Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs]]'' brought from Greece and translated it with help of a clerk of St. Albans:
{{quote|for the strengthening of the christian {{sic}} faith and the confusion of the Jews [who were said to have deliberately hidden the book away] ... on account of the manifest prophecies of Christ contained therein.{{sfn|Archer|1885}} }}

He also wrote a number of commentaries on [[Aristotle]], including the first in the West of ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'', and one on Aristotle's ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', which has survived as a loose collection of notes or glosses on the text. Moreover, he did a lot of very interesting work on [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]]'s Celestial Hierarchy: he translated both the text and the scholia from Greek into Latin and wrote a commentary &lt;ref&gt;See the edition by D. A. Lawell, Versio Caelestis Hierarchiae Pseudo-Dionysii Areopagitae cum scholiis ex Graeco sumptis necnon commentariis notulisque eiusdem Lincolniensis (= Corpus Christianorum. Continuatio Mediaevalis 268), Turnhout: Brepols Publishers, 2015 ({{ISBN|978-2-503-55593-5}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science===
It has been argued that Grosseteste played a key role in the development of the scientific method. Grosseteste did introduce to the Latin West the notion of controlled experiment and related it to [[Scientific demonstration|demonstrative science]], as one among many ways of arriving at such knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2010/entries/grosseteste/|title=Robert Grosseteste|first=Lewis,|last=Neil|date=|website=plato.stanford.edu|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Grosseteste did not always follow his own advice during his investigations, his work is seen as instrumental in the history of the development of the Western scientific tradition.

Grosseteste was the first of the [[Scholastics]] to fully understand [[Aristotle]]'s vision of the dual path of scientific reasoning: generalising from particular observations into a universal law, and then back again from universal laws to prediction of particulars. Grosseteste called this "resolution and composition". So, for example, looking at the particulars of the moon, it is possible to arrive at universal laws about nature. Conversely once these universal laws are understood, it is possible to make predictions and observations about other objects besides the moon. Grosseteste said further that both paths should be verified through experimentation to verify the principles involved. These ideas established a tradition that carried forward to [[Padua]] and [[Galileo Galilei]] in the 17th century.

As important as "resolution and composition" would become to the future of Western scientific tradition, more important to his own time was his idea of the subordination of the sciences. For example, when looking at geometry and optics, optics is subordinate to geometry because optics depends on geometry, and so optics was a prime example of a subalternate science. Thus Grosseteste concluded, following much of what [[Boethius]] had argued, that mathematics was the highest of all sciences, and the basis for all others, since every natural science ultimately depended on mathematics. He supported this conclusion by looking at light, which he believed to be the "first form" of all things, the source of all generation and motion (approximately what is now known as biology and physics). Hence, since light could be reduced to lines and points, and thus fully explained in the realm of mathematics, mathematics was the highest order of the sciences.

[[File:Optics from Roger Bacon's De multiplicatone specierum.jpg|thumb|[[Optic]] studies from Roger Bacon's ''De multiplicatione specierum''. The diagram shows light being refracted by a spherical glass container full of water.]]

Grosseteste's work in optics was also relevant and would be continued by [[Roger Bacon]], who often mentioned his indebtedness to him although there is no proof that the two ever met. In ''De Iride'' Grosseteste writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This part of optics, when well understood, shows us how we may make things a very long distance off appear as if placed very close, and large near things appear very small, and how we may make small things placed at a distance appear any size we want, so that it may be possible for us to read the smallest letters at incredible distances, or to count sand, or seed, or any sort of minute objects.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Editions of the original Latin text may be found in: ''Die Philosophischen Werke des Robert Grosseteste, Bischofs von Lincoln'' (Münster i. W., Aschendorff, 1912.), p.&amp;nbsp;75.&lt;ref&gt;A reproduction of this text may be found on the website: [http://www.grosseteste.com/index.htm The Electronic Grossteste] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102095121/http://www.grosseteste.com/index.htm |date=2 November 2006 }}&amp;nbsp;– [http://www.grosseteste.com/cgi-bin/textdisplay.cgi?text=de-iride.xml online]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627234624/http://www.grosseteste.com/cgi-bin/textdisplay.cgi?text=de-iride.xml |date=27 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grossesteste is now believed to have had a very modern understanding of colour, and supposed errors in his account have been found to be based on corrupt late copies of his essay on the nature of colour, written in about 1225 (''De Luce''). In 2014 Grosseteste's 1225 treatise ''De Luce'' (''On Light'') was translated from Latin and interpreted by an interdisciplinary project led by Durham University, that included Latinists, philologists, medieval historians, physicists and cosmologists. ''De Luce'' explores the nature of matter and the cosmos. Four centuries before Isaac Newton proposed gravity and seven centuries before the Big Bang theory, Grosseteste described the birth of the Universe in an explosion and the crystallisation of matter to form stars and planets in a set of nested spheres around Earth. ''De Luce'' is the first attempt to describe the heavens and Earth using a single set of physical laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/history-a-medieval-multiverse-1.14837?WT.ec_id=NATURE-20140313|title=Home : Nature Status|author=|date=|website=www.nature.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'Ordered Universe' collaboration of scientists and historians at [[Durham University]] studying medieval science regard him as a key figure in showing that pre-Renaissance science was far more advanced than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21328551.600-medieval-modern-master-colour-decoded-before-its-time.html Michael Brooks, 'Master of Colour], ''New Scientist'', 10 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veneration==
Upon his death, he was almost universally revered as a [[saint (Christianity)|saint]] in England, with [[miracle]]s reported at his [[shrine]] and [[pilgrimage (Christian)|pilgrims]] to it granted an [[indulgence]] by the [[bishop of Lincoln]].{{sfnp|''Cath.

'''Sai Baba of Shirdi''', also known as '''Shirdi Sai Baba''',&lt;!--No evidence of date of birth --&gt; was an [[Indian people|Indian]] spiritual master who is regarded by his devotees as a [[saint]], a [[fakir]], a ''[[satguru]]'' and an incarnation ([[avatar]]) of Lord Shiva and Dattatreya. He is revered by both his [[Hindu]] and [[Muslim]] devotees during, as well as after his lifetime. 
Saibaba is now revered as incarnation of Sri Dattatreya, and considered as Saguna Brahma. He is attributed to be the creator, sustainer and destroyer of this universe by his devotees. He is decorated with jewels and all forms of Hindu vedic deities as he is believed by his followers to be the supreme God.

According to accounts from his life, he preached the importance of ''realization of the self'', and criticized ''love towards perishable things''. His teachings concentrate on a moral code of love, forgiveness, helping others, charity, contentment, inner peace, and devotion to the God and guru. He stressed the importance of surrender to the true ''Satguru'', who, having trod the path to divine consciousness, will lead the disciple through the jungle of spiritual training.&lt;ref name="Sri Sai Satcharitra"&gt;Sri Sai Satcharitra&lt;/ref&gt;

Sai Baba also condemned distinction based on religion or caste. It remains unclear if he was a Muslim or a Hindu. This, however, was of no consequence to Sai Baba.&lt;ref name="Rigopoulos 1993 3"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Life and Teachings of Sai Baba of Shirdi|last=Rigopoulos|first=Antonio|publisher=[[State University of New York Press|SUNY]]|year=1993|isbn=0-7914-1268-7|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; His teaching combined elements of [[Hinduism]] and [[Islam]]: he gave the Hindu name ''Dwarakamayi'' to the mosque in which he lived,&lt;ref name="hoiberg"&gt;{{cite book | author1 = D.

One of his well-known epigrams, ''[[Allah]] [[Malik]]'' (''God is King'') and ''Sabka Malik Ek'' (''Everyone's Master is One''), is associated with both [[Hinduism]] and [[Islam]]. He is also known to have said ''Look to me, and I shall look to you''.&lt;ref name="Sri Sai Satcharitra" /&gt;

==Background==
Sai Baba's date of birth including his birthplace remains unknown and is debatable due to lack of evidence and no definitive information exists to prove it. Most definitive information about Shirdi Sai Baba tends to be derived from a book called Shri Sai Satcharitra written by a disciple called Hemadpant (also known as Annasaheb Dabholkar / Govind Raghunath) in 1922 in Marathi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chronology of evenets - Shirdi Sai Baba |url=http://www.saibaba.ws/avatar/chronology_shirdi_sai_baba.htm |website=www.saibaba.ws |publisher=Saibaba WS |accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book itself is a compilation based on accounts by his various disciples and Hemadpant's personal observations observing Sai Baba from 1910 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Shri Sai Satcharitra - online version |url=http://www.shirdibooks.com/sai-satcharitra-chapters/ |accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sai Baba's real name remains unknown. The name 'Sai' was given to him by ''Mhalsapati'' when he arrived at [[Shirdi]], a town now in the west Indian state of Maharashtra. The word 'Sai' refers to a religious mendicant&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.4:1:5269.platts A dictionary of Urdu, classical Hindi, and English]. Dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu. Retrieved on 2017-06-24.&lt;/ref&gt; but can also mean 'God'. In several Indian and Middle Eastern languages the term 'Baba' is an honorific signifying grandfather, father, old man or sir. Thus Sai Baba denotes ''holy father'', ''saintly father'' or (venerable) poor old man.&lt;ref name="Rigopoulos 1993 3" /&gt;

Some of Sai Baba's disciples became famous as spiritual figures and saints, such as Mhalsapati, a priest of the [[Khandoba]] temple in Shirdi, and [[Upasni Maharaj]]. He was revered by other saints as well, such as Saint Bidkar Maharaj, [[Gagangiri_Maharaj|Saint Gangagir]], Saint Janakidas Maharaj, and Sati Godavari Mataji.&lt;ref&gt;Ruhela, S. P. (ed), ''Truth in Controversies about Sri Shirdi Sai Baba'', Faridabad, Indian Publishers Distributors, 2000. {{ISBN|81-7341-121-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dabholkar, Govind Raghunath 1999"&gt;Dabholkar, Govind Raghunath, ''Shri Sai Satcharita: the life and teachings of Shirdi Sai Baba'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Sai Baba referred to several saints as 'my brothers', especially the disciples of [[Swami Samarth Maharaj|Swami Samartha of Akkalkot]].&lt;ref name="Dabholkar, Govind Raghunath 1999" /&gt;

Although Sai Baba's origins are unknown, some indications exist that suggest that he was born not far from [[Shirdi]]. Historical researches into [[genealogy|genealogies]] in Shirdi give support to the theory that Baba could have been born with the name ''Haribhau Bhusari''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kamath | first1 = M.V. | last2 = Kher |first2= V.B. | title = Sai Baba of Shirdi: A Unique Saint | publisher = India: Jaico Publishing House | year = 1997 | pages = 13–18 | isbn = 81-7224-030-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baba was notorious for giving vague, misleading and contradictory replies to questions concerning his parentage and origins, brusquely stating the information was unimportant. He had reportedly stated to a close follower, Mhalsapati, that he has been born of [[Brahmin]] parents in the village of [[Pathri]] and had been entrusted into the care of a [[fakir]] in his infancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rigopoulos | first = Antonio | title = The Life and Teachings of Sai Baba of Shirdi | publisher = [[State University of New York Press|SUNY]] | year=  1993 | pages = 8 | isbn = 0791412687}}&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion, Baba reportedly said that the fakir's wife had left him in the care of a Hindu guru, Venkusa of Selu, and that he had stayed with Venkusa for 12 years as his disciple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Narasimhaswami | first = B.V. | title = Sri Sai Baba's Charters &amp; Sayings | publisher = All-India Sai Samaj, Madras | year=  1986 | pages = 62}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dichotomy has given rise to two major theories regarding Baba's background, with the majority of writers supporting the Hindu background over the Islamic, while others combine both the theories (that Sai Baba was first brought up by a fakir and then by a guru).&lt;ref name="hoiberg" /&gt;

Baba reportedly arrived at the village of [[Shirdi]] in the [[Ahmednagar District|Ahmednagar district]] of [[Maharashtra]], [[India]], when he was about sixteen years old. Although there is no agreement among biographers about the date of this event, it is generally accepted that Baba stayed in Shirdi for three years, disappeared for a year and returned permanently around 1858, just after the [[Indian_Rebellion_of_1857|Indian Sepoy mutiny]]. This which posits a possible birth year of 1838.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rigopoulos | first = Antonio | title = The Life and Teachings of Sai Baba of Shirdi | publisher = [[State University of New York Press|SUNY]] | year=  1993 | pages = 45 | isbn = 0791412687}}&lt;/ref&gt; He led an ascetic life, sitting motionless under a [[neem]] tree and [[meditation|meditating]] while sitting in an [[asana]]. The Sai Satcharita recounts the reaction of the villagers
&lt;blockquote&gt;The people of the village were wonder-struck to see such a young lad practicing hard penance, not minding heat or cold. By day he associated with no one, by night he was afraid of nobody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rigopoulos | first = Antonio | title = The Life and Teachings of Sai Baba of Shirdi | publisher = [[State University of New York Press|SUNY]] | year=  1993 | pages = 46 | isbn = 0791412687}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; His presence attracted the curiosity of the villagers and the religiously-inclined such as Mhalsapati, Appa Jogle and Kashinatha regularly visited him, while others such as the village children considered him mad and threw stones at him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Parthasarathy | first = Rangaswami | title = God Who Walked On Earth: The Life and Times of Shirdi Sai Baba | publisher = [[Sterling Publishing]] | year=  1997 | pages = 15 | isbn = 81-207-1809-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;After some time he left the village, and it is unknown where he stayed at that time or what happened to him. However, there are some indications that he met with many saints and fakirs, and worked as a weaver; he claimed to have fought with the army of [[Rani Lakshmibai]] of [[Jhansi]] during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].&lt;ref&gt;(To Balakrishna Upasani Shastri) "I was at the battle in which the Rani of Jhansi took part. I was then in the army."

==Return to Shirdi==
[[File:Shirdi Sai Baba 2.jpg|thumb|350px|left|Sai Baba in his usual attire]]
Sai Baba returned to Shirdi in 1858. He appeared at the Khandoba Mandir in Shirdi. The temple priest, Mhalsapati, upon seeing him for the very first time, welcomed him by saying 'Aao, Sai!' ('Come Sai'). From then on, He was known by the name (Sai Baba).

Around this time he adopted his famous style of dressing, consisting of a knee-length one-piece [[Kaftan|Kafni robe]] and a cloth cap. Ramgir Bua, a devotee, testified that Sai Baba was dressed like an athlete and sported 'long hair flowing down to the end of his spine' when he arrived in Shirdi, and that he never had his head shaved. It was only after Baba forfeited a wrestling match with one Mohiddin Tamboli that he took up the kafni and cloth cap, articles of typical Sufi clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Warren | first = Marianne | title = Unravelling the Enigma: Shirdi Sai Baba in the Light of Sufism | publisher = [[Sterling Publishing|Sterling Publishers]] | year= 1997 | page = 104 | isbn = 81-207-2147-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This attire contributed to Baba's identification as a Muslim fakir and was a reason for initial indifference and hostility against him in a predominantly Hindu village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rigopoulos | first = Antonio | title = The Life and Teachings of Sai Baba of Shirdi | isbn= 0-7914-1268-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For four to five years, Baba lived under a [[neem]] tree and often wandered for long periods in the jungle around Shirdi. His manner was said to be withdrawn and uncommunicative as he undertook long periods of meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Warren | first = Marianne | title = Unravelling the Enigma: Shirdi Sai Baba in the Light of Sufism | publisher = [[Sterling Publishing|Sterling Publishers]] | year = 1997 | page = 45 | isbn = 81-207-2147-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was eventually persuaded to take up residence in an old and dilapidated mosque and lived a solitary life there, surviving by begging for [[alms]], and receiving itinerant Hindu or Muslim visitors. In the mosque he maintained a sacred fire which is referred to as a [[dhuni]], from which he gave sacred ash ('Udi') to his guests before they left. The ash was believed to have healing and [[Apotropaism|apotropaic]] powers. He performed the function of a local [[Hakim (title)|hakim]] and treated the sick by application of ashes. Sai Baba also delivered spiritual teachings to his visitors, recommending the reading of the [[Ramayan]] and [[Bhagavat Gita]] for [[Hindus]] and [[Qur'an]] for Muslims. He insisted on the indispensability of the unbroken remembrance of God's name ([[dhikr]], and often expressed himself in a cryptic manner with the use of [[parable]]s, [[symbol]]s and [[allegory|allegories]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rigopoulos | first = Antonio | title = The Life and Teachings of Sai Baba of Shirdi | publisher = [[State University of New York Press|SUNY]] | year = 1993 | page = 86 | isbn = 0-7914-1268-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baba is believed to have grown and cultivated a garden called Lendi Baug, named after a riverlet called Lendi which flowed nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lendi baug |url=http://www.shirdisaitemple.com/shirdi-article/id/89/lendi-baug |website=www.shirdisaitemple.com |publisher=Shirdi Sai Baba Temple (official website) |accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The garden continues to be a place visited by pilgrims, and has temples, [[Samadhi|samadhis]] of people and animals associated with Shirdi Sai Baba's life and temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chitluri | first = Vinny | title = Baba's Gurukul: SHIRDI | publisher = [[Sterling Publishers]] Pvt.

In 1910, Sai Baba's fame began to spread in [[Mumbai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=06gFzl76nK8C&amp;pg=RA2-PA1910|title=The Eternal Sai Phenomenon|last=Nanda|first=A.

==Final years and death (Samadhi)==
In August 1918, Shirdi Sai Baba told some of his devotees that he would soon be "leaving his mortal body" (dying).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About us - Chronology of events |url=https://www.sai.org.in/en/history |website=www.sai.org.in |publisher=Shri Sai Baba Trust (Official website) |accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of September, he had high fever and stopped eating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dabholkar |first1=Govind |title=Chapter 43 - Shri Sai Satcharitra |date=1 June 1999 |publisher=New Dawn Books |edition=2 |accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As his condition deteriorated, he asked his disciples to recite holy texts to him and continued to meet visitors. On 15th October 1918, he breathed his last. The day coincided with the Hindu calendar date that year for [[Vijayadashami|Vijaydashami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Hemadpant |title=Sri Sai Satcharitra: The Wonderful Life and Teachings of Shirdi Sai Baba |isbn=1521183562 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dabholkar |first1=Hemandpant |title=Shri Sai Satcharitra: The Wonderful Life and Teachings of Shirdi Sai Baba |date=12 April 2016 |publisher=Enlightenment press |isbn=0692690832 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings and practices==
[[Image:Shirdi sai3.jpg|thumb|225px|Shirdi Sai Baba, leaning against the wall of his [[masjid]], with devotees]]

Sai Baba opposed all persecution based on religion or [[caste]]. He was an opponent of religious orthodoxy&amp;nbsp;— Christian, Hindu and Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rigopoulos | first = Antonio | title = The Life and Teachings of Sai Baba of Shirdi | publisher = [[State University of New York Press|SUNY]] | year = 1993 | page = 139 | isbn = 0-7914-1268-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sai Baba encouraged his devotees to pray, chant God's name, and read holy scriptures. He told Muslims to study the [[Qur'an]] and Hindus to study texts such as the [[Ramayana]], [[Bhagavad Gita]], and [[Yoga Vasistha]].&lt;ref name="saibaba.org"&gt;Dabholkar/Gunaji ''Shri Sai Satcharita''/''Shri Sai Satcharitra'' chapter 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He was impressed by the philosophy of the Bhagavad Gita and encouraged people to follow it in their own lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saibaba.org/satcharitra/sai27.html |title=Shri Sai Satcharitra |publisher=Saibaba.org |accessdate=17 June 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016002513/http://saibaba.org/satcharitra/sai27.html |archivedate=16 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He advised his devotees and followers to lead a moral life, help others, love every living being without any discrimination, and develop two important features of character: devotion (''Shraddha'') and patience (''Saburi''). He criticised [[atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;Dabholkar/Gunaji ''Shri Sai Satcharita''/''Shri Sai Satcharitra'' chapter 3 {{cite web |url=http://www.saibaba.org/satcharitra/sai3.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525013202/http://www.saibaba.org/satcharitra/sai3.html |archivedate=25 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his teachings, Sai Baba emphasised the importance of performing one's duties without attachment to earthly matters and of being content regardless of the situation. In his personal practice, Sai Baba observed worship procedures belonging to Islam; he shunned any kind of regular rituals but allowed the practice of [[Salah]], chanting of [[Al-Fatiha]], and Qur'an readings at Muslim festival times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Warren | first = Marianne | title = Unravelling The Enigma: Shirdi Sai Baba in the Light of Sufism. | publisher = [[Sterling Publishers]] | year = 1999 | page = 29 | isbn = 0-7914-1268-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally reciting the Al-Fatiha, Baba enjoyed listening to [[mawlid]] and [[qawwali]] accompanied with the [[tabla]] and [[sarangi]] twice daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Warren | first = Marianne | title = Unravelling The Enigma: Shirdi Sai Baba in the Light of Sufism. | publisher = [[Sterling Publishers]] | year = 1999 | page = 30 | isbn = 0-7914-1268-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sai Baba interpreted the religious texts of both Islam and Hinduism. He explained the meaning of the Hindu scriptures in the spirit of [[Advaita Vedanta]]. His philosophy also had numerous elements of [[bhakti]]. The three main Hindu spiritual paths — [[Bhakti Yoga]], [[Jnana Yoga]], and [[Karma Yoga]] — influenced his teachings.&lt;ref name="SUNY"&gt;{{cite book | last = Rigopoulos | first = Antonio | title = The Life and Teachings of Sai Baba of Shirdi | publisher = [[State University of New York Press|SUNY]] | year= 1993 | pages = 261–352 | isbn = 0-7914-1268-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sai Baba encouraged charity and stressed the importance of sharing. He said
{{Blockquote|Unless there is some relationship or connection, nobody goes anywhere. If any men or creatures come to you, do not discourteously drive them away, but receive them well and treat them with due respect. Sri [[Hari]] (God) will certainly be pleased if you give water to the thirsty, bread to the hungry, clothes to the naked, and your verandah to strangers for sitting and resting. If anybody wants any money from you and you are not inclined to give, do not give, but do not bark at him like a dog."&lt;ref&gt;Dabholkar (alias Hemadpant) ''Shri Sai Satcharita'' Shri Sai Baba Sansthan Shirdi, (translated from [[Marathi language|Marathi]] into English by Nagesh V. Gunaji in 1944) [http://www.shirdi-sai-baba.com/sai-books.html available online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512203715/http://www.shirdi-sai-baba.com/sai-books.html |date=12 May 2006 }} or [http://www.saibaba.org/saisatc.html downloadable]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060414023134/http://saibaba.org/saisatc.html |date=14 April 2006 }} or on [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DO6QJ42 Kindle.]

Because of Sai Baba, [[Shirdi]] has become a place of importance and is counted among the major Hindu places of pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.amazingmaharashtra.com/2012/05/shirdi.html|title=Amazing Maharashtra: SHIRDI SAIBABA TEMPLE|last=Mhatre|first=Shridhar|work=Amazing Maharashtra|access-date=2017-03-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414192758/http://www.amazingmaharashtra.com/2012/05/shirdi.html|archivedate=14 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tourmyindia.com/blog/top-30-famous-temples-in-india/|title=Top 30 Famous Temples in India: Tour My India|date=2013-12-04|work=Tour My India|access-date=2017-03-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314063551/https://www.tourmyindia.com/blog/top-30-famous-temples-in-india/|archivedate=14 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Sai Baba temple is situated at [[Kudal]], [[Sindhudurg]]. This temple was built in 1922. It is believed that Sai Baba gave one Rupee to Dada Madye ji with which he built the temple in Kudal.

Today, The Sai Baba Temple in [[Shirdi]] is visited by an average of 25,000 pilgrims a day, and during religious festivals, this number can reach up to 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shrisaibabasansthan.org/new_eng%20template_shirdi/shirdi/templecomplex.html|title=shirdi|date=2016-04-23|access-date=2017-03-13|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423104659/http://www.shrisaibabasansthan.org/new_eng%20template_shirdi/shirdi/templecomplex.html|archivedate=23 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sai Baba temple in Shirdi is managed by the Shri Sai Baba Sansthan Trust. Sai Baba accepted the state of samadhi and attained nirvana in Dwarkamai. His remains were buried at Buti Wada, today known as the Shree Samadhi Mandir in Shirdi. Inside the temple, The statue of Sai Baba and the Samadhi is carved out of Italian marble and is seen draped with royal cloth, wearing a gold crown and adorned with fresh flower garlands. The interior is made of old stone bricks. The interior, as well as the exterior (cone) of the temple, is covered with gold. As per rituals and traditions dating back to when Baba was still alive, Four [[Aarti]]'s are held daily (corresponding to the time of the day) inside the [[Samadhi]] Mandir.

* Kakad Aarti ''(The Morning Aarti)'' at 4:30 (am)
* Madhyan Aarti ''(The Afternoon Aarti)'' at 12:00 (pm)
* Dhup Aarti ''(The Evening Aarti)'' 6:30 (pm)
* Shej Aarti ''(The Night Aarti)'' at 10:30 (pm)

The Palanquin procession of Sai Baba takes place every Thursday from the Samadhi Mandir to Dwarkamayi, onward to Chavdi and back to the Sai Baba Mandir. Devotees belonging to all faiths are welcome to take [[Darśana|Darshan]] in the Samadhi Mandir and have free meals in the Prasadalaya, irrespective of caste, creed, and religion as these were one of the ideal principles of Sai Baba.

Sai Baba of Shirdi is especially revered and worshiped in the states of [[Maharashtra]], [[Odisha]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Telangana]], [[Karnataka]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Gujarat]]. In August 2012, an unidentified devotee, for the first time, donated two expensive diamonds valuing ₹11.8&amp;nbsp;million at the Shirdi temple, as revealed by Saibaba trust officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.indianexpress.com/news/unknown-person-donates-diamonds-worth-rs-1.18-crore-at-shirdi/982422/|title= Unknown person donates diamonds worth Rs 1.18 crore (approximately $240,000) at Shirdi| date= 1 August 2012|work=Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-Discrimination of Devotees===

[[File:Sai baba.jpg|200px|thumb|A marble statue of Sai Baba.]]Baba himself maintained an ambiguous profile, unwilling to identify with either of the two religions. His Muslim devotees were fully convinced that he belonged to their fold, identifying him as an avaliā. The Hindu bhaktas also viewed him as one of them, since he often identified himself with their gods and customs. Sai Baba wanted to belong to all and be shared by all. When pressed on whether he was Hindu or Muslim, he would often get very angry. Once he told a devotee: ''"You have been with me for eighteen years now. Does Sai mean for you only these three and a half cubits of height?"'' Sai Baba was able to avoid clashes between the two communities, and, in fact, succeeded in unifying them in an atmosphere of general harmony. In a verse of the midday arti, devotees sing:{{quote|"In essence or basic principle, there is no difference whatever between Hindu and Muslim. You took birth in human body to point out this. You look with affection on both Hindus and Muslims. This, Sai, who pervades all, as the soul of all, shows."}} Baba would often talk about the Hindu gods, quoting from sacred texts or even commenting upon passages of the Bhagavadgita, the Isha Upanishad, and so forth. The names of Krishna and Rama seem to have been particularly dear to him. With his Muslim followers, Baba would always talk of Allah and the Koran, often quoting Persian verses. One of his favorite expressions was ''"Allah rakhega vaiia rahena"'', that is, ''"Let us be content with what we have, and submit our will to Allah."'' On several occasions, Sai reassured his listeners by saying that he, like them, was but a devotee of Allah, a humble faqir with two arms and two legs. In later years, Parsis and even a few Christians would come to Shirdi. Sai Baba respected all creeds, true to his conviction that all religions are but particular paths leading to one ineffable goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rigopoulos |first=Antonio |date=1993 |title=The Life And Teachings Of Sai Baba Of Shirdi |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=TNohSoS0CzUC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=muslim+worship+sai+baba&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj--pKAv6TWAhXLpo8KHSlpDvIQ6AEINTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Baba%20himself%20maintained%20an%20ambiguous%20profile&amp;f=false |publisher=SUNY Press |page=70,71 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914173019/https://books.google.co.in/books?id=TNohSoS0CzUC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=muslim+worship+sai+baba&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj--pKAv6TWAhXLpo8KHSlpDvIQ6AEINTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Baba%20himself%20maintained%20an%20ambiguous%20profile&amp;f=false |archivedate=14 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His notion of the unity of all mankind that appealed to everyone was very congruous with Sufism of Islam. "God being one and the master of all also meant that all his creatures were part of one big family," writes Sikand. "This belief was entirely in keeping with ... the teachings of Sufis, who believed that the light of God exists in every creature, indeed in every particle of His creation." Sai Baba urged his Hindu followers to read their holy books and find their own path. For him, all paths were equally valid, "Ishwar" (the Hindu God) and "Allah" being synonymous.[[File:Padukas.jpg|200px|thumb|Padukas of sai baba]] People coming to his abode were so taken aback to see Hindus, Muslims, and others living together so peacefully that in many instances it changed their entire lives and belief systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pal |first=Amitabh |date=2011 |title="Islam" Means Peace: Understanding the Muslim Principle of Nonviolence Today |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=zAfRoIQV97MC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=muslim+worship+sai+baba&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj--pKAv6TWAhXLpo8KHSlpDvIQ6AEILzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Sai%20baba%20urged%20his&amp;f=false |publisher=ABC Clio |page=71 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914173323/https://books.google.co.in/books?id=zAfRoIQV97MC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=muslim+worship+sai+baba&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj--pKAv6TWAhXLpo8KHSlpDvIQ6AEILzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Sai%20baba%20urged%20his&amp;f=false |archivedate=14 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miracles==
Sai Baba's disciples and devotees claim that he performed many miracles such as [[bilocation]], [[levitation (paranormal)|levitation]], [[Mentalism|mindreading]], [[Materialization (parapsychology)|materialisation]], [[exorcism]]s, entering a state of [[Samadhi|Samādhi]] at will, lighting lamps with water, removing his limbs or intestines and sticking them back to his body (''[[khandana yoga]]''), curing the incurably sick, appearing beaten when another was beaten, preventing a mosque from falling down on people, and helping his devotees in other miraculous ways. He also gave Darshan (vision) to people in the form of Sri [[Rama]], [[Krishna]], [[Vithoba]], [[Shiva]] and many other gods depending on the faith of devotees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mukund Raj |url=http://www.saibaba.org/ |title=Shri Sai Baba Shirdi Home Page |publisher=Saibaba.org |date=1 November 2010 |accessdate=8 January 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230114931/http://saibaba.org/ |archivedate=30 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=February 2017}}

According to his followers, he appeared to them in their dreams and gave them advice. His devotees have documented many stories.&lt;ref&gt;Ruhela, ''Sri Shirdi Sai Baba – the universal master'' pp. 141–154&lt;/ref&gt;
==Followers==
[[File:Sai Baba.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Sai Baba depicted on a [[tapestry]]]]

Sai Baba left behind no spiritual heirs, appointed no disciples, and did not provide formal initiation (diksha), despite requests. Some disciples of Sai Baba achieved fame as spiritual figures, such as [[Upasni Maharaj]] of [[Sakori]]. After the demise of Sai Baba, his devotees offered the daily [[Aarti]] to Upasni Maharaj when he paid a visit to [[Shirdi]] twice within 10 years.&lt;ref name="asian_tribune_meher"&gt;{{cite web |author=sandman |url=http://www.asiantribune.com/news/2009/01/19/who-sai-baba-guru-zarzari-zar-baksh-who-lived-khuldabad-says-meher-baba |title=Who is Sai Baba' guru?

===Hindus===
During Sai Baba's lifetime, the Hindu saint Anandanath of Yewala declared Sai Baba to be a "spiritual diamond."&lt;ref name="templeofpeace"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://templeofpeace.org/history.html|title= Who is Shirdi Sai Baba|accessdate=29 October 2007 |work= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071015050416/http://templeofpeace.org/history.html |archivedate = 15 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another saint, Gangagir, also called him a "jewel."&lt;ref name="templeofpeace" /&gt; Sri Beedkar Maharaj greatly revered Sai Baba, and in 1873, when he met him he bestowed the title [[Jagad guru]] upon him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.swamisamarth.com/parampara/beedkar_biography.html#An%20Avadhoot%20appears%20in%20front%20of%20Shree%20Beedkar%20Maharaj|title= A Short Biography of Shree Sadguru Beedkar Maharaj|accessdate= 29 October 2007|work= |deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071013230840/http://swamisamarth.com/parampara/beedkar_biography.html#An%20Avadhoot%20appears%20in%20front%20of%20Shree%20Beedkar%20Maharaj|archivedate= 13 October 2007|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.saibaba.org/newsletter8-21.html|title= Beedkar Maharaj|accessdate= 29 October 2007|work= Sai Vichaar, Oct 06, 2005, volume 8, issue 2001|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071017014535/http://saibaba.org/newsletter8-21.html|archivedate= 17 October 2007|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sai Baba was also greatly respected by [[Vasudevanand Saraswati|Vasudevananda Saraswati]] (known as [[Vasudevanand Saraswati|Tembye Swami]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dabholkar/Gunaji ''Shri Sai Satcharita''/''Shri Sai Satcharitra'' chapter 50 {{cite web |url=http://www.saibaba.org/satcharitra/sai50.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525203709/http://www.saibaba.org/satcharitra/sai50.html |archivedate=25 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also revered by a group of [[Shaivism|Shaivic]] yogis, known as the ''Nath-Panchayat''.&lt;ref&gt;Ruhela ''Sri Shirdi Sai Baba – the universal master'' p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered an avatar of the ''Supreme Reality'' (Brahman or God), a satguru, or saint, depending on individual proclivities. This is not uncommon in Hinduism where there is no central doctrine or cosmology, but a basis in individual faith and spirituality.

===Parsis===
Saibaba was revered by prominent [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]] such as [[Nanabhoy Palkhivala]], [[Farhaad Panthaky]]  and [[Homi J. Bhabha|Homi Bhabha]], and has been cited as the Zoroastrians' most popular non-Zoroastrian religious figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hinnells, John R.|title=The Zoroastrian Diaspora:Religion and Migration: Religion and Migration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Tha83L1QFUC&amp;pg=PA109|date=2005|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-826759-1|page=109|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303194030/https://books.google.com/books?id=0Tha83L1QFUC&amp;pg=PA109|archivedate=3 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Meher Baba]], who was born into a [[Zoroastrian]] family, met Sai Baba once, during [[World War I]], in December 1915. This event is considered as the most significant in Meher Baba's life.
''Shri Sai Satcharita'' (Sai Baba's life story), makes no mention of Meher Baba but ''Lord Meher'', the life story of Meher Baba, there are numerous references to Sai Baba.&lt;ref name="asian_tribune_meher" /&gt;

Meher Baba, who claimed he was an (the) Avatar, credited his Avataric advent to Upasni, Sai Baba, and three other Perfect Masters: [[Hazrat Babajan]], [[Hazrat Tajuddin Baba]], and [[Narayan Maharaj]]. He declared Sai Baba to be a ''Qutub-e-Irshad'' (the highest of the five [[Qutb|Qutubs]], a "Master of the Universe" in the spiritual hierarchy).&lt;ref&gt;Kalchuri, Bhau: ''Meher Prabhu: Lord Meher, The Biography of the Avatar of the Age, Meher Baba'', ''Manifestation, Inc.'' 1986. p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; This classification of avatar and satgurus and the associated name is applied within the Meher Baba community alone.

==In popular culture==
Shri Sai tends to be a very common name for establishments in Mumbai in particular and Maharashtra in general. It tends to be popular for a variety of establishments including restaurants, real estate agencies and hotels.

===Sacred art and architecture===
There are many temples of Sai Baba in [[India]].&lt;ref name="srinivas"&gt;Srinivas ''Sathya Sai Baba movement''&lt;/ref&gt; Temples are also located in countries outside India, including the [[United States]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], [[Fiji]], [[Mauritius]], [[South Africa]], [[Netherlands]], [[Kenya]], [[Benin]], [[Cuba]], [[Canada]], [[Pakistan]], [[Australia]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], [[Japan]] and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omsrisai.net/saitemples.php?page=1 |title=Directory of Shri Shirdi Saibaba temples around the world |publisher=Omsrisai.net |accessdate=17 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130222061437/http://www.omsrisai.net/saitemples.php?page=1 |archivedate=22 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Present in the mosque in Shirdi in which Sai Baba lived, is a life-size portrait of him by Shama Rao Jaykar, an artist from [[Mumbai]]. Numerous monuments and statues depicting Sai Baba which serve a religious function have been made. One of them, made of marble by a sculptor named Balaji Vasant Talim, is in the Samadhi Mandir in Shirdi where Sai Baba was buried.&lt;ref&gt;Ruhela ''Sri Shirdi Sai Baba – The Universal Master''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, India Post has issued a commemorative postage stamp of ₹5.00 to honour Sai Baba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.istampgallery.com/shri-shirdi-sai-baba/|title=Shri Shirdi Sai Baba Stamp|website=www.istampgallery.com|access-date=2017-04-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413234650/http://www.istampgallery.com/shri-shirdi-sai-baba/|archivedate=13 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://postagestamps.gov.in/Stamps2008.aspx|title=Postage Stamps|website=postagestamps.gov.in|access-date=2017-04-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410051230/http://postagestamps.gov.in/Stamps2008.aspx|archivedate=10 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-acceptance''' is acceptance of self.

==Definition==
Self-acceptance can be defined as:
* the awareness of one's strengths and weaknesses,
* the realistic (yet subjective) appraisal of one's talents, capabilities, and general worth, and,
* feelings of satisfaction with one's self despite deficiencies and regardless of past behaviors and choices.&lt;ref name=Henriques&gt;{{cite web|last1=Henriques|first1=Gregg|title=Six Domains of Psychological Well-being|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/theory-knowledge/201405/six-domains-psychological-well-being|website=Psychology Today|publisher=Sussex Publishers|accessdate=12 August 2015|date=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shepard&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shepard|first1=Lorrie A.|title=Self-Acceptance: The Evaluative Component of the Self-Concept Construct|journal=American Educational Research Journal|date=1978|volume=16|issue=2|pages=139|doi=10.2307/1162326}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 August 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vlahopoulos&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vlahopoulos|first1=Basil Alex|title=The Relationships between Psychological Well-being, Self-acceptance, Client Status, and Counselor Facilitative Behaviors|date=1985|publisher=University of Cincinnati|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|pages=5 &amp; 28|accessdate=12 August 2015|chapter=Introduction and Review of the Literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Shepard (1979), self-acceptance is an individual's satisfaction or happiness with oneself, and is thought to be necessary for good [[mental health]]. Self-acceptance involves self-understanding, a realistic, albeit subjective, awareness of one's strengths and weaknesses. It results in an individual's feeling about oneself, that they are of "unique worth".

In [[clinical psychology]] and [[positive psychology]], self-acceptance is considered the prerequisite for change to occur. It can be achieved by stopping criticizing and solving the defects of one's self, and then accepting them to be existing within one's self. That is, tolerating oneself to be imperfect in some parts.

Some distinguish between ''conditional'' and ''unconditional'' self-acceptance.&lt;ref name="Bernard2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael E. Bernard|title=The Strength of Self-Acceptance: Theory, Practice and Research|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rPa6BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR15|date=8 July 2014|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4614-6806-6|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-acceptance is one of the six factors in Carol D. Ryff's structure for eudaimonic well-being.

==Qualities==
A person who scores high on self-acceptance:
* has a positive self-attitude, 
* acknowledges and accepts all aspects of themselves (including the good and bad), 
* is not self-critical or confused about their identity, and,
* does not wish they were any different from who they already are.&lt;ref name=Henriques /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ryff&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryff|first1=Carol D.|last2=Singer|first2=Burton H.|title=Know Thyself and Become What You Are: A Eudaimonic Approach to Psychological Well-Being|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|date=5 October 2006|volume=9|issue=1|pages=13–39|doi=10.1007/s10902-006-9019-0}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 August 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Past and current views in psychology==

In the past, the practice of self-acceptance was reproved by the Greeks. However, the need to know about and understand “the self” eventually became an important, underlying point in several psychological theories, such as:
* [[Marie Jahoda|Jahoda]]'s work on mental health, 
* [[Carl Rogers]]' Theory of Personality, 
* [[Gordon Allport]]'s Eight Stages of Self (Proprium) Development, and,
* [[Abraham Maslow|Maslow]]'s Hierarchy of Needs under the “self-actualization” category.&lt;ref name=Ryff /&gt;

In addition to that, the life-span theories of [[Erik Erikson|Erikson]] and [[Bernice Neugarten|Neugarten]] mention the importance of self-acceptance including one's past life, and [[Carl Jung]]'s process of individuation also emphasizes coming to terms with the dark side of one's self, or "the shadow".&lt;ref name=Ryff /&gt;

==Relation to positive psychology==

==Psychological benefits==

Some psychological benefits of self-acceptance include mood regulation, a decrease in depressive symptoms, and an increase in positive emotions.&lt;ref name=Jimenez&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jimenez|first1=Sherlyn S.|last2=Niles|first2=Barbara L.|last3=Park|first3=Crystal L.|title=A mindfulness model of affect regulation and depressive symptoms: Positive emotions, mood regulation expectancies, and self-acceptance as regulatory mechanisms|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=October 2010|volume=49|issue=6|pages=645–650|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2010.05.041}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 August 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
An example of this can be seen in a 2014 study that looked at affective profiles. The results yielded suggest that individuals categorized as self-fulfilling (as compared to the other profiles) tended to score higher on all the factors of Ryff's eudaimonic well-being dimensions (self-acceptance included).&lt;ref name=Garcia&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garcia|first1=Danilo|last2=Al Nima|first2=Ali|last3=Kjell|first3=Oscar N.E.|title=The affective profiles, psychological well-being, and harmony: environmental mastery and self-acceptance predict the sense of a harmonious life|journal=PeerJ|date=13 February 2014|volume=2|pages=e259|doi=10.7717/peerj.259|pmid=24688843|pmc=3933359}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 August 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
In addition to that, self-acceptance (and environmental mastery) specifically and significantly predicted harmony in life across all affective profiles.&lt;ref name=Garcia /&gt;

Other psychological benefits include:
* a heightened sense of freedom, 
* a decrease in fear of failure, 
* an increase in self-worth, 
* an increase in independence (autonomy),
* an increase in self-esteem, 
* less desire to win the approval of others,
* less self-critique and more self-kindness when mistakes occur, 
* more desire to live life for one's self (and not others), and,
* the ability to take more risks without worrying about the consequences.&lt;ref name=McQuillan&gt;{{cite web|last1=McQuillan|first1=Susan|title=Radiate Self-Acceptance|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/cravings/201409/radiate-self-acceptance|website=Psychology Today|publisher=Sussex Publishers|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-acceptance is also thought to be necessary for good mental health.&lt;ref name=Shepard /&gt;

==Physical benefits==

In addition to psychological benefits, self-acceptance may have physical benefits as well.&lt;ref name=Ryan /&gt; For example, the results of a 2008 study propose that older women with higher levels of environmental mastery, positive relations with others, and self-acceptance showed lower levels of glycosylated hemoglobin, which is a marker for glucose levels/insulin resistance.&lt;ref name=Ryff /&gt;

'''''The Art of Loving''''' is a 1956 book&lt;ref&gt;''The Art of Loving'' (1956) by Erich Fromm. [[Harper &amp; Row]]. {{ISBN|978-0-06-091594-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fromm, Erich (1956) "''The art of loving''" First Perennial Library edition published 1974. {{ISBN|0-06080291-X}}. Paperback, 118 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; by psychoanalyst and social philosopher [[Erich Fromm]], which was published as part of the ''World Perspectives Series''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = World Perspectives Series List|url = http://www.librarything.com/series/World%20Perspectives|work = World Perspectives Series|publisher = Library Thing|accessdate = Dec 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited by [[Ruth Nanda Anshen]]. In this work, Fromm develops his perspective on [[human nature]], from his earlier work, ''[[Escape from Freedom]]'' and ''[[Man for Himself: An Inquiry into the Psychology of Ethics|Man for Himself]]'' – principles which he revisits in many of his other major works.

Fromm presents love as a skill that can be taught and developed, rejecting the idea of loving as something magical and mysterious that cannot be analyzed and explained. He is therefore skeptical about popular ideas such as "[[falling in love]]" or being helpless in the face of love.&lt;ref&gt;''"falling" in love, the sudden collapse of the barriers which existed until that moment between two strangers ... this experience of sudden intimacy by its very nature short-lived.'' - Erich Fromm. The Art of loving (Kindle Locations 679-682).&lt;/ref&gt;

Because modern humans are alienated from each other and from nature, we seek refuge from our lonesomeness in romantic love and marriage (pp.&amp;nbsp;79–81). However, Fromm observes that real love "is not a sentiment which can be easily indulged in by anyone." It is only through developing one's total personality to the capacity of loving one's neighbor with "true humility, courage, faith and discipline" that one attains the capacity to experience real love. This should be considered a rare achievement (p. vii). Fromm defended these opinions also in interview with Mike Wallace when he states: "love today is a relatively rare phenomenon, that we have a great deal of sentimentality; we have a great deal of illusion about love, namely as a...as something one falls in. But the question is that one cannot fall in love, really; one has to be in love. And that means that loving becomes, and the ability to love, becomes one of the most important things in life."&lt;ref&gt;Erich Fromm: Mike Wallace interview transcript in University of Texas at Texas Harry Ransom Center http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/multimedia/video/2008/wallace/fromm_erich_t.html&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Art of Loving'' argues that the active character of true love involves four basic elements: care, responsibility, respect, and knowledge (p.&amp;nbsp;24). Each of these is difficult to define and can differ markedly depending on the people involved and their circumstances. Seen in these terms, love is hard work, but it is also the most rewarding kind of work.

One of the book's concepts is [[self-love]]. According to Fromm, loving oneself is quite different from arrogance, conceit or egocentrism. Loving oneself means caring about oneself, taking responsibility for oneself, respecting oneself, and knowing oneself (e.g. being realistic and honest about one's strengths and weaknesses). In order to be able to truly love another person, one needs first to love oneself in this way.

Fromm calls the general idea of love in contemporary Western society ''{{lang|fr|égoïsme à deux}}'' – a relationship in which each person is entirely focused on the other, to the detriment of other people around them. The current belief is that a couple should be a well-assorted team, sexually and functionally, working towards a common aim. This is in contrast with Fromm's description of true love and intimacy, which involves willful commitment directed toward a single unique individual. One cannot truly love another person if one does not love all of mankind including oneself.

The book includes explorations of the theories of [[brotherly love (philosophy)|brotherly love]], motherly and fatherly love, [[erotic love]], self-love, and the love of God (pp.&amp;nbsp;7–76), and an examination into love's disintegration in contemporary Western culture (pp.&amp;nbsp;77–98).

To be able to fully comprehend the ideas illustrated in Fromm's book, one must understand the concept of paradoxical thought, or the ability to reconcile opposing principles in one same instance. Fromm himself explains paradoxical thought in the chapters dedicated to the love of God and erotic love.

Fromm begins the last chapter "The Practice of Love" saying: "[...] many readers of this book, expect to be given prescriptions of 'how to do it to yourself' [...]. I am afraid that anyone who approaches this last chapter in this spirit will be gravely disappointed".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2164">[[Image:Kinhin.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Members of [[Kanzeon Zen Center]] during kinhin]] 
'''Walking meditation''', also known as '''kinhin''' ({{CJKV|c=経行|p=jīngxíng|v=kinh hành|r=kinhin, kyōgyō|k=gyeonghyaeng}}) is the [[walking]] [[meditation]] that is practiced between long periods of the sitting meditation known as [[zazen]].{{sfn|Maezumi|2002|pp=48-9}} The practice is common in [[Zen]], [[Chan Buddhism]], [[Korean Seon]] and [[Vietnamese Thiền]].

==Practice==
Practitioners walk clockwise around a room while holding their hands in ''shashu'' ({{zh|c=叉手|p=chā shǒu}}): one hand closed in a fist while the other hand grasps or covers the fist.{{sfn|Aitken|1999|pp=35-6}} During walking meditation each step is taken after each full breath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kinhin|url=http://www.emptybowlzendo.org/#/zen-practices/kinhin|publisher=Empty Bowl Zendo|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pace of walking meditation may be slow (several steady steps per each breath) or brisk, almost to the point of jogging.{{sfn|Aitken|1999|pp=35-6}}

==Etymology==
The terms consist of the Chinese words [[wikt:經|經]] "to go through (like the thread in a loom)", with [[sutra]] as a secondary meaning, and [[wikt:行|行]] "walk". Taken literally, the phrase means "to walk straight back and forth." The opposite in Japanese to kinhin is [[zazen]], "sitting meditation".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8564">The alleged "'''Will of Fernando Malang Balagtas'''", sometimes also referred to as the "'''Will of Pansomun'''" is a [[Diplomatics|disputed]] early Spanish-era Philippine document which was supposedly issued "''on 25 March 1539''" by a "Don Fernando Malang Balagtas", whose original name (before his baptism as a Catholic) was "Pansomun."  Despite its provenance having been questioned by [[Isabelo de Los Reyes]] when he first published a copy of the will in the first volume of his seminal compilation "''El Folklore Filipino''",&lt;ref name="DeLosReyes1890"&gt;{{cite book | title=El Folk-Lore Filipino (Volume 2) | author=de los Reyes, Isabelo | authorlink=Isabelo de los Reyes | year=1890}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently by Philippine scholars such as [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]],&lt;ref name="Scott1982"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Scott  | first = William Henry  | authorlink = William Henry Scott (historian)  | coauthors =  | title = Cracks in the Parchment Curtain and Other Essays in Philippine History  | publisher = New Day Publishers  | date = 1982  | location = Quezon City  | pages =  | volume =  | edition =   | url =  | doi =  | id =    | isbn = 971-10-0073-3  }}&lt;/ref&gt; this "Will of Pansomun" is still popularly used as a reference for tracing the genealogies of the Rajahs and Lakans who ruled the pre-colonial polities of Maynila and Tondo in the 1570s.&lt;ref name="Dery2001"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Dery  | first = Luis Camara  | authorlink =   | coauthors =  | title = A History of the Inarticulate  | publisher = New Day Publishers  | date = 2001  | location = Quezon City  | pages =  | volume =  | edition =   | url =  | doi =  | id =    | isbn = 971-10-1069-0  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sometimes mistakenly dated "25 March 15'''''8'''''9" instead of "15'''''3'''''9"&lt;ref name="Dery2001"/&gt; but this does not reflect the date originally cited by de Los Reyes,&lt;ref name="DeLosReyes1890"/&gt; and is inconsistent with the document's use as an attachment to yet another will - that of Andres Mangaya, who claimed to be Malang Balagtas' descendant when he executed his own will on "Oct 3 1563."&lt;ref name="Scott1982"/&gt;

== Disputed Provenance ==
=== Genuineness questioned by Isabelo de Los Reyes ===
The document referred to as the "Will of Pansomun" first became known through the work of [[Isabelo de Los Reyes]], in Volume 2 of his seminal work in Philippine folkloristics, "El Folklore Filipino."&lt;ref name="DeLosReyes1890"/&gt; This second volume, published in 1890, included the work in a category titled "Folkloristic miscellany", and, along with the 1563 will of Andres Mangaya, who claimed to be Malang Balagtas' descendant and who had attached the original "Will of Pansomun" to his own will.&lt;ref name="DeLosReyes1890"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott1982"/&gt;

De los Reyes immediately questioned the provenance of these two ''"very curious unpublished documents about the Rulers of the Philippines and Moluccas at the time of the Conquest,''&lt;ref name="DeLosReyes1890"/&gt;" noting that they had: &lt;blockquote&gt;''"certain facts which contradict those which are accepted as historic truths"&lt;ref name="DeLosReyes1890"/&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Exposition on inconsistencies by William Henry Scott===
Commenting on the will in his 1982 book "Cracks in the Parchment Curtain,"&lt;ref name="Scott1982"/&gt; [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]] notes that two "anachronistic" dates in the documents immediately bing its genuineness to question: the "25 March 1539" date of the document itself, and the "early part of 1524" reference in the text when Malang Balagtas and his family were supposedly baptized by a bishop in Cebu.  Both of these dates are impossible, since, as Scott points out: &lt;blockquote&gt;''"the only Spaniards in the Philippines in 1524 or 1539 were captive survivors of Magellan's fleet, and none of them were either priests or bishops."''&lt;ref name="Scott1982"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scott notes that these dates could not simply be errors of  Malang Balagtas when he executed the will, because the Certificate of Death, an official Spanish document, was attached to the document and bore the same dates. Scott notes that these historical inconsistencies:
"''... may be simple mistakes on the part of a senile illiterate on his deathbead, but similar details in an official death certificate appended to the will cannot be dismissed so lightly.''&lt;ref name="Scott1982"/&gt;"

Furthermore, Scott notes that the death certificate was supposedly sworn by a church official who never existed historically:&lt;blockquote&gt;"''The death certificate purports to have been sworn, in the first-person singular, by Augustinian Procurator Fray Juan de Jesus in the Mission of San Carlos on March 21 of the year "mil quinientos treinta y nueve." Aside from the curious date and the even more curious circumstance of the testator's death having preceded the execution of the will by four days, both Isabelo (de Los Reyes) and the othrs who examined the documents were aware that there had been no Augustinian Friar by the name of Juan de Jesus in the Philippines in the 16th century, nor had there been any mission or town of San Carlos at that time.  As a topnothcer in graduate courses in [[paleography]], and the theory and practice of editing public documents, Isabelo wisely refrained from attributing authenticity to either document.''&lt;ref name="Scott1982"/&gt;"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===25 March 1539 v. 25 March 1589 ===
The occasional reference to the Will of Pansomun can be traced to the September 1919 issue of [[Philippine Historical Quarterly]],&lt;ref name="Dery2001"/&gt; which published a copy of the will with the date "25 March 1589" instead of 1539.  A large part of this text was recently requoted by historian Luis Camara Dery in his 2001 book "A History of the Inarticulate."&lt;ref name="Dery2001"/&gt; It should be noted, however, that despite the somewhat more palatable 1589 date, this 1919 printing of the will still contains the anachronistic 1524 date of the baptism.&lt;ref name="Dery2001"/&gt;

==Purported Content ==
The will claims to document seven generations of the family of Fernando Malang Balagtas, whose name before his baptism into Catholicism had been "Pansomun."&lt;ref name="Dery2001"/&gt; It places Malang Balagtas in the 5th generation of that family tree,&lt;ref name="MalangBalagtas1539"&gt;"Will of Fernando Malang Balagtas", as cited by Dery, Luis Camara (2001) A History of the Inarticulate. Quezon City: New Day.&lt;/ref&gt; which means that the will purportedly documents two generations of relatives younger than him, and four generations of relatives older than him.

The first two generations of the family tree includes various legendary names from the folklore of the polities in Maynila, Tondo, Namayan, and Pasig&lt;ref name="MalangBalagtas1539"/&gt; while the third and fourth generations supposedly link Malang Balagtas to the ruling houses of Maynila,&lt;ref name="MalangBalagtas1539"/&gt; Tondo: "''namely Lacandola and the two rulers, Ladiamora''" - first degree cousins once removed.&lt;ref name="MalangBalagtas1539"/&gt; (The document does not mention Rajah Matanda and Rajah Sulayman by name, so Dery notes is uncertain whether this refers to Matanda and Sulayman themselves.&lt;ref name="Dery2001"/&gt; "Ladiamora," meaning "young rajah (rajah mora)", is generally acknowledged as a descriptive phrase and could refer to either a descendant or ancestor of Matanda and Sulayman.&lt;ref name="Scott1982"/&gt;)

The last generations of the family tree supposedly identify the individuals who should be included in the property inheritances due to the descendants of these "great houses."&lt;ref name="Dery2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott1982"/&gt;

== Historical documents with similar content ==
Although the provenance of the Will of Fernando Malang Balagtas is in question, there are a number of other historical documents containing similar information about the genealogies of the royal houses of Maynila and Tondo.&lt;ref name="Dery2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott1982"/&gt;  These include the notarized Spanish era wills held by the Philippine National Archives, collectively known as the "Lakandula Documents" because they are mostly documents executed by direct descendants of Rajah Lakandula (Bunao);&lt;ref name="Dery2001"/&gt; and other miscellaneous genealogies, such as another genealogy printed in Volume 2 of El Folklore Filipino, which both De los Reyes and Scott consider more authoritative than the supposed Will of Pansonum.&lt;ref name="Scott1982"/&gt;

'''''Works of Love''''' ({{lang-da|Kjerlighedens Gjerninger}}) is a work by [[Søren Kierkegaard]] written in 1847. It is one of the works which he published under his own name, as opposed to his more famous "pseudonymous" works. ''Works of Love'' deals primarily with the [[Christian]] conception of ''{{lang|el|[[agape]]}}'' [[love]] in contrast with erotic love (''{{lang|el|[[Eros (love)|eros]]}}'') or preferential love (''{{lang|el|[[phileo]]}}'') given to friends and family. Kierkegaard uses this value/virtue to understand the existence and relationship of the individual Christian. Having helped found [[Existentialism]], he uses it and a high-level of theology citing the scriptures of the Christian [[Bible]].  Many of the chapters take a mention of love from the [[New Testament]] and center reflections about the transfer of individuals from secular modes (the stages of the aesthetic and ethical) to genuine religious experience and existence.  Since human experience is a key to understanding Kierkegaard, the actual relationships and experiences of disciples and of [[Christ]] are characterized here as tangible models for behavior.

Kierkegaard as a Christian ethicist (represented by this work) is likely to be considered distinct from many ways in which the religion's mainstream seems to function from the viewpoint of an outside observer.  This is not only a function of [[Christian existentialism]] but also of his time period and political events occurring in his native Denmark.

==Themes==
*Part One&amp;nbsp;— Topics include: ''Love's Hidden Life and Its Recognisability by its Fruits'',  ''You Shall Love'', ''You Shall Love Your Neighbor'', ''Love is the Fulfilling of the Law'', ''Love is a Matter of Conscience'', ''Our Duty to Love Those We See'', and ''Our Duty to be in the Debt of Love to Each Other''
*Part Two&amp;nbsp;— Topics include: ''Love Builds up'', ''Love Believes all Things and Yet is Never Deceived'', ''Love Hopes all Things and Yet is Never Put to Shame'', ''Love Seeks Not its Own'', ''Love Hides The Multiplicity of Sins'',  ''Love Abides'', ''Mercifulness, a Work of Love, Even if it Can Give Nothing and Is Capable of Doing Nothing'', ''The Victory of Reconciliation in Love Which Wins the Vanquished'', ''The work of Love in Remembering One Dead'', and ''The Work of Love in Praising Love''

==Style==
The ''Works'' as Kierkegaard himself states are Christian reflections and not discourses. It is written in a rhetorical style where he often repeats his words and gives numerous examples.
