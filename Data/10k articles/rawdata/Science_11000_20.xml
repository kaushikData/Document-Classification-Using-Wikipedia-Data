'''AURIGA''' (''Antenna Ultracriogenica Risonante per l'Indagine Gravitazionale Astronomica'') is an ultracryogenic resonant bar [[gravitational wave detector]] in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2012/12/threatening-to-discover-quantum-gravity-with-a-big-metal-bar/|title=Threatening (to discover) quantum gravity with a big metal bar|first=Matthew|last=Francis|publisher=[[Ars Technica]]|date=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is at the [[Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro]] of the [[Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare]], near [[Padova]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infn.it/esperimenti/esperimentien.php?gruppo=2&amp;sigla_naz=AURIGA |title=AURIGA EXPERIMENT, RESPONSIBLE: Massimo Cerdonio |publisher=INFN |accessdate=2012-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510140409/http://www.infn.it/esperimenti/esperimentien.php?gruppo=2&amp;sigla_naz=AURIGA |archivedate=2006-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is being used for research into [[gravitational waves]] and [[quantum gravity]].

When the oscillator gets hit with a burst of gravitational waves, it will excite the oscillator and it will vibrate for a time span longer than the duration of the gravitational wave burst. This allows for the extraction of the signal from the detector.

'''Analogical models''' are a method of representing a phenomenon of the world, often called the "target system" by another, more understandable or analysable system. They are also called '''dynamical analogies'''.

Two [[open system (systems theory)|open systems]] have ''analog'' representations (see illustration) if they are [[black box]] [[isomorphism#Applications|isomorphic systems]].

== Explanation ==

[[Analogy|Analogizing]] is the process of representing information about a particular subject (the analogue or source system) by another particular subject (the target system). A simple type of analogy is one that is based on shared properties (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy). Analogical models, also called "analog" or "analogue" models, therefore seek the analog systems that share properties with the target system as a means of representing the world. It is often practicable to construct source systems that are smaller and/or faster than the target system so that one can deduce ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' [[knowledge]] of target system behaviour. Analog devices are therefore those in which may differ in substance or structure but share properties of dynamic behaviour (Truit and Rogers, p.&amp;nbsp;1-3).

{{cquote|dynamical analogies establish the analogies between electrical, mechanical, acoustical, magnetic and electronic systems}} (Olson 1958, p.&amp;nbsp;2).

For example, in analog electronic circuits, one can use [[voltage]] to represent an arithmetic quantity; [[operational amplifier]]s might then represent the arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).Through the process of [[calibration]] these smaller/bigger, slower/faster systems are scaled up or down so that they match the functioning of the target system, and are therefore called analogs of the target system. Once the calibration has taken place, modellers speak of a ''one-to-one correspondence in behaviour'' between the primary system and its analog. Thus the behaviour of two systems can be determined by experimenting with one.
&lt;!--This doesn't seem right. Is the "model" the "target system" or the "analogue/source system"? It seems that Stanford encyclopedia and Wikipedia do not mesh!--&gt;

==Creating an analogical model==

Many different instruments and systems can be used to create an analogical model. A mechanical device can be used to represent mathematical calculations. For instance, the Phillips Hydraulic Computer [[MONIAC]] used the flow of water to model economic systems (the target system); electronic circuits can be used to represent both physiological and ecological systems. When a model is run on either an analog or digital computer this is known as the process of [[simulation]].
&lt;!-- EXAMPLES! WE NEED EXAMPLES! --&gt;

==Mechanical analogies==
{{Main|Mechanical-electrical analogies}}
Any number of systems could be used for mapping electrical phenomena to mechanical phenomena, but two principle systems are commonly used: the [[impedance analogy]] and the [[mobility analogy]]. The impedance analogy maps force to voltage whereas the mobility analogy maps force to current.

The impedance analogy preserves the analogy between [[electrical impedance]] and [[mechanical impedance]] but does not preserve the network topology. The mobility analogy preserves the network topology but does not preserve the analogy between impedances. Both preserve the correct energy and power relationships by making [[conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|power conjugate pairs]] of variables analogous.

==Hydraulic analogy==
*In a [[hydraulic analogy]], a [[water integrator]] might perform the mathematical operation of [[integral|integration]].

==Physiological analogies==
*[[Francis Crick]] used the study of the [[visual system]] as a proxy for the study of [[awareness]].

==Formal analogies==
&lt;!--Needs to be filled--&gt;
*"The same [[equation]]s have the same [[solution]]s." -- [[Richard Feynman]]
**For example, the inverse-square laws of [[gravitation]] and [[electromagnetism]] can be described by analogous equations on a geometrical basis, almost without regard to the physical details about [[mass]]es and [[charge (physics)|charges]].
**In [[population ecology]], [[differential equation]]s arise that are the same as those found in [[mechanics]], albeit with different interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzburg and Colyvan 2004; Colyvan and Ginzburg 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Recursion]] requires a similarity within a situation; for example, [[Archimedes]] used the [[myriad]] to count the [[The Sand Reckoner|number of grains of sand on a beach]] by using the concept of myriad myriads.

==Dynamical analogies==
Dynamical analogies establish analogies between systems in different energy domains by means of comparison of the system dynamic equations. There are many ways such analogies can be built, but one of the most useful methods is to form analogies between pairs of [[Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|power conjugate variables]]. That is, a pair of variables whose product is [[Power (physics)|power]]. Doing so preserves the correct energy flow between domains, a useful feature when modelling a system as an integrated whole. Examples of systems that require unified modelling are [[mechatronics]] and [[audio electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest such analogy is due to [[James Clerk Maxwell]] who, in 1873, associated mechanical [[force]] with electrical [[voltage]]. This analogy became so widespread that sources of voltage are still today referred to as [[electromotive force]]. The power conjugate of voltage is [[electric current]] which, in the Maxwell analogy, maps to mechanical [[velocity]]. [[Electrical impedance]] is the ratio of voltage and current, so by analogy, [[mechanical impedance]] is the ratio of force and velocity. The concept of impedance can be extended to other domains, for instance in acoustics and fluid flow it is the ratio of pressure to rate of flow. In general, impedance is the ratio of an ''effort'' variable and the ''flow'' variable that results. For this reason, the Maxwell analogy is often referred to as the [[impedance analogy]], although the concept of impedance was not conceived until 1886 by [[Oliver Heaviside]], some time after Maxwell's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Bishop, p. 8.4|Busch-Vishniac, p. 20|Smith, p. 1648|Martinsen &amp; Grimnes, p. 287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifying power conjugate variables still does not result in a unique analogy, there are multiple ways the conjugates and analogies can be specified. A new analogy was proposed by Floyd A. Firestone in 1933 now known as the [[mobility analogy]]. In this analogy electrical impedance is made analogous to mechanical mobility (the inverse of mechanical impedance). Firestone's idea was to make analogous variables that are measured across an element, and make analogous variables that flow through an element. For instance, the ''across'' variable voltage is the analogy of velocity, and the ''through'' variable current is the analogy of force. Firestone's analogy has the advantage of preserving the topology of element connections when converting between domains. A modified form of the through and across analogy was proposed in 1955 by [[Horace M. Trent]] and is the modern understanding of ''through and across''.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Bishop, p. 8.2|Smith, p. 1648|Busch-Vishniac, p. 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hamiltonian variables===
The Hamiltonian variables, also called the energy variables, are those variables which when time [[derivative|differentiated]] are equal to the power conjugate variables. The Hamiltonian variables are so called because they are the variables which usually appear in [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]. The Hamiltonian variables in the electrical domain are [[electric charge|charge]] (''q'') and [[flux linkage]] (λ) because,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d \lambda}{dt} = v &lt;/math&gt; ([[Faraday's law of induction]]) and, &lt;math&gt;\frac {dq}{dt} = i&lt;/math&gt;

In the translational mechanical domain the Hamiltonian variables are distance [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] (''x'') and [[momentum]] (''p'') because,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {dp}{dt} = F &lt;/math&gt; ([[Newton's second law|Newton's second law of motion]]) and, &lt;math&gt;\frac {dx}{dt} = u&lt;/math&gt;

There is a corresponding relationship for other analogies and sets of variables.&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The Hamiltonian variables are also called the energy variables. The [[integrand]] of a power conjugate variable with respect to a Hamiltonian variable is a measure of energy. For instance,
:&lt;math&gt; \int F dx &lt;/math&gt; and, &lt;math&gt; \int u dp &lt;/math&gt;
are both expressions of energy.&lt;ref&gt;Borutzky, pp. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Practical uses===
Maxwell's analogy was initially used merely to help explain electrical phenomena in more familiar mechanical terms. The work of Firestone, Trent and others moved the field well beyond this, looking to represent systems of multiple energy domains as a single system. In particular, designers started converting the mechanical parts of an electromechanical system to the electrical domain so that the whole system could be analyzed as an electrical circuit. [[Vannevar Bush]] was a pioneer of this kind of modelling in his development of [[analogue computer]]s, and a coherent presentation of this method was presented in a 1925 paper by Clifford A. Nickle.&lt;ref&gt;Care, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1950s onward, manufacturers of [[mechanical filter]]s, notably [[Collins Radio]], widely used these analogies in order to take the well -developed theory of [[filter design]] in electrical engineering and apply it to mechanical systems. The quality of filters required for radio applications could not be achieved with electrical components. Much better quality resonators (higher [[Q factor]]) could be made with mechanical parts but there was no equivalent filter theory in mechanical engineering. It was also necessary to have the mechanical parts, the [[transducer]]s, and the electrical components of the circuit analyzed as a complete system in order to predict the overall response of the filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Taylor &amp; Huang, p. 378|Carr, pp. 170–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harry F. Olson]] helped popularise the use of dynamical analogies in the audio electronics field with his book ''dynamical analogies'' first published in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Libbey, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-power-conjugate analogies===

A common analogy of magnetic circuits maps [[magnetomotive force]] (mmf) to voltage and [[magnetic flux]] (φ) to electrical current. However, mmf and φ are not power conjugate variables. The product of these is not in units of power and the ratio, known as [[magnetic reluctance]], does not measure the rate of dissipation of energy so is not a true impedance. Where a compatible analogy is required, mmf can be used as the effort variable and ''dφ/dt'' (rate of change of magnetic flux) will then be the flow variable. This is known as the [[gyrator-capacitor model]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamill, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

A widely used analogy in the thermal domain maps temperature difference as the effort variable and thermal power as the flow variable. Again, these are not power conjugate variables, and the ratio, known as [[thermal resistance]], is not really an analogy of either impedance or electrical resistance as far as energy flows are concerned. A compatible analogy could take temperature difference as the effort variable and [[entropy]] flow rate as the flow variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Busch-Vishniac, p. 19|Regtien, p. 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generalisation===

Many applications of dynamical models convert all energy domains in the system into an electrical circuit and then proceed to analyse the complete system in the electrical domain. There are, however, more generalised methods of representation. One such representation is through the use of [[bond graph]]s, introduced by Henry M. Paynter in 1960. It is usual to use the force-voltage analogy (impedance analogy) with bond graphs, but it is not a requirement to do so. Likewise Trent used a different representation (linear graphs) and his representation has become associated with the force-current analogy (mobility analogy), but again this is not mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, p. 8.8&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors discourage the use of domain specific terminology for the sake of generalisation. For instance, because much of the theory of dynamical analogies arose from electrical theory the power conjugate variables are sometimes called ''V-type'' and ''I-type'' according to whether they are analogs of voltage or current respectively in the electrical domain. Likewise, the Hamiltonian variables are sometimes called ''generalised momentum'' and ''generalised displacement'' according to whether they are analogs of momentum or displacement in the mechanical domain.&lt;ref&gt;Borutzky, pp. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electronic circuit analogies==

===Hydraulic analogy===
A fluid or [[hydraulic analogy]] of an electric circuit attempts to explain circuitry intuitively in terms of plumbing, where water is analogous to the mobile sea of charge within metals, pressure difference is analogous to [[voltage]], and water's flow rate is analogous to [[electric current]].

===Analogue computers===
Electronic circuits were used to model and simulate engineering systems such as aeroplanes and nuclear power plants before digital computers became widely available with fast enough turn over times to be practically useful. Electronic circuit instruments called [[analog computer]]s were used to speed up circuit construction time. However analog computers like the [[Norden bombsight]] could also consist of gears and pulleys in calculation.

Examples are Vogel and Ewel who published 'An Electrical Analog of a Trophic Pyramid' (1972, Chpt 11, pp.&amp;nbsp;105–121), Elmore and Sands (1949) who published circuits devised for research in nuclear physics and the study of fast electrical transients done under the Manhattan Project (however no circuits having application to weapon technology were included for security reasons), and [[Howard T. Odum]] (1994) who published circuits devised to analogically model ecological-economic systems at many scales of the geobiosphere.

==Philosophical conundrum==
The process of analogical modelling has philosophical difficulties. As noted in the [http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/stanford/entries/models-science/#ModLawNat Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy], there is the question of how the physical/biological laws of the target system relate to the analogical models created by humans to represent the target system. We seem to assume that the process of constructing analogical models gives us access to the fundamental laws governing the target system. However strictly speaking we only have empirical knowledge of the laws that hold true for the analogical system, and if the time constant for the target system is larger than the life cycle of human being (as in the case of the geobiosphere) it is therefore very difficult for any single human to empirically verify the validity of the extension of the laws of their model to the target system in their lifetime.

Archaeogenetics receives its name from the Greek word ''arkhaios'', meaning "ancient", and the term ''genetics'', meaning "the study of heredity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=archaeo|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term archaeogenetics was conceived by archaeologist [[Colin Renfrew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sokal|first=Robert R.|date=July 2001|title=Archaeogenetics: DNA and the Population Prehistory of Europe.|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=69|issue=1|pages=243–244|issn=0002-9297|pmc=1226043|doi=10.1086/321274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early work ==

=== Ludwik Hirszfeld (1884–1954) ===
[[Ludwik Hirszfeld]] was a Polish [[microbiologist]] and [[serologist]] who was the President of the Blood Group Section of the Second International Congress of Blood Transfusion. He founded [[blood group]] inheritance with Erich von Dungern in 1910, and contributed to it greatly throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steffen|first=Katrin|date=2013|title=Experts and the Modernization of the Nation: The Arena of Public Health in Poland in the First Half of the Twentieth Century|jstor=43819610|journal=Jahrbücher für Geschichte Osteuropas|volume=61|issue=4|pages=574–590}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied [[ABO blood groups]]. In one of his studies in 1919, Hirszfeld documented the ABO blood groups and hair color of people at the Macedonian front, leading to his discovery that the hair color and blood type had no correlation. In addition to that he observed that there was a decrease of blood group A from western Europe to India and the opposite for blood group B. He hypothesized that the east-to-west blood group ratio stemmed from two blood groups consisting of mainly A or B mutating from blood group O, and mixing through migration or intermingling. A majority of his work was researching the links of  blood types to sex, disease, climate, age, social class, and race. His work led him to discover that [[peptic ulcer]] was more dominant in blood group O, and that AB blood type mothers had a high male-to-female birth ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allan|first=T. M.|date=1963|title=Hirszfeld and the ABO Blood Groups|jstor=25565348|journal=British Journal of Preventive and Social Medicine|volume=17|issue=4|pages=166–171|doi=10.1136/jech.17.4.166|pmc=1058915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arthur Mourant (1904–1994) ===
[[Arthur Mourant]] was a British [[hematologist]] and [[chemist]]. He received many awards, most notably [[Fellowship of the Royal Society]]. His work included organizing the existing data on [[blood group]] gene frequencies, and largely contributing to the [[genetic map]] of the world through his investigation of blood groups in many populations. Mourant discovered the new blood group [[antigens]] of the [[Lewis antigen system|Lewis]], [[MNS antigen system|Henshaw]], [[Kell antigen system|Kell]], and [[Rhesus antigen|Rhesus]] systems, and analyzed the association of blood groups and various other diseases. He also focused on the biological significance of [[Genetic polymorphism|polymorphisms]]. His work provided the foundation for archaeogenetics because it facilitated the separation of genetic evidence for biological relationships between people. This genetic evidence was previously used for that purpose. It also provided material that could be used to appraise the theories of [[population genetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Derek F.|date=1997|title=Obituary: Arthur Mourant (1904-1994)|jstor=41435817|journal=Human Biology|volume=69|issue=2|pages=277–289|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== William Boyd (1903–1983) ===
[[William C. Boyd|William Boyd]] was an American [[Immunochemistry|immunochemist]] and [[biochemist]] who became famous for his research on the genetics of race in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FE6NDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=william+clouser+boyd#v=onepage&amp;q=william%20clouser%20boyd&amp;f=false|title=Robert Oppenheimer: A Life Inside the Center|last=Monk|first=Ray|date=2014|publisher=Anchor Books|isbn=9780385722049|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1940s, Boyd and Karl O. Renkonen independently discovered that [[lectin]]s react differently to various blood types, after finding that the crude extracts of the [[Phaseolus lunatus|lima bean]] and [[Vicia cracca|tufted vetch]] agglutinated the [[red blood cell]]s from blood type A but not blood types B or O. This ultimately led to the disclosure of thousands of plants that contained these proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Espino-Solis|first=Gerardo Pavel|date=April 2015|title=Lectins: A brief review|url=http://www.scielo.org.co/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S0121-40042015000100001&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|journal=Vitae|volume=22|issue=1|pages=9–11|doi=10.17533/udea.vitae.v22n1a01|issn=0121-4004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to examine racial differences and the distribution and migration patterns of various racial groups, Boyd systematically collected and classified blood samples from around the world, leading to his discovery that [[blood groups]] are not influenced by the environment, and are inherited. In his book ''Genetics and the Races of Man'' (1950), Boyd categorized the world population into 13 distinct races, based on their different blood type profiles and his idea that human races are populations with differing [[allele]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Star Lord|last=Boyd|first=William Clouser|date=2016-08-07|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|isbn=9781536885545|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=b08ef2b3-8588-4fba-a58b-5b733b5486a9%40sessionmgr4007&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU%3d#AN=203014321&amp;db=brb|title=Chambers Biographical Dictionary (Bio Ref Bank)|last=Parry|first=Melanie|date=1997|website=|publisher=Chambers Harrap|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most abundant information sources regarding inheritable traits linked to race remains the study of blood groups.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Methods ==

=== Fossil DNA preservation ===
[[Fossil]] retrieval starts with selecting an [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation site]]. Potential excavation sites are usually identified with the [[mineralogy]] of the location and visual detection of bones in the area. However, there are more ways to discover excavation zones using technology such as field portable [[x-ray fluorescence]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=David R.|last2=Cohen|first2=Emma J.|last3=Graham|first3=Ian T.|last4=Soares|first4=Georgia G.|last5=Hand|first5=Suzanne J.|last6=Archer|first6=Michael|date=October 2017|title=Geochemical exploration for vertebrate fossils using field portable XRF|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375674216304447|journal=Journal of Geochemical Exploration|volume=181|pages=1–9|doi=10.1016/j.gexplo.2017.06.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dense Stereo Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Callieri|first=Marco|last2=Dell'Unto|first2=Nicolo|last3=Dellepiane|first3=Matteo|last4=Scopigno|first4=Roberto|last5=Söderberg|first5=Bengt|last6=Larsson|first6=Lars|date=2011|title=Documentation and Interpretation of an Archeological Excavation: an experience with Dense Stereo Reconstruction tools|url=http://lup.lub.lu.se/record/2062881|journal=[Host publication title missing]|publisher=Eurographics Association|pages=33–40|isbn=9783905674347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tools used include [[Knife|knives]], [[brush]]es, and pointed [[trowel]]s which assist in the removal of fossils from the earth.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digging Up Bones: The Excavation, Treatment, and Study of Human Skeletal Remains|last=Brothwell|first=Don R.|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1981|isbn=9780801498756|location=|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To avoid [[Contamination|contaminating]] the [[ancient DNA]], [[Sample (material)|specimens]] are handled with gloves and stored in -20&amp;nbsp;°C immediately after being unearthed. Ensuring that the fossil sample is analyzed in a lab that has not been used for other [[DNA]] analysis could prevent contamination as well.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scholz|first=Michael|last2=Bachmann|first2=Lutz|last3=Nicholson|first3=Graeme J.|last4=Bachmann|first4=Jutta|last5=Giddings|first5=Ian|last6=Rüschoff-Thale|first6=Barbara|last7=Czarnetzki|first7=Alfred|last8=Pusch|first8=Carsten M.|date=2000-06-01|title=Genomic Differentiation of Neanderthals and Anatomically Modern Man Allows a Fossil–DNA-Based Classification of Morphologically Indistinguishable Hominid Bones|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929707635447|journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=66|issue=6|pages=1927–1932|doi=10.1086/302949}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bones are [[milling (grinding)|milled]] to a powder and treated with a solution before the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Samples for [[Polymerase chain reaction|DNA amplification]] may not necessarily be fossil bones. Preserved skin, salt- preserved or air-dried, can also be used in certain situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=H.|last2=Golenberg|first2=E. M.|last3=Shoshani|first3=J.|date=June 1997|title=Proboscidean DNA from museum and fossil specimens: an assessment of ancient DNA extraction and amplification techniques|journal=Biochemical Genetics|volume=35|issue=5–6|pages=165–179|issn=0006-2928|pmid=9332711}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA preservation is difficult because the bone [[fossilisation]] degrades and DNA is chemically modified, usually by [[bacteria]] and [[Fungus|fungi]] in the soil. The best time to extract DNA from a fossil is when it is freshly out of the ground as it contains six times the DNA when compared to stored bones. The temperature of extraction site also affects the amount of obtainable DNA, evident by a decrease in success rate for DNA amplification if the fossil is found in warmer regions. A drastic change of a fossil's environment also affects DNA preservation. Since excavation causes an abrupt change in the fossil's environment, it may lead to [[Physiological chemistry|physiochemical]] change in the DNA molecule. Moreover, DNA preservation is also affected by other factors such as the treatment of the unearthed fossil like (e.g. washing, brushing and sun dring), [[pH]], [[irradiation]], the chemical composition of bone and soil, and [[hydrology]]. There are three perseveration diagenetic phases. The first phase is bacterial [[putrefaction]], which is estimated to cause a 15-fold degradation of DNA. Phase 2 is when bone chemically degrades, mostly by [[depurination]]. The third diagenetic phase occurs after the fossil is excavated and stored, in which bone DNA degradation occurs most rapidly.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;

===Methods of DNA extraction ===
Once a specimen is collected from an archaeological site, DNA can be extracted through a series of processes.&lt;ref name=":43"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hagelberg|first=Erika|last2=Clegg|first2=J. B.|date=1991-04-22|title=Isolation and Characterization of DNA from Archaeological Bone|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/244/1309/45|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=244|issue=1309|pages=45–50|doi=10.1098/rspb.1991.0049|issn=0962-8452|pmid=1677195}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the more common methods utilizes silica and takes advantage of [[polymerase chain reaction]]s in order to collect [[ancient DNA]] from bone samples.&lt;ref name=":53"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rohland|first=Nadin|last2=Hofreiter|first2=Michael|date=July 2007|title=Ancient DNA extraction from bones and teeth|url=http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v2/n7/full/nprot.2007.247.html?foxtrotcallback=true|journal=Nature Protocols|language=en|volume=2|issue=7|pages=1756–1762|doi=10.1038/nprot.2007.247|issn=1754-2189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several challenges that add to the difficulty when attempting to extract ancient DNA from fossils and prepare it for analysis. DNA is continuously being split up. While the organism is alive these splits are repaired; however, once an organism has died, the DNA will begin to deteriorate without repair. This results in samples having strands of DNA measuring around 100 [[base pair]]s in length. Contamination is another significant challenge at multiple steps throughout the process. Often other DNA, such as bacterial DNA, will be present in the original sample. To avoid contamination it is necessary to take many precautions such as separate ventilation systems and workspaces for ancient DNA extraction work.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Handt|first=O.|last2=Höss|first2=M.|last3=Krings|first3=M.|last4=Pääbo|first4=S.|date=1994-06-01|title=Ancient DNA: Methodological challenges|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01921720|journal=Experientia|language=en|volume=50|issue=6|pages=524–529|doi=10.1007/BF01921720|issn=0014-4754}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best samples to use are fresh fossils as uncareful washing can lead to [[mold]] growth.&lt;ref name=":43"/&gt; DNA coming from fossils also occasionally contains a compound that inhibits DNA replication.&lt;ref name=":73"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Höss|first=M|last2=Pääbo|first2=S|date=1993-08-11|title=DNA extraction from Pleistocene bones by a silica-based purification method.|pmc=309938|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=21|issue=16|pages=3913–3914|issn=0305-1048|pmid=8396242|doi=10.1093/nar/21.16.3913}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coming to a consensus on which methods are best at mitigating challenges is also difficult due to the lack of repeatability caused by the uniqueness of specimens.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

[[DNA separation by silica adsorption|Silica-based DNA extraction]] is a method used as a purification step to extract DNA from archaeological bone [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and yield DNA that can be amplified using [[Polymerase chain reaction|polymerase chain reaction (PCR)]] techniques.&lt;ref name=":73"/&gt;  This process works by using silica as a means to bind DNA and separate it from other components of the fossil process that inhibit [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] amplification.  However, silica itself is also a strong PCR [[Reaction inhibitor|inhibitor]], so careful measures must be taken to ensure that silica is removed from the DNA after extraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Dongya Y.|last2=Eng|first2=Barry|last3=Waye|first3=John S.|last4=Dudar|first4=J. Christopher|last5=Saunders|first5=Shelley R.|date=1998-04-01|title=Improved DNA extraction from ancient bones using silica-based spin columns|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(199804)105:43.0.CO;2-1/abstract|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|language=en|volume=105|issue=4|pages=539–543|doi=10.1002/(sici)1096-8644(199804)105:4&lt;539::aid-ajpa10&gt;3.0.co;2-1|issn=1096-8644}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The general process for extracting DNA using the silica-based method is outlined by the following:&lt;ref name=":53"/&gt;
# Bone specimen is cleaned and the outer layer is scraped off
# Sample is collected from preferably compact section
# Sample is ground to fine powder and added to an extraction solution to release DNA
# Silica solution is added and centrifuged to facilitate DNA binding
# Binding solution is removed and a buffer is added to the solution to release the DNA from the silica
One of the main advantages of [[DNA separation by silica adsorption|silica-based DNA extraction]] is that it is relatively quick and efficient, requiring only a basic [[laboratory]] setup and chemicals.  It is also independent of sample size, as the process can be scaled to accommodate larger or smaller quantities.  Another benefit is that the process can be executed at room temperature.  However, this method does contain some drawbacks.  Mainly, [[DNA separation by silica adsorption|silica-based DNA extraction]] can only be applied to bone and teeth samples; they cannot be used on [[soft tissue]].  While they work well with a variety of different fossils, they may be less effective in fossils that are not fresh (e.g. treated fossils for [[museum]]s).  Also, contamination poses a risk for all DNA replication in general, and this method may result in misleading results if applied to contaminated material.&lt;ref name=":53"/&gt;

[[Polymerase chain reaction]] is a process that can amplify segments of DNA and is often used on extracted ancient DNA. It has three main steps: [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]], [[Annealing (biology)|annealing]], and extension. Denaturation splits the DNA into two single strands at high temperatures. Annealing involves attaching primer strands of DNA to the single strands that allow [[Taq polymerase]] to attach to the DNA. Extension occurs when [[Taq polymerase]] is added to the sample and matches base pairs to turn the two single strands into two complete double strands.&lt;ref name=":43"/&gt; This process is repeated many times, and is usually repeated a higher number of times when used with [[ancient DNA]].&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bouwman|first=Abigail|last2=Rühli|first2=Frank|date=2016-09-01|title=Archaeogenetics in evolutionary medicine|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00109-016-1438-8|journal=Journal of Molecular Medicine|language=en|volume=94|issue=9|pages=971–977|doi=10.1007/s00109-016-1438-8|issn=0946-2716}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some issues with PCR is that it requires overlapping primer pairs for ancient DNA due to the short sequences. There can also be “jumping PCR” which causes recombination during the PCR process which can make analyzing the DNA more difficult in inhomogeneous samples.

===Methods of DNA analysis ===
DNA extracted from fossil remains is primarily sequenced using [[Massive parallel sequencing]],&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pääbo|first=Svante|last2=Poinar|first2=Hendrik|last3=Serre|first3=David|last4=Jaenicke-Despres|first4=Viviane|last5=Hebler|first5=Juliane|last6=Rohland|first6=Nadin|last7=Kuch|first7=Melanie|last8=Krause|first8=Johannes|last9=Vigilant|first9=Linda|date=2004|title=Genetic analyses from ancient DNA|journal=Annual Review of Genetics|volume=38|pages=645–679|doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.37.110801.143214|issn=0066-4197|pmid=15568989}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows simultaneous amplification and sequencing of all DNA segments in a sample, even when it is highly fragmented and of low concentration.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; It involves attaching a generic sequence to every single strand that generic primers can bond to, and thus all of the DNA present is amplified.  This is generally more costly and time intensive than PCR but due to the difficulties involved in [[ancient DNA]] amplification it is cheaper and more efficient.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; One method of [[massive parallel sequencing]], developed by Margulies et al., employs bead-based emulsion [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] and [[pyrosequencing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Margulies|first=Marcel|last2=Egholm|first2=Michael|last3=Altman|first3=William E.|last4=Attiya|first4=Said|last5=Bader|first5=Joel S.|last6=Bemben|first6=Lisa A.|last7=Berka|first7=Jan|last8=Braverman|first8=Michael S.|last9=Chen|first9=Yi-Ju|date=2005-09-15|title=Genome sequencing in microfabricated high-density picolitre reactors|journal=Nature|volume=437|issue=7057|pages=376–380|doi=10.1038/nature03959|issn=1476-4687|pmc=1464427|pmid=16056220|bibcode=2005Natur.437..376M}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was found to be powerful in analyses of aDNA because it avoids potential loss of sample, substrate competition for templates, and error propagation in replication.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Richard E.|last2=Krause|first2=Johannes|last3=Ptak|first3=Susan E.|last4=Briggs|first4=Adrian W.|last5=Ronan|first5=Michael T.|last6=Simons|first6=Jan F.|last7=Du|first7=Lei|last8=Egholm|first8=Michael|last9=Rothberg|first9=Jonathan M.|date=2006-11-16|title=Analysis of one million base pairs of Neanderthal DNA|url=https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7117/abs/nature05336.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=444|issue=7117|pages=330–336|doi=10.1038/nature05336|issn=0028-0836|bibcode=2006Natur.444..330G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common way to analyze aDNA sequence is to compare it with a known sequence from other sources, and this could be done in different ways for different purposes.

The identity of the fossil remain can be uncovered by comparing its DNA sequence with those of known species using software such as BLASTN.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; This archaeogenetic approach is especially helpful when the [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] of the fossil is ambiguous.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palmer|first=Sarah A.|last2=Smith|first2=Oliver|last3=Allaby|first3=Robin G.|date=2012-01-20|title=The blossoming of plant archaeogenetics|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S094096021100077X|journal=Annals of Anatomy - Anatomischer Anzeiger|series=Special Issue: Ancient DNA|volume=194|issue=1|pages=146–156|doi=10.1016/j.aanat.2011.03.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from that, species identification can also be done by finding specific [[genetic marker]]s in an aDNA sequence. For example, the [[American indigenous people|American indigenous population]] is characterized by specific mitochondrial [[Restriction fragment length polymorphism|RFLPs]] and [[Deletion (genetics)|deletions]] defined by Wallace et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolman|first=Connie J.|last2=Tuross|first2=Noreen|date=2000-01-01|title=Ancient DNA analysis of human populations|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(200001)111:13.0.CO;2-3/abstract|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|language=en|volume=111|issue=1|pages=5–23|doi=10.1002/(sici)1096-8644(200001)111:1&lt;5::aid-ajpa2&gt;3.0.co;2-3|pmid=10618586|issn=1096-8644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

aDNA comparison study can also reveal the evolutionary relationship between two species. The number of base differences between DNA of an ancient species and that of a closely related extant species can be used to estimate the [[Genetic divergence|divergence]] time of those two species from their last [[common ancestor]].&lt;ref name=":33"/&gt; The [[Phylogenetic tree|phylogeny]] of some extinct species, such as Australian marsupial wolves and American ground [[sloth]]s, has been constructed by this method.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; [[Mitochondrial DNA]] in animals and [[chloroplast DNA]] in plants are usually used for this purpose because they have hundreds of copies per cell and thus are more easily accessible in ancient fossils.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

Another method to investigate relationship between two species is through [[Nucleic acid hybridization|DNA hybridization]]. Single-stranded DNA segments of both species are allowed to form complementary pair bonding with each other. More closely related species have a more similar genetic makeup, and thus a stronger [[Nucleic acid hybridization|hybridization]] signal. Scholz et al. conducted [[Southern blot|southern blot hybridization]] on [[Neanderthal]] aDNA (extracted from fossil remain W-NW and Krapina). The results showed weak ancient human-Neanderthal hybridization and strong ancient human-modern human hybridization. The human-chimpanzee and neanderthal-chimpanzee hybridization are of similarly weak strength. This suggests that humans and neanderthals are not as closely related as two individuals of the same species are, but they are more related to each other than to chimpanzees.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;

There have also been some attempts to decipher aDNA to provide valuable [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] information of ancient species. This is always done by mapping aDNA sequence onto the [[karyotype]] of a well-studied closely related species, which share a lot of similar phenotypic traits.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; For example, Green et al. compared the aDNA sequence from Neanderthal Vi-80 fossil with modern human X and Y chromosome sequence, and they found a similarity in 2.18 and 1.62 bases per 10,000 respectively, suggesting Vi-80 sample was from a male individual.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Other similar studies include finding of a [[mutation]] associated with dwarfism in ''Arabidopsis'' in ancient Nubian [[cotton]],&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt; and investigation on the bitter taste perception locus in Neanderthals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lalueza-Fox|first=Carles|last2=Gigli|first2=Elena|last3=Rasilla|first3=Marco de la|last4=Fortea|first4=Javier|last5=Rosas|first5=Antonio|date=2009-08-12|title=Bitter taste perception in Neanderthals through the analysis of the TAS2R38 gene|url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2009/08/07/rsbl.2009.0532|journal=Biology Letters|volume=5|issue=6|language=en|pages=809–11|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.0532|issn=1744-9561|pmid=19675003|pmc=2828008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Human archaeology ===

==== Africa ====
Modern humans arose in Africa approximately 200 kya (thousand years ago).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Michael C.|last2=Tishkoff|first2=Sarah A.|date=2010-02-23|title=The Evolution of Human Genetic and Phenotypic Variation in Africa|url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(09)02065-X|journal=Current Biology|language=English|volume=20|issue=4|pages=R166–R173|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2009.11.050|issn=0960-9822|pmid=20178763|pmc=2945812}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examination of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), Y-chromosome DNA, and X-chromosome DNA indicate that the earliest population to leave Africa consisted of approximately 1500 males and females.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It has been suggested by various studies that populations were geographically “structured” to some degree prior to the expansion out of Africa; this is suggested by the antiquity of shared mtDNA lineages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One study of 121 populations from various places throughout the continent found 14 genetic and linguistic “clusters,” suggesting an ancient geographic structure to African populations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In general, genotypic and phenotypic analysis have shown  “large and subdivided throughout much of their evolutionary history.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Genetic analysis has supported archaeological hypotheses of a large-scale migrations of Bantu speakers into Southern Africa approximately 5 kya.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Microsatellite DNA, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and insertion/deletion polymorphisms (INDELS) have shown that Nilo-Saharan speaking populations originate from Sudan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, there is genetic evidence that Chad-speaking descendents of Nilo-Saharan speakers migrated from Sudan to Lake Chad about 8 kya.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Genetic evidence has also indicated that non-African populations made significant contributions to the African gene pool.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, the Saharan African Beja people have high levels of Middle-Eastern as well as East African Cushitic DNA.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Europe ====
Analysis of mtDNA shows that Eurasia was occupied in a single migratory event between 60 and 70 kya.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soares|first=Pedro|last2=Achilli|first2=Alessandro|last3=Semino|first3=Ornella|last4=Davies|first4=William|last5=Macaulay|first5=Vincent|last6=Bandelt|first6=Hans-Jürgen|last7=Torroni|first7=Antonio|last8=Richards|first8=Martin B.|date=2010-02-23|title=The Archaeogenetics of Europe|url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(09)02069-7|journal=Current Biology|language=English|volume=20|issue=4|pages=R174–R183|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2009.11.054|issn=0960-9822}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Genetic evidence shows that occupation of the Near East and Europe happened no earlier than 50 kya.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Studying haplogroup U has shown separate dispersals from the Near East both into Europe and into North Africa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Much of the work done in archaeogenetics focuses on the Neolithic transition in Europe.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/889666433|title=The Cambridge World History, Volume II|last=Baker|first=Graeme|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780521192187|location=Cambridge|pages=|oclc=889666433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cavalli-Svorza’s analysis of genetic-geographic patterns led him to conclude that there was a massive influx of Near Eastern populations into Europe at the start of the Neolithic.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This view led him  “to strongly emphasize the expanding early farmers at the expense of the indigenous Mesolithic foraging populations.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; mtDNA analysis in the 1990s, however, contradicted this view. M.B. Richards estimated that merely 10-22% of extant European mtDNA’s had come from Near Eastern populations during the Neolithic.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Most mtDNA’s were “already established” among existing Mesolithic and Paleolithic groups.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Most “control-region lineages” of modern European mtDNA are traced to a founder event of reoccupying northern Europe towards the end of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] (LGM).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One study of extant European mtDNA’s suggest this reoccupation occurred after the end of the LGM, although another suggests it occurred before.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Analysis of haplogroups V, H, and U5 support a “pioneer colonization” model of European occupation, with incorporation of foraging populations into arriving Neolithic populations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Furthermore, analysis of ancient DNA, not just extant DNA, is shedding light on some issues. For instance, comparison of neolithic and mesolithic DNA has indicated that the development of dairying preceded widespread lactose tolerance.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== South Asia ====
South Asia has served as the major early corridor for geographical dispersal of modern humans from out-of-Africa.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Studies of mtDNA line M suggest that the first occupants of India were Austro-Asiatic speakers who entered about 45-60 kya.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Majumder|first=Partha P.|date=2010-02-23|title=The Human Genetic History of South Asia|url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(09)02068-5|journal=Current Biology|language=English|volume=20|issue=4|pages=R184–R187|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2009.11.053|issn=0960-9822|pmid=20178765}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian gene pool has contributions from earliest settlers, as well as West Asian and Central Asian populations from migrations no earlier than 8 kya.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The lack of variation in mtDNA lineages compared to the Y-chromosome lineages indicate that primarily males partook in these migrations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The discovery of two subbranches U2i and U2e of the U mtDNA lineage, which arose in Central Asia has “modulated” views of a large migration from Central Asia into India, as the two branches diverged 50 kya.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Furthermore, U2e is found in large percentages in Europe but not India, and vice versa for U2i, implying U2i is native to India.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== East Asia ====
Analysis of mtDNA and NRY (non-recombining region of Y chromosome) sequences have indicated that the first major dispersal out of Africa went through Saudi Arabia and the Indian coast 50-100 kya, and  a second major dispersal occurred 15-50 kya north of the Himalayas.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stoneking|first=Mark|last2=Delfin|first2=Frederick|date=2010-02-23|title=The Human Genetic History of East Asia: Weaving a Complex Tapestry|url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(09)02067-3|journal=Current Biology|language=English|volume=20|issue=4|pages=R188–R193|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2009.11.052|issn=0960-9822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much work has been done to discover the extent of north-to-south and south-to-north migrations within Eastern Asia.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Comparing the genetic diversity of northeastern groups with southeastern groups has allowed archaeologists to conclude many of the northeast Asian groups came from the southeast.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Pan-Asian SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) study found “a strong and highly significant correlation between haplotype diversity and latitude,” which, when coupled with demographic analysis, supports the case for a primarily south-to-north occupation of East Asia.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Archaeogenetics has also been used to study hunter-gatherer populations in the region, such as the Ainu from Japan and Negrito groups in the Philippines.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For example, the Pan-Asian SNP study found that Negrito populations in the Philippines and the Negrito populations in the Philippines were more closely related to non-Negrito local populations than to each other, suggesting Negrito and non-Negrito populations are linked by one entry event into East Asia.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Americas  ====
Archaeogenetics has been used to better understand the populating of the Americas from Asia.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Rourke|first=Dennis H.|last2=Raff|first2=Jennifer A.|date=2010-02-23|title=The Human Genetic History of the Americas: The Final Frontier|url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(09)02066-1|journal=Current Biology|language=English|volume=20|issue=4|pages=R202–R207|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2009.11.051|issn=0960-9822}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native American mtDNA haplogroups have been estimated to be between 15 and 20 kya, although there is some variation in these estimates.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Genetic data has been used to propose various theories regarding how the Americas were colonized.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Although the most widely held theory suggests “three waves” of migration after the LGM through the Bering Strait, genetic data have given rise to alternative hypotheses.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; For example, one hypothesis proposes a migration from Siberia to South America 20-15 kya and a second migration that occurred after glacial recession.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Y-chromosome data has led some to hold that there was a single migration starting from the Aldai Mountains of Siberia between 17.2- 10.1 kya, after the LGM.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Analysis of both mtDNA and Y-chromosome DNA reveals evidence of “small, founding populations.”&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Studying haplogroups has led some scientists to conclude that a southern migration into the Americas from one small population was impossible, although separate analysis has found that such a model is feasible if such a migration happened along the coasts.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Australia and New Guinea ====
Finally, archaeogenetics has been used to study the occupation of Australia and New Guinea.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kayser|first=Manfred|date=2010-02-23|title=The Human Genetic History of Oceania: Near and Remote Views of Dispersal|url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(09)02120-4|journal=Current Biology|language=English|volume=20|issue=4|pages=R194–R201|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2009.12.004|issn=0960-9822|pmid=20178767}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aborigines of Australia and New Guinea are phenotypically very similar, but mtDNA has shown that this is due to convergence from living in similar conditions.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Non-coding regions of mt-DNA have shown “no similarities” between the aboriginal populations of Australia and New Guinea.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Furthermore, no major NRY lineages are shared between the two populations. The high frequency of a single NRY lineage unique to Australia coupled with “low diversity of lineage-associated Y-chromosomal short tandem repeat (Y-STR) haplotypes” provide evidence for a “recent founder or bottleneck” event in Australia.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; But there is relatively large variation in mtDNA, which would imply that the bottleneck effect impacted males primarily.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Together, NRY and mtDNA studies show that the splitting event between the two groups was over 50kya, casting doubt on recent common ancestry between the two.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Plants and animals ===
Archaeogentics has been used to understand the development of [[domestication]] of plants and animals.

==== Domestication of plants ====
The combination of genetics and archeological findings have been used to trace the earliest signs of plant [[Domestication of plants|domestication]] around the world. However, since the nuclear, mitochondrial, and chloroplast [[genome]]s used to trace domestication’s moment of origin have evolved at different rates, its use to trace [[genealogy]] have been somewhat problematic.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; [[Nuclear DNA]] in specific is used over [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] and [[chloroplast DNA]] because of its faster mutation rate as well as its intraspecific variation due to a higher consistency of [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] [[genetic marker]]s.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Findings in crop ‘domestication genes’ (traits that were specifically selected for or against)  include
* tb1 (teosinte branched1) - affecting the [[apical dominance]] in maize&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;
* tga1 (teosinte glume architecture1) - making maize kernels compatible for the convenience of humans &lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;
* te1 (Terminal ear1) - affecting the weight of kernels&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;
* fw2.2 - affecting the weight in tomatoes&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;
* BoCal - [[inflorescence]] of broccoli and cauliflower&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;
Through the study of archaeogenetics in plant domestication, signs of the first global economy can also be uncovered. The geographical distribution of new crops highly selected in one region found in another where it would have not originally been introduced serve as evidence of a trading network for the production and consumption of readily available resources.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeder, Emshwiller, Smith, Bradley|first=|date=March 2006|title=Documenting domestication: the intersection of genetics and archaeology|url=https://anthropology.si.edu/archaeobio/images/zederetal_2006_docdom_tig.pdf|journal=Trends in Genetics|volume=22|pages=139–146|via=Science Direct|doi=10.1016/j.tig.2006.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Domestication of animals ====
Archaeogenetics has been used to study the domestication of animals.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://anthropology.si.edu/archaeobio/images/zederetal_2006_docdom_tig.pdf|title=Documenting domestication: the inter- section of genetics and archaeology|last=Zeder et. al|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By analyzing genetic diversity in domesticated animal populations researchers can search for genetic markers in DNA to give valuable insight about possible traits of progenitor species.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; These traits are then used to help distinguish archaeological remains between wild and domesticated specimens.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The genetic studies can also lead to the identification of ancestors for domesticated animals.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The information gained from genetics studies on current populations helps guide the Archaeologist’s search for documenting these ancestors.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Archaeogenetics has been used to trace the domestication of pigs throughout the old world.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/104/39/15276.full.pdf|title=Ancient DNA, pig domestication, and the spread of the Neolithic into Europe|last=Larson et. al|first=|date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies also reveal evidence about the details of early farmers.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Methods of Archaeogenetics have also been used to further understand the development of domestication of dogs.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/109/23/8878.full.pdf|title=Rethinking dog domestication by integrating genetics, archeology, and biogeography|last=Larson et. al|first=|date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic studies have shown that all dogs are descendants from the gray wolf, however, it is currently unknown when, where, and how many times dogs were domesticated.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Some genetic studies have indicated multiple domestications while others have not.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Archaeological findings help better understand this complicated past by providing solid evidence about the progression of the domestication of dogs.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; As early humans domesticated dogs the archaeological remains of buried dogs became increasingly more abundant.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Not only does this provide more opportunities for archaeologists to study the remains, it also provides clues about early human culture.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3524">In [[astronomy]], the '''Arcturus moving group''' or '''Arcturus stream''' is a [[moving group]] or [[stellar stream]] which includes the nearby bright star [[Arcturus]]. It comprises many stars which share similar [[proper motion]] and so appear to be physically associated.

This group of stars is not in the plane of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy and has been proposed as a remnant of an ancient dwarf [[satellite galaxy]], long since disrupted and assimilated into the Milky Way. It consists of old stars deficient in heavy elements.&lt;ref name="ghosts"&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Scientific American| title=The Ghosts of Galaxies Past| first=Rodrigo| last=Ibata| author2=Gibson, Brad| pages=40–45|date=April 2007| pmid=17479629| volume=296| issue=4| doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0407-40|bibcode = 2007SciAm.296d..40I }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bensby and colleagues in analysing chemical composition of F and G dwarf stars in the solar neighbourhood found there was no difference in chemical makeup of stars from the stream, suggesting an intragalactic rather than extragalactic origin.&lt;ref name="Bensby 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bensby, T.|author2=Feltzing, S.|author3=Oey, M.

However, it is unclear how this could produce an overdensity of stars in the thick disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title=The Arcturus Moving Group: Its Place in the Galaxy | display-authors=1 | last1=Williams | first1=Mary E.

The '''unified atomic mass unit''' or '''dalton''' (symbol: u, or Da) is a standard [[Unit of measurement|unit]] of mass that quantifies [[mass]] on an atomic or molecular scale ([[atomic mass]]). One unified atomic mass unit is approximately the mass of one [[nucleon]] (either a single [[proton]] or [[neutron]]) and is numerically equivalent to 1{{nbsp}}[[Molar mass|g/mol]].&lt;ref name="Stryer 2007 35"&gt;

The '''atomic mass unit''' ('''amu''') without the "unified" prefix is technically an obsolete unit based on oxygen, which was replaced in 1961. However, many sources still use the term ''amu'' but now define it in the same way as u (i.e., based on carbon-12).&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, most uses of the terms ''atomic mass units'' and ''amu'', today, actually refer to unified atomic mass unit. For standardization, a specific atomic nucleus ([[carbon-12]] vs. [[oxygen-16]]) had to be chosen because the average mass of a nucleon depends on the count of the nucleons in the atomic nucleus due to [[binding energy#Mass change|mass defect]]. This is also why the mass of a proton or neutron by itself is more than (and not equal to) 1&amp;nbsp;u.

The atomic mass unit is not the unit of mass in the [[atomic units]] system, which is rather the [[electron rest mass]] (''m''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;).

== History of amu ==
The [[standard atomic weight]] (or atomic weight) scale has traditionally been a relative value, that is without a unit, with the first relative atomic mass basis suggested by [[John Dalton]] in 1803 as &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H.&lt;ref name="Petley89"&gt;
{{citation

 | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 175–79
 | doi = 10.1109/19.192268
 | year = 1989
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the initial mass of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H being used as the natural unit for relative atomic mass, it was suggested by [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] that relative atomic mass would be best expressed in terms of units of {{sfrac|1|16}} mass of oxygen ([[Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights#International atomic weight unit: H=1 or O=16|1903]]). This evaluation was made prior to the discovery of the existence of elemental isotopes, which occurred in 1912.&lt;ref name="Petley89" /&gt;

The discovery of isotopic oxygen in 1929 led to a divergence in relative atomic mass representation, with isotopically weighted oxygen (i.e., naturally occurring oxygen relative atomic mass) given a value of exactly 16 atomic mass units (amu) in chemistry, while pure &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O (oxygen-16) was given the mass value of exactly 16&amp;nbsp;amu in physics.

The divergence of these values could result in errors in computations, and was unwieldy. The chemistry amu, based on the relative atomic mass (atomic weight) of natural oxygen (including the heavy naturally-occurring isotopes &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O), was about {{val|1.000282}} as massive as the physics amu, based on pure isotopic &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O.

For these and other reasons, the reference standard for both physics and chemistry was changed to [[carbon-12]] in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;

 | url = http://www.iupac.org/publications/ci/2004/2601/1_holden.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of carbon-12 was made to minimise further divergence with prior literature.&lt;ref name="Petley89" /&gt; The new and current unit was referred to as the ''unified atomic mass unit'', u.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=unified atomic mass unit| file = U06554 | accessdate = 2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and given a new symbol, "u", which replaced the now deprecated "amu" that had been connected to the old oxygen-based system. The dalton (Da) is another name for the unified atomic mass unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=dalton| file = D01514 | accessdate = 2015-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; 1 \,\mathrm{u} = m_{\mathrm{u}} = \frac{1}{12}m\left({}^{12}\mathrm{C}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Despite this change, modern sources often still use the old term "amu" but define it as u ({{sfrac|12}} of the mass of a carbon-12 atom), as mentioned in the article's introduction. Therefore, in general, "amu" likely does not refer to the old oxygen standard unit, unless the source material originates from the 1960s or before.

== Terminology ==
The unified atomic mass unit and the dalton are different names for the same unit of measure.  As with other unit names such as watt and newton, ''dalton'' is not capitalized in English, but its symbol, Da, is capitalized. With the introduction of the name ''dalton'', there has been a gradual change towards using that name in preference to the name, ''unified atomic mass unit'':
* In 1993, the [[IUPAC|International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) approved the use of the dalton with the qualification that the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures|CGPM]] had not given its approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | isbn=0-632-03583-8
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2003, the Consultative Committee for Units, part of the [[CIPM]], recommended a preference for the usage of the "dalton" over the "unified atomic mass unit" as it "is shorter and works better with prefixes".&lt;ref name="bipm-ccu115"&gt;

 | accessdate=14 Aug 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2005, the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics endorsed the use of the dalton as an alternative to the unified atomic mass unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url         = http://archive.iupap.org/commissions/c2/reports/ga-05.html
 |title       = IUPAP: C2: Report 2005
 |accessdate  = 2018-07-15
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2006, in the 8th edition of the formal definition of [[SI]], the [[CIPM]] cataloged the dalton alongside the unified atomic mass unit as a "Non-SI unit whose values in SI units must be obtained experimentally: Units accepted for use with the SI".&lt;ref name="SI" /&gt;  The definition also noted that "The dalton is often combined with SI prefixes …"
* In 2009, when the International Organization for Standardization published updated versions of ISO 80000, it gave mixed messages as to whether or not the unified atomic mass unit had been deprecated: ISO 80000-1:2009 (General), identified the dalton as having "earlier [been] called the unified atomic mass unit u",&lt;ref name = ISO1&gt;{{citation
 | title = International Standard ISO 80000-1:2009 – Quantities and Units – Part 1: General
 | publisher = International Organization for Standardization
 | year = 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt; but ISO 80000-10:2009 (atomic and nuclear physics) catalogued both as being alternatives for each other.&lt;ref name = ISO10&gt;
{{citation
 | title = International Standard ISO 80000-10:2009 – Quantities and units – Part 10: Atomic and nuclear physics
 | publisher = International Organization for Standardization
 | year = 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 2010 version of the Oxford University Press style guide for authors in life sciences gave the following guidance: "Use the Système international d'unités (SI) wherever possible … The dalton (Da) or more conveniently the kDa is a permitted non-SI unit for molecular mass or mass of a particular band in a separating gel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | title = Instructions to Authors
 | work = AoB Plants
 | publisher = Oxford journals; Oxford University Press
 | accessdate = 2010-08-22
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, the author guidelines for the journal "Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry" stated "The dalton (Da) is a unit of mass normally used for the molecular weight … use of the Da in place of the u has become commonplace in the mass spectrometry literature … The 'atomic mass unit', abbreviated 'amu', is an archaic unit".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

}}{{full citation needed|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2012, in response to the proposed [[new SI definitions|redefinition of the kilogram]], it was proposed that the dalton be redefined as being 0.001/N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg, thereby breaking the link with &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C.  This would result in the dalton and the atomic mass unit having slightly different definitions, but the suggestion is that the older unit should be superseded by the "new" dalton.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to SI ==
The former definition of the [[mole (unit)|mole]], an [[SI base unit]], was accepted by the [[CGPM]] in 1971 as:
# The mole is the amount of substance of a system which contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in 0.012&amp;nbsp;kilogram of carbon-12; its symbol is "mol".
# When the mole is used, the elementary entities must be specified and may be atoms, molecules, ions, electrons, other particles, or specified groups of such particles.
However, the first part of this definition was changed in 2018 to:
{{block indent|1=The mole, symbol mol, is the SI unit of amount of substance. One mole contains exactly {{val|6.02214076|e=23}} elementary entities. This number is the fixed numerical value of the [[Avogadro constant]], {{math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;}}, when expressed in the unit mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and is called the Avogadro number.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/CIPM/CIPM2017-EN.pdf?page=23 CIPM Report of 106th Meeting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127202612/https://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/CIPM/CIPM2017-EN.pdf?page=23 |date=27 January 2018 }} Retrieved 7 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

 |website=NIST
 |publisher=NIST
 |accessdate=24 October 2018
 |date=23 October 2018
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
One consequence of this change is that the current defined relationship between the mass of the &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C atom, the dalton, the kilogram, and the Avogadro number will no longer be valid. One of the following must change:
* The mass of a &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C atom is exactly 12 dalton.
* The number of dalton in a gram is exactly the numerical value of the Avogadro number: (i.e., {{nowrap|1=g/Da = {{math|''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;}} ⋅ mol}}).
The wording of the ninth SI Brochure&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
 |title=Draft of the ninth SI Brochure
 |publisher=BIPM
 |url=https://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/si-revised-brochure/Draft-SI-Brochure-2018.pdf
 |date=5 February 2018|accessdate=12 November 2018
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;A footnote in Table 8 on non-SI units states: "The dalton (Da) and the unified atomic mass unit (u) are alternative names (and symbols) for the same unit, equal to 1/12 of the mass of a free carbon 12 atom, at rest and in its ground state."&lt;/ref&gt; implies that the first statement remains valid, which means that the second is no longer true. The [[molar mass constant]], while still with great accuracy remaining 1 g/mol, is no longer exactly equal to that.
Given that the unified atomic mass unit is one twelfth the mass of one atom of carbon-12, meaning the mass of such an atom is 12&amp;nbsp;u, it follows that there are only approximately ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; atoms of carbon-12 in 0.012&amp;nbsp;kg of carbon-12. This can be expressed mathematically as
{{block indent|1=''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; (12&amp;nbsp;u) ≈ 0.012&amp;nbsp;kg/mol, or}}
{{block indent|1=''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; u ≈ 0.001&amp;nbsp;kg/mol}}

==Usage==

[[Molecular mass]]es of [[protein]]s are often expressed in '''kilodaltons''' (kDa or kD). For example, a molecule of a protein with [[molar mass]] {{val|64000|u=g⋅mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} has a mass of 64&amp;nbsp;kDa.&lt;ref name="Stryer 2007 35" /&gt;

In research and commerce, the [[degree of polymerization]] of synthetic [[polymer]]s is conventionally expressed in daltons.

The [[US Supreme Court]] based a [[Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc.|major precedent]] of appellate law on a disputed case of counting daltons for a molecular distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Supreme Court Opinion in 'Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc.'|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-854_o7jp.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
* A [[hydrogen-1]] atom has a mass of {{val|1.0078250322|u=u}} ({{val|1.0078250322|u=Da}}).
* By definition, a [[carbon-12]] atom has a mass of {{val|12|u=u}} ({{val|12|u=Da}}).
* A molecule of [[Aspirin|acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin)]] has a mass of {{val|180.16|u=u}} ({{val|180.16|u=Da}}).
* [[Titin]], the largest known [[protein]], has an atomic mass of 3–3.7 megadaltons ({{val|3000000|u=Da}}).&lt;ref name="pmid14563922"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Opitz CA, [[Matthew Kulke|Kulke M]], Leake MC, Neagoe C, Hinssen H, Hajjar RJ, Linke WA | title = Damped elastic recoil of the titin spring in myofibrils of human myocardium | journal = Proc.

* A conventional value for [[standard atomic weight]] of [[carbon]] is {{val|12.011|u=u}} ({{val|12.011|u=Da}}). This is based on [[average]] of many samples from [[Earth]]'s crust, [[atmosphere]], and [[organic materials]]. See [[Isotopes of carbon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4281">'''Bike Arc LLC''', located in downtown [[Palo Alto, California]], is a Silicon Valley startup that designs secure [[bicycle parking rack]]s and systems. It was founded by Joseph Bellomo and Jeff Selzer in 2008. Jeff Selzer sits on the Board of Directors of the Silicon Valley Bicycle Coalition&lt;ref&gt;http://bikesiliconvalley.org/board/&lt;/ref&gt; and is the General Manager of Palo Alto Bicycles. Joseph Bellomo, a [[California]]-licensed [[architect]], is the founder and owner of [[Joseph Bellomo Architects]], Inc. in Palo Alto, which he founded in 1986. In addition to collaborating on Bike Arc, Mr. Bellomo and Mr. Selzer also worked together on the Palo Alto Bikestation at the [[Caltrain]] depot.

[[File:Umbrella Arc by Bike Arc in downtown Palo Alto, California..jpg|thumb|Umbrella Arc bicycle parking system/bike racks/bicycle storage by Bike Arc.]]

In 2009, the American Institute of Architects, California Council, gave Bike Arc the Honor Award for Small Projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 Honor Award for Small Projects|url=http://www.aiacc.org/2011/08/02/bike-arc/|publisher=AIACC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==

Mr. Bellomo and Mr. Selzer—both being bicycle enthusiasts—set out to design bicycle-parking systems that don't touch and potentially damage bicycles, a solution that prevents bicycles from contacting each other, which can cause wear-and-tear.

== Products ==

Bike Arc is [[patented]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/USD604207}}&lt;/ref&gt; in both the United States and in Europe (Office for Harmonization In the Internal Market), and the company offers multiple iterations of the same fundamental concept: a [[modular]] [[structure]] of [[steel]] arcs. The Bike Arc family includes the Rack Arc, the Half Arc, the Umbrella Arc, the Tube Arc, the Car Arc, the Bus Arc, the House Arc, and the Ad Arc.

All Bike Arc products are manufactured in the United States.

== Installations ==

The City of Palo Alto has purchased and installed multiple Bike Arc products, including numerous Rack Arcs, Half Arcs and Umbrella Arcs, and Bike Arcs are also in public spaces in Boston, Las Vegas, Redwood City, California, and Norfolk, Virginia. They have also been installed at the University of Buffalo and the University of Nebraska, as well as—among others—at Juniper Networks, Inc., Varian Medical Systems, Inc., and the Seattle Repertory Theater.

[[File:H2wikibondingmo.png|thumb|The MO diagram for dihydrogen]]

In the classic example of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; MO, the two separate H atoms have identical atomic orbitals. When creating the molecule dihydrogen, the individual valence orbitals, 1''s'', either: merge in phase to get bonding orbitals, where the [[electron density]] is in between the nuclei of the atoms; or, merge out of phase to get antibonding orbitals, where the electron density is everywhere around the atom except for the space between the nuclei of the two atoms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/55600610|title=Modern physical organic chemistry|last=1960-|first=Anslyn, Eric V.,|date=2006|publisher=University Science|others=Dougherty, Dennis A., 1952-|isbn=1891389319|location=Sausalito, CA|oclc=55600610}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonding orbitals lead to a more stable species than when the two hydrogens are monatomic.  [[Antibonding molecular orbital|Antibonding orbitals]] are less stable because, with very little to no electron density in the middle, the two nuclei (holding the same charge) repulse each other. Therefore, it would require more energy to hold the two atoms together through the antibonding orbital. Each electron in the [[Electron shell|valence]] 1''s'' shell of hydrogen come together to fill in the stabilizing bonding orbital. So, hydrogen prefers to exist as a diatomic, and not monatomic, molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lennard-Jones|first=J.

[[File:He2wikibondingmo.jpg|thumb|The MO diagram for helium]]

When looking at helium, the atom holds two electrons in each valence 1''s'' shell. When the two atomic orbitals come together, they first fill in the bonding orbital with two electrons, but unlike hydrogen, it has two electrons left, which must then go to the antibonding orbital. The instability of the antibonding orbital cancels out the stabilizing effect provided by the bonding orbital; therefore, dihelium's [[bond order]] is 0. This is why helium would prefer to be monatomic over diatomic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/775664094|title=Inorganic chemistry|last=Housecroft|first=Catherine E.|date=|publisher=Pearson|others=Sharpe, A.

=== Bonding MOs of pi bonds ===

[[Pi bond]]s are created by the “side-on” interactions of the orbitals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Once again, in molecular orbitals, bonding pi (π) electrons occur when the interaction of the two π atomic orbitals are in-phase. In this case, the [[electron density]] of the π orbitals need to be symmetric along the mirror plane in order to create the bonding interaction. Asymmetry along the mirror plane will lead to a node in that plane and is described in the antibonding orbital, π*.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:MObutadienebondingmo.jpg|thumb|The MO diagram for butadiene]]

An example of a MO of a simple [[Conjugated system|conjugated π system]] is butadiene. To create the MO for butadiene, the resulting π and π* orbitals of the previously described system will interact with each other. This mixing will result in the creation of 4 group orbitals (which can also be used to describe the π MO of any diene):&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; contains no vertical [[Node (physics)|nodes]], π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contains one and both are considered bonding orbitals; π&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; contains 2 vertical nodes, π&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; contains 3 and are both considered antibonding orbitals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Hybridization in MOs ===
[[File:MethaneMObondingmo.jpg|thumb|The MO diagram for methane]]

The spherical 3D shape of ''s'' orbitals have no directionality in space and ''p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' orbitals are all 90&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; with respect to each other.

The four electrons from the 1''s'' orbitals of the hydrogen atoms and the [[valence electron]]s from the carbon atom (2 in ''s'' and 2 in ''p'') occupy the bonding orbitals, σ and π, in CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. In this MO example, the bonding orbital of π is less than that of the antibonding orbital of σ, or σ*. The ''sp''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; notation was derived from the ''s'' orbital being filled in σ and three of the ''p'' orbitals being filled in the π.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10554">A '''condenser''' is an optical [[Lens (optics)|lens]] which renders a [[beam divergence|divergent]] beam from a point source into a parallel or converging beam to illuminate an object. 

Condensers are an essential part of any imaging device, such as [[microscopes]], [[enlarger]]s, slide projectors, and telescopes. The concept is applicable to all kinds of radiation undergoing optical transformation, such as electrons in [[electron microscopy]], neutron radiation and synchrotron radiation optics.

==Microscope condenser==
[[File:Kondenzor.jpg|thumb|A condenser (right) and its respective [[diaphragm (optics)|diaphragm]] (left)]]
[[File:Kondenzor01.jpg|thumb|A condenser between the stage and mirror of a vintage microscope]]
Condensers are located above the light source and under the sample in an upright microscope, and above the stage and below the light source in an [[inverted microscope]]. They act to gather light from the microscope's light source and concentrate it into a cone of light that illuminates the specimen. The aperture and angle of the light cone must be adjusted (via the size of the diaphragm) for each different objective lens with different numerical apertures.

Condensers typically consist of a variable-aperture diaphragm and one or more lenses. Light from the illumination source of the microscope passes through the diaphragm and is focused by the lens(es) onto the specimen. After passing through the specimen the light diverges into an inverted cone to fill the front lens of the objective.

The first simple condensers were introduced on pre-[[Achromatic lens|achromatic]] microscopes in the 17th century. [[Robert Hooke]] used a combination of a salt water filled globe and a plano-convex lens, and shows in the '[[Micrographia]]' that he understands the reasons for its efficiency. Makers in the 18th century such as Benjamin Martin, Adams and Jones understood the advantage of condensing the area of the light source to that of the area of the object on the stage. This was a simple plano-convex or bi-convex lens, or sometimes a combination of lenses. With the development of the modern achromatic objective in 1829, by [[Joseph Jackson Lister]], the need for better condensers became increasingly apparent. By 1837, the use of the achromatic condenser was introduced in France, by Felix Dujardin, and Chevalier. English makers early took up this improvement, due to the obsession with resolving test objects such as diatoms and Nobert ruled gratings. By the late 1840s, English makers such as Ross, Powell and Smith; all could supply highly corrected condensers on their best stands, with proper centring and focus. It is erroneously stated that these developments were purely empirical - no-one can design a good achromatic, spherically corrected condenser relying only on empirics. 
On the Continent, in Germany, the corrected condenser was not considered either useful or essential, mainly due to a misunderstanding of the basic optical principles involved. Thus the leading German company, [[Carl Zeiss]] in Jena, offered nothing more than a very poor chromatic condenser into the late 1870s. French makers, such as Nachet, provided excellent achromatic condensers on their stands. When the leading German bacteriologist, [[Robert Koch]], complained to [[Ernst Abbe]], that he was forced to buy a Seibert achromatic condenser for his Zeiss microscope, in order to make satisfactory photographs of bacteria, Abbe produced a very good achromatic design in 1878.

There are three types of condenser:
# The chromatic condenser, such as the Abbe where no attempt is made to correct for spherical or [[chromatic aberration]]. It contains two lenses that produce an image of the light source that is surrounded by a blue and red color at its edges.
# The aplanatic condenser is corrected for spherical aberration.
# The compound achromatic condenser is corrected for both spherical and chromatic aberrations.

===Abbe condenser===
[[File:Condenser_diagram.svg|thumb|The sub-stage condenser focuses light through the specimen to match the aperture of the objective lens system.]]

The Abbe condenser is named for its inventor [[Ernst Abbe]], who developed it in 1870. The Abbe condenser, which was originally designed for Zeiss, is mounted below the stage of the microscope. The condenser concentrates and controls the light that passes through the specimen prior to entering the objective. It has two controls, one which moves the Abbe condenser closer to or further from the stage, and another, the [[iris diaphragm]], which controls the diameter of the beam of light. The controls can be used to optimize brightness, evenness of illumination, and contrast. Abbe condensers are difficult to use for magnifications of above 400X, as the aplanatic cone is only representative of a [[#Condensers and numerical aperture|numerical aperture (NA)]] of 0.6.

This condenser is composed of two lenses, a plano-convex lens somewhat larger than a hemisphere and a large bi-convex lens serving as a collecting lens to the first. The focus of the first lens is traditionally about 2mm away from the plane face coinciding with the sample plane. A pinhole cap can be used to align the optical axis of the condenser with that of the microscope. The Abbe condenser is still the basis for most modern light microscope condenser designs, even though its optical performance is poor.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Microscopical Society,"Journal of the Royal Microscopical Society", Williams and Norgate, London (1882), p.411-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chamot, E.M., "Elementary chemical microscopy", John Wiley and Sons, London (1916), p.36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Evolution of the Microscope". Bradbury. S, Pergamon Press, (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aplanatic and achromatic condensers===
An [[aplanatic]] condenser corrects for [[spherical aberration]] in the concentrated light path, while an achromatic compound condenser corrects for both spherical and [[chromatic aberration]].

===Specialized condensers===
[[Dark field]] and [[phase contrast]] setups are based on an Abbe, aplanatic, or achromatic condenser, but to the light path add a dark field stop or various size phase rings. These additional elements are housed in various ways. In most modern microscope (ca. 1990s–), such elements are housed in sliders that fit into a slot between the illuminator and the condenser lens. Many older microscopes house these elements in a turret-type condenser, these elements are housed in a turret below the condenser lens and rotated into place.

Specialised condensers are also used as part of [[Differential interference contrast microscopy|Differential Interference Contrast]] and [[Hoffman Modulation Contrast]] systems, which aim to improve contrast and visibility of transparent specimens.

In [[epifluorescence microscopy]], the [[objective lens]] acts not only as a magnifier for the light emitted by the [[fluorescing]] object, but also as a condenser for the [[incident light]].

The Arlow-Abbe condenser is a modified Abbe condenser that replaces the iris diaphragm, filter holder, lamp and lamp optics with a small OLED or LCD digital display unit. The display unit allows for digitally synthesised filters for dark-field, Rheinberg, oblique and dynamic (constantly changing) illumination under direct computer control. The device was first described by Dr. Jim Arlow in Microbe Hunter magazine, issue 38.

===Condensers and numerical aperture===
Like objective lenses, condensers vary in their [[numerical aperture]] (NA). It is NA that determines [[angular resolution|optical resolution]], in combination with the NA of the objective. Different condensers vary in their maximum and minimum numerical aperture, and the numerical aperture of a single condenser varies depending on the diameter setting of the condenser [[aperture]]. In order for the maximum numerical aperture (and therefore resolution) of an objective lens to be realized, the numerical aperture of the condenser must be matched to the numerical aperture of the used objective. The technique most commonly used in microscopy to optimize the light pathway between the condenser (and other illumination components of the microscope) and the objective lens is known as [[Köhler illumination]].

The maximum NA is limited by the refractive index of the medium between the lens and the sample. As with objective lenses, a condenser lens with a maximum numerical aperture of greater than 0.95 is designed to be used under [[oil immersion]] (or, more rarely, under [[water immersion]]), with a layer of immersion oil placed in contact with both the slide/coverslip and the lens of the condenser. An oil immersion condenser may typically have NA of up to 1.25. Without this oil layer, not only is maximum numerical aperture not realized, but the condenser may not be able to precisely focus light on the object. Condensers with a numerical aperture of 0.95 or less are designed to be used without oil or other fluid on the top lens and are termed dry condensers. Dual dry/immersion condensers are basically oil immersion condensers that can nonetheless focus light with the same degree of precision even without oil between the top lens and the slide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3027">'''Elso Sterrenberg Barghoorn''' (June 15, 1915 – January 22, 1984) was an [[United States|American]] [[paleobotanist]], called by his student [[Andrew Knoll]], the present Fisher Professor of Natural History at Harvard, "the father of [[Pre-Cambrian]] [[palaeontology]]."&lt;ref&gt;Knoll (2003), p. .&lt;/ref&gt;

Barghoorn is best known for discovering in [[South Africa]]n rocks [[fossil]] evidence of life that is at least 3.4 billion years old. These fossils show that life was present on Earth comparatively soon after the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] (about 3.8 billion years ago).

Barghoorn was born in [[New York City]].  After graduating from [[Miami University]] with a BSc and an MSc in biology, Barghoorn obtained his Ph.D. in paleobotany from the [[Harvard University]],  faculty of Biological Sciences, in 1941. After teaching for five years at [[Amherst College]], he joined the Harvard faculty, becoming Fisher Professor of Natural History and Curator of the University's plant fossils collections. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1950.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972 Barghoorn was awarded the [[Charles Doolittle Walcott Medal]] from the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name=Walcott&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Doolittle Walcott Medal |url=http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_walcott |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |accessdate=14 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513235831/http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_walcott |archivedate=13 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barghoorn married Margaret Alden MaCleod in 1941, Teresa Joan LaCroix, and Dorothy Dellmer Osgood in 1964. The first two marriages ended in divorce.

Gene delivery is a necessary step in [[gene therapy]] for the introduction or silencing of a gene to promote a therapeutic outcome in patients and also has applications in the genetic modification of crops. There are many different methods of gene delivery for various types of cells and tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nayerossadat N, Maedeh T, Ali PA | title = Viral and nonviral delivery systems for gene delivery | journal = Advanced Biomedical Research | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 27 | date = 2012 | pmid = 23210086 | pmc = 3507026 | doi = 10.4103/2277-9175.98152 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Viral based vectors emerged in the 1980s as a tool for transgene expression. In 1983, Siegel described the use of viral vectors in plant transgene expression although viral manipulation via cDNA cloning was not yet available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yusibov V, Shivprasad S, Turpen TH, Dawson W, Koprowski H | title = Plant viral vectors based on tobamoviruses | journal = Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology | volume = 240 | pages = 81–94 | date = 1999 | pmid = 10394716 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first virus to be used as a vaccine vector was the [[vaccinia]] virus in 1984 as a way to protect chimpanzees against [[hepatitis B]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moss B, Smith GL, Gerin JL, Purcell RH | title = Live recombinant vaccinia virus protects chimpanzees against hepatitis B | journal = Nature | volume = 311 | issue = 5981 | pages = 67–9 | date = September 1984 | pmid = 6472464 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-viral gene delivery was first reported on in 1943 by Avery et al. who showed cellular phenotype change via [[exogenous DNA]] exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-47150-0_2|title=Die Entdeckung der Doppelhelix|last=Avery|first=Oswald T.|last2=MacLeod|first2=Colin M.|last3=McCarty|first3=Maclyn | name-list-format = vanc |date=2017|publisher=Springer Spektrum, Berlin, Heidelberg|isbn=9783662471494|series=Klassische Texte der Wissenschaft|pages=97–120|language=de|doi=10.1007/978-3-662-47150-0_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
[[File:Bacterial_Transformation.svg|thumb|Bacterial transformation involves moving a gene from one bacteria to another. It is integrated into the recipients plasmid. and can then be expressed by the new host.]]
There are a variety of methods available to deliver genes to host cells. When genes are delivered to bacteria or plants the process is called [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] and when it is used to deliver genes to animals it is called [[transfection]]. This is because transformation has a [[Malignant transformation|different meaning]] in relation to animals, indicating progression to a cancerous state.&lt;ref name="Alberts"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21052/|title=Molecular Biology of the Cell|last1=Alberts|first1=Bruce|last2=Johnson|first2=Alexander|last3=Lewis|first3=Julian|last4=Raff|first4=Martin|last5=Roberts|first5=Keith|last6=Walter|first6=Peter|publisher=Garland Science|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8153-4072-0|location=New York|page=G:35|name-list-format=vanc|author-link1=Bruce Alberts}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some bacteria no external methods are need to introduce genes as they are naturally able to [[Competence (biology)|take up foreign DNA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Chen I, Dubnau D|date=March 2004|title=DNA uptake during bacterial transformation|journal=Nature Reviews. Microbiology|volume=2|issue=3|pages=241–9|doi=10.1038/nrmicro844|pmid=15083159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most cells require some sort of intervention to make the cell membrane permeable to DNA and allow the DNA to be stably inserted into the hosts [[genome]].

=== Chemical ===
Chemical based methods of gene delivery can uses natural or synthetic compounds to form particles that facilitate the transfer of genes into cells.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kamimura K, Suda T, Zhang G, Liu D|date=October 2011|title=Advances in Gene Delivery Systems|journal=Pharmaceutical Medicine|volume=25|issue=5|pages=293–306|doi=10.2165/11594020-000000000-00000|pmc=3245684|pmid=22200988}}&lt;/ref&gt; These synthetic vectors have the ability to electrostatically bind DNA or RNA and compact the genetic information to accommodate larger genetic transfers.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Pack DW, Hoffman AS, Pun S, Stayton PS|date=July 2005|title=Design and development of polymers for gene delivery|journal=Nature Reviews. Drug Discovery|language=En|volume=4|issue=7|pages=581–93|doi=10.1038/nrd1775|pmid=16052241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical vectors usually enter cells by [[endocytosis]] and can protect genetic material from degradation.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Nayerossadat N, Maedeh T, Ali PA|date=6 July 2012|title=Viral and nonviral delivery systems for gene delivery|journal=Advanced Biomedical Research|volume=1|pages=27|doi=10.4103/2277-9175.98152|pmc=3507026|pmid=23210086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Heat shock ====
One of the simplest method involves altering the environment of the cell and then stressing it by giving it a [[heat shock]]. Typically the cells are incubated in a solution containing [[divalent]] [[Cation|cations]] (often [[calcium chloride]]) under cold conditions, before being exposed to a heat pulse. Calcium chloride partially disrupts the cell membrane, which allows the recombinant DNA to enter the host cell. It is suggested that exposing the cells to divalent cations in cold condition may change or weaken the cell surface structure, making it more permeable to DNA. The heat-pulse is thought to create a thermal imbalance across the cell membrane, which forces the DNA to enter the cells through either cell pores or the damaged cell wall.

==== Calcium phosphate ====
Another simple methods involves using [[calcium phosphate]]  to bind the DNA and then exposing it to cultured cells. The solution, along with the DNA, is [[Cell encapsulation|encaspulated]] by the cells and a small amount of DNA can be integrated into the genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.slideshare.net/sarahairasantos/lecture-8-genetic-engineering-of-animal-cells|title=Lecture 8   genetic engineering of animal cells|website=www.slideshare.net|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Liposomes and polymers ====
[[Liposome|Liposomes]] and [[Polymer|polymers]] can be used as vectors to deliver DNA into cells. Positively charged liposomes bind with the negatively charged DNA, while polymers can be designed that interact with DNA.&lt;ref name=":222"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kamimura K, Suda T, Zhang G, Liu D|date=October 2011|title=Advances in Gene Delivery Systems|journal=Pharmaceutical Medicine|volume=25|issue=5|pages=293–306|doi=10.2165/11594020-000000000-00000|pmc=3245684|pmid=22200988}}&lt;/ref&gt; They form lipoplexes and polyplexes respectively, which are then up-taken by the cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://biocyclopedia.com/index/genetics/genetic_engineering_and_biotechnology_gene_transfer_methods_and_transgenic_organisms/gene_transfer_transfection_methods_in_animals.php|title=Gene transfer (transfection) methods in animals {{!}} Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology  Gene Transfer Methods and Transgenic Organisms {{!}} Genetics, Biotechnology, Molecular Biology, Botany {{!}} Biocyclopedia.com|last=Biocyclopedia.com|website=biocyclopedia.com|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The two systems can also be combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nayerossadat N, Maedeh T, Ali PA | title = Viral and nonviral delivery systems for gene delivery | journal = Advanced Biomedical Research | volume = 1 | pages = 27 | date = 2012-07-06 | pmid = 23210086 | pmc = 3507026 | doi = 10.4103/2277-9175.98152 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Polymer-based non-viral vectors uses polymers to interact with DNA and form polyplexes.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

==== Nanoparticles ====
The use of engineered inorganic and organic [[Nanoparticle|nanoparticles]] is another non-viral approach for gene delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yin |first1=Feng |last2=Gu |first2=Bobo |last3=Lin |first3=Yining |last4=Panwar |first4=Nishtha |last5=Tjin |first5=Swee Chuan |last6=Qu |first6=Junle |last7=Lau |first7=Shu Ping |last8=Yong |first8=Ken-Tye |title=Functionalized 2D nanomaterials for gene delivery applications |journal=Coordination Chemistry Reviews |date=15 September 2017 |volume=347 |page=77 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010854517301583}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Singh BN, Prateeksha, Gupta VK, Chen J, Atanasov AG. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28818304 Organic Nanoparticle-Based Combinatory Approaches for Gene Therapy.] Trends Biotechnol. 2017 Dec;35(12):1121–1124. [https://www.cell.com/trends/biotechnology/fulltext/S0167-7799(17)30190-7 doi: 10.1016/j.tibtech.2017.07.010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical ===
Artificial gene delivery can be mediated by physical methods which uses force to introduce genetic material through the cell membrane.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

==== Electroporation ====
[[File:Gemini_X2_generator.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gemini_X2_generator.jpg|thumb|Electroporators can be used to make the cell membrane permeable to DNA|alt=]][[Electroporation]] is a method of promoting [[Competence (biology)|competence]].  Cells are briefly shocked with an [[electric field]] of 10-20 [[Volt|kV]]/cm, which is thought to create holes in the cell membrane through which the plasmid DNA may enter.  After the electric shock, the holes are rapidly closed by the cell's membrane-repair mechanisms.

==== Biolistics ====
[[File:Genegun.jpg|alt=|thumb|A gene gun uses [[biolistics]] to insert DNA into cells]]
Another method used to transform plant cells is [[biolistics]], where particles of gold or tungsten are coated with DNA and then shot into young plant cells or plant embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Genetically Modified Plants: Assessing Safety and Managing Risk|last=Head|first=Graham|last2=Hull|first2=Roger H|last3=Tzotzos|first3=George T. | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Academic Pr|year=2009|isbn=0-12-374106-8|location=London|page=244 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some genetic material enters the cells and transforms them. This method can be used on plants that are not susceptible to ''Agrobacterium'' infection and also allows transformation of plant [[plastids]]. Plants cells can also be transformed using electroporation, which uses an electric shock to make the cell membrane permeable to plasmid DNA. Due to the damage caused to the cells and DNA the transformation efficiency of biolistics and electroporation is lower than agrobacterial transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Darbani|first1=Behrooz|last2=Farajnia|first2=Safar|last3=Toorchi|first3=Mahmoud|last4=Zakerbostanabad|first4=Saeed|last5=Noeparvar|first5=Shahin|last6=Neal Stewart|first6=C.| name-list-format = vanc |date=March 2008|title=DNA-Delivery Methods to Produce Transgenic Plants|journal=Biotechnology (Faisalabad)|volume=7|issue=3|pages=385–402|doi=10.3923/biotech.2008.385.402 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Microinjection ====
[[Microinjection]] is where DNA is injected through the cell's [[nuclear envelope]] directly into the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Chen I, Dubnau D|date=March 2004|title=DNA uptake during bacterial transformation|journal=Nature Reviews. Microbiology|volume=2|issue=3|pages=241–9|doi=10.1038/nrmicro844|pmid=15083159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sonoporation ====
[[Sonoporation]] uses sound waves create pores in a cell membrane to allow entry of genetic material

==== Photoporation ====
[[Optical transfection|Photoporation]] is when laser pulses are used to create pores in a cell membrane to allow entry of genetic material

==== Magnetofection ====
[[Magnetofection]] uses magnetic particles complexed with DNA and an external magnetic field concentrate nucleic acid particles into target cells.

==== Hydroporation ====
A hydrodynamic capillary effect can be used to manipulate cell permeability

=== Agrobacterium ===
[[File:Agrobacterium-tumefaciens.png|thumb|''[[A. tumefaciens]]'' attaching itself to a carrot cell]]
In plants the DNA is often inserted using [[Agrobacterium#Uses in biotechnology|''Agrobacterium''-mediated recombination]],&lt;ref name="NRC_2004"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK215771/|title=Methods and Mechanisms for Genetic Manipulation of Plants, Animals, and Microorganisms|author=National Research Council (US) Committee on Identifying and Assessing Unintended Effects of Genetically Engineered Foods on Human Health|date=2004-01-01|publisher=National Academies Press (US)}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking advantage of the ''Agrobacterium''s [[Transfer DNA|T-DNA]] sequence that allows natural insertion of genetic material into plant cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gelvin SB|date=March 2003|title=Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation: the biology behind the "gene-jockeying" tool|journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews|volume=67|issue=1|pages=16–37, table of contents|doi=10.1128/MMBR.67.1.16-37.2003|pmc=150518|pmid=12626681}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plant tissue are cut into small pieces and soaked in a fluid containing suspended ''Agrobacterium''. The bacteria will attach to many of the plant cells exposed by the cuts. The bacteria uses [[Bacterial conjugation|conjugation]] to transfer a DNA segment called [[T-DNA]] from its plasmid into the plant. The transferred DNA is piloted to the plant cell nucleus and integrated into the host plants genomic DNA.The plasmid T-DNA is integrated semi-randomly into the [[genome]] of the host cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Francis KE, Spiker S|date=February 2005|title=Identification of Arabidopsis thaliana transformants without selection reveals a high occurrence of silenced T-DNA integrations|journal=The Plant Journal|volume=41|issue=3|pages=464–77|doi=10.1111/j.1365-313x.2004.02312.x|pmid=15659104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By modifying the plasmid to express the gene of interest, researchers can insert their chosen gene stably into the plants genome. The only essential parts of the T-DNA are its two small (25 base pair) border repeats, at least one of which is needed for plant transformation.&lt;ref name="Montagu1977"&gt;{{cite book|title=Genetic Engineering for Nitrogen Fixation|vauthors=Schell J, Van Montagu M|year=1977|isbn=978-1-4684-0882-9|veditors=Hollaender A, Burris RH, Day PR, Hardy RW, Helinski DR, Lamborg MR, Owens L, Valentine RC|series=Basic Life Sciences|volume=9|pages=159–79|chapter=The Ti-Plasmid of Agrobacterium Tumefaciens, A Natural Vector for the Introduction of NIF Genes in Plants?|doi=10.1007/978-1-4684-0880-5_12|pmid=336023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joos1983"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Joos H, Timmerman B, Montagu MV, Schell J|year=1983|title=Genetic analysis of transfer and stabilization of Agrobacterium DNA in plant cells|journal=The EMBO Journal|volume=2|issue=12|pages=2151–60|pmc=555427|pmid=16453483}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genes to be introduced into the plant are cloned into a [[plant transformation vector]] that contains the T-DNA region of the [[plasmid]].

=== Viral delivery ===
[[File:Gene_therapy.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gene_therapy.jpg|thumb|Foreign DNA being transduced into the host cell through an adenovirus vector.]][[Virus]] mediated gene delivery utilizes the ability of a virus to inject its DNA inside a host cell and takes advantage of the virus' own ability to replicate and implement their own genetic material. Viral methods of gene delivery are more likely to induce an immune response, but they have high efficiency.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; [[Transduction (genetics)|Transduction]] is the process that describes virus-mediated insertion of DNA into the host cell. Viruses are a particularly effective form of gene delivery because the structure of the virus prevents degradation via [[Lysosome|lysosomes]] of the DNA it is delivering to the nucleus of the host cell.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wivel NA, Wilson JM | title = Methods of gene delivery | journal = Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 483–501 | date = June 1998 | pmid = 9684094 | doi = 10.1016/s0889-8588(05)70004-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In gene therapy a gene that is intended for delivery is packaged into a replication-deficient viral particle to form a [[viral vector]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21523/|title=Molecular Cell Biology | vauthors = Lodish H, Berk A, Zipursky SL | publisher=W.

However, there are drawbacks to using viruses to deliver genes into cells. Viruses can only deliver very small pieces of DNA into the cells, it is labor-intensive and there are risks of random insertion sites, [[Cytopathic effect|cytophathic effects]] and mutagenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keles E, Song Y, Du D, Dong WJ, Lin Y | title = Recent progress in nanomaterials for gene delivery applications | journal = Biomaterials Science | volume = 4 | issue = 9 | pages = 1291–309 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27480033 | doi = 10.1039/C6BM00441E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Viral vector based gene delivery uses a [[viral vector]] to deliver genetic material to the host cell. This is done by using a virus that contains the desired gene and removing the part of the viruses genome that is infectious.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kamimura K, Suda T, Zhang G, Liu D | title = Advances in Gene Delivery Systems | journal = Pharmaceutical Medicine | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 293–306 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 22200988 | doi = 10.2165/11594020-000000000-00000 | pmc = 3245684 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Viruses are efficient at delivering genetic material to the host cell's nucleus, which is vital for replication.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==== RNA-based viral vectors ====
RNA-based viruses were developed because of the ability to transcribe directly from infectious RNA transcripts.  RNA vectors are quickly expressed and expressed in the targeted form since no processing is required. Gene integration leads to long-term transgene expression but RNA-based delivery is usually transient and not permanent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some retroviral vectors include: Oncoretroviral vectors, [[Lentiviral vector in gene therapy]], [[Human foamy virus]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== DNA-based viral vectors ====
DNA-based viral vectors are usually longer lasting with the possibility of integrating into the genome. Some DNA-based viral vectors include: [[Adenoviridae]], [[Adeno-associated virus]], [[Herpes simplex virus]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Applications ==
===Gene therapy===
{{main|Gene therapy}}Several of the methods used to facilitate gene delivery have applications for therapeutic purposes. [[Gene therapy]] utilizes gene delivery to deliver genetic material with the goal of treating a disease or condition in the cell. Gene delivery in therapeutic settings utilizes non-[[Immunogenicity|immunogenic]] vectors capable of cell specificity that can deliver an adequate amount of transgene expression to cause the desired effect.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mali S | title = Delivery systems for gene therapy | journal = Indian Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–8 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23901186 | pmc = 3722627 | doi = 10.4103/0971-6866.112870 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in [[genomics]] have enabled a variety of new methods and gene targets to be identified for possible applications. [[DNA microarray|DNA microarrays]] used in a variety of [[next-gen sequencing]] can identify thousands of genes simultaneously, with analytical software looking at gene expression patterns, and orthologou[[Orthologs|s]] genes in [[Model organism|model species]] to identify function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Guyon I, Weston J, Barnhill S, Vapnik V |date=2002|title=Gene Selection for Cancer Classification using Support Vector Machines |journal=Machine Learning|volume=46|pages=389–422|doi=10.1023/A:1012487302797}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has allowed a variety of possible vectors to be identified for use in gene therapy. As a method for creating a new class of vaccine, gene delivery has been utilized to generate a [[Hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] biosynthetic vector to deliver a possible vaccine. This vector overcomes traditional barriers to gene delivery by combining ''E. coli'' with a [[synthetic polymer]] to create a vector that maintains plasmid DNA while having an increased ability to avoid degradation by target cell lysosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jones CH, Ravikrishnan A, Chen M, Reddinger R, Kamal Ahmadi M, Rane S, Hakansson AP, Pfeifer BA | title = Hybrid biosynthetic gene therapy vector development and dual engineering capacity | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 34 | pages = 12360–5 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 25114239 | pmc = 4151754 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1411355111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hiroshima''''' is a [[BBC]] [[docudrama]] that premiered as a [[television special]] on 5 August 2005, marking the eve of the 60th anniversary of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]].&lt;ref name="IMDb"/&gt; The program was aired on the [[Discovery Channel]] and [[BBC America]] in the United States. The documentary features [[historical reenactment]]s using firsthand eyewitness accounts and [[computer-generated imagery]] of the explosion. The film won an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] and three [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] awards in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards Database|url=http://www.bafta.org/awards-database.html?sq=Hiroshima|work=BAFTA|accessdate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

The documentary recounts the world's first nuclear attack and examines the repercussions. Covering a three-week period from the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity test]] to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, the program chronicles America's political gamble and the planning for the momentous event. Archival film, dramatizations, and special effects depict what occurred aboard the ''[[Enola Gay]]'' and inside the [[nuclear explosion|nuclear blast]].&lt;ref name="Netflix"/&gt;

==Eyewitness interviews==

Five Japanese survivors are interviewed: [[Kinuko Laskey]] (a nurse in a communications hospital), [[Morio Ozaki]] (an army cadet), [[Toruko Fujii]] (16-year-old tram driver), [[Thomas Takashi Tanemori]] (an eight-year-old schoolboy), Dr. [[Shuntaro Hida]] (a doctor at a military hospital), and [[Akiko Takakura]] (a 17-year-old city bank clerk).

From the United States the interviewees are [[Paul Tibbets]] (the commanding officer and pilot of the ''Enola Gay''), [[Theodore Van Kirk]] (the navigator of the aircraft), [[Morris R. Jeppson]] (the weapon test officer), and [[Russell Gackenbach]] (the navigator of the accompanying photographic aircraft ''[[Necessary Evil (aircraft)|Necessary Evil]]''). White House Map Room Duty Officer [[George Elsey]] is interviewed as an eyewitness to the [[Potsdam Conference]].

'''Human migration''' is the movement by people from one place to another with the intentions of settling, permanently or temporarily in a new location. The movement is often over long distances and from one country to another, but [[internal migration]] is also possible; indeed, this is the dominant form globally. People may migrate as individuals, in family units or in [[Mass migration|large groups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://migrationsmap.net/#/USA/arrivals |title=  Migrations country wise|accessdate=7 June 2014}}. One of the major migration rushes took place in the gold run in 19th century in California, Australia, and Africa.&lt;/ref&gt; A person who moves from their home to another place because of natural disaster or civil disturbance may be described as a [[refugee]] or, especially within the same country, a [[displaced person]]. A person seeking refuge from political, religious, or other forms of persecution is usually described as an [[asylum seeker]].

[[Nomad]]ic movements are normally not regarded as migrations as there is no intention to settle in the new place and because the movement is generally [[Seasonal human migration|seasonal]]. Only a few nomadic people have retained this form of lifestyle in modern times. Also, the temporary movement of people for the purpose of travel, tourism, pilgrimages, or the commute is not regarded as migration, in the absence of an intention to live and settle in the visited places.

[[File:Migrants in the world 1960-2015-en.png|thumb|upright=1.8|The number of migrants in the world 1960–2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{webbrefSV|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SM.POP.TOTL|titel=International migrant stock, total|verk=The World Bank Data|hämtdatum=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Many estimates of statistics in worldwide migration patterns exist.

The [[World Bank]] has published its ''Migration and Remittances Factbook'' annually since 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTLAC/Resources/Factbook2011-Ebook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Organisation for Migration]] (IOM) has published a yearly ''World Migration Report'' since 1999. The [[United Nations Statistics Division]] also keeps a database on worldwide migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://esa.un.org/unmigration/wallchart2013.htm | title=United Nations Population Division &amp;#124; Department of Economic and Social Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent advances in research on migration via the Internet promise better understanding of migration patterns and migration motives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oiarzabal | first1 = P. J. | last2 = Reips | first2 = U.-D. | year = 2012 | title = Migration and diaspora in the age of information and communication technologies | url = | journal = Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies | volume = 38 | issue = 9 | pages = 1333–1338 | doi = 10.1080/1369183X.2012.698202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reips, U.-D., &amp; Buffardi, L. (2012). Studying migrants with the help of the Internet: Methods from psychology, Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, 38(9), 1405–1424. doi:10.1080/1369183X.2012.698208 http://www.uni-konstanz.de/iscience/reips/pubs/papers/2012ReipsBuffardi_JEMS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Substantial internal migration can also take place within a country, either [[seasonal human migration]] (mainly related to agriculture and to tourism to urban places), or shifts of population into cities ([[urbanisation]]) or out of cities ([[suburbanisation]]). Studies of worldwide migration patterns, however, tend to limit their scope to [[international migration]].

The World Bank's ''Migration and Remittances Factbook'' of 2011 lists the following estimates for the year 2010: total number of immigrants: 215.8 million or 3.2% of world population.  In 2013, the percentage of international migrants worldwide increased by 33% with 59% of migrants targeting developed regions.&lt;ref name="UNFrPA"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.unfpa.org/resources/international-migration-2013-wall-chart|title= International Migration 2013 (wall chart) |year= 2013 |publisher= UNFPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Almost half of these migrants are women, which is one of the most significant migrant-pattern changes in the last half century.&lt;ref name="UNFrPA" /&gt; Women migrate alone or with their family members and community. Even though female migration is largely viewed as associations rather than independent migration, emerging studies argue complex and manifold reasons for this.&lt;ref&gt;Thapan, M. (2008). Series Introduction in Palriwala and Uberoi (Eds.), Women and Migration in Asia (p. 359). New Delhi: Sage Publications. {{ISBN|978-0-7619-3675-6}} (Pb)&lt;/ref&gt;

Often{{quantify|date=September 2015}} a distinction is made {{by whom|date=September 2015}} between voluntary and involuntary migration, or between [[refugee]]s fleeing political conflict or natural disaster vs. economic or [[labour migration|labor migration]], but these distinctions are difficult to make and partially subjective, as the motivators for migration are often correlated. The World Bank's report estimates that, as of 2010, 16.3 million or 7.6% of migrants qualified as refugees. At the end of 2012, approximately 15.4 million people were refugees and persons in refugee-like situations - 87% of them found asylum in developing countries.&lt;ref name="UNFrPA" /&gt;

Structurally, there is substantial South-South and North-North migration, i.e., most emigrants from high-income O.E.C.D. countries migrate to other high-income countries, and a substantial part (estimated at 43%) of emigrants from developing countries migrate to other developing countries. The [[United Nations Population Fund]] says that "[while the North has experienced a higher absolute increase in the migrant stock since 2000 (32 million) compared to the South (25 million), the South recorded a higher growth rate.&lt;ref name="UNFrPA" /&gt; Between 2000 and 2013 the average annual rate of change of the migrant population in the developing regions (2.3%) slightly exceeded that of the developed regions (2.1%).&lt;ref name="UNFrPA" /&gt;

The Global Commission on International Migration (GCIM), launched in 2003, published a report in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;The 90-page report, along with supporting evidence, is available on the GCIM website [http://www.gcim.org gcim.org]&lt;/ref&gt; International migration challenges at the global level are addressed through the [[Global Forum on Migration and Development]] and the [[Global Migration Group]], both established in 2006.

The United Nations reported that 2014 had the highest level of forced migration on record: 59.5 million individuals, caused by "persecution, conflict, generalized violence, or human rights violations", as compared with 51.2 million in 2013 (an increase of 8.3 million) and with 37.5 million a decade prior. {{As of | 2015}} one of every 122 humans is a refugee, internally displaced, or seeking asylum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = Worldwide displacement hits all-time high as war and persecution increase |url = http://www.unhcr.org/558193896.html |accessdate = 2015-09-21 |first = United Nations High Commissioner for |last = Refugees}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] has published 5 maps showing human migrations in progress in 2015 based on the UN report.&lt;ref&gt;

==Labor migration theories in the 21st century==

===Overview===

Numerous causes impel migrants to move to another country. For instance, [[globalization]] has increased the demand for workers in order to sustain national economies. Thus one category of [[economic migrant]]s - generally from impoverished developing countries - migrates to obtain sufficient income for survival.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.unfpa.org/migration | title=Migration}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=October 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Such migrants often send some of their income home to family members in the form of [[remittances|economic remittances]], which have become an economic staple in a number of developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Jason de Parle, "A Good Provider is One Who Leaves", ''New York Times'', April 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; People may also move or are forced to move as a result of conflict, of [[human rights violations | human-rights violations]], of violence, or to escape persecution. In 2013 it was estimated{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} that around 51.2 million people fell into this category.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt;{{qn|date=October 2018}} Other reasons people may move include to gain access to opportunities and services or to escape extreme weather. This type of movement, usually from rural to urban areas, may class as [[internal migration]].&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt;{{qn|date=October 2018}} Socio-cultural and geo-historical factors also play a major role. In North Africa, for example, emigrating Europe counts as a sign of social prestige. Moreover, many countries were former [[colony | colonies]]. This means that many have relatives who live legally in the (former) colonial [[metropole]], and who often provide important help for immigrants arriving in that metropole.&lt;ref&gt;
For example: [[Moroccans in France]], [[Filipino Americans | Filipinos in the United States of America]], [[Koreans in Japan]] or [[Samoans in New Zealand]].
&lt;/ref&gt;
Relatives may help with job research and with accommodation. The geographical proximity of Africa to Europe and the long historical ties between Northern and Southern Mediterranean countries also prompt many to migrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Fanack|title= The Key Drivers of North African Illegal Migration to Europe|url= https://chronicle.fanack.com/specials/international-affairs/north-african-illegal-migration-to-europe/|website= Fanack.com|accessdate= 14 July 2015|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150714172715/https://chronicle.fanack.com/specials/international-affairs/north-african-illegal-migration-to-europe/|archivedate= 14 July 2015|df= | quote = The proximity of North Africa to southern Europe, the liberal mobility policies of most European countries, and the historical links between northern and southern Mediterranean countries are all key factors encouraging people to migrate to Europe.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of theories attempt to explain the international flow of capital and people from one country to another.&lt;ref name="Jennissen, R 2007"&gt;
Jennissen, R. 2007. "Causality Chains in the International Migration Systems Approach." Population Research and Policy Review 26(4). 411 – 36.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoclassical economic theory===
{{main|Neoclassical economics}}This theory of migration states that the main reason for labor migration is wage difference between two geographic locations. These wage differences are usually linked to geographic labor demand and supply. It can be said that areas with a shortage of labor but an excess of capital have a high relative wage while areas with a high labor supply and a dearth of capital have a low relative wage. Labor tends to flow from low-wage areas to high-wage areas. Often, with this flow of labor comes changes in the sending as well as the receiving country. Neoclassical economic theory is best used to describe transnational migration, because it is not confined by international immigration laws and similar governmental regulations.&lt;ref name="Jennissen, R 2007" /&gt;

===Dual labor market theory===

Dual labor market theory states that migration is mainly caused by pull factors in more developed countries. This theory assumes that the labor markets in these developed countries consist of two segments: the primary market, which requires high-skilled labor, and the secondary market, which is very labor-intensive requiring low-skilled workers. This theory assumes that migration from less developed countries into more developed countries is a result of a pull created by a need for labor in the developed countries in their secondary market. [[Migrant worker]]s are needed to fill the lowest rung of the labor market because the native laborers do not want to do these jobs as they present a lack of mobility. This creates a need for migrant workers. Furthermore, the initial dearth in available labor pushes wages up, making migration even more enticing.&lt;ref name="Jennissen, R 2007"/&gt;

===New economics of labor migration===

This theory states that migration flows and patterns can't be explained solely at the level of individual workers and their economic incentives, but that wider social entities must be considered as well. One such social entity is the household. Migration can be viewed as a result of risk aversion on the part of a household that has insufficient income. The household, in this case, is in need of extra capital that can be achieved through remittances sent back by family members who participate in migrant labor abroad. These [[remittances]] can also have a broader effect on the economy of the sending country as a whole as they bring in capital.&lt;ref name="Jennissen, R 2007"/&gt; Recent research has examined a decline in U.S. interstate migration from 1991 to 2011, theorizing that the reduced interstate migration is due to a decline in the geographic specificity of occupations and an increase in workers’ ability to learn about other locations before moving there, through both information technology and inexpensive travel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp697.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, ''Understanding the Long-Run Decline in Interstate Migration'', April 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers find that the location-specific nature of housing is more important than moving costs in determining labour reallocation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2010/wp2010_18.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, ''The Role of Housing in Labour Reallocation'', November 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relative deprivation theory===
{{main|Relative deprivation}}
Relative deprivation theory states that awareness of the income difference between neighbors or other households in the migrant-sending community is an important factor in migration. The incentive to migrate is a lot higher in areas that have a high level of economic inequality. In the short run, remittances may increase inequality, but in the long run, they may actually decrease it. There are two stages of migration for a worker: first, they invest in human capital formation, and then they try to capitalize on their investments. In this way, successful migrants may use their new capital to provide for better schooling for their children and better homes for their families. Successful high-skilled emigrants may serve as an example for neighbors and potential migrants who hope to achieve that level of success.&lt;ref name="Jennissen, R 2007"/&gt;

===World systems theory===

[[World-systems theory]] looks at migration from a global perspective. It explains that interaction between different societies can be an important factor in social change within societies.  Trade with one country, which causes economic decline in another, may create incentive to migrate to a country with a more vibrant economy. It can be argued that even after decolonization, the economic dependence of former colonies still remains on mother countries. This view of [[international trade]] is controversial, however, and some argue that free trade can actually reduce migration between developing and developed countries. It can be argued that the developed countries import labor-intensive goods, which causes an increase in employment of unskilled workers in the less developed countries, decreasing the outflow of migrant workers. The export of capital-intensive goods from rich countries to poor countries also equalizes income and employment conditions, thus also slowing migration. In either direction, this theory can be used to explain migration between countries that are geographically far apart.&lt;ref name="Jennissen, R 2007"/&gt;

===Osmosis: the unifying theory of human migration===

Old migration theories are generally embedded in geography, sociology or economics. They explain migration in specific periods and spaces. In fact, Osmosis theory explains the whole phenomenon of human migration. Based on the [[history of human migration]], Djelti (2017a)&lt;ref&gt;Djelti S, "The Evolution of the Human Migration Determinants" draft paper présented in the international conference on “Crossing Boundaries: Youth, Migration, and Development”, At Alakhawayn university in Ifran, Morocco – March 2–4, 2017 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320427737_The_Evolution_of_the_Human_Migration_Determinants_1_Draft_paper&lt;/ref&gt; studies the evolution of its natural determinants. According to him, human migration is divided into two main types: the simple migration and the complicated one. The simple migration is divided, in its turn, into diffusion, stabilisation and concentration periods. During these periods, water availability, adequate climate, security and population density represent the natural determinants of human migration. For the complicated migration, it is characterised by the speedy evolution and the emergence of new sub-determinants notably earning, unemployment, networks and migration policies. Osmosis theory (Djelti, 2017b)&lt;ref&gt;Djelti S, "Osmosis: the Unifying Theory of Human Migration" Revue Algérienne d’Economie et du Management Vol. 08, N°: 02(2017) http://www.asjp.cerist.dz/raem{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320427688_Osmosis_the_unifying_theory_of_human_migration&lt;/ref&gt; explains analogically human migration by the biophysical phenomenon of [[osmosis]]. In this respect, the countries are represented by [[animal cells]], the borders by the [[semipermeable membranes]] and the humans by [[ions]] of water. As to osmosis phenomenon, according to the theory, humans migrate from countries with less migration pressure to countries with high migration pressure. In order to measure the latter, the natural determinants of human migration replace the variables of the [[second principle of thermodynamics]] used to measure the [[osmotic pressure]].

==Sociological and Political Science theories==

===Sociology===
{{main|Sociology of immigration}}A number of social scientists have examined immigration from a [[Sociology|sociological]] perspective, paying particular attention to how immigration affects, and is affected by, matters of [[Race (human categorization)|race]] and [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], as well as [[social structure]]. They have produced three main sociological perspectives: [[symbolic interactionism]], which aims to understand migration via face-to-face interactions on a micro-level; [[social conflict theory]] examines migration through the prism of competition for power and resources; [[structural functionalism]], based on the ideas of [[Émile Durkheim]], examines the role of migration in fulfilling certain functions within each society, such as the decrease of [[Anomie|despair and aimlessness]] and the consolidation of [[social network]]s.

More recently, as attention shifted away from countries of destination, sociologists have attempted to understand how [[transnationalism]] allows us to understand the interplay between migrants, their countries of destination, and their countries of origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sBJTOhDpauQC&amp;pg=PT5&amp;dq=schiller+basch#v=onepage&amp;q=schiller%20basch&amp;f=false|title=Nations Unbound: Transnational Projects, Postcolonial Predicaments, and Deterritorialized Nation-States|last=Basch|first=Linda|last2=Schiller|first2=Nina Glick|last3=Blanc|first3=Christina Szanton|date=2005-09-26|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135307035|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this framework, work on social remittances by [[Peggy Levitt]] and others has led to a stronger conceptualisation of how migrants affect socio-political processes in their countries of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levitt|first=Peggy|date=1998|title=Social Remittances: Migration Driven Local-Level Forms of Cultural Diffusion|jstor=2547666|journal=The International Migration Review|volume=32|issue=4|pages=926–948|doi=10.2307/2547666}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political Science===
Political scientists have put forth a number of theoretical frameworks on migration, offering different perspectives on processes of [[International security|security]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Faist|first=Thomas|date=2006|pages=103–119|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|language=en|doi=10.1057/9781403984678_6|isbn=9781349532650|title=Migration, Citizenship, Ethnos|chapter=The Migration-Security Nexus: International Migration and Security Before and After 9/11|hdl=2043/686}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adamson|first=Fiona B.|date=July 2006|title=Crossing Borders: International Migration and National Security|journal=International Security|language=en|volume=31|issue=1|pages=165–199|doi=10.1162/isec.2006.31.1.165|issn=0162-2889}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[citizenship]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-oxford-handbook-of-citizenship-9780198805854?cc=gb&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=The Oxford Handbook of Citizenship|date=2017-08-03|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198805854|editor-last=Shachar|editor-first=Ayelet|series=Oxford Handbooks in Law|location=Oxford, New York|editor-last2=Bauboeck|editor-first2=Rainer|editor-last3=Bloemraad|editor-first3=Irene|editor-last4=Vink|editor-first4=Maarten}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[international relations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wERHBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Oxford+handbook+citizenship+migration|title=Migration Theory: Talking across Disciplines|last=Brettell|first=Caroline B.|last2=Hollifield|first2=James F.|date=2014-08-25|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317805984|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political importance of [[diaspora]]s has also become a growing field of interest, as scholars examine questions of diaspora [[activism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bauböck|first=Rainer|date=2006-02-23|title=Towards a Political Theory of Migrant Transnationalism|journal=International Migration Review|volume=37|issue=3|pages=700–723|doi=10.1111/j.1747-7379.2003.tb00155.x|issn=0197-9183}}&lt;/ref&gt; state-diaspora relations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Délano|first=Alexandra|last2=Gamlen|first2=Alan|date=July 2014|title=Comparing and theorizing state–diaspora relations|journal=Political Geography|volume=41|pages=43–53|doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2014.05.005|issn=0962-6298|hdl=2440/102448}}&lt;/ref&gt; out-of-country [[voting]] processes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lafleur|first=Jean-Michel|date=2014|title=The enfranchisement of citizens abroad: variations and explanations|journal=Democratization|volume=22 |issue=5|pages=840–860|doi=10.1080/13510347.2014.979163|url=https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/181007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and states' [[soft power]] strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsourapas|first=Gerasimos|date=2018|title=Authoritarian emigration states: Soft power and cross-border mobility in the Middle East|journal=International Political Science Review|volume=39 |issue=3|pages=400–416|doi=10.1177/0192512118759902}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this field, the majority of work has focused on immigration politics, viewing migration from the perspective of the country of destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oec_BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=Oxford+handbook+citizenship+migration#v=onepage&amp;q=Oxford%20handbook%20citizenship%20migration&amp;f=false|title=Controlling Immigration: A Global Perspective, Third Edition|last=Hollifield|first=James|last2=Martin|first2=Philip L.|last3=Orrenius|first3=Pia|date=2014-07-30|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804787352|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to [[emigration]] processes, political scientists have expanded on [[Albert O. Hirschman|Albert Hirschman's]] framework on 'voice' vs. 'exit' to discuss how emigration affects the politics within the countries of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hirschman|first=Albert O.|date=January 1993|title=Exit, Voice, and the Fate of the German Democratic Republic: An Essay in Conceptual History|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/world-politics/article/exit-voice-and-the-fate-of-the-german-democratic-republic-an-essay-in-conceptual-history/F80371FDC6F34ED2A8BFA9D31C95992A|journal=World Politics|language=en|volume=45|issue=2|pages=173–202|doi=10.2307/2950657|issn=1086-3338|jstor=2950657}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brubacker|first=Rogers|date=1990|title=Frontier theses: Exit, voice, and loyalty in East Germany|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/soc/faculty/brubaker/Publications/27_frontier_theses.pdf|journal=Migration World|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical theories==

===Ravenstein===
Certain laws of [[social sciences|social science]] have been proposed to describe human migration. The following was a standard list after [[Ernst Georg Ravenstein|Ravenstein's]] (1834–1913) proposal in the 1880s. The laws are as follows:

# ''every migration flow generates a return or counter migration.''
# ''the majority of migrants move a short distance.
# ''migrants who move longer distances tend to choose big-city destinations.
# ''urban residents are often less migratory than inhabitants of rural areas.
# ''families are less likely to make international moves than young adults.
# ''most migrants are adults.
# ''large towns grow by migration rather than natural increase.
# ''migration stage by stage.
# ''urban rural difference.
# ''migration and technology.
# ''economic condition.

===Lee===
Lee's laws divide factors causing migrations into two groups of factors: push and pull factors. Push factors are things that are unfavourable about the area that one lives in, and pull factors are things that attract one to another area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor= 2060063|title= A Theory of Migration|author= Everett S. Lee|year= 1966|publisher= University of Pennsylvania|volume=3|pages=47–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time Turkey’s political, social and economic conditions have been improving, making returning home all the more appealing for Turks at large. (pp.&amp;nbsp;94–99)

===Climate cycles===
The modern field of climate history suggests that the successive waves of Eurasian nomadic movement throughout history have had their origins in [[Climate change|climatic cycles]], which have expanded or contracted pastureland in Central Asia, especially [[Mongolia]] and to its west the [[Altai mountains|Altai]]. People were displaced from their home ground by other tribes trying to find land that could be grazed by essential flocks, each group pushing the next further to the south and west, into the highlands of [[Anatolia]], the [[Pannonian Plain]], into [[Mesopotamia]], or southwards, into the rich pastures of China. Bogumil Terminski uses the term "migratory domino effect" to describe this process in the context of [[Sea People]] invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Terminski, Bogumil. ''Environmentally-Induced Displacement. Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges''. CEDEM, Université de Liège, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other models===
* ''Migration occurs because individuals search for food, sex and security outside their usual habitation.''&lt;ref&gt;Idyorough, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Idyorough is of the view that towns and cities are a creation of the human struggle to obtain food, sex and security. To produce food, security and reproduction, human beings must, out of necessity, move out of their usual habitation and enter into indispensable social relationships that are cooperative or antagonistic.  Human beings also develop the tools and equipment to enable them to interact with nature to produce the desired food and security. The improved relationship (cooperative relationships) among human beings and improved technology further conditioned by the push and pull factors all interact together to cause or bring about migration and higher concentration of individuals into towns and cities.  The higher the technology of production of food and security and the higher the cooperative relationship among human beings in the production of food and security and in the reproduction of the human species, the higher would be the push and pull factors in the migration and concentration of human beings in towns and cities.  Countryside, towns and cities do not just exist but they do so to meet the human basic needs of food, security and the reproduction of the human species.  Therefore, migration occurs because individuals search for food, sex and security outside their usual habitation. Social services in the towns and cities are provided to meet these basic needs for human survival and pleasure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1217">An '''inspirator''' is a device, similar to a [[Venturi effect|venturi tube]] and an [[orifice plate]], which mixes a fuel gas with atmospheric air in a precise ratio to regulate burn characteristics.  Only the pressure of the fuel gas is used to draw in and mix the air.  They are the most simple and common type of mixing device for gas stoves and furnaces.  Burners using an inspirator are considered to be naturally aspirated.

In an inspirator there are two tubes.  The first is a fuel gas pipe with an [[:wikt:orifice|orifice]] at the end where the gas comes out.  Then in front of this there is another section of tubing with a larger diameter that the gas blows into.  Usually (but not always) this second piece of tubing is tapered so that it starts getting narrower downstream from the orifice.  Then, at a certain point, it stops getting narrower and either straightens out or starts getting larger again.  This gives the fuel and air time to mix.  The fuel/air ratio is determined by the ratio of the diameter of the orifice to the diameter of the mixing tube.

The ''' International Centre for Black Sea Studies ''' (Greek: Διεθνές Κέντρο Μελετών Ευξείνου Πόντου, English Acronym: ICBSS, Greek Acronym: ΔΙΚΕΜΕΠ) is a think-tank based in Athens, Greece, committed to promoting multilateral cooperation between the countries of the Black Sea region and with their international partners.

== History and Identity ==

The ICBSS was established in 1998 as a private non-profit organisation under Greek law (art. 50 paragraph 2 of L. 2594/1998, Government Gazette 62-A’, as modified by Presidential Decrees No 137 &amp; 138, Government Gazette No.119, 1st issue, April 2000). The Centre is a de facto related body of the intergovernmental [[BSEC|Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC)]] and forms part of the so-called “BSEC family” of institutions.&lt;ref name="related bodies"&gt;[http://www.bsec-organization.org/Relatedbodies/Pages/icbss.aspx Related Bodies/Affiliated Centers of the BSEC]. Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation. Retrieved 18 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICBSS was created originally to contribute through policy-oriented research and advocacy work to the realisation of the goals of the BSEC and continues to act as the BSEC’s acknowledged think-tank.&lt;ref name="charter"&gt;[http://www.bsec-organization.org/documents/LegalDocuments/statutory/charter/Download/CHARTER%20web%20080630.pdf Charter of the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation], New Article 24. Retrieved 18 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the mandates received from the BSEC the Centre also carries out a range of projects and activities on its own initiative, aiming to foster multilateral cooperation in and with the wider Black Sea region. A special focus lies on relations with the [[European Union]].

== Objectives ==

Through its activities, the ICBSS aims to foster multilateral cooperation among the BSEC member states as well as with their international partners.&lt;ref name="ISN"&gt;[http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Communities-and-Partners/Partners/Detail/?lng=en&amp;id=102262 ISN Partners]. International Relations and Security Network. Retrieved 18 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an independent research and training centre the ICBSS strives “to pursue applied, policy-oriented research, build capacity and promote knowledge on the Black Sea region both within and outside its boundaries”.&lt;ref name="About us"&gt;[http://icbss.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=33  About the ICBSS - Who We Are]. International Centre for Black Sea Studies. Retrieved 19 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a related body of the BSEC its goal is "to fulfil in the best possible way its institutional role and the assignments received by carrying out studies, offering policy advice and coordinating activities”.&lt;ref name="About us" /&gt;

In 2008, undergoing a review of its image on the occasion of its 10th anniversary, the Centre coined the motto: “Promoting Synergies Across Regions”.

== Activities ==

To fulfil its mission the Centre carries out applied, policy-oriented research either independently or in its capacity as a related body of the BSEC. While it is not restricted in its thematic scope the ICBSS has so far focused on the following thematic areas:&lt;ref name="Brochure"&gt;[http://icbss.org/images/icbss%20brochure.pdf ICBSS Brochure]. Pages 5-6. Retrieved 19 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

*BSEC-[[European Union|EU]] interaction
*security/stability
*energy
*[[good governance]] and institutional renewal
*comparative studies in regional cooperation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3089">In [[aeroacoustics]], '''jet noise''' is the field that focuses on the noise generation caused by high-velocity [[Jet (fluid)|jets]] and the turbulent [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]] generated by shearing flow. Such noise is known as broadband noise and extends well beyond the range of human hearing (100&amp;nbsp;kHz and higher).  Jet noise is also responsible for some of the loudest sounds ever produced by mankind.

==Sources of jet noise==

The primary sources of jet noise for a high-speed air jet (meaning when the exhaust velocity exceeds about 100&amp;nbsp;m/s) are "jet mixing noise" and, for [[Supersonic speed|supersonic flow]], shock associated noise. Also, acoustic  sources within the "jet pipe" also contribute to the noise, mainly at lower speeds, which include combustion noise and sounds produced by interactions of a turbulent stream with fans, compressors, and turbine systems.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, 151&lt;/ref&gt;

The jet mixing sound is created by the turbulent mixing of a jet with the ambient fluid, in most cases, air.  The mixing initially occurs in an annular shear layer, which grows with the length of the nozzle.  The mixing region generally fills the entire jet at four or five diameters from the nozzle.  The high-frequency components of the sound are mainly stationed close to the nozzle, where the dimensions of the turbulence eddies are small.  Further down the jet, where the eddy size is similar to the jet diameter, is where lower frequency begins.

In Supersonic, or "choked" jets there are cells through which the flow continuously expands and contracts.  Several of these "shock cells" can be seen extending up to ten jet diameters from the nozzle and are responsible for two additional components of jet noise, "screech tones" and broadband "shock associated noises".  Screech is produced by a feedback mechanism in which a disturbance convecting in the shear layer generates sound as it traverses the standing system of shock waves in the jet.&lt;ref&gt;Howe, 153&lt;/ref&gt;  Even though screech is a side effect of the jet's flight, it can be suppressed by an appropriate design for a nozzle.

[[Aircraft noise]] is also sometimes called "jet noise" when emanating from [[jet aircraft]], regardless of the mechanism of noise production.

===Consent To Research===

[[Consent to Research]] (CtR) is a project that provides a platform for people to donate their health data for the purposes of scientific research and the advancement of medicine. Since health data is restricted and expensive, this project provides people the opportunity to freely donate information that can only positively benefit medicine and patients at large.&lt;ref name="Consent to Research - About Us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weconsent.us/about|title=Consent to Research - About Us|publisher=Consent to Research|accessdate=2012-07-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629212121/http://weconsent.us/about|archivedate=2012-06-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consent to Research is connected to the Access2Research project, which aims to free access over the Internet to scientific journal articles that are already taxpayer-funded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://access2research.org/about|title=Access2Research - About Us|publisher=Access2Research|accessdate=2013-02-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524034409/http://access2research.org/about|archive-date=2012-05-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilbanks founded the project in 2011 and gave a TED Global talk about the project in 2012.&lt;ref name="TED Blog - Unreasonable people unite: John Wilbanks at [[TED Global Conference|TED Global]] 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ted.com/2012/06/29/unreasonable-people-unite-john-wilbanks-at-tedglobal-2012/|title=TED Blog - Unreasonable people unite: John Wilbanks at TED Global 2012|publisher=TED|accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Julius Wilhelm Gintl''' was an Austrian physicist. He was notable as the developer of an early form of [[duplex (communications)|duplex]] [[electrical telegraph]], which allowed two messages to be transmitted on a single wire, in opposite directions. This "duplex" communication was an early specific case of the general practice of multiplexing.

Gintl's method would be developed to economic viability by [[J. B. Stearns]], and the refined method used in Edison's implementation of a [[quadruplex telegraph]].

'''Kalevi Kull''' (born 12 August 1952, [[Tartu]]) is a [[biosemiotics]] professor at the [[University of Tartu]], [[Estonia]].

He graduated from the [[University of Tartu]] in 1975. His earlier work dealt with ethology and field ecology. He has studied the mechanisms of species coexistence in species-rich communities and developed mathematical modelling in [[ecophysiology]]. Since 1975, he has been the main organiser of annual meetings of [[theoretical biology]] in Estonia. In 1992, he became a Professor of Ecophysiology in the University of Tartu. In 1997, he joined the Department of Semiotics, and became a Professor in Biosemiotics. From 2006 to 2018, he was the Head of the Department of Semiotics in the University of Tartu, Estonia. His field of interests include biosemiotics, [[ecosemiotics]], general semiotics, theoretical biology, [[theory of evolution]], history and philosophy of semiotics and life science.&lt;ref name="Favareau"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Favareau|first1=Donald|title=Essential Readings in Biosemiotics: Anthology and Commentary|date=2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781402096501|pages=417–444|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=2_tEPA6TcFIC&amp;q=%22Theoretical+Biology+on+Its+Way+to+Biosemiotics%22#v=snippet|url-access=limited|accessdate=30 March 2018|language=en|chapter=Chapter 13: Theoretical Biology on Its Way to Biosemiotics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the president of the [[Estonian Naturalists' Society]] in 1991–1994. He is the president of the [[International Society for Biosemiotic Studies]] since 2015.

A '''lagoon''' is a shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water by [[barrier island]]s or [[reef]]s. Lagoons are commonly divided into coastal lagoons and [[atoll]] lagoons.  They have also been identified as occurring on mixed-sand and gravel coastlines. There is an overlap between bodies of water classified as coastal lagoons and bodies of water classified as [[Estuary|estuaries]]. Lagoons are common coastal features around many parts of the world.

==Definition==
Lagoons are shallow, often elongated bodies of water separated from a larger body of water by a shallow or exposed [[shoal]], [[reef|coral reef]], or similar feature. Some authorities include [[fresh water]] bodies in the definition of "lagoon", while others explicitly restrict "lagoon" to bodies of water with some degree of [[salinity]]. The distinction between "lagoon" and "estuary" also varies between authorities. Richard A. Davis Jr. restricts "lagoon" to bodies of water with little or no fresh water inflow, and little or no [[Tide|tidal]] flow, and calls any [[bay]] that receives a regular flow of fresh water an "estuary". Davis does state that the terms "lagoon" and "estuary" are "often loosely applied, even in scientific literature."&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Richard A., Jr.|title=The Evolving Coast|year=1994|publisher=Scientific American Library|location=New York|isbn=9780716750420|pages=101, 107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timothy M.

In England, [[Chesil Beach#The Fleet Lagoon|The Fleet]] at Chesil Beach has also been described as a lagoon.

In Latin America, the term ''laguna'' in Spanish, which lagoon translates to, may be used for a small fresh water [[lake]] in a similar way a [[Stream|creek]] is considered a small river. However, sometimes it is popularly used to describe a full-sized [[lake]], such as [[Laguna Catemaco]] in Mexico, which is actually the third largest lake by area in the country. The [[brackish water]] lagoon may be thus explicitly identified as a "coastal lagoon" (''laguna costera''). In Portuguese the same usage is found: ''lagoa'' may be a body of shallow sea water, or a small freshwater lake not linked to the sea.

==Etymology==
Lagoon is derived from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''laguna'', which refers to the waters around [[Venice]], the [[Lagoon of Venice]]. ''Laguna'' is attested in English by at least 1612, and had been [[Anglicisation|Anglicized]] to "lagune" by 1673. In 1697 [[William Dampier]] referred to a "Lagune or Lake of Salt water" on the coast of Mexico. Captain [[James Cook]] described an island "of Oval form with a Lagoon in the middle" in 1769.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= |first= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |title= |trans-title=|language= |edition=Compact |date= |year=1971 |month= |publisher=Oxford University Press |volume=I A-O |location=Oxford, England |id= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |page=1560 |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Atoll lagoons==
[[File:Atafutrim.jpg|thumb|Satellite picture of the [[Atafu]] atoll in [[Tokelau]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]]]
[[Atoll]] lagoons form as coral reefs grow upwards while the islands that the reefs surround subside, until eventually only the reefs remain above sea level. Unlike the lagoons that form shoreward of fringing reefs, atoll lagoons often contain some deep (&gt;20m) portions.

==Coastal lagoons==
[[File:Anzali lagoon Barry Kent.jpg|thumb|[[Anzali Lagoon]] in southwestern [[Caspian Sea]] coast, [[Iran]]]]
[[File:Hiddensee (2011-05-21).JPG|thumb|Coastal lagoon landscapes around the island of [[Hiddensee]] near [[Stralsund]], [[Germany]]. Many similar coastal lagoons can be found around the [[Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park]].]]
Coastal lagoons form along gently sloping coasts where barrier islands or reefs can develop off-shore, and the sea-level is rising relative to the land along the shore (either because of an intrinsic rise in sea-level, or [[subsidence]] of the land along the coast). Coastal lagoons do not form along steep or rocky coasts, or if the range of tides is more than {{convert|4|m|ft}}. Due to the gentle slope of the coast, coastal lagoons are shallow. They are sensitive to changes in sea level due to global warming. A relative drop in sea level may leave a lagoon largely dry, while a rise in sea level may let the sea breach or destroy barrier islands, and leave reefs too deep under water to protect the lagoon. Coastal lagoons are young and dynamic, and may be short-lived in geological terms. Coastal lagoons are common, occurring along nearly 15 percent of the world's shorelines. In the United States, lagoons are found along more than 75 percent of the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern]] and [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf coasts]].&lt;ref name=Kusky/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nybakken/&gt;

Coastal lagoons are usually connected to the open ocean by [[inlet]]s between barrier islands. The number and size of the inlets, precipitation, evaporation, and inflow of fresh water all affect the nature of the lagoon. Lagoons with little or no interchange with the open ocean, little or no inflow of fresh water, and high evaporation rates, such as [[Lake St. Lucia]], in [[South Africa]], may become highly saline. Lagoons with no connection to the open ocean and significant inflow of fresh water, such as the [[Lake Worth Lagoon#History|Lake Worth Lagoon]] in [[Florida]] in the middle of the 19th century, may be entirely fresh. On the other hand, lagoons with many wide inlets, such as the [[Wadden Sea]], have strong tidal currents and mixing. Coastal lagoons tend to accumulate sediments from inflowing rivers, from runoff from the shores of the lagoon, and from sediment carried into the lagoon through inlets by the tide. Large quantities of sediment may be occasionally be deposited in a lagoon when storm waves overwash barrier islands. [[Mangrove]]s and [[Salt marsh|marsh]] plants can facilitate the accumulation of sediment in a lagoon. [[Benthos|Benthic organisms]] may stabilize or destabilize sediments.&lt;ref name=Kusky/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nybakken/&gt;

==River-mouth lagoons on mixed sand and gravel beaches==
{{globalize|section|date=July 2015}}
[[File:The eyes of Atacama.jpg|left|thumb|Two similar freshwater lagoons close to the [[Salar de Atacama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The eyes of Atacama|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1727a/|website=www.eso.org|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

River-mouth lagoons on mixed sand and gravel (MSG) beaches form at the river-coast interface where a typically braided, although sometimes meandering, river interacts with a coastal environment that is significantly affected by longshore drift.&lt;ref name = Lauder&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirk|first=R.M. and Lauder, G.A|title=Significant coastal lagoon systems in the [[South Island]], [[New Zealand]]: coastal processes and lagoon mouth closure|year=2000|publisher=Department of Conservation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lagoons which form on the MSG [[coastline]]s are common on the east coast of the [[South Island]] of [[New Zealand]] and have long been referred to as '''hapua''' by the [[Māori people|Māori]].  This classification differentiates hapua from similar lagoons located on the New Zealand coast termed '''waituna'''.  Hapua are often located on [[paraglacial]] coastal areas&lt;ref name = Zencovich&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zenkovich|first=V.P.|title=Processes of coastal development|year=1967|publisher=Interscience Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; where there is a low level of coastal development and minimal population density.  Hapua form as the river carves out an elongated coast-parallel area, blocked from the sea by a MSG barrier which constantly alters its shape and volume due to [[longshore drift]].&lt;ref name=Lauder/&gt;&lt;ref name = Hart&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hart|first=D. E.|title=River mouth lagoon science and management|year=2009|journal=Beach management, Principles and Practice|publisher=Earthscan Publications Ltd|pages=267, 280}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Longshore drift continually extends the barrier behind which the hapua forms by [[sediment transport|transporting sediment]] along the coast.  Hapua are defined as a narrow shore-parallel extensions of the coastal riverbed.&lt;ref name=Hart/&gt;  They discharge the majority of stored water to the ocean via an ephemeral and highly mobile drainage channel or outlet.&lt;ref&gt;“Paterson, A., Hume, T., &amp; Healy, T. (2001). River mouth morphodynamics on a mixed sand-gravel coast. Journal of Coastal Research, 288–294.”&lt;/ref&gt;  The remainder percolates through the MSG barrier due to its high levels of permeability.  Hapua systems are driven by a wide range of dynamic processes that are generally classified as [[fluvial]] or [[marine geology|marine]]; changes in the balance between these processes as well as the antecedent barrier conditions can cause shifts in the morphology of the hapua, in particular the barrier.  New Zealand examples include the [[Rakaia River|Rakaia]], [[Ashburton River (New Zealand)|Ashburton]] and [[Hurunui River|Hurunui]] river-mouths.

===Hapua environment===
Hapua have been identified as establishing in the [[Canterbury Bight]] coastal region on the east coast of the South Island.  They are often found in areas of coarse-grained [[sediment]] where contributing rivers have moderately steep bed gradients.&lt;ref name=Lauder/&gt;  MSG beaches in the [[Canterbury Bight]] region contain a wide range of sediment sizes from sand to boulders&lt;ref&gt;“McLean, R. F. (1970). Variations in grain-size and sorting on two kaikoura beaches. New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 4(2), 141–164.”&lt;/ref&gt; and are exposed to the high energy waves that make up an east coast swell environment.&lt;ref&gt;“Davies, J. L. (1964). A morphogenic approach to world shorelines. Zeitschrift für Geomorphologie, 8, 127–142.”&lt;/ref&gt;  MSG beaches are reflective rather than dissipative energy zones due to their morphological characteristics.  They have a steep foreshore which is known as the ‘engine room’ of the beach profile.  In this zone, [[swash]] and backwash are dominating processes alongside longshore transport.&lt;ref&gt;“Kirk, R. M. (1980). Mixed Sand and Gravel Beaches Morphology, Processes and Sediments. Progress in Physical Geography, 4(2), 189–210. doi:10.1177/030913338000400203”&lt;/ref&gt;  MSG beaches do not have a surf zone; instead a single line of breakers is visible in all sea conditions.&lt;ref name=Lauder/&gt;  Hapua are associated with MSG beaches as the variation in sediment size allows for the barrier to be permeable.

The east coast of the South Island has been identified as being in a period of chronic erosion of approximately 0.5 metres per year.&lt;ref name = Single&gt;{{cite journal|last=Single|first=M.|title=Lake Coleridge Project-Coastal processes at Rakaia River mouth|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This erosion trend is a result of a number of factors.  According to the classification scheme of Zenkovich,&lt;ref name=Zencovich/&gt; the rivers on the east coast can be described as ‘small’; this classification is not related to their flow rate but to the insufficient amount of sediment that they transport to the coast to nourish it.  The sediment provided is not adequate to nourish the coast against its typical high energy waves and strong longshore drift.  These two processes constantly remove sediment depositing it either offshore or further up drift.&lt;ref name = Kirk&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirk|first=R.M.|title=River-beach interaction on mixed sand and gravel coasts: a geomorphic model for water resource planning|year=1991|journal=Applied Geography|pages=267–287}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the coastline becomes eroded the hapua have been 'rolling back' by eroding the backshore to move landwards.&lt;ref name=Hart/&gt;

Hapua or river-mouth lagoons form in micro-tidal environments.  A micro-tidal environment is where the tidal range (distance between low tide and high tide) is less than two metres.&lt;ref name=Lauder/&gt;  Tidal currents in a micro-tidal zone are less than those found on meso-tidal (two – four metres) and macro-tidal (greater than four metres) coastlines.&lt;ref&gt;”Short, A.D. (1991). Macro-Meso Tidal Beach Morphodynamics: An Overview. Journal of Coastal Research,417-436.”&lt;/ref&gt;  Hapua form in this type of tidal environment as the tidal currents are unable to compete with the powerful freshwater flows of the rivers therefore there is no negligible tidal penetration to the lagoon.&lt;ref name=Lauder/&gt;  A fourth element of the environment in which hapua form is the strong longshore drift component.&lt;ref name=Lauder/&gt;  Longshore or littoral drift is the transportation of sediments along the coast at an angle to the shoreline.  In the Canterbury Bight coastal area; the dominant swell direction is northwards from the Southern Ocean.&lt;ref name=Lauder/&gt;  Therefore, the principal movement of sediment via longshore drift is north towards Banks Peninsula.  Hapua are located in areas dominated by longshore drift; because it aids the formation of the barrier behind which the hapua is sited.

A hapua also requires sediment to form the lagoon barrier.  Sediment which nourishes the east coast of [[New Zealand]] can be sourced from three different areas.  Material from the highly erodible [[Southern Alps (New Zealand)|Southern Alps]] is removed via weathering; then carried across the Canterbury Plains by various braided rivers to the east coast beaches.&lt;ref name=Hart/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirk/&gt;  The second source of sediment is the high cliffs which are located in the hinterland of lagoons.&lt;ref name=Kirk/&gt;  These can be eroded during the occurrence of high river flow or sea storm events.  Beaches further south provide nourishment to the northern coast via longshore transport.

===Hapua characteristics===

Hapua have a number of characteristics which includes shifts between a variety of morphodynamic states due to changes in the balance between marine and fluvial processes as well as the antecedent barrier conditions.&lt;ref name=Hart/&gt;  The MSG barrier constantly changes size and shape as a result of the longshore drift.  Water stored in the hapua drains to the coast predominately though an outlet; although it can also seep through the barrier depending on the permeability of the material.&lt;ref name=Hart/&gt;&lt;ref name = Goring&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goring|first=D.G and Valentine, R.M.|title=Tidal Hydraulics of a large, gravel-bed river mouth: the Rakaia hapua|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in the level of the lagoon water do not occur as a result of saltwater or tidal intrusion.  Water in a hapua is predominately freshwater originating from the associated river.  Hapua are non-estuarine, there is no tidal inflow however the tide does have an effect on the level of water in the lagoon.  As the tide reaches its peak, the lagoon water has a much smaller amount of barrier to permeate through so the lagoon level rises.&lt;ref&gt;“Hume, T. M., &amp; Herdendorf, C. E. (1988). A geomorphic classification of estuaries and its application to coastal resource management–A New-Zealand example. Ocean and Shoreline Management, 11(3), 249–274.”&lt;/ref&gt;  This is related to a physics theory known as hydraulic head.  The lagoon level has a similar sinusoidal wave shape as the tide but reaches its peak slightly later.&lt;ref name=Goring/&gt;  In general, any saltwater intrusion into the hapua will only occur during a storm via wave overtopping or sea spray.&lt;ref name=Hart/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirk/&gt;

Hapua can act as both a source and sink of sediment.&lt;ref name=Single/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirk/&gt;  The majority of sediment in the hapua is fluvial sourced.&lt;ref name=Lauder/&gt;  During medium to low river flows, coarser sediment generally collects in the hapua; while some of the finer sediment can be transported through the outlet to the coast.&lt;ref name=Kirk/&gt;  During flood events the hapua is 'flushed out' with larger amounts of sediment transferred through the outlet.  This sediment can be deposited offshore or downdrift of the hapua replenishing the undernourished beach.&lt;ref name=Kirk/&gt;  If a large amount of material is released to the coast at one time it can be identified as a 'slug'.  These can often be visible from aerial photographs.

Antecedent barrier conditions combined with changes in the balance between marine and fluvial processes results in shifts between a variety of morphological states in a hapua or river-mouth lagoon on a MSG beach.  Marine processes includes the direction of wave approach, wave height and the coincidence of storm waves with high tides.&lt;ref name = Bryan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hart|first=D.E. and Bryan, K.R|title=New Zealand coastal system boundaries, connections and management|year=2008|journal=New Zealand Geographer|pages=129–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marine processes tend to dominate the majority of morphodynamic conditions until there is a large enough flood event in the associated river to breach the barrier.&lt;ref name=Lauder/&gt;  The level and frequency of base or flood flows are attributed to fluvial processes.  Antecedent barrier conditions are the permeability, volume and height of the barrier as well as the width and presence of previous outlet channels.&lt;ref name=Bryan/&gt;  During low to medium river flows, the outlet from the lagoon to the sea becomes offset in the direction of longshore drift.&lt;ref name=Kirk/&gt;  Outlet efficiency tends to decrease the further away from the main river-mouth the outlet is.&lt;ref name=Hart/&gt;  A decrease in efficiency can cause the outlet to become choked with sediment and the hapua to close temporarily.  The potential for closure varies between different hapua depending on whether marine or fluvial processes are the bigger driver in the event.  A high flow event; such as a fresh or flood can breach the barrier directly opposite the main river channel.&lt;ref name=Hart/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirk/&gt;  This causes an immediate decrease in the water level of the hapua; as well as transporting previously deposited sediments into the ocean.  Flood events are important for eroding lagoon back shores; this is a behaviour which allows hapua to retreat landward and thus remain coastal landforms even with coastal transgression and sea level rise.&lt;ref name=Hart/&gt;  During high flow events there is also the possibility for secondary breaches of the barrier or lagoon truncation to occur.

Storm events also have the ability to close hapua outlets as waves overtop the barrier depositing sediment and choking the scoured channel.&lt;ref name=Single/&gt;  The resultant swift increase in lagoon water level causes a new outlet to be breached rapidly due to the large hydraulic head that forms between the lagoon and sea water levels.  Storm breaching is believed to be an important but unpredictable control on the duration of closures at low to moderate river flow levels in smaller hapua.&lt;ref name=Single/&gt;

Hapua are extremely important for a number of reasons.  They provide a link between the river and sea for migrating fish as well as a corridor for migratory birds.&lt;ref name=Lauder/&gt;&lt;ref name = Hemmingsen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Single|first=M.B. and Hemmingson, M.A.|title=Mixed sand and gravel barrier beaches of South Canterbury, New Zealand|year=2001|journal=Ecology and Geomorphology of Coastal Shinge|pages=261–276}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To lose this link via closure of the hapua outlet could result in losing entire generations of specific species as they may need to migrate to the ocean or the river as a vital part of their lifecycle.  River-mouth lagoons such as hapua were also used a source for ''mahinga kai'' (food gathering) by the Māori people.&lt;ref name=Lauder/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hemmingsen/&gt;  However, this is no longer the case due to catchment degradation which has resulted in lagoon deterioration.  River-mouth lagoons on MSG beaches are not well explained in international literature.

===Hapua case study===
[[File:Rakaia River Mouth.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial photograph of the Rakaia river-mouth and associated hapua]]
The hapua located at the mouth of the Rakaia River stretches approximately three kilometres north from where the river-mouth reaches the coast.  The average width of the hapua between 1952 and 2004 was approximately 50 metres; whilst the surface area has stabilised at approximately 600,000 square metres since 1966.&lt;ref&gt;"McHaffie, N. (n.d.). A GIS based analysis of changes in the Rakaia Hapua, Canterbury."&lt;/ref&gt;  The coastal hinterland is composed of erodible cliffs and a low-lying area commonly known as the Rakaia Huts.  This area has changed notably since European Settlement; with the drainage of ecologically significant wetlands and development of the small bach community.

The Rakaia River begins in the Southern Alps, providing approximately 4.2 Mt per year of sediment to the east coast.  It is a braided river with a catchment area of 3105 kilometres squared and a mean flow of 221 cubic metres per second.&lt;ref&gt;"Hart, D. E. (2009). Morphodynamics of non-estuarine rivermouth lagoons on high-energy coasts. Journal of Coastal Research, SI 56 Proceedings of the 10th International Coastal Symposium."&lt;/ref&gt;  The mouth of the Rakaia River reaches the coast south of Banks Peninsula.  As the river reaches the coast it diverges into two channels; with the main channel flowing to the south of the island.&lt;ref name=Single/&gt;  As the hapua is located in the Canterbury Bight it is in a state of constant morphological change due to the prevailing southerly sea swells and resultant northwards longshore drift.

This is a '''list of Superfund sites in Minnesota''' designated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) environmental law.  The CERCLA federal law of 1980 authorized the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to create a list of [[Pollution|polluted]] locations requiring a long-term response to clean up hazardous material contaminations.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 96-510, {{USC|42|9601|9675}}), December 11, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;  These locations are known as [[Superfund]] sites, and are placed on the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL).  

The NPL guides the EPA in "determining which sites warrant further investigation" for [[environmental remediation]].&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  As of May 4, 2010, there were 25 Superfund sites on the National Priorities List in [[Minnesota]].&lt;ref name="NPL"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/ |title=National Priorities List |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  21 others have been cleaned up and removed from the list; none are currently proposed for addition.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;

The flags were created by King [[Vajiravudh]] in 1910. In accordance with ancient tradition the flags are to be used as a pair, with the Garuda flag always to the king's right and the Hanuman flag to the king's left. Perhaps as a signal to soldiers in ancient times, the location and the direction of travel of the king. The flags are always carried by officers of the [[King's Guard (Thailand)|King's guard]] and accompanies the king (when in military uniform) when he travels in a royal procession or military parade. The flags only appear on important royal ceremonies, such as the [[Thai Royal Guards parade]]. Unlike the [[Royal Standard of Thailand]], which is to be used on every occasion when the king is present.

Many cutaneous conditions require a skin biopsy for confirmation of the diagnosis.  With several of these conditions there are features within the cells contained in the skin biopsy specimen that have elements in their cytoplasm or nucleus that have a characteristic appearance unique to the condition.  These elements are termed inclusion bodies.

Apple's software products include the [[macOS]], [[iOS]], [[tvOS]] and [[watchOS]] operating systems, the [[iTunes]] media player, the [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] web browser, and the [[iLife]] suite of multimedia and creativity software.&lt;ref name=4qresults&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-06-26|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/10/22results.html|title=Apple Reports Fourth Quarter Results|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|date=2007-10-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517125920/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/10/22results.html|archivedate=2008-05-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of {{currentmonthname}} {{currentyear}}, Apple is publicly known to have [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquired]] 72 companies. The actual number of acquisitions is possibly larger as Apple does not reveal the majority of its acquisitions unless discovered by journals. Apple has also purchased [[Equity (finance)|stake]]s in three companies, as well as made three [[divestment]]s. Apple has not released the financial details for the majority of its mergers and acquisitions.

Apple's business philosophy is to acquire small companies that can be easily integrated into existing company projects.&lt;ref name=businessweek /&gt; For instance, Apple acquired [[Emagic]] and its professional music software, [[Logic Pro]], in 2002. The acquisition was incorporated in the creation of the [[digital audio workstation]] software [[GarageBand]], now part of the iLife software suite.&lt;ref name=businessweek&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-06-26 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/mar2007/tc20070301_402290.htm |title=What to Do with Apple's Cash |publisher=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |date=2007-03-01 |author=Hesseldahl, Arik |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514121620/http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/mar2007/tc20070301_402290.htm |archivedate=May 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company made its first acquisition on March 2, 1988, with its purchase of Network Innovations. In its two divestments, both of which were during the 1990s, parts of the company were sold to other companies. In 2013, Apple acquired thirteen companies—more than it has in any other year so far. Apple's largest acquisition was that of [[Beats Electronics]] in August 2014 for [[United States dollar|US$]]3 billion.&lt;ref name="Beats"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/05/28/apple-acquires-beats-electronics-for-3-billion/ |title=Apple acquires Beats Electronics for $3 billion |website=Engadget |date=August 1, 2014 |accessdate=August 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the companies Apple has acquired, 67 were based in the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10516">The first description of multiple-prism arrays, and multiple-prism dispersion, was given by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] in his book ''[[Opticks]]''.&lt;ref&gt;I. Newton, ''Opticks'' (Royal Society, London, 1704).&lt;/ref&gt;  Prism pair expanders were introduced by [[David Brewster|Brewster]] in 1813.&lt;ref&gt;D. Brewster, ''A Treatise on New Philosophical Instruments for Various Purposes in the Arts and Sciences with Experiments on Light and Colours'' (Murray and Blackwood, Edinburgh, 1813).&lt;/ref&gt; A modern mathematical description of the single-prism dispersion was given by [[Max Born|Born]] and [[Emil Wolf|Wolf]] in 1959.&lt;ref name=B1&gt;M. Born and E. Wolf, ''Principles of Optics'', 7th Ed. (Cambridge University, Cambridge, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;  The generalized multiple-prism dispersion theory was introduced by [[F. J. Duarte|Duarte]] and Piper&lt;ref name="DuarteOC"&gt;F. J. Duarte and J. A. Piper, "Dispersion theory of multiple-prism beam expanders for pulsed dye lasers", ''Opt. Commun.'' '''43''', 303–307 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DuarteAJP"&gt;F. J. Duarte and J. A. Piper, "Generalized prism dispersion theory", ''Am. J. Phys.'' '''51''', 1132–1134 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; in 1982.

Duarte, T. S. Taylor, A. Costela, I. Garcia-Moreno, and R. Sastre, Long-pulse narrow-linewidth disperse solid-state dye laser oscillator, ''Appl. Opt.'' '''37''', 3987–3989 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
==Generalized multiple-prism dispersion equations==
The generalized mathematical description of multiple-prism dispersion, as a function of the angle of incidence, prism geometry, prism refractive index, and number of prisms, was introduced as a design tool for [[multiple-prism grating laser oscillators]] by [[F. J. Duarte|Duarte]] and Piper,&lt;ref name="DuarteOC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DuarteAJP"/&gt; and is given by

:&lt;math&gt;(\partial\phi_{2,m}/\partial\lambda) = H_{2,m} (\partial n_m/\partial\lambda) + (k_{1,m}k_{2,m})^{-1}\bigg(H_{1,m}(\partial n_m/\partial\lambda) \pm\ (\partial\phi_{2,(m-1)}/\partial\lambda)\bigg)&lt;/math&gt;

which can also be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\lambda}\phi_{2,m} = H_{2,m}\nabla_{\lambda}n_m + (k_{1,m}k_{2,m})^{-1}\bigg(H_{1,m}\nabla_{\lambda}n_m \pm \nabla_{\lambda}\phi_{2,(m-1)}\bigg)&lt;/math&gt;

using 

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_\lambda = \partial/\partial \lambda&lt;/math&gt;

Also,

:&lt;math&gt;k_{1,m} = \cos\psi_{1,m}/\cos\phi_{1,m}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;k_{2,m} = \cos\phi_{2,m}/\cos\psi_{2,m}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;H_{1,m} = (\tan\phi_{1,m})/n_m&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;H_{2,m} = (\tan\phi_{2,m})/n_m&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\phi_{1,m}&lt;/math&gt; is the angle of incidence, at the ''m''th prism, and &lt;math&gt;\psi_{1,m}&lt;/math&gt; its corresponding angle of refraction. Similarly, &lt;math&gt;\phi_{2,m}&lt;/math&gt; is the exit angle and &lt;math&gt;\psi_{2,m}&lt;/math&gt; its corresponding angle of refraction.   The two main equations give the first order dispersion for an array of ''m'' prisms at the exit surface of the ''m''th prism. The plus sign in the second term in parentheses refers to a positive dispersive configuration while the minus sign refers to a compensating configuration.&lt;ref name="DuarteOC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DuarteAJP"/&gt;  The ''k'' factors are the corresponding beam expansions, and the ''H'' factors are additional geometrical quantities.  It can also be seen that the dispersion of the ''m''th prism depends on the dispersion of the previous prism (''m'' - 1).

These equations can also be used to quantify the angular dispersion in prism arrays, as described in [[Isaac Newton]]'s book ''[[Opticks]]'', and as deployed in dispersive instrumentation such as multiple-prism spectrometers.   A comprehensive review on practical multiple-prism [[beam expander]]s and multiple-prism angular dispersion theory, including explicit and ready to apply equations (engineering style), is given by Duarte.&lt;ref name="TLO"/&gt;

More recently, the generalized multiple-prism dispersion theory has been extended to include positive and [[negative refraction]].&lt;ref&gt;F. J. Duarte, Multiple-prism dispersion equations for positive and negative refraction, ''Appl. Phys. B'' '''82''', 35-38 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, higher order phase derivatives have been derived using a Newtonian iterative approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/98gr542030t720h7/?p=521f833aeb0c4542a661a42336f49994&amp;pi=28 F. J. Duarte, Generalized multiple-prism dispersion theory for laser pulse compression: higher order phase derivatives, ''Appl. Phys. B'' '''96''', 809-814 (2009)].&lt;/ref&gt; This extension of the theory enables the evaluation of the Nth higher derivative via an elegant mathematical framework.  Applications include further refinements in the design of [[Prism compressor|prism pulse compressors]] and [[nonlinear optics]].

===Single-prism dispersion===

For a single generalized prism (''m'' = 1), the generalized multiple-prism dispersion equation simplifies to&lt;ref name=B1/&gt;&lt;ref name="DLP"&gt;F. J. Duarte, Narrow-linewidth pulsed dye laser oscillators, in ''Dye Laser Principles'' (Academic, New York, 1990) Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(\partial\phi_{2,1}/\partial\lambda) =  (sin\psi_{2,1}/cos\phi_{2,1})(\partial n_1/\partial\lambda) + (cos\psi_{2,1}/cos\phi_{2,1})tan\psi_{1,1}(\partial n_1/\partial\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;

If the single prism is a right-angled prism with the beam exiting normal to the output face, that is &lt;math&gt;\phi_{2,m}&lt;/math&gt; equal to zero, this equation reduces to&lt;ref name="TLO"&gt;F. J. Duarte, ''Tunable Laser Optics'' (Elsevier Academic, New York, 2003) Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(\partial\phi_{2,1}/\partial\lambda) = tan\psi_{1,1} (\partial n_1/\partial\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:prism-compressor.svg|thumb|330px|A two-prism pulse compressor as deployed in some femtosecond laser configurations.]]
[[File:Dual prism expander and grating reflector for a dye laser.jpg|thumb|330px|This multiple-prism arrangement is used with a [[diffraction grating]] to provide tuning in a dye laser.]]

==Intracavity dispersion and laser linewidth==

The first application of this theory was to evaluate the [[laser linewidth]] in multiple-prism grating  laser oscillators.&lt;ref name="DuarteOC"/&gt;   The total intracavity angular dispersion plays an important role in the [[laser linewidth|linewidth narrowing]] of pulsed tunable lasers through the equation&lt;ref name="DuarteOC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TLO"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta\lambda \approx \Delta \theta \left({\partial\Theta\over\partial\lambda}\right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta \theta&lt;/math&gt; is the beam divergence and the ''overall intracavity angular dispersion'' is the quantity in parentheses (elevated to –1).  Although originally classical in origin, in 1992 it was shown that this laser cavity linewidth equation can also be derived from [[N-slit interferometric equation|interferometric quantum principles]].&lt;ref&gt;F. J. Duarte, Cavity dispersion equation: a note on its origin, ''Appl. Opt.'' '''31''', 6979-6982 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

For the special case of zero dispersion from the multiple-prism beam expander, the single-pass [[laser linewidth]] is given by&lt;ref name="TLO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DLP"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta\lambda \approx \Delta \theta \left(M {\partial\theta\over\partial\lambda}\right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M'' is the beam magnification provided by the beam expander that multiplies the angular dispersion provided by the diffraction grating.  In practice, ''M'' can be as high as 100-200.&lt;ref name="TLO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DLP"/&gt;

When the dispersion of the multiple-prism expander is not equal to zero, then the single-pass linewidth is given by&lt;ref name="DuarteOC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TLO"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta\lambda \approx \Delta \theta \left(M {\partial\theta\over\partial\lambda} + {\partial\phi_{2,m}\over\partial\lambda} \right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where the first differential refers to the angular dispersion from the grating and the second differential refers to the overall dispersion from the multiple-prism beam expander (given in the section above).&lt;ref name="TLO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DLP"/&gt;

==Further applications==

In 1987 the multiple-prism angular dispersion theory was extended to provide explicit second order equations directly applicable to the design of [[prism compressor|prismatic pulse compressors]].&lt;ref&gt;F. J. Duarte, "Generalized multiple-prism dispersion theory for pulse compression in ultrafast dye lasers", ''Opt. Quantum Electron.'' '''19''', 223–229 (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pal Lahara''' ({{lang-or|ପାଳଲହଡ଼ା ଗଡ଼ଜାତ ରାଜ୍ୟ}}, was a  [[princely state]] in what is today India during the [[British Raj]]. It had its capital at [[Pal Lahara]].&lt;ref name="Dept1930"&gt;{{Cite book |author=India. Foreign and Political Department |title=A collection of treaties, engagements and sanads relating to India and neighbouring countries |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gfwlAAAAMAAJ |year=1930 |publisher=Government of India Central Publication Branch |page=340 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The state had an area of {{convert|452|sqmi|km2}} and a population of 34,130 in 1892. In 1947 it was merged into independent India, becoming [[Dhenkanal District]] of [[Orissa State]] (now Odisha) in 1948.

== History ==
According to tradition, the first ruler was a Suryavanshi [[Rajput]] of [[Dharanagar]] named Santosh Pal. While returning from a pilgrimage to [[Puri]] he crossed this territory and made peace between two local tribal groups. As a result, Santosh Pal was elected as ruler by the [[Sabara people]], one of the tribes involved in the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianrajputs.com/view/pal_lahara Rajput Provinces of India - Pal Lahara (Princely State)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rulers == 
The rulers of the Pal Lahara princely state claimed to be descendants of [[Raja Bhoj]] of [[Dhar State|Dhar]], from the ancient Rajput [[Paramara dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.iinet.net.au/~royalty/ips/p/pallahara.html Pal Lahara Princely State]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter von Glehn''' ({{lang-ru|Пётр Петрович Глен}}, ''Pyotr Petrovich Glen''; {{OldStyleDate|8 November|1835|27 October}} in [[Jälgimäe]], [[Governorate of Estonia]], [[Russian Empire]] – {{OldStyleDate|16 April|1876|4 April}} in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russian Empire]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/19100033/Nikolai-von-Glehn-loovisikuna|title=Nikolai von Glehn loovisikuna|last=Einama|first=Anna-Kristiina|publisher=[[Tallinn University|Tallinn Pedagogical University]]|pages=7|language=Estonian|accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Russian Empire|Russian]] [[botanist]].

Peter von Glehn was born to a Baltic German landowner, member of the Glehn family, Peter von Glehn (1796–1843) (he bought the [[Jälgimäe]] manor ({{lang-de|Jelgimeggi}}) in 1821) and Auguste Caroline Marie [[Both family|Burchart von Bellavary]], member of the Burchardt family who took care of the [[Raeapteek|Town Hall Pharmacy]] in [[Tallinn|Reval]]. He had 2 younger brothers: [[Nikolai von Glehn|Nikolai]] (1841–1923), the founder of [[Nõmme]], and Len von Glehn, (1844-1920), and 3 sisters: Marie Elisabeth (1840–????), Julie Wilhelmine (1842–1867) and Marie (1843–1884).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/19100033/Nikolai-von-Glehn-loovisikuna|title=Nikolai von Glehn loovisikuna|last=Einama|first=Anna-Kristiina|publisher=[[Tallinn University|Tallinn Pedagogical University]]|pages=9|language=Estonian|accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated the [[University of Tartu]] with gold medal.

They provide a crucial source of food to many large aquatic organisms, such as [[fish]] and [[whale]]s.

These organisms include [[bacteria]], [[archaea]], [[algae]], [[protozoa]] and drifting or floating [[animal]]s that inhabit—for example—the [[pelagic zone]] of [[ocean]]s, [[sea]]s, or bodies of [[fresh water]]. Essentially, plankton are defined by their [[ecological niche]] rather than any [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] or [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] classification.

Though many planktonic [[species]] are [[microscopic scale|microscopic]] in size, ''plankton'' includes organisms over a wide range of sizes, including large organisms such as [[jellyfish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.institut-ocean.org/images/articles/documents/1354542960.pdf |title= Microzooplankton: the microscopic (micro) animals (zoo) of the plankton |author= John Dolan |date= November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Technically the term does not include organisms on the surface of the water, which are called ''[[pleuston]]''—or those that swim actively in the water, which are called ''[[nekton]]''.

Bericht der Commission zur Wissenschaftlichen Untersuchung der Deutschen Meere'', Jahrgang 12-16, p. 1-108, [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/108760#page/5/mode/1up].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=plankton |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |work= etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some forms are capable of independent movement and can swim hundreds of meters vertically in a single day (a behavior called [[diel vertical migration]]), their horizontal position is primarily determined by the surrounding water movement, and plankton typically flow with [[ocean current]]s. This is in contrast to [[nekton]] organisms, such as [[fish]], [[squid]] and [[marine mammal]]s, which can swim against the ambient flow and control their position in the environment.

Within the plankton, [[holoplankton]] spend their entire [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] as plankton (e.g. most [[algae]], [[copepod]]s, [[salp]]s, and some [[jellyfish]]). By contrast, [[meroplankton]] are only planktic for part of their lives (usually the [[larva]]l stage), and then graduate to either a nektic (swimming) or [[benthos|benthic]] (sea floor) existence. Examples of meroplankton include the larvae of [[sea urchin]]s, [[starfish]], [[crustacean]]s, marine [[worm]]s, and most [[fish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Karleskint |first1=George |last2=Turner |first2=Richard |last3=Small |first3=James |title=Introduction to Marine Biology |edition=4th |publisher= Brooks/Cole |date=2013 |pages= |chapter= Chapter 17: The Open Sea |isbn=978-1-133-36446-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Abundance (ecology)|amount]] and [[Species distribution|distribution]] of plankton depends on available nutrients, the [[water column|state of water]] and a large amount of other plankton.&lt;ref name="Book-2013"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Agrawai |first1=Anju |last2=Gopnal |first2=Krishna |title= Biomonitoring of Water and Waste Water |page=34 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Cf4_AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=Plankton+abundance+and+distribution+are+strongly+dependent+on+factors+such+as+ambient+nutrient+concentrations,+the+physical+state+of+the+water+column,+and+the+abundance+of+other+plankton.#v=onepage |date=2013 |work=Springer India 2013 |accessdate= April 2, 2018 |isbn=978-8-132-20864-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of plankton is termed [[planktology]] and a planktonic individual is referred to as a plankter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/463117/plankter |title= plankter - marine biology |work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adjective ''planktonic'' is widely used in both the scientific and popular literature, and is a generally accepted term. However, from the standpoint of prescriptive grammar, the less-commonly used ''planktic'' is more strictly the correct adjective. When deriving English words from their Greek or Latin roots, the gender-specific ending (in this case, "-on" which indicates the word is neuter) is normally dropped, using only the root of the word in the derivation.&lt;ref name="Emiliani, C."&gt;{{cite journal |last=Emiliani |first=C. |year=1991 |title=Planktic/Planktonic, Nektic/Nektonic, Benthic/Benthonic |journal= Journal of Paleontology |volume=65 |pages= 329 |jstor=1305769 |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trophic groups ==
[[File:hyperia.jpg |thumb|An [[amphipoda|amphipod]] (''Hyperia macrocephala'')|alt=Photo of mostly-translucent, many-legged, bug-like creature]]

Plankton are primarily divided into broad functional (or [[trophic level]]) groups:   
* '''[[Phytoplankton]]''' (from Greek ''phyton'', or plant), [[autotroph]]ic [[prokaryote |prokaryotic]] or [[eukaryote |eukaryotic]] [[alga]]e that live near the water surface where there is sufficient [[light]] to support [[photosynthesis]]. Among the more important groups are the [[diatom]]s, [[cyanobacteria]], [[dinoflagellate]]s and [[coccolithophore]]s.
* '''[[Zooplankton]]''' (from Greek ''zoon'', or animal), small [[protozoa]]ns or [[metazoa]]ns (e.g. [[crustacean]]s and other [[animal]]s) that feed on other plankton. Some of the [[egg (biology)|eggs]] and [[larva]]e of larger nektonic animals, such as fish, crustaceans, and [[annelid]]s, are included here.
* '''[[Bacterioplankton]]''', [[bacterium|bacteria]] and [[archaea]], which play an important role in [[remineralisation|remineralising]] organic material down the water column (note that prokaryotic phytoplankton are also bacterioplankton).
* '''[[Mycoplankton]]''', [[fungi]] and [[Fungus#Fungus-like organisms|fungus-like organisms]], which, like bacterioplankton, are also significant in remineralisation and [[nutrient cycling]].&lt;ref&gt;Wang, G., Wang, X., Liu, X., &amp; Li, Q. (2012). "Diversity and biogeochemical function of planktonic fungi in the ocean". In: C. Raghukumar (ed.), ''Biology of Marine Fungi''. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, p. 71-88, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1kE5OpuGp9YC].&lt;/ref&gt;
   
This scheme divides the plankton community into broad producer, consumer and recycler groups. However, determining the trophic level of many plankton is not always straightforward. For example, although most [[dinoflagellates]] are either [[photosynthesis |photosynthetic]] producers or [[heterotrophic]] consumers, many species perform both roles. In this mixed trophic strategy — known as [[mixotroph]]y — organisms act as both producers and consumers, either at the same time or switching between modes of nutrition in response to ambient conditions. For instance, relying on photosynthesis for growth when nutrients and light are abundant, but switching to predation when growing conditions are poor. Recognition of the importance of mixotrophy as an ecological strategy is increasing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hartmann |first1=M. |last2=Grob |first2=C. |last3=Tarran |first3=G.A. |last4=Martin |first4=A.P. |last5=Burkill |first5=P.H. |last6=Scanlan |first6=D.J. |last7=Zubkov |first7=M.V. |date=2012 |title=Mixotrophic basis of Atlantic oligotrophic ecosystems |url= http://www.pnas.org/content/109/15/5756 |journal=Proc.

However, some of these terms may be used with very different boundaries, especially on the larger end. The existence and importance of nano- and even smaller plankton was only discovered during the 1980s, but they are thought to make up the largest proportion of all plankton in number and diversity.

The microplankton and smaller groups are [[microorganism]]s and operate at low [[Reynolds number]]s, where the viscosity of water is much more important than its mass or inertia.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dusenbery, David B. |authorlink= |title=Living at micro scale: the unexpected physics of being small |edition= |publisher=Harvard University Press |location= Cambridge |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=978-0-674-03116-6 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution ==
[[File:World plankton prevailence.PNG |thumb |400px|right|thumb|World distribution of plankton]]
Plankton inhabit oceans, seas, lakes, ponds. Local abundance varies horizontally, vertically and seasonally. The primary cause of this variability is the availability of light. All plankton ecosystems are driven by the input of solar energy (but see [[chemosynthesis]]), confining primary production to surface waters, and to geographical regions and seasons having abundant light.

A secondary variable is nutrient availability. Although large areas of the [[tropics |tropical]] and [[sub-tropical]] oceans have abundant light, they experience relatively low primary production because they offer limited nutrients such as [[nitrate]], [[phosphate]] and [[silicate]]. This results from large-scale [[ocean current|ocean circulation]] and water column [[Stratification (water) |stratification]]. In such regions, primary production usually occurs at greater depth, although at a reduced level (because of reduced light).

Despite significant [[macronutrient]] concentrations, some ocean regions are unproductive (so-called [[HNLC|HNLC regions]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iron primarily reaches the ocean through the deposition of dust on the sea surface.  Paradoxically, oceanic areas adjacent to unproductive, [[arid]] land thus typically have abundant phytoplankton (e.g., the eastern [[Atlantic Ocean]], where [[trade winds]] bring dust from the [[Sahara Desert]] in north [[Africa]]).

While plankton are most abundant in surface waters, they live throughout the water column. At depths where no primary production occurs, [[zooplankton]] and [[bacterioplankton]] instead consume organic material sinking from more productive surface waters above. This flux of sinking material, so-called [[marine snow]], can be especially high following the termination of [[spring bloom]]s.

== Ecological significance ==
===Food chain===
Aside from representing the bottom few levels of a [[food chain]] that supports commercially important [[Fishery|fisheries]], plankton [[ecosystem]]s play a role in the [[biogeochemical cycle]]s of many important [[chemical element]]s, including the ocean's [[carbon cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Falkowski |first=Paul G. |year=1994 |url= ftp://marine.calpoly.edu/Needles/SPRING%2009/papers/2-Falkowski.pdf |title=The role of phytoplankton photosynthesis in global biogeochemical cycles |journal=Photosyntheis Research |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=235–258 |doi= 10.1007/BF00014586 |pmid=24311124 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carbon cycle===
Primarily by grazing on phytoplankton, zooplankton  provide [[carbon]] to the planktic [[foodweb]], either [[Cellular respiration|respiring]] it to provide [[metabolism|metabolic]] energy, or upon death as [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] or [[detritus]]. Organic material tends to be [[density|denser]] than [[seawater]], so it sinks into open ocean ecosystems away from the coastlines, transporting carbon along with it. This process, called the ''[[biological pump]]'', is one reason that oceans constitute the largest [[carbon sink]] on [[Earth science |Earth]]. However, it has been shown to be influenced by increments of temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Sarmento |first1= H. |last2= Montoya |first2= JM. |last3= Vázquez-Domínguez |first3= E. |last4= Vaqué |first4= D.|last5= Gasol |first5= JM. |year= 2010 |title= Warming effects on marine microbial food web processes: how far can we go when it comes to predictions? |pmc= 2880134 |journal= Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume= 365 |issue=1549 |pages= 2137–2149 |doi= 10.1098/rstb.2010.0045 |pmid= 20513721 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Vázquez-Domínguez |first1= E. |last2= Vaqué |first2= D. |last3= Gasol |first3= JM. |year=2007 |title= Ocean warming enhances respiration and carbon demand of coastal microbial plankton. |journal= Global Change Biology |volume= 13 |issue=7 |pages= 1327–1334 |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01377.x |bibcode= 2007GCBio..13.1327V |hdl= 10261/15731 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Vázquez-Domínguez |first1= E. |last2= Vaqué |first2= D. |last3= Gasol |first3= JM. |year= 2012 |title= Temperature effects on the heterotrophic bacteria, heterotrophic nanoflagellates, and microbial top predators of NW Mediterranean. |url= http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/ame/v67/n2/p107-121/ |journal= Aquatic Microbial Ecology |volume= 67 |issue=2 |pages= 107–121 |doi= 10.3354/ame01583 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Mazuecos |first1= E. |last2= Arístegui |first2=J. |last3= Vázquez-Domínguez |first3= E. |last4= Ortega-Retuerta |first4= E. |last5= Gasol |first5= JM. |last6= Reche |first6= I. |year=2012 |title= Temperature control of microbial respiration and growth efficiency in the mesopelagic zone of the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans. |url= https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967063714001976 |journal= Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers  |volume= 95 |issue=2 |pages= 131–138 |doi= 10.3354/ame01583 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It might be possible to increase the ocean's uptake of [[Carbon dioxide#In the Earth.27s atmosphere|carbon dioxide]] ({{chem|C|O|2}}) generated through [[Human impact on the environment|human activities]] by increasing plankton production through ''[[Iron fertilization|seeding]]'', primarily with the [[micronutrient]] [[iron]]. However, this technique may not be practical at a large scale. Ocean [[Anoxic sea water|oxygen depletion]] and resultant [[methanogen|methane production]] (caused by the excess production [[remineralisation|remineralising]] at depth) is one potential drawback.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Oxygen production===
[[Phytoplankton]] absorb energy from the Sun and nutrients from the water to produce their own nourishment or energy. In the process of [[photosynthesis]], phytoplankton release molecular [[oxygen]] ({{chem|O|2}}) into the water as a waste biproduct. It is estimated that about 50% of the world's oxygen is produced via phytoplankton photosynthesis.&lt;ref name="NalGeo"&gt;{{cite news |last=Roach |first=John |url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/06/0607_040607_phytoplankton.html |title=Source of Half Earth's Oxygen Gets Little Credit |work=National Geographic News |date=June 7, 2004 |accessdate=2016-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest is produced via photosynthesis on land by [[plant]]s.&lt;ref name="NalGeo"/&gt; Furthermore, phytoplankton photosynthesis has controlled the atmospheric [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|{{chem|C|O|2}}]]/[[Oxygen#Build-up in the atmosphere|{{chem|O|2}}]] balance since the early [[Precambrian]] Eon.&lt;ref name="Tappan"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Primary production, isotopes, extinctions and the atmosphere |journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |date=April 1968 |last=Tappan |first=Helen |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=187–210 |doi=10.1016/0031-0182(68)90047-3 |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0031018268900473 |accessdate=2016-04-04 |bibcode= 1968PPP.....4..187T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biomass variability==
The growth of phytoplankton populations is dependent on light levels and nutrient availability.  The chief factor limiting growth varies from region to region in the world's oceans.  On a broad scale, growth of phytoplankton in the oligotrophic tropical and subtropical gyres is generally limited by nutrient supply, while light often limits phytoplankton growth in subarctic gyres.  Environmental variability at multiple scales influences the nutrient and light available for phytoplankton, and as these organisms form the base of the marine food web, this variability in phytoplankton growth influences higher trophic levels.  For example, at interannual scales phytoplankton levels temporarily plummet during [[El Niño]] periods, influencing populations of zooplankton, fishes, sea birds, and [[marine mammal]]s.

The effects of anthropogenic warming on the global population of phytoplankton is an area of active research.  Changes in the vertical stratification of the water column, the rate of temperature-dependent biological reactions, and the atmospheric supply of nutrients are expected to have important impacts on future phytoplankton productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Steinacher, M., et al. (2010). "Projected 21st century decrease in marine productivity: a multi-model analysis". ''Biogeosciences'', 7, 979-1005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, changes in the mortality of phytoplankton due to rates of zooplankton grazing may be significant.

Freshly hatched fish larvae are also plankton for a few days, as long as it takes before they can swim against currents.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Importance to fish ==
Zooplankton are the initial prey item for almost all [[fish larva]]e as they switch from their [[yolk]] sacs to external feeding. Fish rely on the density and distribution of zooplankton to match that of new larvae, which can otherwise starve.  Natural factors (e.g., current variations) and man-made factors (e.g. river dams) can strongly affect zooplankton, which can in turn strongly affect larval survival, and therefore breeding success.

The importance of both phytoplankton and zooplankton is also well-recognized in extensive and semi-intensive pond fish farming. Plankton population based pond management strategies for fish rearing have been practised by traditional fish farmers for decades, illustrating the importance of plankton even in man-made environments.

The '''Policy Analysis Market''' ('''PAM'''), part of the FutureMAP project, was a proposed [[futures exchange]] developed by the United States' [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) and based on an idea first proposed by Net Exchange, a [[San Diego]] research firm specializing in the development of online [[prediction market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://infowar.net/tia/www.darpa.mil/iao/FutureMap.htm FutureMAP project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060205010743/http://infowar.net/tia/www.darpa.mil/iao/FutureMap.htm |date=February 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposal ==

PAM was to be "a market in the future of the Middle East", and would have allowed trading of [[futures contract]]s based on possible political developments in several Middle Eastern countries. The theory behind such a market is that the monetary value of a futures contract on an event reflects the probability that that event will actually occur, since a market's actors rationally bid a contract either up or down based on reliable information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/29/politics/29TERR.html|title=THREATS AND RESPONSES: PLANS AND CRITICISMS; Pentagon Prepares A Futures Market On Terror Attacks|first=Carl|last=Hulse|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SS1" /&gt; One of the models for PAM was a political futures market run by the [[University of Iowa]], which had predicted U.S. election outcomes more accurately than either opinion polls or political [[Pundit (politics)|pundit]]s. PAM was also inspired by the work of [[George Mason University]] economist [[Robin Hanson]].&lt;ref name="SS1"&gt;{{cite web| last=Lundin|first=Leigh |title=Pam, Prism, and Poindexter| url=http://www.sleuthsayers.org/2013/07/pam-prism-and-poindexter.html |work=Spying| publisher=SleuthSayers |accessdate=January 4, 2014| date=July 7, 2013 |location=Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sirc.org/articles/policy_analysis.shtml|title=Policy Analysis Market and the Political Yuck.|website=www.sirc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opposition ==

At a July 28, 2003, press conference, [[United States Senate|Senators]] [[Byron L. Dorgan]] ([[United States Democratic Party|D]]-[[North Dakota|ND]]) and [[Ron Wyden]] ([[United States Democratic Party|D]]-[[Oregon|OR]]) claimed that PAM would allow trading in such events as ''[[coup d'état|coups d'état]]'', assassinations, and terrorist attacks, due to such events appearing on interface pictures on the project website.{{#tag:ref|"On the web site, as a backdrop to bold text, were faint background sample screens. In a small (less than 2 percent) section of two such screens, Polk had included as colorful examples of possible miscellaneous items an assassination of Yasser Arafat, a missile attack by North Korea, and the overthrow of the king of Jordan."&lt;ref name=hanson2007&gt;"[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24090026_The_Policy_Analysis_Market_A_Thwarted_Experiment_in_the_Use_of_Prediction_Markets_for_Public_Policy The Policy Analysis Market (A Thwarted Experiment in the Use of Prediction Markets for Public Policy)]", Robin Hanson, Innovations Technology Governance Globalization 2(3): pages 73-88, February 2007, DOI: 10.1162/itgg.2007.2.3.73&lt;/ref&gt;}}

They denounced the idea, with Wyden stating, "The idea of a federal betting parlor on atrocities and terrorism is ridiculous and it's grotesque," while Dorgan called it "useless, offensive and unbelievably stupid".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0729-03.htm "Pentagon Plans Online Terror Bets". BBC. July 29, 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017040530/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0729-03.htm |date=October 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics offered similar outrage. Within less than a day, [[the Pentagon]] announced the cancellation of PAM, and by the end of the week [[John Poindexter]], head of the DARPA unit responsible for developing it, but better known for his role in the [[Iran–Contra affair]], had offered his resignation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A10810-2003Jul31.html|title=Poindexter to Leave Pentagon Research Job|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the PAM had first been proposed and funded in 2001,{{#tag:ref|"DARPA's first call for proposals went out in May 2001 under the name "Electronic Market-Based Decision Support." The call basically said, "We've heard this works elsewhere; show us it works for problems we care about." Proposals were due in August, and by December two firms had won SBIR (small business independent research) grants."&lt;ref name=hanson2007/&gt;|group=note}} and Poindexter joined DARPA in December 2002. Robin Hanson claimed that Poindexter "actually had little involvement with PAM".&lt;ref name=hanson2007/&gt;

== Further developments ==

CNN reported the program would be relaunched by the private firm, Net Exchange,&lt;ref name="SS1" /&gt; which helped create it, but that the newer version "will not include any securities based on forecasts of violent events such as assassinations or terror attacks".&lt;ref name = "Middle"&gt;{{cite news

On June 11, 2007, [[Popular Science]] launched a similar program, known as the Popsci Predictions Exchange. Another project was the 'American Action Market' announced by Tad Hirsh of the [[MIT Media Lab]] in 2003, which would permit for-profit betting on major events.

There are now commercial policy analysis markets that perform this function.  One such market, [[Intrade]], had previously offered futures on events such as the capture of Osama bin Laden, the U.S. Presidential Election, and the bombing of Iran.  As of March 10, 2013, all trading had been suspended on Intrade's website due to undisclosed financial irregularities.

[[Henry Chadwick (writer)|Henry Chadwick]], a sportswriter in New York, developed the [[Box score (baseball)|box score]] in 1858.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Puerzer|first=Richard J.|year=Fall 2002|title=From Scientific Baseball to Sabermetrics: Professional Baseball as a Reflection of Engineering and Management in Society|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/24204/pdf|journal=NINE: A Journal of Baseball History and Culture|volume=11|pages=34–48|via=Project Muse}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first way statisticians were able to describe the sport of baseball.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The creation of the box score has given baseball statisticians a summary of the individual and team performances for a given game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers/detail.jsp?playerId=492558 |title=BaseballHallofFame.org |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412093802/http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers/detail.jsp?playerId=492558 |archivedate=2008-04-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[David Smith (baseball historian)|David Smith]] founded [[Retrosheet]] in 1989, with the objective of computerizing the box score of every major league baseball game ever played, in order to more accurately collect and compare the statistics of the game.

Sabermetrics research began in the middle of the 20th century.  [[Earnshaw Cook]] was one of the earliest researchers who contributed to this idea.  Cook gathered the majority of his research into his 1964 book, ''Percentage Baseball''. The book was the first of its kind to gain national media attention,&lt;ref name="albert2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Curve Ball: Baseball, Statistics, and the Role of Chance in the Game|last=Albert|first=James|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|year=2001|isbn=0-387-98816-5|pages=170–171|author2=Jay M. Bennett}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it was widely criticized and not accepted by most baseball organizations.  The idea of advanced baseball statistics did not become prominent in the baseball community until Bill James began writing his annual ''Baseball Abstracts'' in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/thinktank/transcript1197.html|title=Bill James, Beyond Baseball|date=June 28, 2005|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|accessdate=November 2, 2007|work=[[Think Tank with Ben Wattenberg]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110010232|title=Sultan of Stats|last=Ackman|first=D.|date=May 20, 2007|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=November 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill James believed that people misunderstood how the game of baseball was played, claiming that it is actually defined by the conditions under which the sport is played.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Sabermetricians, sometimes considered baseball statisticians, began trying to replace the longtime favorite statistic known as the batting average.&lt;ref name="jarvis"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://knology.net/~johnfjarvis/runs_survey.html|title=A Survey of Baseball Player Performance Evaluation Measures|last=Jarvis|first=J.|date=2003-09-29|accessdate=2007-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  It has been claimed that team batting average provides a relatively poor fit for team runs scored.&lt;ref name="jarvis" /&gt;  Sabermetric reasoning would say that runs win ballgames, and that a good measure of a player's worth is his ability to help his team score more runs than the opposing team.

Before Bill James made the concept of sabermetrics known, [[Davey Johnson]] used an [[IBM System/360]] at team owner [[Jerold Hoffberger]]'s brewery to write a [[FORTRAN]] baseball [[computer simulation]] while playing for the [[Baltimore Orioles]] in the early 1970s. He used his results in an unsuccessful attempt to promote the idea that he should bat second in the lineup to his manager [[Earl Weaver]]. He wrote [[IBM BASIC]] programs to help him manage the [[Tidewater Tides]], and after becoming manager of the [[New York Mets]] in 1984, he arranged for a team employee to write a [[dBASE II]] application to compile and store [[advanced metrics]] on team statistics.&lt;ref name="porter198405292"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZqO7wRZjZQQC&amp;pg=PA210|title=The PC Goes to Bat|date=1984-05-29|work=[[PC Magazine]] |pages=209|accessdate=24 October 2013|author=Porter, Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Craig R. Wright]] was another employee in Major League Baseball, working with the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] in the early 1980s.  During his time with the Rangers, he became known as the first front office employee in MLB history to work under the title Sabermetrician.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rotojunkie.com/index.php?art/id:10 RotoJunkie – Roto 101 – Sabermetric Glossary (powered by evoArticles)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070910212350/http://www.rotojunkie.com/index.php?art%2Fid%3A10 |date=2007-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseballspast.com/radio.htm BaseballsPast.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oakland Athletics]] began to use a more quantitative approach to baseball by focusing on sabermetric principles in the 1990s.  This initially began with [[Sandy Alderson]] as the former general manager of the team when he used the principles toward obtaining relatively undervalued players.&lt;ref name="Monebyall2"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game]]|last=Lewis|first=Michael M.|publisher=[[W. W. Norton]]|year=2003|isbn=0-393-05765-8|location=[[New York City|New York]]|authorlink=Michael Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His ideas were continued when [[Billy Beane]] took over as general manager in 1997, a job he held until 2015, and hired his assistant [[Paul DePodesta]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/06/01/RV145326.DTL|title=Billy Beane's brand-new ballgame|last=Kipen|first=D.|date=June 1, 2003|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|accessdate=November 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through the statistical analysis done by Beane and DePodesta in the 2002 season, the Oakland A's went on to win 20 games in a row. This was a historic moment for the franchise, in which the 20th game was played at the Alameda County Coliseum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Franchise Timeline|url=http://oakland.athletics.mlb.com/oak/history/timeline.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt; His approaches to baseball soon gained national recognition when [[Michael Lewis]] published ''[[Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game]]'' in 2003 to detail Beane's use of Sabermetrics.  In 2011, a film based on Lewis' book also called ''[[Moneyball (film)|Moneyball]]'' was released to further provide insight into the techniques used in the Oakland Athletics' front office.

== Traditional measurements ==
Sabermetrics was created in an attempt for baseball fans to learn about the sport through objective evidence.  This is performed by evaluating players in every aspect of the game, specifically batting, pitching, and fielding.  These evaluation measures are usually phrased in terms of either runs or team wins as older statistics were deemed ineffective.

=== Batting measurements ===
The traditional measure of batting performance is considered to be the [[batting average]].  To calculate the batting average, the number of base hits was divided by the total number of at-bats.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Bill James, along with other fathers of sabermetrics, proved this measure to be flawed as it ignores any other way a batter can reach base besides a hit.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.mathaware.org/mam/2010/essays/AlbertSabermetrics.pdf|title=Sabermetrics: The Past, the Present, and the Future|last=Albert|first=Jim|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to the creation of the [[On-base percentage]], which takes walks and hit-by-pitches into consideration. To calculate the On-Base percentage, the total number of hits + bases on balls + hit by pitch are divided by plate appearances.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Practicing Sabermetrics: Putting the Science of Baseball Statistics to work|last=Costa|first=Gabriel|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=11|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another flaw with the traditional measure of the batting average is that it will not take doubles, triples, and home runs into consideration and will give each hit the same value.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  Thus, a measure that will distinguish between these different hit outcomes, the [[slugging percentage]], was created. To calculate the slugging percentage, the total number of bases of all hits is divided by the total numbers of time at bat.  [[Stephen Jay Gould]] proposed that the disappearance of .400 batting average is actually a sign of general improvement in batting.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Triumph and Tragedy in Mudville: A Lifelong Passion for Baseball|last=Gould|first=Stephen Jay|date=2003|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=0-393-05755-0|pages=151–172|chapter=Why No One Hits .400 Anymore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danagonistes.blogspot.com/2004/08/where-have-400-hitters-gone.html|title=Where have the .400 hitters gone?|last=Agonistas|first=Dan|date=4 August 2004|access-date=30 August 2016|quote=... The discussion revolved around an essay that Gould wrote for ''Discover'' magazine in 1986 and that was reprinted both in his 1996 book ''Full House'' and in ''Triumph and Tragedy'' under the title "Why No One Hits .400 Anymore" ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This is because, in the modern era, players are becoming more focused on hitting for power than for average.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Therefore, it has become more valuable to compare players using the slugging percentage and on-base percentage over the batting average.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

These two improved sabermetric measures are important skills to measure in a batter and have been combined to create the modern statistic OPS.  [[On-base plus slugging]] is the sum of the on-base percentage and the slugging percentage.  This modern statistic has become useful in comparing players and is a powerful method of predicting runs scored from a certain player.&lt;ref name=":022"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baseball1.com/baseball-archive/sabermetrics/sabermetric-manifesto/|title=The Sabermetric Manifesto|last=Grabiner|first=David J.|work=The Baseball Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the other statistics that sabermetricians use to evaluate batting performance are [[weighted on-base average]], [[secondary average]], [[runs created]], and [[equivalent average]].

=== Pitching measurements ===
The traditional measure of pitching performance is considered to be the earned run average. It is calculated by dividing the number of [[earned run]]s allowed by the number of innings pitched and multiplying by nine because of the nine innings.  This statistic provides the number of runs that a pitcher allows per game.  It has proven to be flawed as it does not separate the ability of the pitcher from the abilities of the fielders that he plays with.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=878|title=Pitching and Defense: How Much Control Do Hurlers Have?|last=McCracken|first=Voros|date=January 23, 2001|website=Baseball Prospectus|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another classic measure for pitching is a pitcher's [[winning percentage]]. Winning percentage is calculated by dividing wins by the number of decisions (wins plus losses). This statistic can also be flawed as it is dependent on the pitcher's teammates' performances at the plate and in the field.

Sabermetricians have attempted to find different measures of pitching performance that does not include the performances of the fielders involved.  This led to the creation of [[defense independent pitching statistics]] (DIPS) system.  [[Voros McCracken]] has been credited with the development of this system in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Basco|first=Dan|last2=Davies|first2=Michael|year=Fall 2010|title=The Many Flavors of DIPS: A History and an Overview|url=|journal=Baseball Research Journal|volume=32|issue=2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through his research, McCracken was able to show that there is little to no difference between pitchers in the amount of hits they allow, regardless of their skill level.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2014/1/17/5309808/how-has-sabermetrics-changed-baseball|title=How has sabermetrics changes baseball?|last=Ball|first=Andrew|date=January 17, 2014|website=Beyond the Box Score|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Some examples of these statistics are [[Defense-Independent ERA|defense-independent ERA]], fielding independent pitching, and [[Defense-Independent Component ERA|defense-independent component ERA]].  Other sabermetricians have furthered the work in DIPS, such as [[Tom Tango]] who runs the ''Tango on Baseball'' sabermetrics website.

''[[Baseball Prospectus]]'' created another statistics called the [[peripheral ERA]].  This measure of a pitcher's performance takes hits, walks, home runs allowed, and strikeouts while adjusting for ballpark factors.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Each ballpark has different dimensions when it comes to the outfield wall so a pitcher should not be measured the same for each of these parks.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sabermetric Revolution: Assessing the Growth of Analytics in Baseball|last=Baumer|first=Benjamin|last2=Zimbalist|first2=Andrew|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|authorlink=Ben Baumer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Batting average on balls in play]] (BABIP) is another useful measurement for determining pitcher's performance.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  When a pitcher has a high BABIP, they will often show improvements in the following season, while a pitcher with low BABIP will often show a decline in the following season.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This is based on the statistical concept of [[regression to the mean]]. Others have created various means of attempting to [[Pitch Quantification|quantify individual pitches]] based on characteristics of the pitch, as opposed to runs earned or balls hit.

== Higher mathematics ==
[[Value over replacement player]] (VORP) is considered a popular sabermetric statistic. This statistic demonstrates how much a player contributes to his team in comparison to a fake replacement player that performs below average. This measurement was founded by Keith Woolner, a former writer for the sabermetric group/website ''Baseball Prospectus''.

[[Wins Above Replacement|Wins above replacement]] (WAR) is another popular sabermetric statistic that will evaluate a player's contributions to his team.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wins Above Replacement#FG-WAR|Fangraphs]]: WAR&lt;/ref&gt;   Similar to VORP, WAR compares a certain player to a replacement-level player in order to determine the number of additional wins the player has provided to his team.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/sweetspot/post/_/id/27050/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-war|title=What we talk about when we talk about WAR|last=Schoenfield|first=David|date=July 19, 2012|website=ESPN.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  WAR values vary with hitting positions and are largely determined by a player's successful performance and their amount of playing time.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Quantitative analysis in baseball ===
Many traditional and modern statistics, such as ERA and Wins Shared, don't give a full understanding of what is taking place on the field.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Practicing Sabermetrics: Putting the Science of Baseball Statistics to Work|last=John T. Saccoman, Gabriel R. Costa, Michael R. Huber|first=|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7864-4177-8|location=United States of America|pages=189–198|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simple ratios are not sufficient to understand the statistical data of baseball. Structured quantitative analysis is capable of explaining many aspects of the game, for example, to examine how often a team should attempt to [[Stolen base|steal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/the-changing-caught-stealing-calculus-2/|title=The Changing Caught-Stealing Calculus {{!}} FanGraphs Baseball|newspaper=FanGraphs Baseball|language=en-us|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Related rates in baseball ====
[[Related rates]] can be used in baseball to give exact calculations of different plays in a game. For example, if a runner is being sent home from third, related rates can be used to show if a throw from the outfield would have been on time or if it was correctly cut off  before the plate.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Related rates also can aid in determining how fast a player can get around the bases after a batted ball, information that helps in the development of scouting reports and individual player development.

==== Momentum and force ====
Momentum and force is a similar application of calculus in baseball. Particularly, the average force on a bat while hitting a ball can be calculated by combining different concepts within applied calculus. First, the change in the ball's [[Momentum]] by the external force F(t) must be calculated. The momentum can be found by multiplying the mass and velocity. The external force F(t) is a continuous function of time

== Applications ==
Sabermetrics can be used for multiple purposes, but the most common are evaluating past performance and predicting future performance to determine a player's contributions to his team.&lt;ref name=":022" /&gt;  These may be useful when determining who should win end-of-the-season awards such as MVP and when determining the value of making a certain trade.

Most baseball players tend to play a few years in the minor leagues before they are called up to the major league.  The competitive differences coupled with ballpark effects make the exact comparison of a player's statistics a problem.  Sabermetricians have been able to clear this problem by adjusting the player's minor league statistics, also known as the Minor-League Equivalency (MLE).&lt;ref name=":022" /&gt;  Through these adjustments, teams are able to look at a player's performance in both AA and AAA to determine if he is fit to be called up to the majors.

=== Applied statistics ===

Sabermetrics methods are generally used for three purposes:

1. To compare key performances among certain specific players under realistic data conditions. The evaluation of past performance of a player enables an analytic overview. The comparison of this data between players can help one understand key points such as their market values. In that way, the role and the salary that should be given to that player can be defined.

2. To provide prediction of future performance of a given player or a team. When past data is available about the performance of a team or a specific player, Sabermetrics can be used to predict the average future performances for the next season. Thus, a prediction can be made with a certain probability about the number of wins and loses.

3. To provide a useful function of the player's contributions to his team. When analyzing data, one is able to understand the contributions a player makes to the success/failure of his team. Given that correlation, we can sign or release players with certain characteristics.

=== Machine learning for predicting game outcome ===

A [[machine learning]] model can be built using data sets available at sources such as baseball-reference. This model will give probability estimates for the outcome of specific games or the performance of particular players. These estimates are increasingly accurate when applied to a large number of events over a long term. The game outcome (win/lose) is treated as having a binomial distribution. Predictions can be made using a logistic regression model with explanatory variables including: 
* Opponents runs scored, 
* Runs scored, 
* Shutouts, 
* Time at bat, 
* Winning rate.

== Recent advances ==
Many sabermetricians are still working hard to contribute to the field through creating new measures and asking new questions.  Bill James' two ''[[The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract|Historical Baseball Abstract]]'' editions and ''[[Win shares|Win Shares]]'' book have continued to advance the field of sabermetrics, 25 years after he helped start the movement.&lt;ref name="james2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/s/2002/1105/1456563.html|title=Red Sox hire James in advisory capacity|last=Neyer|first=Rob|date=November 5, 2002|accessdate=March 7, 2009|work=[[ESPN.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His former assistant [[Rob Neyer]], who is now a senior writer at ESPN.com and national baseball editor of SBNation, also worked on popularizing sabermetrics since the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/rob-neyer-interview/|title=Rob Neyer Interview|last=Jaffe|first=C.|date=October 22, 2007|work=[[The Hardball Times]]|accessdate=November 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nate Silver]], a former writer and managing partner of ''Baseball Prospectus'', invented [[PECOTA]].  This acronym stands for ''Player Empirical Comparison and Optimization Test Algorithm'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/glossary/index.php?search=PECOTA|title=Baseball Prospectus  {{!}} Glossary|website=www.baseballprospectus.com|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a sabermetric system for forecasting Major League Baseball player performance.  This system has been owned by ''Baseball Prospectus'' since 2003 and helps the website's authors invent or improve widely relied upon sabermetric measures and techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baseballprospectus.com/|title=Baseball Prospectus|accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 2007 baseball season, the MLB started looking at technology to record detailed information regarding each pitch that is thrown in a game.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  This became known as the [[PITCHf/x]] system which is able to record the speed of the pitch, at its release point and as it crossed the plate, as well as the location and angle of the break of certain pitches through video cameras.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  [[FanGraphs]] is a website that favors this system as well as the analysis of play-by-play data.  The website also specializes in publishing advanced baseball statistics as well as graphics that evaluate and track the performance of players and teams.

A '''static universe''', also referred to as a "stationary" or "infinite" or "static infinite" universe, is a [[cosmological model]] in which the universe is both spatially infinite and temporally infinite, and space is neither [[metric expansion of space|expanding]] nor contracting. Such a universe does not have so-called [[Shape of the universe|spatial curvature]]; that is to say that it is 'flat' or [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]]. A static infinite universe was first proposed by [[Thomas Digges]] (1546 .. 1595) .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Essays/Bruno.html | title  = Essay: The Folly of Giordano Bruno | first1 = Richard W. | last1  = Pogge | website = astronomy.ohio-state.edu | date = February 24, 2014 | quote = Bruno is often credited with recognizing that the Copernican system allowed an infinite Universe. In truth, the idea that a heliocentric description of the solar system allowed (or at least did not rule out) an infinite Universe was first proposed by Thomas Digges in 1576 in his ''A Perfit Description of the Caelestial Orbes'', in which Digges both presents and extends the Copernican system, suggesting that the Universe was infinite. | accessdate = 3 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to this model, [[Albert Einstein]] proposed a temporally infinite but spatially finite model as his preferred [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] during 1917, in his paper ''Cosmological Considerations in the General Theory of Relativity''.

After the discovery of the [[Hubble's law|redshift–distance relationship]] (deduced by the inverse correlation of galactic brightness to redshift) by [[Vesto Slipher]] and [[Edwin Hubble]], the astrophysicist and Roman Catholic priest [[Georges Lemaître]] interpreted the redshift as proof of universal expansion and thus a [[Big Bang]], whereas [[Fritz Zwicky]] proposed that the redshift was caused by the photons losing energy as they passed through the matter and/or forces in intergalactic space. Zwicky's proposal would come to be termed '[[tired light]]'- a term invented by the major [[Big Bang]] proponent [[Richard Tolman]].

==The Einstein universe==
During 1917, Albert Einstein added a positive [[cosmological constant]] to his [[Einstein equation|equations]] of [[general relativity]] to counteract the attractive effects of [[gravity]] on ordinary matter, which would otherwise cause a static, spatially finite universe to either [[Big Crunch|collapse]] or [[Future of an expanding universe|expand forever]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Einstein|first1=Albert|title=Kosmologische Betrachtungen zur allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie|journal=Sitzungs. König. Preuss. Akad.|date=1917|pages=Sitzungsb. König. Preuss. Akad. 142–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lorentz H.A. |author2=Einstein A. |author3=Minkowski H. |author4=H. Weyl |title=The Principle of Relativity|publisher=Metheun &amp; Co.|location=New York|date = 1923|pages=175–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Raifeartaigh et.al|title=Einstein's 1917 static model of the universe: a centennial review|journal=Eur. Phys J. (H)|date=2017|volume=42|issue=3|pages=431–474|doi=10.1140/epjh/e2017-80002-5|arxiv=1701.07261|bibcode=2017EPJH...42..431O}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This model of the universe became known as the Einstein World or [[Einstein's static universe]]. 

This motivation ended after the proposal by the astrophysicist and Roman Catholic priest [[Georges Lemaître]] that the universe seems to be not static, but expanding. [[Edwin Hubble]] had researched data from the observations made by astronomer [[Vesto Slipher]] to confirm a relationship between [[Hubble's law|redshift and distance]], which forms the basis for the modern [[Metric expansion of space|expansion paradigm]] that was introduced by Lemaître. According to [[George Gamow]] this caused Einstein to declare this cosmological model, and especially the introduction of the cosmological constant, his "biggest blunder".{{ref|greatestblunder}}

Einstein's static universe is [[closed universe|closed]] (i.e. has hyperspherical topology and positive spatial curvature), and contains uniform dust and a positive [[cosmological constant]] with value precisely &lt;math&gt;\Lambda_E = 4\pi G\rho/c^2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is Newtonian gravitational constant, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the energy density of the matter in the universe and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]].  The [[Radius of curvature (mathematics)|radius of curvature]] of space of the Einstein universe is equal to

:&lt;math&gt;R_E = \Lambda_E^{-1/2} = {c \over \sqrt{4\pi G\rho}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The Einstein universe is one of [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann's solution]]s to Einstein's field equation for dust with density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, cosmological constant  &lt;math&gt;\Lambda_E&lt;/math&gt;, and radius of curvature &lt;math&gt;R_E&lt;/math&gt;. It is the only non-trivial static solution to Friedmann's equations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Because the Einstein universe soon was recognized to be inherently unstable, it was presently abandoned as a viable model for the universe. It is unstable in the sense that any slight change in either the value of the cosmological constant, the [[matter density]], or the [[spatial curvature]] will result in a universe that either expands and accelerates forever or re-collapses to a singularity.

After Einstein renounced his cosmological constant, and embraced the Friedmann-LeMaitre model of an expanding universe&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1140/epjh/e2013-40037-6|bibcode = 2014EPJH...39...37N|title = Einstein's conversion from his static to an expanding universe|journal = European Physical Journal H|volume = 39|issue = 1|pages = 37-62|last1 = Nussbaumer|first1 = Harry|last2 = O'Keeffe|first2 = Michael|last3 = Nahm|first3 = Werner|last4 = Mitton|first4 = Simon|year = 2014|arxiv = 1311.2763}}&lt;/ref&gt;, most physicists of the twentieth century assumed that the cosmological constant is zero. If so (absent some other form of [[dark energy]]), the expansion of the universe would be decelerating. However, after [[Saul Perlmutter]], [[Brian P. Schmidt]], and [[Adam G. Riess]] introduced the theory of an [[accelerating universe]] during 1998, a positive cosmological constant has been revived as a simple explanation for [[dark energy]].

==Requirements of a static infinite model==
In order for a static infinite universe model to be viable, it must explain three things:

First, it must explain the intergalactic [[redshift]]. Second, it must explain the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. Third, it must have a mechanism to re-create matter (particularly [[hydrogen]] atoms) from radiation or other sources in order to avoid a gradual 'running down' of the universe due to the conversion of matter into energy in [[Stellar nucleosynthesis|stellar processes]].&lt;ref&gt;MacMillan, W.D. 1918.

Science 62: 63-72, 96-99, 121-127)&lt;/ref&gt; With the absence of such a mechanism, the universe would consist of dead objects such as [[black hole]]s and [[black dwarf]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7271">[[File:Leo Szilard.jpg|right|thumb|px|Leó Szilárd.]]

The '''Szilárd petition''', drafted by scientist [[Leo Szilard]], was signed by 70 scientists working on the [[Manhattan Project]] in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], and the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]].  It was circulated in July 1945 and asked President [[Harry S. Truman]] to inform Japan of the terms of surrender demanded by the allies, and allow Japan to either accept or refuse these terms, before America used atomic weapons. However, the petition never made it through the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] to President Truman. It also was not declassified and made public until 1961.

Later, in 1946, Szilard jointly with Albert Einstein, created the [[Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists]] that counted among its board, [[Linus Pauling]] ([[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1962).

== Petition excerpt ==
:[W]e, the undersigned, respectfully petition: first, that you exercise your power as Commander-in-Chief, to rule that the United States shall not resort to the use of atomic bombs in this war unless the terms which will be imposed upon Japan have been made public in detail and Japan knowing these terms has refused to surrender; second, that in such an event the question whether or not to use atomic bombs be decided by you in the light of the considerations presented in this petition as well as all the other moral responsibilities which are involved.&lt;ref name=dannen&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dannen.com/decision/45-07-17.html | title = A Petition to the President of the United States | work = Atomic Bomb: Decision, section of Leo Szilard Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
In the spring of 1945, Szilard took the petition to the man who was soon to be named Secretary of State, [[James F. Byrnes]], hoping to find someone who would pass on to President Truman the message from scientists that the bomb should not be used on a civilian population in Japan, and that after the war it should be put under international control in order to avoid a post-war arms race. Byrnes was not sympathetic to the idea at all. Szilard regretted that such a man was so influential in politics, and he appeared to also be despondent at having become a physicist, because in his career he had contributed to the creation of the bomb. After the meeting with Byrnes, he is quoted as having said, "How much better off the world might be had I been born in America and become influential in American politics, and had Byrnes been born in Hungary and studied physics."&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Roger (director) (1995). ''Hiroshima: Why the Bomb Was Dropped''. ABC News. 00:28:00~00:31:00.&lt;/ref&gt;  In reaction to the petition, General [[Leslie Groves]], the director of the Manhattan Project, sought evidence of unlawful behavior against Szilard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dannen.com/decision/lrg-fal.html| title = Groves Seeks Evidence Against Szilard, July 4, 1945 | work = Atomic Bomb: Decision, section of Leo Szilard Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the signers lost their jobs in weapons work.

The '''''Culture'' series''' is a [[science fiction]] [[book series|series]] written by Scottish author [[Iain Banks|Iain M. Banks]]. The stories centre on [[the Culture]], a [[utopia]]n, [[Post-scarcity economy|post-scarcity]] space society of [[humanoid]]s, [[extraterrestrial life|alien]]s, and very advanced [[artificial intelligence]]s living in [[socialism|socialist]] habitats spread across the [[Milky Way]] galaxy. The main theme of the novels is the dilemmas that an idealistic [[hyperpower]] faces in dealing with civilizations that do not share its ideals, and whose behavior it sometimes finds repulsive. In some of the stories, action takes place mainly in non-Culture environments, and the leading characters are often on the fringes of (or non-members of) the Culture, sometimes acting as agents of Culture (knowing and unknowing) in its plans to civilize the galaxy.

==The Culture==
{{main|The Culture}}
The Culture is a society formed by various [[humanoid]] races and [[artificial intelligence]]s about 9,000&amp;nbsp;years before the events of novels in the series. Since the majority of its biological population can have virtually anything they want without the need to work, there is little need for laws or enforcement, and the culture is described by Banks as space [[socialism]].&lt;ref name="BanksAFewNotes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown1996UtopiasAndHeterotopias"/&gt; It features a [[post-scarcity economy]]&lt;!-- the Banks source [which source? -- another editor] is explicit that it is material scarcity being represented in the series, not ordinary "scarcity" as the term is used in economics, which includes scarcity of time, or having even abundant resources always available in large amounts at every point where the humans (or humanoids) might want them. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Parsons |first=Michael |last2=Banks |first2=Iain M |title=Interview: Iain M Banks talks 'The Hydrogen Sonata' with Wired.co.uk |publisher=[[Wired UK]] |date=16 November 2012 |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-11/16/iain-m-banks-the-hydrogen-sonata-review |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6d1slP9vx?url=http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-11/16/iain-m-banks-the-hydrogen-sonata-review |archivedate=2015-11-14 |quote=It is my vision of what you do when you are in that post-scarcity society, you can completely indulge myself.

Although the Culture has more advanced technology and a more powerful economy than the vast majority of known civilizations, it is just one of the "Involved" civilizations that take an active part in galactic affairs. The much older [[Homomda]] are slightly more advanced at the time of ''Consider Phlebas'' (this is, however, set several centuries before the other books, and Culture technology and martial power continues to advance in the interim);&lt;ref name="Banks1987ConsiderPhlebasIdiranWar"/&gt; the [[List of societies of the Culture setting#Morthanveld|Morthanveld]] have a much larger population and economy, but are hampered by a more restrictive attitude to the role of AI in their society.&lt;ref name="Banks2008Matter"/&gt; The capabilities of all such societies are vastly exceeded by those of the Elder civilisations (semi-retired from Galactic politics but who remain supremely potent) and the Sublimed, entities which have abandoned their material form for a non-corporeal, multi-dimensional existence, but these generally refrain from intervention in the material world.&lt;ref name="JacksonHeilman2008OutsideContextProblems"/&gt;

Some other civilizations hold less favorable views of the Culture.&lt;ref name="Horwich2002CultureClash"/&gt; At the time of their war with the Culture, the [[Idiran]]s and some of their allies regarded the control that the Minds exercised over the Culture as a form of [[idolatry]].&lt;ref name="Brown1996UtopiasAndHeterotopias"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Banks1987ConsiderPhlebas"/&gt; The Homomda regard the Culture as idealistic and hyper-active.&lt;ref name="Banks2000LTW"/&gt; Some members of the Culture have seceded to form related civilizations, known collectively as the Ulterior. These include the Peace Faction, the AhForgetIt Tendency and the [[Zetetic Elench]]. Others simply drop out temporarily or permanently.&lt;ref name="Banks1996Excession"/&gt;

Since the Culture's biological population commonly live as long as 400&amp;nbsp;years&lt;ref name="Johnson1998ExcessionReview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfsite.com/03a/exc28.htm |title=SF Site Featured Review: Excession |last=Johnson |first=G.L. |year=1998 |accessdate=2009-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have no need to work, they face the difficulty of giving meaning to their lives when the [[Mind (The Culture)|Minds]] and other intelligent machines can do almost anything better than the biological population can.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/windward.htm |title=''Look to Windward''&amp;nbsp;– a review |last=Shoul |first=S. |accessdate=2009-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many try—few successfully—to join [[Contact (The Culture)|Contact]], the Culture's combined [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] / [[military]] / [[governmental|government]] service, and fewer still are invited to the even more elite [[Special Circumstances]] (SC), Contact's [[secret service]] and [[special operations]] division.&lt;ref name="Banks1996Excession"/&gt; Normal Culture citizens vicariously derive meaning from their existence via the works of Contact and SC. Banks described the Culture as "some incredibly rich lady of leisure who does good, charitable works... Contact does that on a large scale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.richmondreview.co.uk/features/banksint.html |title=A Quick Chat With Iain M. Banks |publisher=The Richmond Review |accessdate=2009-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same need to find a purpose for existence led the Culture as a whole to embark voluntarily on its only full-scale war, to stop the expansion of the [[theocratic]] and [[militaristic]] [[Idiran]]s—otherwise the Culture's economic and technological advancement would have been a pointless exercise in [[hedonism]].&lt;ref name="Banks1987ConsiderPhlebasIdiranWar"/&gt;

All of the stories feature the tension between the Culture's humane, [[anarcho-communist]] ideals and its need to intervene in the affairs of less enlightened and often less advanced civilisations.&lt;ref name="Brown1996UtopiasAndHeterotopias"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=C. |title=Impossibility Fiction |editor=Littlewood, D. |editor2=Stockwell, P. |publisher=Rodopi |date=September 1996 |pages=57–73 |chapter=Utopias and Heterotopias: The 'Culture' of Iain M.

In subsequent novels, the Culture—particularly SC and, to a lesser degree, Contact—continue to employ subterfuge, [[espionage]], and even [[Direct action (military)|direct action]] (collectively called "dirty tricks") in order to protect itself and spread the Culture's "good works" and ideals. These dirty tricks include blackmailing persons, employing mercenaries, recruiting [[double agent]]s, attempting to effect [[regime change]], and even engaging in [[false flag]] operations against the Culture itself (potentially resulting in the death of billions).&lt;ref name="Brown1996UtopiasAndHeterotopias" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Banks1996Excession" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Banks1988PlayerOfGames" /&gt; Though each of these individual actions would horrify the average Culture citizen, the Culture's Minds tend to justify these actions in terms of lives saved in the long-term, perhaps over the course of several hundred years. The Culture is willing to use not only preemptive, but also retaliatory actions in order to deter future hostile actions against itself. Banks commented that in order to prevent atrocities, "even the Culture throws away its usual moral rule-book."&lt;ref name="GravitasShipNames" /&gt; Andrew M. Butler noted that, "Having established the peaceful, utopian, game-playing tendencies of the Culture, ... in later volumes the Culture’s dirty tricks are more exposed."&lt;ref name="Butler2003British Boom"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Butler |first=A.M. |date=November 2003 |title=The British Boom: What boom?

The Culture stories have been described as "eerily prescient".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baker |first=N. |title=The True Knowledge of Ken MacLeod|editor=Butler, Andrew M. |editor2=Mendelsohn, F. |publisher=Science Fiction Foundation |location=Reading, UK |year=2003 |pages=95–97 |chapter=Review of Dark Light}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Consider Phlebas'' explicitly presents a [[clash of civilizations]],&lt;ref name="Duggan2007BanksPostmodernismAndGulfWar" /&gt; although this phrase was coined by [[Samuel P.

Much of ''Look to Windward'' is a commentary on the Idiran-Culture war, from a viewpoint 800&amp;nbsp;years later, mainly reflecting grief over both personal and large-scale losses and guilt over actions taken in the war. It combines these with similar reflections on the catastrophic miscarriage of the Culture's attempt to dissolve the Chelgrians' oppressive caste system. In neither case, however, does distress over the consequences of Culture policy lead its representatives to reject that policy. The book illustrates the limitations of power, and also points out that Minds and other AIs are as vulnerable as biological persons to grief, guilt and regrets.&lt;ref name="Duggan2007BanksPostmodernismAndGulfWar"/&gt;

==Place within science fiction==
{{main|Science fiction|Space opera}}
When the first Culture stories appeared, science fiction was dominated by [[cyberpunk]], a pessimistic subgenre that worried about, but offered no solutions for, the [[offshoring]] of jobs to countries with lower costs or less strict regulations, the increasing power of corporations and the threats to privacy posed by computer networks. The Culture stories are [[space opera]], with certain elements that are free from scientific realism, and Banks uses this freedom extravagantly in order to focus on the human and political aspects of his universe; he rejects the dystopian direction of present day [[capitalism]], which both cyberpunk and earlier space operas assume, in creating a communist society as the primary civilization of focus.&lt;ref name="Mendelsohn2005Excession"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mendelsohn |first=F. |title=A Companion to Science Fiction |editor=Seed, D. |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=2005 |pages=559–566 |chapter=Iain M.Banks: ''Excession'' |isbn=1-4051-1218-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HO_z5WFKwpoC&amp;pg=PP12&amp;dq=culture+%22iain+m+banks%22+ |accessdate=2009-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Space opera had peaked in the 1930s, but started to decline as magazine editors such as [[John W. Campbell]] demanded more realistic approaches. By the 1960s many space operas were satires on earlier styles, such as [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s [[Stainless Steel Rat]] and [[Bill, the Galactic Hero]] stories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Westfahl |first=G. |title=The Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction |editor=James, E. |editor2=Mendelsohn, F. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |pages=197–208 |chapter=Space opera |isbn=0-521-01657-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; while televised and film space operas such as ''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]'' were thought to have dumbed down the subgenre.&lt;ref&gt;http://whatculture.com/film/15-blunders-that-ruined-j-j-abrams-star-trek-and-destroyed-the-franchise.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/documents/introduction72.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://macha.itc.griffith.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/handle/10072/31808/59792_1.pdf?sequence=1&lt;/ref&gt; The Culture stories did much to revive space opera.&lt;ref name="Johnson1998ExcessionReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler2003British Boom"/&gt;

==Literary techniques==
Banks has been described as "an incorrigible player of games" with both style and structure&amp;nbsp;– and with the reader.&lt;ref name="HoltSFX2007Player"/&gt; In both the Culture stories and his work outside science fiction, there are two sides to Banks, the "merry chatterer" who brings scenes to life and "the altogether less amiable character" who "engineers the often savage structure of his stories".&lt;ref name="Sleight2008Matter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.locusmag.com/Features/2008/03/locus-magazines-graham-sleight-reviews.html |title=Locus Magazine's Graham Sleight reviews Iain M. Banks |last=Sleight |first=G. |date=March 2008 |publisher=Locus Magazine |accessdate=2009-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banks uses a wide range of styles. ''[[The Player of Games]]'' opens in a leisurely manner as it presents the main character's sense of boredom and inertia,&lt;ref name="Eyrie2005ReviewPlayer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/reviews/books/0-06-105356-2.html |title=Review: ''The Player of Games'' by Iain M. Banks |date=18 November 2005 |accessdate=2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adopts for the main storyline a "spare, functional" style that contrasts with the "linguistic fireworks" of later stories.&lt;ref name="HoltSFX2007Player"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holt |first=T. |date=November 2007 |title=Must-read Classic of SF Literature: ''The Player of Games'' |journal=SFX Magazine |pages=114 |url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/resources/sfx/SFX162playerofgames.pdf |accessdate=2009-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010093702/http://www.sfx.co.uk/resources/sfx/SFX162playerofgames.pdf |archivedate=October 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the styles used in ''[[Excession]]'' relate to the function and focal character of the scene: slow-paced and detailed for Dajeil, who is still mourning over traumatic events that happened decades earlier; a parody of huntin', shootin', and fishin' country gentlemen, sometimes reminiscent of [[P. G. Wodehouse]], when describing the viewpoint of the [[List of societies of the Culture setting#Affront|Affront]]; the ship ''Serious Callers Only'', afraid of becoming involved in the conflict between factions of [[Mind (The Culture)|Minds]], speaks in cryptic verse, while the ''[[Sleeper Service]]'', acting as a freelance detective, adopts a [[hardboiled]] style. On the other hand, Banks often wrong-foots readers by using prosaic descriptions for the grandest scenery, self-deprecation and humour for the most heroic actions, and a poetic style in describing one of the Affront's killings.&lt;ref name="Mendelsohn2005Excession"/&gt;

He delights in building up expectations and then surprising the reader.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Even in ''The Player of Games'', which has the simplest style and structure of the series, the last line of the epilogue reveals who was really pulling the strings all along.&lt;ref name="HoltSFX2007Player"/&gt; In all the Culture stories, Banks subverts many clichés of [[space opera]]. The Minds are not plotting to take over the universe, and no-one is following a grand plan.&lt;ref name="Mendelsohn2005Excession"/&gt; The darkly comic double-act of Ferbin and Holse in ''[[Matter (novel)|Matter]]'' is not something most writers would place in "the normally po-faced context of space opera".&lt;ref name="Sleight2008Matter"/&gt; Even the [[List_of_spacecraft_in_the_Culture_series|names of Culture spaceships]] are jokes&amp;nbsp;– for example ''Lightly Seared on the Reality Grill'', ''Experiencing a Significant Gravitas Shortfall'' (part of a [[running gag]] in the series&lt;ref name="GravitasShipNames"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepages.compuserve.de/Mostral/interviews/guardian00.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124054925/http://homepages.compuserve.de/Mostral/interviews/guardian00.htm |archivedate=24 November 2007 |accessdate=2009-02-15 |title=Iain Banks&amp;nbsp;– Interview}} Originally published in [[The Guardian]], 2000&lt;/ref&gt;) and ''Liveware Problem'' (see [[liveware]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/feb/09/fiction.iainbanks |accessdate=2009-02-15 |last=Poole. |first=S. |title=Review&amp;nbsp;– "Matter" by Iain M. Banks |date=9 February 2008 |location=London |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banks often uses "outsiders" as viewpoint characters,&lt;ref name="Vint2007Bodies"&gt;{{cite book |last=Vint |first=S. |title=Bodies of tomorrow |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2007 |pages=79–101 |chapter=3&amp;nbsp;– Iain M. Banks: The Culture-al Body|isbn=0-8020-9052-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R5PITXl1fSMC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=%22Iain+M.+Banks%22+culture+outsider |accessdate=2009-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said that using an enemy of the Culture as the main character of ''Consider Phlebas'', the first story in the series, enabled him to present a more rounded view of the Culture.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} However, this character realises that his attempts to plan for anything that might conceivably happen on a mission are very similar to the way in which the Culture makes all its decisions, and by the end suspects he has chosen the wrong side.&lt;ref name="Horwich2002CultureClash"/&gt;

The focal character of ''The Player of Games'' is bored with the lack of real challenges in his life,&lt;ref name="Horwich2002CultureClash"/&gt; is blackmailed into becoming a Culture agent, admires the vibrancy of the Azad Empire but is then disgusted by its brutality,{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} and wins the final of the tournament by playing in a style that reflects the Culture's values.&lt;ref name="Horwich2002CultureClash"/&gt;

''Use of Weapons'' features a non-Culture mercenary who accepts the benefits of association with the Culture, including immortality as the fee for his first assignment, and completes several dangerous missions as a Culture agent, but complains that he is kept in the dark about the aims of his missions and that in some of the wars he has fought maybe the Culture was backing both sides, with good reason.&lt;ref name="Horwich2002CultureClash"/&gt;

''Look to Windward'' uses three commentators on the Culture, a near-immortal Behemothaur, a member of the race plunged into civil war by a Culture intervention that went wrong, and the ambassador of a race at similar technological level to the Culture's.&lt;ref name="Gevers2000LTWReview"/&gt;

The action scenes of the Culture stories are comparable to those of blockbuster films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Palmer |first=C. |date=March 1999 |title=Galactic Empires and the Contemporary Extravaganza: Dan Simmons and Iain M. Banks |journal=Science Fiction Studies |volume=26 |issue=1 |url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/77/palmer77.htm |accessdate=2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, Banks said he would like ''[[Consider Phlebas]]'' to be filmed "with a very, very, very big budget indeed" and would not mind if the story were given a [[happy ending]], provided the biggest action scenes were kept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sffworld.com/interview/2p1.html |title=Interview with Iain M.

Banks is unspecific about many of the background details in the stories, such as the rules of the game that is the centrepiece of ''The Player of Games'',&lt;ref name="Eyrie2005ReviewPlayer"/&gt; and cheerfully makes no attempt at scientific credibility.&lt;ref&gt;"I know it's all nonsense, but you've got to admit it's impressive nonsense." {{cite web|url=http://www.futurehi.net/phlebas/text/cultnote.html |title=A Few Notes on the Culture |last=Banks |first=I.M. |year=1994 |accessdate=2009-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322183158/http://www.futurehi.net/phlebas/text/cultnote.html |archivedate=2012-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genesis of the series==
Banks says he conceived the Culture in the 1960s, and that it is a combination of wish fulfilment and a reaction against the predominantly right-wing science fiction produced in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spikemagazine.com/iain-banks-interview.php |title=Iain Banks&amp;nbsp;– Interview |last=Lowe |first=G. |date=24 March 2008 |publisher=Spike Magazine |accessdate=2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his opinion, the Culture might be a "great place to live", with no exploitation of people or AIs, and whose people could create beings greater than themselves.&lt;ref name="Gevers2002CulturedFuturist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue274/interview.html |title=Cultured futurist Iain M. Banks creates an ornate utopia |last=Gevers |first=N. |year=2002 |accessdate=2009-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002115448/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue274/interview.html |archivedate=October 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before his first published novel, ''[[The Wasp Factory]]'' (1984; not science fiction), was accepted in 1983, Banks wrote five books that were rejected, of which three were science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spikemagazine.com/0996bank.php |title=Iain Banks : ''Whit'' and ''Excession'': Getting Used To Being God |last=Mitchell |first=C. |date=3 September 1996 |publisher=Spike Magazine |accessdate=2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Banks' first draft of ''[[Use of Weapons]]'' in 1974, his third attempt at a novel, the Culture was just a backdrop intended to show that the mercenary agent was working for the "good guys" and was responsible for his own misdeeds. At the time he persuaded his friend [[Ken MacLeod]] to read it and MacLeod tried to suggest improvements, but the book had too much [[purple prose]] and a very convoluted structure. In 1984, shortly after ''The Wasp Factory'' was published, MacLeod was asked to read ''Use of Weapons'' again, and said there was "a good novel in there struggling to get out", and suggested the interleaved forwards and backwards narratives that appeared in the published version in 1990. The novella ''[[The State of the Art]]'', which provides the title of the 1991 collection, dates from 1979, the first draft of ''[[The Player of Games]]'' from 1980 and that of ''[[Consider Phlebas]]'' from 1982.&lt;ref name="Wilson1994BanksInterview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://textualities.net/tag/iain-m-banks/ |title=Iain Banks Interview |last=Wilson |first=A. |year=1994 |accessdate=2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

== Research ==

Ulrike Felt has published widely in different areas of Science, Technology, and Society. Throughout her work, questions of the public engagement with science and of science policy have been a major concern for Felt. Her work on public perception of different technologies, the organisation and reflection of different participatory events as well as on the complex relations of science and democracy has contributed in many innovative ways to the debates in STS and beyond.

An important line of her work has focused on changing modes of knowledge production within the sciences, and on how this impacts ways of working and living within research cultures. She has introduced the concept of  “epistemic living spaces” &lt;ref&gt;Felt, Ulrike (ed.) (2009): Knowing and Living in Academic Research. Convergence and Heterogeneity in Research Cultures in the European Context (Prague: Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic).&lt;/ref&gt; in order to describe how the social and epistemic are co-produced within scientific work spaces:

''"By epistemic living space, we mean researchers’ individual or collective perceptions and narrative re-constructions of the structures, contexts, rationales, actors and values which mould, guide and delimit their potential actions, both in what they aim to know as well as in how they act in social contexts in science and beyond."'' (Felt/Fochler 2010: 4f)&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencestudies.univie.ac.at/fileadmin/user_upload/dep_sciencestudies/pdf_files/Preprints/Felt_Fochler_Re-Ordering_Epistemic_V3_071011.pdf Felt, Ulrike and Fochler, Maximilian (2012) 'Re-ordering Epistemic Living Spaces: On the Tacit Governance Effects of the Public Communication of Science', in Rödder, S., Franzen, M. and P. Weingart (eds), The Sciences' Media Connection – Communication to the Public and its Repercussions. Sociology of the Sciences Yearbook 28 (Dortrecht: Springer): 133-154.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Using this concept, she has pointed to the potential implications of recent changes within career structures and the organization of the sciences for the knowledge produced within contemporary societies, focusing recently on changing temporal orders of research practices and policy.

Another line of her work has focused on how science and technology are embedded within local and national contexts. By introducing the notion of “technopolitical cultures” (Felt et al. 2010),&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencestudies.univie.ac.at/fileadmin/user_upload/dep_sciencestudies/pdf_files/Preprints/Felt_Fochler_winkler_coming_to_terms_preprint_Aug2010.pdf Felt, Ulrike, Fochler, Maximilian and Winkler, Peter (2010) 'Coming to Terms with Biomedical Technologies in Different Technopolitical Cultures. A Comparative Analysis of Focus Groups on Organ Transplantation and Genetic Testing in Austria, France, and the Netherlands', Science, Technology, &amp; Human Values 35/4: 525-553.]&lt;/ref&gt; Felt has pointed to the nationally distinct ways of how technoscience is entangled with cultural norms and values. Further, she is interested in how novel technologies like nano or genetic testing become imagined and integrated within specific local contexts. These questions are closely tied to her methodological interests. Felt and the Department of Social Studies of Science have engaged not only in the development of novel qualitative social science methods, but also in reflecting the performativity and politics of both participatory engagements and traditional socio-scientific methods.

More recently, and lying across her different research interests, she has been engaging with the role of changing temporal structures and the growing importance of future in shaping the interface of science, technology and society.

Finally, since late 2015 she is leading a new interfaculty research platform at the University of Vienna "Responsible Research and Innovation in Academic Practice".&lt;ref&gt;[http://rri.univie.ac.at/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''What Mad Pursuit: A Personal View of Scientific Discovery'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crick|first=Francis|title=What Mad Pursuit: A Personal View of Scientific Discovery|year=1988|location=New York|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|isbn=0-465-09137-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a book published in 1988 and written by [[Francis Crick]], the English co-discoverer in 1953 of the structure of [[DNA]]. In this book, Crick gives important insights into his work on the DNA structure, along with the [[Central dogma of molecular biology|Central Dogma of molecular biology]] and the [[genetic code]], and his later work on [[neuroscience]].

==Description==
The main purpose of Crick's book is to describe some of his experiences before and during the "classical period" of molecular biology from the 1953 discovery of the DNA double helix to the 1966 elucidation of the genetic code. There is a prologue outlining Crick's upbringing, education, and war work on magnetic and acoustic mines, and following World War II his decision on what branch of science to study, using the "gossip test". (Your interests are revealed by your gossip.) There is also an epilogue that outlines Crick's work after 1966, his move to the [[Salk Institute]] with his career transition to neuroscience concentrating on visual consciousness in primates, and some of his conclusions regarding research in theoretical biology, especially with regard to the brain sciences.

Crick comments on various aspects of the DNA double helix discovery and gives a qualified endorsement to the 1987 television movie [[Life Story (TV film)|''Life Story'']] with [[Jeff Goldblum]] as [[James Watson|Jim Watson]] and [[Tim Pigott-Smith]] as Francis Crick. There is a clear presentation of the basic ideas of molecular biology with appendices "A Brief Outline of Classical Molecular Biology" and "The Genetic Code." Crick gives some anecdotes and explains some important ideas and insights without too much technical jargon.

According to the Nobel prize-winning physicist [[Philip W. Anderson]], the basic goal of experimental science is "learning the truth about the world around us. Crick's words are as good a guide to that end as I have seen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anderson PW|title=Some thoughtful words (not mine) on research strategy for theorists|journal=[[Physics Today]]|date=Feb 1990|volume=43|issue=2|page=9|doi=10.1063/1.2810433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"This is a book to be read more than once; the beauty of its style masks much hard science and subtle thought. In spite of having heard it many times from others, the story of DNA as told by Crick still makes a marvelous read. A sense of clarity of thought combined with an equally strong sense of commitment and overlaid with the deep power of his thinking runs through the book. One sees that Crick possesses that all-important but dismayingly elusive knack of distinguishing what is significant from what is not. His confidence in the power of structural chemistry to unravel the functioning of biological molecule is unflagging. At the same time, warning signals sound constantly to keep possible evolutionary arbitrariness in mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nanjundiah, Vidyanand |title=What Mad Pursuit: BOOK REVIEW|journal=[[J.

'''William Henry Harvey''', FRS FLS (5 February 1811 – 15 May 1866) was an Irish [[botanist]] and phycologist who specialised in [[algae]].

== Biography ==
Harvey was born at Summerville near [[Limerick]], Ireland, in 1811, the youngest of 11 children. His father Joseph Massey Harvey, was a [[Quaker]] and prominent merchant.&lt;ref&gt;http://limerickslife.com/harveys-quay/&lt;/ref&gt; William started his education at Ballitore School in [[County Kildare]] and by the age of 15 had already established algae as his over-riding interest.&lt;ref name="Papenfuss 76"&gt;'''Papenfuss, G.F.''' 1976. pp.21–46. Landmarks in Pacific North American Marine Phycology. ''in'' Abbott, I.A. and Hollenberg, G.J. 1976. ''Marine Algae of California''. Stanford University Press, California. {{ISBN|0-8047-0867-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving school he joined the family business.

Harvey was an authority on algae and [[bryophyte]]s ([[mosses]]), and author of ''A Manual of the British Algae'' (1841), ''Phycologia Britannica'' (4 vols., 1846–51), ''Nereis Boreali-Americana.'' (3 parts 1852–85) and ''[[Phycologia Australica]]'' (5 vol., 1858–63).&lt;ref&gt;http://users.ugent.be/phycology/harvey&lt;/ref&gt; He spent several years in South Africa, and was the author, with German botanist [[Otto Wilhelm Sonder]], of the ''Flora Capensis'' (7 vol. in 11, 1859 – 1933). Harvey's main algal [[herbarium]] is located at [[Trinity College, Dublin]].

Harvey's discovery in 1831 of the [[moss]] ''Hookeria laetevirens'' at [[Killarney]], new to Ireland, led to a lifelong friendship with Sir [[William Jackson Hooker]], who was then [[Regius Professor]] of [[Botany]] at [[Glasgow University]]. Hooker recognised the talent of the young man and lent him books and specimens. Soon afterwards Hooker invited him to contribute the section on algae to his ''British Flora'' (1833) as well as the section on algae for ''The Botany of Captain Beechy's Voyage''.

In 1835 Harvey went to South Africa aboard the vessel "Carnatic", with his brother Joseph who had been mistakenly nominated as Colonial Treasurer by [[Thomas Spring Rice, 1st Baron Monteagle of Brandon|Thomas Spring Rice]] instead of William. When Joseph's health failed in the following year, William took over his duties. They left for Britain together on 14 April 1836 and Joseph died on the voyage.

Back in Cape Town, and now officially Treasurer-General, William took up residence at Bishop's Court, rising before dawn every day, collecting in the mountains or sea-shore, and working on the plants at night. In March 1837 he wrote: 'I have taken so many excursions lately that I almost fear I shall earn the sobriquet of Her Majesty's pleasurer general'. In the same year he enlisted the services of botanical collector [[Carl Ludwig Philipp Zeyher|Karl Zeyher]], who was in [[Uitenhage]], to collect specimens. He developed a close friendship with [[Baron von Ludwig]] who had started his famous gardens in Cape Town, and dedicated his ''Genera of South African Plants'' to him. Under the patronage of Sir George Grey and with the assistance of a team of collectors and of Otto Wilhelm Sonder, he set about writing a ''Flora Capensis'' in English – he lived long enough to see the first three volumes completed and published in Dublin, the third in 1865. He came home in 1842, having resigned his position due to illness.

In 1844 Harvey became curator of the [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] Herbarium (TCD)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tcd.ie/Botany/herbarium.html&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1848 Professor of Botany of the [[Royal Dublin Society]].

In 1853 he made a three-year voyage, visiting South Africa, [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]], Australia, [[New Zealand]], Tonga, [[Fiji]], and [[Chile]]. On his return he published further important books dealing with the botany of North America and South Africa and in 1858 was appointed Professor of Botany at [[Trinity College, Dublin]].

He died from [[tuberculosis]] on 15 May 1866 at [[Torquay]] and was buried there.&lt;ref name="Guiry, M.D. 2010"/&gt;

==Botanic Works==
As a result of the publication of his 1858 book, ''The genera of South African plants'', in which he asked South African readers to send him specimens so that he could begin documenting the [[flora]] of the Cape, he began a correspondence with [[Mary Elizabeth Barber]], an amateur naturalist who lived in [[Cape Colony]].&lt;ref name=ladies/&gt; Their ongoing correspondence took place during a time when it was not generally accepted for women to engage in scientific discussion;&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen |first=Alan |year=2000 |title=Mary Elizabeth Barber: South Africa's first lady natural historian |journal=Archives of Natural History |issue=27 |pages=187–208 |doi=10.3366/anh.2000.27.2.187 |issn=0260-9541}}&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, in the beginning Barber did not disclose the fact that she was a woman.&lt;ref name=ladies&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hjAvK_5V1FEC&amp;pg=PA9 |pages=9–12|title=Ladies in the Laboratory III: South African, Australian, New Zealand, and Canadian Women in Science – Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries|first1=Mary R.

Harvey described over 750 species and in excess of 75 genera of algae.&lt;ref name="Guiry, M.D. 2010"&gt;Guiry, M.D., Boalch, G.T. and Peters, A.F. 2010. William Henry Harvey's Grave Rediscovered. ''The Phycologist''. Number 79: 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;

His ''Phycologia Britannica'' was published in 1846–1851 and his publication of ''Nereis Australis Or Algae of the Southern Ocean'' (1847–49) along with other publications established his reputation. His ''[[Phycologia Australica]]'' represents one of the most important books on [[phycology]] in the 19th century. Published in five volumes between 1858 and 1863 it is the result of his extensive collecting on the Australian shores.

By the time Harvey set foot in Western Australia he had already established himself as a leading phycologist having published several large works. He earned the title: "father of Australian Phycology". He was elected as a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=14&amp;dsqSearch=%28%28text%29%3D%27harvey%27%29|title= Fellows details|publisher= Royal Society|accessdate= 23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
About 600 specimens from Ireland, [[Ceylon]], [[Friendly Islands]], Australia and [[Tasmania]] collected by Harvey are in store in the [[Ulster Museum]] [[Herbarium]] (BEL), almost 90 of which are in the 5th volume of the [[William Thompson (naturalist)|William Thompson]] collection in the Ulster Museum, catalogue numbers: F8848–F8937. However his primary collection is still in the TCD Herbarium attached to Botany School building of [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]]. There are also collections of Harvey's specimens in: The former Botany Department of [[University College, Cork]], Ireland; West Chester, Pennsylvania, USA; [[National Herbarium of Victoria]] (MEL), Melbourne, Australia; National Herbarium of New South Wales (NSW), Sydney, Australia and the Herbarium of St. Andrews University (STA).

In Harvey's era naturalists often relied upon the exchanging of specimens with other scientists and contributions by amateur collectors. His 1841 ''Manual of the British Algae'' was dedicated to British beachcomber, [[Amelia Griffiths]]. In his ''Phycologia Britannica'' Harvey often notes the  "distribution" of each species giving the name of the collector who reported the record. In the ''Preface'' of Vol. 1 he lists 19 people to whom he is indebted. These include: Rev. Mr. Pollexfen and Dr. McBain for [[Orkney]] algae, the others are: Rev. Mr.Hore, Dr.Cocks, Mr. Rohloff, Mr. Boswarva, Miss White, Miss Magdalene Turner, Miss Warren, Miss (Anne) Ball, Miss (Isabella) Gifford (1823?–1891)(4), Miss Cutler (1), Mrs Gatty (1809–1873), Mrs Gulson (?–1871)(5), Mrs Hayden, Rev. Dr. Landsborough, Dr. Dickie (2), Mr. [[John Ralfs|Ralfs]] and Mr. Cresswell. Others noted in volume 1 include: Mr. Winch, Mr. McCalla (c.1814–1849)(3), Mr. Wigg, Mr. Borrer, Miss Hutchins, Mr. [[John Templeton (Botanist)|John Templeton]], Mr. T.N.Cole, Rev. Mr. Clouston, Rev. H. Davies (Mr.) Stackhouse, Mrs. Ovens, Mr. W. Backhouse, James [[Patrick Neill (naturalist)|Dr. P. Neill]] and others. Harvey recognised Magdalene Turner's help named ''Cladophora magdalenae'' Harv. in her honour. Harvey also honoured [[Susan Fereday (botanical artist)|Susan Fereday's]] contribution to his work by naming the species ''[[Dasya feredayae]]'' and ''[[Nemastoma feredayae]]'' after her.&lt;ref name="Norton2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norton|first1=Leonie|title=Women of Flowers: Botanical Art in Australia from the 1830s to the 1960s|date=2009|publisher=National Library of Australia|location=Canberra|isbn=9780642276834|pages=48–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other collectors==

[[George Clifton (plant collector)|George Clifton]] (1823–1913) Mr G. Clifton is mentioned in Harvey's Memoirs, as the Superintendent of the Water Police in Perth, West Australia whose boat Harvey used when collecting in Fremantle (Blackler, 1977).&lt;ref name="Blackler 77"&gt;'''Blackler, H.''' 1977. Harvey's Australian Algae in the Herbarium of Mrs, Margaret Gatty in the Department of Botany of the University of St Andrew's (STA), Scotland. ''Taxon'' '''26''': 495–496&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his specimens are in the Ulster Museum Herbarium: BEL: F2195; F2196 from "W.Australia."

[[Ronald Campbell Gunn]] (1808–1881) Harvey's specimens in the Ulster Museum are from George Town. The handwriting has been determined by Dr H. B. S. Womersley (1980): F2256; F2242; F2083; F2081 and others.

Harvey was an honorary M.D. of [[Dublin University]] (1844) and F.R.S. (1858). His portrait is in the [[National Gallery of Ireland]], Dublin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22935">The '''World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB)''' is an international [[soil classification]] system for naming soils and creating legends for soil maps. The currently valid version is the Update 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/i3794en/I3794en.pdf|title=World Reference Base for Soil Resources 2014, Update 2015|last=IUSS Working Group WRB|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the third edition 2014. It is edited by a working group of the [[International Union of Soil Sciences]] (IUSS).

== History ==
Since the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, several countries developed national [[soil classification]] systems. During the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, the need for an international soil classification system became more and more obvious. 

From 1971 to 1981, the Food and Agriculture Organization ([[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]]) and [[UNESCO|UNESCO]] published the [[Soil Map of the World]], 10 volumes, scale 1 : 5 M. The Legend for this map, published in 1974 under the leadership of Rudi Dudal, became the [[FAO soil classification]]. Many ideas from national soil classification systems were brought together in this worldwide-applicable system, among them the idea of diagnostic horizons as established in the ‘7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; approximation to the [[USDA soil taxonomy]]’ from 1960. The next step was the Revised Legend of the Soil Map of the World, published in 1988.

In 1982, the International Soil Science Society (ISSS; now: [[International Union of Soil Sciences]], IUSS) established a working group named International Reference Base for Soil Classification (IRB)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iuss.boku.ac.at/files/iuss126_def_72dpi.pdf|title=IUSS Bulletion 126, page 38-45|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Chair of this working group was Ernst Schlichting. Its mandate was to develop an international soil classification system that should better consider soil-forming processes than the FAO soil classification. Drafts were presented in 1982 and 1990.

In 1992, the IRB working group decided to develop a new system named World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB) that should further develop the Revised Legend of the [[FAO soil classification]] and include some ideas of the more systematic IRB approach. Otto Spaargaren ([[International Soil Reference and Information Centre]]) and Freddy Nachtergaele ([[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]]) were nominated to prepare a draft. This draft was presented at the 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; [[World Congress of Soil Science]] in Acapulco in 1994. At the same congress, the WRB was established as an ISSS working group replacing the IRB. At the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; World Congress of Soil Science in Montpellier in 1998, the first edition of the WRB was published. At the same congress, the ISSS endorsed the WRB as its correlation system for soil classification. (In 2014, the [[USDA soil taxonomy]] also received the status of a correlation system.) At the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; World Congress of Soil Science in Philadelphia in 2006, the second edition of the WRB was presented, and at the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; World Congress of Soil Science in Jeju in 2014, the third edition. An update of the third edition was issued in 2015. Whereas the second edition was only suitable for naming soils, the third edition can additionally be used for creating map legends.

The WRB has only two hierarchical levels (see below) and has in that sense a similar approach as the French référencial pédologique (1992, 1995, 2008). Contrary to that, the [[USDA soil taxonomy]] is strongly hierarchical and has six levels. The classification in WRB is based mainly on soil morphology (field and laboratory data) as an expression of [[pedogenesis]]. Another difference with USDA soil taxonomy is that soil climate is regarded only as a soil-forming factor and not as a soil characteristic. The WRB is not meant to replace national soil classification systems, which, for their area, may be more detailed than the WRB.

== The editor of the WRB ==
The WRB is edited by a working group&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iuss.org/index.php?article_id=42|title=List of the IUSS working groups|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[International Union of Soil Sciences]] (IUSS).

== The WRB 2015 ==

=== The architecture of the WRB ===
The classification is based on '''diagnostic horizons''', '''diagnostic properties''' and '''diagnostic materials''', altogether called '''diagnostics'''. Diagnostic materials are materials that significantly influence soil-forming processes ([[pedogenesis]]). They are either inherited from the parent material or the result of soil-forming processes. Diagnostic properties are typical results of soil-forming processes or reflect specific conditions of soil formation. Diagnostic horizons are typical results of soil-forming processes that show a minimum thickness and therefore a horizontal appearance. 

The diagnostics have names (e. g. argic horizon, stagnic properties, fluvic material), The WRB does not use horizons symbols (A horizons, B horizons). Therefore, horizons that are not diagnostic, do not have names. Instead, WRB recommends using the horizon symbols provided by the FAO Guidelines for Soil Description (2006). 

The classification comprises two levels: 

The first level has 32 '''Reference Soil Groups''' (RSGs).

At the second level, for further differentiation a set of '''qualifiers''' is added to the name of the RSG. There are 185 qualifiers in total. For every RSG, there is a list of available qualifiers, which are subdivided into two types: 

* '''Principal qualifiers''' describe typical characteristics of a RSG. They are ranked and given in an order of importance. They are placed before the name of the RSG.
* '''Supplementary qualifiers''' describe additional characteristics. They are not ranked and used in alphabetical order. They are placed after the name of the RSG in brackets and separated from each other by commas.

The names of the RSGs and the qualifiers start with capital letters. They must be given in English and must not be translated into any other language in order to guarantee that a certain soil has the same name all over the world. 

=== Naming a soil with the WRB ===
A key is used for allocating a soil to a certain RSG. In a defined sequence, the key asks for the presence or absence of certain diagnostics in a certain depth range. In addition, the key asks for single characteristics, e. g., a certain clay content or a certain base saturation. The soil belongs to the first RSG, for which it fulfils the set of criteria.

The qualifiers available for use with a particular RSG are listed in the key, along with the RSG. Their number is from 35 to 68. All applying qualifiers must be added to the soil name. The principal qualifiers are added before the name of the RSG. The sequence is from right to left, i.e. the uppermost qualifier in the list is placed closest to the name of the RSG. The supplementary qualifiers are added in brackets after the name of the RSG and are separated from each other by commas. The sequence is from left to right, i.e. the first qualifier according to the alphabet is placed closest to the name of the RSG. If no other principal qualifier applies, the Haplic qualifier is used. If two or more qualifiers in the list are separated by a slash (/) only one of them can be used. The slash signifies that these qualifiers are either mutually exclusive (e.g. Dystric and Eutric) or one of them is redundant with the redundant qualifier(s) listed after the slash(es). In the soil name, supplementary qualifiers are always placed in the order of the alphabet, even if their position in the list differs from alphabetical sequence due to the use of the slash. It is a general rule that qualifiers conveying redundant information are not used. Example: If a soil has the Calcaric qualifier (carbonates present) the Eutric qualifier (high base saturation) is not used.

Qualifiers may be combined with specifiers (e.g. Epi-, Proto-) to form subqualifiers (e.g. Epiarenic, Protocalcic). The depth-related specifiers are of special importance, although their use is optional:

* Epi-: only from 0 to ≤50 cm,
* Endo-: only below &gt;50 cm,
* Amphi-: only from &gt;0 to &lt;100 cm,
* Ano-: only from 0 to &gt;50 and &lt;100 cm,
* Kato-: only from &gt;0 to ≥100 cm
* Panto-: from 0 to ≥100 cm

=== Creating map legends with the WRB ===
The number of qualifiers used in a map legend depends on the scale. The WRB distinguishes four map scale levels: 

* first map scale level: RSG only,
* second map scale level: the RSG plus the first applying principal qualifier,
* third map scale level: the RSG plus the first two applying principal qualifiers,
* fourth map scale level: the RSG plus the first three applying principal qualifiers.

Correlating the map scale levels with concrete scales (e.g. fourth map scale level from 1 : 250 000 to 1 : 1 000 000) is difficult because selecting a map scale level depends very much from the homogeneity/heterogeneity of the landscape.

The principal qualifiers are added before the name of the RSG following the rules explained for naming a soil. Depending on the purpose of the map or according to national traditions, at any scale level, further qualifiers may be added optionally. They may be additional principal qualifiers from further down the list and not already used in the soil name, or they may be supplementary qualifiers. They are placed using the above-mentioned rules for supplementary qualifiers; principal qualifiers first, then supplementary qualifiers.

The WRB recommends that on a map unit not just one soil is indicated but an association of soils. For this purpose, WRB uses the following nomenclature: 

* dominant: the soil represents &gt;50 % of the soil cover,
* codominant: the soil represents 25 - 50 % of the soil cover,
* associated: the soil represents 5 - 25 % of the soil cover. 

For codominant and associated soils, it is allowed to use less principal qualifiers than would correspondent to the used map scale level. The use of specifiers is not recommended due to the generalization that is required when making maps. In map legends, the names of the RSGs are given in plural; in all other cases they are given in singular. 

=== The WRB Manual ===
The WRB Manual comprises five chapters and four annexes. 

Chapter 1 reports on background and basics. It includes tables of the diagnostic horizons and of the RSGs. The latter is given below. Chapter 2 provides the rules for classifying soils and creating map legends. It is highly recommended to read this short chapter before using the WRB. Chapter 3 presents the diagnostic horizons, properties and materials, each with a general description, the diagnostic criteria and some additional information. For the decision, whether a diagnostic is present or absent in a soil, only the diagnostic criteria are relevant. Chapter 4 provides the key to the RSGs and for every RSG a list with the available principal and supplementary qualifiers. Chapter 5 gives the definitions of the qualifiers. These five chapters are concluded with a list of references. 

They are followed by four annexes. Annex 1 briefly describes the 32 RSGs. Annex 2 lists the laboratory methods. This is only a list; it is not a laboratory manual. Annex 3 gives the codes for the RSGs, the qualifiers and the specifiers and the rules for the sequence of the codes for naming soils and creating map legends. Annex 4 provides a texture triangle, in which the ranges of the texture-related qualifiers are marked with different grey shades.

== Examples ==

=== Example for naming a soil with the WRB ===
Our example soil has the following characteristics: 

Field characteristics: A soil developed from [[loess]] shows a marked clay increase in around 60 cm depth and clay coatings in the clay-richer horizon. According to the landscape setting, we presume that high-activity clays dominate. In the field, a pH value of 6 is measured in the subsoil. The lower part of the clay-poorer topsoil is bleached. In the clay-richer horizon, we observe a mottling; the oximorphic and the reductimorphic colours sum up to 30% of the exposed area, the intensive colours in the interiors of the aggregates. In spring time, reducing conditions occur. The soil is ploughed regularly. Organic matter concentrations in the topsoil are small.

Laboratory characteristics: The laboratory analyses confirm the high [[Cation-exchange capacity|cation exchange capacity]] per kg clay in the clay-richer horizon and the high base saturation in the subsoil. In the topsoil, we find 20% [[clay]], 10% [[sand]] and 70% [[silt]], in the subsoil 35% clay, 10% sand and 55% silt. 

The naming of the soil consists of four steps. 

'''Question 1: Does the soil have diagnostic horizons, properties and materials?''' 

The soil has the following diagnostics: 

* albic material (in the bleached horizon)
* argic horizon (clay-richer horizon)
* stagnic properties (in the clay-richer horizon)
* reducing conditions (in the clay-richer horizon)

'''Question 2: To which RSG does the soil belong?''' 

We have to go through the key RSG for RSG. This soil is not a Histosol, not an Anthrosol, not a Technosol etc. Finally, we end up with the [[Luvisols]]. This is the first RSG in the key, the criteria of which our soil completely fulfils. 

'''Question 3: Which qualifiers apply?''' 

From the list of the principal qualifiers, Stagnic (stagnic properties und reducing conditions) and Albic (light colours) apply. Stagnic is found further up in the list. Therefore, the soil has to be named up till now Albic Stagnic Luvisol. From the list of the supplementary qualifiers, Siltic (silty from 0 to 60 cm), Loamic (loamy from 60 cm downwards), Aric (ploughed), Cutanic (clay coatings) und Ochric (small concentrations of organic carbon) apply. Bringing the supplementary qualifiers into the alphabetical order, the soil is an Albic Stagnic Luvisol (Aric, Cutanic, Loamic, Ochric, Siltic). 

'''Question 4: Which specifiers can be used to form subqualifiers?''' 

The soil is Siltic from 0 to 60 cm and Loamic from 60 cm downwards. We can use the depth-related specifiers Ano- and Endo- to construct the subqualifiers Anosiltic and Endoloamic. The stagnic properties occur only in the subsoil and the albic material only around 50 cm. This means that we can use the subqualifiers Endostagnic and Amphialbic. 

Now, the soil name is: Amphialbic Endostagnic Luvisol (Aric, Cutanic, Endoloamic, Ochric, Anosiltic). 

Using the codes of Annex 3 of the WRB Manual gives us the following short name: LV-stn.abm-ai.ct.lon.oh.sia. 

=== Example for creating map legends with the WRB ===
Let’s say that our example soil Amphialbic Endostagnic [[Luvisol]] (Aric, Cutanic, Endoloamic, Ochric, Anosiltic) covers 60% of the area of a map unit. The other 40% are covered by a Eutric Endoluvic Amphialbic [[Stagnosol]] (Humic, Endoloamic, Anosiltic). The map unit will be named as follows: 

First map scale level: 

* dominant: Luvisols
* codominant: Stagnosols

Second map scale level: 

* dominant: Stagnic Luvisols
* codominant: Albic Stagnosols

Third map scale level: 

* dominant: Albic Stagnic Luvisols
* codominant: Luvic Albic Stagnosols

Fourth map scale level: 

* dominant: Albic Stagnic Luvisols
* codominant: Eutric Luvic Albic Stagnosols

Remarks: The use of the depth-related specifiers is not recommended in map legends, where generalization is required. The fourth scale level would allow three principal qualifiers, but the dominant soil in our example has only two. 

At every scale level, optional qualifiers may be added. If one wants to give information about organic carbon, one can do that even at the first map scale level and write: 

* dominant: Luvisols (Ochric)
* codominant: Stagnosols (Humic)

If somebody wants to give additional information on soil genesis, this can also be done on the first map scale level: 

* dominant: Luvisols (Stagnic)
* codominant: Stagnosols (Luvic)

Both in combination would read, e. g., at the second map scale level: 

* dominant: Stagnic Luvisols (Ochric)
* codominant: Albic Stagnosols (Luvic, Humic)
