'''Adyghe''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|d|ᵻ|ɡ|eɪ}} or {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɑː|d|ᵻ|ˈ|ɡ|eɪ}};&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Adyghe}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ady|Адыгабзэ|Adygabzæ}} {{IPA-ady|aːdəɣaːbza|}}),{{fix|text=lacks stress|date=September 2017}} also known as '''West Circassian''' ({{lang|ady|КӀахыбзэ}}, ''K’axybzæ''), is one of the two official languages of the [[Adygea|Republic of Adygea]] in the [[Russian Federation]], the other being [[Russian language|Russian]]. It is spoken by various tribes of the [[Adyghe people]]: [[Abadzekh|Abzekh]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://lacito.vjf.cnrs.fr/archivage/languages/Abzakh.htm Abzakh dialect] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adamey]], [[Bzhedug]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://lacito.vjf.cnrs.fr/archivage/languages/Bjedug.htm Bzhedug dialect] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hatuqwai]], [[Temirgoy]], [[Mamkhegh]], [[Natukhai people|Natekuay]], [[Shapsugs|Shapsug]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://lacito.vjf.cnrs.fr/archivage/languages/Shapsug.htm Shapsoug dialect] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228042439/http://lacito.vjf.cnrs.fr/archivage/languages/Shapsug.htm |date=2010-12-28 }} {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zhaney]] and [[Yegerikuay]], each with its own dialect. The language is referred to by its speakers as ''Adygebze'' or ''Adəgăbză'', and alternatively transliterated in [[English language|English]] as ''Adygean'', ''Adygeyan'' or ''Adygei''. The literary language is based on the [[Temirgoy]] dialect.

There are apparently{{Clarify|date=June 2015}} around 128,000 speakers of Adyghe in Russia, almost all of them native speakers. In total, some 300,000 speak it worldwide. The largest Adyghe-speaking community is in [[Turkey]], spoken by the post [[Russo-Circassian War|Russian–Circassian War]] (circa 1763–1864) diaspora; in addition to that, the Adyghe language is spoken by the [[Cherkesogai]] in [[Krasnodar Krai]].

Adyghe belongs to the family of [[Northwest Caucasian languages]]. [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] (also known as East Circassian) is a very close relative, treated by some as a dialect of Adyghe or of an overarching [[Circassian language]]. [[Ubykh language|Ubykh]], [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]] and [[Abaza language|Abaza]] are somewhat more distantly related to Adyghe.

The language was standardised after the [[October Revolution]] in 1917. Since 1936, the [[Cyrillic script]] has been used to write Adyghe. Before that, an [[Arabic script|Arabic-based alphabet]] was used together with the [[Latin script|Latin]]. In recent years, use of the Latin script has seen a resurgence, particularly among Circassian Nationalists. Originally unstandardised, all dialects of Adyghe are now included in the ICSLO (Indigenous Caucasian Standard  Latin Orthography), providing a standardised Latin script that is gaining popularity. (The ICSLO treats [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] as a dialect of Adyghe, so Kabardian-exclusive consonants such as the [[labiodental ejective fricative]] are also represented in its Adyghe Latin script.)

== Phonology ==
{{Main article|Adyghe phonology}}
Adyghe exhibits a large number of consonants: between 50 and 60 consonants in the various Adyghe dialects. All dialects possess a contrast between plain and labialized [[glottal stop]]s. A very unusual minimal contrast, and possibly unique to the [[Abzakh Adyghe dialect|Abzakh dialect]] of Adyghe, is a three-way contrast between plain, [[labialized]] and [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] [[glottal stop]]s (although a palatalized glottal stop is also found in [[Hausa language|Hausa]]). The [[Black Sea]] dialect of Adyghe contains a very uncommon sound: a [[bidental consonant|bidental]] [[voiceless bidental fricative|fricative {{IPA|[h̪͆]}}]], which corresponds to the [[voiceless velar fricative]] {{IPA|[x]}} found in other varieties of Adyghe.

# &lt;b&gt;Note: Adyghe has many consonants that appear in dialects other than those mentioned above or in the table, and has a complex system of consonant allophony. More information on those can be found at [[Adyghe phonology|Adyghe phonology]]. &lt;/b&gt;

In contrast to its large consonant inventory, Adyghe has only three phonemic vowels in a [[vertical vowel system]].

== Grammar ==
{{Main article|Adyghe grammar}}
Adyghe, like all Northwest Caucasian languages, has a basic [[agent–object–verb]] typology, and is characterised by an [[ergative–absolutive language|ergative]] construction of the sentence.

=== Labialised consonants ===

Гу [ɡʷ], Гъу [ʁʷ], Дзу [d͡zʷ], Ку [kʷ], Къу [qʷ], КIу [kʷʼ], ПIу [pʷʼ], ТIу [tʷʼ], Хъу [χʷ], Цу [t͡sʷ], Шъу [ʃʷ], ШIу [ʃʷʼ], Iу [ʔʷ].

In some dialects : Кхъу [q͡χʷ], Ху [xʷ], Чъу [t͡ɕʷ].

=== Writing system rules ===

* The letter {{angle bracket|ы}} {{IPA|[ə]}} is not written after a {{angle bracket|у}} {{IPA|[w]}}, {{angle bracket|й}} {{IPA|[j]}} or a labialised consonant. For example, : унэ {{IPA|[wəna]}} "house" instead of уынэ, илъэс {{IPA|[jəɬas]}} "year" instead of йылъэс, шӏу {{IPA|[ʃʷʼə]}} "well" instead of шӏуы, цумпэ {{IPA|[t͡sʷəmpa]}} "strawberry" instead of цуымпэ.
* In case the letter {{angle bracket|у}} is the first letter of a word or when is not related to any other consonant, it is pronounced as [wə] {{angle bracket|уы}}. For example, : унэ [wəna] "house" instead of уынэ, урыс [wərəs] "Russian" instead of уырыс, куу [kʷəwə] "deep" instead of кууы. When it's related to a consonant it becomes a vowel and pronounced as [əw]~[u] {{angle bracket|ыу}}. For example, : чэту [t͡ʃaːtəw] "cat" instead of чэтыу, бзу [bzəw] "bird" instead of бзыу, дуней [dəwnej] "world" instead of дыуней.
* In case a labialised consonant is followed by a vowel {{angle bracket|э}} [a], instead of the letter {{angle bracket|у}} there is a {{angle bracket|о}}. For example, : гъогу [ʁʷaɡʷ] "road" instead of гъуэгу, машӏо [maːʃʷʼa] "fire" instead of машӏуэ, шъо [ʃʷa] "you (plural)" instead of шъуэ.
* In case a labialised consonant is followed by a vowel {{angle bracket|а}} [aː] or {{angle bracket|и}} [i/əj], the labialised consonant letter is written fully. for example : цуакъэ [t͡sʷaːqa] "shoes", гуащэ [ɡʷaɕa] "princes", шъуи [ʃʷəj] "yours (plural).
* In case the letter {{angle bracket|о}} is the first letter of a word or when is not related to any other consonant, it is pronounced as [wa] {{angle bracket|уэ}}. For example : о [wa] "you" instead of уэ, орэд [warad] "song" instead of уэрэд, онтэгъу [wantaʁʷ] "heavy" instead of уэнтэгъу, зао [zaːwa] "war" instead of зауэ, ныо [nəwa] "old woman" instead of ныуэ.
* In case the letter {{angle bracket|е}} is the first letter of a word or when is not related to any other consonant, it is pronounced as [ja] {{angle bracket|йэ}}. For example, : еӏо [jaʔʷa] "he says" instead of йэӏо, еплъы [japɬə] "he sees" instead of йэплъы, мые [məja] "apple" instead of мыйэ, бае [baːja] "rich" instead of байэ, шъэжъые [ʂaʐəja] "knife" instead of шъэжъыйэ. When it's related to a consonant it becomes a vowel and pronounced as [aj]~[e] {{angle bracket|эй}}. For example, : делэ [dajla] "fool" instead of дэйлэ, къедж [qajd͡ʒ] "read" instead of къэйдж, непэ [najpa] "today" instead of нэйпэ.
* In case the letter {{angle bracket|и}} is the first letter of a word or when is not related to any other consonant, it is pronounced as [jə] {{angle bracket|йы}}. For example, : илъэс [jəɬas] "year" instead of йылъэс, иунэ [jəwəna] "his house" instead of йыуын, шӏои [ʃʷʼajə] "dirty" instead of шӏойы, дэи [dajə] "bad" instead of дэйы. When it's related to a consonant it becomes a vowel and pronounced as [əj]~[i] {{angle bracket|ый}}. For example, : сиӏ [səjʔ] "I have" instead of сыйӏ, уиунэ [wəjwəna] "your house" instead of уыйуынэ, къины [qəjnə] "hard" instead of къыйны.

=== Vowels ===
The vowels are written {{angle bracket|ы}} {{IPA|[ə]}}, {{angle bracket|э}} {{IPA|[a]}} and {{angle bracket|а}} {{IPA|[aː]}}.

Other letters represent diphthongs: {{angle bracket|я}} represents {{IPA|[jaː]}}, {{angle bracket|и}} {{IPA|[jə]}} or {{IPA|[əj]}}, {{angle bracket|о}} {{IPA|[wa]}} or {{IPA|[o]}}, {{angle bracket|у}} represent {{IPA|[u]}} or {{IPA|[w]}} or {{IPA|[wə]}} and {{angle bracket|е}} represents {{IPA|[aj]}} or {{IPA|[ja]}}.

== Writing systems ==
Modern Adyghe uses a [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]] alphabet with the addition of the letter {{angle bracket|Ӏ}} ([[palochka]]). Previously, [[Arabic script|Arabic]] (before 1927) and [[Latinisation (USSR)|Latin]] (1927–38) [[alphabet]]s had been used.

Adyghe is taught outside [[Circassia]] in a [[Jordan|Jordanian]] school for the Jordanian Adyghes, Prince Hamza Ibn Al-Hussein Secondary School in the capital [[Amman]]. This school, which was established by the Adyghe Jordanians with support from the late [[king of Jordan|king]] [[Hussein of Jordan]], is one of the first schools for the Adyghe communities outside Circassia. It has around 750 Jordanian Adyghe students, and one of its major goals is to preserve Adyghe among newer Adyghe generations, while also emphasising the traditions of the Adyghes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |title=Circassians bid to save ancient language |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bmh1Ehyq0o |date=14 May 2010 |publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] |accessdate=29 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adyghe is spoken by [[Circassians in Iraq]] and by [[Circassians in Israel]], where it is taught in schools in their villages. It is also spoken by many [[Circassians in Syria]], although the majority of Syrian Circassians speak [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]].

== Publications ==
The New Testament and many books of the Old Testament have been published in Adyghe in Cyrillic script by the Institute for Bible Translation in  Moscow.

Translation: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not.

AppTek's primary focus is on automatic [[speech recognition]] (ASR), [[machine translation]] (MT), [[Natural language processing|NLP]], [[machine learning]] and [[artificial intelligence]]. AppTek acquired AIXPLAIN in 2004, thereby adding a [[Statistical machine translation|statistical]] engine. The neural MT engine covers many language pairs.&lt;ref&gt;Boretz, Adam, [http://www.speechtechmag.com/Articles/News/News-Feature/AppTek-Launches-Hybrid-Machine-Translation-Software-52871.aspx/ "AppTek Launches Hybrid Machine Translation Software"] retrieved 14 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Current bidirectional language pairs include [[English language|English]] with [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], and unidirectional pairs from [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]] into English.

AppTek has been involved in automatic speech recognition since the acquisition of AIXPLAIN, covering broadcast voice and conversational telephony in various languages and dialects. Current ASR languages include English, Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Pashto, [[Persian language|Persian]], Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Turkish and Urdu.

==History==
AppTek was founded in 1990 by Mohammad Shihadah and Mudar Yaghi.  Acquired in 1998 by [[Lernout &amp; Hauspie]] (at the time a NASDAQ publicly traded company), AppTek organized a management buy-out and went private again in 2001.

Armenia was a monolingual country by the 2nd century BC at the latest.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, Geographica, XI, 14, 5; Հայոց լեզվի համառոտ պատմություն, Ս. Ղ. Ղազարյան։ Երևան, 1981, էջ 33 (Concise History of Armenian Language, S. Gh. Ghazaryan. Yerevan, 1981, p. 33).&lt;/ref&gt; Its language has a long literary history, with a 5th-century Bible translation as its oldest surviving text. Its vocabulary has historically been influenced by [[Middle Iranian languages|Western Middle Iranian languages]], particularly [[Parthian language|Parthian]], and to a lesser extent by Greek, [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. There are two standardized modern literary forms, [[Eastern Armenian]] and [[Western Armenian]], with which most contemporary dialects are [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adalian|first=Rouben Paul|title=Historical Dictionary of Armenia|year=2010|publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]]|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=978-0-8108-7450-3|authorlink=Rouben Paul Adalian|p=396|quote=Although mutually intelligible, eastern Armenian preserved classical phonology, whereas western Armenian demonstrated sound loss among closely related consonants.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baliozian|first1=Ara|authorlink1=Ara Baliozian|title=The Armenians: Their History and Culture|date=1975|publisher=Kar Publishing House|page=65|quote=There are two main dialects: Eastern Armenian (Soviet Armenia, Persia), and Western Armenian (Middle East, Europe, and America) .

Although the Armenians were known to history much earlier (for example, they were mentioned in the 6th century BC [[Full translation of the Behistun Inscription|Behistun Inscription]] and in [[Xenophon]]'s 4th century BC history, ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|The Anabasis]]''),&lt;ref&gt;"Armenia as Xenophon Saw It", p. 47, ''A History of Armenia''. Vahan Kurkjian, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; the oldest surviving Armenian-language text is the 5th century AD [[Bible]] translation of [[Mesrop Mashtots]], who created the [[Armenian alphabet]] in 405, at which time it had 36 letters. He is also credited by some with the creation of the [[Caucasian Albanian alphabet]]. In ''The Anabasis'', Xenophon describes many aspects of Armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 BC. He relates that the Armenian people spoke a language that to his ear sounded like the language of the [[Persian people|Persians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=[[Xenophon]]|title=[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]|pages=IV.v.2–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early contacts===
W. M. Austin (1942) concluded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Austin |first=William M. |title=Is Armenian an Anatolian Language? |publisher=Linguistic Society of America |date=January–March 1942 |pages=22–25 |doi=10.2307/409074 |journal=Language |volume=18 |issue=1 |jstor=409074}}&lt;/ref&gt; that there was an early contact between Armenian and [[Anatolian languages]], based on what he considered common archaisms, such as the lack of a feminine gender and the absence of inherited long vowels. However, unlike shared innovations (or ''[[synapomorphy|synapomorphies]]''), the common retention of archaisms (or ''[[symplesiomorphy]]'') is not considered conclusive evidence of a period of common isolated development.

In 1985, Soviet linguist [[Igor M. Diakonoff]] noted the presence in [[Classical Armenian]] of what he calls a "Caucasian substratum" identified by earlier scholars, consisting of loans from the [[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]] and [[Northeast Caucasian languages]].&lt;ref name=Diakonoff1985&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://archive.org/stream/Hurro-urartianBorrowingsInOldArmenian#page/n1/mode/1up |title=Hurro-Urartian Borrowings in Old Armenian |work=Journal of the American Oriental Society |date=1985 |pages=597–603 |first=I.&amp;nbsp;M. |last=Diakonoff |author-link=Igor M. Diakonoff |location=New&amp;nbsp;Haven |volume=105 |issue=4 |doi=10.2307/602722 |issn=0003-0279 |jstor=602722 |oclc=6015257905}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that [[Hurro-Urartian languages|Hurro-Urartian-speaking]] peoples inhabited the Armenian homeland in the second millennium BC, Diakonov identifies in Armenian a Hurro-Urartian substratum of social, cultural, and animal and plant terms such as ''[[wikt:աղախին|ałaxin]]'' "slave girl" ( ← Hurr. ''al(l)a(e)ḫḫenne''), ''cov'' "sea" ( ← Urart. ''ṣûǝ'' "(inland) sea"), ''ułt'' "camel" ( ← Hurr. ''uḷtu''), and ''[[wikt:խնձոր|xnjor]]'' "apple(tree)" ( ← Hurr. ''ḫinzuri''). Some of the terms he gives admittedly have an [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] or [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] provenance, but he suggests they were borrowed through Hurrian or Urartian. Given that these borrowings do not undergo [[sound change]]s characteristic of the development of Armenian from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], he dates their borrowing to a time before the written record but after the [[Proto-Armenian language]] stage.

Loan words from [[Iranian languages]], along with the other ancient accounts such as that of Xenophon above, initially led linguists to erroneously classify Armenian as an Iranian language. Scholars such as [[Paul de Lagarde]] and F. Müller believed that the similarities between the two languages meant that Iranian and Armenian were the same language.&lt;ref name="iranicaonline.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/armenia-iv|title=ARMENIA AND IRAN iv. Iranian influences in Armenian Language|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinctness of Armenian was recognized when philologist [[Heinrich Hübschmann]] (1875)&lt;ref name="iranicaonline.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/books/read12.html |title=A Reader in Nineteenth Century Historical Indo-European Linguistics: On the Position of Armenian in the Sphere of the Indo-European Languages |publisher=Utexas.edu |date=2007-03-20 |accessdate=2012-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430121231/http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/books/read12.html |archivedate=2012-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; used the [[comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]] to distinguish two layers of Iranian words from the older Armenian [[vocabulary]]. He showed that Armenian often had 2 morphemes for the one concept, and the non-Iranian components yielded a consistent [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] pattern distinct from Iranian, and also demonstrated that the inflectional morphology was different from that in Iranian languages.

===Graeco-Armenian hypothesis===
{{Main article|Graeco-Armenian}}

The hypothesis that Greek is Armenian's closest living relative originates with [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]] (1924), who noted that the number of Greek-Armenian lexical cognates is greater than that of agreements between Armenian and any other Indo-European language. [[Antoine Meillet]] (1925, 1927) further investigated morphological and phonological agreement, postulating that the parent languages of Greek and Armenian were dialects in immediate geographical proximity in the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European period]]. Meillet's hypothesis became popular in the wake of his ''Esquisse'' (1936). [[Georg Renatus Solta]] (1960) does not go as far as postulating a Proto-Graeco-Armenian stage, but he concludes that considering both the lexicon and morphology, Greek is clearly the dialect most closely related to Armenian. [[Eric P. Hamp]] (1976, 91) supports the Graeco-Armenian thesis, anticipating even a time "when we should speak of Helleno-Armenian" (meaning the postulate of a Graeco-Armenian proto-language). Armenian shares the [[Augment (linguistics)|augment]], and a negator derived from the set phrase [[Proto-Indo-European language]] {{PIE|*''ne h₂oyu kʷid''}} ("never anything" or "always nothing"), and the representation of word-initial [[laryngeal theory|laryngeals]] by prothetic vowels, and other phonological and morphological peculiarities with Greek. Nevertheless, as Fortson (2004) comments, "by the time we reach our earliest Armenian records in the 5th century AD, the evidence of any such early kinship has been reduced to a few tantalizing pieces".

===Greco-Armeno-Aryan hypothesis===
{{main article|Graeco-Aryan}}

Graeco-(Armeno)-Aryan is a hypothetical [[clade]] within the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European family]], ancestral to the [[Greek language]], the Armenian language, and the [[Indo-Iranian languages]].  Graeco-Aryan unity would have become divided into [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]] and [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]] by the mid-third millennium BC. Conceivably, [[Proto-Armenian language|Proto-Armenian]] would have been located between Proto-Greek and Proto-Indo-Iranian, consistent with the fact that Armenian shares certain features only with Indo-Iranian (the ''[[satem]]'' change) but others only with Greek (''s'' &gt; ''h'').

Graeco-Aryan has comparatively wide support among Indo-Europeanists for the [[Proto-Indo-European Urheimat hypotheses|Indo-European homeland]] to be located in the [[Armenian Highlands]], the "[[Armenian hypothesis]]".&lt;ref&gt;Renfrew, A.C., 1987, ''Archaeology and Language: The Puzzle of Indo-European Origins'', London: Pimlico. {{ISBN|0-7126-6612-5}}; [[Tamaz V.

Bammesberger in ''The Cambridge History of the [[English language|English Language]]'', 1992, {{ISBN|978-0-521-26474-7}}, p. 32: the model "still remains the background of much creative work in Indo-European reconstruction" even though it is "by no means uniformly accepted by all scholars".&lt;/ref&gt; Early and strong evidence was given by Euler's 1979 examination on shared features in Greek and Sanskrit nominal flection.&lt;ref&gt;Indoiranisch-griechische Gemeinsamkeiten der Nominalbildung und deren indogermanische Grundlagen (= Aryan-Greek Communities in Nominal Morphology and their Indoeuropean Origins; in German) (282 p.), Innsbruck, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

Used in tandem with the Graeco-Armenian hypothesis, the Armenian language would also be included under the label '''Aryano-Greco-Armenic''', splitting into proto-Greek/Phrygian and "Armeno-Aryan" (ancestor of Armenian and [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]]).&lt;ref name="p. 6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="public.iastate.edu"/&gt;

==Evolution==
[[File:Manuscript arm 5-6AD.jpg|left|thumb|Armenian manuscript, 5th–6th century.]]

[[Classical Armenian]] (Arm: ''grabar''), attested from the 5th century to the 19th century as the literary standard (up to the 11th century also as a spoken language with different varieties), was partially superseded by [[Middle Armenian]], attested from the 12th century to the 18th century. Specialized literature prefers "Old Armenian" for ''grabar'' as a whole, and designates as "Classical" the language used in the 5th century literature, "Post-Classical" from the late 5th to 8th centuries, and "Late Grabar" that of the period covering the 8th to 11th centuries. Later, it was used mainly in religious and specialized literature, with the exception of a revival during the early modern period, when attempts were made to establish it as the language of a literary renaissance, with neoclassical inclinations, through the creation and dissemination of literature in varied genres, especially by the [[Mekhitarists]]. The first Armenian periodical, ''Azdarar'', was published in ''grabar'' in 1794.

The classical form borrowed numerous words from [[Iranian languages#Middle Iranian languages|Middle Iranian languages]], primarily [[Parthian language|Parthian]],&lt;ref name="Diakonoff597"&gt;''Hurro-Urartian Borrowings in Old Armenian'', I. M. Diakonoff, '''Journal of the American Oriental Society''', Vol. 105, No. 4 (Oct. - Dec., 1985), 597.&lt;/ref&gt; and contains smaller inventories of [[loanword]]s from Greek,&lt;ref name="Diakonoff597" /&gt; Syriac,&lt;ref name="Diakonoff597" /&gt; Arabic,&lt;ref&gt;''How Did New Persian and Arabic Words Penetrate the Middle Armenian Vocabulary?

An effort to modernize the language in [[Bagratid Armenia]] and the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] (11–14th centuries) resulted in the addition of two more characters to the alphabet ("{{lang|hy|օ}}" and "{{lang|hy|ֆ}}"), bringing the total number to 38.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ouzounian|first1=Nourhan|editor1-last=Hacikyan|editor1-first=Agop Jack|editor2-last=Basmajian|editor2-first=Gabriel|editor3-last=Franchuk|editor3-first=Edward S.|editor4-last=Ouzounian|editor4-first=Nourhan| display-editors = 3|title=The heritage of Armenian literature|year=2000|publisher=Wayne State Univ. Press|location=Detroit|isbn=0814328156|page=88|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uvA-oV0alP8C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Book of Lamentations'' by [[Gregory of Narek]] (951–1003) is an example of the development of a literature and writing style of Old Armenian by the 10th century. In addition to elevating the literary style and vocabulary of the Armenian language by adding about well above a thousand new words,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mirzoyan |first=H. |date=2005 |title=Նարեկացու բառաշխարհը |trans-title=Narekatsi's World of Words |language=Armenian |journal=Banber Erewani Hamalsarani |volume=1 |issue=115 |pages=85–114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; through his other hymns and poems Gregory paved the way for his successors to include secular themes and vernacular language in their writings. The thematic shift from mainly religious texts to writings with secular outlooks further enhanced and enriched the vocabulary. “A Word of Wisdom”, a poem by Hovhannes Sargavak devoted to a starling, legitimizes poetry devoted to nature, love, or female beauty. Gradually, the interests of the population at large were reflected in other literary works as well. Konsdantin Yerzinkatsi and several others even take the unusual step of criticizing the ecclesiastic establishment and addressing the social issues of the Armenian homeland. However, these changes represented the nature of the literary style and syntax, but they did not constitute immense changes to the fundamentals of the grammar or the morphology of the language. Often, when writers codify a spoken dialect, other language users are then encouraged to imitate that structure through the literary device known as [[parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Švejcer|first=Aleksandr D.|title=Contemporary Sociolinguistics: Theory, Problems, Methods|year=1986|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|location=Amsterdam/Philadelphia|isbn=9027215189|page=70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TQhCAAAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, the traditional Armenian homeland was once again divided. This time [[Eastern Armenia]] was conquered from [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Iran]] by the [[Russian Empire]], while [[Western Armenia]], containing two thirds of historical Armenia, remained under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] control. The antagonistic relationship between the Russian and Ottoman empires led to creation of two separate and different environments under which Armenians lived and suffered. Halfway through the 19th century, two important concentrations of Armenian communities were further consolidated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Khachaturian|first1=Lisa|title=Cultivating nationhood in imperial Russia the periodical press and the formation of a modern Armenian identity|year=2009|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick, N.J.|isbn=1412813727|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0uY_tuRcx8C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of persecutions or the search for better economic opportunities, many Armenians living under Ottoman rule gradually moved to [[Constantinople]], whereas [[Tbilisi]] became the center of Armenians living under Russian rule. These two cosmopolitan cities very soon became the primary poles of Armenian intellectual and cultural life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Krikor Beledian|authorlink1=Kara-Darvish and Armenian Futurism|editor1-last=Berghaus|editor1-first=Günter|title=International Yearbook of Futurism|year=2014|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG|isbn=3110334100|page=264|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nQPpBQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of new literary forms and styles, as well as many new ideas sweeping Europe, reached Armenians living in both regions. This created an ever-growing need to elevate the vernacular, Ashkharhabar, to the dignity of a modern literary language, in contrast to the now-anachronistic Grabar. Numerous dialects existed in the traditional Armenian regions, which, different as they were, had certain morphological and phonetic features in common. On the basis of these features two major standards emerged:
* Western standard: The influx of immigrants from different parts of the traditional Armenian homeland to Constantinople crystallized the common elements of the regional dialects, paving the way to a style of writing that required a shorter and more flexible learning curve than Grabar.
* Eastern standard: The [[Yerevan dialect]] provided the primary elements of Eastern Armenian, centered in Tbilisi, Georgia. Similar to the Western Armenian variant, the Modern Eastern was in many ways more practical and accessible to the masses than Grabar.

Both centers vigorously pursued the promotion of Ashkharhabar. The proliferation of newspapers in both versions (Eastern &amp; Western) and the development of a network of schools where modern Armenian was taught, dramatically increased the rate of literacy (in spite of the obstacles by the colonial administrators), even in remote rural areas. The emergence of literary works entirely written in the modern versions increasingly legitimized the language’s existence. By the turn of the 20th century both varieties of the one modern Armenian language prevailed over Grabar and opened the path to a new and simplified grammatical structure of the language in the two different cultural spheres. Apart from several morphological, phonetic, and grammatical differences, the largely common vocabulary and generally analogous rules of grammatical fundamentals allows users of one variant to understand the other as long as they are fluent in one of the literary standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waters|first1=Bella|title=Armenia in pictures|year=2009|publisher=VGS/Twenty-First Century Books|location=Minneapolis|isbn=0822585766|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BFN6SuymI00C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War I]], the existence of the two modern versions of the same language was sanctioned even more clearly. The [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (1920–1990) used Eastern Armenian as its official language, whereas the diaspora created after the [[Armenian Genocide]] preserved the Western Armenian dialect.

===Modern changes===
[[File:Panneau près d'Ohanavan.JPG|thumb|Armenian language road sign.]]
The two modern literary dialects, Western (originally associated with writers in the Ottoman Empire) and Eastern (originally associated with writers in the Russian Empire), removed almost all of their [[Turkic loanwords in Armenian|Turkish lexical influences]] in the 20th century, primarily following the [[Armenian Genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x9KoAkzfVqIC&amp;lpg=PA315&amp;dq=armenian%20lexical%20purification&amp;pg=PA315#v=onepage&amp;q=purified&amp;f=false|title=Progress in language planning: International Perspectives|last=Cobarrubias|first=Juan|last2=Fishman|first2=Joshua A.|publisher=Mouton Publishers|year=1983|isbn=902793388X|location=Berlin|pages=315, 319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
[[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] voiceless [[stop consonants]] are aspirated in the [[Proto-Armenian language]], one of the circumstances that is often linked to the [[glottalic theory]], a version of which postulated that the voiceless occlusives of Proto-Indo-European were aspirated.&lt;ref&gt;James Clackson, ''Indo-European Linguistics, An Introduction'' (2007, Cambridge)&lt;br/&gt;Robert S.P. Beekes, ''Comparative Indo-European Linguistics, An Introduction'' (1995, John Benjamins)&lt;br/&gt;Oswald J.L. Szemerényi, ''Introduction to Indo-European Linguistics'' (1996, Oxford)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stress===
In Armenian, the stress falls on the last syllable unless the last syllable contains the definite article {{IPA|[ə]}} or {{IPA|[n]}}, and the possessive articles {{lang|hy|ս}} and {{lang|hy|դ}}, in which case it falls on the penultimate one. For instance, [[wikt:ախորժակ|{{IPA|[ɑχɔɾˈʒɑk]}}]], [[wikt:մաղադանոս|{{IPA|[mɑʁɑdɑˈnɔs]}}]], [[wikt:գինի|{{IPA|[giˈni]}}]] but [[wikt:Վահագն|{{IPA|[vɑˈhɑgən]}}]] and [[wikt:դաշտը|{{IPA|[ˈdɑʃtə]}}]]. Exceptions to this rule are some words with the final letter {{lang|hy|է}} ({{lang|hy|ե}} in the reformed orthography) ({{lang|hy|մի՛թէ, մի՛գուցե, ո՛րեւէ}}) and sometimes the ordinal numerals ({{lang|hy|վե՛ցերորդ, տա՛սներորդ}}, etc.), as well as {{lang|hy|նաեւ, նամանաւանդ, հիմա, այժմ}}, and a small number of other words.

===Vowels===
{{Armenians}}
Modern Armenian has six monophthongs. Each vowel phoneme in the table is represented by three symbols. The first indicates the phoneme's pronunciation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).  After that appears the corresponding letter of the Armenian alphabet. The last symbol is its Latin transliteration (according to ISO 9985).

===Consonants===
The following table lists the Eastern Armenian consonantal system. The occlusives and [[affricate consonant|affricates]] have a special aspirated series (transcribed with an [[apostrophe]] after the letter): ''p’'', ''t’'', ''c’'', ''k’'' (but ''č''). Each phoneme in the table is represented by three symbols. The first indicates the phoneme's pronunciation in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA), after that appears the corresponding letter of the [[Armenian alphabet]], and the last symbol is its [[Romanization of Armenian#ISO 9985 (1996)|Romanization according to ISO 9985 (1996)]].

# Sources differ on the place of articulation of these consonants.

The major phonetic difference between dialects is in the reflexes of Classical Armenian [[voice-onset time]]. The seven dialect types have the following correspondences, illustrated with the t–d series:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Price|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphology==

Armenian corresponds with other Indo-European languages in its structure, but it shares distinctive sounds and features of its grammar with neighboring [[languages of the Caucasus|languages of the Caucasus region]]. Armenian is rich in combinations of consonants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kortmann|first=Bernd|last2=van der Auwera|first2=Johan|title=The Languages and Linguistics of Europe: A Comprehensive Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vi_VCm51kpkC|year=2011|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3110220261|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Armenia, Vol. 11-12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3nLnAAAAMAAJ&amp;|year=1919|publisher=New Armenia Publishing Company|isbn=1248372786|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both classical Armenian and the modern spoken and literary dialects have a complicated system of noun declensions, with six or seven noun cases but no gender. In modern Armenian, the use of auxiliary verbs to show tense (comparable to will in "he will go") has generally supplemented the inflected verbs of [[Classical Armenian]]. Negative verbs are conjugated differently from positive ones (as in English "he goes" and "he does not go") in many tenses, otherwise adding only the negative {{lang|hy|չ}} to the positive conjugation. Grammatically, early forms of Armenian had much in common with classical [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]], but the modern language, like modern Greek, has undergone many transformations, adding some [[analytic language|analytic]] features.

===Noun===
Classical Armenian has no [[grammatical gender]], not even in the pronoun, but there is a feminine suffix ({{lang|hy|-ուհի}} "-uhi"). For example, {{lang|hy|ուսուցիչ}} (''usuts'ich'', "teacher") becomes {{lang|hy|ուսուցչուհի}} (''usuts'chuhi'', female teacher). This suffix, however, does not have a grammatical effect on the sentence. The nominal inflection, however, preserves several types of inherited stem classes. Nouns are declined for one of seven cases: [[nominative case|nominative]] (ուղղական ''uxxakan''), [[accusative case|accusative]] (հայցական ''hayc'akan''), [[locative case|locative]] (ներգոյական ''nergoyakan''), [[genitive case|genitive]] (սեռական ''seṙakan''), [[dative case|dative]] (տրական ''trakan''), [[ablative case|ablative]] (բացառական ''bac'aṙakan''), or [[instrumental case|instrumental]] (գործիական ''gorciakan'').

===Verb===
{{Main article|Armenian verbs}}

Verbs in Armenian have an expansive system of [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] with two main verb types in Eastern Armenian and three in Western Armenian changing form based on [[Grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]] and [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]].

==Dialects==
{{See also|Classification des dialectes arméniens}}
[[File:Armenian dialects, Adjarian 1909.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Map of the [[Historical dialects of Armenian|Armenian dialects in early 20th century]]:
{{legend|#00FF00|-owm dialects, nearly corresponding to Eastern Armenian}}
{{legend|#808080|-el dialects (intermediate)}}
{{legend|#FFD800|-gë dialects, nearly corresponding to Western Armenian}}]]
Armenian is a [[pluricentric language]], having two modern [[Standard language|standardized]] forms: [[Eastern Armenian]] and [[Western Armenian]]. The most distinctive feature of Western Armenian is that it has undergone several phonetic mergers; these may be due to proximity to Arabic- and Turkish-speaking communities.

For example, Eastern Armenian speakers pronounce ({{lang|hy|թ}}) as [tʰ], ({{lang|hy|դ}}) as [d], and ({{lang|hy|տ}}) as a [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]] occlusive [t˭]. Western Armenian has simplified the occlusive system into a simple division between voiced occlusives and aspirated ones; the first series corresponds to the tenuis series of Eastern Armenian, and the second corresponds to the Eastern voiced and aspirated series. Thus, the Western dialect pronounces both ({{lang|hy|թ}}) and ({{lang|hy|դ}}) as [tʰ], and the ({{lang|hy|տ}}) letter as [d].

There is no precise linguistic border between one dialect and another because there is nearly always a dialect transition zone of some size between pairs of geographically identified dialects.

Armenian can be divided into two major dialectal blocks and those blocks into individual dialects, though many of the Western Armenian dialects have become extinct due to the effects of the Armenian Genocide. In addition, neither dialect is completely homogeneous: any dialect can be subdivided into several subdialects. Although Western and Eastern Armenian are often described as different dialects of the same language, many subdialects are not readily mutually intelligible. Nevertheless, a fluent speaker of one of two greatly varying dialects who is also literate in one of the standards, when exposed to the other dialect for a period of time will be able to understand the other with relative ease.

Distinct Western Armenian varieties currently in use include [[Homshetsi dialect|Homshetsi]], spoken by the [[Hemshin people]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Victor A. Friedman|editor1-last=Ball|editor1-first=Martin J.|title=The Routledge Handbook of Sociolinguistics Around the World: A Handbook|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415422789|page=128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AtCNAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA128 |chapter=Sociolinguistics in the Caucasus}}&lt;/ref&gt; the dialects of Armenians of [[Kessab]] ([[:hy:Քեսաբի բարբառ|Քեսապի բարբառ]]), [[Latakia]] and [[Jisr al-Shughur]] (Syria), [[Anjar, Lebanon]], and [[Vakıflı, Samandağ]] (Turkey), part of the "Sueidia" dialect ([[:hy:Սվեդիայի բարբառ|Սուէտիայի բարբառ]]).

Forms of the [[Karin dialect]] of Western Armenian are spoken by several hundred thousand people in Northern Armenia, mostly in [[Gyumri]], [[Artik]], [[Akhuryan]], and around 130 villages in [[Shirak Province]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baghdassarian-Thapaltsian|first=S.

[[Nakhichevan-on-Don]] Armenians speak another Western Armenian variety based on the dialect of [[Armenians in Crimea]], where they came from in order to establish the town and surrounding villages in 1779 ([[:hy:Նոր Նախիջևանի բարբառ|Նոր Նախիջևանի բարբառ]]).

Western Armenian dialects are currently spoken also in [[Gavar]] (formerly Nor Bayazet and Kamo, on the west of [[Lake Sevan]]), [[Aparan]], and [[Talin, Armenia|Talin]] in Armenia ([[Mush dialect]]), and by the large Armenian population residing in [[Abkhazia]], where they are considered to be the first or second ethnic minority, or even equal in number to the local Abkhaz population&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/islam-tekushev/unlikely-home|title=An unlikely home|author=Islam Tekushev|publisher=[[openDemocracy]]|date=5 January 2016|access-date=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthography==
{{main article|Armenian alphabet|Armenian braille}}
[[File:Keyboard Layout Armenian.png|thumb|Armenian [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] layout using the [[Armenian alphabet]].]]
The [[Armenian alphabet]] ({{lang-hy|Հայոց գրեր|translit=Hayots grer}} or {{lang-hy|Հայոց այբուբեն|translit=Hayots aybuben}}) is a graphically unique [[alphabet]]ical writing system that is used to write the Armenian language. It was introduced around AD 405 by [[Mesrop Mashtots]], an Armenian linguist and ecclesiastical leader, and originally contained 36 letters. Two more letters, օ (o) and ֆ (f), were added in the Middle Ages. 
During the [[Armenian orthography reform of 1922–1924|1920s orthography reform]] in Soviet Armenia, a new letter և (capital ԵՎ) was added, which was a ligature before ե+ւ, whereas the letter Ւ ւ was discarded and reintroduced as part of a new letter ՈՒ ու (which was a digraph before). This alphabet and associated orthography is used by most Armenian speakers of the Republic of Armenia and the countries of the former Soviet Union. Neither the alphabet nor the orthography has been adopted by Diaspora Armenians, including Eastern Armenian speakers of Iran and all Western Armenian speakers, who keep using the traditional alphabet and spelling.

==Indo-European cognates==
Armenian is an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]], so many of its [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]-descended words are [[cognate]]s of words in other Indo-European languages such as [[English language|English]], [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Sanskrit]]. This table lists only some of the more recognizable cognates that Armenian shares with English (more specifically, with English words descended from [[Old English]]).

The '''Azerbaijani Wikipedia''' ({{lang-az|{{#property:P1448}}}}) is a Wikipedia in [[Azerbaijani language]] (the [[Wikipedia#Editing model|editing interface]] and the main page have been temporarily accessible via [[South Azeri language|South Azerbaijani]] subtitles), launched in January 2002.&lt;ref name="az.wp oldid=1"&gt;http://az.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?oldid=1&lt;/ref&gt; As of 30 November 2010 it had 42,518 articles ([[List of Wikipedias#List|size]] 4, including 20 [[Wikipedia:Featured articles|featured articles]]) and 14,523 uploaded files in its content, as well as 23,766 registered users (including seven [[Wikipedia:Administrators|administrators]] and two [[Wikipedia:Bureaucrats|bureaucrats]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://az.wikipedia.org/wiki/X%C3%BCsusi:Statistika|title=Statistika|publisher=Vikipediya|accessdate=30 November 2010|language=az}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editorial process is being supported by forty [[Internet bot|bot]]s.

Within the first two years of its existence the article number in Azerbaijani Wikipedia reached 3,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code.az/wikipedia-indi-de-azerbaycanca/|title=Wikipedia – İndi də Azərbaycanca|publisher=Code.az|accessdate=30 November 2010|language=az}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2010 the local list of requested articles contains ten entries (seven biographical, two scientific and one unspecified). Pending November 2010 translation requests comprise three English and three Turkish entries.

The [[Wikipedia:Categorization|categorization]] is maintained through nine topic categories: culture, geography, history, life, mathematics, nature, science, society and technology. [[Wikipedia:Categorization#Hiding categories|Hidden categories]] embrace 111 entries. The backlog category contains 14 subcategories. {{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

There are also fourteen [[Wikipedia:Portal|portals]] about architecture, biology, chemistry, history, Islam, geography, literature, medicine, philosophy, Azerbaijani cinema, Azerbaijani military, as well as country-specific ones about Georgia, Turkey and Azerbaijan itself.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Azerbaijani Wikipedia is constantly increasing its number of articles, but at some point in 2015 this number somewhat decreased returning to values smaller than 100,000.

'''Baldur Ragnarsson''' (born 25 August 1930) is an [[Iceland]]ic poet and author of [[Esperanto]] works. He was a teacher and a superintendent of schools in Iceland.

== Esperanto ==
Baldur learned [[Esperanto]] at school in 1949 and has been active in the movement to promote the use of this language since 1952. He was president of the [[Icelandic Esperanto Association]] for many years. He presided over the [[World Esperanto Association]]'s literary contest from 1975 to 1985. He was president of the organizing committee for the 1977 [[World Esperanto Congress]] at [[Reykjavík]] and vice-president of the [[World Esperanto Association]] in charge of culture and education from 1980 to 1986. He has since then been an honorary member of this organization.

A [[Akademio de Esperanto|Member of the Esperanto Academy]] since 1979, he was editor of the journal ''[[Norda Prismo]]'' from 1958 to 1974.

In 2007 the Association of Esperanto-speaking authors (''Esperantlingva Verkista Asocio'') nominated him as their candidate for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] following the death of [[William Auld]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everk.it/baldur-ragnarsson/BaldurRagnarsson_presentation-letter.pdf Announcement of Esperantlingva Verkista Asocio's Nobel nomination]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Baldur has composed poetic works in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] as well as books on the [[Icelandic language]]. He has also written two collections of Esperanto poems: ''Ŝtupoj sen nomo'' and ''Esploroj''.

In 2007 [[Edistudio]] published ''La lingvo serena'', his complete works. In addition to the poems of his two previous collections, the book contains all the poems he has published subsequently, as well as all the essays he has written on literature and linguistics.

'''Ben Tey Dogon''', named after the village ''Been'' it is spoken in, is a divergent, recently described [[Dogon language]] spoken in [[Mali]]. It is closely related to [[Bankan Tey Dogon|Bankan Tey]] and [[Nanga Dogon|Nanga]] Dogon. It is said that elders in the Dogon village of ''Gawru'' also speak this language. Been is reported to have been settled from the village of Walo, and Ben Tey Dogon differs from [[Walo Dogon]] primarily from being under a different foreign influence, as Been village is surrounded by [[Jamsay Dogon|Jamsay]]-speaking villages, which Walo is not.

'''Benedict Arnold''' (21 December 1615 – 19 June 1678) was president and then governor of the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]], serving for a total of 11 years in these roles.  He was born and raised in the town of [[Ilchester]], [[Somerset]], England, likely attending school in [[Limington]] nearby.  In 1635 at the age of 19, he accompanied his parents, siblings, and other family members on a voyage from England to [[New England]], where they first settled in [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]] in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]].  In less than a year, they moved to Providence Plantation at the head of the [[Narragansett Bay]] at the request of [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]].  In about 1638, they moved once again, about five miles south to the [[Pawtuxet River]], settling on the north side at a place commonly called Pawtuxet.  Here they had serious disputes with their neighbors, particularly [[Samuel Gorton]], and as a result put themselves and their lands under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts, a situation which lasted for 16 years.

Arnold learned the Indian languages at an early age, and became one of the two leading [[interpreter]]s in the Rhode Island colony, Roger Williams being the other.  He was frequently called upon to interpret during negotiations with the Indians, but on one occasion was accused by them of misrepresentation.

In 1651, Arnold left Providence and Pawtuxet with his family, settling in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] where he began his public service, which lasted continuously until his death.  He quickly became a [[freeman (colonial)|freeman]], Commissioner, and Assistant, and in 1657 succeeded Roger Williams as president of the colony, serving for three years.  In 1662, he was once again elected President and, during the second year of this term, the [[Royal Charter of 1663]] was delivered from England, naming him as the first governor of the colony and offering broad freedoms and self-determination to the colony.

Arnold was a bold and decisive leader. He was elected for two additional terms as governor, the last time following the devastation of [[King Philip's War]].  He died on 19 June 1678 while still in office, and was buried in the [[Arnold Burying Ground]], located on Pelham Street in Newport.  In his will, he left to his wife his [[Newport Tower (Rhode Island)|"stone built wind mill,"]] which still stands as an important Newport landmark.  His many descendants include General [[Benedict Arnold]], best known for his treason during the [[American Revolutionary War]], and Senator [[Stephen Arnold Douglas]] who debated [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1858, and lost to him during the [[1860 presidential election]].

==Early life==

Benedict Arnold was born 21 December 1615 in [[Ilchester]], [[Somerset]], England, the second child and oldest son of [[William Arnold (settler)|William Arnold]] and Christian Peak.{{sfn|Hubbard|1879|p=428}} He was familiar with the nearby villages of [[Church of St Andrew, Northover|Northover]], from where his grandparents Nicholas and Alice Arnold had come; [[Yeovilton]], where his Aunt Joane's husband William Hopkins (ancestor of Rhode Island Governor [[Stephen Hopkins (politician)|Stephen Hopkins]]) was from; and [[Limington]], after which he named one of his properties in New England, calling it "Lemmington Farm."{{sfn|Austin|1887|p=244}}  All four of these localities lie within two miles of each other.  Arnold was likely educated at the Free Grammar School associated with the parish church in Limington, slightly more than a mile to the east of Ilchester.  This ancient school is where [[Thomas Wolsey]] was the [[curate]] and [[schoolmaster]] from 1500 to 1509.  Wolsey later became the Lord [[cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] and [[primate (bishop)|Primate]] of England.{{sfn|Arnold|1921|p=37}}

At the age of 19, Arnold accompanied his parents and siblings aboard a ship destined for [[New England]]. The Arnolds gathered their baggage and supplies in the spring of 1635 and made the trip from [[Ilchester]] to [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] on the coast of [[Devon]].{{sfn |Arnold|1921|p=38}}  He wrote in a family record begun by his father, "Memorandom my father and his family Sett Sayle from [[Dartmouth, England|Dartmouth]] in Old England, the first of May, friday &amp;c. Arrived in New England June 24o Ano 1635."{{sfn|Hubbard|1879|p=428}}  The name of the ship on which he sailed was not recorded, nor has it been identified since.{{sfn|Arnold|1921|p=9}}  It is possible that [[Stukeley Westcott]] of [[Yeovil]]&lt;ref&gt;Which is five miles south of Ilchester&lt;/ref&gt; was also on the same ship with his family, including his daughter Damaris, aged 15, the future wife of Arnold.{{sfn|Whitman|1932|p=13}}

Upon their arrival in New England, the Arnolds joined a group of settlers from [[Hingham, Norfolk|Hingham]], [[Norfolk]], England, where they established the new town of [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]] in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]].{{sfn|Anderson|Sanborn|Sanborn|1999|p=84}}  William Arnold received title to a house lot here in September 1635, but the following spring he and several other settlers were persuaded by [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] to join him in establishing a new settlement on the [[Narragansett Bay]] named Providence Plantation.{{sfn|Anderson |Sanborn|Sanborn|1999|p=84}}  The younger Arnold wrote in the family record, "Memm. We came to Providence to Dwell the 20th of April, 1636. per me Bennedict Arnold."{{Sfn|Hubbard|1879|p=428}}  Arnold received a house lot on what is now North Main Street in Providence, and his father was granted the second lot south of his.{{sfn|Arnold|1921|p=21}}

==Providence and Pawtuxet==

In 1637, Arnold was [[List of early settlers of Rhode Island#Providence civil compact, 1637|one of 13 settlers]] who signed a compact agreeing to subject themselves to any agreements made by a majority of the masters of families.{{sfn|Appletons|1891}}{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=1}}  About 1638, he accompanied his father, his brother-in-law [[William Carpenter (Rhode Island)|William Carpenter]], and [[Robert Coles (settler)|Robert Coles]] in a move about five miles south to the [[Pawtuxet River]].  The settlement was called Pawtuxet and was still within the jurisdiction of Providence Plantation; it later became a part of [[Cranston, Rhode Island]].  On 17 July 1640, Arnold signed an agreement [[List of early settlers of Rhode Island#Signers of Providence agreement for a government, 1640|with 38 other Providence residents]] to form a more compact government "to preserve the peace and insure the prosperity of a growing community."{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=3}}  It did neither, especially after the arrival of [[Samuel Gorton]], who [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] wrote was "bewitching and bemadding poor Providence."{{sfn|Austin|1887|p=302}}  In one incident, "Upon the attempt to enforce the execution of an award against Francis Weston made by eight men orderly chosen, Gorton, with many of his followers, assailed the representatives of law and order making a tumultuous hubbub."{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=3}}  Arnold wrote a petition with 12 others dated 17 November 1641 in which they formally applied to Massachusetts for help, asking the government there to "lend us a neighborlike helping hand."{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=3}}  Massachusetts replied that they could not help unless the complainants fell under their jurisdiction.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=3}}

The Arnolds, Coles, and Carpenter were highly offended by Gorton, who had moved with some of his adherents to Pawtuxet. They went to Boston and submitted themselves to the government and jurisdiction of Massachusetts on 2 September 1642.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=3}}  They were received by the General Court there and appointed justices of the peace.  In doing this, these settlers allowed a foreign jurisdiction into the midst of the Providence government, a condition that lasted for 16 years.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=3}}  Gorton was unhappy about being under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts and moved with his followers another 12 miles farther south, settling beyond the limits of Massachusetts' jurisdiction at a place called Shawomet.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=4}}

Arnold and his father had already become proficient in the [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] and [[Wampanoag]] languages, and both harbored an intense dislike of Gorton. They devised a scheme to undermine their adversary and to simultaneously obtain extensive lands from the local Indians.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|pp=4,6}}  Gorton had purchased Shawomet from [[Miantonomi]], the chief [[sachem]] of the Narragansett people.  Minor sachems Ponham and Sacononoco had some control of the lands at Pawtuxet and Shawomet, and Arnold, acting as interpreter, took these chieftains to [[John Winthrop|Governor Winthrop]] in Boston and had them submit themselves and their lands to Massachusetts, claiming that the sale of Shawomet to Gorton was done "under duress."{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=4}}  Now with a claim to Shawomet, Massachusetts directed Gorton and his followers to appear in Boston to answer "complaints" made by the two minor sachems.  When Gorton refused, Massachusetts sent a party to Shawomet to arrest him and his neighbors.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=4}}  The ensuing trial had nothing to do with the land claims, but instead focused on the writings and beliefs of Gorton, for which he and others in his group were imprisoned.  Ultimately, Gorton was released and went to England where he was given legal title to his lands from the Earl of Warwick and, in his honor, the settlement of Shawomet was renamed [[Warwick, Rhode Island|Warwick]].{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=4}}

Arnold was the only member of the colony besides Roger Williams who was highly proficient in the Narragansett and Wampanoag tongues, and he was often called upon to interpret during negotiations.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=6}}  In June 1645, he was sent by the General Court of Massachusetts to the [[Narragansett people]] to urge them to desist from engaging in a war with the [[Mohegans]].  On 28 July, Arnold and two others were sent to get the hostile tribes to send deputies to Boston to talk and make peace.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=6}}  This attempt failed and, a month later, Arnold would not go back again, as he had been charged with misrepresenting the reply of the tribes, and Roger Williams went as interpreter in his place.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=6}}{{sfn|Appletons|1891}}

The issue of the Pawtuxet settlers remaining under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts was a constant irritant to Roger Williams, Gorton, and the other Providence and Warwick settlers.  The General Court of Rhode Island met at Warwick on 22 May 1649 and ordered that letters be sent to Arnold and the other Pawtuxet settlers in reference to their subjecting themselves to the Rhode Island colony.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=6}}  This did not happen, and the Pawtuxet settlers continued under Massachusetts for another nine years.{{sfn|Austin|1887|p=242}}  Arnold and his father did not specifically lay claim to the Shawomet lands; nevertheless, they had extensive land holdings, and Arnold paid a tax of five pounds in 1650, the highest in the colony, and his father paid three and a half pounds, the second highest amount.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=6}}{{sfn|Austin|1887|p=242}}

In June 1650, Roger Williams wrote to [[John Winthrop|Governor Winthrop]] in Massachusetts saying that Arnold had bought a house and land at [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] with the intention to move there.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=7}}  His reasons for moving were not revealed in his own writings, but some historians have suggested that mercantile interests compelled the move,{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=7}} while others have suggested political interests or a desire to get away from the hostile atmosphere of Providence and Pawtuxet.{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=1025}}

==Newport and politics==

In 1651, Arnold left Providence and Pawtuxet for Aquidneck Island (which was officially called Rhode Island at the time), settling in Newport.{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=1016}}  He recorded in the family record, "Memorandum. We came from Providence with our family to Dwell at Newport in Rhode Island the 19th of November, Thursday in afternoon, &amp; arrived ye same night  Ano. Domina 1651".{{sfn|Hubbard|1879|p=428}}  With only a few exceptions, men from Newport held the reins of power for the first century of Rhode Island history.{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=1019}}  When the first English settlers came to [[Aquidneck Island]] in 1638, they organized a quarterly court and English-style jury trial.  In 1640, Newport established monthly courts, rights of appeal, and trial by jury, whereas in Providence there was no court, no judge, and no jury.{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=1018}}  

Significant political events were taking place upon Arnold's arrival in Newport.  [[William Coddington]] had been successful in separating the island towns of Newport and Portsmouth from the two mainland towns of Providence and Warwick (called Shawhomett at the time), under a commission which he obtained earlier in England; he was appointed as governor for life of the two island towns in 1651.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=7}}  Providence sent [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] to England, feeling that the Patent of 1643 had been abandoned, and those on the island opposed to Coddington sent [[Dr. John Clarke]] and [[Mary Dyer|William Dyer]] to have Coddington's charter annulled.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=7}}  Williams and Dyer returned to New England after finding success, while Clarke remained in England for the next decade, acting as a diplomat to protect the colony's interests.{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=1019}}  In February 1653, Dyer brought letters revoking Coddington's commission, with the authority of the government to proceed under the Patent of 1643 and the status quo of 1647.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=7}}  [[John Sanford (governor)|John Sanford]] succeeded Coddington in 1653, and with the change of administration came the work leading to the reunification of the four towns under one government.{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=1009}}  

In 1653, Arnold became a [[freeman (colonial)|freeman]] of Newport and, from that point forward, served in some public capacity every year until his death in 1678.{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=1016}}  In 1654, he was selected as one of the commissioners from Newport (each of the four towns had six), and he was an Assistant from 1655 to 1656.{{sfn|Austin|1887|p=242}}  He was very active as a member of the Court of Commissioners and a member of the most important committees.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=8}}  In 1655, Arnold, Roger Williams, Samuel Gorton, and [[William Baulston]] were appointed by the court to frame a letter of thanksgiving to the English Lord President of the Council on colonial affairs, and to present humble acknowledgments and submission of the colony to His Highness, the Lord Protector, [[Oliver Cromwell]]. The letter of reply from Cromwell was placed in the custody of Arnold.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=8}}  

Arnold was elected as the President of the colony in 1657, at the age of 41, succeeding Roger Williams in this capacity.{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=1017}}

===Terms as president===

[[File:Roger Williams statue by Franklin Simmons.jpg|thumb|right| Roger Williams was succeeded by Arnold as President of the colony in 1657]]

Arnold became President at a crucial time in Rhode Island's history.  Tremendous political change was occurring in England, and this resulted in significant changes and opportunities for the little [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]], which was constantly being harassed by its larger neighbors Massachusetts and Connecticut.  Oliver Cromwell had been ruling in England since the overthrow and execution of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1649, but his death in 1658 marked the [[Restoration (1660)|restoration]] of the monarchy, and [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] ascended to the throne.{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=1019}}  The Colony of Rhode Island was quick to adjust to the new political reality, and the General Court of Commissioners met at Warwick on 18 October 1660 where two letters were read, one from Dr. Clarke telling of the Restoration, and one from His Majesty, containing the royal declaration and proclamation.{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=1019}}  Leaders in the colony set aside a special day of proclamation so that the colonists could recognize the new king.{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=1019}}

Arnold was succeeded as President in 1660 by [[William Brenton]], but continued for many years as a Commissioner, as well as an Assistant from 1660 to 1661.{{sfn|Austin|1887|pp=242-7}}  In these roles, he headed a committee to draft and send a new commission to Dr. Clarke, giving due credit to the King's father Charles I for the Patent of 1643 which gave the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations its official existence.{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=1020}}  Reference was made to "sundry obstructions" stemming from "claims of neighbors about us," referring to interests that both the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and [[Connecticut Colony]] had on the greater Narragansett Bay area.{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=1020}}  The document went on to include Dr. Clarke as the agent and attorney for the colony, and used deferential language toward "his most gracious and regall Majesty, Charles the Second, by the Grace of God, the most mighty and potent King of England."{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=1020}}  

In this commission, the four towns of the Rhode Island colony declared their "unfayned affection" for the new king.{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=1020}}  The commission also armed Dr. Clarke, the able diplomat, with what he needed to fulfill his mission.  He wrote a well-crafted letter on behalf of the colony asking for an experiment in liberty where the colony would become "a Republic of Liberty under Law, in which every man is king and no man subject."{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=1021}}

===Dealings with the Quakers===

A 1658 letter from the [[New England Confederation|United Colonies]] (Massachusetts, Plymouth, New Haven, and Connecticut) announced the arrival of the [[Quakers]], calling them notorious heretics and calling for their speedy removal from the colonies.{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=1024}}  The United Colonies wanted the Quakers removed from Newport, and used the threat of withholding trade as leverage for their position.{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=1024}}  Arnold was no friend of the Quakers, but his reply demonstrated a firm adherence to the Rhode Island doctrine of religious tolerance and was endorsed by the four Assistants (one from each town).{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=1024}}  He wrote, "Concerning these Quakers (so-called), which are now among us, we have no law among us, whereby to punish any for only declaring by words, &amp;c., theire mindes and understandings concerning the things and days of God, as to salvation and an eternal condition."{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=1024}}  He went on to say that the Quakers find a "delight to be persecuted by civill powers," thus gaining more adherents to their cause.  He felt that their doctrines tended to be very absolute, "cutting down and overturning relations and civil government among men."{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=1024}}

President Arnold promised Massachusetts Governor [[Simon Bradstreet]] that the Quakers' "extravagent outgoinges" would be considered at the next session of the General Assembly, and he hoped that some action would be taken to prevent the "bad effects of their doctrines and endeavors."{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=1024}}  At the March 1658 session of the Assembly, the Rhode Island doctrine of "freedom of different consciences" was reaffirmed, and a letter was sent to the Commissioners stating that the matter would be presented to the supreme authority of England if troubles arose from harboring Quakers.{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=1024}}  Following this, no further complaints came from the other colonies.{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=1025}}

===Terms as governor===

[[File:Rhode Island State Charter 1663.jpg|thumb|right| The [[Royal Charter of 1663]] named Arnold as the first governor of the colony.]]

In 1662, Arnold was once again elected president of the colony, and Clarke's earlier diplomacy came to fruition in the second year of this term with the [[Royal Charter of 1663]], which historian [[Thomas Bicknell]] described as "the grandest instrument of human liberty ever constructed."{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=1022}}  Under this instrument, Arnold became the first governor of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, with [[William Brenton]] as his Deputy.{{sfn|Laws of Nature}}{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=1022}}  The earlier governing body, the Court of Commissioners, was replaced with a legislature of ten Assistants and a House of Deputies, with six from Newport and four each from Providence, Portsmouth, and Warwick.{{sfn|Arnold |1859|p=295}}  One of the first acts performed by Arnold as governor was to address a letter to [[John Winthrop, Jr.|Governor Winthrop]] of Connecticut about running a line between the two colonies as provided by the Charter.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=10}}  

In 1664, the King's Commissioners came to Rhode Island to settle claims of jurisdiction over the Narragansett country, specifically addressing rival claims between the Rhode Island and Connecticut colonies over land at [[Westerly, Rhode Island|Westerly]] and the settlement at [[Wickford, Rhode Island|Wickford]].{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=11}}{{sfn|Arnold| 1859|pp=304-5}}  The commissioners were able to forestall a major confrontation, but no substantial changes were made, and the disputes between the two colonies continued for the next 50 years.{{sfn|Arnold|1859|p=305}}  The King's Commissioners also appointed Arnold as a justice of the peace and a magistrate of the "King's Province" (later [[Washington County, Rhode Island]]).{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=11}}

In the election of 1666, Arnold retired from office and was succeeded once again by [[William Brenton]].{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=11}}  Nevertheless, he and others were compelled to sit in the Assembly as deputies "as the Court due desire their assistance."{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=11}}  In 1669, Arnold was again chosen as governor, and he was re-elected in 1670 when the controversy became acute with Connecticut over disputed lands in King's Province and [[Westerly, Rhode Island|Westerly]].{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=11}}  On 11 July 1670, Arnold sent a strong letter to Connecticut's Governor Winthrop informing him of Rhode Island's determination to appeal to King Charles concerning "invasions and intrusions upon the lands and government of this Colony."{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=11}}  There is no record, however, of this threat being carried through.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=11}}

During this administration, the [[Quakers]] were finding the religious tolerance of Rhode Island to be a fertile ground for their missionaries, and they also found a safe haven from other colonies here.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=11}}  They found success in the spread of their religion and became a strong political force, as well.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=11}}  Arnold was once again elected governor in 1671 but, in 1672, the governorship went to Quaker [[Nicholas Easton]], and the Quakers held the reins of power for three of the next five years.  Arnold, however, had left a positive mark on the colony and, after more than ten years of his leadership, the disorganized and fragmentary governments of the four towns were united and put in order, with courts established and an organized society put into motion.{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=1022}}

===Business and land interests===

[[File:somerset levels from glastonbury tor arp.jpg|thumb|left|Arnold's New England property called "Lemmington Farm" was named after [[Limington]] in Somerset.]]

Arnold's usefulness had been in great demand for the welfare of the colony, and his successful political career was mirrored by equally successful agricultural and mercantile pursuits.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=12}}  While living at Pawtuxet, he became an agent for arms, ammunition, and liquors, and he had an establishment on the Warwick side of the river offering Boston goods and provisions in demand at the time.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=12}}  In his book ''Simplicities Defense'', [[Samuel Gorton]] complained that Arnold constantly traded with the Indians on the Sabbath day and was too liberal in providing them with powder.  He further complained that Arnold would not sell items to the Warwick settlers unless they submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of Massachusetts.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=12}}  The Warwick settlers also complained that he furnished the Indians with strong drink and wine, which was forbidden by the Warwick town council.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=12}}

After leaving the governorship in 1672, Arnold likely attended to his commercial interests, and he was said to be the wealthiest person in the colony.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=12}}  He had a wharf and warehouse mentioned in his will, and he had commercial interests in the [[West Indies]], evident from a 1674 letter that he wrote to his son-in-law Roger Goulding, urging him to complete his (Arnold's) business in the [[Barbados]].{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=13}}

Arnold held several parcels of land in and around Newport, one of which he called his "Lemmington Farm," which was named after the village of Limington in his native [[Somerset]], England.{{sfn|Austin|1887|p=242}}   In 1657, he was one of about a hundred individuals who purchased [[Conanicut Island]], the second largest island in the Narragansett Bay where the town of [[Jamestown, Rhode Island|Jamestown]] is now located.{{sfn|Appletons|1891}}  He and [[John Greene, Jr.|John Greene]] also acquired Goat Island and Coaster's Harbor Island, which later became the property of the town of Newport.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919| p=16}}

Sometime after January 1658, he [[List of early settlers of Rhode Island#Pettaquamscutt purchasers|and six others]] held equal shares of interest in a company that bought a large tract of land in the Narragansett country known as the Pettaquamscutt Purchase, a tract that became [[South Kingstown]], Rhode Island.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=17}}  He held this until his death, when the property was bequeathed to his three sons Benedict, Josiah, and Oliver.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=17}}  He also owned two parcels of land in Newport, one where his wharf and warehouse were located, and the other the site of his mansion house.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=17}}

===King Philip's War===

[[King Philip's War]] (1675–76) left the mainland towns of Rhode Island in ruins, "the most disastrous conflict to ever devastate New England."{{sfn|Arnold|1859|p=387}}  This confrontation between several tribes and the Colonists was named for [[Metacomet]], sachem of the [[Wampanoag]]s, who was also called King Philip. The Rhode Island colony was much more at peace with the Indians than the other colonies, yet it bore the brunt of damage because of its location at the geographical center of conflict; the settlements of Warwick and Pawtuxet were totally destroyed, with much of Providence destroyed, as well.{{sfn|Gorton|1907|p=136}}  Several of Arnold's relatives lived in these areas and fled to [[Long Island]], and his aged father had been moved from Pawtuxet to his brother's garrison house but did not survive the conflict.{{sfn|Arnold|1935|p=48}}  

In April 1676, it was voted by the Assembly "that in these troublesome times and straits in this Colony, this Assembly desiring to have the advice and concurrence of the most judicious inhabitants, if it may be had for the good of the whole, do desire at their next sitting the company and counsel of Mr. Benedict Arnold" [[List of early settlers of Rhode Island#Colonial leaders during King Phillips War|and 15 others]].{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=1022}}  Quakers were noted for their pacifism, and Quaker Governor [[Walter Clarke (governor)|Walter Clarke]] was in office during the conflict.  Even though the war had ended, the so-called "war party" was successful in the election of 1677, and Arnold was voted back into office as governor.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=13}}

During this term, Arnold's health began to fail, but he was still re-elected in May 1678.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=15}}  He was too ill to leave his house, and his deputy governor [[John Cranston (politician)|John Cranston]] transacted the colony's business, along with two assistants and a recorder, by visiting him at home.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=15}}  His health did not improve, and he died within a month of his last election to governor.{{sfn|Tompkins|1919|p=15}}

==Death and legacy==

[[File:DSCN3887 newporttower e.jpg|thumb|right| The [[Newport Tower (Rhode Island)|Newport Tower]] which Arnold called his "stone built wind mill"]]

Arnold wrote his will on 24 December 1677, during his last full term as governor.{{sfn|Austin|1887|p=242}} A codicil to the will was written the following February, and the governor died in June while still in office.{{sfn|Austin|1887|p=242}}  On 29 June, Samuel Hubbard of Newport wrote to Dr. Edward Stennett of London, "Our Governor died the 19th day of June, 1678, buried 20th day, all this island was invited, many others was there, judged near a thousand people, brother Hiscox spoke there excellently led forth, I praise God."{{sfn|Austin|1887|p=244}} In his will, Governor Arnold gave land to his wife with mansion house and "''stone built wind mill''."{{sfn|Austin|1887|p=244}}  There are romantic legends of early norsemen coming to Newport and building the stone structure that continues to stand in the city, but the strongest evidence suggests that the structure was the base of Arnold's windmill mentioned in his will.{{sfn|Godfrey|1951|p=129}}

Benedict Arnold, his wife, and many of his family are buried in the [[Arnold Burying Ground]] located on Pelham Street in Newport.  For many years, the cemetery was buried under a garden in the back yard of a residence, but a major renovation began in 1949 whereby all the stones were unearthed, cleaned, and returned to their original positions.{{sfn|Brayton|1960|p=77}}  There is no inscription on the slabs covering the graves of the governor and his wife, but his grave is marked with a governor's medallion.{{sfn|Find-a-grave|2005}}

Lieutenant Governor and Rhode Island historian [[Samuel G. Arnold]] wrote of him:
&lt;blockquote&gt;That he was no friend of the doctrines, or advocate of the conduct of the followers of [[George Fox|Fox]] [Quakers] is evident from his writings; but that like [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Williams]], he recognized the distinction between persecution and opposition, between legal force and moral suasion as applied to matters of opinion, is equally apparent.  In politics and in theology he was alike the opponent of [[William Coddington|Coddington]] and the friend of [[Dr. John Clarke|John Clarke]] and throughout his long and useful life he displayed talents of a brilliant order which were ever employed for the welfare of his fellow men.{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=1023}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Family and descendants==

Arnold was married on 17 December 1640 to Damaris, the daughter of [[Stukeley Westcott]] and Julianna Marchante.{{sfn|Cutter|1915|p=45}}  They had nine children:  Benedict, Caleb, Josiah, Damaris, William, Penelope, Oliver, Godsgift, and Freelove.{{sfn|Austin|1887|p=243}}  All but William grew to adulthood, married, and had children.{{sfn|Austin|1887
|pp=243,245}}  His son Caleb, a physician, married Abigail Wilbur, who was the daughter of [[Samuel Wilbur, Jr.]] and the granddaughter of both [[Samuel Wilbore]] [Sr.] and [[John Porter (settler)|John Porter]], two signers of the [[Portsmouth Compact|compact]] establishing the town of Portsmouth with [[Anne Hutchinson]].

Notable descendants of Benedict Arnold through his son Benedict include his great-grandson, also named [[Benedict Arnold]],{{sfn|Arnold|1935|p=132}} the general of the [[American Revolutionary War]] who is remembered primarily for his treason to America when he switched sides to fight with the British.  Descendants through his son Caleb Arnold include Commodore [[Oliver Hazard Perry]],{{sfn|Arnold|1935|p=90}} American hero of the [[Great Lakes]] during the [[War of 1812]], and his younger brother Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry]],{{sfn|Arnold|1935|p=90}} who compelled the [[opening of Japan]] to the West with the [[Convention of Kanagawa]] in 1854. Senator [[Stephen Arnold Douglas]]{{sfn|Arnold|1935|p=274}} is also descended through this line, who debated [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1858 before a senate race and later lost to him in the [[1860 presidential election]].  Rhode Island colonial Deputy Governor [[George Hazard]] is another descendant.{{sfn|Austin|1887|pp=244,320-1}}

{{refimprove|date=February 2015}}
'''Cabinet collective responsibility''', also known as '''collective ministerial responsibility''',&lt;ref&gt;Gay, Oonagh; Powell, Thomas. [http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/RP04-82/RP04-82.pdf Research Paper 04/82: "The collective responsibility of Ministers – an outline of the issues"], ''Parliament and Constitution Centre, the House of Commons Library''. 15 November 2004. p. 7: "As with so much of the United Kingdom constitutional and political system, collective ministerial responsibility is not something created or explained in some statute or constitutional document."&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] in [[Parliamentary system|Parliamentary systems]] that members of the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] must publicly support all governmental decisions made in Cabinet, even if they do not privately agree with them. This support includes voting for the government in the legislature. Some Communist political parties apply a similar convention of [[democratic centralism]] to their [[central committee]].

If a member of the Cabinet wishes to openly object to a Cabinet decision then they are obliged to resign from their position in the Cabinet.

Cabinet collective responsibility is related to the fact that if a [[vote of no confidence]] is passed in [[parliament]], the government is responsible collectively, and thus the entire government resigns. The consequence will be that a new government will be formed or parliament will be dissolved and a [[general election]] will be called. Cabinet collective responsibility is not the same as [[individual ministerial responsibility]], which states that [[Minister (government)|ministers]] are responsible for the running of their departments, and therefore culpable for the departments' mistakes.

==Overview==
Cabinet collective responsibility is a tradition in parliamentary governments in which the [[prime minister]] is responsible for appointing the cabinet ministers. The cabinet ministers are usually selected from the same [[political party]] as the prime minister to make collective decision-making for [[legislation]] faster and more effective. Unlike a presidential system, as used, for example, in the United States, a parliamentary system’s [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[Legislative branch|legislative]] branches are intertwined. Because of the [[fusion of powers]] of the executive and legislative branches the prime minister relies on the cabinet to always support their policy decisions.&lt;ref name="Parliamentary Democracy"&gt;{{cite web|last=Leroy Way|title=British and American Constitutional Democracy|url=http://www.proconservative.net/CUNAPolSci201PartThreeA.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; A breach of cabinet collective responsibility, such as when a cabinet member publicly disagrees with an executive decision results in a resignation or termination from that cabinet position.&lt;ref name="Australian Gov." /&gt; The New South Wales Parliamentary Library Research Service in Australia explains that "one aspect of collective ministerial responsibility is that Ministers share responsibility for major government decisions, particularly those made by the cabinet and, even if they personally object to such decisions, Ministers must be prepared to accept and defend them or resign from the cabinet".&lt;ref name="Australian Gov."&gt;{{cite book |last=Griffith |first=Gareth|title=Minority governments in Australia 1989-2009 : accords, charters and agreements |year=2010|publisher=NSW Parliamentary Library Research Service|location=[Sydney, N.S.W.]|isbn=978-0-7313-1860-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabinet collective responsibility consists of two main features:
;{{anchor|Cabinet confidentiality}}&lt;!-- [[Cabinet confidentiality]] redirects here--&gt;Cabinet confidentiality:the members of the cabinet must not reveal the content of the discussion which takes place. This allows for cabinet members to privately debate and raise concerns.
;Cabinet solidarity:the members of the cabinet must publicly show a unified position, and must vote with the government even if they privately disagree with the decision that has been made.

Collective responsibility is not circumvented by appointing Ministers outside of Cabinet,&lt;ref&gt;Cabinet Office ''Cabinet Manual 2008'' (Wellington, 2008) para 3.20&lt;/ref&gt; as has occurred in [[New Zealand]] where, from 2005 to 2008, [[Winston Peters]] and [[Peter Dunne]] were Ministers outside of Cabinet, despite their parties not being considered part of a coalition.

In non-parliamentary governments like that of the United States, cabinet collective responsibility is not formally practiced. This is due to the clear separation of the executive and the legislature in policy-making. The United States president's [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet]] members cannot simultaneously serve in [[United States Congress|Congress]], and therefore cannot vote on legislation supported by the executive. The president instead has [[veto]] power over legislation passed by Congress.&lt;ref name="Congress Report"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Petersen |first=Eric |title=Congress: A brief comparison of the British House of Commons and the U.S. House of Representatives |journal=Congressional Research Service |date=19 May 2005 |pages=3–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cabinet unity and collective agreement between members are important to cabinet stability and party politics, but cabinet members do not have to publicly support legislation proposed or supported by the president. It is, however, in the cabinet member's best interest to support and align with the president's policies, because they serve at the pleasure of the president, who can at any time dismiss them or appoint them to another position.

==Examples==
Parliamentary democracies such as Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada practice and adhere to cabinet collective responsibility. Rhodes, Wanna and Weller offer this description of the principle of cabinet solidarity in [[Westminster system]]s of parliamentary democracy: "Cabinet solidarity and collective responsibility are twin dimensions of responsible party government that enjoy [[constitutionality]], albeit informally. They lie at the core of ministerial governance. Cabinet solidarity is purely a political convention designed to maintain or protect the collective good as perceived by a partisan ministry. It rests on the notion that the executive ought to appear a collective entity, able to maintain cohesion and display political strength".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Comparing Westminster |first1=R.A.W. |last1=Rhodes |first2=John |last2=Wanna |first3=Patrick |last3=Weller |publisher=OUP |location= |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-19-956349-4 |page=127 |url=}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 November 2012 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In Australia, cabinet collective responsibility is fundamental to cabinet confidentiality, but also to protect private information from becoming public and possibly threatening [[national security]]. Cabinet solidarity is not a legal requirement, but a political convention and practiced norm. There is no written law that upholds cabinet collective responsibility, but it is deeply ingrained in Australia's cabinets as a political norm and is therefore an important aspect of the collective strength and influence of the prime minister's administration.

Occasionally on highly controversial issues such as the [[Australian republic referendum, 1999|1999 republic referendum]], there may be a [[conscience vote]] where any MP may vote as they wish, but these issues are rare and never tied to official party policy, and normally party discipline is very tight.

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], the cabinet is on rare occasion allowed to freely vote its conscience and to oppose the government without consequence, as occurred with the vote on [[capital punishment]] under [[Brian Mulroney]]. These events are rare and are never on matters of [[Confidence and supply|confidence]]. The most prominent Canadian cabinet minister to resign because he could not vote with the cabinet was [[John Turner]], who refused to support [[wage and price controls]]. In Canada, [[party discipline]] is much tighter than in other Westminster-system countries; it is very rare for any MP to vote counter to the party leadership.

===Finland===
In [[Finland]], collective responsibility has been established both constitutionally and as a convention. The [[Finnish Government]] and its ministers are collectively responsible for all its decisions. However, the constitution allows a minister to dissent by expressing an objection which is entered into the minutes.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.fi/books?id=xY3fNI0oLLsC&amp;pg=PA315&amp;lpg=PA315&amp;dq=Cabinet+%22collective+responsibility%22+finland&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PxxS8dZVz9&amp;sig=F-PeAirKh-S5hnmRFYV-L9TknOU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmxs2G8bzcAhWkKJoKHVbqAaoQ6AEIfTAR#v=onepage&amp;q=Cabinet%20%22collective%20responsibility%22%20finland&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, while formally allowed, dissent is uncommon because it jeopardizes the stability of the government. Namely, majority [[coalition government]]s became the norm after President [[Urho Kekkonen|Kekkonen]] retired in 1981. A new cabinet must be approved by a parliamentary majority, thus a [[government platform]] is agreed upon by the participating parties. It is distinct from party platforms and details the compromises that parties made in order to cooperate. If a party fails to follow the government platform, other parties in the government can pull the plug and force the entire government to resign.

===Ireland===
Article 28.4.2° of the [[Constitution of Ireland]] states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#article28_4_2|title=Constitution of Ireland|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|pages=28.4.2°|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:[[Government of Ireland|The Government]] shall meet and act as a collective authority, and shall be collectively responsible for the [[Department of State (Ireland)|Departments of State]] administered by the members of the Government.
In 1992, the [[Beef Tribunal]] was investigating allegations of political corruption, and wanted to take evidence from a minister about cabinet meetings at which controversial proposals had been discussed. The [[Supreme Court (Ireland)|Supreme Court]] ruled in 1993 that such discussions could not be disclosed because Article 28.4.2° required absolute confidentiality of cabinet discussions (though not of decisions which were formally recorded).&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney General v Hamilton (No 1)'' [1993] 2 IR 250&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Seventeenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Seventeenth Amendment of the Constitution]] was passed by referendum in 1997 to add Article 28.4.3°, which allows such disclosures in exceptional circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1997/ca/17/enacted/en/html|title=Seventeenth Amendment of the Constitution Act, 1997.|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FordeLeonard2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forde|first1=Michael|last2=Leonard|first2=David|title=Constitutional Law of Ireland|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=YVsQAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129|accessdate=11 May 2016|year=2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781847667380|pages=129–130  |chapter=6.10 Cabinet confidentiality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom practices cabinet collective responsibility. The prime minister selects a number of cabinet ministers from the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and the [[House of Lords]]. Once selected as cabinet ministers, each minister is given a position as head of one of the government departments. Cabinet ministers respond to oral questions from [[Member of parliament#United Kingdom|MPs]]. The cabinet members, along with the Prime Minister, schedule weekly closed door sessions to discuss the collective stance of the cabinet to avoid inconsistent responses from cabinet ministers. The solidarity of the cabinet is consistently challenged by the opposition in an attempt to create contradictions between cabinet ministers. It is therefore imperative for the cabinet members to have their responses as common and similar as possible.&lt;ref name="Congress Report" /&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], the doctrine applies to all members of the government, from members of the cabinet down to [[Parliamentary Private Secretary|Parliamentary Private Secretaries]]. Its inner workings are set out in the [[Ministerial Code (United Kingdom)|Ministerial Code]]. On occasion, this principle has been suspended; most notably in the 1930s when in Britain the [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] allowed its [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] members to oppose the introduction of [[protectionism|protective tariffs]]; and again when [[Harold Wilson]] allowed Cabinet members to campaign both for and against the [[United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum, 1975|1975 referendum]] on whether the UK should remain in the [[European Economic Community]]. In 2003, [[Tony Blair]] allowed [[Clare Short]] to stay in the cabinet, despite her public opposition to the [[2003 Iraq War]]. However, she later resigned.

The convention appeared to have been partially suspended under the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] - [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Coalition Government]] of Prime Minister [[David Cameron]], with Liberal Democrat ministers such as [[Vince Cable]] frequently publicly criticising the actions of Conservative Cabinet members.

David Cameron suspended the cabinet collective responsibility doctrine for the EU Referendum held on 23 June, 2016, following the precedent set by Harold Wilson on this matter in 1975. Prominent cabinet ministers including Michael Gove and Chris Grayling opted to make use by campaigning to leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/20/cameron-set-to-name-eu-referendum-date-after-cabinet-meeting|title=EU referendum to take place on 23 June, David Cameron confirms|author=Rowena Mason|date=|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
A parliamentary system that uses cabinet collective responsibility is more likely to avoid contradictions and disagreements between cabinet members of the executive branch.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Cabinet ministers are likely to feel there is a practical and collective benefit from being part of a team.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Cabinet collective responsibility to the people also benefits party and personal loyalty to the prime minister. Solidarity within the cabinet can strengthen the prime minister's party and accelerate policy decisions and interests of that party. Presidential democracies often lack the ability to pass legislation quickly in times of emergency or instances of [[national security]].&lt;ref name="British Gov in Crisis"&gt;{{cite book|last=Foster|first=Christopher|title=British government in crisis : or the third English revolution|year=2005|publisher=Hart |location=Oxford|isbn=1-84113-549-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==
Because cabinet collective responsibility forces the cabinet ministers to publicly agree with the prime minister's decisions, political debate and internal discourse is hindered. When disagreements occur within a cabinet dependent on collective responsibility, negotiating collective agreements can be difficult. Cabinet collective responsibility is therefore dependent on the mutual agreement and collective unity of the cabinet and its members.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14265">{{redirect|Cassandra Complex}}
[[File:Cassandra1.jpeg|thumb|Painting of Cassandra by [[Evelyn De Morgan]]]]

The '''Cassandra metaphor''' (variously labelled the '''Cassandra''' "'''syndrome'''", "'''complex'''", "'''phenomenon'''", "'''predicament'''", "'''dilemma'''", or "'''curse'''") occurs when valid warnings or concerns are dismissed or disbelieved.

The term originates in [[Greek mythology]]. [[Cassandra]] was a daughter of [[Priam]], the King of [[Troy]].  Struck by her beauty, [[Apollo]] provided her with the gift of [[prophecy]], but when Cassandra refused Apollo's romantic advances, he placed a curse ensuring that nobody would believe her warnings.  Cassandra was left with the knowledge of future events, but could neither alter these events nor convince others of the validity of her predictions.

The metaphor has been applied in a variety of contexts such as psychology, environmentalism, politics, science, cinema, the corporate world, and in philosophy, and has been in circulation since at least 1949 when French philosopher [[Gaston Bachelard]] coined the term 'Cassandra Complex' to refer to a belief that things could be known in advance.&lt;ref&gt;Bachelard, Gaston, Le Rationalisme appliqué PUF, Paris, (1949)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==

The Cassandra metaphor is applied by some psychologists to individuals who experience physical and emotional suffering as a result of distressing personal perceptions, and who are disbelieved when they attempt to share the cause of their suffering with others.

===Melanie Klein===

In 1963, [[psychologist]] [[Melanie Klein]] provided an interpretation of [[Cassandra]] as representing the human moral conscience whose main task is to issue warnings. Cassandra as moral conscience, "predicts ill to come and warns that punishment will follow and grief arise".&lt;ref name="Klein, M. 1975"&gt;Klein, M., Envy and Gratitude- And Other Works 1946–1963, p. 293 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Cassandra's need to point out moral infringements and subsequent social consequences is driven by what Klein calls "the destructive influences of the cruel super-ego", which is represented in the [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]] by the god [[Apollo]], Cassandra's overlord and persecutor.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, M., Envy and Gratitude – And Other Works 1946–1963, p. 295 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Klein's use of the metaphor centers on the moral nature of certain predictions, which tends to evoke in others "a refusal to believe what at the same time they know to be true, and expresses the universal tendency toward denial, [with] denial being a potent defence against persecutory anxiety and guilt".&lt;ref name="Klein, M. 1975"/&gt;

===Laurie Layton Schapira===

In a 1988 study, [[Jungian]] analyst Laurie Layton Schapira, explored what she called the "[[Cassandra Complex]]" in the lives of two of her analysands.&lt;ref name="Laurie Layton Schapira 1988"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://openlibrary.org/books/OL2243156M/The_Cassandra_complex|title=The Cassandra complex: living with disbelief: a modern perspective on hysteria|last=Schapira|first=Laurie Layton|date=1988|publisher=Inner City Books|year=|isbn=091912335X|location=Toronto, Canada|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
Based on clinical experience, she delineates three factors which constitute the Cassandra complex: 
# dysfunctional relationships with the "[[Apollo archetype]]",
# emotional or physical suffering, including [[hysteria]] ([[conversion disorder]]) or "women’s problems",
# and being disbelieved when attempting to relate the facticity of these experiences to others.&lt;ref name="Laurie Layton Schapira 1988"/&gt;

Layton Schapira views the Cassandra [[Complex (psychology)|complex]] as resulting from a dysfunctional [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] with what she calls the "[[Apollo archetype]]", an archetype which refers to any individual's or culture's pattern that is dedicated to, yet bound by, order, reason, intellect, truth and clarity that disavows itself of anything occult or irrational.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Layton Schapira, The Cassandra Complex: Living With Disbelief: A Modern Perspective on Hysteria p.10 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; The intellectual specialization of this archetype creates emotional distance and can predispose relationships to a lack of emotional reciprocity and consequent dysfunctions.&lt;ref name="Laurie Layton Schapira 1988"/&gt; She further states that a "Cassandra woman" is very prone to hysteria because she "feels attacked not only from the outside world but also from within, especially from the body in the form of somatic, often gynaecological, complaints."&lt;ref name="Layton_p65"&gt;Laurie Layton Schapira, ''The Cassandra Complex: Living With Disbelief: A Modern Perspective on Hysteria'' p.65 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

Addressing the [[metaphor]]ical application of the [[Cassandra|Greek Cassandra myth]], Layton Schapira states that:
{{blockquote|What the Cassandra woman sees is something dark and painful that may not be apparent on the surface of things or that objective facts do not corroborate. She may envision a negative or unexpected outcome; or something which would be difficult to deal with; or a truth which others, especially authority figures, would not accept. In her frightened, ego-less state, the Cassandra woman may blurt out what she sees, perhaps with the unconscious hope that others might be able to make some sense of it.

===Jean Shinoda Bolen===

In 1989, [[Jean Shinoda Bolen]], Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the [[University of California]], published an essay on the god Apollo&lt;ref&gt;Jean Shinoda Bolen, ''Gods in Everyman: A New Psychology of Men's Lives and Loves'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; in which she detailed a psychological profile of the "Cassandra woman" whom she suggested referred to someone suffering—as happened in the mythological relationship between Cassandra and Apollo—a dysfunctional relationship with an "Apollo man". Bolen added that the Cassandra woman may exhibit "hysterical" overtones, and may be disbelieved when attempting to share what she knows.&lt;ref name="Jean Shinoda Bolen 1989"&gt;Jean Shinoda Bolen, Gods in Everyman: A New Psychology of Men’s Lives and Loves pp. 130–160 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Bolen, the archetypes of Cassandra and Apollo are not gender-specific. She states that "women often find that a particular [male] god exists in them as well, just as I found that when I spoke about goddesses men could identify a part of themselves with a specific goddess. Gods and goddesses represent different qualities in the human psyche. The pantheon of Greek deities together, male and female, exist as archetypes in us all&amp;nbsp;... There are gods and goddesses in every person."&lt;ref&gt;Jean Shinoda Bolen, ''Gods in Everyman: A New Psychology of Men's Lives and Loves'' pp. x–xi (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

"As an archetype, Apollo personifies the aspect of the personality that wants clear definitions, is drawn to master a skill, values order and harmony, and prefers to look at the surface rather than at what underlies appearances. The Apollo archetype favors thinking over feeling, distance over closeness, objective assessment over subjective intuition."&lt;ref&gt;Jean Shinoda Bolen, ''Gods in Everyman: A New Psychology of Men's Lives and Loves'' p.135 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

Of what she describes as the negative Apollonic influence, Dr. Bolen writes:
{{blockquote|Individuals who resemble Apollo have difficulties that are related to emotional distance, such as communication problems, and the inability to be intimate&amp;nbsp;... Rapport with another person is hard for the Apollo man. He prefers to access (or judge) the situation or the person from a distance, not knowing that he must "get close up"—be vulnerable and empathic—in order to truly know someone else&amp;nbsp;... But if the woman wants a deeper, more personal relationship, then there are difficulties&amp;nbsp;... she may become increasingly irrational or hysterical.&lt;ref name="Jean Shinoda Bolen 1989"/&gt;}}
Bolen suggests that a Cassandra woman (or man) may become increasingly hysterical and irrational when in a dysfunctional relationship with a negative Apollo, and may experience others' disbelief when describing her experiences.&lt;ref name="Jean Shinoda Bolen 1989"/&gt;

==Corporate world==

Foreseeing potential future directions for a corporation or company is sometimes called "visioning".&lt;ref name="Davies1998"&gt;Davies, P., "The Cassandra Complex: how to avoid generating a corporate vision that no one buys into" pp. 103–123 in ''Success in Sight: Visioning'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Yet achieving a clear, shared vision in an organization is often difficult due to a lack of commitment to the new vision by some individuals in the organization, because it does not match reality as they see it. Those who support the new vision are termed "Cassandras"—able to see what is going to happen, but not believed.&lt;ref name="Davies1998"/&gt; Sometimes the name Cassandra is applied to those who can predict rises, falls, and particularly crashes on the global [[stock market]], as happened with [[Warren Buffett]], who repeatedly warned that the 1990s stock market surge was a bubble, attracting to him the title of "Wall Street Cassandra".&lt;ref&gt;''The Bear Book: Survive and Profit in Ferocious Markets'', p. 81 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andy Grove]], in his book ''Only The Paranoid Survive'', reminds the reader of the Helpful Cassandras that sense the winds of change before others and are critical to managing through Strategic Inflection Points.&lt;ref&gt; ''Only The Paranoid Survive'' (1999) &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- this is a primary source—we need another to establish notability --&gt;{{better source needed|date=October 2018}}

==Environmental movement==

Many environmentalists have predicted looming environmental catastrophes including [[climate change]], rise in sea levels, irreversible [[pollution]], and an impending collapse of [[ecosystem]]s, including those of [[rain forest|rainforests]] and [[ocean]] [[reef]]s.&lt;ref name="AtKisson, A. 1999"&gt;AtKisson, A., Believing Cassandra: An Optimist Looks at a Pessimist's World, [[Earthscan]] (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Even though much of this has since come to pass, individuals sometimes acquire the label of 'Cassandras', whose warnings of impending environmental disaster are disbelieved or mocked.&lt;ref name="AtKisson, A. 1999"/&gt; [[Environmentalist]] [[Alan Atkisson]] wrote in 1999 that to understand that humanity is on a collision course with the laws of nature is to be stuck in what he calls the 'Cassandra dilemma' in which one can see the most likely outcome of current trends and can warn people about what is happening, but the vast majority cannot, or will not respond, and later if catastrophe occurs, they may even blame you, as if your prediction set the disaster in motion.&lt;ref&gt;AtKisson, A., Believing Cassandra: An Optimist Looks at a Pessimist's World, p.22 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally there may be a "successful" alert, though the succession of books, campaigns, organizations, and personalities that we think of as the environmental movement has more generally fallen toward the opposite side of this dilemma: a failure to "get through" to the people and avert disaster. In the words of Atkisson: "too often we watch helplessly, as Cassandra did, while the soldiers emerge from the Trojan horse just as foreseen and wreak their predicted havoc. Worse, Cassandra's dilemma has seemed to grow more inescapable even as the chorus of Cassandras has grown larger."&lt;ref&gt;AtKisson, A., Believing Cassandra: An Optimist Looks at a Pessimist's World, p.22 pp. 32–33 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other examples==

There are examples of the Cassandra metaphor being applied in the contexts of [[medical science]],&lt;ref&gt;Web, S., Contemporary IMRT: Developing Physics and Clinical Implementation, p.357 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lantos, J.D., The Lazarus Case: Life-and-Death Issues in Neonatal Intensive Care, p.160 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; the media,&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys, L., Digital Media: Transformations in Human Communication, p.157 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; to feminist perspectives on reality,&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein, L., 'The Cassandra Complex', pp. 37–41 in Haring-Smith, T., New Monologues For Women By Women – Vol II (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Delamotte, D., Women Imagine Change: A Global Anthology of Women's Resistance From 600 B.C.E. p.86 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and in politics.&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, S., Angus, I., Orwell, G., My Country Right or Left p.378 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; There are also examples of the metaphor being used in popular music lyrics, such as the 1982 ABBA song "Cassandra",&lt;ref&gt;Atkisson, A., Cassandra's Lyre (song) on album Believing Cassandra 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[ABBA]]: 'Cassandra' recorded October 18, 1982 as the B-side of the single The Day Before You Came&lt;/ref&gt;  Emmy the Great's "Cassandra", and [[Star One (band)|Star One]]'s "Cassandra Complex". The five-part [[The Mars Volta]] song "Cassandra Gemini" may reference this syndrome,&lt;ref&gt;Fear Before the March of Flames, Taking Cassandra to the End of the World Party (song) on album The Always Open Mouth 2006&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the film ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|12 Monkeys]]'' or in [[Dead and Divine]]'s "Cassandra Syndrome". The Ohio band Curse of Cassandra is named after the metaphor.

There are also distinct parallels to Old Testament prophets such as Jeremiah, Isaiah, and Amos - prophets who called attention to the failure of those who thought of themselves as God's people to forsake meaningless sacrifices and devote themselves to caring for "orphans and widows in their distress." The prophets called their societies to thereby honor God and avoid social / political disasters. Their "prophecies" were not well-received; Jeremiah, for example, being thrown into a deep well as well as put in wooden stocks.

{{About|part of a ship|defensive chains to control access to harbours and rivers|boom (navigational barrier)}}
The '''chains''' were small platforms, built on either side of the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] of a ship, used to provide a wide purchase for the shrouds, and to assist in the practice of [[depth sounding]]. 

The chains provided a platform for a 'leadsman', the sailor assigned to swing the sounding line, or 'lead' into the water.&lt;ref name="Kemp"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Kemp|title=The Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term originated from the practice of the sailor standing between the [[Shroud (sailing)|shrouds]] when casting the line, which were attached to the hull by [[chainplate]]s, or, in earlier sailing ships, to lengths of chain along the ship's side. A length of chain was usually fixed at waist height to the [[stanchion]]s above the chains, as an added safety measure.&lt;ref name="Kemp"/&gt; The chains were common on large sailing vessels, but the role of leadsman and swinging the lead to obtain depth soundings declined with developments in [[echo sounding]], and ships are rarely now equipped with chains.&lt;ref name="Kemp"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5052">In the theory of [[Jacques Lacan]], '''demand''' ({{lang-fr|demande}}) represents the way instinctive needs are inevitably alienated through the effects of language on the human condition.&lt;ref&gt;A. Lemaire, ''Jacques Lacan'' (1979) p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of demand was developed by Lacan in parallel to those of need and desire to account for the role of speech on human aspirations.&lt;ref name = enotes&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/demand Gabriel Balbo, "Demand"]&lt;/ref&gt; Demand forms part of Lacan's battle against the approach to [[language acquisition]] favored by [[ego psychology]], and makes use of [[Kojeve]]'s theory of desire.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Macey]], "Introduction", Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis'' (London 1994) p. xxviii&lt;/ref&gt; Demand is not a [[Freud]]ian concept.&lt;ref name = enotes/&gt;

==Language acquisition==

For Lacan, demand is the result of language acquisition on physical needs - the individual's wants are automatically filtered through the alien system of external signifiers.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Sheridan, "Translator's Note", Lacan, ''Four'' p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

Where traditionally [[psychoanalysis]] had recognised that learning to speak was a major step in the ego's acquisition of power over the world,&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; and celebrated its capacity for increasing instinctual control,&lt;ref&gt;Selma H. Fraiberg, ''The Magic Years'' (New York 1987) p. 133-4 and p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan by contrast stressed the more sinister side of man's early submergence in language.

He argued that "demand constitutes the Other as already possessing the 'privilege' of satisfying needs", and that indeed the child's biological needs are themselves altered by "the condition that is imposed on him by the existence of the discourse, to make his need pass through the defiles of the signifier".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 286 and p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; Thus even in speaking one's demands, the latter are altered; and even when they are met, the child finds that it no longer wants what it thought it wanted.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Schneiderman, ''Returning to Freud'' (New York 1980) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Desire==

In Lacanian thought, a demand results when a [[lack (manque)|lack]] in [[the Real]] is transformed into [[the Symbolic]] medium of [[language]]. Demands faithfully express [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] signifying formations, but always leave behind
a residue or kernel of [[desire (psychoanalysis)|desire]], representing a lost surplus of [[jouissance]] for the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]], (because the Real is never totally symbolizable).

As a result, for Lacan, "desire is situated in dependence on demand - which, by being articulated in signifiers, leaves a [[Metonymy|metonymic]] remainder which runs under it".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Four'' p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; The frustration inherent in demand -  whatever is actually asked for is 'not it' - is what gives rise to desire.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Hill, ''Lacan for Beginners'' (London 1997) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Other's demands==

The demands of human society are initially mediated via the Mother;&lt;ref name="Ecrits321"&gt;Lacan, ''Ecrits'' p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; with the discourse of whom the infant comes to identify, subsuming its own non-verbal self-expression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/demand Gabriel Balbo "Demand"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The result in the neurotic may be a dominance of parental demand, and of the social objects valued by such demands - jobs, degrees, marriage, success, money and the like.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Fink, ''The Lacanian Subject'' (Princeton 1997) p. 189 and p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan considered indeed that for the neurotic "the demand of the Other assumes the function of an object in his phantasy...this prevalence given by the neurotic to demand".&lt;ref name="Ecrits321"/&gt;

==Transference==

Lacan considered that the [[transference]] appears in the forms of demands from the patient&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Four'' p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;  - demands which he stressed the analyst must resist.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Ecrits'' p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

Through such demands, he states, "the whole past opens up right down to early infancy. The subject has never done anything other than demand, he could not have survived otherwise, and...[[regression (psychology)|regression]] shows nothing other than a return to the present of signifiers used in demands".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Ecrits'' p. 254-5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[François Roustang]] however has challenged the Lacanian view, arguing that the patient's demand, rather than undermining the analysis, may be a positive attempt to get the analyst to shift their therapeutic stance.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Campbell, ''Psychoanalysis and the Time of Life'' (2006) p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="870">'''The Dultgen halftone intaglio process''' is a photoengraving technique invented by, [[Arthur Dultgen]] and is widely used today in commercial colour work.

Two positives are made from the [[Continuous tone]] copy, one through a [[halftone]] screen or a special contact screen and the other without a screen.

A sheet of [[carbon tissue]] is then exposed first to the screened [[Negative (photography)|positive]], which produces an image of dots of varying sizes, then to the continuous-tone positive, which produces differing degrees of hardening of the dot image. The array of dots vary not only in width but also in depth so as to extend the range of tonal values to be reproduced. This method thus uses two methods for controlling tonal values.

'''Emerillon''' (alternate names '''Emerilon''', '''Emerion''', '''Mereo''', '''Melejo''', '''Mereyo''', '''Teco''') is a [[Tupi–Guarani language]] spoken in [[French Guiana]] on the rivers [[Camopi]] and [[Tampok]].

The '''foxtrot''' is a smooth, progressive [[dance]] characterized by long, continuous flowing movements across the dance floor. It is danced to [[big band]] (usually vocal) music. The dance is similar in its look to [[waltz]], although the [[meter (music)|rhythm]] is in a {{music|time|4|4}} [[time signature]] instead of {{music|time|3|4}}. Developed in the 1910s, the foxtrot reached its height of popularity in the 1930s and remains practiced today.

==History==
[[File:Ballroom dance.jpg|thumb|[[Dancesport]] version of foxtrot]]
The dance was premiered in 1914, quickly catching the eye of the husband and wife duo [[Vernon and Irene Castle]], who lent the dance its signature grace and style.  The origin of the name of the dance is unclear, although one theory is that it took its name from its popularizer, the [[vaudeville]] actor [[Harry Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.streetswing.com/histmain/z3foxtrt.htm|title=The Fox Trot | work = Streetswing's Dance History Archives|access-date=February 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two sources, [[Vernon_and_Irene_Castle|Vernon Castle]] and dance teacher Betty Lee, credit African American dancers as the source of the foxtrot.  Castle saw the dance, which "had been danced by negroes, to his personal knowledge, for fifteen years, [at] a certain exclusive colored club".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |  degree=Master of Arts | chapter= | title=A Compilation and Analysis of the Origins of the Foxtrot in White Mainstream America | url=http://catalog.lib.byu.edu/uhtbin/cgisirsi/x/0/0/57/5/3?searchdata1=3059085{CKEY}&amp;searchfield1=GENERAL^SUBJECT^GENERAL^^&amp;user_id=WEBSERVER | last=Hawkins | first=Christina M. |year=2002 |publisher=Brigham Young University Department of Dance| page=18 |access-date=February 14, 2012 | docket= | oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. C. Handy]] ("Father of the Blues") notes in his autobiography that his "[[The Memphis Blues]]" was the inspiration for the foxtrot.  During breaks from the fast paced Castle Walk and One-step, Vernon and Irene Castle's music director, [[James Reese Europe]], would slowly play the Memphis Blues.  The Castles were intrigued by the rhythm, and Jim asked why they didn't create a slow dance to go with it.  The Castles introduced what they then called the "Bunny Hug" in a magazine article.  Shortly after, they went abroad and, in mid-ocean, sent a wireless to the magazine to change the name of the dance from "Bunny Hug" to the "Foxtrot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Father of the Blues | first = William Christopher | last = Handy | year = 1941 | publisher = MacMillan | page = 226 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was subsequently standardized by [[Arthur Murray]], in whose version it began to imitate the positions of [[Tango (dance)|Tango]].

At its inception, the foxtrot was originally danced to [[ragtime]].  From the late 1910s through the 1940s, the foxtrot was the most popular fast dance, and the vast majority of records issued during these years were foxtrots.  The waltz and tango, while popular, never overtook the foxtrot.  Even the popularity of the [[Lindy Hop|Lindy hop]] in the 1940s did not affect the foxtrot's popularity, since it could be danced to the same records used to accompany the Lindy hop.

When [[rock and roll]] first emerged in the early 1950s, record companies were uncertain as to what style of dance would be most applicable to the music.  Notably, [[Decca Records]] initially labeled its rock and roll releases as "foxtrots", most notably "[[Rock Around the Clock]]" by [[Bill Haley and His Comets]].  Since that recording, by some estimates, went on to sell more than 25 million copies, "Rock Around the Clock" could be considered the biggest-selling "foxtrot" of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | quote = For many years, the Guinness Book of World Records listed Haley's version as the top-selling pop record of all time with 25 million copies sold -- a record that stood until 1997 and which technically remains intact as Elton John's "Candle in the Wind" tribute to Princess Diana was issued a CD-single, not a vinyl 45. | url =  http://www.rockabillyhall.com/RockClockTribute.html | title = 'Rock Around the Clock' Tribute | first = Alex | last = Frazer-Harrison | work = Rockabilly Hall of Fame | date = November 2010 | access-date = July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, the dance is customarily accompanied by the same big band music to which [[Swing (dance)|swing]] is also danced.

Over time, the foxtrot split into slow and quick versions, referred to as "foxtrot" and "[[quickstep]]" respectively.  In the slow category, further distinctions exist between the International or English style of the foxtrot and the continuity American style, both built around a slow-quick-quick rhythm at the slowest tempo, and the social American style using a slow-slow-quick-quick rhythm at a somewhat faster pace.  In the context of [[Ballroom glossary#Standard|International Standard]] category of ballroom dances, for some time the foxtrot was called "Slow Foxtrot", or "Slowfox". These names are still in use, to distinguish from other types of foxtrots.

==Styles==
Three distinct styles of slow foxtrot are in common use among ballroom dancers today: the American Social Style, the American Continuity Style, and the International Style. All three are partner dances in which the dancers progress around the dance floor in a counter-clockwise direction and are danced to much the same music. However, they differ significantly in technique, positions, and figures.

===American Social Foxtrot===

It is particularly well suited to dancing in a crowded room, by partners who may or may not know each other well, and who may or may not have had much formal training in dance. Its defining feature is that the dancers close their feet at the end of almost every figure, as opposed to passing their feet as in the other two styles. As a result, the dancers progress fairly slowly around the room, and some figures can even be danced in place. Furthermore, almost every figure begins in much the same position, with the two partners facing each other squarely in the [[closed position]] and the man starting on his left foot. Since each figure leads so easily and consistently in the next, it is fairly easy for the leader to string multiple figures together on the fly in an ever-changing sequence. Body contact is unnecessary and not generally expected; all figures can be led through the frame formed by the arms. Hence, the potential social awkwardness of body contact between partners who do not know each other well is avoided. As American Social Style is the only style allowed in bronze (beginner) level American Style dance competition, this style is sometimes also known as "American Bronze Foxtrot".

The American Social style uses both six-count and eight-count figures. The rhythmic alteration between the two is one of the few potential difficulties in the dance. [[Syncopation]] is generally avoided.

The six-count figures extend across one and a half measures of music, and utilize the rhythm slow (two counts), slow (two counts), quick (one count), quick (one count). Examples include: the basic movement forward and back, the alternating quarter turns (zig-zag), the rock turns right and left, the promenade, the promenade twist (12 counts), the promenade pivot (12 counts), and the sway step. Social dancers generally use the alternating quarter turns to progress in a zig-zag pattern around the room, alternating for variety with the [[Promenade (dance move)|promenade]]. Rock turns are used for changes of direction in corners and to avoid collisions. Both the rock turns and balance step can be danced entirely in place, if necessitated by crowded conditions. Many of these figures can be further embellished by underarm turns.

The eight-count figures extend across two measures of music and utilize the rhythm slow (two counts), quick (one count), quick (one count); slow (two counts), quick (one count), quick (one count). Most of them can be further decomposed into two four-count figures, although this would break the convention that every figure begins in closed position with the man stepping on his left foot. Examples include: the forward and reverse box, the left and right box turns, the closed twinkle with promenade close ending, the fallaway twinkles (16 counts), the promenade twinkles (16 counts), and the serpentine (progressive twinkles) with closed footwork. A few, such as the grapevine, utilize a faster rhythm consisting of four quicks. Most of these eight-count figures resemble corresponding figures in the waltz, with the rhythm modified by extending the first step of each figure to occupy two counts. Again, many of these figures can be further embellished by underarm turns.

The only common syncopated figure is the [[Chasse|chassé]]. It is a four-count figure with the rhythm slow (two counts) quick-and-quick (two counts), that may be inserted between a closed twinkle and its promenade close ending.

===American Continuity Style===
The American Continuity Style&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=NDCA Approved Figures, Elements, and Restrictions|date=2015|publisher=National Dance Council of America|edition=Rev.

It is the style generally seen in American musical theater productions and in film. It differs from the social style in that the dancers pass their feet at the end of each figure, rather than closing them. Consequently, dancers progress much more rapidly around the room, in a smooth, continuous manner that gives the style its name. It differs from the International Style in that body contact is optional. This permits the dance partners to assume a much wider variety of positions and, therefore, to execute many types of figures that are not possible in the International Style. As American Continuity Style is expected in Silver Level American Style dance competitions and above, this style is sometimes also known as "American Silver Foxtrot".

Transitions from one dance position to another are an important aspect of the American style. Commonly employed dance positions include normal (closed) position, in which the dancers face each other squarely with the man's right hand around the woman's back; promenade position, in which the partners open slightly in a vee; open position (a two-hand hold with the arms extending forward sideways); and shadow position (in which both partners face the same direction, rather than each other). Partners may even separate completely for short periods of time. "Lines", in which the partners form and hold a special shape for a short period of time, also play an important role. Examples include the oversway, the chair, the check.

In the American Continuity Style, most figures are based upon four-count units with the rhythm slow (two counts), quick (one count), quick (one count) repeating in each measure. A basic dance sequence progressing around the room in a straight line might consist of an open left box turn (eight counts), an open twinkle (four counts), an open right turn (four counts), an open impetus (a/k/a hairpin) (four counts), and a continuity ending (four counts), returning to the start of the sequence. Other figures based upon the same rhythm include the serpentine (a/k/a progressive twinkles) with open footwork; the curved running steps; the outside swivel; the pivot from promenade; and the natural fallaway. Many of these figures may be executed in a variety of positions: for instance, the serpentine may be executed in closed position, open position, or shadow position, with the man facing either forwards or backwards. Many of these figures may be further embellished by underarm turns, especially when changing from one dance position to another. Variations upon this basic rhythm may employ four quick steps (quick, quick, quick, quick) as in the grapevine and the second measure of the weave, or syncopation (slow, quick-and-quick quick) as in the chassé.

Many Continuity-Style Foxtrot figures are similar to those of American Continuity Style [[Waltz]], with the rhythm modified by extending the first step of each figure to occupy two counts. Some, like the open twinkles, are direct developments of the corresponding Social Foxtrot figures in which the footwork has been modified by passing the feet at the end of the figure instead of closing the feet; others are entirely different.

Its defining characteristic is that partners must maintain body contact at all times. Consequently, the variety of possible figures and positions is much more limited than in the American style. Dancers concentrate on creating an image of a smooth, gliding motion around the dance floor. The use of body contact makes it possible to execute very tight turns, which is further enhanced by the extensive use of heel turns. This use of heel turns, and the effort required to produce the desired gliding motion, give International Style Foxtrot a reputation as being perhaps the most difficult of all ballroom dances to execute well.

Most figures are based upon four-count units with the rhythm slow (two counts), quick (one count), quick (one count), repeating in each measure. A basic dance sequence progressing around the room might employ a feather step (four counts), reverse turn with feather finish (eight counts), three step (four counts), natural turn (four counts) with impetus (four count) and feather finish (four count), connecting again to a reverse turn. However, rhythmic variation is used to make up for the loss of variety in figures and positions: thus, for example, the weave uses four quick steps in a single measure, while the change of direction uses a two-measure sequence of four slow steps.

====Figures====
International Style Foxtrot is the most tightly defined of all the Foxtrot styles, with instructional and competitive syllabi that are tightly controlled by the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing]]. Thus, it is possible to present the following list of International or English style foxtrot figures,&lt;ref name=BallroomTechnique /&gt; although this is by no means an exhaustive list.

==Competition==
International Foxtrot is one of the five Standard dances that form the backbone of International Style Dance competitions held around the world under the auspices of the [[International Dance Sport Federation]],  its local affiliates, and other organizations. Competitions are generally held at six successive levels of difficulty: Bronze (beginning), Silver (intermediate), Gold (advanced), Novice, Pre-Championship, and Championship. The Bronze, Silver, and Gold levels are syllabus levels: that is, for each level there is a prescribed syllabus of figures from which the competitor is expected to select. The Novice, Pre-Championship, and Championship levels are open levels at which novel, original choreography is permitted and even encouraged. The competitive dance syllabi are defined and tightly controlled by the [[Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing]].

Likewise, American Foxtrot is one of the four Modern Smooth dances that form the backbone of American Style Dance competitions held in the United States under the auspices of the [http://www.ndca.org National Dance Council of America] and [[USA Dance]], and in some other countries. Competitions are again generally held at six successive levels of difficulty: Bronze (beginning), Silver (intermediate), Gold (advanced), Novice, Pre-Championship, and Championship. The Bronze, Silver, and Gold levels are restricted levels in which the permitted set of figures is restricted by rules – very similar but not identical – published by the sponsoring organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=NDCA Approved Figures, Elements, and Restrictions|date=2015|publisher=National Dance Council of America|edition=Rev.

At the Bronze level, only American Social Style is allowed; this is enforced by rules that require closing the feet at the end of each figure. Either Social or Continuity Style may be employed at the Silver level and higher, but Continuity Style is generally expected. There are multiple, alternative instructional and competitive syllabi published by various organizations, which are compatible to varying degrees with the competitive rule sets.

{{About||the term relating to [[video]] transfers|Full screen (disambiguation){{!}}Fullscreen|this term in [[digital photography]]|Full-frame digital SLR}}

In [[cinematography]], '''full frame''' refers to the use of the full [[film gate]] at maximum width and height for [[35 mm film]] [[movie camera|cameras]]. It is sometimes also referred to as '''silent aperture''', '''full gate''',  or a number of other similar word combinations. It is the original gate size pioneered by [[William Dickson (film pioneer)|William Dickson]] and [[Thomas Edison]] in 1892 and first used in the short film ''[[Blacksmithing Scene]]''. Full frame is generally used by all [[negative pulldown|4-perf]] films, whether silent, standard 35 ([[Academy ratio]] width), or [[Super 35]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}  The introduction of Academy ratio in 1932 required that the [[lens mount]] needed to be shifted slightly horizontally to re-center the lens at the new center of frame; however, the gate size did not change as the extra negative information would be cropped out by lab processes in post-production. 4-perf Super 35 is nearly identical to the original full frame standard, although the lens mount requires vertical re-centering when common topline extraction is used. Hard mattes for all common ratios exist and either replace the film gate itself or are inserted within it. However, these are usually not used in the event that any [[Reframing (filmmaking)|reframing]] needs to be done.

'''George Henry Martin Johnson''' (''Onwanonsyshon'') (October 7, 1816 &amp;ndash; February 19, 1884) was a member of the Wolf clan and selected as a hereditary [[tribal chief|chief]] of the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] of the [[Iroquois|Six Nations]] in Canada; he also served as an official interpreter and informal diplomat between the Mohawk and Canadian governments. His home of Chiefswood, built in 1856 on the Grand River, has been designated and preserved as a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site]]; it is the only First Nations mansion from the pre-Confederation era.

==Early life==
Johnson was born at Bow Park on the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]] on the [[Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation]] near [[Brantford, Ontario|Brantford]] in 1816. The Wolf clan members had founded the Reserve after resettling from New York during the [[American Revolution]].

He was the son of [[John Smoke Johnson]], a [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] Bear clan chief, and Helen Martin, a Mohawk whose Dutch mother Catherine Rolleston had been captured as a girl and adopted and assimilated into the Wolf clan.&lt;ref name=chiefswood&gt;[http://www.chiefswood.com/family.html "Johnson Family Tree"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708144004/http://www.chiefswood.com/family.html |date=2011-07-08 }}, Chiefswood National Historic Site, accessed 27 May 2011, Source: Betty Keller, ''Pauline: A Biography of Pauline'', Halifax, NS: Formac Publishing, 1981, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Her father ''Ohyeatea'' (George Martin) was Mohawk. The couple lived with her parents until after their first child was born, in Mohawk custom.&lt;ref name=chiefswood/&gt;

==Education==
George Johnson was educated at the [[Mohawk Institute Residential School|Mohawk Institute]], where he became fluent in English as well as Mohawk.

==Career==
In 1838, Johnson was hired by the Reverend [[Adam Elliot (missionary)|Adam Elliot]] as an interpreter. In 1840, he became interpreter for the [[Church of England|Anglican]] mission at the Reserve. He became influential in both the English and Mohawk communities.

==Marriage and family==
In 1853, Johnson married Emily Susanna Howells, a native of England whose family had immigrated to the United States in 1832. She was the sister-in-law of Reverend Elliot and a cousin of the American author [[William Dean Howells]]. Both families, and the Native community in general, opposed Johnson's [[interracial marriage]] to a white woman.&lt;ref name="DCB"&gt;Douglas Leighton, [http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=5609 JOHNSON, GEORGE HENRY MARTIN (Onwanonsyshon)], ''[[Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The Mohawk resented that under Canadian law, Howells as Johnson's wife would gain status as a Native, with a right "to a portion of her band’s annuities and other benefits."&lt;ref name="DCB"/&gt; Under the Mohawk [[matrilineal]] [[kinship]] system, her children would have not fully belonged to the tribe as they would not be part of any clan.  Reverend Elliot refused to perform the marriage ceremony, so the couple found another Anglican priest who would.&lt;ref name="DCB" /&gt;

The couple educated their four children to embrace both their Mohawk and English heritage. The Johnsons entertained leading figures of the time at their home of Chiefswood, which George had built in 1856 on his 225-acre estate. Their youngest daughter [[Pauline Johnson]] (1861-1913) became nationally known as a Canadian poet and performer known for representing her First Nations heritage. Her fame surpassed that of her father.&lt;ref name="DCB"/&gt; His daughter [[Evelyn Johnson (poet)|Evelyn]] also became a poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=TWIJppDBr3gC&amp;pg=PA47 |title=Buckskin and Broadcloth: A Celebration of E. Pauline Johnson — Tekahionwake, 1861-1913 |page=47 |last=Johnston |first=Sheila M F |year=1997 |ISBN=1554881129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Johnson was elected as a hereditary chief of the Six Nations, succeeding his mother's brother, Henry Martin of the Wolf clan. The Mohawk had a [[matrilineal]] [[kinship]] system, in which descent and property passed through the woman's line, and his mother nominated him for the post.

He later became friends with [[Jasper Tough Gilkison]], Upper Canada Superintendent to the Six Nations.  He was appointed government interpreter. Johnson served as a timber ranger, making efforts to control the theft of timber and sale of [[whiskey]] on the reserve by unscrupulous non-native men. He was badly beaten in 1865 for this, and attacked again in 1873, when he was shot. The sale of timber and whiskey was lucrative for whites.

In 1884 Johnson died at his estate Chiefswood on the Grand River near Brantford. It has been listed as a [[National Historic Site of Canada|National Historic Site]] and is the only Native mansion surviving from the pre-Confederation years. The house and summer kitchen wing were restored in the early 21st century. In addition, much of the open grounds have been restored since the late 20th century to the Ontario Tall Grass Prairie Meadows that were characteristic at the time of the family's residence and had plants used by the Mohawk for medicinal purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chiefswood.com/data/uploads/documents/CNHS-Tall%20Grass%20Prairie-Spring.pdf "Tall Grass Prairie"], Chiefswood National Historic Site&lt;/ref&gt; Today less than five acres remain associated with the mansion. Other parts of the more than 200-acre estate were sold by heirs over the years.

==Description==

In the grand tack hypothesis Jupiter underwent a two-phase migration after its formation, migrating inward to 1.5 AU before reversing course and migrating outward. Jupiter's formation took place near the [[frost line (astrophysics)|ice line]], at roughly 3.5 AU. After clearing a gap in the gas disk Jupiter underwent [[Planetary migration#Type II migration|type II migration]], moving slowly toward the Sun with the gas disk. If uninterrupted, this migration would have left Jupiter in a close orbit around the Sun like recently discovered [[hot Jupiter]]s in other planetary systems.&lt;ref name=Fesenmaier_2015&gt;{{cite web| last1=Fesenmaier| first1=Kimm| title=New Research Suggests Solar System May Have Once Harbored Super-Earths| url=http://www.caltech.edu/news/new-research-suggests-solar-system-may-have-once-harbored-super-earths-46017| publisher=[[Caltech]]| accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saturn also migrated toward the Sun, but being smaller it migrated faster, undergoing either [[Planetary migration#Type I migration|type I migration]] or runaway migration.&lt;ref name=Walsh_etal_2011 /&gt; Saturn converged on Jupiter and was captured in a 2:3 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter during this migration.

Saturn partially cleared its part of the gap reducing the torque exerted on Jupiter by the outer disk. The net torque on the planets then became positive, with the torques generated by the inner [[Lindblad resonance]]s exceeding those from the outer disk, and the planets began to migrate outward.&lt;ref name="Morbidelli_Crida_2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morbidelli|first1=Alessandro|last2=Crida|first2=Aurélien|title=The dynamics of Jupiter and Saturn in the gaseous protoplanetary disk|journal=Icarus|date=2007|volume=191|issue=1|pages=158–171|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2007.04.001|arxiv=0704.1210|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103507001480|bibcode = 2007Icar..191..158M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The outward migration was able to continue because interactions between the planets allowed gas to stream through the gap.&lt;ref name="Brasser_etal_2016a"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brasser|first1=R.|last2=Matsumura|first2=S.|last3=Ida|first3=S.|last4=Mojzsis|first4=S.

==Scope of the grand tack hypothesis==
The hypothesis can be applied to multiple phenomena in the Solar System.

===Mars problem===

Jupiter's grand tack resolves the Mars problem by limiting the material available to form Mars. The Mars problem is a conflict between some simulations of the formation of the [[terrestrial planet]]s, which when begun with planetesimals distributed throughout the inner Solar System, end with a 0.5–1.0 Earth-mass planet in its region,&lt;ref name=Raynond_etal_2009&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Raymond| first1=Sean N.| last2=O'Brien| first2=David P.| last3=Morbidelli| first3=Alessandro| last4=Kaib| first4=Nathan A.| title=Building the terrestrial planets: Constrained accretion in the inner Solar System| journal=[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]]| date=2009| volume=203| issue=2| pages=644–662| doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2009.05.016| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103509002279|arxiv = 0905.3750 |bibcode = 2009Icar..203..644R }}&lt;/ref&gt; much larger than the actual mass of Mars, 0.107 Earth-mass.

===Asteroid belt===

Jupiter and Saturn drive most asteroids from their initial orbits during their migrations, leaving behind an excited remnant derived from both inside and outside Jupiter's original location. Before Jupiter's migrations the surrounding regions contained asteroids which varied in composition with their distance from the Sun.&lt;ref name=Davidsson_2014&gt;{{cite web| last1=Davidsson| first1=Dr. Björn J.

===Later developments===

The absence of close orbiting [[super-Earth]]s in the Solar System may be the result of Jupiter's inward migration.&lt;ref name=Batygin_Laughlin_2015&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Batygin| first1=Konstantin| last2=Laughlin| first2=Greg| title=Jupiter's decisive role in the inner Solar System's early evolution| journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]| date=2015| volume=112| issue=14| pages=4214–4217| arxiv=1503.06945| doi=10.1073/pnas.1423252112| url=http://www.pnas.org/content/112/14/4214| pmid=25831540| pmc=4394287|bibcode = 2015PNAS..112.4214B }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Jupiter migrates inward, planetesimals are captured in its mean-motion resonances, causing their orbits to shrink and their eccentricities to grow. A collisional cascade follows as their relative velocities became large enough to produce catastrophic impacts. The resulting debris then spirals inward toward the Sun due to drag from the gas disk. If there were super-Earths in the early Solar System, they would have caught much of this debris in resonances and could have been driven into the Sun ahead of it. The current terrestrial planets would then form from planetesimals left behind when Jupiter reversed course.&lt;ref name=AstNow_2015&gt;{{cite web| last1=University of California Santa Cruz Press Release| title=Wandering Jupiter swept away super-Earths, creating our unusual Solar System| url=https://astronomynow.com/2015/03/25/wandering-jupiter-swept-away-super-earths-creating-our-unusual-solar-system/| website=[[Astronomy Now]]| publisher=Pole Star Publications Ltd| accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the migration of close orbiting super-Earths into the Sun could be avoided if the debris coalesced into larger objects, reducing gas drag; and if the protoplanetary disk had an inner cavity, their inward migration could be halted near its edge.&lt;ref name="Raymond_etal_2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raymond|first1=Sean N.|last2=Izidoro|first2=Andre|last3=Bitsch|first3=Bertram|last4=Jacobsen|first4=Seth A.|title=Did Jupiter's core form in the innermost parts of the Sun's protoplanetary disc?|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Volume 458, Issue 3, p.2962-2972|date=2016|volume=458|issue=3|doi=10.1093/mnras/stw431|arxiv=1602.06573|url=http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/458/3/2962|pages=2962–2972|bibcode = 2016MNRAS.458.2962R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of a thick atmosphere around Titan and its absence around Ganymede and Callisto may be due to the timing of their formation relative to the grand tack. If Ganymede and Callisto formed before the grand tack their atmospheres would have been lost as Jupiter moved closer to the Sun. However, for Titan to avoid Type I migration into Saturn, and for Titan's atmosphere to survive, it must have formed after the grand tack.&lt;ref name=Heller_etal_2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heller|first1=R.|last2=Marleau|first2=G.-D|last3=Pudritz|first3=R.

The migration of the giant planets through the asteroid belt creates a spike in impact velocities that could result in the formation of CB chondrites. CB chondrites are metal rich carbonaceous chondrites containing iron/nickel nodules that formed from the crystallization of impact melts 4.8 ±0.3 Myrs after the first solids. The vaporization of these metals requires impacts of greater that 18&amp;nbsp;km/s, well beyond the maximum of 12.2&amp;nbsp;km/s in standard accretion models. Jupiter's migration across the asteroid belt increases the eccentricities and inclinations of the asteroids, resulting in a 0.5 Myr period of impact velocities sufficient to vaporize metals. If the formation of CB chondrites was due to Jupiter's migration it would have occurred 4.5-5 Myrs after the formation of the Solar System.&lt;ref name="Johnson_etal_2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=B.

Following the grand tack, perturbations from the terrestrial planets and the Nice model instability alter the orbital distribution of the remaining asteroids. The resulting eccentricity and semi-major axis distributions resemble that of the current asteroid belt. Some low-inclination asteroids are removed, leaving the inclination distribution slightly over-excited compared to the current asteroid belt.&lt;ref name="Deienno_etal_2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deienno|first1=Rogerio|last2=Gomes|first2=Rodney S.|last3=Walsh|first3=Kevin J.|last4=Morbidelli|first4=Alessandro|last5=Nesvorný|first5=David|title=Is the Grand Tack model compatible with the orbital distribution of main belt asteroids?|journal=Icarus|date=2016|volume=272|pages=114–124|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2016.02.043|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103516001214|bibcode = 2016Icar..272..114D |arxiv = 1701.02775 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent modeling of the formation of planets from a narrow annulus indicates that the quick formation of Mars, the size of the Moon-forming impact, and the mass accreted by Earth following the formation of the Moon are best reproduced if the oligarchic growth phase ended with most of the mass in Mars-sized embryos and a small fraction in planetesimals. The Moon-forming impact occurs between 60 and 130 million years after the formation of the first solids in this scenario.&lt;ref name=Jacobsen_Morbidelli_2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacobson|first1=S.

Encounters with other embryos could destabilize a disk orbiting Mars reducing the mass of moons that form around Mars. After Mars is scattered from the annulus by encounters with other planets it continues to have encounters with other objects until the planets clear material from the inner Solar System. While these encounters enable the orbit of Mars to become decoupled from the other planets and remain on a stable orbit, they can also perturb the disk of material from which the moons of Mars form. These perturbations cause material to escape from  the orbit of Mars or to impact on its surface reducing the mass of the disk resulting in the formation of smaller moons.&lt;ref name="Hansen_2018"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hansen|first1=Bradley M.

Simulations of the formation of the terrestrial planets using models of the protoplanetary disk that include viscous heating and the migration of the planetary embryos indicate that Jupiter's migration may have reversed at 2.0 AU. In simulations the eccentricities of the embryos are excited by perturbations from Jupiter. As these eccentricities are damped by the denser gas disk of recent models, the semi-major axes of the embryos shrink, shifting the peak density of solids inward. For simulations with Jupiter's migration reversing at 1.5 AU, this resulted in the largest terrestrial planet forming near Venus's orbit rather than at Earth's orbit. Simulations that instead reversed Jupiter's migration at 2.0 AU yielded a closer match to the current Solar System.&lt;ref name="Brasser_etal_2016a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sumner_2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sumner|first1=Thomas|title=Mars may not have been born alongside the other rocky planets|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-may-not-have-been-born-alongside-other-rocky-planets|website=Science News|accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the accretion of Mars must have taken place outside the narrow annulus of material formed by the grand tack if Mars has a different composition than Earth and Venus. The planets that grow in the annulus created by the grand tack end with similar compositions. If the grand tack occurred early, while the embryo that became Mars was relatively small, a Mars with a differing composition could form if it was instead scattered outward then inward like the asteroids. The chance of this occurring is roughly 2%.&lt;ref name="Brasser_etal_2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brasser|first1=R.|last2=Mojzsis|first2=S.

Later studies have shown that the convergent orbital migration of Jupiter and Saturn in the fading solar nebula is unlikely to establish a 3:2 mean-motion resonance. Instead of supporting a faster runaway migration, nebula conditions lead to a slower migration of Saturn and its capture in a 2:1 mean-motion resonance.&lt;ref name=dangelo_marzari_2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=D'Angelo|first=G.|author2= Marzari, F. |title=Outward Migration of Jupiter and Saturn in Evolved Gaseous Disks|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|year=2012|volume=757|issue=1|pages=50 (23 pp.)|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/757/1/50 |arxiv = 1207.2737 |bibcode = 2012ApJ...757...50D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Capture of Jupiter and Saturn in the 2:1 mean-motion resonance does not typically reverse the direction of migration, but particular nebula configurations have been identified that may drive outward migration.&lt;ref name="Pierens_2014"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Pierens| first1=Arnaud| last2=Raymond| first2=Sean N.| last3=Nesvorny| first3=David| last4=Morbidelli| first4=Alessandro| title=Outward Migration of Jupiter and Saturn in 3:2 or 2:1 Resonance in Radiative Disks: Implications for the Grand Tack and Nice models| journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters| volume=795| issue=1| page=L11| doi=10.1088/2041-8205/795/1/L11 |arxiv=1410.0543|bibcode = 2014ApJ...795L..11P | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These configurations, however, tend to excite Jupiter's and Saturn's [[orbital eccentricity]] to values between two and three times as large as their actual values.&lt;ref name="Pierens_2014"/&gt; Also, if the temperature and viscosity of the gas allow Saturn to produce a deeper gap, the resulting net torque can again become negative, resulting in the inward migration of the system.&lt;ref name="dangelo_marzari_2012" /&gt;

The grand tack scenario ignores the ongoing accretion of gas on both Jupiter and Saturn.&lt;ref name=dangelo_marzari_2015&gt;{{cite journal|last=D'Angelo|first=G.|author2= Marzari, F. |title=Sustained Accretion on Gas Giants Surrounded by Low-Turbulence Circumplanetary Disks|journal=American Astronomical Society, DPS meeting #47|year=2015|volume=id.418.06|bibcode = 2015DPS....4741806D}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, to drive outward migration and move the planets to the proximity of their current orbits, the solar nebula had to contain a sufficiently large reservoir of gas around the orbits of the two planets.

This process works to deplete somewhat the disk interior to Jupiter's orbit, weakening the torques on Jupiter arising from inner Lindblad resonances and potentially ending the planets' outward migration.&lt;ref name=dangelo_marzari_2012 /&gt;

[[File:Hdetniemi conjecture example.svg|300px|right|thumb|Example of '''Hedetniemi's conjecture''': the tensor product of C5 and C3 (on the left) produces a graph that contains a cycle with length 15 (on the right) so: the resulting graph requires 3 colors.]]

In [[graph theory]], '''Hedetniemi's conjecture''', formulated by [[Stephen T. Hedetniemi]] in 1966, concerns the connection between [[graph coloring]] and the [[tensor product of graphs]]. This conjecture states that
:χ(''G'' × ''H'') = min {χ(''G''), χ(''H'')}.
Here χ(''G'') denotes the [[chromatic number]] of an undirected finite graph ''G''.

The inequality χ(''G'' × ''H'') ≤ min {χ(''G''), χ(''H'')} is easy: if ''G'' is ''k''-colored, one can ''k''-color ''G'' × ''H'' by using the same coloring for each copy of ''G'' in the product; symmetrically if ''H'' is ''k''-colored.  Thus, Hedetniemi's conjecture amounts to the assertion that tensor products can't be colored with an unexpectedly small number of colors.

== Known cases ==
Clearly, any graph with a nonempty set of edges requires at least two colors; if ''G'' and ''H'' are not 1-colorable, that is, they both contain an edge, then their product also contains an edge, and is hence not 1-colorable either.  In particular, the conjecture is true when ''G'' or ''H'' is a bipartite graph, since then its chromatic number is either 1 or 2.

Similarly,  if two graphs ''G'' and ''H'' are not 2-colorable, that is, not [[Bipartite_graph|bipartite]], then both contain a cycle of odd length. Since the product of two odd [[cycle graph]]s contains an odd cycle, the product ''G'' × ''H'' is not 2-colorable either. In other words, if ''G'' × ''H'' is 2-colorable, then at least one of ''G'' and ''H'' must be 2-colorable as well.

The next case has been proved long after the conjecture's statement, by {{harvtxt|El-Zahar|Sauer|1985}}: if the product ''G'' × ''H'' is 3-colorable, then one of ''G'' or ''H'' must also be 3-colorable. In particular, the conjecture is true whenever ''G'' or ''H'' is 4-colorable (since then the inequality χ(''G'' × ''H'') ≤ min {χ(''G''), χ(''H'')} can only be strict when ''G'' × ''H'' is 3-colorable).
In the remaining cases, both graphs in the tensor product are at least 5-chromatic and progress has only been made for very restricted situations.

== Weak Hedetniemi Conjecture ==
The following function (known as the ''Poljak-Rödl function'') measures how low the chromatic number of products of ''n''-chromatic graphs can be.
: {{math|''f''(''n'') {{=}} min {χ(''G'' × ''H'') : χ(''G'') {{=}} χ(''H'') {{=}} ''n''} }}
Hedetniemi's conjecture is then equivalent to saying that {{math|''f''(''n'') {{=}} ''n''}}.
The '''Weak Hedetniemi Conjecture''' instead states merely that the function ''f''(''n'') is unbounded.
In other words, if the tensor product of two graphs can be colored with few colors, this should imply some bound on the chromatic number of one of the factors.

The main result of {{harv|Poljak|Rödl|1981}}, independently improved by Poljak, James H. Schmerl, and Zhu, states that if the function ''f''(''n'') is bounded, then it is bounded by at most 9. 
Thus a proof of Hedetniemi's conjecture for 10-chromatic graphs would already imply the Weak Hedetniemi Conjecture for all graphs.

== Multiplicative graphs ==
The conjecture is studied in the more general context of [[graph homomorphism]]s, especially because of interesting relations to the [[Category theory|category]] of graphs (with graphs as objects and homomorphisms as arrows). For any fixed graph ''K'', one considers graphs ''G'' that admit a homomorphism to ''K'', written ''G'' → ''K''. These are also called ''K''-colorable graphs. This generalizes the usual notion of graph coloring, since it follows from definitions that a ''k''-coloring is the same as a ''K&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''-coloring (a homomorphism into the complete graph on ''k'' vertices). 

A graph ''K'' is called '''multiplicative''' if for any graphs ''G'', ''H'', the fact that ''G'' × ''H'' → ''K'' holds implies that ''G'' → ''K'' or ''H'' → ''K'' holds.
As with classical colorings, the reverse implication always holds: if ''G'' (or ''H'', symmetrically) is ''K''-colorable, then ''G'' × ''H'' is easily ''K''-colored by using the same values independently of ''H''.
Hedetniemi's conjecture is then equivalent to the statement that each complete graph is multiplicative.

The above known cases are equivalent to saying that ''K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' are multiplicative.
The case of ''K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'' is widely open.
On the other hand, the proof of {{harvtxt|El-Zahar|Sauer|1985}} has been generalized by {{harvtxt|Häggkvist |Hell|Miller|Neumann Lara|1988}} to show that all cycle graphs are multiplicative.
Later, {{harvtxt|Tardif|2005}} proved more generally that all [[circular clique]]s ''K&lt;sub&gt;n/k&lt;/sub&gt;'' with ''n/k &lt; 4'' are multiplicative.
In terms of the [[circular coloring|circular chromatic number]] ''χ''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, this means that if {{math|''χ''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;(''G''×''H'') &lt; 4}}, then {{math|''χ''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;(''G''×''H'')  {{=}} min { ''χ''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;(''G''),   ''χ''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;(''G'')} }}.

Examples of non-multiplicative graphs can be constructed from two graphs ''G'' and ''H'' that are not comparable in the homomorphism order (that is, neither ''G''→''H'' nor ''H''→''G'' holds). In this case, letting ''K''=''G''×''H'', we trivially have ''G''×''H''→''K'', but neither ''G'' nor ''H'' can admit a homomorphism into ''K'', since composed with the projection ''K''→''H'' or ''K''→''G'' it would give a contradiction.

== Exponential graph ==
Since the tensor product of graphs is the [[Product (category theory)|category-theoretic product]] in the category of graphs (with graphs as objects and homomorphisms as arrows), the conjecture can be rephrased in terms of the following construction on graphs ''K'' and ''G''.
The '''exponential graph''' {{math|''K&lt;sup&gt;G&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is the graph with all functions {{math|''V(G)'' → ''V(K)''}} as vertices (not only homomorphisms) and two functions ''f'',''g'' adjacent when
:''f(v)'' is adjacent to ''g(v')'' in ''K'', for all adjacent vertices ''v'',''v ' '' of ''G''.
In particular, there is a loop at a function ''f'' (it is adjacent to itself) if and only if the function gives a homomorphism from ''G'' to ''K''.
Seen differently, there is an edge between ''f'' and ''g'' whenever the two functions define a homomorphism from ''G'' × ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  (the [[bipartite double cover]] of ''G'') to ''K''.

The exponential graph is the [[exponential object]] in the category of graphs. This means homomorphisms from ''G'' × ''H'' to a graph ''K'' correspond to homomorphisms from ''H'' to ''K&lt;sup&gt;G&lt;/sup&gt;''. 
Moreover, there is a homomorphism {{math|eval : ''G'' × ''K&lt;sup&gt;G&lt;/sup&gt;'' → ''K''}} given by {{math|eval(''v'',''f'') {{=}} ''f''(''v'')}}.
These properties allow to conclude that the multiplicativity of ''K'' is equivalent {{harv|El-Zahar|Sauer|1985}} to statement:
: either ''G'' or ''K&lt;sup&gt;G&lt;/sup&gt;'' is ''K''-colorable, for every graph ''G''.

In other words, Hedetniemi's conjecture can be seen as a statement on exponential graphs: for every integer ''k'', the graph ''K&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;G&lt;/sup&gt;'' is either ''k''-colorable, or it contains a loop (meaning ''G'' is ''k''-colorable).
One can also see the homomorphisms {{math|eval : ''G'' × ''K&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;G&lt;/sup&gt;'' → ''K&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}}  as the ''hardest'' instances of Hedetniemi's conjecture: if the product ''G'' × ''H'' was a counterexample, then ''G'' × ''K&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;G&lt;/sup&gt;'' would also be a counterexample.

== Generalizations ==
Generalized to directed graphs, the conjecture has simple counterexamples, as observed by {{harvtxt|Poljak|Rödl|1981}}. Here, the chromatic number of a directed graph is just the chromatic number of the underlying graph, but the tensor product has exactly half the number of edges (for directed edges ''g→g' '' in ''G'' and ''h→h' '' in ''H'', the tensor product ''G'' × ''H'' has only one edge, from ''(g,h)'' to ''(g',h')'', while the product of the underlying undirected graphs would have an edge between ''(g,h')'' and ''(g',h)'' as well). 
However, the Weak Hedetniemi Conjecture turns out to be equivalent in the directed and undirected settings {{harv|Tardif|Wehlau|2006}}.

The problem cannot be generalized to infinite graphs: {{harvtxt|Hajnal|1985}} gave an example of two infinite graphs, each requiring an uncountable number of colors, such that their product can be colored with only countably many colors. {{harvtxt|Rinot|2013}} proved that in the [[constructible universe]], for every infinite cardinal &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;, there exist a pair of graphs of chromatic number greater than &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;, such that their product can still be colored with only countably many colors.

== Related problems ==
A similar equality for the [[cartesian product of graphs]] was proven by {{harvtxt|Sabidussi|1957}} and rediscovered several times afterwards. 
An exact formula is also known for the [[lexicographic product of graphs]].
{{harvtxt|Duffus|Sands|Woodrow|1985}} introduced two stronger conjectures involving unique colorability.

'''Indirect self-reference''' describes an object [[self-reference|referring to itself]] ''indirectly''.

For example, define the function f such that f(x) = x(x). Any function passed as an argument to f is invoked with itself as an argument, and thus in any use of that argument is indirectly referring to itself.

This example is similar to the [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] expression "((lambda(x)(x x)) (lambda(x)(x x)))", which is expanded to itself by beta reduction, and so its evaluation loops indefinitely despite the lack of explicit looping constructs. An equivalent example can be formulated in [[lambda calculus]].

Indirect self-reference is special in that its self-referential quality is not explicit, as it is in the sentence "this sentence is false." The phrase "this sentence" refers directly to the sentence as a whole. An indirectly self-referential sentence would replace the phrase "this sentence" with an expression that effectively still referred to the sentence, but did not use the pronoun "this."

An example will help to explain this. Suppose we define the [[quine (computing)|quine]] of a phrase to be the quotation of the phrase followed by the phrase itself. So, the quine of:
 is a sentence fragment
would be:
 "is a sentence fragment" is a sentence fragment
which, incidentally, is a true statement.

Now consider the sentence:
 "when quined, makes quite a statement" when quined, makes quite a statement

The quotation here, plus the phrase "when quined," indirectly refers to the entire sentence. The importance of this fact is that the remainder of the sentence, the phrase "makes quite a statement," can now make a statement about the sentence as a whole. If we had used a pronoun for this, we could have written something like "this sentence makes quite a statement."

It seems silly to go through this trouble when pronouns will suffice (and when they make more sense to the casual reader), but in systems of [[mathematical logic]], there is generally no analog of the pronoun. It is somewhat surprising, in fact, that self-reference can be achieved at all in these systems.

Upon closer inspection, it can be seen that in fact, the [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] example above uses a [[quine (computing)|quine]], and f(x) is actually the quine function itself.

Indirect self-reference was studied in great depth by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]] (after whom the operation above is named), and occupies a central place in the proof of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]].  Among the paradoxical statements developed by Quine is the following:

 "yields a false statement when preceded by its quotation" yields a false statement when preceded by its quotation

[[File:St. Machar's Cathedral tower, Aberdeen.jpg|right|220px|thumb|St Machar's Cathedral, where '''Barbour''' was [[Archdeacon#Catholic Church|archdeacon]].]]

'''John Barbour''' (c.1320 &amp;ndash; 13 March [[1395 in poetry|1395]]) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] poet and the first major named literary figure to write in [[Scots language|Scots]]. His principal surviving work is the historical verse romance, ''[[The Brus]]'' (''The [[Robert I of Scotland|Bruce]]''), and his reputation from this poem is such that other long works in Scots which survive from the period are sometimes thought to be by him. He is known to have written a number of other works, but other titles definitely ascribed to his authorship, such as ''The Stewartis Oryginalle'' (''Genealogy of the [[House of Stuart|Stewarts]]'') and ''The Brut'' (''[[Brutus of Troy|Brutus]]''), are now lost.

Barbour was latterly Archdeacon of the [[St Machar's Cathedral|Kirk of St Machar]] in Aberdeen. He also studied in [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Paris|Paris]]. Although he was a man of the church, his surviving writing is strongly [[secular]] in both tone and themes. His principal patron was [[Robert II of Scotland|Robert II]] and evidence of his promotion and movements before Robert Stewart came to power as king tend to suggest that Barbour acted politically on the future king's behalf.&lt;ref name="Duncaned"&gt;A.A.M.Duncan (ed.), ''[[The Bruce]]'' Canongate Classics, 1999 edition. "Introduction", pp.2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in 1395, probably in [[Aberdeen]].

==Life==
[[File:Robert II (Alba) ii.JPG|right|170px|thumb|[[Robert II of Scotland]], '''Barbour's''' royal patron.]]

John Barbour may have been born around 1320 if the record of his age in 1375 as 55 is correct. His birthplace is not known, though [[Aberdeenshire (traditional)|Aberdeenshire]] and [[Galloway]] have made rival claims.

Barbour's first appearance in the historical record comes in 1356 with promotion to the [[archdeaconry]] of Aberdeen from a post he had held for less than a year in [[Dunkeld Cathedral]]. It is inferred from this that he was also present in [[Avignon papacy|Avignon]] in 1355.&lt;ref name="Duncaned" /&gt; In 1357, when [[David II of Scotland|David II]] returned to Scotland from exile and was restored to active kingship, Barbour received a letter of safe-conduct to travel through England to the [[University of Oxford]]. He subsequently appears to have left the country in other years coincidental with periods when David II was active king.

After the death of David II in 1371, Barbour served in the royal court of Robert II in a number of capacities. It was during this time that he composed, ''The Brus'', receiving for this in 1377 the gift of ten [[pounds Scots]], and in 1378 a life-pension of twenty shillings. He held various posts in the king's household. In 1372 he was one of the auditors of [[exchequer]] and in 1373 a clerk of audit.

The only biographical evidence for his closing years is his signature as a witness to sindry deeds in the "Register of Aberdeen" in 1392. According to the obit-book of [[St Machar's Cathedral]], [[Aberdeen]] he died on 13 March 1395 and state records show that his life-pension was not paid after that date. Barbour made provision for a [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] to be sung for himself and his parents, an instruction that was observed in the [[St Machar's Cathedral|Kirk of St Machar]] until the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].

==Works==

===The Brus===
{{main|The Brus}}
[[File:Barbour's The Bruce.JPG|thumb|An 18thC edition of [[The Brus]] in the National Museum of Scotland]]
[[File:John Barbour.JPG|right|210px|thumb|The sentiment underlying the poem.]]
''[[The Brus]]'', Barbour's major surviving work, is a long [[narrative poem]] written while he was a member of the king's household in the 1370s. Its subject is the ultimate success of the prosecution of the [[First War of Scottish Independence]]. Its principal focus is [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]] and [[James Douglas, Lord of Douglas|Sir James Douglas]], but the second half of the poem also features actions of Robert II's [[House of Stuart|Stewart]] forebears in the conflict.

Barbour's purpose in the poem was partly historical and partly patriotic. He celebrates The Bruce (Robert I) and Douglas throughout as the flowers of Scottish [[chivalry]]. The poem opens with a description of the state of [[Scotland]] at the death of [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]] (1286) and concludes (more or less) with the death of Douglas and the burial of the Bruce's [[Human heart|heart]] (1332). Its central episode is the [[Battle of Bannockburn]].

[[Patriotic]] as the sentiment is, this is expressed in more general terms than is found in later [[Scottish literature]]. In the poem, Robert I's character is a hero of the chivalric type common in contemporary romance, [[Free will|Freedom]] is a "noble thing" to be sought and won at all costs, and the opponents of such freedom are shown in the dark colours which history and poetic propriety require, but there is none of the complacency of the merely provincial habit of mind.

Barbour's style in the poem is vigorous, his line generally fluid and quick, and there are passages of high merit. The most quoted part is Book 1, lines 225-228:

:A! fredome is a noble thing! 
:Fredome mayss man to haiff liking; 
:Fredome all solace to man giffis: 
:He levys at ess that frely levys!

===Stewartis Oryginalle===
One of Barbour's known lost work is ''The Stewartis Oryginalle'' which is described as having traced the [[Robert II of Scotland#Ancestry|genealogy of the Stewarts]]. The Stewart name replaced that of Bruce in the Scottish royal line when Robert II acceded to the throne after the death of [[David II of Scotland|David II]], his uncle.

Robert II was Barbour's royal [[patron]]. It is not known how the work came to be lost.

===Buik of Alexander===
Attempts have been made to name Barbour as the author of the ''[[Buik of Alexander]]'', a Scots translation of the ''[[Roman d'Alexandre]]'' and other associated pieces. This translation borrows much from ''The Brus''. It survives and is known to us from the unique edition printed in [[Edinburgh]], c. 1580, by [[Alexander Arbuthnot (printer)|Alexander Arbuthnot]].

===Legends of the Saints===
Another possible work was added to Barbour's canon with the discovery in the library of the [[University of Cambridge]], by [[Henry Bradshaw (scholar)|Henry Bradshaw]], of a long Scots poem of over 33,000 lines, dealing with [[Legends of the Saints]], as told in the ''[[Legenda Aurea]]'' and other legendaries. The general likeness of this poem to Barbour's accepted work in verse-length, [[dialect]] and style, and the facts that the lives of [[England|English]] saints are excluded and those of [[St. Machar]] (the patron saint of [[Aberdeen, Scotland|Aberdeen]]) and [[St. Ninian]] are inserted, make this ascription plausible. Later criticism, though divided, has tended in the contrary direction, and has based its strongest negative judgment on the consideration of rhymes, assonance and vocabulary.

==Legacy==
As "father" of Scots poetry, Barbour holds a place in the Scotland's literary tradition similar to the position often given to [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]], his slightly later contemporary, ''vis a vis'' the vernacular tradition in [[England]]. If he truly was the author of the five or six long works in Scots which different witnesses ascribe to him, then he would have been one of the most voluminous writers of [[Early Scots]], if not the most voluminous of all Scots poets. But his authorship of ''The Brus'' alone, both for its original employment of the chivalric genre, and as a tale of a struggle against tyranny,&lt;ref&gt;A.A.M.Duncan (ed.), ''[[The Bruce]]'' Canongate Classics, 1999 edition. "Preface", p.vii&lt;/ref&gt; secures his place as an important and innovative literary voice who broke new linguistic ground.

'''Jonas Carl Greenfield''' (October 20, 1926 in [[New York City]] – March 13, 1995 in [[Jerusalem]]) was a scholar of [[Semitic languages]], who published in the fields of Semitic [[Epigraphy]], [[Aramaic]] Studies and [[Dead Sea Scrolls|Qumran Studies]].

Greenfield studied at [[Yale University|Yale]], receiving a [[Master of Arts]] in 1951 and his [[doctorate]] in 1956 (with a dissertation on "The Lexical Status of Mishnaic Hebrew"). He taught at [[Brandeis University]] (1954–56), [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (1956–1965), the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (1965–71), and the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] (1971–1995). In 1990 he became Caspar Levias Professor of Ancient Semitic Languages at the [[Hebrew University]].

He was a member of the committee of translators of the ''[[Ketuvim]]'' (the "Writings") for the New [[Jewish Publication Society|JPS]] Translation of the [[Tanakh]].&lt;ref&gt;''The New JPS Translation of the Tanakh'', (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society 1985), p.xxvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 a [[festschrift]] was published in his honor, ''Solving Riddles and Untying Knots. Biblical, Epigraphic, and Semitic Studies in Honor of Jonas C. Greenfield''.&lt;ref&gt;''Solving Riddles and Untying Knots. Biblical, Epigraphic, and Semitic Studies in Honor of Jonas C. Greenfield'',  ed. Z. Zevit, S. Gitin, and M. Sokoloff (Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbraun's, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 the [[American Oriental Society]] established a prize to honor his memory, the "Jonas C. Greenfield Prize For Younger Semitists".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umich.edu/~aos/greenfield.html Jonas C. Greenfield Prize For Younger Semitists]&lt;/ref&gt; The Orion Center for the Study of the Dead Sea Scrolls and Associated Literature, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, has held the ''Jonas C. Greenfield Scholars’ Seminar'' since 1999. Israel Exploration Journal 45 no. 2-3 (1995) 61-200 was issued as the "Jonas C. Greenfield Memorial Volume." Obituaries, in addition to the latter, pages 83–84, include [[Ziony Zevit]], Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research 298 (May 1995) 3-5 and Mark S. Smith, American Schools of Oriental Research Newsletter 45 no, 1 (Spring 1995) 1-2. For an appreciation of his work on Qumran and related texts see [[Baruch A. Levine]], "The Contribution of Jonas Greenfield to the Study of Dead Sea Literature." Dead Sea Discoveries, Vol. 3, No. 1 (Mar., 1996), pp.&amp;nbsp;2–9

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4638">'''Joseph Mundassery''' (17 July 1903  – 25 October 1977) was a literary critic and Indian politician from [[Kerala]] state. He specialised in the Malayalam language and literature. In [[politics of Kerala|Kerala politics]], he is remembered as the Education Minister who was behind the controversial [[Kerala Education Bill, 1957|Education Bill]] of the first EMS communist ministry of 1957.

==Early life==
Joseph Mundassery was born at Kandassankadavu, [[Thrissur]]. After his schooling locally he took his bachelor's degree in Physics and later the master's degree in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Malayalam]]. Until 1952, he was the Head of the Department of Foreign Languages at St. Thomas College, Trichur.

Mundassery entered politics through the [[Kochi rajya prajamandalam|Kochi Prajamandalam]] and was elected as a Member of the Legislative Council (MLC) of the princely state of [[Kingdom of Cochin|Cochin]] in 1948 from the constituency of Aranattukara. Later on he became an MLC in the [[Travancore-Cochin]] Assembly in 1954, from Cherpu.

After the formation of the state of Kerala in 1956, he won the Assembly election in 1957, from Manaloor, and went on to become Kerala’s first Education Minister (1957–59) in the EMS Communist ministry. Finally, in 1970, he was elected as an MLA from Trichur constituency.

==A doyen of letters and a cultural leader==
As a prominent figure in the field of Malayalam [[literary criticism]], Mundassery was one among a well-known trio of Malayalam critics, the others being [[Kesari Balakrishna Pillai]] and [[M. P. Paul]].

Through his controversial theory about Rooparbhadrata – formal excellence – Mundassery ushered in a new chapter of literary [[hermeneutics]], which was unheard of in [[Malayalam]] until then. According to the theory the proclaimed aim of the author would inevitably lead to [[intentional fallacy]], and that an author should be evaluated on more objective criteria like his role as a spokesman of his age.

He was the President of the Kerala Sahithya Parishad 1965-67, executive (and founding) member of the Kerala Sahithya Academy. He was also instrumental in establishing the Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Academy and was a member of the Kendra Sahithya Academy.

==As an educationist==
Mundassery’s notability as an educationist rests partly to the reforms that he partially succeeded in bringing about in the educational sector in Kerala when he was the Education Minister. He authored the controversial [[Kerala Education Bill, 1957|Education Bill]] of the First communist ministry of Kerala. To a great extent the proposed bill directly led to the snowballing of the [[Vimochana Samaram]] and the subsequent downfall of the [[E.M.S. Namboodiripad]]'s first communist ministry in 1959.

Even though the Bill failed to pass through the Assembly, many of its provisions were later implemented by subsequent governments, albeit with amendments. As the Education Minister of the first democratically elected ministry of the newly formed State of Kerala, Mundassery was instrumental in the establishment and restructuring of some of the early universities and prime educational institutions of the state, having had experience as the [[Vice Chancellor]] of the [[Cochin University of Science and Technology]].

Mundassery was the guru of many pupils at St. Thomas College, Trichur, among whom were some of the future leaders of Kerala such as [[C. Achutha Menon]] and [[Mathai Manjooran]].

Mundassery died in 1977.

'''Kallawaya''', also '''Callahuaya''' or '''Callawalla''' is an [[Endangered language|endangered]], secret, [[mixed language]] in [[Bolivia]]. It is spoken by the [[Kallawaya people]], a group of traditional itinerant healers in the [[Andes]] in their medicinal healing practice.

==Characteristics==
Kallawaya is a mixed language.  The grammar is partially [[Quechua language|Quechua]] in morphology, but most of its words are from either unknown sources or from an otherwise extinct language family, [[Pukina language|Pukina]].  Pukina was abandoned in favor of Quechua, [[Aymara language|Aymara]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref name=Advances&gt;{{cite web |url=http://52ica.etnolinguistica.org/adelaar |title=The Puquina and Leko languages |accessdate=2007-09-19 |author=Willem Adelaar |author2=Simon van de Kerke |website=Symposium: Advances in Native South American Historical Linguistics, July 17–18, 2006, at the 52nd [[International Congress of Americanists]], Seville, Spain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kallawaya is also a secret language, passed only by father to son, or grandfather to grandson, or rarely, to daughters if a practitioner has no sons. It is not used in normal family dialogue. Although its use is primarily ritual, used secretly for initiated men, Kallawaya may be a part of everyday conversation between those familiar with it.&lt;ref name=secret&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livingtongues.org/kallawaya.html |title=The Kallawaya Language Project |accessdate=2007-09-19 |format=online |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929224417/http://www.livingtongues.org/kallawaya.html |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kallawaya was one of the subjects of [[Ironbound Films]]' 2008 American documentary film ''[[The Linguists]]'', in which two linguists attempted to [[Language documentation|document]] several [[moribund language]]s.&lt;ref name=hollywood&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/awards_festivals/fest_reviews/article_display.jsp?&amp;rid=10471 |title=The Linguists |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |last=Honeycutt |first=Kirk |date=18 January 2008 |accessdate=22 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121013020/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/awards_festivals/fest_reviews/article_display.jsp?&amp;rid=10471 |archivedate=November 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolivians refer to the region where the speakers live as "Qollahuayas," meaning "place of the medicines", because the Kallawaya are renowned herbalists. Since they treat or cure with plants, minerals, animal products, and rituals, peasants refer to the speakers as "Qolla kapachayuh", meaning "lords of the medicine bag".

The '''Chinese Korean language''' ({{Korean|context=north|hanja=中國朝鮮말|hangul=중국조선말|rr=Jungguk Joseonmal}}, {{Literal translation|China [[Joseon]] language}}) is the variety of the [[Korean language]] spoken by [[Koreans in China|Ethnic Koreans]] in [[China]], primarily located in [[Heilongjiang]], [[Jilin]] and [[Liaoning]].

All [[Korean dialects|varieties of Korean]] except the [[Jeju language]] are spoken by members of the [[Korean diaspora]] who settled in China before 1949. The educational standard is the [[North Korean standard language]].

Chinese Korean vocabulary is significantly similar to the North Korean standard, as is orthography; a major exception of orthography is that the spelling of some Chinese cities is different (for example, [[Beijing]] is called by the Hanja reading of 北京, {{lang|ko|북경}} ''Bukgyeong'', rather than the South Korean transcription of Mandarin ''Beijing'', {{lang|ko|베이징}}); exceptions of vocabulary are all related to China.

==Background==

===Language standardisation===

Due to the People's Republic of China having maintained favorable relations with North Korea, and also the proximity of the two nations, the standardised dialect of Korean amongst Chinese-Koreans is similar to that of North Korea.
&lt;!--중국조선말에 관한 망라적인 언어 규범은 동북3성조선어문사업협의소조({{zh|s=东北三省朝鲜语文工作协作小组}})가 1977년에 작성한 ‘조선말규범집’이 처음이다. 이 규범집에는 표준발음법, 맞춤법, 띄어쓰기, 문장부호에 관한 규범이 수록되었다. ‘조선말규범집’은 어휘에 관한 규범을 덧붙이고, 일부를 가필 수정한 개정판이 1984년에 만들어졌다.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|zh|东北三省朝鲜语文工作协作小组办公室}}（1985）“{{lang|zh|朝鲜语规范集}}”，{{lang|zh|延边人民出版社}}&lt;/ref&gt;

중국조선말은 1949년 [[중화인민공화국]] 건국 이래, [[조선민주주의인민공화국|조선민주주의인민공화국]](이하 ‘북한’)의 언어에 규범의 토대를 두어 왔다. 그러한 경위가 있어 중국조선말의 언어 규범은 모두 북한의 규범([[조선말규범집]] 등)과 거의 동일하다. 따라서 만약에 이 규범을 가지고 중국조선말의 ‘표준어’를 규정할 수 있다면 그 ‘표준어’는 북한의 [[문화어]]에 한없이 가까운 것이라 할 수 있다.

하지만 한중수교 이후에는 [[대한민국]]으로부터 진출한 기업이나 한국어 교육 기관의 영향력이 커짐에 따라 남한식 한국어의 사용이 확대되고 있다.--&gt;

===Regional variations===
{{empty section|date=October 2012}}
&lt;!--현실적으로 [[조선족]] 사이에서 사용되는 조선어는 균질적인 것이 아니라 아주 다양하다. 조선족은 [[조선 시대]]부터 [[일제 강점기]] 시대에 걸쳐 조선반도북부를 중심으로 조선반도각지에서 만주지역으로 이주했다. 일반적으로 [[함경도]] 출신자들은 [[두만강]] 건너편인 [[지린 성|길림성]]으로 가고, [[평안도]] 출신자들은 [[압록강]] 건너편인 [[랴오닝 성|료녕성]]으로 가는 경우 많았기 때문에 길림성에서는 함경도의 방언적 특징이 강하게 남아 있고 료녕성에서는 평안도의 방언적 특징이 강하게 남아 있다. 한국어의 방언과 각 지역의 관계는 대략 아래와 같다.

*동북(함경도) 방언 : [[지린 성|길림성]] [[옌볜 조선족 자치주|연변조선족자치주]], [[헤이룽장 성|흑룡강성]] [[무단장|목단강]] 시 등. 연변의 두만강 연안 동부 지역은 육진 방언이다.
*서북(평안도) 방언 : [[랴오닝 성|료녕성]] 중부,동부;[[지린 성|길림성]] 남부.
*[[동남 방언|동남(경상도) 방언]] : [[옌볜 조선족 자치주|연변조선족자치주]]를 제외한 [[지린 성|길림성]] 기타 지방, 흑룡강성 서북부와 서남부,료녕성 일부.

중부 방언과 서남(전라도) 방언은 큰 사용 지역이 없고 동북 각성에 산재하고 있다. 중부 방언 지역으로서 [[길림성]] 유하현 강가점향 경기둔(吉林省 柳河県 姜家店郷 京畿屯)을 들며, 서남 방언 지역으로서 [[길림성]] 교하현 천북향 영진촌(吉林省 蛟河県 天北郷 永進村)을 들 수 있다.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|zh|宣德五}}・{{lang|zh|金祥元}}・{{lang|zh|赵习}}（1985）“{{lang|zh|朝鲜语简志}}”，{{lang|zh|民族出版社}}&lt;/ref&gt;제주도 방언의 사용 지역은 보이지 않는다.--&gt;

==Characteristics==
===Phonetics===
{{empty section|date=October 2012}}
&lt;!--서남 방언 지역에서는 단모음 {{IPA|[ø]}}(ㅚ)와 {{IPA|[y]}}(ㅟ)를 가지며 동남 방언 지역에서는 {{IPA|[ɛ]}}(ㅐ)와 {{IPA|[e]}}(ㅔ)가 구별되지 않는다. 중국조선말은 일반적으로 한반도북부 방언의 영향력이 강하여 일부의 /ㅈ/, /ㅊ/, /ㅉ/이 /ㄷ/, /ㅌ/, /ㄸ/으로 나타나거나 모음 /i/, 반모음 /j/에 앞선 /ㄴ/이 어두에 올 수 있는 등 북부 방언의 특징들을 잘 간직한다.

또 동북 방언, 동남 방언 지역에서는 변별적인 고저 [[악센트]](이른바 ‘성조’)를 가지며 소리의 높낮이로 단어의 뜻을 구별한다.--&gt;

===Grammar===
The [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] "-ᆸ니까/-습니까" in Standard Korean is rendered as "-ᆷ둥/-슴둥" in dialects of Korean spoken in Northeastern Jilin, and "-ᆷ니꺼/-심니꺼" in dialects spoken in Southwestern Heilongjiang.

At the same time, there are grammatical influences from [[Standard Chinese]], for example:
*전화를 치다 "make a phone call" (Standard Korean: 전화를 걸다). In Chinese, the same sentence [[wikt:打|打]]电话 literally means to physically "hit" a telephone, hence the word 치다, "to hit", is used to describe making a phone call.
*무엇을 주면 무엇을 먹는다 "eat whatever is given" (Standard Korean: 주는 것은 다 먹는다)

===Vocabulary===
Vocabulary is another differentiating factor in comparison with other varieties of Korean, with usage of words such as 개구리 and 개구락지 (frog). As a result of Chinese influence, there are many words that arise from Modern Standard Chinese.

Some words arise from the ''[[Hanja#Eumhun|eum]]'' pronunciation of [[hanja]], for example 공인 (工人, worker) and 판공실 (辦公室, office).

{{IPA notice}}
'''Latin spelling''', or '''Latin orthography''', is the spelling of [[Latin]] words written in the scripts of all historical phases of Latin from [[Old Latin]] to the present. All scripts use the same alphabet, but conventional spellings may vary from phase to phase. The Roman alphabet, or [[Latin alphabet]], was adapted from the [[Old Italic script]] to represent the [[phoneme]]s of the Latin language. The Old Italic script had in turn been borrowed from the [[Greek alphabet]], itself adapted from the [[Phoenician alphabet]].
The Latin alphabet most resembles the Greek alphabet around 540 BC, as it appears on the red-figures pottery of the time. [[File:Athena aigis Cdm Paris 254.jpg|thumb|upright=1.36]]

'''Latin pronunciation''' continually evolved over the centuries, making it difficult for speakers in one era to know how Latin was spoken in prior eras. A given phoneme may be represented by different letters in different periods. This article deals primarily with modern scholarship's best reconstruction of [[Classical Latin]]'s phonemes ([[phonology]]) and the pronunciation and spelling used by educated people in the late Republic. This article then touches upon later changes and other variants.

==Letterforms==
[[File:I littera in manuscripto.jpg|thumb|upright=1.36|A papyrus fragment in [[Roman cursive]] with portions of speeches delivered in the [[Roman Senate]]]]
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2009}}
The forms of the Latin alphabet used during the Classical period did not distinguish between [[letter case|upper case and lower case]]. Roman [[epigraphy|inscriptions]] typically use [[Roman square capitals]], which resemble modern capitals, and [[handwriting|handwritten text]] often uses old [[Roman cursive]], which includes [[letterform]]s similar to modern lowercase.

This article uses [[small caps]] for Latin text, representing Roman square capitals, and long vowels are marked with acutes, representing apices. In the tables below, Latin letters and digraphs are paired with the phonemes they usually represent in the International Phonetic Alphabet.

==Letters and phonemes==
In ancient Latin spelling, individual letters mostly corresponded to individual phonemes, with three main exceptions:
# The vowel letters ''a'', ''e'', ''i'', ''o'', ''u'', ''y'' represented both short and long vowels. The long vowels were often marked by [[apex (diacritic)|apices]] during the Classical period ⟨Á É Ó V́ Ý⟩, and long i was written using a taller version ⟨I⟩, called [[Long I|i longa]] "long I": ⟨ꟾ⟩;&lt;ref name="Sihler alphabet"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sihler|1995|pp=20–22|loc=§25: the Italic alphabets}}&lt;/ref&gt; but now long vowels are sometimes written with a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] in modern editions (''ā''), while short vowels are marked with a breve (''ă'') in dictionaries when necessary.
# Some pairs of vowel letters, such as ''ae'', represented either a diphthong in one syllable or two vowels in adjacent syllables.
# The letters ''i'' and ''u - v'' represented either the close vowels {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} or the semivowels {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/w/}}.

In the tables below, Latin letters and digraphs are paired with the phonemes that they usually represent in the International Phonetic Alphabet.

===Consonants===
This is a table of the consonant sounds of Classical Latin. Sounds in parentheses are allophones, sounds with an asterisk exist mainly in loanwords and sounds with a dagger (†) are phonemes only in some analyses.

====Notes on phonetics====
* The labialized velar stops {{IPA|/kʷ/}} and {{IPA|/ɡʷ/}} may both have been single phonemes rather than clusters like the {{IPA|/kw/}} and {{IPA|/ɡw/}} in English ''quick'' and ''penguin''. {{IPA|/kʷ/}} is more likely to have been a phoneme than {{IPA|/ɡʷ/}}. {{IPA|/kʷ/}} occurs between vowels and counts as a single consonant in Classical Latin poetry, but {{IPA|/ɡʷ/}} occurs only after {{IPA|[ŋ]}}, where it cannot be identified as a single or double consonant.&lt;ref name="Allen gm and gw"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA|/kʷ/}} and {{IPA|[ɡʷ]}} were palatalized before a front vowel, becoming {{IPA|[kᶣ]}} and {{IPA|[ɡᶣ]}}, as in ''quī'' {{IPA|[kᶣiː]}} {{audio|La-cls-qui.ogg|listen}} compared with ''quod'' {{IPA|[kʷɔd]}}, and ''lingua'' {{IPA|[ˈlɪŋ.ɡʷa]}} compared with ''pinguis'' {{IPA|[ˈpɪŋ.ɡᶣɪs]}}. This sound change did not apply to {{IPA|/w/}} in the same position: ''uī - vī'' {{IPA|[wiː]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{IPA|/kʷ ɡʷ/}} before {{IPA|/u/}} may have become {{IPA|[k ɡ]}} by [[dissimilation]].{{how|date=March 2015|title=I can see how quinque experienced dissimilation, but how equus? answer: kʷ→[-labial] / __ v[+labial] as in the case of cum from older quom}} This is suggested by the fact that ''equus'' {{IPA|[ˈɛ.kʷʊs]}} and ''unguunt'' {{IPA|[ˈʊŋ.ɡʷʊnt]}} (Old Latin equos and unguont) are spelled ''ecus'' and ''ungunt'', which may have indicated the pronunciations {{IPA|[ˈɛ.kʊs]}} and {{IPA|[ˈʊŋ.ɡʊnt]}}. These spellings may, however, simply indicate that ''c g'' before ''u'' were labialized like {{IPA|/kʷ ɡʷ/}}, so that writing a double ''uu'' was redundant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|pp=19, 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The voiceless plosives {{IPA|/p t k kʷ/}} in Latin were likely less aspirated than voiceless plosives at the beginning of words in English; for example, Latin {{IPA|/k/}} was not as strongly aspirated as ''k'' in ''kind'' but more like ''k'' in English ''sky'' or ''look''. However, there was no phonemic contrast between voiceless and aspirated plosives in native Latin words, and the voiceless plosives were probably somewhat aspirated at the beginnings of words and near {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/l/}}.&lt;ref name="aspirate1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|pp=26, 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aspirate2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Clackson|Horrocks|2007|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Greek words beginning with the voiceless plosives {{IPA|/p t k/}}, when they were borrowed into colloquial Latin, were spelled with the graphemes used to represent voiced plosives ''b d g'' {{IPA|/b d ɡ/}}, e.g., Latin ''gubernator'' besides West Greek {{lang|grc|κυβερνάτας}} {{IPA|[kʉbernaːtaːs]}} (helmsman). That suggests that Latin speakers felt the Greek voiceless plosives to sound less aspirated than their own native equivalents.&lt;ref name="tenues"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|pp=12, 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The aspirated consonants {{IPA|/pʰ tʰ kʰ/}} as distinctive phonemes were originally foreign to Latin, appearing in educated loanwords and names from Greek. In such cases, the aspiration was likely produced only by educated speakers.&lt;ref name="aspirate1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aspirate2" /&gt;
* {{IPA|/z/}} was also not native to Classical Latin. It appeared in Greek loanwords starting around the first century BC, when it was probably pronounced {{IPA|[z]}} initially and [[gemination|doubled]] {{IPA|[zz]}} between vowels, in contrast to [[Ancient Greek|Classical Greek]] {{IPA|[dz]}} or {{IPA|[zd]}}. In Classical Latin poetry, the letter {{angbr|{{sqc|z}}}} between vowels always counts as two consonants for metrical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Levy|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen Z"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|pp=45, 46}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Classical Latin, the coronal sibilant {{IPA|/s/}} was likely unvoiced in all positions. In Old Latin, single {{IPA|/s/}} between vowels was pronounced as voiced {{IPAblink|z}} but had changed to {{IPA|/r/}} by [[Rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]] by the time of Classical Latin, as in ''gerō'' {{IPA|/ˈɡe.roː/}} as compared with ''gestus'' {{IPA|/ˈɡes.tus/}}. Intervocalic {{IPA|/s/}} in Classical usually derives from an earlier double {{IPA|/ss/}} after a long vowel or diphthong, as in ''causa'', ''cāsus'' from earlier ''caussa'', ''cāssus'';&lt;ref name="Allen s"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|pp=35–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; or from loanwords, such as ''pausa'' from Greek {{lang|grc|παῦσις}} (''pausis'').{{citation needed|reason=This is probably accurate, but Allen mentions that pausa and some other examples have intervocalic single -s- not from double -ss- without noting why they have it.|date=January 2015}}
*In Old Latin, final {{IPA|/s/}} after a short vowel was often lost, probably after first changing to {{IPA|[h]}} ([[debuccalization]]), as in the inscriptional form ''Cornelio'' for ''Cornelios'' (Classical Latin ''Cornelius''). Often in the poetry of [[Plautus]], [[Ennius]], and [[Lucretius]], final {{IPA|/s/}} before a word beginning in a consonant did not make the preceding syllable heavy.&lt;ref name="Allen s" /&gt;
* {{IPA|/f/}} was [[labiodental]] in Classical Latin, but it may have been [[bilabial]] {{IPA|[ɸ]}} in Old Latin,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|pp=34, 35}}&lt;/ref&gt; or perhaps {{IPA|[ɸ]}} in free variation with {{IPA|[f]}}. Lloyd, Sturtevant, and Kent make this argument based on certain misspellings in inscriptions, the Proto-Indo-European phone {{PIE|*bʰ}} from which many instances of the Latin ''f'' descended (others are from {{PIE|*dʰ}} and {{PIE|*gʷʰ}}) and the way the sound appears to have behaved in Vulgar Latin, particularly in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lloyd|1987|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In most cases {{IPA|/m/}} was pronounced as a bilabial nasal. At the end of a word, however, it was generally lost beginning in Old Latin (except when another nasal or a plosive followed it), causing the preceding vowel to be lengthened and [[nasal vowel|nasalized]],&lt;ref name="Lloyd 81" /&gt; as in ''decem'' {{IPA|[ˈdɛ.kẽː]}} {{audio|La-cls-decem.ogg|listen}}. In Old Latin inscriptions, it is often omitted, as in ''viro'' for ''virom'' (Classical ''virum''). It was frequently elided before a following vowel in [[Latin poetry]], and it was lost without a trace (apart from the lengthening) in the Romance languages,&lt;ref name="Allen -Vm"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|pp=30, 31}}&lt;/ref&gt; except in monosyllabic words.
* {{IPA|/n/}} [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilated]] to {{IPA|/m/}} before labial consonants as in ''impar'' {{IPA|[ˈɪm.par]}} {{audio|La-cls-impar.ogg|listen}} &lt; *in-par, to {{IPA|[ɱ]}} before {{IPA|/f/}} (if it did not represent nasalization) and to {{IPA|[ŋ]}} before velar consonants, as in ''quīnque'' {{IPA|[ˈkᶣiːŋ.kᶣɛ]}} {{audio|La-cls-quinque.ogg|listen}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lloyd|1987|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assimilation likely also occurred between the preposition ''in'' and a following word: ''in causā'' {{IPA|[ɪŋ ˈkau̯.saː]}}, ''in pace'' {{IPA|[ɪm ˈpa.kɛ]}}.&lt;ref name="Allen n"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|pp=27–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/ɡ/}} assimilated to a [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|[ŋ]}} before {{IPA|/n/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|pp=23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen and [[James B. Greenough|Greenough]] say that a vowel before {{IPA|[ŋn]}} is always long,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|Greenough|2001|loc=§10d}}&lt;/ref&gt; but W. Sidney Allen says that is based on an [[interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolation]] in [[Priscian]], and the vowel was actually long or short depending on the root, as for example ''rēgnum'' {{IPA|[ˈreːŋ.nũː]}} from the root of ''rēx'' {{IPA|[reːks]}}, but ''magnus'' {{IPA|[ˈmaŋ.nʊs]}} from the root of ''magis'' {{IPA|[ˈma.ɡɪs]}}.&lt;ref name="Vgn"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|pp=71–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA|/ɡ/}} probably did not assimilate to {{IPA|[ŋ]}} before {{IPA|/m/}}. The cluster {{IPA|/ɡm/}} arose by [[syncope (phonetics)|syncope]], as for example ''tegmen'' {{IPA|[ˈtɛɡ.mɛn]}} from ''tegimen''. Original {{IPA|/ɡm/}} developed into {{IPA|/mm/}} in ''flamma'', from the root of ''flagrō''.&lt;ref name="Allen gm and gw" /&gt; At the start of a word, {{IPA|[ŋn]}} was reduced to {{IPA|[n]}},{{cn|date=April 2017}} and this change was reflected in the orthography in later texts: ''gnātus'' {{IPA|[ˈnaː.tʊs]}} became ''nātus'', ''gnōscō'' {{IPA|[ˈnoː.skoː]}} became ''nōscō''.
* In Classical Latin, the [[rhotic consonant|rhotic]] {{IPA|/r/}} was most likely an [[alveolar trill]] {{IPA|[r]}}. [[Gaius Lucilius]] likens it to the sound of a dog, and later writers describe it as being produced by vibration. In Old Latin, intervocalic {{IPA|/z/}} developed into {{IPA|/r/}} (rhotacism), suggesting an approximant like the English {{IPAblink|ɹ}}, and {{IPA|/d/}} was sometimes written as {{IPA|/r/}}, suggesting a tap {{IPAblink|ɾ}} like Spanish single ''r''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/l/}} had two allophones in Latin: {{IPA|[l]}} and {{IPA|[ɫ]}}. Roman grammarians called these variants ''exīlis'' ('thin') and ''plēnus'' or ''pinguis'' ('full' or 'thick'). Those adjectives are used elsewhere for [[front vowel|front]] and [[back vowel]]s respectively, which suggests that the "thin" allophone was a plain [[alveolar lateral approximant]] {{IPA|[l]}}, like the clear {{IPA|/l/}} in English ''leaf'' in some English dialects or that of languages like [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[German language|German]], while the "full" or "thick" allophone was [[velarized alveolar lateral approximant|velarized]] like the English dark {{IPA|/l/}} in ''full''. It is partly uncertain where these allophones occurred. Sihler and Allen agree that {{IPA|/l/}} was clear when the sound was doubled as {{IPA|/ll/}}, and dark when it occurred before another consonant or at the end of a word, but disagree on whether clear or dark ''l'' occurred before vowels. Sihler says that {{IPA|/l/}} was clear before {{IPA|/i/}} and dark before other vowels, but Allen says that {{IPA|/l/}} was dark before back vowels in pre-Classical Latin and clear before both front and back vowels in Classical Latin.  This represents a partial agreement, however, in that Sihler argues the Classical Latin {{IPA|/l/}} had three degrees of velarization, with a darker enunciation before consonants than vowels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|pp=33, 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sihler|1995|p=174|loc=§176 a: allophones of ''l'' in Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/j/}} generally appeared only at the beginning of words, before a vowel, as in ''iaceō'' {{IPA|/ˈja.kɛ.oː/}}, except in compound words such as ''adiaceō'' {{IPA|/adˈja.kɛ.oː/}} {{audio|La-cls-iaceo, adiaceo.ogg|listen}}. Between vowels, this sound was generally not found as a single consonant, only as doubled {{IPA|/jː/}}, as in ''cuius'' {{IPA|/ˈkuj.jus/}} {{audio|La-cls-cuius.ogg|listen}}, except in compound words such as ''trāiectus'' {{IPA|/traːˈjek.tus/}}. {{IPA|/j/}} varied with {{IPA|/i/}} in the same [[morpheme]] in ''iam'' {{IPA|/jãː/}} and ''etiam'' {{IPA|/ˈe.ti.ãː/}}, and in poetry, one could be replaced with the other for the purposes of [[metre (poetry)|meter]].&lt;ref name="Allen j"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|pp=37–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/w/}} was pronounced as an approximant until the first century AD, when {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/b/}} began to develop into fricatives. In poetry, {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} could be replaced with each other, as in {{IPA|/ˈsi.lu.a/}} for ''silva'' {{IPA|/ˈsil.wa/}} and {{IPA|/ˈɡen.wa/}} for ''genua'' {{IPA|/ˈɡe.nu.a/}}. Unlike {{IPA|/j/}}, it was not doubled as {{IPA|/wː/}} or {{IPA|/ww/}} between vowels, except in Greek loanwords: ''cavē'' {{IPA|/ˈka.weː/}}, but ''Evander'' {{IPA|/ewˈwan.der/}} from {{lang|grc|Εὔανδρος}}.&lt;ref name="Allen v"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|pp=40–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Notes on spelling====
* Doubled consonant letters, such as ''cc'', ''ss'', represented [[gemination|geminated]] (doubled or long) consonants: {{IPA|/kː sː/}}. In [[Old Latin]], geminate consonants were written singly like single consonants, until the middle of the 2nd century BC, when they began to be doubled in writing.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''epistula ad tiburtes'', a letter by [[praetor]] Lucius Cornelius from 159 BC, contains the first examples of doubled consonants in the words ''potuisse'', ''esse'', and ''peccatum'' {{Harv|Clackson|Horrocks|2007|pp=147, 149}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Grammarians mention the marking of double consonants with the [[sicilicus]], a diacritic in the shape of a sickle. This mark appears in a few inscriptions of the [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''c'' and ''k'' both represent the velar stop {{IPA|/k/}}; ''qu'' represents the labialized velar stop {{IPA|/kʷ/}}. The letters ''q'' and ''c'' distinguish minimal pairs between {{IPA|/ku/}} and {{IPA|/kʷ/}}, such as ''cui'' {{IPA|/kui̯/}} and ''quī'' {{IPA|/kʷiː/}}.&lt;ref name="ui"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Classical Latin, ''k'' appeared in only a few words, such as ''kalendae''.&lt;ref name="Allen C"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|pp=15, 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''x'' represented the consonant cluster {{IPA|/ks/}}. In Old Latin, this sequence was also spelled as ''ks'', ''cs'', and ''xs''. X was borrowed from the [[Archaic Greek alphabets#Aspirate and consonant cluster symbols|Western Greek alphabet]], in which the [[letterform]] of [[chi (letter)|chi]] Χ was pronounced as {{IPA|/ks/}}. In the [[Greek alphabet|standard Ionic alphabet]], used for modern editions of Ancient Greek, on the other hand, Χ represented {{IPA|/kʰ/}}, and the letter [[xi (letter)|xi]] Ξ represented {{IPA|/ks/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Old Latin inscriptions, {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} were not distinguished. They were both represented by ''c'' before ''e'' and ''i'', ''q'' before ''o'' and ''u'', and ''k'' before consonants and ''a''.&lt;ref name="Sihler alphabet" /&gt; The letterform of ''c'' derives from Greek [[gamma]] Γ, which represented {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, but its use for {{IPA|/k/}} may come from [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], which did not distinguish voiced and voiceless plosives. In Classical Latin, ''c'' represented {{IPA|/ɡ/}} only in ''c'' and ''cn'', the abbreviations of the [[praenomen|praenomina]] (first names) ''Gaius'' and ''Gnaeus''.&lt;ref name="Allen C" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|Greenough|loc=§1a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The letter ''g'' was created in the third century BC to distinguish the voiced {{IPA|/ɡ/}} from voiceless {{IPA|/k/}}.&lt;ref name="OL letters"&gt;{{Harvnb|Clackson|Horrocks|2007|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its letterform derived from ''c'' by the addition of a [[diacritic]] or [[typeface anatomy|stroke]]. [[Plutarch]] attributes this innovation to [[Spurius Carvilius Ruga]] around 230 BC,&lt;ref name="Sihler alphabet" /&gt; but it may have originated with [[Appius Claudius Caecus]]&lt;!-- Allen simply says Appius Claudius in the 4th century BC; Caecus is the only one at that time listed by Wikipedia. Another source would be good. --&gt; in the fourth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The combination ''gn'' probably represented the consonant cluster {{IPA|[ŋn]}}, at least between vowels, as in ''agnus'' {{IPA|[ˈaŋ.nʊs]}} {{audio|La-cls-agnus2.ogg|listen}}.&lt;ref name="Lloyd 81"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lloyd|1987|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vowels before this cluster were sometimes long and sometimes short.&lt;ref name="Vgn" /&gt;
* The digraphs ''ph'', ''th,'' and ''ch'' represented the aspirated plosives {{IPA|/pʰ/}}, {{IPA|/tʰ/}} and {{IPA|/kʰ/}}. They began to be used in writing around 150&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref name="OL letters" /&gt; primarily as a transcription of Greek [[phi]] {{lang|grc|Φ}}, [[theta]] {{lang|grc|Θ}}, and [[Chi (letter)|chi]] {{lang|grc|Χ}}, as in ''Philippus'', ''cithara'', and ''achāia''. Some native words were later also written with these digraphs, such as ''pulcher'', ''lachrima'', ''gracchus'', ''triumphus'', probably representing aspirated allophones of the voiceless plosives near {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/l/}}. Aspirated plosives and the glottal fricative {{IPA|/h/}} were also used [[hypercorrection|hypercorrectively]], an affectation satirized in [[s:Translation:Catullus 84|Catullus 84]].&lt;ref name="aspirate1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aspirate2" /&gt;
* In Old Latin, Koine Greek initial {{IPA|/z/}} and {{IPA|/zz/}} between vowels were represented by ''s'' and ''ss'', as in ''sona'' from {{lang|grc|ζώνη}} and ''massa'' from {{lang|grc|μᾶζα}}. Around the second and first centuries B.C., the Greek letter [[zeta]] Ζ was adopted to represent {{IPA|/z/}} and {{IPA|/zz/}}.&lt;ref name="Allen Z" /&gt; However, the [[Vulgar Latin]] spellings&lt;!-- Sturtevant does not specify when these spellings were used, but they seem to be from Late or Vulgar, not Classical Latin, given the use of ae for e. --&gt; ''z'' or ''zi'' for earlier ''di'' and ''d'' before ''e'', and the spellings ''di'' and ''dz'' for earlier ''z'', suggest the pronunciation {{IPA|/dz/}}, as for example ''ziomedis'' for ''diomedis'', and ''diaeta'' for ''zeta''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sturtevant|1920|pp=115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ancient times ''u'' and ''i'' represented the [[approximant consonant|approximant]] consonants {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/j/}}, as well as the close vowels {{IPA|/u(ː)/}} and {{IPA|/i(ː)/}}.
* ''i'' representing the consonant {{IPA|/j/}} was usually not doubled in writing so a single ''i'' represented double {{IPA|/jː/}} or {{IPA|/jj/}} and the sequences {{IPA|/ji/}} and {{IPA|/jːi/}}, as in ''cuius'' for *''cuiius'' {{IPA|/ˈkuj.jus/}}, ''conicit'' for *''coniicit'' {{IPA|/ˈkon.ji.kit/}}, and ''rēicit'' for *''reiiicit'' {{IPA|/ˈrej.ji.kit/}}. Both the consonantal and vocalic pronunciations of ''i'' could occur in some of the same environments: compare ''maius'' {{IPA|/ˈmaj.jus/}} with ''Gāius'' {{IPA|/ˈɡaː.i.us/}}, and ''Iūlius'' {{IPA|/ˈjuː.li.us/}} with ''Iūlus'' {{IPA|/iˈuː.lus/}}. The vowel before a doubled {{IPA|/jː/}} is sometimes marked with a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]], as in ''cūius''.&lt;!-- Source for this use of macron needed; Allen and Greenough uses a circumflex. --&gt; it indicates not that the vowel is long but that the first syllable is [[syllable weight|heavy]] from the double consonant.&lt;ref name="Allen j" /&gt;
* ''v'' between vowels represented single {{IPA|/w/}} in native Latin words but double {{IPA|/ww/}} in Greek loanwords. Both the consonantal and vocalic pronunciations of ''v'' sometimes occurred in similar environments, as in ''genua'' {{IPA|[ˈɡɛ.nʊ.a]}} and ''silva'' {{IPA|[ˈsɪl.wa]}}.&lt;ref name="Allen v" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|Greenough|2001|loc=§6d, 11c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vowels===

====Monophthongs====
Latin has ten native vowels, spelled ''a'', ''e'', ''i'', ''o'', ''u''. In Classical Latin, each vowel had [[vowel length|short and long]] versions: {{IPA|/a ɛ ɪ ɔ ʊ/}} and {{IPA|/aː eː iː oː uː/}}. The long versions of the close and mid vowels ''e'', ''i'', ''o'', ''u'' had a different vowel quality from the short versions, so that long {{IPA|/eː, oː/}} were similar to short {{IPA|/ɪ, ʊ/}}.&lt;!-- Given developments of short i, u and long e, o in the Romance languages, this was probably true only in Rome. Vulgar Latin across the Empire, such as the Latin in Romania and Sardinia, probably had different vowel qualities. --&gt; Some [[loanword]]s from Greek had the vowel ''y'', which was pronounced as {{IPA|/y yː/}} by educated speakers but approximated with the native vowels ''u'' and ''i'' by less educated speakers.

=====Long and short vowels=====
Each vowel letter (with the possible exception of ''y'') represents at least two [[phoneme]]s. ''a'' can represent either short {{IPA|/a/}} or long {{IPA|/aː/}}, ''e'' represents either {{IPA|/e/}} or {{IPA|/eː/}}, etc.

Short mid vowels ({{IPA|/e o/}}) and close vowels ({{IPA|/i u/}}) were pronounced with a different quality from their [[vowel length|long]] counterparts, being also more [[open vowel|open]]: {{IPAblink|ɛ}}, {{IPAblink|ɔ}}, {{IPAblink|ɪ}} and {{IPAblink|ʊ}}. This opening made the short vowels ''i u'' {{IPA|[ɪ ʊ]}} similar in quality to long ''é ó'' {{IPA|[eː oː]}} respectively. ''i é'' and ''u ó'' were often written in place of each other in inscriptions:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|pp=47–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''trebibos'' for ''tribibus'' {{IPA|[ˈtrɪ.bɪ.bʊs]}}
* ''minsis'' for ''mensis'' {{IPA|[ˈmẽː.sɪs]}}
* ''sob'' for ''sub'' {{IPA|[sʊb]}}
* ''punere'' for ''pōnere'' {{IPA|[ˈpoː.næ.rɛ]}}

Short {{IPA|/e/}} most likely had a more open allophone before {{IPA|/r/}} and tended toward near-open {{IPAblink|æ}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Short {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} were probably pronounced closer when they occurred before another vowel. ''mea'' was written as ''mia'' in inscriptions. Short {{IPA|/i/}} before another vowel is often written with ''i longa'', as in ''dīes'', indicating that its quality was similar to that of long {{IPA|/iː/}} and is almost never confused with ''e'' in this position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|pp=51, 52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Adoption of Greek upsilon=====
''y'' was used in Greek loanwords with [[Upsilon (letter)|upsilon]] Υ. This letter represented the [[close front rounded vowel]], both short and long: {{IPA|/y yː/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latin did not have this sound as a distinctive phoneme, and speakers tended to pronounce such loanwords with {{IPA|/u uː/}} in Old Latin and {{IPA|/i iː/}} in Classical and Late Latin if they were unable to produce {{IPA|/y yː/}}.

=====Sonus medius=====
An intermediate vowel sound (likely a close central vowel {{IPAblink|ɨ}} or possibly its rounded counterpart {{IPAblink|ʉ}}), called ''sonus medius'', can be reconstructed for the classical period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a vowel is found in ''doc'''u'''mentum'', ''opt'''i'''mus'', ''lacr'''i'''ma'' (also spelled ''doc'''i'''mentum'', ''opt'''u'''mus'', ''lacr'''u'''ma'') and other words. It developed out of a historical short {{IPA|/u/}}, later fronted by vowel reduction. In the vicinity of labial consonants, this sound was not as fronted and may have retained some rounding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Vowel nasalization=====
{{listen|header=Examples of nasalized vowels at ends of words and before -ns-, -nf- sequences|type=speech
|filename=La-cls-monstrum.ogg|title=monstrum
|filename3=La-cls-mensis.ogg|title3=mensis
|filename4=La-cls-infans, infantem.ogg|title4=infans, infantem}}
Vowels followed by a nasal consonant were allophonically realised as long [[nasal vowel]]s in two environments:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clackson|2008|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Before word-final ''m'':&lt;ref name="Allen -Vm" /&gt;
** ''monstrum'' {{IPA|/ˈmon.strum/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ˈmõː.strũː]}}.
** ''dentem'' {{IPA|/ˈden.tem/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ˈdɛn.tẽː]}}
* Before nasal consonants followed by a fricative:&lt;ref name="Allen n" /&gt;
** ''censor'' {{IPA|/ˈken.sor/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ˈkẽː.sɔr]}} (in early inscriptions, often written as ''cesor'')
** ''consul'' {{IPA|/ˈkon.sul/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ˈkõː.sʊl]}} (often written as ''cosol'' and abbreviated as ''cos'')
** ''inferōs'' {{IPA|/ˈin.fe.roːs/}} &gt; {{IPA|[ˈĩː.fæ.roːs]}} (written as ''iferos'')
Those long nasal vowels had the same quality as ordinary long vowels. In [[Vulgar Latin]], the vowels lost their nasalisation, and they merged with the long vowels (which were themselves shortened by that time). This is shown by many forms in the Romance languages, such as Spanish ''costar'' from Vulgar Latin ''cōstāre'' (originally ''constāre'') and Italian ''mese'' from Vulgar Latin ''mēse'' (Classical Latin ''mensem''). On the other hand, the short vowel and {{IPA|/n/}} was restored in French ''enseigne'' and ''enfant'' from ''insignia'' and ''infantem'' (''e'' is the normal development of Latin short ''i''), likely by analogy with other forms beginning in the prefix ''in-''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|pp=55, 56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a final ''-m'' occurred before a plosive or nasal in the next word, however, it was pronounced as a nasal at the place of articulation of the following consonant. For instance, ''tan dūrum'' {{IPA|[tan ˈduː.rũː]}} was written for ''tam dūrum'' in inscriptions, and ''cum nōbīs'' {{IPA|[kʊn ˈnoː.biːs]}} was a [[double entendre]],&lt;ref name="Allen -Vm" /&gt; possibly for ''cunnō bis'' {{IPA|[ˈkʊnnoː bɪs]}}.

''ae'', ''oe'', ''au'', ''ei'', ''eu'' could represent diphthongs: ''ae'' represented {{IPA|/ae̯/}}, ''oe'' represented {{IPA|/oe̯/}}, ''au'' represented {{IPA|/au̯/}}, ''ei'' represented {{IPA|/ei̯/}}, and ''eu'' represented {{IPA|/eu̯/}}. ''ui'' sometimes represented the diphthong {{IPA|/ui̯/}}, as in ''cui'' {{audio|La-cls-cui.oga|listen}} and ''huic''.&lt;ref name="ui" /&gt;

If there is a [[tréma]] above the second vowel, both vowels are pronounced separately: ''aë'' {{IPA|[a.ɛ]}}, ''aü'' {{IPA|[a.ʊ]}}, ''eü'' {{IPA|[ɛ.ʊ]}} and ''oë'' {{IPA|[ɔ.ɛ]}}.

In Old Latin, ''ae'', ''oe'' were written as ''ai'', ''oi'' and probably pronounced as {{IPA|[ai̯, oi̯]}}, with a fully closed second element, similar to the final syllable in French {{Audio|Fr-travail.ogg|''travail''}}. In the late Old Latin period, the last element of the diphthongs was lowered to {{IPA|[e]}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ward|1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that the diphthongs were pronounced {{IPA|/ae̯/}} and {{IPA|/oe̯/}} in Classical Latin, similar to the diphthongs in English {{audio|En-us-high.ogg|''high''|help=no}} and {{audio|En-us-boy.ogg|''boy''|help=no}}. They were then monophthongized to {{IPA|/ɛː/}} and {{IPA|/eː/}}, starting in rural areas at the end of the Republican period.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The simplification was already common in rural speech as far back as the time of [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] (116 BC – 27 BC): cf. ''De lingua Latina'', 5:97 (referred to in {{Harvnb|Smith|2004|p=47}}).&lt;/ref&gt; The process, however, does not seem to have been completed before the 3rd century AD in [[Vulgar Latin]], and some scholars say that it may have been regular by the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clackson|Horrocks|2007|pp=273, 274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vowel and consonant length===
Vowel and consonant [[length (phonetics)|length]] were more significant and more clearly defined in Latin than in modern English. Length is the duration of time that a particular sound is held before proceeding to the next sound in a word. Unfortunately, "vowel length" is a confusing term for English speakers, who, in their language, call "long vowels" what are usually [[diphthongs]] rather than [[monophthongs]]. (That is a relic of the [[Great Vowel Shift]], during which vowels that had once been pronounced phonemically longer turned into diphthongs.) In the modern spelling of Latin, especially in dictionaries and academic work, [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]s are frequently used to mark long vowels: {{angbr|ā ē ī ō ū ȳ}}, while the [[breve]] is sometimes used to indicate that a vowel is short: {{angbr|ă ĕ ĭ ŏ ŭ y̆}}.

Long consonants were usually indicated through doubling, but ancient Latin orthography did not distinguish between the vocalic and consonantal uses of ''i'' and ''v''. Vowel length was indicated only intermittently in classical sources and even then through a variety of means. Later medieval and modern usage tended to omit vowel length altogether. A short-lived convention of spelling long vowels by doubling the vowel letter is associated with the poet [[Lucius Accius]]. Later spelling conventions marked long vowels with an [[Apex (Latin spelling)|apex]] (a diacritic similar to an [[acute accent]]) or, in the case of long i, by increasing the height of the letter ([[long i]]); in the second century AD, those were given apices as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|pp=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distinctions of vowel length had become less important in later Latin and have ceased to be phonemic in the modern Romance languages, in which the previous long and short versions of the vowels have been either lost or replaced by other phonetic contrasts.

[[File:La-cls-anus, annus, anus.ogg|thumb|Recording of ''ānus, annus, anus'']]
A [[minimal pair|minimal set]] showing both long and short vowels and long and short consonants is ''ānus'' {{IPA|/ˈaː.nus/}} ('buttocks'), ''annus'' {{IPA|/ˈan.nus/}} ('year'), ''anus'' {{IPA|/ˈa.nus/}} ('old woman').

==Syllables and stress==

===Old Latin stress===
It is hypothesised that in [[Old Latin]], as in [[Proto-Italic]], stress normally fell on the first syllable of a word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fortson|2004|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the word-initial stress triggered changes in the vowels of non-initial syllables, the effects of which are still visible in classical Latin. Compare for example:
* ''f'''a'''ciō'' 'I do/make', ''f'''a'''ctus'' 'made'; pronounced {{IPA|/ˈfa.ki.oː/}} and {{IPA|/ˈfak.tus/}} in later Old Latin and Classical Latin.
* ''aff'''i'''ciō'' 'I affect', ''aff'''e'''ctus'' 'affected'; pronounced {{IPA|/ˈaf.fi.ki.oː/}} and {{IPA|/ˈaf.fek.tus/}} in Old Latin following vowel reduction, {{IPA|/af.ˈfi.ki.oː/}} and {{IPA|/af.ˈfek.tus/}} in Classical Latin.
In the earliest Latin writings, the original unreduced vowels are still visible. Study of this vowel reduction, as well as syncopation (dropping of short unaccented syllables) in Greek loan words, indicates that the stress remained word-initial until around the time of [[Plautus]], the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sturtevant|1920|pp=207–218}}&lt;/ref&gt; The placement of the stress then shifted to become the pattern found in classical Latin.

===Classical Latin syllables and stress===
{{See also|Dreimorengesetz}}
In Classical Latin, stress changed. It moved from the first syllable to one of the last three syllables, called the antepenult, the penult, and the ultima (short for ''antepaenultima'' 'before almost last', ''paenultima'' 'almost last', and ''ultima syllaba'' 'last syllable'). Its position is determined by the [[syllable weight]] of the penult. If the penult is heavy, it is accented; if the penult is light and there are more than two syllables, the antepenult is accented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a few words originally accented on the penult, accent is on the ultima because the two last syllables have been contracted, or the last syllable has been lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Syllable====
To determine stress, syllable weight of the penult must be determined. To determine syllable weight, words must be broken up into syllables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|Greenough|2001|loc=§11}}&lt;!-- syllable quantity --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the following examples, syllable structure is represented using these symbols: C (a consonant), K (a stop), R (a liquid), and V (a short vowel), VV (a long vowel or diphthong).

=====Nucleus=====
Every short vowel, long vowel, or diphthong belongs to a single syllable. This vowel forms the syllable nucleus. Thus ''magistrārum'' has four syllables, one for every vowel (a i ā u: V V VV V), ''aereus'' has three (ae e u: VV V V), ''tuō'' has two (u ō: V VV), and ''cui'' has one (ui: VV).&lt;ref name="Greenough syllable"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|Greenough|2001|§7&lt;!-- one vowel or diphthong to a syllable; one consonant as onset --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Onset and coda=====
A consonant before a vowel, or a consonant cluster at the beginning of a word, is placed in the same syllable as the following vowel. This consonant or consonant cluster forms the syllable onset.&lt;ref name="Greenough syllable" /&gt;
*''fēminae'' {{IPA|/feː.mi.nae̯/}} (CVV.CV.CVV)
*''vidēre'' {{IPA|/wi.deː.re/}} (CV.CVV.CV)
*''puerō'' {{IPA|/pu.e.roː/}} (CV.V.CVV)
*''beātae'' {{IPA|/be.aː.tae̯/}} (CV.VV.CVV)
*''graviter'' {{IPA|/ɡra.wi.ter/}} (CCV.CV.CVC)
*''strātum'' {{IPA|/straː.tum/}} (CCCVV.CVC)

After this, if there is an additional consonant inside the word, it is placed at the end of the syllable. This consonant is the syllable coda. Thus if a consonant cluster of two consonants occurs between vowels, they are broken up between syllables: one goes with the syllable before, the other with the syllable after.&lt;ref name="Allen syllable"&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|pp=89–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''puella'' {{IPA|/pu.el.la/}} (CV.VC.CV)
*''supersum'' {{IPA|/su.per.sum/}} (CV.CVC.CVC)
*''coāctus'' {{IPA|/ko.aːk.tus/}} (CV.VVC.CVC)
*''intellēxit'' {{IPA|/in.tel.leːk.sit/}} (VC.CVC.CVVC.CVC)

There are two exceptions. A consonant cluster of a stop ''p t c b d g'' followed by a liquid ''l r'' between vowels usually goes to the syllable after it, although it is also sometimes broken up like other consonant clusters.&lt;ref name="Allen syllable" /&gt;
*''volucris'' {{IPA|/wo.lu.kris/}} or {{IPA|/wo.luk.ris/}} (CV.CV.KRVC or CV.CVK.RVC)

=====Heavy and light syllables=====
As shown in the examples above, Latin syllables have a variety of possible structures. Here are some of them. The first four examples are light syllables, and the last six are heavy. All syllables have at least one V (vowel). A syllable is heavy if it has another V or a VC after the first V. In the table below, the extra V or VC is bolded, indicating that it makes the syllable heavy.

{|
| || || || V || ||
|-
| || || C || V || ||

! V !! C
|-
| || || || V

|-
| || || || V

|}

Thus, a syllable is heavy if it ends in a long vowel or diphthong, a short vowel and a consonant, a long vowel and a consonant, or a diphthong and a consonant. Syllables ending in a diphthong and consonant are rare in Classical Latin.

The syllable onset has no relationship to syllable weight; both heavy and light syllables can have no onset or an onset of one, two, or three consonants.

In Latin a syllable that is heavy because it ends in a long vowel or diphthong is traditionally called ''syllaba nātūrā longa'' ('syllable long by nature'), and a syllable that is heavy because it ends in a consonant is called ''positiōne longa'' ('long by position'). These terms are translations of Greek ''συλλαβὴ μακρά φύσει'' (''syllabḕ makrá phýsei'' = 'syllable long by nature') and ''μακρὰ θέσει'' (''makrà thései'' = 'long by '''pro'''position'), respectively; therefore ''positiōne'' should not be mistaken for implying a syllable "is long because of its position/place in a word" but rather "is treated as 'long' by convention".  This article uses the words ''heavy'' and ''light'' for syllables, and ''long'' and ''short'' for vowels since the two are not the same.&lt;ref name="Allen syllable" /&gt;

====Stress rule====
In a word of three or more syllables, the weight of the penult determines where the accent is placed. If the penult is light, accent is placed on the antepenult; if it is heavy, accent is placed on the penult.&lt;ref name="Allen syllable" /&gt; Below, stress is marked by placing the stress mark {{IPA|[ˈ]}} before the stressed syllable.

|}

====Iambic shortening====
'''Iambic shortening''' or ''brevis brevians'' is vowel shortening that occurs in words of the type ''light–heavy'', where the light syllable is stressed. By this sound change, words like ''egō'', ''modō'', ''benē'', ''amā'' with long final vowel change to ''ego'', ''modo'', ''bene'', ''ama'' with short final vowel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elision==
Where one word ended with a vowel (including a nasalized vowel, represented by a vowel plus ''m'') and the next word began with a vowel, the former vowel, at least in verse, was regularly elided; that is, it was omitted altogether, or possibly (in the case of {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}) pronounced like the corresponding semivowel. When the second word was ''est'' or ''et'', a different form of elision sometimes occurred ([[prodelision]]): the vowel of the preceding word was retained, and the ''e'' was elided instead. Elision also occurred in Ancient Greek, but in that language, it is shown in writing by the vowel in question being replaced by an apostrophe, whereas in Latin elision is not indicated at all in the orthography, but can be deduced from the verse form. Only occasionally is it found in inscriptions, as in ''scriptust'' for ''scriptum est''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|Greenough|2001|p=400|loc=section 612 e, f}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This reference covers elision and prodelision in poetry; a reference for elision in Ancient Greek and Latin inscriptions is still needed. --&gt;

==Latin spelling and pronunciation today==

===Spelling===
Modern usage, even for classical Latin texts, varies in respect of ''I'' and ''V''. During the Renaissance, the printing convention was to use  ''I'' (upper case) and ''i'' (lower case) for both vocalic {{IPA|/i/}} and consonantal {{IPA|/j/}}, to use ''V'' in the upper case and in the lower case to use ''v'' at the start of words and ''u'' subsequently within the word regardless of whether {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} was represented.&lt;ref&gt;Gor example, Henri Estienne's ''Dictionarium, seu Latinae linguae thesaurus'' (1531)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many publishers (such as Oxford University Press) have adopted the convention of using ''I'' (upper case) and ''i'' (lower case) for both {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/j/}}, and ''V'' (upper case) and ''u'' (lower case) for both {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/w/}}.

An alternative approach, less common today, is to use ''i'' and ''u'' only for the vowels and ''j'' and ''v'' for the approximants.

Most modern editions, however, adopt an intermediate position, distinguishing between ''u'' and ''v'' but not between ''i'' and ''j''. Usually, the non-vocalic ''v'' after ''q'' or ''g'' is still printed as ''u'' rather than ''v'', probably because in this position it did not change from {{IPA|/w/}} to {{IPA|/v/}} in post-classical times.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This approach is also recommended in the [[:la:Vicipaedia:Commendationes paginarum recte scribendarum|help page]] for the [[:la:|Latin Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Textbooks and dictionaries indicate the length of vowels by putting a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] or horizontal bar above the long vowel, but it is not generally done in regular texts. Occasionally, mainly in early printed texts up to the 18th century, one may see a [[circumflex]] used to indicate a long vowel where this makes a difference to the sense, for instance, ''Româ'' {{IPA|/ˈroːmaː/}} ('from Rome' [[Ablative case|ablative]]) compared to ''Roma'' {{IPA|/ˈroːma/}} ('Rome' [[Nominative case|nominative]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gilbert|1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, for instance in Roman Catholic service books, an [[acute accent]] over a vowel is used to indicate the stressed syllable. It would be  redundant for one who knew the classical rules of accentuation and made the correct distinction between long and short vowels, but most Latin speakers since the 3rd century have not made any distinction between long and short vowels, but they have kept the accents in the same places; thus, the use of accent marks allows speakers to read a word aloud correctly even if they never heard it spoken aloud.

===Pronunciation===

====Post-Medieval Latin====
{{main article|New Latin#Pronunciation|l1=Pronunciation of New Latin}}
Since around the beginning of the [[Renaissance]] period onwards, with the language being used as an international language among intellectuals, pronunciation of Latin in Europe came to be dominated by the [[phonology]] of local languages, resulting in a variety of different pronunciation systems.

====Loan words and formal study====

When Latin words are used as [[loanword]]s in a modern language, there is ordinarily little or no attempt to pronounce them as the Romans did; in most cases, a pronunciation suiting the phonology of the receiving language is employed.

Latin words in common use in English are generally [[loanword#Classification|fully assimilated]] into the English sound system, with little to mark them as foreign, for example, ''cranium'', ''saliva''.  Other words have a stronger Latin feel to them, usually because of spelling features such as the digraphs ''ae'' and ''oe'' (occasionally written as ligatures: ''æ'' and ''œ'', respectively), which both denote {{IPA|/iː/}} in English.  The [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''ae'' or [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] ''æ'' in some words tend to be given an {{IPA|/aɪ/}} pronunciation, for example, ''curriculum vitae''.

However, using loan words in the context of the language borrowing them is a markedly different situation from the study of Latin itself. In this classroom setting, instructors and students attempt to recreate at least some sense of the original pronunciation. What is taught to native anglophones is suggested by the sounds of today's [[Romance languages]],{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} the direct descendants of Latin. Instructors who take this approach rationalize that Romance vowels probably come closer to the original pronunciation than those of any other modern language (see also the section below on "[[Latin spelling and pronunciation#Derivative languages|Derivative languages]]").

However, other languages—including Romance family members—all have their own interpretations of the Latin phonological system, applied both to loan words and formal study of Latin. But English, Romance, or other teachers do not always point out that the particular accent their students learn is not actually the way ancient Romans spoke.

====Ecclesiastical pronunciation====
{{see also|Ecclesiastical Latin}}
Because of the central position of Rome within the [[Catholic Church]], an [[Italian orthography|Italian pronunciation]] of Latin became commonly accepted, but this was not the case until the latter part of the 19th century. This pronunciation corresponds to that of the Latin-derived words in Italian. Before then, the pronunciation of Latin in church was the same as the pronunciation as Latin in other fields and tended to reflect the sound values associated with the nationality of the speaker.{{sfn|Brittain|1955}}

The following are the main points that distinguish modern ecclesiastical pronunciation from Classical Latin pronunciation:

* Vowel length is not phonemic. As a result, the automatic [[stress accent]] of Classical Latin, which was dependent on vowel length, becomes a phonemic one in Ecclesiastical Latin. (Some Ecclesiastical texts mark the stress with an [[acute accent]] in words of three or more syllables.)
* The digraphs ''ae'' and ''oe'' (sometimes written as ligatures ''æ'' and ''œ'') represent {{IPA|/ɛ/}}.&lt;ref name="Liber Usualis"&gt;[http://www.musicasacra.com/pdf/liberusualis.pdf Liber Usualis], p. xxxviij&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''c'' denotes {{IPA|[t͡ʃ]}} (as in English {{angbr|ch}}) before ''ae'' (''æ''), ''oe'' (''œ''), ''e'', ''i'' or ''y''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}
* ''g'' denotes {{IPA|[d͡ʒ]}} (as in English {{angbr|j}}) before ''ae'' (''æ''), ''oe'' (''œ''), ''e'', ''i'' or ''y''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}
* ''h'' is silent except in two words: ''mihi'' and ''nihil'', where it represents {{IPA|/k/}} (in the Middle Ages, these words were spelled ''michi'' and ''nichil'').&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to the ''Liber Usualis''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This pronunciation of ''mihi'' and ''nihil'' may have been an attempt to reintroduce {{IPA|/h/}} intervocalically, where it seems to have been lost even in literary Latin by the end of the Republican period ({{Harvnb|Smith|2004|p=48}}) as indicated by the alternative Classical spellings ''mī'' and ''nīl''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''s'' between vowels represents {{IPA|/z/}} or {{IPA|/s/}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Up front!: becoming the complete choral conductor|last=Robinson|first=Ray|page=192|year=1993|isbn=9780911318197|quote=Not all authorities agree that s between vowels in Church Latin should be voiced. Of the sources cited in the bibliography, Hines, May/Tolin and Wall prefer the voiced s}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''sc'' before ''ae'' (''æ''), ''oe'' (''œ''), ''e'', ''i'' or ''y''. represents {{IPA|/ʃ/}}.
* ''ti'', if followed by a vowel, not word-initial or stressed, and not preceded by ''s'', ''t'', or ''x'' represents {{IPA|[t͡si]}}.&lt;ref name="Liber Usualis" /&gt;
* the letter ''v'' when it starts a syllable is pronounced {{IPA|/v/}}, and not {{IPA|/w/}} as in classical Latin. Between ''g'' or ''q'' and a vowel, it retains the ancient {{IPA|/w/}} pronunciation, and as a syllable nucleus, it retains {{IPA|/u/}}. Unlike in the ancient orthography, the letter ''v'' is now written ''v'' when it is pronounced {{IPA|/v/}}, but ''u'' when it is pronounced {{IPA|/w/}} or {{IPA|/u/}}.
* ''th'' represents {{IPA|/t/}}.
* ''ph'' represents {{IPA|/f/}}.
* ''ch'' represents {{IPA|/k/}}.
* ''y'' represents {{IPA|/i/}}.
* ''gn'' represents {{IPA|/ɲ/}}.
* ''x'' represents {{IPA|/ks/}}, the {{IPA|/s/}} of which merges with a following ''c'' that precedes ''ae'' (''æ''), ''oe'' (''œ''), ''e'', ''i'' or ''y'' to form {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, as in ''excelsis'' {{IPA|/ekˈʃelsis/}}&lt;ref name="Liber Usualis"/&gt;
* ''z'' represents {{IPA|/dz/}}.
* Word-final ''m'' and ''n'' are pronounced fully, with no [[nasal vowel|nasalization of the preceding vowel]].

In his ''Vox Latina: A guide to the Pronunciation of Classical Latin'', [[William Sidney Allen]] remarked that this pronunciation, used by the Catholic Church in Rome and elsewhere, and whose adoption [[Pope Pius X]] recommended in a 1912 letter to the Archbishop of Bourges, "is probably less far removed from classical Latin than any other 'national' pronunciation"; but, as can be seen from the table above, there are, nevertheless, very significant differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction to the ''[[Liber Usualis]]'' indicates that Ecclesiastical Latin pronunciation should be used at Church liturgies.&lt;ref name="Liber Usualis2"&gt;[http://www.musicasacra.com/pdf/liberusualis.pdf Liber Usualis], p. xxxvj&lt;/ref&gt; Ecclesiastical pronunciation is also the preferred pronunciation of Catholics whenever speaking Latin even if not as part of liturgy.  The [[Pontifical Academy for Latin]] is the [[pontifical academy]] in the Vatican that is charged with the dissemination and education of Catholics in the Latin language.

Outside of Austria and Germany, it is the most widely used standard in [[choir|choral]] singing which, with a few exceptions like [[Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Oedipus rex (opera)|Oedipus rex]]'', is concerned with liturgical texts. [[Anglican]] choirs adopted it when classicists abandoned traditional English pronunciation after World War II. The rise of [[historically informed performance]] and the availability of guides such as Copeman's ''Singing in Latin'' has led to the recent revival of [[Latin regional pronunciation|regional pronunciations]].

==Pronunciation shared by Vulgar Latin and Romance languages==
{{Further information|Latin|Vulgar Latin|Romance languages}}

Because it gave rise to many modern languages, Latin did not strictly "die"; it merely evolved over the centuries in diverse ways. The local dialects of [[Vulgar Latin]] that emerged eventually became modern [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Romansh language|Romansh]], [[Dalmatian language|Dalmatian]], [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]], and many others.

Key features of Vulgar Latin and [[Romance languages]] include:

* Almost total loss of {{IPA|/h/}} and final unstressed {{IPA|/m/}}.
* Conversion of the distinction of [[vowel length]] into a distinction of [[Vowel height|height]], and subsequent merger of some of these [[phonemes]]. Most Romance languages merged short {{IPA|/u/}} with long {{IPA|/oː/}} and short {{IPA|/i/}} with long {{IPA|/eː/}}.
* [[Monophthongization]] of {{IPA|/ae̯/}} into {{IPA|/ɛː/}} and {{IPA|/oe̯/}} into {{IPA|/eː/}}.
* Loss of marginal phonemes such as aspirates ({{IPA|/pʰ/}}, {{IPA|/tʰ/}}, and {{IPA|/kʰ/}}), which became [[Tenuis consonant|tenues]], and the close front-rounded vowel {{IPA|[y]}}, which became unrounded.
* Loss of {{IPA|/n/}} before {{IPA|/s/}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|pp=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; (CL ''spōnsa'' &gt; VL ''spōsa'') but this influence on the later development of Romance languages was limited from written influence, analogy, and learned borrowings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1978|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Palatalization (sound change)|Palatalization]] of {{IPA|/k/}} before {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} (not in all varieties), probably first into {{IPA|/kʲ/}} and then {{IPA|/tʲ/}} before it finally developed into {{IPA|/ts/}} or {{IPA|/tʃ/}}.&lt;ref name="palatal"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pope|1952|loc=chapter 6, §4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Palatalization of {{IPA|/ɡ/}} before {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/i/}}, and of {{IPA|/j/}}, into {{IPA|/dʒ/}} (not in all varieties) and then further into {{IPA|/ʒ/}} in some Romance varieties.&lt;ref name="palatal"/&gt;
* Palatalization of {{IPA|/ti/}} followed by a vowel (if not preceded by s, t, x) into {{IPA|/tsj/}}. It merged with {{IPA|/ts/}} in dialects in which {{IPA|/k/}} had developed into this sound, but it remained separate elsewhere (such as Italian).
* Palatalization of {{IPA|/li/}} and {{IPA|/ni/}} followed by a vowel into {{IPA|/ʎ/}} and {{IPA|/ɲ/}}. {{IPA|/ŋn/}} (orthographic ''gn'') also [[Fusion (phonetics)|coalesced]] to become {{IPA|/ɲ/}}.
* The change of {{IPA|/w/}} (except after {{IPA|/k/}}) and {{IPA|/b/}} between vowels, into {{IPA|/β/}}.

==Examples==

The following examples are both in verse, which demonstrates several features more clearly than prose.

===From Classical Latin===
[[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', Book 1, verses 1–4. Quantitative metre ([[dactylic hexameter]]). Translation: "I sing of arms and the man, who, driven by fate, came first from the borders of Troy to Italy and the Lavinian shores; he [was] much afflicted both on lands and on the deep by the power of the gods, because of fierce Juno's vindictive wrath."

[[File:La-cls-arma virumque cano.ogg|thumb|Recording of first four lines of Aeneid in reconstructed Classical Latin pronunciation]]
#  Ancient Roman orthography (before 2nd century)&lt;ref group="note"&gt;"The word-divider is regularly found on all good inscriptions, in papyri, on wax tablets, and even in ''graffiti'' from the earliest Republican times through the Golden Age and well into the Second Century. ... Throughout these periods the [[word divider|word-divider]] was a dot placed half-way between the upper and the lower edge of the line of writing. ... As a rule, interpuncta are used simply to divide words, except that prepositions are only rarely separated from the word they govern, if this follows next. ... The regular use of the interpunct as a word-divider continued until sometime in the Second Century, when it began to fall into disuse, and Latin was written with increasing frequency, both in papyrus and on stone or bronze, in ''scriptura continua.''" {{Harvnb|Wingo|1972|pp=15, 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note the elisions in ''mult(um)'' and ''ill(e)'' in the third line. For a fuller discussion of the prosodic features of this passage, see [[Dactylic hexameter]].

Some manuscripts have "Lāvīna" rather than "Lāvīnia" in the second line.

===From Medieval Latin===
Beginning of ''[[Pange Lingua Gloriosi Corporis Mysterium]]'' by [[Thomas Aquinas]] (13th century). Rhymed accentual metre. Translation: "Extol, [my] tongue, the mystery of the glorious body and the precious blood, which the fruit of a noble womb, the king of nations, poured out as the price of the world."

1. Traditional orthography as in Roman Catholic service books (stressed syllable marked with an acute accent on words of three syllables or more).

:Pange lingua gloriósi
:Córporis mystérium,
:Sanguinísque pretiósi,
:quem in mundi prétium
:fructus ventris generósi
:Rex effúdit géntium.

==Biography==
Halimi was born to a certain Abi Yusof.{{sfn|Yazici|2003|pages=588-589}} Information about his place of birth and education remains unclear.{{sfn|Yazici|2003|pages=588-589}} According to [[Aşık Çelebi]], Halimi had migrated from Iran and climbed up the ladder through the support of [[Mahmud Pasha Angelović|Mahmud Pasha]], the grand vizier at the time.{{sfn|Yazici|2003|pages=588-589}} Sources of a later time state that Halimi hailed from [[Amasya]] near the [[Black Sea]].{{sfn|Yazici|2003|pages=588-589}} According to his own works, Halimi had moved from Iran whereafter he was made tutor to Prince Mehmed (later known as Sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror]], i.e. Mehmed II).{{sfn|Yazici|2003|pages=588-589}}

It is likely that Halimi became the judge of [[Sivas]] during the 2nd reign of Mehmed the Conqueror.{{sfn|Yazici|2003|pages=588-589}}

According to [[Kâtip Çelebi]], Halimi's death was the result of murder.{{sfn|Yazici|2003|pages=588-589}}

==Works==
Halimi's known works are:{{sfn|Yazici|2003|pages=588-589}}{{sfn|Storey|1984|pages=63-64}}

* ''Bahr al-gharaeb / Loghat-e Halimi'' (a Persian-Turkish dictionary, found in numerous libraries under various names, such as "Qasemiya", "Qaema", or "Nethar al-malek")
* ''Mosharrahat al-asma'' (an Arabic-Persian dictionary)
* ''Tebb-e manzum'' (a Persian work on medicine, dedicated to Mehmed the Conqueror. In the preface, Halimi states that he is in "great debt in learning medicine to Greek physicians", and elaborates that "he preferred to use Persian instead of Arabic in a versified work, because he believed that there was no language as refined and graceful as Persian". Lastly, he "acknowledges his debt to [[Avicenna]]'s ''Qanun and Shefa''".)
* ''Sharh moktasar al-ashkal'' (a short treatise on Islamic law, in Arabic)
* ''Qasida-ye ta'iya'' (an Arabic poem. It was presented to Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror. In the poem, Halimi praises the sultan and mentions the "misfortunes" that he himself had endured during his life. "Ḥalimi describes the ideal relationship between rulers and religious leaders, and recounts the attitudes of previous rulers on this issue while chastising fraudulent scholars". In between the sentences, Persian couplets and stories are inserted.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4129">'''Micro-oxygenation''' is a process used in [[winemaking]] to introduce [[oxygen]] into [[wine]] in a controlled manner. Developed in 1991 by [[Patrick DuCournau]], working with the exceptionally [[grape tannins|tannic]] grape [[Tannat]] in [[Madiran AOC|Madiran]], the process gained usage in modern winemaking following the 1996 authorization by the [[European Commission]]. Today, the technique is widely employed in [[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]], as well as at least 11 different countries, including the [[American wine|United States]] and [[Chilean wine|Chile]].&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 442-443"&gt; J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition  pg 442-443 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
The process of micro-oxygenation involves a large two chamber device with valves interconnected to a tank of oxygen. In the first chamber, the oxygen is calibrated to match the [[volume]] of the wine. In the second chamber, the oxygen is injected into the wine through a [[porous]] [[ceramic]] stone located at the bottom of the chamber. The dosage is controlled and can range anywhere from .75 to 3 cubic centimetres per [[liter]] of wine. The process normally occurs in multiple treatments that can last anywhere from one or two treatments during the early stages of [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] (to help avoid [[stuck fermentation]]) to a more prolonged treatment during the maturation period that can last four to eight months.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 442-443"/&gt;

Micro-oxygenation affects [[wine colour|colour]], [[Aroma of wine|aromatic bouquet]], [[mouth-feel]]&lt;ref&gt;Sensory characteristics changes of red Grenache wines submitted to different oxygen exposures pre and post bottling. Soline Caillé, Alain Samson, Jérémie Wirth, Jean-Baptiste Diéval, Stéphane Vidal and  Véronique Cheynier, Analytica Chimica Acta, 15 February 2010, Volume 660, Issues 1–2, Pages 35–42, {{doi|10.1016/j.aca.2009.11.049}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[phenolic content in wine|phenolic content]].&lt;ref name=Wirth&gt;The impact of oxygen exposure before and after bottling on the polyphenolic composition of red wines. J. Wirth, C. Morel-Salmi, J.M. Souquet, J.B. Dieval, O. Aagaard, S. Vidal, H. Fulcrand and V. Cheynier, Food Chemistry, 1 November 2010, Volume 123, Issue 1, pages 107–116, {{doi|10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.04.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carboxypyranoanthocyanidin]]s can be considered markers of microoxygenation techniques.&lt;ref name=Wirth /&gt;

== Benefits ==
Exposure to oxygen during production may improve wine, but the exposure must be limited: too much oxygen can lead to [[oxidation]] while too little can lead to [[redox|reduction]], either one leading to its associated [[wine faults]]. In [[oak (wine)|barrel aging]], the natural properties of the wood allow for gentle [[aeration]] of the wine to occur over a prolonged period. This aids in [[polymerization]] of [[tannin (wine)|tannin]] into larger molecules, which could fall out of solution, not promoting protein precipitation in the mouth and thus improving mouth astringency. The process of micro-oxygenation aims to mimic the effects of slow barrel maturation in a shorter period or for lower cost.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 442-443"/&gt; It also enables more control over the process.

During fermentation, the added oxygen can help maintain the viability of the [[yeast (wine)|yeast]] to minimize the risk of [[stuck fermentation]] and the production of undesirable [[sulfides]]. After fermentation it can aid in the [[clarification (wine)|clarification]] and [[stabilization (wine)|stabilization]] of the wine without resorting to the use of [[finings (wine)|fining agents]].&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 442-443"/&gt;

==Recent Research==
Research in the 2000-2010 era suggests the polymerization view of wine development is overly simplistic. As of 2012, research suggest the polymerization view of wine development is misguided, and the real chemical processes so complex and interdependent that they are yet to be elucidated.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

'''Olga Kirsch''' ({{lang-he|אולגה קירש}}; 1924–1997) was a [[South Africa]]n and [[Israel]]i [[poet]].

==Biography==
Kirsch was born and brought up in [[Koppies]] in the [[Orange Free State]], today a part of [[South Africa]]. Her father had emigrated there from [[Lithuania]] and, though a [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] speaker, brought his daughter up to speak [[English language|English]], the mother tongue of her mother Eva, of British origin. She was the third in a family of five to three girls and two boys.

==Early years==
Her primary and secondary education were mostly in Afrikaans, at the school in [[Koppies]], albeit she obtained her high school degree at the Eunice High School&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eunice.co.za/welcome.html Eunice High School website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307044827/http://www.eunice.co.za/welcome.html |date=2009-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Bloemfontein]]. Later, her family moved to [[Johannesburg]], where she attended the [[University of Witwatersrand]] to study medicine; but after one year of studies, she decided to study Literature (Afrikaans and Dutch Literature and History). One of her teachers was the Afrikaans-language novelist [[C. M. van den Heever]].

==Career==
Kirsch wrote mostly in [[Afrikaans]] rather than English, publishing eight books of [[poetry]] in that language, as well as a volume of selected poems (she was only the second female Afrikaans poet to be published).

In 1948, at the age of 24, she [[aliya|emigrated]] to Israel and settled in [[Rehovot]]. She only returned to [[South Africa]] on three occasions: in 1975, 1979 and 1981. Her change of country influenced her writing and the language she used in her daily life, from Afrikaans to English and then to Hebrew. After her arrival to Israel, she taught English for a living, resumed studies and graduated in English Literature at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. In 1949, she married the British-born Israeli mathematician Joseph Gillis, professor at the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]], with whom she had two daughters, Ada and Michal, born in 1950 and 1953, respectively.

Kirsch is the second female writer in Afrikaans to be published, after [[Elisabeth Eybers]], whose first books were published a few years earlier than Kirsch, between 1936 and 1939.

Her poetry was marked by [[metre (poetry)|metre]] and often by [[rhyme]]. In her first two books of poetry, Kirsch reflects her rejection of [[apartheid]] and her aspiration to live in Israel. As she matured, her poetry addresses more personal themes in sonnets dedicated to her husband, the mathematician Joseph Gillis. Other poems evoke the mourning of her mother and her granddaughter, who died at the age of 9 due to an incurable illness. An accomplished [[linguistics|linguist]], she translated her poetry from Afrikaans into English and Hebrew. When unable to write, she would [[drawing|draw]] from nature, [[wood carving|carve]] in wood, and [[embroidery|embroider]]. Her sensitivity to nature affected her work in these media as well.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Works===

The first of her seven books published in Afrikaans, ''Die soeklig'' (the projector) was written while she was still studying in South Africa and the second, ''Mure van die hart'' (Walls of the heart), in 1948, was written on the year of her departure for Israel. With the exception of a few poems in English in the [[Jewish Frontier]], she did not publish anything after leaving South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Hugo on his preface of ''Nou spreek ek weer my bekendes aan'', Human &amp; Rousseau, Le Cap 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Only about a quarter of a century later, in 1972, her third book was published, titled ''Negentien gedigte'', (Nineteen poems), which Daniel Hugo refers as her "second beginning". In 1990, she published her first book of poetry in English. She continued to write in English, and was actively involved with the [[Israel Association of Writers in English]]. Though well known as a poet in South Africa, she failed to achieve the same degree of fame in Israel or the English-speaking world.

In the same way as [[Elisabeth Eybers]], well before [[Breyten Breytenbach]] or [[Sheila Cussons]], her life was marked by the ''exile'' and the difficulty of writing in Afrikaans away from South Africa. She remained a close friend of [[Elisabeth Eybers]], and they visited each other in the Netherlands and Israel.

==Personal life==
She was married to [[Joseph Gillis]] and had two daughters. She died on June 5, 1997, due to a brain tumor.&lt;ref&gt;Theunis Engelbrecht, Meer as 'n oorwinteraar in die vreemde, Beeld 10 juin 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Hugo, So onthou ek Olga Kirsch, Die Burger 9 juillet 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirsch se eiesoortige stem in Afrikaans is nou vir altyd stil, Die Burger 10 juin 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Her legacy and career remains a source of interest in South Africa and abroad. Recently, her poetry has become the subject of a PhD thesis at the [[University of South Africa]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://uir.unisa.ac.za/handle/10500/1871 Uitbeelding van die dood in die digkuns van Elizabeth Eybers, Olga Kirsch en Eveleen Castelyn].

'''Olof Möller''' (July 3, 1923, Riga – June 8, 1985, Solna) was a Swedish [[science fiction]] author.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libris.kb.se/hitlist?q=Olof+M%C3%B6ller&amp;r=;pers:(M%C3%B6ller+Olof+1923)&amp;p=1&amp;f=simp&amp;g=&amp;s=r&amp;t=v&amp;m=10&amp;d=libris Olof Möller] in [[LIBRIS]] database&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swedish Death Index 1901 - 2009, CD ROM Database published by The federation of Swedish Genealogical Societies&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obituary from ''Dagens Nyheter'' June 19, 1985, read August 27, 2012 (http://www.pm1.se/moller.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; He was very productive, though most of what he wrote can be classified as pulp, and is considered the most productive science fiction writer in Sweden. For instance, he published 29 pocket books in the Jaktrymdskepp X12 ("Fighter Starship X12") series between 1974 and 1980.

He was born in Riga in Latvia, the son of medical practitioner and scientist Maximilian Möller and the German-born author Camilla Möller. The family fled to Sweden in 1939. He graduated in 1941 from the Stockholm Institute of Commerce, and obtained a number of varied employments and own enterprises in his civil career. From 1976 to 1985 he was responsible for educational literature at the Military Academy in Stockholm.

[[File:Parmenides.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Parmenides]] was among the first to propose an ontological characterization of the fundamental nature of reality.]]

'''Ontology''' is the [[philosophical]] [[wikt:study|study]] of [[being]]. More broadly, it studies concepts that directly relate to being, in particular [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]], [[existence]], [[reality]], as well as the basic [[category of being|categories of being]] and their relations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ontology Merriam-Webster Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally listed as a part of the major branch of philosophy known as [[metaphysics]], ontology often deals with questions concerning what [[entities]] exist or may be said to exist and how such entities may be grouped, related within a [[hierarchy]], and subdivided according to similarities and differences.

== Etymology ==
The [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] word ''ontology'' ("study of being") combines ''[[wikt:onto-|onto]]-'' ([[Ancient Greek|Gr.]] [[wikt:ὤν|ὄν]]&lt;!--[sic] (neuter), not ὤν (masculine)--&gt;, ''on'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Present tense]] [[participle]] of the [[verb]] [[wikt:εἰμί|εἰμί]], ''eimí'', i.e. "to be, I am"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genitive|gen.]] ὄντος, ''ontos'', "being; that which is") and ''[[wikt:-logia|-logia]]'' (Gr. [[wikt:-λογία|-λογία]], "logical discourse"). See [[classical compound]]s for this type of word formation.&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict&gt;{{cite web|title=ontology|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/ontology|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LSJ&gt;{{LSJ|ei)mi/1|εἰμί|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[etymology]] is Greek, the oldest extant record of the word itself, the [[New Latin]] form ''ontologia'', appeared in 1606 in the work ''Ogdoas Scholastica'' by [[Jacob Lorhard]] (''Lorhardus'') and in 1613 in the ''Lexicon philosophicum'' by [[Rudolf Göckel]] (''Goclenius'').

The first occurrence in English of ''ontology'' as recorded by the ''OED'' (''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', online edition, 2008) came in a work by Gideon Harvey (1636/7–1702): ''Archelogia philosophica nova; or, New principles of Philosophy. Containing Philosophy in general, Metaphysicks or Ontology, Dynamilogy or a Discourse of Power, Religio Philosophi or Natural Theology, Physicks or Natural philosophy'', London, Thomson, 1663.&lt;ref&gt;[https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A43008.0001.001?view=toc Early English Books]&lt;/ref&gt; The word was first used in its Latin form by philosophers based on the Latin roots, which themselves are based on the Greek.

[[Leibniz]] is the only one of the great philosophers of the 17th century to have used the term ''ontology''.&lt;ref&gt;Michaël Devaux and Marco Lamanna, "The Rise and Early History of the Term Ontology (1606–1730)", ''Quaestio.Yearbook of the History of the Metaphysics'', 9, 2009, pp. 173-208 (on Leibniz pp. 197-198).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Some philosophers, notably in the traditions of the [[Platonism|Platonic school]], contend that all nouns (including [[abstract noun]]s) refer to existent entities.{{citation needed|date= September 2017}} Other philosophers contend that nouns do not always name entities, but that some provide a kind of shorthand for reference to a collection either of [[object (philosophy)|objects]] or of [[event (philosophy)|events]]. In this latter view, ''[[mind]]'', instead of referring to an entity, refers to a collection of ''mental events'' experienced by a ''[[person]]''; ''[[society]]'' refers to a collection of ''persons'' with some shared characteristics, and ''[[geometry]]'' refers to a collection of specific kinds of intellectual activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=XU5atV1nfukC&amp;dq=platonic+writings+griswold&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q= |title= Platonic Writings/Platonic Readings |first= Charles L. |last= Griswold |publisher= Penn State Press |year= 2001 |page= 237 |isbn= 978-0-271-02137-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=October 2017}} Between these poles of [[Platonic realism|realism]] and [[nominalism]] stand a variety of [[Moderate realism|other positions]].

=== Some fundamental questions ===
Principal questions of ontology include:{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* "What can be said to exist?"
* "What is a thing?"&lt;ref name="Isham"&gt;Isham, C.J. (1995). ''Lectures on Quantum Theory: Mathematical and Structural Foundations'', Imperial College Press, London, {{ISBN|1-86094-000-5}}, pp. 63–67.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Into what categories, if any, can we sort existing things?"
* "What are the meanings of being?"
* "What are the various [[mode (disambiguation)|mode]]s of being of entities?"

Various [[philosopher]]s have provided different answers to these questions. One common approach involves dividing the extant subjects and predicates into groups called [[category of being|categories]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Such lists of categories differ widely from one another, and it is through the co-ordination of different categorical schemes that ontology relates to such fields as [[library and information science|library science]] and [[artificial intelligence]]. Such an understanding of ontological categories, however, is merely [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]], classificatory. Aristotle's categories are the ways in which a being may be addressed simply as a being, such as:&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]] ''Categories'' Vol. 1, Loeb Classical Library, transl. H.P. Cooke, Harvard U.P. 1983&lt;/ref&gt;
* what it is (its 'whatness', [[quiddity]], [[haecceity]] or essence)
* how it is (its 'howness' or qualitativeness)
* how much it is (quantitativeness)
* where it is (its relatedness to other beings)

Further examples of ontological questions include:{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}
* What is [[existence]], i.e. what does it mean for a being to be?
* Is existence a [[Property (philosophy)|property]]?
* Is existence a genus or general class that is simply divided up by specific differences?
* Which entities, if any, are fundamental?
* Are all entities objects?
* How do the [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] of an object relate to the object itself?
* Do physical properties actually exist?
* What features are the [[essence|essential]], as opposed to merely accidental attributes of a given object?
* How many levels of existence or ontological levels are there? And what constitutes a "level"?
* What is a [[physical body|physical object]]?
* Can one give an account of what it means to say that a physical object exists?
* Can one give an account of what it means to say that a non-physical entity exists?
* What constitutes the ''[[identity (philosophy)|identity]]'' of an object?
* When does an object go ''out'' of existence, as opposed to merely ''changing''?
* Do beings exist other than in the modes of objectivity and subjectivity, i.e. is the subject/object split of modern philosophy inevitable?

=== Concepts ===
Essential ontological [[dichotomies]] include:{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

* [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]] and [[particular]]s
* [[Substance theory|substance]] and [[Accident (philosophy)|accident]]
* [[Abstract object|abstract]] and [[Physical object|concrete]] objects
* [[essence]] and [[existence]]
* [[determinism]] and [[indeterminism]]
* [[monism]] and [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]]
* [[idealism]] and [[materialism]]

=== Types ===
Philosophers can classify ontologies in various ways, using criteria such as the degree of abstraction and field of application:&lt;ref name=Petrov /&gt;

# ''[[Upper ontology]]'': concepts supporting development of an ontology, [[meta-ontology]]
# ''Domain ontology'': concepts relevant to a particular topic, [[domain of discourse]], or area of interest, for example, to information technology or to computer languages, or to particular branches of science
# ''Interface ontology'': concepts relevant to the juncture of two disciplines
# ''[[Process ontology]]'': inputs, outputs, constraints, sequencing information, involved in business or engineering processes

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Ontology is an aspect of the [[Samkhya]] school of philosophy from the first millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;GJ Larson, RS Bhattacharya and K Potter (2014), ''The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 4: Samkhya'', Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-691-60441-1}}, pages 3-11&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of [[Guna]] which describes the three properties ([[sattva]], [[rajas]] and [[Tamas (philosophy)|tamas]]) present in differing proportions in all existing things, is a notable concept of this school.&lt;ref&gt;"The archaic ontology of Chändogya Upanisad VI.2-5, for example, with its emphasis on primordial Being [sat) in its tripartite manifestations as fire (red), water (white), and food (black), correlated with speech, breath, and mind, probably foreshadows the later Sâmkhya ontological notions of prakrti, the three gunas, and the preexistence of the effect." ''The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 4: Samkhya'', cit. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Parmenides and monism ====
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
[[Parmenides]] was among the first in the Greek tradition to propose an ontological characterization of the fundamental nature of existence. In his prologue or [[Parmenides#Proem|proem]] he describes two views of [[existence]]; initially that nothing comes from nothing, and therefore [[existence]] is [[Monism|eternal]]. Consequently, our opinions about truth must often be false and deceitful. Most of [[western philosophy]] — including the fundamental concepts of [[falsifiability]] — have emerged from this view. This posits that existence is what may be conceived of by thought, created, or possessed. Hence, there may be neither void nor vacuum; and true reality neither may come into being nor vanish from existence. Rather, the entirety of creation is eternal, uniform, and immutable, though not infinite (he characterized its shape as that of a perfect sphere). Parmenides thus posits that change, as perceived in everyday experience, is illusory. Everything that may be apprehended is but one part of a single entity. This idea somewhat anticipates the modern concept of an ultimate [[grand unification theory]] that finally describes all of existence in terms of one inter-related [[Particle physics|sub-atomic]] reality which applies to everything.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==== Ontological pluralism ====
{{Main|Ontological pluralism}}

The opposite of [[eleatic]] monism is the pluralistic conception of [[Being]]. In the 5th century BC, [[Anaxagoras]] and [[Leucippus]] replaced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://press.princeton.edu/titles/8303.html |title=Sample Chapter for Graham, D. W.: Explaining the Cosmos: The Ionian Tradition of Scientific Philosophy |publisher=Press.princeton.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; the reality of Being (unique and unchanging) with that of [[Becoming (philosophy)|Becoming]] and therefore by a more fundamental and elementary [[ontic]] plurality. This thesis originated in the Hellenic world, stated in two different ways by Anaxagoras and by Leucippus. The first theory dealt with "seeds" (which Aristotle referred to as "homeomeries") of the various substances. The second was the atomistic theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atomism-ancient/ |title=Ancient Atomism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which dealt with reality as based on the [[vacuum]], the atoms and their intrinsic movement in it.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The materialist [[atomism]] proposed by Leucippus was [[indeterminism|indeterminist]], but then developed by [[Democritus]] in a [[determinism|deterministic]] way. It was later (4th century BC) that the original atomism was taken again as indeterministic by [[Epicurus]]. He confirmed the reality as composed of an infinity of indivisible, unchangeable corpuscles or [[atom]]s (''atomon'', lit. 'uncuttable'), but he gives weight to characterize atoms while for Leucippus they are characterized by a "figure", an "order" and a "position" in the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', I, 4, 985&lt;/ref&gt; They are, besides, creating the whole with the intrinsic movement in the ''vacuum'', producing the diverse flux of being. Their movement is influenced by the ''parenklisis'' ([[Lucretius]] names it [[clinamen]]) and that is determined by the [[Randomness|chance]]. These ideas foreshadowed our understanding of [[physics|traditional physics]] until the nature of atoms was discovered in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, C., Latsis, J. S., &amp; Martins, N.

[[Plato]] developed this distinction between true reality and illusion, in arguing that what is real are eternal and unchanging [[Theory of Forms|Forms]] or Ideas (a precursor to [[universal (metaphysics)|universals]]), of which things experienced in sensation are at best merely copies, and real only in so far as they copy ('partake of') such Forms. In general, Plato presumes that all nouns (e.g., 'Beauty') refer to real entities, whether sensible bodies or insensible Forms. Hence, in [[Sophist (dialogue)|''The Sophist'']] Plato argues that Being is a Form in which all existent things participate and which they have in common (though it is unclear whether 'Being' is intended in the sense of [[existence]], [[copula (linguistics)|copula]], or [[identity (philosophy)|identity]]); and argues, against Parmenides, that Forms must exist not only of Being, but also of [[Negation]] and of non-Being (or Difference).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In his [[Categories (Aristotle)|''Categories'']], Aristotle identifies ten possible kinds of things that may be the subject or the predicate of a proposition. For Aristotle there are four different ontological dimensions:{{Citation needed|date=April 2011|reason=three of these are discussed in Book Theta, but I do not see clear support for "four different ontological dimensions"}}
# according to the various categories or ways of addressing a being as such
# according to its truth or falsity (e.g. fake gold, counterfeit money)
# whether it exists in and of itself or simply 'comes along' by accident
# according to its potency, movement (energy) or finished presence ([[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|''Metaphysics'' Book Theta]]).

According to [[Avicenna]], and in an interpretation of Greek Aristotelian and Platonist ontological doctrines in medieval [[metaphysics]], being is either necessary, contingent ''qua'' possible, or impossible. Necessary being is that which cannot but be, since its non-being entails a contradiction. Contingent ''qua'' possible being is neither necessary nor impossible for it to be or not to be. It is ontologically neutral, and is brought from potential existing into actual existence by way of a cause that is external to its essence. Its being is borrowed unlike the necessary existent, which is self-subsisting and is impossible for it not to be. As for the impossible, it necessarily does not exist, and the affirmation of its being is a contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nader El-Bizri]], '[[Avicenna]] and [[Essentialism]], Review of [[Metaphysics]], Vol. 54 (2001), pp. 753-778.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other ontological topics ==

=== Ontological formations ===
The concept of 'ontological formations' refers to formations of social relations understood as dominant ways of living. Temporal, spatial, corporeal, epistemological and performative relations are taken to be central to understanding a dominant formation. That is, a particular ontological formation is based on how ontological categories of time, space, embodiment, knowing and performing are lived—objectively and subjectively. Different ontological formations include the customary (including the tribal), the traditional, the modern and the postmodern. The concept was first introduced by [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James']] ''Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last= James | first= Paul |authorlink= Paul James (academic) | title= Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism: Bringing Theory Back In —Volume 2 of Towards a Theory of Abstract Community |url= https://www.academia.edu/1642214/Globalism_Nationalism_Tribalism_Bringing_Theory_Back_In_author_Sage_Publications_London_2006 | year= 2006 | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London }}&lt;/ref&gt; together with a series of writers including Damian Grenfell and [[Manfred Steger]].

In the [[engaged theory]] approach, ontological formations are seen as layered and intersecting rather than singular formations. They are 'formations of being'. This approach avoids the usual problems of a Great Divide being posited between the modern and the pre-modern. From a philosophical distinction concerning different formations of being, the concept then provides a way of translating into practical understandings concerning how humans might design cities and communities that live creatively across different ontological formations, for example cities that are not completely dominated by modern valences of spatial configuration. Here the work of Tony Fry is important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2014 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | chapter= Urban Design in the Global South: Ontological Design in Practice | title= Design in the Borderlands | editor= Tony Fry and Eleni Kalantidou | url= https://www.academia.edu/9161853/Urban_Design_in_the_Global_South_Ontological_Design_in_Practice_2014_ | publisher= Routledge | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ontological and epistemological certainty ===
[[René Descartes]], with ''je pense donc je suis'' or ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'' or "I think, therefore I am", argued that "the self" is something that we can know exists with [[epistemology|epistemological]] certainty. Descartes argued further that this knowledge could lead to a proof of the certainty of the [[existence of God]], using the [[ontological argument]] that had been formulated first by [[Anselm of Canterbury]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Certainty about the existence of "the self" and "the other", however, came under increasing criticism in the 20th century. Sociological theorists, most notably [[George Herbert Mead]] and [[Erving Goffman]], saw the [[Cartesian Other]] as a "Generalized Other", the imaginary audience that individuals use when thinking about the self. According to Mead, "we do not assume there is a self to begin with. Self is not presupposed as a stuff out of which the world arises. Rather, the self arises in the world".&lt;ref name=Hyde&gt;Hyde, R. Bruce. "Listening Authentically: A Heideggerian Perspective on Interpersonal Communication". In ''Interpretive Approaches to Interpersonal Communication'', edited by Kathryn Carter and Mick Presnell. State University of New York Press, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7914-1847-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mead, G. H. ''The individual and the social self: Unpublished work of George Herbert Mead'' (D. L. Miller, Ed.). Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982. (p. 107). {{ISBN|0-226-51673-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Cartesian Other was also used by [[Sigmund Freud]], who saw the [[Ego, superego, and id|superego]] as an abstract regulatory force, and [[Émile Durkheim]] who viewed this as a psychologically manifested entity which represented God in society at large.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

=== Body and environment, questioning the meaning of being ===
Schools of [[metaphysical subjectivism|subjectivism]], [[metaphysical objectivism|objectivism]] and [[relativism]] existed at various times in the 20th century, and the [[postmodernism|postmodernists]] and [[embodied philosophy|body philosophers]] tried to reframe all these questions in terms of bodies taking some specific [[philosophy of action|action]] in an environment. This relied to a great degree on insights derived from scientific research into animals taking instinctive action in natural and artificial settings—as studied by [[biology]], [[ecology]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/articles/napflion.pdf Barry Smith: Objects and Their Environments: From Aristotle to Ecological Ontology] The Life and Motion of SocioEconomic Units (GISDATA 8), London: Taylor and Francis, 2001, 79-97.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cognitive science]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The processes by which bodies related to environments became of great concern, and the idea of [[being]] itself became difficult to really define. What did people mean when they said "A is B", "A must be B", "A was B"...? Some linguists advocated dropping the verb "to be" from the English language, leaving "[[E-Prime|E&amp;nbsp;Prime]]", supposedly less prone to bad abstractions. Others, mostly philosophers, tried to dig into the word and its usage. [[Martin Heidegger]] distinguished ''human being'' as ''existence'' from the being of things in the world. Heidegger proposes that our way of being human and the way the world is for us are cast historically through a fundamental ontological questioning. These fundamental ontological categories provide the basis for communication in an age: a horizon of unspoken and seemingly unquestionable background meanings, such as human beings understood unquestioningly as subjects and other entities understood unquestioningly as objects. Because these basic ontological meanings both generate and are regenerated in everyday interactions, the locus of our way of being in a historical epoch is the communicative event of language in use.&lt;ref name=Hyde /&gt; For Heidegger, however, communication in the ''first'' place is not among human beings, but language itself shapes up in response to questioning (the inexhaustible meaning of) being.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, Martin, ''On the Way to Language'' Harper &amp; Row, New York 1971. German edition: ''Unterwegs zur Sprache'' Neske, Pfullingen 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the focus of traditional ontology on the 'whatness' or ''quidditas'' of beings in their substantial, standing presence can be shifted to pose the question of the 'whoness' of human being itself.&lt;ref&gt;Eldred, Michael, [http://www.arte-fact.org/sclontlg.html ''Social Ontology: Recasting Political Philosophy Through a Phenomenology of Whoness''] ontos, Frankfurt 2008 xiv + 688 pp. {{ISBN|978-3-938793-78-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ontology and language ===
Some philosophers suggest that the question of "What is?" is (at least in part) an issue of ''usage'' rather than a question about facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Introduction to an Ontology of Intellectual Property | publisher=The Scitech Lawyer, ABA| author=Carvalko, Joseph | year= Summer 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective is conveyed by an analogy made by [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]: Suppose a person refers to a 'cup' as a 'chair' and makes some comments pertinent to a cup, but uses the word 'chair' consistently throughout instead of 'cup'. One might readily catch on that this person simply calls a 'cup' a 'chair' and the oddity is explained.&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;Davidson refers to a 'ketch' and a 'yawl'; see p. 18 in {{cite journal |author=Donald Davidson |title=On the very idea of a conceptual scheme |journal=Proceedings and Address of the American Philosophical Association |volume=47 |pages=5–20 |year=1974 |url=http://files.meetup.com/328570/davidson_on-the-very-idea.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analogously, if we find people asserting 'there are' such-and-such, and we do not ourselves think that 'such-and-such' exist, we might conclude that these people are not nuts (Davidson calls this assumption 'charity'), they simply use 'there are' differently than we do. The question of ''What is?'' is at least partially a topic in the philosophy of language, and is not entirely about ontology itself.&lt;ref name=Krieger&gt;{{cite book |author=Uriah Kriegel |url=http://www.uriahkriegel.com/downloads/defenses.pdf |title=Two defenses of common-sense ontology |journal =Dialectica |volume=65 |year=2011 |pages=177–204 |doi=10.1111/j.1746-8361.2011.01262.x |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This viewpoint has been expressed by [[Eli Hirsch]].&lt;ref name=Hirsch&gt;{{cite book |author=Hirsch, Eli |title=Quantifier Variance and Realism: Essays in Metaontology |chapter= Chapter 9: Physical-object ontology, verbal disputes and common sense |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iPRqtcjeHPsC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144 |pages=144–177 |isbn=978-0-19-973211-1 |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press}} First published as [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1933-1592.2005.tb00506.x/abstract "Physical-Object Ontology, Verbal Disputes, and Common Sense"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hirsch1&gt;{{cite book |author=Hirsch, Eli |title=Quantifier Variance and Realism: Essays in Metaontology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iPRqtcjeHPsC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;lpg=PA68|pages=68–95 |chapter=Chapter 5: Quantifier variance and realism |isbn=978-0-19-973211-1 |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press}} First published as [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1758-2237.2002.tb00061.x/abstract "Quantifier variance and realism"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hirsch interprets [[Hilary Putnam]] as asserting that different concepts of "the existence of something" can be correct.&lt;ref name=Hirsch1 /&gt; This position does not contradict the view that some things do exist, but points out that different 'languages' will have different rules about assigning this property.&lt;ref name=Hirsch1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hirsch2&gt;{{cite book |author=Hirsch, E. |year=2004 |chapter=Sosa's Existential Relativism |title=Ernest Sosa and His Critics |pages=224–232 |editor=John Greco, ed |publisher=Blackwell |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Moz8OeX4w8AC&amp;pg=PA224 |isbn=0-470-75547-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; How to determine the 'fitness' of a 'language' to the world then becomes a subject for investigation.

Common to all [[Indo-European copula]] languages is the double use of the verb "to be" in both stating that entity X exists ("X is.") as well as stating that X has a property ("X is P"). It is sometimes argued that a third use is also distinct, stating that X is a member of a class ("X is a C").   In other language families these roles may have completely different verbs and are less likely to be confused with one another. For example they might say something like "the car has redness" rather than "the car is red".  Hence any discussion of "being" in Indo-European language philosophy may need to make distinctions between these senses.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

=== Ontology and human geography ===
In human geography there are two types of ontology: small "o" which accounts for the practical orientation, describing functions of being a part of the group, thought to oversimplify and ignore key activities. The other "o", or big "O", systematically, logically, and rationally describes the essential characteristics and universal traits. This concept relates closely to Plato's view that the human mind can only perceive a bigger world if they continue to live within the confines of their "caves". However, in spite of the differences, ontology relies on the symbolic agreements among members. That said, ontology is crucial for the axiomatic language frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, F. (2006). Ontology. In B. Warf (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Human Geography''. (pp. 341-343). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reality and actuality ===
According to [[Alfred North Whitehead|A.N. Whitehead]], for ontology, it is useful to distinguish the terms 'reality' and 'actuality'. In this view, an 'actual entity' has a philosophical status of fundamental ontological priority, while a 'real entity' is one which may be actual, or may derive its reality from its logical relation to some actual entity or entities. For example, an occasion in the life of Socrates is an actual entity. But Socrates' being a man does not make 'man' an actual entity, because it refers indeterminately to many actual entities, such as several occasions in the life of Socrates, and also to several occasions in the lives of Alcibiades, and of others. But the notion of man is real; it derives its reality from its reference to those many actual occasions, each of which is an actual entity. An actual occasion is a concrete entity, while terms such as 'man' are abstractions from many concrete relevant entities.

According to Whitehead, an actual entity must earn its philosophical status of fundamental ontological priority by satisfying several philosophical criteria, as follows.
* There is no going behind an actual entity, to find something more fundamental in fact or in efficacy. This criterion is to be regarded as expressing an axiom, or postulated distinguished doctrine.
* An actual entity must be completely determinate in the sense that there may be no confusion about its identity that would allow it to be confounded with another actual entity. In this sense an actual entity is completely concrete, with no potential to be something other than itself. It is what it is. It is a source of potentiality for the creation of other actual entities, of which it may be said to be a part cause. Likewise it is the concretion or realization of potentialities of other actual entities which are its partial causes.
* Causation between actual entities is essential to their actuality. Consequently, for Whitehead, each actual entity has its distinct and definite extension in physical [[Minkowski space]], and so is uniquely identifiable. A description in Minkowski space supports descriptions in time and space for particular observers.
* It is part of the aim of the philosophy of such an ontology as Whitehead's that the actual entities should be all alike, ''qua'' actual entities; they should all satisfy a single definite set of well stated ontological criteria of actuality.

Whitehead proposed that his notion of an occasion of experience satisfies the criteria for its status as the philosophically preferred definition of an actual entity. From a purely logical point of view, each occasion of experience has in full measure the characters of both objective and subjective reality. Subjectivity and objectivity refer to different aspects of an occasion of experience, and in no way do they exclude each other.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead, A.N.]] (1929). ''Process and Reality'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of other philosophical proposals or candidates as actual entities, in this view, are Aristotle's 'substances', Leibniz' monads, and Descartes '' ′res verae' '', and the more modern 'states of affairs'. Aristotle's substances, such as Socrates, have behind them as more fundamental the 'primary substances', and in this sense do not satisfy Whitehead's criteria. Whitehead is not happy with Leibniz' monads as actual entities because they are "windowless" and do not cause each other. 'States of affairs' are often not closely defined, often without specific mention of extension in physical Minkowski space; they are therefore not necessarily processes of becoming, but may be as their name suggests, simply static states in some sense. States of affairs are contingent on particulars, and therefore have something behind them.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Malet Armstrong|Armstrong, D.M.]] (1997). ''A World of States of Affairs'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|0-521-58064-1}}, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; One summary of the Whiteheadian actual entity is that it is a process of becoming. Another summary, referring to its causal linkage to other actual entities, is that it is "all window", in contrast with Leibniz' windowless monads.

This view allows philosophical entities other than actual entities to really exist, but not as fundamentally and primarily factual or causally efficacious; they have existence as abstractions, with reality only derived from their reference to actual entities. A Whiteheadian actual entity has a unique and completely definite place and time. Whiteheadian abstractions are not so tightly defined in time and place, and in the extreme, some are timeless and placeless, or 'eternal' entities. All abstractions have logical or conceptual rather than efficacious existence; their lack of definite time does not make them unreal if they refer to actual entities. Whitehead calls this 'the ontological principle'.

=== Microcosmic ontology ===
There is an established and long philosophical history of the concept of atoms as microscopic physical objects.They are far too small to be visible to the naked eye. It was as recent as the nineteenth century that precise estimates of the sizes of putative physical [[atom]]s began to become plausible. Almost direct empirical observation of atomic effects was due to the theoretical investigation of [[Brownian motion]] by [[Albert Einstein]] in the very early twentieth century. But even then, the real existence of atoms was debated by some. Such debate might be labeled 'microcosmic ontology'. Here the word 'microcosm' is used to indicate a physical world of small entities, such as for example atoms.

Subatomic particles are usually considered to be much smaller than atoms. Their real or actual existence may be very difficult to demonstrate empirically.&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser, D. (1994). Niels Bohr's legacy in contemporary particle physics, pp. 257–268 of ''Niels Bohr and Contemporary Philosophy'', edited by J. Faye, H.J. Folse, Springer, Dordrecht, {{ISBN|978-90-481-4299-6}}, Section 4, Questions of ontology and particle  physics phenomenology, pp. 262–264.&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction is sometimes drawn between actual and [[virtual particle|virtual]] subatomic particles. Reasonably, one may ask, in what sense, if any, do virtual particles exist as physical entities? For atomic and subatomic particles, difficult questions arise, such as do they possess a precise position, or a precise momentum? A question that continues to be controversial is 'to what kind of physical thing, if any, does the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[wave function]] refer?'.&lt;ref name="Isham" /&gt;

=== Ontological argument ===
{{main|Ontological argument}}
The first ontological argument in the [[Christian philosophy|Western Christian]] tradition&lt;ref&gt;"There are three main periods in the history of ontological arguments. The first was in 11th century, when St. Anselm of Canterbury came up with the first ontological argument." Miroslaw Szatkowski (ed.), ''Ontological Proofs Today'', Ontos Verlag, 2012, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; was proposed by [[Anselm of Canterbury]] in his 1078 work ''[[Proslogion]]''. Anselm defined God as "that than which nothing greater can be thought", and argued that this being must exist in the mind, even in the mind of the person who denies the existence of God. He suggested that, if the greatest possible being exists in the mind, it must also exist in reality. If it only exists in the mind, then an even greater being must be possible—one which exists both in the mind and in reality. Therefore, this greatest possible being must exist in reality. Seventeenth century French philosopher [[René Descartes]] deployed a similar argument. Descartes published several variations of his argument, each of which centred on the idea that God's existence is immediately inferable from a "clear and distinct" idea of a supremely perfect being. In the early eighteenth century, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] augmented Descartes' ideas in an attempt to prove that a "supremely perfect" being is a coherent concept. A more recent ontological argument came from [[Kurt Gödel]], who proposed a [[Formal logic|formal argument]] for God's existence. Norman Malcolm revived the ontological argument in 1960 when he located a second, stronger ontological argument in Anselm's work; [[Alvin Plantinga]] challenged this argument and proposed an alternative, based on [[modal logic]]. Attempts have also been made to validate Anselm's proof using an [[automated theorem prover]]. Other arguments have been categorised as ontological, including those made by Islamic philosophers [[Mulla Sadra]] and [[Allama Tabatabai]].

===Hintikka's locution for existence===

[[Jaakko Hintikka]] puts the view that a useful explication of the notion of existence is in the words "one can find", implicitly in some world or [[Domain of discourse|universe of discourse]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jaakko Hintikka|Hintikka, J.]] (1998), ''Paradigms for Language Theory and Other Essays'', Springer Science + Business Media, Dordrecht, {{ISBN|978-90-481-4930-8}}, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{alphabet}}
The '''Paleohispanic scripts''' are the writing systems created in the [[Iberian peninsula]] before the [[Latin alphabet]] became the dominant script. Most of them are unusual in that they are [[semi-syllabary|semi-syllabic]] rather than purely [[alphabetic]], despite having supposedly developed, in part, from the [[Phoenician alphabet]]. 

Paleohispanic scripts are known to have been used from the 5th century BCE — possibly from the 7th century, in the opinion of some researchers — until the end of the 1st century BCE or the beginning of the 1st century CE, and were the main scripts used to write the [[Paleohispanic languages]]. Some researchers conclude that their origin may lie solely with the Phoenician alphabet, while others believe the [[Greek alphabet]] may have had also a role.

==Scripts==
The Paleoiberian scripts are classified into three major groups: southern, northern, and Greco-Iberian, with differences both in the shapes of the glyphs and in their values. 

Inscriptions in the southern scripts have been found mainly in the southern half of the Iberian Peninsula. They represent only 5% of the inscriptions found, and mostly read from right to left (like the Phoenician alphabet). They are:

* the [[Espanca script]] (known from a single tablet, and the only attestation of an alphabetical order);
* the Tartessian or [[Southwest script|Southwestern script]], also known as ''South Lusitanian''; 
* the [[Southeastern Iberian script]], also known as ''Meridional''.

Inscriptions in the northern scripts have been found mainly in the NE of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. They represent 95% of the inscriptions found, and mostly read from left to right (like the Greek alphabet). They are:

* the [[Northeastern Iberian script]], also known as ''Levantine'';
** Dual variant
** Non-dual variant
* the [[Celtiberian script]]
**Western variant
**Eastern variant. 

The [[Greco-Iberian alphabet]] was a direct adaptation of the Ionic variety of the [[Greek alphabet]], and only found  in a small region on the [[Mediterranean]] coast in the modern provinces of [[Alicante (province)|Alicante]] and [[Murcia (province)|Murcia]].

==Typology==
Excepting the Greco-Iberian alphabet, and to a lesser extent the Tartessian (southwestern) script, Paleoiberian scripts shared a distinctive [[Linguistic typology|typology]]:  They behaved as a [[syllabary]] for the [[plosive]]s and as an [[alphabet]] for the rest of consonants. This unique [[writing system]] has been called a ''[[semi-syllabary]]''.

In the syllabic portions of the scripts, each plosive sign stood for a different combination of consonant and vowel, so that the written form of ''ga'' displayed no resemblance to ''ge'', and ''bi'' looked quite different from ''bo''. In addition, the original format did not distinguish [[voice (phonetics)|voiced from unvoiced]] plosives, so that ''ga'' stood for both /ga/ and /ka/, and ''da'' stood for both /da/ and /ta/. 

On the other hand, the continuants ([[fricative consonant|fricative]] sounds like /s/ and [[sonorant]]s like /l/, /m/, [[trill consonant|trills]], and vowels) were written with simple alphabetic letters, as in [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] and [[Greek alphabet|Greek]]. 

Over the past few decades, many researchers have come to believe that one variant of the [[northeastern Iberian script]], the older one according to the archaeological contexts, distinguished [[voice (phonetics)|voicing]] in the plosives by adding a stroke to the glyphs for the [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] (/d/~/t/) and [[velar consonant|velar]] (/g/~/k/) syllables, creating distinct glyphs for unvoiced /t/ and /k/, and restricting the original glyphs to voiced /d/ and /g/. (This is the so-called dual signary model: see [[northeastern Iberian script]].) If correct, this innovation would parallel the creation of the Latin letter G by the addition of a stroke to C, which had previously stood for both /k/ and /g/.

===Tartessian===

The [[Southwest script|Tartessian script]] is typologically intermediate between a pure alphabet and the Paleohispanic  semi-syllabaries. Although the letter used to write a plosive was determined by the following vowel, as in a  semi-syllabary, the following vowel was also written, as in an alphabet. (See [[Tartessian language]] for an example.) This redundant typology re-emerged in a few late (2nd and 1st century BCE) texts of [[northeastern Iberian script|northeastern Iberian]] and [[Celtiberian script|Celtiberian]] scripts, where vowels were once again written after plosives. Some scholars treat Tartessian as a redundant semi-syllabary, with essentially syllabic glyphs followed by the letter for the corresponding vowel; others treat it as a redundant alphabet, with the choice of an essentially consonantal character decided by the following vowel.&lt;ref name=Hoz&gt;''Hoz, Javier de (2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is analogous to the [[Old Persian cuneiform script]], where vowels were most often written overtly but where consonants/syllables were decided by the vowel about half the time, and, to a very limited extent, to the [[Etruscan alphabet]], where most syllables based the consonant /k/ shared neither consonant nor vowel letter: Only the combinations CE, CI, KA, and QU were permitted. (This Etruscan convention is preserved in the English, not only in ''qu'' for ''queen,'' but also the letter names ''cee, kay, cue/qu''.)

== Origins ==

The paleoiberian semi-syllabaries clearly derive ultimately from an [[alphabet]] or alphabets circulating in the [[Mediterranean]], but it is not known whether that was the [[Phoenician alphabet]] alone, or if archaic varieties of the [[Greek alphabet]] also played a role. 

The only known full Paleoiberian signary, on the undated [[Espanca script|Espanca tablet]] (not completely readable, but clearly related to the southwestern and southeastern scripts), follows the Phoenician/Greek order for the first 13 of its 27 letters: Α Β Γ Δ Ι Κ Λ Μ Ν Ξ Π? {{lang|grc|ϻ}} Τ. The fact that southern paleohispanic /e/ appears to derive from the Phoenician letter ‘ayin, which gave rise to Greek Ο, while southern iberian /o/ derives from another letter or was perhaps invented,&lt;ref name=espanca&gt;[http://www.webpersonal.net/jrr/espanca_en.htm Ramos, ''A Palæo-Iberian Alphabet: Espanca's Stele''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103082735/http://www.webpersonal.net/jrr/espanca_en.htm |date=2007-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the development of vowels in paleoiberian semi-syllabaries was independent of the Greek innovation. However, the order of what appears to be /u/ directly after Τ, rather than at the place of {{lang|grc|Ϝ}}, has suggested to some researchers a Greek influence. (In addition, the letter for /e/ in northeast Iberian resembles Greek Ε rather than the southeast Iberian letter.) The two [[sibilants]], S and S', are attested, but there is one sign too few to account for a full 15-sign syllabary and all four of the letters M, M', R, and R' (not all of which can be positively identified with letters from the tablet), suggesting that one of ems or ars shown in the charts to the right is only a graphic variant. 

The obvious question about the origin and evolution of these scripts is how a purely alphabetic script was changed into, or perhaps unconsciously reinterpreted as, a partial syllabary. It may be instructive to consider an unrelated development in the evolution of the [[Etruscan alphabet]] from Greek: Greek had three letters, Γ, Κ, and {{lang|grc|Ϙ}}, whose sounds were not distinguished in Etruscan. Nonetheless, all three were borrowed, becoming the letters C, K, and Q. All were pronounced /k/, but they were restricted to appear before different vowels — CE, CI, KA, and QU, respectively, — so that the consonants carried almost as much weight in distinguishing these syllables as the vowels did. (This may have been an attempt to overtly indicate the vowel-dependent [[allophony]] of Etruscan /k/ with the extra Greek letters that were available.) When the Etruscan alphabet was later adapted to [[Latin]], the letter C stood for both /k/ and /g/, as Etruscan had had no /g/ sound to maintain the original sound value of Greek Г. (Later a stroke was added to C, creating the new Latin letter G.). 

Something similar may have happened during the evolution of the Paleoiberian scripts. If writing passed from the Phoenicians through the Tartessians, and the [[Tartessian language]] did not have a /g/ or a /d/, that would explain the absence of a distinction between /g/ and /k/, /d/ and /t/ in the southeastern Iberian and later northeast Iberian scripts, despite it being clear that these were distinct sounds in the [[Iberian language]], as is clearly attested in the [[Greco-Iberian alphabet]] and later use of the Latin alphabet. In [[Tartessian script]], vowels were always written after the plosives, but they were redundant — or at nearly so — and thus it seems they were dropped when the script passed to the [[Iberians]]. 

Among the [[velar consonant]]s, ''ka/ga'' of southeastern Iberian and the southwestern script derives from Phoenician/Greek Γ, ''ke/ge'' from Κ, and ''ki/gi'' from {{lang|grc|Ϙ}},&lt;ref name=espanca/&gt; while ''ko/go'' (perhaps coincidentally) resembles Greek Χ (pronounced {{IPA-el|kʰ|}}). Phoenician/Greek labial letter Β was the source of southwestern ''be'', southeastern ''ba''; the use of Π is uncertain but may have been the source of ''bi.'' (If Greek was used as a secondary source, Greek Φ ({{IPA|[pʰ]}}) would also have been available.) For the [[alveolar consonant|alveolars]], Δ was the source of ''tu/du,'' Τ of ''ta/da,'' and Θ of ''ti/di.''&lt;ref name=espanca/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22099">In [[corpus linguistics]], '''part-of-speech tagging''' ('''POS tagging''' or '''PoS tagging''' or '''POST'''), also called '''[[grammar|grammatical]] tagging''' or '''[[lexical category|word-category]] disambiguation''', is the process of marking up a word in a text (corpus) as corresponding to a particular [[parts of speech|part of speech]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sketchengine.eu/pos-tags/ |title=POS tags |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-03-27 |website=[[Sketch Engine]] |publisher=Lexical Computing |access-date=2018-04-06 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on both its definition and its context&amp;mdash;i.e., its [[lexicography|relationship with adjacent and related words]] in a [[phrase]], [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], or [[paragraph]].
A simplified form of this is commonly taught to school-age children, in the identification of words as [[noun]]s, [[verb]]s, [[adjective]]s, [[adverb]]s, etc.

Once performed by hand, POS tagging is now done in the context of [[computational linguistics]], using [[algorithms]] which associate discrete terms, as well as hidden parts of speech, in accordance with a set of descriptive tags. POS-tagging algorithms fall into two distinctive groups: rule-based and stochastic. [[Brill tagger|E. Brill's tagger]], one of the first and most widely used English POS-taggers, employs rule-based algorithms.

==Principle==
Part-of-speech tagging is harder than just having a list of words and their parts of speech, because some words can represent more than one part of speech at different times, and because some parts of speech are complex or unspoken. This is not rare—in [[natural language]]s (as opposed to many [[Constructed language|artificial language]]s), a large percentage of word-forms are ambiguous. For example, even "dogs", which is usually thought of as just a plural noun, can also be a verb:
:The sailor dogs the hatch.
Correct grammatical tagging will reflect that "dogs" is here used as a verb, not as the more common plural noun. Grammatical context is one way to determine this; semantic analysis can also be used to infer that "sailor" and "hatch" implicate "dogs" as 1) in the nautical context and 2) an action applied to the object "hatch" (in this context, "dogs" is a [[seamanship|nautical]] term meaning "fastens (a watertight door) securely").

Schools commonly teach that there are 9 [[parts of speech]] in English: [[noun]], [[verb]], [[Article (grammar)|article]], [[adjective]], [[Preposition and postposition|preposition]], [[pronoun]], [[adverb]], [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]], and [[interjection]]. However, there are clearly many more categories and sub-categories. For nouns, the plural, possessive, and singular forms can be distinguished. In many languages words are also marked for their "[[Grammatical case|case]]" (role as subject, object, etc.), [[grammatical gender]], and so on; while verbs are marked for [[Grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], and other things. Linguists distinguish parts of speech to various fine degrees, reflecting a chosen "tagging system".

In part-of-speech tagging by computer, it is typical to distinguish from 50 to 150 separate parts of speech for English. For example, NN for singular common nouns, NNS for plural common nouns, NP for singular proper nouns (see the [[Brown Corpus#Part-of-speech tags used|POS tags]] used in the Brown Corpus). Work on [[stochastic]] methods for tagging [[Koine Greek]] (DeRose 1990) has used over 1,000 parts of speech, and found that about as many words were [[ambiguous]] there as in English.  A morphosyntactic descriptor in the case of morphologically rich languages is commonly expressed using very short mnemonics, such as '''Ncmsan'' for Category=Noun, Type = common, Gender = masculine, Number = singular, Case = accusative, Animate = no.

==History==

===The Brown Corpus===
Research on part-of-speech tagging has been closely tied to [[corpus linguistics]]. The first major corpus of English for computer analysis was the [[Brown Corpus]] developed at [[Brown University]] by [[Henry Kučera]] and [[W. Nelson Francis]], in the mid-1960s. It consists of about 1,000,000 words of running English prose text, made up of 500 samples from randomly chosen publications. Each sample is 2,000 or more words (ending at the first sentence-end after 2,000 words, so that the corpus contains only complete sentences).

The [[Brown Corpus]] was painstakingly "tagged" with part-of-speech markers over many years. A first approximation was done with a program by Greene and Rubin, which consisted of a huge handmade list of what categories could co-occur at all. For example, article then noun can occur, but article verb (arguably) cannot. The program got about 70% correct. Its results were repeatedly reviewed and corrected by hand, and later users sent in errata, so that by the late 70s the tagging was nearly perfect (allowing for some cases on which even human speakers might not agree).

This corpus has been used for innumerable studies of word-frequency and of part-of-speech, and inspired the development of similar "tagged" corpora in many other languages. Statistics derived by analyzing it formed the basis for most later part-of-speech tagging systems, such as [[CLAWS (linguistics)]] and [[VOLSUNGA]]. However, by this time (2005) it has been superseded by larger corpora such as the 100 million word [[British National Corpus]].

For some time, part-of-speech tagging was considered an inseparable part of [[natural language processing]], because there are certain cases where the correct part of speech cannot be decided without understanding the [[semantics]] or even the [[pragmatics]] of the context. This is extremely expensive, especially because analyzing the higher levels is much harder when multiple part-of-speech possibilities must be considered for each word.

===Use of hidden Markov models===
In the mid 1980s, researchers in Europe began to use [[hidden Markov model]]s (HMMs) to disambiguate parts of speech, when working to tag the [[Lancaster-Oslo-Bergen Corpus]] of British English. HMMs involve counting cases (such as from the Brown Corpus), and making a table of the probabilities of certain sequences. For example, once you've seen an article such as 'the', perhaps the next word is a noun 40% of the time, an adjective 40%, and a number 20%. Knowing this, a program can decide that "can" in "the can" is far more likely to be a noun than a verb or a modal. The same method can of course be used to benefit from knowledge about following words.

More advanced ("higher order") HMMs learn the probabilities not only of pairs, but triples or even larger sequences. So, for example, if you've just seen a noun followed by a verb, the next item may be very likely a preposition, article, or noun, but much less likely another verb.

When several ambiguous words occur together, the possibilities multiply. However, it is easy to enumerate every combination and to assign a relative probability to each one, by multiplying together the probabilities of each choice in turn. The combination with highest probability is then chosen. The European group developed CLAWS, a tagging program that did exactly this, and achieved accuracy in the 93–95% range.

It is worth remembering, as [[Eugene Charniak]] points out in ''Statistical techniques for natural language parsing'' (1997),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/ec/home.html Eugene Charniak]&lt;/ref&gt; that merely assigning the most common tag to each known word and the tag "[[proper noun]]" to all unknowns will approach 90% accuracy because many words are unambiguous, and many others only rarely represent their less-common parts of speech.

CLAWS pioneered the field of HMM-based part of speech tagging, but was quite expensive since it enumerated all possibilities. It sometimes had to resort to backup methods when there were simply too many options (the Brown Corpus contains a case with 17 ambiguous words in a row, and there are words such as "still" that can represent as many as 7 distinct parts of speech (DeRose 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;82)).

HMMs underlie the functioning of stochastic taggers and are used in various algorithms one of the most widely used being the bi-directional inference algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yatsko.zohosites.com/cll-tagger.html CLL POS-tagger]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dynamic programming methods===
In 1987, [[Steven DeRose]]&lt;ref&gt;DeRose, Steven J. 1988. "Grammatical category disambiguation by statistical optimization."  Computational Linguistics 14(1): 31&amp;ndash;39. [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=49087&amp;CFID=44218900&amp;CFTOKEN=10419730]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kenneth W. Church|Ken Church]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kenneth Ward Church|year=1988|title=A stochastic parts program and noun phrase parser for unrestricted text|journal=ANLC '88: Proceedings of the second conference on Applied natural language processing. Association for Computational Linguistics Stroudsburg, PA|doi=10.3115/974235.974260}}&lt;/ref&gt; independently developed [[dynamic programming]] algorithms to solve the same problem in vastly less time. Their methods were similar to the [[Viterbi algorithm]] known for some time in other fields. DeRose used a table of pairs, while Church used a table of triples and a method of estimating the values for triples that were rare or nonexistent in the Brown Corpus (actual measurement of triple probabilities would require a much larger corpus). Both methods achieved accuracy over 95%. DeRose's 1990 dissertation at [[Brown University]] included analyses of the specific error types, probabilities, and other related data, and replicated his work for Greek, where it proved similarly effective.

These findings were surprisingly disruptive to the field of natural language processing. The accuracy reported was higher than the typical accuracy of very sophisticated algorithms that integrated part of speech choice with many higher levels of linguistic analysis: syntax, morphology, semantics, and so on. CLAWS, DeRose's and Church's methods did fail for some of the known cases where semantics is required, but those proved negligibly rare. This convinced many in the field that part-of-speech tagging could usefully be separated out from the other levels of processing; this in turn simplified the theory and practice of computerized language analysis, and encouraged researchers to find ways to separate out other pieces as well. Markov Models are now the standard method for part-of-speech assignment.

===Unsupervised taggers===
The methods already discussed involve working from a pre-existing corpus to learn tag probabilities. It is, however, also possible to [[Bootstrapping (linguistics)|bootstrap]] using "unsupervised" tagging.  Unsupervised tagging techniques use an untagged corpus for their training data and produce the tagset by induction. That is, they observe patterns in word use, and derive part-of-speech categories themselves. For example, statistics readily reveal that "the", "a", and "an" occur in similar contexts, while "eat" occurs in very different ones. With sufficient iteration, similarity classes of words emerge that are remarkably similar to those human linguists would expect; and the differences themselves sometimes suggest valuable new insights.

These two categories can be further subdivided into rule-based, stochastic, and neural approaches.

===Other taggers and methods===

Some current major algorithms for part-of-speech tagging include the [[Viterbi algorithm]], [[Brill tagger]], [[Constraint Grammar]], and the [[Baum-Welch algorithm]] (also known as the forward-backward algorithm).  Hidden Markov model and [[Markov model|visible Markov model]] taggers can both be implemented using the Viterbi algorithm. The rule-based Brill tagger is unusual in that it learns a set of rule patterns, and then applies those patterns rather than optimizing a statistical quantity. Unlike the Brill tagger where the rules are ordered sequentially, the POS and morphological tagging toolkit [http://rdrpostagger.sourceforge.net/ RDRPOSTagger] stores rules in the form of a [[ripple-down rules]] tree.

Many [[machine learning]] methods have also been applied to the problem of POS tagging. Methods such as [[Support vector machine|SVM]], [[maximum entropy classifier]], [[perceptron]], and [[K-nearest neighbor algorithm|nearest-neighbor]] have all been tried, and most can achieve accuracy above 95%.

A direct comparison of several methods is reported (with references) at the ACL Wiki.&lt;ref&gt;[https://aclweb.org/aclwiki/POS_Tagging_(State_of_the_art) POS Tagging (State of the art)]&lt;/ref&gt; This comparison uses the Penn tag set on some of the Penn Treebank data, so the results are directly comparable.

However, many significant taggers are not included (perhaps because of the labor involved in reconfiguring them for this particular dataset). Thus, it should not be assumed that the results reported there are the best that can be achieved with a given approach; nor even the best that ''have'' been achieved with a given approach.

A more recent development is using the structure regularization method for part-of-speech tagging, achieving 97.36% on the standard benchmark dataset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Xu Sun |title=Structure Regularization for Structured Prediction |conference=Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) |year=2014 |pages=2402–2410 |url=http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5643-structure-regularization-for-structured-prediction.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

While there is broad agreement about basic categories, a number of edge cases make it difficult to settle on a single "correct" set of tags, even in a particular language such as (say) English. For example, it is hard to say whether "fire" is an adjective or a noun in

  the big green fire truck

A second important example is the [[use/mention distinction]], as in the following example, where "blue" could be replaced by a word from any POS (the Brown Corpus tag set appends the suffix "-NC" in such cases):

  the word "blue" has 4 letters.

Words in a language other than that of the "main" text are commonly tagged as "foreign", usually in addition to a tag for the role the foreign word is actually playing in context.

There are also many cases where POS categories and "words" do not map one to one, for example:

  as far as
  David's
  gonna
  don't
  vice versa
  first-cut
  cannot
  pre- and post-secondary
  look (a word) up

In the last example, "look" and "up" arguably function as a single verbal unit, despite the possibility of other words coming between them. Some tag sets (such as Penn) break hyphenated words, contractions, and possessives into separate tokens, thus avoiding some but far from all such problems.

Many tag sets treat words such as "be", "have", and "do" as categories in their own right (as in the Brown Corpus), while a few treat them all as simply verbs (for example, the LOB Corpus and the Penn [[Treebank]]). Because these particular words have more forms than other English verbs, and occur in quite different grammatical contexts, treating them merely as "verbs" means that a POS tagger has much less information to go on. For example, an HMM-based tagger would combine several rows and columns that would otherwise be not only distinct, but quite different. A more complex algorithm could also consider the particular word in each case; but with distinct tags, the HMM itself can often predict the correct finer-grained tag even for novel spelling variants, and thus provide better help to later processing.

The most popular "tag set" for POS tagging for American English is probably the Penn tag set, developed in the Penn Treebank project. It is largely similar to the earlier Brown Corpus and LOB Corpus tag sets, though much smaller. In Europe, tag sets from the [[Eagles Guidelines]] see wide use, and include versions for multiple languages.

POS tagging work has been done in a variety of languages, and the set of POS tags used varies greatly with language. Tags usually are designed to include overt morphological distinctions, although this leads to inconsistencies such as case-marking for pronouns but not nouns in English, and much larger cross-language differences. The tag sets for heavily inflected languages such as [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] can be very large; tagging ''words'' in [[agglutinative language]]s such as [[Inuit]] may be virtually impossible. At the other extreme, Petrov et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last1=Petrov |first1=Slav|last2=Das|first2=Dipanjan|last3=McDonald|first3=Ryan|eprint=1104.2086 |title=A Universal Part-of-Speech Tagset |class= |date=11 Apr 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; have proposed a "universal" tag set, with 12 categories (for example, no subtypes of nouns, verbs, punctuation, etc.; no distinction of "to" as an infinitive marker vs. preposition (hardly a "universal" coincidence), etc.). Whether a very small set of very broad tags or a much larger set of more precise ones is preferable, depends on the purpose at hand. Automatic tagging is easier on smaller tag-sets.

A different issue is that some cases are in fact ambiguous. [[Beatrice Santorini]] gives examples in "Part-of-speech Tagging Guidelines for the Penn Treebank Project", (3rd rev, June 1990 [ftp://ftp.cis.upenn.edu/pub/treebank/doc/tagguide.ps.gz]), including the following (p.&amp;nbsp;32) case in which ''entertaining'' can be either an adjective or a verb, and there is no syntactic way to decide:

  The Duchess was ''entertaining'' last night.

* The phonemes {{IPAslink|q}}, {{IPAslink|f}} are only found in loanwords, and tend to be replaced by {{IPAslink|k}}, {{IPAslink|p}}.
* {{IPAslink|n}} has non-phonemic allophones: {{IPAblink|ŋ}} before {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, {{IPAblink|ɳ}} before {{IPA|/ʈ/}} and {{IPA|/ɖ/}}, {{IPAblink|ɲ}} before {{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}} and {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}}, and {{IPAblink|m}} before {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/p/}}.
* {{IPA|/ɳ/}} is a voiced retroflex nasal flap, narrowly transcribed {{IPA|[ɽ̃]}}
* Voiceless stops and affricates {{IPA|/p, t, ʈ, t͡s, t͡ʃ, k/}} are all [[Aspirated consonant|unaspirated]], like [[Spanish language|Spanish]], other [[Romance languages]], and [[Austronesian languages]]; they have slightly [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]] allophones prevocalically in a stressed syllable, almost like [[English language|English]].
* {{IPA|/ʂ~ç/}} and {{IPA|/ʐ~ʝ/}} are dialectal allophones (represented by {{lang|ps|ښ}} and {{lang|ps|ږ}}), The retroflex variants {{IPA|[ʂ, ʐ]}} are used in the Southwest dialects whereas the palatal variants {{IPA|[ç, ʝ]}} are used in the Wardak and Central Ghilji dialects. Some Northern dialects merge them with the velar {{IPA|/x, ɣ/}}.
* {{IPAslink|h}} is dropped in most Southwest dialects and [[Wanetsi|Waṇētsī]].
* {{IPAslink|r}} is a voiced alveolar flap, single in most dialects.
* {{IPAslink|ɭ̆}} is a voiced retroflex lateral flap. As it does not have a dedicated [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbol, it can also be commonly represented as {{IPA|/ɺ̢, ɺ̣/}}.

==Phonotactics==

Pashto syllable structure can be summarized as follows; parentheses enclose optional components:
* (C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)) (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) V (S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;))

Pashto [[Syllable#Structure|syllable structure]] consists of an optional syllable onset, consisting of one or two consonants; an obligatory syllable nucleus, consisting of a vowel optionally preceded by and/or followed by a [[semivowel]]; and an optional syllable coda, consisting of one or two consonants.  The following restrictions apply:

* Onset
** First consonant (C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;): Can be any consonant, including a liquid ({{IPA|/l, r/}}).
** Second consonant (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;): Can be any consonant. (see [[#Consonant Clusters]] below)
* Nucleus
** Semivowel (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)
** Vowel (V)
** Semivowel (S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
* Coda
** First consonant (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;): Can be any consonant
** Second consonant (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;): Can be any consonant

==Consonant clusters==
Pashto also has a liking for word-initial [[consonant clusters]] in all dialects; some hundred such clusters occurs. However consonant gemination is unknown to Pashto.{{sfnp|Kaye|1997|p=737}}
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"

===Diphthongs in dialects===
The diphthongs varies according to dialect. The stressed diphthong {{IPA|[aɪ]}}  changes to {{IPA|[æɪ]}} in the Mohmand dialect and {{IPAblink|a}} in Wanetsi.

The diphthong {{IPA|[əɪ]}} used to indicate feminine noun gender changes to  {{IPAblink|i}} in Wanetsi and {{IPA|[ʌi]}} in Kâkaṛi.

The long diphthongs {{IPA|[ɑi]}} and {{IPA|[ɑw]}} becomes {{IPA|[ɑe]}} and {{IPA|[ɑo]}}, respectively, in most Northeastern dialects.{{sfnp|Kaye|1997|pp=751–753}}

==Stress==
Pashto has phonemic variable stress, unique amongst Iranian languages.{{sfnp|Kaye|1997|p=737}}

For instance the pronouns are differently inflected:
{| class="wikitable"

|-
| haɣá || that, he || háɣa || that one, he ('''emphatic''')
|-
| daɣá || this, he || dáɣa || this one, he ('''emphatic''')
|}

In verbs to distinguish aspect:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Verb !! Meaning !! Verb !! Meaning
|-
| kẍenɑstə́ləm || I was sitting || kẍénɑstələm || I sat down
|-
| ba kẍenə́m || I shall be sitting || ba kẍénəm || I shall sit
|}

In verbs to distinguish mood:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Verb !! Meaning !! Verb !! Meaning
|-
| pregdə́m || I leave || prégdəm || that I leave

'''''Pro Juventute''''' is a charitable foundation in [[Switzerland]] established in 1912. It is dedicated to supporting the rights and needs of Swiss children and youth.

Since 1913, the [[Swiss Post|Swiss post office]] has issued an annual [[charity stamp]] series to support the work of Pro Juventute.

Until the 1970s, the semi-official policy of institutionalizing [[Yenish people|Yenish]] parents and having their children adopted by more "normal" Swiss citizens was carried out by Pro Juventute on behalf of the Swiss government. The name of this program was ''[[Kinder der Landstrasse]]'' ("children of the road").

A '''request line''' or '''contest line''' is a [[telephone line]] which allows listeners to a [[radio station]] (or sometimes a [[TV station]]) to call the [[radio studio]] or [[TV studio]] directly.  In [[radio]], this is usually to request a song, win a contest, be a part of a [[talk show]], or to ask a question of the [[disk jockey]], such as what the name and [[musician|artist]] of a recent song was.  Used occasionally in [[television]], it is typically for telephone voting for an unscientific [[opinion poll]] in relation to news events, for a talk show, or sometimes to win a contest.  

==Telephone network==
Although only one [[telephone number]] is usually announced, major stations typically have [[line hunting]], with the same number being directed to any available one of several lines within the hunt group.  If there are no open lines, the [[calling party]] may receive a [[busy signal]] as with an ordinary [[telephone call]], or sometimes the [[special information tone]]s followed by a recorded announcement that "all [[telephone circuit|circuit]]s are busy, please try your call again later".  In this case, the line often first gives that caller a [[ringback tone]] as if the call were being completed, misleading callers to think they may have actually gotten through the swarm of other calls that sometimes flood these lines.

Within the [[North American Numbering Plan]], [[telephone companies]] typically use special numbers for these lines, with a reserved [[prefix]] corresponding to high-capacity multi-line numbers instead of to a physical [[telephone exchange]].  In [[Miami]], for example, numbers are [[area code 305|305]]-550-''xxxx'', while in [[Atlanta metropolitan area|metro Atlanta]] they are [[area code 404|404]]-741-''xxxx''.  The last four digits are usually chosen by the station to be their [[callsign]] or [[frequency]], or their [[moniker]] if it is short (such as B937 (2937) for a fictional B-93.7 [[FM broadcasting|FM]]).

When used on a [[Radio program|radio]] or [[television program]] carried on a [[broadcast network]], such a number is usually a [[toll-free telephone number]], without a special number since it simply redirects to a local request line circuit.  This allows anyone to call regardless of the location, even from a [[payphone]].  Some stations may have [[vertical service code]]s for use by [[mobile telephone]]s.  These are also common in the United States for TV stations to advertise for gathering news tips from the public, but are often specific to callers on a certain [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]ing mobile telephone company.

==Screening and editing==
Calls typically come into the studio on a multi-line telephone, which is equipped to connect callers to the [[audio console]] and onto the air via a [[telephone hybrid]].  However, in modern broadcasting, this is not always the case.

[[Call screening|Call screener]]s may take the calls initially in an adjacent room (or simply away from the [[microphone]]), in order to determine which ones would get onto the air, particularly in the case of a talk show.  Most call-in shows have special [[software]] which the screener types the caller's information into, which in turn appears on the [[personal computer|computer]] in front of the host.  This is how he or she knows how to introduce the caller by name and often by location.  This in turn alerts the caller, who has often been on [[hold (telephone)|hold]] for several minutes and may be listening to the radio or TV instead of the line, that he or she is now on the air.  Such a notification is often also a part of [[broadcast law]] if the caller may not have called with the expectation of being on the air.

A brief [[broadcast delay]] may be used to allow [[profanity]] or other inappropriate content (and possibly the caller) to be dropped, or [[voice tracking]] may be used to [[Sound recording and reproduction|record]] calls to a computer, where the call can be [[digital audio editing|digitally edited]] for time and content.  This method is most common with contest winners or callers to "all-request" shows like ''[[Delilah After Dark|Delilah]]'', and is done quickly for [[Airplay (radio)|airplay]] just a few minutes later.

'''Shlomo Dykman''' ({{lang-he|שלמה דיקמן}}; born 10 February 1917, died 1965) was a Polish-Israeli translator and classical scholar.

==Biography==
Dykman was born in 1917 in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]. He attended school at the "''Hinuch''" Hebrew Gymnasium, and then studied the classics at the Institute of Jewish Studies at [[Warsaw University]].

He began publishing translations and literary reviews in Poland in 1935, including translations from Hebrew into Polish. In 1939, he published a Polish translation of all of [[Bialik]]'s poems.

Following the outbreak of [[World War II]] and the division of Poland between [[Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]], he fled to [[Bukhara]], where he taught [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. In 1944, he was arrested by the Soviet authorities and accused of [[Zionism|Zionist]] and [[Counter-revolutionary]] activities. He was initially sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted to five to ten years hard labour, which he served in the coals mines in the [[Arctic]] region of the northern [[Ural mountains|Urals]]. In 1957, he returned to Warsaw and, in 1960, he [[Aliyah|emigrated]] to [[Israel]] and settled in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.osu.edu/projects/hebrew-lexicon/01456 Lexicon of Modern Hebrew Literature - Shlomo Dickman] (in Hebrew). Retrieved 6 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Dykman published many Hebrew translations of [[Greek literature]] and of the [[Latin literature|Roman and Latin classics]]. Among his translations were the tragedies of ''"[[Aeschylus]]"'' and ''"[[Sophocles]]"'', the poem ''"[[Aeneid]]"'' by [[Virgil]] and ''"[[Metamorphoses]]"'' by [[Ovid]].

==Awards and honours==
* In 1961, Dykman was awarded the [[Tchernichovsky Prize]] for exemplary translation.
* In 1965, he was awarded the [[Israel Prize]], in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashkag/Tashlab_Tashkag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashka|title=Israel Prize recipients in 1965 (in Hebrew)|publisher=Israel Prize Official Site|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wE6Ihijv?url=http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashkag/Tashlab_Tashkag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashka|archivedate=3 February 2011|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Situational code-switching''' is the tendency in a [[speech community]] to use different [[language]]s or [[language variety|language varieties]] in different social situations, or to [[Code-switching|switch varieties]] in order to mark a change in situation. 

Situational and [[metaphorical code-switching]] were first described by  [[John J. Gumperz]] and [[Jan-Petter Blom]]. Their paper, "Social meaning in linguistic structures", was the first to suggest this division.&lt;ref name="BlomGumperz"&gt;{{Citation |last1=Blom |first1=Jan-Petter |first2=John J. |last2=Gumperz |chapter=Social Meaning in Linguistic Structures: Code Switching in Northern Norway |editor=J. J. Gumperz and D. Hymes |title=Directions in Sociolinguistics |year=1972 |location=New York |publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=zfYYXKxPek0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=%22Social+Meaning+in+Linguistic+Structures:+Code+Switching+in+Northern+Norway&amp;ots=f5pN2iqWvu&amp;sig=NKOuTnOTIM9qQgumAiWPpoKytNw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Social%20Meaning%20in%20Linguistic%20Structures%3A%20Code%20Switching%20in%20Northern%20Norway&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gumperz and [[Dell Hymes]] describe the difference between the two in the introduction to the volume in which "Social meaning in linguistic structures" appeared. 
:An important distinction is made from situational switching, where alternation between varieties redefines a situation, being a change in governing norms, and metaphorical switching, where alternation enriches a situation, allowing for allusion to more than one social relationship within the situation.&lt;ref name="GumperzHymes"&gt;{{Citation |last1=Gumperz |first1=John Joseph |first2=Dell H. |last2=Hymes |title=Directions in Sociolinguistics: The Ethnography of Communication |location=Oxford |publisher=Basil Blackwell |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Beyond Culture]]'', anthropologist [[Edward T. Hall]] argues that face-to-face interaction within a given culture is governed by thousands of culturally and institutionally coded situational frames, each associated with a linguistically restricted way of speaking known as the Situational Dialect (SD). An SD facilitates concise communication through the reliance on [[High- and low-context cultures|high-context messages]]. Hall refutes the notion of a universally applicable basic form of a language, stating that "the classroom is the only place where the classroom form of the language will be found".&lt;ref name=Hall1976 /&gt; 

Hall describes situational frames as:
:made up of situational dialects, material appurtenances, situational personalities, and behavior patterns that occur in recognized settings and are appropriate to specific situations. Some common settings and situations are: greeting, working, eating, bargaining, fighting, governing, making love, going to school, cooking and serving meals, hanging out, and the like. The situational frame is the smallest viable unit of a culture that can be analyzed, taught, transmitted, and handed down as a complete entity. Frames contain linguistic, kinesic, proxemic, temporal, social, material, personality and other components.&lt;ref name=Hall1976&gt;{{cite book |last=Hall |first=Edward T. |date=1976 |title=Beyond Culture |url=https://monoskop.org/images/6/60/Hall_Edward_T_Beyond_Culture.pdf |dead-url=no |location=New York |publisher=Anchor Books/Doubleday |edition=1981 revised |isbn=0-385-12474-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hall gives an example of an SD:
:The language used between pilots and the control-tower personnel is an excellent example of a very [[High- and low-context cultures|high-context]] SD, developed in response to the need for a language of great parsimony and low ambiguity. (...) Situational dialects of these types frequently make use of restricted codes–and remember, restricted codes are for the insider. Everything is condensed: grammar, vocabulary, intonation. All the rules that are so carefully learned in the classroom go right out the window.&lt;ref name=Hall1976 /&gt; 

In the decades since Blom &amp; Gumperz's and Hall's work first appeared, significant advances have been made in the analysis of code-switching.

==Example==
An example of situational code-switching can be seen in this telephone conversation between two friends. The speaker is talking about recent political events, and the language she uses is [[Standard Italian]]. When she decides to change topics, though, she marks this change by switching to [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]. (Standard Italian is shown in ordinary type. Sicilian is in italics.)

:Io mai l'ho vista una campagna elettorale così. Neppure nel quarantotto, che era il dopoguerra, che c'erano... che c'erano proprio umori tremendi. Mai si era verificato. ''N'autra cosa t'ai'a cchièdirti, Giovanna''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alfonzetti|first=Giovanna|editor=P. Auer|title=Code-Switching in Conversation: Language, Interaction and Identity|year=2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-01788-3|page=198|chapter=Italian-dialect code-switching in Sicily}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::(I've never seen an electoral campaign like this. Not even in 1948, in the post-war period, when there were... when there were tremendous emotions. It never happened. ''I've got something else to ask you, Giovanna''.)

A change in topic is an example of a changed situation that may be marked by code-switching. The speaker in this example switches from Standard Italian to the local language, marking the new situation with a different language.

'''Ticuna–Yuri''' is a small family, perhaps even a [[dialect continuum]], consisting of at least two, and perhaps three, known languages of South America: the major western Amazonian language [[Ticuna language|Ticuna]], the poorly attested and extinct [[Yuri language (Amazon)|Yurí]], and the scarcely known language of the largely uncontacted [[Carabayo language|Carabayo]]. Kaufman (1990, 1994) argues that the connection between the two is convincing even with the limited information available. Carvalho (2009) presented "compelling" evidence for the family (Campbell &amp; Grondona 2012).

'''Tokelauan''' {{IPAc-en|t|oʊ|k|ə|ˈ|l|aʊ|ən}}&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Bauer, 2007, ''The Linguistics Student's Handbook'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Polynesian language]] spoken in [[Tokelau]] and on [[Swains Island]] (or Olohega) in American Samoa. It is closely related to [[Tuvaluan language|Tuvaluan]] and distantly related to [[Samoan language|Samoan]] and other Polynesian languages. Tokelauan has a co-official status with English in Tokelau. There are approximately 4,260 speakers of Tokelauan, of whom 2,100 live in [[New Zealand]], 1,400 in Tokelau, and 17 in Swains Island. "Tokelau" means "north-northeast".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/To-Z/Tokelau.html|title=Culture of Tokelau - history, people, clothing, traditions, women, beliefs, food, family, social|website=www.everyculture.com|language=eng|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Loimata Iupati]], Tokelau's resident Director of Education, has stated that he is in the process of translating the [[Bible]] from English into Tokelauan.
Tokelauan was a commonly spoken language until about twenty years ago. Of the 4600 people who speak the language, 1600 of them live in the three atolls of Tokelau – Atafu, Nukunono and Fakaofo. Approximately 3000 people in New Zealand speak Tokelauan, and the rest of the known Tokelauan speakers are spread across Australia, Hawaii, and the West Coast of the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Tokelauan language closely resembles the Samoan language.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-MacToke-t1-body-d1-d1-d5.html|title=Ethnology of Tokelau Islands|website=Victoria University of Wellington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tokelauan language documentation ==
Horatio Hale was the first person to publish a Tokelauan dictionary of sorts, which he did in 1846.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simona|first1=Ropati|title=Tokelau Dictionary|date=1986|publisher=Office of Tokelau Affairs|location=New Zealand|page=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than being the accepted definition of dictionary, it was a reference that only contained 214 entries of vocabulary.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Hale's publication remained the only published Tokelauan reference until 1969.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, Tokelauan had been instituted into schools in the late 1940s, so prior to this publication, there wasn't much headway made in the teaching of the language.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In 1969, the New Zealand Department of Education published D. W. Boardman's Tokelau-English Vocabulary.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This second, more advanced reference was a collection of around 1200 vocabulary entries.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In the times that passed after the second publication, the necessity of a more detailed and in depth reference to the language for the purpose of education with the Tokelauan community was realized by Hosea Kirifi&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; (who later became the first Tokelau Director of Education) and J. H. Webster. In the year 1975, Kirifi and Webster published the first official precursory Tokelauan dictionary, which contained an estimated 3000 items, called the Tokelau-English Dictionary.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This entire movement was based on the fact that the Tokelauan people take a great deal of pride in their language. Tokelauan schools lacked an abundance of resources and materials that could be used to education their children on the language.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It has a high place in their culture,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and the revitalization and renewal of the language for their younger generation had eventually reached a point where action had to be taken. One year after the publication of the 1975 Tokelau-English Dictionary, the government approved the installation of Ropati Simona who was to head the Tokelau Dictionary Project. This eventually led to the publication of the first comprehensive Tokelauan dictionary, Tokelau Dictionary by the Office of Tokelau Affairs in 1986.

== Tokelauan background ==
Tokelau is a dependency of New Zealand and has three main parts: [[Atafu|Atafu atoll]], [[Nukunonu|Nukunonu atoll]], and [[Fakaofo|Fakaofo atoll]]. Together these three atolls lay roughly about two hundred sixty nautical miles away from Samoa. The three atolls of Tokelau are also known as the [[Atafu|Duke of York]], [[Nukunonu|Duke of Clarence]], and [[Fakaofo|D'Wolf or Bowditch]], respectively (on old maps). Together, they are known as The Union Islands, The Union Group, and as the Tokelau Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tokelau A History of Government |last=Angelo |first=Tony|publisher=MTC Print|year=2008|isbn=|location=Wellington, New Zealand|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tokelau's language, Tokelauan, belongs to the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language family and is considered to be part of the subgroup of Polynesian languages. More than half of the speakers of the Tokelauan language reside in New Zealand, about thirty percent live in either Atafu, Nukuonono, or Fakaofo, and a minority live in Australia (geographically close to New Zealand) and states in the United States that touch the Pacific Ocean (Hawaii and other western states part of the mainland). Since Tokelau lies very close to Samoa, it is common to think that the Tokelauan language has some Samoan language influences, but due to the lack in extensive documentation, it is inaccurate to assume such a thing. Tokelauan was still only considered to be a spoken language up until the 1960s. During the 1960s schools began teaching their peoples how to read and write their own language. Short works were also produced in Tokelauan. Additionally, it was common for adults to be fluent in Samoan and Tokelauan.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Studies in Tokelauan syntax|last=Hooper |first=Robin|publisher=University Microfilms International|year=1994|isbn=|location=Ann Arbor, Michigan|pages=98–99|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tokelauan language is small, and has always been fairly small, even before the Europeans invaded, because of the limited resources that each atoll had, which limited the number of people that could be supported on each.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wayfinding in Pacific Linguascapes: Negotiating Tokelau Linguistic Identities in Hawai'i|last=Glenn|first=Akiemi|publisher=University of Hawaii at Manoa|year=2012|isbn=|location=Honolulu, HI|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthography and alphabet==
Tokelauan is written in the [[Latin script]], albeit only using 15 letters: 
'''A''', '''E''', '''I''', '''O''', '''U''', '''F''', '''G''', '''K''', '''L''', '''M''', '''N''', '''P''', '''H''', '''T''', and '''V'''.

Its alphabet consists of 5 vowels:
a (pronounced: /a/), e (pronounced: /e/), i (pronounced: /i/), o (pronounced: /o/) and u (pronounced: /u/);

and 10 consonants:
/p t k f v h m n ŋ l/, /ŋ/ spelled g

Long vowels are marked with a macron above them:
ā, ē, ī, ō, ū

The Tokelauan alphabet is [[Phoneme|phonemic]], except for long vowels that are not differentiated orthographically by most Tokelauan writers. The language does not heavily rely on the use of [[Macron (diacritic)|macrons]] to lengthen their vowels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are some phonetic similarities between sounds in the language, such as /h/ and /f/, which results in some variation in orthographic practice. For example, toha and tofa both mean goodbye but can be pronounced differently.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The sounds for h, s f and wh can all be used interchangeably.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There are two dialects in Polynesia, which has shaped the Tokelauan language to sound how it does. The h and wh sounds are from the older dialect, while the f and s sounds are from the newer one. The fact that all these sounds are interchangeable regardless of when it arrived at the islands suggests that no one dialect surpassed the other.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although Tokelauan is closely related to the Samoan language, there is a distinct difference between their pronunciation of words. For example, Samoan words containing the k sound can sound like g with words such as hiki often mistakenly heard as higi. Tokelauan language does not allow the k's to drop.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Like English, vowels can be short or long. Moreover, vowels are lengthened for a more expressive statement. To indicate whether a vowel is read short or long, Tokelauan language denotes a long vowel with a macron over the letter symbol. A [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] is a horizontal line, also seen in English. However, it is worthwhile to note that not all Tokelauan speaking peoples agree with the use of the macron. Those residing in the three atolls of Tokelau are known to have shown much resistance to the macron, while the Tokelauan speakers of New Zealand are more open and accepting of adopting the use of this linguistic symbol.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although there is not a lot of available systemic data for Tokelauan word stressing, linguistics have developed three rules relating word stress and vowels based upon some previous evidence. The first rule is that a long vowel will receive the main stress. Secondly, with some exceptions to rule number one, the second to last vowel would be the main stress (if the long vowel is not the main stress). And thirdly, words do not lose their normal stress when compounded with another word. Furthermore, monosyllabic grammatical morphemes are left unstressed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Types of sentences ==
Similarly to English, for each clause in Tokelauan there is a predicate. There are five types of predicates including: verbal, locative, existential, possessive, and nominal. Each predicate is available for an interrogative and declarative statement, and can also have multiple predicates conjoined.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Verbal Predicates'''

-A verbal phrase will follow a verbal clause

&lt;u&gt;Example:&lt;/u&gt; ''Kua fano''    '[S/he] has gone.'&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

(A type of verbal predicate is an evaluative predicate which can and usually occurs with no argument).

'''Locative Predicates'''

-preposition i and a noun phrase following a tense-aspect particle

&lt;u&gt;Example:&lt;/u&gt; ''E i te faleha te faifeau''    'The pastor is in the church.'&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Articles == 
There are two articles that are used in the English language. These articles are ''the'' and ''a/an''. The usage for the word ''the'' when speaking of a noun is strictly reserved for the case in which the receiver of the word should be aware of its context, or if said item has been referred to previously. This is because in English, the word ''the'' acts as what is known as a definite article, meaning that a defined object or person is being spoken of. However, in the case of definite article usage in Tokelauan language, if the speaker is speaking of an item in the same manner as the English languages uses ''the'', they need not to have referred to it previously so long as the item is specific.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The same can be said for the reference of singular being.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Because of the difference is grammatical ruling, although the definite article in the Tokelauan language is ''te'', it is very common for it to translate to the English indefinite article ''a''. An indefinite article is used when there is no specification of the noun being referred to.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The usage of the word ''he'', the indefinite article in Tokelauan is 'any such item'.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In negative statements the word ''he'' is used because that is where it is most often found, as well as when phrasing a question.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, it is important to remember that just because these two types of statements are where ''he'' occurs the greatest it does not mean that ''he'' does not occur in other types of statements as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Examples of both ''te'' and ''he'' are as such:

Tokelauan: ''Kua hau te tino''

'''English: 'A man has arrived' or 'The man has arrived''''&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

(Notice how te in Tokelauan has been translated to both a and the in English.)

Tokelauan: ''Vili ake oi k'aumai he toki''

'''English: 'Do run and bring me an axe''''&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The use of ''he'' and ''te'' in Tokelauan are reserved for when describing a singular noun.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; When describing a plural noun, different articles are used. For plural definite nouns, ''nā'' is the article that is used.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, in some cases, rather than using ''nā'', plural definite nouns are subject to the absence of an article represented by ''0''.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The absence of an article is usually used if a large amount or a specific class of things are being described.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; An example of an exception to this commonality would be if one was describing an entire class of things, but in a nonspecific way.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In this case, rather than ''nā'' as the article, the singular definite noun te would be used.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The article ''ni'' is used for describing a plural indefinite noun.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Examples of ''nā'', a ''0'' exception, and ''ni'' are as such:

Tokelauan: ''Vili ake oi k'aumai nā nofoa''

'''English: 'Do run and bring me the chairs''''&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Tokelauan: ''Ko te povi e kai mutia''

'''English: 'Cows eat grass''''

('Ko' in this sentence acts as a preposition to 'te'.)&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Tokelauan: ''E i ei ni tuhi?''

'''English: Are there any books?'''&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

(Notice that this is the use of an indefinite article in an interrogative statement. As mentioned above, the use of indefinite articles in these types of statements is very common.)

== Particles ==
The particles of the Tokelauan language are ''ia'', ''a'' (or ā), ''a te'', and ''ia te''.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; When describing personal names as well as the names of the month, pronouns (the use here is optional and it is most commonly used when there are words in between the pronoun and verb), and collaborative nouns that describe a group of people working together the most common particle is used.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This particle is ''ia'', which is used so long as none of the nouns listed above follow the prepositions ''e'', ''o'', ''a'', or ''ko''.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; When the subject of a sentence is a locative or name of a place, ''ia'' is also used as the particle in those particular, as well as other specific instances. The particle ''a'' is used before a person's name as well as the names of months and the particle ''a te'' is used before pronouns when these instances are following the prepositions ''i'' or ''ki''.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; If describing a pronoun and using the preposition ''mai'', the article that follows is ''ia te''.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==Morphology==
There are four main classes of [[lexeme]]s in the Tokelauan language, and are as follows:

1.) [[Noun]] - A lexeme formed directly after a determiner or possessive pronoun to create a noun phrase
* These can only function as nouns. Pronouns are a subset of nouns, so they cannot be combined with determiners.
** He loi - an ant
** Tona vaka - his canoe
2.) [[Verb]] - A lexeme that comes directly after a verbal particle and expresses tense or aspect.
* ka - future
* ka fano - will go
* koi - present continuous
* Koi ola - still alive
* A few lexemes are used only as a verb and don't attach to form a different phrase - ex. Galo = be lost, disappear
3.) [[Locative case|Locative]] - A lexeme that forms directly after the preposition (i, ki, or mai), without an additional determiner
* luga - above
* lalo - beneath
* loto - inside
* Place names and months have some characteristics of locatives
4.) Small class of “other” lexemes that don't fit into the other three classes
* ananafi - yesterday
* āpō - yesterday
* ātaeao - tomorrow morning
Majority of the lexemes can be used in both position 1 &amp; 2, meaning they can function as nouns and verbs, depending on the context.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/tkl|title=Tokelauen|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complements==
The Tokulauan language makes use of complementizers pe, ke, oi, and ona. The complementizer pe is used for indicative complements, while ke, oi, and ona are used for non-indicative complements.

Pe: Complement used in sentences pertaining to knowledge.

Example: '''Ko taku fakatatau lava pe na maua lava te vaiaho.'''

TOP 1sg.POSSguess INT COMPT/A obtain INT DET week

''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'My guess was that a full week had passed.'''&lt;ref name="syntax"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hooper|first1=Robin|title=Studies in Tokelauan Syntax|date=1993|publisher=University of Auckland|pages=328–332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ke: Complement used in sentences pertaining to purpose.

Example: '''Kua fiu foki ke-iru-au a!'''

T/A fed-up indeed COMP drink 1sg EXCLM

''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'[They] were tired of trying to get me to drink.'''&lt;ref name="syntax"/&gt;

Ona: Complement used in sentences pertaining to “phasal, modal, and commentative predicates.”

Example: '''Kua tatau ono fai he fale.'''

T/A necessary COMP make a house

''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'It had become necessary to acquire a house'''&lt;ref name="syntax"/&gt;

Oi: Complement used in sentences pertaining to items of sequence.

Example: '''Kuo toeitiiti ol nofo mti te fet0 tEia.'''

T/A be-soon COMP sit DIR DET star DEM

''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Very soon that star will be in the ascendant.'''&lt;ref name="syntax"/&gt;

The Tokelauan language also must take into mind the systematics of its complements. There is a bonding hierarchy between the complements and its sentences. According to Hooper's research, there are four elements that in Tokelauan semantics that determine the strength of the bond between the complement and rest of the sentence. In the binding system, the complements act inversely to the verb of the sentence. Therefore, if the strength of the verb is higher on the binding scale, the complement is unlikely to appear as its own separate clause. The four elements are: Subject/agent case marking, Verb modalities, Fusion or co-lexicalization, and Separation.&lt;ref name="syntax"/&gt;

Subject/agent case marking: “'The higher the main verb is on the binding scale, the less likely is the subject/agent of the complement to display the case-marking characteristics of subjects/agents of main clauses.'”&lt;ref name="syntax"/&gt; (Quoted from Givón)

Verb modalities: “'The higher the main verb is on the binding scale, the less likely is the complement verb to display the tense-aspect-modality markings characteristics of main-clause verbs.'”&lt;ref name="syntax"/&gt; (Quoted from Givón)

Fusion or co-lexicalization: “'The higher the main verb is on the binding scale, the more likely is the complement verb to co-lexicalize with the main verb.'”&lt;ref name="syntax"/&gt; (Quoted from Givón)

Separation: “'The higher the main verb is on the binding scale, the less likely it is that a subordinating morpheme would separate the complement clause from the main clause.'”&lt;ref name="syntax"/&gt; (Quoted from Givón)

==Shifting==
Tokelauan is a quite free flowing language as the sentence structures can vary greatly. Although there is a preferred method of ordering the phrase (i.e, argument, subject, case complement), the language allows for different variations. There are certain rules when it comes to sentence permutations when it comes to “subject shifting” or “case scrambling.” Generally, across these sentence permutations, the parts of speech, such as argument, subject, and case complements, have to stay together. Meaning, the argument is one section that would shift together and subject is its own unit.&lt;ref name="sharples"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharples|first1=Peter|title=Tokelauan Syntax: Studies in the Sentence Structure of a Polynesian Language|date=1976|pages=246–248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subject shift:

'''&lt;u&gt;na havali&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;mai te fale i te auala&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;te teine&lt;/u&gt;'''

argument  case complement    subject

Walked from the house along the road the girl&lt;ref name="sharples"/&gt;

'''&lt;u&gt;na havali&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;te teine&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;mai te fale i te auala&lt;/u&gt;'''

argument subject case complement

Walked the girl from the house along the road&lt;ref name="sharples"/&gt;

Case scramble:

'''&lt;u&gt;na kai&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;te ika&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;e au&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;i te hiipuni&lt;/u&gt;'''

'''&lt;u&gt;na kai&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;e au&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;te ika&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;i te hiipuni&lt;/u&gt;'''

'''&lt;u&gt;na kai&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;e au&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;i te hiipuni&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;te ika&lt;/u&gt;'''

All of which still mean, The fish was eaten by me with a spoon.&lt;ref name="sharples"/&gt;

==Affinities with other languages==
Tokelauan is mutually intelligible with the Tuvaluan language. Samoan literature is recognised mostly due to the early introduction of Christian Samoan missionaries to which the Samoan language was held as the language of instruction at school and at church {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}. It also has marked similarities to the [[Niuafo'ou language]] of [[Tonga]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}.

distinctions in sibling terms. The language has specific words for different members of the family, and some of these terms have multiple meanings.

=== Terms ===
There are three terms that showcase the distinction of same-sex and opposite-sex sibling terms: Sibling of own sex (male or female); sibling of opposite sex (male); and sibling of opposite sex, (female). For example, 'mother's sister,' 'male cousin's brother' and 'sister's nephew' are all different terms in the Tokelauan language. In Tokelau, the term most closely translated to “incest” is ''holi kāiga'' which is made up of two words: holi meaning 'to tread' and also 'to desecrate' or 'violate'. The word ''Kāiga'' means 'kinship'. The term holi kāiga can be applied to not only a 'desecration of kinship' but in any cases that the order of kinship is changed, for example a child defying an elder. The most common use of the term, however, is used when speaking about the sexual contact between individuals. In the Tokelauan language, ''Kāiga'' has both adjectival and nominal linguistic functions:
* '''''e kāiga ki mā''''' 'we two are related'
* '''''ko īa he kāiga e o oku''''' 'he/she is a kinsman of mine'
* '''''i nā aho iēnā nae hē lahi nā kāiga''''' 'in those days there were not many kingroups'
When the word is used nominally, it may imply a diverse variety of social units that all have a shared ancestor. The Tokelau languages contains terms for affinal relationships, however, there is no single word that can be transcribed as 'affinity'. The term opposite of kāiga ('kin' or 'related') is he kāiga ('not kin' or 'unrelated'), and that only those who are he kāiga should be wedded. Violating the kinship relationship means breaching not only the current relationship but the whole kinship of all descendants.

== Language endangerment ==
With less than 5000 speakers, the Tokelauan language is endangered. There is a struggle to teach a language that is spoken by only handful of people, when learning a widely known language such as [[English language|English]], has a much greater benefit in their society. The [[Heritage language]] of the community starts to diminish as parents stray away from teaching their child(ren) the native language, in hopes that they will succeed in learning the more dominant language. Older generations of people living in Tokelau speak both Tokelauan and Samoan, but the younger generation, due to the newer schooling system, are apt to speaking English rather than Samoan. In a census in 2001 in New Zealand, only 44 percent of the people with a Tokelauan background could hold a conversation in the language, compared to 53 percent in 1996. Comparably, a meager 29 percent of New Zealand-born Tokelauans reported being able to speak the language, compared to the 71 percent born in the three atolls.

'''Vayu''' (वायु), '''Wayu''' or '''Hayu''' (हायु) is a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] language spoken in [[Nepal]] by about 1740 people in the [[Janakpur Zone]]. Dialects include Sindhuli and Marin Khola.

The Vayu language features [[Subject-object-verb|SOV ordering]]. There are strong [[Nepali language|Nepali]] influences in its phonology, lexicon, and grammar. Its writing system uses the [[Devanagari]] script. There are no known [[Monolingualism|monolingual]] speakers of the language, as its speaking population also uses [[Nepali language|Nepali]].&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt; Despite a lack of monolingual children, use of Vayu has survived into the 21st century &lt;ref&gt;Frawley, W. (2003). Wayu. ''The International Encyclopedia of Linguistics.'' (Vol. 4, pp.&amp;nbsp;536)  New York, NY: Oxford University Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4223">'''Visual inspection''' is a common method of [[quality control]], [[data acquisition]], and [[data analysis]].
Visual Inspection, used in maintenance of facilities, mean inspection of equipment and structures using either or all of raw human senses such as vision, hearing, touch and smell and/or any non-specialized inspection equipment.
Inspections requiring Ultrasonic, X-Ray equipment, Infra-red, etc. are not typically regarded as Visual Inspection as these Inspection methodologies require specialized equipment, training and certification.

==Quality control==
A study of the visual inspection of small [[integrated circuit]]s found that the modal duration of eye fixations of trained inspectors was about 200&amp;nbsp;ms. The most accurate inspectors made the fewest eye fixations and were the fastest. When the same chip was judged more than once by an individual inspector the consistency of judgment was very high whereas the consistency between inspectors was somewhat less. Variation by a factor of six in inspection speed led to variation of less than a factor of two in inspection accuracy. Visual inspection had a [[false positive]] rate of 2% and a [[false negative]] rate of 23%.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Studies of Visual Inspection|author1=J. W. Schoonahd |author2=J. D. Gould |author3=L. A. Miller |journal=Ergonomics|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a775971992~db=all|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|volume=16, issue 4|date= July 1973|pages= 365–379|doi=10.1080/00140137308924528|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humorous terminology==
To do an '''eyeball search''' is to look for something specific in a mass of [[source code|code]] or data with [[human eye|one's own eyes]], as opposed to using some sort of [[pattern matching]] software like [[grep]] or any other automated search tool. Also known as '''vgrep''' or '''ogrep''', i.e., "visual/optical grep",&lt;ref&gt;''[[Jargon File]]'', version 4.4.6, 25 Oct 2003''
&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[IBM]] mainframe world as '''IEBIBALL'''.&lt;ref&gt;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bit.listserv.ibm-main/fwtsFN4XyhQ{{better source needed|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important application of eyeball search / vgrep in [[software engineering]] is [[vdiff]].

In various disciplines it is also called the "eyeball technique" or "eyeball method" (of data assessment).

"Eyeballing" is the most common and readily available method of initial data assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Srinika Jayaratne, Rona L. Levy (1979) "Empirical Clinical Practice", {{ISBN|0-231-04188-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tkQFKoyPsegC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=eyeballing&amp;lr=&amp;sig=3PKaXXPOyfsFFmVudYHYnqVUIbg#PPA110,M1 p. 110]&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts in [[pattern recognition]] maintain that the "eyeball" technique is still the most effective procedure for searching arbitrary, possibly unknown structures in data.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Jürgen Zimmermann (2001) "Fuzzy Set Theory--and Its Applications", {{ISBN|0-7923-7435-5}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hz_mvNU8YHYC&amp;pg=PA278&amp;dq=%22eyeball+search%22&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ztqc-srOr7fzycmSRlUfJMEQsP4 p. 278]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the military, applying this sort of search to real-world terrain is often referred to as "using the '''Mark I Eyeball'''"  device (pronounced as Mark One Eyeball), the U.S. military adopting it in 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;"Contemporary Geodesy" (Proceedings of a Conference Held at the Harvard College Observatory - Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Cambridge, MA, December 1–2, 1958). [https://books.google.com/books?id=vtg_AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22mark+I+eyeball%22&amp;dq=%22mark+I+eyeball%22&amp;lr=&amp;pgis=1 P. 68] says: "Now the first type of optical tracking, the most elementary, is that using merely the naked eye — as I heard a Navy man say the other day, 'Mark I eyeball' ".&lt;/ref&gt; The term is an allusion on military nomenclature, "Mark I" being the first version of a military vehicle or weapon.
