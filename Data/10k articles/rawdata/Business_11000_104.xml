[[File:121 Atlantic Place.jpg|200px|thumb|121 Atlantic Place, the former Atlantic National Bank Building]]
'''121 Atlantic Place''', formerly the '''Atlantic National Bank Building''', is a historic [[skyscraper]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. It was built in 1909 as the headquarters for the [[Atlantic National Bank]], and is located at 121 West Forsyth Street. It was the [[tallest building in Jacksonville]] and [[tallest building in Florida|in Florida]] from 1909 to 1912, and remains an office building today.

==History==
The building was designed by [[New York City]] architects [[Mowbray and Uffinger]] and built between 1908 and 1909 by the James Stewart Company for the [[Atlantic National Bank]]. The [[steel frame]] structure stands at 10 stories and {{convert|135|ft|m}} high, and includes a white [[Sylacauga marble]] covering on the bottom two floors and white [[terra cotta]] on the upper eight. The facade includes ornate detailing, two-story columns around the entrance, and other decorative elements.&lt;ref name=ANBB&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wood|first=Wayne |year= 1992 |title= D-58: Atlantic National Bank Building |journal= Jacksonville's Architectural Heritage |volume= |issue= |pages= 61 |publisher= [[University Press of Florida]] |isbn= 0-8130-0953-7 |url= http://www.jaxhistory.com/Jax%20Arch%20Herit/D-58.htm |accessdate= November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was constructed amid a three-way race with the [[Bisbee Building]] and the Seminole Hotel to become Jacksonville's first [[skyscraper]]. All three buildings were located on Forsyth Street within a block of each other, and all three were ten stories tall. The Atlantic National Bank Building broke ground in August 1908, shortly after the Bisbee Building but before the Seminole Hotel. The Bisbee opened just before the Atlantic National Bank Building the following year, winning the race.&lt;ref name=ANBB/&gt; However, at 41 meters the Atlantic Bank Building was taller than the others, making it the [[tallest building in Jacksonville]] and the [[tallest building in Florida|tallest in Florida]] at the time. It held that position until the [[Florida Life Building]] was completed in 1912.&lt;ref name=Metrojacksonville&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.metrojacksonville.com/article/2008-mar-a-century-of-floridas-tallest-skyscrapers |title= A Century of Florida's Tallest Skyscrapers |author= Ennis Davis|date= March 6, 2008 |work= metrojacksonville.com |publisher= |accessdate=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Atlantic National Bank, founded by Edward W. Lane, Thomas P. Denham, and Fred W. Hoyt in 1903, relocated its bank room from the nearby [[Dyal-Upchurch Building]] to the new headquarters. In 1926 the bank opened the [[Atlantic National Bank Annex]] directly behind the Bank Building on West Adams Street.&lt;ref name=ANBA&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wood|first=Wayne |year= 1992 |title= D-9: Atlantic National Bank Annex|journal= Jacksonville's Architectural Heritage |volume= |issue= |pages= 61 |publisher= [[University Press of Florida]] |isbn= 0-8130-0953-7 |url= http://www.jaxhistory.com/Jax%20Arch%20Herit/D-9.htm |accessdate= November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This building, now known as the Schultz Building, was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/FL/Duval/state.html |title= Florida-Duval County |author= |date= 2011 |work= nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com |publisher= |accessdate=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 Atlantic National Bank merged with [[First Union]], which was in turn acquired by [[Wachovia]] (and subsequently [[Wells Fargo]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Retired lawyer, bank executive was also a longtime community leader |author= Kerr, Jessie-Lynn|url= http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/072804/met_16211738.shtml|newspaper= [[The Florida Times-Union]]|date= July 28, 2004|accessdate=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Atlantic National Bank Building changed hands over the years, becoming known as 121 Atlantic Place, but is still in use as an office building. It was renovated in the 2000s, with a five-story addition added to the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.emporis.com/building/121atlanticplace-jacksonville-fl-usa |title= 121 Atlantic Place |author= |date= 2011 |work= emporis.com|publisher= |accessdate=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One unique feature of the structure is its [[Subway (underpass)|pedestrian tunnel]] connecting to the [[BB&amp;T Bank Building]], the only such tunnel in Downtown Jacksonville still in use.&lt;ref name=Metrojacksonville/&gt; This tunnel, originally created to facilitate secure travel between buildings, has been home to a small restaurant, Benny's, since 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Downtown's long hidden treasure |author= Thomas, Janelle |url= http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/061805/neR_19020475.shtml |newspaper= [[The Florida Times-Union]]|date= June 18, 2005 |accessdate=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ana María Flores Sanzetenea''' (born 29 July 1952) is a [[Bolivia]]n engineer, businesswoman, ex-senator, and politician. She is also known for her candidacy for the [[President of Bolivia|presidency of Bolivia]] in the [[Bolivian general election, 2009|2009 general election]], in which she finished fifth.

==Biography==
Ana María Flores was born on 29 July 1952 in the city of [[Sucre]], Bolivia. Her primary and secondary schooling took place in her hometown. She continued her higher education, traveling to the United States to study [[civil engineering]] at Trinity College. She also married a U.S. citizen. A few years after their marriage, Flores was widowed with two daughters.&lt;ref name=mirada&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.eldia.com.bo/index.php?cat=150&amp;pla=3&amp;id_articulo=21228 |title=Una mirada a la vida de los 8 presidenciables |trans-title=A Look at the Life of the Presidential 8 |work=[[El Día (Bolivia)|El Día]] |location=Bolivia |language=Spanish |date=6 December 2009 |access-date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her working life, Flores devoted herself entirely to the business of the mining equipment and construction company Whenhell, of which she was general manager and owner from age 27, from 1979 to 1984.&lt;ref name=mirada/&gt; She was also a representative of the companies Renardet Ingenieurs from 1984 to 1992, Santi Consulting from 1990 to 1997, and Iberinsa from 1992 to 1998. Flores was also owner of the investment group Cristal from 1995 until its end in 2002.&lt;ref name=NB&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.inesad.edu.bo/pdf/edicionimpresaNuevaBolivia.pdf |title=Ana María Flores |work=Nueva Bolivia |page=16 |language=Spanish |access-date=6 November 2017 |via=INESAD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political life==
At age 50, Flores was invited by [[Manfred Reyes Villa]]'s [[New Republican Force]] to participate in the elections, where she won the position of senator for [[La Paz Department (Bolivia)|La Paz Department]] in the [[Plurinational Legislative Assembly]].&lt;ref name=colombianos&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.la-razon.com/index.php?_url=/ciudades/seguridad_ciudadana/Exsenadora-Ana-Maria-Flores-secuestrada_0_1711628905.html |title=Dos colombianos y un boliviano están implicados en el secuestro de la exsenadora Ana María Flores |trans-title=Two Colombians and One Bolivian Are Implicated in the Kidnapping of the Ex-Senator Ana María Flores |last=Pérez |first=Mariana |work=[[La Razón (La Paz)|La Razón]] |location=La Paz |language=Spanish |date=24 October 2012 |access-date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However she left the party after the [[Bolivian gas conflict|gas conflict]] in 2003, during the second government of president [[Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada]] (2002–2003).&lt;ref name=NB/&gt;

During this time, Flores joined the "Transversal Group", a number of senators who had resigned from their respective political parties after the gas conflict. Flores contributed by denouncing several instances of nepotism in the Bolivian congress. She held her senatorial position until 2005.&lt;ref name=NB/&gt;

Four years after leaving office, at age 57, Flores ran for president in the 2009 general election with the [[United Social Patriotic Movement]].&lt;ref name=colombianos/&gt; She finished fifth with 23,257 votes (0.51% of the general vote).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.lostiempos.com/ustedelige/coyuntura/coyuntura/20091201/ana-flores-quiere-hacer-lo-que-“ningun-hombre”_47802_83134.html |title=Ana Flores quiere hacer lo que 'ningún hombre' pudo |trans-title=Ana Flores Wants to Do What 'No Man' Could |last=María Julia |first=Osorio M. |work=[[Los Tiempos]] |language=Spanish |date=1 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204014140/http://www.lostiempos.com/ustedelige/coyuntura/coyuntura/20091201/ana-flores-quiere-hacer-lo-que-%E2%80%9Cningun-hombre%E2%80%9D_47802_83134.html |archive-date=4 December 2009 |dead-url=yes |access-date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kidnapping===
In 2012, at age 60, Flores was kidnapped by a gang in the city of [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]]. According to some Bolivian media, she paid a ransom for her release (she never disclosed the amount of money), thus regaining her freedom. The report of her abduction would become national news.&lt;ref name=colombianos/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.eldiario.net/noticias/2015/2015_02/nt150209/politica.php?n=59&amp;-desarrollo-y-seguridad-ciudadana-para-la-paz |title=Desarrollo y seguridad ciudadana para La Paz |trans-title=Development and Citizen Security For La Paz |work=[[El Diario (La Paz)|El Diario]] |language=Spanish |date=9 February 2015 |access-date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, at age 63, Flores returned to Bolivian politics, but this time participating in regional elections for the position of mayor of the city of [[La Paz]] for the [[Revolutionary Nationalist Movement]]. She lost in subnational elections held on 29 March.&lt;ref name=mirada/&gt;

'''''Big Pharma''''' is a simulation game developed by Twice Circled and published by [[Positech Games]] where one builds a drug factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Big Pharma|url=http://www.bigpharmagame.com/|website=Big Pharma Game|publisher=Paradox Games|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The game was released on 27 August 2015.

==Game mechanics==
[[File:Big Pharma (Video Game) Drug Factory, October 10, 2015.png|thumb|left|An example of a factory with multiple production lines.]]
In ''Big Pharma'' the player takes the role as the manager of a pharmaceutical company, producing prescription drugs from raw materials. Raw materials have intrinsic positive (e.g., "Reduces coughs") and negative (e.g., "Induces drowsiness") effects that present themselves when the material is within a set [[concentration]] range, with possible concentrations ranging on a 0-to-20 scale. Most of the positive benefits can be enhanced to more desirable effects, or negative side effects can be outright removed, by bringing the material to a specific concentration range and applying an indicated process, some further requiring the addition of a [[catalyst]] material which itself carries positive and negative effects. Materials can also be mixed to combine positive and negative benefits to create more potent drugs. The goal in the mixing and preparation of materials is to achieve drugs that have their positive effects as close to their maximum potency concentration while either eliminating side effects or bringing the material's concentration as far away from the side effects' maximum potency levels.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wicksteed|first1=Tim|title=How to Play|url=http://www.bigpharmagame.com/howtoplay.html|website=Big Pharma|publisher=Positech Games|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The player produces the drugs using an assembly line approach with various equipment that can modify the concentration of the material, combine materials, rearrange the effects of a material to determine how effects combine when mixed, analyze materials to determine maximum potency levels, and finally prepare the material in pill form for delivery. This is done on an [[isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|isometric]] view of building plant floorplan, with various ports along the edges that can be used to bring in materials or ship out completed drugs. Materials are transported via conveyor belts between the processing units. Added building space can be purchased with in-game funds. The player can click on processes or materials to evaluate their current state, thus giving them the ability to debug the production line. Once the player has produced a complete pill from specific materials for the first time and delivered it to an output port, they are given the opportunity to name the product. This product is then sold on the game's virtual market. The produce is rated on a letter-grade based on the effectiveness and lack of side-effects as well as current market demand. The production lines operate in real-time - in that while the player can pause the game to arrange equipment within a production line, the game while running tracks the movement of each unit of material through the production line and only considered each unit as a product when it reaches the end of the production line.

In the larger game, the player must build up these drug production lines to maintain a profit and allow them to build additional lines. Scenarios in the game include competing companies that will also be releasing prescription drugs that will impact the profitability of the player's products. For example, if other companies have released a cold remedy drug, the market may be too saturated for a better cold remedy to succeed. The player can review what market demand there is for specific remedies to tailor productions toward those goals. In addition, the player can manage a [[technology tree|research tree]] that enables more effective process equipment and other benefits to be built, and send out explorers to research on new possible ingredients to build from. The game includes a number of preset scenarios (such as reached a financial milestone after a number of years of operation) at various difficulty levels as well as the ability to create a custom open-ended game.

An expansion, "Marketing And Malpractice", was released on 26 April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://store.steampowered.com/app/458640 | title =  Big Pharma: Marketing and Malpractice | first =  | last =  | date = April 26, 2016 | accessdate = April 30, 2016 | work = [[Steam (software)]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This expansion will add Executives as part of the company which can be used to market the drugs produced by the player's production lines, as well as to try to manipulate and corner the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/03/31/big-pharma-expansion-malpractice-manipulation/| title =  Big Pharma Expansion Adds Malpractice &amp; Manipulation | first = John | last = Walker | date = March 31, 2016 | accessdate = March 31, 2016 | work = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=February 2011}}

'''Build to order''' ('''BTO''') and sometimes referred to as '''make to order''' or '''made to order''' ('''MTO'''), is a [[Mass production|production]] approach where products are not built until a confirmed order for products is received. BTO is the oldest style of [[order fulfillment]] and is the most appropriate approach used for ''highly customized'' or ''low volume'' products. 

"Made to order" products are common in the food service industry, such as at restaurants.

==Overview==
This approach is considered good for [[Mass customization|highly configured]] products, e.g. [[automobile]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Holweg and Pil, 2004, pg.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parry and Graves, 2008, pg.&lt;/ref&gt; [[bicycles]], [[Server (computing)|computer servers]], or for products where holding inventories is very expensive, e.g. [[aircraft]].

In an automotive context, BTO is a demand driven production approach where a product is scheduled and built in response to a confirmed order received for it from a final customer.&lt;ref name=Roehrich&gt;Roehrich, J.K.; Parry, G. and Graves, A. (2011), [http://www.inderscience.com/search/index.php?action=record&amp;rec_id=40869. Implementing build-to-order strategies: enablers and barriers in the European automotive industry], ''International Journal of Automotive Technology and Management''. 11(3): 221-235&lt;/ref&gt; The final customer refers to a known individual owner and excludes all orders by the [[original equipment manufacturer]] (OEM), national sales companies (NSC), dealers or point of sales, bulk orders or other intermediaries in the [[supply chain]]. BTO excludes the order amendment function, whereby forecast orders in the pipeline are amended to customer requirements, as this is seen as another level of sophistication for a [[build to stock]] (BTS) system (also known as build to forecast (BTF)).

BTS is the dominant approach used today across many industries and refers to products that are built before a final purchaser has been identified, with production volume driven by historical demand information.&lt;ref&gt;Parry and Graves, 2008, pg.&lt;/ref&gt; This high stock level, endemic across the auto industry allows some dealers to find an exact or very close match to the customer’s desired vehicle within the dealer networks and supplier parks. The vehicle can then be delivered as soon as transport can be arranged. This has been used to justify stock levels. Whilst providing a rapid response to customer demand, the approach is expensive, mainly in terms of stock, but also transportation as finished goods are rarely where they are required. Holding stock of such a high cash value as finished goods is a key driver of the current crisis in the automotive industry - a crisis that could be eased by implementation of a BTO system.&lt;ref name=Roehrich /&gt;

A BTO system does not mean that all suppliers in the supplier chain should be producing only when a customer order has been confirmed. Clearly, it would not make economic sense for a manufacturer of low value high volume parts to employ BTO. It is appropriate that these should be identified and built to a supplier order, effectively BTS. Part of the challenge in a BTO supplier network is in the identification of which suppliers should be BTO and which BTS. The point in the supply chain when this change occurs is called the ‘decoupling point’. Currently, the majority of automotive supply chains lack a decoupling point and the dominant BTS approach has resulted in billions of dollars of capital being tied up in stock in the supply chain.&lt;ref&gt;Parry and Graves, 2008, pg.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some firms build all their products to order while others practice (BTS). Given the widespread proliferation of products, there are a number of [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]] taking a combined approach, where some items are BTS and others are BTO, which is commonly referred to as "hybrid BTO".&lt;ref&gt;Holweg and Pil, 2001, pg.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main advantages of the BTO approach in environments of high product variety is the ability to supply the customer with the exact product specification required, the reduction in sales discounts and finished good inventory, as well a reduction in stock obsolescence risk. The main disadvantage of BTO is manufacturers are susceptible to market demand fluctuations leading to a reduced capacity utilization in manufacturing. Hence, to ensure an effective use of production resources, a BTO approach should be coupled with proactive demand management. Finding the correct and appropriate balance of BTO and BTS to maintain stock levels appropriate to both the market requirement and operational stability is a current area of academic research.

Related approaches to BTO include the Engineer to Order (ETO) approach, where after an order is received, a part of or the whole design is done, as well as the Assemble to Order (ATO). Together with the BTS approach, these strategies form the spectrum of [[order fulfillment]] strategies a firm can adopt.

'''Claritas PRIZM Premier''' is a set of geo-demographic segments for the United States, developed by Claritas Inc., (which was owned under [[Nielsen Corporation|The Nielsen Company]] umbrella from 2009-2016). It is a widely used customer segmentation system for marketing in the United States to help companies find customers, quickly and at scale. 

PRIZM® Premier combines demographics, consumer behavior and geographic data to help marketers understand, find and engage with their customers and prospects on the right channels at the right time.  

PRIZM Premier classifies every U.S. household into one of 68 consumer segments based on the household’s purchasing preferences. PRIZM Premier offers a complete set of ancillary databases and links to third-party data, allowing marketers to use data outside of their own customer files to pinpoint products and services that their best customers are most likely to use, as well as locate their best customers on the ground. PRIZM Premier enables marketers to create a complete portrait of their customers for smarter targeting. PRIZM Premier is an update to PRIZM model that featured 66 segments, and it includes new inputs for technology adoption and wealth.  

PRIZM Premier segments are numbered according to socioeconomic rank (which takes into account characteristics such as income, education, occupation and home value) and are grouped into 11 Lifestage groups and 14 social groups. Social groups are based on urbanicity and socioeconomic rank. Lifestage groups are based on age, socioeconomic rank, and the presence of children at home.

PRIZM Premier provides a seamless transition between household-level coding and geographic-level coding by providing the same segment schema at both levels. It allows a ‘downshift’ from geo-demographic to the household-level when more precision is required.

'''''Control Engineering''''' ({{ISSN|0010-8049}}) is a trade publication and web site owned by CFE Media serving the information needs of engineering decision-makers in the global control, instrumentation, and automation marketplace.

Established in 1954, ''Control Engineering '' is published monthly. Common topics presented through news, product listings, feature articles, case studies and opinion, included controllers ([[Programmable logic controller|PLCS]] &amp; [[Programmable automation controller|PACs]]), motors and drives, safety (machine and process), [[system integration]] (software, hardware, power supplies, components), control software (including [[Human machine interface|HMI]], [[SCADA]] and [[Manufacturing Execution Systems|MES]]), [[process control]], [[Discrete event dynamic system|discrete control]], industrial networks (fieldbus, Ethernet and wireless), sensors, robotics, I/O, and sustainable/green engineering.

''Control Engineering'' published six other editions for Europe [http://www.controlengeurope.com], Asia [http://www.ceasiamag.com], China [http://www.cechinamag.com], Poland [http://www.controlengpolska.com], Russia [http://www.controlengrussia.com], and the Czech Republic [http://www.controlengcesko.com], as well as an online edition for the Middle East [http://www.controlengme.com].

As of June 2008, total [[BPA Worldwide|BPA]] audited circulation was 87,000 subscribers.

In April 2010, former owner [[Reed Business Information]] announced the magazine's closure; later that month, ''Control Engineering'', ''[[Consulting-Specifying Engineer]]'' and ''[[Plant Engineering]]'' were acquired by a new company, CFE Media.

Control Engineering Magazine is available in paper, digital, and online versions.  The monthly online version contains several blogs that focus on a varitey of hot topics in the world of automation and control.

One of the blogs is called [http://www.controleng.com/blogs/aiming-for-automated-vehicles.html AIMing for Automated Vehicles] and is written by former DARPA Grand Challenge team leader Paul Grayson.  He writes about an eclectic assortment of people, parts, and products that people interested in the progress of autonomous vehicles might find interesting.  He is also a strong supporter of efforts to improve Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math education in the USA and has started a 4-H technology club in his neighborhood.  His adventures working with the next generation of engineers and scientists provide and interesting perspective and sometimes surprises which he reports in the blog.

'''Corporate law''' (also known as '''business law''' or '''enterprise law''' or sometimes '''company law''') is the body of [[law]] governing the [[rights]], relations, and [[Behavior|conduct]] of [[Legal person|persons]], [[Company|companies]], [[organization]]s and [[business]]es. It refers to the legal practice relating to, or the theory of [[corporations]]. Corporate law often describes the law relating to matters which derive directly from the life-cycle of a corporation.&lt;ref name=armour&gt;John Armour, Henry Hansmann, Reinier Kraakman, Mariana Pargendler "What is Corporate Law?" in ''The Anatomy of Corporate Law: A Comparative and Functional Approach''(Eds Reinier Kraakman, John Armour, Paul Davies, Luca Enriques, Henry Hansmann, Gerard Hertig, Klaus Hopt, Hideki Kanda, Mariana Pargendler, Wolf-Georg Ringe, and Edward Rock, Oxford University Press 2017)1.1 &lt;/ref&gt; It thus encompasses the formation, funding, governance, and death of a corporation.

While the minute nature of corporate governance as personified by [[shareholders|share ownership]], [[capital market]], and [[business culture]] rules differ, similar legal characteristics - and legal problems - exist across many jurisdictions. Corporate law regulates how [[corporations]], [[investor]]s, [[shareholders]], [[Board of directors|directors]], [[employees]], [[creditors]], and other [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] such as [[consumer]]s, the [[community]], and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] interact with one another.&lt;ref name=armour/&gt; Whilst the term '''company''' or '''business law''' is colloquially used interchangeably with corporate law, '''business law''' often refers to wider concepts of ''commercial law'', that is, the law relating to commercial or business related activities. In some cases, this may include matters relating to corporate governance or [[financial law]]. When used as a substitute for corporate law, '''business law''' means the law relating to the ''business corporation''(or business enterprises), i.e. capital raising (through equity or debt), company formation, registration, etc.

== Overview ==
Academics identify four legal characteristics universal to business enterprises. These are: 
*[[Separate legal personality]] of the corporation (access to tort and [[Contract Law|contract law]] in a manner similar to a person)
*[[Limited liability]] of the shareholders (a shareholder's personal liability is limited to the value of their shares in the corporation)
*[[Share (finance)|Transferable share]]s (if the corporation is a "[[public company]]", the shares are traded on a [[stock exchange]])
*[[Delegation|Delegated management]] under a board structure; the [[board of directors]] delegates day-to-day management of the company to [[Executive (management)|executives]].&lt;ref name=armour/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[RC Clark]], ''Corporate Law'' (Aspen 1986) 2; H Hansmann et al, ''Anatomy of Corporate Law'' (2004) ch 1 set out similar criteria, and in addition state modern companies involve shareholder ownership. However this latter feature is not the case in many European jurisdictions, where employees participate in their companies.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Widely available and user-friendly corporate law enables business participants to possess these four legal characteristics and thus transact as businesses. Thus, corporate law is a response to three endemic opportunism: conflicts between managers and shareholders, between controlling and non-controlling shareholders; and between shareholders and other contractual counterparts (including creditors and employees).

A [[corporation]] may accurately be called a company; however, a company should not necessarily be called a corporation, which has distinct characteristics. In the United States, a company may or may not be a separate legal entity, and is often used synonymous with "firm" or "business." According to [[Black's Law Dictionary]], in America a company means "a corporation — or, less commonly, an association, partnership or union — that carries on industrial enterprise."&lt;ref&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]], 8th edition (2004), {{ISBN|0-314-15199-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of business associations can include [[partnership]]s (in the UK governed by the Partnership Act 1890), or [[trusts]] (Such as a pension fund), or companies limited by guarantee (like some community organizations or charities). Corporate law deals with companies that are incorporated or registered under the corporate or company law of a [[sovereign state]] or their [[Administrative division|sub-national states]]. 

The defining feature of a corporation is its legal independence from the shareholders that own it. Under corporate law, corporations of all sizes have [[separate legal personality]], with [[limited liability|limited]] or [[unlimited company|unlimited]] liability for its shareholders. Shareholders control the company through a [[board of directors]] which, in turn, typically delegates control of the corporation's day-to-day operations to a full-time [[Executive (management)|executive]]. Shareholders' losses, in the event of liquidation, are limited to their stake in the corporation, and they are not liable for any remaining debts owed to the corporation's creditors. This rule is called [[limited liability]], and it is why the names of corporations end with "[[Ltd.]]". or some variant such as "[[Incorporation (business)|Inc.]]" or "[[Public limited company|plc]]"). 

Under almost all legal systems{{which?|date=May 2018}} corporations have much the same legal rights and obligations as individuals. In some jurisdictions, this extends to allow corporations to exercise [[human rights]] against real individuals and the state,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[South African Constitution]] Art.8, especially Art.(4)&lt;/ref&gt; and they may be responsible for human rights violations.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip I. Blumberg, The Multinational Challenge to Corporation Law: The Search for a New Corporate Personality, (1993) has a very good discussion of the controversial nature of additional rights being granted to corporations.&lt;/ref&gt; Just as they are "born" into existence through its members obtaining a [[certificate of incorporation]], they can "die" when they lose money into [[insolvency]]. Corporations can even be convicted of criminal offences, such as [[corporate fraud]] and [[corporate manslaughter]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate Law Background==
In order to understand the role corporate law plays within commercial law, it is useful to understand the historical development of the corporation, and the development of modern company law. 
===History of the Corporation===
{{Relevance inline|paragraph|date=May 2018}}
{{main|Corporation#History|l1=History of corporations}}
[[Image:South Sea Bubble.jpg|left|thumb|[[William Hogarth|Hogarthian]] image of the [[South Sea Bubble]], by [[Edward Matthew Ward]], [[Tate Gallery]]]]
Although some forms of companies are thought to have existed during [[Ancient Rome]] and [[Ancient Greece]], the closest recognizable ancestors of the modern company did not appear until the 16th century. With increasing international trade, [[Royal charter]]s were granted in Europe (notably in [[England]] and [[Holland]]) to merchant adventurers.  The Royal charters usually conferred special privileges on the trading company (including, usually, some form of [[monopoly]]).  Originally, traders in these entities traded stock on their own account, but later the members came to operate on joint account and with joint stock, and the new [[Joint stock company]] was born.&lt;ref&gt;In England the first joint stock company was the [[British East India Company|East India Company]], which received its charter in 1600.  The [[Dutch East India Company]] received its charter in 1602, but is generally recognized as the first company in the world to issue joint stock. Not coincidentally, the two companies were competitors.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early companies were purely economic ventures; it was only a belatedly established benefit of holding joint stock that the company's stock could not be seized for the debts of any individual member.&lt;ref&gt;In England, see ''Edmunds v Brown Tillard'' (1668) 1 Lev 237 and ''Salmon v The Hamborough Co'' (1671) 1 Ch Cas 204&lt;/ref&gt; The development of company law in Europe was hampered by two notorious "bubbles" (the [[South Sea Company|South Sea Bubble]] in England and the [[Tulip mania|Tulip Bulb Bubble]] in the [[Dutch Republic]]) in the 17th century, which set the development of companies in the two leading jurisdictions back by over a century in popular estimation.

===Modern company law===
[[File:Jack and the Giant Joint-Stock.jpg|thumb|right|"Jack and the Giant Joint-Stock", a cartoon in ''Town Talk'' (1858) satirizing the 'monster' joint-stock economy that came into being after the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1844]].]]
Companies, almost inevitably, returned to the forefront of commerce, although in England to circumvent the [[Bubble Act]] 1720 investors had reverted to trading the stock of unincorporated associations, until it was repealed in 1825.{{Relevance inline|paragraph|date=May 2018}} However, the cumbersome process of obtaining Royal charters was simply insufficient to keep up with demand.  In England there was a lively trade in the charters of defunct companies.  However, procrastination amongst the legislature meant that in the United Kingdom it was not until the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1844]] that the first equivalent of modern companies, formed by registration, appeared. Soon after came the [[Limited Liability Act 1855]], which in the event of a company's bankruptcy limited the liability of all shareholders to the amount of capital they had invested.

The beginning of modern company law came when the two pieces of legislation were codified under the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1856]] at the behest of the then Vice President of the Board of Trade, Mr [[Robert Lowe, 1st Viscount Sherbrooke|Robert Lowe]]. That legislation shortly gave way to the railway boom, and from there the numbers of companies formed soared. In the later nineteenth century depression took hold, and just as company numbers had boomed, many began to implode and fall into insolvency. Much strong academic, legislative and judicial opinion was opposed to the notion that businessmen could escape accountability for their role in the failing businesses. The last significant development in the history of companies was the decision of the House of Lords in ''[[Salomon v. Salomon &amp; Co.]]'' where the House of Lords confirmed the separate legal personality of the company, and that the liabilities of the company were separate and distinct from those of its owners.

In a December 2006 article, ''[[The Economist]]'' identified the development of the joint stock company as one of the key reasons why Western commerce moved ahead of its rivals in the Middle East in post-[[renaissance]] era.&lt;ref&gt;"Long ago, the region's failure to develop joint-stock companies was one reason why it fell behind the West." from [http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_RQTPDDJ&amp;login=Y&amp;CFID=104408993&amp;CFTOKEN=3fd5f61-d9f0ee11-3443-43d4-b694-1160bf9d5298 "Think local"]. ''The Economist''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Relevance inline|paragraph|date=May 2018}}

==Corporate Structure==
{{Main article|Corporation}}
{{see|Types of business entity}}
The law of business organizations originally derived from the [[common law]] of [[England]], and has evolved significantly in the 20th century. In common law countries today, the most commonly addressed forms are:{{Relevance inline|paragraph|date=May 2018}}
* [[Corporation]]
* [[Limited company]]
* [[Unlimited company]]
* [[Limited liability partnership]]
* [[Limited partnership]]
* [[Not-for-profit corporation]]
* [[Company limited by guarantee]]
* [[Partnership]]
* [[Sole Proprietorship]]
The proprietary limited company is a statutory business form in several countries, including [[Australia]]. Many countries have forms of business entity unique to that country, although there are equivalents elsewhere. Examples are the [[limited liability company]] (LLC) and the [[limited liability limited partnership]] (LLLP) in the United States. Other types of business organizations, such as [[cooperative]]s, [[credit unions]] and publicly owned enterprises, can be established with purposes that parallel, supersede, or even replace the [[profit maximization]] mandate of business corporations.

There are various types of company that can be formed in different jurisdictions, but the most common forms of company are:
* ''a [[company limited by guarantee]]''. Commonly used where companies are formed for non-commercial purposes, such as clubs or charities. The members guarantee the payment of certain (usually nominal) amounts if the company goes into [[Liquidation|insolvent liquidation]], but otherwise they have no economic rights in relation to the company .
* ''a company limited by guarantee with a share capital''. A hybrid entity, usually used where the company is formed for non-commercial purposes, but the activities of the company are partly funded by investors who expect a return.
* ''a [[Private limited company by shares|company limited by shares]]''. The most common form of company used for business ventures.
* ''an [[Unlimited Company|unlimited company]]'' either with or without a share capital. This is a hybrid company, a company similar to its limited company (Ltd.) counterpart but where the members or shareholders do not benefit from limited liability should the company ever go into formal [[liquidation]].
There are, however, many specific categories of corporations and other business organizations which may be formed in various countries and [[jurisdiction]]s throughout the world.

===Corporate legal personality===
{{main|Piercing the corporate veil}}
One of the key legal features of corporations are their separate legal personality, also known as "personhood" or being "artificial persons". However, the separate legal personality was not confirmed under [[English law]] until 1895 by the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] in ''[[Salomon v. Salomon &amp; Co.]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Salomon v. Salomon &amp; Co.]]'' [1897] AC 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Separate legal personality often has [[unintended consequence]]s, particularly in relation to smaller, [[family company|family companies]]. In ''[[B v. B]]'' [1978] Fam 181 it was held that a [[discovery (law)|discovery order]] obtained by a wife against her husband was not effective against the husband's company as it was not named in the order and was separate and distinct from him.&lt;ref&gt;Although it did attach to documents within the husband's custody or control.&lt;/ref&gt; And in ''[[Macaura v. Northern Assurance Co Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Macaura v. Northern Assurance Co Ltd]]'' [1925] AC 619&lt;/ref&gt; a claim under an insurance policy failed where the insured had transferred timber from his name into the name of a company wholly owned by him, and it was subsequently destroyed in a fire; as the property now belonged to the company and not to him, he no longer had an "insurable interest" in it and his claim failed.

Separate legal personality allows corporate groups flexibility in relation to tax planning, and management of overseas liability. For instance in ''[[Adams v. Cape Industries plc]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Adams v. Cape Industries plc]]'' [1990] Ch 433&lt;/ref&gt; it was held that victims of asbestos poisoning at the hands of an American subsidiary could not sue the English parent in tort. Whilst academic discussion highlights certain specific situations where courts are generally prepared to "[[piercing the corporate veil|pierce the corporate veil]]", to look directly at, and impose liability directly on the individuals behind the company; the actually practice of piercing the corporate veil is, at English law, non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;Goode ''Principles of Corporate Insolvency Law'' (3rd Edn, Sweet &amp; Maxwell 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the court will look beyond the corporate form where the corporation is a sham or perpetuating a fraud. The most commonly cited examples are:
* where the company is a mere façade
* where the company is effectively just the agent of its members or controllers
* where a representative of the company has taken some personal responsibility for a statement or action&lt;ref&gt;''Williams v Natural Life'' [1998] 1 WLR 830&lt;/ref&gt;
* where the company is engaged in fraud or other criminal wrongdoing
* where the natural interpretation of a contract or statute is as a reference to the corporate group and not the individual company
* where permitted by statute (for example, many jurisdictions provide for shareholder liability where a company breaches [[Environmental law|environmental protection laws]])

====Capacity and powers====
{{see also|Corporate benefit}}
Historically,  because companies are artificial persons created by operation of law, the law prescribed what the company could and could not do.  Usually this was an expression of the commercial purpose which the company was formed for, and came to be referred to as the company's ''objects'', and the extent of the objects are referred to as the company's [[capacity (law)|capacity]].  If an activity fell outside the company's capacity it was said to be ''[[ultra vires]]'' and [[void (law)|void]].

By way of distinction, the organs of the company were expressed to have various ''corporate powers''.  If the objects were the things that the company was able to do, then the powers were the means by which it could do them.  Usually expressions of powers were limited to methods of raising capital, although from earlier times distinctions between objects and powers have caused lawyers difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;See the frustration expressed by the House of Lords in ''[[Cotman v. Brougham]]'' [1918] AC 514&lt;/ref&gt; Most jurisdictions have now modified the position by statute, and companies generally have capacity to do all the things that a natural person could do, and power to do it in any way that a natural person could do it.

However, references to corporate capacity and powers have not quite been consigned to the dustbin of legal history.  In many jurisdictions, directors can still be liable to their shareholders if they cause the company to engage in businesses outside its objects, even if the transactions are still valid as between the company and the third party.  And many jurisdictions also still permit transactions to be challenged for lack of "[[corporate benefit]]", where the relevant transaction has no prospect of being for the commercial benefit of the company or its shareholders.

As artificial persons, companies can only act through human agents. The main agent who deals with the company's management and business is the [[board of directors]], but in many jurisdictions other officers can be appointed too.  The board of directors is normally elected by the members, and the other officers are normally appointed by the board. These agents enter into contracts on behalf of the company with third parties.

Although the company's agents owe duties to the company (and, indirectly, to the shareholders) to exercise those powers for a proper purpose, generally speaking third parties' rights are not impugned if it transpires that the officers were acting improperly.  Third parties are entitled to rely on the [[ostensible authority]] of agents held out by the company to act on its behalf.  A line of common law cases reaching back to ''[[Royal British Bank v Turquand]]'' established in common law that third parties were entitled to assume that the internal management of the company was being conducted properly, and the rule has now been codified into statute in most countries.

Accordingly, companies will normally be liable for all the act and omissions of their officers and agents.  This will include almost all [[torts]], but the law relating to [[corporate manslaughter|crimes committed by companies]] is complex, and varies significantly between countries.

====Corporate crime====
{{main|Corporate liability|Corporate crime}}
*[[Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007]]


===Corporate governance===
{{main|Corporate governance}}
Corporate governance is primarily the study of the power relations among a corporation's senior executives, its [[board of directors]] and those who elect them ([[shareholders]] in the "[[general meeting]]" and [[employees]]). It also concerns other stakeholders, such as [[creditors]], [[consumer]]s, the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] and the [[community]] at large. One of the main differences between different countries in the internal form of companies is between a two-tier and a one tier board. The United Kingdom, the United States, and most Commonwealth countries have single unified boards of directors. In Germany, companies have two tiers, so that shareholders (and employees) elect a "supervisory board", and then the supervisory board chooses the "management board". There is the option to use two tiers in France, and in the new European Companies ([[Societas Europaea]]).

Recent literature, especially from the United States, has begun to discuss corporate governance in the terms of [[management science]]. While post-war discourse centred on how to achieve effective "corporate democracy" for shareholders or other stakeholders, many scholars have shifted to discussing the law in terms of [[principal–agent problem]]s. On this view, the basic issue of corporate law is that when a "principal" party delegates his property (usually the shareholder's capital, but also the employee's labour) into the control of an "agent" (i.e. the director of the company) there is the possibility that the agent will act in his own interests, be "opportunistic", rather than fulfill the wishes of the principal. Reducing the risks of this opportunism, or the "agency cost", is said to be central to the goal of corporate law.


====Constitution====
{{main|Corporate constitution}}
[[Image:Vereinigte Ostindische Compagnie bond.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Bond (finance)|bond]] issued by the [[Dutch East India Company]], dating from 7 November 1623, for the amount of 2,400 [[Dutch gulden|florins]]]]
The rules for corporations derive from two sources. These are the country's statutes: in the US, usually the [[Delaware General Corporation Law]] (DGCL); in the UK, the [[Companies Act 2006]] (CA 2006); in Germany, the [http://www.bundesrecht.juris.de/aktg/ Aktiengesetz  (AktG)] and the [http://www.bundesrecht.juris.de/gmbhg/index.html Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung (GmbH-Gesetz, GmbHG).] The law will set out which rules are mandatory, and which rules can be derogated from. Examples of important rules which cannot be derogated from would usually include how to fire the [[board of directors]], what duties directors owe to the company or when a company must be dissolved as it approaches bankruptcy. Examples of rules that members of a company would be allowed to change and choose could include, what kind of procedure [[general meeting]]s should follow, when dividends get paid out, or how many members (beyond a minimum set out in the law) can amend the constitution.  Usually, the statute will set out [[Model Articles|model articles]], which the corporation's constitution will be assumed to have if it is silent on a bit of particular procedure.

The United States, and a few other common law countries, split the corporate constitution into two separate documents (the UK got rid of this in 2006). The [[memorandum of Association]] (or [[articles of incorporation]]) is the primary document, and will generally regulate the company's activities with the outside world. It states which objects the company is meant to follow (e.g. "this company makes automobiles") and specifies the [[authorised share capital]] of the company. The [[Articles of Association (law)|articles of association]] (or [[bylaw|by-laws]]) is the secondary document, and will generally regulate the company's internal affairs and management, such as procedures for board meetings, dividend entitlements etc. In the event of any inconsistency, the memorandum prevails&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ashbury v. Watson]]'' (1885) 30 Ch D 376&lt;/ref&gt; and in the United States only the memorandum is publicised. In [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, the company's constitution is normally consolidated into a single document, often called the [[charter]].

It is quite common for members of a company to supplement the corporate constitution with additional arrangements, such as ''[[shareholders' agreement]]s'', whereby they agree to exercise their membership rights in a certain way.  Conceptually a shareholders' agreement fulfills many of the same functions as the corporate constitution, but because it is a contract, it will not normally bind new members of the company unless they accede to it somehow.&lt;ref&gt;''Shalfoon v Cheddar Valley'' [1924] NZLR 561&lt;/ref&gt;  One benefit of shareholders' agreement is that they will usually be confidential, as most jurisdictions do not require shareholders' agreements to be publicly filed. Another common method of supplementing the corporate constitution is by means of ''[[voting trust]]s'', although these are relatively uncommon outside the [[United States]] and certain [[Offshore Financial Centre|offshore jurisdictions]]. Some jurisdictions consider the [[company seal]] to be a part of the "constitution" (in the loose sense of the word) of the company, but the requirement for a seal has been abrogated by legislation in most countries.

====Balance of power====
[[Image:Adolf Augustus Berle NYWTS.jpg|thumb|right|[[Adolf Berle]] in ''[[The Modern Corporation and Private Property]]'' argued that the separation of control of companies from the investors who were meant to own them endangered the American economy and led to a mal-[[distribution of wealth]].]]
The most important rules for corporate governance are those concerning the balance of power between the [[board of directors]] and the members of the company. Authority is given or "delegated" to the board to manage the company for the success of the investors. Certain specific decision rights are often reserved for shareholders, where their interests could be fundamentally affected. There are necessarily rules on when directors can be removed from office and replaced. To do that, meetings need to be called to vote on the issues. How easily the constitution can be amended and by whom necessarily affects the relations of power.

It is a principle of corporate law that the directors of a company have the right to manage. This is expressed in statute in the [[Delaware General Corporation Law|DGCL]], where §141(a)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc04/index.shtml#TopOfPage|title=TITLE  8 - CHAPTER 1. GENERAL CORPORATION LAW - Subchapter IV. Directors and Officers|website=delcode.delaware.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; states,

&lt;blockquote&gt;(a) The business and affairs of every corporation organized under this chapter shall be managed by or under the direction of a board of directors, except as may be otherwise provided in this chapter or in its certificate of incorporation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[Germany]], §76 [[Aktiengesellschaft|AktG]] says the same for the management board, while under §111 AktG the supervisory board's role is stated to be to "oversee" (''überwachen''). In the [[United Kingdom]], the right to manage is not laid down in law, but is found in Part.2 of the [[Model Articles]]. This means it is a default rule, which companies can opt out of (s.20 [[Companies Act 2006|CA 2006]]) by reserving powers to members, although companies rarely do. UK law specifically reserves shareholders right and duty to approve "substantial non cash asset transactions" (s.190 CA 2006), which means those over 10% of company value, with a minimum of £5,000 and a maximum of £100,000.&lt;ref&gt;See also, [[Listing Rule]] 10 for public companies, setting out a scale of transactions requiring shareholder approval and disclosure.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar rules, though much less stringent, exist in §271 DGCL&lt;ref&gt;Shareholders must approve sale of "all or substantially all assets", held in ''Gimbel'' (1974) to be those "qualitatively vital to the existence and purpose" of the corporation; which in ''[[Katz v. Bregman]]'' (1981) was held to include assets under 50% of the company's value&lt;/ref&gt; and through case law in Germany under the so-called ''[[Holzmüller-Doktrin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Bundesgerichtshof]]'' held that shareholders must approve a sale of assets amounting to 80% of the company's value&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably the most fundamental guarantee that directors will act in the members' interests is that they can easily be sacked. During the [[Great Depression]], two [[Harvard University|Harvard]] scholars, [[Adolf Berle]] and [[Gardiner Means]] wrote ''[[The Modern Corporation and Private Property]]'', an attack on American law which failed to hold directors to account, and linked the growing power and autonomy of directors to the economic crisis. In the UK, the right of members to remove directors by a simple majority is assured under s.168 CA 2006&lt;ref&gt;c.f. ''[[Bushell v. Faith]]'', and query whether the decision would still be decided the same way.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Art.21 of the Model Articles requires a third of the board to put themselves up for re-election every year (in effect creating maximum three year terms). 10% of shareholders can demand a meeting any time, and 5% can if it has been a year since the last one (s.303 CA 2006). In Germany, where employee participation creates the need for greater boardroom stability, §84(3) AktG states that management board directors can only be removed by the supervisory board for an important reason (''ein wichtiger Grund'') though this can include a vote of no-confidence by the shareholders. Terms last for five years, unless 75% of shareholders vote otherwise. §122 AktG lets 10% of shareholders demand a meeting. In the US, Delaware lets directors enjoy considerable autonomy. §141(k) DGCL states that directors can be removed without any cause, unless the board is "classified", meaning that directors only come up for re-appointment on different years. If the board is classified, then directors cannot be removed unless there is gross misconduct. Director's autonomy from shareholders is seen further in §216 DGCL, which allows for plurality voting and §211(d) which states shareholder meetings can only be called if the constitution allows for it.&lt;ref&gt;See also, SEC 13d-5, dating from times when groups of investors were considered potential [[cartel]]s, saying any 5% shareholder voting block must register with the Federal financial authority, the [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]].&lt;/ref&gt; The problem is that in America, directors usually choose where a company is incorporated and §242(b)(1) DGCL says any constitutional amendment requires a resolution by the directors. By contrast, constitutional amendments can be made at any time by 75% of shareholders in Germany (§179 AktG) and the UK (s.21 CA 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Though the Constitution may allow particular provisions to be further "entrenched", s.22; Furthermore, Art.3 of the Model Articles allows 75% of members in general meeting to give the directors specific instructions.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Director duties===
{{main|Board of directors|Directors' duties}}
In most jurisdictions, directors owe [[fiduciary|strict duties of good faith]], as well as duties of care and skill, to safeguard the interests of the company and the members. In many developed countries outside the English speaking world, company boards are appointed as representatives of both shareholders and employees to "[[Codetermination|codetermine]]" company strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/jil/articles/volume2/issue2/MertensSchanze2J.Comp.Corp.L.&amp;Sec.Reg.75(1979).pdf|format=PDF|journal=Journal of Comparative Corporate Law and Securities Regulation|volume=2|date=1979|pages=75-88|publisher=North-Holland Publishing Company|title=The German Codetermination Act OF 1976|author1=Hans-Joachim Mertens|author2=Erich Schanze}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate law is often divided into [[corporate governance]] (which concerns the various power relations within a corporation) and [[corporate finance]] (which concerns the rules on how capital is used).
Directors also owe strict duties not to permit any [[conflict of interest]] or conflict with their duty to act in the best interests of the company.  This rule is so strictly enforced that, even where the conflict of interest or conflict of duty is purely hypothetical, the directors can be forced to disgorge all personal gains arising from it.  In ''[[Aberdeen Ry v. Blaikie]]'' (1854) 1 Macq HL 461 [[Robert Rolfe, 1st Baron Cranworth|Lord Cranworth]] stated in his judgment that, {{Quote frame|"A corporate body can only act by agents, and it is, of course, the duty of those agents so to act as best to promote the interests of the corporation whose affairs they are conducting.  Such agents have duties to discharge of a fiduciary nature towards their principal.  And it is a rule of universal application that no one, having such duties to discharge, shall be allowed to enter into engagements in which he has, ''or can have'', a personal interest conflicting ''or which possibly may conflict'', with the interests of those whom he is bound to protect... So strictly is this principle adhered to that no question is allowed to be raised as to the fairness or unfairness of the contract entered into..."}} However, in many jurisdictions the members of the company are permitted to ratify transactions which would otherwise fall foul of this principle.&lt;ref&gt;Goode ''Corporate Insolvency Law'' (3rd Edn Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2013) 214&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also largely accepted in most jurisdictions that this principle should be capable of being abrogated in the company's constitution. 
The standard of skill and care that a director owes is usually described as acquiring and maintaining sufficient knowledge and understanding of the company's business to enable him to properly discharge his duties. This duty enables the company to seek compensation from its director if it can be proved that a director has not shown reasonable skill or care which in turn has caused the company to incur a loss.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Co v Multinational Gas and Petrochemical Services Ltd]]'' [1983] Ch 258&lt;/ref&gt; In many jurisdictions, where a company continues to trade despite foreseeable [[bankruptcy]], the directors can be forced to account for trading losses personally. Directors are also strictly charged to exercise their powers only for a proper purpose.  For instance, were a director to issue a large number of new shares, not for the purposes of raising capital but in order to defeat a potential takeover bid, that would be an improper purpose.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Harlowe's Nominees Pty v. Woodside]]'' (1968) 121 CLR 483 (Aust HC)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company law theory==

[[Ronald Coase]] has pointed out, all business organizations represent an attempt to avoid certain costs associated with doing business. Each is meant to facilitate the contribution of specific resources - investment capital, knowledge, relationships, and so forth - towards a venture which will prove profitable to all contributors. Except for the partnership, all business forms are designed to provide [[limited liability]] to both members of the organization and external investors. Business organizations originated with [[Agency (law)|agency law]], which permits an agent to act on behalf of a principal, in exchange for the principal assuming equal liability for the wrongful acts committed by the agent. For this reason, all partners in a typical general partnership may be held liable for the wrongs committed by one partner. Those forms that provide limited liability are able to do so because the state provides a mechanism by which businesses that follow certain guidelines will be able to escape the full liability imposed under agency law. The state provides these forms because it has an interest in the strength of the companies that provide jobs and services therein, but also has an interest in monitoring and regulating their behaviour.

==Litigation==
{{main|Derivative suit|Unfair prejudice}}
Members of a company generally have rights against each other and against the company, as framed under the company's constitution.  However, members cannot generally claim against third parties who cause damage to the company which results in a diminution in the value of their shares or others membership interests because this is treated as "[[reflective loss]]" and the law normally regards the company as the proper claimant in such cases.

In relation to the exercise of their rights, minority shareholders usually have to accept that, because of the limits of their voting rights, they cannot direct the overall control of the company and must accept the will of the majority (often expressed as ''majority rule'').  However, majority rule can be iniquitous, particularly where there is one controlling shareholder. Accordingly, a number of exceptions have developed in law in relation to the general principle of majority rule.

* Where the majority shareholder(s) are exercising their votes to perpetrate a fraud on the minority, the courts may permit the minority to sue&lt;ref&gt;''[[Foss v Harbottle]]'' (1843) 2 Hare 461&lt;/ref&gt;
* members always retain the right to sue if the majority acts to invade their personal rights, e.g. where the company's affairs are not conducted in accordance with the company's constitution (this position has been debated because the extent of a personal right is not set in law). ''Macdougall v Gardiner'' and ''Pender v Lushington'' present irreconcilable differences in this area.
* in many jurisdictions it is possible for minority shareholders to take a ''representative'' or ''[[derivative action]]'' in the name of the company, where the company is controlled by the alleged wrongdoers

==Corporate finance==
{{main|Corporate finance}}
{{see|Financial law}}
Through the operational life of the corporation, perhaps the most crucial aspect of corporate law relates to raising capital for the business to operate. The law, as it relates to corporate finance, not only provides the framework for which a business raises funds - but also provides a forum for principles and policies which drive the fundraising, to be taken seriously. Two primary methods of financing exists with regard to corporate financing, these are:
*Equity financing; and
*Debt financing 
Each has relative advantages and disadvantages, both at law and economically. Additional methods of raising capital necessary to finance its operations is that of retained profits&lt;ref&gt;Gullifer and Payne ''Corporate Finance Law: Principles and Policy'' (2nd Edn Hart Publishing, 2015) 5-41&lt;/ref&gt; Various combinations of [[Financial law|financing structures]] have the capacity to produce fine-tuned transactions which, using the advantages of each form of financing, support the limitations of the corporate form, its industry, or economic sector.&lt;ref name=Gullifer&gt;Gullifer and Payne ''Corporate Finance Law: Principles and Policy'' (2nd Edn Hart Publishing, 2015) 38&lt;/ref&gt;. A mix of both debt and equity is crucial to the sustained health of the company, and its overall market value is independent of its capital structure. One notable difference is that interest payments to debt is tax deductible whilst payment of dividends are not, this will incentivise a company to issue debt financing rather than [[preferred shares]] in order to reduce their tax exposure. 
===Shares and share capital===

{{main|Stock}}
A company limited by shares, whether public or private, must have at least one issued share; however, depending on the corporate structure, the formatting may differ. If a company wishes to raise capital through equity, it will usually be done by issuing shares.  (sometimes called "stock" (not to be confused with stock-in-trade)) or [[warrant (finance)|warrants]]. In the common law, whilst a shareholder is often colloquially referred to as the owner of the company - it is clear that the shareholder is not an owner of the company but makes the shareholder a member of the company and entitles them to enforce the provisions of the company's constitution against the company and against other members.&lt;ref name=Gullifer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salomon v Salomon &lt;/ref&gt; A share is an item of property, and can be sold or transferred. Shares also normally have a nominal or par value, which is the limit of the shareholder's liability to contribute to the debts of the company on an insolvent liquidation. Shares usually confer a number of rights on the holder.  These will normally include:
* voting rights
* rights to [[dividend]]s (or payments made by companies to their shareholders) declared by the company
* rights to any return of [[capital (economics)|capital]] either upon redemption of the share, or upon the liquidation of the company
* in some countries, shareholders have preemption rights, whereby they have a preferential right to participate in future share issues by the company
Companies may issue different types of shares, called "classes" of shares, offering different rights to the shareholders depending on the underlying regulatory rules pertaining to corporate structures, taxation, and capital market rules. A company might issue both ordinary shares and preference shares, with the two types having different voting and/or economic rights. It might provide that preference shareholders shall each receive a cumulative preferred dividend of a certain amount per annum, but the ordinary shareholders shall receive everything else. Corporations will structure capital raising in this way in order to appeal to different lenders in the market by providing different incentives for investment.&lt;ref name=Gullifer/&gt; The total value of issued shares in a company is said to represent its ''equity capital''.  Most jurisdictions regulate the minimum amount of capital which a company may have,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} although some jurisdictions prescribe minimum amounts of capital for companies engaging in certain types of business (e.g. [[banking]], [[insurance]] etc.).{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}
Similarly, most jurisdictions regulate the maintenance of equity capital, and prevent companies returning funds to shareholders by way of distribution when this might leave the company financially exposed. Often this extends to prohibiting a company from providing [[financial assistance (share purchase)|financial assistance]] for the purchase of its own shares.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Dine, Marios Koutsias ''Company Law''(Macmillan International Higher Education 2014), 77&lt;/ref&gt;

==Matters affecting the continuation of the Corporate form==
Events such as mergers, acquisitions, insolvency, or the commission of a crime will adversely affect the corporation in its current form. At the end of the corporate lifecycle, a corporation may be "wound up" and enter into bankruptcy liquidation. This often arises when the corporation is unable to discharge its debts in a timely manner. Comparatively, a merger or acquisition can often mean the altering or extinguishing of the corporation. In addition to the creation of the corporation, and its financing, these events serve as a transition phase into either dissolution, or some other material shift. 

===Mergers and acquisitions===
{{main|Mergers and acquisitions}}


===Corporate insolvency===
{{main|Insolvency law}}
Liquidation is the normal means by which a company's existence is brought to an end. It is also referred to (either alternatively or concurrently) in some jurisdictions as ''winding up'' or ''dissolution''. Liquidations generally come in two forms — either ''compulsory liquidations'' (sometimes called ''creditors' liquidations'') and ''voluntary liquidations'' (sometimes called ''members' liquidations'', although a voluntary liquidation where the company is insolvent will also be controlled by the creditors, and is properly referred to as a ''creditors' voluntary liquidation''). Where a company goes into liquidation, normally a [[Liquidator (law)|liquidator]] is appointed to gather in all the company's assets and settle all claims against the company. If there is any surplus after paying off all the creditors of the company, this surplus is then distributed to the members.

As its names imply, applications for compulsory liquidation are normally made by [[creditor]]s of the company when the company is unable to pay its debts.  However, in some jurisdictions, regulators have the power to apply for the liquidation of the company on the grounds of public good, i.e., where the company is believed to have engaged in unlawful conduct, or conduct which is otherwise harmful to the public at large.

Voluntary liquidations occur when the company's members decide voluntarily to wind up the affairs of the company. This may be because they believe that the company will soon become [[insolvent]], or it may be on economic grounds if they believe that the purpose for which the company was formed is now at an end, or that the company is not providing an adequate return on assets and should be broken up and sold off.

Some jurisdictions also permit companies to be wound up on "just and equitable" grounds.&lt;ref&gt;In England, see ''Ebrahimi v Westbourne Galleries'' [1973] AC 360&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, applications for just and equitable winding-up are brought by a member of the company who alleges that the affairs of the company are being conducted in a prejudicial manner, and asking the court to bring an end to the company's existence.  For obvious reasons, in most countries, the courts have been reluctant to wind up a company solely on the basis of the disappointment of one member, regardless of how well-founded that member's complaints are.  Accordingly, most jurisdictions that permit just and equitable winding up also permit the court to impose other remedies, such as requiring the majority shareholder(s) to buy out the disappointed minority shareholder at a fair value.

===Insider dealing===
{{main|Insider dealing}}
'''Insider trading''' is the trading of a [[corporation]]'s [[stock]] or other [[security (finance)|securities]] (e.g., [[Bond (finance)|bond]]s or [[Option (finance)|stock options]]) by individuals with potential access to non-public information about the company. In most countries, trading by corporate insiders such as officers, key employees, directors, and large shareholders may be legal if this trading is done in a way that does not take advantage of non-public information. However, the term is frequently used to refer to a practice in which an insider or a related party trades based on [[Materiality (law)|material]] non-public information obtained during the performance of the insider's duties at the corporation, or otherwise in breach of a [[fiduciary]] or other relationship of trust and confidence or where the non-public information was misappropriated from the company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/answers/insider.htm Insider Trading] U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, accessed May 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Illegal insider trading is believed to raise the cost of capital for securities issuers, thus decreasing overall economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~charvey/Teaching/BA453_2005/BD_The_world.pdf "The World Price of Insider Trading"] by [[Utpal Bhattacharya]] and [[Hazem Daouk]] in the Journal of Finance, Vol. LVII, No. 1 (Feb. 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States and several other jurisdictions, trading conducted by corporate officers, key employees, directors, or significant shareholders (in the United States, defined as beneficial owners of ten percent or more of the firm's equity securities) must be reported to the regulator or publicly disclosed, usually within a few business days of the trade. Many investors follow the summaries of these insider trades in the hope that mimicking these trades will be profitable. While "legal" insider trading cannot be based on [[material non-public information]], some investors believe corporate insiders nonetheless may have better insights into the health of a corporation (broadly speaking) and that their trades otherwise convey important information (e.g., about the pending retirement of an important officer selling shares, greater commitment to the corporation by officers purchasing shares, etc.)

== United States ==
{{main|US corporate law}}{{Globalize|date=August 2010}}

In the [[United States]], most corporations are [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]], or organized, under the laws of a particular [[U.S. state|state]]. The laws of the state of incorporation normally governs a corporation's internal operations, even if the corporation's operations take place outside that state. Corporate law differs from state to state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Where To Incorporate Your Business|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/business/where_to_incorporate.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=3 April 2018|date=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these differences, some businesses will benefit from having a corporate [[lawyer]] determine the most appropriate or advantageous state in which to incorporate.

Business entities may also be regulated by [[federal law]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corporations|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/corporations|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some cases by [[local law]]s and ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salkin|first1=Patricia E.|title=Municipal Regulation of Formula Businesses|journal=Case Western Reserve Law Review|date=2008|volume=58|issue=4|page=1251|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/caselrev/vol58/iss4/17|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delaware===
A majority of publicly traded companies in the U.S. are [[Delaware corporation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Division of Corporations|url=https://corp.delaware.gov/aboutagency.shtml|website=Delaware Division of Corporations|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies choose to incorporate in Delaware because the [[Delaware General Corporation Law]] offers lower corporate taxes than many other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/092515/4-reasons-why-delaware-considered-tax-shelter.asp|title=4 Reasons Why Delaware Is Considered a Tax Shelter|last=Tarver|first=Evan|date=2015-09-25|work=Investopedia|access-date=2017-08-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[venture capitalists]] prefer to invest in Delaware corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feldman|first1=Sandra|title=Choice of Entity for Startups Seeking Venture Capital|url=https://ct.wolterskluwer.com/resource-center/articles/choice-entity-startups-seeking-venture-capital|website=Wolters Kluwer|publisher=CT Corporation System|date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the [[Delaware Court of Chancery]] is widely recognized as a good venue for the litigation of business disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Quillen|first1=William T.|last2=Hanrahan|first2=Michael|title=A Short History of the Court of Chancery|url=https://courts.delaware.gov/chancery/history.aspx|website=Delaware Court of Chancery|accessdate=3 April 2018|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Customer intelligence''' ('''CI''') is the process of gathering and analyzing information regarding customers, and their details and activities, to build deeper and more effective [[customer relationship management|customer relationships]] and improve decision-making by vendors.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Robert, Measuring and Valuing Customer Relationships (2000) Business Intelligence {{ISBN|978-1-898085-33-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==CRM==

Customer intelligence is a key component of effective [[customer relationship management]] (CRM), and when effectively implemented it is a rich source of insight into the behaviour and experience of a company's customer base. 

As an example, some customers walk into a store and walk out without buying anything. Information about these customers/prospects (or their visits) may not exist in a traditional CRM system, as no sales are entered on the store cash register. Although no commercial transaction took place, knowing ''why'' customers leave the store (perhaps by asking them, or a store employee, to complete a survey) and using this data to make inferences about customer behaviour, is an example of CI.

==Process==
Customer Intelligence begins with [[reference data]] – basic key facts about the customer, such as their geographic location.

This data is then supplemented&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oracle.com/oramag/profit/05-may/p25feature.html] Capturing Customer Intelligence – Oracle&lt;/ref&gt; with [[transaction data]] – reports of customer activity. This can be commercial information (for example purchase history from sales and order processing), interactions from service contacts over the phone and via e-mail.

A further subjective dimension can be added, in the form of customer satisfaction surveys or agent data. 

Finally, a company can use competitor insight and [[mystery shopping]] to get a better view of how their service benchmarks in the market.

By mining this data, and placing it in context with wider information about competitors, conditions in the industry, and general trends, information can be obtained about customers' existing and future needs, how they reach decisions, and predictions made about their future behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crm2day.com/customer-intelligence/] Customer Intelligence by CRM Today&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.g2i.org/article/2005/09/customer-intelligence |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20090424045459/http://www.g2i.org/article/2005/09/customer-intelligence |archivedate=24 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example sources of data==

[[Speech analytics]] – used to monitor telephone conversations taking place between companies and customers, using [[phonetic analysis]] or [[speech recognition|speech to text]] to find keywords and phrases, classify call types and identify trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nexidia.com/solutions/contact_center|title=404|first=|last=Nexidia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Mouse tracking|Click tracking]] – used to monitor the popularity and usage of corporate web sites, this data can provide clues to product interest and buying intention. For example, a company may infer a customer is interested in purchasing a particular service if they are spending time browsing specific product pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webtrends.com/Products/WebTrendsVisitorIntelligence.aspx|title=Digital Marketing Solutions - Webtrends|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Customer relationship management]] – software solutions used for [[Salesforce.com]], [[adeptcrmsales]] and to manage customer relationships which can store data on the quantity, type and category of customer and prospect contacts. 

Frontline data capture which may (or may not) form part of a CRM software solution, but which is used by front line agents to record more subjective data regarding customer contacts, such as the [[root cause]] of the customer picking up the phone (e.g. they received their bill) or their emotional state.

[[Customer satisfaction]] and [[market research]] surveys, often mined via [[text analytics]], which can additionally be applied, for customer intelligence purposes, to contact center notes, e-mail, and other textual sources.

==Benefits==

Customer intelligence provides a detailed understanding of the experience customers have in interacting with a company, and allows predictions to be made regarding reasons behind customer behaviors.

This knowledge can then be applied to support more effective and strategic decision making – for example, understanding why customers call makes it easier to predict (and plan to reduce) call volumes in a [[contact centre (business)|contact centre]].

'''Ricardo "Dong" Puno Jr.''' (born January 20, 1946) is a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] television public affairs host,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://telebisyon.net/Dong-Puno-Live/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623021845/http://telebisyon.net/Dong-Puno-Live/ |archivedate=2011-06-23 |df= }} Retrieved 20 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; media executive, newspaper columnist, and [[lawyer]].

==Early life==
Ricardo Puno Jr. was born on January 20, 1946 in [[Manila]]. Puno was previously Senior Vice President for News and Current Affairs of the [[ABS-CBN Corporation|ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation]] and Executive Vice President of the [[ABS-CBN News Channel]].  On top of that, he wrote articles for his column "My Viewpoint" first on ''[[The Philippine Star]]'' and later ''[[Manila Times|The Manila Times]]''.  He was the host for a public affairs program, Viewpoints, shown on ANC.

He is the senior partner of the Puno and Puno Law Offices, Vice President-General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of the nation's flag-carrier, the [[Philippine Airlines]] (1986–1990 and 1978–1983) and a member of the Philippine Panel for International Air Negotiations (1979–1990). He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree (cum laude) from  [[Ateneo de Manila University]] (1965), a Bachelor of Laws degree ([[cum laude]] and [[salutatorian]]) from the same University in 1969 and a Master of Laws degree from the [[Harvard Law School]]. He was also a past president of the [[Manila Overseas Press Club]].

When President [[Joseph Estrada]] assumed power, Puno was appointed [[Press Secretary]] and ran unsuccessfully for a Senate seat in the 2001 senatorial race.  After this debacle, he returned to the media profession and re-assumed his old position at ABS-CBN, but lost it anew after he chose to anchor the network's reformatted national late-night newscast ''[[ABS-CBN Insider|Insider]]'' with [[Ces Oreña-Drilon]] in 2004.  However, due to low ratings, the said newscast was canceled and was replaced by ''[[Bandila (TV program)|Bandila]]'' which marked the return of [[Korina Sanchez]] to the local newscasting scene.  (Drilon then joined ''Bandila''.) He then ran unsuccessfully for the lone congressional seat of [[Muntinlupa City]] in 2007 against Congressman [[Ruffy Biazon]]. With Biazon term-limited (he ran and lost for a Senate seat), Puno again contested the seat in the [[Philippine House of Representatives elections in Metro Manila, 2010#Muntinlupa|2010 election]] against Biazon's father, Senator [[Rodolfo Biazon]], but lost garnering 27% of the vote against Biazon's 46%.

On February 2011, he joined [[AksyonTV]] and started hosting a weekly political commentary program called ''[[De Kalibre]]''.

He is the recipient of various awards in the fields of media and law: the 1985 TOYM awardee for Media and a KBP Golden Dove awardee (Best Male Host for Magazine Show, 1999; Ka Doroy Achievement Award, 1993 and the Best Public Affairs Show, 1990).

His program, ''Viewpoint'', won the Catholic Mass Media Awards as Best Public Affairs Programs for three consecutive years (1984, 1985 and 1986) and was elevated to the Hall of Fame. His television shows (''[[Dong Puno Live]]'', ''Viewpoint'' &amp; ''Focus'')
have also received recognition from the '''Gawad CCP Para sa Telebisyon''' and Star Awards for Television.

On March 2014, he joined [[DWIZ]] and started hosting a public affairs radio program called "Karambola".

==Personal life==
A son of former Minister of Justice under the Marcos administration, Ricardo C. Puno, Sr. and a brother of former Department of Interior and Local Government Secretary, Ronaldo "Ronnie" Puno, he is married to Clodelsa del Castillo and they have two biological sons Ricky (born 1969) and Donnie (born 1970), and nephew Randolf del Castillo (born 1991) lives with him, and three grandchildren Tana (born 1990), Sandro (born 1996) and Santi (born 2002).

He is currently the president of [[Guagua National Colleges]] in [[Guagua, Pampanga]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2014">A '''dummy purchaser''' is an [[Agent (law)|agent]] who buys property on behalf of another, usually to conceal the true purpose of the acquisition. For instance, a shopping mall developer may hire a dummy buyer to purchase the needed vacant lots. Disclosing the principal's identity might prompt the landowners to hold out for a higher price; hence the need for secrecy. It has been hypothesized that dummy buyers could help private sector developers obtain the land needed for highway construction without the need for [[eminent domain]] invocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Street Smart: Competition, Entrepreneurship, and the Future of Roads|chapter=Do Holdout Problems Justify Compulsory Right-of-Way Purchase|pages=48|author=Benson, Bruce L.|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A principal in such a relationship may be a [[partially disclosed principal]] (i.e. the agent informs the seller that he is buying on behalf of someone, but does not reveal that person's identity) or a completely [[undisclosed principal]] (i.e. the agent does not reveal that he is acting on anyone's behalf). A dummy purchaser is also sometimes called a [[Straw man (law)|straw man]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rickseiler.com/SeilerSchoolOfRealEstate/IndependentStudy/Glossary.htm Glossary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dummying==
In [[Australia]], during periods of conversion of Government land to freehold or leasehold, the practice (also called "dummyism") of wealthy [[Squatting (pastoral)|squatters]] employing someone who qualifies as a "[[Squatting (pastoral)#Legislation to allow selection|free selector]]" to acquire land that they themselves would not have access to.&lt;ref&gt;Ramson, W. S. (ed.) ''The Australian National Dictionary'' Oxford University Press, Melbourne 1988 p.225 {{ISBN|0 19 554736 5}} &lt;/ref&gt; This practice was particularly useful in acquiring or denying to others access to watercourses and thoroughfares.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6180">'''Fred Anderson''' (died March 1997) was a [[Sacramento, California]] based businessman and sports entrepreneur.

==Business and philanthropy==

Anderson's wealth was self-made. In February 1953, he and his wife Patricia founded '''Anderson Lumber.''' It would become [[Pacific Coast Building Products]] (PCBP) and eventually expanded to include the manufacturing, contracting, and distributing of building materials. As the company grew, the Andersons undertook philanthropic efforts, sponsoring a wide variety of health and youth initiatives and giving millions to local organizations. An $18 million gift to establish the Anderson Lucchetti Women's and Children's Center at the [[Sutter Medical Center]] ranks as the single largest gift from an individual family to any capital project in the Sacramento area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sutterhealth.org/about/news/news08_womensctr.html |title=Sutter Medical Center, Sacramento Breaks Ground on Women’s and Children’s Center |publisher=Sutter Medical Center, Sacramento |date=October 13, 2008 |accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A passion for sports emerged with the sponsorship of a local air show and golfing events.

==Sports ownership==
: ''See also [[Canadian Football League in the United States]]''
In 1991 and 1992 Anderson was owner of the [[Sacramento Surge]] of the [[World League of American Football]]. The Surge were victors in the [[World Bowl '92|second edition of the World Bowl]], defeating the [[Orlando Thunder]] 21-17 in [[Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/europa/history/1992 |title=Archer on target |publisher= National Football League |accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The league went dormant after these two seasons but Anderson was able to repurpose his team as a [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) expansion club, now renamed the [[Sacramento Gold Miners]].  They were the first [[Canadian Football League in the United States|American-based team in the CFL]].  The team had two modestly successful years in Sacramento with attendance in the 15,000 range but faced issues with the bare bones [[Hornet Stadium (Sacramento)|Hornet Stadium]] and relative isolation as other American teams came and went. When these problems proved insurmountable, Anderson moved the team to [[San Antonio]] for the 1995 season where they were renamed the [[San Antonio Texans|Texans]]. As the Texans, they made the playoffs for the first time.

By the end of the 1995 season the other American owners had either folded or, in the case of Baltimore, moved. By his own estimate, Anderson had lost $6 million during the season—far too much to make it worth the effort to go it alone.&lt;ref name=Ralph&gt;Ralph, Dan. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2202&amp;dat=19960126&amp;id=iBUmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2P0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4313,1970578 Speros reportedly close to pulling Stallions]. [[Associated Press]], 1996-01-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson decided to fold his own franchise, ending the CFL's four-year effort to gain a footing in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1891&amp;dat=19960204&amp;id=GrgfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=q9cEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3044,359055 CFL's American experiment ends as Stallions move north to Montreal]. [[Associated Press]], 1996-02-03.&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, Anderson is the only American owner to have persisted with the expansion effort from beginning to end. In his chronicle of the CFL American expansion, Willes describes Anderson as a rock and suggests the expansion might have worked had the league found more owners like him. He was "one of the real heroes of this forgotten era."&lt;ref&gt;Willes (2013). pg. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although football was his main passion, Anderson's holdings were varied. He held a minority stake in the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] and [[Sacramento Kings]]. Also in the mid-1990s, Anderson was owner of the [[Modesto A's]], a farm team of the [[Oakland Athletics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mychf.org/go/hall-of-fame/past-honorees/anderson-fred1/ |title=Hall of Fame: Past Honorees: Fred Anderson |website=California Homebuilding Association |access-date=26 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203114719/http://www.mychf.org/go/hall-of-fame/past-honorees/anderson-fred1/ |archive-date=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is reported to have planned to move the team to Sacramento, but this did not come to fruition.

Anderson died in March 1997. His wife Patricia died in 2008.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11336">[[File:The Blue Riband Trophy of 1935.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The Blue Riband – Hales Trophy of 1935]]
The '''Hales Trophy''' (officially the '''North Atlantic Blue Riband Challenge Trophy'''&lt;ref name=kludas&gt;{{cite book | last=Kludas | first=Arnold | title=Record breakers of the North Atlantic, Blue Riband Liners 1838–1952 | location=London  | publisher=Chatham  | year=2000 | isbn=1-86176-141-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an award for the fastest Atlantic crossing by a commercial vessel. It was created in 1935 by [[Harold Hales|Harold K. Hales]] a British politician and owner of Hales Brothers shipping company, donated the trophy.&lt;ref name="Steve Birks"&gt;{{cite web | author=Steve Birks | title=Hanley – Stoke-on-Trent Districts | url=http://www.thepotteries.org/location/districts/hanley3.htm | work=The Potteries | date=22 January 2008 | accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to be a permanent, tangible expression of the [[Blue Riband]], the unofficial accolade then given for this feat. Hales also wished to formalize the rules regarding the contest, which up to then had no official form, though they were, by tradition, widely recognized. The rules for the Hales Trophy were different from the traditional rules for the Blue Riband (for example, the Hales Trophy was originally only awarded for westbound records&lt;ref name="Kludas p17"&gt;Kludas p17&lt;/ref&gt;) and changed several times thereafter. It was awarded to just three Blue Riband holders during the express liner era; to the Italian liner ''[[SS Rex|Rex]]'' in 1935, the French ''[[SS Normandie|Normandie]]'' in 1936, and the American ''[[SS United States|United States]]'' in 1952. Cunard's ''[[RMS Queen Mary|Queen Mary]]'', Blue Riband holder in 1936 and again from 1938 until 1952, did not receive the award. Following the retirement of ''United States'' in 1969 the award languished, until revived in 1990 for the [[Incat]] passenger/car ferry ''[[Hoverspeed Great Britain]]'' when she established a new speed record for a commercial vessel on her eastbound delivery voyage without passengers that year.&lt;ref name=times7&gt;{{cite news | author=Barbara Lloyd | title=YACHTING: Suit May Be Filed Over Hales Trophy | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/15/sports/yachting-suit-may-be-filed-over-hales-trophy.html | work=The New York Times | date=15 July 1990 | accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trophy has been won twice since then, each time by an Incat vessel.

==The trophy==
In 1935, [[Harold Hales|Harold K. Hales]] (1868–1942), a member of the UK Parliament and owner of a shipping company, commissioned a Sheffield goldsmith to produce a large trophy to be presented to the fastest ship crossing the Atlantic.&lt;ref name=times5&gt;{{cite book | last = NY Times | first = | title = British writer-merchant missing | date = 10 November 1942 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The four-foot-tall, nearly 100-pound Hales Trophy is made of solid silver and heavy gilt fashioned with a globe resting on two winged figures of Victory standing on a base of carved green onyx, with an enamelled blue ribbon encircling the middle, and decorated with models of [[galleons]], modern ocean liners and statues of [[Neptune]] and [[Amphitrite]], god and goddess of the sea. The trophy is surmounted by a figure depicting speed pushing a three-stacked liner against a figure symbolizing the forces of the Atlantic, which is represented in blue enamel with the traditional ocean liner route indicated by a red enamelled line.&lt;ref name="Steve Birks"/&gt;

==History==
The rules for the trophy did not correspond to the traditional rules for the Blue Riband, in that the trophy was to be awarded only to surface passenger ship achieving the fastest speed in the westbound direction.&lt;ref name="Kludas p17"/&gt; Other rule changes further complicated the situation. For example, before the trophy was finished, Hales made arrangements to present the trophy to the ''Rex''. In the meantime, ''Normandie'' took the record and Hales changed the rules so that any new claimant must wait three months to give the current holder a chance to beat the new record.&lt;ref name=timemagazine&gt;{{cite book | last = Time Magazine | first = | title = Card's Cup | date = 29 July 1935 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1935, the trophy was presented to the ''Rex'',&lt;ref name=times2&gt;{{cite book | last = NY Times | first = | title = Rex gets blue riband | date = 21 August 1935 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then transferred to the ''Normandie'' two months later.&lt;ref name=times3&gt;{{cite book | last = NY Times | first = | title = Ocean speed trophy goes to Normandie | date = 24 October 1935 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cunard White Star's ''Queen Mary'' was the next winner, but Cunard White Star refused to accept the trophy. The Queen's captain explained that, "We don't believe in racing on the Atlantic, or in blue ribands, or trophies and the like."&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite book | last = NY Times | first = | title = Queen Mary Scorns Actual Pennant | date = 26 August 1936 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hales again changed the rules so that the trophy could only be won by a "non-British ship".&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;

Hales died in 1942 and the location of the trophy was unknown when the United States Lines (USL) started planning the maiden voyage of its new record breaker, the ''United States''. The trophy was found at the Sheffield goldsmith where it had been originally made.&lt;ref name=dailynews&gt;{{cite book | last = N Y Daily News | first = | title = Award makes splash at Maritime Museum | date = 20 November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1952, USL accepted the trophy at a ceremony attended by 400 guests.&lt;ref name=times6&gt;{{cite book | last = NY Times | first = | title = Ship speed trophy is presented here | date = 13 November 1952 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was displayed in USL's New York City headquarters until after the ''United States'' was taken out of service in 1969. Ten years later, the trophy was transferred to the [[United States Merchant Marine Academy|U.S. Merchant Marine Academy's]] museum as a relic.&lt;ref name=dailynews /&gt;

In 1986, [[Richard Branson]] was successful in setting a new eastbound transatlantic speed record in the powerboat ''Challenger II''. He was not awarded the Hales trophy because his boat was not a commercial vessel. In 1990, the {{convert|242|ft|m|adj=on}} catamaran passenger/car ferry ''[[Hoverspeed Great Britain]]'' was scheduled to take a delivery voyage from her Australian builders to begin cross channel operations. Her owners confirmed with the Hales trophy trustees in the UK that their vessel would be eligible for the trophy if they beat the ''United States'' record, even though the ship would not actually carry passengers on the trip. The trustees ruled that the ship still met the criteria. After ''Hoverspeed Great Britain's'' successful voyage, the Maritime Museum considered challenging the decision on the grounds that Hales donated the award for ships providing Atlantic passenger service,&lt;ref name=times7 /&gt; but decided not to because of the cost of legal fees. The trophy case at the academy remained empty for the next eight years until [[Carnival Cruise Lines]] loaned the museum a replica of the trophy.&lt;ref name=dailynews /&gt;  In 1992, the Italian powerboat ''[[Destriero]]'' made a voyage at {{convert|53.09|kn|km/h}}, breaking ''Challenger II's'' record, though she was not awarded the Hales Trophy either.  In June 1998 the trophy was won by ''[[Catalonia (ship)|Catalonia]]'', delivery voyage (without passengers) at {{convert|38.9|kn|km/h}}, followed a month later by the current holder of the Hales Trophy, the catamaran ''Cat-Link V'' (now ''[[Fjord Cat]]'') for a 1998 delivery voyage at {{convert|41.3|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=dailynews /&gt;

INCAT, the builders of the last three winners of the Hales Trophy have possession of the trophy at their shipyard offices in [[Hobart, Tasmania]].   The formal records of the Hales Trophy Trustees are now lodged with Lloyds Register in London.  Anyone wishing to access the formal records should contact Lloyds Register regarding obtaining permission to inspect the Hales Trophy Trust records.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marinelink.com/news/decades-record-world334661.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intaglio''' is the annual international Business school summit hosted by [[Indian Institute of Management Calcutta]]. The flagship event of IIM-C, it was started in 1989 as the National Business School Meet (NBSM).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ireference.ca/search/Indian%20Institute%20of%20Management%20Calcutta/&lt;/ref&gt; Intaglio, traditionally held over a 3-day weekend in January, serves as a platform facilitating the interaction of eminent personalities from the industry, academia, media and government, holding conferences, workshops and seminars by experts in different fields on a wide range of topics.

Intaglio in 2007 became the first event of its kind in India to achieve the ISO 9001:2000 certification from the International Organization for Standardization.&lt;ref name="official-website"&gt;http://www.iimc-intaglio.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Intaglio got the distinction of being the '''first carbon-neutral B-school event''' in India. This is being done through a number of environment-friendly measures such as using notepads and bags made of recycled paper and encouraging the use of social networking sites, emails and SMSes to publicise the event.&lt;ref&gt;http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/services/education/IIM-C-walks-the-extra-green-mile/articleshow/5414503.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting the Golden Jubilee of IIM Calcutta, the theme of Intaglio 2011 was "''Perspectives at 50... Genesis of a new tomorrow''".

==History==
The original version of Intaglio – The National Business School Meet – was started by the 25th Batch of IIM Calcutta in the year 1989. The meet consisted of a myriad of competitions viz. Strategy building competitions, presentation competition "''Shastrarth''" and the like.

The meet was rechristened "Intaglio" in the January 2002 edition.

Intaglio 2008-09 was held on the IIM Calcutta campus from 8 – 11 January 2009, this edition saw over 15,000 participants from more than 60 countries, and participation from 190 companies,  The total prize money for winners across events amounted to INR 10 Lakhs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiaprwire.com/pressrelease/education/2008092213378.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year, Intaglio organizes "Reverberations", a series of lectures by management and business leaders.

==Showcase Events==

=== Olympus ===
Olympus is the flagship event of Intaglio. It aims at identifying the most promising future leader amongst the students of the 6 IIMs (Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Calcutta, Indore, Kozhikode, Lucknow) and select international B-schools.

In 2009, the event was won by Ms. Joo Yi from CEIBS, China.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ceibs.edu/media/archive/36032.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Repeating the institute's success, the following 2010 edition of the event was won by Mr. John Timms from CEIBS, China.

===Wizards of Biz===
This boardroom challenge aims at testing the all round business acumen of the participants. This game requires the participants to allocate resources, battle uncertainty and tackle competition by making the most of the limited resources available. This is the first competition in the country to have in-house real time business simulation software. Prelims give the candidates a feel of running a full-scale business in a completely dynamic environment.
Those who manage to clear the preliminary rounds are further put to test in the on-campus finals involving multiple rounds of business challenges where decision making and strategic thinking are prerequisites to survive. The final round is designed to match a high pressure boardroom battle where the participants don the hats of the top level management of a firm for the coveted title.

===Chanakya===
This event gives participants the opportunity to develop a wide range of policies and test them against the wits of equally capable competition and an esteemed panel.

===Great Innovation Challenge===
The Great Innovation Challenge tests the participants on creativity and innovation, qualities that differentiate an outstanding manager from a good one.
The event gives participants the opportunity to work on live problems faced by Intaglio’s knowledge partners in a real life environment. An onsite field visit, interaction with company executives and thorough mentoring by the festival’s consulting partners helps participants get to the crux of the problem at hand and devise innovative solutions.

===Consulting Knights===
Intaglio’s Showcase event, Consulting Knights, challenges the participants with a comprehensive case developed with the fest’s corporate partners that tests their ability to understand the heart of the problem and search for answers. Traditionally, one of the most prestigious events at Intaglio, Consulting knights has seen participation from all over the world including the likes of NUS, Wharton etc.

==Social Initiatives==
Intaglio undertakes several social initiatives. In Intaglio 2008-09 started by holding team-building, creativity and public speaking workshops in Kendriya Vidyalaya School; this was a year-long initiative taken by the Intaglio team.

With 2009 being the year of general elections, Intaglio partnered ‘Jaago Re’ in spreading awareness about the elections to the youth of India. Furthermore, live events like inviting NGOs working with local artisans/children to exhibit their handiworks and screening daily social documentaries, were conducted.

For the online audiences, the stories and challenges Intaglio's partner NGOs faced were showcased. In the 2010-11 edition, these partnerships will be developed further to make them a permanent feature of Intaglio. Intaglio 2010-11 will feature events in collaboration with [http://iimc-intaglio.com/intaglio-cares/antyodaya/ Antyodaya] and [http://iimc-intaglio.com/intaglio-cares/sunehra-kal/ Sunehra Kal], for which Intaglio has set up a corpus of INR 400,000 to support education and women empowerment.

==Student Leadership Programme==
With participation from more than 160 national &amp; international business schools and over 175 corporates, SLP would provide students a platform to interact with some of the brightest minds from across a range of domains.

[[File:Wybrand Hendriks - family Enschedé.jpg|thumb|Johannes Enschedé III with his parents Johanna Swaving and Johannes Enschedé jr.]]
'''Johannes Enschedé III''' (7 March 1785 in [[Haarlem]] &amp;ndash; 8 October 1866 in Haarlem)&lt;ref name="NNBW"&gt;P.C. Molhuysen en P.J. Blok (red.), [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/molh003nieu04_01/molh003nieu04_01_0893.php Nieuw Nederlandsch biografisch woordenboek. Deel 1] (Dutch) Johannes Enschedé (3)&lt;/ref&gt; was a Haarlem newspaper editor and printer.

==Biography==
He was the great grandson of the founder of the [[Joh. Enschedé]] company, and the oldest son of [[Johannes Enschedé Jr.]]. Like his father and grandfather before him, he was a member of the ''[[Dutch Society of Science]]'' and the ''[[Teylers Second Society]]''. He studied law in Leiden and returned to become partner in the [[Joh. Enschedé|family company]] at the young age of 20, where he became editor of the [[Opregte Haarlemsche Courant]]. On 25 March 1810 he married Catharina Hillegonda van Walré, (Haarlem, 16 August 1791 - Haarlem, 18 December 1845) the daughter of [[Jan van Walré]] and Maria Kops. From this marriage was born on 20 November 1811 a son, [[Johannes Enschedé IV]].

Like his father, he was a regent of the [[St. Elisabeth Gasthuis, Haarlem|St. Elizabeth's-Gasthuis]] and the [[Hofje van Staats]] en Noblet. Johannes Enschedé III was judge of instruction, Auditor soldier, a member of the Municipal Council and member of the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)]].

Enschedé III continued his father's collection of art and books, but after his death these were auctioned by his heirs, much to the disappointment of his nephew [[Adriaan Justus Enschedé]], who bought as much of the collection as he could.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7807">The [[anti-trust]] [[class-action]] lawsuit '''Jung v. AAMC ''' alleged collusion to prevent American [[medical resident|trainee doctors]] from negotiating for better working conditions. The [[Medical resident work hours|working conditions of medical residents]] often involved 80- to 100-hour workweeks.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/HEALTH/06/15/residents.hours/index.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527031017/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/HEALTH/06/15/residents.hours/index.html |date=May 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The suit had some early success, but failed when the U.S. Congress enacted a statute exempting matching programs from federal anti-trust laws.

==Background==
Every year, American medical students and graduates participate along with foreign-trained physicians in a national matching plan to obtain a position in an accredited resident training program.  Applicants and programs that participate in the matching plan submit rank-ordered preferences for training.  A mathematical algorithm is used to place an applicant in a preferred program that also prefers the applicant.

The [[National Resident Matching Program]], also referred to as "The Match", is one of several national matching plans in the United States.

==Lawsuit==
The suit was launched on behalf of all current and former medical residents against defendants that oversaw and participated in the matching process as well as institutions that employed medical residents.&lt;ref name=Weinmayer&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1001/virtualmentor.2015.17.2.hlaw1-1502| volume = 17| issue = 2| pages = 149| last = Weinmeyer| first = Richard| title = Challenging the Medical Residency Matching System through Antitrust Litigation| journal = Virtual Mentor| accessdate = 2016-05-06| date = 2015-02-01| url = http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2015/02/hlaw1-1502.html| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20150205045900/http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2015/02/hlaw1-1502.html| archivedate = 2015-02-05| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three physicians who launched the suit alleged that the [[National Resident Matching Program|NRMP Matching program]] was an [[anti-competitive practice]], claiming that:

* fourth-year medical students were required to apply to the Match, and had no opportunity to negotiate their terms of employment with teaching hospitals ''(if they did not apply, they could not enter a residency accredited by the [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education|ACGME]], and hence could not become certified as physicians by an [[American Board of Medical Specialties|ABMS-recognized board]], meaning that they cannot practice their specialty)''
* the defendants limited the number of residency positions available in U.S. teaching hospitals 
* the defendants placed "substantial obstacles to the ability of a resident to transfer employment from one employer to another during the period of a residency"
* the ACGME encouraged or required participation in the Match as a condition of accreditation for institutions offering residencies.
* the defendants shared information on conditions of employment, and reviewed them in order to keep salaries low.&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;[http://www.law.uh.edu/healthlaw/perspectives/%28MT%29Jung3.pdf Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges: A Special Interest Victory], Miranda W. Turner, University of Houston Law Center,November 2, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The defendants challenged the admissibility of the lawsuit with several arguments, including a lack of jurisdiction &lt;ref name=opinion&gt;[http://www.leagle.com/decision/2004419300FSupp2d119_1407/JUNG%20v.%20ASSOCIATION%20OF%20AMERICAN%20MEDICAL%20COLLEGES]&lt;/ref&gt; and that the plaintiffs had not been injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/S1546-1440(03)00007-3| issn = 1546-1440| volume = 1| issue = 1| pages = 40–47| last = Bierig| first = Jack R.| title = Jung v. Association Of American Medical Colleges: the lawsuit challenging our system of graduate medical education| journal = Journal of the American College of Radiology| accessdate = 2016-05-06| date = 2004-01-01| url = http://www.jacr.org/article/S1546144003000073/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court dismissed the cases against two defendants for lack of jurisdiction, and three because the claims of conspiracy did not involve them. The federal district court did allow the case to proceed against 17 defendants, ruling:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... the Court finds that plaintiffs adequately have alleged a common agreement to displace competition in the recruitment, hiring, employment and compensation of resident physicians and to impose a scheme of restraints that has the purpose and effect of fixing, artificially depressing, standardizing and stabilizing resident physician compensation and other terms of employment among certain defendants.&lt;ref name=opinion/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legislative change==
The lawsuit ended when Congress enacted legislation as a [[Rider (legislation)|rider]] added to an unrelated bill (the [[Pension Funding Equity Act of 2004|Pension Funding Equity Act]]) that exempted participation in a matching program from federal anti-trust laws.

The rider was called "Confirmation of antitrust status of graduate medical resident matching programs" (Section 207). Neither the rider nor the then-ongoing Jung v. AAMC case was debated. The rider was lobbied for by the [[Association of American Medical Colleges|AAMC]] and the [[American Hospital Association]], and sponsored by Senator [[Judd Gregg]] of New Hampshire and Senator [[Edward Kennedy]] of Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=Weinmayer/&gt; Senators [[Herb Kohl|Kohl]], [[Russ Feingold|Feingold]], and [[Jeff Bingaman|Bingaman]] publicly criticized the way in which the rider was added.&lt;ref name=Turner/&gt;

The rider praised the 50-year-old Matching Program, saying that "[a]ntitrust lawsuits challenging the matching process, regardless of their merit or lack thereof, have the potential to undermine this highly efficient, pro-competitive, and long standing process" and  "would divert the scarce resources of our country's teaching hospitals and medical schools from their crucial missions of patient care, physician training, and medical research"&lt;ref name=Weinmayer/&gt;

The bill containing the rider was signed into law by President [[George W. Bush]] on April 8, 2004.&lt;ref name=Weinmayer/&gt;

The new law prohibited  "using allegations related to the Match to support any antitrust claim",&lt;ref name=Weinmayer/&gt; retroactively.&lt;ref name=Turner/&gt; The court ruled that the plaintiff's case was dependent on allegations related to the Match.&lt;ref name=Weinmayer/&gt; The case was dismissed under the authority of the new law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/14/us/antitrust-lawsuit-over-medical-residency-system-is-dismissed.html |first=S. |last=Robinson |title=Antitrust Lawsuit Over Medical Residency System Is Dismissed |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=August 14, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5172">'''Livingston Ludlow Biddle Jr.''' (May 26, 1918 – May 3, 2002) was an [[United States|American]] author and promoter of funding of the arts, from a wealthy [[Pennsylvania]] family.

==Life==
Livingston Ludlow Biddle was born in [[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania]], on May 26, 1918.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news |author= David Stout |title=Livingston Biddle Jr., 83, Ex-Chairman of Arts Endowment | date= May 4, 2002 |url =https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/04/us/livingston-biddle-jr-83-ex-chairman-of-arts-endowment.html | newspaper= The New York Times | pages =A11 |accessdate= March 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
His mother was Euginie Carter Law, and father was Livingston Ludlow Biddle (1877–1959) of the [[Biddle family]] of Philadelphia, who published poems such as "The Understanding Hills".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Understanding Hills, and other Poems |author= Livingston Ludlow Biddle |publisher= Dodd, Mead and Company |year= 1916 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=da8VAAAAYAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ancestors included grandfather Edward Biddle (1851–1933) who married Emily Taylor Drexel (1851–1883), daughter of [[Anthony Joseph Drexel]], and great grandfather [[Nicholas Biddle (banker)|Nicholas Biddle]] (1786–1844), linking to two major banking families.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;
He attended the Montgomery School in [[Chester Springs, Pennsylvania]] and [[St. George's School, Newport|St. George's School]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]].
He graduated from [[Princeton University]] in 1940, majoring in English and French. He was also on the tennis team.&lt;ref name="prince"&gt;{{cite news |title= Memorial: Livingston L. Biddle '40 |work= Princeton Alumni Weekly |date= October 9, 2002 |url= https://paw.princeton.edu/memorial/livingston-l-biddle-40 |accessdate= December 22, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went to work as a reporter for the ''[[Philadelphia Bulletin]]'' newspaper until [[World War II]] broke out. Several of his cousins and uncles were military leaders, but his poor eyesight limited his service to driving ambulances in Africa. After the war he wrote short stories and four novels set in Philadelphia.
From 1963 to 1965 he worked as staff assistant to Senator [[Claiborne Pell]], who was a classmate from both  St. George's and Princeton. He helped draft the legislation creating the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] (NEA) and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].
He was appointed by President [[Jimmy Carter]]  as the third chairman of the NEA in 1977 and served from 1981.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

Biddle married Cordelia Fenton who died in 1972.
In 1973 he married artist Catharina Baart (1912–2005), who had been born in the [[Netherlands]]. She taught art in the [[Washington, DC]] public schools from the 1950s to 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Catharina Baart Biddle: Artist, Teacher |newspaper= The Washington Post |date= February 26, 2005 |url= http://catharinabaartbiddle.com/index.htm |accessdate= March 16, 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110201052623/http://catharinabaartbiddle.com/index.htm |archivedate= February 1, 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died  May 3, 2002.&lt;ref name="prince"/&gt;

'''Lucas Fotsing Takou''' (born 1980), known as '''LucFosther Diop''', is a [[List of Cameroonian artists|Cameroonian artist]], filmmaker, actor and entrepreneur. As an artist, he is best known for his drawings, collages, performances and films exploring the ongoing repercussions of the western [[neocolonialism]] and [[imperialism]] within the contemporary context of [[globalisation]].

[[File:LucFosther Diop.jpg|thumb|LucFosther Diop]]

==Early life and career==
LucFosther Diop was born in 1980 in Douala. After spending his young age having a very difficult relationship specially with his father, at the age of 17, he moved from the family house in Douala to his uncle's place in [[Bafoussam]] ([[West Region (Cameroon)|the West Region of Cameroon]]) where he got his diploma of secondary studies in 2000. Then, went to study [[fine arts]] in [[Yaoundé]] where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree at the [[University of Yaoundé|Yaounde 1 University]] in 2003. After obtaining a grant from the [[Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] in 2009, he studied for two years at the [[Rijksakademie|Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten]] in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

He is the first artist to benefit from a residency grant at [[ArtBakery]] (Bonendale, Douala, [[Cameroon]]) in 2003, at the [[MTN Group|MTN]] Cameroon Foundation (Douala) in 2007 and a digital arts research and production Unesco-Aschberg award for [[French Africa]] in 2013.

Diop exhibited his work during the 3rd OK Video International Festival, [[National Gallery of Indonesia]] in [[Jakarta]] (2007), World One Minute Video, [[Today Art Museum]] in Beijing (2008), 2nd Thessaloniki Biennial (2009), International Symposium on Electronic Arts ([[ISEA International|ISEA]]) 2010, [[PHotoEspaña]] (2011), the [[Havana biennial]] (2012) and the 18th International Contemporary Art Festival SESC_[[Videobrasil]], 2013.

==Work==
LucFosther Diop started making drawing on the free spaces of his books at the primary school like a hobby. His difficult familial atmosphere develops in him a strong solitary attitudes. He did not really got the feeling to play like other kids and was spending his time on trying to reproduce the images around. After he got the financial support of the Director of his secondary school in 1993, he bought colours, brushes and other tools for beginners. Then started making portraits, flowers and landscape in a very realistic ways. LucFosther represented his school and university many times in artistic competitions between 1995 and 2003. He really started getting in touch with film tools at the [[ArtBakery]] where he learned a lot about [[contemporary art]] and began to develop his process as an artist. Today, favouring a poetic point of view, LucFosther Diop is developing a research project on [[neocolonialism]] and [[imperialism]], and their social, political, cultural, historical, geographic, economic and urban influences and repercussions. This research is essentially based on digital and media experimentation through photography, collage, drawing, video, ephemeral interventions, video performances, recycled documents and files found on the web and diversion of their content's meaning. He is calling these works "virtual made" or &lt;nowiki&gt;''neo ready made''&lt;/nowiki&gt; and really enjoy the works by [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Alfredo Jaar]], [[Olga Kisseleva]], [[William Kentridge]], [[Mona Hatoum]], [[Pascal Kenfack]], [[Goddy Leye]], [[Bob Marley]], [[Fela Kuti]], [[Youssou Ndour]] and [[Richard Bona]]. LucFosther Diop is one of the artists presented in the documentary '’OF AMSTERDAM'’ directed by Catarina Neves Ricci in 2012.

'''Mary Lillian Duke Biddle''' (November 16, 1887 &amp;ndash; June 14, 1960) was an [[United States of America|American]] philanthropist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.duke.edu/uarchives/history/duke_wash-genea.html "A Washington Duke genealogy as it pertains to Duke University"] - Duke University Libraries&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
She was born as '''Mary Lillian Duke''' on November 16, 1887 to [[Benjamin Newton Duke]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]]. She attended Durham's Trinity College, the institutional predecessor of [[Duke University]], which was named in honor of her family. She graduated in 1907 with a degree in [[English studies|English]].

She was a great enthusiast for the arts and traveled frequently with her family to New York City for the theater and opera, later becoming an accomplished singer and musician.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncarts.edu/pressreleases/Releases2002/February2002/mdb-grant.htm "North Carolina School of the Arts Receives $100,000 Grant from the Mary Duke Biddle Foundation to Endow Opera Scholarship"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906221747/http://www.ncarts.edu/pressreleases/Releases2002/February2002/mdb-grant.htm |date=2006-09-06 }} - Press release, February 4, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1918, she was given her father's brick-and-limestone [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] townhouse on [[Fifth Avenue]] at 82nd Street. It was built in 1901 and is now known as the [[Benjamin N. Duke House]].&lt;ref&gt;The house was one of a group of four built by the speculative builders William and Thomas Hall to designs by [[Alexander McMillan Welch]] of Welch, Smith and Provot; 1009 Fifth Avenue was purchased by Mr Biddle. It was granted landmark status in 1974, and was sold in 2005 by her daughter, [[Mary Duke Biddle Trent Semans]]; the eventual purchaser, after a deal had been concluded with [[Tamir Sapir]], was [[Carlos Slim Helú]], Mexican billionaire ([http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/31/big-deal-sale-of-duke-mansion-brings-a-lawsuit/#more-261619 "Sale of Duke Mansion Brings a Lawsuit", ''New York Times''] 20 December 2010, accessed 12 January 2911.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of only nine surviving mansions on Fifth Avenue.
[[File:Mary Duke Biddle in 1916.jpg|thumb|Mary Duke Biddle in 1916]]

==Marriage and later life==
Her marriage to [[Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle, Jr.]] in 1915 ended in divorce in 1931. Their children were [[Mary Duke Biddle Trent Semans]] and Nicholas Benjamin Duke Biddle.

She and her husband owned an estate, "Linden Court", in [[Tarrytown, New York]], bought from the William R. Harris family in 1921. It still stands today as the Tarrytown House Estate and Conference Center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tarrytownhouseestate.com/about-property-history.php Tarrytown House property history]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hudsonriver.com/halfmoonpress/stories/1103dolc.htm "History Center at Dolce Tarrytown House"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820192917/http://www.hudsonriver.com/halfmoonpress/stories/1103dolc.htm |date=2008-08-20 }}, ''Half Moon Press'' newspaper, November, 2003 issue&lt;/ref&gt;

She established the Mary Duke Biddle Foundation in 1956. Since then, the foundation has donated more than $28 million in grants to non-profit organizations.

The [[Mary Duke Biddle Estate]] at [[Durham, North Carolina]], was her home from 1935 until her death in 1960. It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2013.&lt;ref name = nrhpinv&gt;{{Cite web | author = Betsy Gohdes-Baten | title=Mary Duke Biddle Estate| work = National Register of Historic Places - Nomination and Inventory | date = February 2012| url = http://www.hpo.ncdcr.gov/nr/DH0846.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = North Carolina State Historic Preservation Office | accessdate = 2014-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="nps"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/20130118.htm|title=National Register of Historic Places Listings|date=2013-01-18|work=Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 1/07/13 through 1/11/13|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
===Birth and Youth in Serbia===

Panić was born on 20 December 1929 in [[Belgrade]], Kingdom of Yugoslavia (present-day Serbia) into a middle-class family. His father, a prominent government official, died when he was three years old, leaving Panić’s mother to raise him and his sisters. Faced with a growing shortage of goods due to the Nazi occupation of Belgrade, Panić started a working vegetable farm to support his family and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Can-Do Entrepreneur Will Tackle Balkan War :  Belgrade: Southland's Milan Panic may have taken on his toughest task in agreeing to be Yugoslav premier.|url = http://articles.latimes.com/1992-07-03/news/mn-1518_1_milan-panic|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|date = 1992-07-03|access-date = 2016-02-22|issn = 0458-3035|language = en-US|first = GREGORY|last = CROUCH}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a young student, he gravitated toward geography and chemistry, assembling a small laboratory in his room to conduct experiments.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Prime Minister for Peace: My Struggle for Serbian Democracy|last = Murphy|first = Kevin|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year = 2015|isbn = |location = London, UK|pages = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, Panić, then only 14 years old, joined [[Josip Tito|Josip "Marshal" Tito]]’s partisan resistance to fight the growing Nazi influence in Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  After returning from military service, he resumed his secondary studies in biochemistry at the Belgrade Faculty of Technology.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Panić enrolled as a medical student at the [[University of Belgrade]] medical school before transferring to the biochemistry degree program.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

===Cycling career===

Panić was an avid cyclist from his youth into early adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Prime Minister for Peace: My Struggle for Serbian Democracy|last = Murphy|first = Kevin|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year = 2015|isbn = |location = London, UK|pages = 12–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of his cycling career, he eventually rose to become a Yugoslavian national champion&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; and competed at the international level on prominent teams including the Yugoslavian national and Olympic teams.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How Valeant became Canada's hottest stock|url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/how-valeant-became-canadas-hottest-stock/article8889241/?page=all|website = The Globe and Mail|access-date = 2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; While traveling to an international cycling tournament in the Netherlands in 1955, Panić defected to Austria with his wife Jelica Panić (née Narandzic.)&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

===Defection and Refugee Status===
After defecting to Austria in August 1955, Panić and his wife applied for asylum in Germany and moved to a West German refugee camp. While in Germany, he enrolled in the PhD program at the [[Heidelberg University|University of Heidelberg]]&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; and worked as a furniture mover.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = An extraordinary American life - Chapman University, Gov.

Panić worked in labs at Keiser Steel and the University of Southern California,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; where he also studied biochemistry. In 1959, Panić decided to start his own business, the International Chemical and Nuclear Corporation (ICN).

==Political and Public Service in Europe==
===Prime Minister of Yugoslavia===
In July 1992, Panić assumed the position of Prime Minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, at the request of Yugoslav President [[Dobrica Ćosić]] and Serbian President Slobodan Milošević.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Southland Businessman Picked as Yugoslav Premier :  Balkans: Milan Panic, an emigre and founder of ICN Pharmaceuticals, is to announce his decision today.|url = http://articles.latimes.com/1992-07-02/news/mn-1900_1_milan-panic|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|date = 1992-07-02|access-date = 2016-02-16|issn = 0458-3035|language = en-US|first = CAROL J.|last = WILLIAMS|first2 = JAMES M.|last2 = GOMEZ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panić set out goals of achieving peace, drafting a constitution, lifting U.N. sanctions, and pushing for the closure of concentration camps.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|title = I was a CEO-turned-prime minister.

On 2 December 1992, Panić announced his intention to challenge Milošević for the Serbian presidency, campaigning on a platform of economic reforms and bringing a peaceful resolution to the [[Bosnian War]]. Panić contended that Milošević had crippled Serbia by allowing unemployment and inflation to rise, while inciting isolation and sanctions by the international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Panic to Challenge Milosevic for Serbian Presidency :  Yugoslavia: Residency requirement could thwart former Southern California businessman.|url = http://articles.latimes.com/1992-12-02/news/mn-1305_1_slobodan-milosevic|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|date = 1992-12-02|access-date = 2016-02-16|issn = 0458-3035|language = en-US|first = LAURA|last = SILBER}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panić appealed directly to Serbian youth&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|title = A magnetic, maddening giant exiting O.C.|url = http://www.ocregister.com/articles/-67780--.html|website = The Orange County Register|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and older voters seeking a compromise in the ongoing conflict that included recognition of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina in their current borders.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite news|title = High Court in Serbia Clears Way For a Challenge to the President|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/10/world/high-court-in-serbia-clears-way-for-a-challenge-to-the-president.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 1992-12-10|access-date = 2016-02-16|issn = 0362-4331|first = Chuck|last = Sudetic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Serbian general election, 1992|1992 Serbian general election]], Panić came in second behind Milošević, receiving 32% of votes cast.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In the aftermath, observers at the Helsinki Commission, political experts, and journalists alleged that Milošević and his supporters had manipulated the election results through improper use of state media and vote tampering.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = How Milosevic Stole the Election|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/14/magazine/how-milosevic-stole-the-election.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 1993-02-14|access-date = 2016-02-16|issn = 0362-4331|first = Douglas E.|last = Schoen;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yugoslavia Peace Efforts and Dayton Accords===
Following his term as Prime Minister, Panić stayed involved in the effort to restore peace and democracy in the region. In December 1993, he began correspondence with U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = World leaders congratulate Clinton, worry|url = http://www.upi.com/Archives/1992/11/04/World-leaders-congratulate-Clinton-worry/7351025693304/|website = UPI|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarding a proposed peace summit with all heads of state of the former Yugoslavia. In 1994, he met with Clinton and his advisers in California to discuss the proposal further.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Following additional discussions over the next two years, in which Panić proposed a Balkans peace conference, the Clinton Administration convened the Conference on Establishing Peace at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Prime minister for Peace: My Struggle for Serbian Democracy|last = Murphy|first = Kevin|publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year = 2015|isbn = |location = London|pages = 176–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conference culminated in the signing of the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Accords]] on 21 November 1995,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; which brought an end to the Bosnian War by dividing Bosnia and Herzegovina into two separate entities: The [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Republika Srpska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Srebrenica Massacre, After 20 Years, Still Casts a Long Shadow in Bosnia|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/09/world/europe/srebrenica-genocide-massacre.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2015-07-08|access-date = 2016-02-16|issn = 0362-4331|first = Dan|last = Bilefsky|first2 = Somini|last2 = Sengupta}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the end of the war, Panić has continued to push for democracy in the Yugoslav region by convening political activists and advocating in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Balkan Rebirth|last = Hirsh|first = Michael|date = 1996|work = Newsweek|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = OC's Panić at center stage|last = Mouchard|first = Andre|date = 28 March 1999|work = Orange County Register|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
===Launch of ICN===
In 1959, Panić launched ICN out of his garage just outside of [[Los Angeles]], CA using $200 in startup capital. His initial business model was built upon synthesizing chemical compounds to sell to California research labs.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; During the 1960s, ICN marketed a generic version of [[L-DOPA|L-Dopa]], a widely used [[Parkinson's disease]] antidote.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|title = FOREVER YOUNG :  In a Quiet Lab in Costa Mesa, Milan Panic and a Team of Scientists Are Close to Answering Mankind's Enduring Question: Why Die?|url = http://articles.latimes.com/1987-06-21/magazine/tm-9056_1_aging-process|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|date = 1987-06-21|access-date = 2016-02-19|issn = 0458-3035|language = en-US|first = MARK|last = CHRISTENSEN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panić led ICN over the following decades to develop the building blocks for several thousand potential new drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Struggling Drug Firm Pins Hopes on Ribavirin :  ICN Pharmaceuticals' Gamble May Put It Among the World's Medical Giants|url = http://articles.latimes.com/1985-04-02/business/fi-19488_1_drug-industry|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|date = 1985-04-02|access-date = 2016-02-19|issn = 0458-3035|language = en-US|first = CARLA|last = LAZZARESCHI}}&lt;/ref&gt; As ICN grew, Panić moved his operations from Pasadena, CA to a new research lab in Costa Mesa, CA and renamed the company ICN Pharmaceuticals. In 1967, ICN was officially listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Good, the Bad and the Living Dead: Venture Capital Cases in the Healthcare Industry|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jy602xHpKzwC|publisher = Moment LLC|date = 2005-07-01|isbn = 9780976388807|language = en|first = Albert J.|last = Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery of Ribavirin and Production of Virazole===
In 1972, ICN discovered the [[ribavirin]] compound, the earliest recorded broad spectrum [[Antiviral drug|antiviral]] agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Ribavirin--current status of a broad spectrum antiviral agent|journal = Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy|date = 2001-08-01|issn = 1465-6566|pmid = 11585000|pages = 1317–1324|volume = 2|issue = 8|doi = 10.1517/14656566.2.8.1317|first = N.

In 1985, ICN and the [[Kodak|Eastman-Kodak]] company launched a six-year, $45 million joint venture to research drugs that slow, halt, or reverse the aging process.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Between 1986 and 1987, the FDA contended that ICN had exaggerated Virazole’s effectiveness in treating other illnesses including the AIDS virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = F.D.A.

Following the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], ICN acquired multiple pharmaceutical firms in Eastern Europe. In May 1991, ICN bought 75% of [[Galenika a.d.|Galenika]], Yugoslavia’s largest drug maker at the time. After eight months, the new subsidiary ICN-Galenika was producing revenues of $364 million.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|title = No Peace For Milan Panic|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/1992-07-05/no-peace-for-milan-panic|website = BloombergView|access-date = 2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1992, ICN Pharmaceuticals and ICN-Galenika partially financed a $100,000 initiative to vaccinate children in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = YUGOSLAV VACCINE PROGRAM - Pharmaceutical industry news|url = http://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/yugoslav-vaccine-program|website = www.thepharmaletter.com|access-date = 2016-02-19|first = The Pharma|last = Letter}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) investigated ICN over shareholder concerns related to Mr. Panić’s sale of company stock before a key regulatory decision by the FDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = COMPANY NEWS;ICN PHARMACEUTICALS SAYS INVESTIGATION WIDENS|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/10/business/company-news-icn-pharmaceuticals-says-investigation-widens.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 1996-05-10|access-date = 2016-02-19|issn = 0362-4331|last = Ap}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a three-year investigation, the SEC dropped its inquiry in 1998 with no charges filed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = COMPANY NEWS; S.E.C.

===Global Success and End of Tenure at ICN===
In 1998, the FDA approved Virazole for the treatment of Hepatitis C in conjunction with another medication called interferon.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Virazole eventually became a global standard treatment for multiple pediatric and adult medical conditions.

The '''Motor Vehicle Safety Whistleblower Act''' was passed by [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] in December 2015 as part of the [[Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act]] to provide an incentive to bring to light safety-related problems.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/USCODE-2015-title49/USCODE-2015-title49-subtitleVI-partA-chap301-subchapIV-sec30172|title=49 U.S.C. 30172 - Whistleblower incentives and protections|website=www.gpo.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program allows industry insiders to report on violations of federal vehicle-safety laws and receive 10% to 30% of monetary sanctions over $1 million that the government imposes based on that information.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.freep.com/story/opinion/contributors/2016/05/12/auto-whistle-blower-law-help-keep-public-safe/84020634/|title=Auto whistle-blower law will help keep public safe|last=Lamprey|first=Wayne|work=Detroit Free Press|access-date=2017-11-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Republican Senator [[John Thune]] of [[South Dakota]] and Democratic Senator [[Bill Nelson]] of [[Florida]] cosponsored the Motor Vehicle Safety Whistleblower Act in response to several high-profile auto safety scandals. The [[whistleblower]] program was designed to protect the public by providing an incentive for insiders working at auto manufacturers, vehicle part suppliers or dealerships to assist the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]] (DOT) and [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) by bringing to the Government's attention information about violations of vehicle-safety laws that are likely to cause unreasonable risk of death or serious physical injury. Whistleblowers are eligible for rewards under the Act if the information they bring forward contributes to the Government's success in an enforcement or related legal action. Awards are based on the value of a whistleblower's information and the extent of assistance provided.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The program works in concert with existing federal law to protect whistleblowers from unlawful employer retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whistleblowers.gov/statutes/map21|title=Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) {{!}} Whistleblower Protection Program|website=www.whistleblowers.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also allows whistleblowers to keep their identities confidential when reporting violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/judicial/308900-celebrating-motor-vehicle-safety-whistleblower-acts-first|title=Celebrating Motor Vehicle Safety Whistleblower Act's first anniversary|last=Yampolsky|first=Ari|date=2016-12-06|work=TheHill|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A whistleblower does not have to be a U.S. citizen or resident to qualify for an award, and violations he or she reports on don't have to occur in the U.S. so long as some of the vehicles, or parts, at issue are distributed in the U.S. market.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Examples of safety violations for which whistleblowers can receive an award ==
The program applies broadly to safety-related vehicle and vehicle-equipment defects, including failures to notify the government of such defects. Examples of previous safety-related violations for which a whistleblower could have received an award under the program if he or she brought it to light include: [[Takata Corporation|Takata]]'s [[airbag]] ruptures, [[General Motors|GM's]] [[ignition switch]] defects, [[Toyota]]'s "sticky" pedals that caused unintended acceleration, and the Early Warning Reporting (EWR) failures that affected [[Fiat]], [[Chrysler]], [[Honda]], [[Ferrari]], Triumph, and [[Forest River (company)|Forest River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://constantinecannon.com/practice/whistleblower/whistleblower-types/auto-safety/|title=Motor Vehicle Safety Whistleblower Act|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Independent Contractors Association''', or NICA, is a [[United States]]-based organization that describes itself as an alliance of [[independent contractors]]. It was founded in 1995 as a corporation by Thomas McGrath, a former contractor in the [[transportation industry]]. According to NICA's website, its purpose is to provide services giving administrative support to independent contractors, but particularly for individuals who work as couriers or messengers (i.e., parcel or mail pickup and delivery, whether doing parcel pickup and delivery by bicycle or by automobile or motorcycle or other motorized vehicle or by serving as a walker).

==Insurance Fraud==
On May 6, 2006, Frank Green of the [[San Diego Union-Tribune]] reported that "the [[San Diego County District Attorney]]'s Office has issued a 50-count [[indictment]] against Thomas M. McGrath, founder and president of NICA Inc., and seven other company officials for allegedly filing [[false insurance claims]] worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. ... McGrath and the other NICA executives were [[arrest]]ed in Massachusetts on Wednesday." A year later, "Thomas McGrath, Dan Curran and David Kenyon were sentenced to 1 day in jail, 3 years [[probation]], and ordered to pay $350,000 in [[restitution]], and $14,000 [[Criminal investigation|investigative]] costs," according to a [[California Department of Insurance]] annual report. "The eight were charged with one count of [[Conspiracy to commit fraud|conspiracy to commit premium fraud]], six counts of premium [[fraud]], and 43 counts of filing false injury [[insurance claim|claims]] in a scheme that totaled more than $600,000 in losses," said the report.

The '''Neon Museum''' in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], [[United States]], features signs from old casinos and other businesses displayed outdoors on 2.62 acres. The museum features a restored lobby shell from the defunct [[La Concha Motel]] as its visitor center, which officially opened on October 27, 2012.&lt;ref name=LVRJ-120831&gt;{{cite news|title=Lights this way: Neon Museum opening set|newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal|first=Tim|last=O'Reilley|date=August 31, 2012|url=http://www.lvrj.com/business/lights-this-way-neon-museum-opening-set-168120336.html|accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, the [[Young Electric Sign Company]] (YESCO) stored many of these old signs in their "boneyard." The signs were slowly being destroyed by exposure to the elements.

The signs are considered by Las Vegas locals, business owners and government organizations to be not only artistically, but also historically, significant to the culture of the city. Each of the restored signs in the collection holds a story about who created it and why it is important.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neonmuseum.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Neon Museum was founded in 1996 as a partnership between the Allied Arts Council of Southern Nevada and the City of Las Vegas. Today, it is an independent non-profit. Located on Las Vegas Boulevard and Bonanza, the Neon Museum includes the new Neon Boneyard Park, which is adjacent to the former YESCO Boneyard.

The impetus behind the museum was the loss of the iconic sign from [[Sands Hotel and Casino|The Sands]]; after it closed in 1995, there was no place to store the massive sign, and it was scrapped.&lt;ref name=Artsy-16&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-take-a-tour-through-las-vegas-s-museum-of-forgotten-neon-signs |title=A Treasure Trove of Historic Neon Signs Is Nestled on Las Vegas Boulevard |author=Gotthardt, Alexxa |date=14 December 2016 |work=Artsy |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To mark its official opening in November 1996, the Neon Museum restored and installed the ''[[Hacienda (resort)|Hacienda]] Horse &amp; Rider'' sign at the intersection of [[Las Vegas Boulevard]] and [[Fremont Street]].&lt;ref name=LVRJ-151102 /&gt; However, access to the collection was provided by appointment only.&lt;ref name=Sun-100206 /&gt; Annual attendance was approximately 12–20,000 during this time.&lt;ref name=NYT-130201 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/arts-culture/neon-museum-preserving-las-vegas-history-by-giving-old-signs-new-life/ |title=Neon Museum preserving Las Vegas history bygiving old signs new life |author=Cling, Carol |date=25 October 2012 |newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal |accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the historic [[La Concha Motel|La Concha]] lobby was donated to the museum, which moved and reassembled the building {{convert|4|mi}} north along Las Vegas Boulevard after cutting it into eight pieces. It now serves as the museum's visitors' center and headquarters.&lt;ref name=NYT-121027 /&gt; Although it cost nearly $3&amp;nbsp;million to move and restore the La Concha, the plans to open a museum became concrete after the donation of the building, drawing a number of public and private grants and donations.&lt;ref name=NYT-121027 /&gt; In total, approximately $6.5&amp;nbsp;million was raised for the visitors' center, headquarters, a new park, and restoration of 15 major signs.&lt;ref name=NYT-130201&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/arts/design/the-neon-museum-in-las-vegas.html?mtrref=www.google.com |title=Where Las Vegas Stardust Rests in Peace |author=Rothstein, Edward |date=1 February 2013 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, the Neon Museum restored and installed the famous Silver Slipper sign across from its welcome center, and two more restored vintage signs were installed near the northern end of Las Vegas Boulevard to mark its designation as a [[National Scenic Byway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2009/nov/09/refurbished-signs-step-forward-preserving-las-vega/ |title=Refurbished signs a step forward in preserving Las Vegas' past |author=Toplikar, Dave |date=9 November 2009 |newspaper=Las Vegas Sun |accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Paid public admission commenced on October 27, 2012, replacing the prior appointment-only basis.&lt;ref name="NYT-121027"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/us/new-museum-shows-off-las-vegass-neon-side.html |title=New Museum Shows Off Las Vegas’s Neon Side |author=Pratt, Timothy |date=27 October 2012 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attendance during the first year was 60,461, exceeding the early estimate of 45–50,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/neon-museum-meets-visitor-projection-in-its-first-year-more-than-60000/ |title=Neon Museum meets visitor projection in its first year — more than 60,000 |author=Morrison, Jane Ann |date=6 March 2014 |newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal |accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After outgrowing its space in the former La Concha lobby shell, the museum moved its headquarters to old City Hall in 2016 and converted the offices into a museum store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/tourism/neon-museum-unveils-first-stage-of-expansion-plans/ |title=Neon Museum unveils first stage of expansion plans |author=Wargo, Buck |date=7 October 2016 |newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal |accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the museum purchased land for its first expansion since opening to the public in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/neon-museum-receives-425k-grant-for-major-expansion/ |title=Neon Museum receives $425K grant for major expansion |author=Lilly, Caitlin |date=16 February 2017 |newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal |accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For its fifth anniversary, the Neon Museum offered free admission on October 28, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/travel/deals/la-tr-las-vegas-neon-museum-marks-five-years-with-free-admission-20171024-story.html |title=Las Vegas' Neon Museum marks five years and wants you to visit — for free |author=Jones, Jay |date=25 October 2017 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the Neon Museum administrative staff moved again to a space on the campus of the Las Vegas-Review Journal and opened a programming space there called Ne10 Studio.

==Exhibits==
The Neon Museum is located on Las Vegas Boulevard and Bonanza Road, South of Cashman Center and along the Las Vegas downtown museum corridor. The museum has exhibits in three main areas: restored and installed neon signs in both the Fremont Street area and along the Las Vegas Strip; and in the Neon Boneyard.

The Neon Museum maintains several restored signs throughout [[Downtown Las Vegas]] and along the [[Las Vegas Strip]].&lt;ref name="StripTour"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neonmuseum.org/images/tourMap.pdf|title=Restored Las Vegas Neon Signs Tour|author=|date=2013|publisher=The Neon Museum|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of restoring signs is estimated to range from $10,000 for small pieces to $100,000 for the largest signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/neon-museum-boneyard-signs-graveyard-las-vegas-ces-2017/ |title=Neon Museum is saving Las Vegas' most beautiful tech |author=Reilly, Claire |work=c{{!}}net |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boneyard===
The Neon Boneyard Park was installed in 2012, with "NEON" spelled out using letters shaped like those on signs for the [[Golden Nugget Las Vegas|Golden Nugget]] ("N"), [[Caesars Palace]] ("E"), [[Binion's Horseshoe]] ("O"), and [[Desert Inn]] ("N").&lt;ref name="Sun-100206"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2010/feb/06/city-begin-construction-neon-boneyard-park/ |title=City to begin construction on Neon Boneyard Park |author=Finnegan, Amanda |date=6 February 2010 |newspaper=Las Vegas Sun |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letters are set on a grid inspired by the sign for [[Sands Hotel and Casino|The Sands]], and the sign is decorated with stars like those from the [[Stardust Resort and Casino|Stardust]] and a starburst like the [[Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign]] designed by [[Betty Willis (artist)|Betty Willis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.vegas.com/las-vegas-attractions/10-of-our-favorite-signs-at-the-neon-museum-62257/ |title=10 of our favorite signs at the Neon Museum |author=Oñoz-Wright, Ashley |date=18 November 2015 |website=vegas.com [blog] |publisher=Remark Media |accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pieces in the boneyard include signage from the [[Stardust Resort &amp; Casino|Stardust]], [[Riviera (hotel and casino)|Riviera]], [[Desert Inn]] and [[Caesar's Palace|Caesars Palace]] as well as many others. The Neon Museum also houses fiberglass sculptures including a giant skull from the [[Treasure Island Hotel and Casino]] among others.

In 2018, the Neon Museum began ''Brilliant!'', a 30-minute night show designed by [[Craig Winslow]] which uses multiple projectors to reanimate defunct signs, set to vintage and contemporary music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://lasvegasweekly.com/ae/fine-art/2018/feb/08/the-neon-museums-brilliant-makes-classic-signs-shi/ |title=The Neon Museum's 'Brilliant!' makes classic signs shine again |author=Reed, C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5879">The '''Oswald Watt Gold Medal''' is an [[Australia]]n [[aviation]] award named for [[Oswald Watt]] (1878–1921), a decorated pilot in [[World War I]].

It originated in 1921 after the death of Oswald Watt and is awarded for "A most brilliant performance in the air or the most notable contribution to aviation by an Australian or in Australia" by the [[Royal Federation of Aero Clubs of Australia]]. As it is awarded on merit it is not an annual award; between the award's creation and 1999 it had been awarded a total of 48 times. It was not awarded in the years 2000 - 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://rfaca.com.au/awards/| title= Awards|publisher= Royal Federation of Aero Clubs of Australia|accessdate = 31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9621">'''Peter Hanson Coors''' (born September 20, 1946) is an American businessman and politician. He formerly served as the Chairman of the [[Molson Coors Brewing Company]] and Chairman of [[MillerCoors]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_18145829]&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Coors was inducted into the Colorado Business Hall of Fame by Junior Achievement-Rocky Mountain and the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce in 2012.

==Early life==
Coors was born in [[Golden, Colorado]]. He is the great-grandson of [[Adolph Coors]], the [[brewing]] entrepreneur, and the son of [[Holly Coors]] (born Edith Holland Hanson)&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2457&amp;dat=19810619&amp;id=SBNbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fk4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3727,1561610]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Joseph Coors]]. He graduated from [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] and then from [[Cornell University]] from which he received a degree in [[engineering]]. A member of the [[Psi Upsilon]] Fraternity, Coors was elected to the [[Sphinx Head Society]] during his final year at Cornell. He also received his [[MBA]] from the [[University of Denver]] in 1970.

==Career==
Coors has worked all of his life in various positions at his family's firm, the [[Coors Brewing Company]].

In 1993, Coors became vice chairman and [[CEO]] of the company, and in 2002, he was named Chairman of Coors Brewing Company and [[Adolph Coors Company]]. In 2004, according to the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'', Coors "made $332,402 in salary and a $296,917 bonus as chairman of Adolph Coors. He also received 125,000 stock options with a potential value of $13 million".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/business/article/0,1299,DRMN_4_3677786,00.html Denver area Business News, Financial Info, Stocks, and Real Estate Data : Rocky Mountain News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He stepped down temporarily from these positions in 2004 to run for the US Senate. After the 2005 merger with [[Molson]], Coors became a Class A Director in the newly formed Molson Coors Brewing Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.molsoncoors.com/bod/index.html Molson Coors Leadership&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109061720/http://molsoncoors.com/bod/index.html |date=2006-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On May 7, 2018, Coors wrote an open letter criticizing the hostility toward “Big Beer,” i.e., large brewing companies, at a Craft Brewers Conference sponsored by the Brewers Association. “The leadership of the Brewers Association does a great disservice to the entire beer value chain by attempting to pit one part of the industry against another,” he charged.&lt;ref&gt;Furnari, Chris; Coors Chairman Slams Brewers Association in ‘Open Letter’; Brewbound; May 7, 2018; [https://www.brewbound.com/news/coors-chairman-slams-brewers-association-open-letter]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a May 14, 2018 opinion piece for the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', Coors urged [[Donald Trump|President Trump]], whom he respects, to put an end to the Midwest Premium, a “mysterious fee” added to aluminum orders in the U.S. “It is time to fix this mess and end the premium once and for all,” he wrote. “A private solution would be best — one crafted by producers, buyers, market makers and customers like Molson Coors. Let us forge a new deal on aluminum, to the benefit of a hundred million fans of the most American of beverages. President Trump, are you with us?”&lt;ref&gt;In a Trade War, It’s Hard to Get a Head; Wall Street Journal; May 14, 2018; [https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-a-trade-war-its-hard-to-get-a-head-1526337947]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Board memberships and other professional activities===
In October 2006, he was appointed by the [[University of Colorado Hospital]] Board of Directors as chairman of the board for the new University of Colorado Hospital Foundation.

He has served on the boards of [[U.S. Bancorp]], [[H. J. Heinz Company]], [[HOBY]] (Hugh O'Brian Youth Leadership) Colorado, and Energy Corp. of America. He is also involved in civic organizations such as the Denver Area Council of the [[Boy Scouts of America]] and the [[National Western Stock Show]] Association. He is also part of the [[List of Colorado Rockies owners and executives|ownership group]] of the [[Colorado Rockies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colorado.rockies.mlb.com/team/front_office.jsp?c_id=col|title=Front Office Directory|publisher=ColoradoRockies.com|work=Ownership Group|accessdate=2008-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of the [[Augusta National Golf Club]] in [[Augusta, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/golf/masters/2002-09-27-augusta-list.htm Augusta National Golf Club members list], ''[[USA Today]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Coors was granted an Honorary Doctorate from [[Johnson &amp; Wales University]], where he is a trustee. He sits on the Board of Trustees of the [[American Enterprise Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aei.org/about/board-of-trustees/ American Enterprise Institute Board of Trustees]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
When U.S. Senator [[Ben Nighthorse Campbell]] declared in 2004 that he was retiring, Coors announced his candidacy. His opponent in the Republican [[primary election]] was another [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]], former congressman [[Bob Schaffer]].  During their primary, the two candidates engaged in an ideological disagreement, with Schaffer attacking Coors because his company had provided benefits to the partners of its [[gay]] and [[lesbian]] employees, in addition to promoting its beer in [[gay bar]]s. Coors defended himself by saying that he was opposed to [[same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]], and supported a [[Federal Marriage Amendment|constitutional amendment]] to ban it, although he noted that he supported [[Civil union|civil unions]] for gay couples.  According to the ''Rocky Mountain News'', Coors described his company's pro-[[LGBT]] practices as "good business, separate from politics."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/election/article/0,1299,DRMN_36_3034875,00.html Rocky Mountain News : Denver News, Business, Homes, Jobs, Cars, &amp; Information&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  He defeated Schaffer with 61% of the vote in the primary, with many analysts citing his high name recognition in the state as a primary factor. 

Coors faced [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and [[Colorado Attorney General]] [[Ken Salazar]] in the [[United States Senate election in Colorado, 2004|November 2004 election]], but was defeated by a margin of 51% to 47%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/CO/S/01/index.html | work=CNN | title=CNN.com Election 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the non-partisan [[Center for Responsive Politics]] (CPS), Coors gave his own campaign $1,213,657 and received individual donations of $60,550 from other Coors family members. He was mentioned as a possible contender in the 2008 Senate election.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Coors has been described as “a major donor in Colorado politics.” In 2016, Coors donated $5,000 to [[Leadership Matters for America]], a super PAC supporting the presidential candidacy of Donald Trump, and $5,000 to [[Right to Rise]], which supported [[Jeb Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, Eric; Pete Coors Fundraises for Trump; RollCall; June 28, 2016; [https://www.rollcall.com/politics/pete-coors-mike-shanahan-trump-fundraiser]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Coors is married to Marilyn Coors (born Grosso) and has six children.

On May 28, 2006, Coors was arrested by the [[Colorado State Patrol]] on suspicion of [[driving under the influence]] and registering a [[blood alcohol level]] higher than the [[Drunk_driving_law_by_country#United_States|legal limit]] (0.088).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_4046846 Denver Post&lt;/ref&gt; Coors commented on the incident, saying, "I should have planned ahead for a ride. For years, I've advocated the responsible use of our company's products. That's still my message, and our company's message. I am sorry that I didn't follow it myself."

On August 25, 2006, Coors pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of driving while impaired. A judge sentenced Coors to 24 hours of [[community service]] and a suspended fine and ordered him to undergo alcohol education courses.

'''Peter Carl Fabergé''', also known as '''Karl Gustavovich Fabergé''' ({{lang-ru|Карл Гу́ставович Фаберже́}}, ''Karl Gustavovich Faberzhe''; 30 May 1846 – 24 September 1920), was a Russian [[jewellery|jeweller]] best known for the famous [[Fabergé egg]]s made in the style of genuine [[Easter egg]]s, but using [[precious metal]]s and [[gemstone]]s rather than more mundane materials. He's the founder of the famous jewelry legacy [[House of Fabergé]].

==Early life==
[[File:Augusta Faberge.jpg|thumb|upright|Augusta Julia Jacobs Faberge]]
He was born in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia, to the [[Baltic German]] jeweller [[Gustav Fabergé]] and his [[Danish people|Danish]] wife Charlotte Jungstedt. Gustav Fabergé's paternal ancestors were [[Huguenot]]s, originally from [[La Bouteille]], [[Picardy]], who fled from France after the [[Edict of Fontainebleau|revocation of the Edict of Nantes]], first to Germany near [[Berlin]], then in 1800 to the [[Pernau]] (today [[Pärnu]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://faberge-museum.de/show.php?news&amp;nid=22 Fabergé Museum: Fabergé, sa famille et le développement de son entreprise] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325042052/http://faberge-museum.de/show.php?news&amp;nid=22 |date=2014-03-25 }}, faberge-museum.de&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baltic provinces|Baltic]] province of [[Livonia]], then part of Russia.

Until he was 14 years old he went to the German St Anne School in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia.{{cn|date=June 2018}} In 1860 his father retired from his jewelry business and moved with his family to [[Germany]]. He left the [[House of Fabergé]] in Saint Petersburg in the hands of his business partner. Carl Fabergé undertook a course at the [[Dresden]] Arts and Crafts School. 1862 [[Agathon Fabergé]], the Fabergés' second son, was born in [[Dresden]], Germany, where he went to school as well.

In 1864, Peter Carl Fabergé embarked upon a [[Grand Tour]] of [[Europe]] at . He received tuition from respected goldsmiths in Germany, France and England, attended a course at Schloss's Commercial College in [[Paris]], and viewed the objects in the galleries of Europe's leading museums.

His travel and study continued until 1872, when at the age of 26 he returned to St. Petersburg and married Augusta Julia Jacobs. 1874 saw the arrival of his first child, [[Eugene Fabergé]] and two years later, [[Agathon Fabergé]] was born; [[Alexander Fabergé]] and [[Nicholas Fabergé]] followed in 1877 and 1884 respectively.For the following 10 years, his father's trusted workmaster Hiskias Pendin acted as his mentor and tutor. The company was also involved with cataloguing, repairing, and restoring objects in the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]] during the 1870s. In 1881 the business moved to larger street-level premises at 16/18 Bolshaya Morskaya.

==Taking over the family business==
[[File:Karl Faberge.jpg|thumb|Peter Carl Faberge at work]]
Upon the death of Hiskias Pendin in 1882, Carl Fabergé took sole responsibility for running the company. Carl was awarded the title Master Goldsmith, which permitted him to use his own hallmark in addition to that of the firm. in 1885 his brother [[Agathon Fabergé]] joined the firm and became Carl Faberge's main assistant in the designing of jewelry. Agathon who had also [[Dresden]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saint-petersburg.com/german/peter-carl-faberge/Peter Carl Faberge]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carl and [[Agathon Fabergé Sr.]] were a sensation at the Pan-Russian Exhibition held in [[Moscow]] in 1882. Carl was awarded a gold medal and the [[St. Stanisias Medal]]. One of the Fabergé pieces displayed was a replica of a 4th-century BC gold bangle from the Scythian Treasure in the Hermitage. The Tsar, [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]], "Emperor and Autocrat of all the Russians", declared that he could not distinguish the Fabergé's work from the original and ordered that objects by the [[House of Fabergé]] should be displayed in the Hermitage as examples of superb contemporary Russian craftsmanship. The House of Fabergé with its range of jewels was now within the focus of Russia's Imperial Court.

When Peter Carl took over the House, there was a move from producing jewellery in the then-fashionable French 18th century style to becoming artist-jewellers. 
Fabergé's production of the very first so-called [[Fabergé egg]], the [[First Hen Egg|Hen Egg]],  given as a gift from the Tsar to his wife [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Maria Fyodorovna]] on Orthodox Easter (24 March) of 1885 so delighted her that on 1 May the Emperor assigned Fabergé the title ''Goldsmith by special appointment to the Imperial Crown'' of that year. This meant that Fabergé now had full personal access to the important [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]] Collection, where he was able to study and find inspiration for developing his unique personal style. Influenced by the jewelled bouquets created by the eighteenth century goldsmiths [[Jean-Jacques Duval]] and [[Jérémie Pauzié]], Fabergé re-worked their ideas combining them with his accurate observations and his fascination for Japanese art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macdougallauction.com/Indexx1113.asp?id=249&amp;lx=a|title=Faberge's Wild Cherry Study|website=www.macdougallauction.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518081057/http://www.macdougallauction.com/Indexx1113.asp?id=249&amp;lx=a|archivedate=2015-05-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This resulted in a revival of the lost art of [[enameling]] and a focus on the setting of every single gemstone in a piece to its best visual advantage. Indeed, it was not unusual for Agathon to make ten or more wax models so that all possibilities could be exhausted before deciding on a final design. Shortly after Agathon joined the firm, the House introduced ''objects deluxe'': gold bejewelled items embellished with enamel ranging from electric bell pushes to cigarette cases and including ''objects de fantaisie''.

==Easter eggs==
{{Main article|Fabergé egg}}
[[File:Kuz most 26.jpg|thumb|House of Faberge in Moscow ([[Kuznetsky Most]] 4), 1893]]
In light of the Empress' response to receiving one of Fabergé's eggs on Easter, the Tsar soon commissioned the company to make an Easter egg as a gift for her every year thereafter. The Tsar placed an order for another egg the following year. Beginning in 1887, the Tsar apparently gave Carl Fabergé complete freedom with regard to egg designs, which then became more and more elaborate. According to Fabergé Family tradition, not even the Tsar knew what form they would take— the only stipulation was that each one should be unique and each should contain a surprise.  Upon the death of Alexander III, his son, the next Tsar, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], followed this tradition and expanded it by requesting that there be two eggs each year, one for his mother (who was eventually given a total of 30 such eggs) and one for his wife, [[Alexandra Fyodorovna of Hesse|Alexandra]] (who received another 20).  These Easter gift eggs are today distinguished from the other jeweled eggs Fabergé ended up producing by their designation as "Imperial Easter eggs" or "Tsar Imperial Easter eggs". The tradition continued until the [[October Revolution]] when the entire Romanov dynasty was executed and the eggs and many other treasures were confiscated by the interim government.  The two final eggs were never delivered nor paid for.

Although today the House of Fabergé is famed for its Imperial Easter eggs, it made many more objects ranging from silver tableware to fine jewelry which were also of exceptional quality and beauty, and until its departure from Russia during the revolution, Fabergé's company became the largest jewelry business in the country. In addition to its [[Saint Petersburg]] headquarters, it had branches in [[Moscow]], [[Odessa]], [[Kiev]] and [[London]]. It produced some 150,000 to 200,000 objects from 1882 until 1917.

In 1900, Fabergé's work represented Russia at the [[1900 World's Fair]] in [[Paris]]. As Carl Fabergé was a member of the jury, the House of Fabergé exhibited ''hors concours'' (without competing). Nevertheless, the House was awarded a gold medal and the city's jewelers recognized Carl Fabergé as a maître. Additionally, France recognized Carl Fabergé with one of the most prestigious of French awards, appointing him a knight of the Legion of Honour. Two of Carl's sons and his head workmaster were also honored. Commercially, the exposition was a great success and the firm acquired a great many orders and clients.

==Stock, Russian Revolution and nationalisation==
In 1916, the House of Fabergé became a joint-stock company with a capital of 3-million rubles.

The following year upon the outbreak of the [[October Revolution]], the business was taken over by a 'Committee of the Employees of the Company K Fabergé. In 1918 The House of Fabergé was nationalised by the [[Bolsheviks]]. In early October the stock was confiscated. The House of Fabergé was no more. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

After the [[nationalisation]] of the business, Carl Fabergé left St. Petersburg on the last [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] train for [[Riga]]. In mid-November, the Revolution having reached [[Latvia]], he fled to Germany and first settled in [[Bad Homburg]] and then in [[Wiesbaden]]. Eugène, the Fabergés' eldest, travelled with his mother in darkness by sleigh and on foot through snow-covered woods and reached [[Finland]] in December 1918. During June 1920, Eugène reached Wiesbaden and accompanied his father to [[Switzerland]] where other members of the family had taken refuge at the Bellevue Hotel in [[Pully]], near [[Lausanne]].

Peter Carl Fabergé never recovered from the shock of the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} He died in Switzerland on September 24, 1920. His family believed he died of a broken heart. &lt;ref&gt;The Genius of Carl Faberge, Episode Two, 25 August 2018 BBC World News&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Augusta, died in 1925. The two were reunited in 1929 when Eugène Fabergé took his father's ashes from [[Lausanne]] and buried them in his mother's grave at the [[Cimetière du Grand Jas]] in [[Cannes]], France.

Fabergé had four sons: [[Eugène Fabergé|Eugène]] (1874–1960), [[Agathon Fabergé|Agathon]] (1876–1951), [[Alexander Fabergé|Alexander]] (1877–1952) and [[Nikolai Fabergé|Nicholas]] (1884–1939).  Descendants of Peter Carl Fabergé live in mainland Europe, Scandinavia and South America.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Personal life==
Henry Bainbridge, a manager of the London branch of the House of Fabergé, recorded recollections of his meetings with his employer in both his autobiography&lt;ref&gt;''Twice Seven: The Autobiography of H C Bainbridge'' (Routledge, London, 1933)&lt;/ref&gt; and the book he wrote about Fabergé.&lt;ref&gt;''Fabergé: Goldsmith and Jeweller to the Imperial Court – His Life and Work'' (Batsford, London, 1949)&lt;/ref&gt; We are also given an insight into the man from the recollections of François Birbaum, Fabergé's senior master craftsman from 1893 until the House's demise.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of the House of Fabergé according to the recollections of the senior master craftsman of the firm Franz P. Birbaum'' This was handwritten in 1919 at the request (or order) of the Soviet authorities. It added considerably to the knowledge of how the House of Fabergé operated. The English translation was published by Tatiana F Fabergé (great-granddaughter of Peter Carl Fabergé) and Valentin V. Skurlov in St. Petersburg in 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Bainbridge we know that while punctilious with his dress, Fabergé "rarely if ever wore black but favoured well-cut tweeds". He added "There was an air of the country gentleman about him, at times he reminded one of an immaculate gamekeeper with large pockets." He was a very focused individual with no wasted actions or speech. He did not like small talk. On one occasion during dinner Bainbridge, feeling out of the conversation said, "I see Lord Swaythingly is dead". Fabergé asked who he was and upon being told responded cuttingly, "And what can I do with a dead banker?"

When taking orders from customers he was always in a hurry and would soon forget the fine detail. He would then interrogate the staff so as to find any who had been standing near him and may have overheard. His great-granddaughter Tatiana Fabergé notes that he usually had a knotted handkerchief in his breast pocket.

When Carl noticed an unsuccessfully wrought item, he would call for his senior master craftsman and make endless derisory and ironic remarks. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} On occasions when Birbaum realized Fabergé was the designer, he would show him his sketch. Fabergé would then smile guiltily and say, "Since there is nobody to scold me, I have had to do it myself".

From Birbaum we also know that Carl was famous for his wit and was quite merciless to [[fop]]s, whom he hated. A certain prince who fell into this category boasted to Fabergé about his latest honour from the Tsar, adding that he had no idea as to why the award was made. The prince expected the jeweler to shower him with congratulations. Instead, Fabergé simply replied, "Indeed, your Highness, I too have no idea what for".

Carl never traveled with luggage—he bought all his requisites at his destination. On one occasion, when he arrived at the Negresco Hotel in Nice the doorman barred him from entering because of the amount of luggage he carried. Thankfully one of the grand dukes who was in residence called out a greeting and Carl Fabergé was promptly ushered apologetically into the establishment.

Bainbridge concludes, "Taking him all in all, Fabergé came as near to a complete understanding of human nature as it is possible for a man to come, with one word only inscribed on his banner, and that word – tolerance. There is no doubt whatsoever that this consideration for the worth of others was the foundation for his success."

[[Image:PeterKozler.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Peter Kosler]]
'''Peter Kosler''' or '''Kozler''' (16 February 1824 &amp;ndash; 16 April 1879) was a [[Carniola]]n [[lawyer]], [[geographer]], [[cartographer]],  [[activist]], and [[manufacturer]]. He was of [[ethnic German]] origin, but also identified with [[Slovenes|Slovene culture]] and advocated the peaceful coexistence of the Slovene and German cultures in [[Carniola]].

Kosler was born in [[Koče, Kočevje|Koče]], a village south of [[Kočevje]] in [[Gottschee|Gottschee County]], in what was then the [[Kingdom of Illyria (1816–1849)|Austrian Kingdom of Illyria]], and is now [[Slovenia]]. He is best known for creating the first map of the [[Slovene Lands]], called ''[[Kosler's Map|Zemljovid Slovenske dežele in pokrajin]]'' (Map of Slovene Lands and Provinces). Made already from 1848 until the end of 1852, it was published only in 1861. Despite this, it had a significant impact in the time of the Slovene national awakening.

Born in a relatively well-to-do family, Kosler made a fortune with beer manufacturing and was the founder of the [[Union Brewery (Ljubljana)|Union Brewery]]. He gave large amounts of money to support Slovenian cultural associations and institutions. He was close to the conservative [[Old Slovene]] political movement.

Kosler bought [[Cekin Mansion]] just outside the [[center District, Ljubljana|center]] of Ljubljana and renovated it in a neoclassical style. Today, the mansion houses the [[National Museum of Contemporary History]]. The Koslers also owned a mansion ({{lang-sl|Kozlerjeva palača}}) in the center of Ljubljana, close to [[Congress Square]] ({{lang|sl|Kongresni trg}}) and [[Čop Street]] ({{lang|sl|Čopova ulica}}), which was regarded as one of the finest Baroque buildings in the city. The building was slated for demolition in 1956 and torn down by the Communist authorities in 1961&lt;ref&gt;Drnovšek, Marjan, France Rozman, &amp; Peter Vodopivec. 1997. ''Slovenska kronika XX. stoletja: 1900–1941''. Ljubljana: Nova revija, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to widen the nearby street, which caused a public outcry and marked a milestone in the development of postwar urban development in Ljubljana. According to an interview with art historian Damjan Prelovšek in October 2006, trees now grow at the site of the former building, demonstrating that its demolition was a political decision and unnecessary in order to widen the street. 

Kosler also owned a plot of land in the [[Ljubljana Marshes]] known as Kosler's Thicket ({{lang-sl|Kozlerjeva gošča}}). During [[World War II]], the plot was used as a mass grave for victims of the [[Slovenian Home Guard]] torturer and killer [[Franc Frakelj]].

Kosler died in [[Ljubljana]] and is buried at [[Žale|Žale cemetery]] in Ljubljana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grobovi.zale.si/index.aspx?Lang=ENG Žale cemetery grave index] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214181756/http://grobovi.zale.si/index.aspx?Lang=ENG |date=2013-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/121721462 Peter Kosler's grave at Žale cemetery]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, a Slovenian [[postal stamp]] was dedicated to Kosler.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.posta.si/postne-znamke/534?year=1999 PS | Poštne znamke&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3128">'''Project management simulation''' is [[simulation]] used for [[project management]] training and analysis. 
Project management simulation is often used as [[training simulation]] for [[project manager]]s. In other cases it is used for [[what-if analysis]] and for supporting [[decision-making]] in real projects.
Frequently the simulation is conducted using [[software tool]]s.

==Training==
Project management simulation for training is an interactive learning activity, frequently practiced as a group exercise. The purpose  of the simulation is to impart to students the competencies (i.e. knowledge, skills, and attitudes) that will ultimately improve their performance.&lt;ref name="salas"&gt;Salas, E., Wildman, J. L., Piccolo, R. F. (2009). "Using simulation-based training to enhance management Education", Academy of Management Learning &amp; Education, 8, 559–573.&lt;/ref&gt;
It confronts trainees with the situations and problems that arise in real world projects. Trainees see the consequences of the decisions they make. They can track the evolution of the project parameters: [[Scope (project management)|scope]], costs, [[Schedule (project management)|schedule]], and quality, as well as human factors. The simulation provides an opportunity for learners to solve typical project problems, to make mistakes and analyze them. 
Pedagogic goals of project management simulation can be to teach how to:
* determine goal and objectives of a project; 
* [[Estimation (project management)|estimate]] cost; 
* plan [[Task (project management)|tasks]] of the project; 
* plan [[Resource (project management)|resources]] in a project; 
* use project management tools; 
* control the progress of a project; 
* make [[Project team|team]] decisions under stress; 
* react appropriately in typical project management situations 
Different studies&lt;ref name="salas" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nembhard, D., K. Yip and A. Shtub, "Comparing Competitive and Cooperative Strategies for Learning Project Management" April, 2009, [http://www.jee.org/2009/april/8.pdf ''International Journal of Engineering Education''], 181–192&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that using [[simulation-based training]] for training project managers is superior to other methods.

==Analysis==
Project management simulation is used to analyze real projects. The goal of the simulation is to show the user the different possible outcomes of his decisions, along with the probability that each outcome will occur. The simulation helps in reducing the project risk and in choosing the best project plan. 
In a typical simulation the project is first modeled into a software tool along with uncertain variables. A simulation is then run to check the different possible outcomes and their probability as a result of different inputs for the uncertain variables.

'''Sir James Reginald Conyers''' [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (3 September 1879 – 26 July 1948), known as '''Reggie Conyers''' during his early life, was a [[Bermuda|Bermudian]] lawyer, politician, and [[cricket]]er. Born in [[Pembroke Parish]], Bermuda, Conyers was a keen member of the Hamilton Cricket Club, and toured the United States with the club in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/17/Hamilton_Cricket_Club_in_United_States_of_America_1905.html Hamilton Cricket Club in United States of America 1905] – CricketArchive. Retrieved 24 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Having regularly played for Bermuda against touring American teams, he was invited to play for the [[Philadelphian cricket team|Gentlemen of Philadelphia]] during the team's [[Philadelphian cricket team in Jamaica in 1908–09|1908–09 tour]] of [[Jamaica]]. In the final match of the tour, against [[Jamaica cricket team|Jamaica]] at [[Melbourne Park, Kingston|Melbourne Park]], Conyers scored 149 runs opening Philadelphia's batting, his highest [[first-class cricket|first-class]] score and only first-class [[Century (cricket)|century]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/7/7777.html Jamaica v Gentlemen of Philadelphia], Gentlemen of Philadelphia in Jamaica 1908/09 – CricketArchive. Retrieved 24 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He would later make several appearances for Philadelphia's [[Merion Cricket Club]] in the [[Halifax Cup]] competition in 1909 and 1911.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/27/27245/Halifax_Cup_Matches.html Halifax Cup Matches played by Reggie Conyers (3)] – CricketArchive. Retrieved 24 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Conyers remained heavily involved in Bermudian cricket after the tour's end, often captaining the [[Bermuda national cricket team|Bermudan national team]] against touring sides from North America. He was playing competitive cricket until as late as 1928, when he captained Bermuda on a tour of the United States aged 49.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/27/27245/Miscellaneous_Matches.html Miscellaneous Matches played by Reggie Conyers (41)] – CricketArchive. Retrieved 24 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the conclusion of the [[First World War]], Conyers established a law firm based in [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]], and in 1928 merged his firm with that of Nicholas Dill and James Pearman, forming the law firm of [[Conyers Dill &amp; Pearman]]. Conyers was made a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1936,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34238|date=1 January 1936|page=13|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[knight bachelor]] in 1944, for "services to Bermuda".&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=36544|date=8 June 1944|page=2566|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served in the [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]] from the 1930s, and served for a period of time as [[List of Speakers of the House of Assembly of Bermuda|Speaker]]. Conyers also chaired a committee attempting to implement [[conscription]] during the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20120225/ISLAND09/702259909 Black Bermudians' role in wartime defence of our country] – ''[[The Royal Gazette (Bermuda)|The Royal Gazette]]''.

'''Rufus Choate''' (October 1, 1799{{spaced ndash}}July 13, 1859) was an [[United States|American]] [[lawyer]], [[orator]], and Congressman.

==Early life and family==
Rufus Choate was born in [[Ipswich, Massachusetts]], the son of Miriam (Foster) and David Choate, a teacher and Revolutionary War veteran.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/people/history/us-history-biographies/rufus-choate&lt;/ref&gt; He was a descendant of an English family which settled in Massachusetts in 1643.&lt;ref&gt;Jameson, Ephraim Orcutt''. The Choates in America. 1643–1896. John Choate and His Descendants.'' Chebacco, Ipswich, Mass. Boston: A. Mudge &amp; Son, printers, 1896.&lt;/ref&gt; His first cousin, physician George Choate, was the father of [[George C. S. Choate]] and [[Joseph Hodges Choate]]. Rufus Choate's birthplace, [[Choate House (Massachusetts)|Choate House]], remains virtually unchanged to this day.

A precocious child, at six he is said to have been able to repeat large parts of the [[Bible]] and of ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'' from memory. He was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~news/releases/2009/06/13.html Dartmouth to honor two valedictorians], Dartmouth Press Release, June 2009. Retrieved 2009-10-09.&lt;/ref&gt; and graduated as [[valedictorian]] of his class at [[Dartmouth College]] in 1819, was a tutor there in 1819–1820, and spent a year in the [[Harvard Law School|law school of Harvard University]], receiving the LL.D. degree in 1845. Choate studied for a like period in [[Washington, D.C.]], in the office of [[William Wirt (Attorney General)|William Wirt]], then [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General of the United States]].

==Career==
[[File:Rufus Choate by Daniel Chester French.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Rufus Choate memorial statue by noted American sculptor [[Daniel Chester French]], [[John Adams Court House]], [[Boston, Massachusetts]]]]
He was admitted to the Massachusetts [[bar (law)|bar]] in 1823 and practiced at what was later [[Danvers, Massachusetts|South Danvers (now Peabody)]] for five years, during which time he served in the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] (1825–1826) and in the [[Massachusetts Senate]] (1827).

In 1828, he moved to [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], where his successful conduct of several important [[lawsuit]]s brought him prominently into public notice. In 1830 he was elected to Congress as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] from Salem, defeating the [[Andrew Jackson|Jacksonian]] candidate for re-election, [[Benjamin Crowninshield]], a former [[United States Secretary of the Navy]], and in 1832 he was re-elected. His career in Congress was marked by a speech in defence of a protective [[tariff]].

[[File:RufusChoate house 3WinthropPlace Boston.png|thumb|right|Choate lived on Winthrop Place, Boston, 1851-1859&lt;ref&gt;State Street Trust Company. Forty of Boston's historic houses. 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 1834, before the completion of his second term, he resigned and established himself in the practice of law in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. Already his reputation as a speaker had spread beyond [[New England]], and he was much sought after as an orator for public occasions. For several years, he devoted himself unremittingly to his profession but, in 1841, succeeded fellow Dartmouth graduate [[Daniel Webster]] in the [[United States Senate]]. Shortly afterwards he delivered an address at the memorial services for [[William Henry Harrison|President William Henry Harrison]] at [[Faneuil Hall]].

In the Senate, he spoke on the tariff, the [[Oregon]] boundary, in favor of the [[Fiscal Bank Act]], and in opposition to the [[annexation of Texas]]. On Webster's re-election to the Senate in 1845, Choate resumed his law practice. He later served a short term as attorney-general of Massachusetts in 1853–1854. In 1846, Choate convinced a jury that the accused, [[Albert Tirrell]], did not cut the throat of his lover, or, if he did so, he did it while [[sleepwalking]], under the 'insanity of sleep'.&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/University_Library/exhibits/RLCexhibit/bickford/bickfordms.html|title=Maria Bickford|publisher=Brown University Law Library|accessdate=2007-11-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121160717/http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/University_Library/exhibits/RLCexhibit/bickford/bickfordms.html|archivedate=2007-11-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His successful use of [[sleepwalking]] as a defense against [[murder]] charges was the first time in American legal history this defense was successful in a murder prosecution.&lt;ref name="trials"&gt;{{cite book| first=Edward W.| last=Kappman (ed)| year=1994 | title=Great American Trials | publisher=Visible Ink Press| location=Detroit, MI| pages= 101–104| isbn= 0-8103-9134-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a faithful supporter of Webster's policy as declared in the latter's [[Seventh of March Speech]] of 1850 and labored to secure for him the presidential nomination at the Whig national convention in 1852. In 1853, he was a member of the state constitutional convention.

In 1856, he refused to follow most of his former Whig associates into the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] and gave his support to Democrat [[James Buchanan]], whom he considered the representative of a national instead of a sectional party.

Failing health led him to seek rest in a trip to [[Europe]], but he died on July 13, 1859, at [[Halifax (former city), Nova Scotia|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], where he had been put ashore when it was seen that he probably could not last the voyage across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].

'''John Ignatius Quinn''', commonly known as '''Seán Quinn''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://namawinelake.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/quinnjudgmentbelfast.pdf IRISH BANK RESOLUTION CORPORATION LIMITED vs JOHN IGNATIUS QUINN A/K/A SEAN QUINN] - [[High Court in Northern Ireland|High Court of Justice in Northern Ireland]], Chancery Division, Case 133033&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Irish people|Irish]] businessman and conglomerateur.

The ''[[Sunday Times Rich List]]'' in 2008 estimated his personal worth to be €4.722 billion or
£3.73 billion, thereby making him the richest person in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/specials/rich_list/ |title=Sunday Times Rich List 2008 &amp;#124; Times Online Business |publisher=Business.timesonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=17 January 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Forbes'' magazine's 2008 Rich List listed him again as the richest person in Ireland, in 164th place amongst the wealthiest individuals in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/10/billionaires08_Sean-Quinn-family_DHXK.html |title=#164 Sean Quinn &amp; family |publisher=Forbes.com |date=11 February 2008 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His net worth, as of February 2008, was estimated at $6.0 billion, approximately £3.084 billion.

In November 2005 the [[Quinn Group]], which was then privately owned by the Quinn family, was elsewhere estimated to be worth between €4 billion and €5 billion.&lt;ref name="archives2005"/&gt; In 2007 the group made a pre-tax profit of £439m.&lt;ref name="belfasttelegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/article2342228.ece |title=Quinn business thrives with profits of 430 million pounds |publisher=Belfasttelegraph.co.uk |date=9 March 2007 |accessdate=17 January 2012 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/0816/quinn-business.html |title=RTÉ, "Quinn group create 460 Welsh jobs", 16 August 2005 |publisher=Rte.ie |date=16 August 2005 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011 Kieran Wallace of KPMG was appointed as share receiver to [[Anglo Irish Bank]] (to which the Quinn Group owe over €2.8 billion) and took control of the Quinn family’s equity interest in Quinn Group.

Quinn is married to Patricia and they have five children - Seán, Colette, Ciara, Aoife and Brenda.

==Irish business==
In an interview with Ireland's ''[[Sunday Business Post]]'', Seán Quinn attributed his initial success to the contacts he developed through the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]]. These contacts enabled him to build a company spanning both sides of the Irish border when, in 1973, he borrowed £100 and started extracting gravel from his family {{convert|23|acre|m2|adj=on}} farm, washing it and selling it to local builders. The company was called Seán Quinn Quarries Ltd. From this came Quinn Cement, the basis of his wealth. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} In recent years Quinn  diversified with his [[Quinn Group]] playing a leading role in Ireland's hospitality industry, setting up Quinn Hotels. The centrepiece hotel was the Slieve Russell Hotel in [[Ballyconnell]], [[County Cavan]]. He maintains interests in Ireland's glass, radiator and plastics industries with Quinn Glass, based in [[Fermanagh]], and Quinn Lite Pac, based in [[County Longford]]. As of 2009, the [[Quinn Group]] employed more than 5,500 people throughout Ireland.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://communications.nuim.ie/press/180599.shtml |title=Two distinguished figures from the world of business conferred with honorary degrees by the national university of Ireland at NUI Maynooth - Press Release |publisher=NUI Maynooth|date= 18 May 1999 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quinn Financial Services, founded in 1996, includes the Quinn Direct insurance business. With its headquarters in [[Cavan]], it made €123 million profit in the first six months of 2006 (up 38% on the previous year), on sales of €386 million between January and June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2006/0727/1153813803367.html |title=Quinn Directs half-year profits increase 38% to 123 million euros |publisher=Irishtimes.com |date=7 July 2006 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007 the Quinn Group purchased Ireland's second biggest health insurance provider, [[Bupa|Bupa Ireland]] for €150 million in a deal that saved BUPA from leaving Ireland's health insurance industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/0131/bupa.html |title=RTÉ Business, "Seán Quinn taking over Bupa Ireland", 31 January 2007 |publisher=Rte.ie |date=31 January 2007 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month Quinn increased his share holding in the [[Anglo Irish Bank]] to approximately 5%, for an equivalent value of €570 million - financed through the group's equity and through a deal with the Swiss-based giant [[Credit Suisse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbpost.ie/post/pages/p/story.aspx-qqqt=MARKETS-qqqm=nav-qqqid=20592-qqqx=1.asp |title=The Sunday Business Post |publisher=Sbpost.ie |date= |accessdate=17 January 2012 }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 2007 peaking in July 2008 Quinn increased his family's stake to 15% in Anglo Irish Bank. The bank along with all financial institutions in Ireland saw its share price collapse in the latter half of 2008, and on 15 January 2009 the Irish government announced it had taken control of the bank. Shares were trading for as little as 20c (from a high of €10.15c) before the takeover.

==Recession of 2008==
''Forbes'' Rich List had estimated that the Quinn family's net worth took a major hit in 2008-09, with [[Denis O'Brien]] replacing Quinn as Ireland's wealthiest person.&lt;ref&gt;Sunday Times, 20 July 2008 [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article4365250.ece text here]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anglo-Irish Bank investment===
A large part of the subsequent loss can be linked to the well-publicised near collapse of the Anglo Irish Bank, which wiped out at least €2.8 billion of the family's wealth.  Between October 2005 and July 2007 Sean Quinn built up a 28% stake in the bank, mainly through [[contracts for difference]], a financial instrument used to gamble on the bank share price.&lt;ref name="finan"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-16854331 BBC Northern Ireland | title=Sean Quinn's family begin fresh court battle with Anglo bank | publisher=BBC Northern Ireland | work=News | date=2 February 2012 | accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quinn admitted at the time in an RTÉ Prime Time interview that it had "set the company back 2 to 3 years".

In 2008 the shares or contracts for difference bought in Anglo Irish Bank dropped in value and the bank had to find a buyer for Quinn's shares. A group of clients known as the "[[Anglo Irish Bank hidden loans controversy#The "Golden Circle"|Golden Circle]]" bought the shares, and, controversially (and illegally), the bank lent them €451 million to buy them. The €451 million was never repaid as the [[Anglo Irish Bank hidden loans controversy]] emerged, following which the bank was nationalised in 2009.

===Quinn Insurance===
In 2008, Quinn Insurance was levied a record €3.25 million fine from the Financial Regulator in the Republic of Ireland with Seán Quinn personally being fined €200,000. These fines were related to loans issued from Quinn Insurance to an associated company that he controlled. ''"These loans breached insurance regulations and as a result of this the Financial Regulator has sanctioned Quinn Insurance and myself. I accept complete responsibility for this breach of regulation."'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7689642.stm |title=Quinn Insurance Fined |publisher=BBC News |date=24 October 2008 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fines arose from a failure to notify the regulator of a loan of €288 million from Quinn Insurance to other firms in his group. The cash was used by the Quinn family to cover falling stock market investments and finance share-buying in Anglo Irish Bank. On the back of the fines, Quinn stepped down from the board of Quinn Insurance and a number of other Quinn Group boards announcing plans to restructure the boards to reflect those of a public company. In March 2010 The High Court in Dublin ruled that Quinn Insurance should be placed into administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8600774.stm |title=Quinn attacks administrator move |publisher=BBC News |date=2 April 2010 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2008/1025/1224838828947.html |title=Quinn Steps Down |publisher=Irishtimes.com |date=10 October 2008 |accessdate=17 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108213408/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2008/1025/1224838828947.html |archivedate=8 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quinn Insurance had made losses of €905m in 2009, and €160m in 2010, and the Irish Government passed the Insurance (Amendment ) Bill 2011 which imposed a 2% levy on all other Insurance policies to meet an estimated €280m shortfall to the state's Insurance Compensation Fund. Because part of the losses were caused by Quinn Insurance loans to fund speculative investments for other Quinn family companies, [[Clare Daly]] commented that - "A large percentage of insurance losses result from speculative gambling on the property market by the family and, in effect, the legislation provides for the transfer of those gambling debts on to the shoulders of hard pressed taxpayers and working people who need to insure cars, homes and so on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/2011/09/27/00025.asp |title=Dail debate on the Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2011 |publisher=Debates.oireachtas.ie |date=27 September 2011 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost to Irish policyholders will come to €65m annually over five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0913/insurance-business.html |title=Report on RTÉ website, September 2011 |publisher=Rte.ie |date=13 September 2011 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liquidation litigation from 2010===
With Anglo Irish Bank's financial difficulties Quinn was pursued in 2010 for his loans from it, then about €2.8 billion secured on property worth much less.&lt;ref&gt;The Merchant, 8 June 2010 [http://www.merchant.ie/news/2010/06/08/sean-quinn-owes-2-8-bn-euro/ (text here)]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011 the loans were formally called, and an ongoing series of court cases are underway in several jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lisa O'Carroll in Dublin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/apr/14/ireland-former-richest-man-fortune-wiped-out |title=Ireland's former richest man has fortune wiped out &amp;#124; Business |publisher=The Guardian |date= 14 April 2011|accessdate=17 January 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, his overseas holding company, Quinn Investments Sweden, was wound up in July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Irish Times, 6 July 2011; [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2011/0706/1224300156168.html (text here)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011 Anglo Irish Bank was renamed as the [[Irish Bank Resolution Corporation]] (IBRC).

It was found in late 2011 that some of the Swedish company's assets had been transferred to family-controlled companies in [[Cyprus]], leading to a fresh round of litigation there. It was alleged by the liquidator that property owned in [[Russia]] worth $193m had been sold to a cousin, Peter Quinn, for $1,000 and a [[laptop computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2011/1012/1224305644909.html |title=Irish Times, 12 October 2011 |publisher=Irishtimes.com |date=12 October 2011 |accessdate=17 January 2012 |first1=Simon |last1=Carswell |first2=Michael |last2=Jansen |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012202514/https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2011/1012/1224305644909.html |archivedate=12 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quinn family described the allegations as "baseless and hardly deserving of comment”. Other property in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]], that was 93% controlled from Sweden was the subject of further proceedings in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2011/1210/1224308868351.html |title=More Anglo debt cases begin in Kiev over Quinn properties |publisher=Irishtimes.com |date=10 December 2011 |accessdate=17 January 2012 |first=Colm |last=Keena |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212163902/https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2011/1210/1224308868351.html |archivedate=12 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separately, Quinn's wife and children have started legal proceedings in Dublin in 2011 alleging that the €2.34 billion that he borrowed from Anglo-Irish Bank to buy the bank should not be repayable because the money was lent for the unlawful purpose of supporting the bank's share price. He has been joined as a third party in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilfeather |first=Vivion |url=http://www.examiner.ie/ireland/wife-and-children-join-quinn-in-court-action-170241.html |title=Wife and children join Quinn in court action |publisher=Irish Examiner |date=11 October 2011 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quinn Group liquidator's staff have said that since its liquidation in April 2011 an unusual amount of damage has been caused to the Quinn Group's property, and an executive's car was burnt out at his home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/0810/1224302181641.html |title=Arsonists damage Quinn executive's home and car |publisher=The Irish Times |date=10 August 2011 |accessdate=17 January 2012 |first=Conor |last=Lally}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 November 2011, Quinn said that he had applied for [[Bankruptcy in the United Kingdom|voluntary bankruptcy]] in [[Belfast]], and issued a statement asking the media to consider his views as well as the bank's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/1111/quinns.html |title=RTÉ report, 11 Nov 2011 |publisher=Rte.ie |date=11 November 2011 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/1111/sean_quinn.pdf |title=Mr Quinn's statement of 11 Nov 2011 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=17 January 2012 |work=RTÉ News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119082858/http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/1111/sean_quinn.pdf |archivedate=19 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was filed under his legal name of '''John Ignatius Quinn''', using an address in Northern Ireland, and he admitted debts of €194m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-15722053 |title=BBC News - Anglo Irish Bank to challenge Sean Quinn bankruptcy |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=14 November 2011 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2011/1112/1224307462111.html |title=State and IBRC no worse off after declaration of bankruptcy |publisher=The Irish Times |date=12 November 2011 |accessdate=17 January 2012 |first=Colm |last=Keena |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116205757/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2011/1112/1224307462111.html |archivedate=16 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within days the IBRC said it would challenge the Belfast application in the commercial court in [[Dublin]], alleging that Quinn had only used a [[Republic of Ireland]] address in directors' filings for 95 companies and none in Northern Ireland (at the time, personal bankruptcies lasted for 12 years in the Republic, but only for 1 year in Northern Ireland).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/1114/quinn-business.html |title=IBRC to challenge Quinn Belfast move - RTÉ News |publisher=Rte.ie |date=14 November 2011 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However a check of the electoral register for County Cavan clearly showed Sean Quinn registered as a resident of the Irish Republic having a vote in all elections, obviously contradicting the evidence given to the Belfast Court that he was only resident in County Fermanagh.

On 10 January 2012 the High Court in Belfast annulled the Bankruptcy Order against Quinn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In July 2012, Seán Quinn, his son Seán Jr and Peter Darragh Quinn were served with around 30 coercive court orders intended to reverse [[asset stripping|asset-stripping]] measures, after courts had earlier found that all three acted in contempt of orders restraining asset-stripping. Seán Quinn was not jailed as the judge agreed to a request by IBRC that he remain free to secure compliance with the coercive orders.&lt;ref name="IT121025"/&gt; However, representatives of IBRC have complained that Seán Quinn Sr. has "done nothing to purge his contempt and reverse the asset stripping since the July 20th coercive orders were made".&lt;ref name="IT121019"/&gt; The bank was concerned that asset-stripping was still going on and that assets could be "irretrievably lost".&lt;ref name="IT121019"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/1019/breaking5.html |title=Seán Quinn junior freed from jail |publisher=The Irish Times |date=19 October 2012 |first=Mary |last=Carolan |accessdate=1 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107142647/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/1019/breaking5.html |archivedate=7 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seán Quinn was sentenced by Ms Justice Elizabeth Dunne at the High Court in Dublin on 2 November 2012 to 9 weeks in jail, noting that "In my view he has only himself to blame."&lt;ref name=BBC20167760&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20167760|title=Sean Quinn, once Ireland's richest man, is given 9 week jail term|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2 November 2012|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quinn was released from Mountjoy Prison on 3 January 2013, although he had been allowed to attend the Christening of his granddaughter in December.&lt;ref name="IT130103"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2013/0103/breaking20.html |title=Quinn describes prison as 'tough' |publisher=The Irish Times |date=3 January 2013 |first=Colin |last=Gleeson |accessdate=24 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104083806/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2013/0103/breaking20.html |archivedate=4 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 January, a two-day cross-examination began in court of all five adult children of Quinn, as well as of Karen Woods, wife of Seán Jr., and of Niall McPartland, husband of Ciara. The cross-examination was conducted by lawyers for IBRC and the goal was to establish whether the members of the Quinn family have complied with court orders to provide full details of their bank accounts and other assets.&lt;ref name="IT130124"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2013/0124/breaking24.html |title=Quinn daughter has Dubai accounts|publisher=The Irish Times| date= 24 January 2013|first=Mary|last=Carolan|accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it turned out, substantial sums of money had been paid by Russian subsidiaries of Quinn's real estate business to his children and other family members in 2011/12. For example, Colette Quinn received €340,000 after having allegedly signed a contract "without understanding it as it was in Russian"&lt;ref name="IT130130"/&gt; and having "had no documents indicating what work she was expected to do".&lt;ref name="IT130130"/&gt; She also admitted to being a director of "about eight Cypriot companies".&lt;ref name="IT130130"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2013/0130/breaking28.html |title=Quinn 'spent €327,000 in year' |publisher=The Irish Times |date=30 January 2013 |first=Mary |last=Carolan |accessdate=14 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130130231333/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2013/0130/breaking28.html |archivedate=30 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the money has allegedly since been spent, but no receipts were available to support that claim.&lt;ref name="IT130130"/&gt;

Since the government liquidated IBRC in February 2013, the Quinn family has been thinking about a legal challenge to the constitutionality of the IBRC act. This act put an immediate stay on all existing legal proceedings against IBRC, including one brought by the Quinn family which claims that they are not liable for a €2.34bn loan made to Quinn by Anglo Irish. A court hearing on the validity of the stay has been set for 7 March.&lt;ref name="IT130214"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2013/0214/1224330012998.html |title=Quinn family considers challenge to constitutionality of IBRC Act |publisher=The Irish Times |date=14 February 2013 |first=Mary |last=Carolan |accessdate=14 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214010505/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2013/0214/1224330012998.html |archivedate=14 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overseas business==
The Quinn Group had expanded into the hospitality industry overseas, with hotels in the [[Czech Republic]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Poland]]. The Quinn Group took control of the [[Prague]] [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton]], the largest five-star hotel in Prague, in 2004. It paid €145 million for the 788-room Hilton and the Ibis Karlin. The group also acquired the Hilton Hotel in [[Sofia, Bulgaria]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2006/0320/pf776696994BZPRAGUE.html ''The Irish Times''] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the group bought [[The De Vere Belfry]] hotel and golf course in [[England]]. In 2004 Quinn Direct insurance expanded into the UK motor and commercial insurance market. Quinn Direct Insurance sponsored the [[British Masters]] tournament there in May 2006.

On 7 March 2007, Seán Quinn spoke publicly for the first time in 10 years at a conference at the Slieve Russell hotel organised by the Cavan County Enterprise Board, at which he outlined the strategic aims of the Quinn Group in the immediate future. As of April 2011 Sean Quinn and the Quinn family no longer have any role in the management, operations or ownership of the Quinn Group.&lt;ref name=poston/&gt;

The currently ongoing litigation about asset-stripping involves former properties of Quinn's in [[Ukraine]] and [[Russia]]. In [[Kiev]], the IBRC has been trying to establish control over the Univermag "Ukraina" mall - so far unsuccessfully.&lt;ref name="Kiev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/business/news-reports-yanukovych-tied-to-ukraina-shopping-mall-dispute-317170.html |title=News reports: Yanukovych tied to Ukraina shopping mall dispute|publisher=[[Kyiv Post]]| date= 5 December 2012 |first=Mark|last=Rachkevych|accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, IBRC has hired Russian [[Alfa Group]]'s asset recovery arm to enforce its claims.&lt;ref name="IT121203"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/1203/1224327389885.html |title=IBRC effort to seize mall must clear murky world of politics in Ukraine |publisher=[[The Irish Times]] |date=3 December 2012 |first=Colm |last=Keena |accessdate=7 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121205210000/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/1203/1224327389885.html |archivedate=5 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, IBRC is still struggling to establish its control over the Kutuzoff (or Kutuzov) Tower.&lt;ref name="Indep121104"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/russian-giant-goes-after-quinns-assets-3281797.html |title=Russian giant goes after Quinns' assets|publisher=The Independent| date= 4 November 2012 |first=|last=|accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Quinn was born in [[Derrylin]], [[County Fermanagh]], near the border with [[County Cavan]], where he and [[Peter Quinn (GAA President)|his brother Peter]] played [[Gaelic football]] for [[Teemore]]. Peter became a financial advisor and in 1990 he was elected President of the Gaelic Athletic Association, Ireland's largest sporting and cultural organisation, in which role he served between 1991–1994. The brothers have a very close relationship with Peter playing a key role in the [[Quinn Group]]. Sean Quinn also grew up knowing local  business man and property tycoon Terence McGuckin, Co, Tyrone, (est 3.75mGBP 2012). Seán Quinn himself captained the [[Fermanagh GAA|Fermanagh team]].&lt;ref name="archives.tcm.ie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2005/11/20/story9822.asp |title=The Sunday Business Post |publisher=Archives.tcm.ie |date= |accessdate=17 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506003249/http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2005/11/20/story9822.asp |archivedate=6 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Quinn Group]] is also an important sponsor of [[Fermanagh GAA]]. Quinn's involvement in the Gaelic Athletic Association is, in the words of one commentator, "a constant theme throughout the group". In the words of one associate, "The GAA forms a big part of Seán's life. Aside from that, he drinks the occasional jar in pubs in Ballyconnell and enjoys the odd game of poker."&lt;ref name="archives.tcm.ie"/&gt;
Sean also donated land to Kildallan GFC which was used in the development of a training field.

On 18 May 1999 Seán Quinn was awarded an Honorary [[Doctor of Laws]] from [[NUI Maynooth]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; He also holds an Honorary Doctorate from [[Queens University Belfast]] (QUB).

His private life is closely guarded and he rarely grants interviews. His five children - Seán, Colette, Ciara, Aoife and Brenda
- all work in the family business. His son, Seán Jr., lined out for the [[Fermanagh GAA|Fermanagh minor team]].&lt;ref name="archives.tcm.ie"/&gt;  Collette Quinn was also director of BOUVERIE NO.1 LIMITED   Ultimate Holding Company  QUINN PROPERTY INVESTMENTS LIMITED, Shareholder funds  -£87,531,000  - now in liquidation [creditsafe.uk]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.creditsafeuk.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, he was jailed for three months for contempt of court, having allegedly engaged in asset stripping, e.g. by arranging a payment of US$500,000 to the general director of Quinn Properties Ukraine, just before losing control of the company.&lt;ref name="IT121025"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2012/1025/1224325678949.html |title=Court finds Quinn jnr's contempt 'outrageous' |publisher=The Irish Times |date=25 October 2012 |first=Mary |last=Carolan |accessdate=1 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025143558/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2012/1025/1224325678949.html |archivedate=25 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Seán Sr. lives with his wife and family in [[Ballyconnell]], [[Tullyhaw]], [[County Cavan]], next to his landmark Slieve Russell Hotel and just down the road from his birthplace in [[Derrylin]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1742">{{Portal|Organized labour}}'''Strike pay''' is payments made by a [[trade union]] to [[workers]] who are on [[strike action|strike]] as help in meeting their basic needs while on strike, often out of a special [[reserve (accounting)|reserve]] known as a ''strike fund''. Union workers reason that the availability of strike pay increases their leverage at the [[collective bargaining|bargaining table]] and actually decreases the probability of a strike, since the employers are aware that their employees have this financial resource available to them if they choose to strike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitedafa.org/contract/negotiations/strike/value/default.aspx "The Value of a Strike Fund" Association of Flight Attendants-CWA website; access date September 22, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United Kingdom==
Whilst some trade unions make payments to members who are on an official strike there is no requirement to do so. The UK government makes the presumption that [[workers]] on official strike action are being paid strike pay, and so they may not be entitled to [[welfare (financial aid)|state benefits]].

== Strike fund ==
A strike fund is a reserve set up by a union ahead of time (through [[special assessment]]s or from general funds) and used to provide strike pay or for other strike-related activities.

[[File:Zonmar-en.svg|thumb|300px|right|Schematic map of maritime zones (aerial view).]]

The term "territorial waters" is  sometimes used informally to refer to any area of water over which a state has [[jurisdiction]], including  [[internal waters]], the territorial sea, the contiguous zone, the [[exclusive economic zone]] and potentially the [[continental shelf]].

== Baseline ==
{{main|Baseline (sea)}}

Normally, the baseline from which the territorial sea is measured is the low-water line along the coast as marked on large-scale charts officially recognized by the coastal state.  This is either the low-water mark closest to the shore, or alternatively it may be an unlimited distance from permanently exposed land, provided that some portion of elevations exposed at low tide but covered at high tide (like mud flats) is within {{convert|12|nmi}} of permanently exposed land.  Straight baselines can alternatively be defined connecting fringing islands along a coast, across the mouths of rivers, or with certain restrictions across the mouths of bays.  In this case, a bay is defined as "a well-marked indentation whose penetration is in such proportion to the width of its mouth as to contain land-locked waters and constitute more than a mere curvature of the coast. An indentation shall not, however, be regarded as a bay unless its area is as large as, or larger than, that of the semi-circle whose diameter is a line drawn across the mouth of that indentation".  The baseline across the bay must also be no more than {{convert|24|nmi}} in length.

== Internal waters ==
[[File:Ph Territorial Map.png|thumb|300px|Internal and external territorial waters of the [[Philippines]] prior to the adoption of new baselines in 2009.]]
{{main|Internal waters}}

Waters landward of the baseline are defined as [[internal waters]], over which the state has complete sovereignty: not even innocent passage is allowed without explicit permission from said state. Lakes and rivers are considered internal waters. All "archipelagic waters" within the outermost islands of an [[archipelagic state]] such as [[Indonesia]] or the [[Philippines]] are also considered internal waters, and are treated the same with the exception that innocent passage through them must be allowed. However, archipelagic states may designate certain sea lanes through these waters.

== Territorial sea ==

'''Territorial sea''', as defined by the 1982 [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part2.htm|title=UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a belt of [[coast]]al waters extending at most {{convert|12|nmi|1|lk=on}} from the [[baseline (sea)|baseline]] (usually the mean low-water mark) of a coastal state.  The territorial sea is regarded as the sovereign territory of the state, although foreign ships (military and civilian) are allowed [[innocent passage]] through it, or [[transit passage]] for [[strait]]s; this sovereignty also extends to the airspace over and seabed below. Adjustment of these boundaries is called, in international law, [[maritime delimitation]].

A state's territorial sea extends up to {{convert|12|nmi|1}} from its baseline.  If this would overlap with another state's territorial sea, the border is taken as the median point between the states' baselines, unless the states in question agree otherwise.  A state can also choose to claim a smaller territorial sea.

Conflicts have occurred whenever a coastal nation claims an entire gulf as its territorial waters while other nations only recognize the more restrictive definitions of the UN convention. Claims which draw baseline in excess of 24 nautical miles (two 12 nm limits) are judged excessive by the U.S.  Two conflicts occurred in the [[Gulf of Sidra]] where Libya drew a line in excess of 230 nm and claimed the entire enclosed gulf as its territorial waters. The U.S. exercised [[freedom of navigation]] rights twice, in the [[Gulf of Sidra incident (1981)|1981]] and [[Gulf of Sidra incident (1989)|1989]] Gulf of Sidra incidents.

In the U.S. federal system, individual states exercise ownership (subject to federal law) up to 3 nautical miles (9 nautical miles for Texas and Florida) from shore, while the federal government exercises sole territorial jurisdiction further out (see [[Tidelands]]).

== Contiguous zone ==

The '''contiguous zone''' is a band of water extending farther from the outer edge of the territorial sea to up to {{convert|24|nmi|1}} from the baseline, within which a state can exert limited control for the purpose of preventing or punishing "infringement of its customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and regulations within its territory or territorial sea".  This will typically be {{convert|12|nmi}} wide, but could be more (if a state has chosen to claim a territorial sea of less than 12 nautical miles), or less, if it would otherwise overlap another state's contiguous zone.  However, unlike the territorial sea, there is no standard rule for resolving such conflicts and the states in question must negotiate their own compromise.  The [[United States]] invoked a contiguous zone out to 24 nmi from the baseline on 29 September 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clinton4.nara.gov/CEQ/990902a.html|title=New Action to Protect &amp; Preserve U.S. Shores &amp; Oceans|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exclusive economic zone ==
{{main|Exclusive economic zone}}

An [[exclusive economic zone]] extends from the baseline to a maximum of {{convert|200|nmi|1}} , thus it includes the contiguous zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part5.htm|title=PREAMBLE TO THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A coastal nation has control of all economic resources within its exclusive economic zone, including fishing, mining, oil exploration, and any pollution of those resources. However, it cannot  prohibit passage or loitering above, on, or under the surface of the sea that is  in compliance  with the laws and regulations adopted by the coastal State in accordance with the provisions of the UN Convention, within that portion of its exclusive economic zone beyond its territorial sea. Before the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 1982, coastal nations arbitrarily extended their territorial waters in an effort to control activities which are now regulated by the exclusive economic zone, such as offshore [[oil exploration]] or fishing rights (see [[Cod Wars]]). Indeed, the exclusive economic zone is still popularly, though erroneously, called a coastal nation's territorial waters.

==Continental shelf==

=== Definition ===

Article 76&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part6.htm|title=PREAMBLE TO THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives the legal definition of '''continental shelf''' of coastal countries. For the physical geography definition, see the [[continental shelf]] 

The continental shelf of a coastal nation extends out to the outer edge of the [[continental margin]] but at least {{convert|200|nmi}} from the baselines of the territorial sea if the continental margin does not stretch that far. Coastal states have the right of exploration and exploitation of the seabed and the natural resources that lie on or beneath it, however other states may lay cables and pipelines if they are authorised by the coastal state. The outer limit of a country's continental shelf shall not stretch beyond {{convert|350|nmi}} of the baseline, or beyond {{convert|100|nmi}} from the {{convert|2500|m}} [[isobath]], which is a line connecting the depths of the seabed at 2,500 meters.

The outer edge of the continental margin for the purposes of this article is defined as:
: *a series of lines joining points not more than {{convert|60|nmi}} apart where the thickness of sedimentary rocks is at least 1% of the height of the continental shelf above the foot of the continental slope; or
: *a series of lines joining points not more than 60 nautical miles apart that is not more than 60 nautical miles from the foot of the continental margin.
The foot of the continental slope is determined as the point of maximum change in the gradient at its base.

The portion of the continental shelf beyond the 200 nautical mile limit is also known as the '''extended continental shelf'''. Countries wishing to delimit their outer continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles have to submit scientific information for the basis of their claim to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. The Commission then validates or makes recommendations on the scientific basis for the extended continental shelf claim. The scientific judgement of the Commission shall be final and binding.  If validated extended continental shelf claims overlap any demarcation between two or more parties are decided by bilateral or multilateral negotiation, not by the Commission.

Countries have ten years after ratifying UNCLOS to lodge their submissions to extend their continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles, or by 13 May 2009 for countries where the convention was ratified before 13 May 1999. As of 1 June 2009, 51 submissions have been lodged with the Commission, of which eight have been deliberated by the Commission and have had recommendations issued. The eight are (in the order of date of submission): Russian Federation; Brazil; Australia; Ireland; New Zealand; the joint submission by France, Ireland, Spain and the United Kingdom; Norway and Mexico.

For full list, see [[#Extended continental shelf claims|below]]

=== Rights over the continental shelf ===

Articles 77 to 81 define the rights of a country over its continental shelf.

A coastal nation has control of all resources on or under its continental shelf, living or not, but no control over any living organisms above the shelf that are beyond its exclusive economic zone. This gives it the right to conduct hydrocarbon exploration and drilling works.

From the eighteenth century until the mid twentieth century, the territorial waters of the [[British Empire]], the [[United States]], [[France]] and many other nations were [[Three-mile limit|three nautical miles (5.6 km) wide]]. Originally, this was the length of a [[cannon]] shot, hence the portion of an ocean that a sovereign state could defend from shore. However, [[Iceland]] claimed two nautical miles (3.7&amp;nbsp;km), [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] claimed four nautical miles (7.4&amp;nbsp;km), and [[Spain]] claimed {{convert|6|nmi}} during this period. During incidents such as nuclear weapons testing and fisheries disputes some nations arbitrarily extended their maritime claims to as much as fifty or even two hundred nautical miles. Since the late 20th century the "12 mile limit" has become almost universally accepted. The [[United Kingdom]] extended its territorial waters from three to twelve nautical miles (22&amp;nbsp;km) in 1987.

During the [[League of Nations Codification Conference, 1930|League of Nations Codification Conference]] in 1930, the issue of establishing international legislation on territorial waters was raised, but no agreement was reached.&lt;ref&gt;''Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 1949'', p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims by legislation to the adjacent continental shelf and fishing was first made by the United States government immediately following the [[Second World War]]. On September 28, 1945, US President [[Harry S. Truman]] issued two proclamations that established government control of natural resources in areas adjacent to the coastline. One of these proclamation was titled "Policy of the United States With Respect to the Natural Resources of the Subsoil and
Sea Bed of the Continental Shelf", and stipulated in its operative clause:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the Government of the United States regards the natural resources of the subsoil and sea bed of the continental shelf beneath the high seas but contiguous to the coasts of the United States as appertaining to the United States, subject to its jurisdiction and control.&lt;ref&gt;text in ''Department of State Bulletin'', September 30, 1945, p. 485&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second proclamation was titled "Policy of the United States With Respect to Coastal Fisheries in Certain Areas of the High Seas", and stated in its operative clause:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the Government of the United States regards it as proper to establish conservation zones in those areas of the high seas contiguous to the coasts of the United States wherein fishing activities have been or in the future may be developed and maintained on a substantial scale.&lt;ref&gt;text in ''Department of State Bulletin'', September 30, 1945, p. 486&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the US Presidential proclamation, the issue of legally determining territorial waters by international agreement was raised, and in its first session in 1949, the [[International Law Commission]] of the [[United Nations]] added the subject to its agenda.

The important issue of the breadth of territorial waters could not be resolved at either the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|UNCLOS I]] (1956-1958) or UNCLOS II (1960) conferences, with neither the two major contenders of a 3-mile or 12-mile limit reaching the required two-thirds support. This lack of agreement had the potential to lead to serious international disputes.&lt;ref name=mlr82-behuniak/&gt; It was only at the UNCLOS III (1973-1982) conference, whose provisions did not come into force until 1994, that this issue was resolved at twelve nautical miles.

== Miscellaneous ==

[[Pirate radio]] broadcasting from artificial marine fixtures or anchored ships can be controlled by the affected coastal nation or other nations wherever that broadcast may originate, whether in the territorial sea, exclusive economic zone, the continental shelf or even on the [[high seas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part7.htm|title=PREAMBLE TO THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF THE SEA|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus a coastal nation has total control over its internal waters, slightly less control over territorial waters, and ostensibly even less control over waters within the contiguous zones. However, it has total control of economic resources within its exclusive economic zone as well as those on or under its continental shelf.

Throughout this article, distances measured in nautical miles are exact legal definitions, while those in kilometres are approximate conversions that are not stated in any law or treaty.

Federal nations, such as the United States, divide control over certain waters between the federal government and the individual states.  (See [[tidelands]].)

{{For|the part of the economy sometimes referred to as the "third sector"|Voluntary sector}}
{{Economic sectors}}[[File:Product’s lifecycle.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Product’s lifecycle]]
The '''tertiary sector''' or '''service sector''' is the third of the three [[economic sector]]s of the [[three-sector theory]]. The others are the [[secondary sector]] (approximately the same as [[manufacturing]]), and the [[primary sector]] ([[raw material]]s).

The service sector consists of the production of [[Service (economics)|services]] instead of [[Product (business)|end products]].  Services (also known as "intangible goods") include attention, advice, access, experience, and   [[affective labor]].  The [[information economy|production of information]] has long been regarded as a service, but some economists now attribute it to a fourth sector, the [[quaternary sector]].

The tertiary sector of industry involves the provision of services to other businesses as well as final consumers. Services may involve the [[transport]], [[distribution (economics)|distribution]] and sale of goods from producer to a consumer, as may happen in [[wholesaler|wholesaling]] and [[retailer|retailing]], [[pest control]] or [[entertainment]]. The goods may be transformed in the process of providing the service, as happens in the [[restaurant]] industry. However, the focus is on people interacting with people and serving the customer rather than transforming physical goods.

== Difficulty of definition ==

It is sometimes hard to define whether a given company is part and parcel of the secondary or tertiary sector. And it is not only companies that have been classified as part of that sector in some schemes; government and its services such as police or military, and non-profit organizations such as charities or research associations can also be seen as part of that sector.&lt;ref name="Lakhe2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=R.P. Mohanty &amp; R.R. Lakhe|title=TQM in the Service Sector|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ASwLRRY6vIAC&amp;pg=PT33|accessdate=1 May 2013|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Jaico Publishing House|isbn=978-81-7224-953-3|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to classify a business as a service, one can use classification systems such as the [[United Nations]]' [[International Standard Industrial Classification]] standard, the [[United States]]' [[Standard Industrial Classification]] (SIC) code system and its new replacement, the [[North American Industrial Classification System]] (NAICS), the [[Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community]] (NACE) in the EU and similar systems elsewhere. These governmental classification systems have a first-level hierarchy that reflects whether the economic goods are tangible or intangible.

For purposes of [[finance]] and [[market research]], [[Market (economics)|market]]-based classification systems such as the [[Global Industry Classification Standard]] and the [[Industry Classification Benchmark]] are used to classify businesses that participate in the service sector. Unlike governmental classification systems, the first level of market-based classification systems divides the economy into functionally related markets or industries. The second or third level of these hierarchies then reflects whether goods or services are produced.

== Theory of progression ==
For the last 100 years, there has been a substantial shift from the primary and secondary sectors to the tertiary sector in industrialized countries. This shift is called '''tertiarisation'''.&lt;ref name=eurofound&gt;[http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emire/GREECE/TERTIARIZATION-GR.htm Definition by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720074155/http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emire/GREECE/TERTIARIZATION-GR.htm |date=July 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tertiary sector is now the largest sector of the economy in the [[Western world]], and is also the fastest-growing sector.
In examining the growth of the service sector in the early Nineties, the [[Globalism|globalist]] [[Kenichi Ohmae]] noted that:
: "In the United States 70 percent of the workforce works in the service sector; in Japan, 60 percent, and in Taiwan, 50 percent. These are not necessarily busboys and live-in maids. Many of them are in the professional category. They are earning as much as manufacturing workers, and often more.”&lt;ref&gt;The Borderless World: Power and Strategy in the Interlinked Economy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economies tend to follow a developmental progression that takes them from a heavy reliance on agriculture and mining, toward the development of [[manufacturing]] (e.g. automobiles, textiles, shipbuilding, steel) and finally toward a more service-based structure. The first economy to follow this path in the modern world was the [[United Kingdom]]. The speed at which other economies have made the transition to service-based (or "[[Post-industrial economy|post-industrial]]") economies has increased over time.

Historically, manufacturing tended to be more open to [[international trade]] and competition than services. However, with dramatic cost reduction and speed and reliability improvements in the transportation of people and the communication of information, the service sector now includes some of the most intensive international competition, despite residual [[protectionism]].

== Issues for service providers ==
[[File:FirstIncision.JPG|thumb|Surgery team at work]]
[[File:Risciò-in-avorio.jpg|thumb|Transport service]]
[[File:Automatic Telephone Exchange- Communications in Wartime, London, England, UK, 1945 D23700.jpg|thumb|right|Testing telephone lines in [[London]] in 1945.]]
Service providers face obstacles selling services that goods-sellers rarely face.  Services are intangible, making it difficult for potential customers to understand what they will receive and what value it will hold for them. Indeed, some, such as [[consultants]] and providers of [[investment]] services, offer no guarantees of the value for price paid.

Since the quality of most services depends largely on the quality of the individuals providing the services, "people costs" are usually a high fraction of service costs.  Whereas a manufacturer may use technology, simplification, and other techniques to lower the cost of goods sold, the service provider often faces an unrelenting pattern of increasing costs.

[[Product differentiation]] is often difficult. For example, how does one choose one [[investment adviser]] over another, since they are often seen to provide identical services? Charging a premium for services is usually an option only for the most established firms, who charge extra based upon [[brand recognition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=De Soto|first=Glenn|title=Fragmented: the Demise of Unionized Construction|year=2006|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781847285775|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1236">'''Texturising''' or '''texturizing''' is the process by which [[synthetic fibres]] are modified to change their texture - the physical appearance of the [[fibre]]. Texturising techniques can include [[bulking]] (where [[thermoplastic]] fibres are twisted, heat set and untwisted), [[Crimping (manmade fibre)|crimping]] and [[coiling]], amongst others. Texturising takes advantage of the thermoplastic nature of synthetic fibres, and uses it to set texturised features in place.

Fibres may be texturised to improve the fibre's insulation properties (as processes like bulking allow it to trap air better), to minimise a shiny, synthetic-looking appearance, to reduce the silky nature of the fibre, or to create special effects ([[fancy yarns]]). 

These modifications will also affect the eventual [[fabric]], and fibres may be folded, looped, coiled or crinkled in order to improve the drape, appearance, lustre, warmth, elasticity or handle of the finished fabric. Texturising can reduce the "synthetic" appearance of a finished fabric, bringing its appearance closer to that of a natural fibre fabric.

'''Topple rate''' is a name of a ratio of speed at which firms lose their leadership positions. It was believed that it was originally created by Jack Percival following losing his job. The Wall Street Journal article that appeared on September 9, 2007 attributes authorship to [[Patrick Viguerie]], a McKinsey &amp; Co. consultant.

For example, the minicomputer industry began, grew up, got big, profitable, smug, senile and died in 20 years from 1975 to 1995. [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] is a prime exemplar. In this case the topple rate of the minicomputer industry was 20 years.

A high topple rate is especially frequently used as a saying in fields of technological business.

The [[Red Queen's race]] has incredible evolutionary similarities. To maintain a leadership position, an industry must change at the same or faster rate than competing industries.

{{redirect|Trusteeship}} 
'''Trustee''' (or the holding of a '''trusteeship''') is a [[legal term]] which, in its broadest sense, is a synonym for anyone in a [[position of trust]] and so can refer to any person who holds property, authority, or a position of trust or responsibility for the benefit of another. A trustee can also refer to a person who is allowed to do certain tasks but not able to gain income.&lt;ref name="Black's Law 5th"&gt;''Black's Law Dictionary, Fifth Edition'' (1979), p. 1357, {{ISBN|0-8299-2041-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although in the strictest sense of the term a trustee is the holder of property on behalf of a [[beneficiary (trust)|beneficiary]],&lt;ref name="Black's Law 5th"/&gt; the more expansive sense encompasses persons who serve, for example, on the [[Board of directors|board of trustees]] of an institution that operates for a charity, for the benefit of the general public, or a person in the local government.

A [[Trust law|trust]] can be set up either to benefit particular persons, or for any [[Charitable trust|charitable purposes]] (but not generally for non-charitable purposes): typical examples are a [[testamentary trust|will trust]] for the [[testator]]'s children and family, a [[pension]] trust (to confer benefits on employees and their families) and a charitable trust. In all cases, the trustee may be a person or [[company]], whether or not they are a prospective beneficiary.

==General duties of trustees==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Rule in Re Atkinson]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;
[[File:Chart of a trust.jpg|thumb|Chart of a trust]]
Trustees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/trusting/unit5all.html|title=The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics and the Law, Definition of "fiduciary duties" by Tamar Frankel Vol.2, p.127-128 |publisher=Harvard Edu|accessdate=2011-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; have certain duties (some of which are [[fiduciary]]).  These include the duty to:

* Carry out the expressed terms of the trust instrument &lt;ref name="Youyang"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|15|2003|litigants=[[Youyang Pty Ltd v Minter Ellison Morris Fletcher]]  |parallelcite=(2003) 212 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 484 |date=3 April 2003 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; - A trustee is bound to act in accordance with the terms of the trusts upon which he or she holds trust property, and commits a breach of trust if he or she departs from the terms of the trust.&lt;ref name="Breen v Williams"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|57|1996|litigants=[[Breen v Williams]] ("Medical Records Access case") |parallelcite=(1996) 186 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 71|date=6 September 1996 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a trustee may act otherwise than in accordance with the terms of the trust if all beneficiaries, being ''sui juris'' and together absolutely entitled, direct the trustee to do so (or so consent). If any question arises as to the constriction of the provisions of the trust, the trustee must approach the court for determination of the question.
* Defend the trust
* Prudently invest trust assets (in [[New South Wales]], this is mandated by ''Trustee Act 1925'' (NSW) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ta1925122|Trustee Act 1925}} ss14, 14A &amp; 14C.&lt;/ref&gt;)
* Be impartial among beneficiaries - the trustee must act impartially between individual beneficiaries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|VicLawRp|70|1948|litigants=Tanti v Carlson |parralelcite=[1948] [[Victorian Law Reports|VLR]] 401 |date=2 April 1948 |courtname=[[Supreme Court of Victoria|Supreme Court]] (Vic)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as between different classes of beneficiaries.
* Account for actions and keep beneficiaries informed, these include a duty to inform beneficiaries as to their entitlements under the trust&lt;ref&gt;Hawkesley v May [1956]&lt;/ref&gt; and other matters concerning the trust. Trustees do not have priority right to trust documents; it is a personal right and cannot be assigned&lt;ref&gt;Global Custodians v Mesh [2002]&lt;/ref&gt; The right to seek disclosure of trust documents is an aspect of the court's inherent jurisdiction to supervise the administration of trusts.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt v Rosewood Trust [2003]&lt;/ref&gt; As trustees as not under a duty to disclose their reasoning in applying a trust power (unless the trust instrument requires otherwise), there is no duty to disclose any documents dealing with the decision making promise.&lt;ref&gt;Tierney v King [1983]&lt;/ref&gt; Protection of confidentiality has been described as 'one of the most important limitations on the right to disclose of trust documents'. 'Memoranda or letter of wishes' do not necessarily need to be disclosed to a beneficiary if they are of a number of potential beneficiaries.
* Be loyal
* Not delegate
* Not profit; however, may charge fees for services to the Trust &lt;ref&gt;Case law authority ''Keech v Sanford'' [1726] EWHC Ch J76 [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/1726/J76.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Not be in a conflict of interest position
* Administer in the best interest of the beneficiaries
The modern interpretation of fiduciary duty requires the consideration of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors as these are long-term investment value drivers.&lt;ref&gt;PRI, UNEP FI, &amp; The Generation Foundation. [https://www.fiduciaryduty21.org/ Fiduciary Duty in the 21st Century]. 2018&lt;/ref&gt; When evaluating whether or not an institutional investor has delivered on its fiduciary duties, both the outcomes achieved and the process followed are of critical importance. 

The terms of instrument that creates the trust may narrow or expand these duties&amp;mdash;but in most instances they cannot be eliminated completely. Corporate trustees, typically trust departments at large banks, often have very narrow duties, limited to those the trust indenture explicitly defines.

A trustee carries the fiduciary responsibility and liability to use the trust assets according to the provisions of the trust instrument (and often regardless of their own or the beneficiaries' wishes). The trustee may find himself liable to [[claimant]]s, prospective beneficiaries, or third parties. In the event that a trustee incurs a liability (for example, in [[litigation]], or for taxes, or under the terms of a lease) in excess of the trust property they hold, they may find themselves personally liable for the excess.

Trustees are generally held to a "prudent person" standard in regard to meeting their fiduciary responsibilities, though investment, legal, and other professionals can, in some jurisdictions, be held to a higher standard commensurate with their higher expertise.&lt;ref&gt;see: “ Speight v Gaunt [1883] EWCA Civ 1 [http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1883/1.html]&lt;/ref&gt;-Trustees can be paid for their time and trouble in performing their duties only if the trust specifically provides for payment. It is common for lawyers to draft will trusts so as to permit such payment, and to take office accordingly: this may be an unnecessary expense for small estates.

In an exception to the duties outlined above, [[sabbatical officer]]s of [[students' union]]s who are also trustees of these organisations they work for do have the right to a salary (and hence profit from their being a trustee). This is an exception explicitly granted in the 1993 act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Publications/cc3.aspx#f2 |title=CC3 - The Essential Trustee: What you need to know |publisher=Charity-commission.gov.uk |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The broadest sense of the term ''trustee'' applies to someone held to a fiduciary duty similar in some respects to that of a trustee proper. For example, the directors of a bank may be trustees for the [[depositor]]s, directors of a [[corporation]] are trustees for the [[stockholder]]s and a guardian is trustee of his ward's property. Many corporations call their governing board a board of trustees, though in those cases they act as a [[board of directors]].

===Charities in the United Kingdom===
In the case of UK [[charitable trust|charities]], a ''trustee'' is a volunteer who undertakes fiduciary responsibilities on behalf of the charity, subject to the provisions of Charity Law, a branch of trust law, and the [[Charities Act 1993]].&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG|title=Charities Act 1993|path=ukpga/1992/38}}&lt;/ref&gt; For charity trustees, the [[Charity Commission]]  of England and Wales, [[Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator]] of Scotland and [[Voluntary Activity Unit]] of Northern Ireland often has concurrent jurisdiction with the courts. Many UK charities are also [[Limited company|limited liability companies]] registered with [[Companies House]], in this case the trustees are also directors of the company and their liability is limited. This is the preferred model if the charity owns property or employs people.

The law on this in England changed considerably with the Charities Act of 2006.  An account of the main changes can be found in "Charities Act 2006 A guide to the new law" by Michael King and Ann Phillips{{Who|date=August 2015}}.  One of the key changes made was that it introduced the [[Charitable Incorporated Organisation]] which is basically a limited liability charity.  There are thus now two main aspects of corporate management of charities.

One is the traditional way in which a corporation is a corporate trustee of a given charity.  The second is the new way, in which the charity itself is incorporated as a CIO.  The advantages and disadvantages of the different methods is a complicated matter.  According to King and Philips, many of the advantages of incorporating as a CIO are obtained if the trustees are not individuals but a corporate entity. {{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}

===Local government in the United States===
Depending on the state, a trustee is a member of the ''village board of trustees'', which is a village's elected [[legislative body]] as outlined by local or state law. It can be composed of the [[mayor]] and a set number of trustees and usually manages village property, finances, safety, health, comfort, and general welfare and leadership of the town (acting as a board of police or fire commissioners or a moderate income housing board for example).  ''Village board of trustees'' is comparable to but distinguished from  [[city council]] or [[town council]].  Small villages have a trustee instead of a mayor, who is elected to manage village business in a similar function.

In some states, a [[civil township]] may be administered by a trustee or a group of trustees; see [[Indiana Township Trustee]] for an example.

{{see also|Trusty system (prison)}}
In this context, a "trusty" is a prisoner who is trusted not to attempt an escape, and therefore requires little or no guarding.  For example, a trusty may be allowed to leave the prison to attend work or other important events.  Many times, "trusty" is misspelled{{cn|reason=citation needed for 'misspelled' claim - as a Google search today gave 'about 15000' hits for 'prison trustee' (including the item that resulted in this 'citation needed'), and only 'about 8970' for 'prison trusty', though also 'about 2710' for 'trusty prisoner' against only 'about 605' for 'trustee prisoner'. (Note: Googling without 'prison' or 'prisoner' gives too many examples unrelated to prison to be of use here). |date=October 2018}} as "trustee".

==Bankruptcy trustee==
In the United States, when a consumer or business files for bankruptcy all property belonging to the filer becomes property of a newly created entity, the "[[Estate (law)#Bankruptcy|bankruptcy estate]]".  (See 11 U.S.C. § 541.) For all bankruptcies (consumer or business) filed under [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]], [[Chapter 12, Title 11, United States Code|12]] or [[Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code|13]] of [[Title 11 of the United States Code]] (the Bankruptcy Code), a trustee (the "[[trustee in bankruptcy]]" or TIB) is appointed by the [[United States Trustee]], an officer of the Department of Justice that is charged with ensuring the integrity of the bankruptcy system and with representatives in each court, to manage the property of the bankruptcy estate, including bringing actions to avoid pre-bankruptcy transfers of property.  In bankruptcies filed under [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]], the [[debtor]] continues to manage the property of the bankruptcy estate, as "[[debtor in possession]]," subject to replacement for cause with a trustee.

Chapter 7 trustees in bankruptcy are chosen by the United States Trustee from a panel, and are known as panel trustees.  Every judicial district has a permanent Chapter 13 trustee, known as a "standing trustee." As cases under Chapter 12 (for family farmers or fishermen) are filed fairly infrequently, the United States Trustee usually makes trustee appointments in such cases on an ad hoc basis.
